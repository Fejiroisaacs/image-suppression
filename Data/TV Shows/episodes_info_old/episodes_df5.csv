Rachel is pushing for solos, Kurt is being bullied, etc. He thanks guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury for advising him to stay at the school.

Will meets with Cheerios (cheerleading) coach Sue Sylvester, who tells him the glee club is getting cut if it doesn't place at regionals. She points out he must get six more members to even qualify for regionals.

Finn and Quinn argue over his continued involvement in glee while Rachel eavesdrops. Quinn warns her to stay away from her man.

At practice the guys aren't into ""Le Freak,"" the song Will has them working on for the upcoming assembly. Will tells them this performance is huge for attracting new members.

With Will's wife Terri pregnant, the couple looks for a new house near her family. Will is worried about the cost but they decide to go forward.

Will allows them to start working on ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West to begin preparation for regionals.

Emma catches Rachel trying to throw up in the bathroom. Rachel wants to be thinner and prettier like Quinn. In advising Rachel, Emma continually makes reference to her feelings for Will.

Sue hauls Finn and Rachel in to see Principal Figgins after catching them using the Cheerios' copy machine to make fliers for glee club. Sue wants them thrown out of school but Figgins lets them off with just paying for the copies.

Rachel thinks doing ""Le Freak"" at the assembly is a terrible idea, and Finn is worried about what singing disco will do to his image.

Will tells Emma he can't find any extra work which might impact the quality of their house. Figgins lets Will take over a nighttime janitorial opening.

The celibacy club reluctantly lets in Rachel. During the boys half of the meeting we learn that Finn uses a car accident memory to keep from achieving orgasm too quickly. Rachel suggests contraception, which infuriates Quinn.

That night Emma runs into Will during his janitorial shift. While she helps him clean, Emma confides a childhood incident has left her hating messes. He helps her work through it and the two nearly kiss. Football coach Ken Tanaka sees the whole thing through the window.

Rachel arranges a Will-less glee club meeting. She suggests a sexually charged performance. Cut to the assembly. Will introducing the club, but is shocked to see a thrust and spank-heavy rendition of ""Push It.""

In Figgins' office, the principal and Sue rip Will for the inappropriate nature of the performance. Figgins won't shutdown glee, but the club must now pick from a pre-approved list.

Will is furious at Rachel for lying to him.

Ken approaches Emma at lunch. He tells her she should stop wasting her time fawning over a married man. He makes a case for her picking him.

Rachel help Finn practice. Afterwards the two share a meal and begin making-out. The interaction forces him to go to his car accident memory and he rushes out quickly.

Terri learns she is not with child. She is having a hysteric pregnancy wanting to get pregnant so badly her body mimics the symptoms.

Led by Quinn, several members of the Cheerios try out for glee with a performance of ""I Say a Little Prayer for You."" Sue finds out and Quinn admits she only did it to find out what is going on with Finn and Rachel. Sue likes the idea of having spies inside the glee club.

Emma tells Will they should cool it with the late-night meetings and tells him she has a date that night with Ken.

Will comes home that night. Terri lies about her doctor's appointment, saying they are having a boy.

Rachel is distraught when Will gives Quinn the solo in their next performance. Her disappointment leads to a teary rehearsal performance of ""Take a Bow."""

They are tickled but Terri is understandably shocked. Will confides in his father that he is scared. Will's father tells him parenthood is all about guts, and he regrets not following through with his dream of being a lawyer.

Voicing the concerns of the Cheerios members, Rachel (Lea Michele) tells Will at practice their choreography needs work. They want to hire Dakota Stanley (Whit Hertford), professional choreographer with a Broadway background.

Will tells Emma (Jayma Mays) about his fatherhood nervousness. She refers to new boyfriend Ken (Patrick Gallagher) as ""flawed.""

Shop teacher/cough medicine addict Henri (John Lloyd Young) is back at school after losing his thumbs in a table saw mishap. ""I'll never hitchhike across Europe,"" he says. Sitting in the teacher's lounge several of the male faculty members swap sob stories about their lives. After a particularly strong rendition of 'For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,' Will decides to form an a cappella group named Acafellas with Ken, Henri, and Howard (Kent Avenido). Sandy (Stephen Tobolowsky) was also singing with them in the lounge, but when he tries to show up at their first practice Will tells him that he makes the group look creepy.

Terri is wanting to have sex with Will more frequently in attempt to actually get pregnant.

Will is missing Glee practices to work with Acafellas. Finn (Cory Monteith) is mad at Rachel for pushing Will away with the choreography critique. The members of Glee decide to hire Dakota.

Rachel and Finn have an argument related to their make-out session. She wants to bring in Dakota, even if it means Finn will quit.

The Cheerios update Sue (Jane Lynch) about their progress taking down Glee from within. Quinn (Dianna Agron) thinks Dakota will be so hard on the Glee kids they will ""quit or commit suicide.""

Mercedes (Amber Riley) is wishing she had a boyfriend. The Cheerios think she should go after Kurt (Chris Colfer).

Acafellas perform Bell Biv DeVoe's ""Poison"" at a sports bar. After the show, Figgins (Iqbal Theba) asks Will if they will perform at the next PTA meeting.

A local newspaper prints a glowing review of the Acafellas' performance. Sandy (who still hasn't been allowed to join the group) wants in because Josh Groban is scheduled to be at the PTA meeting. Sandy is a hardcore fan of Groban's after Groban accidentally friended him on MySpace and has heard Groban may be looking for a opening act.

On the way to watching rehearsal of one of Dakota's groups, Vocal Adrenaline, Mercedes asks Kurt on a date. Members of the group warn the Glee kids Dakota is too hard. Following an outstanding rehearsal of Duffy's ""Mercy"" by Vocal Adrenaline, Dakota screams for them to ""get off my stage."" Afterwards Dakota tells the McKinley kids his fee is $8,000.

Howard calls Will and quits the Acafellas. Emma tells Will and Ken that Henri is headed to rehab. Emma convinces Will not to give up on Acafellas.

Finn tells Will he wants to quit Glee, that he isn't having fun anymore. Will brings up Acafellas. Mohawked football player and Cougar-chaser Puck (Mark Salling) asks Ken if he can be in the Acafellas.

The new Acafellas lineup works on its dance moves.

Rachel and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) try and warn Mercedes that Kurt is gay. Mercedes isn't convinced, and tells them she is tired of being lonely.

Sue has the Cheerios help with Glee's choreographer fundraising car wash. When Mercedes asks Kurt if they can make their relationship ""official,"" he tells her he's in love with someone else. He stares at Finn but tells Mercdes it is Rachel. She throws a rock through the windshield of his truck, leading to a performance by Mercedes of Jazmine Sullivan's ""Bust Your Windows.""

At the first Dakota-run rehearsal, the new choreographer begins by cutting Artie (Kevin McHale) and Mercedes and making fun of everybody. When everyone starts to quit, Rachel decides they should fire Dakota and celebrate their differences.

Before the Acafellas go on stage, Sandy tells them Josh Groban is in the front row. During their performance of Color Me Badd's ""I Want to Sex You Up,"" Terri seems to notice how much Emma is enjoying watching Will.

Groban comes backstage and serves Sandy with a restraining order.

In the parking lot after the show, Terri tells Will how impressed she was with the performance. We see Groban is all over Will's mother. Will tells his father the Acafellas thing was fun, but he is a teacher at heart. Will's father has decided to pursue his dream and go to law school.

At school the next day, Kurt tells Mercedes he is gay. She is the first person he has ever told. Mercedes tells him he shouldn't be ashamed of who he is. Kurt tells her he isn't confident enough to be himself.

Glee is back to work on a new number and Sue is furious the Cheerios failed at bringing down the club: ""I'm going to need you to smell your armpits. That's the smell of failure."" Quinn tells Sue she taught her ""when you really believe in yourself you don't have to bring other people down.""

Rachel and the rest of Glee tell Will they love their new choreography."

Kurt's father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), walks in on the proceedings and Kurt makes up a story about the dance being practice for his new gig as kicker on the football team.

Will (Matthew Morrison) and Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) are getting childbirth lessons from her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen). When Will leaves the room, Terri breaks down and tells Kendra that she isn't really pregnant. Of course Kendra thinks Terri should continue to lie and find a way to get a baby.

Will sits with Emma (Jayma Mays) and Ken (Patrick Gallagher) in the teacher's lounge. They discuss the fact Sue (Jane Lynch) now has her own segment (""Sue's Corner"") on one of the local TV news broadcasts. Sue walks over and talks trash about the job, citing the strength of the ratings from her first appearance. Sue feels this is her way of transcending the mundane job of high school teacher.

Rachel (Lea Michele) is miffed to learn Will has given the solo in Glee's new song to Tina.

Finn (Cory Monteith) helps Kurt get a tryout for the football team. Finn is not thrilled Kurt plans to use the music from practice in front of the team. At the beginning of practice, Ken tells the guys their winless team needs a new kicker. Kurt fires up ""Single Ladies"" and begins with a few moves from the routine. Just as the football players start to laugh, he drills it through the uprights. The team has a new kicker.

The TV station manager visits Sue at school. He warns her that her segment is dependent upon the Cheerios winning nationals

Quinn (Dianna Agron) tells Finn she is pregnant. She says it is his, though the two have never had sex. Finn's premature ejaculation issue manifested itself in a hot tub a few weeks back and Quinn is claiming the sperm made its way through the water despite both of them having their bathing suits on.

Sue visits Sandy (Stephen Tobolowsky) at his home. She has dirt on Figgins (Iqbal Theba), an old commercial he did for anti-embolism stockings and has used the leverage to get Sandy hired as the new arts administrator. This means Sandy will oversee Glee and be in charge of musicals.

Sue has Sandy give Rachel the lead in the school's performance of ""Cabaret."" Will is furious Sandy has stolen his best singer.

Will tells Rachel the reason he gave the solo to Tina is that he wants to strengthen the confidence of the rest of Glee in anticipation of regionals. She's upset he is hurting her to make others look good.

Tina practices ""Tonight"" from West Side Story. She is clearly not at Rachel's level, and tells Will he should give the solo to Rachel. Finn walks over and begins to cry in Will's arms.

Will takes Finn out to lunch. Finn is worried guys who have children at a young age end up with no future. He needs a football scholarship and the only way that will happen is if the team gets better. Finn wants Will to work with the team on dance in an effort to loosen the players up.

That night Will tells Terri about Quinn's pregnancy. Terri seems very interested.

Will and Ken try to convince the football team they need a better attitude. If they can sing and dance in front of people, Will argues, the game will be easy. Puck (Mark Salling) is particularly opposed to the idea, but Ken thinks they have nothing to lose.

Kurt teaches the team the moves from ""Single Ladies."" After practice, Finn tells Puck about Quinn being pregnant. Puck immediately goes to Quinn and we learn it is Puck, and not Finn, who is the father. Quinn got drunk on wine coolers one night and the two had a one-night stand.

Quinn flees to her car in tears. There she finds Terri waiting for her. Terri starts asking her about the pregnancy, offering Quinn some prenatal vitamins. ""What do you want from me?"" Quinn asks her.

The football game begins and the guys are too nervous to do the dance. Kurt's father arrives in the stands. The other team is knocking Finn all over the field and McKinley trails 6-0. Finn calls timeout with one second left in the game. Puck finally gets on board and they perform a lengthy ""Single Ladies"" routine at the line of scrimmage. Finn snaps the ball and finds Puck wide open for a touchdown. Kurt nails the extra point and is carried off the field as a conquering hero.Burt couldnt be more fired-up.

Back at home Kurt confesses to his father he is gay. ""I've known since you were three,"" Burt says. ""All you wanted for your birthday was a pair of sensible heels."" Burt accepts him and says he loves his son just the same.

Finn gives Quinn a baby blanket his father gave him. Puck walks by and makes a few comments which seem to indicate he wants Quinn to tell Finn the truth.

Three football players (including Puck) join Glee. They work on ""Tonight,"" and Will still has Tina on the solo. This prompts Rachel to quit."

The kids tell Will (Matthew Morrison) they're worried they won't be able to succeed at upcoming competitions without Rachel (Lea Michele). Finn (Cory Monteith) tells Will he's not going to tell his family about Quinn (Dianna Agron) being pregnant.

While at dinner with Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), Will meets a 24-year old still competing in a nearby high school's glee club.

Will told Emma (Jayma Mays) about Quinn's pregnancy. Without revealing her knowledge of Quinn's situation, Emma takes a special in interest in Finn's future and suggests he try for a music scholarship. Performing well in the sectional and regional competitions may help drum up college interest, she tells him, and she suggests trying to bring Rachel back to Glee.

Finn finds Rachel working on publicity for the musical. He flirts openly with her and offers to help her run lines.

Will has Emma look up the file of April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), a classmate of his who was the biggest star of the McKinley High Glee Club and Will's first crush. He sees on her transcripts she came several credits shy of graduating.

Will finds April online, and she has him meet her at a luxury home. After pretending the mansion in hers, April is outed by a real estate agent as a squatter. Outside April tells Will she went to New York with her high school sweetheart and never ended up making it big. She agrees to come back to McKinley, take a few courses to graduate and join Glee again.

The Glee kids aren't convinced April can be as good as Rachel. To prove her skills, April performs ""Maybe This Time,"" with Rachel joining in towards the end from the auditorium. April's so good, Kurt (Chris Colfer) cries.

Still, Will doesn't think the kids in Glee have accepted April socially. He suggests she try and win them over. This involves April introducing Kurt to booze, teaching Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) how to shoplift and flirting mercilessly (and showering) with the football guys.

Sandy (Stephen Tobolowsky) isn't happy with Rachel's work in Cabaret, primarily because he wants to install himself in.

Finn works with Rachel on her lines. He suggests they go bowling together to relieve some stress. Rachel and Finn are shocked when Will comes in to teach April ""Don't Stop Believing,"" which had been Rachel's song.

A drunken Kurt throws up on Emma in the hallway. After several decontamination showers, Emma tells Will that April is a bad influence.

After Sandy yells at Rachel once again, she runs to the bathroom to cry. There she bumps into April, and the two have an argument. April promises Rachel she is never going to relinquish her renewed role as school star.

Finn and Rachel are at the bowling alley, as are Will and April. Will expresses his concern April is a poor influence, and she tells him she will go back on the wagon. He then confesses his dream was for them to perform together. They do a quick duet of Heart's ""Alone."" Finn tells Rachel everybody misses her in Glee. They eventually end up kissing, and he convinces her to quit the musical and return to Glee.

Puck (Mark Salling) tells everyone in Glee that Quinn's strange behavior (puking, etc.) is the result of a ""bun in the oven"" and Finn is the father (even though Puck is). Just then Rachel walks in to rejoin Glee. Kurt tells her about Finn and Quinn's pregnancy, and Rachel is stunned.

After bringing Emma an application for a music scholarship, Finn is confronted by Rachel in the hallway with a satisfying slap. She is upset he didn't tell her about Quinn and says now she will never return to Glee. Sue (Jane Lynch) gives Rachel complete creative control over Cabaret.

April shows up drunk for the Invitational performance. Emma thinks Will shouldn't let her go on. He decides yanking her would only be punishing the other kids. Glee goes on, with April doing a rousing rendition of Carrie Underwood's ""Last Name."" Rachel watches from the back, obviously upset.

After the first number, Will tells April he can't let her go back on stage. April agrees, telling Will the kids are lucky they have him to prevent their lives from turning out the way hers did. Needing a new lead, Rachel steps in -- sucking up her pride to be the ""understudy"" and helps Glee knock ""Somebody to Love"" out of the park in the second act."

He tells Emma (Jayma Mays) it started when they received a particularly easy sectional draw. Sue (Jane Lynch) overhears Will's concern and thinks he needs to kick-start their competitive spirit. Will decides to have the boys face the girls in a mash-up competition. The winner gets to chose the number for sectionals. Will tells them there will be a surprise celebrity judge. Finn (Cory Monteith) tells Will he's worn-out.

We get a voice-over of Sue writing in her journal. She mentions a recent ""disaster"" in which Quinn's knee slightly buckled during a pyramid. That kind of screw-up could cost the Cheerios their national title, Sue thinks. When she asks Quinn (Dianna Agron) what's wrong, Quinn blames it on Glee. Sue decides she must bring down Will.

Sue has a conversation with Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) about Will's relationship with Emma. She implies Terri must intervene to prevent an affair. This leads Terri to try and get a job at the school.

Will tells Emma he wants her to judge the Glee-off. While he's talking to her about the competition, Terri walks in and tells them she is the new school nurse.

Finn is having trouble staying awake at football and glee practice. He also can't seem to get Rachel (Lea Michele) out of his mind. Puck (Mark Salling) suggests he see the nurse about his exhaustion.

The girls are super-confident they will beat the boys and aren't interested in Rachel's suggestion they practice.

Finn tells Terri he's tired but can't seem to get any sleep. When he expresses ambivalence about girls, Terri tries to turn him towards Quinn. She gives him pseudoephedrine to stay awake. A wired Finn shows up to practice and gives the 'vitamins' to the rest of the guys.

The guys perform a combination of Bon Jovi's ""It's My Life"" and Usher's ""Confessions Part II."" Will thinks they did a great job and will be tough for the girls to beat.

Rachel extends an olive branch to Quinn, telling her pregnancy will eventually make her an outsider and she will need Glee more than ever.

Terri has Howard (Kent Avenido) buy lots more decongestant. Ken comes (Patrick Gallagher) in to her office and complains Emma and Will may be in love with each other. Terri confesses she's only there to keep an eye on Will and wants a way out of the job. Ken is in love with Emma, but admits she isn't interested in him physically. She tells Ken he should propose and gives him pseudoephedrine to boost his courage.

With the guys performing well, Rachel is still trying to get the girls to work harder. Kurt (Chris Colfer) walks in the room and tells them the guys took pills.

Rachel confronts Finn in the hallway about his chemical enhancement. Finn tells her he needs help given how much he has on his plate and talks trash that the guys are going to win.

Terri passes out pseudoephedrine to the Glee girls. Will tells Terri she is smothering him at school. Ken proposes to Emma in the teachers lounge. He promises to keep her ""clean of sadness and loneliness.""

After Rachel frantically introduces the girls' performance, they do a strong mash-up of Beyonce's ""Halo"" and Katrina & The Waves's ""Walking on Sunshine."" Will takes Emma into the hallway and asks about Ken's proposal. She asks Will if he thinks she has any other options.

Terri goes to Emma's office and tells her she has no chance with Will. Emma says Will deserves better than Terri. Terri advises her to marry Ken.

Quinn tells Terri she doesn't think she is ready to be a mother. Quinn is okay with giving Terri the baby, but doesn't want Will to find out. Terri turns Quinn down when Quinn asks for financial support during the pregnancy.

Emma asks Ken what it would mean if they got married. She doesn't want to change her name, move in with him, have a ceremony or tell anybody. Ken asks: ""Is that a yes?""

Rachel and Finn both feel guilty about taking the pills. They agree they should both disqualify their teams.

Will is furious to learn Terri gave his kids pills. Figgins (Iqbal Theba) forces Terri to resign and makes Will take on Sue as a co-director.

Emma tells Will she accepted Ken's proposal."

Via voiceovers we learn the origin of this ""throwdown"" came several days ago when the two co-directors had a meeting in Figgins' office.

They report to Figgins (Iqbal Theba) the new arrangement at the top of Glee couldn't be going better. In updates to Figgins we learn that some members of Glee are upset Will isn't selecting more modern, urban music. The Cheerios report this to Sue, who sees this as an opportunity to split the club. Will and Sue are each going to direct a song for the upcoming sectional competition. When Figgins makes them ""hug out"" the meeting, we see they still can't stand each other.

Quinn (Dianna Agron) has an ultrasound and learns she is having a girl. Quinn is still planning to give the child up for adoption, and Finn (Cory Monteith) is upset he has no real control over a stressful situation.

When Jacob threatens to run a blog post about Quinn being pregnant, Rachel (Lea Michele) offers to do she can to stop it.

Intending to paint Will as racially insensitive, Sue takes all of the minority members of Glee for her number.

Will tells Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) he's tired of not having any involvement in their unborn son. He demands to be taken to the next OB appointment.

Rachel tells Finn about protecting him and Quinn. She had to give Jacob a pair of underpants, and Jacob wants a pair without a price tag on it.

Sue lets her half sing Jill Scott's ""Hate on Me.""

After the rehearsal, Will confronts Sue in the hallway about sabotaging (removing the piano, destroying sheet music) his practices. Sue confesses she is trying to destroy him and Glee.

At home Terri suggests Will get nasty in his battle with Sue.

The next day Sue learns most of her Cheerios are now academically ineligible after flunking Will's Spanish class.

In another meeting with Figgins, we learn the Cheerios are all terrible students and should have been failing Spanish for years. Figgins sides with Will.

Finn suggests a name (Drizzle) for the baby. Quinn thinks it's insensitive he is even talking about naming a child they will give up. He says he wishes she were more like Rachel. She warns him not to cheat on her with Rachel.

The entire club gets together on the sly and sings some Nelly. During Will's time he gives them their new song: Rachel and Finn will be doing a duet of ""No Air."" Previously coached by Sue, Quinn complains the rest of their half is relegated to back-up duty in the number. This causes all but three singers to leave Will's number and move to Sue's.

Will tells Terri he has made an appointment for that Friday with her obstetrician, Dr. Wu.

Sue tells Will she will give him back his singers if he passes her Cheerios. He says no.

Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) and Terri threaten Dr. Wu with a frivolous lawsuit if he doesn't help Terri fake her upcoming appointment.

Quinn tells Rachel to stay away from Finn. Rachel confronts Quinn about working on the side for Sue and warns her Sue won't be there once her pregnancy is revealed. This leads into Quinn and the Cheerios performing ""You Keep Me Hangin' On""

Rachel, Finn and Quinn rehearse in front of Sue and the rest of Glee. When Sue starts to walk out, Will and Sue have the ""throwdown"" we saw at the show's opening. The result is all of the kids walk out of the room.

At the fake ultrasound Wu pretends Will and Terri are actually having a girl. Will gets emotional seeing images of his child. Terri pulls Will in for a kiss: ""No matter what happens,"" she says. ""I want you to remember at this moment that we love each other.""

Sue agrees to give control of Glee back to Will.

Will tells Glee they are all minorities of some kind. Sue walks in and spills the beans that Quinn is pregnant.

Sue forced Jacob to go public with the story after finding Rachel's underwear in his locker. Quinn is beside herself.

The entire Glee performs Avril Lavigne's ""Keep Holding On."""

Apparently Finn and Quinn (Dianna Agron) are no longer cool.

Ken (Patrick Gallagher) and Emma (Jayma Mays) ask Will to help them with the first dance song at their wedding. Emma wants ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" and Ken wants ""The Thong Song."" They ask Will to make a mash-up up of the songs and teach Emma how to dance.

Will wants the Glee kids to work on a mash-up using ""Bust A Move."" None of the men are interested in singing it as a solo, so Will fires off a version himself.

Finn and Quinn ask Emma for advice on how to be cool again. Emma accidentally suggests sunglasses, but ultimately tells them to be themselves.

Will does a solo version of ""The Thong Song"" with Emma while she is wearing her wedding dress. He ends up slipping on her train and pulling her on top of him. Ken sees this and looks pissed.

The next day at football practice Finn's teammates are ripping him for his Glee involvement. Ken steps in and says he is tired of the guys acting like individuals. He adds an extra, mandatory practice at the same time as Glee's practice. Finn will have to choose.

Puck (Mark Salling) and Rachel (Lea Michele) are working on a song at her place. During a break they start making out. It turns out Puck's mother made him feel guilty about not finding a good Jewish girl and he went after Rachel. When Rachel starts picturing Finn during their make-out session, she tells Puck the reason she won't go any further is she needs a man brave enough to perform a solo.

The next day at Glee practice Puck performs a solo of ""Sweet Caroline"" Every girl (including Rachel) starts to swoon.

Despite wearing shades, Finn and Quinn are doused with slushie by several football players. They tell Finn it will be worse if he chooses Glee over football.

Sue (Jane Lynch) is starting a relationship with Rod (Bill A. Jones), the anchor at the station she works on. She asks Will to help her learn a few dance moves because she is really into Rod after one date and he has invited her to a swing dance-athon. Sue lets slip Ken is making the football players choose.

Will confronts Ken about the new practice. Ken admits being tired of Emma's interest in him. Will says he will start to discourage Emma, but Ken won't change his new practice time.

Hanging out publically with Rachel is killing Puck's coolness. He realizes how bad the not-cool kids feel, but says he is still going to choose football and essentially end their relationship.

Will goes with Emma as she picks out a train-less wedding dress. They dance to ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" and it gets pretty intense. Will takes off and mentions Ken's new decision may end Glee.

As the practice time approaches, the Glee kids wait to see if any football players will chose them over football. All the football players other than Finn pick Glee.

The next day Finn debates throwing a slushie on Kurt (Chris Colfer). Though his teammates will beat him up if he doesn't do it, Finn is torn. Eventually Kurt slushies himself and asks Finn if he thinks a football player would do that for him.

Sue shows up at the station and sees Rod kissing another woman. He will never be exclusive and a hurt Sue storms off.

Rachel and Puck watch football practice. Rachel says the relationship isn't going to work. They admit to each other they are interested in Finn and Quinn, but know the couple will never break up with her pregnant.

Finn tells Will he isn't coming back to Glee. Will tells him life is a series of choices that ""create who you are"" and thinks Finn is letting other people make his decisions. Will tells Finn that Glee is where he belongs.

Finn goes to Ken and tells him picking between football and Glee is making it tough for him to lead the team. He doesn't want to have to choose anymore. Ken tells him the new practice is now cancelled indefinitely and has him tell the rest of football/Glee guys.

The formerly friendly Sue is now being militant with Will and Glee. She also kicks Quinn off Cheerios.

Will tells Emma he simply can't get the two songs together for her wedding mash-up. They agree it is because the songs just don't go together. She thanks him for the lessons and he walks out.

Finn brings slushies to the Glee kids as an apology for being gone. Non-Cheerio Quinn thinks she will start everyday with a slushie facial, but Will assures her the Glee kids will be there to clean her off."

The two of them talk about the financial difficulties with pregnancy and Quinn rips Finn for not being man enough to find a job and help her raise ""their"" baby.

Jacob (Josh Sussman) interviews Sue (Jane Lynch) about the Cheerios being a lesser squad without Quinn.

Figgins (Iqbal Theba) tells Will (Matthew Morrison) there isn't enough budget money for Glee to have the special bus required to take Artie (Kevin McHale) and his chair to sectionals.

Before practice Puck (Mark Salling) overhears Quinn getting on Finn about the need for them to take care of doctor bills before her parents find out she's having ""his"" child. Since judges in the past have gone for standards, Will tells the guys they will be doing ""Defying Gravity"" at sectionals. Because of the bus issue Will suggests a bake sale to raise money. Nobody seems interested. After everyone leaves left Artie tells Will ""they dont get it.""

Wheeling through the halls Artie performs a rendition of ""Dancing With Myself,"" illustrating how apart he feels from the rest of the students.

Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks to audition for the ""Defying Gravity"" solo (a female part) and is told no. Artie admits no one caring about his riding with the rest of the them hurt his feelings. Will says they will go to sectionals as a team or not at all. They will be having a bake sale after all. Will brings in a bunch of wheelchairs: For the next week everyone in Glee will spend three hours a day in the chair and they will be performing a wheelchair number.

Puck gives Quinn some cash ($18) for their kid. She gives it back, saying she will go to her grave swearing it is Finn's baby. They proceed to have a playful food fight and Finn walks in just before they were about to kiss.

Kurt tells his dad (Mike O'Malley) he's upset at not getting a chance at ""Defying Gravity,"" one of his personal favorite songs.

Kurt's dad goes to Principal Figgins and claims his son is being discriminated against. Will tells an angry Rachel (Lea Michele) he is going to let Kurt tryout and the rest of Glee will be judging.

Will asks Figgins to put handicap ramps in the school. Figgins demands Sue hold open tryouts for Quinn's spot and appoints Will to make sure said tryouts are open to the entire school.

No one will buy any baked goods from the Glee kids. Cheerio Brittany (Heather Elizabeth Morris) brings over one of her friends, a student with Down's syndrome named Becky (Lauren Potter), to buy something. Quinn makes yet another crack about Finn getting a job and he kicks over a chair.

A reluctant Sue holds tryouts for the open Cheerios spot. After a number of lousy auditions, Becky shows up and jumps rope - poorly. Sue puts her on the team and Will is immediately suspicious.

Puck tells Finn he needs to do more to take care of the baby and calls him ""a punk who doesn't deserve to have Quinn as his girlfriend."" The two get into a pretty serious fist fight.

Artie is teaching the rest of the Glee members how to move in the chair. Artie tells Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) (on whom he has a crush) that a car accident put him in the chair. He compares her stutter to his being in a wheelchair.

Someone calls Kurt's father and says ""your son's a fag."" When Kurt comes to tell him he was able to hit the high note in the solo, his father seems a little concerned about Kurt's safety and says he wishes Kurt's mother was alive.

Just after Finn tells Rachel he likes her, Quinn storms in and tells him if he doesn't help her with her latest bill they are through. Rachel looks down at the wheelchairs and seems to have an idea.

All of a sudden the bake sale is going like gangbusters. We get a flashback to Puck getting medical marijuana from Sandy (Stephen Tobolowsky) which he put in the cupcakes.

Sue is pushing Becky hard at practice. Will comes in and thinks Sue is being too hard on Becky. Sue points out Will is asking her to treat Becky differently because she has a disability.

We cut back and forth between Kurt and Rachel's performances in the ""Diva Off."" Both seem exceptionally strong, but Kurt eventually doesn't hit the high note.

Puck tries to give Quinn some cash from the cupcake fund. He explains he's not really a screw-up and could be a good father. She won't take the money, but apologizes for calling him a loser earlier. Finn comes up and tells Quinn he's finally gotten a job. Based on Rachel's suggestion, he used his wheelchair to get hired. Quinn jumps in Finn's lap and they leave Puck standing there jilted.

Puck gives Will the bake sale cash, which is enough for the special bus. Artie says he would rather use the money to help build a handicap ramp and ride to sectionals with his dad.

Principal Figgins tells Will that Sue wrote him a check for three new handicaps ramps. Will isn't sure what her angle might be.

We cut to Sue going to a facility. She is visiting her older sister Jean (Robin Trocki), who also happens to have Down syndrome.

Artie and Tina have a wheelchair date which ends with her getting up and giving him a kiss. She admits to having been faking her stutter since sixth grade to compensate for being shy. Artie is upset that what he thought they had in common doesn't exist.

Kurt visits his dad at work and tells him Rachel got the part. He admits to blowing the song on purpose because he didn't think his dad could handle his being in the limelight: ""I love you more than I love being a star,"" Kurt tells him.

The Glee performs a rousing rendition of ""Proud Mary"" in their wheelchairs."

While trying on her dress for the Chastity Ball, Quinn's mother (Charlotte Ross) notices it's no longer fitting her. Quinn's father (Gregg Henry) pops into the room and tells Quinn (Dianna Agron) he wants to have Finn (Cory Monteith) over for dinner.

Rachel soon brings Will a gift, which sets off further alarm bells in his head that he may have a(nother) student who has a crush on him.

Worried, Will tells Emma (Jayma Mays) the story of Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), a student from two years earlier who fell hard for Will. She also gave him a novelty gift and ended up calling his home in the middle of the night. When Will finally was honest with Suzy, she ended up eating a super-hot chili pepper and having to be taken to the hospital. Emma suggests Will let Rachel down easy with a song.

Finn has been paired with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and is having trouble singing, given all the things on his mind. He is bothered his daughter may never know who he is. Kurt, who still has a thing for Finn, suggests Finn try to sing away all of his problems. Finn performs ""I'll Stand By You.""

Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) catches Finn singing to an ultrasound. He breaks down and tells her Quinn is pregnant.

Quinn is furious Finn told his mother and is worried it might come back to her parents. Via voiceover, Kurt tells us he is ""madly in love with Finn"" and is helping him so Finn will come crying to Kurt when Quinn inevitably blows him off.

With Emma in the room, Will attempts to tell Rachel how he feels about her, by singing a mash-up of ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" and ""Young Girl."" Instead of understanding Will's intentions for the song, Rachel thinks the song was an exercise to understand the meaning of the lyrics in the song. Looking for some 'hope,' Will asks Emma for her opinion, but the doe-eyed counselor can only mutter that he is a very good dancer.

Kurt helps Finn look through his dead father's nice clothes. With Kurt's mother having passed away as well, the two bond over losing a parent. Finn is worried about meeting Quinn's parents. Kurt suggests he sing to them.

Will returns home to find Rachel has made dinner. Realizing Rachel had a thing for her husband, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) allowed her to cook and clean their house.

Will drives Rachel home. On the way she tries to sing him ""Crush,"" but he cuts her off after a few bars. She tells him she's not interested in high school boys and has her ""sights set much higher.""

Suzy corners Rachel in the hall and tells her to stay away from Will.

When Mercedes (Amber Riley) tells Puck the club wants to sing a ballad to Finn and Quinn, he blurts out he is actually the father of her baby. Mercedes tell him it doesn't matter. Quinn has made her choice and he owes her staying out of the picture.

At dinner, Finn begins to get nervous when Quinn's father makes a toast. He excuses himself and calls Kurt for help. He heads back out and sings ""Having my Baby"" to the whole family. Quinn's parents sit Finn and Quinn down. Quinn's father is so disappointed he kicks her out of house. Quinn is upset her mother must have known that she was knocked up, but did nothing out of fear of what Quinn's father would say.

Finn brings Quinn home and his mother says she can stay with them as long as she needs to.

Suzy tells Rachel after two years of psychotherapy she's learned girls like them select crushes who will never like them back in order to re-affirm their low self esteem.

Rachel tells Will she knows they will never be more than teacher-student. She brings flowers as an apology and was going to sing ""Sorry."" Will assures her someday a boy will come along who will like her for who she is.

Finn tells Kurt he thinks it's good everything with Quinn and her parents is out in the open. Kurt tells Finn his song was going to be ""I honestly Love You.""

The Glee kids sit Finn and Quinn down and sing ""Lean On Me"" in order to show them how they feel. During the song Puck and Quinn glance knowingly at one another."

Sue approaches Will, demanding to know the glee club's set list for sectionals. He is surprised. ""I didn't know you were all that interested in glee club anymore,"" Will says. Not so. He grudgingly agrees to hand over the list. And it only gets worse. Later, Sue wants names of competing schools and zip codes. All of this leads Will to a shocking conclusion. ""She's leaking our competitive set lists to other schools!"" he complains to Emma, who suggests going directly to the competing schools to find out.

Cut to Will going through heavy security to meet Grace Hitchens, an administrator and glee-club coach at competing Jane Adams High School. ""I think our cheerleading coach is passing along our set list for sectionals,"" Will says. Hitchens denies resorting to cheating in order to beat a bunch of ""privileged misfits."" Feeling guilty, Will invites her team to use the McKinley auditorium, as Jane Adams doesn't have one. Cut to the Jane Adams glee club singing and dancing on the McKinley stage. The theme of the number: bootylicious. Sample lyric: ""I hope you can handle all the jelly that I have."" Will is both perplexed and impressed. ""It's called hairography,"" says Rachel, explaining the eye-catching hairstyles mask what is otherwise a mediocre performance. Will doesn't seem convinced. In fact, the performance has given him an idea. ""I think I found our new number for sectionals,"" he tells the club later. ""We're going to do the title song from 'Hair.'"" Will also brought wigs. Rachel sighs.

Meanwhile, pregnant Quinn continues to pretend the father of her unborn baby is Finn. Oddly, Puck, the read dad, is acting quite supportive of his baby mama. ""Maybe I didn't give Puck enough of a chance,"" Quinn thinks to herself. But how to throw Finn off the scent so she can give Puck a ""test drive?"" Easy. Quinn approaches Kurt with an idea to give Rachel a makeover. Quinn's hope is that Finn will be distracted by Rachel, although Kurt doesn't know that part of the scheme. He agrees to take the case, noting that makeovers are like ""crack"" to him. And so it begins. Kurt explains that his goal is to make Rachel the most desired girl in school. She, however, confesses to only having eyes for one boy. ""I'm in love with Finn,"" Rachel says. Retorts Kurt: ""Really? I understand completely."" He then decides that she must look like a ""ho,"" as Finn goes for women of questionable morals. Clearly, Kurt is sabotaging his own makeover out of jealousy. Quinn will not be pleased.

Terri, in the meantime, attempts to distract her husband from the faux pregnancy by giving him a replica of his old car from high school. ""I thought maybe working on it would be a distraction from all the pressure you're under,"" she says. Just then, Quinn appears and pulls Terri aside. ""I'm keeping my baby,"" the former cheerleader says. Terri is SHOCKED. Kendra has a plan, though. She'll hire Quinn to babysit her misbehaving children. ""Five minutes with those mongrels and she'll have her tubes tied,"" Kendra explains.

Later, Rachel appears in the hallways with her new, sultry look. Finn immediately takes notice and agrees to go over to Rachel's house on Friday. Quinn, meanwhile, asks Puck to hang out with her while babysitting. The plan appears to be working perfectly. Cut to the glee club practice, where Will confronts Sue. Shockingly, Sue calls him out for pulling the hairography ploy, explaining that her Cheerios wear their hair pulled back so as not to ""distract from their talent."" She promises to bar any ""demeaning, fruity, hair tossing.""

Friday night arrives. Rachel suggests she and Finn reenact a sexy scene from ""Grease."" A few bars later, Finn stops the charade. ""You look like a sad, clown hooker,"" he tells a hurt Rachel. ""This look just isn't you."" Finn then explains that he was just telling Kurt last week that he likes natural girls -- and NOT skin-tight clothes. Cut to Kendras house, where Quinn and Puck babysit the rowdy, awful children. They are only quieted when Puck and Quinn perform an acoustic version of ""Papa Don't Preach."" Because little boys love ""Papa Don't Preach."" Of course, Kendra and Terri are SHOCKED to find the boys so well behaved. ""Are you an exorcist?"" Kendra asks.

On Monday, Rachel confronts Kurt for setting her up. ""You like him and you were just trying to eliminate the competition,"" Rachel yells. Says a teary-eyed Kurt: ""There's no hope for either of us. He loves Quinn. They're having a baby together. We're nothing but distractions."" It's a sad, but likely true moment. Quinn, in the meantime, is also getting bad news. Turns out Puck was ""sexting"" with another girl while they were babysitting. Ouch. But enough drama for the time being. It's time to dance. Cut to glee-club practice, where the gang perfects the science of hairography set to a ""Crazy In Love""/ ""Hair"" mash-up. The audience isn't so impressed. ""It didn't work at all, did it?"" Rachel asks. Will admits the performance was a little ""rough."" The club sits down to listen to the glee club from Haverbrook, a school for the deaf. They perform ""Imagine"" without any hairography. The performance inspires and puts the McKinley kids in their place.

Later, Quinn confronts Puck about sexting. He admits to the deed. ""You haven't given it up to me since the night I knocked you up,"" he says. ""I have needs."" Cut immediately to Quinn telling Terri that she can have the baby, after all. ""A girl really needs a good father and the only way she's going to get that is if I give her to you,"" Quinn says through tears. Will then enters with news: he traded in the hot rod for a family-friendly mini van. ""I don't want anything to distract me from you guys,"" he says. Terri is touched (we think). He WILL be a good dad.

Quinn, meanwhile, heads straight for Finn. The two confess their love for each other, leaving Rachel and Kurt standing in the hallway looking like hurt puppies. Cut to Sue's office, where Will has decided to apologize. ""I thought the kids needed a little showbiz and I was wrong,"" he tells his arch nemesis. He then hands over his set list for sectionals. The new plan: no false theatricality. The glee club will sit in stools and get by on pure talent.

All's well that ends well, right?

Not quite. We cut back to Sue's office, where she is sharing the set list with the coaches from Jane Adams and Haverbrook. Turns out Will was right all along.

The episode ends with New Directions singing the newest addition to their set list: Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors."""

They tell him their wedding will be the following Saturday, on the same day as sectionals. Will is a little shocked at the this turn of events, until Sue walks in with a pair of black eyes, the result of having some work done prior to yearbook pictures. Will is excited that his kids will have something in the Yearbook that shows their club, but is surprised when Sue tells him that she convinced Figgins not to allow Glee to have a yearbook picture in this year's Thunderclap.

In the Glee room, Kurt explains to everyone that not having a yearbook picture may save from them countless hours of ridicule, which seems to be an agreement by everyone. However, just as they conclude their meeting, Will comes in claiming he is going to override Sue's decision and that the kids will have a Glee Club picture for sure (much to their silent 'horror').

When Will complains to Figgins, the principal tells him that this is for the best, as almost every previous Glee Club photo has been vandalized in the yearbooks. Will claims that this should not make a difference, and lobbies to still have the club acknowledged in a picture. Figgins tells him that his only option is to buy a quarter-page ad for Glee for $325. That will be room enough for two members, of which Figgins suggests he pick Finn and Brittany, since they are least likely to have their faces vandalized. Just as Will is about to leave, Rachel barges into the office demanding Glee have a picture, before Will tells her the news.

In a monologue, Rachel explains to the viewers that she has joined every club possible in order to get her picture in the yearbook dozens of times. Unlike her other clubs however, Rachel is particularly proud of Glee.

In a monologue of her own, Quinn tells of how sad it is that she's no longer in the Cheerios, and vows to find a way to get into the squad picture for this year.

Back at home, Will tries to convince Terri to let him use the $325 of their own money for the picture, to which she refuses. Will writes Figgins a check anyway, but asks him to wait a few days before cashing it.

Will then tells Glee they must pick two team captains for the photo. Every single vote is for Rachel (including Rachel's), with nobody wanting to be in the photo with her.

Will asks Emma how to find another kid to be in the picture. She apologizes for having to miss sectionals, and Will thinks Ken scheduled the wedding conflict on purpose. Emma defends Ken and Will ends up apologizing.

Will then asks Rachel to pick a co-captain. Everyone she contacts comes up with bogus excuses. Eventually, she's able to convince Finn to do the picture with her. Rachel says she is going to teach Finn how to smile correctly via them singing a duo of Lily Allen's ""Smile.""

Several of Finn's football teammates tell him they are already planning to deface his Glee picture, causing him distress about posing with Rachel.

Finn ends up bailing on Rachel at the photo shoot, and Rachel ends up having the picture taken just of herself. When she claims she has multiple poses she wishes to try, the photographer claims he does not have the time, and that he has to work on an upcoming commercial for a friend. In order to get her way, Rachel volunteers the Glee Club for the assignment, which is a commercial to sell mattresses for the store ""Mattress Land."" The news is met with excitement by the club, who see it as their first ""big break.""

The group goes down for the read-through, but note that the commercial seems rather mediocre. Rachel suggests that since they are a Glee Club, they should dance and sing. The store owner gives in to their idea, and the group puts on an entertaining show for the store's commercial, singing a mattress-hopping version of ""Jump"" by Van Halen.

While looking for his pocket square, Will finds one of Terri's old fake pregnancy bellies. Furious, he goes to the kitchen and demands she show him her belly. The discovery leads to a huge fight, with Terri explaining the origins of the lie and telling him about adopting Quinn's baby. Will is both angered and heartbroken at what his wife has told him. ""I loved you Terri,"" he says. ""I really loved you,"" before storming out of the apartment.

Taking refuge at the school in the Glee Club's office, Will is surprised to find a stack of new mattresses in the rehearsal room (payment for the Glee Club's services to ""Mattress Land"" from the store owner). Casually, Will takes one of the mattresses and rips off the plastic covering on it, before settling in for the night.

After filming her television spot for the local news, Sue spots the Glee kids' mattress commercial on TV. The next day, Quinn asks Sue to be in the cheerleader photo but is denied, with Sue claiming that the glee club is in big trouble.

Sue goes to Figgins and tells him the commercial compromised the Glee kids' amateur status. According to the Show Choir Rule Book, the Glee Club cannot accept payment for services. Will claims that they can just give the mattresses back, but this proves to not be possible, since Will opened the plastic covering on one and slept on it. With no way to get out of the acceptance of payment by mattresses, Figgins tells Will that ""Glee is over.""

Quinn shows up in Sue's office in her Cheerios uniform, claiming that her outfit still fits and that she still wants in on the Cheerios Yearbook photo. Sue once again denies Quinn's request, until Quinn reminds her of all the swag she's been giving the Cheerios over the years (the equivalent of accepting payment). Sue gives into Quinn's demand for a full page photo to be given to Glee Club (knocking the 6 pages the Cheerios would have down to 5 in the yearbook), but Sue insists that if Quinn still wants to be in the photos for the Cheerios, she'll be stuck in the back. Quinn is willing to live with the photo request, but refuses to be sidelined by Sue and leaves.

Will goes to Emma to talk about what Terri did. Emma tells Will he should focus on his own life. She says she understands why Terri did what she did, claiming that he is 'alot to lose.'

Will tells the Glee kids that in order to keep Figgins from disbanding the Glee Club due to the mattresses, he has claimed receipt of the mattresses as payment...therefore, he (Will) is technically the one disqualified and cannot join them at competition. Several of the kids feel that without Will, they won't be able to win. ""If you can't win with me there, then I haven't done my job,"" he tells them. He asks that they take their Glee photo with pride.

While getting ready for the picture, the Glee kids sing Michael Jackson's ""Smile."" Eventually, the group has their picture taken, while Will watches from outside the Glee Club's door, before walking away. The show then concludes with several of the football players mercilessly defacing the Glee Club photo in the Yearbook."

Rachel sings ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" which draws a standing ovation. They follow that with ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" which the crowd seems to love. Will is listening via Emma's cell phone; he is in tears (and so is she!)

Afterwards we see the judges conference. The mixed bag of three people seems up-the-air about who they liked best. Grace walks to the room to admit her team cheated. Before she can do that, the judges walk out and say they are finished deliberating.

Will runs into Teri at home while getting clothes for Emma's wedding. She says she's been seeing a therapist. He says his feelings for her are gone and leaves for the wedding.

Will goes to the wedding and finds Emma sitting all by herself. Ken has dumped her, saying moving the wedding for sectionals was the last straw. She admits that she moved the wedding for Will and not the kids. She says she emailed her resignation to Figgins. Will grabs her arm and tells her he just left his wife. She says she's sorry but still has to leave.

During a meeting Figgins confronts Sue about giving up the set list. Figgins tells her she is no longer the Cheerios' coach and is suspended from the school. Will is reinstated as Glee club coach.

In the hall Sue tells Will she's going to spend some time at her condo in Boca and then return to crush Glee (describing her building wrath as ""the Sue Sylvester express. Destination: HORROR!"").

After Rachel asks him to be honest in their relationship, Finn tells her he doesn't think they should date anymore. Later at practice Rachel spies Finn flirting with Brittany and Santana. Rachel then performs ""Gives You Hell"" by the All American Rejects. After pointing out this song didn't qualify for his assignment, Will details just how strong the best team at regionals, Vocal Adrenaline, has been the past few years.

At a music store Rachel runs into Vocal Adrenaline's uber-confident senior star Jesse St. James. He almost instantly sweeps her off her feet and the two perform a duet of Lionel Ritchie's ""Hello."" He asks her out on a date.

During their date with Finn, Brittany and Santana basically treat him like dirt.

Finn tries to get back with Rachel but she tells him about Jesse. Finn thinks the timing of Jesse's interest is a little suspect and eventually goes to Will with the news

Sue is furious with Santana and Brittany not being able to hold Finn's interest. They tell her about Rachel's relationship with Jesse.

We see Jesse and Vocal Adrenaline rehearsing AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell."" Will walks in to speak with the group's coach, Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), about Jesse and Rachel. She doesn't seem concerned with the relationship or Will's students. This quickly leads to the two making out over at his place. Shelby admits to knowing of Will and they compare stories of working with glee clubs. Will tells her about his separation and new relationship with Emma. Shelby suggests he call her when he's figured his life out a little bit.

The kids in Glee give Rachel an ultimatum: Dump Jesse or be replaced. They are convinced he is using her and they don't' want to risk their chances at regionals.

Sue brings Rachel to a room filled with single women: ""The McKinley High Old Maids Club,"" as she calls them. Basically the women tell stories about the dangers of giving up on a possible catch like Jesse.

While Emma prepares a surprise dinner for Will, Terri stops by to pick up a few of her things. The conversation turns nasty and Terri tells Emma that ""Hello Again"" was their prom song.

Rachel goes to Jesse's school in order to find out whether his feelings are legitimate. He assures Rachel he would never hurt her. She is happy and says their relationship must be a secret. The two start making out. While kissing Rachel, Jesse looks over her shoulder and makes eye contact with Shelby, who is watching.

Emma tells Will about Terri and the song. She takes this to mean subconsciously he still isn't over Terri and should spend some time alone. Emma hints that she will be waiting for him once he gets his life together.

Finn tells Rachel he thinks they should be together. Rachel says no, using the excuse that it would be distracting for the team so close to regionals. He says he won't give up easily.

Feeling empowered by Madge, Sue then goes to Figgins with several demads: She wants to play Madonna over the PA all day long and eventually find a group of students to ship off to New York City much the way Madonna did to start her career (naturally, her choices are the entire Glee Club).

Sue tells her Cheerios that she wants them to be as much like Madonna as possible: younger men, only going by first names, etc.

Rachel tells the team Jesse recently asked her to go all the way. She said no and he got ""crabby."" Other girls tell her that guys have been treating them poorly recently. Rachel tried to dicuss the issue with Emma but the counselor wasn't much help.

We see Kurt and Mercedes' black and white video of Madonna's ""Vogue,"" with Sue as Madonna.

Next we have a montage of the three potential virginity-ending Friday nights -- Rache/Jesse, Finn/Santana and Will/Emma -- fooling around to a soundtrack of ""Like a Virgin."" We don't see whether any of them complete the act.

Despite the ideas presented to her in the video, Sue has gone back to her original look. Based in part of compliments from Figgins, Sue believes she is an original.

Finn asks Rachel about her date with Jesse. Rachel said having sex was no big deal, but we see via flashback that she didn't actually go through with it. Finn tells Rachel that he didn't have sex with Santana, but we see that he did it but felt guilty about it afterwards.
