Walt supplements his low teaching salary by working part-time at a local car wash, where he ends up being humiliated in front of two of the students he teaches. On his 50th birthday, Walt returns home to a surprise party arranged by Skyler (Anna Gunn). The following day, he collapses at the car wash and is raced to the hospital, where he is told that he has developed inoperable lung cancer and has, at best, two years to live. Walt opts to keep this news from his family and from Skyler's sister Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt) and her husband Hank (Dean Norris), a DEA agent.

After returning to work at the car wash, Walt suddenly lashes out at his boss and walks off the job. Having earlier seen a news report showing a large amount of money recovered from one of Hank's drug busts, Walt takes up a previous offer to go on a ride-along as Hank and his partner Steven Gomez (Steven Michael Quezada) raid a known Meth lab. As the DEA agents clear out the house, Walt observes his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) sneaking out a back window. Later, Walt tracks down Jesse's address and blackmails him into helping him produce crystal Meth without revealing why. Walt turns over his life savings to allow Jesse to purchase a Fleetwood Bounder RV to use as a mobile lab. Walt then steals supplies from the high school chemistry lab needed for the process.

Walt and Jesse drive the RV into the desert and begin to cook. Walt's expertise in chemistry enables them to create crystal Meth that Jesse claims is the purest he's ever seen. Jesse drives back into town to show a sample to his distributor, Krazy-8 Molina (Maximino Arciniega). He realizes too late that Krazy-8 is a cousin of Emilio Koyama, his partner that was busted on the earlier raid and now free on bail. Emilio believes Jesse abandoned him, but Jesse promises to prove his loyalty by driving them to the RV. When they meet Walt, Emilio recognizes him from the raid and thinks that he is an informant, leading him and Krazy-8 to hold the two at gunpoint. Jesse tries to run but trips and falls and hits his head on rock, knocking himself out. Walt barters for his life by offering to show them how he produced the Meth. As they watch Walt inside the RV, Emilio flicks away a cigarette outside, which causes a brush fire to ignite. Walt surprises Emilio and Krazy-8 by synthesizing deadly Phosphine gas, flees the RV, holds the door shut which causes Emilio and Krazy-8 to pass out.

Hearing sirens in the distance, Walt quickly dons a gas mask and puts one on Jesse before pulling him into the RV's passenger seat, still filled with Phosphine fumes. Walt frantically drives the RV away from the spreading brush fire. As shown in medias stories at the start of the episode, Walt drives the RV into a ditch and stumbles out of the vehicle, discarding his gas mask. Believing that he is about to be captured by the police, Walt records a video message to his family before trying to shoot himself with a pistol, unaware the safety is still on.

As the sirens near, Walt is relieved to find they are only fire engines responding to the fire, and quickly hides his weapon. Jesse wakes up and joins Walt as they watch the fire engines race by. The two have the RV extracted from the ditch by a Native American man with a front-end loader and then drive back into town, making sure Emilio and Krazy-8 are secured in the RV before leaving it at Jesse's home. Later that night, Walt returns home and meets his wife's troubled queries with a new sexual vigor, which leaves her asking, ""Walt, is that you?"""

Walt wants this to be his first and last Meth cook, and he promises to Jesse that they will go their separate ways. When they open the RV to remove the two bodies inside, they notice that Krazy-8 is still breathing. After parking the RV at Jesse's place, Walt had returned home (and had vigorous sex with his wife). Jesse calls him the next morning in a state of panic as Krazy-8 is still alive and locked up inside the RV. Walt promises to drop by after school, where he picks up bottles of Hydrofluoric acid. Meanwhile Krazy-8 escapes from the RV and is found by Walt on the streets, as he drives towards Jesse's home. Krazy-8 knocks himself out while trying to escape from Walt. Walt loads him into his car and drives towards Jesse's house

The unconscious Krazy-8 is taken into the basement and secured to a pole with a bike lock around his neck. Walt suggests that they should use Hydrofluoric acid to dissolve Emilio's corpse so that it leaves no evidence behind. Walt and Jesse must dispose of the corpse and kill Krazy-8, and toss a coin to see who will do which task. Jesse wins and chooses to dispose of the corpse, leaving Walt to kill Krazy-8.

Walt instructs Jesse to buy a bin made from polyethylene in which the corpse can be properly dissolved, but Jesse cannot find a bin big enough to accommodate the entire body. Walt is thinking about suffocating Krazy-8 but cannot bring himself to kill another human being. So, he ends up giving him water, food and bathroom supplies instead.

When Jesse returns home and asks how the murder went, Walt promises to take care of Krazy-8 the next day and leaves for home. Meanwhile, Skyler (Anna Gunn) begins to suspect that Walt is doing something in secret. Skyler uses an internet service to trace the address of the phone number which called Walt in the morning at breakfast. On Jess 's website she has learned that he is a drug dealer and a pimp for MILFs (she doesn't know what a MILF is).

Walter and Skyler go for an ultrasound together and find that they are having a girl. Skyler questions Walt as to who Jesse is as Walt was acting very weird during the phone call. Walt makes up a lie saying that Jesse sells him marijuana (due to his pain from the cancer). Skyler confronts Jesse at his home, while he is trying to dispose of Emilio (he was moving Emilio's body from the RV into the house), warning him that her brother-in-law is a DEA agent. Skyler doesn't even notice the corpse that was partially hidden behind Jesse's car.

Jesse does not find the specific plastic bin Walt instructed him to use, so he decides to dissolve the corpse in his bathtub. However, the ceramic and metal bathtub get dissolved by the Hydrofluoric acid along with the body and causes the ceiling beneath it to collapse, followed by Emilio's liquefied remains. Walt tells Jesse that Hydrofluoric acid will dissolve anything except plastic. Meanwhile, two Native American children play out in the desert and find Walt's gas mask."

In the meanwhile, Krazy-8 regains consciousness in the basement. While talking with Walt, Krazy-8 reveals that Jesse told him and Emilio about Walt's personal life. That Walter is a Chemistry teacher in school and has a retarded son. Krazy-8 tells Walter that Jesse is not a reliable partner and that he blabbed about Walter to him and his cousin (Emilio). Krazy-8 that either Walt lets him go or he would have to kill Krazy-8 in cold blood. Walt then confronts Jesse, in the middle of getting high off Meth. Walt tries to flush down the cooked Meth that it worth roughly $ 40,000, but Jesse saves it as Walt gets out of breath very quickly due to his lung cancer. Jesse berates him for not living up to his end of the bargain between the two and drives off.

Meanwhile, Skyler tells Marie that she is working on a new short story with a stoner character in it and she asks her about marijuana. Marie assumes that Skyler thinks Walt Jr. is smoking pot, but Skyler insists that she was just talking about her story. Marie asks Hank to scare Walt Jr. straight, leading him to bring Walt Jr. to a motel to show how Meth has corroded the teeth of a prostitute. Turns out Jesse was hiding in the room of the prostitute while she was being interrogated by Hank outside Jesse gets paranoid that the cops are already looking for him.

Meanwhile it is shown that Marie is a kleptomaniac as she steals a pair of stilettos from a high-end store.

Walt phones Skyler to apologize for being late, falsely claiming that he's working over at the car wash. Skyler informs Walt that she knows he quit his job there two weeks previously and angrily tells him to not come home.

Walt weighs the pros and cons of killing Krazy-8, then collapses on the basement floor while bringing him a sandwich, shattering the plate. After he regains consciousness, Walt tells Krazy-8 he has lung cancer. After engaging in conversation with Krazy-8, Walter seemingly forms a bond with him. Krazy-8 says that his real name is Domingo. Walt says that he is looking for any reason not to kill Krazy-8. Krazy-8 promises not to come after Walt, if he is set free. Krazy-8 grew up in town and has a business management degree. His father owns a furniture shop that Walt knows very well. Walt bought a bassinet there when his son was born. Walt decides to let him go free and shares a beer with him. Walt admits that he is cooking Meth as he wants to leave some money for his family before he dies. Walt goes to get the key to the bike lock which is holding him captive.

However, when Walter throws the beer can in the trash, he observes the broken pieces of the plate. He realizes that there is a shard missing from the broken plate. He reluctantly garrotes Krazy-8 with the bike lock while he stabs backward into Walt's leg with the broken plate. Walt goes back home to find Skyler sitting on the bed, crying. He says he has something to tell her.

Meanwhile, Hank and several DEA agents discover the cook site in the desert along with Krazy-8's car. Inside the car they find the small bag of crystal Meth cooked by Walt. The family of Native Americans shares the lab mask the young girl found in the previous episode. It is revealed that Krazy-8 was working for Hank undercover."

Hank also reports on their discovery of 99.15% pure methamphetamine. Such purity has never been achieved before. Although the DEA had no leads, Hank believes the product is good enough to make someone Albuquerque's new Meth kingpin (unaware that it is Walt). Meanwhile, Walt tells Hank, Marie, and Walt Jr. about his cancer; Skyler has already been told. Walt reveals that he has cancer at a family barbecue & uses that as an excuse with Skyler for his strange behavior. Marie arranges an appointment with the best oncologist in the country. But the family needs money for the treatment and Walter is against borrowing it from Hank or his mother. Jesse smokes Walt's Meth with two friends and flees his house the next morning when he hallucinates that two religious evangelists at his door are armed bikers.

Marie makes an appointment with one of the top oncologists in the country, even though the family can't afford him. Walt says he will take the money out from his pension, but he actually uses some of the money taken from Krazy-8 who offered him in the desert, which he keeps hidden in an air-conditioning duct at his house. Walt Jr. berates his father for acting so weird and nonchalant about his cancer. When Walt goes to his credit union to put the cash in a cashier's check, his parking spot is stolen by a rich, obnoxious man named Ken (Kyle Bornheimer). Ken annoys Walt and the rest of the customers with his loud cell phone conversation.

Jesse ends up fleeing to his affluent parents' house, where he sleeps for an entire day. He attempts to bond with his overachieving little brother, Jake (Benjamin Petry). That night, Jesse gets a call from one of the friends who smoked Walt's Meth, who says that he knows a lot of upper-class people looking to score drugs and are willing to pay top dollar for the high-quality Meth he cooked. The next day, Jesse visits Walt to ""touch base,"" but he kicks Jesse out. Jesse then brusquely gives Walt his half of the Meth profit - $4,000. Jesse pays Walter his share of the money from the 1st batch and the partnership seems to be over. The oncologist tells Walt that the cancer has spread to his lymph nodes, but there is a chance it is still treatable with chemotherapy.

At home, Walt expresses his doubts about the chemo since it will cost $90,000 and if he still dies, he will leave his family with all the debt. Walt Jr. admonishes his dad, saying that he should just die if he's going to give up so easily. At the Pinkman residence, a housekeeper finds a joint in Jesse's room, resulting in his parents kicking him out. It turns out the joint belonged to Jake, who thanks Jesse for taking the fall for him. While Jesse is waiting out front for his ride after his parents kick him out for the marijuana, Jake comes out asking for his joint back, which Jesse throws on and stomps into the ground.

Walt suffers a coughing attack while driving and coughs up blood. As he pulls into a gas station, he notices Ken pull up. When Ken leaves his car unattended, an angry Walt takes a squeegee, pops open Ken's hood, and shorts the car battery with it. The engine subsequently overheats, and the car explodes as Walt walks back to his car. He then calmly drives away, leaving an exasperated Ken."

Years earlier, Walt and his then-girlfriend Gretchen (Jessica Hecht) had formed a company called Gray Matter Technologies with Elliott-the company name derived from mixing the colors in their last names, ""White"" and ""Schwartz"" (German for ""black"")-but Walt opted to sell off his share.

Subsequently, the company had flourished off Walt's innovations, and Elliott married Gretchen. Walt is tense at the birthday party due to this troubled past. But Elliot is nothing but nice to Walter and goes out of his way to make Walter feel comfortable. When Elliott offers him a job and tells him Gray Matter has excellent health insurance, Walt realizes that Skyler told Elliott about his cancer and gets upset with her for talking about his private affairs to people who are not in their lives anymore. Walt says that when he declined the job offer and Elliot flat out offered to pay for the treatment and Walter found that demeaning.

Jesse has a failed job interview. Jesse is only being considered for entry level job positions like being a human advertising board, despite him having education and a solid sales background. After the interview, Jesse meets his friend Badger outside the office. Badger wants some of the pure Meth that Jesse had, but Jesse says it's all gone now, and he had a falling out with his partner who actually cooked the Meth. Badgers says he can guarantee a major supply of Pseudo that is needed as a core ingredient of Meth.

Jesse shows his friend Badger (Matt L. Jones) the RV Walt and Jesse use as a Meth lab. Badger and Jesse decide to cook a batch on their own. In the desert, Jesse is frustrated he can't cook Meth as well as Walt (the end output is very cloudy, while it was clean as glass when Walter cooked it) and throws his own product away, much to Badger's disgust. Badger believes that the product was good enough to be sold. Jesse cooks a few more batches, which he also eventually throws away. Badger and Jesse brawl over the Meth, and Jesse pushes him out of the RV and drives away.

Over the weekend, Walt Jr. and two friends are waiting outside a convenience store, waiting for somebody to buy them beer. The friends run away when Walt Jr. approaches a random person who turns to be an off-duty cop. The cop tells him he got his ""first and last warning"" and hands him off to Hank, who Walt Jr. calls as his ""father"". Skyler holds an intervention for Walt, where she says she doesn't understand why Walt refuses treatment. Walt Jr. is angry with Walt and says that he feels Walt is giving up and he could be giving up on Walt Jr. in the future. Hank, Walt Jr. and Marie argue over what to do: while Skyler and Walt Jr. want him to take the treatment, Marie, and later Hank, feel Walt should be given the choice to decline the treatment if he wants. Walt ends the intervention saying he will not do the treatment.

The next morning, Walt has a change of heart and tells Skyler he will do the treatment, and he will take care of Elliott's check (that he has given for Walter's treatment). Later Gretchen calls, telling him that Walter has to accept the money. Walt says he appreciates the offer but lies and says his insurance will now cover it. It is also implied that Gretchen and Walter used to be in a relationship back when. Walt then goes to Jesse's house and asks him if he wants to cook."

Walt also demands no further bloodshed. Meanwhile, as Walt's chemotherapy continues, he tells Skyler that Elliott's check came and he deposited it, when in fact he is struggling to pay for the treatment and plans on using his Meth profits to cover it. At a family counseling session, Skyler tells Walt that she is concerned about his missing hours, but he explains that he just likes to be alone sometimes and take walks.

While cooking Meth, Walter had hot flashes and bouts of intense dizziness and has to sit down to catch his breath. Jesse observes a radiotherapy burn on Walt's chest and realizes he is trying to take care of his family before he dies of lung cancer. Jesse finishes their current batch and spends all night selling it, bringing Walt his share of $1,300, far less than he expected. Jesse says that he was able to sell only a small quantity in one night.

Jesse explains they need a distributor if they want to make more money, as only distributors can move large amounts of Meth through the streets in a short period of time. After Krazy-8's death, Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz) has taken over his territory. Jesse gains a meeting with Tuco after getting his friend Skinny Pete (Charles Baker), who served time in prison alongside Tuco, to vouch for him. Though Tuco is willing to pay $35,000 for a pound of Meth, he insists on only paying after his dealers have completed the sales. When Jesse refuses, Tuco severely beats him and lands him in the hospital.

Meanwhile, Hank traces the gas mask found in the desert to Walt's high school. Hank and Walt take inventory of the chemistry lab to find other equipment missing, leading Hank to suspect that a student got hold of the lab key. Walter also learns that Krazy-8 was working undercover for Hank. Later, Hank arrests a school janitor named Hugo (Pierre Barrera), who would have had the keys and had a previous record for drug possession. Walt feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about his hospitalization. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco.

Now starting to lose his hair from the chemo, Walt decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name ""Heisenberg,"" demanding $50,000 from Tuco-$35,000 for the Meth Tuco took from Jesse, and $15,000 for pain and suffering for Jesse's treatment. Seeing Walt with another bag of material, Tuco calls his bluff and threatens Walt. Walt throws a piece of the material against the floor which explodes. The entire floor is shaken by force, blowing out the windows and knocking everyone in the room off their feet. Walt reveals that the bag contains fulminated mercury. Walt threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground. Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as agreeing to a purchase for the next week, offering Walter $35,000 for the next pound of Meth. Walt demands instead that Tuco buy two pounds of Meth a week for $70,000. Tuco, is incredulous, but agrees. Tuco then decides to deal with Walt and is impressed with his willingness to go all out to make money out of the Meth he is producing. Walt leaves the building. Once back in his car, Walt exhibits an intense rush from what he has just done."

At a high school PTA meeting, Walt fondles Skyler beneath the conference room table, gradually arousing her. In the parking lot, the two of them have explosive sex in the back of Walt's car - Walt is beginning to get off on the danger of his situation. Jesse, who is now living in the RV, puts his house on the market because he is too traumatized by the deaths of Krazy-8 and Emilio to continue living there. Walt tells him about the deal with Tuco, but Jesse says producing two pounds of Meth a week is impossible. His ""Smurfs"" - people who supply him the Pseudo-Ephedrine needed to cook the Meth - can only supply so much a week.

Walt and Jesse face difficulties producing the large amount of Meth promised to Tuco. The bottleneck is Pseudo-Ephedrine, which Jesse buys from drug store at a box at a time and they need large quantities of it to produce 2 pounds of Meth. They had promised 2 pounds to Taco, but only deliver 0.53 pounds. Tuco is furious that Walt's end of the bargain was not kept and pays him only $17,00. He gives Walt another chance next week, but Walt says he still wants the $70,000 Tuco promised upfront, despite not having delivered the goods. Walt asks Tuco consider this a capital investment that will pay off in the coming weeks. Tuco agrees to $52,500 at a 25% weekly interest. This adds up to $65,625 with interest by next week but threatens dire consequences if next week's quota is not met. Walter has to deliver 1.875 pounds against the advance payment. To make up for it, Walt promises to have four pounds of Meth at the next meeting.

At Skyler's baby shower, Marie presents her with an expensive baby's tiara covered in white gold. This seems to irritate Hank. In the yard, Walt and Hank have a philosophical conversation about the dividing line between legal and illegal behavior. That night, Walt tells Skyler that he is planning to spend a weekend at a holistic medical clinic after she expressed desire for alternative therapy. In reality, Walt is cooking Meth with Jesse. Skyler goes to return the tiara and is detained in the store - it turns out that Marie stole it, but Skyler matches her description. She pretends to go into labor, persuading them to let her go. Skyler later confronts Marie about the theft, but Marie calmly denies it.

Walt has a plan to manufacture the Meth using different precursors and gives Jesse a list of chemicals and supplies to acquire with the cash fronted by Tuco. Jesse gets almost everything Walt requested except Methylamine which is kept tightly controlled. Jesse knows of a chemical warehouse where there are men willing to steal and sell the Methylamine for $10,000. Walt decides they will steal the Methylamine themselves by using the aluminum powder in Etch-a-Sketches to make Thermite. At night, Walt and Jesse trespass into the warehouse, subdue a security guard by locking him in a portable toilet, and place the Thermite on a locked door, which eats away the metal when lit. The two steal an entire drum of Methylamine and escape.

The next day, Walt and Jesse attempt to start the RV when mechanical troubles prevent it from going anywhere. Faced with a deadline, they set up to cook in Jesse's basement, unaware that his Realtor has planned an open house viewing for that same afternoon. Jesse guards the door to the basement while Walt synthesizes the chemicals, and once a man asks to see the basement, Jesse demands that everyone leave.

When Walt arrives back home, he learns of Marie's theft and wonders if Skyler would ever turn him in for a crime. At the next meeting with Tuco, Walt supplies 4.6 pounds of Meth. Despite its blue hue, it is still the same quality and Tuco hands over $91,000. When one of Tuco's men makes an offhanded remark to Walt, Tuco becomes furious and beats the man with his fists until he is unconscious. As Tuco drives away, Walt and Jesse look at each other in shock. The comment seemed to suggest that Walter and Jesse didn't know that they were working for Tuco and Tuco didn't take to that kindly."

In the lower levels of Hawkins National Laboratory, a scientist in a lab coat runs down a dark hallway, frantically pushing buttons and trying to operate an elevator. When the elevator arrives, the man enters and is seemingly safe then suddenly something growls above him. Terror fills the man's face, his eyes widened. As the doors close, he is violently pulled upwards.

Meanwhile, four middle schoolers, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will, play Dungeons & Dragons in Mike's basement. The four boys want to play a while longer, as they have just encountered the fearsome Demogorgon, but Mike's mother insists it's time for them to go home. While Will and Dustin are riding their bikes home, they decide to race so that if Will wins, he gets Dustin's X-Men #134. As Will pushes ahead, he rides onto ""Mirkwood"", a road near Hawkins Lab. He is frightened by a mysterious figure in the middle of the road and crashes his bike. Will hears something in the distance, which frightens him and sends him running home. But, the mysterious creature chases him. He tries to call for help, but the phone is not working. As the creature breaks in through his front door, Will runs and hides in a shed in the backyard of his house. He shakily loads a gun to fend off whatever is coming for him. The shed's dangling light bulb begins to flicker; a strange, guttural growl is heard, and Will vanishes.

Monday, November 7, 1983

The next morning, Will's mother, Joyce Byers, and his older brother, Jonathan Byers, are unable to find him. Joyce calls Mike's house to see if Will stayed there, but Karen tells her that he left the night before.

At Hawkins Middle School, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas are a little surprised that they haven't seen Will yet. They have a run in with bullies before heading to class. Meanwhile at Hawkins High School, Mike's sister, Nancy Wheeler, makes out with Steve Harrington in the bathroom. They make plans to meet up later.

Joyce hurries to the police station to talk to Chief Hopper, who she hopes can help her find her son. As Hawkins is a quiet town, Hopper questions Joyce's claims and doesn't take her too seriously. Hopper's first instinct is to question her ex-husband Lonnie, but Joyce insists that any potential involvement of his in Will's disappearance is unlikely - nonetheless, she agrees to call him.

At Hawkins Lab, a team of scientists, including Dr Brenner, suit up in protective suits before entering the quarantined underground subsystem. There, they find strange biologic growth spreading - originating from a mysterious fracture in the wall.

A young girl dressed in a hospital gown, with a shaved head, wanders into Benny's Burgers. The owner, Benny Hammond, catches her stealing fries.

After class at Hawkins Middle School, the boys become overwhelmed with excitement when their science teacher reveals that the Heathkit ham shack he ordered has been delivered. The school's principal and Chief Hopper interrupt to question them about Will's way home the previous night. He tells them to go straight home after school and to not go biking around looking for Will.

In a flashback scene, Joyce is in the woods at Castle Byers surprising Will with tickets to see Poltergeist. In the present, Joyce and Jonathan are at the fort, looking for Will.

Back at Benny's Burgers, Benny, showing some clarity despite her trying to steal from him, feeds the girl and attempts to make conversation, but she remains quiet. He realizes she has the digits ""011"" tattooed on her left forearm. When Benny asks about the number's meaning, the girl indicates that the number refers to herself. While she eats, Benny steps away to call social services; he thinks the girl has been abused. The girl becomes irritated by a noisy fan. She stares at it intensely, lowers her head and suddenly the music on the radio becomes heavily distorted and the fan jolts and stops. The girl relaxes and continues eating.

At Mirkwood, Hopper and his officers Powell and Callahan are on the road where Will crashed his bike. They find it tipped over and abandoned by the trees on the side of the road.

Joyce tries to call Lonnie, but is hung up on by his girlfriend, Cynthia. The cop shows up with Will's bike. Hopper looks around for clues and is drawn to the shed. The light flickers, and he is startled by Callahan entering the shed. He tells them they need to organise a search party.

Mike and his family sit at the dinner table. Mike wants to go look for Will, but his mother says no. Nancy asks her mother to go study at her friend Barb's house. She says that nobody leaves until Will is found. Nancy gets upset and during a fight with Mike he reveals her new boyfriend.

A search party is out in the woods at night looking for Will. Scott Clarke tells Hopper that Will is a great student. It is revealed that Hopper's daughter, Sarah died a few years back.

Benny does dishes in the kitchen and tells the girl that a smile looks good on her. A woman claiming to be from Social Services arrives to pick her up. Benny invites the woman into the diner. But, when his back is turned, the woman shoots him. Benny falls to the floor, dead, and a number of agents arrive to collect the girl. She quickly becomes agitated and uses her telekinetic abilities to kill two of the agents before escaping.

The boys are out searching for Will, while Nancy and Steve study secretly in her room. Steve tries to seduce Nancy, but she rejects his advances. They return to their reading.

Joyce and Jonathan go through family photos. Jonathan breaks down, feeling guilty about his brother's disappearance. Joyce tells him it's not his fault and claims that Will is close, that she can feel it. They choose a picture for his ""missing child"" flyers. Joyce receives an ominous, static call on her home phone. Joyce tells Jonathan that she can hear Will breathing. There's static, some growling and the lights flicker. The phone surges with electricity and briefly electrocutes Joyce.

After finding Eleven in the woods, the boys bring her back to Mike's house for the night. Lucas thinks this is a terrible idea and suggests they all tell Mike's mom Karen Wheeler right away, but Mike points out, that would just get them all grounded, since they were not supposed to go looking for Will Byers. Mike gives her clean clothes to change into. He also nicknames her ""El"" and gives her a pillow fort to sleep in.

Tuesday, November 8, 1983

The next day, Mike brings her breakfast. He tries to get Eleven to sneak out of the house and to the front door to make it look like she stumbled upon the house and that way his mom can help. Eleven rejects his idea, telling Mike that ""bad people"" are looking for her and that revealing her whereabouts will only make things worse.

Meanwhile, Joyce talks to Chief Hopper about the creepy, static phone call she received. Hopper is reluctant to believe her story, but admits the charring on the phone from the surge of electricity is weird. Later, Joyce heads to her workplace to buy a new phone and demands two weeks' pay in advance from her boss. He shows some sympathy for Joyce after he realizes her kid is missing and gives in.

Back at Mike's house, Mike acquaints Eleven to his house, instead of going to school. Eleven notices a picture of the four boys and points at Will. She knows him, but before Mike can ask anymore questions, his mom comes home (Mike was supposed to be at school). Mike hides Eleven in his bedroom closet, which scares her. Mike promises that he won't tell his mother about her and Eleven trusts him enough to close the door. However, Mike explains the situation regarding El to Dustin and Lucas and her knowing about Will's disappearance and urges them to help her. Lucas, unconvinced, tries to tell Mike's mom about Eleven, but Eleven stops him, using her telekinetic abilities to close Mike's bedroom door. Lucas and Dustin begin to trust her too.

At night, Mike, bringing Lucas and Dustin to the basement, brings food for Eleven and asks her if she knows where their friend Will is. Eleven doesn't know what the word ""friend"" means so Mike explains it to her. Eleven then uses the Dungeons and Dragons set to show them Will is hiding from a monster. The cops find a drainpipe in the woods leading to Hawkins National Laboratory. They believe Will might have crawled through it.

Joyce receives another creepy, static call, surging with electricity and shocking her again. The lights in her house begin to turn one by one, leading to Will's bedroom. Suddenly, one wall begins to move and takes on some weird shapes. Joyce quickly runs out of the house and into her car, but later turns and goes back to the house.

At Steve's party, Nancy's friend, Barb, feels like a third wheel. Barb sits near the pool by herself. Jonathan hides in the woods near the pool and takes her picture before leaving. Jonathan fails to notice a mysterious monster as it abducts Barb."

Everything is dark and covered in vines. She calls for Nancy and then sees a monster in the pool. She tries to escape, but the monster catches hold of her. Meanwhile, Steve and Nancy are making out on Steve's bed. It is quite different from where Barb is, and there is water in the pool. Barb's voice can be heard echoing distantly, but she cannot be seen. Steve and Nancy make love as Barb is taken by the monster, screaming for help.

Joyce is talking to Will through the lamps. Jonathan tells her that the light flickering is due to faulty electricity, but Joyce is convinced that Will is there.

Mike, Dustin, and Lucas prepare to rescue Will. Dustin tells the others that Eleven is the best weapon they have because of her telekinetic powers. He asks her to make a toy Millennium Falcon fly, but she does nothing. Mike asks Eleven to meet them after school and gives her his watch. Later, while alone, Eleven is making the Falcon fly with her mind. She wanders around the house and turns on the television. This causes her to have a flashback to Hawkins Lab where she crushes a soda can with her mind as Dr. Brenner and the others observe her. Her nose bleeds, as it always does when she uses her powers. Brenner is pleased; Eleven seems upset.

Joyce takes out her Christmas lights and puts them up but realizes that she doesn't have enough and buys more at the general store where she works. Her boss is confused, but she tells him just to ring her up.

Hopper investigates at Hawkins Lab where an official tells him that Will could not have gotten in there. Hopper asks to see the security cameras and is shown footage of the night Will escaped. Hopper realizes that the officials are lying to him because it rained that night and there is no rain on the video.

Nancy sees that Barb is not at school and asks Steve, Tommy, and Carol if they saw her after the party at Steve's house. No one has seen her. While looking for rocks for their slingshots, the boys encounter Troy and James who tease them about Will and trip Mike, who scrapes his chin.

Karen Wheeler shows up at Joyce's house with a casserole as Joyce is finishing putting up all the Christmas lights. Karen is visibly confused by all the lights and Joyce tells her she put them up because Will loves Christmas. As the two women talk, Karen's young daughter Holly sees the lights blinking, and follows them. She sees a hand start to come through the wall, but Joyce discovers her and asks Karen and Holly to leave.

Hopper looks up Hawkins Lab at the library and finds articles about a woman who sued Brenner for kidnapping her daughter. Hopper starts to think that maybe Brenner is involved with Will's disappearance.

Jonathan develops the photos he took at Steve's party in the school's darkroom. A girl named Nicole sees the photos of Nancy. Nancy calls Barb's house and learns that Barb did not go home the night before and that her mother hasn't seen her. Steve, Tommy, Carol, and Nicole confront Jonathan about spying on them the previous night. They take his bag and tear up the photos. Nancy arrives and Steve takes and smashes Jonathan's camera. Nancy is visibly upset by this. She gathers the torn pieces of photos.

While waiting for the boys at the power lines, Eleven sees a cat, causing her to have a flashback to Hawkins Lab. Brenner and the other scientists seem to want her to do something to a cat, but she refuses, clearly upset. As punishment, they take Eleven into a cell as she kicks and screams for ""Papa"" (her name for Brenner). Before they can lock her in, she forces the door open with her mind and kills the two men. Brenner sees this, and seems intrigued, but not horrified. Eleven collapses and Brenner carries her away. Back in the present, the boys meet up with Eleven. She asks about what happened to Mike's chin and he tells her about the boys who tease him, calling them ""mouth breathers.""

Nancy goes back to Steve's house and finds Barb's car still there. She looks for Barb around the house and in the woods where she sees the monster that took Barb.

Joyce sees the Christmas lights illuminate along the wire going in one direction. They lead to a crawl space where Joyce is able to talk to Will with a tangle of lights. She asks him to blink the lights once for yes and two for no. She asks if he is alive and the lights blink once. She asks if he is safe and the lights blink twice. She paints the alphabet on the wall, tacking a light to each letter so that he can communicate more with her. She asks him where he is and the lights spell out ""right here."" Next, they spell out ""run."" The monster comes through the wall as Joyce runs in terror.

Thinking that Eleven can help them find Will, they ask her to lead them to him. She takes them to his house. Lucas gets upset. As they argue, sirens can be heard. They bike to the quarry where they see police drag a boy's body out of the water. Mike yells at Eleven for having deceived them about Will being alive and storms off."

She refuses to believe them, saying that she just talked to him. She tries to explain how Will communicates through the lights, but both Hopper and Jonathan dismiss her crazy sounding claims. Hopper sympathetically tells Joyce that he went through a similar type of grief when his daughter died, but Joyce insists that Will is not dead. Hopper leaves and Joyce gets an axe from the shed.

In his basement, Mike is looking through Will's drawings and Eleven is listening to static on his walkie talkie. He snaps at her to stop it and then yells at her for lying about Will being alive. Eleven continues to fiddle with the walkie talkie until they can hear Will's shaky voice singing ""Should I Stay or Should I Go.""

Jonathan wakes up Joyce (who fell asleep on the sofa with the axe) that they have to go to the morgue to identify Will's body. At the morgue, Joyce and Jonathan see the body through a window. Jonathan runs away, and Joyce yells at the coroner that whatever she is looking at is not her son's body. Hopper and Jonathan try to reason with her, but she refuses to identify the remains as Will's. Jonathan tells her that she can't fall apart and Joyce tells him she knows she sounds crazy but maintains that she heard Will talk to her.

Mike tells Karen that he doesn't think he can go to school and Karen doesn't fight him, letting him stay home alone. Once she is gone, he calls Lucas on the walkie talkie and tells him that he and Dustin need to meet with him. Lucas is skeptical, but agrees. At Mike's house, they listen to the walkie talkie but can't hear anything definite. They realize that they will need a better radio and will need to use Mr. Clarke's Heathkit radio at the school. They disguise Eleven in an old dress of Nancy's and a blonde wig. Seeing her new look, Mike calls her pretty. Eleven looks at herself in the mirror and seems pleased with her appearance.

At Hawkins Lab, a scientist named Shepard dressed in a full body hazmat suit goes into the web that leads to the other world. Dr. Brenner has him attached to a cable so he can be reeled back in. Shepard disappears into the unknown and the web wall closes behind him.

Nancy is taken out of class by police officers questioning her about Barb's disappearance. They tell her and Karen that Barb's car is no longer near Steve's house and that she probably ran away. Nancy argues that Barb wouldn't do that. They ask about what Nancy and Steve were doing together and Nancy says that they were just talking. Karen seems upset.

At the police station, Hopper asks his coworker Gary about the state troopers who brought in Will's body. Gary tells him that they claimed jurisdiction on the case and did not let Gary see the body.

The boys and Eleven bike to school and attempt to enter the radio room, but it is locked. Mr. Clarke discovers them and tells them that the assembly for Will is about to start and that they should be there. They try to argue but Mr. Clarke give them the key to the room and tells them that they can use it after the assembly. The boys introduce him to Eleven as Mike's Swedish cousin Eleanor.

At the Wheeler house, Nancy and Karen fight over what Nancy told the police. Nancy admits to Karen that she slept with Steve, but that it doesn't have anything to do with Barb's disappearance and expresses her frustration that no one seems to care that her friend is missing. She runs up to her room and looks at the ripped up photo of Barb sitting by the pool. As she puts the photo back together, she sees a strange figure off to the side. She tapes the photo back together.

At Hawkins Lab, Brenner is communicating with Shepard who describes the area as corroded. Then Shepard, clearly afraid, says that there is something else there. A deep growling can be heard and Brenner tries to reel Shepard back. The tension on the cable breaks and when the cable is reeled in, all that remains is the connector to Shepard's suit, covered in blood.

The boys and Eleven sit through the memorial assembly for Will. They hear James and Troy laughing and mocking Will. After the assembly, Mike confronts the boys who continue to insult Will. Mike pushes Troy down and Troy lunges for Mike, but stops, apparently unable to move. They all see that Troy has soiled his pants and everyone laughs at him. Mike and Eleven make eye contact and Eleven smiles, wiping her bloody nose, indicating that she caused that to happen.

Nancy finds Jonathan attempting to choose a coffin for Will. She asks him about the figure in the photo, and Jonathan has no explanation for it. He tells Nancy that Barb was there one second and then gone. Nancy confides in Jonathan about the creature she saw at Steve's house and Jonathan asks her to describe it. Jonathan realizes that the creature Nancy saw is the same one Joyce saw coming through the wall.

Hopper is having drinks at a bar and he buys a stranger a drink and tells him that his daughter just won a spelling bee. The stranger asks her name and Hopper pauses before saying her name is Sarah. Then he tells the stranger he recognizes him and the stranger explains that he is the trooper who found the body of Will Byers. Hopper asks if the quarry where Will was found is state-run and when the stranger confirms that, Hopper explains that the quarry is run by the Sattler Company and asks why the trooper is lying to him. The trooper angrily tells him to mind his own business. The shot changes to Hopper beating up the trooper outside the bar and demanding to know what the trooper was doing there. He finally confesses that he was told not to let anyone get close to the body. Hopper asks who he works for and then hears a car pull up. He runs to confront the car, which drives away. The trooper runs away.

Joyce plays ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" at her house and frustratedly yells at the lights to talk to her.

Mike, Eleven, Lucas, and Dustin go into the room with Mr. Clarke's Heathkit radio and Eleven attempts to reach Will. She has a flashback to her time in Hawkins Lab. Bruner is asking her to find a man in a photo, not to hurt him but to listen to what he says and repeat what he says back to him. Eleven closes her eyes and concentrates. She sees a man in a room reading words from a list. Bruner asks her to repeat the words and the lights flicker out as the man's voice can be heard reading random words. Back in the present, Eleven is concentrating and the light in the radio room goes out. The boys hear a clanging on the radio.

Joyce hears the same clanging and turns off the music. She hears Will whimpering and calling Mom, his voice coming from inside the wall. Joyce screams that she is there at the same time that the boys call to Will over the radio. The wallpaper parts to reveal a red window into the alternate reality. She can see Will through the red but she cannot touch him. A monster growls and Will says in terror that it is coming. Joyce begs Will to tell her how to get to him. The boys hear Will on the radio say that he is in a place that is just like home, but dark, cold, and scary. Joyce tells Will that she will find him but he has to hide. The wall closes over the portal window revealing the wall as it was before. In the radio room, a fuse blows and the radio erupts in flame. Eleven, visibly fatigued seems unable to move. The boys help her up and carry her out of the room. Joyce takes the axe and chops a hole in her wall only to reveal the normal outside of her house. The camera pans away from her house as she stares out of the hole in confusion and despair.

Jonathan and Nancy develop a zoomed in version of the photo of Barb with the creature. While they are waiting for the photo to develop, Nancy awkwardly asks Jonathan about his photography hobby. Jonathan admits that he would rather observe people than interact with them. The clearer and larger picture of the creature appears and Nancy says that that is what she saw at Steve's house. They realize that if Joyce was right about the creature, she might be right about Will still being alive and if so, Barb might also be alive.

Hopper drives back to the morgue pretending that he is there to retrieve his hat. A trooper stops him, but Hopper knocks him out and steals his key. He finds Will's body and touches it, realizing that something is not right. He cuts open the chest revealing that it is a fake body stuffed with cotton. Hopper now realizes that Joyce was right.

Lonnie comes to Joyce's house late at night. He asks her what happened to the wall and she tearfully embraces him.

Joyce confides in Lonnie about being able to hear and see Will, and tearfully says that she can't hear him anymore. Lonnie suggests to Joyce that it is all in her mind and that it's a coping mechanism and he urges her to get help. The hole that Joyce chopped in the wall is now covered by a tarp.

Hopper calls for Will inside Hawkins Lab. He sees evidence of children being there - a stuffed toy on a bed and a child's drawing on the wall. The drawing shows two stick figures labeled ""11"" and ""Papa."" Hopper continues to search for Will despite the staff of Hawkins Lab now being alerted to his presence. He finds the web wall entrance to the parallel universe and gets captured before he can explore any further.

Eleven and the boys are back at Mike's house trying to make sense out of what Will was saying over the radio. Eleven says the words ""Upside down"" to describe where Will is. Mike quickly realizes that Eleven has been trying to tell that Will is on the ""other side,"" in an alternate reality. (That's why she flipped over the game board to show where he was.) They look in their Dungeons and Dragons game book for a description of ""The Vale of Shadows,"" a ""dark reflection...of our world"" where monsters live. They ask Eleven if she can get there and she shakes her head.

Jonathan comes home to find both his parents. He asks Joyce if the creature she saw came back but Lonnie shuts him down. Privately, Jonathan tells Lonnie to leave but Lonnie says that Joyce is mentally unstable. Jonathan is now starting to believe Joyce, but Lonnie argues that Jonathan is just making it worse.

Will's funeral is held at a cemetery. The boys see a girl crying at the funeral and whisper about how that will make Will feel. The coffin with the fake body is buried. In a flashback, Joyce watches Will draw a picture of Dungeons and Dragons characters. She asks him about the character and they both laugh about his needing to draw green fire because he can't find the red crayon.

Hopper wakes up back in his cabin. He runs outside with his gun, but he is alone. He then looks under all surfaces and examines all the light fixtures and electronics in his house, destroying many of his possessions in the process, and even looking inside his phone and his sofa. Finally, he discovers a bug planted in an overhead light.

At Hawkins Lab, Dr. Bruner can be seen listening into the boys conversation in Mr. Clarke's radio room. Will's voice is heard calling to Joyce, and Bruner realizes that Joyce knows something.

After the funeral, Jonathan and Nancy examine a map, marking where the creature has been. They realize that it is not going very far and make plans to find the thing and kill it. Jonathan steals a gun from the hearse but says he won't tell Joyce until the thing is dead.

Repairmen examine Mr. Clarke's fried radio. At the funeral reception, the boys ask Mr. Clarke about parallel universes and how they would get to an alternate dimension, theoretically. Mr. Clarke uses a paper plate to draw an acrobat on a tightrope, representing our dimension, which has rules - one can only move forward or backward. If there is a flea on the tightrope, it can move on top of the rope like the acrobat, but also along the side or under the rope. He says that the only way for a human to get to the Upside Down would be to create a massive amount of energy to make a tear in time and space, which would create a gate to the alternate dimension and stabs the plate with a pen to demonstrate. The boys realize that such a gate already exists, which is how Will got to the Upside Down.

Officers show up at Hoppers house to discuss a new case: two men disappeared after hunting. They were in the same place where Will disappeared, the area the boys refer to as Mirkwood. Hopper tells them that he will take care of the case. They tell him that Barb's car was discovered at a bus station, seemingly confirming that she ran away. As they drive away, the officers wonder about Hopper's odd behavior and demeanor and wonder if he is spending too much time with Joyce.

Lonnie fixes the hole in Joyce's wall by hammering boards across it. Joyce scolds him for taking down the Christmas lights, but he says that they were in the way. He mentions that he went to the quarry where Will supposedly died and there were no fences or warning signs. He says that the Sattler Company, which owns the quarry, should be held responsible.

The boys tell Eleven what Mr. Clarke told them about a gate into an alternate dimension and they ask her if she knows where it is, but she does not. Dustin is circling the room with a compass and asks to see all of their compasses. Dustin realizes that although all the compasses are not facing true north and explains that only a powerful magnetic force could make a compass point in a different direction. They realize that the gate to the Upside Down would disrupt the electromagnetic field. He hypothesizes that if they follow the compasses, they will find the gate. Eleven is visibly upset by this.

Nancy finds a bat and practices swinging it. Steve shows up and jokingly says he hopes she wasn't planning to use the bat on him. He apologizes to her for being insensitive about Barb and asks if there is any news. He suggests the two of them go see a movie but Nancy declines, tells him she will call him later, and kisses him.

Joyce has realized that Lonnie want to sue the Sattler Company and accuses him of only coming back to his family because of the money. Lonnie accuses Joyce of being a bad mother, blaming her for Will's death and calling her a mess, alluding to the Christmas lights. Joyce says she will keep them up as long as she thinks Will might still be alive. The two scream at each other, and Joyce kicks Lonnie out of the house.

Jonathan is practicing with the gun in the woods, trying to shoot cans but failing. Nancy shows up and Jonathan tells her about how his father made him kill a rabbit when he was nine years old, which was traumatizing for him. He suggests that his parents once loved each other before he could remember. Nancy confides that she doesn't think her parents ever loved each other but just married each other for convenience. She takes a turn with the gun and shoots a can on the first try.

Hopper calls his ex-wife, who seems upset that he is calling. He tells her that he doesn't regret their time together even though they lost their daughter. A baby cries and the viewer realizes that the ex-wife is remarried with a family. Hopper says goodbye and starts to leave his cabin. The phone rings, but he pulls the cord out of the wall.

Eleven and the boys are following the compasses down a railway track. Dustin suggests that Eleven is acting odd. Eleven has a flashback to being at Hawkins lab. Dr. Bruner tells her that she will go farther than she has before and Eleven asks about a bath. She is visibly afraid, but agrees. Eleven is lowered into a sensory deprivation tank. Back in the present, Eleven tells Mike that they should turn back. She says she is tired, but Mike says that they are probably almost there.

Jonathan and Nancy search the woods, Jonathan armed with the baseball bat, and Nancy carrying the gun. They have a fight over her involvement with Steve. Jonathan suggests that Nancy is pretending to be someone she is not by dating Steve. Nancy denies this and argues that Steve was just protecting her when he smashed Jonathan's camera. The two argue about him and Jonathan storms off.

Hopper shows up at Joyce's house with a sign warning her not to speak. He comes in to search the house for bugs and then sees all the Christmas lights and realizes that it could be in any of them. Later, he has examined each bulb and has determined that Joyce is probably okay. He tells her that he went to the morgue and that the body was a fake. He acknowledges that Joyce has been right the whole time.

Dustin realizes that they have gone in a circle and that they are no closer to finding the gate. Lucas accuses Eleven of using her powers to screw with the compasses and lead them away from the gate. This is confirmed when they see that she has had a recent nosebleed. Lucas accuses her of not wanting to help them find Will and Eleven, unable to accurately phrase what she is feeling, simply tells them that it's not safe. Mike and Lucas fight over Eleven. Mike says that she is helping them and Lucas accuses her of using them to get food and shelter and that maybe she is the reason Will is lost in the Upside Down. They boys fight physically and Eleven causes Lucas to be torn away from Mike, hurting him in the process. Mike and Dustin run to Lucas who is unconscious. Mike yells at Eleven, asking what is wrong with her. (Clearly, a lot!) Back in Eleven's flashback to the sensory deprivation tank, we see her in a black void listening to a man speak in Russian. Bruner and the others are able to hear him on the PA system. Eleven hears a growl and the man disappears. Eleven runs away in the void and then we see her screaming in terror in the tank. In the present, Eleven breaks down crying. Lucas wakes up, angry, but unhurt. He storms away and Mike and Dustin realize that Eleven is gone.

Jonathan and Nancy are still in the woods at night, annoyed at each other. Nancy hears a whimpering sound and they discover a severely wounded deer. Nancy realizes that she needs to shoot the deer to put it out of its misery and Jonathan says that he will do it. Clearly uncomfortable, he aims the gun at the deer, but before he can shoot, the deer is dragged away suddenly by an unseen force. They follow the trail of blood with their weapons ready. Nancy discovers a hollow at the base of a tree, dripping with blood. She calls for Jonathan who does not respond, and then crawls into the hollow to investigate. Nancy is able to crawl through the tree and out the other side where there are webs and vines everywhere and little flecks in the air, indicating that she has passed into the Upside Down. She sees the creature devouring the deer and backs away, treading on a vine, which cracks, disturbing the creature. It turns toward her and its face opens into five toothed petal-like shapes, revealing a mouth full of teeth. Nancy screams and runs back to the portal in the tree. Jonathan hears her, but doesn't know where she went. He finds her bag at the base of the tree and calls for her. As he searches, bark grows over the hollow in the tree, closing the portal to the Upside Down with Nancy trapped inside."

Lucas contacts the others on his walkie talkie and tells him that the men from Hawkins Lab are coming for Eleven. The kids flee on their bikes but are followed by the repair vans we now know are disguised vehicles for Hawkins Lab. One van comes straight for the kids, but Eleven causes it to flip over in the air and crash. The kids escape to a junkyard where they hide in an abandoned bus.

Hopper and Joyce go to the police station to get Jonathan. Jonathan and Nancy explain about the monster and Joyce reprimands Jonathan for going after it alone. At the station, Hopper encounters Troy and his mother attempting to report the girl who broke Troy's arm. Once Troy describes the girl's appearance and abilities, Hopper knows that it's Eleven. He learns that she is with the boys and they realize that they need to find the children before Brenner does. Jonathan locates Will's walkie talkie and they try to contact Mike. The boys hesitate for a while before answering, thinking it might be a trap, but ultimately tell Hopper their location.

Dr. Brenner meets with Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler and tells them that Mike has been hiding a dangerous girl and that Mike is now in danger. He asks for their trust on the matter and tells them to stay at home while he tries to find the kids. They are shaken, but agree.

The men from the lab arrive at the junkyard and nearly discover the children, but Hopper gets to them first. Back at Joyce's house, they explain to the adults about the Upside Down. Eleven tries to make contact with Will and Barb on the walkie talkie, but is weakened from flipping the van and isn't able to connect. She tells them that she can still make contact with a ""bath"" or sensory deprivation tank. Dustin calls Mr. Clarke (interrupting his date night) to ask how to build a sensory deprivation tank. They set up a kiddie pool in the Hawkins Middle School auditorium and steal hundreds of pounds of deicing salt to add to the water. Mike and Nancy have a nice moment where they agree not to keep secrets from each other anymore. Mike asks Nancy if she likes Jonathan and she denies it. Nancy asks Mike if he likes Eleven and he denies it.

Joyce thanks Eleven for her bravery and for helping her family. She reassures Eleven that she will be with her the entire time and to let her know if it gets too scary. This is the first time Eleven has been shown this kind of sympathy from an adult and it goes in direct contrast to her treatment by Dr. Brenner, who although somewhat affectionate, does not care about Eleven's mental well being and does not respond to her when she is afraid.

Eleven floats in the sensory deprivation tank and finds herself in the void. She discovers Barb's gruesome dead body and screams ""Gone!"" over and over until Joyce's voice calms her. She finds the Upside Down version of Castle Byers covered in slimy web and vines with Will inside, cold and weak, but alive. She tells him that Joyce is coming for him and he says to hurry. It is clear that he does not have much time left to live.

Hopper and Joyce leave for Hawkins Lab, leaving Nancy and Jonathan to watch the kids. Nancy realizes that Hopper and Joyce could run into the demogorgon in the Upside Down and that they need to distract it from them. They leave the kids at the school and go back to the police station where they steal back their weapons and bear trap. Hopper and Joyce break into the lab, but are captured by officials. The episode ends with a freezing Will softly singing ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go"" and hearing the demogorgon outside Castle Byers. The walls of the fort suddenly break in."

Brenner asks Joyce to help him by telling him how she made contact with Will but Joyce yells at him, saying he's the reason Will is trapped. Officials ask Hopper what he knows and he says he knows everything. He promises his silence on the matter in exchange for them letting him and Joyce find Will. Brenner also asks where Eleven is and Hopper says he will tell him if he leaves the other kids alone. Joyce and Hopper put on hazmat suits and are allowed through the gate. Brenner and Frazier leave to find Eleven, convinced that Hopper and Joyce will not come back from the Upside Down.

Jonathan and Nancy go back to Joyce's house to trap the demogorgon. They set a bear trap, pour kerosene on the floor, and hammer nails through the baseball bat and replace the Christmas lights. They cut their hands to bait the demogorgon then bandage their hands and wait for the lights to blink, signaling the demogorgon's presence. Steve shows up wanting to talk to Jonathan. Nancy and Jonathan tell him to leave, but the lights start blinking and the demogorgon comes through the ceiling. They all hide, ready to light the kerosene, but all is quiet. Steve is in disbelief and Nancy tells him he needs to leave. He goes to his car and sees that the lights are blinking again. The demogorgon attacks Jonathan and Nancy shoots it. Steve comes back and hits the demogorgon with the bat with the nails. It steps on the trap and Jonathan sets it on fire. He extinguishes the fire and they see that the demogorgon has disappeared.

Joyce and Hopper navigate the Upside Down and come to the demolished Castle Byers. Will is gone. Hopper has flashback's to his daughter suffering from cancer and her eventual death. They come to the version of Joyce's house in the Upside Down. As they walk through the house, the lights illuminate down the hallway. Jonathan and Joyce are aware of each other although they cannot see each other.

At the school, the kids are waiting for the adults to come back. Mike tells Eleven that soon she will be able to live with his family and not hide anymore. He says that he wants to take Eleven to the school dance and kisses her. Brenner and the rest from Hawkins lab arrive at the school and corner the children, but Eleven makes Frazier and two others bleed from their eyes until they fall down dead. Exhausted by the effort, Eleven faints and Brenner discovers them. As he is talking to Eleven, the lights blink. The demogorgon, drawn by Frazier's blood, appears though the wall. The kids get away and the demogorgon attacks Brenner.

Joyce and Hopper enter the library in the Upside Down. They discover Barb's body and leave her there. Joyce finds Will against the wall with a snake vine growing through his mouth. They pull out the vine, which slithers and Hopper shoots it. Will is unresponsive, but they perform CPR on him and he starts breathing again.

The kids hide in a classroom with the weak Eleven. Mike comforts her and then the demogorgon bursts through the door. Lucas fires rocks with his slingshot which is ineffective. Suddenly the demogorgon is blasted against the wall and Eleven appears, her nose bleeding. Eleven walks to the demogorgon, pushing Mike away when he tries to intervene. She says goodbye to Mike and uses her powers on the demogorgon, which disappears, and disappears with it.

Will recovers in the hospital and reunites with his family and the boys who fill him in on what has been going on.

One month later, it's Christmas Eve. The boys are playing D&D in the basement again. They finish their game and Mike looks sadly at the place where Eleven used to sleep. Nancy gives Jonathan a new camera and is seen with Steve, indicating that they are still going out. Hopper makes an appearance at an office Christmas party only to take some food and then drives to the woods where he leaves the food along with some Eggos in a wooden box. They Byers family celebrates Christmas at home without any Christmas lights. In the bathroom, Will coughs up a slug into the sink and then momentarily has a flashback of being in the Upside Down. Will tells Joyce about the D&D game as they eat Christmas dinner."

A-list actor Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins) is performing cowboy-themed stunts with his daughter Janey Howard (Teagan Meredith), a gig he's recently taken up in order to afford alimony payments, as implied by Bob Spencer (Mike Doyle) and Frank (Jamal Thomas). Shortly after finishing his performance and acquiring a slice of birthday cake for his daughter, a nuclear bomb strikes the city of Los Angeles. Janey, seeing the bomb, holds out her thumb to measure the size of the mushroom cloud before being joined by her father, who initially believes the blast to be a large fire. Within seconds, the blast's shockwave shatters all surrounding windows, sending the partygoers into chaos. The Spencers retire to their family bomb shelter, while Cooper grabs Janey and flees on horseback as bombs ignite in the distance.

The show then cuts to Vault 33, 219 years in the future. The audience finds Hank MacLean's (Kyle MacLachlan) daughter, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), sitting before the Vault governing council regarding her application for a breeder from neighboring Vault 32. In an effort to ease her nerves, Hank tells his daughter how he left his native home of Vault 31 to marry her mother and he's been happy ever since. Lucy's cousin, Chester (Dave Register), the vault gatekeeper, attempts to stall the process as he is secretly in love with Lucy, however, Lucy rejects his advances, emphasizing the disastrous effects long-term inbreeding has on future generations. As the door to Vault 32 opens, Overseer Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury) introduces herself alongside Monty (Cameron Cowperthwaite), Lucy's selected breeder. At the wedding, Overseer Hank announces that current studies suggest they will be able to begin repopulating the surface within the next generation. Lucy and Monty retire to their unit, where Monty undresses and initiates sexual intercourse with Lucy. The perspective again changes, this time to Lucy's brother, Norm MacLean (Moisés Arias), who decides to sneak into Vault 32. Inside he discovers an array of dead crops and decaying corpses, causing him to flee. After Lucy and Monty finish, Lucy picks up her Pip-Boy to discover Monty's radiation levels are exceptionally high, suggesting he's from the surface, not a vault. Upon her discovery, Monty slashes Lucy's face, stabs her, and begins to asphyxiate her, before being smashed over the head with a glass pitcher and heavily cut. Lucy, armed with a tranquilizer gun, escapes her suite to discover the entirety of Vault 33 is under attack. Stephanie Harper's (Annabel O'Hagan) husband, Bert (Diego Borborema) is killed during the raid while she is stabbed in the eye with a fork, causing permanent vision loss. During the chaos, Lucy is able to assist her brother in hiding from the raiders, but while helping her brother get into a storage unit she is grabbed by a heavily wounded Monty who attempts to strangle Lucy yet again, before being beaten with a shovel by Hank and drowned in a barrel of vinegar. The Vault-door alarm begins sounding, causing Lucy and her father to run towards the door to Vault 32 where Moldaver and multiple hostages are waiting. Moldaver forces Hank to choose between the hostages or Lucy, however, Hank responds by locking Lucy in a nearby janitorial closet before being tranquilized and abducted by Moldaver's goons. Moldaver tells Lucy she resembles her mother before detonating a bomb rigged to the vault door, starting a countdown. The hostages are able to escape before the bomb detonates while Moldaver and her men escape with Hank. The show then cuts to the vault dwellers conducting necessary tasks around their vault: nursing survivors, composting their dead and repairing destroyed tech. Lucy pleads to the council to send a team of four dwellers to the surface to find her father, however, the idea is instantly rejected, with the idea of opening the door being deemed ""too dangerous,"" however, Norm argues it's because they know they'll lose their power if the overseer returns. With the assistance of Norm and Chet, Lucy is able to escape via the main vault door, tranquilizing Chet to prevent him from following her. Council member Reg McPhee (Rodrigo Luzzi) and resident Davey (Leer Leary) arrive at the door as Lucy is leaving in an unsuccessful bid to get her to stay. As she steps into the desertified ruins of Los Angeles, Lucy is greeted by the countless skeletons of those who attempted to enter the vault the day the bombs fell. As Lucy steps out she gazes upon the Pacific Ocean and the destroyed remnants of the Santa Monica pier.

Shifting narratives once again, the show introduces Maximus (Aaron Moten), a Brotherhood of Steel aspirant. In one of his classes, Cleric Felix (Jacinto Riddick) reveals the Brotherhood's mission to gain a strategic monopoly on all pre-war technology. Maximus, after watching the arrival of a massive Brotherhood airship and seeing dozens of sets of T-60 power armor is overcome with memories of being saved by a Brotherhood night as a child after his hometown was destroyed. Max's friend, Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) is promoted to serve as Knight Titus' squire, however, the following morning Dane suffers a gruesome foot injury after someone places razor blades in his boots. Max is accused of being the perpetrator of this incident, with Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer) assigning him to replace Dane as Titus' squire. Maximus and Taitus are sent to capture Doctor Siggi Wilzig (Michael Emerson), a former Enclave scientist in possession of an artifact valuable to the Brotherhood.

The show changes to follow three bounty hunters tasked with sneaking into a fortress owned by Dom Pedro. The group's leader, Honcho (Mykelti Williamson) reveals the men are attempting to rescue a bounty hunter being held captive by Pedro. The hunters find the buried coffin of the prisoner and begin to unearth it, placing a caged chicken nearby in case the captured hunter has turned feral, as ferals will attack the chicken before attacking them. Once the hunters finish digging, they unseal the coffin, revealing a glorified Cooper Howard. Honcho proposes Cooper work with him and his two men in order to secure Moldaver's bounty, the same artifact the Brotherhood is in search of, with Honcho mentioning the ghoul has ties to Los Angeles. Enraged by the mention of California, Howard kills Honcho's two men before pushing Honcho into his coffin, leaving him to die. Howard then embarks towards California on his own, set on securing Moldaver's bounty."

He regains his consciousness and finds out that the plane from Sydney to Los Angelis which he'd boarded had crashed on this island and there is chaos to be seen everywhere. He rushes to help people wherever he could.

We are introduced to various characters of the story. Claire (Emily de Ravin) is eight-months pregnant. Jack saves her and Hurly from a falling plane vane and asks Hurly to stay with Claire. Jack then goes a bit deeper into the jungle and takes his shirt off. He's had a cut below his ribcage. He spots Kate (Evengaline Lilly) passing by and asks her whether she'd any experience of sewing in the past. On which she says she'd made drapes in the home. Jack says that'd be enough skill to sew his wound. She protests at first but helps him out anyway.

Michael is trying to comfort his son Walt out of the shock of the plane crash. Jin (Daniel Dae) tells her wife Sun (Yunjin Kim) never to lose sight of him and that she should follow him wherever he goes as a safety measure.

Jack is examining a person when Kate asks him whether he would survive. Jack asks her if she knew the man. She tells him half truth that he was sitting next to her in the plane. (He is the officer who had Kate handcuffed and was bringing her back to Los Angeles.) Jack says he'd blacked out when the plane crashed and Kate says she didn't. She saw the whole thing as to how exactly the plane had crashed. She says when the plane broke, the tail end part of it broke off and fell somewhere else and she couldn't bring herself to look back at it. And then she says the front end also broke off. Jack tells her that neither the front end or the tail end is on the beach. That means the passengers who were sitting only in the middle part of the plane crashed on the same part of the island as they did. Jack says they need to find the cockpit and if it's intact they might be able to find the transceiver, which they would use to send out a signal and help the rescue team find their location.

In the next scene, in the night, everyone witnesses strange sounds & voices and some movements behind the weeds in the jungle. They keep wondering about it not being able to imagine what it could be.

The next day, Jack, Charlie and Kate head off to their expedition to find out the front part of the plane. Eventually they do it so. They see one of the pilots is still alive. Jack tells him that it's been sixteen hours since their crash. The pilot informs Jack that their radio went down six hours in and they had turned back to land in Fiji. But by the time they hit turbulence they were thousand miles off course. So, if anyone might be looking out for them, they were looking in the wrong place.

They find the transceiver in the cockpit. But before they would have any use for it, they hear a mysterious and apparently, frightening sound from outside the plane. They get scared wondering about it. Jack tries to look outside through the glass window. The frightening sound continues. 'The mysterious thing' catches the pilot and kills him off. His blood splatters all over the front glass of the cockpit. Jack, Charlie and Kate take off immediately from the plane, back to the beach where they'd come from. After having lost sight of each other for a while, eventually they meet in the jungle. Charlie spots a hideous scene when he sees a dead body lying on the uppermost branch of a tree. The Episode Ends."

Charlie keeps asking Jack whether its working. Jack annoyingly says no. Charlie says to Kate that he is a coward and that every trek needs one. However, Kate does not agree with him and she says he is not a coward. Then the scene flashes back on the plane just before the crash. An air hostess comes up to Charlie and asks him whether he needs anything. He refuses. She suspects that something is wrong with him (All Charlies uneasiness indicates that he is an addict and desperately needs to hit on a drug) and conveys the same message to her superiors on the plane. Charlie turns back to see this and suspects that he might have some trouble. So, he gets up and starts to walk towards the toilet in the plane and manages to get in before the authorities have the chance to catch him. The staff crew insists Charlie that he opens the door as they have strong suspicions that he is inside hitting on a drug. At the same time, the plane shakes up a bit, apparently it had hit turbulence (the one the pilot mentioned in the first episode) and is about to crash.

Back on the beach, we see Shannon (Maggie Grace) lying down in the sun. Her brother Boone asks her whether shed want to give them a hand to sort the clothes. She refuses saying that they are wasting their time and help is on the way.

Michael (Harrold Perrineau) runs into Sun and Jin who is catching fish on the beach and he asks Sun whether shed seen his boy Walt (Malcolm David Kelly). Apparently, Jin doesnt like his wife talking to stranger men and tells her to fasten her top button. Michael gets the idea and walks off to find his son. Walt is looking out for his dog Vincent in the jungle. He finds a pair of handcuffs on the ground. Eventually Michael finds him out and reminds him that he told him to stay on the beach.

On the beach, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) are fighting over something. Michael had showed the handcuffs which Walt had found in the jungle to the people on the beach. Sawyer mistakenly assumes that it was Sayid who was handcuffed on the plane and that is why he was sitting in a back row with his hands underneath a blanket, supposedly, to hide the handcuffs on his wrists. Jack interferes in their fight and succeeds to break it. Kate watches the scene but doesnt confess that it was her who was handcuffed on the plane and not Sayid. She then changes the subject and tells everyone that they have found the transceiver but its not working. Sayid seems to be the only technical person who could get the transceiver working again. He says he needs some time to do it.

Sun approaches Kate and tells her in Korean (Kate understands it in English) that she is wanted back on the beach. She goes back and talks to Sayid. Sayid says that they are not picking up a signal. But he insists that they should want to see the bars on the radio which suggest that they are getting a reception and if a boat happens to pass by it might pick up their distress call, but that would be a waste of battery as not much of it is left. He suggests that they could try to get a signal from high ground.

Kate approaches Jack to tell him that Sayid has fixed the transceiver and she is going with him on high ground to send out a signal. Jack reminds her of their horrendous experience of the previous night that the mysterious thing (that killed the pilot) would still be out there. He warns her to run if she sees or hears anything.

Shannon and Boone (Ian Somerhalder) had a fight. Boone doesnt like Shannon to stare at the dead bodies and being worthless. She gets angry over this and tells Boone that she is going on the hike with Sayid and Kate. Charlie, Boone and Sawyer also join them.

While they are heading towards the mountain top, Sayid and Sawyer have a brief argument over whether they should be turning on the radio to check if they are getting any reception. Sawyer wants it to check it and Sayid insists that they should check it once they reach the top lest any battery should get wasted. The argument is about to get heated up when they again hear the strange noise. Charlie thinks that 'the mysterious thing' is getting towards them, apparently, to attack them. Kate also shares the same view and starts to run away from the scene with everyone else except Sawyer. Sawyer stands still in the jungle to take the bull by the horns, whatever it is. He points out the gun in the direction of the sound and shoots a couple of bullets. He finds that the thing they were wondering about at that time turned out to be a polar bear. The polar bear lies in front of him taking its last breaths. Boone asks Charlie whether he thinks it was the same bear that killed the pilot in the cockpit. But Charlie says that it is just a tiny version what that thing could have been. Everyone speculates over whether it was a polar bear. Kate asks Sawyer where did the gun come from and he answers her back that he found the gun on one of the bodies. He also finds a U. S. Marshal badge and shows that to everyone. Earlier Sawyer had accused Sayid to be the US Marshals prisoner and this time Sayid accuses him back to be the prisoner which the U. S. Marshal was bringing back to the states. Both are suspicious about each other. Kate rips the gun off Sawyer and takes it apart to avoid any future trouble amongst them.

The scene again flashes back to the plane just before its crash. The US Marshal gets heavily hit by a falling bag on his forehead. It draws a lot of blood. He gradually falls unconscious. Kate gropes for a key to her handcuff in the marshals jacket pocket and finds it. She manages to free her hands off the handcuffs. At that moment we see the tail end part of the plane broken off about which Kate had told Jack in the first episode that she could not bring herself to look back at it.

Back on the beach Jack is treating the US Marshal and he abruptly regains consciousness. Jack gets furious that now the Marshal has regained consciousness, he will have to suffer through that excruciating pain. Instead Marshal grabs his collar and asks him whether Kate was.

The group reaches higher on the mountain and Sayid turns on the radio. He says hes got a bar on the radio but all they could hear from it is static. Sayid says that they are not able to transmit a signal because they are getting disturbance as someone else is also trying to transmit a signal from somewhere very close to them. Then they hear someone talking on the radio. Apparently the person on the phone is speaking French. Only Shannon amongst them understand French. So they request her to translate that to them. She says that the person on the other line (which is a woman) is saying that everyone with her has been killed. The thing has killed them and she is the only survivor. Sayid realizes that it is a iteration (same message repeated over and over) and kind of a distress call. Sayid says that number they heard on the phone indicate that the number of times the message has been played on. He does the counting and comes up with an answer that the message, which is a plea for help, has been playing for 16 years. That means the distress call which they are hearing now has actually been placed sixteen years back. Boone suspects that someone else is also stranded on the island. Kate says that the rescue team may have come for them. Saywer says that if the rescue team is already there which has come for the people who have placed the distress call, then why the message is still playing. Charlie wonders what exactly is the place they are stranded on.

He warns Jack not to trust her. He asks Jack where are his handcuffs (which he had put on Kate) and suddenly realizes that he'd the keys to it in his Jacket pocket and asks Jack to look for it in it. Jack immediately checks his jacket pocket and finds out a mug shot which shows that Kate is a criminal.

As it was getting dark, the group decides to camp the night out in the jungle. Sayid explains everyone what exactly had happened during the flight. The pilot had lost communication with the ground which compels him to turn around the plane to land in Fiji. However, this was not communicated to passengers. (Because the pilot assumed that he'd safely land the plane) As the plane crashed 1000 miles off course, there is but very less chance that the rescue team would locate them. Sawyer suggests that they should be talking about the other thing on the island and the French woman who said ""they are all dead."" instead of how the plane got crashed. The group debates whether to tell the people back on the island of what they've heard. Sayid makes his point that if they told the truth without fully understanding it, it may cause a panic and people might lose hope that they would ever be rescued off the island.

Back on the beach Hurly gets his hands laid on the paper which has Kate's mug shot as a criminal. So now apart from the US Marshal only two people know that Kate is a criminal - Jack and Hurley.

At the night camp, Boone surreptitiously tries to steal the gun from sleeping Sayid. He wakes up and asks him what he was doing. He just says that he is standing guard. The group decides that Kate should keep the gun.

The scene flashes back to Australia where Kate is sleeping on a part of a farmhouse. The farm owner Ray Mullen wakes her up and asks her why she is trespassing on his property. After listening to her story, he offers her to give a place to stay if she helps him out with some chores his wife had left him before she died. She accepts willfully and stretches her hand out to shake his. But he tells her that he is a lefty. Kate notices that he has a prosthetic right hand.

The group comes back on the beach and Sayid is filling everyone in on what happened on the mountain top. He says that they need to organize three separate groups for water, electronics and rationing food. The group had decided earlier not to tell anyone about the distress call by a French woman. However, Kate feels obliged to tell Jack about it and she does tell him. Kate asks about the condition of the US Marshal unaware that Jack now knows about her. Jack decides to play along with her for a while. Next, Jack tells Hurly that the Marshal is not going to get better unless they use some stronger antibiotics. Jack suggests Hurly that they should look for more antibiotics through the luggage in the overhead compartments in the plane. Jack goes in the plane to look for more medicines, but apparently Sawyer has beat him to it except that he is looking for different things. (eg. booze and smoke)

Kate introduces herself to Hurly and asks about Jack. Hurly notices a gun tucked in at the waist of her jeans in the back and gets scared remembering that she is a criminal. He almost runs away from her in fear which leaves Kate wondering about it.

In a flashback, Kate tries to sneak away in the middle of the night from the farm when Ray catches her. He requests her to leave in the next morning which she accepts. Actually, Ray had found about her when he had seen her picture in the post office. He makes her that request because he intends to turn her over to the police the next morning and win the reward of $23,000 grand. He tactfully disguises his intention and drives her off. Kate spots a vehicle which apparently was following them and immediately realizes that Ray has got to know about her and suspects his intentions. We see the US Marshal in the vehicle who makes a gesture of a bullet shoot meaning that she's got caught.

Michael doesn't like his son to be hanging around with lock. But Walt considers him as his friend. Michael goes into the jungle to find Vincent out for Walt. In the weeds, he hears a growling sound there and starts to run off back to the beach. On the way he runs into Sun in an awkward situation and walks away back towards the beach.

Sawyer comes up to Kate and suggests her that she should put the Marshal out of his misery, because that beats the Marshal going through all that pain and them listening to him screaming all night.

In a flashback, Kate tries to steer the car away in an attempt to escape. But the car gets overturned and catches fire. Kate pulls Ray out of the car and drag's him as far as the road to save his life. The Marshal catches up with her there and she gets arrested.

Back on the beach, she walks into the tent of Marshal to talk and Marshal requests her to put him out of his misery. Though being a criminal she hesitates to do it and apparently Sawyer does that. Sawyer shoots the Marshal but misses his heart meaning the Marshal will now suffer even more pain until he bleeds out to death.

Michael had forbidden Walt to speak with John. However, John later extends an act of kindness towards Michael that may help the father-son relationship. Michael gets Vincent back to Walt as he sees the happy expression on his face.

The episode ends with John Lock's enigmatic look on his face."

(What John recalls) Before boarding on the plane John Lock happened to be a crippled person who moved in a wheelchair everywhere. However, after the crash he finds himself that he is able to move his toe. That's what he referred to as a miracle in the previous episode.

Now back to the present moment, in the night, everybody is sleeping when suddenly Vincent starts to bark which attracts everybody's attention. They hear some clattering sound in the plane. They wonder who it could be since all the bodies in the plane are dead. Jack takes out his flashlight and so does Sawyer. They head towards the sound in the plane. When Jack flashes the light on it he shouts everybody to run as three boars exit from the plane and run back into the jungle. By the look on John's face it seems that he seems to know more about the island than he lets it out on his face.

According to Jack, the boars were there to feed on the dead bodies. So, Jack proposes that they should get rid of all the 20 bodies in the plane to prevent reoccurrence of the boars on the beach and thereby making the beach safer to live on. He discards Sayid's idea to bury the bodies because the boars will soon sniff them out and the bodies would not remain buried for long. So the whole purpose of getting rid of the bodies gets defeated if they do not burn them. He suggests that they should wait till the sun goes down the next day as he intends that someone would see the fire in the dark and they might get rescued.

Sayid theorizes that if the French woman's message has been playing on the island for 16 years then there must be some kind of a power source on the island. So to find the location of the power source, he is making some kind of an instrument which is an antenna of a sort. He intends to point a few of those antennas on different parts of the island to triangulate the signal which will help him to know where the transmission is coming from.

Hurly and Sawyer are fighting over for the food left. Hurly tells Jack that whatever food they had, they had eaten it all. So they no longer have anything to eat. John Lock comes in and suggests they should now have to hunt for the sustenance. He opens the suitcase wherein there are quite a few knifes in it which they would need for hunting.

The scene flashes back to Johns life before the crash where he worked in a kind of a box company. But he takes a call which happened to be a personal one. His boss comes up to him and warns him about no personal calls from the office line.

John, Kate and Michael go on into the jungle to hunt the boars.

Shannon finds Charlie as he was about to hit on a drug. He immediately slips that into his hip pocket. They go together for a walk down the beach. Shannon wants Charlie to help her with fishing.

Boone spots Rose sitting all by herself for long time without having anything to eat or drink. He thinks she is having a hard time dealing with her husband's disappearance as he was also on the plane but landed on some different part of the island. She looks like she is praying for her husband's well-being. Boone is a kind of a think-gooder who approaches Jack and wants him to comfort her. Jack does try so, but Rose doesn't seem to be much comfortable making a conversation about it.

In the jungle, a boar attacks the three of them. Michael gets hurt on his thigh. John recalls his past events as he is lying down on his back. His boss doesn't seem to like him much. John hates to be told what he can't do. Back in the jungle, he tells Kate to take Michael back to the beach and he himself heads towards hunting down a boar. We come to know one of the traits of John's personality that he is very highly determined and a big believer in destiny.

Back on the beach Claire hands an envelope over to Sayid with his name on it. Apparently, it contains Sayid's girlfriends or love's photo inside it.

Kate climbs up higher on a tree to plant the transceiver to boost its signal. However, when she reaches to the branch when she takes out the transceiver to install, she notices movements behind the weeds and accidentally drops the transceiver down on the ground. Apparently, they return to the beach without having installed the transceiver because it gets damaged falling off from such a height.

Boone accuses Shannon to have used Charlie for food. Charlie feels a bit humiliated because it had never occurred to him that Shannon might be using him.

Rose and Jack are having conversation when Jack tells her that they are burning the fuselage in the plane and are holding a memorial service for the people who died on the island. He tries to convince her in a smooth way that her husband might be dead as he was in the tail section of the plane and insists that she should attend the service in memory of him. Rose refuses to accept that her husband is dead and applies the same logic saying that the people in the rear section must be thinking the same thing about them which leaves Jack thinking. Suddenly he gets a hallucination of his dead father standing under a tree.

When Kate had climbed the tree in the jungle and seen a frightening movement in the weeds and the direction of the movement seemed to be pointing towards where John Lock was headed, she assumes that 'the thing' must have gotten John Lock and tells the same to Jack. She also says that they couldn't save him because they had no time. At the same time Jack again gets the hallucination of his dead father standing at a tree and he races at him just to find John back with something for dinner.

That night a memorial service is held at the beach which is initiated by Claire and few words are said about the deceased even when no one seemed to know much about them.

In a flashback, John had booked a seat on a bus which was taking them to a walkabout. However, the officer in the insurance company cancels Johns booking at the eleventh hour looking at his crippled condition. He says that John misrepresented himself in order to be on that bus. John goes to great lengths in trying to convince the authority that though being crippled he is perfectly capable of doing that walkabout. But the officer refuses to believe in him and tells him they can't let him be on the bus and all they can do is to provide him with a transport which will take him back to Sydney. John gets furious that he missed his chance to do a walkabout and keeps shouting that it is his destiny to do so when the scene again flashes back on the beach, immediately after the plane crash when John miraculously finds his legs completely healed and thinks that it is his destiny which has brought him on the island. (Where now he can get his wish of doing a walkabout fulfilled, now that he can stand on his legs and walk)

The Episode ends with John's a bit satisfied look on his face to have gotten rid of his wheelchair."

But the boy who ad threatened him punches him in the face. But we come to know that Jack is a person who likes to help people in need.

Jack is very upset over not being able to save the drowing woman. He speaks it out this with Kate blaming himself for making a choice not to save her. Further in the conversation when Jack asks Kate whether she saw a man standing in the water (which is his father)> Presumably it turns out that it's Jack's hallucination as Kate didn't see anyone. Kate blames his halluciantions on lack of sleep and asks him about the same.

Sun and Jin are still keeping themselves apart from the rest of the group. Why Jin does not want to mingle with the others even in the desperate times is still not known. Sun tries to pursuade him to try a bit harder to communicate with the others in order to be in loop of what is going on. Jin seems stubborn to do that.

Hurley approaches Jack over the inevitable water crisis that they will be facing very soon. Hurley and Charlie are concerned over this and hpe Jack to help them all out. But Jack refuses to do anything about it.

The scene again flashes back to Jack's childhood (This is the continuation of the scene in at the start of this episode when Jack gets a punch in the nose) When Jack's father learns about what hapened, he tries to talk him out of trying to save everyone around him. Because in trying to save others, there is always a danger risking your interests. He gives his own example of a child who was his patient and who died despite his efforts to save him. But he says this incident did not affect him deeply and went on with his day as normal. That's what he expects from Jack i.e. not to be over emotionally involved in other people's lives.

As Jack recalls this incident in his mind, Boone approaches and demands an answer of making a choice of saving him over that woman. According Boone, he could have saved himself and he indirectly Jack of letting the woman drown to her death. As this conversation was going, once again all of a sudden Jack gets the hallucination of his father standing in the distance. He runs after him as his father goes into the jungle. This time Jack succeeds in chasing him and gets awstruck to see his father turnnig around to face him and says 'Dad.' The scene again flashes back to Jack having a conversation with his mother. Apparently, Jack's father has left the house and gone to Australia. The reason why he did this is unknown. But from theier conversation we could figure out that something happpend because of Jack which lead his father to leave them. Now Jack's mother wants Jack to bring him back from Australia. Why Jack ended up in Australia is revealed here.

Back on the beach Claire faints for no apparent reason. Charlie and others pick her up to a shelter and lay her down. Kate asks them to bring her water. At this point they find out that the water has been stolen. Kate and Sayeed take this problem to John Lock. He fears that when this news gets around there will be a chaos on the beach. But he offers to help and goes into the jungle to look out for the water as Jack is supposedly disappeared for the time being.

Jack goes after his father into the jungle when the scene again flashes back where Jack is now in Australia in a hotel where his father had checked in. He finds out from the hotel staff that the bed in the room in which his father had checked in has not been used for the last three days. Jack asks whether his father had rented a car, which he hasn't. Apparently there had been an incident with his father when he had to escorted to his room after having had too much to drink. So the staff member speculates that no rental agency would rent him a car in that condition. His eyes fell on his wallet and he gets a bit doubtful about his father's disappearance. Because no person would ever leave his wallet behind even if he is to run away somewhere. So Jack begins thinking what would have happened to his father and he is still clueless about his father's whereabouts.

Back in the jungle Jack continues to go after his father. He keeps seeing him and while in the process of chasing after him he gets hit by something and ends up hanging down by the cliff. Just as he was about to lose his grip, John shows up there from nowhere and saves his from falling to his death. Upon being saved by John, Jack having failed to figure out what exactly happened laughs.

Sayeed and Kate are having conversation when Jack approaches them. He has the information that the Chinese couple have one of those water bottles which had got stolen earlier. Sayeed goes to confron the woman and demands an answer as to where did they get the bottle. But they don't seem to understand English. Eventually Jin points it towards Sawyer telling it was him who gave them the bottle. Kate was just about to go to Sawyer to demand an explanation when Sayeed stops her because he sees no bottles within sight where Sawyer happened to be sitting. So even if they go to him they would not get any answer out of him. So Sayeed says that it would be wise to wait for Sawyer himself to lead them to the stolen water just a rat will always lead you to its hole. But it turns out that Saywer hadn't stolen the water. He traded the bottle with Mr Miyagi (Jin) for a fish.

In the jungle, Jack and Lock are having a conversation. Lock expects John to lead everyone because almost everyone on the island seems to look up to him as a leader. They treat him as a leader. Then Lock wants to know why Jack was there and he asks him the same. Jack tells him that he is chasing someone who is not there. (He doesn't tell him that he saw his father). Lock has had a complete change of attitude when he landed on his island. That's when he started to believe that there is something about the island. That is why he kind of believes what Jack saw may not have been an hallucination but actually the person himself. And whatever there has happened might have happened for a reason. Jack doesn't seem to be convinced by the theory, but doesn't also discard it. He then wants to join Lock to go look for the water, but Lock refuses.

That night as Jack is sitting by the bonfire, pondering over what Lock had said to him earlier about the possibilty that his father might be alive on this island. The scene then flashes back to where Jack had gone to id his father's body in a morgue. While looking back at this he confirms to himself his father was actually dead. He was about to start to break down when he hears some footsteps from behind him. He then picks up a log and goes after whatever was out there in the jungle. But he comes across a stream of pure water and by its side he few dolls fallen out of some luggage. Again in the flashback, the airport staff wouldn't allow him to take his father's coffin with him for want of proper documents. He tries to negotiate with the staff asking for a favor and finally manages to get the coffin put on the plane to LA. But back on the beach when he sees the coffin, he finds out that the body of his father is missing from it. He gets furious over this not knowing what to think."

The camera pulls back to reveal an overturned car and truck. A sheriff's cruiser pulls up and out steps Rick Grimes. The uniformed man cautiously examines the scene before approaching a gas station. More abandoned cars. Laundry. Baby dolls. Makeshift camp sites. A dead woman rots in one of the cars.

Grimes, who carries a gasoline canister, is looking for gas -- but a sign at the station reveals that there is none left. Suddenly, he spots a shambling figure in bunny bath slippers. It is a young girl. ""Don't be afraid,"" Grimes says. She turns -- a ZOMBIE! Grimes pulls his gun ... and blows her brains out. Welcome to the apocalypse.

FLASHBACK: Rick and his partner Shane discuss the differences between men and women while eating lunch in their cruiser. Rick talks of his wife Lori and son Carl. Apparently, the couple had a fight the night before. ""It's like she's pissed at me all the time and I don't know why,"" Rick explains to Shane. The pair then gets an urgent call.

A weaving car is being chased by cop cars. Rick and his men set up a roadblock. The weaving car swerves and FLIPS over and over before coming to stop in an adjacent field. Two bloodied men emerge from the wreck with their guns drawn. They FIRE. Rick is hit. The officers return fire and quickly take the two men down. Rick, who is wearing a bulletproof vest and has only been winged, believes it is all over. He stands up ... and is SHOT again. Turns out there is a third armed man in the wrecked car. Shane raises his shotgun and BLOWS the man away. He then turns his attention to Rick, who is BADLY injured. It doesn't look good.

CUT to the hospital. We see events from Rick's hazy point of view. Shane visits with flowers. Time passes ... but how much time? Sometime later, Rick awakes. The flowers are dead. The clock has stopped. He tries to move, but his legs have atrophied. He falls. ""Nurse, help!"" Rick cries. No answer. Rick manages to stumble into the hallway ... and discovers a complete mess. Gurneys, papers and equipment are strewn everywhere.

Worse: a hospital employee appears lying dead on the floor appears to have been almost completely devoured. A set of double doors, meanwhile, has been chained shut with the scrawled warning: ""Don't open. Dead inside."" Rick wisely backs away from the doors, which begin to bulge and shake. Something wants out. Rick retreats to a darkened room with a flight of stairs heading down. Using only a match to light his way, Rick eventually finds an exit door ... and is blinded by the light of the day. Outside, dozens and dozens of dead and rotting bodies are wrapped in hospital sheets. Rick is HORRIFIED.

Rick stumbles away from the hospital, finds a bicycle and races home. ""Lori!"" he cries. ""Carl!"" But the house is empty. Its occupants are long gone. Crying, Rick walks outside. Something approaches him from behind -- slowly. It's a non-zombie boy! The boy, Duane, swings a shovel and knocks Rick to the ground. The boy's father, Morgan, then rushes up -- and notices that Rick isn't a zombie, after all. Rick passes out from the blow.

For the second time that day, Rick wakes up in a bed unsure of his surroundings. He is tied to a bed inside a suburban home. ""Did you get bit -- maybe scratched?"" Morgan asks. Rick explains that he has ""only"" been shot. The trio then sits down for dinner and Morgan explains that the streets are crawling with ""walkers."" The process: bites kill you, a subsequent fever ""burns you out"" and, then, ""after awhile, you come back."" Duane then looks out the window at the walking dead -- and spots his mother! He cries ... and Morgan does his best to comfort his son. ""She died in the other room in that bed over there,"" he explains to Rick. ""I should've put her down ... I just didn't have it in me.""

The next morning, Rick returns to his home with Morgan and Duane. He notices that all the family photo albums are gone. Rick theorizes that his family fled after packing up their personal belongings. Duane says they probably headed to Atlanta, where the center for disease control and prevention is located. The trio then head to the police station to take hot showers (the station has its own propane supply) and collect weapons and ammo.

Rick then says goodbye to Morgan and Duane, who take their supplies to a nearby Jeep. Rick hangs around just long enough to SHOOT a zombie deputy he once knew before driving away in his squad car. Destination: Atlanta. First, though, Rick stops at an area park to put a female zombie -- cut in half and crawling pathetically -- out of her misery. ""I'm sorry this happened to you,"" Rick says through tears. He shoots her in the head.

Meanwhile, Morgan and Duane return home. Dad tells his son to wait downstairs before heading to the upstairs bedroom. There, Morgan takes aim at zombies in the street with a scoped rifle. He shoots two ... before spotting his wife. Shaking, Morgan takes aim ... but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. Zombie Mom shambles away. Morgan weeps.

Sometime later, Rick uses his police radio to see if anybody responds. Unbeknownst to Rick, a group of survivors does hear Rick's message (he can't hear their answer). It turns out that the group, which has made a camp in a field, includes Shane, Lori and Carl! Lori tells the group that they should've set up a roadside sign warning people against going to Atlanta, which is apparently crawling with zombies and completely unsafe. Shane tells her that they simply don't have time. She storms off to a tent. Shane enters to talk her down ... and the two end their conversation with a passionate kiss. Uh oh.

CUT to Rick, who comes upon a farmhouse where the inhabitants decided to shoot themselves rather than live in a zombie-infested world. Rick, who is looking for gas, spots a horse in the yard. He decides to ditch his cruiser and ride the steed. ""Go easy, OK?"" he tells the animal. ""I haven't done this for years."" Riding the horse, Rick soon approaches Atlanta. The city is seemingly empty -- save for crashed cars, empty Army helicopters and burned-out buses. Sure enough, zombies begin to appear.

Suddenly, Rick hears the sound of a helicopter. He spurs the horse to follow it -- and turns a corner into a side street PACKED with zombies. Quickly turning around, Rick flees -- and runs into another horde. The sheriff is pulled from his horse, which quickly becomes zombie feed. Rick then crawls underneath an Army tank and begins SHOOTING wildly. He then notices a hatch in the bottom of the tank and pulls himself into the belly of the steel beast, SLAMMING the hatch shut behind him. He crawls up against a seemingly dead soldier, and takes his gun. While looking away, the soldier comes to zombie life; Rick shoots him in the head just in time. Safe ... for now.

Inside the tank, Rick can hear the undead swarming all over the vehicle. He is despondent when, suddenly, a voice crackles over the tank radio. ""Hey you, dumbass,"" the voice says. ""You in the tank? Cozy in there?"" Rick's eyes go wide. Who is that?

Until next time, what is left of America ..."

Lori announces that she is ""heading out"" -- and tells Carl to stick close to Dale. ""If you see anything, holler,"" Dale demands. ""I'll come running."" So Lori heads into nearby woods to search for provisions. She hears a rustling. Nothing. She continues. More rustling. Nothing -- again. Lori is about to panic when ...

Shane appears OUT OF NOWHERE and drags her to the ground. They immediately begin to strip off their clothes. Shane momentarily stops when he sees Lori's pendant. She removes it -- and the two get back to making wild love in the grass.

Meanwhile, Lori's husband, sheriff Rick, remains trapped in a tank in the middle of Atlanta. Zombies swarm the military vehicle, but can't get inside. Inside, a voice comes from the radio. ""Hey, you alive in there?"" the voice asks. The voice then tells Rick that a side street is comparatively unpopulated by ""walkers"" -- and advises him to make a run for it. After a few deep breaths, Rick emerges from the top of the tank. He BASHES a zombie in the face, SHOOTS a few others and starts RUNNING. A young man suddenly appears (Rick ALMOST shoots the stranger) and diverts Rick down an alley.

The pair climbs a fire escape -- and the man, the voice on the radio, introduces himself as Glenn. They climb to the roof then double back through the building to the street. With zombies hot on their heels, Rick and Glenn make it to a department store, where a band of survivors await. One of the survivors, Andrea, is FURIOUS at Rick for firing his gun and attracting the undead. ""You just rang the dinner bell,"" she says. Sure enough, a horde of zombies has assembled at the entrance to the store. Suddenly, the group hears SHOTS.

They sprint to the roof -- and find Dixon shooting his rifle. T-Dog, who is black, accuses Dixon of wasting bullets. Dixon immediately uses the N-word -- as if he were just waiting for an opportunity -- and the two immediately come to blows. It ends with Dixon pointing a gun at T-Dog and declaring himself superior. ""Anybody else?"" the racist asks. Rick answers in the affirmative -- and BASHES Dixon in the face with a rifle. Rick then cuffs Dixon to a pipe ... the tosses the keys off the roof. Dixon HOWLS with rage.

Later, Rick suggests the group head for the sewers. Survivor Jacqui, who used to work in the city zoning office, explains that the building should have an access point in the basement. Glenn volunteers to head into the hole to scope out the situation -- and takes a flashlight and fellow survivor Morales with him. In the meantime, T-Dog and Dixon trade insults on the roof while the former tries to get somebody -- anybody -- on the radio. ""It's nothing personal,"" Dixon says. ""You're kind and my kind just weren't meant to mix."" T-Dog shakes his head -- and refuses Dixon's request to give him a hacksaw.

Glenn and Morales soon return from their sewer trip -- and explain that a steel grate blocks any chance of exit through the sewer. Even worse: the zombies outside have busted through the first set of glass doors. Only one final set of doors keeps them from entering the department store. So what now? Rick suggests a distraction. Andrea explains that the undead can smell the living. Apparently, their odor is distinct.

The plan: chop up a dead body of a security guard and smear his blood and guts on their bodies. -- thus, smelling like a zombie. It's as disgusting as it sounds, but the survivors get the job done with a big axe and rubber gloves. Glenn vomits. ""Do we smell like them?"" Rick asks. Says Andrea with a grimace: ""Oh, yeah."" Rick then tosses T-Dog a key to Dixon's cuffs (an extra set he had stowed in his pocket) and heads outside with Glenn.

Amazingly, the two blend in, passing zombies who sniff them before turning their undead attentions elsewhere. The other survivors watch from the roof. Unfortunately, storm clouds are gathering above. It's going to rain ... and possibly cleanse Rick and Glenn! T-Dog, meanwhile, continues to try to contact people on the radio. Although he doesn't know it, Shane's group of survivors can hear the calls -- barely. ""He said a department store,"" Lori says. As it turns out, Andrea is the big sister to Amy, who is traveling with Shane, Lori, Carl, Dale and others. Andrea volunteered to go to Atlanta to get help. Now, Shane tells Amy that her sis ""knew the risks"" -- and they won't be going after her. Amy, naturally, is FURIOUS. ""You sonofabitch!"" Amy tells Shane, who looks guilty as hell.

Rick and Glenn, meanwhile, continue to walk through the horde of zombies. Then it begins to rain. The guts begin to wash off of the pair. The zombies begin to smell something. Uh oh. A zombie ATTACKS -- and Rick BURIES his axe in the monster's brain. ""Run!"" Rick screams. So they do, eventually hopping a chain-link fence. As the zombies figure out how to climb the fence, Rick and Glenn hustle to a truck at a construction site. The keys have been left inside. They gun the engine and take off.

But they don't go far. Rick soon stops the truck and breaks into a nearby sports car, setting off the loud alarm. The plan: Glenn will drive the sports car to the front of the department store. The alarm will attract the zombies. Meanwhile, Rick will drive the truck to the back of the store and pick up the survivors. Glenn calls the group on the radio to tell them the details. But what about racist Dixon? ""You can't leave me here!"" Dixon screams. T-Dog hesitates ... but finally decides to free Dixon with the key. Alas, T-Dog trips -- and the key bounces from his hand and disappears into an open pipe. ""I'm sorry!"" a distraught T-Dog screams before fleeing the roof. Again, Dixon HOWLS with anger.

CUT to Glenn, who plows through a horde of walkers in front of the department store -- the car alarm BLARING the entire time. CUT to Rick, who backs up to a loading dock. Morales, Jacqui, T-Dog and Andrea jump into the back of the truck. Rick notices that Dixon isn't there. ""I dropped the damn key,"" T-Dog explains. Finally, CUT to Glenn, who RACES down an empty highway in the sports car. He lets out a triumphant YELL!

So everybody has escaped (with the possible exception of Dixon) ... for this week."

Merle, still chained to a rooftop in Atlanta, rants and raves almost incoherently. He seems to be talking about his time in the military. After a few moments, he appears to ""wake up"" at the sound of zombies beating on the door to the roof. ""Oh Jesus!"" Merle cries. ""I know I'm being punished ... I deserve it ... show me the way!"" The undead moan.

CUT to Rick and Morales drive though a town -- the former explaining that poor Merle has a brother named Daryl. CUT to the makeshift camp where Lori cuts Carl's hair while Shane watches. Shane promises to teach Carl how to catch frogs. ""We'll feed these folks Cajun-style Kermit legs,"" promises sudden father-figure Shane. Suddenly, Glenn drives up in his sports car ... followed by Rick, Morales and the rest of the survivors. ""Come meet everybody,"" Morales tells the sheriff. Andrea is united with Amy. Morales is united with his family. And, finally, Rick spots Lori and Carl. They EMBRACE.

After the emotional reunion -- one Shane watches with shock and confusion -- Rick cuddles around the campfire with his wife and son. ""I can't tell you how grateful I am to you, Shane,"" Rick says. If he only knew Shane and Lori had become more than buddies. T-Dog, meanwhile, wonders if Merle is still alive. He believes the lock on the rooftop door to be too strong for the walkers to break. Also: everybody in camp worries about telling brother Daryl, who is apparently away on a ""hunt."" He'll likely react poorly.

Later, Rick cozies up to Lori in their family tent. ""Baby, I really thought I would never see you again,"" she says. ""I'm so sorry ... for everything."" Yet she can't bring herself to reveal the details of her most recent affair with Shane. Rick then passionately kisses his wife. After a moment of hesitation, she kisses him back. Shane, meanwhile, sits alone. The next morning, Rick awakens and makes his way through camp -- when he hears a SCREAM. Carl has seen a zombie feasting on a dead dear. Rick, Shane, Dale and Glenn approach the monster and BEAT it to death (again) -- Dale finally decapitating it.

At that moment, Daryl returns to camp. He is angry that the zombie ate the deer he shot ... and takes his revenge via crossbow on the still twitching head. Andrea and Amy wince. Shane then pulls aside Daryl and gives him the bad news: Merle didn't return from Atlanta. Rick approaches. ""Your brother was a danger to us all, so I handcuffed him to a roof ... he's still there,"" the sheriff explains. Daryl is APOPLECTIC. He ATTACKS Rick, who -- with the help of Shane -- subdues the hillbilly. T-Dog then explains that he dropped the key down a drain. ""I'm going back,"" Rick tells Daryl. Lori hangs her head.

Shane tries to convince Rick not to go -- especially to save a jerk like Merle. ""I can't let a man die,"" Rick says. ""We left him like an animal in a trap."" T-Dog and Daryl volunteer, too. Glenn reluctantly agrees to join the team. But it's not just about saving Merle. Rick explains that he dropped a bag containing valuable guns, ammunition and a walkie-talkie. The latter he can use to warn Morgan and his son Duane against heading to Atlanta. After they leave, Lori attempts to comfort Carl -- whose confidence ends up comforting her.

Sometime later, Shane and Carl bond by catching frogs -- or attempting to anyway. Jacqui wonders why the women have been relegated to washing clothes. They then begin to mention things they miss about their old lives. Andrea mentions that she misses her vibrator -- and the ladies crack up. Their smiles disappear when Ed, Carol's moody husband, approaches. He tells his cowering wife that this isn't a ""comedy club."" Lori then reprimands Carl for leaving Dale's side, though the boy was obviously safe with Shane. After Carl leaves, Lori turns her ire on Shane. ""You stay away from me -- you stay away from my son,"" she shouts. ""My husband is back! He is alive! You are the one who told me that he died!"" Shane is distraught.

Meanwhile, Rick, Daryl, Glenn and T-Dog park their truck outside Atlanta. They opt to approach the heart of the city on foot. Soon, the foursome is inside the department store. Daryl SHOOTS a zombie in the brain with an arrow. Back at the camp, Ed's anger has escalated. He insults Andrea and then SLAPS Carol across the face. Shane, whose blood is already up, sprints toward Ed and proceeds to BEAT him mercilessly. Ed is little more than a blood pulp before Shane stops -- warning the wife beater that if he raises his hand to anyone in the camp, he will die. ""I'll beat you to death, Ed!"" Shane rages. Carol screams ... and runs to her badly injured husband.

Finally, the Atlanta gang arrives on the rooftop to find Merle missing ... or most of him. Turns out ol' Merle must've been able to reach the hacksaw. His severed hand remains on the roof, but the rest of Daryl's big brother has apparently managed to escape.

Until next time ..."

Their conversation, however, is strained -- the pair were born 12 years apart and don't appear to have much in common. They talk of their father, who taught them different approaches to fishing. ""He knew we were so different,"" Amy says. ""He knew you needed to catch the fish and I needed to throw them back."" The thought of their parents nearly brings both ladies to tears. It's a touching moment.

Meanwhile, the crew of would-be rescuers has just discovered Merle's severed hand on the Atlanta rooftop where he'd been left by the last exploratory group. Angry Daryl, who holds T-Dog responsible for his brother's predicament, aims his crossbow at the man. Rick, in turn, points his own gun at Daryl, urging the hillbilly to stand down... or else. The tension subsides somewhat, and Daryl picks up his brother's hand, wrapping it in T-Dog's bandana for safe keeping. The group follows Merle's blood trail... and discovers a few slaughtered zombies along the way. Apparently, Merle remains pretty handy at killing the undead -- even with one hand.

Back at camp, Jim determinedly digs a series of holes -- so determinedly that he ignores (or doesn't hear) Dale's offer of water. In fact, the survivor appears oblivious to everybody. ""Hey, Jim?"" Shane asks. ""I'm just a little concerned, man."" Jim continues to dig and -- after calling Shane's leadership into question -- takes a swing at the cop with the shovel. Shane tackles the digger and cuffs him. ""The only reason I got away was because the dead were too busy eating my family,"" Jim cries. The man is clearly unhinged.

Glenn is giving a detailed plan of how the rescue team will search the streets. The strategy covers all angles. ""You got some balls for a Chinaman,"" Daryl sneers. ""I'm Korean."" says Glenn. ""Whatever."" says Daryl.

The team then hits the streets, which are filled with walkers. Glenn is able to grab the bag of weapons left behind by Rick, but is then accosted by living members of a street gang! The gang members shove Glenn into their car and speed away. One of the gang, however, is left behind... and the young man is immediately corralled by T-Dog and a seething Daryl.

Back at the camp, Shane has tied Jim to a tree... for his own safety, of course. Jim apologizes to the children for scaring them. And why was he digging? ""Something I dreamt last night,"" explains Jim, who can't remember the details. He then urges Lori to keep Carl close. ""Never let him out of your sight,"" he says. Lori nods in understanding.

The rescue team, in the meantime, interrogates the captured punk, who refuses to provide any info. Daryl then shows the punk Merle's severed hand, claiming that it was he who did the cutting. The punk shakes in fear... and then talks. Moments later, the rescue team arrives at the hideout of the gang, which is led by a man named Guillermo. Rick proposes trading Glenn for the young punk, but Guillermo refuses. He wants the bag of guns. Only then will the gang surrender Glenn.

The rescue team retreats to their makeshift headquarters, where the guns are stashed. Not surprisingly, Daryl doesn't want to give up the guns... but Rick disagrees. The sheriff explains that Glenn saved him from the inside of a tank. Rick plans to return the favor. So, moments later, the team approaches the gang hideout for the second time. The young punk is bound and gagged as he is pushed inside at gunpoint where he is then freed.

""You have your man, I want mine,"" says Rick, who refuses to surrender the bag of weapons. Many guns are drawn and pointed when an old lady suddenly parts the crowd. She is the grandmother of one of the gang members. Rick assures the abuela that he is not there to arrest her kin. The old lady then leads Rick and the rescuers inside an attached old-folks home.

Turns out that the group is caring for the residents -- and are willing to fight for weapons and medicine to do so. ""The staff took off,"" explains Guillermo, who is a custodian at the facility. ""Just left them here to die."" The gang members act as security. Sympathetic, Rick then hands over a few weapons to help the cause.

Later, the rescue team heads back to their van... only the vehicle is missing. ""Who would take it?"" Glenn asks. Answers Rick: ""Merle."" Even Daryl winces -- his brother probably went back to camp ... for revenge. The crew heads off toward the camp on foot.

Back at camp Shane decides to free Jim so he can join the survivors for a fish fry. Everybody is enjoying the food and chatting -- Dale gives the group a Faulkner lesson -- when zombies suddenly attack the camp! Ed is bitten! Another walker takes a chunk out of Amy's neck! Andrea screams as her sister bleeds out. Shane opens fire. Morales and Jim bash zombies with bats.

Just then, the rescue team arrives for another rescue. They fire their weapons repeatedly as Zombie brain matter splatters the campsite. Suddenly, all is quiet save for a weeping Andrea, who hunches over her sister's lifeless body. ""Amy!"" she screams. ""Amy!"" The remainder of the survivors watch in horror.

Jim whispers chillingly: ""I remember my dream now... why I dug the holes."""

Rick hunches on a grassy hill overlooking Atlanta. He tries to hail Morgan on the radio and warn him. ""Atlanta is not what we thought,"" Rick urges. ""Do not enter the city. It belongs to the dead now."" The sheriff then gives the location of the survivors before giving up. No contact with Morgan has yet been made. Andrea, meanwhile, continues to mourn Amy, who lies dead on the camp ground. Lori approaches. ""We all cared about her,"" Lori says. ""We'll be as gentle as we can."" In other words, the body must be discarded. Andrea doesn't respond. Rick tries his luck -- and Andrea points a gun at him for his efforts. ""Sorry,"" Rick whispers then slowly backs away.

The clean-up continues. Daryl tries to drag one of the dead humans into a fire, but Glenn won't allow it. The humans are to be buried -- decent like. ""You left my brother for dead,"" Daryl growls. ""You had this coming."" Ouch.

More bad news follows. Jim was bitten in the skirmish. He pleads with Jacqui not to tell, but she announces his wound to the camp. ""I'm OK, I'm OK,"" Jim insists, but the bite is deep. He isn't OK. Naturally, Daryl suggests putting a pickaxe into Jim's head, but Rick protests, insisting ""We don't kill the living!"" Instead, Rick suggests the group head to the CDC -- on the off chance that a cure can be found. Nobody particularly likes the idea, but no one argues either.

Later, Dale has a heart-to-heart conversation with Andrea. He explains that, after his wife died of cancer, he didn't care about anybody until he met Andrea and Amy. Andrea is touched. She gently lays Amy's birthday gift -- a necklace and pendant -- across the dead woman's bloody neck. Carol, in the meantime, volunteers to sink a pickaxe into the head of her (abusive) dead husband. She does so -- and then does it again and again. Something tells us that Carol is working out past frustrations.

Suddenly, Amy opens her eyes. Is she alive?! Not exactly. ""Amy, I'm sorry I always thought there would be more time,"" Andrea whispers. Before Amy can bite into her sibling, Andrea puts a gun to her temple. ""I love you,"" she whispers before shooting undead Amy through the brain.

Later, Shane questions Rick's decision to leave the group and attempt to rescue Merle. It appears a power struggle between the long time friends could be brewing. But there's no time for a pissing match now. The group gathers to bury its dead (in spite of Daryl's repeated objections) -- and Rick makes a promise to his boy: ""I won't leave again ... not for anything."" Lori, meanwhile, questions the logic of going to the CDC on a ""hunch."" A decision will have to be made quickly, however. Poor Jim is looking terrible. The sick man coughs and spits into a bucket. Lori eventually opts to support her husband, telling Shane that they should trust Rick's ""gut."" Shane is visibly disappointed.

Later, Rick and Shane strike out into the woods to search for zombies. They argue over the best course of action. Shane is obviously upset for reasons (his affair with Lori in Rick's absence) that he doesn't mention. The two then split up in search of the undead. From a distance, Shane points his gun at his friend, but doesn't fire. The next morning, Rick tries Morgan again on the radio, explaining his plan to head to the CDC. Again, Morgan doesn't answer. Shane, meanwhile, explains how the caravan will work when Morales announces that he won't be coming. Instead, the survivor and his family will go to Alabama, where they have kin. ""I have to do what's best for my family,"" he explains.

So everybody minus the Morales family climb into cars, trucks and a camper and drive. In the back of the RV, Jim moans in pain. Naturally, they don't get far before the camper overheats. Shane volunteers to ride ahead to a gas station and see if a replacement part can be found. Rick then visits Jim, who asks to die. ""I want this,"" he says. ""Leave me here it's my decision."" Moments later, the group carries Jim to a nearby tree. Rick offers Jim a pistol, but the sick man refuses it. They then leave Jim to the elements.

Cut to a flickering video feed. A man introduces himself as Jenner, who drinks from a CDC coffee mug. He lives underground and searches for a cure -- but there has been no progress. End of transmission.

We then see Jenner, wearing a full contamination suit, studying samples of the undead flesh and listening to classical music. The man is exhausted -- and he accidentally knocks over a test tube. Alarm bells begin to sound. Jenner hustles to the door and it slams shut behind him. Suddenly, the lab room bursts into flames. A robotic voice announces that ""decontamination is complete."" Jenner hangs his head. His fresh samples have just been destroyed. No more tests. Still no cure.

Later, Jenner drinks wine. ""I think tomorrow I'm going to blow my brains out,"" he says into a monitor. ""But tonight I'm getting drunk."" The camera pulls back to reveal that Jenner is alone in a vast and high-tech underground facility. Outside, the land around the CDC is littered with corpses -- hundreds of them. The group of horrified survivors weaves through the bodies toward the door. Inside, Jenner spots the survivors on a security monitor. He is shocked. Rick looks into the camera and begs for help. Jenner hesitates, struggling with how to respond to the survivors' plea... and then finally opens the door from the inside."

Army troops open fire on a group of doctors and nurses. Zombies suddenly appear -- and take a bite out of the army. Shane ducks into a room where Rick lies in a coma. ""If you're going to wake up, you better do it now!"" Shane tells his friend. It's no use. Rick continues to slumber so Shane reluctantly leaves, blocking the door to Rick's room in the process.

PRESENT DAY: Rick, Shane and the rest of the survivors enter the CDC fortress. It appears to be abandoned when Dr. Jenner materializes from a dark corner. ""Is anybody infected?!"" Jenner demands. ""You all submit to a blood test. That's the price of admission."" Rick agrees. Jenner then leads the group underground and explains that the rest of the doctors are dead or gone. A computer -- which has a female voice -- has been his only company. Later, the survivors indulge in a few generous glasses of wine before Jenner introduces the group to its quarters -- complete with hot water!

Everybody has a hot shower and continues to drink, though it's clear that Andrea is not well. She vomits in the toilet and weeps. ""It's over,"" she tells Dale. ""There's nothing left!"" Dale prefers to see the end of the world (as they imagine it) as a chance to start over but Andrea isn't buying what he's selling. A drunken Rick, meanwhile, has a heart-to-heart with Jenner. Basically, the sheriff explains that the group didn't have any real chance of surviving on the ""outside."" ""It will all be OK,"" Jenner tells him unconvincingly.

A drunken Shane, in the meantime, confronts Lori. ""I'm going to tell you a few things and you're going to listen to me,"" Shane slurs. ""How can you treat me like this?!"" He explains that there was a massacre at the hospital and he had no choice but to leave Rick. Then it gets ugly. ""I love you,"" Shane says before aggressively groping Lori. She fights back -- and forcefully pushes him away, scratching his neck in the process. Ashamed and angry, Shane storms from the room. Lori tries to pull herself together.

The next morning, T-Dog makes powdered eggs for the survivors. Shane enters and tries to conceal the scratch marks on his neck. He offers a lame excuse about the marks being self inflicted. After breakfast, Jenner asks the computer to replay ""TS-19,"" a video record referencing ""Test Subject 19."" The test subject was bitten by a zombie and volunteered to have his process monitored. The group watches as the subject's brain synapses corrode and shutdown then flicker back to life during ""resurrection."" Essentially, the brain stem reawakens, but nothing else. ""The neocortex -- the human part -- that doesn't come back,"" Jenner says. ""Just a shell driven by mindless instinct."" Alas, Jenner knows almost nothing more -- and is nowhere close to finding a cure.

The replay concludes with what is obviously a bullet ploughing through the brain stem, ceasing all neuro activity.

Dale then notices a clock that is counting down to zero. Jenner explains that the basement generator will eventually run out of fuel. And what happens then? Nothing good -- that's for sure. Rick leads a group to the basement to check out the generators. They discover a bunch of empty fuel drums. Moments later, the air conditioning stops. Jenner, meanwhile, has shaved, combed his hair and put on a tie. He stares at a framed photo of his dead wife when the lights suddenly go out. The CDC is shutting itself down. Thirty minutes remain on the clock. Jenner then explains that the French were the last to work on a possible cure. ""They thought they were close to a solution,"" Jenner says. Unfortunately, the power eventually ran out just like it is now.

Panicked, Rick tells the group to pack their bags -- it's time to go. But Jenner seals the door, locking everybody inside. He explains that it would be pointless to run. The computer has locked all the exit doors on the street level. The CDC houses multiple strains of deadly viruses -- and is designed to make sure nothing escapes when power is lost. Basically, the facility will auto-self-destruct, killing everyone inside. Awful understanding dawns on the survivors' faces. ""It's better this way,"" says Jenner, who has resigned himself to dying in less than 30 minutes. ""It sets the air on fire. No pain.""

Shane and Daryl try to chop down the door with axes but it's no good. ""There is no hope,"" Jenner says. ""There never was - this is our extinction event."" Shane, however, isn't going to go down without a senseless fight. He begins shooting up the room with a shotgun -- making much noise, but accomplishing nothing. Rick wrestles the gun from his hand and slams his friend to the ground. ""Are you done?"" Rick asks. Responds Shane: ""I guess we all are."" After a moment of silence, Rick accuses Jenner of keeping secrets. The doctor then admits that TS-19 was his wife, who ran the facility. ""Your wife didn't have a choice, you do,"" Rick pleads. ""That's all we want: a choice!""

So Jenner opens the sealed door, but warns that the topside exits remain shut. ""There's your chance,"" Jenner says. ""Take it."" He then shakes Rick's hand and whispers something in the sheriff's ear. As the group rushes out the door, Jacqui and Andrea announce that they are staying. They would rather die an instantaneous and painless death than face the outside. ""This isn't what Amy would want for you!"" Dale tells Andrea. The rest of the survivors, meanwhile, have rushed to the front lobby. They desperately try to break the glass, but it withstands even a shotgun blast. Carol then pulls a grenade from her purse. Rick takes the grenade, sets it against the glass entrance and pulls the pin.

BOOM! The glass breaks, creating an exit.

Back in the command center, Dale continues to try to convince Andrea to leave with him. She refuses -- so Dale sits down. ""If you're staying, I'll stay, too,"" Dale tells Andrea. The group leaps outside -- and immediately begins shooting zombies. They head for their caravan of cars. Just then, Dale and Andrea emerge from the building. Both have decided to live, after all. There is suddenly a whine in the air. Time is up. The survivors take cover as the CDC structure implodes in an awesome bloom of fire.

A short time later, the group drives away from the destruction. A black cloud of smoke blocks the sun -- an ominous sight for our departing survivors."

As he sips, he stares at the wall that is empty except for a torn newspaper clipping advertising a Michigan land auction.

Later, Mike is shown having sex with a woman in a bathroom, who mentions that she cannot be seen with him when he suggests they grab food from the food court afterward.

In front of a class of college students instead of inmates, Mariam lectures about early colonial travel to the western part of the U.S. After her class, Mike approaches his mom. It is while still on the campus that Mariam tells Mike that his brother's wife is pregnant after punching and slapping Mike for his ignorance about the situation, right in public and surrounded by students. She suggests that Mike help Kyle make the right choice and take a different job away from the family business; one that is less likely to leave his wife a widow.

Meanwhile, Bunny calls Mike to get him to come over for a discussion, preferably with White Castle. Mike tells him that an FBI van is listening to their in-person conversations so they could just as easily talk on the phone, but agrees to come in person anyway. Bunny says that his guys inside want payment for their role in helping to kill the child murderer, but Mike pushes back. He tells Bunny that the guards are going to loosen up on things in the prison for a while but that no one can be asked for these specific favors. It's clear that both Mike and Bunny are figuring out how to deal with the aftermath of the guards sanctioning an inmate's murder and how to navigate who owes what as a result.

Meanwhile, Mike receives a call from Pete ordering him to put his crew at the top of the line for handouts after their involvement in the prison murder. When Mike calls into his own office to let his assistant Rebecca know he won't be in, he learns that there's only one person waiting for him. After they hang up, this sole visitor is revealed to be Iris, the sex worker that Milo called into Kingstown from New York. As she leaves, Iris tells Rebecca that she's beautiful, a kind deed for what must be thankless work.

When Mike arrives at Pete's office, he throws a trash can through the plate glass window to announce his presence. Mike tells Pete, as he told Bunny, that there are no favors. The guards will loosen things up but there's no list of people getting handouts for their involvement.

Back at his cabin, Mike smokes while the bear that once brought him so much fear sniffs around the fake bear that Mike used for arrow target practice. Mike promises that the fake bear isn't meant to be him, but the bear runs when Kyle drives up. The two brothers sit on the porch drinking and talking about Kyle's future. Kyle is hesitant about accepting the safer job offer in Benton Harbor, and as much as he and Mike always talk about getting out, he thinks this opportunity may not be the right one.

Back at the office, Rebecca reminds Mike that for them to stay in business and pay their bills they have to take on clients. Mike hasn't been in for days and Rebecca worries that it's because Mike's been taking things personally. She also suggests that starting his day with alcohol in his coffee sets a bad precedent. Mike tells her that he's not as good at this job as Mitch was but that he'll work on bringing in more money, but what he puts in his coffee doesn't concern her.

Later, Mike meets with one of his prison guard friends to let them know what the inmates and gangs are requesting as favors. To remind everyone of the easy treatment they've been getting as thanks, the two hatch a plan to tighten everything back up in the prison.

Mike then heads to the Kingstown police department to get an address for Carlos Jimenez to get in touch with the Mexican gang.

At the women's prison, Mariam is heading to teach a class when a fight breaks out between inmates in the hallway. While the guards deal with the fight, Mariam is stuck in the classroom with the previous class' Black instructor and the two seem to butt heads about whether this is an inconvenience for the instructors or the sign of something much worse.

Finally, Mike makes it back into his office and Iris gets a chance to meet with him. She tells Mike that Milo wants to make up and offers him sex as amends. Mike gets angry at the prospect and tells her that this town is full of wolves that will destroy her. He turns her down but has her tell Milo that they had fun. That night, Mike heads to the dog-fighting setup where Carlos has been hanging out. He learns that Carlos was picked up on a warrant for nearly $4,000 of unpaid child support. The police will hand Carlos over to Mike if he makes the not-insignificant payment. After making Carlos' bail, the two discuss reining in the favors and requests coming from the Mexican gang.

When Mike calls Kyle, he finds that Kyle is at a pizza place that's being cased for robbery. Kyle has Ian come through the back door to take out what they think is an addict who's about to rob the place; but, when the owner opens fire on the police officers, they have to take him down instead."

In Lawrence, Kansas, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound coming from her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure standing over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, John (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean. Twenty-two years later, Sam (Padalecki) and his girlfriend Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki) celebrate his high LSAT score. Later that night, Dean shows up at Sam's home. Though the brothers have not spoken in years, Dean comes looking for help in finding their father, who disappeared while hunting a supernatural entity. After Sam hears a voicemail from his father that contains electronic voice phenomenon of a woman saying, ""I can never go home,"" he agrees to help Dean in the search. The brothers head to John's last known whereabouts - the town of Jericho - where he had been investigating the disappearances of young men along a single stretch of road over ten years. Sam and Dean discover a local legend of a murdered girl who has returned as a homicidal, hitchhiking ghost. Research points to Constance Welch (Shahi), who jumped to her death off a nearby bridge after drowning her children. While they stakeout the bridge that night, Sam tells Dean he does not want to return to hunting supernatural creatures. He points out that finding whatever creature killed their mother - a task their father has dedicated his life to - will not bring her back. The two are interrupted by a ghostly woman jumping off the bridge. Sam and Dean later check into a local motel, and discover their father is also renting a room there. They break into it and discover his research scattered all over the room; all his findings point to Constance being a woman in white. When Dean leaves the room to get food, he is arrested by the police, who believe he is connected to the disappearances. At the police station, they show him John's journal, and he notices the message ""Dean 35-111"" written inside it. As Dean is interrogated, Sam tracks down Constance's husband (Steve Railsback), and learns the locations of both her grave site and the house in which she drowned their children. Sam then fakes a 911 call so Dean can escape the station. However, Constance targets Sam in his car; she attempts to seduce him and requests he take her home. Sam acquiesces, and she attacks him once they arrive at her old house. Dean forces her to temporarily dissipate by shooting her with rock salt, and Sam uses the opportunity to crash the car into the house. Constance reappears and attacks them, but the spirits of her children confront her. They embrace their mother, and the family disappears. Dean deduces John's message was coordinates to where he has headed. Sam still does not want to join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment.

Aboard the plane, he asks his seatmate how long they have been in the air, and when she says forty minutes, he casually gets up and opens the emergency exit door, causing the plane to crash.

Elsewhere, Sam (Jared Padalecki) awakens Dean (Jensen Ackles) early in the morning, and when Dean pressures him, he admits he hasn't been sleeping and has been suffering nightmares about Jess and about the job. Dean, on the other hand, says the job doesn't bother him. He receives a phone call from a man, Jerry, whom he and John once helped with a poltergeist. He asks for their help and they go to see him, and he explains about the plane crash and plays a recording from the cockpit, including strange sounds that could be EVP (electronic voice phenomena). They learn that seven people survived the crash, including Jerry's friend, the pilot, Chuck Lambert. When they analyze the footage further, they hear an unearthly voice saying ""no survivors,"" and they discuss various stories of spirits and omens on ships and planes. They go to visit one of the survivors of the crash, a man named Max who has checked himself into a psychiatric hospital, and he admits that he saw the black-eyed man open the emergency door, even though such a thing should be physically impossible. They next visit the widow of man who opened the door, and she says that her husband had had a fear of flying, but can think of nothing else strange to tell them.

Using fake Homeland Security badges (and newly-purchased suits), Sam and Dean gain access to the wreckage of the plane and find a strange substance on the door handle of the emergency exit, which turns out to be sulfur, leading them to realize that they are dealing with demonic possession. At the same time, the pilot, Chuck Lambert, flies a twin-engine plane with a friend to regain his confidence, but he is possessed by the same energy and deliberately crashes the plane forty minutes into the flight. Jerry calls Sam and Dean and tells them of Chuck's death, and they realize that the forty-minute mark is Biblically symbolic. They remember the voice saying ""no survivors"" and realize that the demon is going after those who survived the first crash. Dean calls them all and confirms that they are not flying any time soon, except for one woman, Amanda, a flight attendant. The brothers speed to the airport and make a phony phone call to delay her next trip, but it fails and she gets onboard. Knowing the demon will go after her and presumably kill all of the other passengers in the process, Sam says that they have to get on the plane as well and exorcise the demon, but Dean is hesitant and finally reveals his fear of flying. He gives in, however, realizing they have no other choice.

Once on the plane, Dean attempts to keep himself calm (""Are you humming Metallica?"") as they speculate as to which person the demon is possessing. They guess that it is Amanda herself, but when Dean tests this theory by saying the Latin word ""Christo"" in her presence, he realizes it is not her. He uses his homemade EMF meter to check the other passengers, and soon discovers that it is the co-pilot who is possessed. They talk to Amanda and explain the connection with her other crashed flight, and convince her to help them by summoning the co-pilot to the back of the plane. Once he is there, the boys overtake him with holy water and Sam attempts an exorcism from John's journal, but is briefly distracted when the demon taunts him about Jess' death. They finally manage to extract the demon from the man's body, but it quickly goes into the vent and overtakes the plane. As it speeds towards the crowd, the passengers--and Dean--panic, but Sam manages to finish the incantation and sends the demon back to Hell, causing the plane to right itself in the air. Once on the ground, the police take statements from the passengers, and Sam and Dean leave quietly. Sam asks how the demon could have known about Jess' death, but Dean just tells him that they can read minds and often lie. Jerry thanks the boys for their help, and Dean asks how he got his new cell phone number. Jerry says that John provided it, and the brothers call their father yet again and are shocked to hear a new outgoing message, confirming for the first time that he is still alive and has possibly disappeared on purpose."

She does it and nothing seems to happen, but she does not notice a gaunt specter appearing in the mirrors around her house. Later that night, her older sister, Donna, returns home to find their father dead on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood.

Sam (Jared Padalecki) is still experiencing nightmares about Jessica's death as he and Dean (Jensen Ackles) arrive in Toledo to investigate the man's death. They bribe the coroner and inspect the body, learning that his eyes seemed to have liquefied and his skull was filled with blood, leading the doctors to suspect a bizarre stroke. They go to the Shoemakers' home and talk to the daughters, and Lily tells them about playing Bloody Mary and blames herself for the death, but the brothers tell her it was not her fault. Privately, however, they agree that the legend could be true and wonder why the spirit attacked the father and not the person who said the incantation. They attempt to research the widespread legend, but have a hard time pinning down the exact truth of the story, as there are many versions. Elsewhere, Donna's friends discuss Mr. Shoemaker's bizarre death, and one girl, Jill, laughs at the suggestion that the Bloody Mary legend could be true, and says the name three times into a mirror. At first nothing happens, but then her reflection speaks to her and says ""you killed that boy,"" and she begins to bleed from the eyes and dies. Jill's friend, Charlie, calls Sam and Dean in a panic and tells them what happened, and with her help they sneak into Jill's house to investigate. Using a blacklight, they find a bloody handprint and a boy's name, and they learn that the boy died in a hit-and-run accident, in which the description of the car matched Jill's.

At the Shoemakers' home, the brothers find another handprint and the name of Donna and Lily's mother, and when they learn she died under mysterious circumstances, they begin to notice a pattern. They theorize that Bloody Mary attacks those who have a secret involving someone's death, noting the lore about mirrors revealing hidden truths. Further research turns up a story of a woman named Mary Worthington who was murdered in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Dean and Sam go there and talk to the detective who worked on the case. He tells them that they had a suspect, but nothing ever panned out. He explains that she was cremated and the mirror was returned to her family many years ago. When they call the family, they learn that it was recently sold to an antiques dealer in Toledo, and they guess that wherever the mirror goes, Mary goes, and that destroying it may break the curse. Back in Ohio, at school, Charlie begs Donna to believe her about the legend, but Donna dismisses her and says the name three times in the mirror to prove her point. Charlie begins to see the ghost's reflection in her classroom and reacts in terror, knowing that this means she is next.

Charlie calls Dean and Sam again and they hurry to her side, telling her to avoid all reflective surfaces. Dean asks about her secret, the one that would cause Mary to come after her, and she reveals that she had a boyfriend who committed suicide in distress over her leaving him. Later, Sam says that they should summon Mary by saying the incantation and then destroy her, and Dean realizes that he is still blaming himself for Jess' death. He tells him that it was not his fault and won't work anyway, as he knows all about it and it is not a secret, but Sam says there is more to the story that he does not know. They break into the antiques shop where the mirror is held, and, armed with a crowbar, Sam says ""Bloody Mary"" three times. Cops arrive outside and Dean goes to fend them off, leaving Sam alone. He starts to smash the mirrors around the room, but he begins to bleed from his eyes, and his reflection addresses him, saying that he truly is to blame for Jess' death because he had nightmares about her demise for weeks prior to it happening, but did not try to save her. At the last second, Dean rushes in, smashes the mirror and helps Sam out of the shop. Mary crawls from the frame and attempts to attack them again, but Dean shows her her own reflection in another mirror, and it speaks to her and accuses her of all the murders she had committed, and she vanishes, the curse broken.

Sam and Dean visit Charlie again and assure her that it is over, and Sam encourages her to forgive herself about her boyfriend's death. In the car, Dean asks Sam to explain the rest of the truth about Jess, but he declines, saying that some things are private. As they drive along, he briefly sees an image of her, watching him sadly from the side of the road."

As they free her, she tells them that her attacker is in the next room, and when they pursue him, it is revealed to be none other than Dean Winchester ().

One week previously, Sam () receives an e-mail from a college friend, Becky, saying that her brother Zach was arrested for murdering his girlfriend, but that she is sure he is innocent. Despite Dean's doubts, the brothers immediately travel to St. Louis and meet up with the girl, who swears that Zach was with her at the time of the murder and says he could not have been in two places at once. Sam lies that Dean is a detective, and they go to investigate the crime scene, where they learn that someone broke in and stole some clothes prior to the murder, and that there was no sign of forced entry. Rebecca admits she stole the security tape that seems to prove Zach's guilt, and when Dean and Sam watch it, they notice that Zach's eyes flare unnaturally in the cameras glow, suggesting that it is not really him.

Elsewhere, Zach spies on a happy young couple. Later that night, the man returns to his home to find his wife tied up and bloodied, and she pleads with him not to hurt her ""anymore."" When he explores the house, he encounters someone that looks exactly like him, who then knocks him out. As Sam and Dean look for a trail at Zach's house, they see the ambulance speeding by and learn about the couple's case, extremely similar to Zach's, in which the alleged perpetrator was in two places at once. They speculate that they are dealing with a shapeshifter, and note that the trail ends abruptly, suggesting it either flew away or used the sewers. As they explore underground, they find disgusting piles of skin and blood, leading them to conclude that the shifter sheds when it changes its form. Dean states that a silver bullet to the heart will kill the shifter, and checks the arsenal in his car trunk. Sam receives a call from an angry Rebecca, who has learned that Dean is not actually a cop, and she tells them to stay away from her and the case. They continue searching for the shifter's lair and are ambushed by the creature in the sewers. They split up to try to find it, but when they meet up again, Dean's eyes flare momentarily, revealing that it is really the shifter. Sam catches on quickly and threatens to shoot him, but he hesitates and the shifter overpowers him.

Sam awakens to find himself tied up and demands to know where his brother is, but the shifter, still in Dean's form, seems to be ""downloading"" Dean's thoughts and memories as well as his appearance and tells Sam that Dean is jealous and resentful because Sam escaped the hunter life for college. The shifter then goes to Rebecca's house to explain about the lies, and ends up telling her part of the truth about the shifter's existence, saying it is a creature that was ""born different"" and was hated until it learned to change form, and now just wants to be loved. He makes a move on Rebecca, but she rejects him angrily and he attacks, tying her up like the other victims, and the police soon come and catch Dean in the act. He manages to fend off the cops and then escapes to an alley, where he begins his gruesome and painful transformation into another form.

Back at the lair, Sam realizes that the real Dean is captive in the room with him, and they manage to escape. They seen Dean's face on the news and realize he is a fugitive, and lament that the shifter has the Impala, as well as all the guns and weapons in the trunk. When the cops close in on them, Sam helps Dean escape and distracts them. Sam hurries to Rebecca's house to warn her--but Dean finds the real Rebecca in the creatures lair, revealing that the shifter has now taken her form. The shifter captures Sam and then takes Dean's form once again, planning to kill him, but Sam breaks free and they have a brutal hand-to-hand fight. The shifter almost overpowers Sam, but the real Dean arrives just in time and kills the shifter with a silver bullet, grimly looking down at ""his own"" dead body and taking his amulet necklace back.

As Dean and Sam prepare to leave St. Louis, Sam confesses the whole truth about his hunter life to Rebecca, and admits that his deceased girlfriend Jessica did not know about him, and she speculates that a hunters life must be lonely. It is revealed that the multiple murders were blamed on Dean, now presumed dead. In the car, Dean expresses the wish that Sam could have a normal life, but he dismisses this, saying they are both ""freaks."""

A young Coed is getting ready for a date. She deems her outfit is too Martha Stewart but no worries, her roommate comes to the rescue with a sluttier looking top. Now set for her date, heads out with her roommate chiming Dont do anything I wouldnt do to which she replies that there isnt anything she wouldnt do, to which she agrees.

On the date with a frat boy named Rich, he takes her to a dead end road to make out before they go to the party. He tries to get all touchy feely which she isnt comfortable with. While in the car we see the back of a man with a hook for his hand.

The young couple hears a scary sound, to which the guy must investigate. He sees a scratch appearing on the side of his car with no one in sight. The girl begs him to get back in the car, she then looks away and when she turns back to him, he has disappeared. She, of course, then hears scratching on the roof of the car, jumps out of the car and runs a few yards away, only to turn around and see, you guessed it, her date hanging upside down, dead, covered in blood. She then screams.

Cut to Sam and Dean discussing their father and how it seems he doesnt want to be found. Dean then shows Sam an article about the Frat boy who was killed. The article states that the sole witness says the attacker was invisible. This is enough for them to decide to investigate.

They first show up at the Frat house the guy lived at, and claim to be transfer students from another chapter of the same fraternity. Looking for a place to stay. Their new roommate tells them that Rich was a good guy and was starting to date Lori Sorenson, the local reverends hot daughter who is a freshman this year.

The brothers head over to the church and meet up with Lori after the service. She gives them the rundown of what happened, and the brothers wonder if it could be the source of the hook man urban legend. They look into arrests made in the town going back to the 1850s. They find one preacher from the 1860s who went off the deep end over his anger at the red light district and killed 13 prostitutes in one night. And guess what? He was missing a hand and had it replaced with a silver hook which he used as his murder weapon. And it all happened on the same road that the frat boy was killed.

The brothers head over to investigate the scene of the murder. Carrying their rock salt loaded shotguns (rock salt, as a spirit deterrent, wont kill a spirit, but will slow it down) are caught by the local sheriff. In the meantime, Lori has an argument with her Pastor father about her living in a house full of college girls who all want to party and drink. She says shes an adult and can take care of herself, and storms out of the car. In the house, she sees a weird scratch on one of the doorframes, but the girl inside the room is studying and doesnt notice anything. When Lori reaches her room, her roommate is asleep and not wanting to wake her, leaves the light off as she gets ready for bed and goes to sleep. The camera then zooms in on an ominous shadow hiding behind the bedroom door.

The next morning Lori wakes and sees a puddle of blood dripping from her roommates bed, only to find her roommate lying dead. So she screams and while she sees that, she sees writing on the wall arent you glad you didnt turn on the light. So she screams some more.

Dean and Sam are now walking out of the Sheriffs dept, where Dean talked the sheriff down to a fine, using the excuse that Sam was being hazed and that he was out hunting ghosts with rock salt. As they are walking away, the cops all come running out and jump into their cars, sirens screaming heading in the direction of Loris. The brothers drive by and see Lori sitting in the back of an ambulance. She sees them, as her father is asking the cops to let him take her home. The cops dont want to as she is now connected to two murders, but eventually relent asking the Reverend to make sure shes available for questioning.

In the mean time, Sam and Dean sneak around the back of the Sorority, and they climb to the second floor and sneak a peek at the crime scene. They recognize the scent of ozone which is a trademark of a spirit, thus confirming their theory. Sam also recognizes the symbol carved under the writing on the wall. Its the same symbol that was on the hook of the murderous preacher from the 1860s.

Normally their protocol would be to find his grave, and salt and burn his remains; unfortunately he was laid to rest in an unmarked grave, so no luck there. But they correctly guess that Lori has something to do with this entire thing.

Sam does some research and finds another clergyman arrested for murder in the 1930s, and in the 60s. Both men were openly preaching against immorality, and both men find themselves wanted for murder by what they claimed was an invisible force. All the killings were committed with a sharp instrument. They realize that Loris father doesn't want to save the whole town; he just wants to save his daughter. They think the spirit could be latching onto the reverend and feeding off his emotions without him realizing it.

They agree to split up. Sam will watch out for Lori tonight while Dean looks for an unmarked grave. Dean gets lucky and finds a headstone with the same mark on it as the wall and the original silver hook. After digging up the grave, he salts and burns the remains.

Sam stakes out the preachers house and witnesses an argument between Lori and her father about the Reverend being in love with a married woman, who is unhappy and going to get a divorce. Lori does not approve. As Sam sits in the dark, Lori comes out and talks to him, he tells her hes worried about her and just wants to make sure shes okay. She thinks thats really sweet but tells him he should run away from her as she seems to be cursed. Then tells him what she thinks about her father seeing a married man. Shes mad because she thinks its wrong, and she was raised believing that if you do something wrong you will be punished. Then she starts putting the moves on Sam. He kisses her back but cant do more, she correctly guesses its because of someone hes lost.

Her dad then interrupts and asks her to come inside; she angrily retorts that she will come inside when shes ready. Then the hook man appears right behind her father and stabs his hook into his shoulder dragging him inside. Sam grabs his gun and runs after. He chases up the stairs and shoots the dark figure with his rock salt loaded shotgun, saving Loris dad, the spirit then disappears for now. Lori comes running in after.

At the hospital, Lori is with her dad, as the sheriff questions Sam looking on. The sheriff tells Sam that it seems like every time he turns around Sam is in some kind of trouble. So try to stay out of it. Dean then shows up and gets Sam away from the sheriff. Sam tells him what happened including his conversation with Lori, and they conclude that the spirit latched onto Loris emotions, not the reverends. Dean asked why the salt and burning of the remains didnt work and they realize the hook was not buried with him.

More research shows the hook was donated to the church where it was reforged, but doesn't mention into what. Now night again, they go to the church and split up, Dean will search for anything silver in the church and Sam will search the house. Anything Silver goes into the fire.

As they are in the process of burning, they hear footsteps upstairs. They go to investigate and find Lori sitting on a pew in the congregation. Dean leaves to continue to burn silver. Sam comforts a weeping Lori. She knows shes to blame but doesnt know how, but shes read in the bible about avenging angels and thinks that she needs to be punished because its all because of her. The hook man appears once again they run, but the ghost just keeps coming. Sam is wonded and just when it seems the hookman is going to get Lori, Dean appears with his rock salt gun and fires, causing the apparition to disappear. They have a brief discussion about the silver that they must have missed something; Sam finally notices a silver cross around Loris neck. She tells them that her father gave it to her and it was a church heirloom. Sam rips it off her neck and tosses it to Dean. They hear the hook scratching down the wall. Dean throws the gun to Sam and heads down to the basement and throws the cross in the fire. Dean shoots at what he thinks is the ghost because its invisible again. Then frantically loads it again with one arm as the other has been injured by the hook earlier. Just as he has it loaded, he aims and has it knocked out of his hand.

The hook man stands over Sam and Lori about to strike, when the cross finally melts in the fire. The apparition then burns into ash and dust. Dean comes back and they are all safe.

The next morning Dean is being questioned by the Sheriff, he confirms that they all saw the man with the hook, that they scared him off and he ran. Then he reassures the sheriff that they are leaving town shortly. Sam is finishing up with the paramedic, and Lori comes to thank him for saving her and her fathers lives. She doesn't understand what happened but she does thank him. Sam then joins his brother in the car. Dean offers Sam that they could stay, but Sam just shakes his head and they drive off into the distance."

Oasis Plains, Oklahoma

A new housing development in the process of being build, two construction workers are speculating on how expensive these houses will be when they are done. One worker walking buy a creepy looking tree hears insect noises under the ground. As he crouches down to investigate, a hole opens up and he falls inside breaking his ankle. His coworker goes to find a rope while he sits in the hole in pain, he notices an unusual amount of beetles, and they start to crawl on him, he starts freaking out. Very shortly he is entirely covered. As he screams for his friend to help, his cries are getting more and more frantic. His friend finally locates a rope and returns to the hole. His friend isnt crying for help anymore, and as the flashlight shines down the hole, we dont see any bugs, just a dead body with blood coming out of his eyes, nose and mouth.

At a biker bar at night, Sam is reading a newspaper article about a local death being a mystery as Dean comes out having just won some money. Sam explains that this death in the newspaper says that the worker died of mad cow disease. The mystery is that mad cow disease takes a long time to develop and this workers brain degenerated in about an hour. They decide its worth investigating.

The brothers find Travis the other worker and claim to be the dead mans nephews. He tells the boys that the man was bleeding from his facial orifices, but there wasnt anything else strange. He then tells the boys where this happened and they head over. Sam goes down the hole and finds some beetles. There were only about ten, and there would have to be way more than that to eat out someones brain.

They want to investigate more by talking to the locals to see what they can find out. Low and behold, there is a bbq being held for prospective new buyers of the new houses. Yeah, free food! Dean observes that normal is creepy and hed take their family over normal any day. They meet the developer who assumes they are gay, the brothers correct him and say that their father is getting on in years and they are looking for a place for him. The developer explains that this area is so nice that he bought the first house for his family. They meet the developers wife, and their new next door neighbor who is head of sales. The wife makes a comment about the sales lady being a really loud neighbor. Linda Bloom, head of sales plays it off as a joke. She naturally assumes that the brothers are gay as well. Dean feels awkward and says hes going to talk to Larry, ok, honey? and smacks Sams butt as he walks away.

Dean is talking with Larry the developer about flooring options while they walk through the house. Dean sees a big jar full of insects. They belong to Larrys son who has a very inquisitive mind.

Sam and Linda are talking about pool options when Sam sees a tarantula crawling towards Lindas hand on the table. While the developers son looks on from a distance with a smirk on his face. Sam gently catches the spider, and takes it back to the sullen teenager that is its owner. Turns out Larry and his son Mathew arent on the best of terms.

Sam and Dean have a brief discussion on about their own father and how Dean was perfect and Sam, who just wanted a normal life, was always getting lectured. Then they discuss how this recent death wasnt the first strange death in the area, turns out one of the surveyors died of an allergic reaction to bee stings before ground was even broken on the development. More bugs.

That night as they are driving, they discuss the possibilities, they didnt see any signs of spirits, so that rules that out, but they consider that some person could be controlling the bugs like a pied piper. Mathew the developers son was into bugs. Maybe. In the meantime, Dean wants to try out the steam shower, so they break into a house. Linda is getting ready for bed, when a spider crawls across her face. She swats it away with discussed but continues with her routine, as she is in the shower a giant horde of spiders come out from behind the shower head, she screams and tries to run, only to slip and fall through the glass shower door. We see blood and glass shards on the floor, then a short trail of blood leading to Lindas dead body.

The next morning the brothers head to Lindas house and after the police leave, they break in to see if there is a bug problem. They find some dead spiders in a towel, and think that maybe its Matt. The spider boy. They follow him when he gets done from school into the wilderness area where hes looking at a praying mantis. They talk about how Linda died of spider bites, and Matt tells them there if it was him with the spiders, that doesnt explain the bee attack or the beetles. But there is something going on with the bugs in the area.

He shows them an area and tells them that hes been keeping track of insect populations for a science class and there is an unusual amount of insects. From beetles to earthworms, there is a large congregation of them just in this area. But he doesnt know why. They investigate a big pile of earthworms and discover a human skull. While taking the remains to a specialist at the college, Sam and Dean talk about their relationship with their father. Sam feels that his dad was always disappointed in him because he wanted to live a normal life and eventually left the family business to go to college. Dean didnt feel like Sam respected their father, and Sam never felt like his dad was proud of him. Dean said he was scared of what could happen to Sam, and that whenever he could he would swing by the college to make sure Sam was safe. Of course Sam never knew any of this.

The anthropologist they go to see tells them these remains are about 170 years old and seem to be of Native American decent. (Can you say, Indian graveyard?) He directs them to a tribe about 60 miles from the college, saying that someone there might know the full story.

They find an old Native American playing solitaire in a diner named Joe. Joe recognizes Dean as a liar, and Sam asks him if he knows of the housing development. He tells them that his great great great grandfather and the tribe use to live in that valley, and that the American Calvary came to relocate them. There was resistance and the Calvary grew impatient. During the night of the spring equinox, they came and murdered and raped. And they came again every night for 6 nights until every man woman and child still in the valley was dead. The legend is that the chief as he lay dying on the 6th night asked the heavens to not let any white man tarnish this land again. Nature would rise up and protect the valley, and it would bring as many nights of death to the white man as they had brought to his people. And on the night of the sixth day, none would survive.

Sam and Dean realize that the first man died on the day of the spring equinox and that tonight is the 6th day. As theres no way to break a curse, you can only get out of its way, they realize they need to get Larrys family out of the valley fast.

Mathew is out in the dark in the back yard investigating something on the ground, when a bunch of large cockroaches burst from it. He takes of running. Dean calls Larry pretending to be from the gas company tells him theres a big gas leak and their family needs to move out for at least 12 hours just to be safe. Larry knows this isnt the gas company, so Sam calls Mathew and tells him to get his family out of the house. He asks why, and Sam says, somethings coming. Dean tells him to pretend theres a pain in his side and make his parents take him to the hospital. Therefore out of danger.

Unfortunately Matt tells his father the truth, he thinks hes nuts, and are all still home when the brothers arrive. Larry angrily tells them to get off his property. They argue and then they hear it, A huge swarm so big and dark it almost blocks out the full moon. Its too late to run, so they rush into the house. Close all the windows, doors, fireplace, Dean puts towels along the bottom of the doors. Larrys wife tries to call the police, but the phone lines are dead. The insects must have chewed through the phone lines. Then the power goes out. Theres no signal on the cell phone. The insects are blanketing the house.

They wait with tension wondering what they are to do now. Sam says it will hopefully end at sunrise, hopefully. Dean runs to the kitchen and gets the bug killer spray, but it doesnt look like its going to do much good. Then they hear the bugs trying to get through the flue in the chimney, so they run upstairs just as they do as Dean lights the bug spray on fire as a bug killing torch. They make it to the attic, but just when they think its safe, the termites start making it through the roof. The brothers are able to patch the hole with some debris, but then theres another hole burrowed into the attic. The brothers try to fight them off, but its a losing battle. They can only huddle in the corner trying to cover their faces. Just when they think all is lost, its dawn and the bugs fly away.

The family decides its time to move. The housing development gets put on hold pending a federal investigation into the remains they found on the land. This is the biggest financial disaster Larry has ever faced, but seeing his family safe, he doesnt care. Mathew gets rid of his insect collection as they now weird him out.

As the brothers watch the father and son interact in a positive way, Sam says he wants to find his dad, to apologize to him for all the things he said. Dean says dad was just trying to do the best he could. But dont worry because they will find him, Sam will apologize, and within 5 minutes they will be at each others throats again. Sam laughs and agrees, and they drive off to find someone else to save."

Elsewhere, Dean () looks for cases while Sam () draws the same tree over and over, and suddenly realizes that it is the tree from outside their childhood home. He tells Dean urgently that they have to return to Lawrence because the new owners are in danger, and when Dean presses him, he admits that he dreamed about it, and explains how his nightmares sometimes come true, like in the case of Jessica's death. Dean is uncomfortable with the idea, but the nevertheless journey to Lawrence and go to the house. When she asks, Sam interrupts Dean's fabricated story and tells Jenny truthfully who they are, and asks the see the house for nostalgia's sake. She tells them about finding the old photos and invites them in, where they meet her children, Sairie and Ritchie. When the brothers ask, Jenny admits the house ""has its issues"" and explains about the flickering lights and strange sounds, and they understand that to mean that there is a spirit or presence in the house.

Outside, Dean and Sam speculate that the being in the house might be the same thing that killed their mother ) and Jessica (), and decide to continue their father's research into their mother's death. Dean calls John () yet again, leaving him an emotional message and begging him to come back and help them. The brothers then talk to an old friend of John's, a garage owner, who says that John became obsessed with investigating Mary's death and eventually consulted a palm reader for help. The brothers discover in John's journal that the psychic is named Missouri Mosely (), and when they go to visit her, it is immediately apparent that she is the real deal. She remembers Mary's death, but says she could not identify what killed her, saying only that it was exceptionally evil.

Meanwhile, the house continues to exhibit hostile energy, grievously injuring a plumber who comes to fix the sink. Later, the refrigerator opens on its own and when little Ritchie crawls inside, it closes and traps him there, scaring Jenny. Sam and Dean then bring Missouri to the house, and she reports that there is more than one spirit in the house because the house is now a ""magnet"" for otherworldly activity ever since Mary's death, and says that one of them is a malevolent poltergeist, although it is not the thing that killed their mother. She and the boys attempt to purify the house with the help of special ingredients, urging Jenny and the children out of the house while they work. They are soon attacked by the spirit, however, and Sam is nearly strangled, but Dean helps him and the purification seems to have worked, although it causes excessive damage and mess to the house. Jenny and her children return, believing the house safe, but later that night, Jenny's bed begins to shake violently, revealing that the poltergeist is still present. Sam and Dean, who were keeping watch outside just in case, run into the house and rescue the family, but Sam is trapped by the spirit. Dean breaks back into the house just as a fiery figure appears, but Sam cautions him not to shoot at it, and a moment later, it resolves into the form of Mary.

The boys are stunned to see her, and she smiles sadly at both of them before apologizing to Sam, banishing the poltergeist from the house and disappearing in a rush of flame. Later, Missouri says that Mary's spirit destroyed itself to get rid of the poltergeist, and she and the brothers leave Jenny and her family in peace. Sam asks Missouri if she can explain what is happening to him with his strange, prophetic dreams, but she admits that she doesn't know. Returning to her home, Missouri muses that even with his strange powers, Sam could not sense his father's presence, and it is revealed that John has been there all along. She urges him to talk to his children, but he refuses, saying that he needs to find out the truth about their mother's death first."

Later that night, one of the cops goes home and kills his wife, and then himself.

Elsewhere, Sam () and Dean () continue their search for John (), calling several of his known associates with no luck. Dean is surprised to receive a text message, which he assumes to be from John. He finds that the numbers in the message are coordinates for Rockford, and when he finds the news story about the policeman and finds mention of the old asylum in John's journal, he concludes that it is a mission and that John wants he and Sam to investigate. Sam thinks their time would be better spent finding their father, but Dean, used to following John's orders, says they have to work the case. They travel to Rockford and question the policeman whose partner killed himself and learn that the man was a good cop with a normal life, suggesting that something in the asylum turned him suddenly violent. They explore the building, particular the south wing, going off of a note in John's journal about previous deaths that occurred there, and they find evidence of disturbing medical practices. Sam tries to convince Dean again to forget the case and go after John, but Dean refuses.

The brothers track down the son of the former chief-of-staff at the asylum, Dr. Ellicott, and Sam questions him about the south wing during a phony therapy session. Sam tells Dean that the south wing housed the most dangerous patients, and that there was a riot in the 1960s during which many people were killed, including Dr. Ellicott, and that several bodies were left unrecovered, meaning that the building is probably full of vengeful spirits that will be destroyed if the bodies are found and burned. Meanwhile, two more teenagers, Gavin and Kat, break into the asylum for fun, and Gavin is surprised and kissed by a ghoulish figure, much to his terror. Sam and Dean arrive and get wild readings on their EMF reader, and are quickly confronted by a spirit as well. Dean quickly shoots it with rock salt, but Sam points out that the ghost did not try to hurt him and clearly wants something else. They find Kat and Gavin, who tell them of their encounters, and Gavin says that his ghost tried to whisper something in his ear. As they move through the building, Kat is suddenly grabbed by a spirit and forced into a locked cell. Dean tries frantically to free her, but Sam encourages her to listen to the ghost and hear what it wants. Kat manages to calm herself enough to hear its whisper, and when they free her, she tells them that it said ""one thirty-seven,"" which they take to refer to one of the rooms in the asylum. They attempt to help Gavin and Kat escape, but realize they are trapped by some force other than the patients that does not want them to leave.

In room 137, Dean finds Dr. Ellicott's old journals, which reveal some disturbing practices. Above, Sam receives a phone call from Dean telling him to come down to the basement, and leaves Kat and Gavin with a shotgun of rock salt for protection. When he goes to find Dean, however, he is grabbed by another spirit, which says it will make him ""all better"" and seems to send electrical shocks into him. Dean rejoins Kat and Gavin and says he never called Sam, and hurries off to the basement when he realizes that Sam was lured there by a spirit. He finds Sam, who appears to be fine, and explains that Dr. Ellicott was performing experiments on his patients and using rage therapy, but that it backfired and just made them more angry and violent. He guesses that the doctor's spirit is doing the same thing to anyone who enters the asylum, including the cop, and begins to search for the hidden room in which he performed his tests. Suddenly, Sam aims his gun at Dean, and Dean realizes he has been affected by the ghost. Sam shoots Dean with rock salt and rants at him about his blind obedience of John's orders, and Dean hands over his pistol and challenges him to shoot him for real. The gun is empty, however, and Dean overpowers him. He continues searching and finds Dr. Ellicott's corpse and prepares to torch it. He is attacked by the spirit, but manages to reach his lighter and burns the body, causing the ghost to disappear.

As they leave the asylum, Sam apologizes for what he said while under the doctor's influence, saying he couldn't control himself and didn't mean it. Dean shrugs it off, and they return to their motel. Early the next morning, Dean's phone rings again and Sam answers it--and it's John."

Sam gets him to the hospital, but the prognosis is bad - his heart is damaged and he will die within a few weeks. Sam desperately searches for a way to save him, including leaving a message for John. Dean checks himself out of the hospital, and when he turns up at the motel, Sam announces he has found a specialist in Nebraska who will be able to help. Dean is not impressed when the specialist turns out to be Reverend Roy Le Grange, a faith healer. As they enter the tent where Le Grange preaches, they pass a man protesting that he is a fraud, though Layla Rourke and her mother have faith in his abilities.

Dean and Sam take their seats in the congregation. On stage is Roy Le Grange, a blind man, and his wife Sue-Ann Le Grange. Roy picks Dean out from the crowd, and he reluctantly joins Roy on stage. As Roy and the congregation start to pray, Dean gets dizzy and then collapses. Sam rushes to the stage. As Dean comes to, he sees the figure of a cadaverous man next to Roy. The next day Dean is checked out at the local hospital; he has inexplicably recovered from his fatal injuries, but he feels a strong sense of disquiet. When the nurse mentions that the previous day a young healthy man died of a heart attack, Dean suggests that Sam check it out, while he goes to visit the reverend.

Sam talks to a friend of Marshall Hall, the young man who died. The friend says that Marshall felt he was being followed before he died. Sam finds out that he died at the same time Dean was healed. At Roy Le Grange's house, Roy tells Dean that he feels Dean has an unfinished purpose. As he leaves, Dean meets Layla Rourke and Mrs. Rourke. They are regular attendees at the services. Layla has a brain tumor, and Mrs. Rourke is bitter that Dean was healed rather than her daughter. Sam tells Dean about Marshall Hall's death, and Dean tells Sam about the man he saw as he was being healed - he thinks it was a reaper. Sam also identifies a particular type of cross from the altar in the church tent as one that could be associated with black magic which could be used to control the reaper.

That night Sam breaks into the Le Grange house to try and find a spell book or something that Roy is using to control the reaper. Meanwhile, Dean goes to stop Roy healing, and therefore killing, someone else during his evening service. Sam finds a book full of newspaper clippings, and surmises that Roy is killing people he sees as immoral, and that the man who was protesting in the parking lot will be next. He calls Dean and tells him to stop Roy. Before Dean can act, Roy calls Layla to the stage for healing. Dean is reluctant, but finally stops the service by yelling ""Fire!"" Sam tracks down David, the parking lot protester, but he says The Reaper is still coming for him. Dean then sees Sue-Ann, praying over the unusual cross they had identified earlier. When she stops, the reaper disappears.

Back at the motel, Sam and Dean work out that it is Sue-Ann controlling the reaper, and that there must be an altar at the house. They return and Sam goes to find the altar, while Dean finds a service in progress and Layla, again, about to be healed. Sam finds the altar in the basement and destroys it, but Sue-Ann discovers him, and locks him down there. She returns to the service to summon the reaper so Layla can be healed. The Reaper appears to Dean, and starts to take his life. Just in time, Sam appears, and smashes the cross Sue-Ann is praying over. The reaper is released and takes Sue-Ann's life. Layla, however, is not healed.

As they prepare to leave town, Dean is still disturbed that he was saved while Layla wasn't. Layla arrives, invited by Sam, and she tells Dean she has made her peace with what will happen to her. Dean says he will pray for her, which she calls a miracle."

The brothers are heading for Pennsylvania when Dean gets a call from an old friend needing help her father died the previous night. The girl, Cassie, was an old friend of Deans and Sam is surprised and upset that Dean told her what they do. When they arrive, Cassie and her fathers friend Jimmy both work for the paper, and are meeting with the mayor about the death of her father and another black man. The mayor isnt helpful. Cassie reports that there were only one set of tracks at each site, and no signs of a collision. Cassies mother arrives but is clearly upset. And out in the night, the black truck has run Jimmy off the road, killing him.

The Winchesters look into the accident the next day and Mayor Todd is still less than helpful and hints that Cassies (white) mother can say why he isnt a racist. Later the brothers go to meet with a friend of Jimmys, claiming to be insurance investigators, and ask about the black truck. One of the workers knows about a truck involved in the death of black men in the 60s, and hints that the townsfolk are bigoted. Dean wonders if the truck is some kind of Flying Dutchman-type ghost connected to the Robinsons, and Sam suggests Dean and Cassie resolve their unfinished business. Sam guesses that Cassie dumped Dean after he revealed their secret.

That night, Dean meets with Cassie and they argue over their old relationship before having sex.

The next morning time Mayor Todd is out in a field checking plans when the black truck pulls up. He runs and it runs him down. Cassie and Dean discuss how she was frightened by his history and shoved him away. Dean starts to make excuses and she asks him to stopbut then theyre interrupted by news of Todds murder. He was killed on the property of the Dorian family, who owned the newspaper and who one member Cyrus disappeared 40 years ago. Todd had the house bulldozed, and the first murder took place the next day.

That night Cassie is at home when the lights flicker and the black truck pulls up outside. She closes the shutters but the truck keeps lunging at the house. She calls Dean and they show up after the truck leaves. Dean believes whoever is driving the truck wants them scared, and they confront Mrs. Robinson. She confirms her husband Martin knew who the truck belonged to Cyrus Dorian. She mentions he died and Dean catches the slip. She dated Cyrus and was seeing Martin secretly because of their interracial relationship. She broke up with Cyrus and he found out, going insane with rage. Then the murders started and she and Martin prepared to get married, and someone set their church on fire, killing the childrens choir. Later Cyrus caught Martin and beat him on their wedding night. But Martin got loose and beat Cyrus to death. Martin and his two friends disposed of Cyrus and his truck and kept the secret, and now all three are dead. She reveals that Todd was a deputy back then and figured out what they were up to, but covered for them.

That night Sam and Dean are outside the Robinson home and figure Cyrus lay in the swamp until Todds renovation plan awoke him, and they must dredge the swamp for the body. They pull up the truck and yank out the corpse, then prepare to torch it. Everything goes smoothly but then the black truck appears across the field their plan has failed.

Dean figures the burning didnt destroy Cyrus spirit bound within the truck, so Dean drives off to lure the truck away and tells Sam to figure out a way to burn the original truck. A chase ensues while Sam figures out something and calls Cassie. Dean is barely ahead of the black truck and Sam calls him to coordinate his location. He gives Dean directions to go to a very specific spot on a particular road, then stop. Dean brakes precisely and turns the car as the truck stops for a few seconds, then ramps up. The truck heads right for himand shatters apart only a few feet away. Dean is at the church that Cyrus burned down Sam figured if the ghost crossed hallowed ground it would be destroyed.

Later Cassie and Dean make their farewells, and while Cassie isnt sure theyll meet again Dean is confident theyll be together. Back on the road, Sam questions if Dean has ever considered giving it up and Dean just smiles."

By the time the police arrive, however, the body is missing.

Two months later Sam and Dean, who are engaged in a prank war, decide to investigate and track down Craig Thursten. He relates the legend, told to him by his cousin Dana, of Mordechai Murdoch. Murdoch was a farmer who lived in the house during the 1930s and who killed his daughters, hanging them in the cellar.

Sam and Dean visit the house, which has symbols from many different origins freshly painted on the walls and floor. While searching the house, the boys run into Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spengler, paranormal investigators who run a website called Hell Hound's Lair. Sam and Dean do some more research, but can't find any evidence to support the legend of Mordechai Murdoch. They are preparing to leave when they hear that the previous night a girl did die in the house - hung from the rafters.

Returning to the house they again run into Ed and Harry -- and the spirit of Mordechai who chases them from the house and is not slowed by a blast of rock-salt. Back at their motel, the boys try and work out what is happening. Mordechai's spirit appeared to have slit wrists, which was previously not part of his legend. The story on the Hell Hound's Lair website has also changed.

Dean recognizes one of the symbols painted in the house, and he and Sam return to visit Craig. The symbol is from a Blue Oyster Cult album cover, and Craig works in a record shop. Craig admits that he and his cousin painted the symbols and spread the rumor about Mordechai as a prank. Sam postulates that Mordechai is a tulpa - the manifestation of a thought. One of the symbols painted in the house is a Tibetan spirit sigil, which assists in concentrating mental energy. Sam thinks that as people view the website, they are willing into reality what they read there. In order to ""kill off"" Mordechai, the boys tell Ed and Harry that they have found out that being shot with iron rounds will kill him. They wait for the boys to post it on their website and for enough people to view it that it becomes real.

Sam and Dean return to the house to finish off Mordechai, but Ed and Harry are there and tell them the server crashed, so the new legend will not manifest. As Mordechai attacks them, Dean sets the house on fire, figuring that without that part of the legend Mordechai won't exist. Sam and Dean bid farewell to Ed and Harry, Sam with a prank call from a Hollywood producer and Dean with a fish in the back of their car. The boys call a halt to their own prank war - for now."

Little Bethany aka Monkeypuss [Chandra Berg] is saying her prayers while her father stands in the doorway. Monkeypuss jumps into bed and asks Dad if Mom is coming home tonight. Dad says no; Mom is going to stay at the hospital with her older sister, who has recently taken ill. After the light is turned out and Monkeypuss tries to fall asleep, she notices the shadows of tree branches outside her window. The branches turn into long bony fingers, and the fingers start to open the window. Soon the fingers are touching the covers on Monkeypuss's bed. Monkeypuss looks up into the eyes of an ugly old witch who starts sucking the lifeforce from Monkeypuss's mouth. Monkeypuss screams.

Dean and Sam have arrived in Fitchburg, although they have no idea why Dad has ordered them there. The only thing unusual is that they see no children playing, even though it's after 4 PM and school is out. Dean sits on a bench next to the one mother who is watching her little girl play on the jungle gym in the park. He comments about the quietness, and the mother tells him how worried everyone is about the sickness that has put six children in the hospital. Thinking this might be the situation earmarked by Dad, the brothers don suits and false IDs and pass themselves off as doctors from the CDC in order to pay a visit to the pediatric ward. While making their way to the ward, Dean notices an old woman sitting in her room. There's an inverted cross on her wall, which immediately raises Dean's suspicions. In the pediatric ward, they are introduced to Dr Hydecker [Adrian Hough], who explains how he originally diagnosed bacterial pneumonia, but the children are unresponsive to antibiotics and their immune systems seem to be wearing out. The spread of the disease is also unusual in that it works its way through a family, but only among the children. Because all six children are unconscious, Dean and Sam ask to interview the parents of the most recent admission. Monkeypuss's father blames the pneumonia on an open window in Bethany's bedroom.

Betting that Mr Monkeypuss will be at the hospital for a while, the boys decide to snoop around the Monkeypuss house. They let themselves in with their lockpicking tools and make their way to Bethany's bedroom. Using their homemade supernatural entity detectors, they find nothing until Sam notices a bony handprint on the outside of Bethany's window. Dean recognizes the handprint immediately. Some 15 years ago, when they were staying in a motel in Fort Douglas, Wisconsin, Dean saw a handprint just like that one after Sam was attacked when Dean was supposed to be babysitting him but was playing videogames instead. Dean has felt guilty about it ever since.

It's a shtriga, Dean explains to Sam, who has no memory of the attack. Since Dean remembers little about the shtriga, other than it's a kind of witch, Sam looks it up on the Internet and learns that a shtriga is a type of witch from Albanian folklore, although legends about them date back to ancient Rome. The website he reads says that they feed on ""spiritus vitae,"" Latin for ""breath of life"" aka life-force or essence. Shtrigas can feed off anyone, he reads, but they prefer children, and they are invulnerable to ""all weapons devised by God and man."" Not true, Dean interrupts. She's vulnerable only when she's feeding; she can be killed by blasting her with consecrated iron rounds. Sam continues to read that shtrigas can take on a human disguise, usually the form of a feeble old woman. Dean suddenly remembers the old woman with the inverted cross. Checking the addresses of the afflicted children, he notices that they fall in a circle around the hospital. It's late in the evening, but they decide to pay a visit to the old lady's room. She is asleep in her chair but wakes up when the boys enter her room. They make up a story about being maintenance, and she lights into them about fixing the inverted cross on her wall. Nope, she's not the shtriga, they conclude.

Figuring they're going to be in town for a while, the boys get a room at the Court Motel, where Dean meets a precocius young boy named Michael [Colby Paul], his younger brother Asher, and their Mom Joanna. Dean and Michael form a bond when Dean sees himself (the older brother responsible for the younger brother) in the relationship between Michael and Asher. When Dean finds out the next morning that Asher was just taken to the hospital with pneumonia, he again sees himself as Michael blames himself for not seeing that his little brother's window was latched. While Dean drives Joanna to the hospital, Sam heads over to the library to see what he can find on microfiche. He traces the sickness back to Fort Douglas at about the same time the Winchesters were staying there. Before that, the same thing occurred in Ogdenville. Before that, it happened in North Haverbrook, and before that in Brockway, all spaced at 15-20 year intervals. The earliest episode goes back to 1893 in Black River Falls, and Sam is surprised to see a photo taken during the Black River Falls epidemic that shows Dr Hydecker as one of the attending physicians.

Later, back in their motel room, Dean and Sam come up with a plan. Knowing that the shtriga works through families, it's likely that Michael is going to be the next victim. Since the shtriga is only vulnerable when feeding, Michael is going to have to be bait. Dean tries to explain the situation to Michael, but he refuses--until he admits that he saw the shtriga attack Asher, although he thought he was having a nightmare. Finally, Michael agrees to help because he'll do anything to save his little brother. That night, while Joanna is still at the hospital with Asher, Dean and Sam rig up a videocam focused on Michael's bed. They will watch from the next room and be able to destroy the shtriga before it harms Michael.

It's 3 AM. Michael is still awake; Sam and Dean are vigilant. Suddenly, they notice a long, bony hand outside Michael's window. The window opens, the shtriga enters, and the Winchester boys cock their guns. The shtriga bends over Michael and opens its mouth to suck. Dean and Sam burst into the room. As soon as Michael has rolled off and under the bed, they open fire on the shtriga. The shtriga falls to the floor, but the moment Dean and Sam lower their guns, it tosses Dean across the room and goes for Sam. Just as Sam's spiritus vitae begins to pour from his mouth in the shtriga's, Dean blasts a hole through the shtriga's forehead, followed by three more for good measure. The shtriga vaporizes, leaving behind only its raggy cloak.

Epilogue: The next morning, Dean and Sam are packing the Impala, preparing to leave, when Joanna returns from the hospital with good news. Asher has recovered, as have all the other children. Dr Travis has taken over the ward because Dr Hydecker didn't show up today. Joanna takes a happy Michael to the hospital to visit his little brother, while Dean and Sam bemoan Michael's loss of innocence. [Synopsis by bj_kuehl]."

They visit the Telesca home, but there are no signs of any supernatural activity. All the furnishings have been taken to an auction house, so they decide to check it out in case a spirit has attached itself to an object. They turn up at the auction house, where the owner Daniel Blake tries to get them to leave. They speak to his daughter, Sarah Blake, who also works at the auction house and who confirms that the Telesca estate is being auctioned. Before she can tell them any more, her father asks the boys to leave. Dean thinks Sarah showed some interest in Sam, and suggests he take her on date in order to get more information. Over dinner, Sarah reveals she hasn't been on a date since her mother died unexpectedly a year ago.

Sarah gets Sam copies of the provenances of the items in the Telesca estate. Dean finds that a portrait of Isaiah Merchant's family painted in 1910 was also owned by the other families that had been killed. After dark, Sam and Dean return to the auction house and burn the painting. The next day, Dean pretends that he has dropped his wallet at the auction house, purely so Sam can see Sarah again. When they get there they are shocked to find the painting is still there and unharmed.

At the local library, they find out that Isaiah Merchant was accused of killing his wife, two sons, and adopted daughter. Back at the motel Sam notices that in a picture of the painting in an old book, Isaiah is staring straight ahead, and in the painting now, he is looking down to the right. Dean also encourages Sam to pursue Sarah, but Sam is reluctant. He calls Sarah to see if they can view the painting again, only to find it has been sold to a friend of Sarah's named Evelyn. The boys rush to the house just as Sarah arrives, but they find Evelyn already dead, her throat slashed.

After alerting the police, Sarah and the boys return to the motel room, where they explain to her that the picture is haunted. Despite being scared, Sarah resolves to help them. Back at Evelyn's house they examine the painting and notice more features in the painting have changed; among other things there is now a mausoleum in the picture with the name Merchant on it. They track down the mausoleum, where all of the family's cremated remains are housed, however Isaiah Merchant is not interred there. Dean finds that Isaiah was buried in a pauper's grave and goes to salt and burn the corpse.

Later, the three of them return to burn the painting as a precaution, but Sam and Sarah get trapped inside Evelyn's house and attacked by the spirit of Melanie Merchant, who had been responsible for the murders all along. Dean returns to the mausoleum and burns an antique doll which bears some of Melanie Merchant's hair. This finally dispels her spirit. Back at the auction house, Sarah orders the painting burned and says farewell to Sam and Dean. As they are about to leave, Sam returns and kisses Sarah goodbye."

When three guys and a woman enter the bar, Elkins immediately gathers up his notes and rushes home. He locks the front door behind him, but it opens anyway and the woman (a vampire named Kate) steps in. Elkins tosses a knife into her chest, but she calmly pulls it out. Elkins tries to barricade himself in another room. As Kate [Anne Openshaw] knocks down the barricade, Elkins takes an antique gun from his safe and loads it. The barricade breaks down and Kate comes in just as two more vampires crash through a window. Kate laughs when she sees the gun. She picks it up as the other vampires feed on Elkins.

Dean and Sam are having a bite to eat in a cafe. While Dean reads the newspaper, Sam is surfing on his laptop, looking for news reports which may indicate supernatural activity. The only thing worthy of mention is a Colorado man who was found mauled in his home. Police can't tell if it was a bear attack or a robbery; could it be a supernatural attack? When Sam mentions the man's name...Daniel Elkins...Dean thinks it sounds familiar and consults his Dad's journal. Sure enough, Daniel Elkins is in there, so the boys head for Colorado. First stop is Elkins' cabin. Other than a mess, they find only two things that might suggest supernatural activity--a ring of salt inside the front door and Elkins' journal. Then Dean notices some scratches carved into the wood floor and makes a rubbing, which reveals the location and combination of a post office box. They immediately drive to the post office, find the box, and open it. Inside is a letter addressed to ""J.W."". Could J.W. be their father, John Winchester? They return to their car and ponder over whether or not to open the letter.

Suddenly, there is a knock on the car window. It's their father! He read the news about Elkins' death and came right away. Elkins was a vampire hunter as well as John's good friend, although they haven't seen each other in years. John opens the letter and begins to read aloud. ""If you're reading this, I'm already dead..."" He stops reading to ask his sons whether they noticed an antique Colt revolver when they searched Elkins' cabin. Dean remembers seeing the case, but it was empty. John explains that Elkins was killed by vampires and that they must get back the gun. It's not an ordinary gun, he explains. It was made by Samuel Colt in 1835 for a vampire hunter, and legend says that the gun can kill anything. John thinks it may be the means by which to destroy the demon who killed his wife.

Meanwhile, the vampires are also hunting. One of them has laid himself across the road. When a young couple almost hits him with their car, they stop to help. When John hears a call over his police radio of a 911 call reporting a body in the road but no one there by the time the police arrived, he immediately recognizes it as the work of vampires. John and sons follow the call to the accident site where John finds a vampire tooth, confirming his suspicion. It looks like the vampires are heading west, so the Winchesters follow, hoping to find the nest. The vampires are holed up in what looks like an old barn. They have tied up the couple and are taunting them while they wait for their lead vampire Luther to return. Luther and Kate are mates and, when he returns, she presents him with the antique Colt revolver. Luther recognizes it.

The next morning, the Winchesters have located the nest. Armed with machetes, they quietly enter. The vampires are there, sleeping in hammocks. While John searches for the gun, Sam tries to release the girl who made the 911 call (the vampires have already killed her boyfriend), but she was fed Kate's blood during the night and is now united with the vampires. She screams, which wakes up the vampires, and the Winchesters have to run for their lives, leaving the gun behind. Plan 2 calls for Dean to break into a funeral home and obtain some blood from a dead man's body. Later that night, they set up a ruse. Dean fakes car trouble on the road near the vampires' nest. When vampires Kate and Hank stop to offer help, John and Sam shoot them with darts that have been dipped in the dead man's blood, which acts like poison on the vampires, causing a type of ""blood sickness."" Kate passes out, and John beheads Hank. When Luther learns that the Winchesters have taken Kate, he goes hunting for them.

While John (with a weakened Kate in his truck) cruises along the highway waiting for Luther to catch up with him, Dean and Sam invade the nest, behead a few vamps, and release their human captives. Back on the highway, Luther has caught up with John. John offers a trade, Kate for the Colt. Luther agrees and places the gun in the road. When John, still holding a knife to Kate's neck, bends down to pick up the gun, the vampires attack him. Just as it looks like John is a goner, Sam and Dean step out of the bushes and fire dead man's blood-tipped darts at the vampires. Dean picks up a machete and turns to Luther, but Luther grabs Sam and threatens to break his neck unless Dean drops the machete.

""Why can't you people leave us alone?"" Luther scowls. ""We have just as much right to live as you do.""

""I don't think so,"" says John, as he fires a bullet from the Colt revolver that goes right through Luther's forehead, destroying Luther right in front of Kate's eyes. Kate escapes.

Epilogue: Back in their motel room, the Winchesters discuss the fact that Dean and Sam saved John's life, showing that they are stronger together than apart. The three of them decide to hunt together from now on. [Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Meg follows him, kicking in the barred doors. He asks, ""What do you want?"" and she demands the location of John Winchester, who he refuses to betray. She slits his throat.

Back in Manning, Colorado, John is sharing his research of the last 20 years with Sam and Dean. He explains the trail he has followed and the telltale signs. Sam's guilt at being the cause of the deaths of both Mary and Jess turns into anger and pain. But neither John nor Dean allow him to wallow. John sees the signs starting again in Salvation, Iowa, and is intent on saving another family from the pain and loss suffered by the Winchesters.

On the road, John receives the news that Pastor Jim Murphy, the priest from the opening, has been murdered, probably by demons. John feels the pressure to hurry, to find the next family on the demon's list. In despair, John mourns his friend and states ""This ends... now... I'm ending it. I don't care what it takes.""

Overcome by the size of their task, they split up to cover more territory and research all infants turning 6 months old in the coming week. As Sam leaves the medical center where he has been reviewing birth records, he has a vision of the demon's next target. Following the signs in his vision, he meets the young mother Monica and her daughter, Rosie. Unable to warn her, he returns to Dean and John. John is angry that the boys hadn't told him before about Sam's visions. Dean points out John's unresponsiveness and angrily states he would have had better luck winning the lottery than reaching his father on the phone. John grudgingly admits that he's right. Interrupting, Sam's phone rings and Meg, who they thought dead, demands to speak with John. She informs him that she murdered Jim Murphy and is now with another friend, Caleb. She wants the Colt.

In desperation, John plays dumb and Meg promptly kills Caleb. She says she will keep killing all his friends until he hands over the Colt. Capitulating, John agrees to meet her in Lincoln at midnight for the trade. The boys protest handing the gun over, but John has a plan: they will use a substitute gun since Meg doesn't know what the real one looks like. In an emotional revelation, he admits again that he needs this job to finally be over. When Dean returns with the fake Colt, he pleads with John to not throw his life away, as he's no good to them dead. John tells them to do the same. He hands over the real Colt and the task of killing the demon to the boys, charging them with finishing the job he started.

John arrives in Lincoln to meet Meg. He cases the territory for escape routes and traps and finds a reservoir to bless. While the boys stand watch over Monica and her family, John confronts Meg. She is joined by a demon named Tom. John hands the gun to Meg and she in turn hands it off to Tom, asking if he thinks it's the real thing. Without warning, he shoots Meg. She's pissed but she doesn't die. In shock and anger, Meg rounds on John now that it is obvious the gun isn't the real Colt. He runs and deters them by releasing a valve, spraying them with the Holy Water he prepared earlier. Outside the building, John finds his truck's tires have been slashed. Running, he finds himself trapped in a dead end.

Meanwhile, seeing the house lights flicker and hearing static on the car radio, the boys recognize the signs that the demon is coming and they break into the house in attempt to save Monica and Rosie. Racing to the nursery, Sam faces the demon over Rosie's crib. He hesitates for a second before firing off a shot, but the demon vanishes too fast. Grabbing Monica as Dean saves Rosie, they run from the burning house. Dean stops Sam from trying to reenter the burning building to reach the demon.

Meg taunts Dean that John is beyond help. Sam responds by saying that they should find the Demon and kill it with the Colt, but Dean counters that they need a plan because John isn't dead.

The boys arrive at the home of another hunter, Bobby Singer, and their shared history is quickly sketched out - Dean seems to know him quite well, and Bobby once ran John off with a shotgun. Sam goes through some of Bobby's books on demon lore, including the Key of Solomon, while Bobby and Dean talk. Suddenly Meg kicks in the door, attacks the boys, and demands the Colt. However, she soon gets caught under a devil's trap that is painted on the ceiling. Sam starts exorcising the demon. Dean interrogates her, demanding she tell them where their father is. Meg says she killed John, and that he died screaming. Sam reluctantly reads the ritual while Dean questions Meg about John; she repeatedly claims that John is dead, and Dean repeatedly refuses to believe it. Eventually, Meg says he is not dead, and tells them about a building in Jefferson City. Bobby explains that Meg is actually a girl possessed by a demon, and that the injuries she previously sustained in Chicago (in 1.16 Shadow) will kill her if the demon leaves her body. Dean insists on exorcising the demon to save the girl, no matter how broken she is. Sam reluctantly reads the ritual. Finally, the demon is banished, and human Meg, dying painfully, thanks them and offers the clue ""sunrise."" The boys leave Bobby to head to Jefferson City.

On their way to rescue John, Sam reiterates the need to kill the Demon while Dean argues the importance of family. Dean says Sam is like John: eager to die if it means killing the Demon. Sam demonproofs the car so they can hide the Colt in it, to make sure the demons don't get it. They arrive at the building where John is being kept (Sunrise Apartments, which they figure out from Meg's clue), form a plan to evacuate it that involves dressing up as firemen, and execute it. They are able to get the firemen outfits by Dean distracting the real firemen when they show up by claiming he wants to go back in the hotel to get his Yorkie, while Sam goes around the back of the firetruck, breaks in, and gets the suits. They get to the room which they figured out has demons inside. They trap the possessed humans guarding John in a closet and surround the door with salt. They find John almost dead in the bedroom. Sam insists on testing John with holy water. John is barely coherent, but he manages to ask about the Colt. Once all three are out of the building, they're set upon by Tom, who beats Sam severely. Dean whips out the concealed Colt (which apparently hadn't been in the truck) and shoots him through the head, saving Sam.

In a secluded cabin, as the boys salt the doors and windows, Dean confesses that he's scared of the lengths he'll go to in order to protect his family. John enters, claiming that Dean should be proud of what he does for the family. Dean grows suspicious of the kind words and points the Colt at John. Sam allies himself with Dean, and John is revealed to be possessed by the Demon as his eyes glow yellow. The Demon injures both boys and mocks Sam's unreliable special powers, and he also mentions that Sam was about to propose to Jessica. Dean draws the Demon's attention away from Sam, and it reveals that the demons in Meg and Tom were his children. The Demon explains that he killed their mom and Jessica because they got in the way of the plans he had for Sam, and kids like Sam. He uses a psychic power to attack Dean, causing him to bleed internally. Dean begs for his life, and John manages to surface long enough for Sam to free himself and grab the Colt. Sam uses the penultimate bullet in the Colt to shoot John in the leg, forcing the Demon to leave John's body. John begs Sam to shoot him, because he believes the demon is still inside him. Dean tells Sam not to. Sam lowers the gun just as the demon escapes John's body.

Sam drives the Impala with John in the passenger seat and Dean, gravely hurt, in the back. John expresses disappointment that Sam didn't shoot and end the family's quest, but Sam says that killing the Demon is not the most important thing. Sam promises to get them to the hospital, but a huge truck slams into the Impala, smashing it and rendering all three Winchesters unconscious. The truck driver has the black eyes of the possessed."

He stares at a statue of a naked woman that is part of the waiting room. The door opens and Dr. Jennifer Melfi calls Tony into her office. Dr. Melfi offers Tony a seat and Tony sits down. The two sit in silence for several moments. Dr. Melfi breaks the silence and informs Tony that his family doctor, Dr. Cusamano, told her that he has collapsed. Dr. Melfi asks if it was a panic attack and asks him if he was unable to breathe. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that the doctors were the one that said it was a panic attack, but he doesn't believe that happened. He informs her that the blood and neurological work came back negative. The doctors then referred him to her office. Dr. Melfi asks why he doesn't think he had a panic attack. Tony doesn't respond to that question. Dr. Melfi asks Tony how he's feeling now. Tony insists he's feeling fine and is back at work now. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what kind of work he is in. Tony informs her that he is a waste management consultant. After a few more moments of silence, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that it is impossible for him to talk to a psychiatrist. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he has any idea as to why he blacked out. Tony says he thinks it might have been stress. Dr. Melfi asks what he could be stressed about. We then flashback to the day Tony had the panic attack. He narrates the events of the day. He says that when he woke up that morning he had been thinking. He thought it was good to be in something from the ground floor, but that lately he's been getting the feeling that he came in at the end. He thinks that he has already left the best years of his life behind and now it's over. Dr. Melfi notes that many Americans feel this way. As Tony walks out to get the morning paper, he notes that he thinks about his father and remembers that he never made it as far as he has. Despite that, Tony thinks that his father had a better life. He remembers that his father had his friends, a list of standards, and pride. Tony doesn't think that they have any of that today. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he had any of those feelings of loss before he collapsed. Tony admits he doesn't know. When Tony walks back up to the house, he looks at his pool and at the trees surrounding the pool. He then sees a flock of ducks come out of the trees and come into the pool. Tony notes that a few months ago two ducks had landed in his pool. Tony thinks that the ducks were from Canada and they were in mating season. They had ducklings while they were at his home and Tony would go out every day to feed the ducks some bread. Tony steps into the pool to give them some of the bread. Tony's daughter, Meadow, has a friend named Hunter Scangarelo pick her up for school. Hunter sees Tony in the pool and tells Meadow what Tony is doing. Meadow doesn't like the ducks and says that the yard smells like duck feces. Tony's wife, Carmela, tells the girls that they need to have more than orange juice for breakfast. She tells them that they need brain food for school. Tony and Carmela's son, Anthony Soprano, Jr. aka AJ, comes downstairs. Carmela wishes AJ a happy thirteenth birthday. Meadow snipes that AJ doesn't act thirteen. Hunter notes that the ducks probably made love in the pool. Meadow doesn't like to think about that and is even more disgusted when AJ puts his cookie in the jug of milk. Carmela offers the girls last night's dessert, but Meadow tells Carmela that she doesn't want any fattening food. Hunter asks Carmela how she is able to stay so skinny. Carmela looks outside at Tony playing with the ducks in the pool. She is not happy about the ducks either. Outside, Tony starts talking to the ducks and tells them that if they don't like the ramp he built them then he'll build another one with better wood. The ducks start to flap around and Tony calls for his family to come outside to watch the baby ducks fly. Everyone comes outside to see the ducks flapping around, but they really aren't as excited about the ducks as Tony is. Meadow notes that they could see the same thing on National Geographic and AJ remembers that they watched this yesterday morning. Back inside, Hunter is glad to hear that Meadow is coming with her and her family to Aspen during the Christmas break. Hunter says that last year, Skeet Ulrich was in Aspen and she met him. Carmela reminds Meadow that the deal was for her to keep her grades up and keep curfew until Christmas and then she is allowed to go. Meadow insists she knows that. Tony comes back inside and wishes everyone a good morning. He tells AJ happy birthday. Carmela asks Tony if he's going to be home in time for AJ's birthday party. Tony is reading a book on birds and isn't paying attention. Carmela asks him again and Tony tells her he's coming home early. Carmela notes that she isn't talking about that job. Back in the office, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that this isn't going to work. He really doesn't like to talk about his personal life. Dr. Melfi insists that he finish telling her about the day he collapsed. Tony recounts that he drove to work with his nephew, Christopher Moltisanti. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Christopher is still learning the business he's in. Tony says that Christopher is an example of what he was talking about before. Tony asks Christopher if he called Triborough Towers about the hauling contact. Christopher admits that he arrived home late last night and didn't want to wake the man up. Tony asks if he got up early to call, noting that he's in his office by 6:00 a.m. every morning. Christopher says he was nauseous last night and notes his mother told him not to come to work today. Tony notes that this is coming from a man that just bought a $60,000 Lexus. As they drive, Christopher spots an associate named Alexander Mahaffey standing with a woman. Tony tells Christopher to back up so they can talk to him. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Mahaffey had an outstanding loan that he owed him. Dr. Melfi asks Tony to stop for a minute and notes that she has no idea where the story is going. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that there are some ethical ground rules that they need to discuss. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that they do have doctor/patient confidentiality. She says that this can be revoked if she heard about a crime that took place. If that would come to her attention, she has to go to the authorities. Dr. Melfi remembers that Tony told her he was in waste management. Dr. Melfi also adds that Dr. Cusamano is also Tony's next door neighbor. She admits she doesn't know what happened with Mahaffey, but she's just telling him the rules. Tony tells her that they only had coffee. Of course, Tony is exaggerating about the coffee. Mahaffey was carrying coffee, but drops it at the sight of Tony and Christopher's car. Christopher gets out and grabs at Mahaffey. Mahaffey screams for help. Christopher and Mahaffey wrestle, and Mahaffey is able to get away. Tony backs up the car and starts to chase after Mahaffey. After a brief chase, Tony runs the car right into Mahaffey. Mahaffey's leg is clearly broken with a piece of his bone protruding from his left leg. Mahaffey shrieks in pain and can't believe Tony just ran him over. Tony looks at Mahaffey's leg and punches the bone that is broken. Mahaffey screams in pain and Tony asks Mahaffey where his money is. Tony starts to punch Mahaffey repeatedly in the face. Tony sees that many people are watching him beat up Mahaffey while Christopher is more concerned about the Lexus that Tony just dented. Christopher yells that it will take $3,000 to repair the Lexus. Christopher starts to kick Mahaffey and Tony asks Mahaffey where his money is. Mahaffey begs them to stop and promises that he'll get the money. Tony suggests that Mahaffey stop talking to people because he knows that Mahaffey has been telling other people that he is nothing compared to the previous generation of leaders. Tony and Christopher head back to the car. Before he gets in, Tony tells Mahaffey that he should be appreciative because he's right in front of the HMO which means he's covered. Tony and Christopher later arrive at Centanni's Meat Market where he has meetings with his own crew of the Mafia. Tony narrates to Dr. Melfi that the meeting was about a garbage-hauling company that he represents. However, we know that Tony is talking about different business. Tony asks crew member Salvatore ""Big Pussy"" Bonpensiero how Triborough Towers is coming along. Pussy tells Tony that the manager wants to make a contract with their associate, Dick Barone, but another company, the Kolar Sanitation is interfering. Barone notes that Kolar is a nationwide company. Pussy notes that the Kolar brothers are Czechoslovakian immigrants that are hauling paper, plastic, and aluminum for $7,000 less than what Barone is offering. Tony notes that Triborough pays them forty times more than that to steal a shop. Pussy says that Triborough Towers figures that if they can tell the Czechoslovakians no then he can tell them no at the price they are asking for. Pussy notes that the business is really changing. Christopher asks if there's something he can do about it. Tony asks Christopher if he's over his stomachache. Christopher says he's fine. Crew member Silvio Dante arrives and Tony asks him what he's doing here. Silvio says that his wife sent him down to pick up some meat for supper. Silvio asks Tony if he ever went to school with a man named Artie Bucco. Tony informs Dr. Melfi that he had a situation come up with his uncle later that day as well, but he can't go into too much detail with that. Dr. Melfi understands. Tony does admit that his uncle adds to his general stress level. Silvio meets with Tony later and tells him that his uncle, Corrado ""Junior"" Soprano, is going to kill Little Pussy Malanga. Tony asks why that matters. Silvio informs him that Junior wants to kill him in at Artie Bucco's restaurant. Tony isn't too thrilled about that. Tony and Christopher arrive at Artie's restaurant to find Junior enjoying a meal. Junior notes he was just talking about Tony and asks if AJ's birthday is tonight. Tony replies that it is. Tony warns Junior not to buy a big gift because they spoil AJ as much as it is. Tony sees Artie and greets him. Artie's wife, Charmaine, notices Tony and heads into the back. Artie tells Tony and Christopher to have a seat and he'll be with them in a minute. When they sit down, Christopher asks Tony if he knows what will happen if Malanga is killed in the restaurant. Tony knows it will ruin Artie's business. Christopher tells Tony that he needs to sit down and talk with Junior. Tony tells Dr. Melfi in the present that Junior is his father's brother. He notes Junior is a good guy, but is getting old and cranky. Tony remembers that Junior took him to Yankee games when he was little. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he loves Junior. Tony recounts that when he was young he remembers Junior telling his female cousins that he would never be a varsity athlete. Tony admits that was a huge hit to his self-esteem. Tony arrives at the house of his mother, Livia Soprano. Tony has to knock several times before Livia finally comes to the door. Tony kisses Livia and asks how she is. Livia doesn't respond, but Tony notes that Livia should get fresh air into the house. Livia asks Tony if he locked the door. Tony says he did, but really didn't and goes back to do that. Livia tell Tony that someone called the house after dark. Tony asks who did that. Livia says she never answered the phone because it was dark outside. Tony notes that he'll never understand why she won't answer the phone after it's dark. Tony notes that the phone is auditory while darkness is associated with the eyes. They don't go together. He understands why she wouldn't go outside after dark, but doesn't understand why she won't answer the phone. Livia mutters to herself that Tony knows everything. She offers him some eggplant for lunch. Tony tells her that he ate and mentions that he just saw Junior. Livia complains that Junior never comes to visit her despite being his sister-in-law. Tony asks if she remembers Artie. Livia remembers Artie and notes she talks to his mother. Livia notes that Artie's mother told her that Artie calls every day. Tony informs Livia that Junior is going to cause Artie a lot of problems. Livia notices that Tony has brought her a gift and asks what it is. Tony says it's a CD Player for her. Livia says she doesn't want it. Tony knows that she loves music and all of her favorites are on CDS. Tony turns on Pajama Game by Connie Francis, which Livia really likes. Tony tries to keep Livia happy and dances with her quickly. Livia isn't as enthusiastic and tells him to stop. Tony tells Livia that she needs to stay occupied. He remembers that when John died, Livia had said she would do things. Livia starts to sob and remembers that John was a saint. Tony remembers that he was, but reminds Livia that John is dead. Tony remembers that Livia was going to travel and volunteer for charities, but she's done nothing. Livia tells Tony to stop telling her how to live her life. Tony tells Livia that he is worried about her. Livia warns him not to start talking about the nursing home again. Tony yells that he talked about a retirement community, not a nursing home. He says that she would be able to interact with people her own age, travel, and participate in activities. Livia insists that she's seen the women in the nursing homes and all they do is babble like idiots. Livia tells Tony to eat his eggplant. Tony insists that he already ate lunch. Tony asks Livia to speak to Junior about not killing Malanga in Artie's restaurant. He knows that Junior respects her and will listen to her. Livia insists that if Junior has business with Artie, then Junior knows what he's doing. Tony asks Livia if she thinks he doesn't. Livia says that all she knows is that daughters take care of their mothers better than sons do. Tony retorts that he bought CDs for a broken record. Tony heads for the door and tells Livia that he expects to see her tonight at AJ's birthday with some of her baked ziti. Livia says she's only coming if she's picked up and brought home after the party. Livia says that she doesn't drive when the weather predicts rain. Tony tells her that she's healthy and it's good for her to drive. Tony tells her he has to go back to work. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that that night was AJ's birthday party. Tony notes that Carmela always invites their priest, Father Phil Intintola, to the house. AJ comes outside and tells Tony and Carmela that Livia just called and isn't coming to the party. He notes that Livia started to cry and then hung up the phone. Tony notes that Livia needs a purpose in life. Carmela states that Livia is stronger than Tony thinks she is. AJ asks if there's going to be no ziti and curses when there won't be any. Everyone tells him to watch his mouth. Tony lights up the grill and starts to cook some burgers. He lights up a cigar and watches the ducks fly around in the pool. This time, the ducks are able to fly into the air. They all fly off into the day. Tony is deeply saddened by the ducks leaving. Tony says he then felt like something went straight to his skull. Tony starts to breathe heavily and his cigar drops from his mouth. He drops the can of lighter fluid on the grill, clutches his chest, and falls to the ground. Meadow sees that Tony fainted and the family runs to him. The lighter fluid on the grill explodes and everyone takes cover. Carmela tells the children to call 911 while Silvio puts out the fire. Tony then appears in the hospital where he is getting a MRI. Tony recounts that Dr. Cusamano sent him to the hospital and they ran a lot of tests on him. Before he is sent into the MRI, Carmela comes into the room. Carmela came to give Tony some company. Tony notes it's 6:30 a.m. Tony asks about the children. Carmela tells him that they are worried about him. Carmela tells Tony that they will have AJ's birthday in a few weeks. Tony asks Carmela if the doctors think he has a brain tumor. Carmela states that they are about to find out. Tony remarks that Carmela's bedside manner isn't the best. Carmela notes he doesn't want to go through life without knowing. Tony notes that they had some good times and good years in their marriage. Carmela doesn't really care and notes that Tony is already starting with the nostalgia. Tony notes that no marriage is perfect. Carmela adds that when Tony has a woman on the side that really didn't help the situation. Tony insists that he isn't seeing the girl anymore. Tony asks Carmela about Father Intintola. Carmela tells him not to try that and insists that Father Intintola is only making her a better Christian. Tony notes that they all have different needs. Carmela retorts that the difference between her and him is that Tony is going to Hell when he dies. Before another word, Tony is put into the MRI. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that while he was getting tests done, Christopher was handling the garbage contract. Tony adds that he can't go into further detail on this either. Christopher waits in Centanni's Meat Market for the meeting. He practices some karate moves while he waits. A car pulls up to the market. Christopher lets the man in and the man introduces himself as Emil Kolar. Kolar tells Christopher that in the Czech Republic, they love pork as well, noting that they are meeting in a meat market. Kolar asks Christopher if he's ever had Czech sausage. Christopher jokes that he only thought Italian and Jimmy Dean's made sausages. Christopher notes that they learn a lot when they cross cultures. He gets out two beers for them to drink. Kolar tells Christopher that his Uncle Evzen doesn't know that he came to them about the deal. Kolar states that if they make progress tonight then he will tell him. Christopher says that they have to make some progress because this is the only way to stop the madness. Christopher states that business is changing and they are the younger generation full of change. Christopher asks Kolar if he went to high school in Poland. Kolar reminds Christopher that he isn't Polish. Christopher thought that Czechoslovakian is a type of Polack. Kolar insists that he came to the United States at age 9 and went to West Essex. Christopher starts to tell Kolar that his cousin played football against West Essex, but Kolar wants to get down to business and asks for the stuff. Christopher gets out the cocaine that Kolar wanted. Christopher gives Kolar a straw and tells him to sample the product. Kolar starts to snort the cocaine. When he does, Christopher walks over and picks up a pistol. While Kolar is bent over, Christopher shoots Kolar in the head. Kolar falls dead to the floor. Christopher fires three more shots into Kolar, and as he does, the shot shifts to pictures of Humphrey Bogart, Dean Martin, and Al Capone on the wall. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that the doctors continued to run test after test on him. Afterwards, Tony says he and Junior went to play a round of golf and have some lunch. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony has mentioned Junior quite a bit and asks him what the problem with him is. We go to Junior leaving Artie's restaurant, asking Tony who he thinks he is. Tony says that he is the person that says how things go. Tony insists that Artie's business is nice and is more proper than the suburbs. Tony asks Junior not to ruin Artie's life. Junior insists that Artie's restaurant, Vesuvio, is the only place where Malanga feels he is safe and has been eating there his entire life. Tony orders Junior to do the hit somewhere else. Junior retorts that Tony may run North Jersey, but he doesn't run him. Junior reminds Tony of the countless hours they played catch together when he was younger. Without another word, Junior and his crew leave Tony. Back at the doctor's office, Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she wants to focus more on his immediate family. Tony notes that Carmela and Meadow haven't been getting along lately. At the house, Father Intintola is watching a movie at the Soprano residence. Father Intintola is amazed at the laser discs and the DVD player. Carmela tells him that Tony watches The Godfather Part II and says it looks just like a movie theater. Carmela says that Tony prefers Part II over Part I because of the part when Vito returned to Sicily. Tony was very disappointed in Part III. Father Intintola asks Carmela where Tony ranks Goodfellas. Before she can answer, Carmela hears a pounding noise. Father Intintola asks if she has raccoons. Carmela says it sounds like someone is trying to break open the window. Father Intintola notes that she has security lights and wonders who is trying to break in. Carmela gets a machine gun out of the cabinet and runs outside. It turns out to be Meadow trying to climb back into the upstairs window. Meadow tells Carmela that she noticed the glass rattled every time she went into the laundry room. Meadow asks if they have window putty. Carmela isn't stupid and knows that Meadow snuck out. AJ comes outside and asks what's going on. Meadow knows that AJ locked her bedroom window and thinks it was only so she would get caught. Carmela remarks that normal people thought she was upstairs doing her homework. Carmela thinks that Meadow has become a master of lying and conniving. Meadow knows that she's grounded and yells that Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow and he needs her. Carmela tells her that she isn't grounded for sneaking out. She tells her that she isn't going to Aspen with Hunter. Tony insists that the issue will blow over eventually and the two will learn to get along again. Dr. Melfi asks if Tony admitted he was depressed to Dr. Cusamano. Tony hesitates and starts to look around. He notes that Dr. Melfi's last name is Italian and asks her where she's from. Dr. Melfi tells her that her father's ancestors are from Caserta. Tony notes his ancestors are from Avellino. Tony admits that Livia would have loved it if he and Dr. Melfi would have been married. Dr. Melfi changes the subject and tells him that anxiety attacks are legitimate psychiatric emergencies. She notes it would be dangerous if he was driving and passed out. Tony starts to get really frustrated. He tells Dr. Melfi that in today's world everyone has to go see shrinks and counselors and talk about their problems. Tony wonders what happened to Gary Cooper. He notes that Gary Cooper was a tough, silent American and that's the way Americans should be. Tony doesn't think Gary Cooper was in touch with his feelings and he did what he had to do to live on. Tony thinks that people didn't realize that once Gary Cooper was in touch with his feelings that they wouldn't be able to shut him up. After that, all the world is about is dysfunction. Dr. Melfi remarks that Tony has soft feelings about this topic. Tony tells her that he had a year and a half at college where he learned about Freud and therapy being a concept. Tony insists that in his world it does not go down. Tony admits he could be happier, but there isn't a person out there who couldn't be. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he feels depressed. Tony stays silent for a few moments, but states that when the ducks left he has felt depressed. Dr. Melfi notes that these were the ducks that preceded him fainting. Dr. Melfi wants to talk about the ducks. Tony has had it and storms outside. At night, Pussy and Christopher hide Kolar's body. Pussy adds that Christopher can't blame Tony for being mad because Christopher shouldn't have killed Kolar yet. Christopher tells Pussy that he won't show initiative ever again. Christopher notes that Tony is running down the business and he killed Kolar to keep one of their stops. Pussy retorts that Tony isn't running the business down and it's New York that's causing the problems. Pussy notes that this is a messed up situation. Pussy knows that the uncle isn't going to cave in and give the business to them if he finds out that Kolar was murdered. Christopher quotes from The Godfather and says that Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes. Pussy corrects Christopher and says the guy's name was Luca Brassi. Christopher doesn't care, but Pussy says that there is a big difference between Luca Brassi being killed and Kolar being killed. Pussy tells Christopher that if the Kolars know that Emil is dead then it hardens their position in the company. On top of that, the cops are going to try and find out who killed him. Christopher asks Pussy what he wants them to do. Pussy suggests that Kolar just disappears and never comes home. Pussy says this way, they know he's dead, but they really don't know for sure. The Kolars will always hope that Emil comes home. Christopher likes the idea and Pussy says they'll cut him up on Staten Island. Christopher asks Pussy what he would do if Tony ended up disabled, indicating him fainting at the birthday party. Pussy doesn't have an answer and scolds Christopher for questioning that. The next day, Tony, Carmela, Livia, Meadow, and AJ visit Green Groves Retirement Home. As they are getting a tour, Carmela notices material by Zora Neale Hurston. She notes that Meadow just read a book by her in school. Meadow is still angry with Carmela and storms away from her. Tony thinks Green Groves is very nice. AJ agrees and tells Livia that she really should think about coming to live here. The tour guide takes the family to the living room which was just renovated last year. Livia sees a set of doors with several doctors and rooms. Livia asks the tour guide what happens behind those doors. The tour guide says that those doors are to the nursing unit. Livia notes that this is a nursing home, not a retirement community. The tour guide insists that this is a retirement community and the nursing unit is just in case of an emergency. Livia isn't buying it and screams that she is not living in a nursing home. Tony tells Livia to listen to what the tour guide is saying. Livia refuses to listen and reminds them about the babbling old ladies. Livia scolds the tour guide and notes that she thinks that the tour guide is high and mighty with her fancy office. Livia screams that people come here to die. Tony once again starts to feel stressed. He grabs onto a table, but it won't hold his weight. He has another panic attack and knocks the table and the vase down with him. Livia yells for someone to get a doctor. Tony is back in Dr. Melfi's office. He holds his face in his hands in embarrassment. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony only came back for help and assures him not to look at it as a defeat. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Livia was one of the children that grew up in the Great Depression, but the Depression to Livia was like a trip to Six Flags. Dr. Melfi notes that depression has popped up in his conversation again. Dr. Melfi tells Tony to stay on track with his mother. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that now that John is dead, he is a saint to Livia. But when John was alive, he was nothing to Livia. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that John was tough and ran his own crew. Tony blames Livia for wearing John down to a little nub. Tony thinks he was a squeaking gerbil when he died. Dr. Melfi notes that Livia is a very formidable maternal presence. Tony admits he also isn't getting any satisfaction from work. Dr. Melfi asks why. Tony says it's because of RICO. Dr. Melfi thinks Rico is Tony's brother, but Tony tells her that he meant the RICO statutes in the newspapers. Tony says that the government is using electronic surveillance and various legal strategies to take down his business. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he has any qualms about how he makes his living. Tony says he does. He says that he has to be the sad clown laughing on the inside, crying on the inside. Tony admits that things are on the downward trend. Tony says that before when someone got caught they would take their prison sentence with pride and everyone upheld the code of silence. He notes that nowadays nobody has time for the penal experience and there are no values. As a result of this, everyone turns into a government witness. Tony admits he feels exhausted talking about this. Dr. Melfi assures Tony that with the pharmacology of today, nobody needs to suffer with feelings of depression and exhaustion. Dr. Melfi writes him a prescription for Prozac. Tony isn't too thrilled. Later, Christopher meets with Hesh Rabkin at the Bada Bing Strip Club. Hesh informs Christopher that Mahaffey doesn't have the money. Christopher doesn't understand how Mahaffey couldn't have the money. Hesh simply says that Mahaffey just doesn't have it. Christopher notes that they ran Mahaffey over with a car. Hesh insists that Mahaffey has no wiggle room and is broke. Tony joins the two. Hesh tells Tony that he heard that Junior wants to whack Pussy. Tony corrects Hesh and says that it's Little Pussy Malanga that Junior wants to kill. Tony insists that Junior would never mess with Big Pussy. Silvio joins the group and asks for some drinks from a waitress. Hesh asks Tony if Junior resents Tony being boss. Hesh notes that Junior has had his eye on the boss position his whole life. Hesh recounts that John and his younger brother were made men even before Junior was. Hesh can understand why Junior doesn't like Tony telling him what to do. Tony tells Hesh that he loves Junior. Hesh notes that Junior is driven by his insecurities. Silvio adds he feels bad about being the messenger and leaves the group. Hesh advises Tony to get Artie out of town so the restaurant closes for a few weeks. This would force Junior to have to do the hit in another location. Tony is impressed with Hesh's thinking and notes that he knew there was a reason John kept him around all this time. Hesh asks about Mahaffey's money. Tony notes that Mahaffey's new business partner is Hesh. Tony notes that HMOs pay millions to doctors and patients. Tony notes that it cost $2,000 for his MRI. Tony says that they give Mahaffey a choice. He says that the company can either start paying phony claims to fake clinics that they will set up or he pays Hesh the $250,000 that he owes him which Mahaffey can't do. Hesh thinks this could be a major step. Tony thinks it's better than garbage. Christopher notes that garbage is their bread and butter. Tony insists that it was their bread and butter. At the Soprano residence, Carmela gets out some money in a can that she's been keeping. She runs upstairs to see Meadow, who is lying down on her bed. Meadow tells Carmela that she isn't going with her downtown. Carmela notes that every year since Meadow was younger on this day they would go get a makeover and have tea under Eloise's portrait in the New York Plaza Hotel. Meadow insists that she has too much homework. Carmela insists that it's their tradition and they always have fun. Meadow tells Carmela that she hasn't had fun doing that since she was eight. She says that she went because Carmela like going. Carmela admits she thought that they wouldn't be like this until long after she was married with daughters of her own. Meadow hopes she doesn't live around this area by then. Carmela tells Meadow that she can't just lie, cheat, and break rules that she doesn't like. Meadow gives Carmela a look. Carmela asks Meadow if she has something she wants to say. Meadow asks Carmela if she knows how much it means to go skiing in Aspen. Meadow notes that won't happen every year like tea and scones at the Plaza Hotel. Carmela tells Meadow she'll see her later. Meadow asks Carmela to close the door on her way out. At Vesuvio, Tony and Christopher visit Artie. Tony asks Artie if he can help him out. Artie asks what he needs. Tony tells Artie about a Caribbean Cruise for three weeks. He tells Artie that he has a pair of tickets, but he can't use them. Tony wants Artie to take them off his hands and go on the cruise with Charmaine. Christopher says they are from Comps. Artie asks what Comps is. Tony says that as a manager for the Kitchen and Restaurant Workers Union, he administered the dental plan. Tony says that some of the dentists got together and awarded him the tickets for all of his hard work. Tony insists he can't take off for these dates. Tony asks Artie when his last vacation was. Artie thanks Tony for the cruise tickets. At the office, Dr. Melfi comes out to the waiting room to bring Tony in for his next appointment. However, she finds that the waiting room is empty. She goes back into her office. Back at the Bucco residence, Charmaine is very angry that Artie accepted the cruise tickets from Tony and says that he can't accept a gift from a man like Tony. Artie says that if he has to work another day without a break he's going to lose his mind. Charmaine tells Artie that this isn't up for discussion. Charmaine tells the children it's time to go home. Artie insists that he and her have to get away for the marriage. Charmaine insists that it's bad enough that the Mafia has to eat at Vesuvio. Artie insists that they aren't connected. Charmaine says that is correct because they are turning down the tickets. Artie insists that the tickets are just Comps and Tony is a labor leader. Charmaine tells Artie to wake up and asks him if it makes any sense that a union of dentists would decide to give out a cruise to a labor union leader. Charmaine insists that someone had to bust a kneecap to get those tickets. Later, Hesh and Pussy meet with Mahaffey. Mahaffey is on crutches due to his broken leg. Mahaffey insists that he can't fraud the HMO company for Tony. Pussy insists that the paperwork will look real. Mahaffey asks how he won't get caught. Hesh tells Mahaffey to stop knocking himself and adds that he's a smart man. Mahaffey states that he is so depressed he can't eat or sleep. Hesh asks if he's on Prozac. Mahaffey states he's on Zoloft, which is similar. He adds Zoloft is supposed to help with the gambling. Pussy doubts that, but Mahaffey says that the medicine of today is supposed to suppress compulsive behaviors. Pussy says it's a shame that a medication comes along after his gambling caused a problem. Mahaffey insists he's not trying to be cynical. Hesh states that his debt and the feelings surrounding it is the source of all of his problems. Mahaffey states that he's sorry he hasn't paid Hesh yet. He adds he never meant to disgrace Tony's name. Hesh knows Mahaffey didn't do it intentionally. Hesh asks if he wants to go walk on the rocks. Mahaffey notes that with his new crutches, he can't. Hesh tells Mahaffey that they'll help him and adds that he goes out to the rocks to think. Pussy throws his ice cream cone over the bridge down to the water and rocks below. Mahaffey gets the message and tells them that he will go along with their plan for setting up MRIs as payment from HMOs. The next day, Tony is playing a round of golf. He takes out his Prozac and takes a pill. He quickly puts it away before another crew member, Paulie Walnuts Gualtieri, tells Tony that Barone is looking for him. Barone arrives with some good news. He tells Tony that Triborough Towers called and that the Kolar brothers withdrew their bid. Tony is glad to hear that. Barone notes that Artie is also here to see him. Barone takes off to continue business. Tony meets with Artie at the garbage dump. Tony asks Artie if everything is alright. Artie pulls out the cruise tickets and gives them back to Tony. Tony notes that they discussed this and Artie has to go on a vacation. Artie apologizes, but says he can't go. Later that night, Dr. Melfi is on a date with a man named Nils. Nils argues with the waiters and notes he made a reservation two weeks ago. The person at the desk apologizes, but states that people aren't leaving and there are five parties ahead of him. Nils gives up and goes back to Dr. Melfi. Dr. Melfi suggests that they find a new restaurant to eat at. Behind them, Tony and a date, Irina Peltsin, arrive at the restaurant. Tony sees Dr. Melfi and greets her. Tony asks Dr. Melfi if she comes here often. Dr. Melfi says she does. Tony play Dr. Melfi off like a decorator and tells her that the decorating tips really worked. Dr. Melfi is glad to hear that. Tony introduces himself to Nils. When Tony leaves, Nils asks Dr. Melfi if she knows who that was. He knows that Tony is a patient of Dr. Melfi's. Dr. Melfi insists that she can't say whether he is or not. Tony calls over Christopher's girlfriend, Adriana La Cerva, and tells her to get a table ready for Nils and Dr. Melfi. Adriana walks over to them and tells them that there is a table ready for them. Nils is amazed. Later that night, Tony takes Irina to his boat, The Stugots. Irina asks Tony who the woman was he saw tonight. Tony insists it was only his decorator. Irina asks if Tony is remodeling the garbage dump. Tony laughs and notes that was a funny joke. Irina puts on the sailor's hat and Tony chases after a naked Irina. He warns her that the hat was worn by JFK and he bought it at an auction. Irina tells Tony that she knows there is something more intimate between him and Dr. Melfi. Tony assures her that they only talk. Tony kisses Irina. The next night, Tony takes Carmela out to dinner. Tony tells Carmela that there are times when life is good. Carmela says that life is often good. She notes that Tony has been in good spirits for the last few days. Tony tells Carmela that he has to confess something to her. Carmela moves her glass and notes that she is readying herself to throw it in Tony's face. Tony notes she's always so dramatic. Carmela tells Tony to confess what he has to tell her. Tony tells her that he's on Prozac. He tells her that he's seeing a therapist. Carmela is actually thrilled to hear that from Tony. She notes that it is a very gutsy move for him and adds that psychology doesn't address the soul. She thinks this is a big start. Tony tells her that she is the only one that knows and she's only getting to know because she's his wife. He adds that she is the only person that he is truly honest with. Carmela doesn't believe that. Tony says that this is serious and notes that if the wrong person finds out it could get him killed. Carmela tells Tony that she never realized how unhappy he was. Tony adds that Livia contributes to his stress. Carmela asks Tony if he told the psychiatrist about his father, noting that she thinks the psychologist is a male. Tony doesn't tell Carmela that Dr. Melfi is a female and tells her that he has talked about John. Tony states that lately he has felt that his life was out of balance. Carmela tells Tony that their existence on the Earth is a puzzle. She notes that Meadow hates her. Tony tells her that this is what mothers and daughters will do, and promises Carmela that Meadow will forgive her. At home, Meadow answers the telephone. Christopher is on the other line and asks Meadow if she has no social life. Meadow tells him off and that's when Tony and Carmela arrive home. Meadow hands the phone to Tony. Carmela brings in some primavera for Meadow to eat. Meadow still ignores her and heads upstairs. Christopher is watching the television and informs Tony that Little Pussy Malanga has returned from Florida. Christopher realizes that the hit is going to happen soon. Tony tells him not to worry about it and says he has a way to prevent the hit from going down at Vesuvio. The next day, Meadow is playing volleyball at the school. Tony and Silvio watch her from the stands. Silvio notes that Tony needs something and asks when he needs it by. Tony tells Silvio that he needs this thing right away. Silvio tells Tony that he can get a party together for him. They notice a bad call on the ball going out of bounds and Tony and Silvio yell at the referee. After the volleyball game, Meadow finds Tony outside. She notes that Carmela didn't come to the game. Tony states that Carmela didn't think that she would want her to watch the game. Tony tells Meadow that she played a good game today. The two say goodbye to Silvio and his daughter, Heather. Tony wonders where Heather learned the spike move from. Meadow breaks the ice and asks Tony if he thinks Carmela is being unreasonable about stopping her trip to Aspen. She thinks it's even worse that Carmela is playing the sad mother trying to make her feel bad. Tony looks up at the church and has his eye on something. He walks inside. Meadow follows him still complaining that Carmela is being unfair. Tony sits down in one of the pews and notes that it's been years since he went into a church. Meadow begs Tony to talk to Carmela about letting her go to Aspen, but Tony isn't listening. Meadow asks why they are sitting here. Tony tells her that Carmela thinks that Meadow has the ability to be the top student in her class. Tony adds that he agrees. Meadow asks if they're really looking for perfection. Tony doesn't answer, and Meadow wants to know what he's looking at. Tony tells Meadow that her great-grandfather and great-uncle built this church. Meadow isn't impressed. Tony continues to tell her that they were stone and marble works that came from Italy and built the church. Meadow doesn't believe that only the two of them made it. Tony adds that they had a group of workers, and despite not designing the church, they still knew how to build it. Tony states that it's practically impossible to find two good plumbers nowadays. Downtown, Silvio walks by Vesuvio. After he crosses the street, a huge explosion occurs and Vesuvio catches on fire. The next day, Tony meets with Dr. Melfi. He informs her that he is feeling good and doesn't know if he needs to come back to visit her again. Dr. Melfi says that it isn't the Prozac that's doing that to him. She states that he said he was thinking clearer and Carmela added that he seemed better overall. Dr. Melfi adds that it takes weeks for Prozac to build effective levels in the blood. Tony asks what is making him better. Dr. Melfi says that it's the talks that make him feel better. She adds that hope comes in many forms. Tony notes he doesn't have a lot of time to devote to therapy. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what he wants to say to her. Tony tells her that he had a dream last night. He says that in the dream his bellybutton was a Phillips head screw and he was unscrewing it in the dream. He says that when the screw came out, his penis fell off. Tony says that he picks it up and tries to find the man that used to work on his car so that he can put it back on. Tony says that when he holds it up a bird swooped down and grabbed it. Dr. Melfi asks what kind of bird it was. Tony says it might have been a seagull. He notes he watched the movie, The Birds, last week and wonders if that planted the idea. Dr. Melfi notes it was a water bird and notes Tony's ducks. Dr. Melfi asks Tony why the ducks meant so much to him. Tony says it was beautiful for the ducks to come into the pool and start a family. Tony admits he was sad to see them go. He starts to sob. Dr. Melfi passes him the tissues. Dr. Melfi notes that when the ducks had babies they became a family. Tony says that it's a link because he is afraid he is going to lose his family like he lost the ducks. Tony admits this is where the root of his problems lies. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what he thinks is going to happen. Tony admits he doesn't know. The next day, Tony, Paulie, Artie, Silvio, Pussy, and Christopher are standing around the grill while Tony cooks some hamburgers, hotdogs, and sausage. Artie is very upset that his restaurant burns down, but doesn't know that Tony had it burned down. He says that it is so tough to see his life's dream go up in flames. Tony notes that he's collecting insurance money from the damages. Paulie adds that it could have been a worse situation. Artie says that it was a faulty stove that caused the fire and that is bad in his eyes. Christopher tells Artie that people could have stopped coming to the restaurant and that would have been worse for him. Tony stares at Christopher for saying that. Christopher is fed up with everything and leaves the group. Tony admits that Christopher did have a point and there's no insurance for losing customers. Artie asks why people would even stop coming to the restaurant. Tony says that lately he's been figuring out that talking about things help. Everyone else agrees with Tony. Tony reiterates Dr. Melfi's words and states that hope comes in many forms. Artie starts to sob over the loss of his restaurant. Tony tells Artie that he will always help him and gives him a hug. Tony tells Artie to cook the burgers for him to feel better. Christopher is sitting on the porch. Tony approaches him and sits down. Tony promises Christopher that one day he will tell Artie the truth about why the restaurant burned down. Christopher doesn't say anything. Tony demands to know what is wrong. Christopher tells Tony that he could have at least thanked him for his hand in the Triborough Towers contract. Tony tells Christopher that he is right. However, he tells Christopher that when he was growing up, John and Livia never supported or complimented him for anything. Christopher tells Tony that he has a friend that knows someone in the movie industry that would give Christopher millions of dollars for his life story. Christopher notes he didn't do that and decided to stick it out with him. Tony grabs Christopher and asks him if he would really sell his story. Tony notes that there are several mobsters that are selling their screenplays and messing things up for all of them. Christopher adds that he might even be able to star as himself in the movie. Tony tells Christopher to forget about the Hollywood screenplays and the rest of those distractions. Tony notes he's even had offers. Tony tells him that they have work to do and everything will be alright from here on out. He takes Christopher back outside and says that they should enjoy their beautiful day. Junior picks up Livia to take her to AJ's birthday party. Livia thanks Junior for picking her up and adds that somebody at least cares about her. Livia thinks that Tony wants to put her in a nursing home so she'll die faster and then he won't have to deal with her anymore. Livia adds that if John were still alive he would show more decency and respect towards her. Junior remembers that John was a man with respect. Livia starts to sob and states that he was a saint. Junior also notes that things are different from John's days and theirs. Livia doesn't understand. Junior tells her that he isn't free to run his business the way he wants. Livia thinks that is hard for him. Junior notes that Tony interfered last week and made it even more difficult. He adds that Tony also doesn't have a lot of respect for New York. Junior states that Tony is part of an entire generation. He continues to berate Tony and Livia asks Junior to stop because he's making her upset. Junior admits he isn't trying to make her upset, but adds he is like this most of the time. Junior also states that this are down all across the board and a lot of his friends are complaining. Junior knows that they used to be recession proof, but that isn't the case anymore. Junior says that his friends are trying to get him to take a larger hand in the Mafia and mentions that something may have to be done about Tony. Junior and Livia arrive at the Soprano residence to see Tony cooking. Tony says hello, but Livia immediately complains, noting that he's using mesquite and it will make the sausage taste weird. Livia says happy birthday to A.J. Tony tells Carmela that Livia is finally here and Carmela tells everyone it's time to eat. The family all heads over to the food table to get some food. The episode ends with a long shot of Tony's pool."

The two sit in silence for several minutes and all the while Tony is checking out Dr. Melfi's body. Tony finally breaks the silence and asks Dr. Melfi if she's going to say anything. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony is the one that is paying the bill. Tony looks out the window and sees Hesh walk right past the office. Tony is startled and tells Dr. Melfi that he just saw his friend walk past the window. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that Hesh has a three o'clock appointment. Tony bursts out of the office and sees AJ standing on the other side of the door. Tony turns away and goes back into the waiting room. When he walks back into the waiting room, he finds Silvio having sex with a woman on one of the waiting chairs and Paulie and Pussy reading newspapers. He then turns back to the office to see that Dr. Melfi is turned around facing away from him. Tony asks Dr. Melfi what is going on. Dr. Melfi replies, in a man's voice, that thunderstorms are coming. Tony turns to see Aprile lying down on his hospital bed smoking a cigarette. He tells Tony that he smells rain coming. Tony asks Dr. Melfi what she is doing to him. When Dr. Melfi turns around, she suddenly has the face of Livia. Tony falls backwards in a panic attack. An alarm is ringing in the background and we can tell that Tony was only dreaming. He is in a motel room with his mistress, Irina. Irina asks Tony if everything is alright. Tony tells Irina to go back to sleep. He puts on his clothes and leaves. At the Soprano residence, AJ is busy playing Mario Kart in the living room. Tony comes in and notes that AJ has school tomorrow. AJ states that he is working on getting the high score. He asks Tony where he's been. Tony lies and tells him that the compactor at Barone Sanitation failed. Tony sits down and decides to play a race with AJ. As they play, Tony asks AJ how things are going for him. AJ isn't paying attention and is too busy focusing on the game. AJ finally tells Tony that he needs to concentrate in order to play and sets up a new game. Tony covers AJ's eyes in a joke and is able to pull ahead in the race. Tony is able to finish ahead of AJ in the game. Tony tells AJ to learn the lesson of focusing through distractions and tells him to be in bed in ten minutes. The next day, Christopher and Adriana leave the hospital. Christopher has a neck brace on his neck and several cuts and bruises from the men last night that acted out a fake hit. Christopher is looking around in fright and asks Adriana where she parked. Adriana assures Christopher that nobody followed her, but Christopher knows that Adriana wouldn't be smart enough to know if someone had or not. Adriana tells Christopher to stop being paranoid and assures him that nobody is here. Christopher isn't calming down and tells Adriana to go get the car. Adriana starts to mock Christopher and starts to point out places where Tony is probably lying in wait. Christopher is angry and pulls Adriana back into the hospital. Christopher notes that anyone could pop out and shoot him at any time and notes that Tony might not be the one after him. Adriana reminds Christopher that he gave speed to Adriana. Christopher doesn't think that Tony found out about that. Adriana can only complain about her wrist. Christopher is angry with her selfishness and notes that he was dragged out to the Meadowlands and was mock executed. Adriana stares at him and Christopher asks what she wants to say. Adriana hesitates, but tells Christopher that the nurse told her that he messed his pants. Christopher tells Adriana to stop messing around and orders her to go get the car so they can go talk to Filone. Christopher and Adriana arrive at Filone's house. They knock on the door, but Filone doesn't answer. Christopher and Adriana let themselves in. Adriana says she needs to use the restroom and heads straight for the bathroom. Adriana walks in and screams at the sight of Filone's dead body in the bathtub. Christopher joins her and sees that Filone was shot right through the eye. Christopher and Adriana hold each other as they grieve. At school, AJ makes a phone call to someone else and tells him to deliver a message to a boy in his school. He looks across the hall to see the boy pick up his phone, realizing that AJ made a prank call. The boy, Jeremy Piocosta, confronts AJ and asks if he thinks he's funny. AJ doesn't understand what Jeremy is talking about. Jeremy tells AJ that if he prank calls him again he is going to be sorry. AJ again denies that he did anything. Jeremy notes that he's heard all of the mother jokes before, and then teases AJ by asking him why he ate all of the donuts his mother sent to them at camp. Jeremy remembers that AJ would cry on his mother's shoulder saying that he was homesick. AJ shoves him and tells him to shut up. Jeremy shoves him back and the boys start to fight. Jeremy is taller than AJ and shoves him into the lockers. The two slug each other and Jeremy rips the collar on AJ's shirt. A teacher comes to the scene and tells the boys to stop fighting. At the doctor's office, Tony is walking down the hall when he spots Silvio in the hallway leaving his dentist's office. Tony quickly ducks into another room to avoid being seen. When Silvio leaves, Tony walks over to the office and notes that Silvio was only seeing the dentist. He arrives at Dr. Melfi's office and goes inside. At their appointment, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is having second thoughts about therapy. Tony explains that it's only about security and notes that he doesn't know how safe it is to tell her things about his life. Dr. Melfi says that she understands his concerns, but notes that they already went over the ground rules that involved confidentiality for anything that wasn't incriminating. Tony tells her that the fact he is in therapy incriminates him. Tony worries that one of his crew will see him here and then they will tell everyone else in the Mafia about it. Dr. Melfi changes the subject and states that she was under the impression that they were working on his narcissism. Tony asks Dr. Melfi who she thinks she is. Dr. Melfi asks Tony why it's important for him to know. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that one of the things Livia taught him was to never answer a question with another question. Dr. Melfi is glad to hear that Livia taught him something. Tony asks Dr. Melfi who she trusts in life and what she talks about. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she's going to take the Fifth Amendment on that question. At school, Meadow and Hunter are standing outside waiting for the bus. Adriana approaches them and informs them that Christopher needs to see them. Meadow wonders what is going on and she thinks it has something to do with Tony. Meadow wonders if the FBI is serving another warrant on their home. Christopher jumps out and yells at Meadow for telling Tony about the speed. Meadow sees Christopher beaten up and asks him what happened. Christopher yells that he and Adriana are probably going to have to move to Florida because of Meadow telling Tony. Hunter is only concerned about Filone getting her love poem. Adriana starts to drive the car and Meadow promises Christopher that she never told Tony about the speed. Christopher tells Meadow this is serious and Meadow tells Christopher to let go of her and to stop yelling. Meadow starts to cry and tells Christopher that Tony has been worried about him and asking everyone where he's been. Christopher apologizes to Meadow for acting this way. Meadow states that she hates her life because she's a Soprano. Christopher warns Meadow to never say that because it's blasphemy. Meadow isn't really concerned about that. Christopher tells Adriana to drive and tells Meadow that they'll buy her a Happy Meal at McDonalds. At the Soprano residence, AJ is trying to kill a fly in his room with a baseball glove. Carmela comes in with the ripped shirt and asks AJ why it was in the trashcan. AJ just plays it off as the shirt going out of style. Carmela isn't buying the excuse for one second and AJ admits to Carmela that he was in a fight. Carmela asks who it was. AJ tells Carmela that it was Jeremy Piocosta, but notes to her that he didn't get any demerits. Carmela is shocked and remembers that he and Jeremy went to camp and she thought they were friends. AJ has nothing to say and Carmela tells AJ that she is going to call Mrs. Piocosta to see what she has to say. AJ doesn't want her to, but Carmela tells AJ that they need to learn the value of a dollar when it comes to the ruined shirt. AJ tells Carmela that he will wash her car to pay for the shirt. Carmela notes that he never puts effort into washing it. AJ promises to do well and he'll get the money for the shirt as long as she doesn't call Jeremy's mother. Carmela tells AJ that the shirt is $40. Tony visits Livia at the retirement home. Tony tells Livia that he brought her some macaroons for her to snack on. Livia isn't thrilled and tells Tony that macaroons are too sweet. Tony thought that they were Livia's favorite. Tony informs Livia that Rosie, the activities director, is organizing a trip to the city. Livia doesn't want to go and tells him that she doesn't like the people here or the city. Tony notes that Livia hasn't gotten to know the people well at all and that's her own fault. Livia complains that in the city, there are mothers throwing their babies out of windows, grown men messing their pants, and thieves. Tony notes that Livia always thinks this way. He notes that he hasn't seen her try to interact with the other people that live in the retirement home. Livia asks why he even cares about that and thinks that Tony's philosophy of her is that if she's out of sight, she's out of mind. Tony says that he doesn't think like that at all. Livia again asks God to take her out of the world. Tony tells Livia that he came to see her to get cheered up and now he thinks that was a mistake. He tells Livia that she can't put all of her problems on him. He notes that he has put her in the most expensive retirement home in New Jersey and Livia could be happy here if she wanted to be. Livia isn't concerned at all. Tony asks Livia if she really wants the macaroons, but Livia tells Tony that she doesn't care. Tony gets up, grabs the macaroons, and leaves. Outside, Tony gets back into his car. He hears an older woman walking with one of the nurses saying that it might rain today. Tony then spots his informer from the police, Vin Makazian, taking a leak in the bushes near the home. Tony picks up a rock and throws it Makazian. Tony asks Makazian what he's doing. Makazian notes that the office is an hour away from here. Tony tells him to get over it and notes that Livia lives here now. Makazian complains that meeting him out at the retirement home wasn't very convenient for him. Tony notes that it's better than him going to the precinct to talk to him. Makazian asks Tony what he has for him. Tony hands Makazian a slip of paper with Dr. Melfi's name on it. Tony tells Makazian that he wants to know Dr. Melfi's background and routine. Makazian wants to know the state of relationship he has with Dr. Melfi, but Tony isn't telling him. Tony asks Makazian if he's bored with his life. Makazian says that lately all he's arrested are prostitutes and drug addicts. He also adds that it's hard for him to pay two alimonies when he only gets $40,000 each year. Tony cuts in and warns Makazian that he is not to touch or bother Dr. Melfi. Makazian asks if he'll get the usual wage for doing his job. Tony reminds Makazian that the Knicks lost last night so he is down $2,000. Makazian asks in exchange if they'll cut him a break. Tony says it depends on how good of a job he does. At the hospital, Tony, Silvio, Paulie, and Pussy sit with Aprile. Aprile is asleep and the men realize that his condition has turned for the worst. Christopher arrives at the hospital and Tony asks him where he's been. He notices that Christopher is beaten up and Christopher informs Tony that Filone has been murdered. Christopher tells Tony about Filone being shot while lying in his bathtub. Tony thinks that Junior had something to do with the hit. Christopher notes that Palmice is the one that does the hits for Junior and thinks that he murdered Filone. The men suddenly pay attention to Aprile who is in a hallucinating state. He says that he is at the World Trade Center. Christopher is agitated and pulls out a gun. Tony tells Christopher not to go looking for revenge because Palmice is a made man. Christopher is angry that Junior didn't take care of his problems on his own and sent Palmice and the Russians after him. Christopher takes off. Silvio stops Tony and tells him that their response needs to suit the message. Outside, Christopher tells Tony that Filone didn't deserve to die like that and tells Tony that he can't talk him out of killing Palmice. Tony tells Christopher that he cannot kill Palmice. Christopher reminds Tony that Junior is hounding him and they need to do something. Paulie steps out and tells Tony that he'll take care of Palmice since he knows where he lives. Tony tells them that he will handle it and warns Christopher to stay at the hospital. Tony walks over to the elevator and spots a maintenance man working on some things. Tony eyes a stapler sitting near him and while the man isn't looking, Tony takes it. Outside the restaurant, Palmice is sitting in his car. Tony appears and grabs him. Tony pulls Palmice out and starts to punch him repeatedly. Tony notes that after beating on him, Palmice's suit has been wrinkled. Tony offers to fix it and pulls out the staple gun that he stole. Tony staples the suit repeatedly to Palmice's skin. Palmice screams in pain and Tony hits him again. Tony tells Palmice that the beating was overdue. Tony walks into the restaurant to find Junior eating. Tony confronts Junior and asks him if they are going to stop taking shots at each other before the situation gets out of hand. Junior tells Tony that he could have said hello. Tony tells Junior that the only reason he is here right now is because he loves and respects him. Junior can see through this and tells Tony not to pretend that he's paying respect. He notes that is coming from a man that put his mother in a nursing home. Junior also notes that Christopher and Filone were interfering with his business and he couldn't just look the other way forever. Tony notes that the truck was returned. Junior reminds Tony that there was a previous warning made against the men not to interrupt the trucking business. Tony says that he runs his crew fine and Junior acted to the extreme. Junior tells Tony not to be a judge and notes that he answers to people that are higher up than Tony. Tony tells Junior that Aprile is on his deathbed and can't be bothered. Junior is aware that Christopher makes a lot of money for Tony's crew and says that he should work for him instead. Tony refuses to hand Christopher over to Junior. Junior notes that he showed him his hand and Tony just slapped it away. Tony asks Junior why they can't talk like adults anymore. Junior tells Tony to leave the restaurant. He warns him that the next time he comes here he needs to come heavy or not bother to come. Tony knows Junior doesn't mean that. Junior can't even look Tony straight in the face and Tony leaves. Later that night, Makazian is driving in his police car with his partner. He complains about how the pay scale was frozen by law by the time he got to take the sergeant exam. The other officer notes that they've been following the same couple for over an hour and all they did was eat a meal and watch a movie. Makazian tells his partner that a car that matches the same make and model of the car ahead of them was involved in a homicide. In the car, Dr. Melfi and her date, Randall Curtin, are driving home after the movie. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that her last boyfriend only lasted a week and notes that it's her fault that men don't know how to act. Randall knows that Dr. Melfi wants a man that is sensitive to her needs, but still has some decisiveness to him. Suddenly, the police lights are turned on and Makazian pulls Randall and Dr. Melfi over. Randall is confused and doesn't think he was going over the speed limit. Makazian walks up to the car and gets Randall's license and registration. Randall asks Makazian if he did something wrong. Makazian tells Randall that he crossed the yellow line and asks if he's been drinking. Randall says that they had wine with dinner. Makazian tells Randall to step out of the car. Randall is upset, but Dr. Melfi tells Randall to listen to Makazian. Makazian tells Randal to walk a straight line to him heel to toe. Randall tells Makazian he is being unnecessary and tells him that he's an attorney and knows that he's under the limit. Makazian orders Randall to open his trunk. Randall is baffled and tells Makazian that he isn't opening his trunk citing that Makazian has no probable cause to do that. Makazian mocks him and then notes that he's going to resist arrest. Makazian starts to punch Randall repeatedly and then kicks him when he's on the ground. Dr. Melfi gets out of the car and yells at the cops that what they are doing is illegal. Makazian states that he thought Randall had a weapon. Makazian tells his partner to arrest Randall on DUI, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer. The partner is scared of Makazian's behavior and arrests Randall. Dr. Melfi warns Makazian not to touch her. Makazian suggests to Dr. Melfi that she stay home next time and cook a prime rib. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that she's calling her lawyer and tells the police officers that they are in trouble. The next day, Makazian informs Tony that Dr. Melfi is seeing Randall Curtin, a tax lawyer. Makazian tells Tony that Dr. Melfi arrives at her office at 8 a.m. and leaves at 6 p.m. He adds that Dr. Melfi likes Diet Coke and a tuna sub. He also notes that Dr. Melfi has a three-bedroom condominium in Essex Falls and is divorced with a son. Makazian finally adds that Dr. Melfi sees a psychologist by the name of Elliot Kupferburg. Tony thanks Makazian for his help. Makazian tells Tony that he's willing to put $300 on the Rutgers game. Tony tells Makazian that gambling won't solve all of his problems and leaves. Later that night, Tony sits down with captain Larry Boy Barese and caporegimes Raymond Curto and Jimmy Altieri. They all have a laugh about Tony stapling the suit to Palmice earlier today. Curto doesn't feel sorry for Palmice and notes that he's been a problem for the Mafia since he was young. Barese notes that it won't make things easier for them to do business. Tony notes that Junior is a stubborn man and might heat things up for them. Altieri doesn't know if Junior is stubborn enough to go to war with the rest of the bosses. Barese notes that there hasn't been a war in the Mafia since the Columbo incident. Curto states that it would be a bad idea for anyone in the Mafia to go to war in this day and age. Tony blames all of this on Aprile being sick from his cancer. He thinks all of this would have been prevented if Aprile would have stayed healthy. Tony tells everyone that someone needs to step in for Aprile and take control because without a leader everyone can get away with things. The rest of the men agree with his reasoning. Tony tells Curto that if his father was here he would have been telling him to step in and take the position. Curto notes to Tony that he is the one that should take the spot because that's what his father and Aprile would have wanted. Tony notes that he's still young, but Curto has the age and seniority to step in. Curto adds he has his own problems with a son at home with multiple sclerosis. Tony thinks that Curto is just afraid of the FBI tapping his house with wires. Curto notes that Tony is the smart one in this family and that is why he should be the boss. Altieri agrees with Curto's reasoning. Barese suggests that they all run the Mafia in a council hierarchy. Altieri disagrees and notes that the founders set it up paramilitary style for a reason and states that they need one leader. Curto tells Tony that in the end, he and Junior are going to have to butt heads in the end. Tony says that would be bad because he loves Junior and he also notes that Junior has the New York associates on his side. Barese disagrees with Junior's style and notes that even New York is aware that Junior is controlling from the wrong century. Altieri tells Tony that one day he'll be able to get the position if he really wants it. Curto adds that it's inevitable that Tony will take over. Tony argues that he doesn't want any more disturbances in his life. At school, AJ gets a candy bar out of the vending machine. As he walks down the hall, Jeremy bumps into him. AJ asks what he wants and asks if he told his mother about the fight. Jeremy states that he didn't. AJ tells Jeremy that he owes him $40 for the shirt that he ripped yesterday. Jeremy notes that AJ still owes him money from the Fourth of July. AJ argues that he paid for the bottle rockets. Jeremy says that he was referring to the M-80s that they blew up frogs with. AJ remembers now and notes that it was a cool day. Jeremy lightens up and agrees. AJ gets serious and tells Jeremy that he needs the $40. Jeremy tells AJ he isn't giving it to him and adds that he probably did him a favor since the shirt was stupid looking. AJ tells Jeremy that he is going to give him the money. Jeremy dares him to make him hand it over. AJ hits Jeremy in the back of his head and Jeremy turns around and punches AJ in the nose. The two start to fight again, but their friends pull them apart. The two still want to go at it and the students state that it was a draw since nobody won the fight. Jeremy dares AJ to a fight in the Pit tomorrow after school. At a gardening shop, Tony tries to buy something to save his garden from the bugs. The clerk tries to give him environmentally friendly chemicals, but Tony wants DDT. The clerk notes that it's illegal and tells him that he can't help him. Tony then spots George Piocosta, the father of Jeremy, looking at some plants. Tony greets him and asks him how he's doing. George doesn't look too thrilled to see Tony. Tony remembers that their sons went to Camp Aheka last summer. George is reluctant to say anything, but he tells Tony he does remember. George asks Tony how AJ has been. Tony tells George that AJ is like any kid his age. George sees that Tony has bought an axe from the shop and he is starting to get nervous about what Tony might do with it. George tells Tony that he has to go. Tony suggests that they get together in a few weeks so the boys can hang out. George tells Tony that he doesn't think that Jeremy and AJ are close anymore. Tony tells George that he'll have Carmela call Linda and they'll arrange it. George tells him he'll see him later and then hurries away before Tony says anything else. Tony arrives home and starts to put the groceries away. Tony is starting to breathe very heavily and he suddenly has another panic attack. He passes out onto the floor. Carmela runs downstairs and asks Tony if he's alright. Tony is still conscious and Carmela helps him up. Carmela thought that the medicine was supposed to help his panic attacks. Tony says that it does and notes it's his first one since he started taking the medicine. Carmela suggests that he consults the therapist. Tony tells Carmela that he'll talk about it at his next session. Carmela asks Tony if the therapist has ever asked questions about their marriage. Tony says that all they ever do is talk about everything in his life. Tony tells Carmela that he wants to quit going to therapy. Carmela asks Tony if he talked to the therapist about that. Tony admits that he has. Tony realizes the reason he probably had one was because he didn't take his Prozac and asks Carmela to get it for him. Carmela stays with him for a minute and tells him that she knows that Aprile's cancer has caused a lot of stress. However, she feels that the therapy is helping him. Tony says that he doesn't understand how it is. Carmela says that is the reason he is in therapy because she doesn't understand. Carmela admits to Tony that if he gives up therapy she might reevaluate their marriage. Tony is frustrated and reminds Carmela that he has a very stressful job. Carmela asks if it's more important to have his marriage than anything else. Tony argues that therapy is exposing him to a lot more than he can handle. Carmela tells Tony that if he quits, he is going to have to live with the results. Tony asks Carmela if she's threatening him. Carmela hints that she is and tells Tony to go upstairs himself and get the Prozac. Tony goes to therapy the next day and tells Dr. Melfi about the panic attack. Dr. Melfi asks how long it lasted for and Tony states that it only lasted for thirty seconds and he never lost consciousness. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she'll give him a prescription for Xanax that will hopefully help him get over the short term stresses in his life. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Junior is stressing him out and he might have to do things that he doesn't want to do. He adds that Livia is also treating him badly since he put her in the retirement home. Dr. Melfi thinks that Livia and Junior are playing with him. She notes that there's a book called Strategies for Coping with Elder Family. Tony doesn't think that any book in the world will describe Livia or Junior perfectly. Dr. Melfi notes that it wouldn't hurt for Tony to let Livia believe that she is still in charge. She says that it's the same with treating a child and notes that children like to believe that they are in control. Downtown, Christopher meets with Yo-Yo Mendez. Mendez is glad to see Christopher and notes that he heard about the trip to the Meadowlands that Christopher went on. Christopher asks Mendez for his cut. Mendez informs Christopher that Junior's men came and took it from him. Mendez adds that Junior is now claiming this block is in his territory. Christopher can't believe Mendez just gave them the money. Mendez argues that they were pointing a gun at him. Christopher asks why he didn't call him. Mendez informs Christopher that the word on the street is that he is out of commission. Christopher tells Mendez that he understands, but then kicks Mendez in the stomach. Christopher then takes Mendez's yo-yo and wraps the string around his throat. Christopher tells Mendez that he doesn't care what Junior's boys do to him and tells him that it's still his corner. He warns Mendez that if he ever pays anyone else on the street again, he will come back and cut off his thumbs. Christopher takes the money that Mendez has on him at the time and leaves him beaten and bruised. At the Pit, AJ arrives to get ready for the fight. The crowd is gathered and they see Jeremy coming. AJ gets ready, but Jeremy isn't coming for a fight. Jeremy hands AJ the $40 that he owed him for the shirt. AJ tells Jeremy that he's willing to fight him for it, but Jeremy tells AJ that he can't fight him. AJ asks what he means by that, but Jeremy doesn't have an answer. AJ finally takes the money and tells Jeremy that he knew he would back out. AJ is momentarily triumphant and says that Jeremy is definitely scared of him. One of the boys in the crowd tells AJ that Jeremy isn't afraid of him at all. AJ asks what he means. Nobody in the crowd supports AJ and they leave to go home. It is clear that George told Jeremy not to fight AJ out of fear of Tony. At the Bada Bing, Tony is reading the book that Dr. Melfi recommended. He takes a Xanax to calm his nerves. Tony looks up at the news on the television and sees something that devastates him. The newscaster reports that Aprile died of his cancer at St. Isaac's Hospital. Tony yells for the music to be turned off. The newscaster reports that Aprile was seen as the acting boss for Eckley DiMeo who is serving a life sentence in Springfield Penitentiary. Aprile was made acting boss two years earlier for the North Jersey Mafia. Tony breaks down and starts to cry. He states that he saw Aprile earlier in the day and Aprile swore to him he wouldn't die today. Pussy, Paulie, and Silvio mourn with Tony over Aprile's death. The men get drinks poured and Tony toasts to Aprile's memory. Christopher comes in and states that he heard about Aprile's death. He also informs Tony about the situation on his block from Mendez. Paulie tells Christopher that now isn't the time to deal with business. Christopher argues that Junior is taking this opportunity to move in and they need to stop him. Tony tells Christopher that they need to assess this. Christopher argues that they aren't politicians and further states that this is about respect. Tony again tells Christopher that none of this concerns him. Christopher argues that he represents Tony and he's tired of feeling defeated. Christopher says that this isn't the time for negotiation and states that it's time to go to war. He furthermore states that if Tony does nothing he is going to question his leadership. Tony grabs Christopher and throws him onto the pool table. He warns him to never question his leadership ever again. Christopher insists that he is just saying things like they appear, but relents and tells Tony he still recognizes him as boss. Tony lets go of Christopher and tells him the only reason he didn't go harder on him today was because of Aprile's death. Pussy comments that this will go in the history books as the War of '99 for the Mafia. Tony leaves and Christopher tells the others that they need to go with Tony. Paulie warns Christopher that he needs to listen to what he's told. Tony arrives at the restaurant. He loads a gun and puts it in his pants. He walks inside and tells Junior that he needs to talk to him. Tony admits to Junior that he does have a gun, but he doesn't want to use it. Junior allows Tony to sit down. The two sit in silence for a moment before Tony tells Junior that Aprile died. Junior states that he heard. Tony also notes that they are going to need a leader and tells Junior he doesn't want any confusion or misunderstanding about what he is going to say. Tony notes that the Sopranos have been waiting for some time to step up. Tony then asks Junior if he wants the position and is willing to let him have the leadership in the Mafia. Junior asks if it really is his decision. Tony says it is and adds he can clear it with his captains. Junior and Tony hug and Junior admits he was worried about how the situation would transpire. Tony tells Junior that nobody can believe that he has lost face and asks Junior for Bloomfield and Paving Union to be transferred to his territory. Junior agrees to this and Tony congratulates him. Back at the house, AJ tells Meadow about how he almost got into a fight at school with Jeremy. Meadow asks who won the fight. AJ tells Meadow about Jeremy backing out of the fight. He then mentions about the boy that told him that Jeremy wasn't afraid of him and admits that he doesn't know what he meant. Meadow tells AJ that he can be naïve at times and asks him if he knows what Tony does for a living. AJ says that Tony works with waste management. Meadow asks him if he knows any other garbage men that live in luxury. AJ says Junior also works in the business. Meadow notes that Junior is part of Tony's other family. Meadow sees AJ isn't getting the point and pulls up a website all about the Mafia. She prints out the page about the Mafia and Tony. Later, Dr. Melfi goes to Randall's house to see how he's doing. Dr. Melfi is glad to see that Randall is alright and notes that she tried to call him. Randall informs her that his phone isn't hooked in. Randall tells Dr Melfi that he's worried and he thinks he is losing his mind. He tells her that he was standing in line at the doughnut shop this morning and when the cashier looked at him, he started to shake uncontrollably. He then ran away from the shop. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that he's been through a traumatic experience. Randall admits to her that he is afraid of going outside because he thinks someone is following him. Dr. Melfi tells Randall that she can set him up with one of her friends that deals with post-traumatic stress disorder. Randall asks Dr. Melfi if she can prescribe something to him. Dr. Melfi reminds Randall that she is only his date and not his doctor. Randall understands and apologizes. Back at the Soprano residence, AJ reads over the information that Meadow gave to him. He lies down in bed and looks at a picture of his father and him when they went fishing. As he stares at the photo, he wonders who his father really is. The next day at therapy, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he saw his first dead body when he was only fifteen. He says that it was a man that was murdered by someone. Dr. Melfi isn't totally focused and she admits she wasn't listening to Tony. She tells Tony that she was thinking that she lived in a sheltered existence. Tony asks what she means. Dr. Melfi says she's inside of her office for ten hours each day and she thinks that she is out of touch with the rage that exists in American society. Dr. Melfi tells Tony about Randall being beat up by a police officer. Tony realizes that it was Makazian that beat up Randall. Dr. Melfi states that it was a nightmare for him and for her. She admits she didn't know if the cop was drunk or crazy, but he told her not to go out for prime rib. Tony thinks that the cop was an idiot. Dr. Melfi says that Randall is filing a lawsuit with the city. She says that the worst part about this is that Randall will never be the same again. Tony apologizes to her for that. Dr. Melfi states that it isn't Tony's fault, even though it really is. Dr. Melfi apologizes and says that it's his session that they need to focus on. Tony tells her that he understands since it was traumatizing for her. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if the Xanax is helping. Tony states that he hasn't had any panic attacks since. Dr. Melfi asks if he still has doubts. Tony says that he will still come to therapy and notes that it does have good ideas for him in his life on how to cope. Later, the group attends Aprile's funeral. Silvio takes this time to ask Tony why Junior has been made acting boss and no Tony. Tony tells Silvio that Junior is content and thinks that he is the leader. However, Tony says that everyone knows that he makes the decisions in the Mafia. Altieri notes that he is concerned about the money. Tony tells Altieri that he is too concerned about things and that is his major problem. Tony notes that Junior is unaware of the kick back to Aprile. Tony says that with Junior receiving the title he is a happy camper. Silvio comes to realize that Junior will be focused on and they will be able to run things undetected by the police. Hesh agrees that Tony made the smart move. Barese adds that now Tony has control of Bloomfield and the union. Altieri warns Tony that he needs to keep Junior in line. Tony says that he can and notes that he is Junior's favorite nephew. The men throw their soil and flowers on Aprile's coffin. Tony looks down for a brief second and continues to walk on. AJ watches from afar at his father interacting with everyone. Christopher tells Tony that the FBI is watching the funeral and taking pictures. Meadow also sees AJ watching and gives him a look that tells him that she was right. AJ watches as Paulie whispers something to Tony. Tony smiles at AJ when he sees him watching on and the episode ends with AJ staring in concern back at his father."

Paulie and Silvio sit outside to guard while Tony, Junior, Palmice, Barese, Curto, and Altieri meet. Junior states that they have all figured everything out in case the indictments occur. Junior asks Altieri if all of his concerns were answered. Altieri states that a lot of ground was covered and he's satisfied. The meeting is adjourned. After the rest of the captains leave, Junior and Palmice stop Tony. Junior states that he has no doubt that Altieri is the rat. Tony agrees and notes that they had a meeting about things that they already discussed. Tony knows that Altieri is wearing a wire. Junior tells Tony he is giving him approval to take out a hit on Altieri and adds that Tony needs to send a message to everyone else about it. Tony thanks Junior and Palmice and they part. When Junior and Palmice leave, Tony smirks after them. Later that night, Christopher takes Altieri to a hotel. The two have a conversation about the different types of girls that they like. Altieri notes that he heard Christopher hated Russian girls. Christopher states he was just bitter about one that used to hang out with Junior, but Tony's mistress, Irina, is very fine. Christopher states that the girls they are seeing tonight are friends of Irina's. Altieri asks Christopher if he has enough cologne on. Christopher states that he is wearing enough. Altieri states that Christopher has the advantage since he's younger. Christopher promises Altieri that he'll be happy after tonight. The men arrive at the hotel room and knock on the door. One of the girls comes outside into the hallway. She looks at Altieri in a seductive way and heads over to the next room to get the other girl. Altieri is really excited and heads into the room with Christopher. Christopher offers Altieri a seat and Altieri sits down. When he does, Silvio bursts into the room. Altieri tries to draw his weapon, but Christopher is able to stop him from drawing. Silvio aims a silenced pistol at Altieri's head. Altieri curses at the men and asks them if they are aware he is a captain. Silvio suggests to Altieri that he call for help on his FBI wire. Altieri realizes that they've found out he's a rat. Silvio realizes that Altieri probably isn't wearing a wire tonight. Christopher adds that Altieri didn't have time to put anything decent on. Altieri mutters forgiveness to God and Silvio shoots him. Blood spatter and brain matter hit the table and lamp in front of him and Altieri falls to the floor dead. At the Soprano residence, Meadow and her boyfriend are having a romantic night while watching a scary movie. The boyfriend stops for a moment and tells Meadow he thinks that someone is at her back gate. Meadow turns off the television and listens to see if she hears something. Outside, someone is heard calling the name, Settimia. The two freak out and wonder what is going on. Meadow sees Livia outside and wonders how she got out of Green Grove. AJ hears the noise from upstairs as well and gets some clothes on. Livia shouts outside and yells for Cakey to go get Settimia. AJ shouts down to Livia and says it's only him. Livia states that Cakey sounds like he has whooping cough and tells AJ to get under the vaporizer. Meadow runs to the back door to let Livia in. Livia still thinks Meadow is Settimia and she tells her that she is never speaking to her again. Meadow tries to calm down Livia and tells her that Settimia is dead and she is Meadow. Livia seems to become her old self again and remembers Meadow. She tells Meadow that she can't stay in the house after all that's happened. The doorbell rings and AJ answers the door. A police officer comes into the home. Livia asks the police officer to take Settimia out of her house. The officer notes that it is one in the morning and asks Livia why she's walking out alone this late at night. Livia tells him to shut up. The police officer tells Meadow that they got some complaints from the neighbors. Meadow tells the officer that Livia is their grandmother. The officer asks Livia if she knows these children. Livia says that she knows Meadow and AJ are her grandchildren. The next day at therapy, Dr. Melfi asks Tony about Livia coming to the house last night. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that she thought she was going to see her sister, Settimia. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that Livia is getting tested for Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Melfi notes that it's been a long odyssey with Livia. Tony agrees that things have been difficult. Tony is upset and tells Dr. Melfi that Green Grove is transferring Livia to the nursing unit in the home which she dreaded all along. Dr. Melfi notes that it's interesting that her memory loss started after he was almost killed. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if he really thinks it was a carjacking. Tony admits to her that he knows it wasn't a carjacking and he thinks that he knows who was behind everything. He says that he isn't going to go there with the conversation. Dr. Melfi thinks that Tony is overall reluctant to even confront the situation. She notes that around the time of the shooting he was having hallucinations of Isabella who was seen as a protective and loving mother. Dr. Melfi believes that Tony's subconscious was telling him something. Dr. Melfi notes that before the shooting Tony had mentioned Livia talking about news stories of mothers that were throwing their babies out windows. Tony is getting really agitated and tells Dr. Melfi to stop talking indirectly. Tony asks Dr. Melfi if she is really trying to tell him that Livia tried to have him murdered because of the fact he put Livia in a nursing home. Dr. Melfi notes that Tony also had the dream where the duck flew away with his penis. Tony notes Livia never threatened to do anything like that to him. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that most patients find their own ways of breaking through their issues, but since Tony's life is in danger she is willing to put the cards on the table to help him. Dr. Melfi honestly believes that Livia has borderline personality disorder. Tony is doubtful, but Dr. Melfi reads it from her book. The book says that borderline personality disorder involves unstable relationships, affective instability, intense anxiety, and joylessness. Dr. Melfi further adds that the phobias and paranoia are the only things that seem real while the real world and real people are peripheral and have no love or compassion for others. Livia is known to create bitterness and conflict amongst members of their family and that encompasses borderline personality disorder. Tony throws the glass table across the room and shatters. Tony gets straight into Dr. Melfi's face and curses at her. He states that they are talking about his mother and that is not a light subject. He tells Dr. Melfi that he is done with therapy and doesn't want to meet with her any longer. He notes that she is lucky he doesn't give her a good beating before he leaves. Tony leaves the office. Dr. Melfi locks her door and puts a chair in front of it so Tony can't get back inside. At Vesuvio, Rosalie tells Carmela that Aprile's work in the Mafia was what killed him because the stress caused the cancer. Carmela notes that when Aprile was the boss everything was peaceful and Tony's attempted assassination put an end to that peace. Rosalie notes that it's hard to say how Aprile would have ended up if he had lived longer. Rosalie notes that Angie Bonpensiero has been a shell since Pussy disappeared. Artie comes out and serves the women some food. Carmela notes that with the way Artie is serving them food they will walk out of the restaurant as hippos. Rosalie honestly tells Artie she thinks that the new restaurant is better than the old Vesuvio was. Artie says that there are just a few things that need to be worked out with the new restaurant and then it will be ready to run. Artie is happy that he got the insurance money for the restaurant. Artie asks Carmela about Livia. Carmela tells Artie that the doctors think Livia is displaying signs of Alzheimer's. Artie is sad to hear that and notes that he's known Livia since he was little. He notes that Tony is probably a wreck and Carmela tells him that Tony is beside himself at this point. Artie notes that Tony has a lot on his plate right now and leaves the women so they can eat. Artie goes back into the kitchen to find Charmaine preparing food. Artie asks her why she's hiding in the kitchen and notes that Carmela and Rosalie are sitting outside. Artie asks Charmaine when she is going to be willing to bury the hatchet. Charmaine tells Artie that Carmela is like a sister to her, but that she doesn't want the new Vesuvio to be another hangout for the Mafia. Artie notes that publicity like that is good for the restaurant, but Charmaine disagrees saying that is publicity they need to avoid. Back in the dining room, Father Intintola has joined the women at their table. Rosalie is glad that Father Intintola was able to make it to the restaurant and notes to him that the food is great. Father Intintola feels that something special is going on if the women were invited to the restaurant before the grand opening. Father Intintola tells Rosalie that he was over at Carmela's last night making zabaglione with her. Carmela tells Father Intintola he did most of the cooking of the food. Father Intintola wishes that Tony would have allowed him a moment to talk about the carjacking. Carmela agrees with him. Father Intintola tells the ladies that he has to return to his table to order some food. Carmela tells Father Intintola to sit with them. Rosalie agrees and asks Father Intintola how the watch is. Father Intintola tells her that the watch works perfectly and thanks her. Carmela looks at the watch and asks Rosalie if it was Aprile's watch. Rosalie says that it is and she softly sobs in remembrance of Aprile. Father Intintola holds Rosalie's hand, softly stroking it. Carmela takes notice to this gesture. Later that night, a man walks down an alley after buying several cases of beer. He suddenly trips and spills everything on the ground. When he gets up, he sees Altieri's dead body with a rat stuffed in his mouth. In an undisclosed location, Agent Harris leads Tony into a room with several FBI agents. Agent Harris tells them that Tony came willingly. Tony states he only came because Agent Harris threatened to wait until Meadow and AJ got home. Tony arrives downstairs to see Agent Grasso and Chief Frank Cubitoso. Tony takes a seat in a chair. Chief Cubitoso notes to Tony that they are all aware that there was an attempt on his life a few days ago. They know that Tony has enemies and he may be through with holding any type of power in New Jersey. Tony tells Chief Cubitoso that he already had this conversation with Agent Harris and once again states that he is not going to help them. Chief Cubitoso shows Tony a tape with a recording on it, but Tony still has no interest in anything. Chief Cubitoso tells Tony that he and Agent Grasso had a colloquy about their shared Italian heritage. Chief Cubitoso says that they all come from different parts of Italy, but they all share common cultural ideas. Chief Cubitoso says there might be a chance Tony will change his mind about testifying. Tony tells Chief Cubitoso to get to the point. Chief Cubitoso plays the tape where Junior and Livia had a conversation about the hit on Tony. In the conversation, Junior alludes to the fact that Tony had her put in a nursing home and Livia tells Junior that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist and she only wonders what he tells them. Tony realizes the FBI wired Green Grove. Chief Cubitoso takes credit for this and notes everyone else thought it was a waste of time. Chief Cubitoso fast forwards through parts of the tape and starts to play it again at the part when Livia tells Junior about Cakey after his lobotomy looked like Tony and it was better that Cakey died than live in a lobotomized state. Tony continues to listen as Livia tells Junior that Altieri, Barese, and Curto all met in Green Grove after their mother moved in. Tony then hears Junior making the statement that he has to kill Tony. Tony has a lot to take in. At the nursing unit, Artie visits Livia in her room. Artie asks Livia if she remembers who he is. Livia says that she does remember Artie and mistakenly says that he and John played baseball together. Artie corrects her and says that he played baseball with Tony. Livia tells Artie that she remembers now and asks him what is wrong with her. She asks Artie how he's doing. Artie tells her that he's doing great. Livia asks Artie how his mother is doing and asks if he calls her every day. Artie reminds Livia that his mother passed away almost six months ago. Artie tells Livia he brought her something from Vesuvio. Livia says she does remember Vesuvio and remembers that Artie's father used to be the owner. Artie says that she is right and tells her that he has a new restaurant now. Artie has brought Livia some Cavatelli. Livia doesn't seem happy about it. Artie asks Livia what is wrong. Livia tells Artie that he is a good man for coming to visit her. She tells him that after what Tony did to him she doesn't see how she can look Artie in the face. Artie asks Livia what Tony did. Livia tells him that she doesn't see how he can't blame Tony for setting fire to Vesuvio. Artie is taken aback by this news. Livia says that Artie is a good man if he can forgive Tony for that and notes that they are lucky that nobody was killed in the fire. At the Bada Bing, Paulie and Christopher are hanging out in the backroom. Paulie tells Christopher that Altieri's wake is tonight. Christopher tells Paulie it will be ruined because he phoned in a bomb scare. Silvio thinks Christopher may have went a little over the top with that. Tony comes into the room and the three are at attention when he does. Tony tells the men that it was Junior and Palmice that took out the hit against him. Christopher notes that this shouldn't be surprising news. Paulie asks Tony how he knows for sure. Tony says that there is no room for interpretation for that question. Silvio can't believe Junior would kill his own nephew. Tony tells the men that they need to plan things out and make no mistakes. Paulie thinks that Junior is going to try and figure out how to finish Tony off first. Christopher adds that this time Junior won't just give out the hit to a couple of gangsters. Silvio states that Junior might give the hit to Signore because Palmice has been given a huge promotion so he won't just be a hitman. Tony states that Signore has to disappear without anyone knowing. Tony states he just passed his Coast Guard test, which means he knows what he's going to do. Paulie asks Tony if there is anything else. Tony tells them that his ear hurts. At the Soprano residence, Carmela gives Tony a sleeping pill so he can actually get some rest tonight. Tony asks Carmela what kind of a person he is if his own mother wants him killed. Carmela tells Tony that the problem doesn't lie with Tony, but with Livia. She says that everyone knows Livia has always been a different sort of breed. Tony states that it isn't the point. Carmela reminds Tony that over the years, Livia's condition has steadily become worse. Carmela is surprised that there aren't any contracts on Tony's sisters for abandoning Livia. Carmela tells Tony that he is the better person for trying to make Livia's relationship with the family work. Tony says that after two men with nine millimeter pistols tried to kill him, his self-esteem was drained. Carmela says that she could kill Livia with her own hands at this point. Tony tells Carmela that she needs to play the card of the concerned daughter-in-law and not let Livia suspect anything. Carmela tells Tony that she isn't concerned about business at this point and even states she thinks Livia's Alzheimer's is an act so she can't be held responsible. Tony knows that he and Junior have had their problems with business, but he thinks Junior is also angry at Tony because he made fun of him for his great performance of oral sex. He says that oral sex and psychiatry caused this war. Carmela tells Tony he had to see the psychiatrist because of Livia. Tony says that when he sees the guys all he can feel is humiliation. Tony tells Carmela he is going to take care of Junior and Palmice and from that he'll get satisfaction. The next day, Tony parks his car along the shore. Silvio opens the trunk and gets out a huge fish. Tony walks down the boardwalk and sees Chucky Signore in his new boat. Signore is startled to see Tony and asks him what he's doing here. Tony tells Signore he is here to take his new boat, the Stugots, out onto the river. Tony is holding the large fish in his hand and tells Signore to look at how great the fish is. Tony reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a gun. He shoots Signore until the clip is empty. Signore's dead body falls into the boat. Silvio pulls out some chains and cinderblocks from the trunk of the car. Tony and Silvio get into the boat and drive it out onto the river. Dr. Melfi is about to leave her office when Tony arrives. When Dr. Melfi sees him, she shuts the door and locks him out. Tony pleads with her to open the door because he needs to talk to her. Dr. Melfi is too frightened by the events that happened earlier in the day for her to listen to him. Dr. Melfi tells Tony she is calling the police because he has given her no other option but to do so. Tony again asks her to open up. Dr. Melfi dials the police and tells Tony that if anything happens to her the police will hear it on the other end of the phone. Tony says that they can go down to the coffee shop to talk if she is more comfortable with that. Dr. Melfi asks Tony if she has his word that he will not harm her physically. Tony says that she has his word nothing will happen to her. Dr. Melfi hangs up the phone. She takes a pair of scissors and puts them under the sleeve of her outfit. She turns on the lights and unlocks the door. Dr. Melfi sits behind her desk and Tony sits on the other end. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that she isn't happy that she was right about Livia. She asks Tony if he's had any dreams since he heard the FBI tapes. Tony says he has had some sex dreams involving Jeanie Cusamano. Tony says that he is making love with Jeanie Cusamano in his dreams, but he can never see her face. Dr. Melfi thinks that this might be feelings of worthlessness over the fact that Livia tried to have him killed. Tony tells them that one of the reasons that he was almost killed was because he was seeing her for therapy. Dr. Melfi tells Tony that their conversations are privileged and she can't be compelled to testify against anyone. Tony says that his enemies might know that, but they might not. Dr. Melfi notes that she doesn't even know any of Tony's associates because he never mentioned them by name. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he feels she is danger. Dr. Melfi doesn't think that is a fair assessment at all. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that nobody cares about fair in his line of work. Dr. Melfi asks Tony what she's supposed to do about that. Tony tells her that she needs to get out of town tonight. Dr. Melfi states that she can't just leave on short notice. She states that she has a life and patients to tend to. She notes that some of her patients are fragile and could commit suicide while she's away. Tony states that if Dr. Melfi is killed then it won't change the difference of their outcomes. Tony tells Dr. Melfi that he is sorry about all of this and assures her that he is going to take care of the problem and then she can come back. Dr. Melfi knows that people are going to be killed. Tony tells her not to worry about that and tells her instead to take care of herself. Tony adds that the police aren't going to give her anything because she can't give them any information. Tony tells her again that she needs to leave town. He tells her that she has been a good doctor to him and he appreciates that. He leaves the office. Tony arrives at Satriale's to find Artie in the parking lot. Artie has a rifle in his hands and he aims it at Tony. Tony asks Artie what is going on. Artie asks Tony how he could have done what he did. Tony thinks that Junior hired Artie to kill him and tells him to just pull the trigger because he doesn't care anymore. Artie tells Tony that the restaurant was like his child and three generations of his family worked over the same stoves. Artie tells Tony that even Livia cherishes all of her memories at Vesuvio. Artie tells Tony not to say that Livia is lying because there is no reason for Livia to do that. Tony asks Artie what Livia told him. Artie asks Tony that he not treat him like he's stupid. He is angry because when Tony set fire to Vesuvio he made Artie part of a criminal conspiracy. Tony states to Artie that he doesn't know what Livia told him, but he says that they do know that two arson investigators stated that the fire was an accident. Tony asks Artie why he would even blow up Vesuvio. Artie yells that he believes that it was because Tony thought in a twisted way that blowing up the restaurant would stop a hit that Junior was going to stage in Vesuvio. Artie asks Tony what kind of sick logic that is. Tony asks Artie to think about it and ask him if he's stupid enough to do that. Tony tells Artie that Livia is going senile and even Artie can see that. Artie sobs and says that he does love his new restaurant a lot, but it'll never be Vesuvio. Tony swears to God that he never burnt down Vesuvio. Artie tells Tony to look him in the eye and swear it to him again. Tony again swears to Artie that he didn't burn down Vesuvio and he swears on Livia. Artie lowers the rifle and then smashes it to pieces against his car. He gets in and peels out of the lot. At the Soprano residence, Junior and Livia once again join the family for a meal. Tony states that it's nice that they all are able to eat a Sunday dinner together. Nobody else is really talking. Carmela breaks the silence and tells Livia that the nursing unit is good if they let the patients out for family occasions. Livia says that she doesn't have anything to admit. Meadow tells everyone she needs to leave in ten minutes to study with Hunter. Livia asks them if the pork is cooked. Tony recognizes that Meadow is going to be on her own soon and AJ will follow a few years after. Livia tells everyone that last week in the paper she read about a family in Saint Luis Obispo that died of trichinosis which can be found in uncooked pork. Tony notes that the article was in the paper last year. Livia mocks that Tony knows everything. Tony asks Junior about the indictments. Junior says that his lawyer told him that the indictment hasn't been released yet. Carmela asks Livia if she agrees that business should not be discussed at the table. Livia doesn't say anything. Tony asks Livia if Artie came by to see her the other day. Livia asks Tony who Artie is. Tony reminds Livia that Artie is a friend of his from elementary school that owns a restaurant. Livia says that she doesn't remember seeing anyone named Artie and asks if he's talking about visiting in the house or elsewhere. Tony and Junior look at Livia, both of them knowing that Livia is putting on an act. At the church, Artie visits Father Intintola and tells him that he's lost his belief in everything. Father Intintola notes that Artie moved away from God some time ago. Father Intintola asks if it's fair to say that recent events were not the cause of his move from God. Artie says it is fair to say that. He tells Father Intintola that every time he comes to church his mind begins to wander. He says he can only stare at the stained glass and he's full of rage. He tells Father Intintola that he doesn't just hate Tony, but all men and life. Father Intintola asks Artie if he tried to talk to Charmaine about this. Artie states that he can't do that because it would ruin her. Father Intintola states that Charmaine is a strong woman and she will find out one way or the other. Artie says he didn't go to the insurance when the restaurant was burned down. He says that legally he could have been hit with a defamation suit. Father Intintola tells Artie that his heart is telling him the answer. He knows that Artie hasn't told Charmaine because she is going to tell him to go to the police and this will jeopardize his new restaurant. Father Intintola tells Artie that he needs to stay strong. Artie tells Father Intintola that he is getting off of the important subject. At Satriale's, Christopher arrives late to a meeting where Paulie, Silvio, and Tony are waiting. Tony tells the men that he has something to tell them and he wanted them to hear it from him. Tony takes a deep breath and tells them that for the last five months he's been seeing a psychiatrist because of his panic attacks. The men stay silent for several moments and Tony asks them to all speak their minds. Silvio tells Tony that he trusts that he did this with complete discretion. Silvio also speaks on behalf of Pussy and notes that Pussy would feel the same way. Tony assures them he never spoke of business and the psychiatrist doesn't know anyone's names. Tony adds Junior knows that he is seeing a psychiatrist and is using that as a reason for the war. Tony tells them that if there is anything they want to see they need to say it now because this discussion is not happening again. Paulie tells Tony he's heard worse things in life and he was seeing a therapist a year ago. The men are surprised by this. Paulie states he had issues and has since resolved them. Silvio says that their business is struggling and he thinks it would be appropriate for them to discuss their painful and stressful times, but he knows that will never happen. Tony asks Christopher how he is feeling about this. Christopher asks Tony if it's like marriage counseling. Tony says it's similar. Christopher gets up and leaves the room. Carmela arrives at the church to visit Father Intintola. When she gets there, she finds Father Intintola sitting with Rosalie in his study. He is eating some of her baked ziti and they are discussing food. She sees Rosalie wipe some of the ziti off of his face and the two are smiling and laughing. Carmela is hurt by this scene and she walks outside. She dumps the food she made for Father Intintola into the garbage can and leaves. At Vesuvio, Artie sits down to eat a meal while Charmaine discusses with Adriana a job proposal. Charmaine is pleased with Adriana's abilities and tells her that she's hired. After she leaves, Charmaine sits with Artie and tells him that Adriana catches on to things very fast and is proud of the fact that Adriana wants to be a music manager. Charmaine tells Artie that everything is going well. Artie smiles at her happiness. Charmaine asks Artie what it was he wanted to tell her. Artie tells her that he likes the bar stools and that's what he wanted to tell her. Tony comes downstairs in the morning very happy. Meadow is the first to notice this. At Palmice's house, Palmice yells into the house after JoJo and tells her that if Signore calls the house she needs to call him and tell him. When she doesn't respond, Palmice curses and asks if she heard him. JoJo comes to the door and yells that she heard him the first time. Palmice tells JoJo to go take a Midol. JoJo flips Palmice the middle finger behind his back and slams the door shut. Palmice begins his morning jog. As he runs down a back road, a car begins to slowly follow him. Palmice takes notice to it and he continues to run. He doesn't like the scene and suddenly bolts into the woods. Christopher and Paulie are in the car and they get out to pursue him. Palmice is a fast runner and Christopher and Paulie have to work hard to catch up to him. Christopher fires several shots at him as he runs, but misses. Paulie runs right into a poison ivy patch and curses as he makes his way through. Palmice comes upon a small brook and trips as he tries to cross it. He falls into the water and tries to get up. Christopher catches up to Palmice and puts a bullet in his leg. Palmice falls down in pain and begs Christopher not to kill him. Paulie catches up and complains to Christopher that he got poison ivy all over his face and hands. Christopher tells Palmice that he knows that he shot Filone and never gave him a chance at all. Palmice tries to convince Christopher that it was Junior that shot Filone, not him. Christopher is not stupid and doesn't believe that at all. Paulie complains that the poison ivy is starting to make him itchy already. Against Palmice's pleas, Christopher and Paulie empty their gun magazines into Palmice's body. Palmice's body is riddle with bullets and he lets out one last groan before dying in the brook. Palmice's cell phone begins to ring as Paulie and Christopher leave the murder scene. Later, FBI agents move in to make their arrests in relation to the indictment. Agents are seen going to Junior's house first. Junior looks out the window instead of answering the door, but the FBI see him. They tell him that he is under arrest. Junior realizes the trouble he is in. FBI agents are later seen making arrests at Larry Boy Barese and Joseph ""Beppy"" Sasso's houses. Tony later watches on the news as Junior, Barese, Sasso, and 13 other members of the Soprano Crime Family were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Tony realizes that the FBI moved in before he was able to take care of Junior and notes that Junior is lucky to be alive. Meadow comes into her parents' room and sees Junior being led away on the television in handcuffs. Tony tells Meadow that he is ashamed that the police are making a decent businessman like Junior do the perpetrator walk. Meadow tells Tony not to act like he feels bad. On the news, U.S. Attorney Gene Conigliaro tells the viewers that the arrests were made after a long investigation of criminal activities that have taken place over the last four years. Conigliaro states that these arrests represent the heaviest blow to Mafia activities in New Jersey since the arrests in the 1980s. AJ comes into the room and Meadow tells him about Junior being arrested. AJ originally thinks that is cool, but Tony gives him a little smack on the back of his head for making that remark. The reports also state that among the people that were not arrested was Mikey Palmice and reports indicate that Palmice may have fled town when he heard about the indictments. JoJo Palmice insists that she knows nothing about Palmice's whereabouts. JoJo appears on the news and tells the reporters that Palmice went out for a jog to try out his new running shoes and he would be back later. JoJo cries and says that Palmice told her that he loved her and left, while we know that is not how Palmice acted when he left the house. Tony smiles to himself knowing the truth that Palmice is dead. The phone rings and one of Tony's government sources is on the phone. Down in the kitchen, Tony tells Carmela that the indictments sound better than they actually are. Tony says the reason he wasn't on the indictment was because the investigation was against Junior and Barese for a calling-card scam they were both working through as well as a Diamante technical stock. Tony says that since he wasn't involved in those activities he wasn't named. Tony does note to Carmela that Altieri did provide the FBI with some information before he was killed and the FBI does have information from his group from the meetings at Green Grove. Carmela realizes that the DA told Tony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Green Grove meetings. Tony says that everyone says that just so the case looks good, but he knows that they need to worry about that later. Tony's concerns are for the men that were arrested today and whether they will turn informant to avoid prosecution. Artie sees Father Intintola at his restaurant. Father Intintola asks him how he's doing. Artie tells him that business is good. Artie tells Father Intintola he wants to thank him for talking to him yesterday. Father Intintola asks Artie if he talked with Charmaine. Artie tells Father Intintola he didn't. He tells Father Intintola that in the church he thought about it and realizes that he can be a yes person or a no person. Father Intintola is confused about what Artie is trying to say. Artie says that Livia was always a negative person and as a kid he would hate to hear her rants. Father Intintola notes that Artie did say Tony was an unstable person. Artie says that he was angry at the time and states that while Tony is confusing and a little comfortable outside of the law he does know that doubting him would add to his sorrow. He says he doesn't see how he can take Livia's word over Tony's. Father Intintola states that Artie seems to be at peace and Artie says that he is. Later, Junior meets with Conigliaro in jail. Conigliaro notes that Junior's tenure as boss was relatively short and unusual in several ways. Conigliaro tells Junior that he is willing to drop all of the charges against him if he testifies that Tony is the boss of the New Jersey Family along with the help of the New York Syndicate in communication with Johnny Sack. Conigliaro tells Junior he wants to arrest Johnny Sack along with associates Mangano and Teresi. Junior retorts he wants a relationship with Angie Dickinson and notes that they will have to see who gets lucky first. Conigliaro asks Junior to corroborate information from informants and wiretaps that he was allowed to profit with Tony as boss, but he wasn't allowed to make policy and was left out of the loop. Conigliaro asks Junior how long he is willing to take the hits for Tony. He notes Junior is 70-years-old and asks him how long he thinks he has. Junior tells Conigliaro that Tony is not running things and as long as he's around, that will never happen. Carmela arrives home to find Father Intintola in the kitchen. Father Intintola takes the shopping bags out of her hands and puts them on the table. Carmela asks Father Intintola how he got inside. Father Intintola tells Carmela that Liliana let him in and then told him she had to leave early. Father Intintola tells Carmela to be careful of the upcoming storm that will hit New Jersey. Carmela asks Father Intintola if he wants coffee. Father Intintola states that if Carmela is making it then he does. Carmela asks Father Intintola not to start that behavior. Father Intintola tells her that it's practically cocktail hour. He asks Carmela how she is doing in lieu of the indictments. Carmela states that they are doing fine. Father Intintola refers back to their discussion a few months ago and asks Carmela if these recent events have compelled Tony to re-examine his life. Carmela isn't paying attention and sees a bag on the counter thinking that Meadow bought something with her credit card. Father Intintola states that it is his purchase and he says he bought the movie, One True Thing. He says he bought it so they could watch it and she could take her mind off of the stressors. The two drink their wine and Carmela asks Father Intintola if he's staying for dinner. Father Intintola knows something is wrong and asks Carmela if she needs to tell him something. Carmela says she wants to know so she can figure out how many steaks to defrost since Tony won't be home. Father Intintola tries to tell Carmela his concern is for Tony. Carmela tells Father Intintola that they both know that Tony doesn't care about examining his life. Father Intintola states that is the big reason why they need to talk to him. Carmela states that Tony is a sinner and Father Intintola comes into his home, eats his steaks, and uses the television and entertainment center. Father Intintola states that the DVD is for her. Carmela notes that last week she told him that she didn't like Renee Zellweger. Father Intintola admits he doesn't remember hearing that. Carmela states that if Father Intintola wants to watch One True Thing, then he can at least admit his true intentions. Carmela knows he only does this for the women to get gifts and great meals. Father Intintola is insulted by this, but Carmela states that she also feels he likes the whiff of sexuality that he feels but can't act on. Father Intintola notes he did admit that he had feelings for her, but that he has been dealing with them so he can continue to pastoral duties. Carmela asks Father Intintola how Rosalie fits into this equation. Father Intintola realizes why Carmela feels the way she does. Carmela tells Father Intintola she appreciates his religious counseling and their chats and she is fond of him, but she thinks he needs to evaluate himself. She thinks he has a goal of manipulating women in need of spiritual guidance. Father Intintola is left speechless and he leaves the home. At the nursing unit, Tony grabs a pillow off of a gurney and starts to walk down the hall. A nurse stops him and tells him that she is glad Carmela found him. Tony is confused and asks what she is talking about. The nurse is aware that nobody informed him yet of the situation. The nurse tells Tony that Livia has had a stroke. She tells Tony that the news of Junior's arrest upset Livia and the EMTs have just stabilized her for the ride to St. Vincent's Hospital. Tony spots the EMTs taking Livia out. Tony stops them and gets down to Livia's level. He tells her that he knows what she did and he can't believe she would do this to him. The EMT tells Tony that her speech has been affected by the stroke and Livia can't answer him. Tony disregards this. He tells Livia that he heard the FBI tapes and she knows what she tried to do. The EMT again tries to get Tony away from Livia, but Tony orders him not to get in the way. Tony tells Livia that Junior is in jail now and he is now on top. He tells Livia that he doesn't die easy and he will live a long, happy life unlike Livia's state. Security tries to take Tony away, but he is able to get free from them. Tony yells that he tried to be there for her and she tried to have him killed. He starts to get very angry when he sees what he thinks to be a smile on Livia's face. The nurse tries to tell Tony that Livia doesn't understand anything right now, but Tony is too angry. Livia is led out and Tony is also taken out by hospital security. Later, Tony drives around the city trying to take everything in. He stops at Dr. Melfi's office. When he walks in, a janitor is cleaning her office. He tells Tony that she went on vacation. The power suddenly goes off in the office. Tony realizes that Dr. Melfi took his advice and left town. He hopes that she is safe. Tony, Carmela, Meadow, and AJ are later driving in the storm. Meadow tells Tony that he should pull over because they aren't going to make it to Aunt Patty's house. Tony replies that there's a reason he bought the SUV so they could get through the rain. Carmela states that Meadow is right and states that she can barely see the road in front of them. Tony realizes they are on Walnut Parkway and states he has an idea. The SUV pulls over and everyone grabs umbrellas. They knock on the doors to Nuovo Vesuvio and Artie opens the doors. Carmela tells Artie that they picked up the kids at school, but they can't get home because a tree is down on their street. Tony states they've been on the road since seven o'clock and everyone is hungry. Artie states that he has no power and he's closing when the last customers leave. Meadow tells Tony that McDonald's will be opened for sure. Artie doesn't want to disappoint them and tells them to come inside. Paulie and Silvio are inside taking cover from the rain. Paulie has some cream on his face and hands to stop the itching from the poison ivy. Tony greets them. Adriana and Christopher are also inside eating. Charmaine tells Meadow and AJ that Chiara and her siblings are in the kitchen playing games if they want to go back and see them. The two head to the back. Artie tells Tony that they've been cooking by candlelight and says he can make them certain things. Tony asks for whatever he has prepared. At their table, Silvio notices the young love that Adriana and Christopher have for each other. Paulie asks Silvio how he really feels about Tony seeing a psychiatrist. Silvio tells Paulie he's fine with it, and suggests to Paulie that he learn to sit right with it as well. Silvio doesn't understand why Paulie is bothered when he admitted to also seeing a psychiatrist. Paulie says he just can't get past the fact Tony is seeing a female psychiatrist. Silvio notes that Paulie is the one with women issues and says he doesn't want to go there with him. Paulie says that he has said is piece. Silvio asks Paulie what he's really trying to say. Paulie says he isn't getting at any point. Silvio notes to Paulie that Tony is going to be the new boss of the family and they need to wish him the best of luck. Paulie agrees. Artie brings Tony and Carmela their food. Meadow and A.J. come back out to join them. The family thanks Artie for the great service. Before the family eats, Tony tells them that he wants to propose a toast. He says that someday soon, Meadow and A.J. will have families of their own. He says that if they're lucky they will remember the little moments like this that were good. He toasts to all of them and they drink to their good health. The episode ends with the family eating together at the table."

After she enters a subway train, she is pinned down against the wall of the subway car and raped. The SVU team gets involved and it is soon revealed that seven young women, in a six-month time span, have been raped by a flash-and-dash assailant on the City subways. Interviewing witnesses on the train results in no substantial leads, except that the preps pants were dirty and had splatters of paint on them.

The brass calls in a psychiatrist - Dr Audrey Jackson (Audra McDonald) to help the team get into the head of the prep. A man - Bruce Bohne is apprehended in the subway train after he allegedly attacks another woman. He is arrested but he claims that the train jerked and made him fall on the woman and all this is a mistake. The 7 victims are asked to identify the prep from a lineup and they all fail to identify the perp. SVU decides to indite him on a lesser charge of fondling. Dr Jackson interviews the suspect and suggests that Bruce is NOT the subway rapist and SVU lets him go.

After another rape on the subway occurs, Jeffries and Munch find a parking ticket. When they follow up on the lead, the perp is found at a construction site. Although Jen Caulder positively identifies her rapist the case is dismissed on a technicality as all the victims spoke to each other while waiting for their turn to identify the perp from the line up.

SVU then follows up on driver's license of a woman found in the perps wallet, who could put him away."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0629714/?ref_=ttep_ep20,,An investigative reporter bravely airs a piece about her own rape that occurred 2 months earlier. Her description of the men that attacked her results in fresh leads and unexpected turns of events along the way.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Alexander Cassini'],"['', '', '']",[],"['police', 'bare chested male bondage']",[],"Sarah Logan, a field reporter on the news, tells her audience of being raped. She tells them the police have been working her case for 12 weeks with no leads. She asks for their help. She describes one as having a tattoo of a star on his wrists and smelling like cigarettes and the other wore a running suit. She tells her audience she is going to fight back.

A woman watching the news realizes the guy she is with could be one of them, but when she tries to call the police, he stops her. When she does talk to Benson and Stabler, she tells them he is Mark Krieger, a car parts sales rep from Cleveland. She gives them the key to her room. When they go in, he is puking in the toilet. As Benson attempts to read him his rights, he tells her the city will have to pay for his lawyer because he is broke before he pukes again causing Benson to excuse herself.

Stabler tells the team Krieger works in construction and has priors including possession, assaults stemming mostly from bar fights, and kiting checks. Benson tells them he is from Queens, but he told his date different. Stabler informs them the girl knows she was almost the next victim of Mr. Goodbar. Benson tells them he lawyered up immediately. After Munch tells them he always thought it was a crime of opportunity, Jeffries tells them the perps did not even know who Sarah was. Cragen informs them they may end up having to file against Krieger and ""an un-apprehended other,"" but he wants to find the other guy before Krieger gives him a heads up. Cragen tells them to check phone records, employment records, credit card bills, and find the other guy. When the meeting breaks up, Munch asks Cragen if anyone notified Sarah about the suspect. He tells him he thought he should tell her himself.

When Munch goes to tell Sarah about the arrest, she asks if he saw her piece on the news. He tells her it took guts to do that. She asks him to tell her the guy's name, but he reminds her it would jeopardize the line-up. He assures her he will tell her everything when it is over. He informs her she probably will not see the guy again until court.

While Munch and Jeffries search Krieger's apartment, Jeffries guesses he only works as often as he has to. Munch tears part of a poster containing phone numbers. They figure his ashtray collection is from his one-night stands so they take them. They realize the second rapist could be one of opportunity.

In the squad room, Cragen interrupts Benson and Stabler as they look at the bars advertised on the ashtrays. He reminds them of his drinking days. Benson asks him which one is closest to the attack. He responds with Shad's Cabaret adding it is just a bunch of hard working locals and confused out-of-towners. He asks that they let him know if anything has changed. While Munch tells them he came up empty on his calls, Jeffries tells him she found one that knows Krieger.

When Jeffries and Munch talk with Krieger's cousin, P.K., he informs them he has not seen him since Labor Day. He tells them Krieger is always getting into trouble.

Stabler finds Krieger owes Shad's Cabaret $36, but he used his credit card. When the owner cannot tell him what Krieger bought, Stabler explains the drinks would tell him if he was drinking alone or with someone. The owner tells him the only information on the receipt is the date of January 11th.

Sarah walks into the line-up and is introduced to everyone. Cragen explains the men will not be able to see her. Munch adds if she does not recognize anyone she needs to make sure before saying so. At her request, Cragen asks the men to roll up their sleeves and turn their wrists out. When all of them have the tattoo, she gets a little confused, but points out number three.

As Munch escorts her from the line-up, he tells her the man's name is Mark Krieger and he is a welder from Queens. After he tells her they interrogated Krieger but he did not talk, she asks him if they can make a deal with him to give up the other rapist. He reminds her his lawyer will not let them talk to him. When she tells him she wants to know why the chose her, he tells her rapists give excuses they hear on television and in movies to judges and journalists after they are convicted. The truth is she will never know why they chose her and they may never catch the second guy.

Cragen informs the team he has received three calls in two days from One Police Plaza inquiring as to where they are on Sarah's case. Munch informs him they have DNA, a witness placing him in the neighborhood, and Sarah. Cragen reminds them they still do not have the second guy and it has been almost a month. Stabler informs him they have checked employers, landlords, and every bar he ever stole an ashtray at and got nothing. Benson informs him Krieger did not keep friends any longer than he needed them. When Cragen asks if they have any long shots, Stabler tells him he received a call from an informant in Rikers saying he heard something from someone.

At Rikers, Stabler tells his informant he was able to get his daughter's teacher to cut her some slack and do summer school and he has the principal looking out for her. His informant tells him Krieger is scared he is going down on this one, but he did not know who Sarah was when he did it. When asked about the second guy, the only thing he knows is the guy was already in Rikers on a DUI charge or something like that. When Krieger found him he told him to keep quiet or he will kill him. Stabler asks a jail administrator for a list of everyone in the day Krieger came in. She tells him that would be 16,000 names. He asks her to rule out women and children and narrows it to 12,000 men. When she asks him what he actually needs, he tells her he needs everyone who came into contact with Krieger narrowing it to 6,204 possibilities. After he is denied his request to narrow it down by age and race, she hands him a disk.

ADA Alden explains to Munch that Defense Attorney Sorenson will try to rush the case to trial in order to catch them unprepared. When Munch tells her they are ready, she reminds him Sarah says she was raped by two men, but they will only be able to show the jury one. Sarah took an unusual route home so he will try to say it was more than a leisurely walk home. She reminds him they do not have semen, but he reminds her a condom was used. She does not believe Sarah is ready so she suggests he ask for Benson's help in prepping Sarah.

Benson tells Sarah the defense cannot bring up her sexual history on the stand, but they may be able to allude to it. She informs her the defense does not have to prove it did not happen as long as they can muddy the waters a little. Munch tells her they will try to beat her up on the stand. They explain she will have to be detailed explaining where each person was, each body part, and explain how she could tell which guy it was. Benson tells her to answer with simple and direct answers. She tells her to use the actual names for body parts and if they make her uncomfortable talk to her or Munch until she is comfortable.

In court, the defense files 4 motions, including one to exclude the witness identification, and the prosecution files one to exclude press from the courtroom. The judge states he will rule in the morning. In the hallway, Sarah questions why they are trying to exclude her identification. ADA Alden explains their only hope is to try to convince the judge and jury that everyone from the police to the witness is incompetent. Sarah responds by asking Munch to come on her show stating it has already been cleared with Cragen. Munch tries to talk his way out of it saying a woman is who she needs to have if the subject is rape. She tells him that if her audience sees him, they will be more likely to go to the police. After she bribes him with dinner after the show, he reminds her not to say the word ""bribe"" to a cop in a crowded courthouse.

While Munch is waiting at the studio for Sarah, he is told there is some gridlock by her neighborhood. When he receives a call, he leaves to go to her apartment. When he arrives, a firefighter tries to stop him from going in citing the building is not safe. When he makes his way past the firefighter, Benson stops him letting him know it was Sarah. She tells him the neighbors heard a single blast. The bomb squad got the call at 6:46 and arrived at 6:52. She informs him the six minutes would not have mattered. When Munch gets to her apartment, he is told it was a black powder bomb in a box of flowers. She saw the flowers at her door and brought them in. When she opened them, she blocked the blast from the north side of the room with her body killing her instantly.

When Munch arrives at work, he tells Jefferies he stayed at the scene late and Benson is still there canvassing. Cragen slowly makes his way to his three remaining detectives and asks for an update. Stabler informs them his source told him the second guy was in Rikers when they got Krieger. He narrowed the field of possibilities by age and description before narrowing it further to those who were out when the rape occurred leaving 207 men. When Munch clarifies they are going on the assumption the second guy is the bomber, he then reminds them Sarah's testimony is out unless they suggest Krieger masterminded the bombing. Stabler adds Krieger could not mastermind a church picnic. Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to work on the rape, and tells Stabler to work on the bombing with Benson and only share information with Munch about Krieger. Cragen requests Munch's presence in his office to see if he needs time off which he declines.

Benson and Stabler are informed the bomb was made from a soup can, Chinese black powder, and a flammable liquid held together with masking tape wired to a remote. Benson explains the guy used a bomb instead of a gun, put it in a romantic box of flowers, and used a remote instead of a switch. Stabler picks up on where she is going realizing the guy had her life in his hands. When he asks if the park across the street from her apartment was searched, he is told they did not know to look there. He suggests the guy wanted to watch her die.

While looking at the park, Stabler picks up a wrapper from a pile of throat lozenge wrappers thinking the guy may have had a cold. Benson notes the guy would have been able to see right into her apartment. The guy had to buy the supplies, make the bomb, deliver it, and kill her. They realize the perps each have their own motive and MO. One is a planner and Krieger joins in at the last minute. They realize Krieger went along just for the ride.

In court, Sorenson asks the judge to quash the indictment since Sarah is dead. ADA Alden asks they allow her journals and statements to the police in under Geraci. The judge tells her they have seven days to link Krieger to the bombing or the indictment will be quashed. After Sorenson asks for his client to let out so he can help with his defense, the judge sets bail at $50,000. Munch expresses his disdain for the decision and is fined for contempt. He only stops when the judge threatens to put him in lock-up with the next word. Jefferies ushers Munch out of the courtroom citing a call she received from Krieger's cousin.

P.K. tells Munch and Jefferies he remembers a friend of Krieger's from selling pot named Tommy. He adds his last name is something Irish. When he asks if he will get the reward, Munch throws some money at him telling him to go buy himself a blunt.

After locating 18 men fitting their requirements, Munch and Jefferies try Shad's Cabaret to see if he was there drinking with Krieger. After seeing a picture of Krieger and a photo array, the owner picks out Tommy McConagh

While Jeffries acts like she is trying to pump gas unsuccessfully, Munch approaches the window complaining his wife cannot get gas and he has to be at work. When McConagh heads for the door, Benson, Stabler, and Munch meet him there with guns out to arrest him.

Stabler explains to McConagh in the interrogation room that he knows about the pot bust, but does not care about that. He reminds him he was in jail for a week when Krieger approaches him and tells him not to talk about the night they went partying at Shad's. He informs him that he will be the one going down for murder since Krieger is pinning it all on him unless he tells his story. McConagh tells him they were high and he dares Krieger to pick the lock to the swimming pool. Krieger tells him it would be a good lace to do a girl. He attacks Sarah, but he did not watch. Stabler remind him he is Irish and was raised to respect women. McConagh admits to watching the rape. In the viewing room, Jeffries comments that Krieger's bail has been revoked. Munch tells her ""Let's go.""

At Krieger's apartment, Krieger takes off running when he hears Munch and Jefferies. Krieger gets into a van and just before Jefferies gets to him, the van explodes knocking her down. Munch moves Jefferies to safety telling her he will call Cragen.

Munch, Benson, and Stabler are told the bomb was the same as the one in Sarah's apartment. After they are told the guy could have been 50 feet away, they check on Jeffries. When Munch asks her to take a few days, she agrees.

Stabler informs the team that the canvas is coming up empty. They discuss it may be a case where the guy thought he had a relationship with her and did not believe she should be talking about her rape on television. Cragen tells them to look through her correspondence after her story aired. Stabler tells Cragen McConagh flipped on Krieger, but admitted nothing himself. After reminding him McConagh does not know Krieger died, Cragen decides to play the disappointed father figure.

After Cragen tells McConagh he knows he lied to Stabler, he asks what happened that night. McConagh tells him he held Sarah down while Krieger raped her. She asked them not to hurt her. He admits he raped her next using a condom. When she is still crying her asks her what more does she want since he used the condom.

While they are searching Sarah's mail, Munch brings up the powder used in making the bombs. Benson realizes they can test for the powder residue so they all drop the mail and take it to the lab. They find a card in a red envelope. After Munch notices they did not sign it, they spray for fingerprints.

After running the prints through the criminal databases and city employees, they come up empty. Cragen tells them to run the prints through the weeds of prospective employees. They come up with Wlliam Lexner. He graduated from Queens College in 1984 and was rejected from the Fire Department six times with the most recent time being in '99. Munch reads from the psych report that he is narcissistic and thinks he has enemies preventing him from being hired by the Fire Department. Cragen tells them he wants to try to take him without incident, but plans to take the bomb squad as a precaution.

After evacuating the rest of the building, Munch and Stabler are asked if they want suits. When Munch tells him he is wearing one, they are told bomb suits only make them better looking corpses making Stabler more nervous. Stabler knocks on the door claiming to have a certified check for him saying he needs a signature and it will take 6 to 8 weeks for re-delivery. Stabler then pretends to leave, tricking Lexner into opening the door. Munch pulls his gun while Stabler overpowers him.

Cragen tells Munch they will not be able to make the case on forensics alone. They need a confession. When Munch introduces himself to Lexner, he recognizes him as the cop who handled Sarah's case. Munch tells him he is more interesting than the rape cases he handles every day. Lexner tells him rape is the worst crime of all because guys will be with the women who have not been raped before the ones who have. Munch tells him it should not matter if you care. Munch concludes Lexner saw Sarah differently after the rape. He confirms this stating she never smiled the same. Munch tells him she was a good woman who did good deeds. Lexner asks what she was like, noting Sarah mentioned Munch twice saying they clicked. Lexner tells him he wanted Sarah to be happy like she once was. He ordered the flowers she would have wanted and wrapped the box in a gold ribbon like she would have wanted and left it in front of her building. He was in the park and watched the 5:00 news. He watched her take the box to her apartment and watched for her smile before he flipped the switch."

The pedophalic pictures belong to Larry Holt, a piano insturctor who lives in the area. An investigation starts that leads to the discovery that Holt has been abusing children sexually during his piano lessons, and has been secretly video-taping the lessons for the past thirteen years. A little boy is shown on several of the tapes as he progresses in age. It is discovered that the boy is named Evan. He initially denies any abuse, until he is shown his video tapes. After a breakdown, he refuses to testify against his piano teacher citing him as a good man who did many positive things for him. As he comes to terms with the importance of his role in the case, he agrees to testify. Upon a review of the tapes, however, we come to find that Evan has also abused children while giving them piano lessons. Evan goes on to testify against Mr. Holt and provides damning testimony. Holt is sentenced to 115 years in prison; the maximum sentence. After the father of Evan's victim threatens to get the media involved in the case, the detectives try to find a way around a maximum sentence. Evan says that he is not like Mr. Holt and accepts his maximum jail term."

He brings a note for help to the squad, which leads the detectives to the written address, whose resident claims she does not know the source of the plea.

The detectives have just begun to track Ilena when her aunt is found dead beside the highway, having been killed less than an hour after she had been visited by Stabler and Benson. Urged on by a sense of dread, they locate Ilena, who denies anything is wrong. She is working as a live-in maid to a yuppie wealthy couple. However, dissonance is felt when they interview the husband and he vocally abuses his assistant in front of them and tries to demand where Benson should sit.

They finally are able to tie the wife to the death of the aunt, and her fear and servility to her husband leads them to pounce harder on him. However, missing is the young Romanian Ilena. A desperate house search locates the girl, but the stunning manner in which she is hid must be seen.

A secondary thread is that One Police center has ordered the squad to participate in an experimental series of psych evaluations. We see each of the characters answer one or two questions, with Munch getting the longest screen time here.

At the end, the psychologist informs Cragen that one of the officers must be terminated "" immediately."" Identification is kept from us by the final fade-out."

Fiona and Steve are in the new house with a baby monitor to communicate back to the house with all the other kids.

Next morning, Monica is trying to fill in as Fiona. She can't seem to handle the struggle of all the motherly details. Roberta is just barking orders from the table. Fiona is listening to the racket from the window in the next door house and gets irate about how poor of a mother Monica is/was. Steve gives Fiona a cell phone and money for her to go out and buy them a couch.

Roberta tells the kids she and Monica won't be there when they get home from school. Lip stays behind to confront Monica and Roberta about the DNA test. He says there is no way that they're taking Liam and starts to get into it with Roberta. He storms out after Monica stops the confrontation and she runs after him, begging forgiveness. He doesn't fall for her tears (thankfully).

Karen has agreed to go to the Purity Ball so her dad will give her the car. Frank and Shiela argue about Monica. She's jealous and he's....well, he's Frank. He leaves and there's a car following him down the street.

Roberta and Monica are talking in the kitchen between themselves about leaving the next day. Monica is saying how she wants to stay though and finally be a mom. Roberta talks ""sense"" into her and convinces her that leaving after the DNA results come back is the right thing to do. Frank comes in....Roberta tells him he gets no money unless he convinces the kids to get on board with them taking Liam. They threaten him with claiming spousal support, etc...He goes next door to break into Steve and Fiona's house.

V and Fi move a couch into the house and find Frank having broken in, drinking in her kitchen. He screams at her telling her the kids are none of her business - basically he's just interested in the money. He leaves; goes down to Alibi (the bar).

Fiona and V are looking up attorneys dealing with children's rights or adoption, etc. Lip and Ian are sitting in a car watching movement of Roberta and Monica, chatting. Ian explains to Lip that Mickey is gay and they're fooling around on the DL, Cash's wife found out about Ian and Cash and forced him to knock her up again and Mickey is in juve rather than admit he's gay.

DNA results show that Frank is Liam's father....hence, Nana Gallagher had an affair and the genes are actually Frank's to pass on and Monica is still his mother. But Roberta is on a rampage and says they're still gonna get Frank to sign over his parental rights and they leave.

Frank starts messing with the guy in the car who's following him and recording him. Its someone from the insurance company and they're trying to catch him from lying and getting more money from them. He's sitting at home when Carl comes in having hurt himself from a bike trick gone wrong. Frank gets an insurance scam idea and finally is interested in Carl's situation.

Lip and Ian take DNA swabs of their own, hoping to find they aren't Frank's kids.

Frank and Carl stage an accident to make it look like the insurance follower hits Carl on his bike. He actually does and Carl smiles real big knowing he's got another scam going.

Karen is home getting ready for the Purity Ball and Shiela invites Karen's dad to stay for dinner before they leave. Frank is at home with his ""wife"". They take come pictures after and Karen actually looks happy and interested.

Ian goes to juve to talk with Mickey through the glass. Steve gets pulled by Tony the cop. Awkward moment....Tony congratulates Steve on the new house. Steve tries to make small talk. Tony sends a message, basically, to take care of Fiona or else.

Fiona, Lip and Debs confront Frank at Alibi and tell him not to sign anything from Monica regarding his parental rights. Lip punches him and they leave.

At the Purity Ball, girls are confessing their ""sins of the flesh"" in round robin fashion. Also in round robin fashion, all the kids are sitting back at the family home passing a doobie and contemplating the benefits of not actually being Frank's kids. Back at the Purity Ball, its Karen's turn to share her sins and she goes into so much detail or guy and girl ""interaction"" that her father stands up and calls her a whore!!

Lip and Ian's DNA results come back....and good news for Ian - not Franks. Frank is only a bit concerned that Ian isn't his, but its likely that Ian is the child of one of Frank's brothers. Of course, with Monica. A family argument ensues with a bunch of semantics about who left who versus who drove who out, etc etc. Fiona aptly ends the discussion by telling her to get the heck out of dodge - with Bob, without Liam.

Karen comes crying and screaming back home and goes to the cellar to bash in her father's things. Shiela tells him to get out and pushes him outside.....yeah...she goes outside. Where Frank sees her and tells her she's out of the house. She freaks out in a good way and starts waving at the train going by.

The kids are all at Steve's place watching the family house. They see Monica and Bob come out to leave and Monica is carrying Liam. She walks over to the kids and starts to cry. She kisses Liam and hands him to Fiona before retreating to leave for one last time with Roberta. Once again, Fiona is back in charge."

Her panic mounts, and she hastily scribbles the words, ""call the nurse"" on the whiteboard before collapsing in a grand mal seizure. A month later Wilson introduces the teacher's case to close friend House. House is worried people will think he's a patient because of his limp. When Wilson suggests he wear a lab coat, House tells him he's afraid people will think he is a doctor. House thinks that the patient has a brain tumor, but Wilson asks him to take the case because she's his cousin. Wilson doesn't think its cancer because she isn't improving with radiation therapy. Wilson reminds him that House has three overqualified doctors working for him that would love to work on the case. House meets with his team and reminds them that ""everybody lies"". New hire Foreman is wondering why House isn't with the patient, but Cameron tells him that House doesn't like meeting patients. At this point, House has stopped thinking it's a tumor. Chase thinks it is a aneurysm or stroke. Cameron thinks it might be mad cow disease. Foreman thinks it might be an encephalopathy despite a negative blood test. House tells them all to proceed with the appropriate tests. Cuddy comes looking for House to berate him for not working hard enough, including being six years behind in clinic duty. He says he's going home - he can't be fired because he has tenure and is always at the hospital during his assigned work hours. Cuddy agrees that that he still has a good reputation but it will go to hell if he doesn't do his job. Cameron and Foreman start to do a test, but it's canceled on Cuddy's orders - she's taken away all of House's hospital privileges, the only thing she has the power to do to House without board approval. An enraged House confronts her but Cuddy is unconcerned with his threats. She tells him to go and do his job. He tells the team to do the MRI, then goes to do clinic duty. The team start the MRI but the patient starts to feel ill and then starts to have trouble breathing. They get her out of the MRI, but she isn't breathing because of pulmonary edema. Chase performs a tracheotomy and intubates her. He then compliments Cameron on realizing the patient was in distress so that they could get her out of the machine in time. They manage to stabilize the patient and get her conscious. She had an allergic reaction to the dye used in the contrast study. House tells the team to give the patient prednisone. He thinks she might have vasculitis even though it is extremely unlikely. However, the only way to test her is to give her the drugs and see if she responds. However, the patient realizes they aren't treating her for cancer, and is relieved she might not have a tumor. Chase is upset that they might be misleading the patient into thinking she doesn't have cancer. Foreman goes to the classroom to do an environmental scan. He finds a parrot and thinks it might be Psittacosis. However, House dismisses it because the none of the kids are sick and it is less likely they would take hygiene precautions. House tells him to break into the patient's apartment to do another environmental scan. Foreman is resistant, but House knows that Foreman served time for breaking and entering as a juvenile. He says that's why he hired Foreman. Foreman reminds House he can't be fired for refusing to break into someone's home. Cuddy asks House why he is giving the patient steroids. She comes to the conclusion that House is guessing and she wants to stop the treatment. They start to argue about who is in charge. She reminds House he has no evidence that the patient has vasculitis. He asks her why she's so afraid of making mistakes. Cuddy goes to see the patient and stop the steroids, but when she arrives she finds that the patient has improved greatly and has an appetite. Cuddy realizes she may have been wrong. Wilson examines the patient, who really wants to meet Dr. House. She asks if he's a good man. Wilson says House is a good doctor. He does admit that House is his friend, and that House may even care about him. All of a sudden, the patient complains that she can't see, then has a seizure. Her heart rate skyrockets and she goes into cardiac arrest. They defibrillate the patient and test her for brain damage by having her arrange pictures to form the elements of a story, but she can't manage it. However, she passes the test five minutes later. They realize that although her sight has returned, her brain is dying. House tells them to stop all treatment. It isn't a tumor and the steroids helped, but they don't know why. House admits he is stumped. Foreman decides to follow House's orders to break into the patient's house and asks Cameron to come along because the police are usually easier to deal with when a pretty white girl is around. Foreman and Cameron search the patient's home. Foreman is discussing his former criminal record. Cameron says she was 17 before she had a criminal record. Foreman fixes himself a sandwich and says he's a bit upset he got the job because of his criminal record and not his perfect academic record at both Columbia University and Johns Hopkins Medical School. Cameron says she didn't do nearly as well as Foreman in school and starts wondering how she got the job. They report to House that they couldn't find anything to explain her symptoms, but Foreman reports that she isn't Wilson's cousin - she had ham and Wilson is Jewish. Wilson bluffs, but then gets the patient's name wrong. House calls Foreman an idiot - House has realized that has a tapeworm from eating pork, something that would never have occured to him if he still believed the patient was Jewish. That would explain why she reacted well to the steroids initially, but then got worse. Tapeworms usually stay in the digestive system, but the eggs can pass into the bloodstream and into the brain. However, the steroids started to kill the worm and now it's death is stirring up the patient's immune system. There is no way to test for it except by trying to treat it. However, the patient is tired of being treated and wants to go home and die. House goes to see the patient and calls her an idiot for refusing treatment. She reminds him that his previous diagnosis was wrong. She asks why he's crippled and he explains that he had an infarction in his thigh and they didn't figure out what was wrong until it was too late to treat it. She thinks he avoids patients because he doesn't want people to see him crippled. He tells her there is no way to die with dignity - everyone dies and it's always ugly. You can only live with dignity. However, the patient still refuses treatment. The team wants House to claim she's mentally incompetent but he won't do it. He's solved the case and he feels the work is done. The patient wanted proof, but House can't do that. Chase says there might be a way to prove it to her - do an x-ray in her leg where there is likely to be a worm. House enthusiastically agrees. They do the x-ray and find a worm larva. She agrees to the drug to treat it and is surprised that it only takes two pills a day for a month. There are side effects, but they are manageable. Cameron asks House why he hired her. He asks her why she thought he did it. He says he hired Foreman because of his criminal record, Chase because his dad called, and Cameron because she was extremely pretty. When she is shocked, he says he did it because she worked hard despite the fact she didn't have to.... gorgeous women usually opt for an easy life and they don't go to med school to work really hard unless they are damaged. At that moment, Cameron's pager goes off. They manage to bring the patient's class in to visit her despite the rule about ""family only"". House asks Wilson why he lied about the patient being his cousin. He says it got House to take the case. They talk about lying while watching a medical drama."

He tells her that if, in fact, he is next, she could be killed, too. As they hold hands, she points out that if her husband catches her with him, she WILL be dead. The waitress brings him a drink he didn't order, but he drinks it anyway, and immediately leaves the bar. He quickly becomes dizzy, his vision blurs, and he passes out. He awakens to find himself in a concrete cell, chained by the ankle. There is at least one dead body in the cell with him.

The investigation of the missing Marine begins at the bar, where Atlas' truck is still parked after several days. Tony flirts shamelessly with the waitress as they question her. Gibbs finds the Zippo lighter and cigarette Atlas dropped when he passed out. Gibbs becomes frustrated with DiNozzo's flirtation, but Tony redeems himself by providing information he got from the waitress: the woman Atlas was with was Carol Powers, a reporter for ""The Post."" Powers is questioned, but can't help much.

Kate finds that no one is missing from Atlas' Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, but a new CO checked into his command a month ago. CO Joe Sacco's file contains a letter of punishment for getting into a fight in 1992, as a first lieutenant, with a couple of enlisted men including Atlas. Meanwhile, Atlas remains in his damp cell, into which his kidnapper releases a swarm of bees. Abby discovers, based on analysis of the cigarette, that Atlas had ingested a combination of codeine and speed. The combination is illegal here, but available OTC in the Philippines and Okinawa. Major Sacco's last duty station was Okinawa, so the team is off to Quantico to interview him. Sacco indicates that he's not too surprised by Atlas' absence, and that he's had trouble with alcohol in the past. He says Atlas is a marginal Marine and he's not really missed. He explains that the 1992 incident was simply a couple of Marines getting drunk; Atlas had swung at him and Sacco overreacted.

As the team returns to headquarters with Gibbs driving like a crazy man, Abby calls and informs them that three Marines have gone missing from EOD units in the last eight years. They were all considered deserters, they all served with Atlas under Sacco, and they were all in the Philippines in 1992. Abby also finds that there is one remaining member of Sacco's EOD unit unaccounted for: Major Mark Cohen, who was given a Bad Conduct Discharge for assaulting his CO in 1999.

While Abby goes off to a party in her dog collar and black leather jacket, Tony and Kate remain at work, eventually falling asleep at their desks.

Atlas still hasn't seen his tormentor, but awakens to the slam of the cell door and finds a cross necklace on the floor. He picks it up and yells at the closed door, ""Oh my God, I didn't know!""

Tony convinces Gibbs to let him shadow Sacco, hoping he will lead him to Atlas. Abby reports that Cohen isn't a suspect, as he was found dead last year in a sewer system in Old Town Alexandria, chained to a wall. Abby doesn't like the idea of Tony tailing Sacco alone; she has a ""weird feeling"" about it. Kate thinks the feeling may be the results of the 18 Red Bulls Abby drank at the party the night before. Tony follows Sacco to the same bar from the opening scenes, and flirts with the waitress as he drinks a ginger ale.

When Kate and Gibbs look at the evidence recovered from the scene of Cohen's death, they find a cross necklace. Kate points out that Cohen was Jewish, but Sacco is Baptist. Tony follows Sacco out of the bar and calls Gibbs to check in as he starts to get the same blurry vision and dizziness Atlas experienced before he passed out. On the phone with Gibbs, Tony says he doesn't feel too well, and mumbles, ""I think I screwed up boss,"" right before he passes out. He awakens in the same cell as Atlas, who says, ""Welcome to hell."" Atlas' face is covered with huge bee stings. Tony tells Atlas not to worry, because of Rule 9: ""Those rules they teach you in the Marine Corps."" When Atlas asks, ""What rules?"" Tony responds, ""I always suspected Gibbs was making stuff up."" But as he pulls a knife hidden in his belt buckle, he tells Atlas that Rule 9 is: ""Never go anywhere without a knife."" As Tony is attempting to get their chains off, Atlas holds up the cross and says he needs to confess, that he deserves to be there. He says, ""It was an accident. He must have found out about it. We killed four girls...Sacco was in love with one of them."" The four were the four buddies' (Atlas' and the other three missing men's) girlfriends, one of whom left Sacco for Atlas. When the men left the Philippines, they tried to smuggle the young women back to the states in shipping containers. Lt. Sacco split the men up at the last minute and put them on different ships, and none of them was on the ship the girls were on. The girls only had enough food and water to last a few days, and died of starvation and dehydration in the shipping containers.

Gibbs finds Tony's cell phone where he dropped it. Back at headquarters, McGee arrives and asks where to set up shop. Ducky reports that Cohen had a high concentration of honeybee venom, but that he died of starvation over a period of weeks or months.

Abby and McGee work side by side in Abby's lab, sharing Abby's Caf-Pow. Abby discovers that the fingerprint she lifted matches one she lifted from Powers' credit card receipt, and they conclude that Powers was working with Sacco.

Sacco's car is found by Manassas PD at the entrance of a sewer system. Gibbs and Kate arrive and enter the system of tunnels as Tony and Atlas escape from the cell and try to find their way through the maze. Sacco is also looking for Atlas, yelling for him as he makes his way through the tunnels. He comes upon Tony and Atlas, and is surprised to find Tony. Sacco says he isn't going to shoot anybody, that they have to get Atlas out. He says he followed ""her"" here, and she's completely insane, and they have to get out before she finds them. Tony asks, ""Who?"" just as Sacco is shot from behind by the waitress from the bar...one of the girlfriends, who had actually survived and had been rescued from the container by Sacco. She said she had been the youngest, and the other girls gave her their food and water and died one by one; they were covered in bee stings and wearing cross necklaces. She said at first Sacco was good to her, but then he tried to control her. So for eight years, she's been hunting and killing the men who left her friends and her to die."

Gibbs asks Kate to profile 'the one you couldn't stab' and Kate tells him the reason she couldn't: he had kind eyes. Gibbs reminds her that eyes can lie. Then, he shows up again in DC - showing off to Kate at a stoplight, and then Kate jumps into a car driven by his conspirators, ordering them to follow him, and of course is then kidnapped by them. We learn that the terrorist's name is Ari, who was born to a Arab woman and a Mossad agent father. And it turns out the whole lab incident when Kate, Duckie and Gerald were hostages was Ari's ""initiation"" into Hamas. He then foils a potential terrorist action in the US involving Marine 1, the President, and Ariel Sharon. Gibbs doesn't care that he and Ari are (sort of) on the same side, he feels Ari crossed a line. FBI's Fornell tells Gibbs he needs to back off the pursuit of Ari so his cover won't be blown. Gibbs insists on meeting with Ari in a place of his choosing first: the morgue, where the body waiting for autopsy is the good-looking blonde who was leading DiNozzo on, and who was one of the terrorists. Gibbs shoots Ari, so his story will stand up better to Hamas and al-Qa'ida -- and to get a little back for Gerald. I think we'll see Ari again, and soon."
