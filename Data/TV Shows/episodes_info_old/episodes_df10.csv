Miles Dale'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Clary tells Jace and Magnus the Mortal Cup is hidden inside a Tarot Card; the card is in Luke's office.

Simon wakes up in bed next to Marueen. He has a vision of Clary and calls her name; Maureen is very upset and Simon spirits away.

Luke enters the police station but is confronted by an Internal Affairs employee before he can fetch the card. Jace and Clary see him escorted and decide to act. They enter while glamouring and LUke tells them where to find the card.

Isabel has broken up with Meliorn.

Clary starts a mock fight with Jace in Luke's office and pretends to have lost her key while Luke's boss (who is an acquaintance of Clary) tells her where to find the card. The boss walks off and is trailed by a Downworlder.

Simon watches vampire videos while siting at a food truck and eating a garlic bagel; he is scared of having become a vampire.

Luke is freed by his attorney while IA tells him he is a suspect. Luke then discovers his boss with a slit throat in a closet - but he could not have committed the murder since he was talking to the IA officer.

Alec sets up a diversion for Isabelle who cause a blackout in the building while Jace and Clary climb via an elevator shaft to the evidence room. Clary and Jace find the card but Clary is unable to fetch the Cup from the card at first. Outside the building the band of four is chased by werewolves while Isabelles demon-detecting pendant flashes. They re-enter the building via the cellar to find shelter and are attacked by shax-demons. Jace, Isabelle and Clary split up and Clary is attacked by shax-demons; she scares the demons away by pulling the Cup from the card. A shape-shifting demon tries to get the Cup from Clary and is vanquished by her.

Back in the institute all are reunited; Jace and Clary kiss passionately.

Simon re-enters the Hotel Dumort to find out more about his condition. Camille tells him the symptoms he is experiencing will fade and then bites him."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5134182/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,"Time is running out for the Shadowhunters to stop Valentine. Jace wrestles with his feelings, whilst Alec must deal with the aftermath of his choices.",[],TV-14,Release date,['J. Miles Dale'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Jace and Clary discuss their parentage. They then ask Simon to join them to the Hotel Dumort, where Camille (who owns the book) is locked up.

Alec and Magnus visit Lydia and find her unconscious. The good guys rewatch security camera footage and discover that Hodge took the Mortal Cup from Lydia. They also find out why a Forsaken invaded the Institute: he brought a ring to Hodge with which Hodge could communicate to Valentine Morgenstern.

Hodge Starkweather visits Valentine Morgenstern and hands him the Cup in exchange for his freedom. Using the Cup, Valentine purifies a tank of blood and hands a cupful of the resulting fluid to a waiting follower. The follower drinks, falls down but stands up and is handed his sword. Valentine now starts branding his army of new Shadowhunters with his double-circle mark.

Valentine chases Hodge away, who is now an outlaw.

Jace and Alec leave to hunt for Valentine; Luke sends out his werewolves to do the same. Jace find Hodge first and confronts him; Hodge blames the Lightwoord family for letting him take the blame and locking him up. In the resulting duel Jace cuts off Hodges hand but is stopped before he can kill Hodge. Jace then takes the ring of the severed hand, puts it on and talks to Valentine.

In the Hotel Dumort Raphael rebuffs the attempts of Isabelle, Simon and Clary to gain access to Camille. While Raphael shows Isabelle the belongings of Camille that he knows of, Simon sneaks Clary in a coffin to the basement and frees Camille. She knows the location of the book (her pied-a-terre in the Upper East side of Manhattan) but will only take them there if Simon signs a document exonerating Camille of killing Simon.

Luke and Alex talk briefly and then find both Jace and Hodge gone. Jace speaks to Alex on the phone and explains his situation with Valentine, his father.

Simon, Clary and Camille prepare to leave and are stopped by Raphael and his vampire followers. At the moment supreme Isabelle uses her whip to create a hole in the outside wall, which serves as a barrier between the vampires and the good guys.

One of Valentine's Shadowhunters posts outside of Camille's apartment and phones Valentine when Simon and the other good guys (including Marcus Bane) drive past. Simon signs the exonerating document and Camille confesses she doesn't know where Dot hid the book, then leaves. Jace calls Clary and tells her to leave immediately as Valentine is on his way Clary refuses and then finds the book, hidden in a cook book containing Clary's favourite recipe (Chicken Caccciatore). The cook book contains a torn bookmark which exactly matches the piece that Clary possesses. The completed bookmark breaks the hiding spell and Clary now has the White Book of Spells.

At exactly that moment Valentine and a few of his new Shadowhunters port in and a stand-off occurs. Clary offers the book to Valentine but he refuses it, telling her he wants her to wake up Jocelyn so that both can join him. He then leaves with Jace, who joins him voluntarily.

Back in the institute Magnus breaks the sleeping enchantment using a spell from the White spell-book.

The episode and the season) ends with Valentine holding the Mortal CUP while standing on a large freighter with several hundred new Shadowhunters on deck; next to him is Jace. Promising his followers a new world where the demons will be slain, they sail off into the night.

End-of-Season summary:

Clary is a powerful shadowhunter
Simon is a vampire
Luke is a werewolf
Jace has joined Valentine Morgenster, his father and mentor;

But what if you're not just a normal teenager? What if you're a teenage super hero? Are you ready to join the ranks of the great heroes and prove you're worthy of the Justice League? That's exactly what the members of Young Justice - Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, Superboy, Miss Martian and Artemis - will find out, whether they have what it takes to be a proven hero. This all-new series is produced by Warner Bros. Animation and based upon characters from DC Comics. Sam Register (Teen Titans, Ben 10, Batman: The Brave and the Bold) is the executive producer. Brandon Vietti (Batman: Under the Red Hood, Superman Doomsday, The Batman) and Greg Weisman (Gargoyles, The Spectacular Spider-Man, W.I.T.C.H.) are the producers.

Within the Justice League, its members' teen sidekicks push for full membership, but it's only after they successfully investigate Cadmus, in which they find and free its secret young clone of Superman, Kon-El (Nolan North), is the League convinced. In response, the League organizes the teenagers into an apprentice team to be both trained and act on behalf of the League at their own pace. Now these teen superheroes, soon strengthened by more members, must battle the forces of evil in their own way, even as the mysterious cabal known only as The Light has a sinister agenda of their own.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0547051/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Clair is upset when Theo brings home a bad report card and claims he has no plans to attend college; Cliff is horrified to meet Denise's date.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jay Sandrich'],"['', '', '']",[],"['doctor', 'family relationships', 'father']",[],"The Huxtable family has gathered around the breakfast table before the kids have to go to school and the parents have to go to work. Clair, the mother, is making eggs and serving cereal while the children dance around the kitchen and the table as the radio plays jazzy music. When the family's only boy, Theo, says that he wanted his eggs scrambled, his mother obliges by scrambling the sunny side-up eggs right on Theo's plate. The second-youngest child, Vanessa, asks her mother if they could get a dog (a recurring request of Vanessa's throughout the series' run), to which her brother replies ""We already HAVE a dog; YOU!"". Vanessa counters by mentioning that Theo's report card, which he will get that day, will likely have grades with the first letter of the word ""dog"". Clair tells Theo that she hopes his report card this term will be better than last term. Clair's husband, Cliff, comes downstairs to the kitchen and serves himself oatmeal in a silly manner before he leaves for work.

In a hospital delivery room, Cliff follows a would-be father out to the waiting room. The man has been scared off by his wife's attitude in during what appears to be a painful delivery -- the man says his wife had yelled at him to leave the room. Cliff comforts the father and tells him to buck up and to cheer for his wife as she goes through the birth. Cliff's words are very inspirational and the father enthusiastically returns to his wife's side.

That evening, while the family, minus Cliff, eat dinner, the children have the usual spate of arguments, bickering and minor physical altercations, especially when Theo won't stop teasing his youngest sister, Rudy. Clair reminds Theo that he's already in very hot water for bringing home a report card with D grades in every class. Clair orders Theo to his room to await his father's return from work and also orders Vanessa and Rudy to go upstairs and get ready for bed. As they all walk upstairs, Clair has to yell at them again to stop fighting.

Cliff arrives home, cheerful that the birth he was performing was a success. Clair immediately asks him in a cross tone why they had to have four children (a small error in the series, since it's revealed later that Clair and Cliff actually have five children). Clair hands Cliff Theo's report card and tells him to go upstairs and talk to their son about becoming a better student. When Cliff suggests he get something to eat first, Clair glares a bit and he tells her he'll ""be meaner on an empty stomach.""

Cliff enters Theo's room, which is a complete mess of strewn-about clothes and personal objects and talks to his son. Theo's attitude is one of indifference; Theo feels he doesn't need to do better in school or go to college. He tells Cliff he wants to get a job like ""regular people"", say driving a bus or working in a gas station. Cliff then demonstrates what life would be like for a person who earns the lower wages of a ""regular person"" using the money from Theo's nearby Monopoly set. Theo expects that he'll earn $250 per week; Cliff says he'll give him $300/week, $1200 per month. Theo is excited, until Cliff subtracts $350 for taxes, saying ""the government comes for the regular people FIRST."" Cliff tells Theo he'll have to find an apartment (emphasizing that he cannot live in his parents' home) and that one in Manhattan will cost $400/month in rent. Theo counters, saying he can live in New Jersey for $200. Cliff takes another $200 for a car; Theo takes back $100 saying he'll get a motorcycle. Cliff takes an additional $50 for a helmet. Cliff subtracts a further $100 for clothing, Theo gives him another $100 saying he wants to ""look good!"" Cliff takes $100 a month for food; Theo takes it back claiming he can ""get by on bologna and cereal"". When Theo cheerfully says he has everything he needs and $200 extra for the month, Cliff asks him if he plans to have a girlfriend and when Theo cheerfully says ""For sure!"", heartlessly takes Theo's last $200.

Cliff hears an argument out in the hall and finds Rudy and Vanessa have been kicked out of the bathroom by their older sister Denise, who needs to get ready for a date. Vanessa describes a desperate situation where shampoo from the shower has run into Rudy's eyes & may blind her. Cliff catches Denise as she comes out of the bathroom and objects to Denise's going out on a date and the outfit she's wearing. Denise tells Cliff that she'd gotten permission from her mother. Denise retreats to change her outfit and Cliff goes downstairs to talk to Clair.

When he asks Clair ""how ugly"" Denise's date is, the young man hears him and Cliff invites him to talk while they sit on the family couch. The young man has a fairly haughty attitude. Cliff notices that he has one ear pierced, a tradition the young man partook of when he was a merchant Marine & crossed the equator. When Cliff asks the guy if he's shipping out any time soon, the guy tells him that he's out of the merchant Marines and back in school -- TWO years behind Denise. He also tells Cliff that after being in a Turkish prison, ""everything else is easy."" Cliff is flustered a

In the kitchen, Cliff fills Clair in on his conversation with their son. When Cliff tells her that Theo's responded with a mere ""I'll try"" to Cliff economics lesson and his lecture about doing better in school, Clair isn't satisfied and tells Cliff to talk to Theo again.

Back upstairs, Cliff approves of Denise's new ensemble but questions her about her makeup and her date's personal history. Humored, Denise kisses him and goes off to meet her date. Cliff then remembers he has to finish his talk with Theo. His son gives a heartfelt response to Cliff's earlier lecture, saying that if his father wasn't a doctor & earned less, he would still love them. Theo believes that Cliff should accept Theo's belief that he was meant not to excel in school or go to college and that he can live like a regular person. Cliff considers this for a moment and then tells Theo, in a raised and angry voice that Theo's impassioned reply is ""the *dumbest thing [he's] ever heard in [his] life!"" He tells Theo unequivocally that he will try harder in school and will be successful. Cliff also tells him in a softer tone that he loves him very much and wants him to do the best he can. Theo agrees.

Down in the kitchen, Cliff gets something to eat and fills Clair in on what he told Theo. Clair is critical at first but then realizes that Cliff had properly lectured Theo on success in life starting in school.

Later that evening when Cliff and Clair get ready for bed, Cliff begins to get amorous with Clair, who reminds him that ""this is how we got the children in the first place."" Cliff still does but there's a knock at the door; it's Vanessa and Rudy. Following a brief lesson on proper etiquette for entering a room, Vanessa tells her parents that Rudy can't sleep because the Wolf-man is in their closet. Clair invites them to sleep with their parents that night and all four crowd into the bed. When Cliff turns out the light and says ""Goodnight, dear"" all three comically tell him the same."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0771683/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,Cliff forces the entire family to hold a funeral for Rudy's dead goldfish Lamont.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jay Sandrich'],"['', '', '']",[],"['doctor', 'family relationships', 'father']",[],"Cliff comes home from a long day at the hospital. He lies comfortably down on the living room couch for a nap but is soon wakened by Vanessa. She tells him there may be an emergency with her younger sister Rudy but is unable to convey just how serious the situation is. She tells her father that Rudy's goldfish, Lamont, is dead. At first Cliff merely says ""I'm sorry"" but Vanessa convinces him to go upstairs with her and talk to Rudy, whom doesn't understand that her fish is dead.

When they arrive, Rudy is blissfully sprinkling food into Lamont's bowl. Cliff investigates, first shaking the bowl slightly, poking the body with his finger and then flipping it in is hand. He sits down with Rudy and, with some ""help"" from Vanessa, tells her that Lamont is dead. Theo has also joined the conversation but is mildly admonished by his father when he insensitively confirms the news. Cliff tries to soften the blow for Rudy by suggesting she remember how much fun Lamont was. After Rudy and Theo go downstairs for dinner, Vanessa suggests that Cliff make her a special dinner to cheer her up.

At dinner, Rudy, now feeling the loss of her pet, doesn't want to eat. Claire tries to tell Rudy about the loophole she was able to crack in a legal case at her law firm but Rudy doesn't want to hear about it. Claire takes Rudy out of the kitchen to console her. Cliff seems slightly appalled at the lack of empathy from Theo, Denise & Vanessa. Denise tells him that it's just a dead fish and Theo jokingly says they should have a funeral. Cliff hits on the idea and takes things a few steps further, picking up the phone when Theo suggests they have their local reverend deliver a eulogy. The kids try to stop him and Cliff blackmails them all into attending the funeral on Saturday morning. He also coerces them into wearing black and doing whatever he orders. With the reverend still on the phone, Cliff covers up by asking if Christmas will still be at the same time that year. After he hangs up, he sticks his tongue out at his kids.

Later, in their bedroom, Cliff picks out one of Claire's dresses, a fancy dark blue one that's the closest she has to a black one. Having been rebuffed by most of the family about her great day at work, she refuses to tell Cliff about it at first but finally does when Cliff promises to give her his undivided attention. She begins to tell him but his pager goes off. He shuts off the alarm a couple of times but when a long beep is heard, he finally calls. One of his patients is on her way to the hospital. He then listens to Claire's story, which turns out to be rather pathetic.

On Saturday morning, Cliff calls everyone to the family bathroom, where the funeral will be held. The kids assemble: Claire is wearing her fancy dress, Vanessa wears a black leotard, Denise is in frumpy clothes she dressed in to meet up with friends, Theo is in a sharp blazer and Rudy is wearing a little sailor's dress, Lamont's favorite since it is nautically-themed. Theo brings Cliff the fish on his little net and they all gather around the toilet. Cliff begins to eulogize about Lamont with Vanessa kicking in a few unintentionally silly remarks. Rudy suddenly says she wants to watch television. Denise hears a car horn and leaves, saying her ride has arrived. Cliff is again appalled at the lack of sensitivity and starts yelling. Barely able to keep from laughing, Claire tries to calm him down, saying that the spectacle he's created is mostly ridiculous. She also reminds him that he never went to the hospital to check on his patient. When he goes to check his watch, the net holding Lamont tips and he falls into the toilet bowl. Cliff flushes the toilet. Moments later, Rudy reappears. Cliff asks if she wants to mourn a bit and she bashfully tells him she needs to use the bathroom. Smiling widely, she closes the door after her parents leave."

Theo has gotten something of a boost from the experience, having done the shopping in the store by himself and using his father's charge account while Claire waited outside. Theo is also excited about the shirt he bought; it's from a popular new designer named Gordon Gartrelle. Theo shows his father the shirt and points out some of it's finer features like the silk it's made from, the collar, hidden buttons and its front pocket. When Cliff asks how much the shirt cost, Theo evades the question with further admiration for the shirt. Cliff looks at the sales receipt and sees that it cost a steep $95. Cliff tells Theo he's going to return the shirt, prompting protest from his son. Cliff gives Theo a generous $30 for a different shirt but Theo is disappointed.

Up in his bedroom, Denise joins him and Theo tells her what happened. She reminds him that a $95 price tag is more for the brand than the actual value of the shirt and that the profit goes to paying for the designer's extravagant lifestyle. Theo tells her their father gave him $30 to buy a different shirt and Denise offers to make him a replica of the Gartrelle shirt for him. Thrilled, Theo gives her the money.

Denise finds that making a shirt is very difficult. When she asks her parents for more money to finish it, they give it to her. Cliff and Claire both realize that the situation will end in disaster because they know Denise's tailoring skills aren't up to the job. Meanwhile, Cliff is fighting off a severe cold that he tries to hide from Claire.

On the day she promised to give Theo the shirt, he explodes, complaining about how badly it's turned out: it's too big, the sleeves are uneven and of two different designs, the collar is crooked and it looks like it was assembled from a patchwork of fabric. Furious, Theo goes to his father in the kitchen and shows him the shirt. His father tries to stifle his laughter but tells Theo he's learned his lesson about expecting more than someone could promise him. Theo begs his father for the chance to go back to the store and get a new Gartrelle but his father, amidst Theo's panicky state, tells him he can find the original Gartrelle he'd bought in his father's room. When Theo asks him about it, Cliff laughingly tells him he never took the first one back knowing that something like this would happen.

Theo goes out the kitchen door to the living room and finds that his friends and his date have arrived. When they see in Denise's shirt they seem a bit shocked and Theo is very embarrassed. Cliff walks in and tries to cover for Theo, saying it's his shirt and that Theo can't wear it. Theo steps up and tells his date that it's his. His date is unexpectedly excited; to her it looks like another new, hot designer, Idgy Amorata. Theo is thrilled and confident, saying he'll go out anyway. When Claire tells him to put on a coat, Theo scoffs at the idea of covering up his new, stylish shirt. Claire then turns her attention to Cliff, who still refuses to admit he's sick."

He sneaks into the house and quickly runs up to his room. Asking Denise to join him, he shows her that he's gotten his left ear pierced, saying that he had Cockroach's sister Tilly do it in their garage. Theo boasts a bit about how he's a man now and free to make his own decisions. Denise is at first giddy about the piercing but notices that it may be infected; when she tries to touch the earring, Theo recoils in pain. Theo makes her promise not to tell their parents, wanting to reveal it to them later.

Worried about her brother, Denise talks to Cliff and Claire and drops hints about everyone's earlobes. Cliff goes up to Theo's room to investigate and finds Theo listening to his headphones. However, when he unplugs the headset, Theo at first is reluctant to take them off and only does when Cliff orders him to. Theo sits with his left ear facing away from his father. When his father tries to look at his ear, Theo cleverly maneuvers himself to avoid any notice but soon can't hide it from his father any longer. Cliff looks him over and determines that Theo's outer ear is infected. He says he'll treat his son's ear; when Theo asks if he can expect a punishment, Cliff eagerly says yes.

Down in Cliff's office, Cliff disinfects the wound and sits down with Theo to have a talk. When asked, Theo tells his father that he had the piercing done as a sign of independence. Cliff isn't fooled and asks what girl Theo is trying to impress. Cliff suddenly shifts gears and tells Theo he won't punish him but will subject him to a morality lecture from his grandfather, Russell, who's due to arrive for dinner in a few minutes. Theo is frightened but thinks that his grandfather won't notice. Cliff insures that he will by putting a large bandage over the wound.

When the grandparents arrive, Theo tries to give them a short greeting and sneak away. Before he can, his youngest sister Rudy notices the bandage, calling his grandfather's attention. Cliff eagerly tells his father what happened and leaves Theo to Russell's devices. Russell surprises his son and grandson by stating that he has no intention of lecturing Theo, especially since Cliff once tried a crazy idea when he was about his son's age to impress a girl. Russell tells Theo the story of how Cliff tried to straighten his hair by mixing up a tonic that used nitroglycerin to relax the curl. The solution burned Cliff's hair and scalp and left him temporarily bald. When Theo asks his father who he was trying to impress, Cliff tells him it was Claire. Overjoyed, Theo runs for the kitchen to share the story but Cliff stops him short. Theo agrees not to reveal Cliff's secret but then asks his grandfather to tell the story. Russell jogs Claire's memory, prompting her to tell everyone. Russell then tells Claire that Theo had his ear pierced but then bids Claire not to come down hard on Theo because he'd already talked to him and had taken the same tone with Cliff when he was younger and acted just like his son.

Everyone gets a good laugh over the conversation but Cliff's mother Anna chimes in saying that Russell was not so understanding or patient in dealing with Cliff. She mentions a tattoo that Russell had gotten when he was a teenager. Russell had wanted to get Anna's name tattooed on his chest to impress her but when he went to the tattoo parlor he had a severe cold and mispronounced Anna's name, saying ""Adda"", the name of another girl from their neighborhood who was also attracted to Russell. When the tattoo came back misspelled, Russell had it removed, leaving a large scar on his chest. Cliff suddenly remembers how his father told him he'd gotten the scar during combat in World War II, a story Russell had made up to avoid embarrassment. The ladies leave the men behind in the living room, Denise telling them they're all crazy. After they leave, Cliff gives them all nicknames: Skinhead for himself, Scar Chest for his father and Hole-in-the-Lobe for Theo."

Believe in others, and most importantly, believe in yourself. There will always be obstacles in your ways, but if you want that goal, you have to get through those obstacles.

Grandpa's Greasy Soul Food stands in as a substitute for narcotics strong enough to induce a stupor ""the itis"" when consumed and feelings of withdrawal identical to those experienced by hardcore street addicts in need of a fix. Wunsler's sudden interest in funding Grandpa's ""lifelong"" dream (scripted joke-three weeks since seeing a TV cooking show) is fully exposed in the fade to end scene when he smiles at the sight of the urban blight he knew he would create by funding Grandpa's dispersion of the Soul Food (drugs). Huey plays the usual part of morally outraged kid while his greedy brother smiles broadly at the spoils. The full genius of Wunsler's premeditated evil is saved for the final reveal where (IIRC) a voice-over fills in the details of his genius success in the fine art of forced real estate acquisition at bargain basement prices while panning the rundown wreckage of a formerly vibrant community."

He comes to a painting and stares at it.

Three Days Earlier

Sophie Devereux wakes up in her bed alone She looks at the empty side of the bed next to her, and she gets a text on her phone saying they'll meet her there. She goes down to breakfast and considers saying she can't make it, but reconsiders. Sophie gets a text from Parker saying she misses Sophie, and Sophie huddles on the bed.

At her late husband Nate Ford's gravesite, Sophie kneels by the stone and places flowers. Her former teammate Eliot Spencer joins her, and then Alec Hardison and Parker. The four of them go to Sophie's house and talk about Leverage International and the twelve teams they've formed, and toast Nate who is one year gone. Parker mentions Eliot's food trucks, Hardison talks about how he's using satellites to coordinate refugee efforts. Sophie finally tells them to stop and walks away. Parker goes over and tells Sophie that they should steal something to distract Sophie from her grief, and the others agree. They take Sophie to the nearby Boston Museum of Art and go in past protesters protesting Maxwell's family. The others go off to check the place.

Sophie overhears Maxwell arguing with the curator about how the issues with his family have nothing to do with his art. Maxwell threatens to pull his Rembrandt from the show, and calls in his lawyer Harry. Maxwell tells Harry to fix the situation, and Harry says that they can cancel Maxwell's next donation. The curator says that they don't want Maxwell's money, and Maxwell threatens to call the museum board and walks off. Sophie goes over to Harry and points out that Maxwell isn't that likable, and Harry explains that the Maxwell family has donated millions to the museum, and Maxwell is a collector.

Sophie follows Harry to a gallery where he's looking at the piece Maxwell donated, and says that it was formerly stolen. She knows all about the theft, and admits that she stole it. Sophie figures that the cameras are cut, and Parker and Hardison join her and say they already know. The alarms go off and Harry directs everyone out, and he stays behind as the security gates come down. Once he's alone, he cuts a painting down and finds Sophie watching him. She points out that he has two-minute window to steal the Rembrandt and should carry on. Parker comes up, steals Harry's wallet, and checks his ID. Hardison runs a background check on Harry, and Harry works for bad people.

Parker and Hardison go to wipe the camera while Sophie admires Harry's work. He explains that he learned his technique from Youtube, and she works out that he has access to a hidden employee door. Harry accidentally sets off a hidden alarm on the painting, and Sophie tells Harry to leave the painting and they have to go. Harry goes through the door, and Eliot is on the other side and punches Harry unconscious. Sophie tells the others that Harry is the distraction, and Eliot has to carry Harry out on his own. Back at the house, Harry wakes up and finds the team staring down at him.

Six Months Earlier

Harry is with Maxwell and Bligh, and says thy can protect $100 million and get the rest in settlements. Maxwell refuses to settle, saying it's not his family's fault ""addicts"" took advantage of the medication his family produced as part of their pharmaceutical business. Harry pints out all the evidence against Maxwell for making the drug deliberately addictive, and if Maxwell agrees then Harry will convince each of the litigants to settle. Maxwell finally agrees to employ Harry, who insists he's not on anybody's side.

Later, Harry goes to the trailer home of one of the litigants, Cole Hoskins, who prepares to attack Harry with a shovel until his sister Jenny tells Cole to go inside. She says that she has power of attorney, and is tempted to beat Harry herself. Harry says that the company wants to settle, and Jenny explains that they had to sell their grandparents' house the second out of three times Coles was in rehab because of the medication. Harry convinces all of the litigants to settle and goes back to Maxwell, and Maxwell tells Harry that they're not settling. He figures the litigants will die in the years the cases will take, and he has plenty of money. Harry is shocked at Maxwell's plan, and Maxwell assures Harry that he couldn't have done it without him.

The Present

Harry tells the team his story, and Sophie figures he felt guilty. He explains that he locked up all of Maxwell's money in the Bank of Malta, with airtight security. Harry also wanted to hurt Maxwell, taking his painting in eight museums across the country, rather than his money, but Eliot figures that it's about Maxwell's reputation, not the art. Sophie figures Maxwell is afraid of his legitimacy being taken away from him. She insists that she's retired and they're not going to help Harry, and the others point out that Sophie was the one who spotted Harry, and had them bring him there.

Harry figures he can trust them, and Sophie figures that Maxwell is looking for a big score to eliminate all the scandal associated with him. She figures they can hook Maxwell with a lost Rembrandt, and review Nate's all files. He was checking a case about a team of thieves who stole 13 paintings from a museum, including a Rembrandt. Anybody who found and returned one of the paintings would be a hero. If someone returned a fake of one of the paintings, their reputation in the arty world would be ruined. Hardison points out that Sophie already has a plan, and she agrees to do the one job and they'll need Harry as an inside man. She says ""Let's go steal..."" in honor of Nate.

Later, Sophie and Parker go into the museum and find Maxwell making a call about his name being taken out of the brochure. Parker fakes being on the phone to someone, and says that she's an expert on Monet's collection. Maxwell overhears her and picks up the Invigtation-0only invitation she's ""accidentally"" dropped.

In the house's garage, Hardison sets up his 3d printer and the program he uses to make forgeries. They check Nate's collection of stolen master piece to find the right date for the canvas, and Eliot and Hardison go in an auction house and convince the staff a steam pipe is going to burst, so they should all leave. Once they leave, the team and their people set up their own auction with Parker as the auctioneer. Maxwell comes in and takes a seat, and Maxwell ""wins"". Parker tells Maxwell that she can't sell the item to him because his name has been flagged, because the seller doesn't want his piece seized in a future lawsuit.

Eliot is listening, steps in, and says that Maxwell is known as a drug dealer, and steps in to take the item. Maxwell goes to make call and tells his people to find whoever flagged him Sophie and Eliot stage a conversation where Eliot threatens to send Sophie back to her humble beginning if she doesn't get high-ticket items like he wants. Maxwell overhears them, and Eliot walks off. As planned, Maxwell approaches Sophie and she plays being upset, and he invites her to his place later for a proposal. Sophie agrees, and she walks over to a watching Parker and Eliot and tells them that it was exhilarating. Meanwhile, Maxwell has his people do a full security check on Sophie.

Later at Maxwell's place, Maxwell has dinner with Sophie. He says that he had someone check up on Sophie, and Harry comes in and says that after running the background check, he can confirm that Sophie is legitimate, but her ""boss"", Eliot, is the son of a mobster and apparently buying art at random. When Sophie starts to go, Maxwell asks her to oversee his Monet collection. Sophie agrees, and tells Maxwell that Eliot is flipping art to cover his drug money, and his father stole the Rembrandt along with the other twelve pieces of art. Maxwell asks Sophie to help him screw Eliot.

Later, Eliot ""procures"" a failing trucking company. He tells Sophie that he figures that as the son of a Boston gangster, she wrote the part with Nate in mind. Eliot offers to talk with her about her loss, and Sophie says that it is her way of talking about it. Sophie talks to Harry privately and says that Nate burned with anger and loss, but at least he burned.

Maxwell comes to the company and approached Eliot, and says that he wants to buy the Rembrandt. He says that he has Harry working with the IRS so Eliot can never sell the painting, and he'll pay Eliot $25 million for the $40 million painting, and then give it back once it's authenticated.

Later, the team brings the fake painting to the company in one of Eliot's food trucks. Eliot takes it in, while Hardison shows Sophie how the truck is now a ""miniature Lucille"" that has computer equipment for Leverage International. Meanwhile, Maxwell calls and cancels his meeting with Harry, with Eliot. Eliot arrives and finds four of Maxwell's security thugs waiting for him, along with Bligh, a woman who provides security for Maxwell. Blight recognizes Eliot for who he really is, and says the audition is for the thugs. Eliot smugly describes how they'll attack him, and how he'll defeat them. She figures he's doing so to get them to second-guess themselves, and Eliot smiles and then defeats them and walks off.

In the truck, Harrys suggests they offer up another painting. Sophie advises against it, warning that the con is blown. Hardison checks Blight's security company, Quality Protection, and confirms they have offices all over, and they tend to work for bad people and are more like a private army. He suggests they should run, but Sophie refuses to abandon her ""home"" where Nate lived. Eliot barges in and grabs Harry, grabbing him and figuring that Harry betrayed them. Harry insists that he didn't and that working with the team in insane. He says that he wanted to make amends and tried to track down everyone he and Maxwell hurt.

The Past

Harry goes to Cole's house and finds it's been posted for foreclosure. A neighbor tells him that Jenny left, and that Cole OD'd and hospital bills took what was left of Jenny's money.

Tre Present

Harry says that if he can't be forgiven, he's trying to take something from people like Maxwell.

Later, Harry goes back to the museum and breaks in as the alarms go off. He burns the Rembrandt and laughs in triumph.

The next day, Maxwell calls Harry into his home. One of Maxwell's bodyguards immediately beats Harry, and Maxwell finishes his call to his insurance company having his funds transferred and giving his account routing number and password. Maxwell finishes his call, and tells Harry that it's for the Rembrandt Harry burned. When Harry denies burning the painting, the bodyguard beats him again. His employer points out that there's no evidence but he's left with Harry, and the bodyguard points a gun at Harry's head. Maxwell says that he can easily make it look like Harry threatened him, then gets a call from museum wanting to apologize to him for their bad security. He tells Harry that he's called his firm and had Harry fired, and goes to the museum.

The insurance agent, Connie Lieu, is at the museum with the curator. Maxwell comes in, and they ask him why he hired someone to burn a fake Rembrandt. Harry had Hardison make the fake, and Parker broke in and swapped the real one for the fake. Maxwell says that it's a mistake, but they figure he sold the real painting and torched the fake to collect the insurance. The curator has called the other museum displaying Maxwell's painting, and confirmed they're all fakes, since Parker broke into the other eight museums and put in fakes. Maxwell storms out and calls his insurance company, and discovers the person he called earlier to give his passwords was a fake.

The team pulls up in a car, and Harry tells Maxwell that he stole the passwords when he was in Maxwell's house earlier. Later at Sophie's house, Harry says that gloating was fun. Hardison tells Harry that they sold the painting and are sending the money to the people Maxwell hurt, but they couldn't find everyone. He tells Harry that the lawyer has a long way to go to fully redeeming himself, and he has many things to do to pay penance. Conning Maxwell isn't a win, but it's the start. Harry admits to Sophie that Hardison is right, and a newscast about Maxwell comes in saying he's fled to Panama. Harry tells the others that Maxwell's family had one more emergency fund, and Parker tells Sophie that it's her call if they go after Maxwell. Sophie says that she said one job, but the job isn't done. As the others go to pack, Sophie looks at her and Nate's wedding ring on her finger."

A security guard comes over and Parker, posing as a janitor, pickpockets his badge. Sophie distracts Lola with a fake call, and Parker uses the badge to go up in the elevator posing as an intern while the senior partner, John Safer, is coming down to talk to Harry. Using the floorplans on his computer, Hardison directs Parker to Harry's old office, and Parker discovers the files on Harry's old clients aren't there.

Safer talks to Harry in the lobby, and Harry loudly says that Safer must have moved his files into Safer's office, so Parker can hear him over the comms. She goes there and finds the safe, while Harry berates Safe for working for Fletcher. Safer, unimpressed, walks away. Harry leaves, and Fletcher's guards drive up and take Harry to Fletcher. Eliot, posing as a workman, knocks them out and leaves with Harry. They go to an old abandoned business that belongs to one of Harry's old clients, but Hardison is distracted monitoring his operations around the world. Eliot confirms that RIZ tried to nab Harry, and Fletcher's family transferred Fletcher to Panama along with Ryan Corbett, a former US military intelligence agent who came along. Eliot knows Corbett from his reputation of being smart and ruthless, and Corbett bought the building where Fletcher is., and where Corbett uses the old CIA vaults to store any offshore valuables. Fletcher's family storing $20 million there, while Fletcher waits for his money to clear with Panamanian government. Sophie finally says they should go steal $20 million dollars. A drone is monitoring the team as they leave.

At the Panama City courthouse, Fletcher waits with Judge Ramos and complains that he's been waiting a week for the banks to transfer his funds. He slips Ramos a bribe, and Ramos says he can take care of it. As Ramos goes to his chambers, Hardison and Sophie approach him posing as UK agents who say they're after Fletcher for funding a terrorist attack and may have exposed Ramos to a toxin. Once they convince Ramos he's been exposed, he runs off to decontaminate himself.

Harry, Eliot, and Parker go into Corbett's building and start burning files, saying the Federales are coming. At the courthouse, Sophie tells Hardison that drawing on the past helps her, but she can't work forever. Eliot meets them at an open-air market, and Eliot spots the drone. and knocks it out with a thrown fruit. They spot one of Eliot's food trucks nearby, open the door, and find Hardison's foster sister Breana inside. They take her to the others, and Breana admits that she was tailing them just like Parker taught her when she was 11. Breana admits Nana doesn't know she's there, and she wants to fight rich guys rather than do day jobs. Hardison is reluctant, and Parker drags him off. Hardison hopes she'll make the right choice, while he calls Nana and finds out what's really going on. She goes back and tells Breana that she can do on job, and should get into the building's electronics and security to prove her worth. They figure Harry can get in because he ""reads"" like a Fed, and Breana uses Hardison's equipment to hack the building electronics.

Fletcher meets with Corbett and tells him that he wants his $20 million, but Corbett refuses unless Fletcher has the government paperwork. Corbett then meets with Harry, who gives him the tour of the building's vaults, while Fletcher texts with his mole, Corbett's aide. Later, Harry shows the plans to the team and Breana suggests they start an ATM pop-up concert next door to spoof the seismic sensors. Sophie, Breana, and Harry go to set up to the concert while the others drill into the vault.

The first team set up the concert for the Panamanian spider monkey and Sophie convinces DJ Com4rat to appear. Corbett hears about the concert, and goes to see Breana with some questions. She says that she's the concert promoter, turns on her comm, and patches the signal through to the others. As they head back Corbett asks Breana why she's there. Sophie gives Breana a general plan, saying Corbett is greedy and can't imagine anyone not like him. Breana tells Corbett that she's making a personal profit, and Corbett says that he's a big fan of Com4rat, and admires her hustle, and will come back and shoot her if he finds out that she's lying. He leaves with his aide, Diego, and the others arrive in time to see Corbett leave. Parker doesn't want to risk Breana's life, but Sophie figures Breana did well and they should give her a chance.

The next day, Hardison and Eliot take the drill to the target site. Hardison checks with Breana, who has things under control, and then with Harry, who has gold bricks rigged with explosives.

Fletcher meets in a park with Diego, and offers him $8 million if Diego gets him into the fault with his money. Diego agrees and says that he'll use the concert that night to distract Corbett. Sophie picks up the masked Com4rat at the airport, while in a nearby hanger Harry meets with Corbett and Diego and gives him the gold bars he wants to store in one of their vaults. At the base, Hardison is still working with his refugee problem via phone. Eliot notices and asks Hardison if it's a side gig, and it's okay if Hardison switches to something else. Hardison checks in with Breana, who is in one of the food trucks monitoring the concert-goers. She thanks Hardison for the opportunity.

As they drive to the building, Corbett assures Harry that his gold is safe. Then he gets a call.

Hardison is in contact with Sophie, and has her have Com4rat increase his music to cover the drill noise. She does and Eliot starts drilling, and Parker goes in through the vents. Diego suggests that Corbett meet with Com4rat, and Harry hides his face as Fletcher comes in to meet with Diego. Harry tells the team that Fletcher is there, while Corbett comes into the office and sees Hardison and Eliot drilling. He orders Diego to the vault, and Eliot fights Corbett while telling Hardison to keep drilling.

Diego goes to the vault and tells Fletcher to go to the office. Breana detects Diego's elevator and shuts it down, and blocks his walkie-talkie signal so he can't call for help. Eliot knocks out Corbett, and Harry arrives and tells him and Hardison that they can't access the vault level since Breana shut down the elevator. Breana tells Sophie that she won't let them down, and runs electronic interference for them. Hardison lowers a fiber-topic camera into the vault via the drill hole, and Parker enters the outside hallway via the vent. Breana intercept the code word request and hacks the system to get it.

Hardison directs Parker through safecracking the vault door, and she hears Diego and his men coming. Eliot crawls through the vents, drops down, and fights the approaching security men. Parker gets into the vault but smells lasers, and tells Hardison to talk her through them, while Eliot fights Diego. She gets to the box and opens it, which turns off the lasers. Fletcher enters the vault and draws a gun on Parker, and she smiles as Eliot comes up behind Fletcher, disarms him, and she knocks out Fletcher. They run into the neighboring concert, joining Harry and Hardison, with the recovering guards in pursuit. Corbett and Fletcher join them, and they figure one of their targets is hiding in the Com4rat costume. When Corbett pulls off Com4rat's mask, he reveals the real Com4rat. The guards run out the exit and find the waiting ravers,

The team meet up in the food truck, and then Harry calls Fletcher and tells him that US Marshals are on the way. Harry tells Fletcher to call his lawyers and make sure he's still paying the bills, and Fletcher does so. His phone signal triggers the detonator, which up Harry's explosive-rigged gold and everything in the vault. Corbett learns about it and is none too happy. He tells Fletcher that they have to run, for the rest of their lives,

Sophie tells Harry that Corbett was as bad as Fletcher, and they don't leave loose ends. Hardison asks Harry to help him with something, and Harry agrees.

Later back in New Orleans, the team meet at the bar they're using as their new base, and Hardison explains that they used the old business that they bought. He says that he's leaving, and Parker walks off, upset. Hardison goes after her, and says that he's going to Sri Lanka to prevent an economic collapse. Parker tells him that he should go, and wants him to do it. She asks him to take Breana with him, and Hardison finally reached Nana and found that Breana is doing the same thing he was going at her age. Parker hugs Hardison and tells him not to leave Breana with her,.

They go in and Sophie says that she's sorry her ""reunion concert"" has come to an end. Everyone think Sophie should stay, even Harry, and Eliot tells her they could use the help. Sophie agrees but says that it's not permanent. Harry serves drinks and figures that he'll stay with the team because they need an inside man."

She says that they did receive notification, but it said the new owners couldn't kick her out. Jake tells her there's a clause in the loan, and the new owners are exercising the loan to kick her out. Lenore's granddaughter, Ava, comes up to complain Jake is a thug. She pulls a shotgun on Jake, and, unimpressed, he says that he'll be back and threatens Ava.

Jake goes to his car where his boss, Austin Chaudry, is waiting. He tells Austin that Lenore will be evicted, and they drive off.

At the restaurant, Parker is wearing a suit covered with bells and training Breana how to pickpocket. Breana insists that the test is impossible, Sophie leaves to do ""client intake"" with Harry, and goes to meet with Lenore at the latter's house. Harry goes over the paperwork and confirms that Breana forged the clause so it appears Lenore put up the house as collateral, letting him foreclose on Lenore. Sophie admires the homemade dresses Lenore has made for her family, and Lenore goes to get her sketchbook. Ava tells Sophie that the neighbors have been driven out, and isn't interest in selling out. As Sophie and Harry leave, Sophie compliments Harry on how well he did.

At the restaurant, Breana reports to the team that their opposition is using a shell company, and the papers on the house were never filed. No one is impressed with her work to find out a shell company is involved, and the fact she didn't follow the money all the way. Harry figures whoever is foreclosing has someone in city hall, and Breana says she'll check it out but might have to crash the whole city's computers. Sophie says that they'll go old school and walks upstairs. Eliot and Parker put their fingers to their noses, and Breana and Harry don't get the joke.

At the City Hall Bureau of Records, Sophie and Harry go in and Breana directs them to the one employee who is living above his means. The two teammates go into the office of Billy Barnes and Harry blurts out that they're married. Sophie plays along and says she wants to determine what assets Harry is hiding, and Barnes looks them up on his computer but doesn't find anything. Sophie gets a glance at Barnes' laptop, while Harry overacts. Sophie matches him and storms out, and Harry goes after her and they talk about their marriages and divorces.

Sophie leaves her phone behind, and Breana uses it to clone Barnes' phone as he calls Austin, a former Congressman. Breana refuses to call Hardison for help, and she and Parker listen in as Austin tells Breana that they'll take possession in a week and then all Barnes has to do is count his money. Breana confirms who Austin is and reports to the rest of the team, and determines that he owns a riverboat casino, the 'Mississippi Pearl'. Breana boasts that she stole a thumb drive from Harry' briefcase, and discovers that Parker stole it from her.

Breana confirms that Austen has put everything he has into the casino, which has expanded onto land. If he fails to build his complex, he loses his license and goes bankrupt. Lloyd Van Winkle, with the Gaming Commission, decides if Austin gets the license, and Harry's firm dealt with him and Van Winkle is honest. Because of that, Austin will have to get his license legitimately and Sophie figures the team will have to stop Austin from doing that. Breana suggest they get Austin on a misdemeanor, and the others point out that Austin has connection that would make any misdemeanor disappear. Sophie figures they'll have to rob the casino's vault, and the team go over the casino plans.

Eliot applies for a job with the casino, while the others figure they have to meet with Van Winkle and convince Austin they're competing for his license. Harry has a membership at VAN WINKLE's gun club, where Austin meets with him, while Parker flirts with VAN WINKLE using a flowchart Hardison made for her. When Austin approaches Parker and VAN WINKLE, VAN WINKLE declines and Parker makes sure Austin hears her say they'll talk more about gaming licenses at a party later. Parker then talks to Harry about how her party, and how a nearby Sophie is planning it. Once Parker and Sophie leave, Austin approaches Harry, who tells him Parker's cover story and how she's planning to build a casino complex, and Austin asks Harry to introduce him to Parker.

Eliot interviews with Dennis, the head of casino security, He notices that Dennis used to be with the police and says he was as well, and Breana feeds Eliot information when Dennis asks him questions about where he was stationed. Eliot takes it from there, making it convincing.

Harry takes Austin over to Parker, who Sophie is arguing with and threatening to walk if Parker doesn't pay her what she promised. Once Sophie walks off, Austin offers Parker some ""friendly competition"" skeet shooting. As they shoot clay pigeons, Austin tells Parker that Louisiana doesn't have any spare gambling licenses. Harry shoots rigger clay pigeons for Austin so he misses, and Parker says a license might be opening up. Austin tells Jake to follow Sophie.

Dennis hires Elliot and shows him around, including the private team wearing suits that handles the casino money. Later, Eliot tells the team what he's seen and Breana suggests they don't need to follow the money but just be the money. The next day, Austin pulls up to Sophie on the street and invites her to join him, and she does. Meanwhile, Breana goes into the Pearl and puts down some money, and Parker briefs Breana over the comms on how to infiltrate.

Sophie goes for a walk along the river with Austin, and she says that she brings in big spenders for Parker's parties. She talks about how Parker plans to get the license through bribery, and Austin complains about his parents couldn't afford the bribes they needed to start a hotel. He vows that no one will stop him from building his ""empire"", and everyone will know his name. Austin suggests that Sophie bring Parker big spender--""whales""--to him.

Dennis shows Eliot the surveillance room, and tells him not to push the big red emergency button that seals the vault. There are no cameras in the vault, but in the counting room that is the only way in our out of the vault. Eliot secretly plants an electronic device on the cameras, letting Parker at the restaurant tap into the CCTVs. The money Breana is spending is marked with ID tape so they can follow it into the vault, and a guard shuts down the sensors around ""the world's largest pearl"" on display to clean it. Breana tells Parker and wants to steal it. Parker resists temptation and tells Breana to stay on mission, bur Breana approaches the pearl and Parker and Eliot both see her approaching the display. The head of security grabs Breana before she can grab the pearl, and Eliot gets there and takes Breana into custody. He then sends her to the restaurant.

At the restaurant, Parker complains that Breana didn't follow her orders. The others tells Breana to wait for her chance, and Sophie tells Breana that they might recognize her face so she's back in the food truck. The others figure they have ten minutes between shifts to crack the vault and grab the money, and get off the boat.

Harry finds Breana outside, and he asks her what she wants. She wants the world to stop sucking, and doesn't believe in hope. Harry tells Breana that she really has to be part of the team.

Later, Breana and Sophie time Parker hiding money underneath her dress. Once Breana leaves, Sophie tells Parker that they have to help Breana grow, and Sophie figures Parker needs a bigger dress.

That night, everyone is gambling at the Pearl. Parker comes in with a big white hoop dress that Lenore made for her. She sits down at a table to play, and Sophie is with Austin and tells him that she invited Parker so Parker could see all the ""whales"" lose. Eliot and Dennis are in the surveillance room watching the counting room, and Eliot gets Dennis out on a pretense for their ""window"". Breana loops the empty hallway footage Parker recorded earlier, and Parker excuses herself from VAN WINKLE, saying she has a ""personal bodily function"" to perform and it could take hours.

Three of the ""whales"" start winning big, thanks to them and the dealer being plants that are former friends of Nate, that Sophie brought in. Austin notices and goes over. Meanwhile, Eliot and Parker go into the counting room, knocking out the guard, and Parker easily safecracks the vault door. There's more money in there then will fit under the dress, and Eliot tells from a tattoo on the unconscious guard that the men in suits are Russian mob.

Sophie realizes that Austin is laundering money for the Russians , to finance his empire plans. Jake is the employee, protecting money for a Russian oligarch. She wants to regroup, but Breana comes up with an idea. The plants keep winning, and Austin assures Jake that it's fine. He goes over to the bar to order a drink, and Jake warns him not to lose Dmitri's money.

Breana assures everyone her plan will work, and Parker tells the team to ""trust the newbie"". Eliot follows Breana's instructions and goes through some heavily patrolled areas to get what they need. Jake calls the unconscious vault guard on the radio but gets no response, while Parker takes off her dress. Sophie sees Jake leave and tells Eliot to hurry, and Eliot gets a laundry cart. He knocks out more guards with nitrogen tanks and life jackets that he has in the cart, then unloads them in the boiler room. Dennis finds him and wonders what he's doing, and Eliot tells him that the guys in suits are Russian mafia. Dennis gets punches unconscious by another arriving guard, and Eliot knocks the guard out and makes sure Dennis okay.

Jake goes to the camera room, trying to reach the guard on the radio, and find the tapping device. Once he disconnect it, Jake sees the screens showing Eliot in the counting room. He also sees the unconscious guards scattered around the ship. Meanwhile, Sophie and Austin watch the plants win, and Sophie tries to dismiss it as a hot streak. Jake calls Austin and tells him that they have thieves in their vault, and Austin tells Jake to call the cops. The Russian hits the emergency seal button, trapping Parker and Eliot inside.

Jake rejoins Austin in the casino and they wait for the police. Austin tells Sophie to make sure the plants start losing and leaves with Jake, and Sophie signals the plants to cash out while she tries to raise Parker and Eliot on the comms. Austin and Jake go to the vault with the police and open the door, and find the vault empty with no one inside. Going back to the casino, Austin sees the plants cashing out and tells Sophie to stop them. VAN WINKLE is with Sophie and asks Austin if there's something wrong. The former congressman insists that there isn't, and Sophie loudly says the plants won $2 million. VAN WINKLE wonders if Austin can pay out, and Austin assures him that he can. He then accuses Sophie of setting the whole thing up, and tells the arriving police. Sophie asks Austin if he knew his casino ran a rigged game, in front of VAN WINKLE, and VAN WINKLE offers the police his office's assistance. Sophie smugly tells Austin that the Russians won't be happy with him, tell Austin that now everyone will know his name, and walks off. Jake takes Austin to see Dmitri.

As Sophie walks out, she hears Dennis telling a detective that the men in suits are Russian mob. She sees that the pearl is missing from the display case, while the police discover that the counting room floor is soaked. Earlier on Breana's instructions, Eliot and Parker sealed off the vault's air vents, filled the room with nitrogen from the tanks, then cut a hole in the floor and pushed the money through. The river current swept the money on the life jackets away, and then they dove in and followed it to shore. The others pick them, up and Parker tells Breana that she did a good job.

The next day, Sophie and Harry give the deeds, free and clear, to Ava and Lenore. Sophie assures the family that they've done the same for any neighbors still in the area, and anyone who got forced out will get fair compensation. Harry has also got the whole neighborhood historical status so no one can tear the houses down.

Back at the restaurant, Eliot calls Dennis and assures him he'll help him pass the entrance exam to the police force. He tells Breana that he doesn't make friends, and is furious when Parker eats the carrot cake Dennis sent him. After Eliot leaves, Breana asks Parker why she decided to trust her on the boat. Parker says that Hardison wrote to trust the person in the van on one of his flowcharts, and they both wish Hardison was there. Parker assures Breana that they have her and she's glad the girl is there. Breana wants to learn everything and take on the bad guy, and Parker says that Hardison trust Breana with Parker and she doesn't want the girl to come to harm. Breana says that she grew up in the world like it is and she's not scared, and Parker tells Breana that training starts tomorrow, tosses Breana the pearl, and leaves."

Mateo warns that they're cutting corners and can't afford to cut more, and Jason says that he doesn't care. As Jason laves via the stairs, the building shakes and he runs and gets out. The building collapses behind him as he takes cover behind a nearby car.

Three Years Later

Mateos's daughter Isabella is outside a new building Jason is constructing, and trying to raise people's attention about the death of her father Mateo after the building collapsed. Harry is across the street watching, Laster he goes to Xavi's home and says that he wants to talk about Mateo, and Xavi slams the door in Harry's face. Isabella answers the door and apologizes for her uncle, invites Harry in, and explains Xavi wasn't working the day the building collapsed. She says that Jason ignored Mateo's complaints, and the complaints disappeared from Jason's files. They're not homeless only because Xavi gets disability, and she just wants to make sure it doesn't happen again and wants Jason to be held responsible.

Later at the bar, Harry plays a newscast about the building collapse and how the charges were dismissed against Jason because of lack of evidence. Sophie says that they let their clients find them, and Breana briefs the team on how Jason is marrying Krista Moore-Crawley and they had the date of the wedding moved up. Krista's rich family connections got the charges against Jason dismissed, and her money is propping up Jason's real estate business. The couple is about to open a new building, the Axios Tower. Eliot notes that the plans show Axios is the safest building in America, because Jason is living in Axios. Sophie figures Jason's financial margins are razor-thin, and the Crawleys only have $10 million left. If something goes wrong with one of their loans, they won't have enough cash on hand to cover it. Harry wants to give Jason justice, and Sophie tells him that they'll do what they can. There's a new lead banker, Adreienne Bisset, assigned to the Crawley's loan and the couple have never met her, so Parker will take her place.

Parker calls Jason in his limo and tells him that she's checked his loans and discovered some overages. She tells him that she'll be coming by for an inspection, and Krista takes the phone and says that they're looking forward to it. Once Krista hangs up, she tells Jason that there's nothing for Parker to find and tells him to do his breathing exercises, while she and the driver, Liam, exchange glances.

Sophie then calls Adrienne pretending to be Krista, and says they're going to need more money to convert their floors, and invites her to come check it out.

The team goes to Axios, and Sophie tells the team that Parker will tour the completed area, while she tour Adreienne through the uncompleted area. Eliot and Breana will make the uncompleted area look like such a disaster that Adreienne will pull the loan. Breana and Eliot go in and wreck the uncompleted floors.

Parker meets with Jason in the lobby, while Harry and Sophie meet with Adreienne in an alley behind Axios. Breana and Eliot go back to the foot truck and Breana tracks both groups on her laptop. A nervous Adrienne quickly leaves, and almost runs into Parker and Jason as Parker leaves. Jason sees Harry and recognizes him a lawyer that used to work for his business. He jumps at loud noises and takes tranquilizers, and Harry goes over to the food truck. Sophie is waiting, and figures that Harry forgot to mention that he's connected to Jason.

Later at the bar, Harry tells the others that Jason was one of his former clients and it was his team that killed the case against Jason after the building collapse. Eliot points out that keeping information from them is how mistakes are made, and Harry admits that he saw a chance to make a little bit of what he did right. Sophie says that they don't work for Harry, and he's too close to the situation. Breana wants to keep Harry on the con, Parker, Eliot, and Breana all vote to keep Harry on, and Sophie agrees but tells Harry no more surprises. Sophie figures Adreienne will pull the Crawleys' loans, and that will give them a week to pay them back before the bank seizes Axios. Eliot figures they put the money out and control the situation, and Breana says that she can do her part. Sophie agrees but tells Breana that she'll do all the talking.

Once the Crawleys get word the bank is calling in the loan, Sophie and Breana go to see them. Sophie poses as a business manager to the ""artistic elite"", and Breana as a street artist, 6daze, who is looking to move to the States. Breana has already done a painting of Eliot and put it online for Krista to find, proving Breana's credentials. Krista says that it would be an honor to show them around, and takes them on a tour of Axios.

The Crawleys show Sophie and Breana the penthouse. Jason worries about the price, but Krista tells him that once word get out that Breana is living there, they can double the price on every unit. Liam comes in and tells Krista that she has a call, and she tells Jason to close the deal and goes with Liam. Sophie tells Jason that they can get a letter of credit as required, but it will take about two weeks. So he doesn't have to tell Krista he failed, Jason says that they'll take letters promising some of Breana's profits on her next sale, as long as they can get the money within a day.

Later, Sophie calls Jason and tells him that Breana has accepted a residency in Reykjavik and won't be moving in. Harry helped write the contract with a hidden clause that they can write when they want to. Krista goes over the contract with Jason and is not happy when she finds the clause, and they realized they can't get financing within the week. She insists she isn't going to let them fail and goes to make her phone call.

Harry tells Sophie that the Al-Abadi family just became shadow partners in Axios, and figures the team lost. He's received an invitation to Axios' opening. She meets with the team, and tells them the party has to be such a failure that the Al-Abadi's back out of the deal. They'll undermine Jason's faith in the tower, which will undermine the Al-Abadi's faith in Krista. She figures Jason is primed to stress out, and Breana has a plan to use rumble packs And subsonic projectors, which Parker helpfully tests on Breana, knocking her down. They need a place closer to Jason, and Eliot suggests they set up in the suite near the office. Parker has found a hidden safe in the nearby office, and Harry figures the evidence about the building collapse is there. Sophie tells Harry to focus on the con, but Harry and Parker convince Sophie to agree.

Eliot goes in with the caterers, posing as the head chef, and compliments Krista. He sees Krista leave with Liam, and plans the rumble packs he had hidden in his food tray.

At the restaurant, Harry prepares for the party. Sophie asks him if he can handle the situation, and he admits he didn't tell the team because he didn't want them to realize he took pride in his prior work when he was doing. Sophie assures him he isn't that person anymore, and Harry tells her that he won't let them down.

The team sets up their control room in the suite. Harry and Eliot take the elevator up, and Eliot tells Harry that they all have regrets but they move past them. He says that he learned how to live with what he did by not caring about how he hurt or who paid him, but the others showed him there was another way. Parker, hiding in a cart with them, agrees. As the trio go past Jason and Liam, Parker slips out and goes into the office. Parker first plants a heavy-duty rumble pack in the office,

Jason takes Harry to the party and introduces him, and he talks about how to hide cash. Meanwhile, Parker finds the hidden safe but discovers that it has an iris scanner. Rather than Parker getting Jason's iris with a pair of chopsticks, Breana has her find a high-res photo of Jason on his desk. Sophie realizes that Harry's hand is shaking because he feels ashamed and tells him not to let his shame get in the way, and to distract the partygoers while Parker opens the safe.

Parker uses the photo of Jason's eye to get past the scanner and open the safe, but only finds Jason's receipts for workmen's comp.

Jason tells Harry that the Al-Abadis want Harry to negotiate the deal. Harry angrily tells Jason that he helped make sure the Crawleys didn't have to pay Mateo because he didn't have his green card, and Jason has Liam take Harry to his car. Harry shows himself, and Sophie tells Harry that he got himself burned and he's off the con.

Harry goes to the control room, and Sophie tells him that he's out of second chances. She figures that they're still prepped and all they have to do is execute. Harry goes back to the party where everyone has dinner. Parker hides in a nearby vent and uses the equilibrium device on Jason. Jason falls on the floor and thinks the whole place is shaking, and goes to his office. In the office, Jason takes his tranquilizers and tells himself that the place is safe. As Eliot goes to the control room, Breana feeds alarms to Krista into Jason's computer. Jason calls the foreman, and Breana intercepts the call and tosses the phone to Eliot. Eliot says that the building is sub-standard.

Breana activates the rumble packs in the office, and Krista comes in and asks Jason what is going on. He says that she went behind her and hired contractors who did a terrible job. Jason shows her the contracts that Parker substituted, and Krista tells him to calm down. Krista tells him that the people who died don't matter, but they matter, and he needs to calm down so as to not ruin the deal. She tells him to stay out of sight and leaves, and goes back to the party and tells the guests that Jason has a migraine from working too hard. Al-Abadi says that they accept the deal, and Krista goes to the office to get the paperwork. She grabs Liam in the hallway, takes him with her, and says they're plan is working.

Eliot and Harry set off charge above Jason's office, making him think the building is collapsing. He runs past Al-Abadi and heads for the roof, and Sophie tells Harry to ""earn it back"" by going after Jason. Krista and Liam arrive by elevator in the control room, kissing, and Krista realizes that the team is trying to sink the deal and tells Liam to take care of them. Eliot intercepts Liam and the two men fight.

Jason makes it to the roof and Harry gets there. When Jason climbs up on the edge, Harry tells him he doesn't have to jump.

Krista takes Al-Abadi and his wife Sana to the nightclub where she says Jason is meeting them with the paperwork.

Eliot and Liam fight, while Breana looks on and provides not-so-helpful advice. When Eliot knocks Liam into the computer, it turns up the vibrations and breaks the computer so Breana can't turn them off.

The building shakes and Jason jumps... into the state-of-the art fire escape chute he knows is there. Parker arrives, and Harry jumps into the chute and reaches the ground level just to see Jason leave in a taxi. Sophie, Eliot, and Breana come out, and Sophie tells Harry that there's still the finale. Earlier, Parker told Jason that she could hide any money for him. He calls her and tells her to transfer the money, and does so and then jumps into the chute after Harry. Harry isn't impressed that they just got the money, and Breana sends Krista the video of Jason confronting her in his office. Al-Abadi and Sana are in the limo with Krista and hear the video, and Al-Abadi calls off the deal, while Sana says that all of their friends will know what happened.

Parker joins the others who are eating from the food truck, then goes back to take the chute again. Harry apologizes to Sophie for getting too close, and she tells him that it's personal for all of them, but they don't keep secrets from each other. Axios will go up for bid cheap in a few months, and they'll buy it. Then they'll donate the tower to a low-income housing non-profit, and gives Harry the files from the safe.

Later, Harry gives the file to Isabella and Xavi, and tells him that Jason pays into workmen's comp and the fund has one benefactor: Xavi. Xvi knew about the flawed structure, gave Xavi the money, and told him to keep quiet or they'd deport him. He apologizes to Isabella, who takes her uncle's hand comfortingly. Harry tells Xavi that if he comes forward and testifies, Harry will do everything he can to protect him, and make sure the Crawleys face real consequences for the collapse. Xavi agrees, and the others watch from outside through the window. Eliot figures that Harry has gotten back a little piece of his soul back."

Tina Reynolds is at Aunt Mildred's home, talking on the phone to her mother about her Mildred's funeral. As they argue about Tina moving in with her mother, with Tina refusing, the lights go out. Tina points out that Mildred left the house to her, and her mother cuts the connection. After Tina goes to bed, she jerks awake as a door in the house slams. She turns on a flashlight and hears doorsteps in the floor above, and a wind blows through the room. Mist fills the room, and the nearby candles light up by themselves. ""You did this!"" appears in blood-red letters on the mirror, and Tina screams and runs out. She knocks one of the candles over, setting the bedsheets on fire, and runs out to the street where she's hit by a passing car. Parker sis nearby, goes over to Tina, and tells the driver to call 911. As people gather, Tina gasps out that she came back two men, Lyle and Deke Herbert, walk away and the older one says that Tina is a problem. The younger one, Lyle, wonders what they're going to do now.

Halloween Day

Breana, wearing a skeleton costume, is wearing a skull costume and decorating the bar for the holiday. Sophie comes in with a mummy dummy, and asks Breana why it's by the front door. Breana points out that Sophie said she could decorate, but Sophie didn't anticipate her going overboard. in response, Breana notes that Christina Killian Santoro is leading the Halloween parade the night, and she's a politician who goes after crooked polluters and other criminals, and Breana read that Christina loves Halloween and wants to impress her. Sophie tells Breana to take it all down and she can decorate the attic.

Parker comes in with Tina on crutches, and Tina sits down with them and tells them what happened. She says that the insurance company accused her of setting the fire herself for the payout, The women offer Tina their spare bedroom, and Breana takes Tina there. Sophie believes Tina's story but tells Parker they can't let guests stay there. Harry and Eliot are in Brunei helping Hardison with an extradition, and they both agree they're not committing crime, although they obviously are. Parker admits that she's afraid of ghosts, and figures they have to help Tina.

Parker and Breana go to the house and search the house, posing as arson investigators. As Breana finds the guestbook from Mildred's funeral, Officer Stuart comes in and tells them that no one is allowed in. Parker bluffs Stuart and he leaves, and after he leaves she finds a hidden speaker and takes it back to the bar to show Tina. They also find projectors that projected the mist and writing. Tina refuses to say why Mildred would blame her for her death, and hobbles off. Parker figures that they just convinced Tina more that she's haunted by showing her evidence that she isn't, and they have to plant clues so Tina figures out for herself the ""haunting"" is fake.

Parker goes through the guest book, looking for anyone who might have come in to plant the equipment. She spots Lyle and Deke as strangers, and Sophie calls the insurance company and confirms they want absolute proof Tina didn't set the fire. They're from New Jersey, and Sophie figures that it's a real estate scam. The Revenant Realty company they're with is out of New Jersey, and Lyle owns the company and after his brother's death, his nephew Lyle put his design degree plans on hold to help Lyle. Parker figures they need to show Tina who the Herberts really are, and Sophie says that they'll turn the bar into the perfect mark for the Herberts and then Tina will see them at work.

Later, Parker finds Tina packing. Parker explains that there are people that take advantage of the gullible and weak-willed. Tina talks about why she holds herself responsible for Mildred's death, and it was her fault Mildred died. Parker convinces Tina to stay one more day and has Tina tell her what the Herberts did, so they can know what to expect.

The Herberts arrive late and Sophie, playing the grieving widow, greets them. Deke admits he used to be a designer, much to Lyle's irritation. Lyle has a cover story for how he knew the dead man, ""Big Daddy"", Deke goes off to put away the flowers and tamper with the breaker box. and Breana opens the locked lid for him via remote. He flickers the lights right on cue. Lyle suggests that it might be a sign from Big Daddy, and Deke comes back. Sophie says that Big Daddy died there in a fall, and the Herberts suggest she might sell the place, and they'd be interested in buying. Sophie says she'll stay unless Big Daddy tells her otherwise, and then escorts them out.

As they walk away down the street, Lyle tells Deke that it's the perfect setup for their con. Deke figures that it was too perfect, and his uncle tells him to focus. Lyle calls a man and tells him that they have another place and they'll have it cleared out by that night. The man, the Wraith, looks over his table of guns.

Sophie and the others ""se the scene"", figuring the Herberts are in a hurry because they bought Sophie's story so easily. Breana has set up the cameras so Tina can see everything, and put the monitors in her guest room. After night falls, the Herberts sneak in and Breana turns on the lights, startling them. Sophie loudly says on the phone that she's going up to her room for a nap, and Lyle says that they have to get thing done fast.

Breana shocks and drops paintings on the Herberts via remote control, then runs off to do the ""big finish"", with Parker and Tina following her. Meanwhile, Sophie confronts the Herberts and says that they're trespassing,. Wraith and his spotter Hamilton come in and Wraith wonders why Sophie is there. The Herberts grab Sophie, and Wraith draws a knife on Sophie but tells the Herberts to kill her. Parker, watching with Tina, recognizes Wraith as a notorious hitman and tells the others via the comms.

The Herberts tie up Sophie, and Deke suggests to Wraith that Sophie harmless and they let her go. Wraith says that they're his problem if they want to let Sophie go, and Hamilton shows him a podcast of Santoro and the parade approaching. Lyle takes the hint and tells Wraith that they'll take care of Sophie. Breana see the podcast and realizes that Santoro is Wraith's target, and the New Jersey Mob sent small-timers like the Herberts in to secure houses along the parade route. The parade will pass the bar in ten minutes,

Parker and Tina go up to Tina's room on the third floor and Parker tells Tina that she's going out the window.

Lyle tells Deke that he didn't sign up to kill anyone, and Sophie asks him what he wants to do. The younger man says that he only signed up to drive people out of their homes. When Lyle talks about their scam, Wraith overhears him and tells him that people shouldn't mess with the afterlife. He insists that the spirits are real. He says that he didn't cause people's death, and is just a weapon. Sophie overhears him and tells Breana that she has an idea. Breana reports that she has access to all the ""haunting"" equipment that she set up as well as the Herberts.

Wraith sends Hamilton up to the third floor to find a good line of sight, and Sophie warns Parker. Hamilton comes in and Parker fights him, and then tasers him unconscious. Breana turns on the speakers, and Sophie tells Wraith that it's the house voicing its opinion.

Parker lowers Tina down on a rope, and Breana has her start on the fog projector. Meanwhile, Sophie goes over Wraith's victims from Breana's briefing earlier, and how the ghosts aren't happy with Wraith's presence there. He threatens her with a knife when she keeps talking, and she reminds him that he thinks he doesn't cause the deaths of others. Wraith tells Lyle to kill Sophie, and when Lyle tries to put Wraith off, Wraith gives Deke the knife, tells him to watch Sophie, and drags Lyle off with him. Sophie screams at Deke to put the knife down, and when Wraith and Lyle run back, they find Sophie with her throat cut.

The parade approaches and Wraith tells the guilt-ridden Deke that it's time. Parker sets up the speakers and Breana warns her that Wraith is heading her way. Parker hides in the rafters as Wraith comes in, and he sets up to shoot Santoro. The voices whisper to Wraith and the fog spreads through the room,

Lyle tells Deke that they should leave and let Wraith take the blame. The two men go to get their equipment and hear the voices, and when they try to run, a crate slides over and blocks their path.

The spirits of Wraith's victims appear to him in the mist, thanks to Breana's computerized animations. Earlier, Sophie convinced Deke to help them in return for getting him back into design school. When Deke agreed, Breana supplied fake blood packs so they could fake Sophie's ""death"". Breana took photos of the ""dead"" Sophie, and animated it into a ""spirit"" which Parker helps project to confront Wraith. Wraith panics and runs into a cabinet, knocking Hamilton out of it. Hamilton is tied up in a sheet, and Wraith further panics. As Wraith run downstairs, Parker drops down and tasers Hamilton unconscious again.

Wraith tells the Herberts that they have to get out, and Breana turns up the ""voices"". A skeleton pulls Deke out of the room, and Breana hits Wraith and Lyle with all of the effects. They panic and run out, where Tina is waiting with the police she summoned. The two men are glad to confess as long as the police get them away from the ghosts.

Parker and Sophie escort Deke out, Parker having played the skeleton. He's glad he has a chance to go out of the family business and go back to school, Later, the woman gather and Breana sends the footage to Tina's insurance company to convince them the fire was an accident. Tina figures she'll rebuild her aunt's property, and her aunt would have wanted her to. Parker gives Tina Mildred's cane that they found in the house, and they all share a toast to neighbors.

Harry and Eliot return the next day, and the women tell them what happened. The women say that they went trick-or-treating but Parker refuses to share her candy. A door opens on its own, and Harry figures the women are messing with him. Voices start whispering, and the women put on skeleton masks and reach for Harry and Eliot."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12197716/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,The Leverage team dives into the world of a high fantasy collectible card game with a devoted following to take down a pharmaceutical bad boy who is price-gouging drugs to fund his own house of cards.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Francis dela Torre'],"['', '', '']",[],"['uprooted tree', 'prescription drug', 'drug price increase', 'laid off', 'pendis pharmaceutical', 'cordocorp hedge fund', 'vulture capitalist', 'niche medical treatment', 'price gouging', 'suck up', 'deed', ""springer's castle"", 'competitive', ""spirit's ruse card game"", 'rochambo', 'annual game faire', 'tailing a suspect', 'disguise', 'impersonation', 'vault', 'clue', 'queen ziel card', 'turkey leg', 'medieval costume', 'jousting', 'sword fight', 'twirlling a sword', 'squid', 'tree', 'hole in the ground', 'wearing a crown']",[],"Jenna and her father Michael are walking through the woods, and come to an uprooted tree. Michael gives Jenna her medication on schedule but only gives her one pill, and admits that it's the last one they have even though Jenna is supposed to have two. He hopes that the truck will sell, and she collapses after taking the pill.

Later, Harry and Sophie meet with Michael, who says that Jenna is still in the hospital and has a respirator disease called Swale fever. She gets treatment once a month, and the pill cost went from $30 each to $3,000 each. Michael got laid off six months ago, and the pharmaceutical company, Pendis, got bought out recently by a hedge fund, Cordocorp. He couldn't afford the deductibles and the pills, and the company wouldn't tell Michael the reason for the price hike, Jenna and other kids like her might die because of the price hikes.

The owner, Jim Cordozar, invokes his Fifth Amendment rights at a hearing about his price hikes. The team watch video of the hearing and Harry explains that no legal action was taken against Cordozar, a ""vulture capitalist"", and he's negotiating with several other pharmaceuticals after his success with Swale fever. What Cordozar's doing isn't illegal, so they'll find his weakness and go after him.

At Cordocorp, Parker and Breana go in with Breana looking for a job there after Parker makes sure the woman Breana would be replacing didn't show up for work. Breana ""bumps into"" Cordozar's assistant Carter Lagrange and introduces herself, and says the temp agency sent her. Parker is pretending to be a HR rep, making Lucy watch sexual harassment videos. Carter takes the coffee Breana brought in for Cordozar, directly to his boss. Harry and Eliot are at the office watching via Breana's hidden lapel camera, and Harry confirms that Carter is an artificial intelligence expert and Cordozar's key man who writes the programs that helps Cordozar make all the trades. Carter and Cordozar are college friends, and Cordozar exploited Carter's intellect in return for social status.

Cordozar goes off with Carter, and Breana sneaks into Cordozar's office and plans a hidden camera in a lamp. She searches his personal belongings and finds a photo of a castle that she recognizes. Carter comes in and asks Breana what she's doing there, and Breana asks him if Cordozar bought Springer's Castle. He's surprised that Breana recognizes it, and she says that she's a big fan of the game it's the origin for, Spirit's Ruse. Carter says that he wrote an algorithm to find it for sale, and they bond over geek talk. He confirms that Cordozar isn't a fan, but came in second place in a tournament in elementary school. As Breana leaves the office, she tells the others that Spirit's Ruse is the best CCG ever.

Later at the bar, Sophie tells the team that Cordozar can't resist exploiting an opportunity and they can use that against him. Breana briefs the team on Spirit's Ruse, who is a recluse who no one has seen in over a decade. Fans come to the castle once a year for an annual faire and there's a treasure hand to run the super-rare Queen Ziel card. The tournament winner is crowned queen or king of the faire, and they'll convince Cordozar to buy the company that makes the game, while making a fake company to sell him. Then Cordozar will invest all of his assets and lose everything.

The next day at Cordocorp Breana tells Cordozar and Carter that the people she works for want to buy the castle at twice the price Cordozar paid for it. She gives Cordozar a card with a number to call and leaves, and Cordozar tells Carter to follow Breana. Breana leads them to a hangar filled with promo material for the castle. Sophie poses as a developer, and Cordozar figures she wants to turn the castle into a theme park. Sophie says that she's working with someone who will pay double the amount Cordozar paid, even though Carter says Deric Springer would never sell the company. Cordozar tells Sophie that he's going to host the faire for at least the next two years, and Sophie says that she worked for Springer and the designs were what she did for the company. Cordozar doesn't think the company would have sold him the castle if it was worth anything, Sophie claims that Spirit's Ruse will be the beginning of a big franchise, and she'll tear it apart and sell the pieces. Cordozar says that it's a dumb idea and refuses to sell, then leaves. Sophie admits to Breana that they screwed it up... perfectly.

Back at his office, Cordozar confirms that Springer is a recluse that no one has seen for years. He send an email to Springer's last known email address, asking for a meeting. Breana intercepts it, and they send Harry in to pose as Springer, with a fake beard and some extra weight. Harry wants to sell the company because it has made the game into a business, not art, and negotiates as a curmudgeonly artist rather than a lawyer. The real Springer also shows up in Cordozar's office, and Eliot, posing as Harry's lawyer, drags Harry out of sight. Carter has used an analytic program to find Springer, and Springer says that he's ready to sell.

The team regroup at the bar and figure that they messed up by giving Cordozar the idea he could buy the game from Springer. Sophie says that they're not giving up, and what happened when Nate lost his son. Breana ties into the camera feed in Cordozar's office and they listen to Cordozar and Springer talk. Springer doesn't want to hand the game over to a non-fan, and Cordozar says that he has the Queen Ziel card, and shows a photo of it in its original vault Springer will only work from a handshake, and Cordozar is glad to shake with him. The game designer says that they'll shake at the faire on the upcoming Saturday, and Cordozar will walk him through the clues he solved to find the card. They'll trade the card for the company.

Breana tells the team that the Queen Ziel card is the holy grail of the game, and it's hidden in a secret vault in the castle. No one has been ever to solve the clues Springer left to the vault's location, and if they get their hands on the card before Cordozar does, they can kill the deal. They examine the photo and Parker figures she can break into the vault in the photo if they can find it.

The team go to the castle, and Harry will get Parker into the castle as Cordozar shows Springer how he found the vault. Sophie and Eliot will intercept Springer and try to keep him away from Cordozar as long as they can. Breana gives Parker her own note back on her analysis of the clues to the card, and Parker says she doesn't need it because she can find the vault doing the ""Parker stuff"".

Harry claims to be a member of the local union and distracts the guard while Parker slips in. Meanwhile, Sophie and Eliot slip into an employee to get costumes, much to Eliot's disgust. Breana intercepts Cordozar, Carter, and Cordozar's bodyguard, Bolo, and Cordozar tells her that he's buying the company so she loses. Breana isn't impressed, and Cordozar threatens to have Bolo throw her off the property. She reminds him that he came in second-place in his elementary school tournament, and Cordozar backs down so Breana walks off. Cordozar tells Carter that Springer will see through him in giving him the clues, but if he wins the tournament he'll prove himself worthy. He tells Bolo to find Springer before Sophie does, and make Sophie disappear.

Sophie and Eliot come out wearing costumes, Eliot dressed in armor. They spot Springer and check in with Parker, who says that she's searched everywhere and there is no vault. Breana says that the game is a quest, and the vault is somewhere on the property, hidden. Sophie greets Springer, who is happy that someone at the faire recognizes him, Springer goes to meet with Cordozar, but Sophie convinces him to stay and watch Eliot in the jousting tournament. Cordozar and his group see them and follow.

Carter rigs a pair of glasses with a hidden microphone to get him through the card tournament. Breana tells Harry and Parker that they have to be on a part of the ground where they can't see the castle, based on the first clue. That only narrows it down to half the grounds.

Eliot enters the jousting track wearing an inflatable dragon ring, and Bolo sends two of his men in with instructions to ""break"" Eliot. His opponent deflates the dragon and the two swordfight, along with Bolo's men. Eliot realizes they're experienced fighters, and Sophie spots Bolo in the crowd. The fight is real, and the crowd cheer as Eliot tosses away his sword and fights hand-to-hand. Everyone applauds as Eliot wins. Meanwhile, Breana is playing in the card tournament and realizes that the lake picture on a card is longer than the pond on the property. She figures the vault in in the space on the lake that isn't on the pond. Parker wonders what kind of mentor she is if Breana is teaching her things, and Harry says that she's the best kind and Breana is trying to connect with Parker, and Parker should let her.

Breana and Cordozar both win and end up playing each other. He tells her that she's going to lose the tournament because she's worried about being nice, and if she wants to be a winner then she has to take and take, and don't worry about who likes her. Breana points out that he's not worried about the kids who can't afford his drugs, and Bolo calls Cordozar and tells him that Sophie is with Springer. Cordozar tells Bolo to get Sophie away from Sophie and over to him.

Springer wants to leave, and Sophie asks him to stay for her sonnet recital. Breana has Sophie say that she's reciting one of his sonnets, and Springer gives in. While Sophie waits to recite, Breana is called back to her match with Cordozar. She realizes that he's cheating and calls a time out, then intercepts the signal to Carter, who says that Breana needs one card to win and Cordozar has an 86% chance of winning, using the same algorithm to calculate the odds that he used to find the vault. Breana tells Harry and Parker, and Parker hesitantly praises Breana.

Sophie gives her typical bad acting performance, and Breana listening in realizes that the clue is in the sonnet. Parker and Harry find the tree mentioned in the sonnet, while Sophie gets into her performance and everyone applauds as Parker finds the tree branch that is secretly a lever that opens the vault. Breana returns to the game, while Parker and Harry enter the vault and discover the card is gone, and Cordozar must have it.

Breana plays the one card she needs to, and Cordozar accuses her of looking through her glasses. She points out that's impossible because he doesn't have a camera built into his glasses. Cordozar has no choice but to toss away his glasses, but calls for a new deck for the final round. Eliot and Sophie find Springer and Bolo, while Harry searches the boxes in the vault and says they might have found something even better.

When Springer and Bolo enter the tent, Cordozar calls a timeout and goes over to greet Springer. Cordozar shows Springer the Ziel to prove he's a fan, and Sophie and Eliot come in. Harry and Parker come in and say that the FDA is going to freeze all of Cordozar's assets. Cordozar hid his own valuable in the vault thinking it was safe, including his research on the cure for Swail fever. They sent the cure to all of Cordozar's competitors, so now the drug treatment is worthless. That's fraud, so even if Cordozar doesn't go to jail, he'll lose his company and banned from ever busying another drug company again. Bolo tries to attack them, and Eliot knocks him out. Sophie points out that Cordozar doesn't have any money to buy Springer's company, and reminds Springer that he promised to sell him the company if Cordozar gave him the card. Springer insists on keeping his word, and Breana asks if he's going to keep his word to her and all the people who love the game he created. She says that Cordozar can't show Springer how he found the vault, and it's more than just a business to all the fans. Breana tells Springer that his game made them feel like they weren't alone in the world, and they could belong.

Springer tells Cordozar that he can't sell him his company, and gives the Ziel to Breana. She takes it as the fans applaud, and she bows to Springer.

Later at the bar, Michael tells Harry and Sophie that Jenna is responding to her new treatments. They got the company's new owners to pay Jenna's bills, and happy they can avoid paying a class action lawsuit. Sophie tells Michael that knowing Jenna and the kids like her will be fine is all the payment they need, and all she needs. Harry and Sophie then go back to the others, who are playing Spirit's Ruse for money with Breana teaching everyone."

Libby drives off and calls her friend Parker to tell her what happened.

Later, Parker gathers the team and tells them about Libby. Libby and Frankie are in a safehouse, and Parker explains that Reese is a cop in small-town Arlo, LA. Libby got full custody of their daughter, but Reese won't leave them alone. Four years ago, she, Eliot, and Hardison helped hide Libby in a new town, and gave her and Frankie new identities. Hardison wrote an algorithm to scrub Libby's face off the Internet, and Reese could only have found Libby by cracking Hardison's algorithm. Eliot suggests an analog solution, but Breana doesn't believe it and figures something else is going on.

Parker, Harry, and Eliot go to Arlo to check it out, and they notice the police cars are the latest models and have state-of-the-art computers. There's been a tech boom in the area, and Breana confirms via computer that the crime rate in Arlo has gone down over the last six months. Eliot points out all the CCTVs, the latest tech, and Sophie figures the police are being paid to use it. Breana sets Eliot up with a fake ID with a Federal bench warrant out on him. Eliot bumps into a man while going to a coffee shop to get spotted by the CCTVs, while Parker watches Eliot. The police arrive within a minute, even though Eliot is covering half his face.

Federal marshal Maria Shipp approaches Eliot, who immediately runs. Maria goes through the shop and ambushes Eliot in the back alley. He disarms her, and the two fight hand-to-hand. The marshal manages to hold her own, but the police arrive and capture Eliot at gunpoint. Breana tells Sophie that Arlo has advanced facial recognition that is more powerful than the FBI's by a factor of ten. Sophie has Breana make the bench warrant disappear, and then go into the system physically. They call Parker in so she won't get recognized by the system.

Breana goes to the Arlo police station after wiping the warrant. Harry is Eliot's lawyer, and demands that the police release Eliot. Maria isn't convinced, and she and Eliot flirt. She figures that Eliot is former special op, even though his record doesn't show it. Breana goes to the server room and realizes that a program named Searchlight is running... and is predictive and told the police that Eliot was going to a bank to rob it. Whoever wrote Searchlight scraped millions of photos. The author, the man Eliot bumped into outside the coffee shop, is watching Breana via the monitor cam, and seals the server room and turns on the fire suppression system.

Harry goes to the server room to try to get Breana out, and a security guard approaches Harry. The ex-lawyer tries to choke him out on Eliot's advice, Parker has Harry use the guard's taser to overload the magnetic plate on the locked door, freeing Breana.

The trio go back to the bar, Breana says that no other facial recognition software compares to Searchlight. Reese found Libby using the police access to Searchlight, and Libby was in the background on a photo. The image was so blurry Hardison's algorithm didn't flag it, but Searchlight did. It can be used by dictators and mobsters, and Arlo is small enough to be a controlled experiment. There has to be a dedicated line running from the police station to the master computer. Eliot and Parker go back to Arlo to track the high-end security like the guard at the police station, figuring they and their portable fitness devices can lead them to the master computer.

Later in Arlo, Eliot and Parker spot three guards at the coffee shop. Eliot distracts the nearby Maria, while Parker poses as a waitress and takes one of the guard's cell phones and fitness devices. Inside, Maria notes she's there to investigate the lowered crime rate and Eliot gives her his real name. They go back to the bar, and Breana determines the private house outside of Arlo where the master computer is. Maria texts Eliot, and the others notices and tease him about it. Eliot identifies the man he bumped into as Joseph Cheng, from the driver's license photos of the homeowners in the area. He's a reclusive Silicon Valley game designer.

Parker, Eliot, and Breana go to Arlo and watch Cheng from a food truck. and Breana confirms that Cheng sues anyone who write about him, so there's not much information out about him. He wrote an app game and then was sued for marketing information on his customers to marketing companies. Parker is in the shop and sees Cheng complaining to barista about her using the wrong oil in his coffee, and she cracked a cell tower and found calls between Cheng and a Buddy Harwick. Harwick is Cheng's investor, and Breana hacks Harwick's phone. Harwick is meeting with RIZ in two days, and they'll sell Cheng's software to all their clients.

Breana and Eliot go to Cheng's mansion, posing as utility workers. Cheng has massive security and they figure his servers are in the house. Breana sends in a drone to get the layout, but an electrical fence shorts it out. Eliot starts up a drill, and Cheng's house ALAY-NA warns him that his blood sugar level is low. Cheng is upset that the drill is running his concentration, and he pounds on the window in anger.

Harry gets into Harwick's emails and learns that Harwick has been trying to get Cheng to see a social interaction consultant.

Breana taps the fiber optic lines going into the house, and confirms that there are no camera in the house. She finds a line for biometric scanners and figures the smart-house AI is Cheng's security. In the house, ALAY-NA tells Cheng to get some extra sleep, and he tells the AI that it's the best. Meanwhile, Breana tells Eliot that Cheng is trying to control people's lives, and they won't be able to escape their mistakes or pasts. She wonders how she can beat Cheng if Cheng beat Hardison's algorithm, and Eliot assures her that they figure Breana can beat Cheng and he know she can.

Sophie figures they'll ruin Cheng's big sale, and then hack into his servers. Harry send a text from Harwick's phone to Cheng, pushing up the meeting a day. He's working as a barista at the shop, having bought out the previous owners, and annoys Cheng until he tells Harry his name and to let him go. Breana has sawed through Cheng's chair leg, causing him to fall over and further unravel. Harry tempers with Cheng's coffee order, as he tries to sell his program to the RIZ representatives. The representatives leave, and Harwick looks up social interaction representatives and comes up with Sophie and Parker's names, thanks to some Internet tampering by Breana. Sophie will distract Cheng with advice, while Parker finds the server so Breana can hack in and wipe the root code. ALAY-NA talks with them, and Breana tells her teammates via the comms not to say anything to them, because ALAY-NA will hear them.

Eliot tells Sophie to use beta blockers if necessary to keep Cheng calm, while Parker looks for a way into the servers. ALAY-NA feeds Cheng signals via his glasses that Sophie is lying, and Sophie says that she's lying and doesn't find tech that impressive. Sophie riles Cheng, while Parker goes into the bathroom to find Cheng's medication and ALAY-NA talks to her. Breana suggests they hack Cheng rather than his system, and alter his biometric signifiers. using his antihistamines. Then ALAY-NA will mistake him for an intruder, he'll have to shut down the system, and the team can go right in. Eliot has Parker use her graphic to alter Cheng's handprint to further confuse ALAY-NA.

Parker and Sophie go to work, removes his glasses, and give him eye drops to help him ""blink less"". Cheng figures ALAY-NA is malfunctioning and the house identifies him as an intruder, then puts the house into lockdown. A security guard is called in, and Eliot chokes him out. He and Breana then go in posing as guard and insist on doing a clean sweep of the premises. Cheng confirms that Breana is the person he identified at the station, and figures they're trying to steal his software. He resets ALAY-NA, then tells it to lockdown the house and call the police. He runs out to his car and calls Warwick to tell him they're closing the deal immediately.

Parker duplicates Cheng's biometrics and fools ALAY-NA, with Breana using Cheng's voice from earlier and raising her heartbeat to his. ALAY-NA recognizes her as Cheng and unlocks the house, and Sophie has Harry stall Cheng while Breana erases the root code. Harry approaches Cheng in Arlo and gushes over his game app, 'Dozer Duel'. Meanwhile, the team releases a news alert of Cheng being an international fugitive he meets with Warwick and the RIZ people at the shop. The RIZ representatives say that they're done, and Cheng loses his temper and storms out. ALAY-NA sees Cheng's reflection in a window and notifies the authorities, and Maria knocks Cheng out as he tries to run.

Later, Cheng goes back to his house. The team is waiting for him, and Sophie tells Cheng that everyone's sins have been wiped out except his. He says that he'll change his software back, and Breana tells him that they control Searchlight and ALAY-NA. ALAY-NA speaks up to agree, and Sophie advises him to sign the house over to them rather than face a lawsuit for compromising people's privacy.

Later at the bar, Parker and Eliot vies Libby everything she needs to relocate, with ALAY-NA's help. Breana talks to Harry about his knowledge of 'Dozer Duel', and figures he's a real fan of the game. Harry smugly says that she has no proof, and no one would believe her if she did. Sophie asks Eliot when he's going to see Maria again, and her own life changed when the right person arrested her. Eliot gets a text from Maria, ignores it, and tells Sophie that it isn't like that before walking away.

Breana has made up a list of her mistakes, and Parker tells her that what she did before she joined the team doesn't matter to them. The team tell her that they don't need her to be Hardison, but just the person she is, mistakes and all."

Fake Nate walks up and tells them that they should keep their heads, and he knows they can because he's the Mastermind.

King Navid looks at a manuscript of 'The Mastermind' and figures that's exactly what he needs, and chuckles in triumph.

At the bar, Sophie prepares to go out for the anniversary of Nate's death, and Parker tries to stop her. Eliot brings Sophie some of her favorite vegan dishes that he made for her, and Sophie tells them to stop cosset her, and insists that she's fine. Harry comes in with Sophie's favorite British drama for movie night, and Sophie says that she's going to go buy clothes to cope. Breana arrives and shows them the manuscript, and the team read the copies. They wonder how someone has all the intel on them, and Eliot complains that he's portrayed as a brute who flips his hair a lot. The manuscript kept popping up the Internet, and Hardison's algorithm kept finding it popping up. The book hasn't been published yet, and Eliot warns that there's enough right to be dangerous.

Sophie is clearly upset about reading the manuscript, and Harry joins her with a drink. She tells him that it's the anniversary of the day she and Nate met, and she talks about how it feels like Nate is back when she reads the manuscript. Sophie points out that she isn't in the book, and apparently she isn't important to the story. Harry figures that Nate didn't feel that way, and Breana tries to track down the author but finds nothing. The publishing company put out a website on the author, but there is booking info about media appearances, and the publishing contract has a kill clause so the author can stop it at any time. Sophie figures that the author isn't Nate, and he's going to pay for that.

The author is preparing to do an appearance at a TV studio, and Eliot and Harry come in as exterminators and claim there's an outbreak of rare dangerous insects. Once everyone leaves, Fake Nate pulls up and Breana is outside to greet him. She brings him in, pretending to be a PA, and Navid comes up and says that he was hoping to have a word with Fake Nate. Breana blows Navid off and goes inside, and manages to get hold of Fake Nate's phone. She clones it and sends him to the studio, and figures Fake Nate is a schmo.

Fake Nate comes in where Eliot and Parker are waiting, and Breana comes in and calls in Sophie, posing as the host Fake Nate sits down with her and recites Nate's words about what the team does. Sophie points out that everyone stole from knows who he is, and Fake Nate says he didn't think of that. Suddenly nervous, Fake Nate says that he knows how to counteract any measures taken against him, and Sophie sarcastically says that he's a mastermind and can handle any situation. Fake Nate vaguely agrees, and the show ends and Breana escorts Fake Nate out. He discovers that he's been hacked out of his own phone, and someone is demanding a million dollars or they'll release all of Fake Nate's emails.

Parker approaches Fake Nate and tells him she's a Russian agent. She says that they need to contact one of his marks, an oligarch, and want Fake Nate to reach out to him while wearing a wire. Fake Nate excuses himself to use the restroom. He runs for the exit, and Eliot grabs him and pretends to be a former mark looking for revenge, but is going to let Fake Nate run for the rest of his life.

Fake Nate runs out, and Harry approaches him and claims he's the publisher's lawyer and it's the publisher's responsibility to protect Fake Nate. Harry suggests that Fake Nate cancel the book's publication, and Fake Nate hugs him in relief. Breana and Sophie are inside watching via a hidden camera, and something scrambles the signal. Navid and his thugs dart Fake Nate and Harry, then load them in a van and drive off. The others come out, and Breana confirms that someone used a high-grade military signal jammer to block the cameras. Breana brings up image of Navid from earlier, and Eliot identifies him as from a Middle Eastern nation, Zafir. They go to the airfield Navid and his mercenaries were heading.

When Fake Nate wakes up, he's in Navid's limo. Navid tells Fake Nate that he's about to steal something for him. They pull up to a private museum in south of France, and Navid explains that he wants Fake Nate to steal Zafir's most treasured artifact: the Zafir Scarab. He admits that the Scarab doesn't belong to him, but his ex-wife Liliana. Navid escorts Fake Nate inside before Liliana can see them, Inside, Navid explains that he and Liliana got divorced, and she got the Scarab in the settlement. He wants it back, and he can't afford the international fallout of having his men shoot the place up. Navid needs a mastermind, and there'll be a party where Fake Nate can blend in. If Fake Nate doesn't get the Scarab by the end of the day Navid will kill Harry and Fake Nate. Fake Nate says that he doesn't know Harry, but Navid figures that Fake Nate is putting on an act.

As Navid walks off, Sophie comes up to Fake Nate and tells him that he's in a fix. Eliot is there as well, and drags Fake Nate out to a food truck. Breana is there, and Fake Nate realizes who they are. Fake Nate admits that he's an accountant for IYS, Nate's insurance company, and was Nate's forensic accountant. The accountants did the behind-the-scenes research, and Nate was the only one who paid them any attention, praising them. Fake Nate admits that he's boring and knows it, but Nate said everyone has a superpower and one day they'd find Fake Nate's. Then Nate left the company, so Fake Nate ""borrowed"" Nate's life and was fascinating. Parker is in a warehouse vent, and Sophie gives Fake Nate a comm. Breana explains that they tracked Fake Nate's phone to a warehouse, and Parker went there to rescue Harry.

Fake Nate explains that he eventually caught up to Nate after Nate left IYS, and told him all about the crew. Fake Nate got laid off and needed the money, so he published the pieces of the stories he had. He explains that now they have to steal the Scarab, and Sophie tells him that they're getting Harry back and going home.

Parker sneaks into the warehouse and frees Harry. Breana checks and confirms that Navid was overthrown by democratic rebels. The only asset that wasn't seized was the Scarab, because it wasn't his. If Navid sells the Scarab, he can afford mercenary teams to take Zafir back. If they don't steal the Scarab, Navid will take it and reclaim his throne, and Sophie tells Parker to leave Harry where he is. Breana warns that the security around the Scarab is impenetrable, while Parker leaves her taser with Harry and leaves. Fake Nate wonders how they steal the Scarab, and everyone looks to him as ""the Mastermind"".

The party begins, and Sophie and Fake Nate watch from a distance and Sophie tells Fake Nate that they need him seen taking part in the con. Eliot goes in and Breana locates a room in the basement that is probably the security control room. She spots a hidden door going to it, and Sophie will go down and distract the guards, Eliot will watch the perimeter, and Parker will penetrate the pressurized case and steal the Scarab. Fake Nate remembers that IYS insures the Scarab, boring Breana to sleep. Sophie tells him that it's best that he stick as close as possible to his true self, and he figures that Sophie new to the crew. She says that she was Nate's wife, and it never came up in Fake Nate's conversations with Nate. Sophie approaches Liliana and claims she's a duchess, and introduces Fake Nate as her insurance agent, there to inspect the security.

In the warehouse, Harry drops the taser, warning his guard, Drago. Harry covers it, claiming he was trying to get some circulation in his limbs, and points out Navid has no money to pay his mercenaries.

Parker goes in posing as the decorator and takes some helium-filled balloons decorating the party into the room with the case. She tell Eliot that they need to clear out the room, and Eliot asks Liliana to speak to her in private. Intrigued, Liliana follows him into the nearby greenhouse, and he says that he's agent assigned to keep track of Navid. Eliot seduces Liliana, saying he was told to let Navid kill her but he's disobeying orders. He knocks out one of her bodyguards as the man approaches them, claims the man was one of Navid's killers, and tells Liliana that she should get the guests in one concentrated area so no one will try to kill her. Eliot tells Liliana that he'll be there if she needs him and walks away, and she does as Eliot said.

The guests gather in one spot outside, and Fake Nate tells Sophie that he doesn't know why Nate never mentioned her. Sophie tells him to stop, and she doesn't need him to feel sorry for her. She needs him to realize how much pain he's caused, and how little he really knew Nate, and then she needs him to stand watch, cancel his books so no one else gets hurts, and then disappear. Eliot arrives, and then Liliana arrives and pulls Sophie and Eliot over to the others.

Harry continues undermining Drago's confidence in Navid's ability to pay, and Drago says that they did a background check and confirmed Navid has $10 million. Harry offers to set Drago up with an IRA account.

Sophie tells Fake Nate over the coms that he'll have to distract the guards. He admits that he has no ability and bores people to sleep, and then he enters the security room, claims that he's with IYS, talks about the security specs, and bores the techs to sleep, while Breana helps by raising the room's temperature. Parker climbs across the sprinkler pipes which don't have security, overloads the sensor with helium from the balloon she's holding, and removes the Scarab.

Parker drops the balloon and sets off the alarm, waking up the techs in the security room. They spot Parker on the monitors and head to the room, and Sophie tells Fake Nate to leave. Eliot assures Liliana that the police are on the way, and walks off even though Liliana wants to kiss him. Parker joins up with Sophie and Eliot and shows them the Scarab, while Fake Nate gets out only to find Navid and his men waiting for him. They drive him away, and the team hears it all over the comms.

The team drives after Navid's limo, and Sophie has Fake Nate tell Navid that the Scarab will ""meet them"" at the warehouse, and they'll trade the Scarab for Harry. Sophie figures that they'll do what Nate would have done: walk directly into the fire

Navid and his men bring Fake Nate into the warehouse, and Drago brings Harry along. Sophie comes in and says that she's with Fake Nate, and Fake Nate says that Sophie is his co-mastermind and that's why she's not in the book. He figures that's why Nate never told her secrets and tells Navid as much. Sophie says that she has the Scarab and Navid takes it and tells Drago to kill them. Harry tells Drago that they have a bond, and Sophie tells Navid that it's the wrong form. Fake Nate takes the hint from their earlier conversation and starts talking about how Liliana used the wrong form because the Scarab is a fake. He breaks it on the floor, and Sophie adds that Liliana probably sold off the original years ago to fund her lifestyle.

Navid says that he's paid off the local authorities, and Sophie points out that some of Liliana's guests were with Interpol, which will be there in no time. Drago demands his money before killing anyone, and Navid discovers that there's no money in his Swiss bank account because Harry got the account number from Drago earlier, which Breana intercepted and drained the money. Sophie leaves with Harry and Fake Nate, while the mercenaries express their displeasure to Navid.

Back at the bar, the team confirms that Navid chose to be arrested rather than be killed by his own mercenaries. Some of the other crews want to use Fake Nate's ""superpower"". Sophie asks Fake Nate to sign her copy of the manuscript, and Fake Nate admits that he didn't know the book would hurt so many people, including Sophie. Sophie says that taking down Navid made up for anything Fake Nate did. and he signs it with his real name: Milton Friedlander. Sophie says that thanks to Milton, she got to pull one last job with Nate."

The librarian, Mr. Blanche, gives her one more book as a recommendation. Once Emma leaves, a man looking on, Maurice, comments on Blanche helping the girl and how Blanche gave him a book to read when he was Emma's age. Blanche has a heart attack and collapses, and Maurice goes to his side and have someone call 911.

At the bar, Harry is talking to his daughter Nicki on the phone as he comes in. As he hangs up the call, Sophie comes up behind Harry and they talk about the holidays with their loved ones gone are bad for them. They join the others having Christmas dinner, and someone knocks at the door. Eliot answers it, and finds Maurice there. Maurice says that he needs the team's help, and when they let him, Maurice explains how Blanche gave him refuge when he was a fifth-grader being chased by bullies. Tghen he says that Blanche has stage-four cancer and refuses to get treatment, and is having episodes with his heart. Sophie wonders how they can help, and Maurice explains that he wants them to make Blanche feel like a hero like the ones in his books, for one day.

Once Maurice leaves, Sophie tells the others that what Maurice is asking isn't what they do. Parker figures that lying to people during Christmas is what the holiday is about, and the others agree. Sophie finally gives in and says they have to treat Blanche like any other mark.

Later at the library, Breana and Eliot run surveillance on and Breana admires the library's ""antique"" computers. She gets a list of every book Blanche has checked out over the years and sends the list to the others at the bar. Meanwhile, a local tries to take out a homeless person and Blanche objects. When the local threatens to get violence, Eliot grabs his hand and tells him to leave. Once the local leaves, Blanche asks Eliot what he can do for him. Eliot leaves with Breana and a book, and figures they should give Blanche a spy adventure. Someone is running surveillance on Eliot.

Back at the bar, the team rehearses the parts in their spy drama, written by Sophie. Breana figures they need a safe word, and Sophie leaves it up to Eliot. Eliot goes back to the library pretending to be shot and tells Blanche that he needs his help. Blanche threatens to call the police, and Eliot tells Blanche that he's a spy, but was compromised, needs to get a thumb drive to his case worker, and asks Blanche to help him. Blanche agrees and Eliot takes the librarian out to his car, Blanche steals a nearby car because Eliot's enemies will know his car. At the bar, Breana thanks Sophie for doing it for them, and Sophie says that she's doing it for Nate, who would have hated it. She figures they all need a nudge out of their comfort zone.

Eliot says that he needs to send an encrypted message to his case officer, and needs to find a hacker on the dark web. He gives Blanche his phone with the GPS location, and Blanche tosses it out the window so no one can trace the phone. Blanche says that he learned how to hotwire a car from his misspent teen years, and says that it's the most alive he's felt in years. They go to a planetarium where Parker pretends to be a hacker, because Sophie needs Breana to be the real hacker. Blanche figures they should check to see if the drive has been wiped, and Breana realizes there's nothing on it except Eliot's secret chili recipe. Breana sends Parker the real file.

Blanche and Eliot go to the address on the drive, which is a wine & beer garden, to make the drop. Breana and Parker are in a food truck nearby monitoring the situation, and Parker serves cocoa. Sophie reviews the script for the ""big action scene"", complete with three of Eliot's soldier buddies as stuntmen. Harry is wearing an eyepatch and a fake mustache, and goes in to get the drive. Eliot gives Harry the drive, and Blanche notices the customers acting suspicious and punches Harry and unconscious, then tells Eliot that it's a setup. Sophie tells Eliot over the comms that Blanche is hooked and Eliot should go with it. Eliot does, and the stuntmen come in. Blanche does surprisingly well, but one of them tasers Eliot. The other stuntmen knock down Blanche and leave with Eliot.

Blanche recovers and steals a motorbike, and goes after the ""stuntmen"". Meanwhile, Parker and Breana realize the ""stuntmen"" aren't the men Eliot brought in, and go back to the bar to tell Sophie and Harry. They got the drop on Eliot's team, knocked them out and tied them up in their own van. Parker brings in Blanche's bag and discovers there's spy equipment in it, and they realize Blanche is actually a spy.

The RIZ thugs take Eliot to a secret lair where Bligh is waiting. She refuses to say who she's working for, has decrypted the drive, and knows it's not the real Ledger. She compliments Eliot on finding Copperhead and reactivating him, and asks where the real Ledger is. Eliot plays along, saying the Ledger is In his truck, and Bligh has one of her men inject Eliot with a psychotropic to get him to tell the truth.

Breana checks the DoD database and determine Blanche used to be a black-bag op, and 30 years ago he vanished... just when he became a librarian. Blanche comes in, aiming a gun at the team, and tells them that they should tell him who they are and what's going on.

Bligh tells Eliot that when Copperhead retired, he took a cache of information with him, about people who are now leaders of nations and want the information found. Nobody thought Copperhead was still alive until the team went after him, and people saw Blanche's picture. Bligh thought the team was running a con to get the Ledger, and wants to know where Copperhead is. Eliot says that he doesn't know and wouldn't talk if he did, and Bligh explains that the drug he was given will bombard him with his most traumatic memories. When she mentions the code name of an operation Eliot was a part of, he has PTAS.

The team tell Blanche what they were doing, and Harry points out that Eliot is missing. Blanche figures the men that attacked him were private security, but doesn't know the major players in the present. Sophie figures that it's RIZ, and Harry suggests Breana check the Flanders group, the shell corporation Breana confirms that they have office space in an office park outside of town. Blanche has slipped away, and Sophie realizes where he's heading. She refuses to let Blanche die of stage-four cancer on a mission they guilted him into, and Sophie tells Harry to stay there if Blanche comes back.

Bligh continues to taunt Eliot about how he avoids seeing his father, and says that she'll make the PTSD stop if he gives her Copperhead. Eliot recites his chili recipe, and Bligh tells her man to give Eliot another dose. Once Bligh leaves, Eliot breaks the chair he's tied to and takes out the RIZ guard, then leaves.

Outside in the truck, Breana confirms that the loading dock is the only way in. She remote-disables the camera on the dock, but warns that it will take time. They back the truck in instead, to block the camera, and Parker climbs onto the roof. Meanwhile, Blanche finds Eliot after taking out the remaining guards and takes him out. Parker joins them and gets them out the way she came in, and they take Eliot back to the bar and flushes his system with saline to get the psychotropic out. Eliot figures Bligh will keep coming until she gets the Ledger, and Blanche says the Ledger no longer exists because it got destroyed on his last op. Nobody would believe that, so Blanche ran, and hid as a small town librarian. Now the people Blanche knows will never be safe, and Sophie suggests they give RIZ a fake Ledger. Breana figures she can fake a dummy floppy disk to convince RIZ the data broke down over time. Harry says he can arrange the hand off, and he has way of getting into his old firm's holiday party. Parker has gotten a tuxedo for Harry, and not very convincingly claims that she bought it.

Harry and Sophie go to the party at a private club, and Sophie points out that he's still keeping secrets from the team. Blight comes over and introduces herself, invites Sophie to come to her with the signed auction, and tells Harry to stay behind.

Safer admits that sent the invitation to Harry, and has Harry's office waiting for him as he leaves.

Eliot and Blanche meet at the library, as Breana makes the fake disk out in the foot truck, and Blanche admits that he knows about ""Operation: Kansas"" that Blight was torturing Eliot with earlier. He figures it isn't easy for Eliot to keep it down, and Eliot wonders why Blanche isn't seeking treatment for his cancer. Blanche says that isn't how he wants to go out, and Eliot figures that Blanche sounds like his father, and says that he hasn't spoken to him since he was 18. He feels like he's waited too long, and Blanche sympathizes as the disk finishes. The power goes out, The three RIZ men go into the library, gun drawn, and Breana sets off the squibs in the books.

He says that Stella is getting forgetful in her old age and that's why he hired Antonio Alvarez, a nurse, for her, and part of what he's selling will cover Antonio's fee. Stella insists that she's fine by herself, but Phil reminds her that judge awarded him control of her care and her possessions. When Stella says that Phil is a stranger to her and robbing her blind, Phil acts offended and says her memory lapses are part of her problem. He has Antonio give Stella her meds, and she reluctantly tells them. Meanwhile, Phil tells her that she won't have to be confused in her big house much longer, because he's going to sell it and move her to a facility by the end of the week. Once Phil and Antonio walk away, Stella spits out the med and throws it away.

Sophie pulls up to Stella's house in a food truck, with Breana with her. Breana complains about having to do community service, and Sophie points out that Breana got caught stealing a watch from a councilman's brother, and Harry managed to get the charges reduced. Breana takes food up to Stella's front door and rings the bell, and Stella comes out. Stella pickpockets Breana's phone, and Sophie sees her doing so. They go inside, and Sophie follows them inside and tells Breana to check her pocket.

They go over to Stella, who is calling someone on the phone. She claims that she's a frail old lady and asks for a glass of water, and Breana goes to get it after taking her phone back. Sophie congratulates Stella on her style and asks what her name is, and the two of them bond over changing their identities so often. Breana goes through Stella's mail and announces her name, and Sophie asks Stella who she was trying to call. Stella says that she was calling for help because her legal guardian is stealing her home and her things. She explains that the court assigned Phil her legal guardian, and he took her phone and won't let her call anyone. Sophie says that they'll help her and realizes that Stella has things in her collection that she tries to get, but was beaten to them by ""The Jackal"". When Breana wonders who Stella is, Sophie tells her that Stella is the greatest grifter who ever lived. Stella says that she's meant to be there, and she fell in love with a mark. After a moment, Stella forgets who they are,

Antonio comes in and objects to the newcomers' presence, and threatens to call the cops. Sophie whispers to Stella that they'll be back, and leaves with Breana. They go back to the bar and Sophie tells the team about the Jackal, and was her inspiration. Sophie wonders why Stella is stuck in a house instead of living it up in the south of France. Eliot has checked with his contact in the police, who found Stella wandering outside confused because she has early-stage Alzheimer's. Breana has researched Phil, and confirmed that he gets appointed a guardian to senior citizens and then robs them, and dumps them in a cheap nursing home. Harry figures they need a durable power of attorney and then move her out of the house, but Sophie points out that Stella said she was ""meant"" to be in the house and wonders why. Breana suggests that Stella is waiting for someone, and Sophie tells Harry to get the guardianship papers and find out more about Phil. Sophie will speak to Stella and get more of her story.

Stella is at home watching TV with Antonio keeping an eye on her. Sophie comes in posing as Stella's new nurse, and Stella plays along while Sophie syncs Antonio's phone with Breana's computer. He calls Phil, and Breana intercepts the call and simulates Phil's voice. Eliot does the talking, and Antonio threatens to sue for breach of contract. Breana runs a background check on Antonio and confirms he has 87 unpaid parking tickets. Eliot threatens to tell the police about the tickets and hangs up, and a disgusted Antonio leaves.

Once Antonio leaves, Sophie discovers that Stella has slipped out. The team comes out and Breana goes into the house while the others search the neighborhood for Stella. Sophie figures Stella is going for coffee, and Breana finds the nearest coffee shop. Stella comes back in with a cup of coffee, and asks what Sophie's theatrics were about. They tells her that they're going to get Stella free from Phil, and Stella says that she has a durable power of attorney with the greatest score. She refuses to get it, and finally admits that she can't remember where she put it. Someone she loved signed the POA, but she can't remember them, either. All she knows is that they were happy there, and says she moved there because she was on a job nearby, and it's the same job where she fell in love with the mark. Breana takes Stella up to her bedroom.

When the others arrive, Sophie points out that the Jackal was more into the con than the coin, and never kept what she stole. The only stolen object that hasn't resurfaced is the 1902 Turlington Pistol, solid gold and made for Teddy Roosevelt. The gun isn't in the house and it hasn't gone on the black market. Eliot figures Phil still has it but doesn't know what he's got, and Harry has confirmed Phil has to file his weekly report with the court in an hour. Sophie and Breana will stay and try to get Stella to remember, while the others will use Phil to find the gun and the POA, and maybe find the person who signed the POA.

At the courthouse, Harry and Parker see Phil meet with Judge Linus Clark, who appointed Phil Stella's guardian. All of Phil's wards came from Clark and Clark is Phil's business partner. Parker starts yelling about the lousy food, and Phil comes over. Harry tells him that Parker is his sister and he's her guardian, and she's not ""stable"". The former lawyer says that Parker inherited half of their parents' estate, and Phil offers to help.

At Stella's house, Sophie laments to Breana that Stella will just fade away. She points out that Breana was good with Stella earlier, and figures Breana has had experience. Breana says that her grandmother had Alzheimer's, and Sophie tells Breana that she should take the lead on the job. Breana agrees and takes coffee to Stella, and says that she enjoyed a cup with ""Joe"". She talks about 1976 London and everyone was talking about a vault heist of $1 million in gold coins. Stella learned that a gangster named Earl pulled the job, and he spent most of his time in a pub. She went there, slipped into Earl's office, and found his safe.

Stella needed time to find the combination, so she got a job at the pub as a waitress. Stella loses his memories, and then goes to her bed. Breana tells Sophie that the bar owner and Earl's wife, Josephine, was the ""Joe"" that Stella fell in love with, and Josephine the POA.

Later at the bar, Breana packs some furniture for Parker and runs a background check on Clark. Phil's wards give ""donations"" to Clark's election campaign, and Sophie figures that they have to take Phil and Clark down, and recover the Pistol, before Phil puts Stella in a home. Harry realizes that Breana is giving Parker his stuff, and Breana and Sophie go back to Stella's house.

Parker and Eliot break into the warehouse where Phil has put ""Parker's stuff"" along with everything else he's taken. They search for the Pistol.

Sophie and Breana arrive at Stella' house, and find her looking wistfully at a photo of her and Josephine. They get to talking about the London job, and Earl and his men come in and he tells his wife that he won the Pistol in a card game. He points the Pistol at Josephine, then puts it down and laughs at the ""joke"". He has his wife take the Pistol up to his office, and Stella goes with her to put the ""big bills"" from the register in the safe. Josephine opens the safe and Stella uses a mirror in the box to see two of the four numbers in the combination. Stella says that Earl should treat Josephine with more respect, and Josephine says she doesn't care as long as Earl lets her run the pub the way she wants.

Stella stays close to Josephine in the pub, and sees Josephine glares at Earl as he flirts with another woman. The two women go out to lunch the next day, and Josephine picks a museum for them to go to. She tells Stella that she used to be an art student, but then she met Earl who chatted her up. They both about how they chase ""the next big score"" when all they want is someone to sit with. Josephine admits that it's been a long time since she had a friend, and Stella says that she's not used to people being nice for no reason.

Despite slowly becoming more than friends with Josephine, Stella doesn't want Josephine to know who she really is. She slowly works to get the last two numbers on the safe, and Earl goes to France with his men to sell a shipment. Stella asks Josephine what Earl is selling, and sees a bruise on Josephine's face. It isn't the first one Stella has seen, and shows Josephine Earl's car keys that she pickpocketed. They go for a spin, pull over, and kiss. They go back to the pub and Josephine shows Stella the first painting she's painted in years. It's a portrait of Stella, and Stella tells Jo that it's perfect, and so is Jo.

Later, a beaten Jo tells Stella that Earl said they had to go to Italy to lay low. Jo told her husband that she wanted to stay there with Stella, so Stella has to go before Earl arrives, and she'll go with him. Stella says they should go somewhere, and Jo writes down the safe combination and tells Stella to get the money so they can run away using it, and she'll meet her in the car. Stella figures that if she took the coins, Earl would hunt them and Jo would know she was a thief, so she walked away with nothing but the Pistol. They drove away ahead of Earl, came to New Orleans, and settled down. Then they discovered that Jo was pregnant with Earl's child, became a family of three, and eventually got married. The couple signed POAs and Earl tracked them down when they filed the paperwork.

Stella abruptly ends her story, refusing to talk about it further. She tells Sophie and Breana to get out, and they go back to the bar and tell Harry what happened. Harry figures they need to come up with a reason for Stella to want to help them. Parker and Eliot come in and say they didn't find the Pistol, and Parker saw Phil keep a gold watch for himself even though he told Clark he'd give it to him.

The next day, Sophie goes back to the house and finds Breana sitting with Stella on the porch. Sophie apologies for pushing Stella, and says they think they know how to get the Pistol back and get rid of Phil for good. However, they need the Jackal to do one last job.

At the courthouse, Stella approaches Phil and tells him to walk with her. Eliot poses as a food delivery man and brings a sandwich Clark didn't order to Clark, takes his cell phone, and puts a tap on it. Meanwhile, Stella offers to split the Pistol's sale with Phil. Clark overhears them talking, while Sophie comes over as Stella's nurse and leads Stella off. The judge confronts Phil and says that Phil didn't show him the Pistol, and wants his cut of the gun. If Phil doesn't pay him 90%, their deal is off.

Sophie takes Stella to the bar, and Parker has listened in on Clark's phone and learned they're going to sell the Pistol that night. All they have to do is capture the sale on camera and then Eliot does his job. Breana says that the fence Jean-Pierre is paranoid, and they won't have time to set up a camera. Eliot tells Sophie that if their plan doesn't work, she'll have to find Jo and Sophie says that she'll try.

Once the others leave, Stella tells Sophie that if she finds the POA, she'll find Jo. Sophie tells Stella that it could be her second chance, and asks what happened when Earl showed up.

In the past, Earl pours drinks and calls Stella a ""degenerate"". Stella asks him what he wants, and Earl says that he wants the Pistol and his money. Jo comes in and says that no one stole anything, and Earl says that he asked around and learned Stella is a thief, the Jackal, and she set Jo up. Earl tells them that they have until midnight to get his money and his gun, says that otherwise he'll take their daughter, and leaves.

Breana joins Sophie and Stella, and Stella explains that Earl had all the power.

In the past, Jo asks Stella why she didn't tell her the truth. Stella says that she thought Jo would hate her, and Jo asks if any of it was real. When Stella points out that they've never cracked despite all they've been through, Jo wonders what they do. Stella takes the Pistol and tells Jo that she'll finish it alone. Jo leaves with their daughter, and Stella tells Jo that she'll find them later. Come midnight, Earl returns and Stella tells him that she never got into the safe and took his coins. He says that the coins were in a hidden compartment in the car's trunk, and Stella tells him that they dumped the car eight years ago. Stella tells him to just take the Pistol, but Earl starts strangling Stella. Stella grabs the discarded Pistol and shoots Earl dead.

In the present, Stella tells Sophie that was the last night she saw Jo. Sophie asks Stella if she would have left with Jo if she knew it was going to end, and Stella realizes that Sophie lost someone. She says that she had some of her greatest adventures after Jo, and live is a journey. Harry comes in and says that Phil and Clark have gone to the warehouse.

At the warehouse, Phil shows Clark the Pistol. Stella comes in, says that the Pistol is hers, and takes it. Sophie comes in as the nurse and tells Stella that she's having one of her ""turns"", and Phil takes the Pistol's case but discovers the Pistol is no longer inside it. Clark takes the Pistol from Sophie's bag and gives it to Phil. As Sophie and Stella leave, Jean-Pierre and his bodyguard come in. Jean-Pierre examines the Pistol and points out that it's a fake, and the police pull up outside and tell Phil and Clark to surrender. The fence admits he called in the police, after Parker asked him to and offered him a ""personal favor"". Sophie and Stella switch the real Pistol for a fake. The police take Phil and Linus away, while Stella and Sophie watch. Sophie is thrilled to have pulled off a job with the Jackal. Jean-Pierre comes out and confirms there's no POA in the case.

Back at Stella's house, Stella tells Sophie that she'll need a proper home no matter what. Sophie suggests Stella could go live with Jo, and Sophie figures that Stella isn't telling her the truth about what happened after Earl died. Stella says that Jo came back and shot Earl, and Stella kept the gun in case she ever needed to take the blame. The older woman doesn't remember what she did with Earl's body, and she didn't want to burden Jo and her daughter with her presence. Sophie realizes that the POA is hidden in Jo's painting of Stella,

That night at the bar, Harry tells Stella and Sophie that Stella's daughter didn't hesitate to take over the POA. Stella worries about her seeing her daughter and what she'll think of Stella, and Sophie says that Nate was her greatest score and she'd give anything for one more day with him... and now Stella has that chance with her daughter. Stella thanks Sophie for everything and they go to see Jo and their daughter.

As the family hugs, Harry asks Sophie what she's thinking. She says that she's wondering what her next adventure will be, and Harry takes Sophie to get some coffee. The two of them walk off together arm in arm."

His assistant Mai translates, and he tells them to focus on the nails rather than the customers. Mai slaps one of them on Carl's orders, and he threatens to send them back to Vietnam. He tells them they don't get any calls home to their family unless they improve, and Mai collects their phones. Carl's supplier, Frank Dupree, notices that one woman's son, Bao, is missing. Carl asks Bao's mother where Bao is, and she glances outside.

Going outside, Carl finds Bao in the back alley using his clubs and making good shots. Carl tells Bao to go again, and Bao lands another shot. The owner tells Bao that he's been holding out on him, and offers to ""introduce"" Bao to the American Dream.

At the bar, the team returns from a successful job and a depressed Harry pours himself a drink. The others make sure to congratulate him on his part, and he tells Sophie that he almost screwed up his job. Hurly comes in and greets Harry as a disgraced former lawyer. He cheerfully greets the others, who are glad to see him. Eliot says that Hardison drug Breana off to a code camp, and Parker tells Harry that Hurley works on their crews all over the world. Hurley sways that he's on a stopover and wanted to play golf with Eliot.

Sophie remembers that Harry is a member of a golf club, and Harry offers to get Eliot and Hurley in as his guests. They go to the club and Harry suggests they bet on winning the holes. Hurley is will, but Eliot tries to cut Harry off. Hurley admits that he's in recovery and shouldn't be gambling, and they tee off. Harry loses his ball in the weeds, and while looking for it spots Carl playing at the next hole. He misses his shot and loses the game, and convinces his opponent to play the next game double or nothing. Carl then gets a call from Frank, saying he's gotten Carl's delivery and wants the cash up front. Carl agrees and Harry overhears the conversation. Once the call is over, Carl goes over to his caddy Bao and tells him no mistakes or Bao will pay.

Once Carl leaves, Harry goes over to Bao and introduces himself, and claims he and Carl are old friends. Bao excuses himself, and Harry goes back to Eliot and Hurley and tells them what happened. They figure Bao is a ringer, and Carl deliberately lost and will convince his opponent to let Bao play in in his place when Carl pretends to have thrown his back out. Harry figures Bao is scared and needs their help, and Hurley and Harry both figure Carl is up to something. Eliot is on his day off and would rather play golf. Harry confirms Carl's lawyer is Rick Saffron, who's legit, and Harry tells Hurley that he'll break into Saffron's office and figure out what's going on, and then find the evidence to set Bao free from Carl. Hurley figures the ""golf con"" is on, much to Eliot's disgust.

Later back at the clubhouse, Hurley confirms that Carl is in the bar with his opponent and mark, Travis Pomaville, Hurley uses reverse psychology to convince Eliot to help, and Eliot says that he'll bring Hurley in as his ringer when Carl brings Bao in. Eliot poses as a rich drunk to get Carl's attention, and tells Hurley to get him the cash.

Harry goes to Saffron's office, and worries over the comms to Eliot that he's in over his head. Eliot tells him that he called the job and has to see it through, and goes to flirt with a cashier. Harry uses Parker's lessons to break into Saffron's office. Meanwhile, Eliot convinces the cashier, Jennifer, to tell him when Carl's next tee time is. He gets the name of who he's pretending to be, Travis, while Hurley poses as a waiter and lifts a guest's money clip.

Harry gets into Saffron's office, works out the lawyer's computer password, fails, and finally calls Saffron at his home, poses as IT, and gets Saffron to tell him his password. Harry confirms Saffron has nothing on Carl in the firm's main servers, so it must be bad. Sarah Nichols comes into Saffron's office and mistakes Harry for Saffron, and Harry plays along. The woman introduces herself as the new associate and tests her law knowledge. Harry then convinces Sarah to use her keycard to let him into the file room so he can check Carl's old files, and talks about how the firm's clients are all crooked. Sarah says that a lawyer in her hometown took her case pro bono against a crooked realtor and saved her dog when it was falsely accused, and Harry says that Sarah reminds him of his daughter.

Finding Carl's files, Harry takes the box, thanks Sarah for her help, and leaves. Suspicious, she has a friend send her a photo of all the firm's lawyers from a wedding the previous year. Meanwhile, Harry goes back to Saffron's office and goes through the records, and finds out he's using his business including the nail salons to launder money. He tells Eliot, who offers backup. Harry notices Sarah outside in the hallway, while Hurley comes over and shows Eliot the money's he's stolen.

Travis is nearby having a drink with Carl, and gets a call from Sophie posing as his doctor. She tells him that his colonoscopy results aren't positive and then puts him on hold. Travis wanders off while waiting, and Eliot hooks Carl into playing a game of golf with him. Carl figures that Eliot would beat him and challenges him to darts, and Eliot accepts.

Outside, Hurley ""accidentally"" bumps into Travis and commends that Travis looks pale. Hurley then goes over to where Bao is inspecting Carl's clubs, and Bao talks about his mother back in Vietnam couldn't afford clubs for him so he got some from lost-and-found. Hurley tells Bao that he can help him and Bao quickly excuses himself to find Carl.

Harry takes Sarah to the Carl's salon for a ""spa day"" and says he's going around the back to make a phone call. Sarah draws her mace spray on Harry and demands to know who he really is, and he tells Sarah his real name and he's trying to stop Carl's deal, and figures the police won't help if he goes to them. She wonders what kind of lawyer Larry was, and Harry says that he was a good lawyer until bad clients chipped away at him, and Sarah shouldn't let that happen to her. He asks Sarah to help him, and Sarah asks Harry to tell him everything he knows.

Carl and Eliot play darts and Eliot wins, and Carl figures he's a hustler. Eliot says that he's an investor who likes to spend money, and gives Carl his (fake) business card. After Eliot leaves, Carl checks his fake name on his phone Internet and finds that Eliot is an investor that burned through his daddy's money. Carl goes out and Bao tells him that he just saw Travis leave. Eliot and his ""caddy"" Hurley pull up in a golf cart, and Carl suggests that they play for money.

Harry and Sarah break into the salon's storage room where there's a safe, and they figure Carl's laundered money is in the safe. Bao's mother Tien comes out to throw the garbage in the dumpster, here's a passing police siren, and quickly ducks back inside. The lawyers figure Tien is undocumented, and Carl has her documents in the safe... and he's a human trafficker. Harry calls Sophie and tells her. She's posing as a mourning widow, and Sophie tells Harry to make a plan and trust himself... and play it by ear when things go off the rails. Sophie signs off to distract a padre while Parker breaks in.

Harry calls Eliot and tells him that if they're going to bring Carl down, they need Bao on their side. Eliot has Hurley tell Bao that Tien saw Bao play and win golf, and brought him with her to the U.S. hoping his skills could get him a scholarship. Bao says that if he doesn't win for Carl, Carl will send Tien away and never see her again. Hurley says that they can set Bao and Tien both free, but they need Bao's help. Bao says that he can't risk it and walks away.

The golf game begins and Carl says that his business is human capital, and it's never going away. Eliot makes a bad shot and Carl laughs, and Eliot admits to Hurley that the bad shot wasn't intentional, and he hasn't played for a while. Hurley warns that if Eliot doesn't start winning, Carl might not bring in Bao and Eliot tells Hurley that he's got it.

In his care, Harry tells Sarah to go in, pretend to be a customer, and make a distraction while he breaks in the back and empty the safe. Sarah wonders what happens to Carl, who is just a link in the chain. Harry admits that it's imperfect justice, but it's all they have to work with. Sarah figures that it's not justice at all, but it's all they have to work with.

Carl finishes a call to Frank, and Hurley tells Bao that his teammate is at the salon and going to get Tien's and the others' passports. Bao tells Hurley to leave him alone, and Hurley tells Eliot that he's got it. Eliot messes up his next shot.

Sarah tells Harry that she can't do it, and Harry repeats what Sophie told him earlier about humans being hardwired to trust. Encouraged, Sarah goes in.

Hurley tells Eliot that they're back in business if Eliot can birdy the next three shots, but Eliot isn't convinced. Figuring that Eliot thrives on chaos, Hurley insults Eliot's chili and posts a photo of him online cooking and wearing an apron. Eliot loses his temper and his game improves, He continues tormenting Eliot and Eliot keeps making his shots.

In the salon, Sarah demands to speak to a supervisor. Mai comes out and Sarah claims that someone stole her watch.

Carl fake-throws his back out and suggests Bao play for him. Eliot agrees if Hurley can play for him and they double the stakes, and Carl agrees. Hurley panics at the thoughts of gambling, and starts cracking.

Harry breaks into the safe, fails, and calls Eliot. Eliot is busy with Hurley, so Harry calls Parker. She's in the middle of her job, but he didn't bring a drill with him. After Parker signs up, Harry looks for a drill or a bomb.

Bao sinks the putt, and Eliot tells him that the Hurley he knows is only addicted to wiping the smile off of Carl's face. Hurley makes the shot, and Carl admits that he doesn't have the money to pay up on him. He offers to get the money from the safe in his nearby salon, and Eliot agrees but asks to ""keep"" Bao as collateral. Bao goes with Carl, and Eliot tells Harry that Carl's on the move. Harry has rigged up a charge, but holds the switch as Mai comes in and aims her gun at him. He explains that he rigged a bomb out of salon supplies.

Carl comes in and Mai tells him that Harry has a bomb. The trafficker figures Harry is bluffing, Harry is bluffing, and Carl tells Mia to shoot Harry as a burglar. Saffron comes in, having gotten a text that sad hackers were trying to get at his legal files and he should come right away. Frank comes in, and Harry says that they texted Frank to bring the ""merch"" there, using Carl's phone that he gave to Bao at the course, who gave it to Hurley who sent the texts to saffron and Frank.

Police sirens approach, and Harry tells Carl that he's busted. Sarah comes in with her mace spray and says that she called the FBI rather than the locals Carl has paid off. Saffron tries to run, and Sarah sprays him with mace. Out in the salon, Eliot and Hurley arrive, and Eliot takes out the guard. Frank comes out, sees what's happening, and goes for his gun. Eliot drives a golf ball into his groin. The FBI open the safe and get the papers when they arrive, and take Carl and his partners away. Bao gives Tien her papers, and Harry tells Sarah that a witness in a Federal case if safe from deportation, and the Federal case could take months. The others will need a good lawyer, and Sarah smiles and goes over to them.

As Harry, Hurley, and Eliot leave with Bao, they give Bao the money that Eliot won playing darts against Carl. One of the players there is the head golf coach at LSU, and wants to give BAO a golf scholarship. As Bao goes over to the coach, Eliot says that he's the one who said they should have taken the case from the beginning. They don't remember it that way, and they all go to play a round of golf.

A policeman, Jim Abel, comes up in front of the man and punches him. Abel's partner Boggs joins him, and they tell Selina to give them the phone. They drag Selina below the dock and beat him. Finally Boggs holds Abel back when he goes too far, but not before he beats Selina unconscious. Boggs calls in a medvac,

Two weeks later at the bar, Sophie and Harry return and Sophie complains that they should have finished the job a week ago, but were delayed by Hurricane Esme slamming the Gulf. Breanna I got out on a plane just ahead of the storm, heading to a comic convention. Harry hasn't heard anything from Parker and Eliot yet.

Parker and Eliot are stuck on the Beacon Inn on Greenbeach Isle, and Eliot tells Parker that he called for backup. It's Maria, who calls him back. Maria cuts off, and the two teammates go in to dry off. Eliot figures that since the job is over, He's not worried about giving away any secrets to Maria. Boggs, comes over and wonders where they came from, Boggs glares at them and says that they're closed, and an older man limps up and says that Boggs can't leave people outside in a storm. After a moment, Boggs tells Eliot and Parker to wait in the bar. As Boggs' fellow cop Collins comes up and whispers in Boggs' ear, Eliot tells Parker that the two men are cops.

The older man, McCloud, goes with the teammates and introduces himself. There are other cops in the halls, and McCloud tells Parker and Eliot that he owns the hotel. Roxie, Jimenez the hotel manager, is working the bar, and greets the teammates despite her obvious misgiving about them being there. Roxie goes to get the partners towels, and Eliot figures McCloud is overrun and there are cops on every floor. Another cop, Abel, comes up and greets them and Parker tells Abel that they're siblings who were on a fishing trip. Eliot asks why there are so many people there, and Abel says that he and the others are there to secure the hotel. McCloud sits down and reads a newspaper article about a winning $230 lottery ticket that hasn't been claimed.

Boggs comes in, and as Roxie come in with the towel, Boggs tells her that he'll have to check out the rooms again. When McCloud tries to intervene, Boggs tells him that they got it. Parker stages a fight with Eliot, feigning being drunk, and stumbles back into Abel, lifting his wallet. They go to the kitchen to get her something to eat, and Parker tosses Abel's wallet to Eliot. Abel's name is in on his ID, and Parker says that Abel smells like cleaning supplies. She calls Sophie but the cell service is down, and the landlines are down because the cops took them out. Eliot tells Parker to get a walkie, and she says they have one problem.

Maria arrives at the hotel and Boggs tells her that they're closed. She brushes past Boggs, and Abel joins them and draws his gun but keeps it behind his back. Parker reminds Eliot that he already called for backup, and Eliot goes over, hugs, Maria, and tells her to keep her badge hidden. He tells Boggs that Maria is his friend and came to get them off the island, and takes her to get dried off. Once they're alone, Abel angrily tells Boggs that he told him not to let anyone in, and Boggs should lock the trio in the bar.

Later, Roxie confirms that they're locked in and McCloud tries to reassure her. Eliot tells Maria that the cop have taken over the hotel. He wonders if Maria can get them all off in her boat, and she warns that the swells are too high for anyone to leave. Parker comes over and says that the walkies are short range and she can't modify them. Maria introduces herself, and Eliot asks McCloud and Roxie about the cops. Roxie says that they're from Greenbeach, and they just showed up saying they came to help. Parker and Eliot figure the cops are looking for something, and they're using the hurricane as cover to hide it. McCloud confirms that he has an old ham radio in the boathouse, but they'll have to go outside to get to it. Maria insists on going with Eliot to get it, and Parker gives Maria her comm and says she'll distract the guard while they slip out. McCloud directs them to the freezer, which has a loading door to the outside.

Eliot and Maria go out through the freezer to the boathouse, and they talk about Eliot seeming happy with Maria. He quickly ends the conversation by finding the radio which Maria knows how to work. Meanwhile at the bar, Harry still can't raise a signal to Parker and Eliot. Eliot reaches them on the radio via the analog system that Breanna has been working on. Sophie responds and Eliot tells her what's going on.

Abel tells Collins to check the boathouse,

Sophie uses Breanna's laptop to get more intel on Abel, while Harry calls his contact in the police union.

Eliot apologizes to Maria for getting her into a situation, and she tells him not to bother because the people need help and he's helping them, and that's what she likes best about him. Harry calls back and says that Abel was recently suspended for beating Selina, and it happened two weeks ago. Selina was medvacced to a nearby hospital, and Harry goes to check it out while Sophie mans the radio.

Collins comes into the boathouse, and Eliot and Maria hide. He finds the radio and Sophie saying that Harry went to the hospital, and Eliot emerges from the shadows and fights Collins. Collins grabs a spear gun, and Maria hits him over the head with board. The spear gun goes off and Eliot dodges the spear, but it cuts a line which swings a boat into Eliot, and knocks him into the radio, breaking it. The impact dislocates Eliot's arm. Maria draws her gun on Collins, and Eliot questions Collins on what Abel is up to. Collins finally cracks and tells them that Abel got suspended for beating Solina, an ex-con drug dealer. The cop crew ran drugs and Solina blackmailed them, and Solina had proof on his phone but it wasn't there when they caught up to him. They figure Solina hid the phone in the hotel, and that's what they're looking for. Eliot ""borrows"" Maria's gun, takes out the clip, and knocks Collins out with the gun.

Abel calls Collins on the walkie, and isn't fooled when Eliot tries to impersonate Collins. He goes to the bar and asks Parker where the other two are. Parker still feigns being drunk, and complains about her ""brother"". Abel goes to the kitchen and finds Eliot and Maria kissing. Abel tells them to stay in the bar with others and they go, and Bogs has another cop check the boathouse and confirm there's been signs of a struggle and no sign of Collins. Abel figures someone else is in the hotel, and Boggs the others to be on watch for an intruder.

Eliot has McCloud check the radio, and McCloud says he might be able to fix it with fuses and there's a spare in the electrical room. Parker goes to get it, while Maria bangs Eliot's shoulder back into place. Eliot admits that he's done some things he can't take back, and Maria tells him that he can't live like he's to blame for bad things happening to good people.

Parker gets to the electrical room, gets the fuse, and smells the same cleaning chemical she smelled on Abel. She hides when Abel and Boggs come in looking for the phone. Boggs says that things are getting out of hand now that they have hostages, and Abel figures one of the other cops are messing with them. When Boggs questions him, Abel admits that they're all implicated and they have to stick together and he's got it covered how they're going to keep everything quiet.

Harry goes to the hospital and finds the injured Solina under police guard. Harry tells the receptionist that he's a lawyer, but she points out that he isn't Solina's lawyer, who already checked in. She leaves to help a patient, and Harry gives Sophie the name of Solina's lawyer, Jackie Dumont. Sophie recognizes Dumont as a lottery lawyer and tries to call her teammates.

At the hotel, Parker gets back to the bar. Maria goes over to Roxie and identifies herself as a U.S. Marshal. Parker found an invoice signed by Roxie, with the last name Solina, and realizes that Omar is Roxie's brother. Roxie breaks into tears. Roxie insists that Omar wasn't involved with drugs, and work with at-risk youths. Omar gave her the phone and Roxie hid it.

McCloud finishes repairing the radio, and Sophie tells them about the lawyer. Eliot figures the winning ticket is in the phone case, and Abel plans to steal it and tells the other cops that the phone has blackmail material, and the cop at the hospital with Omar is in league with Abel. Sophie tells Roxie that they'll do everything they can to keep Omar safe, and Parker realizes that Abel smells like accelerant, not cleaning chemicals, and he plans to burn down the hotel and everyone in in it to cover his tracks. Roxie says that she hid the phone in the lighthouse, even though it's unstable.

Parker goes to the boathouse and gets nautical line. Maria, McCloud, and Roxie leave the bar with the radio, and Eliot shuts off the lights and the backup generator at the fuse box. Abel figures that it's their saboteur and one cop, Daniels, goes to the bar to check on the prisoners while Boggs and the others go to the electrical room. Daniels finds Maria in the kitchen and she says that the others are gone. He checks and makes sure, figures McCloud won't make it far, and leads Maria out.

Boggs and his men find Eliot, who tells them that Boggs is running them. The cops turn on the lights and leave with Eliot. Meanwhile, the cop at the hospital prepares to move Omar. Sophie tells Harry to improvise, and he poses as a doctor and tells the cop that he needs to run one more test on Omar in Radiology. Harry takes Omar out on a gurney, while the cop confirms with the receptionist that Omar is ready to go. The cop catches up to Harry and takes the cloth-covered gurney. Harry has Solina nearby, while the cop takes ""Omar"" to the ambulance, prepares to shoot him, and discovers Harry has put a CPR dummy on the gurney.

Parker uses the line to climb up to the lighthouse. Meanwhile, Daniels brings Maria into the room where Boggs has brought Elliot, and has both of them sit down. Eliot tells the cops that Abel was going to take the ticket for himself and kill them all. Abel says that he was going to tell them about the ticket once they got it, and then punches Eliot in the face to shut him up. Boggs goes for his gun and draws on Abel, who draws his gun and aims it at Boggs.

Parker finds the phone case and the ticket inside, but accidentally turns on the light, alerting the cops. Her line blows off in the storm, and the cops on guard warn Abel over the radio. Abel figures that it was a distraction while Parker got the ticket, and sends the guards up to get her. He says that they'll split the money evenly, and Boggs lowers his gun. Abel says that they'll soon they'll have ""his"" ticket, and Eliot points out his slip. Abel punches him again, while Parker fights the two guards as they come up into the lighthouse.

Eliot continues undermining Abel's men, and Abel prepares to punch Eliot again but Boggs stops Abel and asks why Abel didn't tell him about the ticket. Abel finally tells Boggs that he's weak and is letting Eliot get to him. Meanwhile, Eliot and Maria work at their zip ties with blades that they smuggled in. Maria says that Abel's words are a good confession, and the two prisoners break free and take down the cops. Abel runs and Eliot tackles him, while Boggs jumps Maria when she takes his smart gun that won't fire for her. He grabs her throat and chokes her, and Parker arrives and knocks Boggs out from behind, while Eliot knocks out Abel.

Maria calls in her people to take in Abel and the others, and Parker admits that she likes Maria. Roxie confirms that Omar is safe, and Parker gives Roxie the ticket to give to Omar. The next day, Eliot asks Maria not to mention him and Parker on her report. Maria asks Eliot who he works for and then says that she doesn't care, and figures that he's good no matter how bad he thinks he is, and that's good enough for her. Eliot holds Maria and they look out to sea.

Later at the bar, Harry tells the others what they did. Maria calls Eliot and confirms that Boogs is going to testify against the others. Sophie and Harry go to get a refill, and Parker admits to Eliot that Maria did all right. She's worried that Eliot will want to leave the team to be with Maria, and she can't do it without Eliot. Eliot tells her that's never going to happen and puts arm around her."

James worries about how they'll make it, and Leon assures him that his grandfather got through worse they will get through it. Leon gets a call and goes inside to take it, and men with baseball bats approach James as he loads up his truck and hit James, then tell him they don't want ""his kind"" around there. The others beat James, and Leon comes over and fires a shotgun blast into the air to scare the attackers off. Leon runs to the unconscious James and holds him in his arms.

Later at the bar, Eliot brings Leon and James in, since he's buys some of his food from them. James talks about how Leon's family farm is a legacy, and Leon talks about how half of their crops I the last year have suffered the blight. Eliot promises that he'll find the attackers, and they recently had bloodwork done showing they're being poisoned. If the couple doesn't figure out what's going on, they'll lose everything.

Later, Parker takes James and Leon to a hotel, while the others review an identity of the attackers WIM--White Identity Movement--web site. Breanna says that the WIM men have a train at their disposal, and brings up an aerial satellite photo of the farm. The area of the blight goes beyond the farm boundaries, and there's a burial site near where the train tracks end on the property. The parish hasn't tested the site yet, and Harry suggests that it's cobalt poisoning, based on his knowledge from one of his firm's previous cases. Blake Whitcomb owns the land the tracks run on, and is big in the green energy game and runs his business from his private train car. The train runs on renewables, and Breanna reports that he has plans for electrical planes. There's a big review in Detroit that weekend.

Parker parachutes in and says she took the fat way back, and confirms that one of the paintings in the video the team are watching was bought because of the appropriate size to conceal a safe, not the value of the painting. She's eager to rob Whitcomb's train, and Sophie figures that the poisoning from the train is related to Whitcomb. Sophie suggests that the3 poisoning is unintentional or someone could be trying to frame Whitcomb, and Breanna determines the car is hooked up to a train and going to leave in 30 minutes. Eliot insists on going to the farm with Harr and finding out what' buried there, while the others go to the train.

At the station, Parker steals a ticket from a passerby so she can board the train with the others. They avoid a party of bachelorettes and go to the back of the train where Whitcomb's car is hooked up, and discover that his meeting there and he has one of the HIM men, Karl as a bodyguard.

Eliot and Harry arrive at the farm, and figure the couple calling for the parish to run the soil sample, and the HIM attacking them immediately thereafter, is connected. Sophie has a cover for Parker, and Breanna goes to set up mobile communication in a forward car. Harry has a testing kit and a bailout bag in the back of his car, and he insists that he's just prepared.

Breanna goes over the passenger manifest and finds one woman, Emily Woo, who is an engineer for Whitcomb's company. Emily headed the design team for the plane's body, which is why she's along. Emily is nervous about the launch according to the company's message board, Sophie overhears Whitcomb talking about his home as the ""eagle's nest"", and tells Breanna over the comms to set her up as German royalty.

Senator Jefferson Gwynette approaches Sophie and hits on her, and Sophie puts on a German accent as Breanna sets up Sophie's German royalty background. She has Gwynette introduce her to Whitcomb, while Parker poses as a conductor and takes tickets. Emily wants to talk to Whitcomb about the plans, but he brushes her off and talks to Sophie. Whitcomb is entranced by Sophie, who is taken aback by his enthusiasm. Karl runs a check on his phone on Sophie and finds Breanna's fake background, and nods to Whitcomb in approval. Meanwhile, Breanna gets into the patent files and brings up everything that Whitcomb has ever filed.

Harry and Eliot reach the burial site and Harry runs some tests on the soil, and figures the site is heavily contaminated with heavy metals. He and Eliot put on Harry's protective suits that he brought along.

Sophie and Whitcomb share a toast, and Sophie convinces Whitcomb to take her into an adjoining private car. Parker joins Breanna, who can't find the plans in the patent filings. The thief figures that the airplane plans are in the painting safe, along with the evidence of what is being dumped at the safe, and just smiles when Breanna wonders how she's going to get by Whitcomb's security precautions.

Whitcomb shows Sophie around his private car filled with German memorabilia, and Sophie spots the painting while trying to fend Whitcomb off. The battery is on a table, but he says that she'll see it in action when the train gets to Detroit where it's going. Whitcomb boasts that the battery will him make him millions, and with that he and his investors will put the world back in ""order"".

Sophie tells Whitcomb that the European Union plans to put electrical airplanes into place within ten years, and she wants to be ahead of the curve, and return Europe to its former glory. Whitcomb agrees and kisses Sophie on the cheek. She puts Whitcomb off when he tries to kiss her more firmly, and takes Whitcomb back to the party. Parker drops in through a roof hatch and starts breaking into the safe.

Harry and Eliot dig up the site and Harry asks Eliot if he thought Harry would last long. Eliot admits that he didn't think so at first, and then asks Harry how far he wants to go. He tells Harry that Harry stared his past in the face and kept digging, and Harry could be a part of team the long-term.

Parker opens the safe and discovers that it's empty, then figures that the car is off-balance. Harry figures she can tell because of the taste, and tells the others that they found batteries at the burial site. Whitcomb is dumping the batteries, but they're corroded and leaking. Breanna explains that electrical batteries have to be carefully recycled or they leak cobalt. The cobalt got into the ground water and poisoned the couple, and Breanna figures that the ""junk batteries"" will never fly a plane, and he's using the fake batteries to get investors so he can eventually make the plane. Meanwhile he's using the HIM to cover up what he's doing at the farm, Eliot and Harry plan to take some of the evidence with them, and Sophie tells Breanna to come in.

Sophie goes over to where Whitcomb is talking with Emily, and convinced him to let Emily get her some coffee. Once Emily goes, Whitcomb says he has some people he wants to introduce Sophie to and he'll go get them. Sophie tells Breanna to either take Emily down, or tell her the truth and Emily joins their side. Emily notices that Breanna has tree-planting drones on her tablet, and comes over to talk to Breanna about it. Breanna invites Emily to sit with her. Sophie tells Breanna to use her feelings to seduce Emily, and Whitcomb introduces a foreign Secretary to Sophie, preventing her from giving Breanna more advice.

Emily tells Breanna that her boss developed the batteries in a separate building away from her, and she wants to make the world a better place but it feels like she's being sidelined. Breanna tells Emily that it sounds like she's talking herself out of her instincts. Sophie, who has been listening in, figure Emily is a ""true believer"" and Breanna should show her the truth about the batteries. Parker goes to take control of the train just in case, but she has to go through the bachelorette party to get to the engine. She discovers that their Canadian Mounties, not bachelorettes.

Harry wonders what the big deal is about Mounties, and Eliot tells Harry that the Mounties are the most feared law enforcement agency in the world. Parker says that all of them are wanted by the Mounties, and if they put them down they will put them down forever. All of the team is wanted in Canada, and the Mounties never forget a face. Breanna confirms that the train's final destination is Canada, giving the Mounties jurisdiction.

The HIM spot Harry and Eliot walking back down the road with the batteries.

Emily tells Breanna that she has to go back to the party and invites Breanna to come with her. Sophie tells Breanna that it's the opening they need and to go, and Breanna agrees. Meanwhile, Sophie overhears Karl telling Whitcomb that his men have spotted Harry and Eliot at the site. Whitcomb tells his men to burn the farm down, and kill anyone in the way. Sophie overhears the conversation and warns Eliot, and Eliot heads for the farm to protect it.

Breanna and Emily arrive at the party, and Breanna asks Emily if there's somewhere they can privately to talk. Emily agrees and introduces Breanna to Whitcomb, and asks if she can show Breanna some of her equipment. Whitcomb jokingly tells Emily not to sell any state secrets.

Eliot and Harry get back to the farm, and Eliot tells Harry to get the batteries to the authorities while he deals with the HIM. After Harry drives off, the HIM men arrive

Karl lets Emily and Breanna into the private car and Breanna starts breaking open the paneling to find what Parker thought was there. There are standard batteries hidden inside, and Breanna explains Whitcomb's scam to Emily. She tells Emily that Whitcomb lied to Emily, and shows her a photo of the dump site. Breanna asks for Emily's help, but Emily warns that if she exposes Whitcomb than her dream of electric flight dies. Whitcomb comes in and see the exposed batteries.

Eliot asks any of the HIM men if they served, anyone but themselves. Harry drives back and hits one with his car, and Eliot attacks the others. Harry hits the last one standing, who is preparing to torch the farm with a flamethrower. The blow doesn't knock the man down and he goes for Harry, and Eliot knocks the man out from behind. Harry throws up from getting into his first fight.

Whitcomb calls for Karl, and Sophie and the rest of the party guests come in instead. She lured him to the next car and Parker kicked him off the train. Whitcomb insists that everything's fine, and Sophie asks him to show them the battery right away. With them from some prodding from Breanna, Emily demonstrates that the battery is a fraud and Sophie says that Whitcomb is a fraud. Emily confesses everything, and Whitcomb insists that the battery is just the presentational model and they're working on the real thing. When Sophie says that he's a fraud, Whitcomb says that she knows nothing and Gwynette points out that Whitcomb has been saying that Sophie is an expert. Emily says that her team built the plane and Whitcomb just sold it. Sophie tells them the guests that Emily is the one who can build them a plane, while Whitcomb is a conman and a thief.

When Whitcomb runs out, Sophie reminds him that he's on a moving train. He keeps running... right into the car with the Mounties. Parker hits the emergency brakes, throwing Whitcomb at the feet of the Mounties. The Mounties have received a tip about Whitcomb from Harry about Whitcomb smuggling toxic waste across the border, and Sophie, Breanna, and Parker gloat from the door window.

Later, everyone gathers at the farm and Eliot prepares the food. Breanna apologizes to Emily, who is happy with how things turned out. The two of them kiss and then join the others to eat. Eliot says that they cut off the HIM funding by taking down Whitcomb, and ""someone"" sent their phone numbers to the FBI. Whitcomb had to liquidate his personal funds to finance his Canadian legal morass, and clean up the waste. One of their contacts bought Whitcomb's train and is selling off the parts to private collectors, and the resulting money is going back to the farm. Parker complains that they didn't hold up the train, so she suggests they do it another time. However, Sophie points out that she bought the safe painting, so technically she stole it. They share a toast to the farm."

However, a man in the bushes grabs her Becky stomps on his foot and breaks free, and then runs. The man gets into his car and drives off, swerves to avoid the boy as he steps out in front of him, and hits a parked car, knocking himself out on the driver's wheel. Becky goes back inside and gets her mother Grace and her step husband Ethan, and Ethan calls 911.

The next day at the bar, Harry comes in with the mail and finds Eliot refurbishing the walls because of Parker and Becky crashing things into them constantly. One letter is forwarded from one of Eliot's aliases, and one for Sophie from a London theater offering her the position of director there. Parker and Becky come in from training, and Parker storms off when she hears Sophie describing the offer. Sophie figures the team can function without her like they did before she came out of retirement.

As Sophie walks off to call London and Becky follows her, there's a knock at the door. It's Becky, Harry's daughter, who says that she needs Harry's help. They talk privately and Becky explains that she tracked Harry by the tracker he put on her phone. She explains that someone is trying to hurt their family and someone is coming after Ethan. Ethan says that it's no big deal, refuses to call the police, and says that he'll handle it himself. Becky doesn't think Ethan is taking the matter seriously, bur Becky isn't convinced and asks Harry to help his ex-wife and her like he helps other people.

Harry asks the team to help Ethan, an oil company CEO, and Parker and Breanna refuse. The ex-lawyer says that Ethan is a good guy, and was brought in to help clean up an oil spill. Sophie points out that Ethan doesn't fit the4 profile of their usual clients, and Harry insists that Ethan is good people. Harry figures that Ethan isn't taking it seriously enough and won't hire his own security, and finally tells the team that Ethan is married to his ex-wife Grace. The ex-lawyer says that Ethan's opponents are going after his family, but Breanna still refuses and walks off. Sophie says that the rest of them are in. Parker and Sophie tease Eliot about Maria when Parker offers to check at the hospital where Breanna's attempted abductor is, and Harry figures he and Sophie will hack the security around the house using the binders that Hardison left.

At the hospital, Parker, Eliot, and Maria go in and Maria says that the abductor is refusing to talk to the police and has no ID on him. Maria gets them in past security and is amused that Eliot won't tell her why they want to talk to the abductor, kisses him, and leaves.

At the bar, Breanna ignore Harry and Sophie's failed attempts to hack the security. When Harry bungles it and turns off the bar generator, Breanna walks off in disgust,.

Eliot and Parker go into the abductor's rooms, and find two people posing as cops trying to kill the abductor. The team mates attack them and they run off, and a suited man--James Lowe--and the abductor Jerry Vanton's grandson Damon come in. the man says that he's asked the abductor not to do the work, again and again. Lowe talks to Parker and Eliot privately, and explains that he's a lawyer pursuing a lawsuit pro bono against Ethan's oil company, and Vanton keeps getting involved for free. Vanton's granddaughter Sarah has leukemia, and the doctors figure Sarah got the leukemia from benzene exposure, and benzene is found in crude oil. The company's oil platform was damaged three months ago and Ethan's company GulfPetrol covered it up, with Ethan providing the PR. The platform, Hyperion, is still leaking. Lowe is representing Sarah, and the oil is still leaking but GP denies that it's theirs. Lowe needs ironclad evidence that the oil is GP's, and Vanton is trying to help Lowe get the proof. If Lowe wins his case, there'll be hundreds of other suits against GP.

Eliot and Parker return to the bar and find the generator still out. Breanna boots everything back up and says she's no longer on strike now that they know Ethan is the bad guy. Vanton's brake lines were sabotaged, and Mitchell, Nathan & Cupp is representing GP and has all of the evidence that would prove GP is responsible for the oil leak. They've booked the largest conference room in the city. Harry goes to confront Ethan, while Sophie has Breanna get her access to the conference room..

Harry approaches Ethan and Grace at the golf club where they're having lunch, ""accidentally"" bumps into Grace, and asks about the incident at the house. Ethan joins them, and Parker is posing as a waitress and steals Ethan's phone. Harry brings up Sarah's lawsuit, and Ethan says that Sarah needs the money but GP is innocent. Meanwhile, Parker sends the phone signal to Breanna, who is trying to get into the conference room with Sophie. Ethan uses the phone as an electronic key for everything he's involved with, and Breanna confirms there's military encryption on the phone. Breanna tells Parker to stall, and Parker stalls by carding Harry and slipping the phone back when Breanna is done.

Sophie and Breanna go into the conference room using the cloned phone, and Sophie claims that she's an efficiency expert and Breanna is her assistant, and the managing partner at the firm sent her. She tells the lead counsel, Chandis Peterson, that she's not ""efficient"".

At the club, Ethan jokingly tells Harry that because of him, Harry doesn't have to pay alimony or child support. Before he leaves, Harry asks Ethan if he's sure the oil isn't coming from Hyperion, and Ethan insists that they're not. Meanwhile, Sophie inspects the files, and Breanna take photos of them with a hidden camera. Later back at the bar, the team have takeout and Breanna says that she ran the numbers on the files and they're tampered with. The raw data could be anywhere, and Eliot says that they should get it from Hyperion. Harry isn't happy that Ethan lied to him, and wants to take him down.

Eliot figures that he, Parker, and Breanna will go on Hyperion to get the data, and physically bring it back. The oil platform has banned all electronics, so they have to bring back the data physically. Hyperion is 120 miles off the Louisiana coast, and the data they need is on the drill floor. Parker will pose as a medic, intercept the incoming crew, and send them to the infirmary. Eliot will pose as a roughneck, take the crew's place on the drilling floor, and get the data. Parker will go the control room and distract the one tech on duty with a medical inspection, Breanna will hack into the primary data systems, and Eliot will stand watch while covered in oil. Then they fake an illness to get them on the first helicopter out. Sophie and Harry will stall the trial until they get the data to Lowe, before Ethan testifies.

Harry has gone to Ethan's house and looks at it from across the street. Sophie finds Harry there and Harry points out that he's going to hurt the people he loves most, by taking down Ethan. She points out that Grace and Becky deserve to know the kind of man Ethan is. Harry admits that he justified what he did by never breaking the law, and used it as a guideline. Sophie tells him that life is complicated, and she calibrated her morality"" by believing there was honor among thieves.

On Hyperion, the trio board with the new crew. Maria calls Eliot and suggests they go out for dinner the next night. Eliot says that he's on a ""business trip"" and claims he's making a smoothie when she hears the helicopter in the background. Maria says that it's what she signed up for and says that they'll talk when he gets back. The security guard takes Eliot's cell phone before he boards.

Harry approaches Grace as she's out jogging.

Eliot talks to Parker privately about his relationship issues, based on her experience with Hardison. She advises Eliot against lying, Parker figures that Hardison is the first person who really saw her, and Eliot has to let Maria see the real him. If she doesn't want Eliot, then Parker says she'll hang her up the edge of a building until she smartens up.

Sophie goes back to the conference room, and Peterson tells her that since the plaintiffs have shown a lack of evidence showing GP is responsible for the spill, the law firm is meeting with the judge to have him toss the case.

Harry starts to tell Grace about Ethan. Grace says that she loves Ethan. Before Harry can respond, Sophie calls and tells him about the case being dismissed. Ethan is at the courthouse, and Harry excuses himself and goes to the courthouse.

Breanna tells Eliot that she's found the data collection console. Eliot is called to the control room, where he's told that he has a personal call by satellite phone. It's Sophie, who says she's his wife and ""the baby"" I coming early, because the techs are monitoring the call. Breanna is listening as well, and picks up the real intent of the message. The trio get back together and work how to speed up their plan, and that Breanna will rig up the sat phone as a dial-up modem and send the data. Eliot goes to the collection part, but finds no one there except the main operator, who says that there was something wrong about Eliot's earlier call and there are some people who want to talk to Eliot.

Outside the courtroom, Harry and Sophie meet with Lowe and tell him that they have to delay. Lowe warns that they need proof of intention or malfeasance, Sophie goes to Peterson to buy them some time.

The operator takes Eliot to a room, and techs have a surprise party made for Eliot's baby shower. The operator insists that Eliot stay, and gets him a beer. Breanna comes in, and tells Eliot to make sure everyone stay there while she accesses the data.

Parker goes to the control room to do her ""medical checks"", and finds everyone going to the baby shower. One tech is staying on duty, and Parker says that he looks exhausted and has to give him an exam.

In the courtroom, Peterson tells Sophie that they saved GP $10 million. Sophie asks Peterson if there's anything else Peterson wants to report to the court, but is paranoid and tells her to team to go through everything and see if they missed something, and asks for 10 more minutes before the judge delivers his ruling.

Parker tells tech that he has a highly contagious flu and is going to have to isolate. Once he leaves, Breanna comes in with the thumb drive and tells Parker that they have to rewire the place to send the data back.

Ethan comes into the courtroom at the same time as Judge Lundry comes in. Peterson presents the motion to dismiss, and Harry speaks up from the back and says that it's a toxic tort case and the judge has jurisdiction, based on an obscure case. Lundry dismisses Peterson's motion to dismiss, and tells Harry to call his first witness.

Parker and Breanna finish rewiring the control room, but Breanna says that the two sets of data match because GP cooked the data as it came in, and they can't get the raw data in time. Parker access the cameras that monitor every inch of Hyperion.

Harry questions Ethan, as Grace comes in. Ethan asks Harry if he's trying to get revenge on him for marrying Harry's ex, and then testifies that his lawyer told him he couldn't write a check to Sarah, because it could be interpreted as admitting guilt. Parker calls Sophie and tells her that they have the uplink working, and emails the data to Harry. Harry then shows the court the video of the oil leaking, and Ethan says that the video was illegally acquired , and Peterson tells him to shut up. Lundry says that the evidence isn't admissible, until can be independently verified and investigated.

Ethan and Peterson leave, and Sophie tells Lowe that GP won't be able to hide its activities anymore. Harry assures Larry that there'll be enough evidence for Sarah and all the other class action victims, then goes to Grace as she leaves. She tells Harry that she's not leaving Ethan because he was just doing his job, to provide for her and Becky. Harry is astonished, and Grace tells him that Ethan is there for him and he's there, which is more than Harry ever was. Harry starts to say that he made a lot of mistakes, and Grace tells him that they're done and walks off.

That night at the bar, Eliot is pouring drinks and Parker says that Harry has moved out. Sophie tells the others that things didn't work out for Harry as he hoped, and says that they should give him some time. Parker says that the job was better than running a theater in London, and Eliot asks Sophie if she really plans on leaving. Sophie says that she needs to find out the person she's going to be.

Breanna comes in and shows the others a newscast of a fire on Hyperion. The techs are among those dead, and Sophie figures that GP blew up Hyperion to cover their tracks. The team wondered who gave up the inside information necessary.

Harry meets with Bligh of RIZ and offers his services. Bligh asks why Harry decides to work for RIZ, and he says that he's decided to calibrate his thinking about morality."

Eliot is watching the news, and the men that he worked with who died when the oil rig exploded. Parker is watching with Eliot, and says that the funeral of the five men was that day. Sophie hasn't heard from Harry, and Eliot points out that Ethan blew up the oil rig and killed five innocent men, just to win a court case. He asks what they're going to do to Ethan, and Sophie points out that if Ethan ""mysteriously"" dies, they don't get to prove what he did, and nobody gets a penny.

Breanna joins them and says that Ethan used a computer worm to cause the explosion, and the worm overheated the worm drills. She found traces of the worm in the data they scraped from the rig, but it doesn't prove who did it. If they can find the source code of who used the worm, they can prove they're guilty. Eliot figures that someone is helping Ethan, and Breanna says that it's RIZ. Bligh arrived at RIZ's New Orleans office during the trial, and they have a huge cybersecurity department. Sophie tells Breanna to pull up the specs on RIZ's office building in New Orleans, and Eliot tells Breanna to take her time and do it right.

Two months later at the RIZ office, Sophie walks into the lobby posing as a cybersecurity expert. Eliot has already infiltrated the building posing as a security guard, and he summons the lobby elevator with Parker hiding on top. She switches to a car going up and heads to the server room, while Eliot goes to the security surveillance room and takes over from the guard there. Once he's alone, Eliot accesses the cameras. Breanna is outside in a food truck, and directs Sophie to the cybersecurity administrator's office where any incriminating emails will be.

While an aide takes Sophie to the conference room, Parker gets to the server room and Eliot can't bypass Blight's security. Picking the electronic lock, Parker goes in while Breanna overrides the motion sensors. Sophie goes to the ladies' room. The aide, Eugene, says that due to the new protocols, he has to wait nearby. Sophie wonders why Blight is increasing security after she committed the crime, Parker gets into the server room, but finds a glass door blocking her path, that isn't on the specs. Meanwhile, Sophie breaks into the security office but finds that's it's empty. She turns to find another aide behind her, and says that she's there to meet the cyberteam. The aide says that Blight has moved all the equipment up to the 20th floor,

The guard returns to the surveillance room and demands to see Eliot's new badge. Eliot doesn't have one, and knocks the guard out. Another guard approaches Parker, who takes his taser and knocks him out with it. Blight is in the hallway, and Sophie quickly turns her back and walks away only to run into Harry. He ignores Sophie and goes to Bligh.

The team gets out and goes back to the bar, and Breanna confirms that Harry started working for RIZ two days after Ethan's trial ended. They figure Harry went back to being ""evil"", and Sophie wonders why Harry let her go. Parker doesn't believe Harry might be trying to help them, and tells Sophie that not everyone can be saved. Sophie finally says that they should go ""steal"" Harry and find out what he knows.

The team goes to a power substation, and Parker and Eliot go in disguised as workers. Sophie tells them over the comms to bring Harry back in one piece. Breanna blanks the cameras covering their path, but realizes it was harder than it should have been and someone else is in the system. Eliot and Parker see Harry talking to Ethan, and they listen as Harry tells Ethan he was sent there to make sure no one figures what Ethan is up to. Ethan insists that it's his project and he's not going to let Harry take any of his credit, and Harry points out that he's spent the last eight months with a crew that took people like Ethan apart, and he knows a lot about security. Ethan hands over the security protocols and storms off,

Harry sees Eliot and Parker approaching him and runs. They easily catch him, and Breanna warns them that someone else is fighting her. Harry tells his former teammates to get out before it happens, and the alarms go off. Breanna recognizes the code and who is responsible. A security team arrives, and Eliot throws Harry to the floor, then fights the team with Parker. Hardison arrives and knocks out the last guard from behind, and tells Harry to come with him. The four of them run out, and Hardison says the alarm is to cover up his hardware taps. Hardison gives the security controls to Breanna and kills the alarms, and has her kill the motion sensors so they can get out. Parker kisses Hardison.

The team regroups at the bar, and Eliot complains that Hardison kept them out of the loop. Harry explains that he couldn't reach out to the team without compromising them, so he reached out to Hardison instead. Hardison and Harry talked via paper to avoid RIZ's electronic surveillance of Harry, and Hardison talked Harry through hacking the RIZ servers. They confirmed that Ethan worked for RIZ ten years ago, and they maneuvered Ethan into position at GP. The rig explosion was intended to prove that RIZ could shut down the US power grid, to show that they could and sell it to the highest bidder.

Sophie talks to Harry privately and asks him why he did what he did. Harry says that he thought he had to dig into RIZ on his own, and his guilt drove him when he misjudged the situation with Grace and Ethan, and almost got Parker, Breanna, and Eliot killed. Harry wasn't going to let guilty destroy Sophie's ""family"" like it destroyed his. Sophie says that they're family because they learned they can't go it alone and to ask for help, and Harry asks her to help him finish it. Sophie agrees but figures they'd better give the others some time to resolve their issues.

Parker assures Hardison that they don't have any issues to resolve, and Eliot insists that he's not upset. Hardison shakes hands with him and they hug, and Sophie and Harry come back and Hardison explains that RIZ is performing a supply chain hack to plant the worm, and RIZ owns the subsidiary companies. With Hardison's help, Harry has got evidence that RIZ owns dozens of the subsidiary companies, and guys like Ethan protect the companies. RIZ has access to all the government computers, and they blew up the rig to convince their potential buyers they have the access. If they cause a blackout, they prove they can get into any system anywhere. RIZ is going to bring down the US power grid, and Harry's stolen emails aren't enough to do more than cause a minor scandal. They need the worm source code to prove RIZ is the mastermind. The code is on one server 24 floors up with no connection to the outside. Hardison figures if he could install the hardwire taps on the substation, he could grab the code before RIZ wiped it from the server. Only the Feds have the necessary backdoor access, and Eliot says he knows someone who can give them the access. The backdoor has to be opened at the substation and the RIZ server, so Harry will have to go back in undercover. Sophie says that she's done and Parker should run the team, and Harry goes back to his position.

Eliot meets Maria outside a hotel, and she gives him a thumb drive with the Federal codes for the power grid. Before she hands it over, Maria asks Eliot why she should give him something that would end her career. Eliot says that the rig explosion was him and his team failing to stop it, and his team work outside the law. He tells Maria that they used to be criminals, and they've worked off the books for the government. Eliot insists that they're the good guys, and Maria believes him. Maria won't cross the line to be with a criminal despite her feelings for him, and walks off after giving him the drive.

That night, Blight goes to see Harry in his office and admires his new, handcrafted wooden desk. She says that they need to do something about his old partners, and she'll deal with them later that night after the blackout RIZ is causing. Bligh says that they'll lose power for only 60 seconds before the backup generators kick in, tells him that everyone will be taken care of that night, and leaves.

Later, Harry goes to the auditorium where Bligh is with the prospective buyers, as Ethan prepares for his presentation. Ethan demands to know why Harry is there, and Harry says that he's just double-checking the servers. Harry goes to the server room to open the back door at that end. Sophie and Breanna are in the food truck outside the substation, and Sophie tells Breanna that they'll have to trust Harry to do his job, because they can't communicate. Hardison, Parker, and Eliot are inside and tell a worker that they're an inspection task force. They reach the panel, and Eliot talks about how let his guard down with Maria. Hardison and Parker assure him that he opened himself up. Hardison accesses the back door, but the connection is interrupted and Bligh comes in with her security team and tells Harry that the team's weakness is loyalty. The trio in the substation run when they realize they've been made, while Bligh tells Harry that loyalty made them predictable. Bligh takes Harry's phone and has her men take Harry to his office, and lock him in. Bligh tells Harry that her men scoured his office and found the files, and the digital copies he made. Without the code, Harry has nothing.

The others meet in the food truck and Breanna plays back the audio from Harry's office. Breanna says that they should break into the server room and steal the code, even though Bligh knows they're coming, and pull an hour's worth of data off the server, as well as rescue Harry, all before the blackout.

Ethan gives his presentation to the buyers, and Sophie comes in. Bligh walks out and Sophie goes with her, and they go to a nearby conference room. Sophie offers to let RIZ go if Bligh cancels her scheme, hands over Ethan and release Harry, and Bligh figures that Sophie is a distraction.

Eliot walks into one of the building's five street-level points of entry, then runs off after making sure the guards spot him. More guards intercept him, and Eliot fights them. two more guards arrive.

Bligh figures Parker is getting into Harry's office to free him, while Breanna goes to the server.

A figure enters the server room.

The blackout begins throughout the city, and the buyers watch from the window. Bligh tells Sophie that it's too late, and the five street-level exits locked down, along with the server door. The power to the server shut off, so Breanna can't steal the code. Sophie just smiles, and Bligh tells her she's not getting out of the building alive. Bligh starts counting down from 60 seconds when the power comes back up, and Sophie says that she decided to use the blackout when it disabled the security systems in the building.

Eliot fights the guards in the dark.

Breanna climbs through the vents to Harry's office

One of the guards Eliot first attacked was Hardison in disguise, and Hardison slipped into the server room before the door locked.

Bligh figures that Hardison didn't have enough time to download the code from the server, and they have all the information Harry stole. Sophie tells Bligh that she allowed Harry to order the custom desk,

Harry opens the secret compartment in the desk, with paper copies of everything he stole.

Bligh tries to call security, but the phones are dead due to the blackout. She points out that Harry still has to make it out the building, and Sophie points out that only the street-level entrances are sealed.

Breanna opens the locked door, and she and Harry to go to the server room. Parker breaks in through the room's window, and Breanna calls up a drone to haul the whole server with the code on it. As the drone flies off with the server, the rest of the team drop down to the street on zip lines.

Sophie tells Bligh that the whole thing would have been impossible... if Bligh hadn't engineered the blackout. Bligh points out that Sophie still in the building, and as the lights come up Sophie notes that Eliot has been in the dark for 60 seconds. Eliot comes in with an unconscious guard, and escorts Sophie out.

Bligh goes to the auditorium to check with Ethan. Eliot, Sophie, and Harry come in. Eliot ignores Ethan, but Harry punches Ethan in the jaw.

Back at the bar, Eliot serves food for a celebratory dinner. Breanna sends emails to the RIZ people secretly working at the subsidiary companies, suggesting they make donations to the families of the dead men or they'll rat them out to law enforcement. However, she's going to double-cross them once they donate $10 million. Hardison used the code to spell out RIZ's name in lit windows on building, meaning that RIZ can't cover up that they caused the blackout.

Hardison says that he might stick around for a while, while Harry calls his daughter. She tells Harry that Ethan went to the FBI to confess and go into witsec and they're going after Bligh. His daughter also wants to move in with Harry, and says that he's done conning, but is going to go back to being a lawyer and helping people in need.

Sophie walks Harry out, and Harry tells her that they were both lost in grief when they first met. She saw that and helped him, and Sophie says that Harry helped her and he sees her as she could be and she's going to miss that. Sophie kisses Harry on the cheek and wishes him luck, calling him ""Harry"" instead of ""Mr. Wilson"" for the first time. Harry leaves, and Sophie takes off her wedding ring and goes back to the others.

Sophie tells the team that it wasn't her final performance, and the jobs are her stage. Parker is happy to let Sophie lead the team, and won't miss the paperwork. The team gives Sophie all of the paperwork and walks out."

Trina's upset that her partner for the annual showcase at Hollywood Arts High School is André Harris (Leon Thomas) (referred to in this episode as Andrew by Trina), a 10th grader. She knows that there are going to be important talent scouts and musical industry workers at the show, which is making her nervous as she really wants to impress them. Trina kicks Ian out and insists that her sister helps her and André with the song that she'll perform (Make It Shine). While working together, Tori and André form a friendship despite Trina driving them insane, and André awes Tori with his talent as he sits down at the piano and plays a little tune.

Trina about to sing Make It Shine. And Trina's upset that her partner for the annual showcase at Hollywood Arts High School is André Harris (referred to in this episode as Andrew by Trina), a 10th grader. She knows that there are going to be important talent scouts and musical industry workers at the show, which is making her nervous as she really wants to impress them. Trina kicks Ian out and insists that her sister helps her and André with the song that she'll perform (Make It Shine). While working together, Tori and André form a friendship despite Trina driving them insane, and André awes Tori with his talent as he sits down at the piano and plays his tune. Outside the front porch, André is calling his grandma, When Tori comes by and asks him who he is calling. He says that his grandma will be attending the Big Showcase. André then explains that it is the first time that his grandma has left the house in 6 years.

Tori skips school to attend the showcase with her parents. The family is called backstage before the performance starts, only to discover that Trina's tongue has swollen up because she was allergic to an herb gargle that she drank, which she said was to help her sing better. The guidance counselor, Lane Alexander, who is a very calm and sensible man, asks if anybody can take Trina's place. André assumes that Tori can because she'd heard the song numerous times during rehearsals throughout the week. At first, Tori refuses, but André forces her to, so she slips on a fancy dress and gets on stage. Realizing that she has nothing to lose in front of a crowd of strangers, Tori decides to sing.

Her top-notch performance surprises the audience, and even herself. Principal Eikner takes Tori and her parents backstage and offers Tori a once-in-a-lifetime chance to attend the elite performing arts high school. Tori doesn't think that she's talented enough, but after watching such a strong performance, André believes otherwise. He pulls up the curtain and asks the audience if Tori should join them, to which they all chant, ""Yes!"" After a moment, Tori accepts the offer. Tori and Trina enter Hollywood Arts. During her first day at Hollywood Arts, Tori gets lost and meets Robbie Shapiro, a shy boy who often speaks through his ventriloquist dummy, Rex. Tori also meets Cat Valentine (Ariana Grande), a hyper and happy, but sensitive girl who is easily upset, often shouting, ""What's that supposed to mean!?"" when she feels offended.

Robbie (Matt Bennett) (through Rex) gives Tori directions to her first class with Mr. Sikowitz, and when Tori enters the classroom, she accidentally bumps into Beck Oliver, spilling his coffee on his shirt. Tori then rubs the coffee off of his shirt. When Beck's short-tempered and overprotective girlfriend, Jade West, walks in, she becomes mad at Tori for rubbing her boyfriend, which in her books is a flirtatious move.

Tori is introduced to Sikowitz to whom she gives $2 to after mistaking him for a homeless person.

During an improvisation exercise, Sikowitz asks Jade to choose four other students to act with. She chooses Cat, Beck, Tori, and Eli. He asks Robbie to pick a setting, and he chooses 'home.' And André chooses 'big news,' as the situation. Just before they begin, Jade asks Tori to go and wait in the hallway.

The scene starts with Beck (Avan Jogian)(the husband) getting fired from his job, and Cat and Eli (the kids) complaining about this situation. Jade tries to cheer them up by telling them that she got them a new dog, and Tori enters and gets onto the stage. At first, Tori did not play the proper way of a dog, but then Jade told Sikowitz (Eric Lange) to tell Tori to act like a real dog. Tori then does so. Jade claims that dogs usually have fleas and ticks in their fur, and schemingly tells the kids that coffee is a good way to get them out. Beck and André tried to warn her to not do it, but Jade pours an entire cup of coffee on Tori's head, as revenge for 'flirting' with her boyfriend.

Embarrassed and upset, Tori runs from the room and attempts to call her mother, Holly Vega, hoping that she can take her out of the school. André meets up with Tori in the hallway and takes her phone from her. Tori feels that she should simply give up, and face the fact that she isn't unique at all. André then tells her that everybody is unique and special in their own way, and dissuades her from walking away because of Jade.

At home, Tori is watching the video of her performing at the Big Showcase. Trina then comes over, convincing her to stay at the school. Tori does not want to come back though. Trina tells Tori that she actually liked Tori's performance, which Tori thanks, but then chimes in to say that if she would've performed, she would've been amazing.

On Tori's second day at Hollywood Arts, Tori is chosen to pick the actors for a game of Alphabet Improv. She picks André, Cat, Beck, and Jade. During the game, Jade and Tori are fighting (but they follow the rules) while the other actors are out. Beck also fainted, which left Jade and Tori for most of the game. Tori tries her best to push Jade hard enough to get out of the game, until Jade gets eliminated. Beck wakes up again, and tries to make Beck feel better by kissing him, as Tori gets her revenge on Jade by kissing Beck, which is the start of Jade and Tori's rivalry for. (see: Jori)."

Beck (Avan Jogia) and Jade (Elizabeth Gillies) come by and learn of Tori and Daniel's past, as well as the fact that he is now dating Cat (Arians Grande). Jade finds this incredibly amusing and makes subtle digs at Tori. Awkwardness abounds as Tori tells Cat the truth about her and Daniel. Cat, though surprised, is assured by both of them that she shouldn't feel bad about dating Daniel as he and Tori seem to be completely over each other.

The next day, Danny appears during lunch at the Asphalt Café. Jade brings up the Kickback, a Saturday night party at Hollywood Arts. Tori starts to become jealous of Cat and Danny's relationship after the two make plans to go to the Kickback together, much to Jade's amusement. Tori is further annoyed when Cat presents Danny with brownies she has baked. He enjoys Cat's desserts immensely, despite the fact that he told Tori while they were dating that he didn't like brownies after Tori had presented him with ones she had made. Tori leaves the table with a brownie in her mouth. Later, the students partying at the Kickback: Sikowitz (Eric Lange) is barbecuing mysterious, shady sausages on his car, Danny and Cat are dancing together, and André is getting attention for his smooth feet. Beck and Jade feel André's feet and are impressed, expressing the desire to *ahem* follow in his footsteps. Tori has fun until she spots Danny and Cat kissing by the hot cheese fountain. In the heat of the moment, she overreacts by pressing the fountain valve, spraying hot cheese on them. After realizing what she did, Tori runs off, humiliated, and is later found in the auditorium by Beck and Jade. They question her about the cheese fountain debacle but Tori doesn't understand why she acted the way she did. Tori goes to see Cat and Danny, who are getting cleaned up in the nurse's office. As she apologizes to Danny, he wonders if Tori is jealous of him and Cat dating even though she was the one who broke up with him. Danny wonders if Tori still has feelings for him, but she insists she is happy for Cat and struggles to understand her behavior. Their discussion gets out of hand as Danny and Tori kiss. Cat catches them and is shocked at first, before she begins to cry and runs off. Tori (and Danny) feel even more guilty for hurting her friend. Over the next few days, Tori keeps trying to find Cat in order to explain herself and apologize, but Cat avoids her. Tori finally sees Cat at school and ends up chasing her down and dragging her into the janitor's closet in order to get her to listen. Tori finally apologizes and admits that what she did was wrong. Tori reveals her actions weren't because she still had feelings for Danny but rather because she felt jealous that he and Cat looked so happy together compared to how the two of them had been a year ago. A hurt Cat understands but points out that Tori could've simply discussed her feelings with her instead of acting out. Tori agrees and says, ""If I were you, I'd punch me right in the face."" Cat takes this too literally, actually punching Tori in the face, but she and Tori make up, as Tori believes that she deserved it. Cat takes Tori to the hospital, where the nurse (Rae Latt) realizes her nose is bruised badly and she has to be X-Rayed.

The subplot of the episode focuses on Trina's newly smooth feet that many of her fellow students are eager to feel, and Robbie wonders what's happening. He later goes to the Vegas' house and discovers that Trina (Daniella Monet) is using exotic Pooka Fish to nibble away the dead skin on her feet, making them smooth. Robbie eventually uses them to treat his feet as well, paying Trina for it. Robbie (Matt Bennett) is now also getting attention at school for his smooth feet, and André (Leon Thomas) wants his feet smoothed as well. André also gets the treatment at the Vegas' house. Beck and Jade soon get their feet ""smoothed"" as well.

As Tori is awaiting her X-Ray, she and Cat discover that everyone who got their feet ""smoothed"" are in the hospital. The doctor overseeing their treatment tells Tori and Cat that they've contracted Myroleticulitus, a virus that attacks the nervous system from the fish saliva, which is toxic and full of bacteria. Trina later reveals that she bought the illegal pooka fish from a guy in a van. The doctor gets angered at Trina for using pooka fish for her feet smoothening until he feels Trina's foot at her suggestion. The doctor and nurses, however, agree that everyone's feet are, in fact, very smooth. As Tori, Cat, the doctor, and the nurses feel each of the feet, Trina is shown vomiting inside a plastic bucket the hospital gave her at the end of the episode."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1627875/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,Cat and Jade get banned from a karaoke bar. Tori nurses Trina after her wisdom teeth are removed. Tori leaves the boys to take care of Trina.,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family', 'Music', 'Romance']",TV-G,Release date,['Steve Hoefer'],[''],[],"['reference to american dad', 'blood', ""reference to chloe's closet"", 'wisdom teeth surgery', 'medicine', 'tired', 'laughing gas', 'tape over mouth', 'black man white woman romance', 'tied feet']",[],"While trying to do a photo shoot at home with their dad's new camera, Trina (Daniella Monet) answers Tori's phone when the school's hottie, Mark McCallan, calls to ask Tori out. Since Tori was washing her hair, Trina tells him Tori has plans, but that she is hotter and free on Friday, so he asks Trina to play glow-in-the-dark mini golf on Friday night instead. When Tori (Victoria Justice) finds out, she gets mad and tries to bludgeon Trina with their dad's new camera stand until he intervenes. He tells Trina that she won't be able to go out Friday night because she's getting her wisdom teeth out on Friday afternoon. Tori laughs and dances until her dad says that she'll have to take care of Trina since he and their mom will be in Santa Barbara all weekend, which they used as an excuse to avoid taking care of Trina. Trina laughs, causing Tori to get mad at her and try to pull Trina's wisdom teeth out herself, chasing her again.

The next part of the episode begins with Cat and André (Ariana Grande and Leon Thomas III) doing a scene in acting class in the Blackbox Theater, but Tori's phone interrupts the scene when Sikowitz (Erwin Launge) finishes. At the end of the acting class, Sikowitz asks the class to share their plans for the weekend. Sikowitz points out that Robbie (Matt Bennett) has no plans. Robbie scoffs but admits that he doesn't. Rex (Jake Fowler) says that he will be ""partying"" with a couple of Northridge girls. Cat tells everyone (despite bored looks on her classmates' faces) that she and Jade (Elizabeth Gillies) are going to a new karaoke club in Los Feliz, Karaoke Dokie since they have singing competitions on weekends. Robbie asks if he and Rex can come and sing there as well while Rex protests about Robbie forgetting about the Northridge girls. Robbie assures him that the girls can come and watch, but Rex worries about being forced to spend his money on their food.

Tori wishes she could go but tells them she has to spend her weekend taking care of Trina because of her parents leaving for Santa Barbara. The process of taking care of Trina after her wisdom teeth are taken out proves to be really difficult. Trina is constantly moaning in pain and refuses to take her antibiotic (which Tori forces it into her mouth), let Tori ice her jaw with frozen peas, or flush her gum sockets with salt water, which constantly ends up with them fighting and arguing.

At the karaoke contest, Cat and Jade bring Beck (Avan Jogian) and André with them. While the gang is hanging out, Robbie and Rex sing the song Forever Baby. When Jade steps away to get a soda, two girls, Hayley Ferguson and Tara Ganz,(Jillian Clare and Jamie Snow) flirt with Beck and André. When Jade shows up, Hayley and Tara refuse to back down. Tara points out André's Hollywood Arts jacket, which Hayley calls a ""school for wannabes"". André and the gang try to defuse the situation by talking about buffalo nuggets and fun facts about the history of karaoke. After that, they challenge Cat and Jade to a sing-off.

Hayley and Tara are up first and sing ""Number One"" by Ginger Fox, showing that they are not particularly talented singers. When they perform, the Hollywood Arts gang is shocked to hear how bad Hayley and Tara sing. Next, Cat and Jade then sing ""Give It Up"" next and make their school proud by showing off how well they can sing in comparison to Hayley and Tara. The crowd enjoys Cat and Jade's song more, but the owner of the karaoke club comes out to announce that the winner is Hayley and Tara. It's revealed that Hayley and Tara won because the karaoke club owner is Hayley's dad. Rex, Beck, Jade, André, and Cat all express their outrage at the competition being fixed, but even with other crowd members booing his call, the owner bans Cat and Jade from ever singing at Karaoke Dokie again. The gang, furious, declare that they're leaving immediately... but only after finishing their food.

The next day, Tori is sleeping on the couch after she had to deal with the torture of taking care of Trina. Her friends come over with frozen yogurt to cheer her up. Furious that the competition was rigged, Jade makes up a scheme involving Tori. After André, Beck, and Robbie come to check on Tori, Cat and Jade visit to tell her about the plan. With Jade stealing Beck's car keys so he can't leave the house, the girls leave the boys to take care of Trina and get their plan underway. For Andre, Beck and Robbie, taking care of Trina also proves to be difficult for them with Trina biting Robbie's nose when he tries to flush her gum sockets with salt water, and fighting off the three.

Jade and Cat show up while Hayley and Tara are singing ""Hate Me Love Me"" by Ginger Fox. They bet Hayley and Tara that anyone in the place could impress the audience more by letting them choose who from the audience to sing against. Hayley and Tara pick a hideous girl named Louise Nordoff to compete against, not knowing she is actually Tori in disguise, thinking that this ""Ugly Betty"" will lose easily. Cat and Jade, knowing that is Tori and she would easily beat them, tell them not to pick her but someone with a chance but Hayley and Tara insist. The terms of the bet are that if Hayley and Tara win, Hayley gets to make out with Beck, and if they lose, they have to take care of Trina, who Cat and Jade know will be torture to work with.

Tori picks the song ""Freak the Freak Out"" despite the MC telling her the intensity of the song. However, she defies all odds and surprises everyone (except for Cat and Jade who know about the plan), especially Hayley and Tara, by taking off her ugly girl disguise and revealing her true self. The audience loves Tori more than Hayley and Tara and as a result, she is declared the winner. Everyone including Cat and Jade celebrates with her, signaling that Cat and Jade's ban is officially lifted and Jade's plan is a success. Tori then comes home and Robbie, Beck and Andre are upset that she, Cat and Jade left them at the Vega house to take care of Trina. Beck is upset that Jade took his car keys and Robbie is upset because he was covered in Trina's gum blood due to him doing most of the tasks. They keep arguing until Hayley and Tara come over. Tori tells them that the three are done taking care of Trina when Robbie says it Tori's turn, she says it's now Hayley and Tara's turn because they lost to her back at Karaoke Dokie. Hayley didn't want to do one of the tasks but Tori tells her that they lost their bet and had to deal with it.

In the end, Sikowitz sings ""Number One"" by Ginger Fox, the same song ironically Hayley and Tara sang when they faced Cat and Jade. While the gang is watching him, Hayley and Tara are forced to deal with the torture of taking care of Trina. Their tasks prove harder than Tori and Robbie because unlike the earlier scenes, the Vega house is messed up and Trina is hiding from the two. She tackles Hayley but she and Tara put her in a lock. Her parents come home but when her father sees Trina fighting the two while Hayley is attempting to put the gauze in Trina's mouth, he tells Holly Vega to go back into the car. Back at Karaokie Dokie, he imitates a scene from Flashdance and Shrek 2, sitting on a chair and releasing water on himself, applauded by the rest of the gang who then hugs him in joyous celebration."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0818224/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Estranged brothers reunite at a small airport to try to find their recently deceased father's hidden fortune.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['James Burrows'],"['', '', '']",[],"['brother versus brother', 'brother brother estrangement', 'brother brother reconciliation', 'brother brother rivalry', 'brother brother reunion', 'brother brother relationship']",[],"Joe Hackett is the owner and chief pilot of Sandpiper Air, a small commuter airline that operates out of Nantucket Island. Joe and his family are Nantucket natives and Joe has a younger brother, Brian. Brian is an irresponsible wisecracker who's personality stands in stark contrast to Joe's fastidiousness.

In the recent past, Joe had been engaged to a woman named Carol, who'd left him at the altar for another man. The other man was Brian himself, who'd eloped with Carol. Joe hasn't spoken to Brian in six years. Brian's irresponsible nature has caused him to lose several potentially lucrative jobs -- Brian was also thrown out of an astronaut training program at NASA simply for inviting a woman on a date to the space shuttle training simulator.

Brian and Joe both entered adolescence without their mother, who'd left the family. Recently, the brothers' father had died and had been suffering from an unnamed mental illness and had left them both with very little. A short time after the funeral, Joe is contacted by a lawyer who sends Joe a package with a note saying it should only be opened in the presence of Brian.

Joe is reluctant to contact his brother because of the bad blood over Carol. Joe and Brian's childhood friend, Helen Chapel, who owns and runs the airport's lunch counter, presses Joe to call Brian about the note from their father. Helen seems to want to bridge the gulf between the two and reminds Joe that everything left behind by their father should be split with his brother, no matter the feelings between them. The counter attendant for Sandpiper Air, Faye Cochran, agrees with Helen. Joe finally agrees.

Brian shows up at the airport and wastes no time with his wisecracking attitude: he flies in on the terminal's other airline, Aeromass, a much larger and more successful company than Joe's, which is run by the opportunistic and sleazy Roy Biggins. Brian comments out loud about Roy's cost-cutting measures on his planes which compromise the safety of his passengers.

Joe meets Brian and the situation is immediately tense. Helen greets Brian; Brian later remarks that Helen has grown up into a beautiful woman (he's also attracted to her). In a private meeting, Brian tells Joe that a few months before their father died, he'd talked to him on the phone. Brian says that their dad said ""You're rich."" Joe and Brian open the package together; there is only a key to a safe deposit box on Nantucket. Believing that their father had left them a sizable amount of money, the two retrieve the box and find another key to a post office box in Boston. They take Joe's next flight there.

A few hours later, Joe and Brian fly back to Nantucket empty-handed. The postal box contained another key, which led them to several other banks and a locker at a bus depot where they found yet another key that had no location. Brian is flustered over the situation; he'd recently been fired from another job flying charter in the Caribbean. When he says he's broke, Joe chides Brian about stealing Carol. Joe also goes on to say that Carol was a sweet and kind woman who loved Joe dearly. Brian then tells Joe that Carol had left him for another woman shortly after marrying Brian. Joe is also taken back by the news that Carol had two-timed them both. Helen takes Joe aside and suggests that Joe hire Brian as a second pilot for Sandpiper. Joe refuses immediately, saying that Brian would be an unreliable employee. When he offers the job to Brian, his brother turns him down and plans to leave on the next Aeromass flight.

Faye suddenly says that the key they'd come back from Boston with likely fits one of the airport lockers in the mezzanine above the lunch counter. The brothers have Lowell Mather, the airport's mechanic and general maintenance man, open the locker. Inside is a small suitcase which he tosses down to the brothers. Joe and Brian both agree to split the contents in half and when the case is opened, dozens of spring snakes pop out, startling everyone. Also inside the suitcase is a picture of Brian and Joe as young kids in swimming suits. Written on the back is a final note from their dad saying ""You're rich."" The two realize that their father had planned the treasure hunt with the intention of having his sons spend time together and in the hopes of getting them to forgive each other. While they muse over the picture, making fun of each other, Brian asks Joe if his job offer still stands. Joe gives him the job."

Howard orders a course correction so they can skirt it, just as the home office calls. They tell Howard that there's a bomb threat, and he has Tanner take over the bridge while he goes to investigate. He goes to the weather room to get his two senior officers, and bomb there goes off killing everyone inside.

MacGyver is relaxing at his apartment in Venice Beach, making breakfast for his landlady Susan. He serves it with a remote control and a small robot he's made, Roberta. Roberta drops an egg on Susan's foot, and MacGyver admits his technology needs a couple of adjustments. Pete Thornton, the head of DXS, calls, and tells MacGyver that he needs MacGyver's help. Pete explains that a cruise ship with 1,100 has a bomb threat from someone calling himself Viking,

Arriving at the briefing at DXS Headquarters, MacGyver is reunited with his old Vietnam bomb-defusal partner, Charlie Robinson. They talk about how Charlie married his sweetheart, Shirley, and has one child coming. They realize that Pete called them both in. MacGyver immediately tells Charlie to go home to his family because of his risk, but Charlies refuse because he needs the money.

The two of them go into DXS and meet with Pete. Pete is talking with Michael Donahue, who Pete recruited to find Viking. MacGyver says that Charlie has no business taking the case, and Charlie tells Pete to ignore MacGyver. Pete tells them that they have complete communication with the Victoria, and a warning bomb wiped out the weather room and killed Howard. The storm makes it impossible to put the passengers into lifeboats, and there are no ships or air rescue units near the liner. MacGyver and Charlie will take a jet to Midway and a Huey to the liner, and rappel down to it. He says that Donahue is running down Viking, and Charlie recognizes Donahue as the man who ran down the bomb squad in 'nam before their time. Donahue had a medical discharge and now works for the police, and runs one of the best bomb investigation units in the U.S.

The crew has located a bomb near the engine room, in an electrical cabinet. Donahue provides MacGyver and Charlie with a description, and Pete introduces the two men to Donahue. Viking calls in and uses a synthesizer for his voice, and says that he knows about Pete, Donahue, MacGyver, and Charlie. The extortionist says that the bomb is set to go off at 6 p, in ten and a half hours. They need to pay $6 million to stop the bomb. Donahue's partner Carlysle traces the bomb, and Pete has field units head there. Charlie calculates that once they get to the liner, they'll have three hours to defuse the bomb.

MacGyver and Charlie get to the liner and rappel down, and they send down their bag of bomb defusal gear first. The winch malfunctions, dropping the bag into the ocean. MacGyver improvises a rappel rope by taking apart a cargo net, and he and then Charlie rappel down to the liner. Carole greets them and explains that she's the acting captain. She takes them to the bomb and says that she hasn't told the passengers what's going on. MacGyver says that if he was a passenger, he'd want to know what was going on. Carole says that they believe the bomb was placed during dry-dock a month ago, put in a phony electrical panel, and has an elaborate detonation mechanism. The bomb is in an airtight clear glass container, and there's a plate holding yellow powder inside the casing, near the bomb. There are mechanical, electrical, and chemical bomb triggers on the inside of the case, and Carole gives MacGyver and Charlie headsets so they can talk live to Pete in LA

Pete and Donahue listen in, and MacGyver tells them what they're facing. He makes sure Donahue is on the national database so they can track the bomb MO, and they recognize the yellow powder trigger from a bomber they dealt with in Ling Chow in 'nam. MacGyver confirms the yellow powder is sitting beneath a heat-sensitive sensor, but they can't identify the powder.

An aide reports another bomb on D deck, at the opposite ends of the ship. MacGyver figures that the two bombs are synced, and MacGyver tells Carole to hold the ship steady. She says that she will, once she tells the passengers what is going on. Charlie goes to the second bomb, while Carole announces over the loudspeaker what is going on. The two men talk on the headsets and confirm that the two bombs are apparently identical.

There's a silicon base around the entire edge of the glass. Meanwhile, Viking calls DXS and figures they've found the second bomb. The call comes from an automated machine in a hotel room. He gives them instructions to put the $6 million in a locker at a downtown bus station. The call cuts off before Carlysle can trace it.

Pete tells MacGyver and Charlie that they have no leads on the Ling Chow suspects. He's going to go ahead with the money drop, and Charlie wonders what happens if Viking doesn't tell them how to shut down the bomb. Charlie goes first and probes the sealant leak. When air seeps in as he probes with a dental probe and seals the entry with Vaseline to get a sample to test, the powder ignites and sets off the sensor, which sets off the bomb. It explodes, killing Charlie, but now before he yells to MacGyver that it's a vacuum.

MacGyver goes up with Carole, whose crew has managed to isolate the area to keep the liner from sinking., When Carole asks if he's okay, MacGyver talks about how they tried to go for a record for bomb defusals in 'nam. They defused 51 bombs when they shipped out. MacGyver says that Charlie figured out it was a vacuum, and figure the bomb is in a vacuum and the powder is phosphorous. When air hits the phosphorous, it explodes, setting off the thermos-couple and the bomb. MacGyver figures he can disarm the bomb by filling the vacuum with something else besides oxygen. He asks Carole if there are any neon signs aboard. The aide, Atkins, reports that search teams have found a third bomb in the auxiliary power room. MacGyver figures they're in sequence and recruits Carole as his new partner.

At the bus station, the DXS agents put a briefcase with the money into the locker. One man stays outside as a backup while Donahue and the other agents wait inside.

MacGyver talks Carole through defusing the bomb, and admits that he's surprised to see that she's captain. She says that she is as well, and MacGyver scores off a piece at the end of one neon tube. Carole does the same, and under MacGyver's instruction they cork the tube and then push the tube through the gasket. Once it's inside, they pop the corks off the edge of the platform the phosphorous is on. The tube maintains a seal, and the neon creates a suction, pulling in the phosphorous. They pull their tubes out and the phosphorous flashes safely outside the casing.

MacGyver tells Pete the brand of the coupling, and Pete admits that they haven't found anything on Viking. Viking calls Pete and says that he has the money, but they've dealt in bad faith so he's not giving them the bomb-disarming instructions. Pete calls Donahue, who checks the locker and discovers that Viking took the briefcase out of a panel in the back.

Pete calls MacGyver and tells him what has happened. He says that it's up to MacGyver, and after a few minutes of consideration, MacGyver confirms that there are tubes of a liquid in the bomb and it's probably the last trigger. Pete calls to say that the computer has reported that the Ling Chow bomber used an unstable chemical trigger on two of his bombs. Donahue returns, and MacGyver figures that they need to neutralize the current-carrying liquid.

Donahue doesn't remember the Ching Low bombers' chemical triggers, even though he commanded the lead sabotage control group in the area during that time. Undeterred, Donahue suggests that it's an acid mixture. If the acid is released, it will create a short that sets off the bomb. MacGyver has Carole get pastry tubes, a container of oven cleaner, and a pint of low-fat milk. Carole tells Atkins to get it, and MacGyver explains that they can use something with a strong alkaline base to negate the acid.

Once the components are assembled, MacGyver and Carole inject the milk and oven cleaner into the acid tubes using the pastry tubes. The liquid starts to neutralize the acid, for MacGyver and Carole. Carole has the compartment doors dogged shut if the bombs go off. MacGyver asks Donahue about his team's post-mortem on the bombs, and Donahue says that there wasn't enough left.

MacGyver reminds Pete that they have a golf game planned later. Pete talks to MacGyver on a separate channel, well aware that the golf question was a coded message since MacGyver never plays golf. MacGyver has Pete check one of the Ching Low bombings, figuring that anything so personal is a piece of ""art"" and has a personal signature. He has Pete cross-check who was on all of the defusal teams that dealt with the triggers, possibly narrowing it down to Viking.

The acid changes appearance as it neutralizes, and MacGyver and Carole drain the neutralized acid safely. The bombs shut down, and everyone at DXS shakes hands with each other in relief. Pete gets a cross-check report from the computer, calls MacGyver privately, and tells him that Donahue was on all of the teams. MacGyver has already figured Donahue lost his leg in one of the bombings, but he wanted proof so had Pete run the computer check.

The bombs reactivate and MacGyver removes the bomb cover. There's a backup timer counting down 60 seconds, and two fuses, yellow and blue. MacGyver figures one cuts the circuit and one fires it, and asks Donahue for advice saying that he's stuck. Donahue tells him to pull the blue fuse, and MacGyver pulls the yellow fuse and then has Carole do the same. The bomb defuses, and MacGyver has Carole do the same. Pete arrests Donahue, and has his men take him away.

Later, Carole and MacGyver wait on the deck for MacGyver's chopper. She asks him to stay and relax, and MacGyver agrees as long as he gets to sit at the captain's table."

He subsequently gets a gun and kills his wife, three kids, two other guests and the husband of his accuser. He tells the woman how he has hated living a lie before killing her. He calls in help to clean up and stage the murders.

In New York, a young boy called Jonah walks in on his grandmother being murdered in the home. Before she dies she says to the murderer, ""you can't hide"" indicating she knows him. Jonah blames himself for not saving her and gets busted while offering weed to a local gang to find her murderer.

A local Jewish millionaire Meyer (Pacino), bails him from jail and to his house. Jonah looks around while Meyer has a call and stumbles on a room with some details on his grandmothers execution showing a red car and a man with a hat. Meyer tells Jonah a story of being in a concentration camp where they played chess with prisoners except the prisoners had knives to kill their opposition. One man instead went for the guard and while he was shot dead he managed to put a cross scar on the mans neck.

Meanwhile in Florida an elderly woman who works for NASA is gassed in her shower. A female FBI officer is on this case against all the odds of bias on gender and colour.

Jonah tracks down and finds the man with the hat - an elderly guy running a small toy shop, and confronts him. The man protests and cries saying the car isn't his and Jonah falters leaving the man to capture and tie him up. The man has a cross on his neck indicating he is the man Meyer referred to in the concentration camp. Jonah has a knife on his throat and seems certain to be killed but then Meyer comes in and kills the man with the hat.

Meyer introduces Jonah to his band of Hunters who are all trying to kill the Nazis who escaped. They executed the woman in Florida who was a chemical specialist for Hitler. They have executed 7 former Nazis so far.

He arrives first at the office before 7:00 a.m. where he's greeted by his secretary Roxanne Melman. As they start the schedule for the week after a long Labor Day weekend, they both notice a foul smell circulating in the office. No sooner than Becker sits down at his desk in his posh office decorated with expensive collectables, a desperate man enters Becker's office, pointing a gun at him. The man, identified as Dick Hobart, is apparently a man whose wife Becker represented sometime back during their divorce where Becker apparently forced/blackmailed Hobart into accepting a divorce settlement which financially destroyed him. Hobert fires the gun, but to Becker's relief, it's full of blanks. After Hobert flees, Roxanne discovers the dead body of Norman Chaney, one of the firm's senior partners, sitting at his desk with his face half-buried in a plate of food. Roxanne tells the news to Becker who casually responds: ""If he's dead, I got dibs on his office.""

An hour later, the firm is in turmoil as the coroner tells Leland McKenzie, the other senior partner, that Chaney has been dead for over 48 hours. He apparently died from a sudden heart attack while working at his desk Friday afternoon and remained that way the entire Labor Day weekend. Douglas Brackman Jr., the cynical managing partner and son of another recently deceased senior partner, is worried that how will they be able to handle the Irving Lewis tax audit without Chaney. Nearby, the firm's tax specialist, Stuart Markowitz, is trying to calm down the grieving Hilda Brunschweiger, Chaney's secretary who never stops crying (a running joke used throughout the episode). Nearby, Roxanne is talking to Ann Kelsey, an associate, about what happened and about being the one who found Cheney's body. Before McKenzie can even grieve, Iris Hubbard, his secretary, informs him that Justin Pregerson, the son of a wealthy client, has been arrested again and his wealthy father wants him bailed out of jail immediately. McKenzie gives partner Michael Kuzak a call on his car phone to go down to the L.A. county jail at once. Nearby, Douglas Brackman is interviewing Georgia Buckner as a potential new secretary. Georgia is visibly distraught when she learns of Norman Chaney's death and reminds Brackman that Chaney was the one who recommended her for the job. Associate Andrew Taylor and clerk Bruce Pollack talk among themselves about how attractive Georgia is.

At the L.A. County Jail, public defender Victor Sifuentes is trying to get in to see a client and is quarreling with the desk officer, Sergeant McKlosky, who refuses to let him see his client even though Sifuentes has all the proper identification. McKosky continues to refuse to allow Sifuentes see his client unless he is physically searched. Sifuentes refuses and gets angry when McKoskey begins saying racial slurs at him and almost gets into a fistfight with the racist police officer. Michael Kuzak arrives and intervenes just in time, prompting Sifuentes to walk out. Detective Lester Tuttle meets with Kuzak and agrees to let him meet with Justin Pregerson who is charged with raping a woman dying from leukemia. In a interrogation room, Kuzak meets with Pregerson, who is shown to be an arrogant, spoiled, overgrown, rich boy who defends his actions by saying the victim had it coming.

At the firm's noon staff meeting, the first big issue on Becker's mind is who will get Chaney's office and wants to be the one on it. Everyone, including McKenzie, jumps on him for being so insensitive. Becker then brings up his latest divorce case where he's trying to get a settlement for client Lynda Graham, whose husband has apparently been cheating on her. Associate Abby Perkins brings up a pro-bono case she and Ann Kelsey have involving an insurance company refusing to pay medical costs for a client named Celia Robinson. Brackman, being the natural and cynical businessman he is, cautions Kelsey and Perkins about taking on pro-bono clients, for the firm needs the revenues to survive. As the meeting breaks up, Abby is met by her unemployed husband, Jim, who is drunk and wants to borrow money.

Afterwards, Becker meets in his office with Lynda Graham, an attractive woman wanting him to represent her in the case of her divorce from her husband. Lynda tells Becker that she just wants a quick divorce, but Becker tries to persuade her to have her husband investigated for his alledged infidelity for evidence for it would mean a bigger divorce settlment for her (as well as a bigger paycheck for the greedy Becker). Lynda refuses to stoop to that level, but Becker decides to plan otherwise.

That evening, Perkins meets with Kelsey where they discuss their case about the insurance company refusing to cover the CAT scan for their pro-bono client as well as their own personal lives.

The next day at the L.A. courthouse at the arraignment, Kuzak enters a plea of not guilty for Justin Pregerson while two of Pregerson's friends, Emanuel Garcia and William Dollar who were arrested with him, are assigned lawyers. Garcia is given public defender Nick Klein who is quarreling with Leslie Aaron, an employee from the district attorney's office, in Judge Schroeder's courtroom about a turbulent on/off again romance they are having. Dollar is given lawyer Rob Cavanaugh as his representation. Bail is set for Justin Pregerson of $25,000, but Garcia and Dollar, who cannot afford bail, are left behind. Afterwards, Kuzak speaks to Aaron about a ""body"" his firm is looking for and she recommends Victor Sifuentes. Kuzak goes to Judge Armand's courtroom where Sifuentes is arguing his case about being denied visitation to his client, Carlos Hermosillo, whom Sifuentes is defending for drug procession. After hearing from Kuzak about witnessing the incident the other day at the jail, Judge Armand dismisses the case against Carlos Hermosillo. Kuzak gives Sifuentes his business card and offers him a job at his firm.

Later that day, Sifuentes has lunch with Kuzak, McKenzie and Brackman at a local resturant where they talk about Sifuentes joining the firm as a junior associate. But Sifuentes is not impressed by them and feels that they want him to do nothing more than handle the cases no one else in interested it. Feeling insulted, Sifuentes walks out of the restaurant.

Meanwhile, Kelsey and Perkins go to meet with Lester Mestman, the rep from the insurance company their client is being denied access to and wants them to handle payment for Celia Robinson's CAT scan.

That evening, Kuzak meets with lawyers Nick Klein and Rob Cavanaugh over drinks at a local bar to discuss their case. But the lawyers, to Kuzak's revulsion, detail their plans to keep the case tied up until the rape victim either quits the case, or dies.

The next day, Kuzak arrives late for the probable cause hearing where Judge Alice Ratakowsky reprimands him for being late. The hearing begins with district attorney Malcolm Gold putting the rape victim, Adrian Moore, on the witness stand. Afterwards, Cavanaugh cross-examines her and, in his underhanded ploy, tries to turn things around by implying that Moore led his clients on. Things go from bad to worse for Miss Moore when she explodes at Cavanaugh and wishes she would get a gun and kill the three men who raped her. As a result of this outburst, Judge Ratakowski holds her in contempt and has her taken away to a holding cell. Kuzak, having a change of heart, enters Judge Ratakowski's office to protest. But the judge talks with him about why he was late for court and reveals a parking ticket he got. Judge Ratakowski reveals that Kuzak apparently has over $4,200 worth of unpaid parking tickets for the year and has him taken away too. Kuzak is put in the jail cell next to Moore where she tells him that she cannot go through with her treatment in court anymore and decides to call her case off. Kuzak counters that if she would really get a gun and kill those three men (including Pregerson) who raped her, he would not lose any sleep over it. Moore replies: ""That's the difference between us. I would.""

Later that day, Kuzak goes to McKenzie where he tries to get himself taken off the Pregerson case. But his request falls on deaf ears. McKenzie tells Kuzak that they have to do what Mr. Pregerson Sr. tells them to help his son, even though Kuzak knows he's guilty.

Meanwhile, Becker meets with Angela Sipriano, a private investigator on the firm's payroll, who gives him photographic evidence of Lynda Graham's husband's extra-marital affairs.

The next day, memorial services are held for Norman Chaney. McKenzie leads off the eulogies, followed by Stuart Markowitz. But then, everyone is stunned when Brackman's new secretary, Georgia Bruckman, stands at the church podium and reveals that she's actually a transexual and that she and Norman Chaney had been lovers. Both Andrew Taylor and Bruce Pollock are shocked and somewhat amused. Brackman, being the bigot that he is, walks out of the church and immediately fires Georgia.

Back at the firm, Dr. Mandel, the doctor whom examined Ceila Robinson, arrives and he tells Kelsey and Perkins that Mrs. Robinson has an inoperable brain tumor and had it been diagnosed earlier, she might have had a chance of surgery and recovery. As a result, Kelsey sets out on a new task of proving the insurance company operated in bad faith in its dealings.

Back at the courthouse, Adrian Moore is put back on the witness stand, where she feigns memory loss, attributed to the medication she is taking. Despite D.A. Gold's opposition, Judge Ratakowsky dismisses the case for there is not enough sufficient evidence to support it. Justin Pregerson is still nervous, noting out-loud about Miss Moore's earlier threat to kill him and his two friends. But he's unable to gain a sympathetic ear.

At the firm, Lester Mestman arrives with a small settlement from the insurance company, which Kelsey instantly rejects.

Meanwhile, Becker introduces the photographic proof of Lynda's husband in an amorous embrace with another woman during a lunch date with her. Lynda is furious with Becker for doing this behind her back since she previously told him that she just wants a clean break from her marriage. Becker reminds her that one day she'll thank him for this for it will help her get back on her feet, financially, with the improved settlement. Lynda knows that Becker did it because he only wants a larger share of the increased settlement, but she ends up saying nothing in order to accept this.

That evening after work, Pregerson, high on drugs, approaches Kuzak in the parking garage saying that his father had financially cut him off for this latest brush with the law and he wants money to get out of town. Kuzak refuses to give him any money, and Pregerson pulls out a gun on Kuzak and robs him. Kuzak goes to a nearby bar to call the police when he spots Detective Tuttle there getting drunk. Instead, Kuzak implies to Tuttle that a robbery just took place and leaves.

An hour later, Kuzak is back in his office, sitting at his desk and waiting, when Victor Sifuentes arrives to talk with him about his offer to join the firm which would help him out. Then, Kuzak receives a phone call from someone saying that Justin Pregerson was arrested again on a new string of charges involving possession of drugs.

Kuzak meets with Pregerson in jail again where he offers him a deal: if Pregerson pleads guilty to the rape of Adrian Moore, Kuzak will work on a deal that will get all the other charges dropped. Pregerson reluctantly agrees.

At the next court hearing, Pregerson and his two friends, Garcia and Dollar, plead guilty to the rape and they are sentenced to 18 months in jail. Kuzak goes to Adrian Moore sitting nearby where he offers her assurances that they will not bother her again, and even gives her his business card.

At a formal dinner party for the firm, a somewhat drunk Kelsey invites Markowitz to spend the night with her at her apartment. Nearby, Georgia arrives with a lawyer and they give a subpoena to Brackman which states that she's suing him for wrongful termination and sexual discrimination. Abby's husband, Jim, gets drunk and begins causing a scene. When Abby tries to calm him down, he responds by splashing his drink in her face and physically pushing her away. Also, Sifuentes agrees with McKenzie that he will join the firm on a trial basis.

The following afternoon, after everyone has left the office for the day, McKenzie asks Kuzak about the conclusion of the Pregerson case, and tells him that he's aware that Kuzak had tipped off the police to Pregerson's drug-induced condition and that he helped the prosecution with their case. Kuzak apologizes for letting his conscience get in the way, but stands firm on his moral views with the law and of the people he has to represent... most of whom he knows are guilty of the crimes he defends them from. McKenzie accepts this and reprimands Kuzak to try not to let it happen again.

The final scene has Kuzak working after-hours and alone at the firm when a tearful Adrian Moore arrives wanting attention since she's dying, and she has no one to comfort her. She and Kuzak embrace."

Archie;"" I think your dead from the neck up.""

A package arrives, and Archie opens it, it's a box of expensive Cigars, while Archie is happily examining the Cigars another Package arrives, its an expensive gift package, that includes Caviar and expensive Cheeses, It's from the richest person Archie Knows, an old Army buddy, worth Five Million dollars. The Fabulous Eddie Frasier. Archie is impressed by what Eddie has made of himself, he is kind of like Archie's Idol, if not Hero. the phone rings and its Eddie Frasier himself, Archie is delighted to hear from him, Eddie wants to set up a Army reunion at the Bunker household for the next night. Billy Pendergast, The Fugue Twins, and the unspeakable Eddie frasier.

Eddie: "" That boy can have anything he wants."" Mike: "" Whats does he want from you. Eddie; dropping his facade, "" He wants me to stay the hell away from him."" Eddie at this point looks totally distraught and out of answers, he seems to be questioning his own success. Archie and his army buddies, begin singing 'For he's a jolly good fella."" when they get to the part in the song, where they say 'that nobody can deny' Mike looks on sadly."

Lucy is concerned that they might disturb their neighbors at such a late hour, but Fred and Ethel assure her it isn't important. After reaffirming their friendship and concluding with a stanza of ""Sweet Sue"", the Mertzes say goodnight. Ricky and Lucy continue singing and are surprised to receive a phone call from Ethel, telling them to be quiet. Although puzzled by her about-face attitude, Lucy and Ricky decide it's time for bed. Lucy notices that Ethel has left her rings on the piano.

Lucy likes the bedroom window to be open but Ricky prefers it closed. They argue about it, loudly opening and closing the window, and Ethel calls again. She and Fred are trying to sleep. Once in bed, Ricky is kept awake by the steady drip of the bathroom shower. He tries to fix it and ends up breaking the pipe. Fred calls and a dripping-wet Ricky confronts him about the antique plumbing. After an exchange of insults, Ricky and Lucy decide to move.

The Mertzes come over the next morning with a copy of the Ricardos' lease. If they want to move before it isi up, they will have to pay rent for the remaining months. After Ricky and Lucy hotly refuse, they decide to force Fred and Ethel to break the lease. Ethel retrieves her rings and Lucy makes a nasty remarks about the stones being glass.

After making as much noise as they can, to drive Fred and Ethel crazy, Ricky brings his band for a late night rehearsal in the Ricardo apartment. They learn that the Mertzes have been selling tickets in front of the building for a ""midnight jam session with Ricky Ricardo and his orchestra."" Lucy asks them to play a song with lots of foot stomping. Fred and Ethel appear, dressed in nightclothes, covered in plaster from the chandelier that fell.

Several days later, Lucy and Ricky are nearly finished packing. They discuss how nice it will be to finally get away from the Mertzes but their hearts aren't in it.

Ethel and Fred appear, very subdued, and Ethel returns Lucy's belongings. Lucy does the same with her. They start crying and confess that each doesn't want to be without the other's friendship. It appears that Fred has a new lease in his pocket. The Ricardos decide to stay."

The losers of the bet must each pay the other two $50 if they are the first pair to slip up and use a modern convenience. Ricky objects when Lucy wants to use her oven, but relents when Lucy tries to fill the oven with wood to burn like back into the day.

Lucy makes Ricky take a bath in a tub she put in the kitchen from water heated on the stove. Ethel tries to make butter but was trying to churn milk instead of cream. After Lucy corrects her, Ethel comes back with a pound of freshly churned butter that she says only cost her $23.

Lucy tries to make bread. Her dough contains 13 cloves of yeast. Ethel reads the recipe and corrects Lucy by telling her that she only needed 3 cloves. Lucy replies that she'll just bake a few more loaves and won't have to bake for a couple of weeks.

Once she lets the dough rise, Lucy finds that she needs to put it in a larger bowl. An hour later, the dough is so much larger that she and Ethel barely can lift it into an even larger bowl. Finally, Lucy puts the large clump of dough onto a cookie sheet and pops it in the preheated oven.

Later when Lucy returns, she wonders why the oven door is slightly ajar. When she opens the door, an 18 foot loaf of bread pushes out and pins her against the sink!

Lucy and Ethel dress in turn-of-the-century clothes and expect to win the bet if they can catch Ricky returning from work in a cab, off the bus or from the subway. He rides up on a horse! Lucy insists that Ricky and Fred wear old clothes too, figuring that the girls can win because Ricky won't walk in public dressed in the old clothes. Ricky says he'll make it part of a publicity stunt for a new 1890's skit at the club. Fred comes in singing in his old duds. Lucy asks why Fred is so happy. Ethel explains that he likes those clothes. Fred says that it reminds him of when he was young and gay.

A telegram arrives that informs Lucy and Ethel that they are invited to be interviewed for a high class women's social club on Friday. Lucy wants to visit her salon to have her hair and nails done, but realizes that she will lose the bet if she does. A knock on the door turns out to be a surprise visit by two of the social club's interviewers. They have come unannounced to see how Lucy really lives while Fred, Ethel, Ricky and Lucy are dressed in their outdated clothes. The women call Lucy's kitchen ""primitive,"" and Ricky comes to Lucy's aid by saying that they are rehearsing for his club. One of the women ask why he does it. He replies that he has a bad habit of eating. So she concludes that they are show people.

The social club woman says that they have strict standards against show people. The other social club woman corrects her by saying that they have made allowances last year when they needed money. Lucy speaks up and says that she has been evaluating the social club and would not join a club that has disdain for show people. Fred, Ethel and Ricky cheer her, and Ricky says that he will pay the bet so that they can all go out to eat. Lucy says that they can only go after they eat a slice of her bread. She brings out a 2 square feet by 6 inches thick slice of her loaf with Ethel's butter on it. The four then bite all at once into the huge slice of bread."

Ricky is about to do a television show and is about to head to an rehearsal when he receives a phone call from his agent saying he must find a girl to do a commercial slated to air during the show. Lucy overhears the conversation and ask Ricky if she could be in the commercial only to be met with a prompt rejection. Soon after Ricky leaves, Fred (William Frawley) shows up seeing some work needs to be done in the Ricardos' apartment due to the absent Ethel (Vivian Vance). Lucy explains to Fred about the television opportunity and enlist his help in her scheme, SHOW Ricky how wonderful she could be in the commercial. The plan backfires when Ricky plugs in the television set and nearly electrocutes Lucy. Ricky then becomes angry when he discovers she took out the chasie for the tv piece by piece instead of one piece, making for an expensive repair. With the couple not speaking, Ricky phones Fred to come to the apartment and relay a phone message for him to the girl he hired to do the commercial. Lucy overhears Fred and Ricky's conversation and once Ricky leaves, dismisses Fred, making it seem as though the couple IS speaking and covers up for overhearing the conversation by saying the location and time of the rehearsal is the same for all of Ricky's programs. Fred leaves and soon after, the actress phones and Lucy tells her that the role had be recast. It's later that afternoon and we are now a rehearsal for the commercial. The director and script clerk are discussing the product, a new tonic called Vitameatavegamin and discover it contains everything but the kitchen sink including 23% alcohol. Lucy comes out to do a rehearsal and, having never tasted the product before, has a less than desirable facial reaction for the director's liking. After several attempts and run throughs, each a big disaster then the one before with the star fumbling her lines with each taste and becoming more intoxicated, Lucy finally acquires a taste for the tonic and the alcohol content. After noticing his star has become aloof and out of sorts, the director becomes concerned, asking if she will be well enough to do the live taping for the commercial and invited her to rest until showtime. The moment of truth finally has arrived and the only problem is, the star of the commercial is no where to be found. Ricky is called to start the program and after an introduction to the show, burst into a song. Mid song, a now hungover Lucy is seen stumbling backstage and cast an adoring gaze at her husband from the wings and stumbles on stage to show some affection to her still singing man. Ricky resumes singing only to be joined by Lucy who sings nothing but jibberish and uses her time to say hi to her best friends, Fred and Ethel, and even does her tv commercial spot, slurred words and all. A mortified Ricky carries her offstage, fearing for the worse that his career is now over."

Meanwhile, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and their wives travel by train to Beverly Hills to revisit the two singers' former mutual love-interest Pearl Bodine. Pearl's only reason for not having married one of them herself was that she could never decide which man she liked better. Jed Clampett and his family prepare them a welcoming dinner. The musicians' genteelly-beautiful and elegantly-attired wives --- feeling somewhat jealous and concerned over their husbands' frequent reminiscing about how sweet and lovely Pearl had always seemed to them --- privately decide to make an incognito visit to the Clampetts ahead of their husbands, to have the opportunity to discreetly meet and size up their perceived competition. They masquerade as cosmetics vendors, and hope at first that Granny is Pearl. Then they mistake Elly May for Pearl, and hasten away to revisit the beauty shop. The husbands then arrive without their wives, and dance with the Clampetts. Because Pearl thinks they are there to ask for her hand in marriage, she struggles to decide between them. Elly May's dogs end up eating most of the party-feast, but everyone shares an enjoyable evening, complete with The Singing Duo's sumptuous banjo-performances. When Flatt and Scruggs return to the party later with their wives, Pearl thinks they have married them on the rebound from her rejection."

With a note promising a handsome reward for taking care of the children. Eda and King take on the task, and send Luz off to the library to return Eda's overdue books.

At first in awe of the magical place, Luz is more shocked when she finds Amity Blight happily reading a story to some children! Though Luz attempts to use this opportunity to patch things up between her and Amity, things don't go so well. However, a few moments later she runs into Amity's twin siblings, Emira and Edric, who recall Luz from the recent Covention.

The two get Luz to join them in playing pranks around the library, before they are caught and ejected. The twins then ask Luz to come back and join them after-hours, with word that a celestial occurrence called ""The Wailing Star"" is supposed to affect the library in some way. Luz eagerly accepts, feeling confident that if she befriends the twins, eventually she can win over Amity. Unseen by Luz, Amity overheard what was being said.

Later that evening, Luz and the twins return after The Wailing Star passes overhead. This ends up allowing the books in the library to come to life when opened. As the three explore the library, Luz finds the book Amity had been reading, about a bookmaker named Otabin who longed for a friend.

As she looks through it, the twins mention how if one alters the pictures in a book, it'll affect what comes to life. The twins try to get Luz to deface the Otabin book, but she refuses, leading to them doing it for her.

The two then lead Luz to the romance section of the library, where they reveal a secret room, which is where Amity goes for privacy. The twins claim they intend to steal their sister's diary and post pages around the Hexside school to get back at Amity for tattling on them.

Luz isn't so sure she should he helping them, but grows excited when she finds that Amity also is a fan of the ""Good Witch Azura"" series! It is then she accidentally finds the diary...just as Amity comes across them! While Amity chastises her siblings, she claims that Luz seems to be a bully, and takes off.

Separating from Edric and Emira, Luz tries to change Amity's mind, when the altered form of Otabin appears, and attempts to sew Amity into a book. Luz attempts to fight back, but is accosted by the creature.

Amity and Luz manage to escape briefly, before Amoty breaks free of her bindings, and takes down Otabin. Conjuring up an eraser, Amity gives it to Luz, who erases the defacing in the book, returning the character to normal.

As the sun rises, the two finish cleaning up the mess, and Luz loans Amity her copy of book #5 in the ""Azura"" series, to make up for looking in her diary.

Luz then returns to the Owl House, where she finds that Eda and King are sleeping quietly with the Batqueen's babies. It is then that the Batqueen shows up, retrieving her children, and leaving a reward behind."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0505358/?ref_=ttep_ep25,,Malloy and Reed respond to repeated calls about an argument between two men and their wives over a boat they co-own. The feud escalates and ends with a fatal conclusion.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Phil Rawlins'],"['', '', '']",[],['boat'],[],"In this episode, the two officers make four trouble calls over a day and a half to the same address, to try to settle a dispute between two neighbors over a boat they co-own. Sadly, the neighbors escalate their dispute with every call, until finally one of the two men is dead.

Teaser Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed knock on a man's front door. Miles Wellman, dressed in a combination cap and sailor's shirt, answers the door.

""Did you call the police?"" Malloy asks.

""I sure did. Come in,"" says Wellman. Act One Wellman, out of the blue, tells them he wants them to arrest a man named Sid Roemer--without at first telling them whom he's talking about.

Malloy and Reed, with help from Miles' wife Agnes, get the story--well, a story--out of Wellman: the dispute is over a boat Wellman says is his. Wellman will say only that the boat is stored in Sid Roemer's garage. So Wellman goes over to unlock the boat to take it out for a weekend, and finds the padlock changed.

Agnes tells them the real hooker: Wellman owns only half of it, and Sid owns the other half. They were supposed to use it on alternate weekends--and there's been nothing but trouble ever since.

Knock, knock.

Agnes answers the door.

And a man with glasses, as soon as the door swings wide, starts shouting, ""You haven't heard my side of it!""

The man, Malloy and Reed gather, is Sidney Roemer. In the back-and-forth shouting that follows, Roemer complains that Wellman had the boat last weekend. Wellman reminds Roemer that he, Roemer had agreed Wellman could use the boat again this weekend.

Reed goes with Roemer to his own house, where Roemer tells Reed, ""I've had it up to here"" (indicating his neck) ""with that guy."" And he tells the rest of the story: Wellman had come to him with the proposal to buy the boat. ""Like he's too cheap to buy a boat himself."" Roemer, feeling exploited because Wellman seemed to be getting more use out of the boat, had changed the padlock to get Wellman to be more reasonable about his half of the ownership rights.

Malloy and Reed know they can't settle the matter; Wellman and Roemer have to do that themselves. Malloy points out it's too late to go fishing anyway, so why don't the two hash out their differences?

Next scene: nighttime. Malloy reminds Reed he needs to ""clear"" them. Reed gets on the radio: ""1-Adam-12. PM Watch. Clear.""

The dispatcher answers back: ""1-Adam-12, clear, and a call. See the woman; neighbor dispute. 1882 North Academy Drive. 1-Adam-12 handle. Code Two.""

Reed accepts the call, then realizes he recognizes the address: ""It's that Wellman place again!""

The officers arrive to find Miles Wellman trying to take the outboard motor out on a hand truck, and Sid Roemer waving a load of cash at Wellman, offering to buy Wellman out of the boat.

This time Sid tells the story: Sid and Wendy Roemer were going out, when Sid decided to unlock the boat. Out of nowhere came Miles, who grabbed the padlock away from him. Miles then went over to get his car, and to hitch the boat trailer to it, to move the boat out. Sid then let the air out of the trailer's tires, so Miles couldn't move the trailer. Miles kept pulling, however, and chewed up the tires. Sid then grabbed a wrench and smashed Miles' windshield--except Sid, not looking whose car he was smashing, smashed the windshield of his own car! Miles, meanwhile, gave up trying to pull the boat out and started taking the boat's tackle out, starting with the outboard motor. That's when Sid had grabbed the wad of cash, which was when the officers arrived.

Malloy tells both men that if they have to come out there again, someone will go to jail. Act Two The next morning they get another call: ""1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the woman, 415 fight. 1882 North Academy Drive...""

For the uninitiated: Section 415 of the California Penal Code stands for ""disturbing the peace,"" ""disorderly conduct,"" etc. And when adults turn to fisticuffs to settle their differences, that's a classic disturbance of the peace. Sure enough, the officers arrive to find Wellman and Roemer, locked in a mutual wrestling grip, kicking at each other, on the floor of Sid Roemer's garage.

The story is as simple as it is brutal: Wellman broke into the garage to steal the boat when he thought Roemer wouldn't wake up. Roemer caught him at it, and the two got into the fight. Roemer charges Wellman with felony attempted grand-theft marine (or whatever you'd call it). Wellman counters with a charge of assault and battery. So Malloy and Reed take both men to the precinct, and advise Agnes Wellman and Wendy Roemer that they might want to let their husbands cool their heels in jail rather than bail them out.

At the precinct, Malloy begs Sergeant Jerry Miller to find some ground, any ground, on which to hold them. ""We've had to go out there three times in the last twenty-four hours, and now both men are filing felony charges. And it's just spite!"" he says.

Sadly, the sergeant can't hold them. The reason: each man will drop his charges if the other man will drop his.

Malloy is heartsick, but reminds Reed sharply, as they continue their patrol that night, that ""if you punished everybody who was going to do something, you'd have half the country in jail.""

Then comes the call Malloy dreads: ""1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the woman, unknown trouble. 1882 North Academy Drive. 1-Adam-12, handle. Code 2.""

Unknown trouble. The worst kind of trouble call in a way, because they don't know what to expect.

The boys arrive, and at first hear nothing, then see nothing. Then, from Sid Roemer's garage, Agnes' anguished voice cries out in open sobs, and the name ""Miles!"" The two rush into the garage, to find Miles Wellman unconscious, and Agnes bending over him, saying only, ""He hit him.""

Malloy, with difficulty, persuades the distraught Agnes to go to her own house to call an ambulance. Then, leaving Reed to guard Wellman, Malloy goes to the front door, identifies himself, and demands entry. A sober Sid says, from inside, that the door is open.

Malloy goes through the full motions of making an arrest: hands behind the head, feet spread, frisk, handcuffs, the whole nine yards. In the process, Sid begs Wendy to understand: ""I couldn't take it anymore, Wendy. You do see that?""

""No,"" says Wendy, even more distraught than Agnes was, though a good deal quieter. ""I don't see.""

Tag

Sgt. Miller tells the two officers he has checked with the hospital. The charges will be homicide, as Miles Wellman was pronounced dead on arrival.

Sid Roemer has confessed: Sid caught Miles breaking into his garage again. Miles came after him with a boathook. Sid then had no choice, as he said, but to brain Wellman with a fire extinguisher. Except the doctors report Sid must have struck Wellman three vicious blows.

All Sid would say, says the sergeant, is that he got tired of Miles Wellman pushing him around.

""Tell him,"" says Malloy, ""he pushed back a little too hard."""

The story begins with Rubble riding his skateboard towards Katie's Pet Parlor, where Skye is getting her hair done, and Rocky is being dragged, one way or another, into taking a bath by Katie's pet cat Cali.

While repairing his ATV, Ryder soon gets a call from Cap'n Turbot, who reveals that his ship, The Flounder, has run aground, and if he cannot get it free, it could sink to the bottom of the bay. Ryder assures the Cap'n that they are on their way, and summons the pups to the Lookout. This saves Rocky from taking a bath, but leaves Cali annoyed by Rocky being saved from humiliation as she has to spread eagle to avoid going in herself.

Once the pups arrive, and Marshall wipes out in the elevator, Ryder tells them about the situation, complete with Cap'n Turbot's worry about the Flounder sinking, and asks for Zuma and Skye to help him out. Zuma will assist Ryder with attaching cables to the Flounder to pull it free from the rocks, and Skye will provide over-watch to look for the safest path through the rocks and back to Seal Island, so Cap'n Turbot can make repairs to his ship. The PAW Patrol deploys,, and head out to meet Cap'n Turbot.

Once the PAW Patrol get there, ropes are attached to the crane hook on the back of the Flounder. But, Ryder and Zuma have tugboat trouble, straining with all their horsepower, but the Flounder cannot be loosened as it has too much mass. Cap'n Turbot fixes that, heaving his walrus friend Wally out of the lower port and dumping him overboard, as Cap'n Turbot has been studying a few things on walruses, and needed Wally as his test subject. With Wally unloaded, Ryder and Zuma are able to pull the Flounder free, but then discover that it has a hull breach, and is sinking.

While Cap'n Turbot panics, Ryder calls Rocky for help. Rocky is back at Katie's, as Cali tries once more to get him to take a bath. But Ryder's call saves Rocky again, leaving Cali to get soaked, much to her frustration and exasperation. After being asked by Ryder to find something to patch the breach in the Flounder's hull, Rocky finds a spare piece of metal, and is airlifted by Skye to Seal Island to transfer the patch to Ryder and Zuma. But Skye flies so low over the water, Rocky pleads for her to go higher so he doesn't get wet. They soon make it to the island, transfer the patch to Ryder and Zuma, who then head back out to the Flounder.

By this point, Cap'n Turbot has begun to panic more, having put on a scuba mask, snorkel, and inflatable toy inner tube. Ryder and Zuma soon arrive, Ryder having put on his scuba gear, and they head down to patch the hole. While they do that, Cap'n Turbot prepares to either go down with the ship, or swim to safety, as he begins to play ""Taps"" through his snorkel like a trumpet to honor his ship, and salutes it as well. Ryder and Zuma soon resurface, having successfully put on the patch, and finish towing the Flounder back to Seal Island.

Cap'n Turbot is very grateful, and thanks the pups for their help. When he pets Skye, Rocky whimpers happily, asking for a good belly rub, and gets one from Cap'n Turbot, especially on his tickle spot.

Back at the Lookout, the pups go to have some fun, but Rocky ends up splashing into a muddy puddle. Knowing what happens next with unhappiness, Rocky is soon back at Katie's to finally get his long-awaited bath, ending the story as he at least tries to enjoy himself with a little help from Cali.

Pups Fall Festival:

As the story begins, Chase and Marshall are up at Farmer Yumi's, helping her with the harvest of her apple trees and pumpkin patches for the Fall Festival, with Marshall showing his excitement for the season. After Marshall tries to harvest apples higher in one tree, and gets sent flying by the flimsy branch that he grabbed hold of, he lands in the pumpkins and gets one on his head. At first, it looks as if Yumi is upset about that, but she is more worried about Bettina, whose weather sense is going off. When Yumi checks her cellphone's weather app, there's a snowstorm coming in, despite Chase's protests that it isn't winter yet. Worried that the three of them won't be able to finish harvesting the apples and pumpkins before the snow hits, and the Fall Festival will be ruined as a result, Chase and Marshall decide to call on the rest of the PAW Patrol for help and head back to the Lookout, with Marshall becoming stuck in the fence and stumbling out.

When they arrive and tell Ryder about the situation, he summons the rest of the pups. For once, only Rubble, Rocky, Zuma, and Skye (the latter two having a brief race and arguing over who won, with Skye flipping into the elevator) head to the Lookout's top, instead of all six pups. Chase and Marshall are already waiting, and in their uniforms, when the other pups join them. Once Ryder tells the pups about the situation, and Chase and Marshall voice their concerns as well, Ryder passes out their orders. All the pups are needed for this assignment, so the whole team deploys, but while the rest of the pups get their vehicles, Skye uses her pup-pack to keep up with them.

When the PAW Patrol reach the farm, Ryder assigns Marshall to use his ladder to harvest the apples, Rubble to carry the harvest to the barn to store it, Zuma and Skye to harvest the pumpkins, and Rocky to see if he can find a much easier way to harvest the apples instead of picking them one-by-one. Things seem to go fine, but it soon descends into chaos. At that point, Chase is requested to help pass out order to ensure everything goes smoothly. With Chase passing out orders, things go much better. But the snow soon starts to fall, and with so many pumpkins still in need of being transferred to the barn, Ryder makes a pumpkin-rolling contest out of it, with Zuma and Skye participating, while Rocky and Rubble take turns with finishing the apple harvest with Marshall. With that plan, the rest of the pumpkins and apples are harvested just in time, and Yumi thanks the PAW Patrol for all their help.

A little while later, after the snow melts, Mayor Goodway declares the Fall Festival open, and everyone enjoys themselves, except for Marshall, who ends up getting another pumpkin on his head by accident from Rubble, ending the story as Marshall unhappily replies ""I'm OK..."", since he got his head squeezed in pumpkins during the majority of the story."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3141282/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"The PAW Patrol pups are playing on the beach when they discover sea turtle hatchlings. Later, Cap'n Turbot needs help moving a beached baby whale back out into the bay.",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],"['turtle', 'baby']",[],"Pups Save the Sea Turtles:

The story starts with Rocky and Zuma enjoying some beach time with Rocky practicing on Zuma's kite-surfing surfboard, while Katie builds a sandcastle. Alex soon runs by with a volleyball, and catapults Rocky onto Katie's sandcastle, wrecking it. Either way, no-one is hurt, and Alex asks if the pups want to play volleyball with him. They agree, but soon the ball bounces across the street, and Alex attempts to retrieve it. Knowing that Alex is too small to be seen by the drivers, Katie, Zuma, and Rocky are able to catch up and stop him from entering the street, reminding him to look both ways before crossing. Once a driver stops and honks to let them know that they can cross, Katie, Zuma, Rocky, and Alex head over to look for the volleyball. Instead, Rocky and Zuma smell something else, and upon investigating, hear something scratching underneath the sand. Moments later, a baby sea turtle pops up, having just hatched. Soon more begin to surface, and Alex nearly falls on one before the pups catch him. Katie is worried, as with the baby sea turtles needing to get to the sea, they have to cross the road, full of traffic, and deal with the hungry seagulls as well. Rocky and Zuma agree that this is a job for the PAW Patrol, and they go to find Ryder, while Katie keeps an eye on the turtles; and Alex.

At the Lookout, Ryder is helping Marshall and Rubble with washing Rubble's pup house/digger, when Marshall accidentally soaks Rubble when he can't hear Ryder's instructions to turn off his hose. Zuma and Rocky soon arrive, but when Marshall hears the word ""trouble"", he accidentally soaks Rubble again.

Once Zuma and Rocky are able to tell Ryder about the situation, Ryder agrees to help, and summons the rest of the pups. Marshall has his regular crash, smacking into the back of the elevator, and the pups are soon topside. Once there, Ryder briefs the pups on the situation, and tells them how they can help.

Chase will provide security and traffic detail, and Rubble will figure out an alternate means for the turtles to reach the sea without crossing the road and being vulnerable to the seagulls. The pups deploy, and when they reach the area, it is not long before the turtles start to cross the road. Chase roadblocks one direction with his truck, and blocks the other with his cones. With the turtles safe from traffic, Rubble gets to work clearing out the tunnel leading to the beach from beyond the road. As the first of the turtles reach the beach, Alex, who had been playing in an inflatable raft, suddenly wonders why there are down there, and sweeps them up in a bucket to return to Katie and Ryder. They are surprised by what Alex has done, and tell him about how sea turtles live in the sea, and need to go back there once they hatch. Realizing his error, Alex allows Ryder and Katie to release the turtles to begin heading towards the shoreline again.

Meanwhile, Rubble finishes clearing the tunnel, then gets to work on the entrance from the road by clearing out the sand with his pup-pack since his digger is too big for the smaller opening. While the pups are busy with the sea turtles, Alex maintains keeping the seagulls away from them so they can reach the sea safely. However, he soon notices Zuma's kite-surfing surfboard, and decides to head out for a ride on it, only for the wind to cause the board to lift off the water and go airborne since Alex was too light to keep in on the water. When Ryder and Katie hear Alex's cries for help, Skye is dispatched to retrieve him, and then goes airborne to help Alex. Skye is able to retrieve Alex safely, and returns him safely to the ground. Alex then gives Skye a good scratching to thank her for saving him.

A little while later, Rubble finishes clearing the tunnel, and the turtles soon start using it to bypass the street and reach the sea safely. The pups have done another good job, and have earned some beach time for it. As everyone enjoys some volleyball, Alex misses his catch as the ball bounces off his head, and he starts yelling and jumping up and down, like something is in his pants. When Katie and Ryder wonder what's wrong, Alex mentions something in his pocket, and pulls out the beach crab, joking that he sure is grouchy. Everyone laughs as the crab skitters away as the story ends.

Pups and the Very Big Baby:

The story begins with the pups enjoying themselves as always. Marshall, Skye, Rubble, and Rocky attempt to have a sliding contest, but the moment Skye attempts to climb up the steps of the playground slide, she leaps away with a yelp, as the heat has made the steps too hot. Marshall helps out by soaking the slide down with his water cannons, making it a water-sliding contest, and Rocky soon improves it with a slip-and-slide he had stored in his pup house.

Meanwhile, Ryder is giving Chase a good brushing, when they get a call from Cap'n Turbot, revealing that a baby whale has beached herself and he is doing his best to keep her wet so she doesn't dry out. Needing help, Cap'n Turbot asks the PAW Patrol for help, and Ryder says they are on their way. When the pups spot Marshall running in to join them in the elevator, they quickly part to ensure Marshall doesn't crash into them as always. The only crash is when Marshall smacks into the back of the elevator, and chuckles at how he made it as always.

Ryder calls the pups, reveals the situation, and dispatches Rubble and Marshall to help with the baby whale. As Skye shows empathy mentioning that the baby whale misses her mother, Rubble will attempt to clear a channel to help float the baby whale out to sea at high tide, while Marshall will help keep the whale wet until they can get it in the water again. The team deploy, and upon arriving, Marshall gets right to work, although the baby whale has some fun blowing Marshall across the beach when he gives it a drink and it spits it back out, right at him.

Rubble soon finishes the channel, and digs out the sand blocking the entrance for the water with his pup-pack. Soon, the tide starts to come in, but it's as high as it goes and not enough to reach the whale. Deciding they have to try and push the Baby Whale out, the plan fails as the Baby Whale sneezes everyone away as they attempt to push the first time. As they continue with keeping the whale wet, the PAW Patrol soon hear the mother whale coming. Fearing that she could get beached as well, they attempt to scare her off with loud noises. It takes Marshall's firetruck horn and siren to finally convince the mother whale to back off, but as Cap'n Turbot notices her starting to panic in worry for her baby, they know they need to get the baby whale back in the water. Remembering the slip-and-slide that Rocky used earlier, Ryder has him bring it down to the beach, unrolling it into the water, and Marshall soaking it down with his water cannons. With Rocky's help, another attempt at pushing the baby whale back into the water succeeds, and she is reunited with her mother. When the whale and her mother leave, everyone says goodbye, only for Rubble to start sobbing and tear up. Marshall asks Rubble what's wrong, but he begins to deny it.

Afterwards, when Ryder wonders who's hungry, Cap'n Turbot joins in the pups' agreement with a little too much enthusiasm, but calms down as he reveals he keeps some fresh squid jerky with him at all times. After offering Ryder some, and Ryder graciously saying no, Ryder gives the pups some treats, then agrees they earned some beach time for their hard work. The other pups join them later on, and soon, as they all eat, Zuma spots the baby whale, who lets off a plume of water in thanks, ending the episode as the pups and Ryder cheer, irising out on that good note."

The episode starts with a crab walking along the beach. Rubble is then seen spinning around, and he's going to throw a Frisbee. Chase jumps up to catch it, but misses, lands on a volleyball, and falls into an umbrella. He then says ""Told you I got it."" A little squeaking noise is heard, and Rubble thinks it was Chase's tail that was making that noise. Chase says it wasn't him, but it was coming from the bay. A kitten is then seen floating out to sea on a toy boat. Rubble and Chase then run up to the bridge to get a better look, and they both decide to find Ryder and the rest of the pups to try and help.

At the Lookout, Skye is jump-roping with the assistance of Rocky and Zuma. As she is jump-roping, Skye sings: ""A. I am an aardvark. I come from Alabama, where I sell ant farms!"" Marshall then goes: ""B. I am a Baboon. I come from..."", but then trips on the jump rope, and falls, with his legs tied by the rope, causing all the pups to laugh.

Meanwhile, Ryder is kicking a soccer ball in the air, until Rubble and Chase show up, and assess the situation to him. Ryder then calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout. As all their pup tags go off, Zuma and Rocky are trying to get Marshall unstuck, but as they are called, they start to just leave Marshall there. Marshall says he needs help, and Skye frees him.

Zuma, Rocky, Skye, and then Marshall all run into the elevator, with Marshall running up the wall and falling down to the ground. As Marshall is done falling, he says ""Made it.""

Once the PAW Patrol are topside, Ryder briefs them on the situation and assigns Zuma and Skye to help rescue the kitten.

Skye helps Ryder and Zuma locate the kitten. Ryder points her out, and Zuma and him rush over to the kitten. Ryder assures the kitten that everything will be OK, and picks up the toy boat out of the water. As Zuma says ""It's so cute"", the kitten hisses at him, and jumps on his head, and kicks him out of his hovercraft. ""Don't touch that, kitty, the hovercraft might... take off."" Zuma says as the kitten starts to drive his hovercraft. Ryder and Skye go on a goose-chase for the kitten. As she drives right towards them, Ryder tells Zuma to get ready to drive, as he jumps on the hovercraft, shuts it off, and takes the kitten out of the driver's seat. ""Don't worry kitty, everything is gonna be alright. You're all better."" Ryder says as he tells the kitty that they will get her back to dry land.

At the Pet Parlor, Katie is seen grooming Cali, and Rubble shows up, with the kitten they just rescued. Katie asks where she came from, and Rubble explains what happened. Rubble says the kitten needs a bath, and Katie says she will offer help, as kittens are hard to bathe. As Rubble offers the kitten a bath, she doesn't go into the water, and starts to wreck havoc around Katie's.

Ryder is then called by Rocky, who has found a girl who has lost a kitten named ""Precious"". Ryder realizes that the kitten they rescued is Precious, and she is seen skateboarding past Ryder as he realizes that. She skateboards past Mr. Porter, who is carrying a big cake to his delivery van. Mr. Porter manages to keep the cake steady as the kitten skateboards underneath him, but walks into his van, making a piece of the cake spill right on his head.

Rubble, Ryder, and Chase are looking for Precious. Rubble suggests Chase's ""super-sniffer"". Chase says, ""I need something with her scent on it."" Rubble gives Chase her ribbon, and Chase starts his hunt, sneezing all the way. They soon find Rubble's skateboard, and Chase stands on it, and says he knows that Precious was on it. ""Great sniffing Chase!"" Ryder says. As Chase thanks him, he sneezes, and the skateboard moves backwards, and Chase crashes into a curb. He then notices Precious, who is at the bell area of City Hall. Ryder calls Marshall, and says he needs his fire truck.

Marshall shows up to City Hall, and puts his ladder up. Ryder tells him to be careful. As Precious slips on the rope she jumped onto (the one that rings the bell), she jumps on Marshall, landing on his face, and causes the ladder to spin around in circles. Rocky and the little girl show up. Marshall turns around on the ladder, hits every rung on his way down, and is caught by Ryder. Precious falls, lands on Marshall's stomach, and bounces right into the owner's arms. The girl says the kitten that she needs to ""thank all the brave pups that saved you, and you too (referring to Ryder). You're all heroes!"" Ryder thanks her, and gives his line ""Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!"" Also, when Rubble was giving the ribbon back to the little girl, he was tearing up, sad to see Precious go.

Ryder tells the pups they were good, and they deserve treats. Rocky and Zuma start the jump-rope, and Skye starts first, flipping to get her treat. The Chase enters to get his, then Rubble, and Marshall, who gets tied up in the jump-rope when jumping up for his treat. Everyone laughs as Marshall is tied up to end the story.

Pups Save a Train:

The story begins with Chase and Rubble hard at work with the sand pit outside the lemonade stand on Main Street. As Rubble finishes smoothing out the sand, Alex and Precious' owner ask for a sandcastle, but Rubble chooses to create a sand replica of his digger instead. While Alex and Precious' owner argue over who will play Rubble with the sand digger, Chase and Rubble share a laugh over Rubble's love for being a construction pup.

Elsewhere, the train is on its way to the station in Adventure Bay. On board, Katie and Cali are enjoying the ride as they return from Katie's grandmother's house. Cali's stomach is growling, indicating she's hungry again, but Katie refuses to share any of the treats from her grandmother, as they are for the PAW Patrol. Cali's stomach growling soon gets louder, but a very loud rumble scares Cali, and even Katie. In the locomotive, the engineer, Mr. Hudson, sees something ahead and engages the emergency brakes. It's soon revealed that a rock-slide has occurred. Worse, one of the larger boulders rolls down, and smashes into one of the wooden support beams for the railroad bridge that the train is now stranded on, cracking it and weakening it. If it gives out, the bridge will collapse, with the train going with it. As Mr. Hudson tells her what happened, Katie calls Ryder to let him know.

At the Lookout, Ryder is busy playing video-games on his pup-pad, when he gets Katie's call. Wanting to make sure, Ryder looks through the Lookout's periscope towards the bridge. Once he sees the problem, Ryder lets Katie know the PAW Patrol are on their way, and summons them to the Lookout. Marshall manages to enter the elevator without a problem, but all the other pups come crashing into him. When they reach the top, Ryder tells them of the situation, and a replay of Katie's call worries Skye, but Ryder assures her they will get Katie and Cali home safe.

Rubble and Rocky will go with Ryder up to the bridge to clear the rocks away, while the other pups remain at the Lookout as backup.

When Ryder, Rubble, and Rocky arrive at the blocked track, while the pups get to work with the cleanup, Cali slips away from Katie to go after a bag of potato chips that a seagull was eating on the roof of the train. After faking out the seagull twice, Cali pounces, but misses, and the bag and chips fall into the river below, much to Cali and the seagull's sadness.

Meanwhile, Ryder goes to check the bridge, and discovers the damaged support beam. He asks Rocky if he can come down and help, but it is too steep for his recycling truck. Knowing they need more help, Ryder calls Chase and asks that he will bring his winch to help with stabilizing the support beam until the train is off the bridge. While Chase soon arrives and lends his winch to lower a large log down to brace against the crippled support beam, Cali sees another chance for some food when the seagull returns with a loaf of bread to munch on. Cali scares the seagull off, but it returns and takes the bread with it, leaving Cali still hungry.

Meanwhile, the rock-slide is cleared and Ryder gives Katie the okay to let Mr. Hudson know he can start the train again. Katie agrees, but then mentions her worry for Cali.

As the train starts, Cali is unable to grip the roof, and is sent tumbling until she is grabbing the edge of the roof of the carriage for her dear life. As she meows in fear and fright, Ryder and the pups hear her, and Chase leaps into action. Using his canine agility to climb up the front of the locomotive and onto the roof, Chase soon finds Cali and helps her to safety. As Cali hugs Chase in gratitude, Chase lets off a sneeze due to his allergies, but endures it, especially when Cali is scared into his arms again by the train whistle/horn blowing. Cali is soon reunited with Katie, who thanks Chase for all his help, and despite nearly falling off the train himself due to another allergy-induced sneeze, Chase assures it was all in the line of duty.

Later, back at the Lookout, Katie rewards the pups with the treats from her grandmother, but Cali still attempts to sneak one herself due to still being hungry. In the end, Chase offers part of his that he didn't eat to Cali, and all is well, save for Chase knocking over the other pups with another sneeze due to his allergies.

As the pups and Cali play, the seagull reappears, now munching on a jelly doughnut. Cali attempts to climb up the slide to get it, but the slippery surface prevents her from doing so, and Chase soon joins her when trying to retrieve the soccer ball. In the end, the seagull shows it has a good heart, and tosses the doughnut to Cali, only for it to land on her head, and leave Chase on his back, laughing at Cali's misfortune as the story ends."

Later, Cap'n Turbot is lost at sea when a deep fog rolls in.",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],['car'],[],"Pup Pup Boogie:

The story starts with Chase bumping into Ryder at the top of the Lookout and asking about the new Pup Pup Boogie 2 that was coming out today. Chase asks Skye if she's playing the all-new Pup Pup Boogie, but she says she's playing the old version. Chase joins the game, but gets all the steps wrong. He asks Skye how she does it, and Skye explains that when she starts a new move, she puts her front paw in front and puts her back paw on the side. Chase gives it a try, then he gets the hang of it. After they finish dancing, Skye and Chase are tired and out of breath. They go outside the Lookout to have a water break. Marshall and Rubble come running up to them to ask if the new Pup Pup Boogie has been delivered. Marshall does a tail spin, but ends up landing on Ryder. Ryder's pup-pad rings; it is Mayor Goodway. She panics and tells Ryder that a train carriage has derailed and if they don't hurry, the train which is bringing the all new Pup Pup Boogie game won't be able to enter the station. Ryder calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout.

After Zuma's foul-up on the roundabout at the playground when he's trying to race Rocky, the pups all arrive in the elevator, yet Marshall attempts another tail spin, but ends up spinning out of the elevator and smacking into the entrance doors to the Lookout. He quickly recovers and gets back in the elevator just in time to head up to get their briefing.

Ryder tells the PAW Patrol what happened, but when he first loads up the briefing, he accidentally runs a playback of Chase and Skye's earlier Pup Pup Boogie replay, causing Marshall to dance a little bit. Marshall apologizes, but Ryder is impressed by how much he's practiced. Once Ryder gets the briefing up, Chase mentions that the new Pup Pup Boogie is coming on the next train, causing Marshall to go into another dance fit before he realizes his mistake and apologizes and ensures he's done dancing now. Ryder chooses Chase to come to pull the derailed carriage off the tracks, and for Rubble to remove the old rails and bring in new ones. Ryder slides down the fire pole to his ATV while Rubble and Chase go down the slide to their vehicles.

When they arrive at the train station, Ryder tells Chase to remove the carriage. Once that is done, Rubble checks the broken train tracks. He jumps, slips, and sprains his paw. With Rubble injured, Ryder attempts to call Mr. Hudson and warn him. Unfortunately, the running of the train is too noisy for Mr. Hudson to hear the ringing, and Mr. Hudson's elbow, along with the vibrating ring, knock the phone off the windowsill of the locomotive.

At Katie's Pet Parlor, Rubble's paw is bandaged, but with him under orders from Katie to stay off it and ice it, until it heals, Rubble suggests that Ryder drive his rig instead. Ryder can't do that, as he's too big, so Chase is chosen to drive it instead. However, Chase can't remember the instructions he is told by Ryder, and soon panics when he starts pressing controls in a frightened state. Once he calms down and mentions how it is like how he couldn't remember the steps in Pup Pup Boogie, Ryder has Chase turn on the radio to the Pup Pup Boogie music, and with its help, Chase soon gets the hang of it, and clears the wrecked rails and ties from the railroad crossing. Ryder handles the hard labor of laying down the new rails, and the track is fixed just in time. Mr. Hudson delivers the game, and everyone returns to the Lookout to watch Chase and Skye go at it in head-to-head competition. Marshall has another one of his wild tail spins, and crashes into Mayor Goodway. Marshall apologizes, and the story ends with Mayor Goodway laughing with Marshall as they rub heads while the Pup Pup Boogie is refrained one last time.

Pups in a Fog:

The pups are preparing for a sleep-out under the stars. Zuma is busy enjoying the bag of treats the pups have with them, while Marshall and Rubble play tug-of-war with one of the pillows. As for Chase, he is having a little trouble with his sleeping bag, as it keeps rolling back up from the free end that he doesn't have his weight on. It only gets worse when Rubble pups knocks into him when Marshall calls dibs on the final treat offers by Zuma, wrapping Chase up in his own sleeping bag, leaving him disappointed at the sleep-out being ruined for him, while the other pups laugh.

On the Lookout's balcony, Ryder watches the sunset, and the light from Cap'n Turbot's lighthouse on Seal Island come on. However, the light seems to be flickering and faltering. Concerned, Ryder checks through the Lookout's periscope, and watches as the light burns out completely. Worried, he calls Cap'n Turbot to let him know, but the Cap'n Turbot is currently out at sea on the Flounder when he gets Ryder's call. Worse, a heavy fog is rolling in, and without his lighthouse's beacon, Cap'n Turbot cannot even get home to Seal Island to replace it. To make things more problematic, Turbot knows that the MS Princess Maria cruise ship is due to head through Adventure Bay in an hour, and without the lighthouse, the ship could run aground on the rocks near Seal Island.

After the Captain has a moment of amnesia and forgets he had already called Ryder when he decides to call them and let them know, Turbot panics and gets himself stuck in a bucket. Ryder assures that the PAW Patrol are on their way, and Turbot walks away to continue his own business with a cheerful whistle.

As the pups are summoned to the Lookout, Chase is left to try and slither after them since he was still stuck in his sleeping bag, then hop after them into the elevator. Marshall gives the pups a good laugh after he sneezes up some feathers, and the pups are given their orders upon reaching the top: Ryder will head out with Zuma and Chase riding in Zuma's hovercraft to Seal Island and attempt to use Chase's light on his megaphone to substitute for the lighthouse's light until Cap'n Turbot can return to replace it, and prevent the Princess Maria from hitting the rocks. The other pups will need to try and stay awake in case Ryder needs backup.

While the pups do what they can to stay awake and not fall asleep, such as playing Marco Polo, Ryder, Chase, and Zuma find their way to Seal Island blocked by Wally the walrus. Despite their attempts to warn him that there is an emergency they need to get to, he only lets them pass once they give him a treat. When the PAW Patrol reach the lighthouse, the door is locked, and Cap'n Turbot has the keys with him personally back on the Flounder. Worse, the Princess Maria is now visible heading straight for Seal Island. With time running out, Ryder suggests having Chase fire his net under an open window for Ryder to use as a cargo net to climb up and into the lighthouse. Once inside, Ryder unlocks the door for Chase and Zuma, and they head for the top. When they get there, the Princess Maria's captain contacts them on the radio asking about the lighthouse's beacon. Ryder responds, and Chase gets his megaphone's light on just in the nick of time, allowing the captain and his crew to steer the Princess Maria clear of Seal Island. The captain sends his thanks and blows the ship's horn in gratitude, and Cap'n Turbot soon arrives home to replace the lighthouse beacon's bulb and thank Ryder for all his help.

Back at the Lookout, the other pups are about ready to doze off when Ryder, Chase, and Zuma return. Marshall speaks for all of them at how they stayed up in case Ryder needed them, and Skye can't wait to hear what happened. As Chase and Zuma let off tired yawns, Ryder goes to retrieve some sleep-out snacks for the pups to have as he tells them everything. When he returns, all the pups have fallen asleep, so he leaves the treats for them to have when they wake up. As the other pups sleep soundly, Ryder and Chase exchange a warm smile before dozing off themselves, Ryder wishing his pups goodnight as the camera pans upward to the star-filled sky."

The story starts with Marshall using the Lookout's periscope to look for a flock of geese, while below, Rubble and Rocky get the nest ready for the geese. Rocky having made the nest, while Rubble provides the fresh bread. Back in the Lookout, Ryder finally spots a flock for Marshall who, in his excitement, goes down the slide and crash-lands in the nest. He lets Rubble and Rocky know, and soon the geese arrive and take a liking to the nest and bread.

However, the youngest goose, a gosling with yellow feathers, wanders over into Skye's pup house, soon after, it gets a bucket on its head, leaving Marshall to help it out. The gosling takes a liking to Marshall, and Marshall names it ""Fuzzy"" in return. From that point on, Marshall and Fuzzy enjoy doing things together, good or bad with the outcome, until it is time for Fuzzy to go to sleep with his family. Fuzzy wants Marshall to sleep outside with him, and Fuzzy's mom agrees. However, during the night, Fuzzy wanders after a trail of bread crumbs, and disappears.

The next morning, Marshall and Fuzzy's family awaken to find him missing, and Marshall tells Ryder. Knowing that Fuzzy's flock have to leave soon to resume migrating, with or without him, Ryder summons the pups to help. Once he briefs them in the Lookout, and Marshall takes full responsibility for Fuzzy wandering off, Ryder passes out the orders: Chase and Marshall will help look for Fuzzy, while the rest of the pups remain at the Lookout on standby.

Once deployed, with no sign of Fuzzy upon calling him with a goose call through Chase's megaphone, they attempt to find him via one of his feathers. Chase picks up the scent, despite his allergies, and they head into town.

At the Train Station, Fuzzy looks for some food in the trash can, but a passerby offers a partially eaten piece of bread for Fuzzy. Although Fuzzy is grateful, two seagulls attempt to take it from him when he flies up to the roof of the train station. In the struggle, one of the seagulls leave a discarded plastic soda can ring from a six-pack of soda cans wrapped around Fuzzy's midsection, pinning his wings to the sides of his body. Despite that, Fuzzy attempts to take his bread back, but one of the seagulls refuses to let him.

Below, Ryder, Chase, and Marshall finally track Fuzzy to the station, and upon hearing and seeing him in trouble, Marshall goes to get his ladder, while the seagull that was fighting Fuzzy for the bread chases it to the ground. Chase arrests the seagull with his net, while the second seagull flees after knocking Fuzzy off-balance and having him on the verge of falling. Luckily, Marshall saves Fuzzy with his helmet, Ryder removes the plastic soda can ring so Fuzzy's wings are free, and they head back to the Lookout so Fuzzy can migrate with his family.

However, Fuzzy has developed such a bond with Marshall, he doesn't want to leave him. Ryder and Marshall both know that Fuzzy belongs with his family, so they have Marshall airlifted by Skye in her helicopter to help convince Fuzzy to fly and rejoin his family. It works, and Fuzzy rejoins his flock and leaves with them. Marshall is happy to see Fuzzy leave with his family, but also saddened that he might not see him again for a while.

Afterwards, as Marshall and the other pups celebrate another job well done with some jump-roping, Marshall is surprised to see Chickaletta joining him, and in his distraction, missteps and ends up tied up in the jump-rope. The story ends as everyone laughs at how birds really like Marshall.

Pup Pup and Away:

The story begins with Mayor Goodway questioning why she would agree to enter a hot air balloon race against mayors from other towns. She stands inside the basket of her balloon, covering her eyes and fears going at too high an altitude or velocity before Ryder reminds her that she is still on the ground. Mayor Goodway mentions conquering her fear of heights, and is consoled at the thought that Ryder will be there to help her fly the balloon during the race.

Getting the hot air balloon prepared, Ryder asks Chase and Rubble to unroll the envelope. After doing so, Chase spots a gaping hole in the balloon and informs everyone that it will not be able to fly. At this news, Mayor Goodway is resentful and loathes the likelihood of Mayor Humdinger of Foggy Bottom winning the annual race for another consecutive year. Ryder assures her that the balloon will be ready in time, and summons the PAW Patrol to the Lookout. The other pups, who were participating in a hurdles sprint race against each other (refereed by Rocky), begin a new race to the Lookout after being contacted. Chase, Rubble, Rocky, and Zuma all get wedged simultaneously between the elevator doors, with Skye joining them a moment afterward. Marshall soon arrives and knocks them all into the elevator before it ascends.

Up in the observatory, Ryder explains the situation to the pups and the significance of getting the hot air balloon ready to race. He calls on Rocky to find a fitting patch to cover the rip in the balloon, and Marshall to ensure that there are no gas leaks in the burner. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy and head to City Hall.

After arriving at City Hall, Ryder hurries the pups to get the hot air balloon prepared as quickly as possible since the race is about to begin. Rocky quickly examines the tear in the envelope and immediately goes to grab a patch from his recycling truck. In the meantime, Marshall sniffs around the gas tank and confirms that no leaks are present. Ryder tests the flame - which is in functional order - and Rocky glues a patch over the rip in the envelope. With everything in working condition, the balloon is inflated and Mayor Goodway is thrilled with their success.

Seeing other hot air balloons about to cross the starting line at Farmer Yumi's silo, Ryder turns off the flame and leaves to grab his flying gear. While Marshall and Rocky follow Ryder, Mayor Goodway enters the basket and psyches herself up for the race using positively reinforcing statements. However, while doing so, she accidentally ignites the flame and the hot air balloon begins to take off. Rocky and Marshall observe Mayor Goodway's balloon taking flight and attempt to grab onto a rope hanging from the basket (to weigh the balloon down). Marshall manages to bite onto the rope, but is carried upward with it. Ryder, now with his flight gear on, notices and runs after the balloon, catching Marshall when he loses his grip on the rope. Still rising, Mayor Goodway shouts frantically to Ryder for help.

Back at the Lookout, Skye and Chase use the periscope to watch the race, but realize that Adventure Bay's balloon is not among those of the other participants. Skye is then called by Ryder via her pup-tag and asked to help get him into the hot air balloon alongside Mayor Goodway.

In the air, Mayor Goodway builds up the courage to uncover her eyes. Just in time to avoid hitting Farmer Yumi's silo, she unties a sandbag from the hot air balloon (allowing it to rise over the structure). In the process, a chicken that was on top of the silo jumps into the basket. Mayor Goodway immediately adores the chicken and places it in her open purse. Not far ahead, the pilot of Mayor Humdinger's balloon points out that his lead is slight to Mayor Goodway. Mayor Humdinger expresses his surprise and commands his pilot to fly as fast as possible.

At the Lookout, Ryder secures a harness to himself and attaches it to Skye's helicopter using a cable. They take to the sky and Ryder shortly finds Adventure Bay's balloon as it heads toward Seal Island. In the hot air balloon, Mayor Goodway is still terrified, and continues to cower and cover her eyes despite seeing Ryder on the way. Skye catches up to the balloon and swings Ryder over to the basket on her second attempt, with Mayor Goodway helping him in. With Ryder now beside her, Mayor Goodway is eager for the flight, and Skye flies to the finish line, wishing the two luck. Ryder soon notices their balloon's impending collision with the lighthouse on Seal Island and increases the flame to ascend above it. Afterward, he and the mayor focus their attention on the race, though they are well behind the other participating balloons.

Meanwhile, Mayor Humdinger uses a telescope to observe his lagging competition, and begins to gloat of Foggy Bottom's upcoming victory. He is soon shocked and dumbfounded to realize that he is being passed by Mayor Goodway. Angered by the competitive taunts shouted by Mayor Goodway, Mayor Humdinger yells at his pilot to overtake the Adventure Bay balloon. Ryder and Mayor Goodway then spot Jake's mountain approaching (on the other side of which is the finish line), and Ryder suggests rising in the air to be pushed by stronger winds. Mayor Goodway agrees and is exhilarated at the thought of winning the race. Behind them, Mayor Humdinger is frantic to catch up to them.

As the two balloons approach the finish line, the pups (among other Adventure Bay citizens), stand cheering for Ryder and Mayor Goodway at the foot of the mountain. Mayor Goodway herself gets cocky just before being overtaken by Mayor Humdinger. Ryder states that they will have to drop quickly in order to win, and Mayor Goodway is supportive of the decision. In a close finish, the Adventure Bay balloon manages to break the finishing ribbon first, and lands in the designated spot. All of the spectators celebrate, and Mayor Humdinger contemptuously awards Ryder and Mayor Goodway with the race's trophy. Mayor Goodway passes the trophy to Ryder and the PAW Patrol for their significant involvement in the victory, and a barbecue is held at City Hall for the celebration.

At the barbecue, everyone is fed with burgers made by Mr. Porter, and Mayor Goodway thanks Ryder for his help. In the presence of Mayor Humdinger, Mayor Goodway also informs Ryder that she signed up for the Mayor's Submarine Race, and asks him to be her captain. Mayor Humdinger laughs and arrogantly states that Foggy Bottom will win the race as it had the previous year. The two mayors then comment back and forth about their predicted victories, while Ryder chuckles at the silliness of their rivalry."

Everyone thinks it's a ""snow monster"" and it's scaring the skiers away.",[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],['snow'],[],"Pups on Ice:

As the story begins, Marshall is attempting to do some jump-rope rhyming when he is interrupted as it starts to snow. When the pups ask Ryder if they can go snowboarding, especially Rubble, Ryder agrees, much to the pups' joy.

Up at Jake's Mountain, Jake is about to take Alex on his first snowboarding lesson, but Alex is too excited to listen, and ends up sliding down the hill in the wrong direction due to not following Jake's instructions. As Jake gives chase, Alex soon is transferred from his snowboard to the rescue sled and goes beyond the safety fence. Jake is able to catch up and stop them before they head over a steep cliff, but Alex, in his excitement over Jake's heroic act, jumps, and causes them to regain some forward momentum, sending Jake and Alex over the cliff, and trapping them on a ledge just underneath, unable to climb back up, or snowboard down as it is too dangerous. As Alex realizes his error and apologizes for screwing up, Jake decides to call Ryder to see if he is up for a little mountain rescue.

At the Lookout, Ryder is trying to catch snowflakes on his tongue, when he gets Jake's call. Once Jake shows where he and Alex are, Ryder assures him that they are on their way, and calls the pups. Marshall is unable to get his paws free of his snowboard, and flies into the elevator, crashing into the pups. After sheepishly apologizing, and seeing that he wasn't stuck anymore, Marshall and the others head up and learn of the situation from Ryder. Skye and Chase will join Ryder on the rescue mission, while the rest of the pups get their snowboarding gear together to meet them up on the slopes for some snowboarding after Jake and Alex are safe. With that, the PAW Patrol deploys, and heads to the summits.

Back with Jake and Alex, Jake offers some refreshment to Alex while they wait for the PAW Patrol. Soon, Jake hears Skye, but when she tries to get close enough to try and airlift Jake and Alex to safety, the wind from her helicopter causes several large icicles to come loose and nearly skewer Jake and Alex as they impale the ground around them. With Skye fearing she might cause an avalanche, Ryder has her back off and regroup with him and Chase. As they wonder what to do now, Ryder has an idea. Calling Jake, he asks if Jake can snowboard down himself after Ryder gets Alex to safety. Jake agrees, and using the cable from Skye's helicopter, in conjunction with Chase's winch cable, Ryder is able to rappel down to Jake and Alex, while Skye relays directions to him from her helicopter.

Soon, Ryder makes it down, and makes sure that Alex does just as he says so they make it back up safely. Alex, having learned his lesson, agrees, and while Jake waits for word that Alex is safe before he heads down, Ryder and Alex start to climb back up. Unfortunately, Chase's winch gets jammed between some rocks, so Ryder and Alex will have to climb up the rest of the way, hand-over-hand, themselves. However, a large patch of slippery ice prevents them from getting any further, until Chase offers his net as a cargo ladder to climb up and over it. Skye soon regroups with the others as Ryder and Alex are safe, and Jake calls to confirm the mission was successful. Ryder gives him the all-clear, and with a cry of ""Yee-Haw!"", Jake easily snowboards down to safety himself.

Back at Jake's cabin, he brings hot cocoa for Ryder and Alex, and Alex thanks Ryder for his help. Afterwards, Alex asks Jake for another chance to snowboard now that he has learned to listen before doing anything, and Jake gives Alex a second chance. Ryder even adds on to wait until the rest of the pups arrive, then they can snowboard together, much to Alex's delight.

Soon the rest of the pups arrive, and everyone enjoys the ski slopes, ending the story as Jake, Alex, Ryder, and the pups snowboard down the hill with a round of excited cheers.

Pups and the Snow Monster:

The story starts with the pups still enjoying the winter weather, with Rubble hoping they can still enjoy Adventure Bay Snow Day, especially up on Jake's Mountain.

Speaking of Jake's Mountain, the skiers and snowboarders are fleeing due to rumors of the legendary Adventure Bay Snow Monster having surfaced. Alex even took pictures of the monster tracks, and a video of him actually encountering the beast, which roars at Alex and sends him running for his life. Worrying for the safety of everyone, and as owner of the slopes, fearing he will have to close the mountain permanently, Jake calls Ryder for help.

At the Lookout, Ryder receives Jake's call, and as Jake worries about having to close the slopes indefinitely, Ryder assures him that the PAW Patrol will come up to investigate, and calls the pups. When they arrive, one look at Alex's video leaves all the pups spooked, but Ryder makes sure that they are still able to help. Ryder has Chase and Rubble join him on the mission as Chase can catch the monster in his net, and Rubble might need to do some bulldozing with the snow if needed. With that, the PAW Patrol deploys to the mountains.

Ryder converts his ATV to snowmobile mode, while Chase, after getting snowbound in his truck, follows Rubble as he clears a path with his rig. Once they reach Jake's office, they then set off to investigate the monster sightings. Chase rides with Ryder, while Rubble snowboards down. When they start to investigate, Rubble seems to be scared already, and a distant roar from the monster spooks all of them slightly, but they continue the search. Soon, the PAW Patrol find tracks, and a branch full of berries, indicating that the monster likes berries. Another, much closer roar sends Rubble and Chase leaping into Ryder's arms for safety, but he quickly gets the pups back on the case. Chase soon finds the scent of the monster to be very close by, and another roar, much closer than before, has Rubble cowering, that is, until he sees the monster's snout standing right next to Ryder, and warns him that he is right next to it. Chase acts quickly, but in his rush, he nets Ryder by accident before explaining that the monster was right next to him. Several more roars cause Ryder, Chase, and Rubble to get a good look at the monster, just like Alex had shown on his cellphone, and all three run for their lives.

When they get a better look at the monster, Ryder suddenly notices that the monster has a familiar tail that quickly recedes into its body, before it is revealed that the monster is actually Bettina, Garbie, and Chickaletta, stacked on top of each other. The footprints were caused by the boots that Bettina had gotten stuck on her feet, with Chickaletta adding in the smaller toe-like markings with her own feet. As Ryder prepares to bring the animals back to show Jake, a sneeze from Chase caused by his allergies from Chickaletta's feathers sends the animals fleeing, emitting the noise that sounded like the monster's roar. It was just a combination of Bettina's mooing, Garbie's bleating, and Chickaletta's clucking.

Back at Jake's cabin, Ryder reveals the truth to him, and soon Farmer Yumi and Mayor Goodway arrive to reprimand their animals for wandering off. With the mystery solved, Ryder reminds Mayor Goodway and Farmer Yumi to yelp for help if any of their animals wander off again and gives Jake the all-clear to reopen the slopes, and Rubble is ecstatic that Adventure Bay Snow Day is back on.

While Jake and Rubble enjoy the slopes and snowboard, the other pups work on a snowman, only for Marshall to lose control on the snow and crash into it, getting the snowman's head stuck over his own again. The story ends as the others laugh, and Marshall happily replies, albeit a bit muffled with a chuckle himself, ""I'm OK."""
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3141284/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,Ellie the baby elephant has escaped from the circus train. Mayor Goodway's purse chicken has gone missing.,[],TV-Y,Release date,['Jamie Whitney'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Pups Save the Circus:

The story beings with the pups and Ryder helping Raimundo, Eunice, and Ellie take down the big top and load it into the train. Once the equipment is packed up, Eunice and Ellie board their boxcar, Ryder gives Ellie some peanuts to eat, and the train sets off until the next time the circus comes to Adventure Bay.

Back at the Lookout, the pups are busy practicing their own circus acts, when Ryder receives a call from Alex, asking for help on a missing barrel of peanuts. Thinking a missing barrel of peanuts is not that much of an emergency, Ryder gets another call, this time from Raimundo. Unfortunately, Ellie had somehow escaped from the boxcar, and was heading back towards Adventure Bay. Eunice is very worried for her baby, and so is Raimundo, fearing for Eunice being so agitated over her missing daughter. Knowing that this is an emergency in need of the PAW Patrol, Ryder agrees to help, and calls the pups.

Marshall has his usual goof-up when he accidentally flings Rubble and Skye into the elevator due to them still stacked on each other when getting Ryder's call. Once in the tower, Ryder figures that since Ellie loves peanuts, they can use those to lure her back to Eunice and Raimundo. While Ryder and Chase go to see Alex, guessing the missing barrel of peanuts was Ellie's doing, Rocky heads around behind the Lookout to put together a device for luring her back to the circus train.

Chase and Ryder have little luck finding Ellie using the trail of eaten peanut shells from Mr. Porter's, but Rocky's arrival with his peanut dispenser will make finding Ellie much easier. That is, until Raimundo calls with more bad news. Before he can finish telling Ryder to look out for Eunice, the panic-stricken mother elephant is already stampeding down the street, looking for her baby. With two elephants missing from the circus, Ryder and Rocky go after Eunice, while Chase continues looking for Ellie.

Ryder and Rocky finally catch up to Eunice when she jams herself through one of the windows of Mayor Goodway's office at City Hall, sniffing the Mayor with her trunk to see if Ellie had been there. Using a handful of peanuts to get Eunice's attention, Ryder is able to lure her into following Rocky and his peanut dispenser all the way to Farmer Yumi's. Yumi and Raimundo are waiting to corral her in the barn, but Eunice is spooked by Bettina, forcing Ryder to mount Eunice and calm her down enough to guide her into the barn and finally rein her in. With Eunice safe for the time being, Ryder and Rocky head back into town to see if Chase has found Ellie yet.

When they return to Mr. Porter's, the PAW Patrol discover a broken ladder with the peanut shells, and find Ellie now on the roof, looking like she is ready to perform her circus act and jump off. Ryder is frantic, with Ellie ready to jump any second and be seriously hurt, he suddenly realizes the air mattress the pups were using earlier can be used as an air cushion for Ellie. Rocky has brought it in his truck, and Mr. Porter exhausts himself inflating it, while Ryder uses Chase's megaphone to stall Ellie by making her think he is announcing her act. With the mattress inflated and ready, Ryder gives Ellie her cue, and the baby elephant performs her jump and emerges unharmed, just as Raimundo and Eunice arrive, allowing mother and baby elephant to be reunited at last.

Back at the train platform, Raimundo thanks Ryder and the PAW Patrol for everything, and gives Ryder his ringmaster's hat as thanks as he and the elephants take off, this time, heading home to the circus' home base after such an exciting day in Adventure Bay.

Pup a Doodle Do:

The story starts off with Marshall and Skye playing Pup Pup Boogie 2 at the Lookout. Just then, Chickaletta arrives and starts playing the game as well. Mayor Goodway arrives to collect Chickaletta and tells the pups that they will be on the show Hello Adventure Bay.

Outside City Hall, Mayor Goodway is being taped. She turns her back to clean the statue of her Great Grandpa Grover Goodway when Chickaletta hops out of her purse and wanders off. Mayor Goodway gets worried and calls the PAW Patrol. Ryder deploys Chase and Marshall to search for the chicken, following Marshall pulling the pups into the elevator in another out-of-control tailspin before responding to Ryder's summon.

Ryder, Chase, and Marshall arrive at the city hall. Chase sniffs the purse and follows the scent all the while being followed by the camera crew of Hello Adventure Bay. Chase follows Chickaletta's scent to the lemonade shop where Chickaletta is on top of the milkshake straw statue eating a slice of pizza a seagull dropped there. Marshall ascends his firetruck ladder to reach Chickaletta, but she notices a bread truck drive by and flies onto it, being carried away by it, forcing Mayor Goodway, the cameraman, Ryder, and the PAW Patrol to pursue it.

The PAW Patrol and the camera crew follow the bread truck to Farmer Yumi's farm. Chickaletta has jumped in a pen full of other chickens, making her hard to find. There, Marshall and Chase tried unorthodox methods by making chicken sounds or asking a chicken who lives in a purse to step forward. Then Mayor Goodway arrives and fills in the biggest detail by telling them that Chickaletta wears an ankle bracelet, but anxiously opens the gate. Ryder warns her not to, but unfortunately too late, as all the chickens rush past Mayor Goodway as they exit the pen. They spot Chickaletta's ankle bracelet, but she takes off again riding on the back of Bettina, who's spooked by Mayor Goodway's shouts and Chickaletta riding on her back. Ryder and the crew go after Chickaletta while Chase and Marshall stay behind to round up the runaway chickens.

Chickaletta and Bettina arrive at the suspension bridge where Chickaletta flies up to the top to join some seagulls, making them confused. Mayor Goodway and Ryder arrive at the bridge and spot Chickaletta, at which point, Mayor Goodway attempts to call Chickaletta down to her by standing on the rail which worries Ryder. Mayor Goodway starts to lose her balance and begins to fall. Luckily, Chase grabs her with his net, but Chickaletta slowly descends down to the water where she can't swim. Ryder calls Zuma to head to the bridge.

Zuma in his hovercraft zooms to the bridge and launches his buoy where Chickaletta lands on it safely. Ryder recovers her, and back on the beach, Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta are reunited. Mayor Goodway apologizes for ruining the show, but the Hello Adventure Bay cameraman says this will be a great show having caught the entire operation.

At the end, the pups watch themselves on Hello Adventure Bay where Marshall asks Ryder why can't all their adventures be on TV. Ryder breaks the fourth wall by saying ""You never know, Marshall."" and looking at the camera as the story ends."

The story begins with the pups having some fun, while Ryder is working on his ATV. At Mr. Porter's cafe, Alex shows off his new super-trike to his grandfather. Mr. Porter is impressed by the huge use of duct tape his grandson used, along with the pizza paddles for brakes. However, when Alex attempts to break it in, it jumps the curb, and fall to pieces on impact with the sidewalk again. Alex is devastated, and his grandfather prevents him from trying to recover the pieces while they're in the street, fearing for his grandson's life. As Alex mourns the destruction of his super-trike, Mr. Porter decides to call Ryder for help.

At the Lookout, Ryder gets Mr. Porter's call. Mr. Porter knows about Ryder's handiwork with technology and asks that he lend Alex a hand repairing his super-trike. Ryder agrees and summons the pups. Once in the Lookout, Rocky is impressed by Alex's use of recycled parts, and is asked to help recover the parts so that they can repair the super-trike, maybe even make some improvements to it. Chase is tasked with securing the street so they can recover the pieces without traffic interfering. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy, arrive at Mr. Porter's, Chase secures the street, and Rocky starts the cleanup effort.

Later, back at the Lookout, Ryder is hard at work with Rocky's help in putting Alex's super-trike back together, replacing the pizza paddles used as brakes with bike pedals. Alex practices running around with his steering wheel, and nearly knocks over the recycle bin. Chase intervenes, and Alex apologizes. Once the final piece is put on Alex's super-trike, a bell to signal people, Alex is given his helmet and is ready to go.

Ryder suggests that Alex take it nice and slow, but Alex, in his excitement, pedals away faster than he should, forcing Ryder, Rocky, and Chase to give pursuit. Alex is soon so excited, he unintentionally takes his feet off the pedals. Without his feet to control them, the pedals accelerate on their own, and Alex soon finds himself speeding faster and faster down the Lookout's driveway towards the bridge, helpless to slow or stop himself. Excitement changes to fear as Alex is now scared for his life. Ryder catches up on his ATV and tries to help, but as Alex is too scared to attempt to regain control, a car is heading up the street towards the Lookout's driveway at the same time. Ryder has Chase speed ahead to roadblock the street with his truck, while he calls Skye back at the Lookout to lend him a hand with her helicopter in stopping Alex. With Skye's help, Alex is finally stopped, but it is clear he knows he messed up big time. Only when Ryder talks to him in a stern tone does Alex know he should have taken it slow and steady first, before going faster. He apologizes and thanks the pups for all their help, but when Ryder suggests heading over to get some lemonade, Alex is quick to want to speed on over quickly. Only when he gets stern looks from Skye, Rocky, and Chase does Alex realize his error in forgetting the lesson he just learned and agrees to head on over at a more favorable speed.

Once there, Alex is awarded a trophy that doubles as an ice cream sundae cup, much to his joy as the pups and Ryder all laugh to end the story.

Pups Fight Fire:

Marshall is going to try to break the World's Fastest Fire-Pup record, which currently stands at 10 minutes. The course is made-up of an obstacle course, rescuing a stuffed cat in a tree, putting out a fake fire, and ringing the City Hall bell. But during the practice run with rescuing Cali, Marshall breaks his ladder. Now he loses confidence in himself that his clumsiness will get in the way of his performance. Ryder realizes that Marshall needs encouragement and help to fix his ladder. Calling the pups to the Lookout, Ryder reveals that Marshall is their emergency this time.

Rocky is to help find something to help repair the broken rungs on Marshall's ladder, while Marshall just has to stay focused on the competition and ignore anything else. With a catchphrase of ""Do my best, and forget the rest"", Marshall accepts, and they head down to begin repairs to Marshall's fire truck.

Rocky finds a broom they can cut into pieces to use as new rungs to repair the ladder, and they soon have it fixed, just as Mayor Goodway calls asking about Marshall. With the ladder fixed, and Marshall panting excitedly, Ryder tells Mayor Goodway that they are on their way, then contacts Chase for a police escort for Marshall. Chase races ahead to block the intersection to let Marshall through, and soon the citizens, including Mr. Porter and Alex, head off to watch Marshall, cheering him on. At the starting line, the Hello Adventure Bay cameraman is waiting for Marshall, and Mayor Goodway is growing nervous and worried. Luckily, Marshall makes it, and the competition goes live. While Marshall repeats his catchphrase, Mayor Goodway reveals that if Marshall can complete the course in 10 minutes and ring the City Hall bell in time, he'll be the fastest fire-pup ever.

Marshall makes good time with the first parts of the competition, save for getting his foot caught in the tires and saying his trusty ""I'm good!"" catchphrase to the camera, but when he reaches the beach and puts out the fire for the competition, things go bad.

As Marshall hurries to finish the course and ring the bell, the cameraman accidentally knocks over a stage light, causing it to short out, and a spark from it ignites the lifeguard's chair. As Mayor Goodway and the cameraman evacuate, Marshall's firefighting instincts take over, and he puts the fire out before it can spread. Mayor Goodway is grateful, but Marshall fears it has cost him the competition. Ryder says he still has 30 seconds left, and with the pups and citizens cheering him on, Marshall goes for it.

Marshall reaches City Hall and uses his ladder to reach the bell quickly, but when he asks how he did, Mayor Goodway sadly announces that Marshall lost by one minute. Despite Marshall failing to win the competition, Mayor Goodway still awards him the trophy for being the Greatest Fire Pup in the World due to his heroism with sacrificing the competition to put out a real fire. Marshall is speechless, and is allowed a chance to circle the area in front of City Hall as everyone cheers for him, soon revealing to be playback of the competition on the Lookout TV, while Marshall beams with his new trophy.

Soon after, Rubble announces the upcoming competition for Fastest Construction Pup, and as he and the other pups race off, Marshall trips following after them, ending the story with Marshall's regular catchphrase: ""I'm good!"""

The story begins with the pups enjoying the winter weather with making a snowman, although there is the problem of Marshall crashing into it and getting the head section stuck on his own head.

In town, Mr. Porter and Alex load up the van with the pups' food and treats to take up to the Lookout. Mr. Porter nearly loses his lucky hat when it is blown off by the wind, but Alex catches it. Alex is also worried when his grandfather slips on some ice and falls on his bottom. Luckily, Mr. Porter is fine, and admits it will take more than a ""rump bump"" to hurt him. With that, they head up to the Lookout, but Mr. Porter has a difficult time driving up due to the slippery driveway, yet he manages to park the van with the rear doors facing Ryder's garage. Unfortunately, the doors are frozen shut from the cold, and his attempts to open them lead to the van sliding downhill and landing on the ice that has frozen over the shore area of the bay. Worse, the ice is too thin, and begins to give way, submerging the front bumper of the van into the bay. Mr. Porter and Alex are horrified. If the van goes down, the pups' food and treats will be lost. They immediately call Ryder to let him know.

Ryder is busy playing video-games on his pup-pad when he gets the call. Once he does, Ryder checks the situation out via the periscope, then calls the pups. Rubble is having fun with the other pups, when his stomach rumbles, indicating his starvation for Mr. Porter's food, before the pups get Ryder's summon. Once the pups are topside, Ryder shows them the situation, and they are just as horrified as the Porters. Even Rubble has to excuse another rumble from his stomach, saying that it is just worried for the van. Knowing they have to get the van secured and tow it back onto dry land, Ryder selects Chase and Zuma to help with the rescue, and they quickly deploy down to meet up with the Porters. Alex repeats the situation to Ryder in panic before Ryder reminds him of why the PAW Patrol is there, much to Alex's embarrassment, and Mr. Porter is left unsure as to how Ryder can help. Ryder reveals he can hook the winch from Chase's truck onto his ATV, convert it to hovercraft mode, drive it out to the van, hook the winch on, and then Chase can reel it in.

Everything works fine at first, but as soon as Ryder secures the winch, the ice begins to crack and break up. Ryder tries to get back to his ATV quickly, but the separating ice causes his ATV to drift away, out of reach. Knowing he can't risk jumping without a chance of getting hypothermia, Ryder has Zuma shoot him his buoy as an anchor so Zuma can pull Ryder back to his ATV, allowing Ryder to get some ice surfing in. Just as Ryder's ice floe finally breaks in two, Ryder is able to somersault off, and land perfectly back in the seat of his ATV. He and Zuma return to shore, where Alex is relieved to see Ryder is OK, and Chase hauls Mr. Porter's van back to safety. After Mr. Porter has another close call losing his lucky hat, the PAW Patrol return to the Lookout so the pups can eat and get their treats.

Once the pups are all fed, Rubble offers another rumble from his stomach as a thank you to Mr. Porter and Alex, leaving them and Ryder to laugh as the other pups play in the snow to end the story.

Pups Get a Lift:

The story begins with Rocky and Rubble helping unload produce from Mr. Porter's van. As they wonder what Mr. Porter is cooking up for them, Rocky discovers some rotten bananas in one of the crates. While Rubble is disgusted at seeing them, Rocky tosses them into the recycle bin, knowing that rotten fruit makes great compost. Rubble retrieves the last crate, but puts it down lopsided, causing it to spill its contents of oranges all over the sidewalk. Unfortunately, Mr. Porter comes out of his cafe at that point to give Rubble and Rocky fresh-cooked meatballs for their hard work and slips on one of the oranges. The meatballs go flying, but while Mr. Porter catches one on the plate, the other plops down on his head, much to Rubble and Rocky's amusement.

At the Lookout, Chase and Ryder are practicing kicking the soccer ball against the garage door when Ryder gets a call from Jake up at the ski slopes. There's a problem with the chairlift up at the mountain as it has broken down. Jake has managed to evacuate everyone off but Katie and Cali, who are stranded. Cali lets off a mournful meow, causing Chase to recoil and whine at seeing Cali stuck like that. Ryder gives Chase a good scratch to cheer him up, and then asks if Katie is alright. Katie assures she's fine, but Cali is getting cold. Jake asks if the PAW Patrol can help out, and as Ryder says the PAW Patrol motto, Chase smiles proudly, and Ryder summons the pups.

At Mr. Porter's, Rubble and Rocky get the call and set off, but not before Rubble returns to pick up the pups' meatballs as a treat from Mr. Porter. As for Mr. Porter, he slips on another orange and ends up stuck in the recycle bin, making a fruit joke about it.

At the Lookout, Rubble is second-to-last to enter the elevator, but drops the bag containing the pups' meatballs. When he attempts to retrieve it, in runs Marshall with a howl, crashing into Rubble, and sending the bag flying, spilling the meatballs down towards the pups. One by one, they each catch a meatball in their mouth, and Marshall decides this is the most delicious wipe-out he's ever had, earning laughs from everyone. Once topside, Ryder tells the pups of the situation on Jake's Mountain. However, Rubble seems the most interested due to his love of snowboarding, and hopes that Ryder will pick him for the mission. To Rubble's disappointment, Ryder chooses Rocky and Marshall for the rescue, and sets off without him.

At Jake's Mountain, Marshall can't get his firetruck down to help Katie and Cali as the slope is too steep. Deciding now is when they need Rubble's help, Ryder calls back to the Lookout. Meanwhile, Rubble is busy voicing his disappointment to Chase and Skye, while Zuma takes a nap, when Ryder's call comes in. Rubble first thinks that Ryder needs Skye and her helicopter, but once he realizes that Ryder asked for his help, his spirits are lifted so much, Rubble accidentally minces up his catchphrase before recovering and is happy he is going to Jake's Mountain. The other pups cheer for Rubble as he deploys and heads for the ski slopes.

Back at the chairlift, Rocky finds the cause of the breakdown, one of the wheels that the cable runs across has come loose and fallen off. Jake is impressed, but reminds them that they need to first get everyone off, then they can start repairs.

At Jake's cabin, Rubble finally arrives, and Marshall escorts him to where he is needed. However, Marshall lands on a spare snowboard, is sent flying, and has to try and steer through the obstacle course of speed bumps on the slope. He can't and is soon dismounted, wrapped up in a snowball, and left rolling down the slope until he crashes into one of the support poles for the chairlift. Marshall is uninjured, but Katie and Cali are starting to shiver as they start to succumb to hypothermia and frostbite from the cold. Rubble soon arrives on his own snowboard to check on Marshall, and they are soon joined by Ryder on his. Ryder then suggests making a snow staircase to help Katie and Cali down. Rubble is quick to get right to work, and within a short while, a nice stack of snow blocks have been stacked up to the chair where Katie and Cali are. Ryder offers to help them down, and while Katie is very grateful and hops down to join Ryder, Cali takes another look at the long way down from the chair, and panics, jumping onto Katie's helmet, then trying to grab hold of the chair again. Her grip slips, and she bounces down the snow stairs, right towards Marshall. Ryder gives Marshall the heads-up, and despite Marshall attempting to catch Cali, she crashes into him, and sends both of them rolling down the slope in another snowball, crashing into the chairlift support once more. As Katie and Ryder run down to check on them, Cali hops happily into Katie's arms, showing she's alright, while Marshall admits that he's fine too, but he's not much of a snow pup, earning laughs from the kids.

Later, Rocky is repairing the wheel to the chairlift from Marshall's ladder and restoring it to full operational mode while Katie thanks Ryder and the pups for coming to her and Cali's aid. Ryder is grateful that Katie yelped for help, earning a happy purr and cheers of agreement from Cali, Marshall, and Rubble, respectively. Soon, Rocky has finished repairs, and Jake asks who wants to try out the chairlift now that it's fixed. Rubble is first to volunteer out of pure joy at being able to snowboard, and Ryder is more than willing to give Rubble his wish, saying that they are all good pups, earning additional cheers from Marshall and Cali. With that, Rubble takes off, and soon everyone is snowboarding down the slopes. At one point, Rubble and Ryder launch off a jump, performing perfect flips in the air before landing. Marshall and Cali try the same thing, but can't stabilize their boards for landing, leading to them each being encased in another snowball and rolling down into the chairlift support pole again. When they emerge, the snow on their heads makes Cali look like Skye, and Marshall like Chase, leading to laughter from them, and the others, as the story ends."

Ryder helps Skye with her costume, Chase works the decorations, and Rocky and Rubble work on a very large jack o' lantern.

Meanwhile, over at the dock near the beach, Cap'n Turbot is preparing to take Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, Katie, Cali, Mr. Porter, and Alex on a haunted ghost ship ride. Cali however, is angry at how Chickaletta is wearing the same costume as her, but Chickaletta is not bothered by it. The other costumes have Cap'n Turbot wearing a squid on his head, Katie as a witch, Mayor Goodway dressed as a ladybug, Alex as a frog, and Mr. Porter as a clown.

At the Lookout, the pups are scared by Marshall as he appears in his pumpkin-themed costume for going trick-or-treating. Each of the pups are dressed up differently: Rocky as a Viking, Skye as a princess, Chase as a superhero, Zuma as a pirate, and Rubble as Elvis. Ryder is dressed up as a knight so he can go trick-or-treating with the pups as well.

Back at the dock, trouble is brewing on the ghost ship. Wally keeps snatching the Halloween cookies Mr. Porter baked up right out from under Mr. Porter and Mayor Goodway's noses and devouring them when they aren't looking, and Cali raises the sails by accident chasing a seagull. Soon the ship has set sailed, and Cap'n Turbot loses his glasses attempting to swim after it to catch up. Chickaletta unknowingly keeps steering the ship as she jumps back and forth on the ship's wheel due to being amused by it turning back and forth on its own, which also causes the ship to sway as well. Mayor Goodway does her best to maintain confidence and no belief in ghosts, but a mysterious groaning has her freaking out anyhow. Mr. Porter decides the only option left is to call the PAW Patrol, and phones Ryder as the pups are continuing their trick-or-treating.

When Ryder gets the mayday call, he calls the pups to the Lookout, where Marshall crashes into the other pups like bowling pins. Marshall tries to make light of what happened with a couple of jokes, but none of the pups laugh, forcing Marshall to flat out tell them that they should just get topside and get their orders before the pups chew him out for his puns. That decision the pups don't argue with and are all smiles afterwards as they head up. When they're suited up, everyone, except for Skye, are still wearing the headgear for their costumes. Skye had to switch her princess hat for her pilot's cap and goggles.

When they arrive, Ryder passes out the following orders: Marshall will be airlifted by Skye to the ship to lower the sails, while Zuma joins Ryder with catching up on the water. The team deploys, and despite him still wearing his costume, Ryder is still able to deploy his life jacket underneath his armor before he and Zuma hit the water, without causing any damage to either his costume or his life jacket.

When they catch up to the ship, Skye is able to get Marshall into the crow's nest, allowing him to lower the rear sail, but there's still the matter of the ship's rocking caused by Chickaletta working the ship's wheel. Ryder manages to grab hold of the ladder after setting his ATV on auto-pilot, but Zuma is unable to jump the distance from his hovercraft to grab Ryder's hand and falls into the water. He manages to recover via his Pup Pack and rejoin Ryder to resume climbing aboard. Once Ryder, Marshall, and Zuma are aboard the ship, it is not long before they find the sources for the ship being so-called ""haunted"":

They find Chickaletta manning the ship's wheel and recover her, ending the ship's swaying.

The eerie groans coming from behind some barrels is actually Wally the Walrus, having dozed off after pigging out on Mr. Porter's Halloween cookies.

When one of the sails is raised again by Cali's attempts to catch a seagull once more, she's caught red-handed this time, much to Katie's bemusement.

As for Cap'n Turbot's missing glasses, Ryder soon points out that they're in his back pocket. With the mysteries solved, the ship is brought back to the beach and properly moored so it doesn't take off again. However, before everyone can enjoy the party, more eerie moaning convinces everyone to abandon ship and refuse to go back aboard, faking seasickness to get the pets and Alex off. Luckily, Ryder convinces everyone to return to the Lookout to have their party there instead.

Back at the Lookout, everyone enjoys themselves. Ryder gives the pups some of the cookies that Wally did not eat, Alex plays Pin the Tail with Katie and the adults, and Rocky and Zuma spook Skye as she asks about where her prince is. Everyone is enjoying themselves until Rocky sees something and howls at the moon, leading to the rest of the pups doing the same, as they notice a ghost version of the ship floating through the sky. Everyone is amazed, if not a little spooked, and are truly in awe over the excitement they've all had for Halloween, be it either trick-or-treating, solving a mystery on a ghost ship, or even seeing a real ghost ship as it floats across the night sky in front of the full moon."

With the aid of Marshall's ladder, they're able to decorate the upper parts of the tree as they sing their own version of ""Deck the Halls"" while they do so. Skye adds the star on top via her pup-pack. Afterwards, the pups retire to bed.

That night, a storm looks to be blowing in as the pups are tracking Santa via radar, but upon seeing the storm, grow worried, but Ryder is confident Santa will make it through the storm no problem. The pups are excited and want to stay up to see Santa, but Ryder doubts they can. He's soon proven right when most of them fall asleep, and soon, Marshall joins them.

Outside, Santa is struggling through the storm, when he brushes against the tree tops and loses his presents, nicks the roof of Farmer Yumi's barn, causing him to lose the Christmas star that keeps his sleigh and reindeer airborne, and soon crashes into the snow, where the reindeer run off in fright, much to his frustration and sadness.

Back at the Lookout, Ryder is watching the radar, when Santa's beacon is lost in the blizzard. His pup-pad soon rings, and as he wonders who it could be, it is revealed to be Santa himself, asking for Ryder's help. Without the presents, the Christmas star, or the reindeer, Christmas will have to be canceled since Santa will be unable to complete his trip. Ryder is horrified, but when Santa reminds him of the PAW Patrol motto of ""No job is too big, no pup is too small,"" Ryder is ready to help and summons the pups.

Once topside, the pups are still sleepy, but are soon fully awake when Ryder warns them of how severe the situation is. Once Ryder tells them of the situation with Santa, they are just as worried and horrified about what's happened to Santa, and Ryder makes it clear that he needs all the pups for helping save Santa and Christmas. The PAW Patrol deploys, and soon splits up: Ryder, Rocky, and Rubble find the remains of the sleigh, and set to work mending the broken runner, while Skye finds one of the lost bags of presents, which is soon retrieved by Marshall and Chase. Thought while Chase catches the presents with his net, Marshall is left to fall and land in the snow.

Soon, Skye, Marshall, Chase, and Zuma return with all the gifts, and while repairs on the sleigh continue, Skye, Marshall, and Zuma will take care of delivering the gifts to Adventure Bay's residents, while Chase sets about hunting down and rounding up the reindeer. He soon finds Prancer, and herds him back to the sleigh, then goes for the rest.

With the presents, Skye delivers to Katie and Cali at the Pet Parlor, Marshall does Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta at City Hall, and Zuma is interrupted delivering to Cap'n Turbot on Seal Island by Wally, who only wanted his Christmas present himself, which Zuma gladly delivers to him.

The sleigh is soon repaired, but when Ryder calls Santa, he's still looking for the Christmas star. Checking the radar, they find the star landed at Farmer Yumi's. When the PAW Patrol arrive, they find that the star landed on Bettina, causing her to fly like a reindeer. Luring her back to the ground with some hay, Rocky retrieves the star, and Ryder lets Santa know the mission is accomplished. Meanwhile, Chase is still having trouble rounding up the reindeer, but the aid of his megaphone finally gets them to cooperate.

Once back at the sleigh, Santa returns the star to its spot on the front of the sleigh, and the magic is restored. The pups soon climb aboard, and while amazed at being in Santa's sleigh, when they tell the reindeer ""Dash away all,"" the reindeer take the pups on a ride through the sky, before Santa whistles for the reindeer to return to Earth, as he needs to get a move on as he's behind schedule as it is. With a final cry of ""Merry Christmas, PAW Patrol! And thank you!"", Santa departs to resume his journey.

Back at the Lookout, Rubble is worried at how Santa has not left them any presents, but the other pups assure him that helping save Christmas for the whole world was the greatest Christmas ever, presents or no presents. Ryder soon reminds the pups they need to get to bed for Christmas morning, and the PAW Patrol retires to the Lookout for the night.

Christmas morning, the PAW Patrol awakens to find that Santa returned on his way home and left them presents under the tree for them as thanks for helping him out. The pups are excited to open their gifts, but Skye tells them that Ryder gets the first one, and they all agree. The gift Ryder gets from the pups is a large bone, and while he is grateful to the pups for the gift, he returns the generosity by letting the pups have the bone instead, ending the story as the pups and Ryder enjoy Christmas morning, and the knowledge of how they helped save Christmas for the entire world as well with helping out Santa Claus."

Some of the steps at City Hall are broken. Luckily, Rubble fixes the steps on the double. Mayor Goodway is so impressed with him, she asks Ryder how he found Rubble. Ryder said that Rubble was found in a tree. Mayor Goodway wants to know the story since she finds it strange to find a puppy in a tree.

As Ryder tells Mayor Goodway the story, a flashback story is shown on how the PAW Patrol met and rescued Rubble from a tree, and how he joined the PAW Patrol. The flashback starts with Marshall, Ryder, and Chase playing soccer in the yard until Marshall misses the ball and hits a very young Rubble, who is so amazed to see a ball that he plays with it, but the ball bounces into a tree. With great bravery, Rubble goes and gets the ball, but gets stuck in the tree and becomes very scared.

Marshall sees Rubble and calls for help. Ryder and Chase hear Marshall's howls and arrive quickly, Chase wearing his pup-pack and uniform. When Ryder is unable to reach Rubble due to the ledge being too narrow, Chase uses his net to help Rubble climb to safety. Rubble admits to not being scared, then is offered something to eat by Ryder. As the other pups watch Rubble eat, he reveals he's been on his own for a while. He apparently hasn't eaten very much since the PAW Patrol found him, as he scarfs down the food like crazy.

As Rubble talks to the other pups about his past, Ryder gets a call from Jake, who has been trapped in some snow boulders up on the mountain and needs help. Ryder calls the pups, and as they head to the elevator, Marshall explains about the PAW Patrol to Rubble, along with his own skills as the PAW Patrol's firefighting pup, before he and Rubble crash into the elevator. As the pups are suited up, Rubble is amazed by what he sees, and is even more amazed upon reaching the top and seeing the inside of the Lookout.

As Ryder chooses Skye and Chase to assist with helping Jake, and they deploy, Rubble slides down the slide behind the others, and lands in the back of Chase's police truck. It is not long before Chase notices his passenger, tells Ryder, and has Rubble buckle up.

When they reach the mountain, Skye provides over watch, while Chase and Ryder try to figure out how to get down to Jake. During as they plan, Rubble spots a snowboarder, and wants to do it himself. Finding a spare snowboard and helmet, he's soon heading down to help Jake, after Ryder is rappelled down by Chase and his winch. Skye spots Rubble and tells Ryder, and when Rubble arrives, it doesn't take him long to dig right through the snow and reach Jake. Ryder is worried when Rubble disappears and asks Jake. When Jake reveals Rubble inside with him, and Ryder finds where Rubble dug a way out, he's impressed. Once Jake is rescued, he wonders if Rubble is the newest member of the PAW Patrol. This gives Ryder an idea.

Back at the Lookout, Ryder reveals he's found a home for Rubble. The other pups are sorry to see him go, until Ryder reveals Rubble's new home is with the PAW Patrol, much to Rubble's and the other pups' joy.

A little while later, Rubble is sworn in as the PAW Patrol's new Construction Pup, given his pup-tag and construction hardhat, and rides the slide down into his brand new digger/pup house. As the rest of the PAW Patrol join him, Ryder says Rubble has some growing to do before he can reach the controls, but once he does, Rubble will be a valued teammate to the PAW Patrol.

With that, the flashback ends, and Ryder sums it up as since that day, Rubble has been a good pup ever since. Rubble corrects him saying he's a great pup, and the story ends with Mayor Goodway agreeing with Rubble as he gets another scratching from Ryder.

Pups Save a Walrus:

The story begins with the PAW Patrol helping clean up the beach following a storm that knocked over all the recycle bins. Mayor Goodway offers a bone to the pup who does the best with cleaning up the beach. All the while, the local crab is having its peace disturbed by how the trash it is using is being cleaned up. After preventing Marshall and Chase from cleaning up one pile of recyclables, and snapping at them as well, the crab departs.

Out in the bay, Cap'n Turbot is also cleaning up the litter that is floating in the bay, when Wally appears to offer his help. After giving Wally a clam as thanks, Turbot is okay with offering Wally more for doing some tricks. After Wally performs his patented Wally Spinner for another clam, he then takes a deep breath and goes underwater. Cap'n Turbot is impressed, but when Wally doesn't resurface after a minute or so, Cap'n Turbot becomes worried. When he looks underwater, Cap'n Turbot spots Wally trapped below by an old fishing net. Knowing that Wally won't be able to hold his breath for much longer before he is forced to exhale, and risk drowning, Cap'n Turbot decides to call the pups.

Ryder is busy with loading the full recycle bins into Rocky's truck, when he gets Cap'n Turbot's call for help. Seeing the concern on Cap'n Turbot's face for Wally's well-being, Ryder agrees to help, mounts his ATV, and summons the pups. Marshall ends up getting a megaphone from the lifeguard chair stuck on his head, leading to him crashing into the other pups upon reaching the elevator, but at least the crash gets the megaphone unstuck from Marshall's head.

Once the pups reach topside, Ryder gives them the heads-up on Wally, replaying Cap'n Turbot's advice on how walruses can hold their breath for a very long time, but not forever. Knowing that they have to help Wally before he runs out of oxygen, Ryder deploys Zuma to help him with checking on Wally, while Chase will go to the beach and standby with his winch in case they need to tow Wally to shore. With that, the PAW Patrol deploys, and while Chase arrives on the beach across from the Flounder, Ryder and Zuma meet up with Cap'n Turbot. Ryder gears up in his scuba gear, and together with Zuma, head down to check on Wally.

When they reach him, Wally is already on the verge of being forced to exhale. While Zuma offers his oxygen tank to give Wally fresh air, Ryder spots the net entangling Wally being wrapped around an old, rusty anchor. As Ryder removes the net from the anchor and heads back up to Wally and Zuma, he has to hesitate when the baby whale and a school of fish swim past, Wally signaling the baby whale so it can avoid everyone. When Ryder regroups with Zuma, he is now on the verge of having to exhale, but is able to still talk while Wally is using his breather. Once Ryder hooks a cable from Zuma's pup-pack to the net and signals Zuma, Zuma recalls his breather so he can get fresh air into his lungs, and together, Ryder and Zuma carry Wally back to the surface.

Back topside, Cap'n Turbot is worrying for Wally, but when Ryder and Zuma resurface with Wally safe, Cap'n Turbot is relieved, but with the net too tightly wrapped around Wally to loosen there, they need to get Wally to shore. Zuma heads over to tell Chase that they need his winch, and after Chase throws it out for Zuma to catch, Zuma brings it back to Ryder. Wally nearly goes under again when Ryder takes the winch from Zuma, but Ryder quickly dives to retrieve Wally, hook up the winch, and then signal Chase to bring Wally to shore.

Cap'n Turbot soon arrives on shore in his dinghy, and is happily reunited with Wally, now untangled from the net. He thanks the PAW Patrol for saving Wally's life, and Ryder, Zuma, and Chase head back to the beach to see how the other pups are doing. The other pups have finished the cleanup, with 16 recycle bins to show for their effort, but when Mayor Goodway offers the bone, Ryder mentions that the pups have all been great, so he and the Mayor work out a compromise: Marshall gets the bone, but when the other pups whimper, they get bone-shaped treats as the compromise.

The story ends with Wally, Cap'n Turbot, Ryder, Mayor Goodway, and the pups playing volleyball. When Turbot passes the ball to Wally, he spikes it away with his trusty Wally Spinner, earning a good laugh from everyone."

The story starts with Chase, Zuma, and Rocky enjoying some free time with Ryder at the pup park.

Meanwhile, at Farmer Yumi's, she and Mr. Porter are heading out to harvest some freshly grown carrots for Mr. Porter back at his restaurant. When they start picking them, Yumi discovers that a row of her carrots have mysteriously vanished. Moments later, another row starts to suffer the same fate as the carrots are pulled back underground. After struggling to pull one carrot back out, but partially eaten, Farmer Yumi and Mr. Porter find the source of the carrots' disappearance: Very hungry bunnies. Farmer Yumi calls Ryder to let him know of the problem, and he calls the pups to the Lookout. Marshall has his usual crash into the elevator after the dust from the feather duster he was using sends him recoiling, via a sneeze, backwards and getting his head stuck in a bucket. Luckily, after the crash, the bucket is on Marshall's backside, rather than his head, earning laughs from the rest of the pups.

Once there, Skye is smitten by how cute the bunnies look, but Ryder reminds her that they need to find a place where the bunnies won't bother the Adventure Bay residents, and the locals won't bother the bunnies. The Lookout is a no-go as if there are too many bunnies for Farmer Yumi's, there's too many for the Lookout. With that, Ryder has Chase and Rubble join him on the mission, and off they go. At Farmer Yumi's, she and Mr. Porter have managed to save the majority of the carrots before the bunnies could get to them, although Mr. Porter has a snack of one himself, much to Farmer Yumi's amusement and annoyance.

When they arrive, Rubble gets right to work carefully digging the dirt up from around the carrot patch to find the bunnies' tunnels. Chase does his best to catch the bunnies, but they prove to be able to outsmart him by making him dizzy. Knowing that they have to lure the bunnies in, Ryder calls the Lookout to have Rocky retrieve some old pet carriers, and Skye to bring them to Yumi's to use to help lure the bunnies in.

When Skye arrives, Ryder, Farmer Yumi, and Mr. Porter plant carrots as bait in the carriers, and Chase calls the bunnies over to enjoy the carrots. The plan works, and Skye is soon departing to take the bunnies to a meadow where they will be safe and happy. Unknown to any of them, several bunnies did not fall for the trick, and stow away in Mr. Porter's van with the carrots he is taking back to his restaurant. When Mr. Porter arrives back at his restaurant, he discovers the bunnies, and soon is in over his head trying to catch them.

Back at Farmer Yumi's, Ryder and the pups find one stray bunny scaring Bettina, then get the call from Mr. Porter asking for help with the ones that rode with him back to his restaurant. When the PAW Patrol arrive, the bunnies are too numerous for them to catch, until Ryder has Mr. Porter lure them in with his carrot cake. It works, Chase nets them all, and it is time to get the bunnies where they will not bother anyone again.

At the bunnies' new home, Skye sees them off, and with the bunnies now happy and safe, the PAW Patrol head home, save for Skye, who finds she has some unexpected company in her helicopter. One bunny is able to sneak aboard, and Skye takes her home to the Lookout.

Back home, Rocky is loving Farmer Yumi's carrots, when Skye arrives and asks Ryder is she can keep the bunny that came back with her in her helicopter. Ryder agrees, knowing they can handle one bunny, and then feeds Skye and the bunny a carrot for their flips. However, two more show up, and Ryder agrees to feed them as well. The story ends as everyone laughs at how it seems no matter what, those bunnies always seem to keep popping up in numbers, no matter what they do to reign them all in.

Pup-Tacular:

Marshall and Rubble are at Katie's Pet Parlor. Rubble is taking a bubble bath because Katie is entering him in the Pup-Tacular, a puppy show where best-styled pup wins a trophy and a bone, which is mostly why Rubble let Katie enter him.

Zuma and Skye run in and remind the two pups that they have to do their safety inspection on their vehicles with Ryder. This means that Rubble can't be entered in the Pup-Tacular. Instead, Zuma lets Katie enter him in the Pup-Tacular.

Meanwhile, Marshall and Rubble have started their safety inspections on their vehicles while Ryder checks his ATV. He then gets a call from Mayor Goodway. While she and Chickaletta were having a picnic on the beach, Chickaletta accidentally dropped her rubber ducky into the bay. When Mayor Goodway rowed out in a rowboat with her to get it back, she accidentally dropped the oars into the bay. Now the tide is pushing them out to sea. Ryder knows this is an emergency, as does Mayor Goodway, and lets her know the PAW Patrol are on their way.

Ryder summons the pups, and Zuma has to apologize to Katie for being unable to participate in the Pup-Tacular as well. Katie wonders about sticking to the ""Kitty-Tacular"" which isn't coming anytime soon. When the pups reach the Lookout, Marshall accidentally soaks Zuma who says that it's the second bath he had on the same day, leaving Skye to joke as she suddenly looks disgusted and sniffs the air, mentioning that someone smells like a wet dog. Zuma shakes himself off, the pups reach the tower, and Ryder relays their duties to them. Rocky quips about how the rescue sounds like a wet one, and reminds the others of his dislike of water, much to their annoyance.

Ryder sets out with Zuma and Skye, while back at the Lookout, Marshall and Rubble head back to finish inspecting their vehicles. Katie calls asking about Zuma, but when she learns of Zuma being called to duty, she then wonders if Chase or Rocky want to be in the Pup-Tacular. Rocky can't because of his aquaphobia, but Chase is more than willing to volunteer, convincing Rocky to come with him over to Katie's.

Out in the bay, Skye spots the boat, and while Ryder and Zuma head over, Skye looks for the rubber duck. In her excitement over being rescued, Mayor Goodway accidentally causes the rowboat to rock, and launch Chickaletta overboard. Mayor Goodway is terrified for her chicken, but Ryder spots her, and Zuma goes to save her, while Skye has located the rubber duck, and retrieves it and returns it to Chickaletta herself. Zuma's attempt to rescue Chickaletta with his buoy is unsuccessful as Chickaletta's feet are unable to grip the buoy, and she slips off and back into the water, upside-down. Ryder takes over the rescue and is more successful in saving Chickaletta. Mayor Goodway is grateful, but devastated it was her fault Chickaletta is soaking wet, and in her panic, demands Ryder call Chase to provide police escort back to City Hall to clean Chickaletta up.

At Katie's, Chase is nearly ready for the Pup-Tacular when Ryder calls for his help, leaving Katie crushed once more at not having an entry for the Pup-Tacular again. Seeing Katie upset, Rocky, despite his fear of water, offers to be the entry instead. Katie is overjoyed and hugs Rocky, leaving him looking pretty pleased at being hugged by her. Rocky however, still lets his aquaphobia get the better of him, but when Katie says he doesn't have to go through with getting cleaned up for the Pup-Tacular, Rocky conquers his fear of water, for Katie's sake.

While Skye overlooks as Chase leads Ryder and Mayor Goodway on his ATV back to City Hall, at Katie's, Rocky is brushed, groomed, given a faux-hawk haircut, and a pair of sunglasses to complete his makeover. Afterwards, Katie and Rocky catch the train and make it to the Pup-Tacular.

At the Lookout, Marshall and Rubble finish their safety checks and join Ryder, Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, and the other pups to watch the Pup-Tacular. They're just in time to catch the Best Styled Mixed Breed part of the competition, which Katie and Rocky win. Afterwards, Ryder congratulates the PAW Patrol on all their help to Mayor Goodway and Katie, and enjoys playing some frisbee and soccer with them. Rocky even ends the story giving the others a good laugh when he splashes into a mud puddle, saying he's Pup-Tacular, Rocky-style."

As the story begins, Ryder is fixing up his ATV, and when Rocky comes by, he asks if he can lend a hand. Ryder agrees, and Rocky offers his pup-pack's claw arm to help give Ryder the tools he needs.

Meanwhile, Cap'n Turbot is out whale-watching, when he hears a loud bang. He notices that an oil tanker has scraped up against the rocks near the shoreline, and the hull has ruptured, leaking oil into the bay. After confirming if the tanker's captain is alright, Cap'n Turbot calls Ryder and notifies him of the environmental emergency. Things only get worse when Cap'n Turbot spots the mother whale and her baby heading for the Flounder and the tanker. Although Turbot is able to warn the mother whale to the danger, the baby whale doesn't hear the warning, and ends up diving and re-surfacing in the middle of the spill. With now both the oil spill and the baby whale covered in oil, Cap'n Turbot needs the PAW Patrol's help more than before. Ryder responds that they're on their way, and summons the pups to the Lookout.

Marshall has his usual run-in on the way to the elevator, and crashes into Rubble, spilling their food he was carrying, which Marshall finds delicious and wonders if it comes with extra cheese. After Marshall snacks on a few more pieces, and slips on several more on the way into the elevator, the pups arrive in the tower and get their orders: While Ryder and Zuma will head out to assist Cap'n Turbot and the tanker's captain, Marshall will rendezvous on the beach with Katie and Cali to help clean the oil off the baby whale.

Once Marshall arrives to assist Katie, Ryder and Zuma meet up with Cap'n Turbot and the tanker's captain, who offers a boat bumper as a plug to the hole where the oil is leaking out. With the spill having been stopped from getting bigger, Ryder now tries to look for the baby whale. Cap'n Turbot offers a bucket of fish to lure the baby whale, and Zuma uses his buoy to carry the bucket over to where Marshall and Katie are. The baby whale takes the bait, and follows Zuma to the beach. She is a little unhappy at the oil on her, but a fish meal from Katie cheers her up, and the baby whale enjoys being cleaned up by Katie and Marshall.

Back at the spill, with Cap'n Turbot not having anything to clean up the spill, Ryder calls Rocky to collect as many towels as he can, as they can tie them together into a long boom that can be used to soak the oil up. Thanks to a little recycling, the makeshift towel boom is able to clean up the spill, and prevent any other marine life from being harmed. Meanwhile, Katie and Marshall finish cleaning up the baby whale, who is soon reunited with her mother.

As the sun sets on Adventure Bay, the tanker blows its horn in thanks as it departs for the nearest harbor or shipyard for repairs, and Cap'n Turbot thanks the PAW Patrol for their help. The mother whale and her baby also offer their thanks, and Skye has the honor of dumping the bucket of fish down so the mother whale and her baby can have dinner. With the whales fed, Ryder has the pups head back to the Lookout to eat as well, with him and Katie running after them as Cap'n Turbot waves after them, and one last song of thanks from the mother whale is head to end the story.

Pups Save a Goodway:

The story begins with the PAW Patrol assisting Mayor Goodway with preparing for Great-great-great-great-Grandpa Grover Day to honor the original mayor of Adventure Bay, Grover Goodway, Mayor Goodway's great-great-great-great-grandfather. While all the other decorations are done, the statue of Grover has yet to show up. Mayor Goodway entrusted Cap'n Turbot to take the statue to be polished, cleaned, and returned in time for the celebration. Worried, she contacts him on his ship, the Flounder.

Cap'n Turbot is on his way back right now, but the baby whale happens to appear, forcing him to avoid her. In the process, Cap'n Turbot's evasive steering causes the statue to lose balance, and before Cap'n Turbot can catch it, the statue falls overboard. Not wanting to worry Mayor Goodway, Cap'n Turbot keeps what happened to a minimum, and then calls Ryder to tell him the truth. When Mayor Goodway learns of this, she grabs the pup-pad from Ryder and pleads to Cap'n Turbot that they have to get Grandpa Grover back. Following Mayor Goodway having a moment of amnesia in thinking she was talking to Cap'n Turbot on her own cellphone and not the pup-pad, she hands it back to Ryder, who assures her that the PAW Patrol is on the job.

Ryder calls the pups back to the Lookout, and while Skye flies back, the other pups run, while Marshall takes his firetruck. Marshall has a little accident when he soaks Rubble unintentionally, much to Rubble's annoyance, but Rubble forgives Marshall when he then crashes into the elevator and into Rubble himself, much to the amusement of the others. Upon reaching the tower, the orders are clear: Zuma and Skye will assist in retrieving Grandpa Grover's statue from underwater, and carry it back to City Hall. With that, Ryder, Zuma, and Skye deploy, and head for where Cap'n Turbot stopped the Flounder when the statue fell overboard.

When they reach the Flounder, Ryder uses his pup-pad's sonar ability to locate the statue, now resting on a rock outcropping near an underwater canyon. Zuma jokes at how the fish are gathering around the statue, and while Skye gets her sky hook ready to haul the statue up, Ryder changes to his scuba gear to head underwater with Zuma.

While getting to the statue is no problem, before they can hook Skye's hook onto the statue, the baby whale appears again, and as it passes, it hits the statue, knocking it off the outcropping, and closer to the edge of the canyon. No harm done, Ryder soon learns that the added depth is too deep for Skye's hook to extend to, and now they have to find an alternate means to retrieve the statue. Cap'n Turbot begins to panic at failing Mayor Goodway, but Ryder realizes that they can attempt to lift the statue using a balloon and helium.

Back at City Hall, Mayor Goodway is still panicking. Contacting Rocky, Ryder asks him to bring the helium tank and a spare balloon to the dock for Zuma to pick up. Rocky complies, and upon returning to the Flounder, while Cap'n Turbot and Skye watch with worry, Ryder and Zuma dive down, tie the balloon around the statue's waist, then fill it with helium. The plan works as the balloon floats the statue to the surface, but it soon starts to go airborne instead. Luckily, Ryder has Skye catch the rope and carry the statue back to City Hall, while he and Zuma will be right behind her once Ryder changes back to his regular clothes.

At City Hall, Mayor Goodway is still paranoid with fear, when Gustavo, Julius, and Julia arrive. She tries to figure out how to explain the absence of Grandpa Grover's statue, but as Gustavo snaps at her about Grandpa's whereabouts, Julius and Julia spot Skye bringing the statue home. When Ryder and Zuma arrive soon after, Mayor Goodway and Gustavo are proud of them from bringing Grandpa Grover back safely and with how shiny the statue looks. Following a squid that had been on the statue since it had been underwater jumping off on Mayor Goodway's head, and Ryder collecting in a pail, the Goodways, Ryder, Zuma, and Skye, get together for a group photo with the statue.

Afterwards, after showing the photo to the other pups, Ryder lets them go have some fun since they earned it. The PAW Patrol run off, barking happily, while Ryder has a final laugh to himself, before the story ends."

The story begins at the start of a hoedown in Adventure Bay. Ryder and the rest of the PAW Patrol are excited that Mayor Goodway and the rest of the citizens have put on a hoedown; Marshall is so excited that he does a tail spin, the result being Skye and Chickaletta taking shelter in a barrel of corn. Marshall bumps into the barrels and spins them around, until Skye and Chickaletta eventually knock into each other.

Meanwhile, at the train station, Farmer Al arrives with his five cows for a pit-stop. However, when Mr. Hudson blows the train whistle, it spooks all the cows out of their stall in the boxcar, and they run away in different directions. Farmer Al calls Ryder for help. With the hoedown interrupted, Ryder musters the PAW Patrol and deploys Chase to herd the cows and Skye as the eyes in the sky, while the rest return to the hoedown on stand-by.

Ryder and Chase arrive at the train station to see one cow running around, and Chase manages to herd it back into the train car.

Skye has spotted two cows down Hill Street causing traffic problems, and stampeding to Farmer Yumi's farm. As soon as Chase and Ryder arrive at the farm, the two cows split up. Chase goes after one while Ryder gets the other. As soon as they capture the cows, they report it to Farmer Al.

Skye, flying over the beach, has spotted a cow heading to a row boat. The cow boards the boat and drifts out to sea. Skye reports this and Ryder calls Zuma.

At the hoedown, while Zuma and Rubble are playing horseshoes, Zuma gets the call to go to the bay. Zuma, in his hovercraft, manages to grab the boat with his buoy and herd it to the train station.

While Chase takes his cows to the train station, Skye spots the last one at Mr. Porter's grocery. Ryder herds the last cow out, all the while they take a detour, parading through the hoedown, and into the train station just in time for Farmer Al and the train to leave. The story end with Ryder and the pups enjoying the rest of the hoedown.

Pups Save Alex:

The story starts with Rocky and Marshall busy trying to clean up Marshall's pup house, but they can't get much done with a rag. As if to answer their calls for help, Alex arrives on his super-trike with a bucket and sponge, but spins out on the puddle of water from Marshall's water cannons, causing the bucket to land on Marshall's head, and Rocky catching the sponge in his face. Alex apologizes, and the pups return to work with Alex helping them.

At Farmer Yumi's, Cali is playing with her toy mouse, when Chickaletta chooses to take it, and refuses to give it back. Cali pursues her to the roof of the barn, where Chickaletta trips on a gap between the roof shingles and drops the toy. Before Chickaletta can try and recover it, Cali takes it back and jumps to the roof of the silo, only to find her grip slipping as her claws tear roofing tiles off the silo and can't find a good anchoring point. Chickaletta doesn't pursue, instead, realizing it's her fault that Cali is now trapped and in trouble, she goes to tell Farmer Yumi. Once Yumi sees Cali in trouble, she tells her to hang on while she calls the PAW Patrol.

At the Lookout, Ryder is playing video-games on the pup-pad again, when he gets Yumi's call. At first, he thinks it is Bettina who is calling for help, but Yumi clears up the misunderstanding, and shows Ryder the real problem: Cali in trouble, and losing her grip. Ryder tells Yumi and Bettina not to worry, and after Bettina leaves a saliva mark on Yumi's cellphone, Ryder hangs up and calls the pups. Outside, Alex is still helping Marshall and Rocky when Ryder summons the pups, and wonders if he can join them. Marshall seems OK with it, and then heads for the elevator. This time, he tells Rocky he is going to make extra certain not to crash into any pups in the elevator. To do so, Marshall waits as the other pups enter the Lookout first, and he calls them by name, them barking in reply, except Zuma, who is upset over being woken up from a nap. Once he's certain it's clear, Marshall follows after the others, only for Alex, in his excitement, to crash into Marshall instead, and lead to both of them crashing into the other pups in the elevator. This time, it's Alex who apologizes for the accident, and the pups share a laugh before the elevator heads up. Zuma has fallen asleep again, but a nudge from Rocky quickly snaps him fully awake since he knows there is no sleeping on the job if Ryder needs him for trouble.

Once the elevator reaches the top, Alex is amazed to be in the Lookout itself, but does his best to stand at attention with the pups as Ryder briefs them on their latest emergency: Skye will attempt to try and get Cali into a pet carrier with her helicopter, while Marshall will attempt a rescue with his firetruck's ladder. Alex asks if he can help at all, but Ryder assures him that the pups have things well under control, much to Alex's disappointment. While Ryder heads down the fire pole to his ATV, and Alex looks down after him in amazement, Skye heads down the slide. When Alex goes to look at that as well, Marshall crashes into him, sending both down to Marshall's firetruck. Skye and Ryder have already deployed, so when Marshall's truck finishes transforming from his pup house, he checks to make sure Alex is okay. As Alex puts on his helmet and says he is ready to go, Marshall contacts Ryder to let him know of the situation. Ryder can only shake his head and laugh, but agrees that Alex can come along as long as he behaves himself. Alex promises, and Marshall heads out to join Skye and Ryder, with Alex along for the ride, even agreeing to let Alex turn on the siren as they head for Farmer Yumi's.

When the PAW Patrol arrive, Skye attempts to get Cali into the carrier, but Cali swats it away with an angry hiss, then scampers onto the center of the silo roof itself. Realizing the carrier won't work since Cali is too frightened, Ryder has Skye return to the Lookout with the carrier, then return for Plan B: Marshall and his firetruck. Marshall's first attempt fails when Cali drops her toy, then jumps on Marshall's head, blinding him with his own helmet, forcing her to retreat to the silo roof while Marshall bounces down his ladder and out onto the ground. As everyone wonders how they can lure Cali into coming down with Marshall, Alex, who had picked up Cali's dropped toy mouse, and notices Cali reach out for it, gets an idea. Only after Ryder draws blanks on ideas from Farmer Yumi, Bettina, and Chickaletta, does he then listen to Alex, who suggests that they use Cali's toy to lure her into coming down. Ryder agrees, and gives the toy to Marshall, who groans at the taste of cat breath in his mouth, but goes ahead with the plan.

The plan works perfectly, as Cali is attracted to her toy, leaps onto Marshall's helmet again, but this time, both her and Marshall bounce down the ladder to both the ground and safety. As Ryder, Skye, and Farmer Yumi run over to Marshall, Skye is amazed that Marshall saved Cali, who picks up her toy and walks away, giggling. Ryder however, points out Alex is the person who saved Cali. Alex says the PAW Patrol did most of the work, he just helped, but it seems Cali is very grateful for Alex's help, rubbing against his leg and purring happily.

As Ryder suggests that whenever you are in trouble, just yelp for help, or Alex, leaving everyone laughing and even Marshall joking on calling Alex the ""Alex Patrol"", later, back at the Lookout, Ryder congratulates the pups on another job well done. He also congratulates Alex for his assistance in Cali's rescue, and officially makes him an Honorary Member of the PAW Patrol, complete with his own PAW Patrol badge. Alex is amazed, and thanks Ryder and the pups for everything, declaring this to be the best day ever! The pups think so as well, as Skye tackles him to the floor. After Alex scratches Chase and Marshall, telling the pups that they are all good pups, the story ends with the pups all licking Alex as he laughs happily over the great day he just had with the PAW Patrol."

The story starts with the PAW Patrol waking and enjoying some yoga before breakfast. Chase is leading the session, but Marshall is still tired, and yawns his way through before finally going back to sleep, earning a laugh from the other pups as Rocky announces that Marshall is doing the ""snoring dog"".

Meanwhile, at Mr. Porter's restaurant, Alex is getting ready for his first day of school, but there's a problem: His brand-new red backpack is missing. Fearing he is now unable to go aboard the school bus when it arrives, Alex calls Ryder for help, just as Ryder is about to give the pups breakfast. Once Alex asks the PAW Patrol to help him find his backpack, Ryder agrees and calls the pups.

Once topside, the pups feel sorry for Alex when they learn of his plight. Ryder decides to have Chase accompany him to interview Alex on his backpack's last known whereabouts, while Skye will trail the school bus and relay its location back to Ryder. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy, and Skye soon has the school bus in her sights, busy picking up kids in the residential area on Hill Street.

At Mr. Porter's, Alex does his best to retrace his steps on where he had his backpack last, but due to how he had it in numerous places around Adventure Bay, Ryder and Chase remain at the restaurant to continue getting details, while Ryder dispatches the other pups to check the locations Alex mentioned.

First off, Marshall heads to the park to look there, but only finds a red balloon stuck in a tree with the aid of his gosling friend Fuzzy.

At the beach, Zuma only finds an old, red life jacket that he takes from Wally the Walrus to help clean up the bay, thanking Wally for his help.

Rubble tries Farmer Yumi's, but only finds one of her red bandannas under some hay bales.

Rocky's attempt at City Hall only results in him accidentally taking Mayor Goodway's red purse off her shoulder, causing her to fall over, and Rocky to apologize to Mayor Goodway, and Chickaletta when she springs up out of the purse.

With the school bus now heading down Main Street towards Mr. Porter's, Alex's latest memory recall mentions that he had his backpack at the train station. Ryder and Chase hurry over, and spot the backpack hanging from the railing on the caboose of the train. As they approach, the backpack starts to move about, and a familiar gray tail pokes out of the top of the backpack with a curious, muffled meow. Thanks to his allergies, it doesn't take Chase long to figure out that it's Cali, attracted to the tuna fish sandwich Alex was going to have for lunch at school.

However, the train starts to depart, and with Cali now trapped in the backpack, getting a free ride down the rails, Ryder calls Skye to airlift him after the train to get Cali and the backpack back. While Ryder goes after Cali and Alex's backpack, back at Mr. Porter's, with the school bus now about to arrive to pick Alex up, Alex is disheartened by being unable to take his backpack to school, and apologizes to his grandfather for losing it. Back at the train, Ryder is soon swung close enough to retrieve the backpack, and while Cali scurries onto Ryder's back for safety, Skye carries them both back to Mr. Porter's.

Alex is just about to board the school bus when Ryder returns and drops him his backpack. Alex is so happy that he has his backpack for school again, and thanks Ryder for his help. Ryder never even gets a chance to finish saying the PAW Patrol motto before Skye airlifts him to head back to the Lookout. Alex soon notices that someone ate his tuna fish sandwich, and while Cali lets off a giggle as being the culprit, Alex waves goodbye to his grandfather as the school bus departs, and Mr. Porter wishes his grandson a great first day of school.

Back at the Lookout, the pups are ready to eat their breakfast, and Ryder is quick to feed all of them. Once the pups are digging in to their food, Ryder hears a meow, and turns to find Cali having joined the pups, wanting some breakfast as well. Ryder doesn't forget her, and gives her a tuna fish sandwich. As Cali joins the PAW Patrol in digging into their breakfast, the story ends with Ryder laughing as the pups and Cali enjoys their food.

Pups Turn on the Lights:

The story begins with Skye and Rubble sneaking to Katie's Pet Parlor in the evening, as that is the location for where they are holding a surprise birthday party for Chase. Rocky decorates the clinic with streamers, accidentally spreading one over Cali. Katie preps for doing the cake, and all the pups are helping out to make it perfect. Meanwhile, Marshall keeps Chase busy so the others can finish the preparations.

However, the weather is pretty windy, and at the wind turbine farm providing power to Adventure Bay, the wind gets so strong that one of the blades on one of the turbines can't take the stress and snaps off, disabling the turbine, and reducing the power output. The effects are immediate: The lights at the clinic go out, and Katie's mixer dies while she is still mixing the cake batter for Chase's birthday cake.

The pups are worried as the rest of the street is dark as well. As Ryder guesses the turbine is broken, the pups fear that Chase's party is ruined, Skye even howling in sadness. But, Ryder refuses to let Chase's party be ruined by a simple power blackout, and calls the pups to the Lookout to investigate.

Marshall and Chase get there first, but due to the Lookout also being hooked up to the power grid, the electronic doors are disabled, and Marshall crashes into them. Before they can warn the other pups, Skye, Zuma, and Rubble suffer the same fate as they bump into the doors, and Marshall and Chase, causing a pile-up. Ryder and Rocky arrive, with Rocky lending the screwdriver from his pup-pack's tools to help Ryder pry the doors open so the pups can suit up and grab their pup-packs. While the pups grab their gear, Ryder has Marshall lend his firetruck's ladder to him so he can climb up to the Lookout's upper level, pry the door up there open, and check the periscope to see what happened to the turbines. Once Ryder sees the reason is a broken blade, he heads down the fire pole as always, only now darkened due to the blackout, and meets up with the pups outside.

With the power out, Ryder uses his pup-pad to give the pups their briefing and orders: Rocky and Marshall will assist Ryder with repairing the turbine, while Chase does his duties as police pup to control traffic with the traffic lights disabled due to the blackout. As for Skye, Zuma, and Rubble, they will help Katie with finishing Chase's birthday party, even if it is in the dark. Ryder makes sure Chase is out of earshot to hear about his birthday surprise. As the pups deploy, Ryder has another problem with the blackout: He has to struggle to manually open the garage door for his ATV before he can deploy as well. Once he gets it open, the PAW Patrol head out, while Skye, Zuma, and Rubble decide to hold Chase's party in the dark if the power is not restored in time.

In town, the blackout is already causing trouble: traffic jams up and down Main Street, and the gridlock is preventing Mayor Goodway and the citizens from using the crosswalk. Worse, it is getting dark out as the sun sets. Chase arrives just in time, and is able to clear the gridlock and allow Mayor Goodway and the citizens to cross safely.

Meanwhile, Ryder, Rocky, and Marshall arrive at the wind farm, and set about with the repairs to the damaged turbine. While Ryder climbs up and removes the broken blade, Rocky finds their spare blade in the form of Zuma's old surfboard. Once Rocky attaches the surfboard into the slot where the broken blade was and comes down, a fresh gust of wind comes in, and the surfboard is able to catch it, allowing the turbine to resume turning again, restoring the power to Adventure Bay.

Back at Katie's, while the power is still out, the pups and Katie find other means for enjoyment at the party, like shadow puppets and flashlight tag. They are barely enjoying the flashlight tag before the power is restored. The pups and Katie are happy, but Skye is disappointed at how there is no time to finish Chase's birthday cake. Luckily, Katie is able to find a solution to the cake problem.

Back at Main Street, the restored power allows the traffic lights to come back online, much to Chase's happiness, and as the last of the citizens he helped cross the street thank Chase for all his help, Chase packs up his megaphone and returns to his truck.

Ryder soon calls, telling Chase to rendezvous with them at Katie's as soon as possible, and Chase heads out with his siren blaring. When Chase reaches the Pet Parlor and heads inside, it is dark, until the others turn on the lights and wish Chase a happy birthday. Chase is amazed, and loves his dog cookie cake that Katie made to make up for being unable to finish a regular cake. Ryder then adds on that while it may be Chase's party, all the pups did good, and are allowed to dig into Chase's cake with him. Skye then turns off the lights so they can play some more flashlight tag and do more shadow puppets, and the story ends as Katie tells Chase he's it now, and Chase replies with his catchphrase, ""Chase is on the case!"", leading to a round of laughter from inside the parlor."

Realizing the pool is opening up today, they head over to the pool but discover that the pool is empty. Deciding this is a job for the PAW Patrol, Rocky and Rubble run off to find Ryder.

At the Lookout, Skye is getting ready herself, and calls to Marshall to hurry up. Marshall goes a little overboard with everything he needs, but he is ready to get good and wet.

As a couple of the citizens cheer Rubble and Rocky as they run past, the duo soon bump into Ryder outside Mr. Porter's restaurant. Alex joins them just in time to hear the pups mention the pool being empty. As Alex worries about the empty pool, Ryder assures him everything will be fine, and calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout.

When the pups arrive, Marshall ends up bouncing into the elevator due to his floaty, and asks how he did. The other pups offer their scores, leaving them all to share a good laugh when Marshall sees the variety in the indecision of his judges. Once at the top, Ryder gives them their orders: Marshall and Rubble will go with Ryder to the town's water tower to investigate what is causing the water to be unable to get to the pool. Zuma and Skye can go to the pool and try to keep the spirits of Alex and the other kids up. With that, the pups deploy and head out.

When Ryder, Marshall, and Rubble arrive at the water tower, they discover one of the concrete support pads has slipped free of its spot, causing the water tower to lean over and cause the section of pipe above the valve to buckle and collapse inward from the stress. Seeing that they need further assistance, Ryder calls Chase and Rocky to lend a paw with their winch and forklift respectively. Chase and Rocky are ready to go - that is, they will be, once Chase takes off Skye's swimming cap.

Meanwhile, at the pool, the kids sigh over the lack of water, and Skye and Zuma feel sorry for them. Zuma gets an idea and goes to Mr. Porter's to get some ice cream bars and popsicles for the kids. When he gets back though, the heat has reduced all of them into melted goo.

Back at the water tower, Chase and Rocky arrive, and Ryder relays orders to them: Chase will equip his winch, Marshall will use his ladder to anchor it onto the water tower so Chase can lift it up, Rubble will lay down fresh dirt and gravel to help keep the concrete pad from slipping again, and Rocky will use his forklift to raise the heavy concrete slab and move it clear until the dirt and fresh gravel are in place.

Back at the pool, as Alex again laments over no water yet, Skye gets an idea and flies to Jake's Mountain to retrieve some snow for the kids to play with until the pool fills up. The kids are grateful, but Zuma soon finds himself buried in snow, joking at how first he was a hot dog, now he's a pup-sicle, and then shivering from how cold the snow is.

Meanwhile, back at the water tower, with Ryder supervising the effort, the water tower's concrete slab is soon put back in place, and the water tower is lowered back onto it, this time, the slab stays in place, and the tower is balanced and level. All that is left to do is replace the bent pipe and the PAW Patrol can send the water through to the pool. Rocky has a spare piece in his truck, and once Ryder closes the valve, Rocky uses his wrench to remove the dented piece, and place the new, reinforced piece into the spot. Once it's secured, Ryder prepares to turn the water back on.

Back at the pool, Alex is enjoying being rocked back and forth on an inflatable raft by Katie and Zuma, when the inflatable springs a leak and deflates, Zuma apparently puncturing it with his teeth by accident. As Skye laughs, Ryder contacts her to let her know that the repairs are done and he is about to turn the water back on, so let everyone know. Skye does just that, and everyone gathers to watch the pool fill up. At first, all that happens is some gurgling and the water only filling the drain, much to everyone's disappointment, but then, the water shoots out like a geyser, much to everyone's happiness. Alex is ready to get wet, but Zuma, being the water safety pup, tells them to wait until the pool fills up completely. Once it does, Zuma gives the OK for Alex, Julius, Julia, and Precious' owner, to enjoy themselves, while Katie relaxes poolside. Ryder and the other pups arrive, and Alex thanks them for everything they have done.

A little while later, Chase and Rocky are set up to judge the cannonball contest with Rocky hoping he is safe in the lifeguard's seat. As Chase gives the command, Skye, Rubble, Zuma, and Marshall jump into the pool, but the resulting splash still soaks Rocky, and he gives them a ""0"" for splashing the judge, much to Katie and Ryder's amusement to end the story.

Circus Pup-Formers:

The story begins with Chase introducing the pups as they perform their circus acts, ending with Marshall ending up getting three buckets stuck on his head, much to his unhappiness since it was due to his clumsiness. Up on the Lookout, Ryder is enjoying his cereal when he receives a call from Ringmaster Raimundo. Unfortunately, the trains carrying the circus have become separated. The train carrying the equipment and Eunice and Ellie made it safely, but the second one carrying all the other animals and performers is disabled and might not make it in time due to the repair work being done to fix it. Raimundo needs help, and Ryder agrees to bring the PAW Patrol to assist with setting up the big top.

Ryder calls the pups, and after Marshall crashes into the elevator, losing two of the buckets on his head in the process, the team arrive in the tower and learn of Raimundo's need of assistance. The pups are all needed this time, and the whole PAW Patrol head out to the running track where Raimundo is waiting with the equipment and the circus elephants. With the pups' help, the big top is soon up, but there is still no sign of the second train. Raimundo gets a call from his circus lion Leo, who is upset over the repair delays, and tries to calm him down while Ryder worries as well. The repairs of the second train is taking longer than they expected. Mayor Goodway, Jake, Katie, Cali, and several other citizens are already lined up to see the show.

Soon, Ryder and the pups take their seats in the audience, but Raimundo takes center ring with really bad news: The second train is still delayed, so the circus will have to be canceled. Refusing to let everyone be disappointed, Ryder offers the PAW Patrol to perform in the place of Raimundo's missing cast. Once Marshall shows off more of his clown clumsiness in a demonstration, Raimundo hands the reigns of the show over to Ryder.

Skye attempts to do the tightrope, but when she falls, she uses her pup-pack to fly to safety. Marshall joins in performing a clown routine with his water cannons, and the pups have a little fun with Ryder as he juggles pup treats. Soon, the grand finale takes place, and the pups spring off a springboard to form a pyramid on top of Eunice while Ellie poses alongside her mom.

As everyone cheers for Eunice, Ellie, Ryder, and the PAW Patrol, Raimundo has good news: The second train's repairs are finally done, and the rest of the circus crew are on their way. Raimundo thanks the PAW Patrol for all their help and, in a circus-related twist ending, Ryder takes the pups home in a clown car, as Raimundo, the circus elephants, and the audience thank them as they depart."

The hunt for a very special egg leads Ryder and the PAW Patrol on an exciting adventure.,[],TV-Y,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"It's Easter time in Adventure Bay, and the pups are busy practicing and training for the upcoming Easter Egg Hunt at City Hall, including Skye locating eggs with her goggles. They even mistake a bunny's tail for an egg and have a good laugh about it. Marshall brings buckets full of eggs, but they fall out and crack, leaving raw whites and yolks, because he hadn't known they needed to be hard-boiled first, making the shells more durable.

At City Hall, Mayor Goodway, dressed in a pink-striped outfit from her usual attire with a pair of bunny ears on her head, is busy painting eggs for the egg hunt with Alex while Chickaletta is busy pecking away at a jellybean. However, with just her and Alex doing it, Mayor Goodway is getting a little exhausted from all the work. Unfortunately, Chickaletta knocks her jellybean off the table, and in her pursuit of it, accidentally causes Mayor Goodway to trip over her and sprain her arm.

At the Lookout, Ryder soon gets a call from Mayor Goodway and Alex asking for help since with Mayor Goodway injured, they can't finish painting the eggs in time for the Egg Hunt. Ryder agrees and calls the PAW Patrol to hand out their orders. All the pups are needed for this assignment, especially to decorate the eggs, and they soon deploy to lend a hand. With the pups' help (during which they sing a short song about Easter), the eggs are done in time, and Alex even adds a larger egg he found and painted himself to be used in the hunt.

However, the mother eagle soon appears overhead and, without warning, snatches the entire basket full of eggs and candy, and flies back to her nest, taking Rocky and Chickaletta with her as they were in the basket at the time.

Ryder soon realizes that the large egg Alex found must be the Mother Eagle's egg, and she was only taking back what was stolen from her. Alex is upset over having goofed up like he did, but Ryder assures him that when you find an egg in the wild, it is best to leave it alone. With the basket, Rocky, and Chickaletta in need of rescuing, the PAW Patrol deploy to go help. Skye tries to pursue the Mother Eagle and take the basket back, but the Mother Eagle forces her to retreat without it. Skye and Zuma stay behind with Mayor Goodway and Alex when Rubble returns from Farmer Yumi's with several bunnies to celebrate Easter with, while Ryder, Chase, Marshall, and Rubble go to help Rocky and Chickaletta. Following Alex's info on where he found the Mother Eagle's egg, up along the old fire road, Ryder heads out to save Rocky, Chickaletta, and the Easter basket.

After dropping the basket off at her nest, the Mother Eagle departs to find food. Rocky, upon seeing that they are trapped for the time being, watches as Chickaletta acts on her instincts, and egg-sits for the Mother Eagle, causing the egg to partially hatch so the baby eagle's legs and feet stick out of the bottom of the egg. Nicknaming the baby eagle ""Little Eggle,"" Rocky is about to move it from the basket back to the nest, but is interrupted by the Mother Eagle's return, and fears she is angry upon seeing him with her young-ling.

On the old fire road below, Ryder and the pups' path to the nest is blocked by rocks, but Rubble moves them aside easily with his rig. When they arrive at the nest, Rocky tries to apologize to the Mother Eagle, but she offers him a worm to eat. While Rocky doesn't want it, Chickaletta accepts it as thanks from the Mother Eagle for her egg-sitting. When they hear Ryder below, Ryder sees that they will have to distract the Mother Eagle in order to get Rocky and Chickaletta down and retrieve the basket. Knowing an eagle's love of fish as one of its favorite foods, Ryder has Zuma go see Cap'n Turbot for a bucket of fish, while Skye carries the bucket up to the nest. Marshall is a little unnerved by the Mother Eagle staring down at them vigilantly, without even blinking, but soon is relieved when Skye returns. Skye is able to lure the Mother Eagle away with the fish, and upon dropping the bucket off on open ground, the Mother Eagle happily digs into the fresh seafood.

With the Mother Eagle distracted, Rocky is able to return Little Eggle to the nest, but in his attempts to climb out of the basket, he loses his balance and falls out. Thanks to Chase's quick reaction with using his net, Rocky avoids being seriously hurt, and Skye takes care of recovering the basket while Chickaletta hops out when Marshall comes to rescue her and Rocky, coming down with Marshall before he was ready. Now that the baby eagle is back in the nest, and the mother will not come looking around Adventure Bay for it again, the team heads back to City Hall.

Once the PAW Patrol return to City Hall with the basket and the goodies inside safe, along with Rocky and Chickaletta, it is not long before the pups and the kids are able to enjoy the Easter Egg Hunt. Alex is at first upset over the loss of his egg, but Ryder assures him that Little Eggle is back with his mom, where it belongs. The kids and pups are soon enjoying the egg hunt and other activities, such as Chase cheering up Julius by bringing an egg to him, and Marshall winning the race with balancing an egg on a spoon in his mouth.

Later that day, the pups and Ryder are in the Lookout, relaxing after having such a fun and exciting Easter celebration. Rubble wonders about how Little Eggle is doing, and Ryder offers the pups a chance to see on the view screen after he checks the periscope. The pups watch as Little Eggle fully hatches, and even sprouts three multicolored feathers on its head. The pups can only go ""Aw!"" as they watch Little Eggle and his mom nuzzle lovingly, as the story ends."

As the story begins, Chase, Marshall, and Rocky are watching their favorite show, Apollo the Super-Pup. Below, Rubble is woken from his sleep by Apollo's theme song, causing him to retreat into his pup house and re-emerge decked out in his vest, and a mask and cape just like Apollo's. Joining the other pups, Rubble enjoys watching Apollo, quite over-enthusiastically, then decides to be just like him by trying to help out the citizens of Adventure Bay as a Super Pup himself.

What follows is a collection of Rubble's heroics in trying to be like Apollo, saying he can do it on his own and does not need any help, including trying to help out Farmer Yumi with finding something she dropped. Reality sets in for Rubble when he attempts to help Engineer Ed with clearing a small rock-slide at the end of the train tunnel. Rubble believes he can do it himself, but when a second, heavier rock-slide occurs after Rubble's attempts to clear the first one fail, blocking both tunnel entrances completely, Rubble collapses in defeat and guilt over having let his ego get the better of him. Engineer Ed manages to cheer him up and remind him of the power of teamwork, and Rubble contacts Ryder to let him know that both he and Engineer Ed are trapped in the tunnel and need help getting out. Ryder assures Rubble that the other pups are on their way, and summons the rest of them to the Lookout.

When they arrive, they notice that Rubble is missing. Ryder reveals the situation regarding Rubble and the rock-slide, and selects Chase and Zuma to help with the rescue. Since they need Rubble's rig to clear the rocks, Zuma is temporarily assigned the role of driving Rubble's rig until they can get Rubble out and he can take over. Right as the team deploys, it's clear Zuma has little experience with driving another pup's vehicle besides his hovercraft, as he almost ends up driving Rubble's rig backward down the driveway before turning it around and getting the hang of it.

When the PAW Patrol reach the tunnel, Zuma gets Rubble's attention when he bumps into the rock-slide by accident since he could not find the brake in time. Chase attaches his winch to one of the smaller rocks to pull it away and create a gap for Rubble to squeeze through. Once Rubble's out, he asks about his rig, only for him and Chase to wince and cover their eyes as Zuma struggles with all the controls for driving the rig, using the bulldozer, and working the drill. Once Zuma is finally able to stop, he is more than happy to hand controls back to Rubble with a sheepish laugh. Back in control of his rig, Rubble gets right to work, and the tunnel is soon cleared, allowing Engineer Ed to drive the train out.

Before heading off, Engineer Ed thanks the team, and especially Rubble, for all their help, and Rubble learns a valuable lesson about how one can save the day in their own special way instead of trying to do it like their hero. The story ends as Rubble is more than happy to join the rest of the pups in some playtime now that he knows that teamwork is always better than trying to do it on one's own.

Pups Save Ryder's Robot:

The story opens from the perspective of the newly-built Robo-Dog, having just been activated as Ryder finishes making the last of his modifications in building it. Rocky questions if the robot is working and Ryder responds with uncertainty, deciding to test the robot by using its complementary remote control. Ryder instructs Robo-Dog to walk, which Robo-Dog does accordingly while barking. Ryder is excited with the success and tests Robo-Dog further by getting it to sit (which Robo-Dog accomplishes without error). Skye and Rubble walk over and compliment Ryder's robot, before Ryder commands it to dig. Robo-Dog digs with ease, to Rubble's shock. When it doesn't come back to the surface, Skye, Rubble, and Ryder wonder where Robo-Dog went.

A short distance away, Robo-Dog emerges from the ground directly into Zuma's pup-house, knocking Zuma both awake and into the open. Zuma is surprised with Robo-Dog's sudden appearance and Ryder comes over to apologize for the disturbance. Ryder then tries Robo-Dog's flight mechanism, which works perfectly. After it lands, Marshall comes by and questions what else the robot can do. Ryder responds by saying Robo-Dog should be super fast, to which Marshall confidently states that he is faster. Marshall decides to race Robo-Dog, and Chase brings out his megaphone to start the race.

During the race, Marshall repeatedly trips, but otherwise keeps pace with Robo-Dog while getting supportive cheers from the sidelines by the other pups. Midway through, Ryder activates turbo-mode and Robo-Dog zooms well ahead of Marshall. Determined to keep up, Marshall runs his fastest but stumbles on a hedge. Robo-Dog wins the race while speeding past Ryder and stopping, while Marshall ends up knocking Ryder off-balance; ultimately falling onto Robo-Dog.

Rocky rushes over and worries about Robo-Dog, while Marshall points out its mangled antenna. Robo-Dog begins to go haywire, digging many holes before eventually failing to come back up. Ryder states that he cannot control the robot with the remote (due to the malfunctioning antenna), and everyone worries about where Robo-Dog went and what it might do.

Meanwhile at Mr. Porter's cafe, Mr. Porter is serving an outdoor customer a Porter Burger. Just as the customer is about to take a bite, Robo-Dog flies by and steals it from his grasp. It then crashes through the fruit stand and causes many pieces of fruit to land on both Mr. Porter's and the customer's heads in the style of fruit hats.

In the air, Robo-Dog discards the burger onto a car's windshield and flies around City Hall, terrifying residents including Mayor Goodway, who launches herself into a flower bush. She then immediately contacts Ryder about the situation and Ryder admits that it was his own Robo-Dog. The mayor instructs him to stop it, to which Ryder responds by summoning the PAW Patrol. As the pups head to the Lookout, Marshall warns Rocky of the holes in the ground before falling in one himself. The other pups all run up together, tripping over Marshall's head, into Rocky, and into the elevator as a dog-pile.

In the observatory, Ryder mentions the pups' knowledge on the malfunctioning Robo-Dog, and explains to them the messes it has already made around Adventure Bay. Ryder's solution is to capture it and use a power switch on the attached pup tag to shut Robo-Dog down, and later fix it. In order to do this, he calls on Skye to locate Robo-Dog as quickly as possible, and Rocky to come up with and build something to catch it. Ryder asks all the other pups to help clean up the mess Robo-Dog has left around town before deploying.

Skye flies to City Hall and spots Chickaletta and Mayor Goodway, who points her in the direction Robo-Dog had headed. Not seeing Robo-Dog at City Hall, Skye informs Ryder and continues searching. Ryder then spots Robo-Dog himself, and notices it flying toward the water tower. Moments later, Robo-Dog crashes unhindered through the water tower; punching two holes in it as it spills its contents.

Katie is later shown trying to get Cali to take a bath, unsuccessfully. While struggling to get Cali into the tub, Robo-Dog bursts through the wall; causing Katie to jump into the filled bathtub in shock. Robo-Dog later exits via the ceiling. Skye spots Robo-Dog soon after as it flies frantically through the air, and gives chase.

At Mr. Porter's restaurant, Zuma and Rubble help collect all of the fruit spilled by Robo-Dog and return it to the fruit stand. Just as they finish, Robo-Dog flies through it, scattering food everywhere and knocking over Mr. Porter in the process. Rocky and Ryder soon visit the scene and get told Robo-Dog's direction by the pups.

Skye finds Robo-Dog yet again, heading for her helicopter, and is asked by Ryder to get it close to Rocky's truck. She agrees to do what she can. Meanwhile down on land, Rocky sets up his catapult to launch a magnet in the hopes of it sticking to Robo-Dog and providing Skye with a surface to attach her hook to. As Robo-Dog passes by, the magnet is successfully attached to Robo-Dog and Skye deploys her hook. On the second try, Skye manages to capture Robo-Dog and bring it down to land.

Ryder shuts down Robo-Dog and states sadly that he'll have to work on improvements. But, Rocky runs in with a recycled antenna and gives it to Ryder to act as a replacement for the broken one. Ryder switches the antenna and reboots Robo-Dog, with positive results. Everyone is happy and excited to play with the fixed Robo-Dog, and afterward there is a montage of their fun and games. The story ends with Marshall dancing synchronously with Robo-Dog, and later falling on it after a tailspin. Everyone is momentarily worried about Robo-Dog's condition, but to everyone's relief, Robo-Dog (and its antenna), is perfectly fine."

The story begins with Katie and Ryder watching a video of Mandy the Monkey, who is sick and being cared for by the veterinarian in the big city. Now that Mandy is better, she is being transported by train back to the jungle, but the train is making a pit stop in Adventure Bay, and Katie wants to see how Mandy is doing.

At the train station, Marshall and Rubble are with Mr. Porter, as the same train carrying Mandy is also delivering a fresh shipment of produce for Mr. Porter's store. Mandy is fast asleep in her car, but when the train screeches to a stop, Mandy is flung from her swing and woken with a start. The sudden stop also cracks the door to her car open slightly, allowing her to escape outside and watch the unloading of Mr. Porter's produce.

After getting her hands on a banana dropped by Mr. Porter and the pups, Mandy hears Katie and Ryder coming, and flees for the front of the station. When Ryder and Katie discover Mandy's car open and Mandy gone, Mandy finds Mr. Porter's van, full of fresh bananas from the train, and not only digs in to her primate nature's favorite fruit, but even drives off with the van as well. Katie is horrified, knowing Mandy can't be allowed to rampage through town, and Ryder assures her he and the PAW Patrol will get Mandy back to her car. He calls the pups, they head to the Lookout, and Marshall has his usual crash into the elevator.

The orders are clear: Find Mandy, retrieve Mr. Porter's van, and get Mandy back to her car for transport to her jungle home. Ryder deploys with Chase and Skye, and they set off to find Mandy.

Skye spots Mandy as she drives wildly and crazily around City Hall. By the time Ryder and Chase catch up, Mandy has now driven Mr. Porter's van to where it is now locked on the railroad tracks, and another train is heading directly for her.

Chase tries to get Mandy to pull over, but gets a banana peel thrown in his face for his troubles. With the train getting closer, Ryder has no choice but to set his ATV to auto-pilot and commandeer the van from Mandy, steering it off the tracks just in time, and then bringing it to a stop.

Mandy, however, is still full of energy, and flees to the nearby playground, gaining the attention of Julius and Julia Goodway. Ryder and Chase try to lure Mandy down to catch her with a fresh banana, but the plan backfires, and Mandy, after giving Chase and Ryder a good raspberry for failing to catch her, flees once more on Ryder's own ATV.

While Chase resumes pursuit, Ryder gets a lift from Mr. Porter now that he had his van back, and find Mandy heading for the Lookout. While Skye provides over-watch, Ryder and Chase formulate a plan to finally catch Mandy. In the Lookout tower, Marshall is waiting for Mandy, but while Mandy enjoys the pillows and goes wild, Ryder and Chase arrive in the elevator and prepare for their plan. First off, Marshall seals the doors to the Lookout's balcony, trapping Mandy inside, and leaving her puzzled. Next, Ryder attempts to lure Mandy with another banana, but this time, he lures her into chasing it down the slide used by the pups to board their vehicles. Complete with a name call like the pups, Mandy goes down the slide, and lands in the back of Mr. Porter's van, where Mr. Porter and Katie close the doors and finally catch her. Ryder quickly reminds Mr. Porter to get in the driver's seat before Mandy gets there and steals the van again.

Back at the station, Mandy is back in her car, but now with a huge pile of bananas as well. As Mandy enjoys her meal, swinging back and forth with each time grabbing a fresh banana from the pile, the train departs to take her home. Katie, Ryder, and the pups see Mandy off, and are happy she is going home. Mr. Porter soon joins them, his van now fully loaded with his fresh produce, but is upset that Mandy ate all the bananas. Marshall is upset due to his own love for bananas, but Mr. Porter reveals he salvaged enough of them for some fresh banana muffins. Understanding what Mr. Porter wants them to do to get one, Marshall begins acting like a monkey. After Marshall is rewarded and continues acting like a monkey, the others join in, leaving Katie, Ryder, and Mr. Porter to laugh at the pups and their ""monkey business"".

Pups Save a Hoot:

The story begins with a windy morning in Adventure Bay, at a tree that is home to a mother owl and her baby. When the strong winds cause the trunk to crack, and the tree starts to fall, the mother owl orders her baby to flee, just in time. After the tree falls over, the baby owl goes to check on his mother, who is trapped in the knothole where they live, unable to escape. Although the mother owl tries to show her baby she's fine, the wind picks up again, carrying the baby owl all the way to the Lookout.

The baby owl arrives and passes by Rubble's pup house, then bumps into the door of Chase's pup house, waking him up. As Chase gives the baby owl the name ""Little Hootie"", he wonders what's wrong. As Little Hootie hoots his emergency, he then wants Chase to follow him. Chase follows Little Hootie all the way back to his tree, where Little Hootie reveals that his mother is trapped inside. Chase attempts to dig an opening out from under the tree, but he is forced to stop when the tree slides further towards the cliff edge. Fearing for the owl inside, Chase knows they need more help, and takes Little Hootie back to the Lookout to get Ryder.

Ryder is doing his repairs on the engine on his ATV when Chase calls him. As Chase tells about his friend and the problem, Ryder is impressed that Chase can understand Little Hootie's hoots, and agrees to help. After Marshall crashes into Chase as Chase warns him to watch out for Little Hootie, the pups get topside and get their orders: Chase and Rubble will go with Ryder to try and prevent the tree from going over the cliff edge, and create a means for the larger owl to escape before the tree goes over. The PAW Patrol deploys, and upon reaching the tree, get right to work, at least after Chase saves Little Hootie when he falls off the severed trunk as he falls asleep, due to owls normally being nocturnal. With Little Hootie asleep in Chase's hat, Chase leaves him on a flat rock then gets to work, quietly barking to activate his winch.

Once Chase has secured his winch, Rubble starts digging. Little Hootie wakes up to check on his mother, but the tree begins to slip further toward the cliff edge. Chase's police truck is being dragged after it by his winch, but he is able to anchor it against a large rock to stabilize the tree. Chase knows the branch that his winch is wrapped around will not last much longer, but Rubble figures something out and uses his bulldozer to lift the tree high enough for Little Hootie's mom to escape, and just in time as well. The branch finally snaps, and the tree slides over the edge completely and into the sea.

With Little Hootie and his mother safe, Chase introduces himself to Mama Hootie, and even Rubble recognizes the response, saying that ""you don't have to speak Owl, to tell that was a thank you."" Chase responds by telling her ""You're welcome. Whenever you're in trouble, just hoot for help!""

Chase soon finds a much thicker and sturdier tree for them to live in now. As Mama and Little Hootie move into their new home, Chase is saddened, until Rubble reminds him he can always visit them from time to time to see how they are doing. This perks Chase up, and he, Rubble, and Ryder quietly hoot ""sleep tight,"" to Little Hootie and his mother as they get a good day's sleep, while Ryder, Rubble, and Chase return to the Lookout, the story ending with a shot of Mama and Little Hootie as they sleep peacefully in their new home."

It's Mayor Goodway, and she needs help: She can't ring the City Hall bell to wake up Chickaletta, as a baby bat has fallen asleep underneath the large bell, and ringing the bell will wake it up and scare it. Ryder tells Mayor Goodway the PAW Patrol are on their way, and summons the pups. Marshall and Chase are deployed to help retrieve the bat without waking it, while Skye is deployed later to find the bat's cave in the mountains.

When they reach the City Hall, Marshall is about to get the baby bat into the pet carrier, but Chase accidentally wakes the bat up when he uses his megaphone to remind Marshall not to wake it himself. The result: Marshall is trapped in the pet carrier himself, and Chase ends up ensnaring himself and Marshall in his net. Despite the mess-up, Mayor Goodway can now use her bell-ringing app on her cellphone to ring the bell and wake Chickaletta up. Ryder wonders where the bat went now, and gets a call from Katie, revealing the baby bat is now sleeping on the crossbar of the goal at the soccer field.

When Ryder, Chase, and Marshall arrive, Alex makes a joke about how bats are for baseball, not soccer, earning a few laughs. Chase secures the area to ensure the bat sleeps this time, but when a seagull perches near the bat, Chase is forced to be lifted up by Ryder and Katie to quietly scare the seagull off. The bat starts to wake up after the seagull makes a loud squawk after being startled by Chase, but Chase is able to sing him back to sleep, allowing Marshall to come in and carefully get the bat into the pet carrier this time. Meanwhile, Skye finds the cave, and confirms it when she scans it with the thermal vision on her goggles.

When Chase and Ryder arrive, they attempt to convince the baby to rejoin its swarm, but the baby bat spots the mother eagle, and flees back into the pet carrier for safety. With the mother eagle's nest preventing the baby bat from entering the cave, the team have to look for another entrance. Skye finds one that the team can enter as well. Once Chase takes a look using the low-beam feature of his light, the baby bat is released, and rejoins its parents. Soon after, Ryder, Chase, and Skye watch as the baby bat and the swarm itself take off for breakfast due to the sun going down and bats being nocturnal, much to the pups amazement.

Back at the Lookout, the pups are having some last-minute fun before going to bed, but the baby bat shows up to join them. Ryder agrees to have the pups sleep outside with their new bat friend, and despite a pile-up occurring thanks to Marshall, Ryder leaves the pups and the baby bat to get a good night's sleep while he heads back to the Lookout for the night, the story ending with the camera zooming in on the pups, now fast asleep with their new friend.

As they vie for pulling it out from their dig spot, Zuma joins Rubble to make it two-against-one, winning the tug war and pulling the toy completely up from its bury spot. It is not long before Rubble and Chase start pulling on their ends of the toy, and while Zuma joins Rubble again, Marshall joins Chase to make it two-on-two. That is until Chase releases in shock due to a pain in his mouth, sending Marshall into a pile-up with the other pups. When Marshall asks what's wrong, Chase reveals that his puppy fang is loose by wiggling it with his tongue, and he now speaks with a lisp.

As he is ready to start preparing to take Alex to the dentist for a checkup, Alex stops dead in his tracks at the mention of the dentist, and despite trying to show his grandfather his teeth are healthy, Mr. Porter goes to prepare the van.

Back at the Lookout, Ryder soon learns of Chase's loose tooth, but like Alex, the mention of the dentist sends Chase whimpering, while cowering, back to his pup house in sheer nervousness.

At Mr. Porter's, Alex has fled up into his tree house in an attempt to hide himself. When his grandfather tells him to come down, Alex purposefully unhinges several of the steps with a toy hammer, leading up to the tree house to trap himself up there. Alex thinks now it will take too long for his grandfather to find a ladder to get him down, and go to the dentist, but his spirits fall when his grandfather mentions calling the PAW Patrol to help.

Ryder is still trying to coax Chase into going to the dentist himself when Mr. Porter calls in regards to Alex. When Mr. Porter tries to show Ryder the situation with Alex, he ducks back into his tree house, out of sight, and even tries to tell both Ryder, and his grandfather, that he is OK not going to the dentist. Ryder assures Mr. Porter that they are on their way, but Alex tries to forestall seeing the dentist by asking Ryder not to hurry.

Ryder calls the pups, and after Marshall ties everyone up with the tug toy after getting the free end stuck in the entrance doors, causing it to snap back into Marshall and the others, they reach the top and get their orders: Ryder will go with Marshall and Chase to rescue Alex, and then provide Alex a police escort to the dentist.

The PAW Patrol deploy, and when they reach Mr. Porter's, Marshall gets right to work rescuing Alex. Alex is cowering in the corner of his treehouse, and when Marshall tries to coax him into coming down, Alex makes it clear he is not coming down, telling Marshall that he's scared of the dentist, and slamming the floor door shut in Marshall's face, leaving him confused. Seeing that he needs to talk to Alex boy-to-boy, Ryder offers to climb up and talk to Alex. Despite Ryder offering Alex a police escort from Chase to the dentist, he too gets the door slammed in his face when Alex agrees to the escort, but only to anywhere but the dentist. Not giving up, Ryder offers Alex a deal: If Ryder gets the PAW Patrol to show off what they are scared of, that will convince Alex to conquer his own fear. Alex shows interest in seeing what the pups are scared of, and Ryder agrees to call them to help out.

Once the rest of the pups show up, Ryder wonders which of them would be willing to show what they are scared of first. None of the pups seem too eager to volunteer, so Ryder goes first, revealing that while he goes into life-threatening situations every day with the pups, there is one thing that really gives Ryder nightmares: Brussels sprouts, and he asks Mr. Porter to fetch some. As everyone watches, Ryder is able to somehow swallow one, much to Alex's amusement, but it is still not enough to convince Alex to come down. Ryder however, shows that he was able to conquer his fear, so now it's the pups' turn.

Rocky volunteers to go next, knowing it would be best to get his aquaphobia, or fear of water, out of the way first, and has Marshall hose him down. Next up is Rubble and his arachnophobia, or fear of spiders. After that, it is Marshall and Skye's turn, with Marshall's fear of flying and Skye's fear of eagles. During Rubble's turn of facing his fear, Alex has moved from inside his tree house to sitting on the top rungs of Marshall's ladder, enjoying the PAW Patrol facing their fears. When it is over, Alex is finally convinced to overcoming his own fear and going to the dentist. However, Ryder has one last job for Alex: Chase is also afraid of the dentist, but if Alex shows him how brave he can be, it can help Chase overcome his fear as well.

With that, Chase nervously escorts Alex and Mr. Porter in their van, with Ryder following behind, to the Adventure Bay Dentist's Office. Upon arrival, Chase gulps in worry, but Alex suggests that they can walk in at the same time, as everyone else cheers. Soon everyone waits, bored, for Alex and Chase to emerge. When they do, they each have a sticker from the dentist for their good behavior, and Alex even got a brand new toothbrush out of it! Chase shows that even though his fang has been removed, an adult tooth will grow in its place, and he can even whistle through where it was.

Back at the Lookout, Chase wraps his tooth up in a cloth for the Tooth Fairy to collect. The next morning, Chase excitedly awakens the pups to reveal that the Tooth Fairy left him a brand-new bone for his tooth, but when Chase bites into it, another shot of pain occurs in his mouth, revealing that his other fang is now loose, ending the story as the rest of the pups all laugh."

The story starts with Skye and Rocky practicing for their camping trip with Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta for several new Pup Scout badges. Once they are all set, Ryder wishes them good luck as they set off into the woods.

Once on their own in the woods, Mayor Goodway is able to guide Skye and Rocky on the steps to setting up their tents and the campfire, including making sure that all flammable materials, like leaves and twigs, that could be ignited by a spark from the campfire, are out of the danger area. Once the campfire and tents are set up, the pups are excited to now go hunting for sticks for roasting marshmallows with. They split up, with Skye and Rocky going as one pair, and Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta as another.

While Mayor Goodway tries to find the right stick, Chickaletta is more interested in several berry bushes, but when attempting to reach one further away, she falls into a small crevasse. Mayor Goodway can't reach her, and goes to find Skye and Rocky. When she returns with the pups, Rocky's pup-pack's claw arm can't extend far enough into the crevasse to reach Chickaletta, and it is too narrow for Skye to use her pup-pack's wings in. With no other option, Mayor Goodway calls Ryder, while Chickaletta enjoys the berries on the bushes in the crevasse.

When Ryder gets word of Chickaletta in trouble, he summons the other pups and gives them their orders. With Chase and Rubble joining him for the rescue, Ryder heads out to meet up with the Mayor and the Pup Scouts.

When they arrive, Rubble clears away the rocks from the edge of the crevasse, and when Mayor Goodway still asks, in a panic, if Chickaletta is okay, a burp from her purse chicken leaves the Mayor a little embarrassed.

The PAW Patrol need to attach Chase's winch to one of the pups so they can descend and get Chickaletta, and Skye, being the smallest, volunteers. Afterwards, everyone is out of the crevasse.

With Chickaletta rescued, and the night sky clear and full of stars, Ryder and the other pups agree to spend the night with the Pup Scouts. Mayor Goodway, Rocky, and Skye worry that they don't have enough tents, but Marshall, Zuma, and Chase simply order their vehicles to convert back into their pup houses.

Mayor Goodway awards Ryder a special Pup Scouts badge for saving Chickaletta, and the gang enjoy a final laugh after Marshall accidentally soaks Rocky when he says he burnt the marshmallows, now leaving the marshmallows burnt and soggy.

Pups and the Trouble with Turtles:

The story begins with Rocky rousing for the day. He sleepily walks over to his water bowl and sees a baby turtle paddling in circles. The other pups find several more baby turtles around the Lookout, intrigued by this new find. Ryder finds one as well, while wondering where they all came from. Meanwhile, the pups give names to the turtles, with Skye naming her choice Star and Marshall's Joey. Ryder, in his own hands, attempts to locate the turtles' habitat within the Lookout's gadgets. After getting another turtle out of the periscope, Ryder notices that a pond near Farmer Yumi's is empty. Assuming that is the turtles' home, Ryder calls the pups. For once, Marshall doesn't crash into the elevator as he carefully and silently walks in, revealing that Star is fast asleep on his back. He even trails behind while joining the others, causing Ryder to ask what's the holdup before Marshall explains that if he walks at the speed of a turtle, he won't wake Star up, as she stretches and yawns before returning to sleep.

Ryder starts to brief them on the situation from what he saw through the periscope. He doesn't get far before the screen goes dead for some reason. Finding more turtles down in the area under the control panel, having messed with the wires, Ryder lets them out while Chase captures them in his net. Before Chase catches the turtles, Ryder restarts the screen and resumes the briefing, and asks Rubble to join him with heading to the pond. With that, Ryder and Rubble head out, while the other pups take care of Star and the other turtles.

When they arrive, they find one turtle still there in what water is left in the bottom of the pond. Assuring the turtle that his friends are on their way home, Ryder has Rubble dig a new hole for the underwater reservoir to use to fill up the pond.

Meanwhile, back at the Lookout, the pups finally find a solution to keep the turtles from wandering off by creating a playground for them.

Back at the pond, Rubble finally strikes home, and creates a new hole for the water to fill the pond. However, the pond is filling faster than expected, and Rubble is in danger of his rig being drowned as the pond fills. He tries to start it and escape, but water has already gotten into the engine and flooded it, stalling it out. With Rubble needing help, Ryder calls Chase and Zuma to come over and help. Acting quickly, Zuma takes Chase's winch and dives into the pond, wrapping the winch around the drill arm of Rubble's rig. With the winch secured, Chase pulls Rubble and his rig to safety. A little while later, the digger's engine is cleaned out and dried, and Rubble is able to restart it. With the pond refilled, Ryder calls Skye to let her know she can bring the turtles home.

Once they arrive, the turtles rejoin the one that was already there, but Star has a little more fun with Skye, tickling her before joining her friends, and then offering a wink of thanks to the PAW Patrol. Ryder ends the story with a remix of the PAW Patrol motto, saying that if Star or the other turtles ever need help again, they just have to tickle for help, as a turtle tickles Ryder by climbing up his back, earning laughs from the pups along with himself."

As the story opens, Marshall and Rubble are helping Farmer Yumi with planting seeds, while Chickaletta eats them before Yumi shoves her off for eating the seeds, and Chickaletta scoffs at Yumi before getting scared off by Alex Porter as he pretends to be a giant. Yumi decides it is really hot out, and decides to take a break. Rubble goes to sleep under a large tree, but as he dozes off, he takes one more look at Alex, then falls asleep.

As the scene transitions to Rubble's dream, he's awoken by Marshall, who is rising into the air on a huge beanstalk. Rubble orders Marshall down, but Marshall is unsure, until he sees Alex, now a giant straight out of Jack and the Beanstalk, climbing down. Yumi catches Marshall as he falls, and while Alex does his best to avoid causing damage, Marshall and Rubble decide to call Ryder. Once Ryder sees the situation, he summons the pups to the Lookout. Marshall is bounced inside by Alex's thundering footsteps, and the pups are in shock as Alex watches them go up the elevator. Once topside, it's clear all six pups are needed for this situation, but as they deploy, Alex interrupts the deployment as he helps Rubble down into his rig. As the team takes off, Ryder suggests they split up to cover more ground.

They soon find Alex playing with Cap'n Turbot's ship, the Flounder, but after getting him to put it down, he wanders off again, this time to City Hall to have some fun with Mayor Goodway (specifically lifting the roof off the building and grabbing her, believing it to be a game of hide-and-seek) before helping her find Chickaletta (by flinging her into Farmer Yumi's farm, where she safely lands on a pile of hay). Alex later wanders off to get some lemonade from the cup that's part of the lemonade stand's display, but leaves disappointed to his grandfather's restaurant for some fruit smoothies instead. Seeing that Alex loves his grandfather's smoothies, Ryder gets an idea on how to get him back up the beanstalk. Rubble and Rocky head off to get fruit from Farmer Yumi, while Chase and Marshall will recover the giant lemonade cup that Alex discarded earlier to use to lure him back up the beanstalk. Chase and Marshall are delayed heading to do their part when Alex picks up Chase's truck and plays with it, much to Chase's annoyance as Alex is tampering with official police property, and imitating a siren that neither Chase nor Marshall use. Alex finally sets Chase down, and off he and Marshall go.

They soon have things ready as Marshall fills the lemonade cup with the smoothie, and Skye airlifts it to get Alex's attention, as he was busy playing with Mr. Hudson and his train at the time. Skye is able to lure Alex back to the beanstalk, and back up for good. After a few tense moments of waiting to see if Skye comes back down, Skye returns safely, and the pups cheer. A loud burp from Alex ends the celebrations as he pardons himself and thanks the pups for playing with him. Afterwards, as Ryder congratulates the pups, the scene transitions back to reality from Rubble's dream as Rubble is awoken by Marshall, who's using his hose as a sprinkler to water the crops.

Rubble is still coming to from his dream, believing it was real, and tries to explain what he saw in it to everyone, but Ryder decides that Rubble needs to lay off the treats before bed. However, he assures Rubble that if he ever has another wild dream again, he can always turn to the PAW Patrol for help, ending the story as Rubble laughs at that assurance.

Pups Save the Turbots:

As the pups enjoy another day at the beach, Marshall suffers another of his clumsy crashes, and believes he is so dazed, he is seeing four legs on Cap'n Turbot instead of two. When he comes to, he finds that Cap'n Turbot is joined by his French cousin, Francois Turbot. It is also revealed that Cap'n Turbot's first name is Horatio. While Francois Turbot soon befriends the pups, and gains the admiration of Skye, Cap'n Turbot is on the lookout for the blue-footed booby bird.

While Cap'n Turbot tries to find the booby bird, Francois has some fun kite flying. Seeing Skye's adoration for Francois, Rubble tries to get her attention back by trying to imitate Francois, to little success. Wally soon helps Cap'n Turbot find the booby bird, but in his excitement, Cap'n Turbot falls off the Flounder, while the booby bird flies away. Worse, he left the Flounder in gear, and the boat takes off without him. He tasks Wally with telling Ryder of the situation, and the walrus does just that.

Wally soon finds Ryder, and Ryder is able to translate Wally's charades into learning of Cap'n Turbot's plight, and assures Wally that he'll call the pups. With that, Ryder calls the pups to the Lookout, and after Marshall and Rubble crash into the elevator, with Marshall gaining Rubble's beret and facial features from his Frenchman outfit, they reach the top and get their orders. Skye and Zuma will head out to help save Cap'n Turbot and get him back the Flounder. With that, the team deploys, and soon are able to rescue Cap'n Turbot, while Ryder commandeers the Flounder and is able to stop it.

Francois soon crash-lands on the ship, and agrees to help Cap'n Turbot find the booby bird. With Skye's help, the booby bird is soon spotted at its nest, but Francois takes off without being warned off the booby bird's sensitivity. As a result, when Francois takes the booby bird's picture without permission, the bird goes on the attack, causing Francois to soon be hanging from the cliff by one hand. Skye flies Cap'n Turbot in via her harness to try and save Francois, but the booby bird steps on Francois' hand, causing him to let go and fall in the water. Zuma saves him, and Cap'n Turbot is able to ask the booby bird for its picture. The bird agrees, and even poses for it. Back on the Flounder, Cap'n Turbot mentions that once he learns more of the booby bird's nature and habitat, more will migrate to Adventure Bay. Francois, traumatized by his encounter, asks that not happen, much to everyone's laughter.

Back at the Lookout, Cap'n Turbot presents a picture of the booby bird to Ryder as thanks, and when both Turbots spot Rubble on his skateboard, Rubble, in a show of good faith at not being jealous of Francois anymore, offers him a ride on it. However, Francois shows he is a very bad skateboarder, and crashes into Cap'n Turbot. In the end, the Turbots share a high-five, and everyone laughs as the story comes to an end."

The story starts at the Lookout, with Zuma and Rubble as they stare and growl each other down, before it is revealed that they are practicing for a big Pup Pup Boogie competition that's coming up. Rubble is easily matching Zuma move for move as his paws dance at a rapid pace, but when shown to perform the split, he can't recover afterwards, and is eliminated. Skye steps up next, but when performing the tailspin maneuver, she loses control and crashes, eliminating her. Marshall is next to take on Zuma.

Elsewhere, Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, and Alex are enjoying collecting pictures of sea animals for a calendar. Wally appears to hopefully get his picture taken, but Mayor Goodway and Alex spot a young, pink, Narwhal whale that would be perfect for the calendar, and set out in a rowboat to get its picture, leaving Wally upset.

Back at the Lookout, Marshall is doing a great job keeping up with Zuma, who even does a little scatting as he shows how well he's practiced. When Marshall attempts a jump maneuver, he goes too far and crashes into Rocky's wagon, spilling the old tennis balls Rocky was collecting to recycle before then crashing into Zuma. Marshall's eliminated, so Chase is next up to face Zuma.

Over at Seal Island, Cap'n Turbot is watching Mayor Goodway and Alex as they attempt to catch up to the Narwhal and get its picture. Soon however, the Narwhal dives for deep water as the skies start to turn an ominous purple, indicating a strong thunderstorm is on its way. Worrying for Mayor Goodway and Alex, Cap'n Turbot prepares to head out on the Flounder to pick them up and get them back to shore, but in his haste, he forgets his raincoat. As he heads back into the lighthouse to retrieve it, the wind blows the door shut and knocks over an oar, barricading the door shut and trapping Cap'n Turbot inside the lighthouse. Upon discovering he's trapped, Cap'n Turbot contacts Ryder to warn him.

As the other pups cheer them on, Ryder is busy playing video-games on his pup-pad and not paying attention. He soon gets Cap'n Turbot's SOS asking for help with both himself, and Mayor Goodway and Alex. Ryder complies, and calls the pups. Chase and Zuma are still battling each other, keeping up with moves and stars, when they have to postpone their rivalry on the game to respond to Ryder's summon. Marshall crashes into several of the spilled tennis balls as he attempts to enter the elevator, but somehow manages to get them all piled up back on Rocky's wagon where he was collecting them, save for one that bonks Marshall on the head and earns laughs from the other pups. Once topside, Ryder passes out orders: Zuma and Skye will join Ryder with rescuing Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, and Alex, and then they will help Cap'n Turbot. Zuma wants to finish the mission ASAP as he wants to get back to beating Chase on Pup Pup Boogie. The team deploys, but no sooner has Ryder converted his ATV to hovercraft mode, when the skies are now full of storm clouds as Adventure Bay is hit by the storm Cap'n Turbot saw developing earlier with rain pouring down hard, lightning flashing in the clouds, and the waves starting to get fierce and choppy.

Skye is having difficulties staying airborne due to the fierce storm winds, and soon has no choice but to divert to Seal Island for an emergency landing until the storm clears. Ryder understands her choice, but decides she can still help rescue Cap'n Turbot and provide lookout with him from the lighthouse.

Meanwhile, with the storm raging all around them, Mayor Goodway and Alex attempt to row back to shore. Alex only manages to row them in circles, and after Mayor Goodway is calmed by a splash of water to the face from a wave, she tries to help Alex with rowing back to shore. Unfortunately, while Alex enjoys the ride as the boat is carried along by the stormy seas, one of the oars falls overboard, causing Mayor Goodway to really become panicked. After the boat is carried away, Wally surfaces to see what's happening out of concern and curiosity and grabs the oar to return to Mayor Goodway and Alex.

Back at Seal Island, Skye makes her emergency landing, and soon removes the oar blocking Cap'n Turbot from getting out. After Cap'n Turbot thanks Skye for her help, they head to the top of the lighthouse to look for Mayor Goodway and Alex, spotting them just north of Seal Island, along with Wally as he returns the lost oar to them. Skye relays the location to Ryder and Zuma, and they head to intercept.

Back with the boat, Alex is still staying nice and calm, even commenting on the sunset, while Mayor Goodway continues to freak out. When Alex spots Ryder and Zuma approaching, Mayor Goodway finally calms down now that she knows they are about to be rescued. Zuma attempts to hook his buoy onto the front of the boat, but the strong winds from the storm cause it to fall short. Mayor Goodway attempts to retrieve it, but nearly causes either the boat to capsize, or her to fall overboard, before Wally appears to catch Mayor Goodway with his head and help with the rescue. Thanks to Wally's aid, Ryder retrieves the oar, while Wally passes Zuma's buoy to Mayor Goodway to secure the boat, and Ryder and Zuma start to tow the boat back to shore, however, with the sun going down and nighttime approaching, Ryder decides to tow the boat to Seal Island and hole up there until the storm clears. The other pups watch the rescue from the Lookout, and are relieved to see everyone safe.

Later, the storm finally clears out, and Mayor Goodway and Alex thank Ryder for saving them, Alex especially thanking Wally. Since Wally had become a hero helping with the rescue, Cap'n Turbot allows Alex to give Wally a fish as thanks for his help. Afterwards, as everyone prepares to stay the night at Cap'n Turbot's, Zuma is upset about missing his Pup Pup Boogie showdown with Chase. Cap'n Turbot however, reveals that he loves Pup Pup Boogie and brings everyone to the lighthouse, where he reveals he even has a copy of the Pup Pup Boogie game, allowing Zuma to still participate in the competition. As an added bonus, Ryder contacts Chase over at the Lookout, so they can link the games, and Zuma can still have his battle with Chase after all. The story ends as Zuma and Chase declare ""Let's Boogie!"" and everyone at the lighthouse dances out to the beat of Pup Pup Boogie.

Pups Save Ryder:

The story begins with Ryder enjoying a nice hike along Big View Trail, enjoying the view. His peace is interrupted when he hears bleating and recognizes it as Farmer Yumi's goat, Garbie. Upon investigating, Ryder discovers Garbie on a ledge several feet below the cliff, her horns trapped in some branches. Using a larger tree branch to climb down, when Ryder lets go, the branch recovers, and leaves him stranded with Garbie. Seeing that both of them need help, Ryder calls the pups.

Meanwhile, Marshall, Rubble, and Rocky are helping Mr. Porter with his produce when they get the call. Having to take a break from helping him to respond to Ryder's summon, Mr. Porter gives them each a treat for their help, and wishes them good luck.

At the Lookout, Marshall drops his biscuit, and in his attempt to retrieve it, crashes into the other pups as they enter the tower as he retreats the other way. Once Marshall retrieves his biscuit, at first the other pups glare at him, but once Marshall says he got his biscuit back, they all laugh, and he eats it as they head up. Once at the top of the tower, something is different: Ryder is not waiting for them. Ryder then contacts them on the pup-pad and reveals he needs the pups help to save him and Garbie. Before Ryder can say anymore, including where to find him and Garbie, Garbie struggles to free her horns again, fails, panics, and bucks the pup-pad right out of Ryder's hands! As the pup-pad falls down the cliff, the transmission is broken, leaving the pups concerned about how they are supposed to find Ryder now.

As for the pup-pad, it conveniently lands in the passenger seat of Mr. Porter's van as he drives past on the mountain road below on his deliveries run.

With Ryder unable to contact the pups, and the pups unable to get their orders without Ryder to command them, the pups wonder what to do. Chase steps forward as the second-in-command of the PAW Patrol to command the pups, using his skills as police pup to maintain order and calmness among the pups. Once Rocky suggests using the homing beacon in the pup-pad to try and find Ryder, Chase passes out the orders: Skye will take to the air looking for Ryder, Chase will take the ground, and Rocky will stay at the Lookout to follow the pup-pad's tracking beacon and relay its location to Skye and Chase. With that, the pups deploy, but they nearly forget about Ryder being missing when they stop to wait for Ryder to deploy on his ATV from his garage. Once Skye and Chase notice it empty, and remember that they don't need to wait for Ryder this time, they head out while the garage closes back up.

Back with Ryder and Garbie, Ryder manages to free Garbie's horns from the branches they were trapped in. Afterwards, Ryder wonders if Garbie might be able to climb back up the cliff. Garbie tries, but loses her balance, causing more of the ledge to crumble from her and Ryder's combined weight when he catches her, then Garbie licks Ryder.

Meanwhile, as Skye follows the pup-pad via Rocky's directions, Mr. Porter makes his delivery to Jake, then heads off to continue his deliveries, leaving Skye confused because of how it seems Ryder is moving all over the place. When she finally locates the pup-pad via the tracking beacon, all she sees is Mr. Porter's van. Thinking that Ryder must be with Mr. Porter, Rocky has Chase perform a police traffic stop and pull Mr. Porter over. When Mr. Porter learns of the situation, he is confused. When Chase sniffs out the pup-pad and finds it in the passenger seat, he relays the bad news to Skye and Rocky.

As Rocky starts to whimper and whine at how they might not find Ryder, he realizes they can rewind the pup-pad's travels back to where Ryder first called them. Using his screwdriver, Rocky rewinds the footage, and finds that Ryder called them from Big View Trail. Skye is soon there, and spots Ryder and Garbie, but upon seeing more of the ledge crumble, relays for more backup. Marshall and Rubble respond, and once Rubble clears the rocks away, Marshall attempts to reach Ryder with his ladder. But, the ladder is just short of reaching Ryder. Luckily, Skye flies in with Ryder's harness and has him climb into it. Garbie leaps into Ryder's arms, and Skye carries them both to safety just in time as the ledge crumbles away even more, leaving no room to stand on it anymore. As Chase, Marshall, and Rubble cheer from the road, Skye carries Ryder and Garbie back to the Lookout.

When Skye arrives home to the Lookout and drops Ryder off, Zuma and Rocky run over to embrace Ryder by licking him, Zuma just smiling. They are both happy Ryder is safe. Skye joins them just after that to embrace Ryder as well. Chase, Marshall, and Rubble soon follow after with Chase licking Ryder, and then Mr. Porter arrives offering a snack of watermelon for everyone. Before Ryder can eat his piece, Garbie devours it. Ryder can only guess that Garbie must be really hungry from being on the ledge for so long, and Garbie makes it clear as she eats the pups' slices of watermelon as well. Mr. Porter assures he still has plenty of watermelon to go around, and when Ryder mentions that Garbie will eat just about anything, he is horrified to see Garbie crush the pup-pad in her mouth, then swallow it whole after chewing on it. Luckily, the pups provide a spare pup-pad for Ryder, and remind him of the PAW Patrol motto: ""Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!""

The story ends as everyone laughs over how the pups are ready for just about anything, including if the pup-pad is destroyed by an unintentional accident."

Ryder and the pups are finishing preparations for the Great Race, including anchoring Mayor Goodway's balloon so she has a bird's eye view and can call the race from above. An argument between the pups about who will win, including Skye mentioning she is competing fair and square and not taking any shortcuts, is interrupted as Ryder calls the PAW Patrol to the Lookout. Following the pups trying to enter the elevator at once, and Marshall being flung into the elevator while the others fly backward, leading to Marshall announcing he won the race into the elevator, the pups learn that Ryder has called them to give them a final rundown of the race course. With that, the PAW Patrol deploy and head to the starting line.

The race is about to start when Alex pulls up to participate as well on his super-trike. Rubble at first says he can't do so, but Ryder agrees to allow Alex to participate since the race is in good fun. With Mayor Goodway giving the command, the pups and Alex take off.

A few lead changes between Zuma, Chase, and Marshall result in several of the pups being covered in watermelon as they pass Mr. Porter's restaurant. As the pups and Alex leave Adventure Bay's streets and head for Jake's Mountain, trouble appears when Jake unintentionally moves some of the cones Chase laid down to let some snowboarders through, leading to the pups and Alex taking a slight detour down the ski slopes. The pups and Alex soon return to Adventure Bay and make the next leg around the Lookout to return to the starting line. Along the way, Marshall gets turned around by the other pups, and nearly ends up going the other way (but he soon turns back around), and an incident at Katie's Pet Parlor with Katie and Cali leads to the pups being spun out by a wall of soap and bubbles, while Alex is unharmed due to his slower speed.

During the race, Mayor Goodway offered Chickaletta a corn cob to munch on, but Chickaletta's poking and prodding causes the cob to fall out of both Mayor Goodway's purse and the balloon itself. Upset at losing her meal, or out of curiosity, Chickaletta pokes away at the anchoring rope of the balloon, fraying it until it snaps and the balloon rises into the air.

Ryder notices when he hears Mayor Goodway's cries for help, and calls the pups to assist with recovering Mayor Goodway and her balloon, having Skye airlift Ryder to the balloon, while the others rendezvous at the soccer field. With the pups dealing with the emergency that just occurred, Alex finds himself heading to the finish line in the lead with no-one else around.

Once Skye gets Ryder to the balloon, Ryder cuts off the flame so the balloon descends, and the other pups take two new anchor ropes and secure the balloon safely on the ground. Mayor Goodway is grateful to the pups, but Chickaletta has fallen asleep despite it being her fault this happened. With Mayor Goodway now safe, Ryder reminds the pups that they still have a race to finish, and Alex is almost to the finish line.

Despite getting back in the race as quickly as they could, Chase is the closest to Alex, with Zuma right behind. The race to the finish begins, ending in a photo finish between Chase and Alex. When Ryder reviews the picture, Alex crossed the finish first, making him the winner. Despite that, Ryder knows the pups are all winners for helping save Mayor Goodway, as the citizens cheer for Alex and the PAW Patrol.

Pups Take the Cake:

The story begins with Mayor Goodway, Mr. Porter, Ryder, and the pups watching a video of last year's Tallest and Tastiest Cake Competition, which was won by Mayor Goodway's arch-rival, Mayor Humdinger of Foggy Bottom. This year, Mr. Porter is representing Adventure Bay in the competition, but when he hears that his entry has to be at City Hall by lunchtime, Mr. Porter races back to his restaurant in a panic at what little time he has to get the cake done. Marshall and Rubble offer to help and lick the bowl afterwards, but Mr. Porter is too busy now to give them that chance as he is busy enough getting all the cakes baked and building the cake one brick at a time. It turns out Mr. Porter's cake for the competition is one styled after the PAW Patrol's Lookout tower. They need 1,000 cake bricks, but Alex, despite his attempts to help his grandfather, has only made three, due to being distracted by his toy cars and racetrack.

Suddenly, Marshall smells smoke, and Mr. Porter realizes his cakes are burning. Marshall attempts to extinguish the blaze, but only soaks Mr. Porter, who holds the trays of his two burnt cakes and realizes this puts him severely behind as he now has to re-bake the burnt cakes and needs more ingredients. Seeing Mr. Porter needs help, Marshall and Rubble suggest calling Ryder and the other pups for assistance. Mr. Porter does so, and Ryder summons the pups to the Lookout. Marshall is still holding the carton of eggs he was given in his mouth, and ends up having the eggs fall out and into his mouth, forcing him to unintentionally spit them into the elevator and splatter them over the elevator walls and the other pups.

For once, none of the pups laugh at Marshall's goof-up, and only groan at his egg-related joke about his accident. Once in the tower, Ryder gives the pups their orders, and the pups deploy to help Mr. Porter. When they arrive, they get right to work. Despite Marshall accidentally covering Mr. Porter in cake batter, with the pups' help, the cake is baked and finished, but Mr. Porter is delayed again when Rubble trips on Alex's toy cars and spills the icing on Marshall. Alex apologizes for not cleaning up his toys, but his grandfather is not angry with him, knowing it was an accident. However, Mr. Porter is still upset that they must make more frosting, but when Ryder tells him it will be finished in time if they all work together, then Mr. Porter and Alex both cheer up.

With the pups and Alex's help, the Lookout cake is still iced and fully completed in time to be delivered to the City Hall, but Marshall realizes it doesn't have a slide. With time critical, they have to go without one, but due to the cake being top-heavy, the PAW Patrol are pressed with finding a way to stabilize it so it doesn't fall over. Alex offers his toy cars' racetrack as a means to help, and with the track, the cake now has a slide and is stable.

Meanwhile, during the contest, Cap'n Turbot has made a fish cake (made out of real fish), much to the disgust of the judge, but the pleasure of Cali. The judge then tastes Mayor Humdinger's balloon cake, and Mayor Humdinger is sure that his cake will win as before.

With Chase providing police escort in front, and Rocky carrying the cake on his truck's forklift, they barely make it to City Hall before the buzzer sounds, ending submissions to the contest, much to Mayor Humdinger's annoyance that Adventure Bay still got an entry in at the last second.

As everyone waits to see the judge's decision, he measures Mr. Porter's cake to be taller than Mayor Humdinger's and, upon tasting it, also declares it the tastiest, and thus the winner, much to Mayor Humdinger's shock. Mayor Goodway and the others are proud of Mr. Porter and Alex, who thank Ryder and the PAW Patrol for their help. Mr. Porter then decides that now all that is left is for the pups to enjoy his cake, since they did another great job.

While the pups enjoy their cake, Cali develops a tummy-ache from eating too much of Cap'n Turbot's fish cake. Marshall gives the PAW Patrol a good laugh to end the story when he accidentally bumps the table the Lookout cake is on, and the top of the cake falls off on his head, leaving him to eat out the part in front of his face, and Ryder to joke that Marshall really takes the cake."

He is just about to take the first photo, when the booby bird attacks him in defense of its eggs. As Cap'n Turbot steps backward trying to explain himself, he falls down a hole, and ends up stuck in a barrel in a cave underneath. After pulling himself out, and finding the beach crab clamped onto his behind, Cap'n Turbot finds a chest, along with a black flag sporting the all-too familiar Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones. Cap'n Turbot immediately suspects that the cave was a hideout for the legendary Adventure Bay pirate, Captain Blackfur. With him pretty much stuck, Cap'n Turbot calls Ryder for help.

At the Lookout, Ryder is playing basketball with Marshall, Chase, Rubble, and Zuma. Marshall is having a lot of trouble making a basket, as every time he misses, he hits Rubble afterward. After it happens again, the pups head off to find a means to help Marshall out, while Ryder gets Cap'n Turbot's call for help and his hypothesis that he may have stumbled onto Captain Blackfur's hideout. Excited to find some more evidence to Captain Blackfur's existence, Ryder contacts the pups and has them report to the Lookout. Marshall and the others have chosen Rocky's catapult to help Marshall with making a basket, but Ryder's summon causes Marshall to fall on the catapult after the basketball is launched, and the ball activates the catapult, sending Marshall flying into the elevator ahead of the other pups. After Skye reprimands Marshall about how she's the flying pup, and he is more than happy to accept that, the pups report upstairs, and are excited at how they might be hunting for pirate treasure, especially Rubble. Ryder picks Chase and Rubble to assist with helping Cap'n Turbot, and the team heads out to where they last knew of Cap'n Turbot's whereabouts.

When the PAW Patrol arrive, Cap'n Turbot gets their attention, and Chase uses his winch to lower Ryder down into the cave so Cap'n Turbot can show him the pirate paraphernalia he found. Afterward, Ryder has Rubble and Chase come down to join him, even though Rubble is suffering another panic attack from his arachnophobia, since caves are one place where spiders live. After Rubble gets spooked by one, Chase joins them, and Ryder has Rubble try on an old pirate hat that fits Rubble perfectly. Afterward, Chase finds another opening that is blocked by a large rock and a pile of smaller ones. He can smell seawater from outside, and it is not long before Rubble manages to clear away the smaller rocks so they can get to the larger one. Chase then hears distant waves crashing, and Ryder decides to call in Zuma to check to see where they are going to emerge. Luckily, Zuma arrives to point out that the others will emerge on the North Shore Beach, and together, Ryder, Rubble, Chase, and Cap'n Turbot are able to push the large rock aside and get out. Soon, they find a message in a bottle, and realize it is part of a treasure map from Captain Blackfur. Ryder calls Marshall, Skye, and Rocky back at the Lookout, and has them meet up with the others. When they arrive, Ryder reveals the map, but points out that there is no ""X"" marking where the treasure is. However, he does find a cryptic message from Captain Blackfur, saying that he broke the map into three pieces, and they can find the second piece in the mouth of the rock outcropping shaped like a parrot's beak.

The team sets off to find it, while Cap'n Turbot stays behind, disappointed over how the pups get all the excitement and fun out of missions. Skye soon gets to the location first, but finds a little bunny rabbit sleeping on a rock. Soon, the mama eagle appears overhead, and fearing that the little rabbit will be the Mama eagle's next meal, Skye takes flight with her pup-pack to lure the Mama eagle away, giving the rabbit time to wake up, realize the danger, and hop to safety. As for Skye, she is soon in a dogfight with the Mama eagle, but finally manages to lose her, just as the rest of the PAW Patrol arrive. Once they regroup, they soon see the bottle right where the map piece said it would be, and Skye retrieves it. Afterward, Rocky tapes the two pieces together, and the clue from Captain Blackfur on the second piece says that the third piece is located in a knothole of the largest tree in Adventure Bay. Chase realizes that the trees where his owl friend, Little Hootie, lives are full of knotholes, so the last piece must be in one of them. The team immediate set out for the forest where Little Hootie lives, though Rubble nearly gets left behind when he starts acting like a pirate again and does not notice the others leave until a moment or two later.

Skye, Zuma, Rocky, and Rubble are the first to get there, but Rubble's first attempt within a large tree trunk due to his bravado only gets him a spider on his nose that Rocky removes with a shovel from his pup-pack and puts back, revealing that a whole family of spiders lives in the hollow trunk, much to Rubble's disgust and paranoia. Skye's attempt only sends her reeling, pup-pack first, backward against another tree from a sneeze induced by the dust in the knothole she checked. Soon, Ryder, Marshall, and Chase arrive, and Little Hooty comes down to see what's happening. Chase asks Little Hootie if he's seen a bottle in any of the knotholes, and Little Hootie flies over to the knothole where the bottle is located. Marshall drives over to retrieve it with his ladder, but loses his balance and nearly lets the bottle smash on the ground. Luckily, Ryder catches him, and Marshall catches the bottle in his fireman's helmet. After thanking Little Hootie for his help, Ryder has Rocky tape the third piece to the other two, completing the map, and find the ""X"" that marks the spot.

According to Captain Blackfur's instructions, one has to walk 20 paces from where they found the last piece of the map, but Ryder only gets about halfway before he discovers if he went any further, he'd fall into the ocean. Ryder thinks that the map was wrong. However, Marshall takes tiny steps which are consistent with the map's instructions, yet he nearly sends Ryder over the cliff because he was counting too fast. That's when the PAW Patrol spot something anchored on a small island just a short distance from the cliff, but obscured by an eerie, green fog. When Skye flies over to investigate, she discovers it to be Captain Blackfur's old pirate ship. Age has really done a number on the old vessel, as it looks like it is ready to fall apart when the tide changes. Knowing they can't let that happen, the PAW Patrol set out to save the old ship.

While Skye attaches a mooring line to the mainmast, Rubble digs out a channel to bring the ship to the mainland, and Chase has his winch attached to the front of the ship to help Skye pull it in from the small island it's on. Ryder and Zuma overlook the rescue effort from their vehicles, and at first, things seem to be going fine. That is, until the ship's anchor chain goes taut, indicating the anchor must be stuck on something underwater. Ryder and Zuma head down, and find the anchor is indeed stuck between a pair of rocks. When the anchor won't budge upon trying to free it, Zuma kicks his pup-pack's scuba engines into overdrive to provide him the thrust to push one of the rocks out of the way, freeing the anchor, and allowing the ship to resume being pulled to shore. As the other pups cheer, Ryder and Zuma surface to notice a rope ladder dangling off one side of the ship's stern, and decide to climb aboard for a ride.

It is soon sunset, and Cap'n Turbot, Mayor Goodway, Chickaletta, Mayor Goodway's niece and nephew, and several citizens are waiting when the PAW Patrol arrive with Captain Blackfur's ship safely intact. After Mayor Goodway makes a short speech about the PAW Patrol saving a valuable piece of Adventure Bay's history, Ryder invites Cap'n Turbot aboard via Marshall's ladder to help with hauling Blackfur's treasure up from the cargo hold. Once they have it topside, Rocky provides a key to undo the chest's lock, and upon opening it, Ryder, the pups, and Turbot, are amazed by all the gold doubloons, gems, and other treasures inside, such as golden dog bones, and a golden, jewel-encrusted dog bowl. At first, they think that Blackfur had a faithful pirate pup, until they find a portrait of the legendary pirate himself, and discover that Blackfur was a pirate pup. Even more interesting, he looks to be a distant ancestor to Rubble, due to the similar appearance between them, save for Blackfur's trademark black fur beard. Blackfur also left a message requesting what to do with his treasure once it was found. According to his last requests, once his treasure was found, Blackfur wanted it to be returned to the good people of Adventure Bay.

With that, the story ends with a pirate-themed version of the PAW Patrol ending theme, as the pups enjoy playing around Blackfur's ship, and Marshall landing next to Rubble, who now sports a black fur beard just like Blackfur, leaving both to laugh as the story irises out with a skull-and-crossbones iris out to go with the pirate theme of the story."

Civilization has fallen. Vampires rule the streets. Only whispers of a human saviour Have given mankind hope.

Vanessa Helsing lays unconscious on an exam table as rapid fire and screams sound off in the background. Three vampires appear from the shadows, they quickly approach Vanessa with the intent to take her. One vampire feeds from her neck, a moment later he begins to puke up the blood and convulse, eventually falling to the floor. Vanessa then awakens, the other two vampires go in for the attack but she makes quick work of them both, while the initial vampire appears to be going through some form of shock after drinking her blood.

-Flashback* Thirty-six hours earlier Vanessa lays on the table of the exam room, a man named Axel Miller is sitting in a chair next to a cage, explaining to whoever inside that he misses the little things about life, like subway for lunch. Inside the cage is a vampire named Doc, Axel is feeding her his blood through a transfusion tube. An alarm begins to sounds, he assumes that it's has something to do with the south-west entrance. Doc evily laughs, yelling out ""they're coming"" several times. Axel discovers that it's people down there seeking help and looking for refuge, he informs them that they can't come in. He announces himself as a US Marine that's been ordered to guard the Seattle Valley General Hospital, letting them in would compromise the mission.

From the other side of the door with the civilians, Ted orders Axel to open the door, to which does. Ted, Axel, and several other men fire at the vampires that are outside the door, as Axel is trying to fend off a vampire, Sam takes it out with an aluminum baseball bat from behind, he thanks Sam for saving him once they all make it back inside the hospital, but Sam does not respond, Mohamad explains that Sam is deaf, so there's no use in thanking him.

John looks around the hospital for his wife Wendy, he had assumed that she had made it end but she didn't. He tells Axel that his wife is still out there, defenceless, but Axel can't allow him to leave as it may compromise the mission, he knocks John unconscious with a blow to the head.

As they head up the escalator, Ted sarcastically thanks Axel for changing the code to the door, however, with Ted being gone for six months, he felt it was the right call. Ted says that he never even made it back to the base as he was cut off by the vampire and hunted down.

They walk through a room filled with UV lights as they reach the lab, when they reach the lab, Cynthia leans up against the steel cage, unaware of what's inside, Doc rams the cage, trying to attack Cynthia who is on the outside of it, the group is surprised to learn that they're keeping a vampire as a pet. Mohamad makes a smart remark, while Karen and Cynthia state the obvious, that Doc has been bitten and she's dangerous. Axel informs them all that if anyone touches her they'll be thrown off the roof. When Nicole mentions Vanessa, he tells them that as far as they are concerned, she doesn't exist, pointing a gun at them all to make sure that they have an understanding, as he walks off, Mohamad signs something to Sam, causing him to chuckle.

Nicole begins to wonder how safe they actually are at the hospital, she mentions how he's keeping around both Doc and Vanessa, and how he treated John's wife, Nicole thinks of him as an animal. Karen tells her to keep it down as Axel is an animal with a machine gun, so he's dangerous.

Axel is doing an inventory of the food, John approaches, trying to make peace, he apologizes for his actions earlier. He pleads with Axel to let him out, but he still won't allow it, John picks up a pipe and swings, Axel dodges, then holding him down on the table, explaining that he knows how John is feeling but there's nothing they can do for her.

Back at the exam room, Ted is shocked to learn that Doc is a vampire, Axel informs him that it happened six months ago when he was providing cover for Ted and the others to get out. Doc went down to make sure the door got shut behind them, everything went to hell, as she was trying to help someone get back inside, a vampire took a chunk out her arm, and she turned shortly after that. Ted says that they won't be okay with a vampire around, but Axel has no intention of letting them stay. He then asks Ted how he hooked up with this group of survivors, he found them while hiding from the vampires, going on to say that it's hell out there and a person would do anything just to survive another day.

While Ted and Axel are gone, the survivors decide that it's time to take out Doc and Vanessa for their own safety. Mohamad rushes in front of them, requesting that they don't go through with it, he and John get into a brief exchange of words, John challenges him, approaching closer with a kitchen knife, but Sam comes from behind, pressing his bat against John's face in Mohamad's defence. When Ted and Axel return, everyone pretends as if nothing happens, Sam then approaches Doc's cage, she comes closer to the cage, however, he shows no fear, even mocking her.

Axel is on watch, as he prepares to close the big steel doors, he hears a noise, deciding to further investigate. The vampires have made their way in and they attack, Axel fires at them but there's too many, as the group attempts to get someplace safe, they are attacked, Karen tries to shut the big metal doors but the vamps force their way through. Sam and Mohamad handle themselves pretty well but the same can't be said for some of the others, Karen is bitten at least once by the vampires, with Karen in transition, Cynthia had no other choice but to kill her, she does so with a fire extinguisher.

-flashback over*

Everyone enters the exam room to see Vanessa slicing up a vampire, after taking out the vampire, she looks up, calling out to someone named Dylan, wondering who everyone else is.

After all the vampires have been killed, they are now tasked with getting rid of the bodies, apparently, they dump them down some type of shoot. In the lab, Sam brings Cynthia a drink, she tells him that her parents and brother were in Hawaii when The Rising happened, she was supposed to go as well but she lied, telling her family that she had a mid-term when she was really hooking up with some guy. She apologies for dumping that on him, she was never like that before, now she's just trying to get it together.

Axel and Ted begin wondering how the vampires got in, Axel explains that he gave the codes to Mohamad and Sam, Ted apologizes if the vamps getting in had anything to do with the survivors, he begins to question if they should even be there.

Nicole enters the exam room, asking Vanessa what is she and why she's there, but Vanessa doesn't have any answers as she doesn't remember anything. Nicole thinks that she's lying, she tells Vanessa that she was an animal the prior night and she got bit but nothing happened, she knows that Vanessa is something but she's not sure what. She blames everything that just happened on her but Vanessa insists that she has no idea what is going on, all she knows is that she has a daughter named Dylan. Nicole explains that they've all lost people but Vanessa's story is just too unbelievable, Vanessa tells her to back up as she creeps closer with a weapon in hand. Ted shows up and breaks up the confrontation before it can escalate. Axel enters, handing over some clothes to Vanessa who demands to know where her daughter is, Axel says that her daughter is dead if she's been out there that entire time. When he leaves, Ted explains to her that Axel has been caged up for a while and the world went to hell a couple years ago. Vanessa is shocked to learn that it's been years, he offers to help Vanessa find her Dylan but he must first come up with a plan.

Vanessa is showering, washing off the blood, Axel enters the showers, he tells Vanessa that she doesn't have to worry as he's seen everything she's got. He says its better to double up on showers as they don't have much water, so he joins her, she notices the wounds on his back, she wants to know what happened to her but he doesn't know, explaining his mission was to come and pick up a dead body, then a Volcano goes off in Wyoming, taking out half the western states, that's when the vampires attacked. His orders were to protect her and the doctor, he did his duty, he watched her and kept the doc alive, that's all he knows. Vanessa wonder why her, Axel was hoping she would know, he assumes it has something to do with the Rising, Axel explains that Doc thought there was something special about her, she said that Vanessa should've died already, that she was killed, or that she wasn't or shouldn't be. Vanessa picks up his rifle while he's distracted and leads him out, Ted comes up from behind and takes the gun away, Vanessa declares that she's getting out of the hospital one way or another. He sends Axel to get some pants as he and Vanessa secretly plan to leave.

They gather supplies, Axel catches them with his gun raised at both, insisting that no one leaves. Ted tells him the mission is over, he just wants to help Vanessa find her kid, Axel then reveals that he knows that Ted let the vampires in, informing them that he gave everyone a fake code to the door, but Ted is the only one that knows he keeps the real codes in his notebook. Ted attacks Axel they fight and fire off rounds as Vanessa escapes, Ted gains the upper hand long enough to get away, Sam and Mohamad enter and they all three go looking for Ted and Vanessa.

Vanessa makes it to the roof, she discovers what the world has become, Ted finds her, demanding that she comes along, whether it be dead or alive. He comes at her with a knife, managing to cut her a couple times, Axel, Sam, and Mohamad eventually make their way to the roof, Ted grabs Vanessa, holding a knife to her throat, he says that he needs to hand Vanessa over to them (the vampires), he says that they promised to leave them along if they get Vanessa. She breaks free but Ted stabs her directly in the hand, with the knife still in her hand, she swings it back into Ted's eyes, thus killing him, she pulls the knife out and immediately begins to heal. Mohamad makes a snide remark about her having superpowers.

Axel escorts her back to her room, Vanessa is angry as she still wants to leave to find Dylan but he won't allow.

A voice can be heard yelling throughout the hospital, a man covered in blood crawls out the shoot that the dead bodies were earlier thrown down into. This man looks through the hospital, wondering if anyone else is there, he walks down the hall where he encounters the UV lights, he is shocked to see that they have no effect on him. The group slowly approaches the man pleading for help, they recognize him as one of the vampires from earlier, John realizes that she is responsible for this, the man says that she turned him back into a human, he says as soon as he tasted her blood, he could tell."

Vanessa is an unemployed single mom forced to give blood at a clinic to help make ends meet for her and her young daughter, Dylan.

There are vampires among us even back then, though their numbers are few and they live in hiding. A bloodsucker named Bob breaks into the clinic and steals several blood samples, including Vanessa's. He gives it a taste in the car and immediately starts retching, coughing up the blood and going into spasms ...

When Bob delivers the blood supply to his vampire pack, led by Dmitri and Rebecca, he is suddenly human again. What's up with the blood he drank? Rebecca orders one of her vampire goons, Balthazar, to track down the source.

Meanwhile, Vanessa and Dylan return home to the sounds of their neighbor, Susan, being beaten by her no-good boyfriend, Tommy. Vanessa shows off some impressive fighting skills as she persuades Tommy to leave and never come back, much to Dylan's chagrin. Has Mom displayed a violent temper like this before ... and is she not always in control when it happens?

This is just the beginning of what ends up being a very tense birthday for Dylan, as the cake is smushed and her dad in Denver ends up canceling her weekend trip (he claims it's because of the volcano, but both Vanessa and Dylan think it's so he can spend the weekend with some floozy).

Things quickly turn tragic when Balthazar breaks in, engaging in a brutal throw-down with Vanessa that leaves her horribly bloodied and battered. Balthazar retches and runs from the apartment after tasting Vanessa's blood and Dylan bursts into tears as her mother seemingly dies on the floor in front of her.

Vanessa is taken to the hospital, where Doc (whom we met in Episode 1) is bewildered by the fact that the body isn't cooling, rigor has yet to set in ... and the victim's blood still seems to be, well, alive. Doc contacts Grace, a Naval doctor and Doc's sister, who alludes to similar cases on her end ... and the fact that it's all classified, per the Pentagon itself.

Later, Doc is eating lunch in the hospital cafeteria when she's approached by a military unit led by a no-nonsense Major, who demands to see the Vanessa's body. Just then, the hospital is enveloped in darkness as the volcano at Yellowstone goes ka-boom yet again, resulting in total chaos in the hallways as vampires attack. Two of the Major's soldiers, Axel and Ted (both of whom we met in Episode 1), are assigned to watch over Vanessa and Doc.

Cut to three years later and we're in the world we were introduced to in Episode 1. Vanessa is still deep in Sleeping Beauty mode at the hospital, with Axel, Ted, Doc and two other soldiers, Smith and Gomez, holding down the fort, slowly but surely running out of supplies and going stir crazy.

Meanwhile, it would appear that Dmitri and Rebecca have recruited the services of another doctor to conduct a series of experiments that will allow vampires to walk around in daylight. The results so far are gruesome and horrific, though the key to success may lie with a woman who's been mentioned in hushed whispers. This is, of course, our Vanessa, and Dmitri orders the doctor to find her and bring her to him ... alive.

Back at the hospital, an increasingly despairing Ted has come up with a desperate plan: He, Smith and Gomez will walk the 40 miles to base, bring back supplies and hopefully receive updated orders that absolve them of looking after Sleeping Beauty any longer. The mission is a complete failure within the first 30 seconds as vicious vampires attack them in the street, during which Doc's arm is bitten as she's trying to close the hospital door.

Axel tries to help Doc but it's too late; the infection has already spread. Axel prepares to mercy kill Doc but she begs him to spare her life. Axel relents, strapping her to a gurney and watching in horror as she turns into a vampire, growling and snarling and thrashing under the restraints.

Today, though, is different, as everyone wakes up to the sounds of sirens and the sight of volcanic ash falling from the sky ... and blocking out the sun.

Julius is thrilled to be able to go outside during the daytime and immediately wrecks havoc, biting random people and turning them into vampires. He turns a man named Phil, who goes home and brutally attacks his family.

Three years later, Phil now goes by the name of Flesh ... and he's human again, thanks to drinking Vanessa's blood (as we saw at the end of Episode 1). The survivors at the hospital are more than a little suspicious, but the transformation seems legit ... even though John gets in Flesh's face, asking him how he can live with himself after years of feeding on human blood. ""Who says I can?"" asks Flesh, obviously haunted and overwhelmed with guilt.

Axel confronts Vanessa about her newly revealed superpowers, though she denies there's anything special about her. Their conversation is interrupted by noises outside; upon running to the roof to investigate, they find John's wife, Wendy, tied to a tree on the street below, being brutally whipped with chains. The vampires demand the survivors hand over Vanessa or they'll torture Wendy to death.

John is, of course, ready to throw Vanessa off the roof to save his wife, but Axel suddenly turns the tide by shooting Wendy in the head. John is enraged and attacks Axel, during which the turbine is knocked over and crashes to the street below. ""Great! Now we've got three hours to live!"" exclaims Axel.

Y'see, the turbine powers the car batteries that in turn power the UV lights strung all over the hospital, and when those go out, well, the vampires come in. Axel and Vanessa prepare to retrieve the generator located in the hospital basement as Mohamad and Sam hold down the fort, given strict instructions to not harm either Flesh or Doc.

Axel and Vanessa don't make it very far in the basement before they're attacked by a couple of ferals, forcing them outside. Plan B is to salvage the engine of a nearby boat, which requires Axel to go underwater. Vanessa's left to stand guard with Axel's rifle, and sure enough a few ferals show up and attack. Vanessa clumsily fires at them, simultaneously pulling on the rope that's attached to Axel. Axel comes up from the water holding a piece of the boat's engine and the two of them dispatch with the ferals ... one of which simply dies after tasting Vanessa's blood.

Back at the hospital, Flesh wakes up screaming from a nightmare, which makes everyone uneasy. John proposes they just kill both Flesh and Doc right then and there, but Mohamad and Sam stop him, warning him that he'll end up down the chute if he touches them. Ah, survivor bonding!

And then the lights go out. And, almost immediately after, the vampires storm the front door of the hospital, pounding and clawing, trying to get in. Vanessa and Axel watch from across the street as Flesh opens the front door and confronts the vampires head-on, showing them that he's human again thanks to ""the dead girl."" He preaches the Gospel of Vanessa, which makes the vampires uneasy. They retreat, allowing Vanessa and Axel safe passage back to the hospital. Vanessa takes the time to remove Wendy's body from the tree and take it with them so John can pay his respects.

As Axel gets to work on the generator, Vanessa confronts Flesh, who's sewing up his wounds, asking him why he put himself at risk like that ... and why he would stick his neck out for a bunch of survivors who want him - and her - dead. Oh, and she definitely doesn't need him preaching about her being some sort of savior or destroyer, either. Flesh reveals that when he was turned, he killed his five-year-old daughter and tore the heart out of his infant child ... though he spared his wife's life, leaving her surrounded by pieces of her children. Vanessa says he deserve to die for this, and Flesh agrees ... though he'll die on his own terms.

Just then, the lights turn back on. Yay, Axel!

Meanwhile, the group of vampires whom Flesh scared off, led by Gustov, return to Julius' compound, a sort of Mad Maxian orgy of blood, appetite and industry. Gustov tells Julius that Flesh is now human again because of Vanessa, after which Julius orders to send word to Dmitri.

Back at the hospital, Axel asks Vanessa to cure Doc. Vanessa gets in the cage, but Doc has no interest in biting her; in fact, she seems afraid of her. Vanessa ends up biting Doc on the neck, after which Doc collapses, seemingly dead. Axel is heartbroken until Doc suddenly starts coughing. She stands up, seemingly human again.

Watching this erotic and grotesque display from the vents is Sheema, a member of the Portland Human Resistance (and, as we'll later discover, Mohamad's sister).

Sheema returns to the secret headquarters of the Resistance, where Campbell is trying to rile up his followers to take action against the vampires. In fact, they should strike First National Bank, where all the weapons and blades have been stashed! Everyone thinks it's a crazy plan, as it's too well-guarded ... except for Sheema, who might know another way into the building ...

Back at the hospital, Doc is slowly but surely re-adjusting to life as a human again. Flesh is still having a hard time of it, and his latest nightmare turns into real terror when he wakes up to the sight of young Cynthia hanging by her neck. Upon examining the body, Doc discovers that she was strangled, then hung ... and one of her fingers has been cut (or chewed) off, taken perhaps as a trophy.

So Cynthia was murdered. Who did it?

Vanessa's not going to wait to find out, as she's set a fire to set off the fire alarm, the perfect diversion to allow her to get out of there and start looking for her daughter, Dylan. Mohamad meets her at the door and convinces her to let him go with her so he can look for his sister, after which he provides the proper code to open the locking mechanism. After putting out the fire, Axel realizes he's been hornswoggled and runs to the door, though Vanessa and Mohamad are long gone.

Axel's ready to go after Vanessa, but Doc convinces him that priority is to find out who killed Cynthia. Axel first tries to get a reading on Sam, to whom he gives a goodbye note left by Mohamad. Sam, in the first words we've heard him speak, admits that he's scared. Axel admits that he is, too.

In the cafeteria, Axel breaks the news to everyone that Cynthia was murdered, after which everyone starts accusing everyone else, with the non-present Mohamad ultimately emerging as the number-one suspect. This doesn't sit well with Sam and he gets in John's face, which is rather terrifying.

Later, the survivors gather at the chute to say goodbye to Cynthia, with a heartbroken Nicole saying a prayer before releasing the body into the void. Afterwards, Flesh meets up with Sam for dishes duty, during which Flesh describes what it's like to become a vampire. It doesn't sound too bad, especially the part involving senses being heightened and old injuries being cured. Sam, who can neither hear nor speak (very well, anyway), is intrigued.

Meanwhile, Vanessa and Mohamad make it to Vanessa's old apartment, where all they find is traces of Vanessa's epic fight with Balthazar ... and a couple of canned peaches in the cabinet. After Vanessa has a good cry over Dylan in her bedroom, she joins Mohamad at the dinner table for the tasty treat. As they prepare to leave, Vanessa unpacks her old 12-gauge (a gift from her Second Amendment-loving ex-husband) ... and notices bloody footprints on the ground, leading to the front door. Dylan got out!

En route to the police station to see if they can find any further Dylan-related clues, Vanessa and Axel come across a group of humans, led by a man named Brendan, being terrorized by ferals. Vanessa makes short work of them and succumbs to her maternal instincts when she sees that one of the survivors is a little girl named Callie. Vanessa assures them that she'll take them all to the hospital and safety ... a plan that doesn't exactly thrill Mohamad.

Word of Vanessa's impromptu rescue mission has traveled fast as Gustov scurries to Julius' compound to let him know that 'the woman' is near. Julius gives the order to capture her so she can be taken to Dmitri, though Julius' mama, a vampire herself, tells him to keep Vanessa for himself and use her to reclaim his rightful place in the vampire hierarchy. Julius ponders this as he feasts on bloody human organs.

Meanwhile, Vanessa and Mohamad are preparing to take the survivors to the hospital when they hear vampires signaling each other, planning an attack. Vanessa tells Mohamad to get the humans to safety while she stays behind to face the bloodsuckers herself. Mohamad succeeds, and Axel is none too thrilled to be having all these extra mouths to feed.

So who is ths killer? Brendan immediately takes action, locking Axel and the gang in Doc's old cage. Brendan commiserates with his group and they decide that the only way to protect themselves from the killer is to exile every single suspect. Mohamad takes one for the team and confesses to the killings, even though everyone - including Brendan - knows it's a bunch of B.S. Still, Brendan has to thin the herd if his group is going to survive, and tossing Mohamad to the outside world makes for an effective first step.

Meanwhile, Mohamad's sister Sheema has managed to infiltrate Rebecca's lair, where she steals a set of blueprints. Unfortunately, Rebecca catches her before she can make her getaway, though Sheema is shocked when the lady vampire actually lets her go. Hmm ... what's Rebecca's game?

No matter, for now. Sheema takes the blueprints to the Portland Resistance, where it's revealed that the First National Bank that contains a stockade of weapons can be infiltrated via an underground tunnel system. As Sheema is quite the tunnel rat, she's the perfect gal for the job!

Meanwhile, Vanessa's been taken to Julius' lair, where she's reunited with an old friend: her neighbor, Susan. Susan's now a vampire, and a pretty mean one, at that; as she fights Vanessa in front of Julius' bloodthirsty pack, she claims she killed Dylan and drank her dry. Furious, Vanessa bites Susan on the neck, which turns her back into a human. So, the rumors of this woman's powers are true!

The vampires are a bit freaked out, and Vanessa takes advantage of their fear and hesitation to turn tail and take off with Susan. Julius orders his minions to give pursuit, though they're reluctant to follow their prey into the sewer.

Hmm ... what's in the sewer? Something not nice to either human or vampire, as one of the Julius' bloodsuckers gets snatched into the darkness by an unseen force. Yikes!

Vanessa and Susan take a breather, which allows Susan to tell her what really happened to Dylan. After Vanessa, uh, died, Dylan came to Susan's apartment, where Susan called both 911 and Dylan's dad. The police took Dylan away, but Susan was turned before she could find out what happened after that.

The creature leaps from the darkness, attacking and wounding Vanessa, though she eventually wastes the thing because she's, you know, Vanessa.

Something's wrong, though. Vanessa collapses, seemingly from her wounds. Isn't she supposed to, like, heal immediately?

Elsewhere, Campbell, Quaid and a few members of the Resistance have infiltrated the abandoned bank where a supply of weapons are supposedly being held. It ends up being a trap as they're attacked by vampires, after which Campbell accuses Sheema of being a traitor, as she should've warned them that Rebecca willingly gave her the blueprints to the bank. Just then, Rebecca attacks, demanding the location of someone named 'Taka.' She kills Campbell and tells Sheema that she will now lead her to the others.

Hmm ... who's this Taka fella?

Meanwhile, tensions continue to run high at the hospital. Our heroes are still locked in a cage, and Axel inspires the wrath of young Catherine when little Callie is almost killed by a booby trap. Brendan takes Axel into the hallway and demands to know the locations of all the booby traps, but Axel refuses, prompting Brendan to counter with his fists.

And that's not all. After Axel is returned to the cage, Sam works his lip-reading magic and discovers that Brendan is planning on executing every last one of them.

Luckily, Vanessa and Susan manage to get back to the hospital, and Brendan lets Doc out of the cage so she can attend to Vanessa's wound. Doc fills Vanessa in on the gang's imprisonment and Mohamad's banishment, which prompts Vanessa to chew out Brendan, though he insists it's necessary since someone amongst them is indeed a murderer (he's right ... we still don't know who really killed poor Cynthia). Vanessa claims she'll be Switzerland in this whole mess but secretly starts scheming an escape plan with Doc.

Back in the cage, Flesh has been making some progress on opening the ceiling grating (crawling through vents is fun!) and Doc gives Axel a message from Vanessa: Get out of the cell, take out the generator and strike at their captors in the dark. Anticipating the bloodbath to come, Vanessa tells little Callie to go hide and don't come out until she finds her.

The plan goes swimmingly and Axel brutally massacres most of Brendan's people with both rifle and axe. Axel frees his comrades, who are a bit disturbed by such a slaughter, but Axel insists it was justified since they were planning on executing them. The decision is made to banish Brendan, Catherine and the other two survivors who managed to dodge Axel's shoot-'em/chop-'em-up.

Callie comes out of her hiding place and begs Vanessa to let her friends stay. Vanessa reluctantly refuses, and Callie makes the choice to join her friends out in the badlands, much to Vanessa's heartbreak.

The episode ends with Doc tending to Vanessa, who is rapidly descending into bitterness and despair. Unbeknownst to Vanessa, Doc later cuts her own finger and ravenously sucks on her own blood.

It also ends up being the perfect place to lay low, as it's located in an underground bunker chock full of food and supplies ... and even beer!

The gang's running low on ammo, but luckily a handsome dude named Theo comes to the rescue with his sword and bow and arrow. What's even better is he tells them of a place called Eden, where they'll find food, medicine and sanctuary. Follow the hunk, weary travelers!

Eden is an old 'psychotherapy sanitarium' turned dubious utopia, run by an immediately suspicious guy named Micah. His second-in-command, Beth, doesn't want any strangers here, but Micah assures them they're welcome ... and promptly has Emma (remember her? Mohamad was making out with her in the woods last week) take them into one of the houses upon the now-familiar sound of church bells. Apparently this signals the arrival of a vampire named Magdalena, with whom the Eden folk have a deal: provide her with jars of blood every now and then and she'll let them live in peace.

So where does Micah get this blood? Well, the thing is ... well, wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves. First, Sam notices Mohamad's Nirvana shirt hanging with the laundry, which prompts him to follow a dude whom he thinks might be his missing friend. The guy isn't Mohamad but an Edenite named Xavier, who ends up locking Sam in a storage room in the basement, exclaiming ""Curiosity killed the cat!"" as he scurries off. Geez. Anyway, Sam finds a bunch of paintings in the room, including portraits of Micah, Beth ... and what looks like Magdalena. Huh.

Meanwhile, Flesh has been moping about and turns to Micah for spiritual guidance. Micah teaches him how to face his past to find strength to fight the future (or some such sort of New Age mumbo-jumbo). It seems to work on Flesh, who for the first time seems to be in a good mood as he walks amongst the citizens of Eden with warmth and cheer.

Doc's not feeling it, though, as she's haunted by locking Axel in with Gorrman, basically abandoning him to die; when she confesses this to Vanessa, she doesn't let her off easy. In fact, Vanessa tells Doc that she's no longer welcome with the group after they leave Eden.

That's just one of many highlights of Vanessa's stay at Eden. She also learns how to handle a kitana, thanks to her hunky new pal, Theo; they also totally make out in the woods after he shows her the grave he made for his parents (awwww!). Vanessa also assists Doc and Beth as they help a woman named Peggy give birth to a healthy baby girl (double awww!).

A baby ... huh ... wait a minute. There are a bunch of pregnant women in Eden, but where are all the kids?

Micah spews some B.S. about how they deliver the babies to the Resistance in Seattle, but we know that's a crock - he gives them to Magdalena! Vanessa and Theo stop Beth from handing over the latest bundle of joy to the scary vampire lady, which only stokes her vampire rage. What's even more disturbing is that Magdalena was Micah's wife during her human days ... oh, unholy pact of darkness!

Wait, there's even more trouble in Eden. Sam escapes from the storage room and is reunited with Mohamad, though their affectionate embrace is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Xavier, the guy who locked up Sam. What's even more sudden is that Sam pulls a blade and PLUNGES IT INTO XAVIER'S CHEST. When a stunned Mohamad asks his friend what he's done, Sam only responds with a finger to his lips: ""Shh.""

Oh, man ... has Sam been the killer all along?

Sam and Mohamad make a run for it but are soon captured by Eden goons and brought to Micah, along with Doc and Susan. Micah's ready to have them all executed for Sam's crime, though Vanessa and Theo show up and call him out for giving babies to Magdalena. Micah shows his true colors as a tyrant, and Flesh ends his reign with a blade through the back of his neck.

Well, that was a nice visit and all, but it's time to hit the road! Actually, the gang will be leaving without Flesh, as he hopes to rebuild the Eden community without any corruption and unholy blood pacts. Vanessa, Susan, Mohamad and Sam prepare for the journey ahead, but wait a minute ... where's Doc?

It's Magdalena who finds her, and Doc begs her to turn her back into a vampire, as she believes she was never meant to be human again.

She could care less about where her estranged father might be, but he soon reveals himself as a feral that attacks Strider, a horse that up until then had managed to survive the vampire apocalypse. The gang chains up dear old Dad in the barn, where Susan puts him out of his misery with a shotgun blast to the head. ""Closure!"" she exclaims, trembling with rage over the memories of the abuse her father wrought upon her and her mother over the years.

Susan's just about had it with all this apocalypse stuff and retreats to the woods for a good cry. Sam, who's looking even more intimidating after shaving his head and beard, appears and attempts to comfort her ... and then proceeds to strangle her to death. The severing of one of Susan's fingers confirms once and for all that Sam is indeed the mystery killer.

A suspicious Mohamad finds Sam's collection of severed fingers in his pack, after which Sam confesses to the murder of Susan. Vanessa is furious, angrily asking Sam why he did it.

Sam begins frantically signing with the heartbroken Mohamad, which prompts him to attack his former friend in anger. Vanessa opts to leave Sam to die a slow death in the woods, slicing the back of his knees with Mohamad's machete to keep him from getting too far from any hungry vampires that might show up.

Taka has set a bomb to take out the electricity surrounding The Citadel with the help of a mysterious mole inside the fortress, but it seems he needs one more item before setting his plan in motion. ""Where is Vanessa?"" he asks Flesh.

Back at the vampire camp, Julius is summoned by Dmitri and he heads off to The Citadel, leaving his Mama to run things. Scab brings her Sam, who's now blind and near-feral from his flare gun wounds and lack of blood. Mama at first wants him killed but becomes intrigued when Scab tells her that he saw Sam as a human at the hospital ... with Vanessa. Mama feeds Sam human blood, which cures his blindness and makes him coherent again. ""Tell me about the woman,"" she demands.

Sheesh ... everyone wants Vanessa! And no one more than Dmitri, it seems. He's disappointed in Julius for catching Vanessa but failing to keep her, which gets Julius all indignant. He takes a shot at Dmitri but Dmitri throws him across the room, reminding him who's boss. Dmitri then mentions The Elders, a vampire faction that Julius thought no longer existed. Dmitri tells Julius to restore his faith in him ... and he will show him the truth!

Vampire politics. So heated! Not as heated as Julius himself, though, when he returns to camp and finds his sweet Mama murdered, presumably by Sam, who's nowhere to be found. Vampire rage!

Meanwhile, Vanessa and Mohamad attack a couple of members of the Red Brigade, humans who have sworn allegiance to the vampire cause. They steal their uniforms and vehicle, gaining access to the nightmarish camp. They split up, with Mohamad looking for Sheema and Vanessa going to the area where they supposedly keep the kids.

Vanessa traverses a dimly-lit industrial nightmare of blood, severed body parts and people wrapped in cocoon-like hammocks ... human blood bags! She battles a big ol' vampire butcher, who pulls her puny kitana out of his stomach like it's nothing. He knocks her out and drags her into his lair to be, well, butchered, but luckily she comes to and electrocutes his sorry ass. Whew!

Vanessa enters a room full of bunk beds, where she comes across an elderly human woman. When Vanessa inquires about Dylan, the woman tells her that they don't keep children in the camp ... only the old and the sick! This is a blood farm!

Crap ... did Mohamad set Vanessa up? It would appear so, as an alarm goes off when Vanessa backtracks to the truck. She sees Mohamad suddenly hit with a spotlight ... followed by Dmitri and his minions emerging from the shadows, surrounding Vanessa. Dmitri compliments Mohamad on his well-played treachery, with a distraught Mohamad telling an enraged Vanessa that he had no choice. Vanessa charges Dmitri, who easily catches her in mid-air by the throat. ""You look just like your mother!"" he exclaims.

Whoa."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5212530/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,Somebody from the past who was a guardian of Jenna will make an appearance.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Amanda Tapping'],"['', '', '']",[],"['title directed by female', 'tied up while barefoot', 'tied feet']",[],"Vanessa's in a tight spot. She's now the prisoner of Dmitri, who's got big plans for her. They're gonna poke and prod her till the cows come home, experimenting with her blood and eggs so vampires can walk around in daylight and procreate and all kinds of nightmarish stuff.

But Dmitri's not all about the promises of pain and humiliation and exploitation. He's also got info on Vanessa's true identity: she's a Van Helsing, descendent of Abraham Van Helsing, the fearless vampire killer (from, you know, Dracula).

As Vanessa grapples with this bizarre identity crisis, Dr. Sholomenko commences with preparations for all these gruesome experiments. He also subtly loosens one of her bonds, telling her to be patient and wait for her chance. He then ...

Wait a minute, back up. Is the doc helping Vanessa escape? Is he not such a jerk after all?

Nah, it's all a set-up. Vanessa breaks free and wastes a couple of vampire guards, but Dmitri is waiting for her in the hallway. He wanted to give Vanessa a taste of sweet freedom ... and then take it away. It's all part of the plan to break her spirit.

Sigh.

Meanwhile, Mohamad has been rewarded for handing Vanessa over to Dmitri by being reunited with his sister Sheema. Mohamad is haunted by his betrayal ... and disturbed to discover that Sheema likes being Rebecca's pet. She gets to live in comfort and safety ... why would she want to return to the outside world?

Elsewhere, tensions are running high as Dmitri, Rebecca and Antanasia sit around the dinner table, sipping on blood soup. Antanasia seems to be in Dmitri's favor, though Rebecca hides her jealousy with coyness when Dmitri asks if there's any news on the Resistance. Antanasia is amused, saying she loves watching the two of them lie to each other. Hot drama!

Meanwhile, Vanessa is chained up and refusing to drink the blood that's been offered to her as sustenance. Mohamad visits her, expressing his distress about Sheema having sold her soul ... and him, therefore, selling his for nothing. Vanessa tells him to get lost, but before he goes, he gives her a switchblade in the hopes that she might be able to use it to escape.

It seems that Vanessa's got another way out in mind as she stabs herself in the torso. She hangs from her chains, bleeding profusely, waiting for death ...

Except Vanessa can't die, at least not that way, as she's got those Wolverine healing powers and all. As she recovers on a gurney, Dmitri tells her about her heritage, generations of vampire hunters from throughout the centuries. Vanessa's mother was quite the warrior, apparently, but when she learned the 'truth' about Vanessa's father, she tried to stop the birth. After Vanessa was born, her mother hid her away.

Hmm ... what was the 'truth' about Vanessa's father? Our guess is that he was a vampire ... but who was he, exactly?

Vanessa later starts embracing her vampire side as she finally gives into the tempting bowl of blood left for her in her cell. She drinks from it ravenously, and the blood has a powerful effect on her ... so powerful that she's able to crush her bedpost with the slightest grip.

Elsewhere, Taka has once again infiltrated The Citadel, and he's greeted by his mysterious hooded mole: Rebecca! It would appear that she's in cahoots with the Resistance and insists that The Citadel must be attacked tomorrow - an act that we're assuming would de-throne Dmitri and put Rebecca in power. In return for his services, Taka and his followers will get their very own island that's off-limits to vampires.

Taka, the poor fool, believes her, and tells the Resistance the time is nigh. When they take The Citadel, the plan is to kill anything and anyone inside ... including Vanessa, who's now a liability. This doesn't sit well with Flesh, who plans on rescuing his friend. He's just going to have to get to her before anyone else ...

Back at The Citadel, Mohamad is packing Sheema's bag, hoping to convince her to leave with him. Sheema's not going anywhere, though; in fact, she's going to help the vampires defend The Citadel against the Resistance! To punctuate her point, she hits her brother on the head with a candle holder, knocking him out cold. (Sorry, Mohamad - we love you, but you kind of had that coming.)

Elsewhere, a rather healthy-looking Vanessa is being prepared to receive Dmitri's seed and, in theory, give birth to a vampire baby that actually survives. Rebecca's not having any of it, claiming Vanessa's just going to be bring about the end of all vampires, for which she gets a slap across the face from Dmitri. Vanessa counters by suddenly attacking Dmitri, embracing her legacy as a fearless vampire killer and pulling out a good chunk of his stomach. Yes!

Dmitri stumbles out of the room, bellowing in pain as Vanessa and Rebecca face off. Time for girlfighting!

Just then, Taka's bomb goes boom and the Resistance storms the castle. Rebecca flees with Vanessa in hot pursuit as Taka finds the wounded Dmitri. He's about to put him out of his misery when Dmitri asks him what Rebecca has promised him. Dmitri laughs when Taka mentions Fox Island, which apparently doesn't exist. Never trust Rebecca! Dmitri tells Taka he can offer him more, much more ... which is enough for Taka to shoot Brendan when he walks in, insisting that he kill Dmitri.

Oh, Taka. Sold your soul like a jackass.

The first season of Van Helsing comes to an end with not one but two doozies. First, Vanessa catches up to Rebecca, and Rebecca reveals her ace card: Vanessa's daughter, Dylan! ""Hello, mother,"" says the vampire girl. Argh!!

Second, we scoot back to The Farm, where a lone figure emerges from the pipeline and into daylight. Yep, it's Axel ... who's now a vampire, too. Argh!!"

Debbie Cunningham (Jacklyn Bernstein) is a 4-year-old girl trapped in a very dysfunctional household. The only child of her parents, Sheila and Martin, Debbie is alone and nearly neglected-- her parents are too busy constantly bickering with one another, and everyone around them, to give her the love and attention she needs.

Debbie is near timid one morning as she shows her parents an invitation she's received to attend a Children's Zoo. The invitation proudly proclaims this zoo as one of the finest zoos that can be found, made especially for young children. Martin and Sheila decide to take Debbie there, although they show they are reluctant to do so and are taking her, mainly because they feel it will get her out of their hair for a little while.

Debbie and her parents are met at the entrance by the zookeeper, a friendly young woman named Melody (Sydney Walsh). As Debbie presents her invitation, Melody kindly asks Martin and Sheila to go through a set of doors on the side to the waiting area for parents. She says that the full experience of The Children's Zoo is best gained by letting the children explore it on their own. Melody then gently guides Debbie to the children's entrance into the zoo proper.

As Debbie walks down a hallway, Melody's voice comes through speakers, telling her to press the large button beside each enclosure to hear the parents speak. A release lever near the button will open that one enclosure.

As Debbie arrives at the first enclosure, we see that this is no ordinary zoo. Each enclosure is a living quarters-- and prison-- for a set of parents. The first few sets are as loud and boorish as Morton and Sheila. Their reactions on seeing Debbie are that of people forced to wait hours for car repairs. All the parents are desperate to get out, though their tones show they are more ordering Debbie to release them, than asking. Debbie listens to each set for a minute or so, and then walks on.

She passes by a few couples who are asleep, despondent, depressed, barely responsive to her. One middle-aged couple tries to bribe her with all sorts of sweet-tasting treats they know how to make.

Debbie reaches an enclosure where a man sits near the window, while his wife lies on the bed nearby. Noticing Debbie, the man calls his wife over, and they approach her with an air of timidity approaching Debbie's own. They note that she's one of the youngest children to visit the zoo in a while. Their son was seven when he brought them there, and it seems like a long time ago. The husband passionately says that he and his wife have learned their lesson. They're making do in their cell as best they can until the right child comes along, and when that child finds them, they will be the best parents they can be. Debbie's face seems to light up a bit as the man and woman slowly smile and put an arm around each other's shoulders.

Debbie arrives back at the foyer of the zoo with her new parents. Melody congratulates her on having made an excellent choice, cheerfully wishing the new family well as they begin life again. As Debbie and her new parents exit the zoo, Martin and Sheila are seen inside an enclosure, yelling and sniping after Debbie, Melody, and everything else around them."

The episode opens on a run down inner city school; students mill around, the grass is covered in litter, the pathways and steps are flanked with overgrown weeds.

Miss Peters (Adrienne Barbeau) an English teacher walks up the entrance steps and past a Security Guard (Al Christy) on her way into the main building.

The scene cuts to a gang, The Furies, as they walk up an alternative pathway, one of the gang, Trojan (Arthur) (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.), boasting to the rest of something he has done.

The scene cuts to a gargoyle on the roof whose eyes glow red.

Trojan continues to boast of his prowess and bravery. One of the Furies, Wizard (Theodore) (Adam Postil), points to a rival gang and comments that Danny has had it too good for too long before making his way over to start a fight. We see Wizard remove his belt and buckle, wrapping the tongue end around his hand, as the rival gang member removes a cut throat razor from his pocket. They start to circle one another as a crowd of students surround them.

Ms Peters hears the noise of the crowd and rushes out of the main building to stand alongside her colleague Hugh Costin (Fred Morsell) who then leaves in search of some help to break the fight up. The fight continues until finally Ms Peters steps in to break it up, on seeing that Wizard has got the upper hand and is about to slash his counterpart with the razor. Throwing herself at Wizard she is able to separate them. Looking skyward Ms Peters catches sight of the Gargoyle, their eyes meet and a red hue seems to permeate Ms Peters eyes and facial skin. The eye contact is finally broken when Mr Costins helps her to her feet while the Security Guard breaks up the surrounding the crowd.

Mr Costins tells Ms Peters that she shouldn't have bothered, that they (the students) are nothing more than a pack of animals. Ms Peters replies that they are just children however Mr Costins says yes, but with sharp toys, referring to the razor, and that the school has more gang fights than graduations. Ms Peters shows signs or distress but tells Mr Constin that she just has a headache and it is nothing.

The scene cuts to the gargoyle on the roof, its eyes no longer glowing red.

That night Ms Peters tosses and turns in bed, the scene interspersed with flashes of lightning and views of the gargoyles teeth and claws. Her hands and nails scratching long strips in the material of her sheets as she finally sits up in bed with an evil angry look on her face. The angry look quickly dissipates and changes to fear as she looks at the damage to her bedding.

At school the following day Wizard and Trojan enter the class late, interrupting Ms Peters lesson. The reasons they give for being late show her no respect, with Trojan looking at a non existent watch on his wrist. She tells them both to take their seats then continues with the lesson. Trojan interrupts with a stupid comment and Ms Peters tries to explain to the class the importance of having an education if they want a job or to speak to someone outside of their own community. Trojan continues to be disrespectful or Ms Peters, making personal remarks about her legs. Ms Peters walks toward Trojan with a look of anger showing on her face. She grabs Trojan from his seat and forces him against the class wall before raising him aloft with one hand while making threats. Wizard stands and tells her to knock it off so she turns, throws Trojan into his seat and then asks what Wizard has on his tiny little mind. Wizards face shows disbelief and a small amount of fear, he is unable to reply. The school bell rings and all the students depart the classroom. Ms Peters leans back against the wall suddenly looking deflated and exhausted, shaking her hand in pain she stands and appears to analyse her actions obviously not knowing why she reacted as she did.

Out in the hallway a student (Brian Robbins) kicks and bangs his locker as Ms Peters and another teacher (Sarah Partridge) walk by having a conversation. The other teacher turns to look at Ms Peters only to find that she now has the noisy student forced face first against the locker and with an arm twisted behind his back. Ms Peters then impresses on the boy that the school is older than his grandmother and therefore deserves the same respect he would give his grandmother. She then forces the boy to use the combination to open his locker, rather than the violence he was previously using.

That night Ms Peters soaks a bruised hand in cold water, her dog growling in her direction she then looks and asks the dog what has gotten into him? She then says Whats the matter with me?

The next day in school Ms Peters recites poetry to the class, all of whom appear bored and on the edge of sleep. Suddenly music blares from a Boom Box on the floor beside Wizards desk. Wizard grins and does nothing when asked to turn the music off. Ms Peters walks tiredly to Wizards desk and turns the music off herself. The students react by asking her to leave it on and not to mess with other peoples stuff. Walking back to the front of the classroom Wizard is seen turning the music on again behind her back. Ms Peters halts and the look of anger appears once again on her face, she retraces her steps back to Wizards desk and picks up the Boom Box before crushing it with her bare hands. As she once again returns to her desk Wizard stands and attempts to attack her from the rear, she side steps his rush and pushes him face down on her desk before forcing his arm up and behind his back. She then forces him out the office and tells him to stay out. She turns back to the room and signs of weakness and exhaustion can once again be seen. The rest of the class look on silently as she returns to the English poetry lesson as though nothing untoward had occurred. On being given the page number all of the students quickly flip through their books in a hurried fearful way.

Ms Peters enter the ladies room. Students already present in the facilities rush to extinguish cigarettes and leave, when they see her. Alone she turns on the tap, massages her neck and then looks in the mirror. She reaches out to touch her reflection when suddenly a greyish hand suddenly grasps for her from beyond the reflection. Afraid, she turns and runs from the washroom.

Outside Trojan and another gang member (Richard Brainard) vent about what they would like to do to her, Ms Peters, for embarrassing them. Wizard calls them on their threats implying that they are all mouth and wouldn't follow through on their threats. Wizard walks off baseball bat in hand, ignoring pleas from Jennifer (Noelle Harling) to stop.

Ms Peters sits at her desk marking papers she glances to the wall clock, 17:43, tiredness and exhaustion show as she bows her head to her desk. Wizard is seen running up the steps and squeezing through the gap in the chained main entrance door.

The scene cuts to the gargoyle located atop the building, its eyes once again glowing red.

Ms Peters still seated at her desk sits up straight, once again under control of the Gargoyle and utters the word soon. She stands, leaves the office and makes her way down a corridor. Wizards sees and begins to follow her. She tears the handle and lock off a door and enters the room. Wizard follows behind and enters into what appears to be an old storage and file room. Wizard looks moves slowly through the room scanning the area for any sign of Ms Peters with no success. He starts to smash the bat into the surrounding shelves while shouting for her to Come out here! he moves to various parts of the room as he hears small noises, finally removing a box but to no avail. Suddenly a grey rough hand, reminiscent of the Gargoyle's paw, grasps his shoulder and on turning he is confronted by Ms Peters whose visage has changed to grey eyes, fanglike teeth and a roughened stone complexion.

Backing away Wizard raises the bat which Ms Peters with one slash of her claw-like hands breaks in two. She then lifts and throws him to the back of the room and then jumps to attack him. Scrambling over the upturned shelves and boxes he sees Ms Peters perched in a similar way to that of the Gargoyle. No matter which way he flees Ms Peters is always there ahead of him, crouched and waiting, her body becoming less and less humanlike as the chase continues. Finally Ms Peters jumps down and pins Wizard to the floor, extending her arm in readiness for a final and fatal slash of her claws she suddenly catches sight of herself in a mirror and pauses. She gets up off Wizard and backs away making loud unintelligible screaming noises until she finally reverses into an electrical box that was damaged earlier. Wizard looks on as the electrical current flows through her and the Gargoyle on the roof is seen to explode into small pieces.

Finally Ms Peters lying face down on the floor is slowly approached by Wizard. Gently he turns her over and raises her head telling her to wake up. Ms Peters opens her eyes, now looking entirely human again. Wizard asks Why didn't you kill me? to which she replies I couldn't.....I couldn't let that happen. Wizard thanks her, a sincere thank you which she accepts. Reconciled, Wizard helps her to her feet and they leave the room together.

Narration at End: We are told that damned places exist. Buildings where madness permeates the very bricks and mortar. We're told that sometimes dedication and kindness can purge the evil from those walls. This has merely been a story. Life isn't really like this, is it? A lesson to be learned in the study halls, of the Twilight Zone.





Paladin of the Lost Hour

The scene opens with an elderly man, Gaspar (Danny Kaye) sitting alone, head bowed down in a graveyard. 2 punks look at him through the railings. Punk #1 (John Bryant) turns to Punk #2 (Corkey Ford) and suggests that they rob him for his valuables, Punk #2 wonders aloud if the old man will have anything worth stealing, Punk #1 says he sure hopes so. The Punks make their way into the graveyard via an open gate. The old man is seen talking to a grave with the name Minny on it. He speaks quietly of missing her and that the pain does not ease with time. Suddenly the 2 Punks grab him, push him to the ground where they proceed to beat him up. The old man shouts Help me! Protect me! You must protect me! which is seen to be overheard by Billy Kinetta (Glynn Turman) who is visiting another grave. Punk #1 searches through the old mans pockets and brings out an old pocket watch which he looks at while walking away from the assault. The watch suddenly burns his hand and then floats magically into the air. Billy attacks Punk #1 and defends himself from the knife wielding Punk #2. During the struggle the watch is seen to float through the air, into the hand of the elderly gentleman which he then holds close to his chest.

The Punks run off and Billy turns to help the elderly Gaspar to his feet, who thanks Billy for his help, as he picks up and returns Gaspars belongings. Gaspar assures Billy that he is fine.

Gaspar suggest they go somewhere and have a nice cup of Earl Grey but Billy turns him down as he has a few thing to take care of at the graveside. Gaspar tries to convince him, expressing his liking of Billy due to his use of the word Dad instead of the word Pop which he detests. He then hitches his arm through Billys and starts to lead him out of the Graveyard. Stopping at the railings they finally introduce themselves and Gaspar uses the meaning of his name to suggest that they both now have something to talk about.

The men go back to Billys apartment and while Billy is making the tea Gaspar has a quick look around at the small compact space. He opens the conversation with a reminiscence of the books that he and Minny had and how they couldnt bear to throw one out even if it was a stinker. He goes on to tell Billy that all the people who visited over the years asked the same dumb question Have you read all those books?, as though it was some kind of weird perversion, and that he finally came up with an answer that suited of course not, who wants a library of books that you have already read.

Billy asks if Gaspar is retired to which Gaspar vehemently says he is not. He is still active doing all sorts of things, he is a consumer advocate. The conversation turns to Gaspars visit to the cemetery and Gaspar confides that he visits his wifes grave, that she has been gone 20 years and that he still misses her, that he visits the grave every other day.

They sit and drink their tea and Gaspar ask Billy who he visits, Billy says it is just a friend and then says that he has to get ready to leave for work, as he is the night manager of a convenience store. Gaspar asks Billy a favour, to rest at the apartment for a while, to which Billy agrees and informs him, Gaspar, he wont be back until 2 am, but on leaving the door will lock automatically. Finally Billy comments that it was nice getting to know him, which Gaspar considers a mutual pleasure.

Billy returns to his apartment and is pleased and surprised to find that Gaspar is still there, and has prepared a meal of stew for the two of them. As Billy smells appreciatively at the meal Gaspar encourages him to eat, but leave room for dessert.

After the meal Billy asks Gaspar if he is homeless and then offers to let him stay with him for a while. Gaspar accepts the offer, although he tells Billy it won't be long as his Doctor has informed him that he isn't long for this world. He confesses that he is a little afraid to go but having someone to talk to would be a great comfort.

Billy later admits that he was visiting the grave of a man who was in his rifle company in Vietnam, but does not elaborate and Gaspar does not press for details.

Gaspar suggests that they watch a little TV, perhaps the news. A small black and white tv is placed on the table. They both listen as news items involving missile crises etc. are read out by the News Anchor, Gaspar watching Billys reaction closely. Finally Billy turns the TV off wishing to hear no more about war and violence. Billy admits to Gaspar that he is also afraid of death. Gaspar reassures Billy that it will never happen, that there will be no nuclear holocaust, to trust him when he tells him that it will never happen. Billy wonders if Gaspar has some inside information. Gaspar removes the old pocket watch from his pocket and extends his hand and the watch out to Billy and tells him that it will never happen as it is only 11 oclock. Billy tells Gaspar he has news for him, that the watch has stopped and that it is actually 4 oclock, but Gaspar reiterates that it is only 11 oclock.

The next day walking along the street Gaspar says he will treat Billy to a movie, as long as it doesnt have Karen Black, Sandy Dennis or Meryl Streep as they are always crying and their noses are always red.

A big flash car stops in front of them, the driver throws the end butt of his lit cigar out the window. Gaspar sees the cigar butt, goes over picks it up and tells the man he thinks he may have dropped it. He then flicks the cigar into rear leather seating of the car and walks away. The driver, in panic, tries to turn and retrieve the cigar before it does any damage. Billy leads Gaspar away from the vehicle commenting that he must be nuts. The conversation on Gaspars sanity continues as they walk along the street. Gaspar explaining that the man was guilty of causing trash and that others were guilty of many more other crimes like littering, pollution and waste dumping etc. He then goes on to tell Billy that he is responsible for each and every person, no he isnt God, but he is responsible for every person and animal as well. Billy looks at him as though he is crazy.

Back at home Gaspar admits that he has been doing a lot of thinking about dying, that he is afraid to leave Minny alone. He wont be there to talk to her and she will be well and truly dead and forgotten as they never had any children. Neither of them did much to be remembered for. Billy tells Gaspar he can tell him about Minny and he will do the remembering for him.

Billy admits that he has never had to be responsible for anyone, no wife or family. He never even really knew Charlie, whose grave he visited. He then goes on to tell Gaspar about the events that occurred in Vietnam and how Charlie had saved his life. Billy becomes upset (PTSD), reliving the events and Gaspar attempts to calm him. Billy regrets never having a chance to say thank you to the man whose actions saved his life, while losing his own.

The next morning Billy awakes to find the pocket watch laid on a white handkerchief. As he reaches for the watch it floats into the air just out of reach in a teasing manner, then slowly returns to Gaspars hand as he lays stretched out on the sofa.

Billy do you know what Gaspar means? he asks. Billy shakes his head. Gaspar reminds him of the 3 wise men of the Bible, the Magi. Billy says he has no time for Bible stories but Gaspar continues Gaspar means Master of the Treasure, Keeper of the Secrets and Paladin of the Palace. Gaspar then asks Billy to come out to the Cemetery after he finishes work in the morning as he believes that he might be dying the next day. Billy agrees that he will.

Gaspar and Billy sit in the Cemetery chatting about the book Lost Horizon and how the story told of the High Llama passing on the caretakership of the secret to the hidden of city of Shangri-la. Gaspar says he is going to tell Billy a fascinating story. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII decreed that the entire civilised world would no longer observe the Julian Calendar, October 4th 1582 was followed the next day by October 15th. 11 days just vanished from the world like that. Unfortunately the Pope got it wrong as it was 11 days and 1 hour that had to be adjusted. Now listen very carefully Billy, that hour was left to bounce throughout eternity, a very special hour. An hour that must never be used, an hour that must never Toll. removing the watch from his pocket Gaspar gazed at it and went on with the story. If it strikes 12 then eternal night falls and there is no recall, the light, the wind, the stars and this magnificent place we call the universe will end and in its place waiting, always waiting, hungry to be fed is darkness. No new beginnings, no world without end just the infinite emptiness. Gaspar explains that he is frightened as he just wants to spend his last hour with Minny, that he would sacrifice the universe to see her once more. If he dies without passing it on the watch will begin to tick. He offers the watch to Billy who backs away while asking why him, he is no-one special, certainly not a Paladin, a person to be trusted with Shangri-la. Billy does not want to be trusted with such a secret. That he has never been responsible for anyone. Gaspar corrects him by reminding him that over the past few days Billy had become responsible for him, Gaspar. Billy had taken Gaspar in as a friend despite their obvious differences and due to that he considers Billy worthy of the responsibility. Billy appears to give his silent agreement.

Gaspar then asks for a favour, 1 minute of the time, for the years of service he has given, so that he can touch and kiss his dead wife goodbye forever. Billy steps forward and tells Gaspar that it would be wrong and he knows it. Gaspar smiles and tells Billy that he had passed the final test, and that he had passed it well, that he had been testing him from the beginning and that the hour couldn't be entrusted to just anyone. Gaspar goes on to tell Billy that he and Minny didn't need the minute, but as a going away present he believes that he will gift the minute to Billy, as Billy does need it.

Gasper turns the dial on the watch, a wind whips up around them and through a mist Billy sees and approaches Charlie. The minute is soon up and the vision disappear, Charlie turns toward Gaspar who lies, apparently dead, on the ground by Minnys grave. He cradles Gaspar and tells him that Charlie wasn't aware that he was in the Fox hole, that he never knew that he saved his life. Billy had thanked Charlie but Charlie had simply replied with a Thank you of his own, for having given his death some meaning. Billy pleads with Gaspar not to be dead yet, and Gaspar opens his eyes to look at him. Gaspar tells him he will remember him to his old girl, Minnie, then opens his hand and releases the pocket watch. The pocket watch hovers then floats and settles on Billys outstretched hand. Gaspar dies with a smile on his face as Billy cradles him in his arms.

Narration at End: Like a wind crying endlessly through the universe Time carries away the names and the deeds of conquerors and commoners alike. And all that we were, all that remains is in the memories of those who cared we came this way for a brief moment. A blessing of the Eighteenth Egyptian Dynasty, God be between you and harm in all the empty places you walk."

Over the next few days, Norma and Arthur argue over whether or not it's real (Arthur thinks nothing will happen, but Norma keeps thinking of how much money it is) and Arthur throws the box away. In the middle of the night, Norma retrieves the box from the dumpster explaining that Mr. Steward said he would return for the box because the boxes are reprogrammed and reused. Norma and Arthur continue to argue and are very bitter towards each other, themselves and the world in general.

Norma finally decides that she is going to push the button. Arthur tells and then begs her not to, but she opens the top and pushes the button.

Therefore, his people's full war fleet is arriving in 24 hours to destroy all life on Earth. The UN Diplomats frantically beg for another chance to set things right in the alien people's eyes. The ambassador, indifferent, asks what they could possibly hope to accomplish. The American diplomat points out that the alien fleet isn't due to arrive for 24 hours-- at least give Earth that much time. The alien ambassador is still skeptical, but knowing that the Earth people are right in that his fleet isn't arriving for 24 hours, agrees to the request.

The UN Diplomats discuss and debate tirelessly into the evening and night, struggling to come to worldwide agreements. The alien ambassador presents himself to the UN Council on time at the end of the 24 hours, and the council proudly presents him with a completed peace treaty-- rules and plans for global disarmament and all humans living in peace.

The alien ambassador stares at the treaty and begins to laugh. As his laughter grows louder, the council begins to join in-- but suddenly the ambassador hurls the treaty to the floor, and still amused, tells the council that they've misunderstood him. Earth's 'small talent for war' is in fact TOO small for his people's tastes-- his race is a race of warriors that seeds and raises other warrior races to fight across the galaxy with and for them. Earth's savagery hasn't bred true-- humans fight hopelessly backward, erratically and clumsily; their weapons are shockingly crude and primitive, and to top it all off... they hope for PEACE. But it's easily fixed, says the ambassador... his people will simply try again. But he thanks the UN Council for a very amusing meeting, reminding them of a famous Earth quote that death comes easy, but comedy is hard to achieve. The ambassador transports back to his ship and the segment closes with Earth's skies growing dark as the ambassador's people's war fleet arrives to destroy all life on the planet."

George is a young boy left alone with his infirm grandmother, after his mother must tend to his brother, who apparently has broken his leg. The mother is concerned that George is still frightened of his grandmother, but George insists he's not. As soon as the mother leaves, George goes about dealing with the household chores he was asked to do and his school work. However, a dark storm seems to come on suddenly and a monstrous growl comes from the bedroom. It is apparently the grandmother asking George for her tea. After a frightening optical illusion, George hides, but then he realizes he must still bring her the tea. As he walks down the hall to the grandmother's room, George hears his mother and other family members echoing in his head, discussing how dangerous she is now that she's senile. As he enters her room, he starts thinking about how awful it would be if she died while he was watching her. A gnarled hand reaches out and frightens George into dropping the tea and he runs out.

After soul-searching for a while, George goes back in to clean up the broken tea cup and tea. He accidentally opens a panel in the floor from which he hears screams and red light and smoke. He thinks it's Hell. George then finds his grandmother's books and runs out with them. George, in the kitchen, looks over his grandmother's books. They appear to be ""books of the dead"" and others written in strange characters that he can't read. He draws the conclusion that his grandmother wrote some of the books and apparently she is a witch. George re-enters his grandmother's room and tries to rouse her. He thinks she must be dead. He then runs to the phone to call the hospital. He then goes over in his head about covering her face, talking to the doctor and going back in the room even though he doesn't want to. As he does, however, a gnarled hand reaches out and grabs him. He sees a strange red eye open and look at him. She apparently magically draws him to her and she embraces him, telling him he is her favorite. Then he seems to disappear.

The mother returns to find George at the kitchen table with the books. George claims that the grandmother died and he didn't know what to do. The mother tries to comfort him, but as she holds him she does not see that he now has red eyes like Gramma.

""Personal Demons"" (by Rockne S. O'Bannon)

A successful but aging writer, Rockne O'Bannon, is complaining to his neighbor that he has writers' block and that the last original idea he had was twenty years ago. His neighbor tells him he should consider retiring, but Rockne decides he must write one more story.

Later that day, as he is going to his car, he sees a diminutive hooded creature with a monstrous face, running toward him but he is able to escape. That night, his car is destroyed by a group of these creatures, and he discovers that only he can see them. The creatures break into his apartment, trashing it, and corner him. Rockne asks the creatures what they want, and the creatures offer to leave and never return if he writes about them. As Rockne begins writing, the creatures disappear one by one.

""Cold Reading"" (by Rebecca Parr and Martin Pasko)

Milo Trent, an aspiring radio drama actor in the '30s, is invited as a last-minute replacement for a famous weekly show Dick Noble, African Explorer. The show is a creation of the famous writer Nelson Westbrook, who often does rewrites on the fly while in the studio with the actors. But, when Westbrook accidentally wishes for realistic sound effects while holding an ancient voodoo artifact, he gets what he wanted--and more.

As the actors in the studio read out their lines, the exact things happen to them--first there is a storm inside the studio, then African tribesmen appear, followed by monkeys, parrots, rifles in the distance, etc. Realizing very well that their safety is in peril, Westbrook feverishly rewrites the show so nothing drastic happens, writing around a plane crash and an earthquake amongst other things.

With all hazards averted, the cast brings the show to an ending and everyone breathes a sigh of relief. The relief turns out to be rather premature, as one can imagine what happens when the show host announces next week's episode: ""Dick Noble and the Invaders from Mars""."

A truck is heading down a highway and passes a slower-moving sports car. A group of bikers are coming down the highway on their side, and they scatter and go off on the embankment as the truck passes them.

Later at a bar, the truck driver, Johnny Davis, is having a beer with another trucker Pete Siekovich. He tells Pete that nobody was hurt, but insurance companies will no longer help him. Johnny remembers that something happened to Pete a few years back but he still found work. Pete tells Johnny that Johnny doesn't want his kind of work, but Johnny calls in an old debt Pete owes to Johnny's father.

Pete says that he was a drunk and a dead-ender, and guys like him are the only one that's taking the hauling job he's doing. He warns Johnny to make sure he has no other options if he's going to sign on. Johnny admits that he's had four accidents in two years, and he's a dead-ender. Pete tells him that he's going on a run the next day, and if Johnny goes with him then Pete will show him the ropes. Johnny agrees and Pete tells him the company carries its own insurance.

The next day, Pete drives his truck onto a road Johnny doesn't recognize. The older man says that the road looks less familiar once they ""cross over"", and Pete drives up to a fenced compound. Armed guards let the truck in, and people gather at the fences, looking out. Pete shows his manifest to a guard, who lights his cigarette from Pete with the heat from his bare hand. Johnny notices, and Pete tells him that the guards love cigarettes.

Johnny notices the guards manhandling one of the prisoners already there as the guards load the prisoners into the back of the truck, and tells him to stop. Pete tells Johnny not to interfere, and says that the prisoners aren't alive. He stabs one prisoner with a belt buckle knife and nothing happens, proving his point. A guard comes over, calls Johnny a troublemaker, and touches him one finger, burning him. Pete tells the guard that it's Johnny first run and didn't mean anything, and pays the guard with cigarette to leave it alone. Once the guard leaves, Pete tells Johnny to do what he does and not say anything.

That night, Pete drives his truck out and tells Johnny that the ""boss"" let some of them manage the others. Humanity has free will, and some of them chose evil. Since the souls are immortal, the boss created a ""toxic waste dump"" so they wouldn't poison other people. Pete explains that in China and India, they have trains. In Russia they have tramlines, while in Mexico they use buses. As it rains, Johnny says they should give them a trap but Pete dismisses them as ""just cargo"", and they're past caring. The older driver says that the rain will stop by the time they reach the next truck stops, and wherever there are trucks there are truck stops... even in Hell.

Later, Pete pulls into a truck stop, and he goes inside to get them a table. Johnny checks the fifth wheel and one of the damned souls grabs him through the slats. Two women beg Johnny to help them when they're not looking, but Johnny ignores them

Inside, one of the drivers is complaining to another about what he's seen. The older driver tells him it's none of their business, and the complaining driver Merle says that when they die, it will be their business. Pete is seated nearby, and tells Merle to take it easy. Johnny comes in and joins Pete at their table, and Merle leaves in disgust. The older trucker says there's been some disturbances down the line in the ""outer circle"", but figures the guards will have it under control in a day or two. He tells Pete and Johnny to watch out for number one and not worry about it, and the less they know the better off they'll be. The waitress is one of the demons, and lights her cigarette the same way the guard did.

Pete and Johnny leaves, and when Johnny asks, Pete explains that the deeper they go into the city, the older the dead become. The city expands with each new shipment. They entered the wall city, which is made to look normal to calm the cargo down. As they drive in, Johnny comments about the lack of flames and Pete explains that management doesn't care about punishment as long as the evil souls are put away where they can't do anyone harm. They pull up to the embarkment terminal past damned souls running free and setting fires, The guards are whipping the damned to control the rioting, and Pete says they should drop out the cargo and get out.

The souls pull one guard down, and Johnny goes over to help the guard. The guard's helmet is off, revealing is Hell face, and throws Johnny away. As Johnny recovers, a woman among the cargo runs over and says that she must be there because she never thought of anyone but herself. She tells Johnny that she's learned better and needs another chance. Another soul shoves her aside and tells Johnny that his great sin was that he loved dirt, and the clean just passed him by. Another woman says that he let her kids run around without guidance, but she didn't know any better. Johnny says that he can't do anything for them, Another soul says that he had a family and did everything for them, but didn't go to church every Sunday and was an atheist. He wonder what kind of God sends someone to Hell for not believing him.

A man, Gary Frick, comes up, leads Johnny away, and says that per union rules, one of the employees will come by and help Johnny. Gary explains that he used to be a manager, then died and came there as cargo. When Johnny says that the ""sinners"" didn't sound any worse than the living, including him, Gary agrees that none of them deserve to be there, including himself. Johnny figures that the disturbances are about the unjust rebelling, and Gary tells him that word's getting around and he's helping to get it around. He says that if there's enough trouble, he figures the Boss will hear about it and take charge. Gary says that the Boss has delegated the management, and tells Johnny there's injustice in Hell and Johnny is in a position to help. He tells Johnny that he found out in management where the High Road is.

Pete comes over, interrupting, and Gary runs off after whispering something in Johnny's ear. A guard is with Pete, who tells Johnny that the guards are taking care of the disturbances. The guard asks who Johnny was talking about, then grabs him and tells him that Management will want to talk to him.

Johnny is taken to the Dispatcher, who is a pastoral setting. The Dispatcher says that he's heard good things from the field about Johnny, and Johnny asks who Gary is. The other man is shocked to hear that Gary ended up on the Low Road, but not surprised. The Dispatcher dismisses Gary as a troublemaker, and figures Johnny has been taken in by secular propaganda. He says that his predecessor wasn't a religious man, and thought he could compromise. The Dispatcher insists that sinners go to Hell and deserve to be there, and figures that after the ""moral realignment"", there are dispatchers but they'll fade away.

When Johnny points out that Gary thinks the Boss doesn't do the choosing anymore, the Dispatcher says that the Boss doesn't want to be bothered with the bookkeeping, so he makes the final decisions. However, the Dispatcher says that in a larger sense mankind is in charge, and has been for centuries. He says that it's important that Johnny stay on the job, driving the ungodly away from the righteous. The Dispatcher says that if Johnny quits, he'll be giving up his job security, and then asks if Gary said anything else. Johnny says that there wasn't, and that now that the Dispatcher has explained the situation, he understands that he has a responsibility to stay on the job.

Later, Johnny is delivering souls to Hell. He pulls over and asks them what put them on the Low Road. One man says that he offered a cop, another says he was a rapist and an arsonist. An old woman says that she doesn't know what put her there but she never harmed anyone intentionally. She was a school librarian who protested against book bans. Another woman was a junkie and didn't hurt anyone but herself.

A draft dodger steps forward and says there must be a mistake, and he skipped to Canada because he knew he could never hurt anyone. Another man wonders if he was put there just for being gay. Johnny orders the four people he talked to out, and gives them Gary's directions to the High Road. He admits that he doesn't know what's at the end of the road, but it may not be their idea of Heaven. Johnny warns them that it's a risk, and the High Road is always a risk, but a least it's a chance.

The librarian asks why Johnny is doing it, and he tells her that he's just doing his bit. He talks about a Sunday school story about how Christ spend time in Hell harrowing, separating the righteous from the ungodly. Johnny figures that he's follow an old tradition, harrowing Hell. They thank him and go to the High Road, and Johnny returns to his truck to deliver the remaining souls to the Low Road."

Joseph Fitzgerald is a professor at Harvard University in the year 2172. He is the last living direct descendant of John F. Kennedy. He is fascinated with his ancestor's story and eventually gains access to a means of travelling back to the 1960's to try and meet him. He ends up in Dallas, Texas in 1963, realizing he is at the scene of Kennedy's assassination. With foreknowledge of the event, he manages to intervene and save Kennedy's life. This brings him to the attention of a grateful president, although very shortly after, a different crisis emerges: Soviet Premier Kruschev has been assassinated. Fitzgerald consults his AI temporal adviser, which tells him that the Kruschev assassination was effected to balance the temporal instability created by the stopping of Kennedy's death. Fitzgerald asks the AI adviser to predict outcomes in the fallout of the Kruschev assassination and is horrified at the grim prediction that no matter what develops short-term, there is a 100% absolute guarantee that the culmination of the event will be some form of war between the United States and the Soviet Union which will completely eradicate all life on the planet. The only way to prevent this armageddon is for the changing of history to be changed back the way it originally was. A grim Fitzgerald reveals his true nature, and what he's learned, to President Kennedy, who is horrified but bravely agrees to face his impending death for the sake of saving all life on the planet. Fitzgerald goes back to where he arrived in the 1960's to reset history back the way it was. However, he sacrifices himself to die in Kennedy's stead, and sends Kennedy back to 2172. The segment closes with Kennedy addressing the Harvard graduating class of 2172 with a speech about the noble tenets of humanity.

BUTTON, BUTTON SYNOPSIS:

Arthur and Norma Lewis are a very poor married couple dealing with financial hardships that directly affects their marital relationship. Out of nowhere, they are visited by a mysterious man calling himself Mr. Steward, who brings them a curious wooden box with a single button on top. This 'button unit,' as he calls it, allows them a unique opportunity. If they push the button within 24 hours, they will receive a very large sum of money. There is a catch: he tells them somewhere in the world, ""someone that you do not know,"" will die. They have 24 hours to decide whether or not to push the button, before he returns to collect the button unit.

Norma and Arthur spend many hours pondering and debating the moral ramifications of the offer. The knowledge that they will be causing the death of another human being, even that of a stranger they've never met, is very troubling... but the financial incentive would grant them a chance at improving their own lives... and of course, in turn, their marriage. Would the loss of a stranger's life warrant their getting a chance at having a better life?

Finally Norma unlocks the glass lid over the button, and presses it. Nothing out of the ordinary seems to happen except for a faint sound produced by pushing the button.

Mr. Steward arrives in the morning to collect the button unit and hands them a briefcase containing the money promised. It is theirs to do with as they please, and it is tax-free to boot. Norma asks if someone died, and Mr. Steward assures them that yes, someone did. It is in the past, and their future involves using the money as they see fit. As Mr. Steward leaves, Norma curiously asks what he will do with the button unit now. Mr. Steward says it will be reset and then given to someone else, which he emphasizes to her, will be, ""someone that you do not know."" The screen freezes on Norma's face, locked in horror, as she realizes that she is likely to be the next victim to die."

Looks like revolutionary war times. Red coats vs. blue coats. A bluecoat shoots his gun at the redcoats hiding behind a tree. He comes out and feels the pulse of a fallen comrade. Another soldier suddenly yells, ""CRANE!!"" while pointing to something behind him.

A redcoat soldier riding a pale white horse jumps over a small barrier. He looks pretty menacing and his face is completely covered with some kind of cloth. Crane shoots him in this shoulder with his gun and the red coat falls off his horse. Instead of staying down, he simply rises back up like he is not even hurt. Crane has a 'WTF' look on his face. The redcoat takes out this huge halberd and takes a swipe at Crane. The camera zooms in on the tatoo or some kind of burn mark on the red coat's hand; looks like a bow of some type. The red coat swings his halberd and slices open Crane's chest. As Crane is about to fall, he swings his sword cutting the redcoat's head off. Crane falls down as does the headless horseman.. Everything fades to black.

We hear a woman's voice saying that they don't have much time...

Suddenly we see Crane's hands burst out of the ground like he has been buried alive. Jars containing snakes, frogs and other weird things start to break around him.. He is in some kind of cave. Crane stumbles around and touches one of the rocks which magically opens the cave to the outside world. It is all foggy everywhere when he comes out and looks to be morning or afternoon. He wanders around and suddenly notices that he is now walking on asphalt. He touches it, wondering what in the world is going now. Suddenly a huge semi track zooms by nearing hitting him. Another car drives by and clips him with the side view mirror. We see a hawk of some kind land on a sign which says:

Sleepy Hollow population: 144,000

Crane runs away from the scene into the fog.

Cut to a scene with the sheriff talking to his deputy at some diner. It is now nighttime. The deputy's name is Abbie. They joke around about this and that. The deputy is suppose to be leaving for Quantico next month. She has been accepted to the FBI. She is excited, but the sheriff asks her if she is just running away. He jokes with her that she is going to miss all of this. They receive a call that something is scaring the horses at some dude's farm. As they are leaving the diner, they pass a priest who is sitting in the booth behind them. The sheriff and pastor greet each other. They drive down there to check it out, thinking it is probably just wolves or something.

They drive to the farm and suddenly there is wind, lightning and thunder every. Feels like some scene from a Tim Burton movie. The sheriff tells Abbie to go and look for the owner while he goes to check out the horses. Abbie knocks on their door and there is no one home. She walks around and finds a rifle on the ground. Next to the rifle, she finds the body of the owner missing his head. She radios the sheriff, telling him that the owner is dead. The transmission kind of breaks up. The sheriff looks up and sees the Headless Horseman walk out of the stable with a white horse. He looks pretty freaked out and starts to unload his gun on him. It does not seem to faze him. By the time Abbie reaches the barn, the huge blade from the halberd comes through the wall. The Headless Horseman comes out and rides away. Abbie sees everything and notices the bow-shaped burn or tattoo on the horseman's hand. When she goes into the barn, the sheriff is dead. He has also been beheaded. She radios out officer down...

In town, another deputy is in his car and almost hits Crane. For reasons unknown at the time, he immediately arrest Crane for the murder of the sheriff.

In the morning, they have Crane locked up. Abbie says that he is not the person who killed the sheriff. They hook him up to a lie detector and start asking him questions. He tells them that his name is Ichabod Crane and he is a spy for General Washington. He had a wife named Katrina. He was with the British army, but once he saw what was happening he became a spy. How he thought he had died since his chest was sliced open, etc... He is surprised to find out that so much time has passed and has no idea what is going on. He passes the lie detector tests. Everyone thinks that he is crazy. They are going to put him in a psychiatric ward. Abbie asks the captain if she could interview him once. He refuses, but she tells him that she wants closure since her partner and friend just died. He agrees to let her take him to the psychiatric ward.

She goes to the holding cell where Ichabod wonders when woman were allowed to wear trousers. How she escaped slavery, etc... Basically everything you can possible say to piss off an African-American woman, he says it. Ichabod asks her if the killer had a bow-shaped tattoo or burn on his hand. Abbie asks how he could possible know that since she was the only one who saw it. She starts to drive him to the psychiatric ward and on the way there, the priest from the dinner sees him. He looks really scared. Ichabod asks her if she has experienced something that she can't explain before. She does not answer. Ichabod tells her that he was sure that he shot the horseman and yet it did not even faze him. Abbie then asks him to take her to the cave where he was buried. They arrive at the cave, and they look around. Ichabod finds a bible next to where he was buried. Memories kind of pass before him. We can now see the woman who said that they don't have much time. Ichabod is lying in some kind of bed and the bible he is holding is pressed against his chest. We also see the priest from the diner in the vision as well. She tells him that he is sorry about not telling him something but this is the only way... He snaps out of it and sees that the there is a bookmark in the bible. The bookmark points to the Book of Revelations.

It is now night and the Horseman has come for the priest at the diner. The priest runs around his church when he finally encounters the Horseman. He does some kind of magic and chains from the walls shoot out. The Horseman breaks them with his halberd. The priest yells out that he will never tell him where it is, that he would rather die. The Horseman chops his head off.

The police arrive on the scene. Abbie brings Ichabod with and tells him to stay in the car. Her captain is beyond pissed since she disobeyed a direct order. She tells him that he could not have killed the priest since he was with her the whole afternoon. He does not care. The guy who arrested Ichabod tells her that she has to distance herself from Ichabod. He advises her that Ichabod will bring her down.

The hawk that landed on the Sleepy Hollow sign lands on top of the police car. Ichabod tries to get out but it is difficult since he does not know how to open the door. He finally gets out and starts to follow the hawk. The deputies try to arrest him again but Abbie comes to his rescue. The hawk lands on the grave stone and it happens to be the grave of Katrina Crane. She was burned for practicing witchcraft.

Abbie finally takes Ichabod to the mental institution. While there, she admits that she has experienced something that she could not explain. When she was a child, Abbie and her sister were walking through the woods to go home. Suddenly they felt something that was not quite right. They both saw these four white trees and there was some kind of a creature beyond them. The creature made some kind of a noise and they both blacked out. When the police found them, they could not find any white trees and there was no creature. Everyone thought that they had made the whole thing up. She made it through all right but her sister has been in and out of mental institutions since the incident. They wish each other good night and he is locked up in a room.

Abbie visits the sheriff's office. She is looking around and picks up a picture of herself when she graduated the academy. As she picks it up, she hears something rattle. She looks and finds a key hidden in the back of the picture frame. She wanders around his office trying to see what the key might unlock. She then notices this handle on his desk and inserts the key. This huge drawer opens upward and there is a box of files hidden inside. She digs through and it seems that the sheriff was doing some weird investigating on his own. He has found that there seem to be two covenants living in the city. One for good and one for evil as far as he can tell. They have all changed their names and have scattered across the Eastern seaboard. There are a lot of unexplained homicides that no one is investigating. He knows that they are connected but he has no idea how. She then finds a file on her incident in the forest. It seems that the four white trees and creature have been seen before. In a diary to himself, he says that he wants to go to Abbie with this new information but he does not know how. How can she believe this? There is also some old looking map of the city with certain things marked off.. The captain suddenly appears and asks what she is doing there. She tells him that she was looking at old case files to see if there is anything useful. She leaves with the map and a few letters.

Ichabod is sleeping when the hawk from before lands on the bed frame at the foot of his bed. It flies into the mirror and all of a sudden he is in the woods with Katrina. She tells him that this was the only way she could communicate with him and guide him. She has been imprison somehow. He is the first witness. When he chopped off the Horseman's head, their blood mixed together. The both of them are now connected. When they put that spell on him, they had to put it on both of them. They trapped the Horseman's body in a box under the river while they buried him in that cave. He asks her if she is a witch. She tells him that she belongs to a covenant sworn to protect Sleepy Hollow from the evil that lies within it. She says that she guided him to the grave stone because that is where the Horseman's head is hidden. He has to find it because if the horseman finds it, the end will begin. The scene shakes and she says that they have found her. The four white trees appear behind her and the creature Abbie saw appears. She tells him that the Horseman cannot survive until morning. She begs him to help free her from her prison. All of the answers are in Washington's bible. He wakes up flailing around and the nurse and orderlies are trying to calm him down. The nurse is about to inject him with something. Abbie arrives to tell them that he is leaving with her.

Ichabod explains to her that it is all in Washington's bible. The Headless Horseman is one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Abbie shows him the map she found in the sheriff's old office. He says that he recognizes the handwriting. It belonged to General Washington. He tells her that he was sent on a secret mission by General Washington. At the battle which occurred at the beginning of the show, there was going to be a soldier there. His mission was to kill this soldier. He would know once he saw him because he would be different. He was riding a Pale Horse, so therefore Ichabod concludes that he must be Death himself. He also explains he knows what the Horseman is after: his own head, which has been hidden at the grave site of Katrina Crane. They rush off to the church where they found her grave site the night before.

It is now getting dark and we see the Horseman rise out of the river. His horse is already by the river side waiting. Abbie radios to her colleague that arrested Crane the day before. She tells him that he has to tell all units to report to the church. She believes the murderer will show up there today. The colleague tells him that she has to stop doing this. It is going to end badly for her. She asks him to trust her. She can't call it in because no one will believe her and the captain is already not liking her for taking Ichabod to the cave. He finally agrees as he is walking to his apartment. He notices that his door has been kicked in. He takes out his gun. He walks into his apartment and sees that someone has broken into his safe. The Headless Horseman suddenly rises from his chair. He has a shotgun and machine gun in his hand. Suddenly the deputy tells him he knows where his head is located and that he can help him.

It is now night and Ichabod is digging up Katrina's grave site. His shovel finally hits the coffin and he pulls out a glass jar with a decayed demon head inside. The eyes on the demon head sudden open as the Horseman has arrived. He starts to fire his shotgun at Ichabod and Abbie. Ichabod holds onto the jar and falls into the grave site that he dug up. Abbie falls back to hide on the street. The Horseman then takes out his machine gun and starts firing everywhere. The deputy comes up behind Abbie and she asks him where is the backup. He tells her that he called it in but no one is here yet. She turns around and he knocks her out. He takes her to his car and keeps on telling her that he wants to protect her. It can't be killed because it is Death. Ichabod is now fighting the horseman with a shovel. Pretty funny scene when he tries to hit the horseman on the head with the shovel only to miss because he has no head. =) Abbie kind of wakes up and nearly bites off the deputy's thumb. She handcuffs him the door and takes out a shotgun from his police car. She completely unloads on the Headless Horseman. Ichabod runs toward her and the Horseman follows. Finally the rest of the police show up. Ichabod and Abbie runs toward the police cars as the Horseman gives chase. Two police guys arrive on the scene to see the Headless Horseman walking towards them. They are both pretty freaked out. Suddenly the shoulder of the Horseman starts to smoke. We see the sun starting to come up. He turns around and talks towards his horse which suddenly appears. He rides away probably back to the river.

The Captain is beyond angry with Abbie but he has to believe her that a headless horseman is stalking the town. Those two police guys say that they saw the same thing as her. The Horseman's head is also in police custody now. The deputy that Abbie bit is also in custody and they want to interview him. The captain asks if she is still leaving for Quantico and she now says that she is staying. She is not running away.

We see the deputy sitting in the holding area. Suddenly a door of light opens up and the demon thing behind the four white trees comes out. He starts to beg to have another chance. It says that he has failed him and flips him backward. He is dead now. By the time Ichabod and Abbie arrive, we see the demon walking away through the mirror in the cell. It looks back at her and the mirror breaks. She recognizes that it was the thing that she saw when she was little. Ichabod suddenly takes out the Bible and tells her that them meeting might be destiny. Katrina called him the first witness. The Bible says that there would be two witnesses and the both of them would have to go through 7 years of tribulation. He thinks Abbie is the 2nd witness and therefore, they should work together to stop this."

He becomes caught in vines and is dragged down to a cave below.

He sees his wife Katrina, who tells him they're safe for the moment. ""Before the four horsemen will ride, an army of evil make way for their arrival. The first dark spirit rises with the blood moon,"" she tells him cryptically. ""She's one of us, you must stop her before she kills again,"" she says.

Katrina disappears and Ichabod wakes up with a start in his motel room.

At the station, Captain Irving tells Abbie Mills that the two other men who saw the Headless Horseman have recanted their stories, knowing how they sounded.

She's wondering what the explanation is for Andy's death. Surveillance footage shows him running full speed into the mirror and his head popping back, but Abbie knows that's not what happened.

She says Ichabod will back her up, but Irving points out he's not the most reliable witness and there's a psychological condition that could explain why he's so sure of who he is, even though it sounds crazy.

In his hotel room, Ichabod gets ready with the aid of Post-It explaining the shower, hair dryer and coffee machine.

Irving tells Abbie he's going to Albany and gives her some latitude to investigate. She goes to see Ichabod, who is super annoyed to be under guard at the motel.

He tells her about his vision, but she's skeptical.

In a morgue, a body comes back to life and rips its way out of a body bag. It's Andy, with his head bent backwards like a Pez Dispenser. The demon appears and pops his head back the right way, and gives him some sort of direction. Andy pulls a medallion from down his throat. The demon tells him something in whatever demon language he's speaking.

""Release who?"" Andy asks.

Abbie tries to pry the story of how Ichabod met Katrina and why he didn't know she was a witch. He thinks it was for his protection. She wants to get him a cover identity.

Andy, the undead with some extra skin around his neck where it was stretched backwards, gets in a patrol car.

Abbie attends the sheriff's funeral, as Ichabod hangs back. He visits Katrina's grave, wondering what ""one of us"" means.

Then he realizes she was referring to a witch.

In the dead of night, Andy goes to a circle of stones and puts the medallion from the demon on it. A crusty looking dead woman appears.

He relays the demon's message: ""The ashes of the pious will ordain your resurrection; take their flesh and you will reclaim yours.""

Later, undead Andy pulls over a man and asks his full name, Jeremy Stephen Firth. ""Jeremy, I want you to know where ever this road takes you -- and it won't be far -- it wasn't personal,"" Andy says. He gets in his patrol car and drives off.

The crusty dead woman leaps on Jeremy's windshield and incinerates his car with the touch of her hand.

Back at the station, Abbie is having a hard time adjusting to the idea they're after a witch. Crane thinks she hasn't had time to mourn the sheriff, whom he can tell meant a lot to her.

She tells a story about how she got into drugs after she and her sister saw the demon in the woods. She broke into a pharmacy and Sheriff Corbin caught her, but instead of taking her to jail, he took her to a diner and gave her a chance to change.

Abbie gets a call about unusual activity. It's Jeremy's burnt out car with his charred remains inside, bearing deep claw marks. There's something familiar about it to Crane.

He tells her about returning to his regiment during the war during a blood moon to find the same kind of burned out bodies. George Washington believed it was Serilda of Abadon, who had formed an alliance with the Red Coats.

They head back to the station to check the sheriff's files on the good and bad covens, but his office has been cleaned out.

While Abbie goes to find the files, a stern dude named Luke interrogates Crane, who says he's a history professor from Oxford, specializing in the American Revolutionary war. When Abbie comes back, Crane correctly guesses that Luke is her ex.

They need to get into the guarded archives across the street to get the sheriff's files. It used to be the armory and Crane knows a back way in. He finds the way he was looking for has been sealed off, so he hacks at the wall with the fire axe, revealing a secret passageway. It used to be used to transport weapons during the war.

He finds old crates of gun powder, right where he left them. The walls are lined with the bones of witches, who weren't deemed worthy of burial in graveyards.

In the archives, Abbie finds Corbin's files.

Andy visits a house and talks to a young boy playing soccer outside. Andy asks about this dad, and the boy says he's dead. The boy's name is Kyle Hemmington.

In the archives, Crane mentions he speaks several languages and has a photographic memory. He finds record of what happened to Sirilda. A white coven used magic to weaken her and a hunting party captured her.

Before she was burned at the stake she declared: ""By the turn of the blood moon the ashes of your ancestry shall be mine. Your flesh will be my flesh, I will live again.""

The magistrate who sentenced her was named Firth, like the burned victim in the car. They figure she needs the ashes of his descendants.

Kyle's mom tucks him in to bed.

Abbie traces the magistrates bloodline to the Firths and also a daughter who married a Hemmington.

Kyle hears noises in his house and goes downstairs to investigate. He finds the front door open. Charred Serilda lurks behind him.

He screams and his mom comes running. Abbie and Ichabod come in, Kyle is safe but swears he saw a woman who looked like she was on fire.

Kyle's dad's urn is missing. Kyle was adopted, the urn gives Serilda everything she needs.

Ichabod and Abbie try to figure out what Serilda needs to complete the ritual -- her own bones. They'd be buried down in the tunnels.

In the tunnels, Andy digs up a bag of bones as Serilda watches.

Abbie and Ichabod arrive and search for her.

Serilda begins the ritual with her bones and the ashes of the magistrates descendants. She lies down on top of the bones and begins to regenerate as flesh.

Ichabod arrives in time to see her come back to life. He fires with the gun Abbie gave him, but Serilda catches the bullet.

He runs for the black powder crates, thinking the gun is now empty.

Serilda talks to Ichabod about his wife, the one who bound her power. She tells him Katrina is in the world between worlds.

Crane puts the crates across her path in the tunnel and they take cover. He throws his torch and waits. Nothing happens at first, but then there's an explosion that takes out Serilda.

Later, Crane wonders if what Serilda said about his wife means she can be freed.

Crane goes to get coffee and Abbie looks towards Sheriff Corbin's office and sees him there. She thinks she's dreaming. She wonders if he was ever going to tell her what he knew, but he points out she wouldn't have believed him.

""You're so afraid of what you don't understand that it kept you from seeing who you really are, what you're meant to do,"" he says.

Finally, he tells her: ""Don't be afraid of No. 49, that's where you'll find you're not alone.""

Abbie turns around when she hears Crane. She had a vision.

In room 49 in a mental hospital , an orderly brings Jenny Mills her nightly pills as she does furious push-ups. She says she hasn't seen anything lately since she started taking the pills.

She fakes taking her pills and gets back to her work-out. The demon briefly appears in her room, but she doesn't see it and continues on, getting ready."

Abbie sees who the suspect is -- it's her teen self. Ichabod -- whose eyes are whited out - yells at her to tell the truth, and adult Abbie busts in, the room swirling. She doesn't understand what's going on. She wakes up and is called to a scene.

A doctor named Maura Vega is threatening to jump off a building and will only speak with Abbie. When Abbie gets up there, the doctor says ""everything she said"" was the truth and she believed her but didn't say anything.

The doctor turns to face Abbie, it's the woman from her dream and her eyes are whited out. The doctor is talking about Abbie's sister, Jenny.

""I've had this coming a long time, we all have,"" Dr. Vega says, and jumps.

Later, Abbie tells Ichabod and Irving about Vega's glazed over white eyes. They head to check out the corpse. The paramedic shows them the eyes, which she says look like cataracts. Then the eyeball explodes in grains of sand.

After the doctor's body is taken away, Irving finds that Dr. Vega did a year of residency at the same hospital where Jenny was locked up for her first year away.

Abbie tells Ichabod that Dr. Vega was in her dream, along with a faceless nightmare monster. But she'd never met Vega before. Ichabod calls it a prophetic dream, but Abbie isn't thrilled with the ""Witness"" label, no matter what he thinks the book of Revelation says.

Later, they watch a recording of Jenny's report of seeing a demon when she was a teenager. Abbie finds in Vega's notes a reference that Jenny showed no other signs of mental illness.

Abbie's willing to write off the doctor's suicide as guilt over letting Jenny stay locked up when she knew she wasn't crazy -- but Ichabod reminds her of the sand eyeball and her own dream. He wants to go see Jenny, whom Abbie hasn't spoken to in five years.

Jenny is locked up because she broke into a sporting goods store and stole $4,000 worth of survival gear because she was ""preparing for the end of days.""

Abbie hears the nurse call over to room 49 and remembers her vision in which the Sheriff told her not to fear ""Number 49.""

Jenny refuses to see Abbie, so Ichabod goes instead. After some small talk, he tells her he's seen the demon she saw. She sarcastically warns him to follow her sister's lead and not say things like that.

""That's why I'm in here and she's out there,"" Jenny says, telling him to ask Abbie for the whole story.

He tells Jenny about Dr. Vega's death and that she said ""we've all got it coming.""

He says they both know there are things ""not of this realm"" in Sleepy Hollow and the first Horseman has already killed people. He says he doesn't think Jenny is crazy, and neither does Abbie.

She tells him it's too late to fight the Horseman's army. ""My conscious is clear, ask Abbie if she can say the same,"" she says.

As they leave, Ichabod asks Abbie what happened and she tells him something she's never told anyone. When she saw the thing in the woods she remembered waking up. It felt like she'd been asleep moments, but it had been four days and the whole town was looking for them. A rancher found them and saw the demon, too.

When they were taken in, she told Jenny not to say anything about what they saw, but she didn't listen. Jenny told them what she saw, but Abbie said she didn't see anything. Abbie blames Jenny for not listening to her to stay silent.

They were in a good foster home and Abbie didn't want them to get in trouble for being out sneaking beers. Ichabod says Abbie needs to admit she turned her back on her sister. He thinks she's still afraid to admit what she saw.

He wants to go talk to the rancher, Mr. Gillespie, who also saw it and never said anything.

At his place, Gillespie drifts off with a beer in his hand. Suddenly, his eyes fly open at a noise. He goes to investigate and cuts his leg on nail sticking out of a table. The cloth he uses to wipe the blood away takes on an odd symbol.

He goes through his garage and takes out a gun. The demon appears behind him, then disappears as he fires.

Captain Irving comes out into the squad room with a road sign of a horseback rider -- with the top of the sign broken off. Detective Morales cops to the prank, which Irving commends him on. They get a report of shots fired at the Gillespie ranch and head there.

Abbie and Ichabod pull up to Gillespie's house, but it's already surrounded by patrol cars. Gillespie has taken his wife hostage and demands to speak to Abbie.

She goes in the house and finds Gillespie on the floor of his kitchen with his wife nearby. His wife warns Abbie to get out and says he's lost his mind.

She sees his eyes are glazed over white. Suddenly, Gillespie sees the demon behind Abbie and fires in the air. He warns her ""the Sandman"" is coming for her next. ""Next time you fall asleep, you're dead,"" Gillespie says. Then he blows his head off.

Later at night, outside the Gillespie house, Abbie tells Ichabod what Gillespie said. He suggests the Sandman is the faceless nightmare monster from her dream.

Back in the archives, Abbie looks into the sheriff's files on sleep demons and finds one that bears the symbol that was left on Gillespie's bloody rag.

Ichabod is familiar with the Mohawk sleep demon. They told him about the spirit of Rokaronti who would come for you if you didn't do right by your neighbor.

Ichabod suggests they visit a Mohawk shaman. She gives him the bad news about the Native Americans.

She suggests another kid of shaman and takes him to a used car lot, Geronimotors, which is owned by a Mohawk man. He thinks Ichabod is joking when he mentions Rokaronti, but eventually believes him. He takes them to a kind of lodge out away from town. He gives Abbie a potion that will allow her to walk in the dream world and take on the demon, but warns her if she dies there, she really dies.

Ichabod chugs the potion to join her. Then the shaman tells them they need scorpion venom to be able to control what they do in the spirit world.

He ties them down to tables and puts scorpions in jars on their bare stomachs to let them get stung.

They fall asleep and wake up in a foggy forest, looking for each other. The Sandman finds Abbie and flings sand in her eyes. He tells her she has been weighed on the scales of justice and been found wanting. She fires at him but the shots do nothing to it.

Ichabod finds a red door in the forest.

Abbie next finds herself in the interrogation with her sister from after they saw the demon.

Ichabod walks through the door and is in the police station. He sees Dr. Vega and Gillespie hanging from nooses in the hallway, a third empty one swings nearby.

The Sandman questions the sisters and again Abbie says she didn't see anything.

Adult Abbie is frozen in place as the Sandman sticks a long nail through the glass toward her face. Ichabod comes in and tells the Sandman to stop, but he turns on Ichabod and whacks off his hand, turning it to sand.

Abbie stops the attack by confessing what she saw that day and confronting the Sandman. She tells him she's not afraid anymore and won't desert her sister again.

The Sandman slowly turns to a kind of glass and is frozen in place, Abbie shatters him with a chair.

Later, in the archives, Abbie says she has some unfinished business to take care of. She's about to leave when Captain Irving comes in. He doesn't want to know the details of their investigation, just that it's closed.

Abbie visits Jenny at the mental hospital. The orderly takes Abbie to Jenny's room, but it's empty.

Abbie orders the building locked down. She finds a loose panel in the ceiling. ""She's good,"" Abbie says."

During the middle of the Boston Tea Party, Ichabod goes searching for something. Gen. Washington commanded they bring back a crate. When they confront a red coat for the crate, he recites an incantation in German and then blows himself up.

In present day Sleepy Hollow, Ichabod lovingly remembers his wife, who saved him and is somewhere between life and death herself. He talks passionately about her and the love that spans life and death and how rare it is. Then we realize he is telling this story to a roadside assistance representative, whom he has contacted remotely from the inside of the car. He leaves the woman from roadside assistance in tears and gives her the courage to go on.

He thanks her for unlocking the car.

He's waiting for Abbie outside the mental institution when Abbie comes out to report Jenny escaped.

Later, Abbie wants time to track Jenny down herself, but Captain Irving is hesitant. Abbie and Ichabod are sure Jenny is related to the Headless Horseman. He gives them 12 hours.

At a bar, Jenny settles in and Wendell the bartender pours her a shot and gets her her things. ""Remember when I told you, one day this town was going to go straight to Hell? I hate when I'm right,"" she says.

A German man gets a computerized voice call alerting him that Jenny has escaped and they believe she knows where ""item 37"" is. He's ordered to track it and her down.

Cut to the man showing up at the bar, where Wendell says he's never heard of Jenny Mills. When they threaten him, Wendell pulls a shogun on them. The German man easily disarms him and then begins the torture. After Wendell admits Jenny was there, the man skewers him.

Back at the station, Ichabod looks over Jenny's travels, including Mexico and Somalia. He wonders why Jenny would travel so far and come back to Sleepy Hollow.

He pesters Abbie for her family history. Their dad died when they were young, and their mom had a nervous breakdown. After the age of 12, Abbie had one foster home; Jenny had seven, but she stayed with the last family for over a year. Ichabod wants to talk to them.

In a truck strop bathroom, Abbie goves over her ""go bag,"" including a passport and two guns. She's ready for war.

Captain Irving reports to the murder scene at the bar. The bad guy cut off Wendell's head and skewered his body on the wall, but Irving knows it wasn't the work of the Horseman because the wounds weren't cauterized. Just the same, he wants to keep it quiet.

Abbie and Ichabod visit one of Jenny's foster mothers, who is cold and neglectful of the foster child she currently has. She tells Abbie that Jenny used to take off for Trout Lake.

Ichabod and Abbie head up to a lake cabin and break in. Ichabod is drawn to a Revolutionary War painting over the fireplace. Ichabod realizes the cabin belonged to Sheriff Corbin. He sees a picture of Corbin with Jenny and realizes they were close.

""You have no idea,"" Jenny says, stepping out and drawing a gun on them. Abbie draws on her sister and they stare each other down.

Abbie tells Jenny she's trying to make things right. The two sisters go after each other until Ichabod shouts them both down.

Jenny tells them she helped Sheriff Crane find rare objects, thus the world travels. She saw him the night before he died and he told her to come to the cabin if something happened to him, he had a bad feeling. She opens a secret panel in the cabin wall and takes out a sextant, for mapping sea travel. It comes with symbols branded into leather.

Ichabod recognizes the markings.

He explains that they went in for the weapon, creating the Boston Tea Party as a distraction. They just called it ""the destruction of the tea.""

The man guarding the weapon was a Hessian, a German mercenary loyal to the British crown.

Ichabod and his fellow soldiers were sent to claim a chest made of stone, covered in markings. He ferried it back to Washington, but never saw it again.

Ichabod demonstrates how the sextant works. There's a projector hidden inside that displays a map from Ichabod's era of Sleepy Hollow. They think it will lead them to the location of the mystery chest. Just then shots start coming through the windows.

The German and his men rain fire from semi-automatic weapons and one runs in and grabs the sextant. Two of them get away with it but Jenny pulls a gun on the German.

Jenny looks over the gun and says it's a military issue Uzi.

Ichabod checks him for tattoos and, in German, declares him Reinhessian, Shadow Warriors, 5th Battalion. The Hessian says the chest contains a doorway to the seventh circle of Hell where 72 condemned souls wait on a shore of flaming sand, from the Book of Revelation. Jenny recognizes that he's talking about the Lesser Key of Solomon.

It's a book of black magic, that is itself a key capable of unleashing the demons into their world.

The Hessian says they've been hiding in Sleepy Hollow. Captain Irving and a team head to the Hessian's house, following up Wendell's murder, and find all sort of body parts, skulls and weird bits in the basement.

Back with the German, he tells Abbie, Jenny and Ichabod that they've already met the man in charge. He knows all their names and describes the demon.

The Hessian says the demon summoned the Horseman and ""with each dark spirit he brings in to your world, his grand design gets stronger. He wants you to understand. My brothers have the map and soon the doorway will open and my task will be completed.""

He says something in German.

The man stops talking and chomps down on something in his mouth -- he chokes on a cyanide pill.

Ichabod translates his last words: ""Moloch shall rise.""

As Abbie and Jenny argue over whether to call the cops in or not, Ichabod starts drawing, recreating the map using his photographic memory.

The other two Hessians head to the church where the Key of Soloman is hidden.

On the drive there, Ichabod asks Jenny where she received her weapons training. Some in Mexico and other training in South Sudan where warlords were stealing food and women.

""I learned long ago that if you don't fight for the things you stand for, you don't really stand for them,"" Jenny says. Ichabod likes the argument, but Abbie is annoyed that he's impressed.

At the church, the Hessians find a book and one of them cuts his own hand to reveal hidden writing. It's written in Ars Goettia and says: ""The portal shall be opened, the key shall be turned, in the name of Moloch.""

As they recite the words, the baptismal font bubbles with flame and blood and demons start trying to break free from the ooze and flames.

The Mills sisters and Ichabod arrive and take on the men. One of the Hessians gets ahold of Abbie and tries to shove her into the teaming, screaming mass of demons, but Ichabod saves her. He picks up a knife and takes on the giant man.

Abbie picks up the book and one of the men gets Jenny in a headlock. He tells her to drop the book or Jenny dies. Jenny tells Abbie not to listen as Ichabod grapples with the other man.

Abbie heaves the book into the flames. Ichabod knocks out one man while Jenny gets the drop on the other. The book is swallowed up in the flames and the demons and everything suddenly recede.

Back at the station, Abbie explains to her sister that Ichabod thinks they're the two witnesses from Revelations. Jenny believes her, but isn't ready to forgive her yet.

""I can't take back what I did, but I can try to make it right,"" Abbie says. Abbie has filed paperwork to become her conservator and thinks she can get Jenny out of the mental institution in less than six months. She thinks they can work together to get answers.

""Corbin said one day you'd be back when you were ready. He asked me to find a way to try to forgive you. I said I didn't think I could,"" Jenny says.

""I'm sorry that it took me so long to find you,"" says Abbie.

Later, Ichabod finds Abbie and shows her a reference to Moloch in Paradise Lost. It's the demon she saw in the woods. Now they know who they're fighting."

Ichabod settles in to Sheriff Corbin's cabin, the perfect rustic home for him. Abbie suggests he spackle the bullet holes, and offers to tell him what ""spackle"" means. Abbie gets a call about the boy.

At the scene, Ichabod notices his old clothes and the fact his veins are turning black. The boy wakes up long enough to say something in Middle English.

Back at the station, Abbie reviews missing children reports. The boy said ""evil girl.""

Morales goes to Captain Irving to ask what Ichbod is still doing working with Abbie and Irving essentially tells him to butt out.

At the hospital, the boy is under full quarantine. Someone from the CDC sets Ichabod up with a video link to talk to the boy, whose name is Thomas.

Thomas apologizes for following the girl. He's from Roanoke. Ichabod wonders if he's from the lost colony, the first colony of the new world in North Carolina, 1587.

Back at Library HQ, Ichabod explains John White was the first colonist and had a daughter named Virginia, then returned to Europe to get supplies. When he returned three years later, every single person was gone. Ichabod suggests they've relocated to Sleepy Hollow.

Captain Irving calls -- the paramedic who treated Thomas has fallen ill. Abbie prevents Ichabod from sharing their theory with the captain just yet. They head to the woods where Thomas was found.

Meanwhile, in the hospital, the paramedic gets sicker and sees a horseman charging at him.

Morales' partner tries to encourage him to ease up on the Ichabod suspicion.

In the woods, Ichabod tracks Thomas' trail through the woods until they find a second set of prints.

At the hospital, more people who treated Thomas have fallen ill.

In the woods, Ichabod and Abbie reach a swamp with a tiny island in it. Ichabod tests the water and finds it's very deep, then he notices markings on a tree on the shore and one on the island and finds a hidden bridge. They walk across and into the lost colony of Roanoke. All of the townspeople are infected, but they don't seem sick.

One of the men explains that Roanoke was cursed by the Horseman of Pestilence. Virginia was the first to die and her spirit led the colonists there to protect them. The symptoms don't affect them there, but when Thomas left, he took the plague to the outside world, as the Horseman wanted all along. They must return Thomas to save them all.

Pestilence is also known as Conquest and if they don't return Thomas and allow the disease to spread, Pestilence will arrive in Sleepy Hollow. Abbie looks out among the trees and thinks she sees a figure on a horse.

Back at the hospital, the disease is spreading to CDC workers. Crane looks at his own veins and realizes he's also infected from when he first saw Thomas. The CDC workers inject him with something to knock him out.

While he's unconscious, he sees Katia. She hasn't been able to summon him for some time, and thinks the fact she can see him now means he's dead.

Morales gets a call back from Oxford, confirming Ichabod is a professor there and on sabbatical in Sleepy Hollow.

Katia explains she's trapped in purgatory with lost souls.

At the hospital, Abbie tries to convince Irving to let her take Ichabod and Thomas, but he orders her to help shut down streets instead.

Ichabod asks Katia why Moloch wants her soul.

Abbie ducks into the hospital chapel, to ask for a sign that taking Ichabod and Thomas back to Roanoke is the right thing to do. She notices the holy water on her way out and remembers Ichabod noting that something in the Roanoke environment was a cure and there was a spring in the center of town.

Katia is about to tell Ichabod why she's trapped in purgatory when he snaps back to consciousness. Abbie tells Irving her theory about the Roanoke water. He sets up a transfer of Thomas and Ichabod to an overflow facility and covers for Abbie to take them to Roanoke.

They trudge back through the woods as Thomas gets sicker and sicker. Pestilence the Horseman rides nearby.

They make it to the colony with the Horseman on their heels. Ichabod jumps into the spring with Thomas as the Horseman charges. The Horseman dissipates before he reaches them.

Suddenly, Abbie and Ichabod aren't in the middle of a colony anymore, but back in an empty forest. Ichabod realizes Thomas was dead all along. He was lured into the land of the living to spread a plague, but Abbie's faith that she was one of the witnesses allowed her to solve the puzzle.

Irving calls Abbie to tell her all the sick people are recovering.

Abbie tells Ichabod he belongs in Sleepy Hollow, in the here and now."

Abbie commends the effort but suggests next time he wait for the ump to make a call.

After the game, Ichabod heads to his wife's grave. As he's sitting there, he's hit in the neck by a dart and a man in a suit comes to put a hood over his head.

Abbie is driving on the road at night when suddenly things go hazy and she sees herself in an old house with a creepy baby carriage wheeling through. Abbie follows the sounds of the crying and finds it empty, with an old time toy in it. She turns around to see the Headless Horseman behind her. He stalks her through the house until she enters a room and slams the door behind her.

She sees hooded figures in black, holding hands and chanting around a table. There are candles lit everywhere. Abbie turns to see Katrina Crane. She explains the house is a doorway between worlds she can use to communicate with the two witnesses -- and Ichabod has been abducted.

The Horseman will return to Sleepy Hollow by nightfall and only the witnesses can stop him. She can't locate Ichabod because some sort of barrier is blocking her. She explains Abbie has to find the ""sin eater"" before nightfall to sanctify Ichabod, which will separate his blood from the Horseman, with whose fate he's become entwined.

Abbie returns back to her world just in time to veer out of the oncoming path of a semi.

Abbie goes to Captain Irving and tries to explain her visit from the witch and Ichabod's disappearance. Irving is skeptical, but supportive.

Abbie goes to see her sister Jenny to ask her if she knows about the sin eater.

Ichabod comes to somewhere, still woozy. He sees candles all around him and a man in a suit addresses him. He has a book which he says is the true account of Ichabod Crane. The man isn't inclined to say who he is, but Ichabod sees his ""JR"" cufflinks and deduces he's James Rutledge, the descendant of Edward Rutledge, youngest signatory of the Declaration of Independence, who he apparently resembles. He notices a square ring mark on Rutledge's finger and signs of hexes around him. He's a Free Mason, like Ichabod. But Rutledge wants him to prove his identity, he says they're dealing with shape shifters and demons.

He quizzes Ichabod on when he first heard a phrase. Ichabod remembers when he was in service for the British and charged with interrogating a free black man about the origin of a pamphlet advocating the end to slavery. Ichabod a told a Quaker nurse wishes to see him. He meets Katrina, who questions his authority. The man he's supposed to interrogate says he's in good hands and Katrina thinks she sees a conscience in Ichabod.

Back in Sleepy Hollow, Jenny explains a Sin Eater reaches inside your soul and swallows your sins. She followed a man who was meeting with death row inmates whose last words were all ""I am sanctified."" But she never found him.

Back in the 1800s, Arthur Bernard tells Ichabod that there are demons among them.

After three days of interrogation, Ichabod was called away to stand guard at an execution of three men. Katrina was in the audience. Crane appeals to his superior that the hangings are not a good way to win loyalty. When Crane looks at him, he sees a demon's face.

Ichabod goes to talk to Katrina after the hanging, saying he feels like he's known her for a long time. He mentions the demon. ""They were right, you are the one! You possess a gift, the power to bear witness,"" she tells him. She urges him not to stand idly by in the face of evil.

Back in Sleepy Hollow, Abbie explains that Ichabod makes her feel like she has a purpose. Jenny suggests Katrina could have been more specific since her husband's about to be a dead man.

Abbie realizes the name they're looking for in the prison visitor logs is of a dead man -- their mystery man takes on the name of dead death row inmates. She finds the last one he used -- he's in Hartford, Connecticut.

Jenny and Abbie go to his house and knock on Henry Parrish's door. She says her friend is missing and she needs his help, but he says he doesn't do it anymore. He explains how much seeing people's true souls has worn him down. Abbie explains the blood tie linking Ichabod's spirit to the Horseman from Revelations.

He says he could use her connection to Ichabod to find him. When he protests, she grabs him and he sees that Ichabod is underground, behind a door with a Free Masons symbol on it. That's all he can tell her.

Abbie heads to the tunnels under the town.

When Crane returns to Alfred Bernard's house, his captain tells him to take Bernard into the forest and kill him. Out in the woods, Bernard tells Ichabod he's valuable to the case and if Ichabod kills him he'll carry sin inside his heart forever.

Ichabod fires, but misses intentionally. Bernard tells Ichabod to find Katrina, who will lead him to General Washington. He tells Ichabod to tell her ""order from chaos"" and she'll know what side he's on. Bernard is walking away when a shot is fired. His captain has shot him. He charges Ichabod, calling him a traitor.

Ichabod draws his sword to fight and sees the man turn into a demon. He's attacking when two other soldiers ride up and the demon runs off.

Ichabod is wounded and makes his was to Katrina.

Back with Rutledge, Ichabod explains his sin was not acting sooner to save Bernard. This is enough for Rutledge to be convinced of his identity. The book with the account of that story that Rutledge has was written by Katrina. She was the Masons ally until she saved Ichabod and wouldn't tell the Masons where he was. ""She knew the inevitable outcome of your tie to the Horseman. Regretfully, a fate we would have sealed for you long ago, and one we have no choice but to seal it for you now,"" Rutledge says.

He presents Crane with a box, saying it's the only way to ensure the Horseman's reign ends forever.

Abbie and Jenny search the tunnels and find the Free Masons symbol. Two men with guns find her, but they take her peacefully inside to see Crane. He tells her that he has to die to end the Horseman, but she updates him on Katrina's message and the Sin Eater. She wants to bring Ichabod to him, but he doesn't think there's time. He thinks it's the only way, and explains he's living on borrowed time. He's grateful to have met her. He takes her hand and prepares to drink whatever the Masons prepared for him. He drinks.

He hears Abbie and Katrina telling him ""stay with me!"" and sees Henry Parrish standing over him. He excited to meet Ichabod, to find the reason for the gift he was given. He can remove the poison before it stops Ichabod's heart, along with his sins.

He stabs Ichabod's hand the tastes his blood. He sees the Horseman in Ichabod's memories. ""As long as you carry your sin in your heart, it allows the Horseman to be tied to you,"" Parrish says. He commands Ichabod to think about Arthur Bernard and summon him. When Ichabod opens his eyes he sees Bernard sitting across from him. Ichabod feels remorse that he couldn't save him, but Bernard asks if Ichabod would have found his true path if he hadn't died. Bernard's death saved Ichabod's soul, only Ichabod chose to see it as a sin. Bernard tells him to forgive himself and his blood tie to the Horseman will be broken. He tells Ichabod he will have help in his quest to vanquish the Horseman. He gives him words to repeat to banish the Horseman from his blood.

In front of him, the blood on the table moves and Parrish mops up a dab of it with bread and eats it. The room quakes and Ichabod can feel the tie is broken.

Abbie tells him not to pull a stunt like that again.

Night has fallen. Parrish can feel the Horseman is coming. ""We'll be ready,"" Ichabod says.

Out in the forest, the Horseman finds the dirt pit where Ichabod was buried."

Abbie thinks it's a good time to teach Ichabod about the fist bump.

They confer with Captain Irving, who marvels that Thomas Jefferson designed the chamber they're using. ""He foresaw holding the worst kind of demons who walk the earth -- a product, no doubt, of his years spent trying to reason with the French,"" Ichabod says.

Ichabod suggests they interrogate the Horseman using Andy Brooks. Abbie asks Irving to tell her sister what's going on.

Out in the woods, two hunters come upon the Horseman's white horse, with its firey red demon eyes. One of the riders dials his phone to report something has happened to the rider. He seems to be speaking German. He shoots his companion.

Ichabod and Abbie search for Andy in the tunnels and find where he's been bunking, but he's not there.

Irving has a surly Jenny Mills brought to the station and gives her the good news about the captured Horseman. Irving is interrupted by word there's a situation at Adams Antiquities. Jenny knows the place, she once did ""acquisitions"" for the owner. Irving checks whether she's on board, she is.

Ichabod finds Egyptian hieroglyphs in Andy's hideout, he realizes they mean Andy is the Horseman's necromancer -- person to speak for the dead. When Andy returns, Ichabod suggests bringing Andy with them to the cell to interrogate the Horseman. Andy doesn't want to, and explains that his soul doesn't belong to him anymore, so if Moloch commands him to do something, he has no choice. He warns them about the darkness in confronting death.

At the antiquities shop, none of the valuable stuff is missing. Jenny shows Irving a secret room where the owner hid his best stuff. They find Adams shot inside, but alive. He directs them to a box with 16th century Druidic scripture. It contained an item that could be used to break a hex spell -- like the one protecting the Horseman's cell. It was stolen by Hessians, who speak German.

They think the Hessians will take out the power next to kill the UV lights helping to hold the Horseman.

Ichabod and Abbie take Andy into the Masonic cell. Ichabod taunts the Horseman to get him to talk. When he gets close, a necklace falls out of the Horseman's scarf. Ichabod recognizes it as Katrina's.

It was given to her by her former fiancé, Abraham Van Brunt, Ichabod's former best friend.

Flash back to Ichabod counseling Abraham about which necklace to buy for her, advising the emerald instead of something more showy. She loves it and Abraham takes credit, but she knows Ichabod picked it.

Privately, she tells Ichabod she's breaking off her engagement, which was arranged, because she loves him.

Back in the cell, Ichabod wants to know if the necklace means the Horseman knows where Moloch holds Katrina.

Irving and Jenny go to the power station and see men with guns. Irving goes to investigate. One of the men comes up behind him, but he quickly disarms him. When he finds Jenny, she has two more in cuffs. SWAT comes out and helps them get the rest.

Jenny notices something missing from the Hessian's truck, and they find evidence of a bomb.

In the cell, the Horseman says he knows Katrina's fate, but won't tell yet. Ichabod thinks the Horseman is following him personally. The Horseman says Ichabod was his mission, after Ichabod betrayed and killed his former partner: Abraham.

There's an explosion at the power plant and the UV lights cut out in the cell, but the Horseman is still held by the spell.

The Horseman begins to grow stronger and Ichabod wants to keep questioning him. He insists to Abbie that he didn't kill Abraham.

Pennsylvania 1774 The day after Katrina broke off her engagement to Abraham, he and Ichabod were charged with transporting the Declaration of Resolve -- a precursor to the Declaration of Independence -- to the Continental Congress.

As they walked through enemy territory, Abraham's mind was elsewhere. Ichabod tried to tell him there were many other women who would have him, then told him that he was in love with Katrina. Abraham got angry and drew his sword to fight and would not accept Ichabod's attempts to yield to him. Finally, Ichabod fought back, only to end up on the ground. Then a shot rang out and Abraham was hit by a man in a mask with a heptagram tattoo like the Horseman. Other Hessians like him ran out and Ichabod killed as many as he could, trying to help his mortally wounded friend. But Abraham yelled at him to leave and the last thing Ichabod saw was the men drawing their swords over Abraham as he lay on the ground bleeding.

Back in the cell, Abbie suggests Ichabod take a break since the Horseman is getting to him.

Irving arrives with Jenny. They're still looking for the item the Hessians will use to break the hex, but first they'd have to break into the cell to perform the Druidic incantation.

Abbie, Jenny and Irving leave to get weapons to defend the cell, leaving Ichabod alone with the Horseman. Abbie cautions him not to lose his cool.

Chained to his chair in the cell, Andy pulls the Druidic item from inside his body and begins the incantation to summon the minions of Moloch. Demons begin stalking Abbie and Irving in the tunnels. They scale the walls and shatter when fired upon.

Ichabod talks to the Horseman again, accusing him of betraying his master to pursue him. Ichabod sees that Andy has the item and he finishes the incantation, freeing the Horseman. The Horseman gets a sword and gives another to Ichabod, who engages him.

From his moves, Ichabod realizes who he's fighting: Abraham.

The Horseman tells Ichabod that he, Abraham died, then Moloch came to him. They shaved his head, put a mask on him and he became one of the Hessians, complete with the brand on his hand. Abraham made a deal with the devil to get what he always wanted: Katrina.

Ichabod realizes she's being held captive for the Horseman.

Andy recites one more incantation and the minions come running, right as the Horseman gets the better of Ichabod. ""Stop! You can't kill him, the master forbids it!"" Andy tells the Horseman as he's about to stab Ichabod. ""Tell Abby I'm sorry,"" Andy says, as the minions take him and the Horseman away. Ichabod is left alone.

Later, Ichabod feels responsible for Abraham becoming the Horseman. He wonders why Moloch spared him from the Horseman. The Horseman said Katrina's soul ""will"" be his, so they hope she's being held until he rides with the other Horsemen. Katrina is the Horseman's weakness. ""Now more than ever, we need Katrina,"" Ichabod says."

She plans to fix it up. Her bodyguard, Sam, thinks it looks haunted.

She explores inside and finds a closet fill of vines. She starts grabbing at them but they grab back. She screams.

At the station, Ichabod doubts the Scottish origins of the fast food they're eating. He sets Abbie straight on Thanksgiving. The pilgrims didn't have any sugar to make sauce or pie, and they had venison, not turkey. All the family time irks Ichabod, he misses his wife.

Captain Irving calls them in about the socialite Lena Gilbert, whose lineage goes back to the founding fathers. She's missing. Irving is giving them the case because Lena left a note with ""Katrina C."" written on it and her last GPS coordinates were Sleepy Hollow.

Ichabod wants to know about Gilberts from his era who owned land. Lena's mother was a Fredericks, dating back to Lachlan Federicks, a charter member of the Continental Congress and a friend of Ichabod's.

Ichabod knows the mansion. They drive there. It hasn't been lived in for more than a few weeks at a time since the time of Lachlan Fredericks. But it looks much different to Ichabod.

Flashback His estate was a safe haven, guaranteeing protection to former slaves, many of whom stayed to work for Lachlan.

Ichabod and Abbie go inside. They see the back of a man in a chair, but soon find that he's dead. It's Sam the bodyguard and his face is badly bloodied and scratched. Ichabod sees bloody hand prints on the floor. They think Lena might still be alive.

Abbie tires to radio in, but can't get a signal. When she goes for the door, it slams shut. They try the windows and one by one all the windows and doors in the house slam shut. ""Not to be an alarmist,"" Ichabod says. ""But we are in a damn haunted house,"" Abbie says.

Abbie freaks out a little but Ichabod presumes the house wants something from them. They decide to find Lena. Abbie sees a woman walk past and then disappear.

Ichabod sees a familiar book on the floor. It belonged to Katrina. It contains a letter he wrote before he went to confront the Horseman and it was only to be given to her if he died. Ichabod doesn't understand how it could have ended up in the house.

Ichabod remembers the house as a force for good.

Flashback to Ichabod and Katrina meeting Lachlan Fredericks and the mistress of the house, Grace Dixon, who is African-American. Ichabod supposes the house was also a refuge from the supernatural. They wonder if one of those evil forces is now occupying the house and taking its anger toward Lachlan out on Lena, his descendant.

Ichabod and Abbie head down some creepy stairs and find Lena alive and wrapped in vines in the closet. Ichabod starts to cut her free and one of the vines bleeds.

Outside, a creature made entirely of roots rises from the ground and walks toward the house.

Ichabod and Abbie cut Lena free as she explains to them that the house is alive.

Back at the station, Irving is annoyed he can't reach them. Jenny is there to return the guns she lifted from him to defeat the Horseman. Jenny tells Irving she's planning a small Thanksgiving and invites him.

Irving's ex-wife Cynthia and his young daughter Macy, who is in a wheelchair, arrive.

Back at the house it's now nightfall. Lena explains she saw Katrina Crane's name in a ledger and thought it could lead her to answers about the house and Lachlan. There are rumors he was involved in witchcraft. Ichabod wanders if Lachlan and Katrina were members of the same coven.

Their conversation is interrupted by something very large coming at them. They run for cover and find a secret passageway into the walls. Abbie gets separated from Ichabod and Lena and the root monster catches up with them.

Ichabod and Lena run from it and run into a flock of crows in the stairway.

Abbie is alone in the walls and tries to keep it together. She kicks her way through a wall and then senses someone behind her. She turns around to see the ghost of Grace, who tells her ""it's time,"" then disappears.

Back at the station, Macy wheels through like she owns the place and bumps into Jenny. She thinks Jenny is dating her dad, but Jenny explains she doesn't even like him half the time, but she suggests Macy give him a chance.

Cynthia isn't happy with Frank for canceling weekends he's suppose to spend with Macy. He can't really tell her about how he's helping stave off the apocalypse. She tells him Macy needs stability and if he cancels one more time, she'll file for full custody.

Back in the house, Grace warns, ""It's coming, hurry.""

Abbie sees a scene from the past, Katrina in bed -- in labor. Grace helps Katrina deliver her baby boy.

Abbie is stunned. She goes searching for Ichabod and finds him. He tells her the creature dragged Lena away.

Abbie tells him what she just saw. ""Katrina came back here because she was going to have a baby,"" she says. The protective hex on the property would have kept them safe.

But Abbie says there's more. During the birth, crows started attacking and the root creature rose up. Lachlan knew it was sent by Moloch and he went to confront it, but the creature attacked and killed him.

Abbie didn't see what happened to his son. They hear Lena scream. They find the creature grabbing on to her, choking her. In the dark, they can't see the creature to fight back, but then Ichabod tells Abbie to shoot the roots, which wounds the creature. He releases Lena.

Abbie sees Grace again, guiding them to an exit.

They make it outside to the car, where Ichabod grabs an ax. He heads back inside to take on the thing that came after his son. He warns Abbie not to follow him.

Inside, Ichabod looks around for the creature, using road flares to light the room. He finds the creature and swings at it, telling it he knows who it serves. ""You think you can attack those I love without consequence?"" Ichabod says as he attacks wildly.

He hacks at the creature, finally chopping it to death. ""Give Moloch my regards,"" he says.

He goes outside covered in blood, and ready to go home.

Abbie comes to the archives to get Ichabod for Thanksgiving. She brought rum. He's struggling with the knowledge he had a son. There's a package from Lena (Ichabod wonders if it's more treasures from the Amazon), that contains all her family's old papers, including from Grace Dixon. It includes Grace's family tree, down to Lori Roberts -- Abbie's mother. Her ancestor brought Ichabod's son into the world.

They toast to finding family."

His head is swimming with questions about the son he just learned he had and never got to meet. He especially wants to know why his wife didn't tell him she was pregnant.

He wants to contact Katrina. He reached out to the only man he knows who might be able to help. Henry Parrish, the sin eater who helped separate Ichabod's blood from the Horseman's, pulls up in a taxi.

Inside, Parrish isn't sure how he can help. He's never tried that kind of contact before. He warns Ichabod that his life would be in danger if Ichabod goes into the other realm to talk to her and he'll be tempting fate.

Ichabod thinks not doing it is a far worse risk. Finally, Henry cautions Abbie that what he's about to do will be scary and she can't interrupt.

Henry urges Ichabod to think of Katrina, then he starts strangling him. ""I told you, the closer he is to death, the shorter distance there is to travel,"" Henry says.

Ichabod gets woozy and sees himself in a church. There's a baby carriage with a doll inside. He sees Katrina and cuts right to the chase. The baby was named Jeremy, after Ichabod's grandfather. She didn't know she was pregnant when she buried him, and neither did her coven when they punished her for doing so. She learned of her condition in Europe in search of a spell to unbind him from the Horseman. When she returned, her coven persecuted her, so she sought refuge at the house of Lachlan Fredericks. She knew her coven would be after him if they knew about him so she left him with Grace (Abbie's ancestor) and her husband, a pastor, with the doll she made for him, promising it would protect her.

That was the last time she saw him, in the church like the one they're standing it. It's in her purgatory, where her coven banished her, and she lights a candle for him once a day.

She apologizes and he promises he'll find out what happened to him and get her out of purgatory. Suddenly, there's a pounding on the door. Katrina urges him to return to his realm as a creature busts through the door.

Ichabod wakes up on the cabin floor and tells Abbie what he's learned.

Somewhere out in the woods, the same faceless monster digs its way out of the earth.

Back in the cabin, Abbie suggests they check the library's historical records. Henry is in a hurry to get to his train, but Ichabod and Abbie ask him to stay. He agrees. The creature watches them drive off.

In New York, Frank Irving meets with his pastor, asking him about a sermon he once gave about two witnesses. The pastor explains that the New Testament says ""witness"" mean martyr, and that the two are destined to die. The apostles that follow them usually suffer the same fate. Irving is frustrated, thinking he's given enough in his public service and having his daughter get hit by a car. He wonders, if God has a plan, who is it for?

At the library, after sweet talking the librarian, they find a record that mentions Grace dying young in a fire. The record says the townspeople were afraid of Jeremy, they had seen him start fires, just by crying. He inherited Katrina's powers. He survived the fire unharmed, but Grace and Joseph died.

The record says only that Jeremy was sent to an orphanage for children of the war. Henry suggests the librarian Ms. Hudson knows more than she's saying -- lying is a sin and he can sense it.

They go to look for her. She's in her car outside when the creature reaches through her window.

They come outside and find Ms. Hudson crushed inside her flattened car.

Frank picks up his daughter Macy from his ex-wife Cynthia. He tells her he's sorry he was gone so much. She says if he'd said that a year ago, he'd still be living there. Macy hears them.

Back in the archives, they go through the librarian's effects. Ichabod explains his struggles with the way language has changed. In his day ""intercourse"" meant conversation and ""awful"" meant ""awe inspiring.""

""So if I went out with a guy and we had 'awful intercourse,' we'd be going on a second date?"" Abbie asks.

""Disconcerting, yet accurate,"" Ichabod says.

Abbie takes out a box and when she sets it on the table, it sends a shiver through Henry. He says it's filled with pain. It bears the symbol for Katrina's coven, the Sisterhood of the Radiant Heart. The librarian was a witch, which explains her odd reaction to Ichabod -- she knew who he was.

Ichabod opens the box, and Henry says it reeks of death and pain. There's a drawing of Katrina's handmade doll for Jeremy inside.

Abbie saw the same doll in her vision of Katrina. Henry touches it and tells Ichabod, he thinks the misery inside was Jeremy's.

Henry has a vision of Jeremy being whipped in the orphanage by the priest. Jeremy bled on to the doll his mother made him and called upon her promise to protect him, creating the creature out of his rage and pain. The creature looks like a giant muscle-bound version of the hand-stitched doll. In the vision, it attacks the vicious priest and snaps his neck, then bows to Jeremy.

Ichabod realizes that's what he saw in the church with Katrina, and he thought he felt it again in the woods at the cabin. It followed Ichabod back.

They think it attacked Ms. Hudson because she was a member of the coven who banished Jeremy's mother.

Frank takes a walk with his daughter in the park. He stops to get her a hot chocolate when the vendor's eyes gloss over and he tells him that God may have a plan for him but ""we"" have a plan for him, too. Frank grabs the guy, but the demon spirit transfers to a woman walking by. Two cops see him shaking up a confused hot chocolate vendor. He shows his badge, but his daughter is still weirded out.

Henry finds Ichabod feeling guilty about bringing his son's rage into the world, then and now. ""Whatever became of your son, you speak for him now,"" Henry says. He thinks Jeremy was good because he was molded from Ichabod's clay.

The phrase reminds Ichabod of Washington's Bible, which Katrina buried with him. He runs to look up a passage and realizes they're dealing with a golem, a creature made from mud and imbued with its creator's passions.

Abbie remembers seeing four women in black veils, like ones the librarian has ticket stubs from visiting at carnivals. They're members of the same coven, which means the Golem is after them. They're the ones who banished Katrina, which Ichabod thinks means they could bring her back.

They find a ticket stub for a carnival outside town. When they reach it, Ichabod insists on going to speak to the ""Four Who Speak as One"" alone, given what they did to his wife.

Inside, one looks at his palm and they lift their black veils to reveal weird colored eyes and dirty, jagged teeth. They tell him it was foretold that his arrival would seal their fate. ""Tonight we die,"" they say.

They don't see any point trying to avoid their destiny, the Katrina did in saving Ichabod. He tells them the Golem is coming. They know it, and tell him that people hunted Jeremy and Golem centuries ago. They were able to send the creature to purgatory, but Jeremy's powers were too great. Instead, they stopped his heart and buried him. They tell him only his son's blood, which gave the golem life, can kill it.

Ichabod leaves the witches and rejoins Abbie just as the golem attacks the witches. Abbie and Henry try to take refuge, but the golem shatters a funhouse mirror. A shard hits Ichabod and Henry suggests Ichabod's blood is the same as Henry's and he can stop it.

Ichabod approaches the golem with the shard and tries to tell it it doesn't have to fight anymore, and that it only exists because he wasn't around. But when the golem charges, Ichabod has no choice but to stab it with the glass shard. Ichabod takes its hand as it lies on the ground and tells it he can move on from his life of pain. Ichabod calls it, ""my son."" The golem dies and only the doll is left.

Back at the station, Henry is ready to leave for his train. They thank him for his help.

Abbie gives Ichabod his present early: a stocking with his name on it. ""You embroidered my name on some oversized hosiery,"" he marvels. She explains it's tradition.

When Abbie leaves, Ichabod sees a mirror crack in front of him. It mends and suddenly Ichabod sees himself in the dark woods with Moloch's voice taunting him. ""I offer this warning: the saint's name is a sign. When you know my name, more will take form, then the end of days begins. Your death is assured, you and the second witness....I touched her soul once, soon it will be mine forever, and you will give it to me.""

Ichabod wakes up on the station floor. Abbie finds him. ""Moloch is coming for your soul, he says I will deliver it to him,"" Ichabod says."

He's vexed by Molloch's message about a saint's name and the fear Molloch was able to instill in him. Abbie thinks it's a fool's errand just to keep them busy since they're disrupting Molloch's overall plan.

Ichabod refuses her next costume change and comes back out in his musty old clothes.

At the station, Captain Irving watches as the man who threatened him in the park takes and passes a polygraph. He wants the woman the man bumped into in the park brought in.

When she reaches the station, the demon inside transfers to a cop passing by.

Irving gets a call from inside the station. A demon voice tells him to get Washington's Bible from Ichabod, and Iriving sees a vision of the word Bible dripping in blood. He has until tonight or they come after his daughter. Irving walks into his precinct to see who is on the phone and spots the possessed deputy. He draws his gun and grabs the man, but not before the demon is able to transfer to Detective Jones.

Frank calls his priest, who offers to meet him somewhere safe.

Ichabod and Abbie explain the Bible to Irving, saying that Katrina told them it was important but they're still not sure why.

Abbie finds a DVD in Sheriff Corbin's things that his notes describe as containing a demon who could jump from person to person. On the DVD, Corbin is filming himself at his cabin and explains he has a 19 year old woman who appears possessed. It's Jenny, Abbie's sister.

Later, they tell Jenny about the DVD. They haven't watched it yet, and ask her permission, explaining they need to know how to defeat the demon.

The three of them watch it. Possessed Jenny says Jenny has been ""marked"" and chosen as a ""vessel."" ""War will come, and you will be among its first casualties. You, August Corbin, will die at the hands of the Horseman of Death. And I will kill the sister. I will kill Abbie,"" it says.

Jenny says the demon has been gone for a long time, but she doesn't know how. She leaves.

Frank brings his ex-wife and daughter to a cabin in the woods. The demon transfers from Jones to Luke Morales.

Back in town, Ichabod joins Jenny in her car out front. She tells him the possession started not long after they saw Molloch in the woods. She would lose time and people would tell her about terrible things she'd done. After the demon left, she didn't trust herself so she would break a law to get locked up whenever she had thoughts about hurting Abbie.

At the cabin, the priest lays salt at the door threshold and blesses it with holy water. The demon in Morales can't enter. Jones finds it odd, so Morales suggests he move the salt. When Jones wipes it away, Morales grabs him and breaks his back, then walks in the house.

Back in the archives, Ichabod notices on the DVD that Jenny was in a circle of salt. They play the demon's audio backwards and Ichabod recognizes it as ancient Aramaic, saying: ""Ancitif cannot be defeated.""

They find reference to Ancitif in a book, depicting French lanterns being used to expel the demon. Ichabod recognizes it as one of several given to Benjamin Franklin on one of his voyages overseas as ambassador. Jenny recognizes it from somewhere else.

At the cabin, Morales stands watch over Macy's room. Cynthia wants to know more about the threat, but Frank doesn't want to worry her.

Abbie calls Frank with an update, he steps outside. Morales calls Frank, but it's the demon telling him his time is up. Frank races back in the house and runs into Macy's room to see her suspended in the air, possessed.

Jenny leads Abbie and Ichabod to the home of some survivalists she got the lantern for a few years ago. She knows they're heavily armed, so she suggests they steal the lantern. Abbie worries about Jenny getting caught and getting locked up again, so Abbie will steal it instead.

At the cabin, the priest tries to expel Ancitif, but his words have no effect. The demon in Macy grabs the priest and easily snaps his neck around. Ancitif demands Frank take him to the Bible. He lets Cynthia in and threatens to kill her if he doesn't.

Frank calls Abbie and asks if the Bible is still in the archives. They realize the demon must already be there and would use a host that would provide the most motivation -- Macy.

Jenny hangs back while Ichabod and Abbie sneak up on the compound and break into a barn full of supplies and relics. They find the lantern and come out of the barn, but are totally surrounded by armed survivalists.

Abbie tries to explain a child's life is at stake. When the leader quotes a verse, Crane recognizes it and tells them the war between good and evil has resumed. The survivalists are unmoved. But then Jenny appears, heavily armed. They recognize her. She gives her word they'll bring the lantern back, and the survivalists let them go.

At the archives, Frank finds the hiding place for the Bible is empty. Cynthia struggles to understand why their daughter is distorted and not herself.

Frank tries to reach through to his daughter, telling her she's strong and doesn't need fixing. The demon regains control and Ancitif throws Frank across the room.

Jenny and Abbie arrive. The demon speaks to Jenny, encouraging her to kill Abbie.

Jenny taunts Ancitif to approach her, until he's stopped by a line of salt. Ichabod pours another line behind him and comes out with the lantern.

Ancitif starts to lose hold, but shouts: ""Our plan is in motion, the witnesses can't stop it. Darkness will reign!""

Ichabod commands Ancitif back to hell and the demon flies out of Macy and into the lantern.

Macy looks up at her parents, who rush to her side.

Jenny is overwhelmed by reliving her torment again. Abbie goes to her sister and hugs her.

Back at the cabin, they retrieve the Bible where they hid it, in case Irving was tempted to turn it over.

Ichabod mixes up lemon juice and other ingredients to try to reveal invisible ink on the Bible. It says: December 18, 1799. Ichabod recognizes it as Washington's handwriting, but he supposedly died December 14, 1799. How could he have written it four days after he died? Ichabod resolves to find out."

He texts back, clumsily.

Abbie senses something in her kitchen and wheels around to see her dead colleague Andy waiting for her.

At the cabin, Ichabod tries to figure out the significance of December 18, 1799.

Ichabod remembers back to sharing a drink with General Washington, who told Ichabod he would be called upon to continue the fight in the future. ""Good will always rise, like Lazarus from his grave,"" Washington said.

Ichabod flips to a passage in Lazarus and finds something that means something to him.

Back at Abbie's, Andy tells her Moloch wants the Bible for directions it contains to something. Andy says if Abbie gives him the map, she will be spared in Moloch's new world order.

""Please don't risk your life to save Ichabod Crane. Crane will give your soul to Moloch, it is prophesied,"" Andy tells her.

Abbie remembers Ichabod having a vision that said the same thing. Andy, the rotting dead guy, tells her that no one loves her like he does. When Abbie turns her back, Andy breaks his dead fingers to escape her cuffs and sneaks off.

Abbie joins Ichabod in the archives. She tells him to answer his phone when she calls. He complains that it's an out of date flip phone. He goes on a mini-diatribe about the constant ads about upgrades being an abuse of capitalism, but he still wants a smart phone.

She agrees to let him borrow her phone for a few days and get him one just like it if he likes it.

She tells him about Andy's message, and that she was a little unnerved how Andy mentioned everyone else in her life leaving her.

Ichabod points out his find -- an extra 10 verses in Lazarus. He uses his solution to reveal the invisible ink.

The message is dated December 18, 1799 and is from Washington to Ichabod. ""Dear Sir, if you are reading this now then the war has resumed and your destiny to bear witness made manifest. Four days ago I was diagnosed by Dr. William Thorton with a fatal case of croup. As the end came, I drafted a plan. I asked that my body be kept in state, preserved by Virginia's natural winter air so that supernatural forces might aid me in a final mission. Four days ago, I died, but through the cursed prayer beads of these occult forces, I was resurrected....""

He goes on to explain that because he existed between the worlds of the living and dead, he was able to draft Ichabod a map from earth to purgatory. Ichabod realizes that with the map, he can free his wife Katrina from purgatory.

Abbie reminds him that defeating Moloch is the primary goal, which he knows.

There's a list of names that participated in the resurrection in the Bible, including Rev. Alfred Knapp, who until recently lived in Sleepy Hollow and protected the Horseman's head. His prayer beads used in the resurrection would be full of sin from the ungodly act of resurrection. Ichabod suggests they call Henry Parrish, the sin eater, to see what he can tell from the bead's history, possibly information on the map.

Captain Irving sits in an interview with Tom about the threat to his wife and daughter that lead to the death of a detective and a priest. All he can offer is that ""evil"" was responsible.

Down in the tunnels, Andy pleads to Moloch to make him a warrior in his fight, but Moloch scoffs at him. Then he sends hundreds of tiny insects which spin a web of sorts around Andy, mummifying him.

Later, Parrish meets up with Ichabod and Abbie in a cemetery. Rev. Knapp was buried with his beads wrapped around his neck, at his request. They dig up his body and Parrish can feel that the beads were used for something unnatural. The beads burn Parrish when he touches them, there's a hex on the beads. He doesn't care about the pain, he thinks it's important for the war against Moloch.

He grabs the beads again but is knocked to his feet after a moment. He saw Washington come to life and a map and Knapp in a boat along a shoreline, carrying something.

The pain to Henry makes Abbie question their current course. She wonders if during the time Ichabod was in the ground, the plan changed, and maybe entering Purgatory now will have serious consequences, like bringing about Armageddon.

Abbie asks Ichabod again if it comes down to it, can he sacrifice Katrina for the greater good.

Henry looks at his hand and it starts to heal, but a demon runs out of the dark and attacks him. Abbie and Ichabod fed off the scampering all black, hairless, long nailed demon.

Back at the archives, Parrish says something about a grave, which reminds Ichabod that Washington was a Mason and Masons were taught to take things to their grave. They think the reverend buried the map with Washington.

There are two Washington grave sites, one at Mt. Vernon and a tomb at the capital that has never been used. Ichabod thinks Washington would have wanted to be buried near Sleepy Hollow.

Parrish remembers seeing Knapp on a boat near a shoreline transporting something -- a body. There are 21 islands along the Hudson River. ""We find Washington's grave -- his real grave -- and we shall find the map buried along with him,"" Ichabod says.

Down in the tunnels, mummified Andy is reborn as a slimy, creepy, oblong-headed demon. He announces himself as Moloch's servant and swears that his enemies shall fall.

Abbie, Parrish, and Ichabod head to an island that was used as a penal colony. Ichabod is annoyed his smart phone map won't update, but he is still getting Abbie's Facebook updates.

Abbie brought maps from the archives, but Ichabod thinks his Mason's tricks will help him locate it.

Abbie checks again that they're going to discuss how to best use the map once they find it.

As Ichabod goes searching, Abbie asks Parrish if he's ever heard about a prophesy in which one witness renounces the other. He tells her about a passage written for John that says the two witnesses will prophesize for 1260 days, but ""when the beast comes up from the abyss, a witness will surrender a witness and neither will survive."" He reminds her it was rejected by those who transcribed the Bible. ""Sometimes a story is just a story,"" Parrish says.

Ichabod calls, he found a stone in the woods. He and Abbie slide it to the side and a secret grave opens in the ground.

Frank comes into the interrogation room at the station to find his ex-wife there and Tom overseeing as DNA is taken from his daughter, Macy. Forensics found DNA on the dead priest's neck. (Macy strangled him while she was possessed.)

Down in the elaborate tomb, there's a Masonic pyramid in the middle bearing the phrase ""I am the indispensable man,"" attributed to Washington. But Ichabod thinks the pyramid is not only too obvious to contain Washington, but also booby trapped.

He sees a circular plaque saying ""Cincinnatus,"" on it -- a Roman who was given power then relinquished it. He was Washington's hero, representing the idea that power should only be given to those who want it least.

Ichabod fits his Mason's ring in a small hole in the plaque and a secret wall opens and out slides Washington's casket. The angel statues around them suddenly suddenly light with fire, filling the tomb with light.

Washington's body, complete with his fake teeth, is in the casket. His skeleton is holding the map.

Ichabod gets only a minute to enjoy the discovery when demon Andy comes down the tomb stairs. Abbie fires at him but he easily grabs and crushes her gun. He tosses Ichabod aside and grabs Abbie around the neck, demanding the map.

Parrish lays a hand on him and Andy crumples, the demon side temporarily at bay. He tells Abbie to destroy the map because Moloch needs it to win the war. He begs Abbie to kill him as the demon starts to return. She picks up an ax and jams it through Andy's skull.

They hear something outside the tomb and head for another exit, out through the secret vault where Washington's casket lay.

As they're making their escape, supposedly dead Andy rises up and starts after them. Ichabod tells Abbie to shoot the booby trap on Washington's tomb. She does and the pyramid breaks apart, caving in on Andy as the other three run for it.

They escape to safety through another secret door that comes out in the forest. Abbie tells Crane what Andy said about Moloch using the map. As Ichabod stares at it, he debates. Finally, he apologizes to his wife as he lights the map on fire.

""If using this map meant betraying your trust, that's something I cannot do. Not for the world,"" he tells Abbie.

Crane tells Abbie they have free well and he chooses to forge his fate with her. ""I promise you, we are going to save her,"" Abbie says.

At the station, Frank walks purposefully as he thinks of his wife and daughter. He goes to Tom and confesses to killing the priest and Detective Jones. He turns over his badge and gun and they take him into custody.

Back at the cabin, Ichabod thinks of his wife and remembers her begging him to find her and free her, and him promising to do so. He grabs a notebook and pencil and, with his photographic memory, sets about recreating the map he just burned."

A Horseman rides as there's an eclipse. Henry Parish wakes from his vision.

Ichabod is standing on the shore on a bright sunny day when he thinks he sees Katrina. He follows her back to a Civil War re-enactment. At first he thinks he dreaming, until a red head tells him ""dude, relax."" He's excited they sell clothing there. He gets a call from Henry.

Back at the cabin, Jenny Mills assesses Ichabod's new clothes, same as his old clothes. She asks if he'll be getting rid of his coat. ""And risk it be worn ironically by purveyors of an artisanal marmalade who discovered it at a local thrift shop, I thank you, no,"" Ichabod says.

Abbie is about to go see Irving at the station, when Henry arrives and announces that he thinks that today Moloch is going to attempt to raise Hell on earth.

He saw Moloch surrounded by four white trees and he was raising a creature with a taloned hand from the dirt. He describes the Horseman, the second of the four, War. There is going to be a solar eclipse today.

Jenny mentions it's the 13 year anniversary, to the date, of when she and Abbie saw Moloch in the forest.

Abbie arrives at the station to find Irving has already been transferred upstate. He left a book for her with a note to check the marked pages.

Abbie returns to the archives, where Ichabod has found something in Washington's Bible saying a spell cast upon the dirt where the second Horseman will rise might prevent him from rising.

All the witches they know are dead, except Katrina. Ichabod reveals the map he drew to purtagory. He assures Abbie he wasn't going to use it without her.

Ichabod points to lines on a map and recalls Washington's words about a township that's a doorway between worlds.

Frank has Knapp's datebook, revealing meetings with Corbin. Abbie wants Jenny to go through the tape.

Jenny pulls her aside, incredulous that Abbie prepared to confront Moloch. But Abbie is ready to face him to reclaim their lives.

Jenny is worried about losing Abbie, but Abbie assures her she has to take on her role as a Witness and she'll be safe.

Abbie, Ichabod and Henry head to the spot in the woods that they think leads to purgatory. Ichabod expects to be able to find her in the church she visits every day. Henry warns them not to eat or drink anything while they're there or they'll become trapped.

Ichabod has an incantation from Washington's things to open the door from both sides. Henry reminds them to stay strong together over there. They recite the incantation and a mirror appears in the forest then shatters, revealing a hallway to the other side. They take hands then enter.

Abbie wakes up in the cabin with a bandage on her forehead. Sheriff Corbin and Andy Mills come in from the other room to check on her. They tell her she was in training at Quantico when she was knocked out in a line of fire exercise, which explains her confusion and memory loss.

She's thrilled to see Corbin again and hugs him. ""I'm supposed to remember something,"" she says.

Ichabod finds himself outside a university in England. Inside, his father congratulates him for his bravery in America and says that he's been granted a full professorship. Ichabod remembers his father disavowing him after he sided with the Americans, but his father says that's ridiculous and hugs him. He calls for drinks.

At the cabin, Abbie is sitting down in front of apple pie a la mode like she and Corbin used to share. Corbin and Andy dig in when Corbin says it's like old times. Abbie remembers Crane tells her they can't go back to the way things were. Abbie stands up, saying it isn't real. Her pie runs with blood.

Corbin chases after her. She sees Andy in his resurrected battered form and Corbin holding his severed head, then falls out the cabin door.

Back with his father, Ichabod remembers talking to Abbie about his father's disapproval. Ichabod realizes it's a dream.

His father turns into a demon and roars at him.

Listening to Corbin's tapes, Jenny finds a reference to a flyer Knapp had for an old church that he thinks holds answers.

Back in Purgatory, it's an all out creep show, as Ichabod is surrounded by people with no faces in a dark wood. He finds Abbie lying facedown in the forest. To reassure each other that they're the real deal -- she asks what she taught him after they trapped the Horseman. He extends his hand for a fist bump.

They make their way to the church as disfigured lost souls crawl along the ground and walls, seeking redemption.

They find Katrina in the church and give her the fast 411, but she says she can't leave Purgatory without forgiveness. The only way her soul can leave is if another takes her place. She begs them to leave before they're all trap.

Ichabod offers, but Abbie says she has to do it to finally face Moloch. He argues, but she's resolute, even though her staying essentially fulfills Moloch's prophecy.

Katrina gives Abbie an amulet to protect her from Moloch and promises to return after they've stopped War. Ichabod starts to vow he'll return, but she's sure he will. ""Remember our bond, faith,"" he says.

Ichabod teaches her the phrase to repeat, the doorway opens and they end up on the other side, where Parish is waiting.

In the forest, Moloch comes for Abbie, telling her there's no escape. She picks up a branch to take him on, but he lifts her off her feet by her throat. She rips the amulet off her neck and presses it into his skin, burning him. He drops her and she runs off.

Back in the forest, Katrina starts about trying to locate where the second Horseman will emerge. Her power is weak from lack of use, but she's able to determine the direction.

Meanwhile, Jenny arrives at the same church from Corbin's tape. It's boarded up.

Ichabod, Katrina and Parris reach the four white trees.

Jenny listens to Corbin's tapes, in which he wonders why someone would want to hide an abandoned church's name. As the eclipse begins, Jenny sees a fallen sign on the ground and uncovers it. She gets in her car and leaves Abbie a message saying she figured out Moloch's warning. ""The Saint's name is a sign -- he meant it literally, so whatever you do you can't --""

She's interrupted by a gunshot through her SUV window. The headless Horseman blocks her path and fires again. Her SUV flips over repeatedly, finally coming to a stop with her upside down inside.

Back in Purgatory, Abbie finds herself in a lifesize vesion of the dollhouse she and her sister used to play. She finds young versions of herself and Jenny.

The young version of herself tells her the reason she can't remember what happened after they saw Moloch in the woods is because he removed her memory, so she wouldn't know the truth.

In the woods, Katrina says there's nothing in the ground where the Horseman supposedly is.

Parish assures them the Horseman is there. He asks Ichabod if he knows the etymology of the word apocalypse: ""to disclose or reveal.""

Then he flings Ichabod and Katrina each against a white tree with his power and holds them there. He mocks Ichabod for being so easy to manipulate, and Abbie for wanting to believe there's a purpose to her pain.

Katrina realizes he gave her the idea to find the sin eater, a message which she relayed to Abbie. He reminds them about times he hinted about his identity, including when he was rhapsodizing about his love for good crossword puzzles ability to mislead and trick.

Parish tells them the second Horseman rose over a decade ago in the forest, and waited all this time to take form.

Back in Purgatory, young Abbie tells Abbie that it wasn't an accident Moloch was in the forest that day, and there was a reason they were sent there.

Abbie still can't remember, so young Abbie helps her remember seeing Moloch bring the second Horseman into the world -- Henry Parish.

Katrina compares Parish to Abraham, who was mortal before he became Death. ""Only half mortal. I am, after all, what you made me -- Mother and Father,"" Parish says.

He was killed by his mother's own coven and left to wither in a plain pine box. He takes out a knife and cuts his hand, bleeding on the ground, reminding them of the power of his blood. The pine box where he was buried is revealed in the dirt.

Ichabod remembers how his blood killed his son's Golem, and realizes Parish knew it would.

He didn't die, he laid in the box for two centuries, feeding on the vines that crept in, cursing those who abandoned him, until his ""true father"" came to rescue him.

Ichabod speaks to his son, calling him Jeremy, telling him Moloch is a prince of lies. Parish/Jeremy explains God sent a witness to stop him 13 years ago, but she wasn't strong enough and they defeated her, as they have again now.

In Purgatory, Abbie sees Parish is the Second Horseman and tries to figure a way out, as her young self explains Purgatory is her home now.

Henry/Jeremy explains he got his name when he wandered through the forest and the first place he saw was the church. We see the sign that Jenny found facedown: It says ""St. Henry's Parish.""

Ichabod and Katrina try to reach Jeremy, but can't. ""Now that the two Witnesses are separated, there is nothing to stop us breaking the second seal, and fulfilling the promise made long ago to an old friend,"" he says.

The Horseman/Abraham rides up and takes Katrina.

With his powers, Jeremy puts Ichabod in his old box in the ground. He removes the second seal from a leather pouch and breaks it over him.

""War isn't coming to Sleep Hollow, it's been here waiting all along. And now, it begins,"" Jeremy says. ""Good bye, father,"" he says, as the casket in the ground slams shut over a screaming Ichabod."

Winston mentions that Elizabeth was not the first woman to go missing from the prison.

Kelly is found alone, shot in the head (flesh wound that puts her on deaths door) at the amusement park. Sabrina, Jill and Bosley eventually learn that Kelly was at the park with her ""date"", an autistic boy named Skip to who she has been acting as a big sister. Skip was found abandoned when he was six years old.

Lying in a hospital bed and a stranger comes in announcing he's the father. He's actually a guy who lost the gun which had been used to kill a small time hood at the park earlier that day, which the boy found and shot Kelly with.

She reveals all to him about the little boy (like where he most likely is) and realizes the minute AFTER she gets a sedative injected that she's done wrong.

So she gets dressed and leaves the hospital in a taxi, swooning around an amusement park to save the day. She's single-handedly starts fighting (and losing to) the two bad guys. Fortunately, the taxi driver she begged to call Bosley actually did, and within seconds the whole group, plus cops show up just as the men point their guns at Kelly. ""Cheese it! It's the fuzz!""

Bullets start flying, yet the cops must be having coffee.

The only people who can catch the bad guy are the angels. PS: He ran out of bullets, so it was easy. They caught him in the centrifuge. They spun him until he lost his gun and then let him spin some more.

Now, the woman who abandoned him in the first place gets full custody while Kelly, in shorts and barefoot and Sabrina and Jill in full on 70s elephant bells (and shoes) stare at the now happy little boy fishing at the oceans edge.

I'm off to be sick."

In stead of learning a lesson, Sam tells Jonathan all about 'cool, exciting' Brooklyn life. When she decides to run back, Jonathan insists to tag along. Tony and Angela set out to get them back. They succeed, and are invited by Mrs. Rossini for dinner. While Tony shows her around, she gets a surprisingly lively argument herself with rude waitress Teresa, who still has an eye on Tony.

The sophisticated, sultry blonde Angela (JUDITH LIGHT), and her lower-class male servant, Tony (TONY DANZA), had been teaching their respective children to behave in a social manner, to avoid wild situations, and mainly, to never, never get into fights. Especially, Mrs. Angela Bower teaches Samantha that she should always ""get control"", and ""find some space"" - a fine way of saying she should step away from trouble, and never provoke it... The teenagers leave home in search of wild adventures, such as they imagine their parents lived when they were their age. In the evening, for dinner, as a prize for good behavior, they ""go Italian"" with Samantha's liberal minded grandmother Mona (KATHERINE HELMOND), expecting to meet Tony and Angela there.

Tony, who had talked a lot of his Italian ancestry, decided to take his boss out for dinner, the first time she showed some inclination towards accepting him as a person, rather than an employee. The choice was obviously his favorite Italian restaurant, where he seems familiar with everyone, from the Bartender (GREG LEWIS) to his former high-school colleague, ex-girlfriend and very sexy brunette Waitress Theresa (JULIE CARMEN). Tony diplomatically gets rid of an obnoxious Punk (ROBERTO ROMÁN), to the great pleasure of his boss. Amanda, despite trying not to get jealous about the affection the sultry Italian girl keeps for Tony, can't stop getting into an escalating argument with her over trivial matters of table service. At one point, Tony's old flame who is a down-to-earth girl, provokes the blonde lady openly, woman to woman. The smartly dressed lady stands up and empties her drink, plus a pint jug of beer on the Waitress's head, drenching her smart, albeit short and too tight uniform. They grab each other by the hair, and start a good, lengthy stand-up brawl. Tony and the restaurant manager and Bartender do mild attempts to stop the brawl, but they go on tugging and tearing clothes, pulling hair, slapping and punching each other in a wild melee, now breaking in pieces the light wooden furniture and glassware.

At this point, Angela's mother and daughter come in, accompanied by Jonathan (DONNY PINTAURO), in time to watch the catfight's last stage, and see mom wrestling on the floor with the fiery Waitress. They stare from the restaurant's door, and the boy boy teases Mrs. Bower about how she should ""get control, and find some space""... When the fight is finally stopped by the restaurant owner and a man, no winner was declared. Angela showed a left blue eye, but she had the high spirits of someone who had been on top of things most of the time, and it was the waitress who flew away from the fight. After a publicity break, the family is back home. Angela sports a black eye and several bruises on her face, but Samantha looks real proud of her mother, and asks her to teach her boxing."

It's a seemingly normal Tuesday morning in New York City at 6:30 a.m. as we meet our cast of characters in a series of quick establishing scenes.

-FBI agent Erica Evans is still asleep as the glass on her bedside table begins to quiver Jurassic Park-style. She gets up and goes to her son Tyler's room to discover he's not there. She calls his cell and finds out that he's in a clinic getting patched up after a fight the night before she tells him to stay put and that he's in big trouble. He's with his ""dumbass"" friend Brendan. Everything goes nutty and even though she says to stay where he is he takes off on his motorcycle.

-Catholic priest Father Jack Landry is opening up the church for the day and appraising the series of homeless folks and others populating the steps. Later, when everything goes nutty a parishioner named Roy who uses a wheelchair almost gets crushed by a falling crucifix but Father Jack pushes him out of the way.

-Ryan, some kind of businessman, is entering a jewelry store getting an engagement ring for his girl and is nervous about proposing. His girl, Val, is at their apartment when everything starts to shake and bookcases start to fall. When things go nutty, he's walking out of the jewelry store when a fighter plane crashes in the middle of the road, it's pilot's lifeless body follows by parachute. He looks up.

-TV news anchor Chad Decker is in the shower getting ready for work as we also seem on a TV screen in an earlier report about home foreclosures. He gets to work only to be disappointed that a big story is being given to another reporter. When things start to shake at the station he heads to the roof with others to see what the commotion is about.

Eventually everybody looks up and what they see is a big ole silver spaceship. We learn that 28 more of them have appeared all over the world over the major cities and they have yet to make contact.

Tyler and Erica meet up after some hassles and Ryan and Val also gratefully meet up at home.

Suddenly the spaceship facade starts to change. It turns out it's becoming a big old video screen on the undercarriage. A beautiful woman's face appears. She calmly informs the terrified populace that they come in peace and she apologizes for the turmoil their arrival has caused. They're psyched to discover intelligent life in the universe and they're in a bind because they really need water to survive. Her name is Anna and she promises that in return for the help from Earth, they will share their advanced technology and medical knowledge. She totally wants to become friends and will be coming down soon. Until then, she says, ""we are of peace."" The crowds across the world applaud this message.

An elderly priest informs Father Jack that the Vatican is on board with the ""Visitors"" as they're being called since ""we're all God's creatures."" Jack is skeptical. They turn the corner into the church and are amazed to see a full house.

Brandon and Tyler watch the news as Erica chats on the phone with her FBI partner Del at the office. He's understandably distracted by the spaceships but she's noticed a spike in terrorist cell chatter. She's noticed a big order for C-4 and wonders if that means an attack. Her partner says he'll check into it and sweetly asks after her and Tyler and says he's there for her.

Anna comes on down to make a statement. Brandon and Tyler thinks she's hot. Anna says she's excited and inspired by this moment and will always cherish the friendship of earthlings. The press starts lobbing questions. Chad tells them to back off and show some respect. She asks if he has a question. He asks if there's such a thing as an ugly Visitor. She thanks him and says he's not so bad himself. They smile and laugh. Chad later reports on it and wonders if the press should be so tough on the ""V""s as we now are calling them apparently. Anna watches from her ship and says to a toady ""I want him.""

Chad reports that three weeks have passed since the visitor's arrival and they're allowing people to come visit their ships which is causing an economic boom for the host cities. Their medical facilities are also healing people right quick. Some people are protesting though.

Erica tells Del that they've got a line on ""their"" cell with a shipment of C4 to an industrial location. They go to check it out but there's nothing to be seen. They go to check out a seemingly ramshackle shed and discover a secret er, hatch, that leads to a big underground warehouse type space with, unfortunately for him, a dead guy in it. There's also a buttload of C4 in crates.

Ryan gets a call from a guy who says he needs his help because ""they're here, it's starting."" Val arrives and the phone rings again and he ignores it. She wonders it might be important. He says nothing's more important than her.

Brandon and Tyler go for a rocket shuttle ride to the New York mothership. They're welcomed by a comely blonde V named Lisa and check out the massive view of the V ""city"" inside the ship. Tyler is smitten. With Lisa, not the city.

Del and Erica go over the scene where they find the most awesome fake passports ever and not much else. It was like the folks there knew they were coming.

Lisa tells the boys all about the V ""peace ambassador"" program, which is basically like a street team for the V's and includes a uniform! They're only 17 though and they need to be 18 to join. She says they can with a parental signature. They don't picture that going over well. Lisa's all flirty flirty, ""that's too bad, I wanted to spend time with you.""

Father Jack preaches a sermon of caution of jumping on a bandwagon when it looks so sweet. He says let's make sure it's sturdy first and that the V's need to earn their trust. The congregation nods but the older priest doesn't care for this since the V's have driven people into the church. Jack argues that they're coming because they're scared and who wouldn't want a savior right now and worries that gratitude will turn into devotion. Roy wheels in and shows the priests that the V's healed them.

Tyler comes in and Erica is looking at her computer. She calls him over and shows him that the principal sent her video of him and Brandon spray painting V's on things. She's worried about him becoming obsessed. She tells him to think for himself. He says he does and that the V's call the graffiti ""spreading hope."" She asks him to talk to her and wonders if his acting out is because his dad left. He can't believe she's blaming him and that at least his dad has an excuse to be out of touch and that she's not ""there"" for him as often as she might believe and walks away.

The toady arrives to let Chad know that he's been chosen to do a one-on-one interview with Anna.He's excited.

Val notices Ryan's phone ringing and goes to answer. He stops her and says it's no one. She says he's been keeping secrets and wants to know what's up. He tells her not to ""read things into things. ""

Erica and Del go over one of the passports they found of a creepy dude. She ID'ed the victim and got a search warrant for his house. They go there and discover it's been tossed. Again someone was tipped off. She calls the victim's cell phone and it rings in the other room. There's a text on his phone with info on a secret meeting where new members should be prepared for the ""test"" and where information will be shared about the ""cell.""

A man, George, the one who was calling, approaches Ryan begging for his help with a new group. Ryan points out the people who were killed last time. George says they're being more careful. Ryan says he's not going to get involved because he wants to protect his soon fiance who doesn't know about his past. George gives him the info about the meeting if he changes his mind or grows a conscious.

In the church Father Jack encounters a wounded parishioner who says he knows the real reason the V's are here: to obliterate us. He gives him a bloody envelope with imporant info inside that he makes Father Jack promise to take to the meeting tonight to share with the group.

Chad sits down with Anna. They're about to go to air and he asks if she has any questions. She says no but tells him not to ask any questions that would portray the V's in a negative light. He says as a journalist it's his job to ask questions and some might make them uncomfortable. She pulls the plug two minutes to air. He says that's just how it's done. She points out that this interview will help his career and doesn't he want to to do that.

Jack, out of his priest clothes, puts on his coat purposefully.

Erica and Del sit in a car outside the meeting. He thinks she's crazy to go in but she points out they're expecting new folks and to send in the cavalry if she doesn't come out in 30 minutes. She doesn't want back-up in case of the mole.

These next two interludes were intercut:

She enters the meeting and a couple of dozen people are gathered. George, the leader says everyone should prepare for the test, which involves getting a slit cut in the side of their head to prove there is skullbone underneath their skin. George explains that the V's have covered their regular reptilian skin with human facades, they've actually been here for years infiltrating all levels of mankind, and they're about to open a can of whup-ass that will exterminate everyone on earth. He says the final stage of their plan began with the arrival of the spaceships and positioning themselves as saviors of mankind. But by the time folks figure it out, it will be too late. He knows that some of them think he's crazy. Erica asks if he has any proof. Just as she is about to leave the meeting Father Jack comes forward with his proof. It's a photo of the creepy guy Erica was tracking, Leclair and she puts it together with George's help, it's a ""sleeper cell"" of Visitors. Chad starts his interview with Anna and she says in an oily way that she's here to discuss all topics ""without reserve."" She says they come from a place of great beauty like earth. (Brandon and Val watch the interview at home). She says they don't divide themselves into countries though they're just one big happy family. She calls humanity a rare gift. She says they're happy to share their technology. She says they've evolved to expel negative feelings since happiness comes from tranquility. (Tyler pulls out his ""peace ambassador"" form and forges his mom's signature). She says they're going to expand their health centers and keep the healing coming for everybody, everywhere.

At the end of the meeting she chats with Jack and calls him brave. He says he's scared. She says that makes him human. Just as they shake hand a little floating ball comes in. George sees it and yells at people to get down. The thing explodes sending out small knife-y things that kills a bunch of folks and intruders swarm in and start kicking ass. Jack fights with one. Erica is grabbed by another from behind. He slams her into the ground and it's.. Del! Who goes about trying to choke the life out of her. George is about to get sliced by another when Ryan shows up and saves him, not without getting cut first.

Erica whacks Del partner upside the head exposing a part of his lizard head underneath. He comes to and tries to choke her some more and she impales him. She and Jack make a run for it. As do Ryan and George.

In the post-mortem, George can't believe the V's brutality and calls them animals. Not all of them, says Ryan, who pulls back his slashed arm skin to show that he's a V. George freaks. Ryan says there are other traitor/deserters who will help them but now has to go break up with Val since he's rejoining the fight.

The toady catches up with a mad Chad and tells him that he's Anna's media boy/bitch from now on, that she trusts him. He says he's not sure he trusts her. The toady says compromising his principles for the greater good is noble. Chad isn't sure. The toady wonders if he has an aversion to a worldwide audience. Chad stares at him and then exchanges a look with Anna.

When Ryan gets home, Val is tearful. She says she was nervous about his weird behavior and was embarrassed to discover the engagement ring. She asks if he still loves her. Down on one knee, he says he does and hugs her.

Father Jack and Erica sit on a rooftop and she talks about not being able to trust anyone given that she just impaled her partner. He wonders what they do now. As she begins to talk about gathering a resistance, bringing people into the fold and fighting, we see Tyler go to the V ship, slide on a V uniform, clasp hands with Lisa and be led to a platform. Erica says the V's have a head start and are arming themselves with the most powerful weapon out there: devotion. The V's toast the new peace ambassadors and the dawn of a new day.

The last shot is of Anna gazing out a ship window and pulling back to show it hovering over New York."

We pick up where we left off with Jack and Erica on the roof. In fact, it's an actual replay of the final bits where they talk about recruiting for a resistance as they look at the ship in the distance. A little shuttle veers off of the main ship and flies by them and touches down at the warehouse where the rumble took place. Erica and Jack run to look and watch them cleaning up. Jack wants to call the police. Erica wants to do it anonymously and goes to a pay phone. Turns out the V were intercepting the call and they send a little evil seeky ball to attack them. Erica and Jack successfully evade and destroy it. She realizes since Dale was her partner for seven years no one is to be trusted. She tells him to go home and pretend like this never happened.

Erica goes home and calls to Tyler but his room is empty. She hears a noise downstairs and grabs a baseball bat and heads down and almost whacks him. He lies and says he was with Brandon. He asks if she's okay. She says she is serious about the Visitors and makes him promise to stay away from them. He says he's safe and heads to bed. She calls after him that she loves him.

In his room he busts out his sweet new ""peace ambassador"" uniform and hides it under his mattress.

The news, on at the church, tells us that the government is close to establishing diplomatic ties with the Visitors. It would allow them full freedom of movement. The older priest likes this. He mentions to Jack that the police want to talk to him about the man who was stabbed the day before.

Erica is in the shower and has a nightmare daydream where Dale interrupts her with his gun to Tyler's head. Her phone rings and breaks the fantasy. It's her boss reporting that Dale is missing and telling her to get in.

Val and Ryan lie in bed in a post-engagement reverie. She asks after his bandaged arm. He claims he was scratched on a filing cabinet. He goes into the bathroom and checks on his wound. He looks nervous.

Chad looks over his interview with Anna, fixating on her duplicity. His assistant wonders why he's beating himself up. She says they had 80 million viewers and if he had gone after her he never would've gotten access. He says 80 million people watched Anna.

On the mothership, Anna is doing this groovy mirror thing where she's changing her clothes with the flick of a finger. Marcus enters and says India is holding out. She says once they have the U.S. everyone else will fall into line. As he checks out a geisha outfit she talks about how in Japan the get up implies allure and submission. He says he's not sure that's the message she wants to send. She says he just doesn't get humanity.

Erica heads to the office, eyeing everyone suspiciously. (Ooh and maybe she should because there's a Cylon! Rekha Sharma walks by. And Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace's dad, Roark Critchlow, is apparently the FBI boss man!) Her boss says Dale never made it home and his wife, who is at the office, is worried sick. She claims she's not worried about the Visitors, just worried about Dale. They go into a room where she's presented with an interrogation team.

Tory the Cylon goes to visit Father Jack, her name is Serena, and ask him about the man who died at the church. He says he was expecting the police not the FBI. She says the dad guy called them for years about an alien invasion. They've gotten tons of calls like that, of course, she says but now they have to take them seriously.

The following interrogations are intercut:

The panel gets down to asking Erica questions. She claims they had dinner and he dropped her off around 9.

Father Jack says he never saw the dead guy before.

Erica says she wasn't aware of any marital or drug or alcohol problems.

Father Jack says the guy didn't say anything about the Visitors, he just seemed scared.

She says everyone is stressed out and Dale has always had her back. She says they were never romantically involved. They get the news they found Dale's car.

She and FBI boss, who is named Paul, head there. The car's still at the pier. She says the address came up in their terrorist investigation and maybe he came to check it out. Paul wonders why she didn't tell him about that back at HQ. She goes to the car and grabs her ID and gun while no one is looking. She hands Paul Dale's phone.

Anna is thanking the people of several countries from the underside of the ships for establishing diplomatic ties including Mexico and Japan. She says they're waiting for Russia, India, and the U.S.

Chad's assistant hands him poll numbers about the Visitors. There's a 50/50 split. He says people need more answers and he's going to get them and he's going to prove to Anna that she's not the only one who can get what she wants.

Valerie hands Ryan her ring and says she wants him to give it to her in his own time since she feels guilty for snooping. She asks to do lunch and he claims a meeting in Jersey and asks for a raincheck.

Brandon gives Tyler props for his ""brass clinkers"" for signing up with the V. Tyler asks him to keep it on the DL around his mom. They head to a V center. They meet Lisa. She compliments his sweet V jacket. She also says hi to Brandon and hears he wants to be an ambassador. She bumps him to the front of the line.

The elder priest asks if Jack is okay. He confesses he feels bad for not telling Serena about the guy ranting about the Visitors. The elder priest says the guy was loco and the FBI lady confirmed it. Jack says she wasn't just FBI but with the Visitor Threat Assessment Joint Task Force. He tells Jack to tread carefully so as not to upset the applecart with regard to diplomatic negotiations. he assures him that he did the right thing.

The FBI enters the warehouse which has been wiped clean. Paul asks again about why he didn't hear about the place. She explains about the mole. He wonders why Dale would come alone, didn't he trust her? She says she's had it with his tone and she's worried about Dale. He says to go find her.

Marcus looks over a blurry video of the meeting and the people at it, asking another lackey if any of them are from the original resistance. The dude doesn't know but another scary dude interrogates a guy they grabbed from the meeting. The meeting guy is in his underwear on a white pod and the scary Visitor is making him think, somehow, that snakes are crawling all over him. He says he'll make the snakes go away if the guy gives him names of people at the meeting. The guy says he doesn't know. Marcus isn't pleased.

Ryan goes to Al's Garage looking for Angelo Russo. The mechanic under the car says he's never heard of him. Ryan pulls him out from under the car and Angelo says he told him never to come back.

Erica comes back to the office and is surprised to see Jack and that he's a priest. He's surprised to see her and that she's an FBI agent. Serena is all ""you know each other?"" Erica claims they just met. She asks what he's doing and he says ""upsetting the apple cart."" He's going to share the photo that the dead guy gave him and she tries, only with her eyes, to tell him to stop. She asks Serena why Jack is there and she says he has info on a murder.

At the V center, Tyler flirts with Lisa as a protest brews outside. He offers to take her for pizza on his bike. She takes a picture of herself on his phone. A protester starts a fight with Brandon. Tyler goes and, of course, throws the first punch. Brandon pulls him off and turns back to Lisa, who is disgusted.

Angelo says he heard about the fight at the warehouse in Brooklyn. He pulls out a V medical bag and fixes his scratch. Angelo can't believe Ryan has joined the resistance when he should be hiding. Angelo says that what the V will do to the humans won't compare to what they'll do to traitors like Ryan and himself. Ryan asks for names of others who might be willing to join. But as he does he starts getting woozy and realizes Angelo drugged him. Angelo apologizes saying he can't trust him.

Erica grabs Jack as he leaves and asks what part of not trusting anyone didn't he understand. He thought he was helping, that maybe the photos would keep the government from getting in bed with the Visitors. She points out that Dale was the government. He complains that she walked away from his last night and he didn't know what to do and not trusting anyone from now on won't be a problem.

She walks back into the office and Paul calls her into his office. He keeps wondering why Dale would go into the warehouse alone. He knows she's lying. She says she's not. He plays the 911 call with her voice on it. He asks her to tell him it's not her. She says it was her. He's mad she lied. She explains she thinks he's a traitor, working with the terrorist group, she saw him meet with them. He wonders why she didn't call for back-up. She didn't want to blow a legitimate investigation so she called 911 in case he needed help but then back-up never showed up. He says they didn't because the DEA has all those phones rigged and that's how he got her call. She realizes, for some reason, this helps make her case. He tells her to investigate but hopes she's wrong.

Anna watches, not so happy, as Chad decides to have a panel discussion on the V's on ""Prime Focus"" with a pro-side and an anti-side.

Erica goes to visit Father Jack and apologizes. She talks about all of the people Dale fooled, friends, family, and his wife. Jack wonders if she's a Visitor too. Erica doesn't know but thinks they need to talk to her. He says he's out, taking her advice to forget it and be normal. She says there is no normal anymore. She says he's the only person she can trust. He says no, she's FBI and he's a priest, he'll do his helping at the church thanks, and walks away.

Erica goes to visit Dale's wife Jocelyn wondering why there were no calls to her. She says he had a personal phone, wanted to keep work and family separate. She shows the phone bill with two numbers only: hers and another number. Erica asks if Dale has been acting odd. Jocelyn says Dale often gets lost in work and can be distant. Erica asks if the Visitors arrival triggered it. Jocelyn says maybe since their arrival changed everyone in some way.

Ryan wakes up in the garage alone and hotfoots it out of there.

Back at FBI HQ Erica shows the bill to Paul. The number's untraceable but she's figured out that they were all tip off calls. Paul can't believe Dale's a traitor. He can't, asks Erica? She says they were joined at the hip for 7 years. Paul can't believe Dale's still in the wind.

Ryan gets home and Val's not home. Angelo gives him a ring and tells him to stay away from Val if he really loves her and then runs down Valerie's entire personal history. Ryan asks if Angelo did something to her. He says no, but if he can find out everything about her so can the Visitors so he should reconsider marrying her and hangs up.

Tyler goes back to the V center and tells Lisa, through the bars around the center that he isn't being allowed in. She says the counsel wants to kick him out for fighting in that jacket. She says she's already in trouble for recommending him and his fate is up to the counsel. She bids him adieu.

Marcus bring Chad aboard the ship and chides him for biting the hand that feeds him. Chad points out that he actually helped. Sure there were cons he said but there was an uptick in V acceptance in the insta-polls after his show. He says he made the public more comfortable with them which might help influence the government. Marcus asks if he's done preening. Chad says no, this was a freebie and the next time they want his help it'll be on his terms. He walks off all cocksure.

The next scene is Chad announcing that the U.S. is allowing some limited diplomatic relations with the Visitors. Anna does her underside video thingy and gives thanks.

Father Jack and the older priest watch, and the older priest says it's a great blessing.

Chad is walking out of the studio when Anna calls to thank him. He says you're welcom and as he starts to say more she hangs up on him.

Erica leaves the office and runs into Jack who was waiting for her. He says the announcement made him ill. He says she knows they won't win this war picking them off one at a time. She says didn't realize he had re-enlisted. He says at first he was worried about what he'd have to do if he got involved but now he's worried about doing nothing. She says the diplomatic relations won't make things easier. Nor will giving the V task force those pictures, says Jack. She says there are probably Visitors on the task force since they can't tell who is one. She hands him the task force list of everyone who has ever contaced the FBI about aliens. It's thick. He's hopeful it has people on it they can recruit, maybe ones they met at the warehouse.

Later that night at home Val says the Visitor's have created a boom in the therapy business. She wants to look at his arm. It's just a long scratch now, almost healed. She looks at the wall and is confused that a picture is upside down. She turns the frame right side up and a card falls out of it with a name (Cyrus) and an address (51509 Gibbs Ave). She asks who he is and he says ""some guy I used to know"" and she accepts this because he's kissing her.

Erica goes to Tyler's room and thanks for keeping his promise about the V's. He clicks on his phone and looks at Lisa's picture.

Down in the kitchen Erica looks at Dale's file. She pulls out his photo and shreds it.

Back on the white pod on the mothership, Dale, with a big slash in his head, comes to."

Chad is reporting on the diplomatic visas being awarded to Visitors. Anna gets the first one. Lisa and Marcus are also on the list. Protests are taking place outside the New York Peace Ambassador center. Chad's assistant observes that he helped make this day happen. He realizes, ruefully, that he did. He and Anna eye each other as she heads up a glass elevator in the center.

Father Jack hears confessions from many of his flock who are conflicted about the V. Some see it as a miracle, others have had their faith unmoored.

It's Saturday at 9:15 a.m. and Erica is doing some work on files at home. She's half-watching the news and complains to an entering Tyler that a proper vetting process couldn't have taken place. Tyler says it must be hard thinking everyone's a terrorist. She doesn't want him going into the city but he says he's just giving Brandon a lift. She tells him to come right home and be careful.

Father Jack comes to visit as Tyler leaves. He's come to vent his thoughts and chew over the sleeper cell concept. Erica says the Vs need humans for something and until they figure out what they'll fight them one step at a time. Erica meanwhile can't sleep and has been going over lists and plugging names into the FBI database from the big file she got. She gets a call to go protect the V ambassador center, there's been a death threat. She says if she has to be on their side maybe she can find out something to help. Jack stays to cross reference and tells her to be careful.

Ryan is walking Val to work and telling her to be careful since things are crazy. Val says people fear change but that it will be cool and thinks any reason for him walking her to work is good. They're about to part and she asks why he seems secretive. He claims he wouldn't want to keep any secrets from her. She heads into her building.

Ryan pivots and gets in a car that just pulled up. Georgie is driving. Ryan asks how many others survived the warehouse ambush. Georgie doesn't know, he's scared and doesn't know who to trust. Ryan says with the visas it will get worse and they need to mount a resistance. Georgie says they need cash and bodies. Ryan says they have both via a mythical man named John May, leader of the original resistance of V traitors known as the Fifth Column. Georgie says the Vs have sleeper cells. Ryan says the Fifth Column is down but not out and they can win with John May's help.

Marcus informs another V, a doctor named Joshua, that Dale has regained consciousness. Apparently, Dale was a sleeper agent for almost 20 years. Marcus says they have to know if he was compromised and if so by whom. Joshua goes to visit Dale who's still on the white pod. Dale is confused. Joshua calls him a real hero. Dale wonders what he did. Joshua points out his wound and says whoever did it was going for his heart and if he were human they would've killed you. Dale has post traumatic amnesia but wants help to remember who did this to him.

Chad continues to report on the V protest, it is being led by Mary Falkner, the widow of the pilot of the fighter jet we saw go down in the, er, pilot. She's on a hunger strike for him and the 642 other people who died as a result of the V arrival. Anna wants Marcus to find out more about Mary Falkner so they can stop her.

Tyler shows up with Brandon at the peace ambassador center. Brandon is sad that Tyler is out. Tyler says he'll figure it out. He spies Lisa behind the barricade. He speed off just as his mom arrives to help manage the death threat issue, leveled by an unstable, maybe an ex-military dude, with a plan. They run down the situation with a strike team, trying to avoid a panicked mob. They'll be working with V security, each FBI person will get a V partner. Erica doesn't want one. Her partner understands, since humans are mistrustful.

She and the partner go to the security center and realign security cameras. She's surprised by it's smallness. Her partner wants any V casualties treated by their own medical staff. As he tells her this his back is to the hallway and a door across the way opens revealing a much more elaborate security center. They take off.

Back at the Evans homestead Father Jack is cross referencing names. He gets one hit from a guy who seems to know about the V. It's Georgie. He calls and leaves Erica a message.

Ryan gives Georgie Cyrus's card, turns out he used to be Ryan's right hand in the resistance and he had killer Fifth Column contacts. George is too scared to recruit at the moment. Ryan says he has to do it, that there's strength in numbers. He goes to visit Cyrus, who is surprised and happy to see him.

All 29 V captains have met on the New York mothership for a briefing via holographic video. Anna warns the captains to keep a close eye on their human hosts and shape the public opinion.

Joshua explains to Dale about the warehouse ambush. Dale realizes whoever did this saw his true face.

Marcus got the data on Mary Falkner for Anna. Anna explains that Falkner's bereaved behavior is contagious so they have to make an example of her so she doesn't infect others.

Father Jack goes to visit Georgie. He walks right into his unlocked house and pokes around. He notices a photo and news clippings of a dead family. A woman comes in and says he doesn't live here anymore. She wonders if Father Jack is counseling Georgie over the murders of his family. She says he went crazy after that, saying aliens did it. Father Jack gives her his card and to tell him that he was at the warehouse.

Cyrus says the Column isn't what it once was, as they have a drink. Ryan says they have to get the band back together. Cyrus offers only names and numbers, he doesn't want to re-enlist. He heads into another room. Ryan follows and Cyrus pulls a gun on Ryan. He then hits a button alerting the Vs to Ryan's presence. Cyrus says the leaders told him that they would ""reconnect him"" if he turned in enough Column peeps. Ryan says they won't, they will take all the traitors he's got and then they will skin him alive. Cyrus thinks they'll keep their word. Cyrus wonders if Ryan doesn't miss the bliss. Ryan says the bliss is how Anna controls them, like junkies, which is what Cyrus is. They struggle for the gun. Ryan gets it and points it at Cyrus' head saying you've got to be alive to be reconnected.

Erica and her partner head to the roof for a vantage. They scan the crowd. Erica notices a missing guard. They go to investigate and discover a man down. Erica realizes the shooter is now wearing a V uniform. She is down on ground level now and scanning the crowd. She thinks she picks him up. She radios directions to others. The guy pulls a gun just as Marcus walks by. She disarms and cuffs him. She and her partner drag him off.

Chad reports on the incident, Brandon and Tyler walk into a pizza place showing the news update. They see Lisa there. Brandon set it up. They are smiley and awkward. She says he's back in the ambassador program.

Erica's V partner thanks her and says the Vs will take it from there. Her boss acquiesces to this, saying it's complicated. She says she'll meet him outside but goes to the security center instead and tries punching in numbers. She gets it right on the second try and enters. It's pretty snazzy with dozens of screens. She touches one and it gets bigger and includes sound. It's surveillance from all over the city. One is of her in the room. She tries to find teh camera and realizes it's in the V uniform jacket pocket. She hears a noise and takes off. In the empty room, among the many screens, we get a shot of Tyler looking at himself in a mirror, Lisa appears over his shoulder.

A V shuttle heads to the mainland. Anna is practicing a speech to console humans who lost someone. She's even practicing crying. Mary Falkner is driven up to the V ambassador center. Anna meets her, apologizes for the surprise, and offers her condolences. Falkner follows her into the center.

Erica's boss introduces her to Marcus, who thanks her for saving his life. He extends his hand, she says if there's anything else she can do. And, he says, vice versa.

Joshua has brought Dale into a virtual construct - his office- based on his neural scan. Dale recognizes his desk. Joshua says it must've been amazing living with another species for 20 years. ""If by amazing you mean smelly, crowded and disgusting then yeah."" Dale remembers something and Joshua thinks that's a good sign and that what happened that night will come back to him. Dale says it was disgusting to wake up next to a human every day. Joshua reminds Dale of his wife and Erica. He remembers that it was Erica attacked him. He says he has to go back down and kill her.

Father Jack is lighting candles and Georgie shows up with a gun. Father Jack explains about Erica, Dale, mounting a resistance. Georgie says every time they get together, they get crushed. Father Jack says he saw the pictures of his family and although he doesn't know what George has been through if he's anything like him he knows he feels alone and that they need to stick together, there's strength in numbers.

Still in the construct, Joshua says he's not sending Dale back. Dale is confused. Joshua says if half of what Dale says is true, Erica will be an excellent ally. Dale tries to punch him but he's not real. The construct falls away and Dale wakes up as Joshua is injecting him with something. Dale calls him a traitor. As Joshua injects him he says, ""The Fifth Column says hello.""

Mary Falkner emerges from her meeting with Anna a changed woman. At a podium in front of the press, she's all ""I heart the V"" now and other people who feel bad from loss also should heart them too and her husband didn't die in vain. Anna comes to the podium and holds her hand. Anna says the man who tried to kill one of her people today was really trying to kill peace and they won't let that happen.

Marcus and a group of Vs show up at Cyrus', but they're too late, he's but dust on the floor. On the back of the swinging door someone has spray painted ""John May Lives."" If this is true, says Marcus, there will be no peace.

Tyler and Lisa -- both in their V jackets -- are totally making out in his room when he hears his mom come home. He freaks and explains his mom doesn't like the Vs and tells Lisa to stay put. Erica hears a noise and asks if Tyler has company. She busts into his room and discovers Lisa in her underwear. Erica tells her to put her clothes on and tells Tyler to take her home and that they'll talk later. Lisa says she figured this was better than his mom seeing her V uniform.

Anna watches as Chad reports on the PR win for the Vs today. There's been an outpouring of new support. She turns to the so-called ""assassin"" who was, of course, actually a V and tells him he did a nice job. Chad talks up his exclusive interview with Mary Falkner. This seems to annoy Anna, or does it please her? Hard to tell.

Erica explains about the surveillance room to Father Jack at the church, who says they have to be careful. She tells him the same thing about going after Georgie. Georgie arrives, with a friend, Ryan. They all say hello and stare at each other.

Lisa returns to the mothership and tells Anna that Tyler's ""the one"" and that they should use him. Anna says Lisa's doing an excellent job and she's proud of her. Lisa says ""thank you mother."""

Ryan runs through a parking structure. As does Erica who races up to Georgie who's on the ground. Ryan points a weapon at her.

An onscreen title announces Fourteen Hours Earlier

Back at the confab between Erica, Ryan, Georgie, and Father Jack, Georgie expounds on his long struggle fighting with the V's and how they killed his family. Erica wonders how Ryan knows so much about them. Ryan says he's been doing it even longer than Georgie. Georgie wants to hit back for the warehouse attack. Erica says they don't have enough people. Georgie says they just need to get a V and cut them open and show them to the world. Ryan says the V's will have no choice but to retaliate if they do that. Father Jack, not psyched about the V murder plan counsels caution.

Georgie and Ryan leave and he wonders why Ryan didn't fess up to being a V. Ryan angrily says he better never hear Georgie talk about skinning a V again.

Marcus tells Anna about Dale's murder. Joshua can't believe it! Marcus says he's heard rumors about traitors and the Fifth Column. Anna asks Joshua to assemble a team and find out who did it. Marcus gives Joshua a stern look.

Meanwhile Erica does some poking around in Ryan's background on her computer at home. He has no criminal record or known aliases. Tyler comes in as she works in the living room. He wants to talk. She asks for two minutes and continues working for several more minutes. Tyler sits and flicks on the TV. Chad is talking to Anna who is announcing more miraculous healing centers.

Val is also watching, she's on the phone trying to get an appointment with the doctor. She tells Ryan her heart medication is making her tired. She contemplates stopping taking them. Ryan says she can't. They kiss. Ryan watches the TV as Anna talks about a new super vitamin-like injection that will help humans fight off numerous forms of cancer and even aging. She jokes to Chad that even the V's haven't cracked the common cold.

Back at the Evans homestead Tyler tries to tell Erica about Lisa. Her phone rings, it's Ryan. She says she'll call him back. Tyler stalks off and says it's fine. Ryan says they need to meet.

The core quartet meets up again and Ryan tells them it's a lie about the injection, that it's harmful and part of something much bigger that was started years ago. He wants to give Erica the names of the V's who were involved in the injection project last time. She runs their names and they get a hit on a Peter Combs. Ryan knows he's a V and if they follow him he thinks Combs will lead him to a bigger part of the puzzle.

Tyler talks in therapy about not being able to talk to his mom and all she can say is to stay away from the V's and that she thinks they're evil. He shows off his V jacket and says he's become a peace ambassador. He thinks the world is broken and the V's are fixing it. His therapist? Valerie. She asks if he's been to the healing centers. She's curious. He says he knows someone and might be able to bump her to the front of the line. She says she might take him up on that. He says when he turns 18 in a few months he's going to do what he wants. She says even when he's 18 Erica will be his mom. His jacket, lying on a nearby chair, transmits his session to the mothership where Lisa and Anna are watching. Lisa says she thought it might take longer but now thinks that Tyler is ""ready."" Anna says to bring him aboard.

Marcus is thanking Chad for doing a report on the healing center. He exposits he didn't have a choice, Anna wouldn't do an interview with him unless he did this. He watches, amazed, through glass as a V scans away a grateful patient's wound.

Erica can't reach Tyler and tells Father Jack that Tyler is mad at her but she doesn't want to talk about it. Ryan calls, they're all in place to follow Combs, who gets out of class in 15 minutes. Ryan waits in the parking garage, apparently Georgie is upstairs. Erica calls Georgie but he doesn't pick up.

Joshua tells Anna that he extensively interivewed everyone and he can't find any clues as to who did it. She testily tells him and another medical guy to gather the medical staff. The other guy tells Joshua that he needs to get off the ship since he's too important to the Column, he says he won't let it happen.

Father Jack and Erica wait, as do Georgie and Ryan. Combs emerges and Georgie cocks a gun and follows him. Combs gets to his car and Georgie points his weapon at him and says he's going to cut him open and expose him. He then shoots. Combs ducks and then shoots Georgie. We're back to where we were at the beginnig of the episode. Ryan wasn't shooting at Erica he was shooting at Combs behind her. He shoots Combs. Father Jack pulls up in the car and takes Georgie off. Ryan grabs Combs who calls Ryan a filthy traitor and then takes some kind of V cyanide that burns him up and turns him to ash from the inside. He turns around and Erica is pointing a gun at him. She says matter-of-factly: ""You're a Visitor."" He does not protest.

She asks him what the hell is going on. He says they're on the same side. He says everything he's told her is true. Except that he's a Visitor. He never said he wasn't. He says the sirens are getting close, what's it going to be.

Chad is getting a V body scan for his report on the healing centers. Marcus enters and asks if he needs anything. Chad would like more freedom to walk around and talk to patients alone. Marcus is all ""tight schedule, sorry.""

Father Jack tends to Georgie's wounds. Turns out he did two tours in Iraq as an Army chaplain. Georgie tells him he needs to decide whether he's a priest or a soldier.

Ryan opens Combs' briefcase and he realizes that they won't get anywhere until she can ask her questions. She asks about the pill. Suicide pill, leaves no evidence behind, all V's carry them. She wonders why he called Ryan a traitor and if there are other V's like him fighting back. He says they call it the Fifth Column. She says it's good to know. They go through Combs' stuff and find a suspicious invoice for a shipping company.

Anna addresses the medical staff about Dale's murder and what it cost them in intelligence. She asks the Not Joshua guy to go stand with the rest of the staff. She appraises Joshua. She says unless the guilty party steps forward she will choose one to make an example of and an innocent will suffer. Not Joshua steps forward just as Joshua himself was about to. Not Joshua says ""long live the Fifth Column."" Anna says that as lead medical officer it's Joshua's job to carry out the sentence of skinning him.

Tyler is hanging with Lisa on the mothership. He wonders if he's in trouble with her mom. She says no. She explains Anna is her mom and he's speechless. Anna welcomes him with a smile and says she wants to speak to him alone. Lisa tells him not to worry, that Anna doesn't bite.

Ryan and Erica check out the shipping company. She lures the security guard out. Ryan incapacitates him and she and Father Jack and Ryan go in. Ryan calls for an evacuation.

Anna says Lisa's happiness is a big priority and says she's quite taken with Tyler. He says he digs her too. Anna is glad. So glad she shows him the groovy propulsion system - engine room- of the ship because she knows that he digs machines since Lisa said he liked motorcycles. She says he's the first human to see it. He's amazed, it's all glowy and zappy and electric and looks like no manmade engine.

Joshua gets ready to skin his compatriot and can't believe he sacrificed himself. He reiterates the need to protect Joshua and by proxy the Fifth Column since he's one of Anna's closest advisers. Joshua has trouble but his buddy tells him he has to. He picks up a scalpel and rips into his buddy who screams.

Ryan, Jack and Erica poke around the warehouse. Jack calls her over to a surgical tent in the middle of the stacks fo crates. In it are curled up, weird looking dead bodies. Ryan shows them a vial of R6, the ""vitamin shot."" They figure they're experimenting on humans. Erica finds other vials and realizes that the V's are mixing whatever their mojo is into a human flu vaccine. It's set to ship the next day.

The trio exposits no one would be able to tell there was anything wrong with the flu shots and the V shot probably is a vitamin shot and that the government wouldn't worry about our own flu shot when they have to check over the V vitamin shot. She realizes the V's are depending on the human nature of people to run out and get shots. Father Jack laments that they will have to be less human to outsmart the V's. Erica and Ryan say they'll just need to be less predictable since the V's are so savvy. She says they need to destroy the rest of the warehouse full of vaccine. They hear a door open.

Valerie is at the V healing center and being told that her condition can be healed. She was just hoping for a change in meds. The V doctor says the diagnostic also turned up something else.

The V's have returned. Ryan tells Jack and Erica to make a break for it while he runs back to set a self-destruct system. He still has all the V info at his fingertips literally and reprograms the fancy, floating, virtual computer. He's attacked from behind by a V and Erica shoots him dead. She and Ryan exchange a look. Father Jack returns and urges them to skedaddle. As they make it out the door the warehouse blows.

Marcus wants to chat with Chad before he leaves. A V doctor tells him that he has a brain tumor waiting to explode in 6 months. Chad wants to get a second opinion. Marcus and the V doctor explain human technology won't pick it up until it's too late. They ask if he wants a copy of his medical records to take with him. He notes that he didn't give them one. They point out that their technology is so awesome it can not only tell what will happen but what already has like his childhood chicken pox, bronchitis, broken bones and lifelong migraines. Chad is startled, annoyed, and freaked. The good news is they can totally fix it. The bad news? There's a long waiting list. But, says Marcus, they may be willing to work out some kind of arrangement.

A satisfied Ryan, Jack, and Erica leave the scene of the crime. Jack says it may just be a hiccup but it's good to throw a wrench in the works. Erica praises his right hook. Ryan says they made a difference tonight and takes off.

Anna tells Marcus that they're plan is beginning to take hold and Lisa was right about Tyler being the one. Marcus breaks the bad news about the warehouse explosion. The news has spread to other ships and V's are getting antsy. Anna says they'll have to manage the V's fears by reminding them that even with talk of John May and the Fifth Column they have her.

In a long glittery white dress/towel, Anna walks to a glowing white pod. She drops her cover and reaches out and seems to absorb and emit light as she performs some kind of ritual. Whatever she's doing seems to be transmitted on some cosmic interiror Public Address system to all the V's throughout the ships and some on the ground. Her voice saying things like: no need for regrets, the past is gone, no hunger, no sickness, no fear. The words seem to move into the people and make them all blissed out as they look up and seem to glow. Even Joshua takes in the shot of bliss and it looks almost narcotic and orgasmic. She says to bask in her light and take comfort in knowing she's there. Tyler asks Lisa what that was. Lisa says it was a gift from her mother, they call it bliss. She and Tyler kiss.

Ryan returns to Valerie's big news. She's pregnant. Ryan just laughs. They hug and he looks freaked.

At the church Father Jack unlocks a file cabinet and takes out his gun and hears Georgie's admonishment about being a priest or a solider in his head. He locks the gun back up but then hears a noise. Instead of getting the gun back out he just yells ""Father Travis"" and walks toward the noise. An apparently troubled soul wants to talk. Father Jack asks him to leave. The guy says he's desperate. It's a V, he jumps up and sticks a spike through Jack's gut. We hear Father Travis yell ""Jack?"" from a distance and the V runs.

Erica returns home and calls out for Tyler. He's not home. She sees an IM on the computer screen that he was invited to the V ship. She calls him. He ignores the call. Anna and Lisa ask if everything is okay. He says it is and admires the view of the Empire State Building. He says the view of space must be awesome. Lisa takes his hand. He smiles at her. Anna says maybe one day he'll see it and that what he's seen today is only the beginning.

The camera than pulls quickly up out of the ship, into the sky, out to a view of the Earth and then back and back and back through space until it comes down to rest on a visual of a huge fleet of ships, apparently on their way to Earth."

We pick up where we left off, with Father Jack having just been stabbed. He's taken to a V healing center.

Erica leaves Brandon a phone message saying she knows Tyler is on the V ship and he's not answering. She eyes a picture of them in better times in the living room. The same dude that stabbed Jack attacks her. She shoots, stabs, and whacks him with a frying pan. He falls, only briefly and grabs her again. This time she stabs him but good.

In the morning Valerie is making her third omelet and she's freaked out about her appetite. Ryan tells her that it isn't an average pregnancy. She asks what that means. He says, um, your heart condition baby. She thinks she feels the baby move and wonders how this is possible at only six weeks. She's got an OB appointment next week, Ryan seems nervous. Erica calls him and tells him about the attack and Tyler. Ryan comes over and IDs him as the guard from the V warehouse they torched. She asks if he's heard from Jack. Nope. She worries that they're out there searching for the guard. Ryan says he acted alone, trying to clean up his mess before facing Anna. She wants to charge off to the V ship. Ryan says that's a bad idea. He says he's trying to help. Erica says help would be losing the body.

On the V ship Lisa has Tyler's phone as he undergoes some weird V procedure, floating in a cylinder. Anna tells Lisa to blow Erica off until they get what they need from him. He can only have one family after all.

Erica storms to the V center to get Tyler, but he refuses to go home. He claims he's safe and wonders if this is because she doesn't trust the V's. She claims she was worried that he stayed out all night. He says he's not a kid anymore and he'll be home for dinner. She goes to grab him and the image disappears. She's told she was speaking to a hologram and as long as Tyler is a guest on the ship she has nothing to fear.

Chad Decker reports on the destruction of most of New York's flu vaccine in a warehouse.

On the mothership Anna is annoyed at the news but her main toady Marcus says nothing can lead authorities back to them. She tells him to do an investigation and give a tip to the FBI: hand them a villain and some closure. Marcus worries that if the Fifth Column is involved there may be informants on other ships. She says they have to crush them before they become a greater threat. Marcus says they need an army to do that and the fleet she sent for is still on its way. She says she will make him an army.

Erica complains to Ryan. He says there's nothing they can do right now. She should go to work and stay close to the warehouse investigation. She asks again about Jack. Nothing, but Georgie is looking for him. He's going to take the R6 compound to a V doctor and see what's in it. She tells him to find Jack.

Cut to Jack in a great deal of pain being worked on, his wound slowly being closed up. His fellow priest looks on approvingly. Jack sees them grab some R6 and inject it into him. He passes out.

Ryan gives his V doctor the R6 to look over. He's also there because he wants to ask about Val's pregnancy. The doctor is stunned. They didn't think they could procreate with humans. She says she figured nature and faith found a way. He's worried that her heart condition won't allow her to handle it. He admits she doesn't know he's a V. She says if Anna finds out, he, Valerie and the baby will never be safe.

Anna tells Joshua the doctor that the captains of the 29 ships are sending their best soldiers and he should look them over. She asks about the status of the R6. There's still plenty in the healing centers and she says to keep giving it to the humans there. He points out that a lot of humans are afraid to go in them. She says she'll gain their trust by luring in someone they trust.

Cut to Chad looking pensive. At a regular doctor he says his CT scan shows no problem. He says the V's say it will develop. The doctor says even if it did, the problem would be inoperable. Chad wonders if he should let the Vs heal him. The doctor says they don't know the long-term effects yet of the Vs methods. Chad is pensive again.

Georgie goes to the elder father looking for Jack who spills that he was stabbed and taken to a V healing center. Georgie no like.

Erica's boss says no evidence was turned up at the warehouse, such was the heat of the fire. He calls in Malick, head of the V task force, to Erica's consternation. The V's arrive saying they have a device that will show them who blew up the warehouse. Marcus apologizes about Tyler and says they're here to help with finding the cuplrits. The Vs have a fancy gadget that recreates the explosion. He says he can also tell them who did it. He has fingerprints on some C4. They run them and come up with Kyle Hobbes. A big-time most-wanted type mercenary. If it pans out it will be a big win for the FBI. Boss gets all hand on deck.

Erica shows the file to Ryan and he wonders what this guy has to do with them. Erica has the crazy idea of using Hobbes to recruit for the resistance. She is scared and feels helpless. Ryan wonders how they find Hobbes. She says her former partner Dale spent 7 years with the counter terrorist division and his hard drive could help. She thinks Anna chose him for a reason, maybe he's also dangerous to the Vs too and not just a patsy. Ryan says this will be crossing a line they won't be able to cross back. Erica's cool with that saying that since Anna has Tyler she will cross all necessary lines to ""blow that bitch out of the sky.""

Marcus reports that the FBI took the bait. Anna wonders where they are in finding those actually responsible. He says they're on it. She says ""good then I'll eviscerate them.""

On the ship Anna offers Chad some fugu. She wonders why he mentioned the rumors about V involvement in the warehouse bombing. He says it's part of the story and he's a reporter. She notes he hasn't run his piece on the V healing center yet. She says it's important to him as is he and she asks why he won't let the Vs heal him. He says he's fine and you can't diagnose the future. She says it's real and wonders why she won't let her help him. He says she always want something. She says he does too. She tells him to run the piece. He asks what will happen if he doesn't. She says sinister stuff about the fear of living with the concept of sudden death.

Father Jack wakes with a start. Erica, Georgie, and Ryan say he's healed. Jack says something is wrong with him. He says he can feel the R6 inside him. Suddenly his skin starts changing. Then he really wakes up to just Georgie who wants them to hotfoot it out of there.

Erica does research on Kyle Hobbes. She goes to a house and shows her badge to a video camera. A man on the other end grabs a gun. She heads up the stairs to a sparse loft workspace. She and Hobbes confront each other with guns. Ryan backs her up. Hobbes asks who she is. She replies she's his only chance for a future.

Erica exposits how she found him via Dale's files. She tells him about his prints on the bomb in the warehouse. He scoffs at this and tells them to prove that he's being set up. She calls her boss Paul with a tip that she thinks she found Hobbes' location. She hangs up and tells Hobbes that he can either take off with them or get busted by the FBI. The FBI busts in and there's no one there. They just missed him. Erica pulls up and asks where he is. Paul says gone, someone tipped him off.

On the V ship Tyler is still on the floaty bed and we see what he's seeing all sorts of vision and memories of his mom and his childhood. Lisa watches. Anna asks if they found what they're looking for. Lisa says there's so much. Anna says human memories contain emotion not just information which is why they're hard to interpret. Lisa wonders why they're memories aren't like that. Anna says it's because they're minds are efficient and not burdened by emotion. We see nice and sad memories from Christmas to his dad leaving. Anna says they have to get Tyler to calm Erica's fears and loosen her bond with him and then Lisa will be free to fulfill her destiny. Lisa likes this.

Tyler tells Anna and Lisa that he loved being in the memory chamber. Anna tells Tyler to go home to tell Erica that he'll be fine. He's starting his own life and she won't lose him like she lost Tyler's dad.

At the church Jack, Ryan, Georgie, and Erica try to convince Hobbes to work with them. He says he's not interested in any cause. They all explain they have a personal stake in this war and that the Vs are here to annihilate them. Hobbes is like yeah, yeah, show me the money or I'm walking. Ryan says he will show him the truth instead: that Vs may look and sound like you but they are not. He pulls back his eye and shows his real V lizard eye. Erica also points out that the Vs framed Hobbes, isn't he curious why. Erica gets a message that Tyler is on his way home for dinner. Jack comes in and Erica says she got the guy who stabbed him. He asks after Tyler. She says he's okay. She asks after him. He says he's fine. She asks if he's lying. He admits he feels like something has changed inside him. She says they're all changing, she just made a deal with the devil (Hobbes) and she doesn't know what she's thinking. He says she's thinking about protecting the ones she loves. As she leaves Jack says it's good to see a friend.

Ryan goes back to the doctor and she tells him that to a human test it would appear to be a saline shot but with V technology she learned that it's a molecular compound that embeds itself in human DNA and sends out a wavelength. Ryan realizes it's sort of a high tech tagging device. The doctor says she hasn't told anyone and neither should Ryan.

Joshua looks over many people looking over screens with candidates for the R6 trial, including Father Jack.

Chad runs his report on the V healing centers. He admits his diagnosis and says he is taking the healing cure. Anna likes. Marcus tells her Hobbes escaped the FBI. She realizes that Hobbes can help the humans build an army and it's time to build their own.

Joshua addresses the many soldiers from the 29 ships and how the ""queen"" commands they be awesome. Anna enters and looks them over. It seems like she's smelling them. She looks at one and says ""him.""

Erica is reframing the picture she broke while fighting with the V assassin. Tyler enters and they hug. She asks if he's okay. He says yes. She asks if he knows what he put her through. He apologizes and tells her that he's not going to lose her and he will always be there for her even though he's growing up. He says he needs to be completely honest. He shows his peace ambassador uniform. She looks at the embedded camera and says she's not afraid of the Visitors but of losing him. He says she won't and to trust him. She says ""no more secrets about the Visitors okay?"" He says they don't have any. Lisa watches.

Valerie is eating yet more eggs and goes to toss what she doesn't want. She finds a dead mouse by the trash can in a mouse trap. She looks like she might want to eat it before she freaks out and tosses it in the trash. Ryan enters and she says something's not right and she's been eating all day and had weird cravings. She says she never told him this: she always wanted kids but when he said he couldn't she thought he was more important than kids. She thinks the baby is a miracle and happened for a reason. He agrees.

Anna in a robe walks around the selected solider in a cloud of mist and moisture. He appears naked. She straddles him and pushes his head to one side and lays her head by his head. There is a glowy yellow thing floating near where they're joined. Moments later she says their done and an army will be born from this union. Now, however, her eggs need nourishment. She opens her mouth and a scary set of fangs/teeth protrude out and she swings her head to eat the soldier."

Anna's giving one of her blissed-out speeches to the V masses but at least one Visitor on the Sydney ship isn't having it. He's trying to shake awake his girlfriend from her hazy happy place. When she won't rouse he says at least Anna won't have her anymore and takes out a shiny orb, lets it hover in front of them, and clasps her hand as it explodes in front of them, killing them and presumably other Vs on the ship near them.

Anna watches the footage and is not amused and Marcus points out that several similar suicide attacks have happened like this one on other ships, which they believe to be the work of the opposition group The Fifth Column. She says these V's are starting to feel human emotions and it's time for a loyalty test to eliminate the traitors before they get stronger and goes to ask Joshua to whip one up.

Tyler watches news footage of Chad before school. Chad's talking about Anna's pending announcement that the Vs are launching a ""live-aboard"" the ship program. Tyler muses he wishes he could be there. Erica says it's a school day, but noting his jacket and the eyes peering within, she's super calm and says he can go to the ship later.

Marcus holds a press conference pre-announcing the ""live aboard"" program which heralds a new V-human level of interaction. Georgie and Father Jack are there and figure it must be related to the R6. Georgie sees Chad and calls him their ""mouthpiece"" and perhaps they should ask him what the Vs are up to.

On the way into the church Erica tells Ryan she can't keep Tyler from the ship. He says she has to in order to keep him from being tagged. They meet up with Hobbes, Jack, and Georgie. Hobbes wants to know where this Fifth Column army is already. Georgie and Ryan say they're out there and there are a lot of them. Hobbes says it's time to wake the sleeping giant, by hacking into Anna's announcement and letting them know that it's time to mobilize. It's decided Ryan will go up, even though he's nervous that it's a suicide mission. Erica says Hobbes needs to think of a better plan.

At the OB/GYN, Ryan's secret V doctor lies to Valerie that everything looks normal. She pulls Ryan aside and assures him it's not normal showing him the real ultrasound of their baby not the fake one she showed Valerie. Ryan is worried about her. The V doctor says she needs phosphorus badly, and the only place to get it is on the V ships. Ryan is now ready to head to the mothership after all. The doctor warns him that once he doses her with it there will be no going back.

Hobbes, cleaned up in a suit, glasses, and FBI badge waltzes in to Erica's office undetected to prove the point that what they need is an inside job and he thinks he can do it. She wonders why he's in such a hurry. He's mad at the Vs for setting him up. He says they don't need Ryan. Ryan arrives and says he's all about it now.

Anna is in a chair being shown visions of horror, pain, and sadness. She tells Joshua to use her lack of reaction - of situational empathy- as a baseline for the test and to test everyone on the ship. Those who fail are clearly Fifth Column and should be eliminated.

The gang creates a fake identity for Ryan- a V diplomat- and get him a sweet V jacket, papers, and fake prints. He says if they don't hear from him by 4 p.m. they'll know there's a problem. Georgie tells him to be careful. Ryan says he will and give him his OB's card and says if anything happens to him to take Valerie to that doctor and tell her the truth about him. Georgie agrees.

Erica drives Georgie somewhere and they both fret, about Ryan and Tyler. She says she's going to take Tyler to someone who he loves more than the Vs.

Hobbes meets with a woman in the cemetery and he hands her a package. She has background info on his ""Fab Four"" Georgie, Ryan, Erica, and Jack.

Erica takes Tyler to his dad in Georgetown, CT. Tyler is psyched to be there and tells his dad just that. Tyler apologizes and says he knows it's his fault that he and Erica split up, his motorcycle accident. Dad assures him that it wasn't his fault and he's a good kid. Dad wants to know why Erica is really there. She asks him to take Tyler, citing her insane work schedule because of the Vs. He says she's always busy at work and wants to know what's really up. He says it might be time to tell Tyler who he really is. They play Tyler just right and instead of forcing him to stay, Dad asks if he will so Tyler asks Erica if he can. She, of course, says yes.

Ryan goes to visit the ship and after getting the phosphorus he's nabbed by a security goon named Samuel. He's dragged off to the test and fails. Joshua reveals himself and says Samuel, the goon, is also with them. He tells Ryan he needs to skedaddle so he can rally the others on the ground and he himself will put the Fifth Column message into Anna's speech.

Georgie goes to visit Val claiming he's dropping by to see Ryan. He sees that she's pregnant. He asks if she's heard from him. She hasn't. Georgie leaves with a clear plan.

Father Jack goes to Chad and asks him why he waited to get healed after getting his diagnosis. Chad says they're doing a five part series for sweeps. Father Jack says that some people are concerned that the Vs might be ""doing something"" to the humans that they're healing and that he hopes Chad will keep an eye out for anything hinky. He wishes him well with sweeps and gives him his card.

Later, Chad seeks out Father Jack at his church wondering why he thinks there's something suspicious about the Vs. Jack says he has a hunch. Chad wonders if he should jeopardize his career over a hunch. Jack says Chad obviously has one too or else he wouldn't be there.

Georgie calls Erica and says he hasn't heard from Ryan and was thinking of going up to the ship. Erica tells him not to but we see that he's already on a shuttle.

Anna goes to Lisa and tells her it's time to corral Tyler and get him on the ship.

Erica meets up with Hobbes and Jack and discover that he went up to the ship. She's pissed that Hobbes allowed this to happen. He also gave him a weapon. Jack and Erica are mad but Hobbes says that a realist would know that Ryan's more important than Georgie and if Ryan is in trouble it's acceptable to sacrifice Georgie to save him.

And he's right, Georgie creates a distraction that allows Ryan to get off the ship. That distraction includes stabbing a V though and gets him grabbed by security just as the doors shut on Ryan's shuttle.

Joshua is successful in getting the message into Anna's speech. As she's announcing the program the video goes screwy and the message ""John May Lives"" appears on the screen. The gang is happy to see it. Anna is also kind of happy when she hears about it since, she says, it will bring out the Fifth Column and make them easy pickings for destruction.

Ryan goes home to visit Val who mentions Georgie's visit. He winces and says he has to go back to work but first he wants to make her a nice cup of tea. He doses her tea and heads back to meet up with the gang.

During Ryan's visit Marcus and Joshua do more tests and unveil more test failures. Anna arrives and Joshua says there's a margin of error. Marcus wonders if the false positives mean they should stop testing. Anna says to keep it up and she'll deal with the failures. She gathers them all together and hands them each a pill. She says those who are truly faithful to her know what to do. Half of them take the pill and evaporate instantly. She says those were clearly the loyal ones and the others must be Fifth Column and to skin them.

When reunited with the gang Ryan is livid at Hobbes and says he better hope they get Georgie back alive. There's no more shuttles to the ship tonight so they'll have to wait 'til morning. Father Jack suggests praying.

Erica is bummed about leaving Tyler. She and father Jack agree that at least he's safe. Cue the knock at Tyler's dad's door and when Tyler opens it, it's Lisa. She says she missed him. He looks happy to see her.

Later that night in bed as Valerie and Ryan sleep, Valerie turns over and we see her fetus swimming inside her and it clearly has a tail.

In tonight's installment we finally meet the leader of the Fifth Column John May, who one night ten years ago was sought out by the Vs at his home in Reedsville, New York and got into a fight with Ryan who back then was still vehemently on the V side.

In their race to save Georgie-who is holding steady under torture- Erica, Jack, Hobbes, and Ryan head to Reedsville to look for a communication device, hoping to enlist the help of May's stepson.

Anna hopes to nip the Fifth Column uprising in the bud by convincing Chad to start convincing people to join the live aboard program.

Lisa meets with Tyler's dad at the country house and tells him that she's just checking up on him since his situation has been hard since his dad has left. Dad is concerned. At breakfast Tyler swears he slept on the couch and that Lisa's appearance was a surprise to him too. Tyler asks if it's okay if she hangs with them. Dad says sure.

In an interview Chad asks about the ""John May Lives"" message in the recent V communication. She calls it a glitch in the system and moves quickly to talk about the live aboard program.

In the torture chamber Georgie refuse to give up names, instead he tells them the names of his family members killed by Vs. A new torture doctor pours ""scours"" on him. As they're name implies they are evil, entering through the eyes and attacking the nerve centers in the body. He finally says he will give them the names they want.

Marcus tells a group of sleeper agents to be on the lookout for Fifth Column insurgents.

They arrive at the May homestead and Dad, Joe, calls Erica to inform her that Lisa is there. He says he's having a hard time with Tyler not knowing the truth. She says it's a bad time and she will call him back soon. Joe says Tyler needs to know that he's not his father. Lisa overhears this bit of intel.

Erica confesses to Jack that Joe isn't Tyler's father. He says doctors don't know everything. Erica says Joe never believed her that she didn't cheat.

Valerie is freaking out that the baby is already kicking. She leaves Ryan a message because she wants to get in touch with their OB. Looking through his pockets she finds a secret door in the closet that leads to a safe, that she clearly didn't know about.

At the May residence the gang meets with James May, John's stepson and his wife/girlfriend. Ryan and Jack siphon him off. Ryan flashes back to seeing John in the past. He came back to the May house, secretly armed, and was invited in for dinner. In the present James says he's not interested in talking about his dad. Jack and Ryan tell him they're part of the new V resistance. James doesn't want to hear about it, he says his dad kept all his stuff in a storage unit in town and says that John killed himself. Ryan says John's suicide note was fake.

In the kitchen James' wife Grace banters with Hobbes and Erica and she reveals herself to be a V. They fight and Hobbes and Erica kill her. James runs in and freaks out at her nutty lizard hands. They decide to hit that storage unit. Some sort of homing device goes off over Grace's body in the kitchen.

Georgie lied, the new name he gives them is the name of his unborn child his wife was carrying.

Marcus tells Anna that Georgie is stronger than expected. She tells them they have to dig deeper than scours.

At the storage unit they search while James wonders about his sleeper agent wife. Ryan finds the comm device. A V scout arrives, one of those blue orby things with spikes. Hobbes shoots at it. Ryan calls it a seeker. Erica shoots it down. They figure out it was James' watch that had a homing device in it.

They decide to subject Georgie to emotional torture, showing him the murder of his family. He screams for them to turn it off.

Tyler and Joe work on a carpentry project. Tyler's dad goes to get some sodas. Tyler tells Lisa that his dad wants him to stay a few weeks.He says he'll still see her but this visit might help him sort some stuff out. Lisa tells Tyler what she overheard. He scoffs. Joe comes back and, with anguish, confirms it and shoots daggers at Lisa. He admits this is why he left Erica. Tyler asked if he felt duped for raising someone else's kid. Joe says he loves him, either way and that he should talk to his mom. Tyler says he will.

Chad works on his healing center story, watching footage of a woman rhapsodizing about the healing centers.

Ryan contacts Joshua and asks him to find Georgie. He says he will and to keep the comm device close. James asks if the suicide note was really fake. James calls him a bastard. Ryan says John didn't abandon James, he was forced to. He asks him how he would know. Ryan says because he's the one who forced him to leave. He flashes back to his last encounter with John. John tries to convince Ryan that he too has been touched by human emotion as he writes the suicide note. John says, like humans, he has found his true north with his family. Ryan says it's too late and that ""they're"" waiting for him. In the present he tells James and the gang that ten years ago he killed John May. Dun dun dun!

The gang is understandably confused and upset. Ryan says he wishes he could go back but that he learned everything he believes from John May and the message that ""he lives"" is a dagger in Anna's eye. He apologizes to everyone and Erica says no more lies.

A man from the safe company comes to hit the reset button for Valerie who successfully opens the safe.

Chad comes to chat with Anna again and tosses pictures at her of potential live aboard candidates- they all have common issue, infertility, bad health streaks, broken toys he calls them. Chad wonders why they're interested in these people. Anna says she sees the inner worth of people and Vs and that she wouldn't just discard them like humans would He gets right in her face and says he's not buying it and if he can uncover stuff like this in half a day imagine how far he would get with more time. She asks what he wants. He says he doesn't want to be ordinary. She says he isn't ordinary. He says that's why he'll keep digging until he has enough interesting information to run the healing center story, unless she gives him something bigger to run with. He says he can protect her but the question is can they keep helping each other? She says she thinks they'll be helping each other for some time to come. He leaves.

Back at the church the gang waits for news. Joshua calls and says Georgie is alive and hasn't broken. He can't help him now under all of this scrutiny but that he might be able to smuggle him out during the beginning of the live aboard program. Georgie tells them that he's better and he's glad they're safe. Ryan promises to get him out of there. Georgie says no, it's what the Vs are waiting for and that they'll get caught. Ryan tells him to hold on. Georgie says he can't and wants to speak to Jack. Jack tries to tell him to hang on. Georgie says he'll see him around and that he's ready to see him family now. Jack blesses him. Joshua looks pensive and then grabs a big syringe and gives him a lethal dose of V juice. The comm device winks out.

In the morning the gang has a stiff drink and toast Georgie over New York newspaper headlines asking who John May is.

Ryan flashes back to John May's funeral. He sat with James that day and quietly consoled him. Valerie approved.

Ryan calls Valerie and leaves a message saying they need to talk when he gets home saying they need to talk because he's not who he says he is. He says there will be no more lies. As we see him leave this message we watch Valerie go through the contents of the safe which includes fake passports and her real sonogram.

When Erica gets home Tyler tells her he knows. Erica says the doctors were wrong and Joe is her dad. He wonders why she didn't tell him. She thought he wouldn't believe her either and she hoped someone would tell her it was wrong. He runs off to his room and she cries and says ""it's not true.""

Ryan arrives home and Valerie is gone, the closet cleaned out as well as the safe.

On the V ship Anna watches news coverage about John May. Marcus tells her Georgie is dead and they learned nothing from him. He says the Fifth Column message has produced a ground swell. She says they can have this one victory because she's about to deliver them a thousand defeats. We see her in some kind of pool with little white egg-like lights swimming towards her."

Chad and Anna travel to Geneva for a political forum at which she plans to present to the world the gift of ""Blue Energy"" which she says offers answers to some of the world's most pressing problems.

The secretary-general head is skeptical of her presence and doesn't want her to present anything. Speaking to Chad off the record he says the V's ""gifts"" are a drain on the world's bottom line- healing centers are ruining health care and their technology could imperil other industries. Chad thinks he's more worried about commerce than the health of people and the poltician says they're intertwined.

After seeing news of a devastating monsoon in ""Timbal"" Anna has Marcus send V troops to bring them Blue Energy in an effort to show up the politicians who are still trying to organize their relief response.

It works as planned as Blue Energy restores the power in Timbal. The politicians relent and let her present at the forum. She holds up two little balls and pushes them together. This creates blue and white waves throughout the room that says represent ""clean sustainable energy."" She says it's the same power that runs their ships. She takes the balls apart and it stops. The group applauds. She says the V needs are simple and her desire to help is genuine. The leader shakes her hand and says they have much to learn from her.

Chad asks him for another off the record comment. The politician, still clearly skeptical, says Anna came under the guise of bringing a gift and played the politics of tragedy to gain clout. He asks if they're just ""visitors"" why does she need political clout?

Chad comes to the ship and confronts Anna about her savior-dom and asks what would've happened if there hadn't been a tragedy in Timbal. She says there would've been one somewhere else. He says she thinks she's a god. She asks that what makes him. He says a believer and he believes they're not visitors but here to stay but why, for the benefit of Vs or humans? She says to help. He says he wants to be part of doing good if that's what they're doing. She says she needs people she can trust. She asks if he trusts her. He doesn't answer.

Later Marcus wants to know why they're giving humans Blue Energy. Anna says so they can turn it off once the humans are dependent on it.

Back on the New York ship Lisa fails the empathy test admitted by Joshua. She says it must be a mistake, that her assignment to make Tyler fall in love with her distorted the results. He says too bad, Anna said anyone who failed was to be immolated without exception.

On the ship Tyler- who is still mad at Erica- finds Lisa and she says it's a bad time. He's upset and she's empathetic to that. He says he really needs her and to be away from home right now. Her too, she says. They take some kind of small spaceship into the stratosphere. Tyler floats the idea of joining the live-aboard program. They make out. She makes sure they take off their prying-eye camera jackets. The moment of truth upon them Tyler asks if Vs, um, ""do this."" She says no and then proceeds to do it anyway.

Joshua and his Fifth Column buddy debate over immolating Lisa. Joshua's against it thinking she can be a great asset to the cause. He's known her forever and thinks she may be becoming human. The other dude says they'd never be able to trust her and wonders if it's a trick to test Joshua's own loyalties.

Tyler and Lisa return to the main ship and Joshua says Anna's coming back and wants to see her. Lisa says Tyler has to go. He says he'll see her tomorrow and she just says goodbye.

Anna tells Lisa that the future of their species depends on Lisa's leadership and judgement. She says there is no room for human emotion or weakness of any kind. She hands her an egg from the nest that has the growing army of soldiers in it and breaks it between their hands. She says Joshua told her she passed the empathy test and that she never doubted her.

Lisa confronts Joshua and he says one day he'll ask a favor from her and she'll comply.

Through an FBI investigation Erica and the V-hunting gang learn that the Vs have killed another Fifth Column cell. One guy survived the attack- Alex Caruso. After Jack visits his dad in the hospital they track him down. He's freaked. He explains he's Fifth Column and they set up a meeting after seeing the message on the ship. The V showed up and now they know names of other FC peeps thanks to an FC website. Since there was a hard drive missing Erica knows the Vs have the info and thinks they'll pick 'em off one by one. Hobbes want to avoid that by using Caruso as bait. Erica doesn't want to kill, but interrogate when they catch him. Alex is up for it. Jack is bummed since he promised Alex's dad he'd keep him safe but he suits up.

Ryan says the Vs are usually about close combat with knives but when they set Alex as bait at an amusement park they send a sniper who kills Alex. Erica runs him down. He gets the upper hand but Jack shoots him and, to their horror, they discover the assassin is human. Tied up for interrogation they ask him why he is working as a hired killer for the Vs and he says because there's no way the humans can win.

Ryan- who has been looking for Val since she took off after discovering Ryan is covering something up- has Erica trace her cell phone. She traces it to a V healing center. The V doctor scans the baby, freaks slightly but then says it's not serious. Val wants to see. He won't let her. Ryan comes in and kills/immolates the V just as he's about to harm Val. They take off."

He says the Vs told him they'd kill his wife and daughter if he didn't kill who they wanted. She asks who else was on their hit list. She wants to know who knows about Fifth Column. They don't believe him when he says he doesn't know.

Val and Ryan race through the streets outside the healing center. She wants to know why he attacked the doctor. Standing on the street he confesses that he's a visitor. She doesn't believe him at first, but he tells her the visitors want their baby.

On board the New York mothership, Anna welcomes the humans for the live aboard program. She's interrupted by Marcus telling her about Val's half-human, half-V baby.

Anna tells Marcus finding Val and Ryan is his top priority.

At their house, Val doesn't want to go along with Ryan, but he tells her the Vs have infiltrated everywhere and they can't trust anyone. He says they'll kill them if they find them. Just then two Vs break into their house. Ryan fends them off, killing them. She sees one of them cut through to their V-skin and suddenly realizes that's what her baby might look like.

Anna convenes with the top Vs from all 29 ships, pissed that it turns out Vs and humans can mate. She says it puts the species at risk and the Fifth Column could breed a species of hybrids to fight them. She wants them to speed up the live aboard program and commence extraction of their human residents immediately.

She wants the mother and father dissected and the baby destroyed.

Ryan takes Val to see Dr. Leah Pearlman, the V doctor. Val guesses that she's a visitor and Leah admits it. Val's mad at Ryan for lying to her. Val says the Vs gave her a vitamin shot at the healing center. Turns out it was R6 - a way for the Vs to track her. Leah has a shot that can mask the tracking, but it takes 24 hours to take effect. Val takes the shot.

Leah tells Ryan there's nothing more important than the baby.

Ryan calls Erica to update her. He says he's going to stay with the Thompsons, some old friends in the country, and won't be back. Leah goes with them. He urges her to tell Ty the truth about the visitors.

Chad gives his report on his brain aneurysm and the Vs plan for surgery.

Erica comes home to talk to Ty and finds him watching something about the church of V. She tries to talk to him, but he runs off to meet Lisa.

Anna tells Lisa she needs Tyler to be part of the live aboard program and remain on the ship until he's no longer needed. And then.... (she doesn't answer, ominously).

Anna is briefed that their doctors are already experimenting on the humans. Marcus tells her about the two visitors Ryan killed. She orders him to release a soldier, even though none has ever set foot on earth. Marcus is to follow him every step of the way.

In the basement, Kyle breaks out the heretic's fork, a medieval torture device, and is about to use it on Barnes when Father Jack returns and tells him that until they know for sure he's lying, they'll treat him with decency.

Joshua's call from the mothership comes through.

Lisa greets Tyler with Anna. He's psyched about the program, but knows his mom won't like it. Anna suggests Lisa stop by later and reassure her.

Father Jack relays Joshua's news, about the soldier after Ryan and Val. But they have no way to contact them. Erica says the prints are back on the sniper, he's ex-military like Hobbes thought. She's heading to his house, hoping for a Fifth Column list to help them contact Ryan and Val.

Ryan gets reacquainted with the Thompsons, who have a cabin in the Adirondacks they can use.

Marcus finds their R6 signal wasn't working, but the soldier has found them.

We see a bad-looking V outside the country home.

On the mothership, Chad undergoes his procedure as the cameras roll. He's not cut open, instead lasers whip around his head and his brain is accessed on a computer screen.

He wakes up to Anna telling him his surgery was a success. He thanks her. She says she wishes all humans shared his sentiment, which of course gets him to ask if there's a problem. She tells him about Fifth Column and he offers to run a story on them.

Erica visits Barnes' wife. She says their daughter was paralyzed from the neck down -- but just then a girl walks into the kitchen, fine. She says the Visitors healed her.

Erica asks to use the bathroom but instead goes poking around upstairs. In an office she finds an external hard drive and takes it.

Back in the basement with Barnes still hung up, they get a few names and partial addresses from it, including Thompson. Barnes says he won't help terrorists and the Vs didn't have to ask him to kill for them. Erica tells him he has innocent blood on his hands. He says they don't believe in fighting, so people like him have to do it for them.

Erica asks again where the Thompsons live. She says either he'll tell her, or eventually he'll tell Hobbes. Hobbes suggests Father Jack leave the room.

Later, Hobbes joins Erica and Father Jack in the car announcing that he knows where the Thompson's farm is.

In the farm house, they're getting ready to leave when the lights go out. Mr. Thompson passes out shotguns.

Mr. Thompson is working his way through the house when the soldier drops from the ceiling and snaps his neck. Mrs. Thompson goes down next.

The soldier uses his special V Soldier hearing and listens for heartbeats in the house.

Ryan leads Val and Leah down the upstairs hallway when suddenly the soldier busts through the ceiling onto Val. She gets free and Ryan takes the soldier on. The soldier gets in a few good licks and knocks Ryan down when Erica and Father Jack bust in the door and shoot it. It runs off.

They run for the car, where Val and the doctor are waiting, and the soldier follows. As it runs around the corner of the house, Hobbes sticks an ax in its chest. The soldier is knocked down, but seems unfazed by what should be a mortal wound.

They drive off, leaving the soldier there.

At a train station, Ryan explains that soldiers are bred to fight from eggs Anna laid. They say their good byes to Ryan.

Hobbes says he knows some people who can disappear Barnes into a secret prison overseas. Erica doesn't object.

Ryan joins Val and Leah to get on the train. Val doesn't want him to come with them. She doesn't want to see him again. She doesn't forgive him and says he was only protecting himself. She says good-bye.

Chad visits Father Jack. He tells him he thinks Anna is keeping secrets from them. He mentions the Fifth Column. Father Jack says he hasn't heard of them. Chad says he's worried about the visitors and wants to know he's not alone. Father Jack says he'll let him know if he hears anything.

Marcus tells Anna they lost the hybrid baby. She tells him to keep looking. Chad comes to see her. He says he might have something for her on the Fifth Column and will let her know. She's pleased.

Erica has a stiff drink at home alone. The doorbell rings. It's Lisa. She says looking for Tyler and asks to come in and wait.

Erica makes her tea. Lisa says Tyler has learned a lot from the Vs. She casually mentions the live aboard program and Erica tries to contain her rage and fear. She says she feels like Tyler is slipping away from her and she wants him to be happy. Tyler comes home.

He has flowers for Lisa. She asks to talk to him. She tells him she doesn't think he should do the live aboard program because his mom really needs him. He says he doesn't want to stay there. Erica can hear him. Lisa says she should leave and goes.

Tyler confronts his mom, asking what she said to Lisa. He doesn't believe her when she says nothing. He tells her he's moving up to the ship and there's nothing she can do about it.

Lisa tells Anna that Tyler won't be doing live aboard because his mom needs him. She tells Anna she can be more effective if she has Erica's cooperation. Anna flinches, but says she trusts Lisa's judgment.

Kyle Hobbes marches Barnes deep into the woods. ""First you're going to tell me everything you know about the Vs,"" Hobbes says, ""then you're going to beg me to kill you."""

6:00 p.m.

A V shuttle is arriving in the woods. Hobbes shoots it down with a a surface-to-air missile. Jack, Ryan, and Hobbes run to the wreckage and discover it had human beings on it.

Erica looks at bloody crime scene photo at the FBI headquarters. Everyone's phones start ringing. Ryan calls Erica and tells her there are no survivors. They flee the scene.

On the mothership Marcus informs Anna the shuttle was successfully shot down as she expected. They planned it as a frame up job of the Fifth Column.

Twelve Hours Earlier

Ryan investigates his trashed apartment. Joshua calls and tells him Anna is sending a V shuttle filled with trackers to find Fifth Column. Ryan says they'll shoot it down. Joshua says they need V technology to do that and he will supply it but they need to move fast.

Erica walks in on Father Jack working out on a heavy bag and jokes he's dropping his right. He asks if she can do better. She can and does. Hobbes enters and says it's like ""The Thorn Birds"" up in here. They chat about favorite boxers. Hers is Sugar Ray Leonard. Ryan enters and explains about the V tracker shuttle. He says the trackers are like soldiers with super senses but they can blend better. He explains about blowing up the shuttle. Erica is concerned. So is Hobbes but more from a PR standpoint, since it will make them seem like terrorists. Ryan thinks Anna will keep it from the press to contain the damage since Joshua swore no people would be on it. He says they have to shoot it down in order to preseve their anonymity. Erica gives the go ahead.

Chad returns to visit Father Jack at St. Josephine's. He says he knows in his gut it's not safe for humans to be so trusting of the V's with regards to the live aboard program. He says he wants to join the fight with the Fifth Column. Jack says he hasn't heard anything. Chad says that's too bad since he has an all-access pass to the mothership, Anna, and the V-only shuttles. He says he could be a big asset to the FC. Father Jack tells him to stay away from the V-only shuttles today.

Lisa happens upon a young mother with her baby crying over a nightmare from the night before. Lisa asks her what's wrong. The girl says in the dream she was taken by doctors and poked by hundreds of needles. She says she knows it was a dream but it felt real. Lisa comforts her. (Anna watches this on video).

Chad approaches and Anna thanks him for his report on the live-aboard program. He tells her there are whispers of a threat to the V-only shuttles. She tells him he's come a long way since they met. She asks who his source is. He says that's not how it works, he has to protect his sources. She understands but says there are no V-only shuttles today. Marcus enters, Chad leaves. She tells him they haven't tamped down on all of the Fifth Column on the ship since word of the trackers got out. Marcus says he'll investigate and wonders if they should still send the trackers. She says she has a better idea: if the humans want to blow up a shuttle, they'll let them.

4:45 p.m.

The gang assembles and Hobbes says he got the V code. Father Jack is worried about doing this. The other say they have to.

We fast forward to the moment of the shuttle destruction and the call to Erica.

Erica freaks and calls Tyler, praying he'll answer. He does. She explains about the V shuttle. Tyler flips on the news and he's now freaking that Lisa might be on the shuttle. She tries to reassure him. He says she might be wrong about who was on the shuttle. Boy was she.

Various law enforcement teams investigate the scene. Erica walks through in a daze.

Back in the basement headquarters they try to figure out how it happened. Ryan doesn't know and says Joshua is trying to figure it out. Father Jack is especially upset saying they either value life or they are just like V's. He asks Erica where she is with it. With him, she says. Hobbes says they have bigger problems now since they might not have made a clean getaway. Father Jacks says he's out and stalks off. Hobbes talks about his favorite boxer, someone who was knocked down a lot but always got up. He asks if they want to be the guy who gets knocked down or the one who gets back up.

Tyler arrives at the ship and asks Anna if Lisa is okay. She is. Anna is impressed with is commitment to Lisa. Tyler says he'll do the live-aboard program. Anna says Lisa will be pleased and tells him to go home and pack so he can return and be with Lisa all the time.

Erica's boss Kendrick asks where she was when she returns. She explains about Tyler. He says he wants her on it especially since it seems Fifth Column-y. Malick has a tire tread and some forensice evidence and they have toll booth security footage they can comb through.

Erica goes to work and calls Ryan about the toll booth. He says they did drive through one. She gives him the info and tells him to wipe the toll booth video footage. As she looks at other evidence on her monitor she realizes that the bodies found at the scene were people who were already dead. They didn't kill anyone after all. The Vs filled the shuttle with dead humans. He asks if she has evidence and she says she's looking at it. But as she says this the file disappears saying it has been permanently deleted. Ryan wonders who would do that and Erica checks and it was Kendrick who she sees putting on his coat and saying he's headed out to work on the toll booth footage. Erica tells Ryan to get moving now.

In a race against time Ryan and Hobbes manage to destroy the footage on servers at a security facility just as Kendrick arrives.

Chad goes to visit Father Jack. He asks about him protecting him by telling him about the shuttles. Jack says he was just passing on a rumor. Chad says he has to report on this attack to keep his position intact and be an assest to the resistance. He says he has to come down on hard so if Jack is Fifth Column things are about to get very hard. Jack says it's a good thing he's not FC. Chad says the FC caught Anna off guard. Jack can't believe he asked her about it. He says he did it indirectly.

Anna is recording several takes of a message talking about Vs valuing life. She tells Marcus she's pleased that the FC will now be considered terrorists just as she planned. Lisa enters. She asks which take is better. Marcus says they both seem sufficient. Lisa says the second one seems more sincere. Anna notes her grasp of human emotion seems pretty good. Lisa thanks her and leaves.

The older priest comes and asks Jack if he's okay. He says his faith in himself has been shaken. The older priest tells him to get back to his core values. Jack says he's made terrible choices. The elder priest thinks he means the war. Jack says he doesn't. If it's a matter of law maybe he needs to make a different kind of confession the priest says.

Ryan calls Erica and says the footage wipe was a success. She hangs up as Kendrick walks up.He says he had luck. Even though there was a footage wipe they figured the terrorists had done a dry run earlier in the day and grabbed that footage and got a suspect. Kendrick leads her to interrogation and says it's not your typical terrorist. He opens the door and Father Jack is sitting there looking guilty.

Kendrick interrogates Jack about the tire tread and video. He says he can read the guilt in Jack's eyes and is giving him the chance to unburden himself. Jack is about to say something when Erica pounds the table and demands that Jack answer him. She asks Kendrick to bring in some crime scene stuff. When he leaves she quickly fills Jack in on the V set up and tells him to look scared. Kendrick and Alex return with a picture of the tire tread. Jack gets all huffy and says there are thousands of vehicles in the church fleet with those tires and he was on a public parkway visiting a parishioner whom he was counseling about her adultery. He hopes that they have more to go on in such a high profile case then tire treads and toll booths. He tells them to charge him or let him go. Erica gives him a sly smile. Kendrick tells Alex to cut him loose.

Lisa enters a door with some odd writing on it and sees the corridors and doctors described by the pregnant woman earlier and sees a woman placed on a table and with hundreds of needles poking in to her as doctors look on. She says the faces of others this was done to.

Later she goes to visit Tyler. She tells him she doesn't want him to move on to the ship with me. She says he's a nice guy but she doesn't feel about him like he does about her. He gets mad and says that's not true. She says her mother likes him and she didn't want to disappoint her. He asks about what they shared on the shuttle, what that was about. She says she just wanted to see what ""it"" was like. He tells her to go. (Obviously, she's protecting him. She's not wearing her V jacket.)

Anna gives her press conference talking about how they value life. She mourns over the shuttle attack and the lives lost. She says their biggest flaw may be that they're too trusting. She demonizes FC for demonizing them for being different. Kendrick watches and tells Malick to get on the ship and reassure Anna the FBI is doing all it can. Anna continues at the conference saying the V's are considering leaving since humans are getting caught in the crossfire. She says they are always of peace and seems on the verge of tears. As she turns she gives a sly smile to Marcus.

Erica goes back to look at the computer log of the file being deleted. Kendrick calls her in to the war room to talk FC. He says he's not letting anyone or anything else harm the Visitors and he's starting a task force to investigate FC. He wants her to head it up and no expense or resource will be spared and she'll be partnering with Malick.

Malick goes to the mothership to talk to Marcus. She gets Anna instead. It turns out that she's a V and she's the one who delted the damning photos using Kendrick's passcode. Malick tells her about the task force and that she's now ready to serve their people and track down FC with the full weight of the U.S. government at her disposal.

Ryan, Hobbes, and Erica watch a Chad report about sympathy for the V's and talk about sticking together. Jack arrives and explains about warning Chad and says he could be an ally and that he's been careful. Hobbes is mad that Jack brought all of this on and them and says they can't trust anyone. They talk about the value of life and not stooping to actual terrorism. Hobbes says they can call it what they want but it's what they are now. Erica says they're the only ones willing to do it. Hobbes welcomes Jack back.

Erica arrives home and Tyler apologizes about going behind her back. He admits Lisa was just using him and he's really upset. She consoles him.

Marcus tells Anna world leaders have been calling offering condolences, to help find FC since they're afraid the Visitors will leave. Anna is pleased and plans to use their fear against them. Lisa comes and tells Anna she failed in getting Tyler to live aboard. She says she pushed too hard and pushed him away and that his mother's pull was too strong. Anna says she understands and that they'll need to find a better incentive for bring Tyler in. She then punches Lisa in the face. She says she will tell Tyler she was injured in a FC attack and that there's no greater incentive for a man than a damsel in distress. She turns to a doctor and tells him to break her legs. Lisa doesn't look happy."

In a dark alley a dumpster diver finds Lisa's broken body. Erica and Malick investigate, she is surprised to see its Lisa. Malick asks if Tyler knows she's a V. Erica says she doesn't know. Erica goes to her and says she'll find out who did this to her: they also carved a""V"" into her face. Erica asks if she recognized the ""men"" who hurt her. She flashes back to her mom hitting her and says no. Erica hugs her and says it's going to be okay.

Anna watches this from the ship and says it's time for Joshua to go down to the healing center to fix Lisa's legs but not her face. She says she wants the world to see what the Fifth Column has done to her daughter since a picture's worth a thousand words.

Hobbes watches news on Lisa's assault and is surprised to seek sketches of the suspects include one that looks like him.

Chad also watches a breaking news report that Anna is going to make an announcement. A colleague can't believe this is how Chad, the ""voice of Vs"", is getting the news like everyone else.

At the church Jack and Father Travis have a full house praying for the Vs. Jack is worried they're praying more for the Vs than themselves. Father Travis tells him to try and find room in his heart for the Vs like his parishioners have.

At the hospital Erica shows mug shots to Lisa, including Hobbes and some other dude with glasses. She says she's sure these are the men who attacked her. Anna arrives and Erica is shocked to hear Lisa is Anna's daughter. Anna pretends to be loving and caring and concerned.

Erica takes her aside to talk and Anna reall pours it on as she looks at the pictures of Lisa's injuries. She can't believe the Fifth Column is terrorizing people as humans have accepted them. Erica shows Anna the mug shots, she says she's never seen these men before. Anna asks about Tyler. Erica says he's heard and is very upset. Anna says he's lucky he wasn't with Lisa when this happened. Erica agrees. Anna says as a mother Erica must empathize. Erica, pointedly says, as a mother she knows if anyone tried to hurt her son there's nothing she wouldn't do to stop them. Anna says then she's sure Erica will find the perps before they hurt someone else's child.

At Fifth Column HQ, Jack and Ryan confront Hobbes, who says he didn't do it and he is being framed again. He says the last time the Vs framed him he had been hired to kill the other guy named as a suspect, glasses guy Lawrence Parker.

We switch to FBI HQ and get the rundown on Parker: a weapons engineer, CIA analyst, went missing four weeks ago, has top secret access. Kendrick thinks Hobbes is the key and they need to find him. Erica suggests the go for Parker, a civilian, instead. Kendrick says she better be right.

Tyler goes to FBI and asks after Lisa and apologizing for not telling her that Lisa was a visitor. She takes Ty to visit Lisa who is having her legs fixed by Joshua. Lisa didn't want him to see her like this. He says he needed to know she was okay. As they speak, Joshua introduces himself to Erica in the outer room. He tells her that the two perps are innocent and that Anna inflicted the injuries to Lisa. Joshua says he doesn't know why but the two framed men have answers and she needs to find them before Anna does. Erica asks if Tyler is in danger. Joshua says that at first Tyler was an assignment but now Lisa's feelings are real and that he doesn't think she would hurt him.

Lisa says she didn't mean the things she said to Tyler about not wanting to see him, she was confused because she's never had feelings like this before.

Anna arrives and puts on Lisa's shoes and says it's time to go. She and Tyler hold hands until the last moment. Erica looks at her lovestruck son sympathetically.

A group of V supporters stand outside the healing center. Chad spies Marcus coming out and asks why he wasn't consulted on helping to control the story. Marcus says Anna has been indisposed. Marcus says they already have it under control. Anna emerges with Lisa and says not to look at the cameras or give eye contact because the less she gives the more poeple will want. Chad tries to get Anna's attention. She whispers to Marcus they're cutting Chad off for now but will bring him back when the time is right. She steps to the podium and reveals that this terrible hate crime has been perpetrated on her daughter. She says they came in peace and offered healing powers and energy and have been repaid with this attack and because of that now they're d leaving.

At FC HQ Ryan says they're lying. Hobbes agree and says she's putting on a show. Ryan points out that she could've healed Lisa's face wounds and didn't. Erica wonders what Anna's interest is in Hobbes and Parker. Hobbes doesn't know. Erica thinks Parker is key. Hobbes also thinks she should ask Tyler if the ""lizard princess"" told him anything. She doesn't want to. Ryan thinks bringing him into the FC may be the best way of protecting him. She ignores this.

Hobbes goes to his shady lady friend and is tipped off that Parker is holed up in Chinatown. Hobbes tosses his apartment and steals his hard drive. He calls Erica and gives her the deets.

Chad goes to the ship and Marcus tells him Anna has been too busy dealing with the assault and the exodus to talk to him. Chad doesn't believe they're leaving. Marcus says they have to. Chad says he can help by swaying his viewers to protest. Marcus says he's a journalist, tasked to reporting the news not editorializing.

Marcus goes to Anna and she says they have Chad right where they want him: desperate to have them stay for his own career and ready to skillfully persuade his viewers. She tells him to have the Shanghai ship take off immediately. It does.

Later we see a ""special commentary"" from Chad who says the Vs saved his life and humans who care about a better, more peaceful, technologically advanced world should make it known they want the Visitors to stay.

Ryan and Jack sit outside Parker's place and Jack asks Ryan what's wrong, why he's been different since Val left. Ryan says John May convinced him that human emotions were good but now that he feels so bereft without Val he's not sure if it's true and he can continue the fight. Jack says he can if he has faith.

Erica joins them in the car and tells them to cover the front and back if Parker tries to bolt.

She goes to the apartment and ID's herself as FBI. Parker he says he disappeared because someone came after him and even though he didn't assault Lisa he's running because he's afraid. He isn't sure why the Vs are after him but tells Erica he's been working on an organic compound that was supposed to help with global warming but had bad side effects, algae that caused viruses in amphibians and ... yup, probably lizards... so the project was abandoned. He points out someone stole his hard drive and all his research. Unfortunately it's useless without his colleagues collaborative research, they worked separately so as to be indispensable. So whatever it is- and there are green discs in his briefcase- could kill the Vs. Erica pockets one of the discs.

The FBI roars up outside and Jack calls Erica to warn her. She gets Parker to give her the names of the people who were researching the compound with him and says she will do what she can to help him. She then drops and cuffs him just as the Feds bust in. Kendrick says it's nice work on Erica's part but Malick is suspicious that she was there already.

A V shuttle leaves the White House.

Parker is brought into FBI. Kendrick says the White House has persuaded to keep the Vs on earth. They also want to form a joint human-V task force in which suspected FC terrorists would be remanded to a V ship for questioning starting with Parker. Bad news for Parker.

Erica calls the three musketeers and reports that all of the scientists on Parker's research project are reported missing. Ryan thinks Anna has them. Erica says they have to hold on to Parker somehow, she hopes to get through to Lisa. They're worried about this. Erica says if Anna is going to use Tyler she will return the favor.

Anna, Lisa, and Marcus arrive and Erica pulls Lisa aside for ""prep"" to confront her attacker. She gives Lisa a picture of Tyler to bring in with her for the line-up to give her comfort and strength. She tells her that this man's fate rests in Lisa's hands and that she cannot condemn an innocent man and she needs to be 100 percent sure. Lisa is about to spill and then Anna busts in.

Lisa goes into the line-up and points to Parker. Erica asks if she's sure. She says she's positive. They depart with Anna's thanks to Erica. Parker is hauled away. Erica says that stopping the FC will be her first priority. Anna says they're bound to cross paths again. Erica says she's not going anywhere. Anna says neither is she.

Hobbes is on the phone to someone saying he has Parker's research and wonders how much the person on the other end is willing to pay.

On the ship, Anna thanks Chad for his report. Chad calls Anna on manipulating him into making that plea. She says all she cares about is peace and the safety of her people. She wants his help in rooting out FC and wants his FC source. He says that would be a breach of his journalistic ethics. She said he already did it once today, what's one more time? She says she's looking out for both of them.

At gang HQ, Hobbes says he's worried about Ryan's moodiness. Ryan says he's on his game and for Hobbes to stay on his. Hobbes gives a speech about special op soldiers and how they don't carry family photos or mementos because if someone discovered them they'd be used against them. Hobbes knows the Vs hit Ryan where it hurts regarding Val and the pain he's feeling will be used against him by the Vs and that in war emotions will get him killed and to burn memories of Val from his heart. Ryan leaves.

On the ship Anna and Lisa survey the eggs of Anna's army, it will be born soon. They're gross and squishy and ""Alien""-like. Anna commends Lisa on how well she did today. Lisa promises to keep Erica close and convince her that her kind feelings toward her are real as she did with Tyler.

Lisa goes to Joshua and asks if the eggs are allowed to hatch the soldiers will they destroy the FC? Joshua says they will.

Tyler watches a news report on Parker's arrest. Erica returns and Tyler says she's a hero. So she's heard she says. He says her catching Parker means a lot to him and he thanks her. (He thinks she assaulted Lisa, remember?) Tyler wants to make sure Erica is okay with him dating a V. She admits it's a little weird but she'll deal. He thanks her and walks off. She calls him back and says he was wrong about the Visitors and he would like to get to know Lisa and Anna better. He likes this idea. She looks a little sick.

Marcus reports that the fleet from their home planet will soon be in radar range. Anna says they'll make sure human technology doesn't pick it up. He says fear of the FC is spreading among the 29 ships. She says they just need their queen to assuage their fears. She sends out another bliss missive. Joshua and Lisa exchange glances.

Ryan looks at a picture of him and Val and starts to get the Anna message, he looks up and soaks it in. He then shuts the blinds. His phone gets a text from Val's doctor. ""Val's water just broke.""

One of the soldier eggs begins to hatch.

A car with tinted windows pulls up in an alley. Marcus is inside. He is meeting Hobbes who says Parker's research is in a safe place and Marcus can have it when Hobbes gets what he wants: a bunch of money and a clean slate with the Vs. Marcus departs without agreeing to anything."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648873/?ref_=ttep_ep12,,Erica decides they need to make a statement about their opposition to the Vs. They decide to go aboard the mother ship and destroy Anna's eggs which are about to hatch and produce her army of warriors. She has an opportunity to get aboard the spacecraft when Tyler once again raises the issue of joining the live aboard program and Anna and Lisa invite them for dinner. ...

It's go time on the ""V"" finale.

First up a V soldier finds Val, and abducts her back to the New York mother-ship.

Tyler extends the dinner invite from Anna to Erica, so her fears can be assuaged about the live aboard program.

The gang decides this is it: Erica will use her dinner invite, to get into Anna's private quarters and kill the soldier eggs, with a nifty explosive devised by Hobbes. Hobbes will distract Marcus. They contact Joshua who likes the plan, but is cut off before it can be finalized. Father Jack says he'll send a message to him via Chad. Ryan is planning on going to help too, until he receives word of Val's abduction. Instead of helping he goes to the visitor center, and causes a ruckus, so he will be taken aboard. When he arrives he, and Val make up and he tells her to let the V doctors help deliver the baby. They do and the baby and mama are doing fine. Anna shows up and kills Val. Ryan is allowed to come in and mourn Val. Anna returns, and won't admit to killing her. Ryan grabs her neck but she pushes him off, and says it's his fault for not bringing Val in sooner. Anna tells Ryan the pain he feels, is what she was trying to protect him from, human emotion. She's sorry he lost her but says he now has her. She then grabs him for a little one one on bliss session. It works, she brings his baby to him, a tail pokes out of the blanket, and she welcomes Ryan home.

Hobbes lures Marcus, with the promised research from last week. However, he claims he only has half to keep the bargaining upper hand. He asks why the V's have been framing him. Marcus says they did in order to hire him, and whether he knows it or not he's been working for them for years already, he just didn't know it. Since they know he's a man with a history of selling his loyalty to highest bidder, they want him to infiltrate Fifth Column. Hobbes asks what happens if he says no. Marcus says he won't because they found ""her"", and shows Hobbes a picture of someone he obviously cares about although we don't see it.

Father Jack gives Decker the message and tells him to leave it in the medical lab. Chad dutifully goes to Anna, who tells him to go ahead and deliver the message in order to see what happens. Chad goes to medical to deliver the message to Joshua saying it's from a friend on the ground. Joshua says he has none. Joshua's crony freaks and says they have to send a message to Erica to know the mission is still on. He does, thinking it's a quick one that can't be traced. It can however, security comes in, and grab Joshua's colleague and isolate Joshua for Anna to deal with, surrounded by blue cylinder of energy.

Chad goes back in to medical, and Joshua realizes he set him up, he tells Chad he will be skinned alive. Chad doesn't believe that saying ""Anna wouldn't do that."" Joshua says ""he's been blinded, and that the humans are in danger."" He informs him that the Fifth Column will save humanity. He adds for good measure, that Anna didn't cure his aneurysm, she gave him one. Chad still can't believe it. Joshua gives him the directions to a restricted corridor, where he'll see what's being done to humans. Chad goes a hunting, and finds the secret hallway He sees the Live Aboard humans being tortured on the, spiny tables

Erica and Tyler arrive for dinner with Anna, and Lisa. Erica gives up her gun, and is forced to give up her purse with the explosive. The quartet has a pleasant meal, over which they discuss single motherhood, and Anna claims to be impressed by Erica's juggling. She promises they'll take good care of Tyler. Erica asks if the ship is safe from the Fifth Column. Anna says it is, and pours Erica some wine. Erica gets a call, claiming it's work, she walks out. Lisa follows, and says she knows why Erica is there. She hands her a blue energy grenade which, if placed properly, will destroy the eggs.

Lisa, now firmly on the Fifth Column's side, goes to Joshua, and gets him out of isolation. She calls him very brave, and touches his face. He thanks her, and calls her his queen.

Dinner is interrupted by security, that needs to take Anna to safety, because there's a Fifth Column attack under way. Erica asks for her gun, and Anna okays this. They all go running off. Erica runs off to the egg pool. She tosses the grenade, and runs. It explodes, and throws her through the door.

Outside there's pandemonium in the halls, with people shooting at each other. Erica wants to save Joshua, but he says she has to kill him, to keep suspicion off herself. She does, reluctantly.

Later, Anna thanks her for saving lives. She also mentions the person Erica shot wasn't a V, but a human who infiltrated, and stole a uniform.

Anna spies Chad she heads over, and thanks him for delivering the message. He keeps playing the part, and claims he's glad they won't be driven out. She thanks him for his loyalty, and says without them, he'd lose everything, and sweetly threatens his job, and health.

Anna returns to Erica, who offers thanks for the fun night. Anna suggests they do it again sometime, and Erica assures her they can count on it.

Meanwhile back at the church, the older priest has come across Father Jack's homily which is anti-V. The older father says, ""They're a miracle, and maybe they are god's handiwork."" Father Jack says he's going to speak from his heart. The older priest says no messages of hate, will come from his pulpit, and tells Jack to write a new homily, or find a new church to preach in.

Erica and Hobbes show up in time for homily. Erica thanks Hobbes for coming through with distracting Marcus. Fearlessly Father jack preaches his homily, about the Vs, and how humans should only serve God, and calls the Vs ""false prophets."" He wonders who will stand with him, and help fight the coming war. Most of the parishioners leave, but a few stay standing with Hobbes, and Erica. The older priest warns Jack that ""this will end badly."" Father Jack looks willing to risk it. Chad arrives, and gives Jack the nod, they exchange understanding.

Anna and Marcus and Lisa survey the frozen eggs. Anna is bereft, and asks, ""Are they all dead?"" Marcus replies, that ""only 12 soldiers survived, and that their core temperatures were so greatly affected, they are not sure how many will make it."" Anna instructs Marcus find out who else beside Joshua was responsible, at whatever the cost. She cries and screams. Lisa is taken aback. Anna is freaked out by herself and asks ""what's happening to me?"" Marcus says, she is experiencing her first human emotion. Lisa gets a sly Anna-like smile at this thought.

Anna goes to her monitors and calls on the other ships to come forward. Marcus warns against deploying their ships too soon, going as far as to grab her arm to try and stop her. When she completes the command, Marcus asks, ""Do you know what you have done?"" Anna replies, ""Vengeance"". As the scene progresses, we see a map of the Earth, with V ships deploying all over it, they appear to be releasing an unknown red chemical, into the atmosphere. The sound of thunder rolls, and music plays as Father Jack, Erica, Kyle, and Chad, all respectfully notice the sky turning red. Anna observes this as Lisa walks in and looks in wonder, as to what is happening. As the music continues we see that V ships have arrived over, Los Angeles, California, Hong Kong, China, and Florance, Italy, all cities appearing to have a Red Sky. The scene then shifts to the New York Mother-ship's Medical Bay. V doctors, under the apparent supervision of Marcus, revive Joshua, who suddenly awakes, and takes a deep breath. Marcus looks at him with a seemingly pleasant smile, and says ""Welcome Back"".

The episode ends with Anna surveying the skies. Lisa is looking on, from behind her, from her quarters on the New York Mother-Ship which is seen hovering over New York's Central Park."

She answers an ad for a doctor in the Colorado territory, hoping to continue practicing medicine on her own despite her gender and mother's lack of support.

When she arrives in Colorado Springs in 1867, she is met with derision and hostility by most of the townspeople except Charlotte Cooper (Diane Ladd) and ""mountain man"" Byron Sully (Joe Lando). Charlotte is matron of the local boarding house and struggling to support her three children, Matthew (Chad Allen), Colleen (Erika Flores), and Brian (Shawn Toovey), after her husband skipped town with their savings.

Sully is a reclusive loner who befriended the neighboring Cheyenne and adopted their ways following the death of his wife and daughter during childbirth in 1865. (He is also a sensitive hunk who throws a mean tomahawk.) Charlotte helps Dr. Mike acclimatize and they bond. Sully offers Dr. Mike his abandoned homestead to live in and she accepts. Charlotte, also the town midwife, calls upon Dr. Mike to help with a difficult delivery, and she successfully performs a ""radical"" cesarean section.

Charlotte is bitten by a rattlesnake and on her deathbed asks Dr. Mike to care for her children. Dr. Mike begins to have more success with the townspeople as a female doctor, but continues to experience hardships and has trouble winning the hearts of the Cooper children. Brian runs away and Sully helps Dr. Mike find him.

She is hit especially hard after failing to get a shipment of medicine in time to treat Maude Bray, who suffers a fatal heart attack. She is hurt and upset by a discouraging letter from her mother which she shares with the Cooper children who finally realize she will be a loving mother and raise them properly.

After the army carries out a vicious surprise attack on the Cheyenne, Sully brings the grievously injured Chief Black Kettle to the homestead, and Dr. Mike saves his life. When he leaves, Chief Black Kettle gives Dr. Mike her Cheyenne name, ""Medicine Woman"". The town grudgingly begins to accept her as a woman doctor. A surprise visit at the homestead by Sully on Christmas Eve shows Dr. Mike that she has found her place in the new frontier and inherited a loving family."

Matthew wants to give to them some food, but Ingrid's brother, Jon, insists on working to mend fences to 'pay' for food. Brian and Sully go hunting and find an injured deer, which Brian takes a special interest in, asking Dr. Mike to 'fix her.' In the process, Brian wants to name the deer after Sully and asks him what his first name is. ""Byron"" is the reply. While mending the fences, Jon notices the many cattle. When one comes up butchered, a mob comes after the immigrants, finding some of the meat in Jon's tent. He gets to the church, seeking asylm. After the mob wants to hang Jon, they put out an ad for a sherriff. The gunslinger, Cole (Cash), ends up getting the job for the salary of $0.50 a day.

All the while, she is trying to convince the local women's group to get their children vaccinated for small pox, running into interference from Olive, the headstrong 'leader' of the group. Harriette, one of the mothers in the group, came over to Dr. Mike's house to vaccinate her children in the cover of darkness to hide it from the others in the group, and she appeared sick with a pain in her stomach.

She takes him into town also and does an exam on him while the body is being prepared. During the ceremony, several of the townspeople are whispering amongst themselves. Afterward, Micheala finds out that the boy named Zack, was the child of a whore. He had lived with her at the saloon until she died when he was five.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0617921/?ref_=ttep_ep0,,A writer in need of a job reluctantly agrees to work for her father's women's magazine.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Philip Charles MacKenzie'],[''],[],[],[],"News reporter Maya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo) is working at her desk when news anchor Christy (Emily Proctor) demands her to edit the copy for self serving motives. Offended and annoyed, Maya jokingly retypes the copy to read -gang violence is down since last year and they tell me they credit the decrease to removal of the frontal lobe of my brain and in a related story I wet myself- subsequently Maya is fired.

We catch up with Maya again three months later where she has come back from a job interview. Her roommate Wally (Chris Hogan) shares some good news about a potential date as Maya shares her news about a promising interview with Newsweek. Sadly, Wally informs her that she received a message that she didn't get the job based on her references. Wally talks Maya into visiting her father Jack Gallo (George Segal), owner and chief editor of Blush fashion magazine. Maya has not seen her father in a year because he married a much younger woman that went to school with both her and Wally.

When Maya arrives in the Blush lobby, a gaggle of very tall, beautiful, and slender models are being assessed by fashion editor / former supermodel (Noxzema Gotcha Girl) Nina Van Horn (Wendy Malick), and sexually harassed by executive assistant to Mr. Gallo, Dennis Finch (David Spade). Maya tells Finch she is there to see Jack Gallo and is quickly put down. She then approaches Nina and is also put down but with a quick come back puts Nina in her place. Finch quickly seizes the opportunity to suck up and directs Maya to Jacks office.

Jack is pleasantly surprised to see his Maya but they are interrupted by Elliot (Enrico Colantoni), who tries to tell her that Jack is always talking about her and that he is so happy to finally meet her; Elliot is quickly discovered to be a liar when he inadvertently calls her Myra instead of Maya. Nina enters the room regarding a model dispute with Elliot and the dispute is settled by Jack.

When Elliot and Nina leave the room Nina has an opportunity to speak with Jack only to find that he already knows her situation and is more than happy to give her money. When Maya tries to offer a way to pay him back, Jack suggests writing an article for the magazine. Thinking she is a serious journalist Maya turns it down but then changes her mind when Jack says it will be a good way for them to spend time together.

No sooner do the words come out of his mouth when a call comes in that his wife Ally is in the hospital delivering their baby. Maya is upset as she had no idea and stays to write a negative article about her - father the jackass- .

Nina and Finch peer over the desks at Maya discussing newly discovered information about her such as - Maya is a Stanford Graduate, was on the deans list, has no current boyfriend, and is on the pill - Nina fears that Maya is trying to take over the magazine as Elliot joins the conversation.

Later, Elliot asks Maya her opinion about photos of different models for her article and soon discovers that she is a feminist who is opposed to messages models send to young girls. Elliot is lured away by model Lorena (Shannon Maureen Brown), who is in search of Pellegrino. The discussion resumes as Elliot proves a point that everyone enjoys looking at beautiful things.

As Maya collects her check, Finch notifies her that she has a new baby sister. After reality sinks in, Maya goes to the hospital to meet her new sister Hannah, and congratulates her father. Although happy, Jack is afraid to make the same mistakes he made with Maya. Maya reassures Jack that all Hannah needs is her fathers love and time. Jack talks Maya into helping him run the magazine so he can have more time for his new family. Maya agrees."
