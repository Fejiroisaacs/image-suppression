Pete Martell (Jack Nance) leaves home to go fishing. Before he arrives to his destination, he notices a bundle of plastic in the riverside. Immediately, he phones Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) through the nosy phone operator, Lucy Morgan (Kimmy Robertson). Harry is the sheriff of the town, and he immediately tends to the crime. There, the photographer, deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) is crying while taking the photos of the corpse so the coroner has to take charge of the task. When they finally turn the body over, they see it's seventeen-year-old Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee).

Back at home, Laura's mother, Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) is calling out for Laura, but of course she's not there. Sarah phones several people asking for her whereabouts. Harry visits Laura's father, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) who is trying to sell property to some foreign visitors. Sarah realises that ""her baby"", as she calls Laura, is dead when Leland says that Harry is looking for him.

At the local café, Double R, Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) teases a co-worker who is being picked up by her secret lover. When the couple leave together they see a police car in the opposite direction. They both feel terrified when they watch the huge lorry. Back at the police station, Leland has to identify the body of his dead child.

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) arrives to high school acting all cocky. He is Laura's boyfriend and is immediately summoned to be questioned. Laura's classmates react in different ways to her death: Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) cries sincerely but Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) seems not to care much. Bobby is the main suspect as he didn't go to football practice that day, and nobody saw Laura after Bobby left her. The principal announces through the loudspeakers to all the high school that Laura is dead and ask students to come forward if they know what Laura did after classes yesterday. Bobby says that he loved her, and that he's innocent.

Laura's diary is found. The mother remembers Laura talking on the phone, but she can't be sure of what time it was. Another girl hasn't come back home. Katherine Martell (Piper Laurie) doesn't want Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) to stop the sawmill for the day because of the death of Laura and the disappearance of Pulaski's daughter. Pete finally obeys Jocelyn. That other girl Ronnette ""Rony"" Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine) appears half-naked, walking numbly with the remains of rope around her wrists. She looks horrible.

Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) arrives to Twin Peaks. He is a weird character who is amazed by the corns of the land and is constantly talking to some ""Diane"" in his speakerphone -- or is that a tape recorder (it is unclear). The coroner hasn't prepared the report on the second girl, who is at hospital from exposure. The girl is not responding at all, so Cooper watches her fingernails closely. A psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn) doesn't want Cooper or Truman to tell Laura's parents that she was watching him. Cooper finds something deep under one of Laura's fingernails. It is a very small square letter ""R.""

Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) shows Donna a handwritten note saying ""Meet me at the roadhouse after 9:30"". Donna was Laura's best friend. Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) wants Donna only to console him. Cooper read Laura's diary: there is a person with a ""J"" mentioned. The last day Laura wrote about a key to a deposit box within an envelope and pasted that key into the diary. The envelope had some white powder on it. Cooper says that it's a reference to cocaine, but Harry says that Laura wasn't that kind of girl. Cooper shows a video found at Laura's room. Bobby says that he quarrelled with Laura, but he didn't kill her. Laura appears in the video exhilarating, happy, half-dancing. Bobby says that he doesn't know who she was seeing. Cooper replies that he didn't love her anyway.

Audrey is really pissed off for all the attention to Laura, even in her death. She interrupts the symposium for the sale of property, and everybody looks at her. Bobby is furious and he blames some mysterious biker, and he threatens to bust open that biker's head. Bobby is released by his rich parents. Laura and Donna had gone on a picnic on their own, but somebody had to take the pictures. Donna says it was a female backpacker. Cooper thinks that Donna is protecting the mysterious ""J"". In the recording of Laura, in one of her eyes, there is a reflection of part of a Harley Davidson motorbike which Cooper has found out. Meanwhile, Audrey is happy because she has spoilt the business of her father Benjamin Horne.

Cooper and Truman find half of a necklace with a gold heart, some bloody remains and a scrap of paper in which it was written with blood ""Fire Walk with Me"". James Hurley (James Marshall) looks at the other half of a gold heart necklace similar to that. At the deposit box, Cooper and Truman find 10,000 dollars and the magazine Flesh World . Ronnette Pulaski and the lorry from which the two coffee goers were afraid of also appears in the magazine.

Leo Johnson (Eric DaRe) is jealous of Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) because of some different-branded cigarette butts. Cooper and Truman give a public speech. Dwayne Milford (John Boylan) stummers in the mic. Cooper says that Laura was the second and Ronnette the third victim of a killer who he has been trying to catch. Meanwhile, he recommends a curfew to everybody younger than 18. Donna wants to leave home anyway and her sister Harriet (Jessica Wallenfels) will cover up for her. However, as Mike and Bobby come looking for Donna, her father realises she's not there. Both youngsters go to look for Donna to the roadhouse, while Dr. Will Hayward (Warren Frost), Donna's father, calls the police.

At the Roadhouse motel bar, Twin Peaks theme song is sung. Donna arrives. Mike and Bobby are waiting there for her. Mike frightens Donna, who gets hysterical. A bar brawl ensues, and the Biker takes Donna away from there. Donna tells James Hurley (James Marshall) that the police are looking for him. Laura said to James that she was really different to what everybody thought of her. She was afraid of somebody. Donna says that she knew Laura better than she thought, and she kisses James passionately. Donna advises James to give back the other half of the golden necklace. James and Donna bury the other half together and put a stone on top of everything. James takes Donna home. Cooper and Truman had been following James and he now stops him. When Donna says that James didn't do anything, Cooper says that she is right. In spite of that, James is put into prison, where Mike and Bobby have been imprisoned - thankfully in another cell. Donna's father doesn't tell Donna off, because he knows she did what she did for a very good reason.

Cooper asks Truman for some advice concerning an inexpensive motel, as he is going to stay around for a while. Jocelyn kisses Truman passionately and Katherine tells somebody on the phone.

Laura's mother wakes up from a nightmare. At that very same moment, the other half of Laura's necklace is taken from under the stone."

FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is met at the motel restaurant by Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) while having ""a damn fine cup of coffee"". Audrey says that she didn't use to appreciate much Laura, but she used to be kind to her Johnny (Robert Davenport), her emotionally-damaged brother. Post-mortem shows that Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) had had sex with three different men.

James Hurley (James Marshall) was the freak who was secretly going out with the home queen Laura, who didn't want to split up with Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), the successful football player. She had started doing cocaine again some days before her death. Donna is in love with James, who remembers how Laura gave him half of her golden heart because she could believe that he was really love with her. Cooper frees James - in custody of his uncle Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill), Bobby and Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger).

Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) thanks Pete Martell (Jack Nance) for supporting her in front of his bitchy wife, ambitious Katherine Martell (Piper Laurie), who wants to rein in the sawmill. Jocelyn is also questioned. Jocelyn has inherited the sawmill from her late husband Andrew, but her sister-in-law only cares about money. Katherine talks to her lover about her plans to get control over the Packard sawmill.

Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) is still in shock over the death of Laura when Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) goes to speak with her. First, Sarah thinks that Donna is Laura and hugs her. Then, she sees a man who stares at her and she screams hysterically. We don't know whether Ed's affirmation that his beer has been drugged has anything to do with that or no.

A one-armed (Al Strobel) man leaves the hospital. Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) tells Audrey Horne off as she has damaged irreparably the real estate deal the Hornes had taken so long to prepare.

Coulson) approaches them to say that the log saw something the night of Laura Palmer's death, and that Cooper should interrogate it.

Later, Benjamin leaves to a kind of brothel where all the ladies wear the same kind of red boustierred uniforms. That night, there is a new girl (Connie Woods) there, and it's implied that they have sex at the One Eyed Jacks, the weird brothel.

At the same time, Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and James Hurley (James Marshall) kiss each other, completely enraptured in love.

FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) receives an anonymous note left outside his hotel room saying ""Jack with One Eye"".

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) go find a buried football. They cannot pay Leo Johnson (Eric DaRe) the full amount because late Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) had the other half of the money, 10,000 dollars. That night, however, Bobby realises that there is somebody else with Leo, a man who hides behind a tree. Leo had beaten up Shelly (Mädchen Amick) so she has bruises all over her face. Bobby tells Shelly that if Leo ever hits her again, he will kill him.

Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) stains all over the place, and his wife Nadine (Wendy Robie) tells him off because of that. Cooper tells the police of a dream he had which inspired him a way to obtain information. Officers Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) and deputy Tommy 'Hawk' Hill (MIchael Horse) are present.

If he hits the bottle, Lucy Morgan (Kimmy Robertson) will make a note on the blackboard. When Harry reads the name of Leo Johnson, connection with Laura Palmer unknown, Cooper hits the bottle and it breaks to pieces.

Audrey starts dancing to the dreamy tune of Twin Peaks in the middle of the diner floor.

That night, Dale Cooper dreams about Mike and Killer Bob (Frank Silva), two weird figures who talk to him. Mike quotes the sentence ""Fire walk with me"". Cooper sees himself at One Eyed Jacks, talking to a The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) and a Laura Palmer look-alike dressed in black who makes him the sign of having cocaine, touching her nose with a finger.

She is exactly like Laura Palmer except for huge ugly glasses and dark hair. She visits Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) first while having a check-up. Cooper and Truman visit Leo Johnson (Eric DaRe), who is cutting wood. Leo says first that he didn't know Laura. Then he says everybody know her. He says that he was with his wife Shelly (Mädchen Amick), and that she would confirm his alibi - It's implied that Leo is a wife-beater, and they were at hospital.

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and his father, strict Major Garland Briggs (Don S. Davis) talk about the meaning of life. While they are arguing, Betty Briggs (Charlotte Stewart) - the wife and mother respectively - appears and talks to them nonchalantly, as always, as she is a woman who wants to pretend that everything is all right in her family.

Albert says that Laura was tied twice in two different ways in two different places. There are traces of cocaine and other drugs. Cooper refuses to sign Albert's conclusions, as he won't leave until the murder of Laura Palmer gets clarified.

Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) hears half-disbelievingly Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie)'s visions concerning Laura and her necklace. The person who doesn't believe Sarah at all is her own husband, Leland (Ray Wise). Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) knows that Sarah is not hysterical or imagining things.

Lucy Moran (Kimmy Robertson) is watching attentively to her favourite soap opera, so Truman has problems communicating with her even the easiest questions and instructions. However, one of Truman's deputies seem to be quite interested in going out with her. When they talk about it, Lucy is not against it, but they don't set a fixed time and date.

Special Agent Dale Cooper from the FBI (Kyle MacLachlan) tries to get some information about Lauras' addiction to cocaine from her doctor, Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), who believes that many of the problems of our present society have to do with sex in one form or another. He says that Laura had many secrets, and that she would not even share them with him. Cooper says that Laura had sex with three men the night she died, and asks Jacoby if he was one of them. Jacoby says he wasn't, and he also denies to have been her murderer. She talks about a man who visited her that day, but he can't say anything else.

Cooper go to a motel looking for Mr Jerard, who happens to be the man with only one arm (Al Strobel). At first, it looks like they are going to interrogate Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie), who is with her lover Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) in another room of the same motel. He says that he was at the hospital to check on a friend. He lost his arm going from Memphis to some place in a car accident. His job is to sell shoes, so he has a suitcase full of samples.

Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) talks to Donna, and she boasts about leaving that dead city with a man. Donna laughs it off, but Audrey has plans concerning the findings about Laura's death. She intends to discover who killed Laura, and Cooper will take her with him when he leaves Twin Peaks. Donna offers to help her as long as they will keep their investigations and their results secret for the time. Audrey agrees, as she needs help to investigate the brothel at the other side of the border.

Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) visits her husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) at jail. He's asking for parole, and has to convince the parole officers (Mary Bond Davis, Mary Chalon and James Craven). She will give her own husband a job at the diner, as she is the owner. They will also live like husband and wife for the time being, as they are not divorced yet. With all those conditions, Hank Jennings' case looks really positive for him. Hank is turning and turning a dominoes chip.

Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick) is trying to make love with Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) as Leo Johnson, her husband, is with Jacques Renault. Bobby tells her that Leo and Jacques were smuggling drugs -cocaine- across the border, and that they were probably passing them onto Laura. Shelly decides to confide on him about the bloodied shirt of Leo Johnson's. Bobby takes the shirt, as he immediately realises that that is a huge clue. He is about to leave, but Shelly doesn't want him to go without having sex with her first, so she shows him a loaded gun.

Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) admits to Lucy that he had dropped his gun when they were looking for Gerard. Lucy is despondent and doesn't seem to care much. In the shooting alley, they give an examination to Deputy Tommy ""Hawk"" Hill (Michael Horse) and Andy. Hawk passes with flying colours, but Andy is such a disaster, that Cooper orders him to have some practice an hour a day three days a week, until he knows how to use his gun well.

Shelly tells her boss that Leo beats her frequently. Norma just tells her to cheer up. Shelly says that she has ""definitely plans for Leo"" and Norma suggests a beauty day for them both. James Hurley (James Marshall) phones Donna. She tells him to call on her to discuss some things. James promises to go, but Donna has to hang up fast because her father is calling out for her. James Hurley, who is at the diner, cannot refrain from talking to a girl and asks who she was. It is Laura Palmer's cousin, Madeleine ""Maddy"" Ferguson (Sheryl Lee) , who has memories of visiting Laura and pretending they were sisters because of their similar looks, except for the fact that Maddy is a brunette.

Audrey asks her father Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) he is really ashamed of her. He says that he is not ashamed, but that he wishes that he could count on her more. She wants to help him with his family business. She wants to start from the absolute bottom and quit the idea of going to college. She wants to start at the store, in the beauty parlour, at first part time until she graduates from high school. Audrey finally changes her ways and says she wants a future for herself and her future family. Her father receives a call, and asks the person at the other side of the line to meet him discreetly. It's such a secret call that he pushes her daughter away so that she would leave the room. Audrey realises that something odd is going on.

Cooper and the police officers find a new clue and go after Jacques Renault. Bobby Briggs jumps from a window of Reno's room. They find the Leo's dirty shirt because Bobby brought it. Benjamin meets with Leo Johnson (Eric DaRe) at night in the middle of the night. Leo owes 10,000 dollars and has got Bernard Renault dead in a brown paper package, tied down. Benjamin tells him to become more ambitious. James and Donna go to the place they buried Laura's necklace, because Donna is worried about Sarah's having those visions and watching somebody take the necklace. James suggests telling the police, but Donna insists they keep it quiet, as they need to find the truth because of themselves, not because of Laura, who after all, is dead. Donna soothes James and they french kiss.

Sheriff Harry S. Truman phones Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen), asking whether she was at the motel at a particular date. Jocelyn doesn't answer and hangs up because she is busy. She makes a peanut butter sandwich with the butter we've seen before. Jocelyn checks her mail when she's alone, and she finds a letter. It's the pencil drawing of a huge dominoes peg, which we've also seen before: the dominoes chip which Hank used to toss and turn in front of the parole officer jury. At that moment, Hank calls asking Jocelyn whether she's seen the chip."

Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) appears, trying to seduce him and trying to offer her help to him. She is kindly rejected.

The singers are Icelandic people who want to buy some realty in Twin Peaks, invited by Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), the ambitious realty seller. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) appears in the middle of the meeting dressed in a messy way, with unkempt hair and in hysterics, asking to re-join the new project.

Meanwhile, Audrey starts working in the department store recommended by her own father. She rejects the first position offered and asks her boss to put her on retail and customer service. At first, he refuses, as customers are really demanding, but she blackmails him. In fact, she is looking for the exact position which Laura used to hold.

James Hurley (James Marshall) tells Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle) the truth about his father: he was a musician who left him and his mother to their own devices. He's come back to do some unclear, probably illegal business. Dale Cooper finally discovers the photo advertisement Laura had placed in that magazine. He also discovers the red drapes he had dreamed about some time before.

Madeleine ""Maddy"" Ferguson (Sheryl Lee) has breakfast with James and Donna. They don't notice that somebody is listening up. It's Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey), who is going to start washing dishes at the dinner. Shelly is a bit jealous of the loving relation which Norma and Hank seem to share. As usual, Lucy looks and sighs to the look of her favourite tv programme, cheesy soap opera ""Invitation to Love"" with Chet (Lance Davis), Montana (Rick Giolito) and Jared (Peter Michael Goetz).

Davis) and Betty (Charlotte Stewart) visit a family counsellor, Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), who has each lens of his glasses of a different colour. He asks him what he felt the first time he made love to Laura. The psychoanalyst seems to think that she laughed at him and that's why he's become so rebellious lately. Bobby says that Laura wanted to die. He remembers that she knew how wicked people may get. The psychologist tries to follow that thread and Bobby cries remembering her.

Hawk, Sheriff Harry S. Truman, Hayward and of course Dale Cooper visit the weird Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson), who slaps Cooper's hand because he fingered the food before she served tea. She says that her husband was a logging man who saw the devil. She tells Cooper to ask the log. The Log Lady caresses the log and she says that she - the log - heard two men and two girls laughing on the woods, over the bridge, and that darkness pressed on her. Then it heard a girl. When they leave, they find an old trail. Hawk points the way. They reach an old cottage with blood stains on the floor and a broken casino chip hidden. They turn off the radio.

Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) goes to a country party with Pete Martell (Jack Nancy), who as usual is bossed around by her. Catherine throws some champagne over Ben's luxurious footwear. Audrey is watching closely, as usual. She follows her father and Catherine, and watches them through a hole on the wall. He sees Catherine slapping Ben, but then they kiss and make out while she smiles and half-laughs. Catherine mentions their plot of burning the saw mill down to its ashes and cashing on the insurance, but leaving the land available for sale as realty. Ben tells her to wait for a while as the business with the Islanders is going well. Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly), for once, looks like a good fun and responsible business man who can take care of things. However, Leeland appears to make a fool of himself, dancing on his own half drunk half hysterical. Catherine starts dancing with him to hide the fact that he's terribly damaged. The Islanders seem to think that it's a new dancing vogue. Audrey sees all these motions with disgust.

Maddy has found a tape of Laura, and calls Donna to tell her so.

Hank appears and beats Leo up. He is furious because Leo has lost the drug business they used to share. Furious, Leo hits Shelly once again, but this time she shows the gun to him. He doesn't believe she's capable of shooting him. However, this time she shoots him.

When Dale Cooper arrives to his motel room, he knows that somebody has entered his room. He opens the door and looks at Audrey with amazement.

She is naked in his room, and asks him to let her stay over."

Special FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) tries to reason with Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn): she can't stay to live with him on his hotel as it would be wrong, as he intends to follow the values he's been sworn to when he entered the FBI, and that in spite of liking her very much. He's sympathetic nevertheless, and intends to listen to whatever problems Audrey has got. She asks him whether he's got any secrets, because Laura used to have many.

Lucy Morgan (Kimmy Robertson) is doing some taks at her desk, so that she's a bit rude towards Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), the man she is supposed to be dating. Cooper comes in and he talks about the link between Laura, violent man Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) and the other girl who appeared walking numbly after having survived the same circumstances as Laura. The porn and hot-date magazine seems to be the link. Dr Will Hayward (Warren Frost), Deputy Tommy 'Hawk' Hill (Michael Horse) and Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) listen to him. They also realise that there is a link with the strange pub/brothel One Eyed Jacks.

Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) appears to offer some consolation to Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick), who recounts how she shot Leo, who in turn left home wounded and furious. Bobby offers some protection to her, but we don't know up to what point he will be able to deliver.

Madeleine 'Maddy' Ferguson - late Laura Palmer's cousin - (Sheryl Lee), rebellious biker James Hurley (James Marshall) and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) listen to the tapes Maddy has found of recorded Laura's thoughts. She speaks as in poetry, talking about her loneliness. Meanwhile, Audrey is working in exactly the same role as Laura used to have in her father -Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer)'s department store, but her real intentions is to work undercover and investigate the possible relations between the job and Laura's death. Hidden in a closet, Audrey discovers that her boss in-line Emory Battis (Don Amendolia) offers jobs to young girls in exchange of sexual favours. In fact, she listens how he subtly proposes to a girl, Jenny (Lisa Ann Cabasa), who accepts the job with its ""consequences"". Audrey tries to talk to Jenny when she is leaving.

Cooper visit Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) while working on his wife Norma (Peggy Lipton)'s diner. He pretends to be reformed in order to recover his drug business, which Leo has let go to the devil.

Jocelyn Packard (Joan Chen) is worried about Twin Peaks' sawmill. She is a bit jealous and tells Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) her suspicions about her ex-mother-in-law Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) and Ben Horne's intentions of setting fire to the sawmill. Jocelyn offers Harry some proofs this time, showing him some photographs of the lovers in a motel. Harry confides on Cooper, who decides to investigate the matter.

Audrey keeps on calling Cooper, but he's with Sheriff Harry S. Truman seeing to Jocelyn Packard's problems. Catherine is reading some documents showing that Jocelyn is the fiduciary receiver of a million dollars in case of reception of the insurance owner. Catherine understands that Ben and Josie are plotting to kill her. She refuses to sign the papers alleging that she's noticed some changes and that she should question her attorney concerning them. She tries to seduce the insurance man, Walter Neff (Mark Loventhal) who is ambitious and sees a big opportunity in servicing her in spite of all her strange conditions.

Audrey writes a letter for Cooper, as she can't contact him. Leo kills Waldo the mynah. Cooper hears the record of Waldo's voice. The law enforcers go to the One Eyed Jacks. Blackie O'Reilly (Victoria Catlin) goes directly to talk to them. She immediately realises that they are cops. They gamble, drink and record Cooper's narration of events in a recording machine watched by Hawk.

Maddy tries to leave the home where she's staying without being heard, but Leland (Ray Wise) watches her. Donna, Maddy and James meet, and James wants to talk to the now blonde Maddy leaving Donna alone. Jerry (David Patrick Kelly), Ben and the Icelandic tourists are having a party. Ben asks Jerry about Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) and he says that he will take full responsibility. Ben tells Jerry to entertain the drunk Icelandic people while he calls Jocelyn, who talks to him with Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) at her side.

Audrey goes to the One Eyed Jacks to find a job undercover. Blackie interviews her. She offers Audrey a job eventually. Meanwhile, Cooper and Big Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) enter the place undercover. Big Ed has left Nadine Hurley (Wendy Robie), his one-eyed wife, alone at home, in spite of her feelings of being a monster towards herself.

Cooper is playing blackjack and Big Ed tries to hide his face from the new croupier, Jacques Renault. James phones Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn) but it's Maddy who speaks, pretending to be Laura. She tells Jacoby to go to the door, and so he goes - defending himself with a small gun. It's a video of Maddy with a blonde wig pretending to be Laura, showing the day's newspaper. Maddy thinks that Jacoby has fallen for the trick. Bobby - hidden among the bushes - watches how Donna and James leave in a motorbike, leaving Maddy on her own. Bobby also confuses her with late Laura Palmer, especially because he stares wide-eyed to her back. Dr Jacoby thinks he recognises the place where Maddy ""Laura"" is in the video, so he leaves on his car full-speed. At that moment, James and Donna enter his office, as he was Laura's psychiatric counsellor.

Jealous Bobby puts the cocaine on the deposit of James' bike and says ""say goodbye, James"".

The last shot is of Maddy disguised as Laura being approached by somebody who is hiding - probably dangerous Dr Jacoby."

TITLE CARD - A man on his knees holding up his hands which are tied together, the Willis Tower, a handgun, a man flailing as he is falling.

The man, Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman), is in his office as a young couple interviews him about becoming their financial advisor. He is receptive to their questions but is distracted when he receives an email with a video attachment showing two people having sex in a bedroom. Marty's business partner, Bruce Liddell (Josh Randall), comes in, reminds Marty of an appointment, and tells the couple that unfortunately their firm is over-extended and aren't taking on new clients, but they could -- if the couple opened a $5000 account right now. The couple eagerly agrees.

A Realtor shows Bruce and Marty an empty office space in a high rise in downtown Chicago. Bruce is enthusiastic about the setting, already fantasizing about where their offices will be, and how many employees they will have under them. Marty notes how the southern facing floor-to-ceiling windows will give them a huge cooling bill. Bruce excuses the Realtor, his fiancé Liz, and notes Marty's distraction, including the porn video he was watching earlier. He points out that Marty's wife of twenty-two years, Wendy, would not appreciate him watching porn at work. Bruce also points out that even though they are partners and best friends, he has a much better home, car, and sex life than Marty. Marty defends his car and says he has a good sex-life. Bruce gives him a pamphlet from his recent weekend away with Liz - Lake of the Ozarks, the ""Redneck Riviera"" - and recommends Marty buy some land there as a means of escaping the city and improving his mood and maybe his marriage. Liz returns and while Bruce is eager to take the space, Marty says they'll consider it.

Marty and Wendy (Laura Linney) are having dinner with their fifteen year old daughter, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz), and younger son Jonah (Skylar Gaertner). Wendy plays peacemaker as Jonah has issues with going to the school dance. Charlotte and Jonah call each other ""retards."" Marty tells them not to use that word. Marty rejects giving Charlotte ten dollars for a fundraiser for a classmate with psoriasis, and later tells Wendy that he's given Charlotte money over the past weeks, and that Charlotte needs to know the value of money. Later, Marty and Wendy are sitting in front of the TV, but, behind her back, he's watching the porn video on his laptop.

Marty tucks Charlotte in, and drives off and picks up a prostitute. She reads him as the hard-working father, supporting his family, while his wife stays at home, but doesn't do everything he would like in the bedroom. As she gives him oral sex, Marty is broken from his reverie by a prostitute knocking on his car window - it was a fantasy. Bruce calls and says he is at Hanson's Trucking and that he needs Marty there. When Marty declines, Bruce tells him Del is also there.

Marty drives to the Hanson's, a lot in an industrial area, and enters a second floor office while four men stand in front of the closed entrance door. Bruce, Liz, and the two Hansons, father and son, are there. Del (Esai Morales) comes out of the restroom, greets Marty warmly, and asks for his $5 million. Marty does not know what he is referring to. Hanson Jr. says he and his father are not involved as they run a clean shop. Del disputes that they are clean, as they have collected $100 million in drug money and passed it on to Marty and Bruce to launder. Del says $5 million has been stolen from him, but Hanson Sr. says Del can check their logs, as they've weighed and recorded everything they've received. Liz asks to be excused to go to the restroom. Del relates a story of when a loyal cashier at his family's grocery store stole five dollars worth of pesos from the till. Del's father confronted her and asked her why she didn't just ask him for the money. The cashier, a single mother of five, claimed she needed to buy asthma medicine for her youngest. Del asks Hanson Sr and Bruce what his father should have done. Both answer that she should be given a second chance and watched carefully as if on probation. Del scoffs. Marty tells Del that Del is doing an intimidation audit, that he is fishing for an admission of skimming, but Del has a long distribution chain that ends downstream with meth heads and drug dealers, and that is where he should be looking. Marty says they've been laundering money for Mr. Navarro for ten years. Marty, nodding toward Liz in the restroom, tells Del he has now involved a civilian, and that is the mistake in his ruse. Del calls in his men, and in the meantime, takes out his pistol and shoots through the restroom door. Liz's body thuds on the floor. Hanson Jr starts yelling that his father is not involved and that it was all Bruce's idea.

They are taken outside; Liz's body is dropped into a barrel of acid. Del says he likes Chicago because of all the Mexicans, but dislikes Chicago because of all the Mexicans who attract all the Federal law enforcement agencies like the DEA and FBI. Yet, he points out, the drama comes from these four white guys. As Hanson Sr begs for his son's life, Del shoots Sr, and then Jr. Del asks Bruce how he did it. Bruce says the truckers weighed and recorded their loads of air conditioners, etc. along with the shipment of cash, but Bruce had them fill the gas tank short five gallons and took the cash equal to that weight. Bruce says they've skimmed $8 million over the years, and tells Del that Marty was not involved. Del shoots Bruce. Marty fumbles his phone out of his pocket and begs to be able to leave a message for his kids. Del knocks the phone out of Marty's hands and asks where Wendy is. Marty assures Del that Wendy does not know anything about what he does. Marty then produces the Ozark pamphlet and tells Del that every summer, the place is swarming with rich people with lots of cash to spend. Marty says he had investigated the Ozarks so they could do there what they've been doing in Chicago. He says Del was right about Chicago, that there was too much heat there, and that they need a new hub. Away from the scrutiny of the Feds, Marty assures Del he can launder $500 million in five years.

Del shoots. But this is another of Marty's reveries. In fact, Del has asked Marty to return what was stolen from him within 48 hours, then leave for the Ozarks with his family in another 48 hours, and then set up shop in a week.

At home, Wendy actually knows what Marty does, and says they should go to the police. Marty suggests she think about what would happen with the police, if they even get that far, as the people he's been working with have no code of ethics. Wendy realizes Marty is acting this way because she and the kids are also in danger. Marty says he will try to gather the $8 million, while Wendy will prepare the move and the sale of the house. In the morning, Charlotte refuses to move; Jonah worries the Ozarks are basically the woods. As he makes breakfast, Marty tells them families move to follow work opportunities every day. Charlotte storms off; Wendy goes to talk to her.

At the office, Marty calls his bankers and puts off their hesitations that they cannot get that much in physical cash in such a short time without raising flags, adding early-withdrawal penalties and taxes, etc. Marty then tells his secretary that the firm has been dissolved.

At a high-rise apartment, Wendy is telling an older man that Marty is in business with some bad people and the family has to leave. The man is incredulous, mostly because it's Marty. Elsewhere, a private investigator tells Marty that the older man's name is Gary Silverberg, a partner with a downtown law firm. Wendy has been seeing him twice a week. She calls him ""Sugarwood."" Silverberg advises Wendy to take as much money as she can before the Feds freeze it. Marty asks the investigator, hypothetically, what it would take for a family of four to disappear. He tells Marty that it may last a while but sooner or later they would run out of money, one of the kids would get sloppy on-line, or the wife might have too many drinks with friends and get loose-lipped. Marty gets a call from his bank saying that Wendy just liquidated their accounts. The investigator asks if Marty has a gun and then tells him where Silverberg lives.

Marty drives away, calling Wendy. She doesn't answer. He yells to himself that he's been faithful to her over the twenty-two years, although he's had opportunities. Wendy has returned to Silverberg's apartment and finds Del and a henchman there, glowering at Silverberg. As Marty walks toward the apartment high-rise, a body falls from above onto the street - Silverberg. Marty drives away and Del calls him and asks why Wendy has a $30k check in her possession. Del now knows Marty lied to him about Wendy not knowing about their business arrangement. Del wonders what Marty will do now - go through an ugly divorce, where Wendy will certainly bring up Marty's criminal enterprise, or let Del take care of their Wendy problem. Del reminds Marty he never answered his question about the grocery store cashier. Marty says to fire the cashier as it is not the first time she stole from the father, but the first time he's caught her.

Marty is at home. Wendy comes home and he says, You're welcome.

Marty goes to the bank with a rolling suitcase and two duffel bags. The banker leads him to the vault where another banker and three federal agents are waiting for him. They hold up a sign asking if he is under duress, if he is a victim of a kidnapping, and scan him with a metal detector wand. He assures them he is not, he is not wired, and that the money is for a business opportunity. He says what he does with his money is his own business. He threatens to go back to the lobby and yell that he can't get his money out, causing a panic. He leaves with almost $8 million and meets with Del.

At a quiet picnic area, Del's henchmen count the cash and it is $7k short. Marty says he knew that explaining he was planning on selling his remaining mini-van to cover the deficit. Del offers to buy the car from Marty, making up for the deficit and leaving Marty $20k over. Del then tells Marty to take the $8 million to the Ozarks and clean it. Marty doesn't understand - the money is already clean, and Del would lose up to 25% in taxes. But Del tells him that's not the point of the exercise - he has to see that Marty is willing to do it and that he CAN do it. He thinks Marty has a gift. Del muses that he is stuck between thinking about how intriguing this all is, and that maybe Marty is conning him. He assures Marty that if it's the latter, he will kill him and his family. Marty asks Del about the other night, when Del asked the men about the missing $5 million, when it turned out to be $8 million. Del admits he was on a fishing expedition, but that he's been working with Marty and Bruce for a long time, and was suspicious when Bruce was not running his mouth as usual.

At home, Wendy and Charlotte are loading up their car. Charlotte sees Wendy is stressed and asks her what is really going on. Wendy hugs her and asks Charlotte to support her over the next few days and to trust them.

The FBI is swarming over the office space Bruce and Marty and Liz were looking at. Agent Evans (McKinley Belcher III) suggests to Agent Petty (Jason Butler Harner) that Bruce must have left the country with Liz. Another agent tells Petty that they've collected the bugs that they had planted. The first agent wonders why Petty isn't more upset as Bruce was their ""in"" and that he would have made a fantastic government witness. Petty thinks the Feds are overestimating Mexicans, the Mafia, and Muslims -- that they are made out to be criminal masterminds, but in reality they are like Bruce -- entertaining, pathological liars. Petty asks where Martin Byrde is.

The family is driving through a forested area. Marty pulls over, telling Wendy he has to take a leak. Instead he walks a few yards into the forest, leans against a tree, and quietly says, I'm so sorry. He walks ahead a few more yards and looks over the expanse of Ozark Lake. The family comes up behind him to take in the view of their new home."

At breakfast, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz) is upset that they are at a cheap motel instead of a Marriott and that her parents are still not being honest with her and Jonah (Skylar Gaertner). Marty (Jason Bateman) says they have to watch their spending. While Wendy (Laura Linney) looks for a house, the kids will stay in their room as all their possessions are there.

As Marty drops her off at a Realtor, Wendy asks what they are telling the kids. Marty replies sarcastically that they should tell them the truth. Wendy reminds Marty that an innocent man, Gary, was murdered, and that she had an affair because she was not happy. Marty only reminds her that they have $20k and she needs to search for a starter home and to check with him before signing anything. He goes on to say they aren't husband and wife anymore -- they are business partners in raising their kids. He admits to not keeping an eye on Bruce, but he says that he was occupied with keeping track of Wendy's mysterious phone calls, texts, and evenings out. And worst of all, she liquidated their accounts, knowing that he needed the money to pay off Del (Esai Morales), and Marty knows she didn't do that by herself. He says the only thing that gets him to sleep is remembering Gary slamming onto the pavement. She slaps him, then punches him and leaves.

TITLE CARD - A barrel on its side with liquid pouring out, a storage shed, a jawbone, an empty suitcase and fishing waders.

Wendy enters the office and finds one employee, who is enjoying having his feet licked by a dog.

Lying by the pool, Charlotte sees the housekeeper approach their room, and tells her there's no need for her services.

Marty is at the registrar's office. A woman, who uses the term ""colored folks"" to describe the guests at an Oprah taping she attended, shows him where the public records are filed. He says he's an angel investor helping struggling businesses turn around. She notices his swollen lip and recommends he put some ice on it.

Marty has found a self-storage place with the owner delinquent on his property taxes. Marty tries to convince the owner that he would invest in the place and improve it. He offers to be a client as well, and notices a large shed that he offers to rent. The man gives him the keys - the shed is currently storing a pontoon boat that was impounded by the police. The perp had cut the tip off a pontoon, and put it on a hinge to smuggle methamphetamine back and forth across the lake. Now that he has Marty as a paying client, he refuses Marty's investment offer.

The next day, while Marty meets with a lake tour boat operator and then a hardware store, Wendy looks at houses with cockroaches and leaking ceilings. The teenage custodian of the motel, Wyatt, invites Charlotte wake-boarding with his cousin, Three. Jonah reminds her of their job, but she scoffs that they only have three iPads and a Pandora bracelet and runs off.

Marty talks to the owner of a gentleman's club, but the man immediately recognizes that Marty is trying to use his business to launder money. He declines.

The Realtor shows Wendy a lake-front home. The current owner, dragging an oxygen tank, is working on his car next to the house. The Realtor tells Wendy the house is under her budget.

Marty is sitting by the lake, eating lunch. He gets up, tosses half of it and watches it as it falls into the lake.

Wyatt, Charlotte, and Three set off. Wyatt says his father, a Kansas City lawyer, is not happy with his choice of a journalism major at Mizzou.

Jonah, bored of watching TV in the room, packs the family's computers in a backpack and leaves the room.

The owner of the lake-front home, Buddy (Harris Yulin), explains that he will live in the finished basement while the family can have the rest of the house. He has heart issues (he calls his cardiologist a ""dot head"") and has a year or 18 months left. He wants to stay in the house until he dies, and has priced the house low because of that unusual condition. He asks about the children and when Wendy tells him Charlotte is fifteen, he worries that since he has a septic tank instead of sewer lines, her ""period plugs"" will clog the system. Wendy appears to be offended but backs off. After they leave, Wendy comes back and asks Buddy if he had indeed said he has a year left.

Jonah is at the arcade. Charlotte is having a good time on the lake until a state trooper lights them up. Wyatt rushes to get Charlotte a life vest as she realizes that this is not his boat, and that his story about his father and college was a lie. He throws her off the boat, and the trooper breaks off the chase to rescue her. Jonah walks through town to the lake and sees a developmentally disabled boy fishing. Jonah says hello and the boy says his name is Tuck and gives him a pocketknife.

Marty and Wendy are in the sheriff's office while towel-wrapped Charlotte waits in the lobby. The boat was damaged upon its return so the sheriff looks to the Byrdes to pay for the damages as Wyatt and Three Langmore certainly can't. Marty tells the sheriff that he and Wendy are being blamed because the deputies think they have money, and the deputies are too lazy to investigate further and arrest the Langmores. Wendy tells Marty to shut-up. The sheriff points at Marty's swollen lip and then smirks at Wendy. The sheriff explains that he has a small department and is tasked with protecting the lake and its tourist industry interests. When people come and disrupt those interests, he suggests they go to Branson. Wendy asks if the sheriff is appointed or elected. He says elected. Wendy asks if the Langmores vote or pay taxes. The sheriff guesses that they don't. Wendy says her family is buying a home there, and they DO vote and pay taxes. The sheriff says they are lucky Charlotte didn't get mixed up with the Langmore's cousin, Ruth - 19, smart, mean, a criminal whose potential is not yet tapped, a B and E magician. The sheriff suggests they don't leave anything of value near Ruth. The sheriff calls his deputy to pick up Wyatt and Three - they live at their father Russ's trailer at the cove.

They go back to the room, Jonah is there. Marty notices the room has been cleaned, but Jonah says he cleaned it. Marty notices the pocketknife and Jonah says he went on a short walk and a friend gave it to him. Marty looks under the bed and pulls on the duffel bags and the rolling suitcase. The rolling suitcase is light. As he pulls it out, Wendy urges the kids out of the room. Alone, Marty opens the suitcase and there is only one bundle of cash inside.

Charlotte returns to the room and says she knows where Ruth and the Langmores might have gone, but she doesn't know how to get there. Later, Marty calls the sheriff and he tells him Ruth lives with her uncles, Russ and Boyd. They haven't been seen since the morning.

Marty is at the hardware store purchasing fishing equipment, two large rolling ice chests, and ice. He's at the dock renting a motorboat, and then pays a fisherman $100 for the catfish he has on a line. He loads the boat and studying a map, heads to the other side of the lake.

He drags the ice chests through some woods and stops when he sees a trailer. He walks further in and sees a rest-stop restroom building. There are voices from inside and he pulls a switchblade but thinks better of it and pockets it. Ruth (Julia Garner), the housekeeper at the hotel, is telling her family that so much money must be ill-gotten, so they have as much right to it as the Byrdes do. Marty barges in and yells, they do not. Ruth, Wyatt, Three, Russ (Marc Menchaca), and Boyd (Christopher James Baker) are there, stuffing the cash into a cavity behind a urinal. Russ pulls a gun. Marty says they can't just leave the money behind the urinal, or put it in a bank, or go on a shopping spree. Marty says the money is his, and technically, he is only responsible for it -- Omar Navarro is the money's owner. Three calls up Siri and is shocked by the search result - he shows Wyatt, Russ, and Boyd. Boyd doesn't believe a smart drug cartel leader would trust someone like Marty with $3 million. Marty says he in fact trusted him with $8 million, the rest is still under the bed at the motel. He assures the Langmores that they are making a big mistake - that if they steal the money, they will have to kill Marty. Otherwise, another man is going to come to town and ask Marty who took the money, and when he replies, the Langmores, that man will find and kill them all. Ruth pipes up and says taking the money is a good thing because Marty has been aiding and abetting the sale of drugs, possibly to kids. She says they can buy slightly used cars for cash. And the purchase of a big screen TV would not interest the IRS. The family is never going to get another opportunity like they have now.

Marty asks who the weak link is in the family - who has the big mouth, who drinks too much, and who will spend all his share too fast. He says unless they're willing to kill Marty and then their own family member in a death penalty state, that they should rethink their plan. Wyatt immediately leads Three out of the restroom. Three apologizes to Marty about Charlotte, but Marty says, not good enough. Boyd says they'll just take $100g, but Marty says that Navarro will come for it. Russ decides they'll take $20k for their trouble and dashed expectations. Marty says they will have to deal with the consequences. Russ and Boyd leave. Ruth tells Marty she almost got it done, and she has the feeling that they both know he'd be better off dead.

It is now dark and Marty rolls the ice chests through the woods to the shore. He places the fish carcasses on top of the cash, and fills the gaps with ice. He returns to the other side of the lake and drives to the storage place, where he unloads the chests, removing the fish and ice first and then pulling out and placing the cash into the pontoon that already has some cash inside.

The FBI are swarming over Hanson Trucking. A tech hands Agent Petty what appears to be a desiccated jawbone.

Petty is working out. He tells Evans the jawbone was Hanson Sr's and that Bruce Liddell is probably also in that ooze. Petty is transferring to Missouri - Marty Byrde's Amex was used there. Petty wonders why Marty liquidated his company (and someone does the same to Bruce) and moved his family to Missouri. He also took $8 million, which was clean. If Marty thought the Feds were going to freeze the money, he would have sent it offshore, so obviously Marty needs the cash for something else, something illegal. And Petty will catch him, catch the cartel, seize all the money, and make his career. He intends to do this without Evans.

Marty is in bed and dreams of standing at the edge of the precipice where he had lunch the other day. He gets up and kisses Charlotte and Jonah. Jonah wakes and apologizes for leaving yesterday. He says he made a friend yesterday, Tuck, who works at the Blue Cat Lodge - where no one stays, eats at the restaurant, or drinks at the bar. Jonah says that's Marty's kind of place. Marty wakes Wendy and they go outside. By the pool, he tells her the insurance payout is a million dollars. He wants Wendy to take the kids and live off the credit card until the payout. He says he lost them everything and that they'll be better off. He sees no way he can wash $8 million for Del in the Ozarks in three months. When he's dead, Del can retrieve the cash to make him whole, and then there'd be no reason for Del to come after the family. He gives Wendy Del's email address and the location of the cash. He asks her to wait three hours and then call the sheriff - that Marty went hiking by the lake and hasn't come back. She begs him not to go through with his plan, but he is insistent.

On his way to the lake, Marty pulls off the road and calls his private investigator, Bob, and asks him if he's handled any insurance investigations before. Marty says he has a friend who is looking for some statistics on whether companies still pay out if there is suspicion that the policy holder committed suicide. The investigator says the insurance company would be suspicious if the policy holder recently had financial problems, or quit his job suddenly, or had a spouse who was unfaithful. Dejected, Marty hangs up and sees a road sign pointing to the Blue Cat Lodge.

Wendy has locked herself in the bathroom and has made the call to the sheriff and is finishing the email to Del. Marty returns to the room and says he wasn't thinking straight. Wendy sobs into a towel. Marty asks Jonah about the Blue Cat Lodge.

Marty is at the Blue Cat. The signs outside are faded, the lone gas pump is out of order. He is talking to the owner in her office, but he's obviously not convincing her and she urges him out. He admits to not knowing anything about her business, nor how to improve it; but he is there to invest in people, not businesses. The owner is still skeptical and tells Marty she already has a mortgage, and while his investment may lead to more guests over the summer, after Labor Day, she will be deeper in debt to the bank and also be in debt to Marty.

Marty goes to leave but gets back out of his car to go to the bar. Tuck is serving behind the bar and one of the redneck customers calls him ""the biggest retard"" he's ever seen. Marty, at the other end of the bar, tells the redneck not to use that word. Marty then notices the owner heading into the bar, and he turns back to the redneck, saying that he won't tolerate that kind of disrespect to the boy or to the lodge. As the owner watches the scene, Marty points to a photo frame on the wall and says the father and son in the picture are purposefully holding out the fish they just caught to make the fish look bigger to emphasize the memories they will have of the lodge. Marty demands the redneck apologize to Tuck, and calls him a miserable redneck cocksucker. The redneck gently places one hand on Marty's shoulder and punches him in the face with the other hand. The owner looks on half bemused, half stoic.

Wendy and the kids take a taxi to the lake front home. Charlotte notice Buddy looking at them from an upstairs window and asks who he is. Wendy explains he'll be living in the basement for a year, give or take. Charlotte demands to know what they are doing there. Wendy tells the kids that Marty is laundering money for a Mexican drug cartel."

Winston is fired up to serve as usher. It's the first job he's had in months and he was to ""ush"" the crap out of it. Jess practices her Chicken Dance.

""We're not trying to be mean, we just don't want you to be mean in any way,"" Schmidt says. She comes out all fancied up and they're impressed -- until she reveals the prop teeth.

At the wedding, they see Brooke, a girl Schmidt has liked since freshman year. ""She used to get drunk and pass out on our porch, it was like having a hot, alcoholic cat,"" Nick says. ""I used to put water out for her,"" Schmidt adds.

Winston meets a tween punk named Jimmy who introduces himself as alternate usher. Winston is threatened.

Schmidt sees Gretchen, who he says is a ""terrible person"" who he nevertheless ends up having sex with after every wedding. Flash back to a montage of them doing it ferociously in closets. She promises to tie him down the show him pictures of her river rafting trip later.

Nick spies Caroline and fails at acting natural. Jess asks to be introduced in a faux British voice. She botches Caroline's name a few times then tells her that she and Nick are exhausted from all the sex they're having. She succeeds at making Caroline jealous and Nick is impressed.

Brooke walks up to the bar next to Schmidt, who she doesn't recognize until he refers to himself as ""Fat Schmidt."" She says she six months sober and he pretends he is, too. Then he commands the bartender to meet him in the bathroom with a water bottle full of vodka.

Jimmy the kid usher taunts Winston.

Nick notices Caroline watching him. She comes over and Nick gives Jess an opening to leave, which she takes immediately. But she ends up in the spotlight when the new couple is introduced and covers by addressing the crowd loudly to present them.

Caroline asks Nick if they're serious. He says they live together.

Schmidt hits the bar for any kind of alcohol. Gretchen finds him and insults him. Jess is uncomfortable in her tiny bicycle shorts, but Schmidt turns it back to him. He wants Brooke and is trying to resist Gretchen.

Schmidt and Winston see Nick talking to Caroline and warn that she will flirt until she's sure she can have him, then bail. She tries to distract him with dancing, but he goes to get a drink with Caroline, telling Jess he might actually have a chance.

The tiny usher joins her on the dance floor and corners her. Winston feels challenged and engages in a dance-off, which he ruins by rubbing up on Jess.

Schmidt finds Brooke at the chocolate fountain, but is interrupted by Jess calling for help to get her bicycle shorts off. He tells Brooke that Jess happened when he hit rock bottom and she can be a little dangerous. Brooke suggests they leave, but she has to go to the fountain first.

Nick and Caroline take pictures in the photo booth, with her on his lap. He makes her laugh and she asks if they can stay in there all night.

Brooke runs into Jess in the bathroom, where she's cutting off her bicycle shorts with a knife. Brooke thinks her nuttiness is crazy eyes and worries when Jess says Schmidt likes her. Jess jokingly warns her not to hurt Schmidt, wagging the knife in her face.

Jess finds Nick and Caroline in the photo booth and makes a scene. Caroline assures her it's fine and she has a boyfriend. Caroline runs off. Schmidt reports that Jess scared off Brooke and calls her a ""ruiner."" Jesstakes her fake teeth and resolves to have fun at the wedding.

Gretchen finds Schmidt and puts her clip on earrings on him.

Drunk Nick gets in front of the wedding videographer and cries about how he's so alone. Then he mocks their cut outs, telling him no open bar is tacky.

Winston finds Jess alone with her fake teeth. He assures her the guys are glad she's around. She asks if he wants to talk about the ""freak sandwich"" with the eight year old.

Schmidt comes to get them. Nick is in the photo booth with a bottle of whiskey. He tells Jess he's sorry he was mean. Jess joins him. Jess tells him he shouldn't be Caroline's back-up plan. She suggest he dance his face off instead.

Nick sits down with Caroline, telling her he has to let her go and it has to be over. He hugs her good-bye. Then the Phil Collins starts and he grabs Jess to dance. They do the chicken dance in slow motion to ""Groovy Kind of Love.""

Back at the apartment, tied to the bed, with Gretchen on top of him (still in her pantsuit), he suggests they go on a date sometime. She says no and continues the white water rafting slide show."

She suggests they watch ""Fame"" instead, or ""An American Tale,"" ""It's about a little Jewish mouse, with a big heart..."" And that's the end of the movie night.

Schmidt tries to prepare Nick for his first date in a while. It's with a girl who's so ironic some times, he can't tell if she's being serious. A lot of ""Like, right? I know.""

Schmidt suggests one of his magical date plans. Jess joins, wanting to know about it. When she hears it's with Amanda from the bar and it's his first date since Caroline, she lays on the pressure. ""Scary stuff. Falling rocks! Bridge out! Duck!""

They tell him to suck in his gut. ""The little pooch where you keep your extra cookies,"" Jess calls it.

Nick preens in front of the mirror then practices his white man dance moves in front of the mirror.

Winston tells Schmidt about his terrible chit-chat filled interview. ""Did you see the J-Wow re-tweet of the Gaga Twit-pic?"" he's asked. He explains how he knows Word, how to open a document and save. And ""save as.""

Schmidt tells him the chit chat is the interview. But Wintson's been out of the loop for the past two years . Schmidt tells him Betty White is back, but the rest of the ""Golden Girls"" are dead. Winston resolves to catch up on pop culture.

Nick continues rocking out solo to reggae, then strips to check out his offerings. ""It is what it is,"" he assesses.

Jess shouts at him to turn down the music. He doesn't hear her, so she barges in. She sees his junk and shriek giggles and runs.

Winston watches two movies at once (""The King's Speech"" and ""Human Centipede"") and tells Schmidt to quiz him on chit chat. Jess comes in and says something happened and it's not a big deal. She tells them she saw Nick's ""pee pee and his bubbles.""

Nick walks out in a hoodie and tries to leave the apartment. Jess tries to talk about it, breaking out her best cockney, but only makes things worse.

After he manages to leave, Winston says it's not a big deal. He's seen Nick's junk a million times because they grew up together. ""Locker rooms, swimming pools, penis fights -- it just happens.""

Schmidt feels left out and wonders what would happen if he has to identity his remains by only his penis.

Schmidt tells her that Nick is delicate like a flower and so she has to never speak about it again. Or sing about it.

At the end of his date, it seems to be going well. They're back at Amanda's place but he's having a hard time reading her ironic signals. She tries to get his shirt off but he resists. She takes hers off instead, totally and completely shooting any self confidence he has. He can't strip. She asks awkwardly if he wants to take it slow. They end up lying next to each other in bed fully clothed, barely touching.

The next morning, as Winston watches the double rainbow You Tube, Nick comes home. Jess tells him she has something from school that made her think of him. It's a feeling stick, allowing the holder to express themselves. She hands it to him to talk. He snaps it. She carries a travel size.

He leaves the apartment and she follows.

She apologizes for laughing and says it was: ""Beautiful. Stately. A real treat."" This does not make things better. Someone joins them on the elevator. She tells him she thinks it's great he dances naked to Jamaican music. He gets off the elevator then gets back on, dodging her. She finds him again.

He tells her she ruined his date because he kept hearing her little laugh squeal every time he tried to strip and he just wants to have meaningless sex with what she's calling his ""bing bong and chickadees.""

She wants to have an adult conversation, he wonders how this is possible when she can't say penis. She tries. It comes out ""pyrnaz."" She tries singing it. Then penist, then fake Italian.

Nick goes to the bathroom and finds Schmidt lurking in the stall. He's the only one who hasn't seen it.

Jess tells CeCe what happened. She asks if Jess made the noise she always makes. Apparently she gets the giggles about sex. She suggests the only way to fix it is to show Nick hers.

Schmidt finds Winston on the floor, watching YouTube. He's having a hard time adjusting to not playing basketball any more and getting replaced as the black guy it Latvia.

Schmidt takes him on a run to work it out. Schmidt feels bad about being a grown man with roommates, no girlfriend and his best friend won't even let him see his penis.

At work, Nick apologizes to Amanda, giving sharing his feelings a try. He says he was nervous. She appreciates the honesty.

Back home, Jess flashes herself in the mirror. She's not super comfortable with naked time either. She hears Nick come home and races into his room to flash him. But she hears Nick coming home with Amanda. She tries to hide beside the bed, but it's a futon. Amanda is all over Nick, with the lights on. He's about to strip when he looks down and sees Jess. Everyone screams. Jess runs for the door, but drops her towel. They see her completely naked. She pauses and welcomes Amanda to their home.

Later, in the living room, Nick yells at Jess about how they have rules, like they have doors that must be knocked on. Jess picks up the feeling stick, but Nick doesn't find it funny. So Winston takes a turn, telling Nick that Schmidt has had a bad day and if he were really a friend, he'd show Schmidt what's in his pants. They take turns passing the feeling stick back and forth calmly as Nick yells.

Later, Winston thanks Schmidt for taking him running and making him feel better by being such a lame runner. From the internet Winston learned that everyone has their moment. Their cat might play a keyboard, or their bear might fall on a trampoline. Their moments will come.

Jess knocks on Nick's door, then comes in covering her eyes. She tells him she worked on something for him. ""Penis,"" she says. Amanda hasn't called. Nick wonders if Jess was right that he's not ready for meaningless sex with beautiful women. ""Maybe when you are you'll be able to show her your other penis, your heart penis,"" Jess says. She asks if Nick saw everything, even her ""gumbo pot.""

Nick goes to take a shower, but first he turns on the water and tells Schmidt to get out. ""I'm the only one who hasn't seen it,"" he pouts."

She accuses him of kissing another woman and strikes out by ripping his deep V t-shirt wide open. It was his favorite deep V.

Outside, Jess says he ""seemed like a really nice European DJ with a face tattoo."" CeCe asks to stay with Jess because Gavin's been crashing with her for three weeks.

Jess thinks the guys might have big plans because it's Friday night.

Cut to the guys, Nick playing video games, Winston eating pizza and Schmidt emerging from the shower in a super short lady kimono. They're all exhausted from a long week.

""I just wanna come home, put on my 'mono and hang loose, man,"" Schmidt says. Winston says Schmidt would understand his 'mono if he had a job. Winston retaliates by taking off his pants and putting a napkin on his head.

Jess comes home, telling drunk CeCe to be on her best behavior.

She walks in to Winston swaddled in paper towels, fighting with Schmidt in his mini kimono. With CeCe out of the room, Jess warns the guy that CeCe is really vulnerable and grabby and has no boundaries with her body when she's drunk. They're all OK with this.

Cut to Schmidt and Winston club dancing with CeCe in the living room as Nick grumbles about it. ""I don't dance, I'm from the town in 'Footloose',"" he says.

Jess gives up and goes to bed. Schmidt offers CeCe his bed, saying he'll sleep on the couch. He comes out and celebrates his perceived victory, jumping around the living room and shouting ""parkour!"" He thinks he's in with CeCe. Winston figures he has a shot because he only has to be cooler than Schmidt.

Jess makes eggs in the morning, causing Nick to tell him to stop trying to take care of him.

CeCe wakes up on Schmidt's bed to see him hanging from the bathroom door frame, claiming to be finishing 4,000 crunches. He blacks out for a second from hanging upside down.

As CeCe showers, Schmidt carefully rearranges toiletries as an excuse to be in the bathroom. Winston brushes his teeth in slow motion. Nick comes in to see what all the fuss is about and is transfixed when CeCe pokes her head out of the shower.

Jess comes for CeCe and escorts her out, telling the guys she's disappointed in them, especially Nick. He insists he's better than this, sometimes.

After CeCe leaves in a tiny towel, Schimdt says: ""Did you see that cleavage? I just want to get my arm stuck down there, '127 Hours' style.""

CeCe asks Jess if she's upset at her for dancing with Nick. She thinks Nick is into her. Jess denies it, saying that CeCe just thinks everyone wants to sleep with everyone. Nick pokes his head in to see if anyone needs anything from the drug store. CeCe suggests Jess go. When he's gone, CeCe says his feet were pointing toward Jess, which is evidence he likes her.

At the drug store, Jess notices the direction of men's feet in relation to their women. He asks if CeCe needs to stay with them and concludes she should stop trying to take care of everyone. She looks down and notices his feet pointing right at her. She dances around him, watching the direction of his feet follow her.

When he puts his hand on her shoulder, she thinks it means everything.

Back at the apartment, Schmidt and Winston watch CeCe sunbathing on the roof. Winston accuses Schmidt of not being able to close.

He gets on a fake phone call, telling a woman a ""90 minute session"" is pretty standard for him. Winston busts his play by actually calling him. Winston sits down. CeCe says they're both bothering her.

Jess freaks out on her car ride home with Nick, seeing affection in everything. He buys roses when a woman sticks them in the window and Jess fights them off. She gets out of the car and runs down the street.

Schmidt works on his laptop, shirtless, casually mentioning for CeCe's benefit that he makes a lot of money. He's sunburned, but says in a few days he'll be bronzed like CeCe is, because of her ""culture.""

She says her parents are both from India. Winston suggests Schmidt name all the things he loves about India. Among them: Deepak Chopra, anyone named Patel, ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" monsoons, cobras in baskets, mango chutney.

Winston finally puts him out of his misery by telling him to take a break.

CeCe one-ups him by telling Schmidt to go to the roof. He does. Then she commands Winston make her a sandwich.

Jess comes home. She walked. She wonders what she's doing to cause Nick to like her, considering that it could be her posture.

Nick comes home, asking what happened and saying he was worried about her. CeCe tries to move the situation along, interpreting for Jess that Nick is saying he cares about her. Jess tries to physically restrain CeCe and somehow ends up on her back with her earring stuck in her hair. Jess says CeCe can't understand her wanting to just be friends because she doesn't have guy friends, she just has jerks like Gavin and DJ Diabetic.

CeCe says she's just trying to help Jess make a move. Jess likes taking things slow. ""I'm not like you, I don't just jump in the potato sack with the first potato that I meet with diabetes,"" Jess says.

They hear a scream from upstairs. Schmidt has run into the cat that freaks him out (it was raised by birds).

Jess finds Schmidt on the roof cowering from the cat behind a lawn chair fortress. Jess tells him CeCe's not ready for him. He's a good guy. ""If you ignore all of the things you do on purpose and concentrate on all of the things you do on accident."" Jess warns him CeCe would eat him alive.

Schmidt goes back to his room, where CeCe is in his bed. He says he gets it's not going to happen, but he just wants to sleep in his own bed. She says OK and he lies down. She apologizes for being a jerk.

He says he hates sleeping alone. So does she. She urges him not to talk, but holds his hand.

Nick finds Jess brushing her teeth. She puts his toothpaste on. With a mouth full of toothpaste, she apologizes for acting weird. They both turn and face the sink, feet pointing away.

Winston gets a call in the living room. It's Schmidt from his bedroom, reporting that he's holding CeCe's hand. He considers that closing."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2043474/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,"Jess invites Paul, a music teacher at her school on whom she always has had a crush, to the gang's big Thanksgiving dinner at the loft, which naturally goes horribly awry.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Miguel Arteta'],"['', '', '']",[],"['camera shot from inside a clothes dryer', 'friends who live together', 'modeling', 'bartender', 'singing in a car', 'waiting in line', 'playing violin', 'bare chested male', 'smoke', 'mashed potatoes', 'walnut', ""macy's thanksgiving day parade"", 'watching football on tv', 'stage performance', 'frozen turkey']",[],"Jess watches kids practice for the Thanksgiving pageant. Paul (Justin Long) says hi and casually asks how her boyfriend is doing. She asks what he's doing for Thanksgiving.

Cut to Jess returning home with a giant turkey.

The guys are disappointed. They just want to watch football and drink beer and head to Best Buy for ""Black Friday,"" or as Winston calls it ""Friday."" Schmidt is trying to call it ""Dudesgiving.""

She tells them Paul will be joining them. Schmidt makes sure Paul isn't the turkey's name. (It's name is ""Hank,"" for Hanksigivng.)

Jess assures them Paul is a ""guy's guy."" Winston thinks they have to figure out whether Paul is the right guy for them, they deserve to be happy.

Jess wants to know if anyone knows anything about cooking. Schmidt suggests maybe she shouldn't ask a guy out on the least sexy holiday of the year. Schmidt gets dragged into helping when Jess promises to invite CeCe. Schmidt says he'll only cook if he's allowed to run the kitchen.

The turkey is frozen solid. Jess wonders if it'll be thawed. Cut to three hours before dinner, Jess hugging it to her body to melt it with her warmth. Next it goes into the dryer. ""I put it on permanent press,"" she says. ""Good, you don't have to iron it,"" Nick says.

Paul arrives in a suit and tie. Jess bursts into a Thanksgiving verse. After an awkward pause, Paul finishes it up, even posing with her. ""Oh my god, there's two of them,"" marvels Nick.

Jess gets Paul a beer and tells the guys that Paul brought his violin and might play later but, Paul says, only if they don't mind being enchanted.

Jess talks to Nick privately, telling him not to do that thing that he does. She tells him not to be mean or make his turtle face or talk about small business loans. She really wants to get to know Paul outside of school.

Paul sits on the couch with Winston. He compares their living situation to ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears."" Winston suggests a game. He'll say a word, Paul will say the first thing that pops into his head. Paul starts with kazoo. Winston hasn't started the game. He tries boundaries (important), other people's stuff (private) and loud early morning sex (nice work if you can get it).

Nick joins and asks what they're up to. ""Just two dudes, playing word association games, kicking back a couple of pumpkin ales,"" Paul says.

Nick turns on football. Paul thinks the Lions play in Des Moines.

In the kitchen, CeCe horrifies Schmidt by touching food without watching her hands. He tosses out an entire bowl of walnuts she tainted.

Paul remembers his grandmother and shows Jess a picture of her, saying they used to get in funny arm wrestling matches. Winston shares photos of his grandfather, including the day he tried to quit drinking and when he tried gelato.

Schmidt needs walnuts. Paul can't drive because he's had two pumpkin ales (even though Nick says they're lagers). Nick drives. Paul asks about law school, then says it's OK Nick dropped out because that's what your 20s are for. Nick's in his 30s.

They return and Paul tells Jess he doesn't think Nick likes him. CeCe helps Schmidt mash potatoes, but playfully dabs some on his nose. He freaks out.

There's a blast from the laundry room and a puff of smoke. Schmidt goes in for the bird and comes out with a charred corpse.

The apartment fills with smoke. (""It's like a Prince video!"") The guys bail and head to the bar. Paul tells them not to give up and tells Schmidt he wants to try the food he's been cooking all day. The guys all get on board and rally. They go to the neighbor's apartment. She's out of town, but Jess has a key for emergencies. (She gave the woman theirs because sometimes she has problems with her shower.)

With everyone else inside, Jess shuts the door and stays in the hall to yell at Nick for not being nicer to Paul. Everyone inside can hear them. She thinks Nick doesn't think he's cool enough. Nick says it doesn't matter what he thinks because he's not the one who's going to have sex with Paul. Jess shouts that she does want to have sex with him, big time. She elaborates, citing positions like bear claw and gimme that hat.

Winston finally comes out in the hallway and tells them they can hear everything they're saying.

Jess comes in and says they were rehearsing a play called ""Big Time"" about a man who loves a man named Paul and... she runs off.

Schmidt offers that he's done ""gimme that hat,"" but for him it was more like ""here, take my hat.""

Schmidt finishes cooking while Paul tunes his violin. CeCe assures him a normal guy would have left by now. CeCe is turned on by Schmidt yelling at her.

Paul tries to talk to Nick and cheerily tells him he feels sorry for him, because Nick will never dislike Paul more than he dislikes himself.

CeCe tries to instigate Schmidt again, but he says he'll never yell at her. She sticks her fingers in the food and licks them. He won't yell, but just gets totally grossed out.

Paul tells Jess he wants to see her again, ""big time,"" like the play.

Winston assures Nick he really likes Paul. He asked his grandfather's name, which Nick has never done.

Schmidt sets the table with food. Schmidt suggests Paul play something before they start. Nick sits down and starts eating green beans. Paul starts playing while Jess recites the school play. Paul dances around the living room to an open door and comes back shrieking ""dead body."" They've found the neighbor.

After the paramedics take the body away, Paul is totally shaken. Schmidt invites him to Best Buy, they're getting a new dryer. He gets on the elevator and is joined by the paramedics wheeling the dead neighbor, who he can't seem to escape.

Later in line at Best Buy, Jess hears playful violining. Paul joins them. He says that after he got off the elevator ride from hell, when the paramedics told him to stop crying like a girl and he told them it was sexiest, he decided life was too short. He brought turkey subs.

Nick goes to the back of the line so Paul can have his spot. Jess and Paul follow, along with everyone else. They marvel as Jess and Paul break out into their Thanksgiving jig again."

""I'm losing my mind guys, I sometimes touch the frayed part of the power cord, just to feel something,"" he says.

Jess comes home, checking that no one is expecting ""lady guests.""

She has students with her to rehearse bells. ""This is just like a nightmare I had were you brought over teenagers, with bells,"" Nick says. They picked music over early morning detention. A loud abrasive girl wants to eat Schmidt's water crackers, but he explains they're for adults to eat with adult cheeses.

They practice ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", but really it could be anything. Jess gives them five minutes of text time.

Desiree uses the bathroom, but manages to overflow the toilet. Nick turns on the faucet, opens the hole in the wall and fiddles with the plastic soda bottle in the wall. Cut to Nick ""fixing"" other things, like a puddle on the roof, by drilling a hole in the roof.

He says he can fancy fix the toilet if Schmidt only asks. He does.

They're interrupted by the majestic, complicated chiming of bells from the other room. Turns out Winston has mad bell skills.

Jess begs him for help. He says he's never rung before. She only needs him til the concert on Sunday. He's in.

Schmidt checks on Nick's progress under the toilet, but gets a lecture on self-reliance. ""All I'm hearing is that I can't use my toilet because you're poor,"" Schmidt says.

Jess takes Winston to rehearsal. He wants to know how you win at bells. She wants him to get the kids to try hard, but she says they won't listen to him.

Nick comes home to find Schmidt paying a plumber. Nick says he won't use it. He accuses Schmidt of being the kid who was born rich, whose bar mitzvah cost $40,000. They get in a fight about the time Schmidt spilled Midori Sour on Nick's bedspread his Nonny made him.

Schmidt reminds him he paid for the couch Nick is sitting on, and the rug he moves to. Nick retaliates by ripping out the cable cord -- he stole the cable. Nick storms off.

""And my bar mitzvah was an amazing event. The theme was sports jams!"" Schmidt shouts.

Jess rehearses with the kids and Winston dazzles with his ability. The kids applaud. He suggests to ""win"" the concert they play ""Eye of the Tiger.""

Jess insists she's cool, too, and tries to show off, but ends up doing a robot bell-player. Winston encourages the kids to skip school to learn ""Eye of the Tiger.""

Nick tries to explain Winston to Jess, as he tinkers with the basketball hoop, that he's talented but a jerk about it. He says some guys are just dumb about this stuff. Schmidt takes the basketball and tries to shoot, but the hoop falls on him. Nick ""unfixed"" it. They're arguing again.

Nick wakes up to find piles of frozen food all over his bed. Schmidt pops in to point out he paid for the freezer.

At his temp job, Winston, in a giant paper funny hat, practices ""Eye of the Tiger"" on paper bells. He gets fired.

Later with the kids, he drills them on the meaning of the song. One girl brown noses with a man and his will to survive. They practice and ""Eye of the Tiger"" sounds pretty good. But Winston isn't happy and berates the kids. He tells Desiree it looks like she's fighting a shark, when she should be trying to pet the dolphin.

Jess goes to the cupboard and the door falls off. ""This has to stop! It's not my war!""

Schmidt approaches Nick and suggests they talk things through. Then he finds that Nick put his freezer and his couch in his room. Schmidt notices Nick hair smells like his lotus pear conditioner. He wants it back. He starts squeezing it out of Nick's hair.

Schmidt puts up his dukes, but runs when Nick chases him. They do laps around the kitchen island.

Finally Schmidt shouts and tells Nick he chose to be a bartender, he chose to quit law school, he's not some hardscrabble guy, he's just a ""loser."" Nick walks off. ""These are the things that come out when you take another man's conditioner,"" Schmidt says.

Jess comes home after dress rehearsal angry at Winston. The kids freaked out in the park and ran off. Winston says he doesn't care and Jess explains that he can't be one more person telling them they're not good.

Nick and Winston share a beer on the roof. Nick explains the problem with getting older is you have friends who've known you for way too long and know all your weaknesses. ""I want friends who still lie to me because they don't want to hurt my feelings,"" he says.

Winston marvels that he got fired from a temp job and got kicked out of bell group for yelling at kids. He knows it was a low point. Nick gently reminds him it's not about him. Nick and Winston head to the bells concert. Schmidt joins after grabbing his cardigan.

At the park, the kids perform as ""Ensembell."" Winston joins them on stage and they play.

Schmidt tells Nick he doesn't really think he's a loser. ""I can't hear anything you say when you wear that sweater, Schmidt. You just open your mouth and I hear 'Cardigan. I am wearing a cardigan,'"" Nick says. They share some gum and enjoy some bad, but enthusiastic, bell playing."

She sings a brief ditty about intercourse then excuses herself to the bathroom for a sex pep talk.

Later, she apologizes for getting nervous and ruining it. She hasn't had sex with anyone but Spencer in six years. She suggests instead they go to dinner tomorrow night and then do each other like crazy. No pressure.

In the living room, Nick gets stressed out confirming his hair appointment. He dreads getting stuck in a chair and being forced to make conversation. He declines an invitation to go to Winston's black barbershop (he doesn't need to seem cooler than he already does) or Schmidt's sa-lon. Jess joins them and announces Paul's coming over tonight and she plans to ""tap that like a maple tree.""

At work, Schmidt gets stalked by Beth, his coworker who times how long he's in the bathroom. She tries to make him confess he pooped. He learns the corner cubicle is free. His coworker thinks she has it locked up because she's been invited to their boss's baby shower. Schmidt feels left out.

Jess makes CeCe go lingerie shopping with her. She's worried she's out of the loop. ""Everything I know about sex I learned from Spencer or the Clinton impeachment trial,"" Jess explains.

She selects a teddy that's mostly straps, with a black starfish in the center. She can't try it on, per the health code. She talks it up. ""I hope Paul's packing some coral polyps, because this starfish is hungry,"" she growls. Because starfish eat coral polyps.

Winston finds Nick about to give himself a home haircut while watching a YouTube video. He finds out why it has so many views when the guy stabs himself and squirts blood.

Schmidt drops in his boss Gina's office. He invites himself to her shower and then announces he's getting her a breast pump.

Jess comes home talking on the phone to Paul. She wants to look up where they're going to dinner and opens the laptop that was left out. She's transfixed by the porn and has to call Paul back. The noises start to get weirder and Jess is intimidated.

Schmidt finds her later in her room, still watching the laptop. She confesses she's been watching porn. ""How long you been doing that for? Are you OK?"" Five and a half hours.

The guys conference. She asks them to teach her how to be good at sex. She's freaking out. She wants to know what they like in bed, but can't use any of the words. She asks if they think Paul watches porn, they assure her he does. Schmidt thinks he might be into light choking.

Schmidt and Winston think they're better at sex than Nick. Winston reminds him what he said the first time he had sex: ""Winston, do you think it's OK I didn't get my pants all the way off?"" Nick says he was 16, but Schmidt says he heard him with Caroline all through college. It was like listening to a rescue crew communicate with a stranded miner. They keep arguing so they ask Jess to settle who she thinks is best.

She's saved by Paul knocking on the door. Jess excuses herself to go try on her strappy outfit.

Gina's baby shower is a cocktail party at her pool. Schmidt insinuates himself into a conversation, which Gina says is about afterbirth. He thinks it's a party and he wants to be invited. Beth interrupts him. Schmidt gets up on the pool wall to make a speech about the blessed event of birth. Beth toasts elective C-sections and gets a woo Schmidt challenges her, saying he was in two frats in college. He raises a bottle of Jack and announces everyone's getting drunk.

Jess and Paul are nervous on their date. She tells him she's looking forward to having sex later. She asks if he likes porn. He says no until she says she does. Then he says he watches it sometimes if his imagination is tired or he's ""exhausted his bullpen.""

At the baby shower, Schmidt is the life of the party. He's chugging and totally raging. His boss Gina loves it. Then he throws her in the pool. The party stops. She comes to the surface and shouts that she's having a baby, thrilled! Schmidt jumps in, followed by everyone else.

Back at the apartment, Jess takes Paul into the bedroom and shows off her starfish. She tries on her old newscaster voice. He tries a voice and ends up with Jimmy Stewart. She ends up with an old lady voice. He can't get her out of the starfish. She segues into a loud lumberjack voice and he asks if they can just go back to basics.

He kisses her sweetly. And then she chokes him. She holds it a little too long. He wants some water -- from home.

The next morning, Nick tells Winston he's really glad he convinced him to go to his barbershop. Then we see Nick's hair, with a razor line above his ear and a Vanilla Ice 'do. Jess comes out for tea and they ask how it went. She throws things.

A hot blond comes out of Schmidt's room.

Winston and Nick check on Jess. She confesses she lightly choked Paul. She's used to not having to think about it. Nick tries to offer advice, but she doesn't think his hair is that of a person who's good at sex. Winston assures her that Paul is crazy about her.

Paul drops by. She apologizes. He tells her he's intimidated by her because he's not experienced in S & M like she is. But he'll try it because he really likes her. ""Just no fire and no handcuffs, please. And I'm allergic to felt, and most polyurethanes.""

Jess says she's not into any of that stuff, she just thought her old moves weren't good enough. She gets in the elevator with him to ride down. They start making out. He takes off her clothes and they stop the elevator.

The guys all wait for the elevator. It comes back up with Paul and Jess in it. Her shoe is in the corner."

Schmidt gets up and we see he's in skates, too. He tries to tackle Winston at a slow roll. Nick, also in skates, tries to intervene, but they end up in a pile. Jess comes in, needing their help on getting a present for Paul. After only a month, she's not sure what's appropriate. She shows Nick the card she made for ""Nerdy weird sex that works for both of us"".

""Oh my god, now I know what to get my mom!"" Nick says.

On the way from the mall, Jess drives them through a neighborhood decked out with Christmas decorations. She wants to come back at night on the way from the office party to the airport, but Nick is resolved not to miss his flight for the fifth year in a row.

CeCe is at work on a set in a bra and panties. Schmidt drops by with a gift. It's a shoot for a before and after for a Bolivian diet pill. They're interrupted by Kyle, who frenches CeCe hello. Schmidt explains he designed the perfume for her. It gets awkward.

Paul and Jess exchange gifts. He got her tickets to Vienna and passes to a show. She got him an anatomically correct fuzzy heart of a 50 year old non-smoker. It beats. She wants to get him something better, but he tells her it's fuzzy and quirky and sweet, just like her. He says he loves it several times, then hugs her and says he loves her. She pauses, then goes with ""Thank you.""

The gang arrives for Schmidt's office party. They find him wearing only red boxers and dressed as ""sexy Santa.""

Jess tells Nick what Paul says and he advises her to tell Paul if she doesn't feel the same way. She tells him she'll do it.

Instead, Jess hides in the bathroom.

Nick sees Paul standing alone outside and goes to talk to him. He asks if Jess talked to him and Paul says yes, so Nick reassures him that just because Jess doesn't love him now doesn't mean she won't one day. Paul says she told him they might have to leave for the airport early. Nick tries to pretend he's drunk, or joking or anything to rescue the situation, but it's too late.

Jess and CeCe hide in the bathroom. Kyle wants to go to another party. Jess thinks he's the ""living worst"" and asks if he even got her anything. He didn't. CeCe tries her Schmidt perfume, but inhales and hacks ferociously.

Winston complains to someone about the rigors of having a job and office life. We see it's a kid. Schmidt's boss Gina comes over, it's her son. She's impressed he's talking to Winston since he doesn't usually talk to people.

Schmidt sees Kyle mock CeCe for wearing the mustache Jess gave her. CeCe hears Schmidts mean coworker harassing him and tries to tell him to stand up for himself. He notices the bad smell and she tells him it's his perfume, but he's just glad she wore it.

Outside on the awkward balcony, Paul begs Nick to tell him what Jess says. Nick tells him that Jess said the sex was incredible but she doesn't want to rush into anything.

Jess sees them hugging and goes outside. Paul tries to cover for what they were talking about but only comes up with they both like jazz music. Nick confesses he told Paul she doesn't love him. Jess starts yelling at him and Nick tries to leave, only to find he's locked out on the balcony with them.

Jess tries to talk to Paul gently, saying she feels overwhelmed. She says she got really badly hurt and is trying to not get hurt again. Nick's cell phone rings and he answers, explaining that he can't talk because he's in a weird situation.

Jess asks if they can keep going, just slow things down. Paul says he's not sure he can. Nick pipes up, but Jess shushes him.

Schmidt finds Kim in the supply room with a bunch of women and tells Kim he's done being Santa. ""Santa's dead, I killed him!"" Schmidt says. Gina's son hears and runs screaming. Schmidt tells him she needs to start taking him seriously, so no more Sexy Easter Bunny, Cinco de Sexy or Sexy Martin Luther King Day. Kim says she can't believe it took him five years to say so.

Winston fields a call from Nick's mom and assures her he'll make his flight. Gina comes over, panicked that she can't find her son. Winston helps look, sure somehow it's Schmidt's fault.

Back outside in awkwardtown, Paul tells Jess he can't slow down and if she needs to then he can't do this anymore. Jess says OK. Nick, the peanut gallery, tells Paul to consider the fact it's Christmas.

Winston interrupts looking for the kid, freeing Nick from his awkward prison by opening the patio door.

Winston wanders out front and finds Alvin in an igloo. He assures him Santa isn't dead. Alvin asks if Schmidt was just being a ""d-bag"", because that's what his mom said. Winston assures him he'll get extra presents this year. Alvin thanks Winston, but calls him ""LeBron."" Gina finds them and gives Winston her card. She says if he ever wants to hang out with Alvin again she'll pay him a lot of money, like whatever he's thinking, plus a lot more.

The guys, Jess and CeCe drive to the airport. Nick, the driver, sees that Jess is bumming out and makes a detour. They pull into Candycane Lane, but it's late and the lights are all off.

Jess laments her bad timing. Nick goes to knock on the people's door, shouting that there's a girl who really wants to see the lights. Everyone joins in, shouting at all the houses to turn on the lights. One by one they all come on, in an explosion of wonderful tacky lights. Back in the car, Nick gets a call from his mom and tells her he's going to miss his flight. He hands the call off to Winston as the lights go off."

Schmidt is shocked he has to put $50 in the douchebag jar. Jess thinks it should be more like $250.

Three Days Ago Schmidt forlornly announces that he lost the party bus for his birthday party to Frankie Muniz. He doesn't think he can get a new one in two days that has a stripper pole, ""love grotto"", and steering wheel in the shape of a boob -- you honk the nipple.

He scoffs at Nick's suggestion to just have it in a bar. It's his 29th birthday and he think it's all downhill from here. He goes off to his room, crying a little.

Jess checks on him He worries canceling his party will ruin his ""It"" factor. Plus, he worries what Benjamin will think. They have a very female relationship; they hate each other. ""We're bro-nemies, he's my fremisis,"" he explains. They were suitemates in college.

Flash back to Schmidt and Benjamin driving to Los Angeles, when Schmidt weighed a lot more. Benjamin promised he'd be rich some day and wrote Schmidt a check for $100 million.

Jess hears his sad little story and goes and suggestions to Winston and Nick that they throw Schmidt a party. They explain they're not from his world, where everything gets shortened to one syllable. He called an oven ""oves"" and an airport ""airp."" He went to a party themed ""Bros before hos on the moon,"" they're not even sure what that means.

""You are not mentally, emotionally and spiritually prepared to throw these d-bags a party,"" Nick tells her.

Nick excuses himself, wearing his ""jury duty face.""

He goes to a lawyer party with Julie (Lizzy Caplan), doing Bill Cosby impressions to woo her. It works. She agrees to leave with him, but thinks it's weird after five dates that they never go to his place. He confesses he lives in a loft with three roommates, but ""in a hot way."" She's still charmed.

Back home, Jess calls to order a ""last minute stripper"", she asks for an Asian one with a heart of gold...and a crotch of gold.

Nick brings Julie home and Winston and Jess invite her to the party Saturday. Nick lets Winston know he doesn't appreciate it.

Jess gets off the phone. ""Thank you, Miss Fat Booty, you're the best!""

Jess goes through the confiscation drawer at work looking for weed and gets busted by the principal Tanya (Rachael Harris). She asks what she's got cooking and offers to do a locker search to supply her. She invites herself to the party.

Jess leads Schmidt out of the apartment, covering his eyes, even though he's got a ""egg yellows omelet cooking and the shallots and gouda are going to congeal."" She reveals his party bus: a school bus with a sign on it. The principal is there.

Jess show him the decorated inside, with supplies of both kosher yogurt and condoms.

Julie is fascinated by Nick's world, even as he tries to distance himself from everyone. Benjamin arrives, calling him ""N-word.""

He makes fun of the school bus and asks Schmidt to sing his birthday song, to the tune of ""We Built this City."" Instead it's ""We built this Schmidty on Tootsie Rolls...."" Which, Benjamin explains they used to make him sing because he was fat.

Nick tries to explain he met Schmidt long ago when he was just chubby communications major. Julie assures him she likes his friends, but Nick says it's OK to make fun of them, saying that Winston likes ""Sister, Sister"" and is afraid of thunder. Winston is standing behind him. Nick apologizes, saying he just showing off to Julie. Winston promises to bring him down.

Inside, Schmidt enjoys the ""Bro juice"" Jess made and is impressed that Benjamin is enjoying himself.

An awkward nerdy, slightly too old man gets on the bus and checks out the stripper pole. He's the stripper. They assumed she wanted a man. Jess offers him $50 not to show them his junk. He worries about the lost tips. She asks if he can do anything else for money. He's the baritone in his church choir.

The bus rolls out. Jess uses the buses microphone to address the group, asking them to stick with their bus buddies and wear their safety helmets. The stripper sings them out with a gospel song.

Back to the douchebag jar, and Schmidt objecting that he's never had to put $50 in before. Flash back to him announcing to Jess that his personalized condoms just arrived and getting fined $20. Then asking Winston if he knew NWA didn't stand for ""Never Walk Alone"" and getting fined $30 and finally just walking in in a fitted tank top and army cap and getting fined.

Nick tells him he outdid himself this time. Schmidt defends that it was his birthday and he was very drunk.

Flashback to Last Night Jess riles up the crowd, to get them chanting for Schmidt to do shots of ""bro juice."" Nick tells Julie he has no idea what it is, and Winston points out Nick invented bro juice on Schmidt's 22nd birthday. Nick apologizes that it's not going to pretty then drinks directly out of the Gatorade cooler.

Benjamin watches Jess and asks Schmidt if he's ""hitting that."" Schmidt says no, and Benjamin suggests he might just help himself. Schmidt tries to tell him no.

On the return bus, Tanya passes out and Schmidt asks the stripper for stripper intel. He asks his persona, the stripper is a ""wolf hawk."" Schmidt is into it until he learns it's mostly dancing for dudes.

Nick thinks he's blown it with Julie, but she says she's just intimidated to be sitting next to the inventor of ""bro juice."" She says as long as he doesn't lie to her, they're fine. Nick confesses that on the rare occasions he works out, he listens to Huey Lewis, not ironically, because it pumps him up. He doesn't believe she has weird stuff, too.

Benjamin sidles up to Jess and tells her he got them -- just them -- on the list for a club. ""So why don't you ditch that zero and get with a hero. The hero's my penis,"" he says. Jess tries to melt into the bus wall to get away.

Schmidt sees it happening and tells Benjamin to back off, who then says the party sucks. One by one, on a moving bus, Winston, then Nick tries to get Benjamin to cool it. Finally Julie walks up to him, telling him to say it one more time. Then she decks him in the face and punches him in the ribs. Someone falls over into the driver and the bus crashes to a stop.

Julie is horrified at herself. ""Who are you?"" Nick asks, equally horrified.

Cabs come to take people away. Julie confesses she has anger management issues and is going to court-ordered classes. She figures he's freaked out. He kisses her. It bothers him that he's turned on by her crazy, but she urges him to go with it.

Jess and drunk Schmidt wait for the tow truck. He tells her tonight was ""10s across the board, no splash."" He looks deep into her eyes and leans in. In slow motion, she leans away, realizing he was about to kiss her. He tries to play it off like he was going to get some fuzz off her face.

Cut to the douchebag jar, him being sentenced to $50 for trying to kiss Jess.

Close with a montage of douchebag jar offenses, including Schmidt looking for his ""good peacoat"", his ""other timepiece"" and his ""driving moccasins""."

In the bathroom, Jess tells her she enjoys having another girl around and that there are tampons hidden everywhere. Schmidt takes exception to the ladies, even after Jess points out most of the hair products are his. He admits he uses sculpting chutney, and pronounces it ""chut-en-y"".

Everyone ends up in the bathroom and Julia bails. Jess has plans to see her later, Julia's helping her get out of a ticket. Nick objects to her using ""the girl he's sleeping with"" for favors. Not his girlfriend, they're not labeling it. Jess does a sophisticated voice and dance as she mocks him. Winston tries to improve on it and the guys conclude he needs to get laid. Winston debates calling Shelby, a girl he hasn't seen since he got back from Latvia.

Cut to Winston out with Shelby, talking about himself non-stop. He finally asks ""your place or mine?"" and gets laughed at. He took her out for drinks at the place where she works. She gives him his bill and thanks him for the water.

At the apartment, Jess settles Julia in and offers her a couch blanket and cookies and cupcakes. The ticket has a picture of Jess behind the wheel. She says she braked to avoid a bird, then had to speed up. She missed her first court date because her ex didn't send her the notice because he doesn't believe in the mail. Now it's an $800 fine.

Julia says she'll give it a chance, a ""judge might go for this whole 'thing'."" She means Jess' cupcakes and braking for birds and big eyes ""like a scared baby.""

Julia tries to casually ask if there are a lot of girls coming by, but Jess is saved by Nick coming home. After Julia goes to hide in Nick's room, Jess tells him Julia doesn't like her.

Jess tells Ce Ce and Sadie, the lesbian gynecologist, about Julia saying she has a ""thing"". When Nick comes in, the girls give him grief and he asks what Julia said. They try to explain it's just how girls are mean. Jess remembers a time a girl told her ""you rock a lot of polka dots"" and it ruined their friendship.

Nick explains that Julia isn't like other girls and doesn't do subtext. He claims she's upfront about everything.

Jess asks if Julia asked him if he was seeing other girls, because she asked Jess if he was.

Out that night, Nick freaks out that he's in a relationship. Winston worries about not getting laid and thinks he only got action because he played basketball. Nick can't believe he's just now figuring that out.

Julia comes in and joins them, saying she thought she'd just ""drop by."" Nick is flummoxed, saying he didn't know they were doing drop bys.

Nick says Jess told him about her asking if he was seeing other people.

Julia tries to explain that's not what happened, then says she only mentioned it because she's dating other guys and didn't want to feel bad.

Nick deflects, saying he's having tons of sex, including right now, behind the bar. They agree about not labeling again and Julia goes to the bathroom.

Jess finds Julia and tries to apologize, but Julia is having none of it, saying she can see what Jess is up to. Julia says she's just the lawyer who wears suits and Jess is ""the really fun teacher girl with all the colorful skirts and you bake things and eventually Nick is going to come running to you and you'll tuck him in under his blankie....""

Jess cuts her off, but finally Julia says she doesn't like her and she asks Jess to leave because she's about to cry and Jess is the last person she wants to cry in front of.

So Jess leaves crying. She runs into the men's room to cry but finds Nick crying there.

Winston visits Shelby at her restaurant, announcing that he's come to listen to her. She points out she was a booty call for two years, then nothing for two years. He says he's an idiot and she's way out his league and he'll leave her alone if she wants, but he'd like to see her again.

Jess waits her turn in court. Julia comes in, telling Jess to just enter her plea and let Julia do the rest. Jess cuts it all short by pleading guilty.

In the hall, Julia mocks her, saying they'll never know if the ""I brake for birds"" defense works. Jess tells her off, saying that she does brake for birds, and rocks polka dots and she's freaked out that Julia is not a dessert person and wishes Julia's pantsuit had ribbons on it or something to make it cuter, but that doesn't mean Jess isn't smart and tough and strong.

Finally, Jess tells Julia to just talk to Nick.

""I'm about to pay this $800 fine and my checks have baby farm animals on them, bitch,"" Jess says, storming off.

Winston walks Shelby home and asks if he can take her on a real date. She says he can call her and he does a celebration dance before she's in her door.

Schmidt reaches for a towel in the shower, but comes up empty because he put it in his room to avoid it getting damp.

He ends up walking to his room covered by a washcloth as Jess, Ce Ce and Sadie sit on the couch. He segues into a sex rant, telling Jess he only wanted a girl roommate because he thought it would lead to sex with her, or at least her friends, but he's getting nowhere. (The apron he puts on for cover has a tampon in the pocket.)

Julia knocks on the door, she came to talk to Jess but struggles to get out an apology. She sees that Jess has company and Jess invites her for crocheting time.

Cut to Julia talking about her childhood.

Nick comes home and she asks to talk to him. He braces himself for the worst, but she tells him she doesn't want to date other people, she just wants to date him. So this means he's her boyfriend.

In the bathroom, Schmidt revels in the new towel racks, thinking they'll solve his damp towel problem. But his towel is still damp so he summons the group.

Nick quickly solves the mystery by clarifying that he thinks his towel is the one Schmidt also thinks is his. They've been using the same towel, and Nick never washes it because he figures he's clean when he uses it."

The guy backs down and drives a way. ""I can't believe this is working, you out-crazyed a man with a gun,"" Nick says.

Schmidt freaks out, thinking he's getting mixed signals from his boss, when she tells him about a conference call. Winston says it's always in Schmidt's head. Cut to Schmidt refusing a delivery when the man tells him he has a package for him, because he had a package for him.

Back home, Jess and Nick come home arguing. Jess accuses him of being negative. The garbage disposal goes haywire and Nick deals with it by sticking a broom handle in and fighting with it. She wants to call the landlord, but they assure her he's a terrible person.

Schmidt brings a budget report to his boss Kim, trying to make it sound sexy. She takes off her jacket and tells him to sort her files, where she can watch. He tries to toy with a file, but it just comes off weird.

Jess goes down to the basement with cupcakes for the landlord, who appears to be making a spear out of a broom handle. She admires his bucket of gasoline, ""super practical."" She asks him to fix their safety concerns, but he says no. She mentions the ""four of us up there"" and he tells her their apartment is only supposed to have three.

She goes up and tells the guys as the landlord knocks on the door. They go into action, dragging a bed out onto the balcony and telling Jess to call Schmidt ""Jimmy.""

The landlord knows Nick as Brad and Winston as Coach. Schmidt adopts a vague Eastern European accent and leaves with a suitcase as soon as he gets there.

Schmidt's room is empty except for a chair. They're calling it the library.

He finds a weird sex mural in Winston's closet, with black lighting. It used to be Schmidt's. The landlord relents, telling them four people is fine, as long as they paint over the sex wall and don't bother him anymore. The guys want to let him leave, but Jess asks him to fix a few things. She calls him Remy, because he has a tattoo that says ""Hello, my name is Remy"".

At work, Kim tells Schmidt to clean up her hard drive. Then she repeats it slowly.

Remy fixes Jess's closet door, talking about not seeing his divorce coming. He tries to help her open the door, getting behind her and grunting.

Nick sees and asks to talk to Jess alone. He points out Remy wants to sleep with her. ""Any time a man shows a woman how to do something from behind, it's just an excuse for him to get really close and breathe on her neck, watch any sports movie,"" he tells her. She accuses him of seeing the worst in people, but he says that's because people are the worst.

Remy strolls out in his undershirt, telling Jess he hopes she doesn't mind the smell of a real man in her room. He's ready to get started on her bed.

Winston goes through the closet and finds something wonderful on a piece of paper.

CeCe drops by on her way to see Kyle on Greg Kinnear's boat. Schmidt describes his ""sex marathon"" with his boss, saying that he feels like he's in mile 25 and is cramping and peeing down his leg. She tells him to go for it, that there's nothing less sexy than a man asking permission.

""Nothing? What if I ate my own hair and pooped out a wig? What if I called my mom after sex, to describe it to her? What if I had a croissant blog?"" he offers.

Nick and Winston come home with whatever Winston found. He reads from it. ""Everything is easy when you are a battleship invading the bay of success."" It's Schmidt's New Year's Eve resolutions from 2007, including ""Stop pursing Caroline, she's Nick's girl. Deal with it.""

No. 5: Find out where Winston gets his sparkle, then steal it.

Jess comes out to tell them a really funny thing that just happened. Remy was fixing the sink and it sprayed all over Jess and she got really wet. She invited him to dinner to thank him. They all have other plans until Nick realizes Jess would be alone with him.

The three of them sit down to dinner. Remy brought a bottle of something. ""I ferment things in the basement,"" he says. ""I also make cheese."" Jess tries it, but spits it out. Nick needs to say sober to fight Remy later. Jess reminds him to be nice and dip his toe in the pool of possibilities.

Jess tells Nick he has a lot in common with Remy, including that they both just went through bad break ups. ""Did you go out looking for companionship, a little human warmth, only to come to in the woods, covered in animal blood?"" Remy asks. ""In my own way,"" Nick says.

Schmidt walks Kim to the elevator. She says she's going to go home and open a bottle of wine. He says he's doing the same and walks to his car. Then he tosses down his key and races to her car, throwing open the door. He announces he wants her, now.

""Finally!"" she says. He pulls her out of her car and starts kissing her, but the security guards watching think something else is going on. They pull up and throw him to the ground.

Back at the apartment, Remy thanks them for a good time and goes to the bathroom. Jess confronts Nick, trying to get him to admit he was wrong about Remy wanting to sleep with her.

Remy comes back in his boxer shorts. ""I've never done a threesome. That's what we're doing here, right?"" he asks.

Cut to Nick telling Jess he loves watching her be wrong. They argue again over whether people are good or bad. She's not ready to back down. Nick can't believe she'd have a threesome just to prove she's right. She announces they're having a threesome.

They walk into the bedroom, where Remy wants to get the rules straight. ""OK, this is happening, with this guy, Jess?"" Nick says. Remy puts on some music.

Nick urges Jess to say she's wrong as Remy comes up behind Nick and starts rubbing his neck. He tells him he's going to unbutton Nick's pants, then Nick gets to be the ""Underpants Captain"". Jess thinks that sounds great.

Remy suggests Nick and Jess get things started. They dare each other, each saying they're up for it. ""Say that you're wrong, and this is all over,"" Nick tells her. He says he can do it, but she can't. She won't back down until he grabs her to kiss her and she shoves him off. ""Fine! I admit it! I'm wrong!"" Jess says.

Remy assures them cold feet is part of the journey.

Winston wanders by and asks what's going on. Remy says he isn't ready for a four-way. He bails.

Later, at the table, Nick admits he's on a weird ego high. Winston flips a light switch, blowing a fuse. They agree they have to live with it.

At work, Schmidt with his shiner and busted lip, checks with Kim that he's not going to lose his job. He's had a thing for her since he was the husky kid in the mail room. As proof he offers up his 2007 resolutions, No. 4 ""Only think about hot new CFO every-other time I masturbate.""

No. 9: Just pick a color of Crocs and buy them already.

Kim tells him to go into the conference room and dial her into the Tokyo call, now. She says it kind of breathlessly.

Schmidt long-distance flirts with a girl. Ce Ce tries to help by making her jealous, draping herself over Schmidt. The moment is ruined when Kyle arrives, having just eaten three 'shrooms. Ce Ce knows it's time to go because he's about to get real antsy and a little racist.

Jess comes back and announces she's ready to go home with Oliver. He's described every lunch he had this week and three of them were tacos, he's the most boring person she's ever met. She has a 100 box of condoms, just in case. But she needs a ride.

Julia starts kissing him, but they're interrupted by her work call. She takes it, apologizing.

Shelby says good bye to her girlfriends. Winston admits he wasn't expecting a girl's night. Shelby tells him he keeps making up for how he used to be. Valentine's Day 2008, he said he'd call and never did. He knows he doesn't deserve a second chance. But she gives him one anyway.

She searches for a word that means complete satisfaction and complete self-loathing. CeCe swears it was the last time, but she said that two times last night. He sneaks her out, but Jess catches him shutting the door.

She thinks it was the same girl from before. ""Oh my god, you slept with the same girl twice in a row! Was it a mistake? Was she wearing some kind of a disguise?""

Jess announces to Nick that Schmidt slept with the same girl two nights in a row, so she owes Nick $5.

They want to meet her and wonder what's wrong with her: hunchback, Lovitz body?

At school, Jess admires her class's science projects. Briana built a robotic arm. A chubby kid named Nathaniel asks Jess if he can eat lunch in the classroom. The kids at lunch started playing a game called ""coin slot"", they put pennies in his butt crack.

He made 46 cents, which he offers to Jess. ""No, no, you earned that,"" she refuses.

At home, Nick tries to figure out what the cactus Julia sent him from her business trip means. He thinks she's going to break up with him because he can't take care of a regular plant.

Nick tells Jess his theory and she laughs. He explains it's a symbol of their relationship. Then he trips and drops it.

Alone in his room, Schmidt takes a picture of his junk (then does red eye correction three times...wait for it). CeCe calls from out front, full of self-loathing as she invites him down.

Schmidt gets dressed and sneaks out as Nick glues his cactus back together. Jess explains that she taught a lesson at school today. Cut to her strumming guitar and singing about a ""plump bird"" who gets chased by predators as Nathaniel plays the back-up Casio in the front of the class.

Jess explains that music can really make a difference and that kids were taping her with cell phones. Winston immediately finds it on YouTube, with a few enhancements. Jess's head is on the bird's body and other birds are flying over and pooping on her head. They're not bullying Nathaniel anymore, they're bullying her.

At the curb, CeCe explains they can't go to her to her place because there are 12 models in two rooms. She suggests car sex, but Schmidt says he can't do any of his moves in there.

""I'm like a sexual snowflake, each night with me is a unique experience,"" he says. She's ready to go now. ""Isn't there like a Starbucks bathroom or something around here?"" ""What am I, a gypsy courtesan?"" Schmidt asks.

Upstairs, Winston and Nick wonder how Jess is going to punish the kid who made the video. She plans to find them and ""open up a dialogue"". Winston says he used to be a bully.

Cut to him as a kid giving a kid a nipple twister and calling out ""brown lightning"". He had his own catch phrase.

Jess gets a call from Schmidt that there's a crescent moon tonight. She and Winston race to the window to look and Schmidt sneaks CeCe in. Then they realize they don't care about crescent moons.

Nick leaves Jess a message, thanking her for the cactus, and closing with ""you're the best around"". He calls back, saying he gets it, he's the cactus. A few beers later, he's saying he'd grow needles in the desert, too. He leaves a few more, asking her to call him back as he rolls around on his bed.

Then he leaves one saying he just realized about the time difference and to delete the others. He closes with ""I love you"" followed quickly by ""what?!?"".

CeCe prepares to sneak out of Schmidt's and promises again that it was the last time. But he says they haven't even gotten to the cheese course, a little sharp cheddar, manchengo.... (It makes no sense and is still somehow creepy).

""Why is this working? I am so turned on right now,"" she says. Then she changes her mind and leaves the room, but doesn't get far because Jess is in the living room, trying to figure out how to remove something from the Internet.

CeCe goes back to Schmidt. ""Fine, give me the damn cheese,"" she says, stripping.

Jess finds Briana's robot arm in the music video and the next day tries to talk to Briana. Instead she gets an inquisition about why she doesn't have a boyfriend and is she barren and why is her voice so deep like a man's and why does her happiness seem like a mask?

Briana leaves and Jess rips the robotic arm off, but instantly regrets it.

Julia comes to Nick's and he greets her at the door with his broken cactus. He immediately apologizes, saying that he over-reacted and he's sorry.

She says she didn't mean anything by it, but then she says she thinks they should break up. She didn't think it at the time, but after listening to his seven messages about it, it sort of clicked. She's sorry.

""So I was right about the cactus?"" he asks.

Jess calls Winston to confess. She asks for tools to fix it. Nick comes out cradling his cactus and a six pack and tells Winston that Julia broke up with him. He's high as a kite, but putting on a happy face.

Nick and Winston visit Jess, bringing scissors.

CeCe takes Schmidt to a party, where she proposes he wait in the car for her while she goes inside. She offers to crack a window for him.

He asks if she's ashamed of him. ""Yes, absolutely. I am 100% ashamed of you,"" she says. He agree to not go into the party if she goes to breakfast with him tomorrow. She agrees.

At the science fair, Winston checks out the displays. ""What can old people do?"" and ""Does it taste better with hot sauce?""

Briana strolls over to her experiment and her moms give Jess a disapproving look. Briana fires it up and the arm sparks and dies. Her moms turn on her and Briana claims someone sabotaged it.

Briana blames Nathaniel and her moms call for his head. Jess confesses she broke the science project and says that Briana is ""difficult"". Winston interjects that she sucks and is the demon seed.

The moment is interrupted by stoned Nick shouting for everyone to get along and then breaking down in tears, saying that we're all going to die alone.

The principal calls Jess to her office at 9 a.m.

The principal assures the moms she'll be watching Jess closely. They leave and Jess apologizes to Tanya, but she's not concerned at all. She's proud of Jess for becoming one of them: a ""kid hater"".

Back in class, Jess talks to Briana and tells her it's OK if she doesn't like her style, but Briana's just going to have to deal with it. And sing a duet with her in front of the class. Camera phones are encouraged.

CeCe has breakfast with Schmidt at a diner entirely full of old people. She tells him they're not in a relationship and she doesn't want to be a prize that he gets to show off. He wants to tell people because she is the ""dopest, flyest, smartest, ballsiest, bitchiest, truly terrifying woman that I have sexually enjoyed in a really long time"".

""Do you want to tell the waitress?"" she asks. He stands up and calls the restaurant to attention, then announces that he's having sex with this woman. He finishes it off with a failed ""parkour!""

Nick mopes in his room. Jess brings him a plant. She knows he'll kill it. ""You're a plant killer, and I write songs. We're weirdos, but that's who we are,"" she says.

Later, they all watch Jess's song with Briana: ""Let me Lift You Up with my Robot Arm""."

Schmidt widely overthrows a wide open Nick, who starts to complain about the bad throw, but then gets completely jacked up by Jess. She puts a stick on him and levels him and he can't help but whine in pain.

Nick hobbles to the car, holding his back. ""Are you sure you're OK? You're walking like a Disney witch,"" Jess says, offering to drive him to his doctor. He doesn't have insurance and he refuses to go to doctors.

They watch him get in his car and drive away, only to slam into the already demolished bumper of Winston's ancient SUV. Jess insists on taking him to see her friend Sadie.

In the waiting room, Nick looks around and notices all the women are pregnant. ""Jess, is Sadie a gynecologist?"" Nick asks. ""No, she's an OB-GYN,"" Jess says. Nick tries to leave, but can't walk.

Winston takes his SUV to Sherman the mechanic, who says it's time to put it down. The SUV was given to him as an illegal recruitment gift from a college he didn't even go to. He's not ready to part with it. He takes the keys (the paperclip he starts the car with) and drives off.

In the exam room, Sadie feels Nick's back, which pretty much hurts everywhere. She clarifies that it's not an official exam and she's not officially telling him to take pills for the pain. She hands him up pills, which she tells him not to take. Jess tells him to take them. Sadie says don't. Finally, Nick pops them.

""Those are designed for severe menstrual cramps, so they should cure your baby back ache,"" Sadie says.

She watches Nick take a sip of water but then wants to touch his thyroid. He has a growth. Nick knew about it, but was ignoring it.

Sadie insists on setting up an ultrasound for Nick tomorrow morning, saying he'll have to find a way to afford it.

Later, Nick makes excuses to Jess about why he isn't going to go to the appointment, including that he's going to do some writing and has to work out and he lost a stamp. And he has to record whale sounds. Jess tells him he's going and does a Daffy Duck impression to try to sooth his fear.

Nick has to go to work. Jess insists on going. Winston and Schmidt go and look at him like he's about to die. Schmidt kisses him full on the lips. ""Did you just Fredo kiss me?"" Nick asks. Winston assures him he'll ""beat this"".

CeCe also heard, and would like a vodka soda.

In a booth, Schmidt thinks it's because he refuses to wear a Blue tooth. Nick brings them drinks, feeling good on his pills. ""I feel really good in my uterus,"" Nick says.

Jess looks at Nick and gets choked up, which makes Schmidt cry, which leads to Winston crying. Nick insists he's fine, so Jess hands him his death diagnosis from her phone.

Later, a very hammered Nick admits the pills might have gotten a little on top of him. Schmidt tries to seek comfort in CeCe's chest. ""Are you using your best friend's medical crisis to feel my boobs with your face?"" she asks.

Jess tells a bad joke, so Nick prohibits her from speaking at his funeral. She's hurt. Winston assures her she wants no part of that.

Flash back to him in Chris Rock mode, at a funeral. ""What kind of dummy fixes a washing machine using a knife? (Pointing to the casket) This kind of dummy!""

Nick tells her she's not allowed because it's his time to shine. He doesn't want Daffy Duck voices and feeling sticks. He says she doesn't know how to be real and he can't have her trying to cheer people up.

With the bar closed later, Winston sings a sad song at the piano. Nick asks Schmidt for some weird rapping and he complies with something about players not playing in the city. Ce Ce shows him how it's done.

Winston is crooning, Schmidt is rapping and Jess interrupts, saying Nick never does anything.

She reminds him he wanted her to be real and reiterates. He tells her he never does anything unless he knows how it's going to turn out. If they go to the ocean, he's the guy on the beach guarding the wallets.

They drive to the beach. Jess offers to hold his wallet. He doesn't have his wallet, he just has a sandwich bag with his license and money in it.

Nick resists, pointing out it's a little cold. Then he reconsiders and runs for it.

Drunk Schmidt asks what's happening and Winston tells him he's about to miss his chance to see his best friend's penis.

Nick runs for the ocean, stripping and shouting he's alive. He falls down taking off his pants and runs in butt naked. He immediately screams that it's freezing and this was a terrible idea. He runs out for his clothes and Jess asks if he's OK.

He's not. He started the day playing touch football, then went to a gynecologist and now he might have cancer. Schmidt offers that Nick could stand to lose five to seven pounds.

Schmidt sits next to CeCe, musing about the perfect imprint her butt is going to leave in the sand. He doesn't know how to cope. She does, she tells him her dad died when she was 12. The only way to get through it is to get through it.

Jess checks on Nick and he tells her he likes her a lot and is glad she's around.

Nick realizes he's not going to remember anything in the morning. They resolve to go home.

Cut to everyone waking up on the beach in the morning. Winston slept in his car. He drives off and his SUV drops a bumper.

Nick checks in at the doctor, where he explains he'll be paying with a mixture of paper money and coins.

As the gang waits in the lobby, Nick comes out and tells them all he's fine. He didn't hear anything after they said ""you don't have cancer"", it's a cyst or something.

Schmidt Fredo kisses him again. Nick goes to pay, but the receptionist tells him it's taken care of. The gang split it.

Winston urges Nick to get a wallet; Schmidt has tons of wallet chains he can borrow. In the car, Nick asks Jess what happened last night. She tells him nothing.

They get into Winston's car, but it gasps and wheezes and goes nowhere. They get out and walk away. Winston takes the license plate and leaves it."

They're right in front of a pick pocket and he's wearing his slippiest loafers. He doesn't mind her not telling people about them, but he warns her he needs a little more stability. She's ripping the middle block right out of his Jenga. She says they're being spontaneous, but he clarifies that word has never been applied to him.

He's had enough. He gets out, handing her his shoes. ""I can get a tetanus shot, but I can't cure damaged suede,"" he says.

Back at the loft, Jess presents Schmidt with the hutch she found on the street. ""Get rid of it, Jess. Pine has no place in this loft. It's the wood of poor people and outhouses,"" Schmidt tells her.

She ignores him. He threatens to reinstate his ban on high-waisted shorts. ""You would not, that was the worst four weeks of my life,"" she says.

Winston wanders through the bathroom with a beer at 10 a.m. He knows what it'll feel like when he stops, so he doesn't plan to.

They remember their poker game last night. Winston more than Nick. On Nick's chest it's written: ""You owe me $487.""

Jess comes in complaining about Schmidt's anti-hutch stance. She's angry about Schmidt's edicts. They point out he cooks and cleans.

Jess wonders why Nick has cannons drawn all over his back, or maybe long stem mushrooms. ""So that's not a mossy cave?"" she asks.

Schmidt comes home and sees Jess's hutch, afghan and dress maker's form in the loft. He doesn't appreciate her non-Polynesian vanilla is touching his Polynesian vanilla.

He's aghast his coffee grinder is in her hutch. He extols its virtues and she tells him she's used it to make home made crayons.

He wants the hutch gone and tries to tip it over. She fends him off and he backs away. With her back turned, he tips it over and crushes it.

Jess comes back in and tells him he has a real problem and needs to learn to calm down.

Jess and Schmidt stroll down the boardwalk. He hates it. She points out birds in the sky; he sees a cat eating a dead one. She points out sea and sand; he sees a hypodermic. She points out the wind in their hair; he takes his vengeance out on a kite.

Winston and Nick grab lunch on a park bench. Winston paid for lunch, which allows him to bring up that Nick owns him a ton of money. He wrote a script. He's willing to call it $200. Nick agrees. They shake.

Then Nick tries to negotiate the gas money he put in, and the pay per view fight he got, and the beer. He argues it down to $140.

Jess and Schmidt take in the sights. He freaks out at a mime and kid eating ice cream. Jess notices he's crazy. ""You're like aging ballerina, child chess prodigy, professional magician crazy,"" she says.

He blames his mom who, even though they were Jewish, told him Santa didn't come to their house because his room was dirty. He ate because food was the only thing he could control.

Jess urges him to be spontaneous. A drum circle beckons.

Winston interrupts Nick in the middle of a beer. He presents him with receipts, including a box turtle, a domain name. Nick wonders how many 400 cognac and colas equals, and how much Winston should owe for seeing his mother naked in eight grade.

Jess and Schmidt return. He's geeked because he made it into the ocean without his aqua socks.

Flash back to the drum circle, and Schmidt cutting loose with his shirt off. He tells them how he washed his hands in a public restroom and there was a man in there using the toilet, full sit, and he didn't break eye contact once.

""That's not letting go -- that's cruising,"" Winston clarifies.

Nick does a spit take and Schmidt does his exercise to avoid compulsively cleaning it up. He runs to shower.

Winston and Nick warn Jess she messed with the ecosystem.

In the morning, they're all going crazy because Schmidt is drumming and the loft is a mess.

At the store, Nick and Winston try to get the groceries down to $100, putting back the baked ham and shrimp. They run the beer and Winston's Epsom salts.

Winston tells Nick he doesn't owe him anything because his mom will always be winner of ""best boobs, Master's division"". They get in a slap fight.

Later that night, Jess finds Schmidt sitting in a park wearing a baja and a drum. He's eating a hot dog from a shopping cart and hasn't been to work in three days. Jess tells him she made a mistake and asks him to come home.

They've all lost their keys to the mailbox. Schmidt urges her to say it in drums.

At the loft, Winston and Nick ice their wounds with the last frozen thing in the freezer. Jess comes home alone.

""Being friends with Schmidt is really complicated, because you want to change him so badly -- but you can't. Because he'll just get worse,"" Nick says.

Jess realizes she upset the ecosystem. She just wanted a hutch.

Later, they all snap to when Schmidt comes home. They sit him down.

Nick tells him he needs Schmidt to tell him what pants not to wear, and he needs him to laugh at him when he calls a Panini a hot sandwich.

Winston even misses his hair ""chut-en-ney"". Schmidt makes them a family.

Nick tells him if he comes back, he'll let him clean his room. ""The white whale?"" Schmidt asks.

Jess got him a pair of grey, shiny, flat-front trousers designed by a man named Calvin, pockets are sewn shut. She leaves them on his bongo drum.

He picks them up. ""Calvin. You magnificent wizard,"" he says.

The next morning they wake up to the sounds of cleaning. Schmidt tells Nick his hair is doing the thing he hates.

He's back.

At night, CeCe climbs into bed with Schmidt. He points out she's clearly in control in the relationship, and he's fine with it -- but if she's the one breaking in at 3 a.m., who's really in control? And then he ruins the power play with pet names for his pee pee."

Walking home, Jess suggests Nick go all ""ghost protocol"" on people and just be the guy without a phone.

Back home, Shelby is basking in Schmidt's bar trivia prowess, much to Winston's annoyance.

At school, Jess gets a visit from Russell (Dermot Mulroney), one of her student's dads. Jess explains they just finished sex-ed and she had to take 30 condoms off cucumbers, which turn out to be a lot harder to take off than they are to put on. Russell just came back from London, which forces Jess to avoid using her bad British accent. She's wearing a sign that says ""Mr. Monogamy.""

He wanted to talk about his daughter Sarah's art, which involves doll's heads. Jess explains that they get to create whatever they want during ""dream cess"". Russell informs Jess that from now on Sarah will opt out of dream cess and work with a tutor. Jess suggests he try spending time with his daughter instead. He leaves.

Jess goes to talk to Principal Tanya about him and learns that he's one of their biggest donors. Jess says she'll raise the money herself. ""I'll get ragtag group of kids together: a lost soul, an orphan, a Jewish kid with a keyboard, a little slut who can dance and one fatso and I'll choreograph some dances and make it a show.""

""You did that already, Jess, it's called the spring musical,"" Tanya tells her.

Tanya tells Jess to go apologize and assure him from now on her classroom will be like North Korea ""Math! Math! Math!""

Winston visits Schmidt in his room, asking him why he made him look stupid in front of Shelby. Schmidt asks if he wants him to take a dive next time Shelby's around, he says it's what he'd want Winston to do if he were the dumber one.

Winston argues that memorizing facts doesn't make you smart.

At breakfast, Nick complains that the problem is rich people, which is why he got rid of his phone. ""You were denied a cell phone because you have the credit score of a homeless ghost,"" Winston says.

Nick is writing a letter to his friend to see if he wants to party on Friday. Schmidt suggests she blame her period. Winston wonders if someone should suggest a simple apology.

Nick winds her up with an anti-rich people rant.

Winston hangs out with Elvin, for his part time nanny job.

Jess drives to see ""Fancyman"" but calls Schmidt and Nick back at the loft to practice her speech. She wants to start with a quote against social Darwinism.

Her car makes a noise and then sputters to stop in the middle of traffic. Russell comes to her aid, offering to call someone. She explains she was raised poor, so when something doesn't work, she pretends it does. ""Some of my best memories are pushing this car on family vacations,"" she says.

He calls her a tow and then offers her his car. She says she doesn't know how to drive cars that work, but he tells her to return it tomorrow, when he's having a party.

Schmidt and Nick listen to the whole thing on speakerphone. They wonder if he's a super hero. Schmidt wants to know what kind of car it is, while Nick chants ""we are the 99%"".

The next day, Jess complains to Cece about Fancyman. Cece suggests he might have a crush on her. Jess says he's not her type. ""He's the type of guy who has a linen closet and a towel warmer. You know me, I'm only attracted to guys who are afraid of success and think someone famous stole their idea,"" Jess says.

Cece reminds her Spender didn't own sheets (he slept on a pile of washcloths). Cece suggests that Jess is intimidated because she wouldn't have to take care of him.

Elvin quizzes Winston on banal trivia. Winston answers Mesopotamia and Elvin asks him to use it in a sentence. ""Look, there's Mesopotamia,"" Winston says.

Jess takes Nick to the party and asks him to get her in a hate mode. He strolls through the kitchen and critiques. ""A kitchen island? Be a man, let your counter attach to itself,"" Nick says.

As they stroll through the increasingly more impressive house, Nick is taken by Russell's study.

""When I put my hand on this desk I feel sexually proficient for the first time in my life,"" Nick says.

Jess reminds him Russell stands for everything he hates. Nick settles into the chair and nuzzles the wooden duck. ""I want to kill you, because I respect you,"" he tells it.

Jess goes out back to look for Russell. There's a genteel backyard garden party going on. Russell tells Jess her car is ready and she needs to change her oil.

She starts to make her speech and he asks if she thinks he's a snob, he says he's made a lot of money and he enjoys spending it.

Inside, Russell finds Nick wearing his cap and reading his books. And wearing his sweater. Nick introduces himself as the guy who has no phone.

Russell says when he was Nick's age he had a really skinny pony tail and was living off selling his own blood. Then he realized he wanted to grow up.

Russell gives him a cell phone he got as a Christmas present. Nick asks if it's possible to be sexually attracted to an object. Russell assures him it is. He tells Nick to keep the sweater.

Nick asks him why he's being so nice and Russell says because he's Jess's friend.

Jess wanders into the bathroom and meets the electronic bidet, but doesn't know what it is. It squirts her, so she leaps up and gets squirted in the face as she frantically tries to shut it off. Russell hears and knocks at the door.

As it squirts and speaks Japanese, Jess tells him she's not sorry for what she said and doesn't care if he pulls his funding. He tells her he'd never do that.

He assesses the damage to his bidet as she runs off. ""You put it up to six happy faces, I've never gone past three!""

Jess and Nick leave the party. Jess wants to run off. Nick tells her it may complicate things, but he loves Russell. ""He smells like strong coffee and going to see a man about a horse,"" he says.

Nick tells her to be a grown up, Russell likes her. ""Don't be intimidated just because you're younger, poorer and wetter than everybody in there!"" he says. Jess goes back in.

At trivia night, Winston throws out random answers to questions. Later, he confesses he didn't want Shelby to think he was stupid. She assures him she doesn't want a rich, smart guy who has his own car -- she wants him.

Winston checks if she's saying she's his girlfriend. She is. Schmidt critiques from the car, telling him he hopes Winston's bed moves are better than his street work. He offers to put on Jodeci.

Back at the party, Jess finds Russell and explains she's not used to people who have it all together. She tells him he scares her. He doesn't have it all together, he can't even talk to his own kid. She said she wanted to go bra shopping, so he bought her a ski vest.

She tells him every eye roll means he's doing something right, then admits it's just what she tells parents to make them feel better.

He asks her out to dinner. She says great, takes a step back and lands in the koi pond. Nick comes running, pulling off Russell's sweater and taking care to fold it.

Flash to outside a restaurant, Jess oversharing about how guys her age just want to ""go for the gold"", but she's stingy with her gold. Fancyman ends up hugging her and patting her on the back.

Winston gets a call from Shelby. Jess turns down an invitation to Poetry Man's class. Winston asks Schmidt to lend him his car, the ""manbulance"" to give Shelby a ride to the airport.

Cece joins them and sees Dirk, with his scarf on, doing yoga in the living room. He asks her out, but she says she's seeing somebody. Schmidt takes note as she says she's in charge in the relationship. Dirk says that makes the guy her ""sexcretary"".

Winston helps Shelby pack the car for a bachelorette party in Mexico. She says she doesn't have to go but Winston says that after five nights together they could both use some space. Wrong answer.

Back at the loft, with Jess in the shower, Cece tries to get Schmidt to have a quickie. He turns her down. He tells her he quits. She hears him, but guess who didn't? She unbuttons her blouse, bringing her boobs into it. He says hi to Harold and Kumar, but still says no.

In her room, Jess tells Cece about the Russell back pat. Cece checks and yes, Jess did use her Kermit the Frog voice during the date. She urges Jess to just call him.

Dirk leads his poetry class, with a scarf and harmonica. Nick and Winston sit in. Dirk closes to a standing ovation. After class, two undergrads invite Dirk to a wine and cheese event. Dirk's woman left him because it was getting too hard to (airquotes) ""support him financially"". He's all about the undergrads now.

""Girls our age, what do they want? They want us to wed them, sire their children, they want you to have a bed frame, they want you to eat off plates. But girls in college, all they want you to do is tell them their photography has potential,"" Dirk explains to Nick.

Winston announces he's going to call Shelby, while Dirk explains that ""give me some space"" actually means, ""let's have sex with other people.""

Cece makes a stab at seducing Schmidt, putting on a business suit. She says she's willing to do anything anywhere. ""Even fantasy location No. 3?"" Schmidt asks.

Jess tries to make conversation with Fancyman at dinner, asking him how he felt when the Beatles broke up. He was one year old. She talks about getting a mammogram and asks about his prostate. ""Our bodies are decaying,"" she says.

He asks if she's OK and she asks why they didn't kiss the other night. He gets a text and runs out after leaving her cash for dinner and a cab.

Winston leaves Shelly a voicemail, saying he doesn't want space. ""I want to be standing right in front of you. I want the air that you breathe to be coming directly out of my mouth. I want to just be passing air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and we both pass out and die,"" he says, hanging up. He looks for a flight but can't find any. He shouts to Schmidt that he's borrowing his car.

Cut to Winston peeling out in Schmidt's SUV, and naked Schmidt and Cece cowering in the back.

Nick and Dirk host an afterparty in the loft. Nick is getting nowhere until a girl is impressed that he makes drinks for a living. Jess comes home and wonders why the cast of ""The Social Network"" is in their apartment.

Nick explains that 20 year olds think he's awesome, he's their Fancyman. Jess grabs a drink and downs it.

Winston drives to Mexico, singing to ""Defying Gravity"" from ""Wicked"" as Cece and Schmidt hide. Schmidt has to pee, but she'd rather he wet himself than admit to Winston that they're sleeping together. There'd be a lot of questions like, ""Cece, why are you sleeping with him?"" She doesn't want to ruin what they have.

Winston crosses the border to Mexico, on to ""Popular"".

In the loft, Jess kills at flip cup. Shelby calls. She flew back to see him and is in the loft. He tells her he loves her and doesn't want any space. He turns around.

At the border, the border agent asks if he's carrying any non-US citizens. He shows Winston Cece and Schmidt in the back.

At the loft, Jess rides some dude's shoulder and then sees Russell in the crowd. She dives off and hides. He finds her, but she wants a donut. He takes her for a donut, but ends up with a car full of drunk college students.

Nick falls out at the curb and brags about jumping out of his first moving car. He manages to tell Russell that Jess is one of the good ones.

On the drive back, Schmidt threatens to use the fact that Winston sings to ""Wicked"" alone as leverage for him keeping their secret. But Winston thinks the rules for the universe are out the window if Schmidt can get someone like Cece.

Drunk Jess tells Russell that she gets that he likes dating younger girls because they think he's cool. He explains he hasn't dated since ""1989, the year I took her to the picture show in my buggy."" ""1989 was, my friend, the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself,"" Jess says.

The text he got at dinner was from his ex-wife. His daughter Sarah is with her and was having an asthma attack and he forgot to pack her inhaler.

He says he wanted to kiss her the other night and do more than that, ""I'd like to do you at some point, really give it to you good, but I've forgotten how to tell when it's the right moment"".

They agree it's the right moment and kiss. Outside the car, Nick, commands the poison out of his body, puking on the lawn.

Nick calls Dirk, who's still in the back of Russell's car. Nick is 100 yards from the car, but thinks he's out in the mountains. ""When does a hill become a mountain?"" he cries."

Jess has her playlist all set -- Diane Keaton's audiobook. Cece isn't dressed and makes excuses.

Jess comes in and Cece's two model roommates are on the couch, one consoling the other because she accidentally ate a cookie. Jess leaves.

Schmidt pops up out the couch, causing Nadia to clap. ""Jew in the couch! Jew in the couch!"" Cece reminds her to use ""American manners"". ""Sorry, Jew person in couch,"" she corrects.

Nick escorts a hook up out, busting out a coughing fit when the girl checks that he'll call her. Nick says sleeping with 21 year olds constantly is really stressing him out.

Winston is distracted on the couch, saying he learned something recently. Nick doesn't want to hear, he can't keep secrets, they make his back sweat. Nick tries to get away from him but Winston grabs him and shouts ""Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!""

Nick makes grossed out faces. ""No! This makes me hate things!"" he says.

Everybody but Jess knows. Jess comes home. Nick covers by saying they're hanging out in the hall and nothing is going on.

Jess is annoyed because Cece bailed on her. Nick suggests Cece might have had a guy over and Winston whacks him. Jess figures out that Nick has a secret and confronts him. She sees the telltale sweat stain on Nick's back.

She gets in his face demanding that he fold. Nick blurts it out and Schmidt walks in the door. He apologizes that she had to find out this way.

""But can we just take a minute to celebrate me? Schmidty really did it this time, I'm having Indian every night,"" he says. Jess takes off after him.

Cece and Schmidt sit down with everyone to take their grilling. Jess can't believe they've been doing it for two months. ""Two moons have passed"" since they started, she says. Winston wonders why she talks like a Native American when she's angry.

Schmidt notes they've done it in every room of the house. Jess is mad at Winston for keeping it for three days. Nick gets no credit because he's weak. Jess walks away angry. Nick thinks what he did was really brave.

Nick walks another college hook up out. She's looking for her circular scarf. Nick's phone rings and he tries to hide the call. The girl freaks out and Nick covers by throwing his phone against the wall.

Nick admits he needs woman advice from Schmidt. Schmidt flashes back to his ""lesser paramours"", making out on the couch with a large woman.

""Schmidt, I need you to teach me to be a douchebag,"" Nick says.

Cece meets up with Jess outside before her run. She wants to join her, but Jess runs away. Cece pleads that them fighting stresses her out, she's started eating bread.

Schmidt leads the douchebag class for Winston and Nick. He addresses Nick. ""In the restaurant of life, you have selected the tasting menu,"" he says.

Nick changes his mind about the class, but Schmidt continues on. Because Nick can't lie, he has to focus on SSV: ""Short, simple, vague.""

He tries to role play. He asks Nick where his phone is. ""Jesus took it. A Jesus hawk on a speed boat. The environment. Bears. Family. Magic,"" Nick blurts.

Then in Nick's bedroom, Schmidt tells him to pretend he's a girl and he's trying to get her out of his apartment as fast as possible. Nick feels bad, saying they just had sex and he has feelings for her. Schmidt counsels him never to accept a brunch invitation.

Jess barges in. ""I don't want to live in a house of lies! I can't do it anymore,"" she says. Then, seeing Schmidt and Nick on the bed, she asks: ""Is this happening, too?""

Jess has secrets she wants to confess. They involve Nick using Schmidt's chenille throw as a napkin and Schmidt saying Winston was in danger of becoming a nanny for life, ""going full Poppins.""

Winston retaliates. ""Schmidt says he thinks about you sometimes when he's making love to himself,"" he says.

Schmidt defends that it was just once and Nick has done it multiple times. Nick drags in Winston's sex dream about Jess in which she had raccoon hands.

""You've all thought about me while self completing!"" she says. ""We're going back to keeping secrets! When I walk out of this room this conversation never happened!"" Jess says, running out screaming.

The next morning, Cece comes out of Schmidt's room and finds Jess standing in the kitchen in a ski mask and parka. She plans to wear her winter clothes until she can deal with the idea that her roommates fantasized about her.

She complains that she's never not told Cece something. Flash back to them years ago. ""That's what second base means? Then I'm not a virgin anymore,"" Jess says. Another time, Jess saying: ""Is it weird that he wants me to talk in a deep voice and call myself Kevin?"" And another, where Jess confesses she had a dream about killing Cece.

Back in the kitchen, Cece points out that Jess tells her everything, but she stopped that a long time ago because Jess got judgmental and critical.

Flash to Cece telling Jess: ""I had to give it a try, that was the same hand that was inside Elmo.""

""You don't have secrets Jess, because you don't do anything stupid -- with guys,"" Cece says. Jess starts judging her for Schmidt.

Nick walks out. He has a lady friend over. He sees Jess in her parka and says it's kind of a fantasy of his. He asks her to say the following words: ""The ice roads are too dangerous, you're gonna have to turn back, chief!""

There's a knock at the door and hook up No. 1 comes in looking for her scarf. She hears the voice of hook up No. 2 from Nick's bedroom. Soon, he's getting slapped by both.

Jess continues ranting about Cece keeping secrets. Cece starts confessing. She spent New Year's in St. Barth's with someone who might have been an arms dealer. Her feet aren't wider than Jess', she just said that to make her feel better. When they were 10, she went to the movie ""My Girl"" with someone else before her. And she owns a motorcycle.

Jess freaks out at Cece, prompting Winston to come out from his bedroom and rant for peace and quiet. He goes into a negro spiritual-tinged soliloquy about being Nick's lover on the downlow.

It sends the hook ups away, they decide to get manicures together.

He tells Cece to get rid of the motorcycle, but compliments Schmidt for being in the prime of his life. He also calls Jess out to admit she fantasizes about the guys, too. He doesn't work 9 to 5, he hears things.

The next day, Cece and Jess run the 10K for MS. Cece blows by the guys, saying she has to beat Jess. Jess huffs and puffs by later. Schmidt is wearing a t-shirt that says ""See Cece Run"". He made it and Cece thinks it's funny.

Jess runs after her.

Two girls run up together and Nick realizes he slept with both of them. They start to yell, but he calmly tells one he didn't call her because of a family emergency and he didn't tell the other about the first because their moment together was too beautiful. The girls run off, appeased.

Schmidt offers a high five and Nick is disgusted he has to give it. The Schmidt approach works.

Jess finally catches up to Cece, saying she knows why she didn't tell her, she likes Schmidt. Jess guesses that Cece wasn't ready to admit it to herself. Cece asks her not to tell anyone.

Back at the loft, Jess thinks Cece and Schmidt cooking together are cute. She leaves and Schmidt wonders how they're going to tell her that they're just having sex, nothing else. He doesn't mean it.

Winston quizzes Cece for possible explanation for why she's sleeping with Schmidt. Including: Is is a pity thing? Is he sick? Are you working for the government? If he's holding you against your will, blink twice. You tired of being turned on? You have a mole fetish?

And finally: Is it huge?"

Jess hasn't been home in a week -- she's wearing Fancyman's boxers. Jess wants to go home, she's worried about the guys.

Cut to them drinking beer and throwing tennis balls at each other, not missing her at all.

Winston listens to a sports talk radio guy. He's interviewing for his research assistant position today.

Jess comes home. Nick didn't realize she was gone. ""Is that why it's been so quiet?"" he asks. She comments on Winston's mustache. ""It's creepy and thin, just like I like it,"" he says.

She's upset they played ""True American"" without her. Cece calls for all the details. Then she walks out of Schmidt's bedroom in a sheet. Jess isn't used to the fact she's sleeping with Schmidt yet.

""I'm surprised this one's still standing, we burned through a lot of ideas last night,"" Schmidt says.

Later, Jess tells Cece it's like living in a romantic comedy montage. They throw their heads back when they laugh and she tries on floppy hats for him. She says it's perfect. Cece suggests it's not perfect because they're living on his terms.

Jess tells the guys that Russell is going to stay over that weekend. She checks that they'll be cool, then clarifies that they understand what it means.

Nick wants permission to walk Russell ""the visionary"" through his idea notebook.

Winston hangs out with Elvin on the swings. He checks that Elvin understands he has to get a real job someday. Elvin suggests they work on his resume, typing is not a real skill.

Winston interviews at the station for Joe Napoli. He knows Winston from his playing days and mocks him mercilessly. Winston is debating whether he wants the job when he meets a coworker: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Winston asks to sit on his shoulders.

Kareem passes him a note. When Joe leaves, he reads it: ""Get out now! Run! You will die here! Best, Abdul Jabbar #33""

Nick greets Jess when she brings Russell home. He has a plate of cheeses just for Russell.

Jess makes ""ethnic noodles"" for Russell. Nick stares at him dreamily. Schmidt is angry he ignored his sushi restaurant suggestions. Nick steals some of his noodles and pronounces them ""bowl brothers"".

Winston comes home angry.

Flash to Joe giving him orders. He wants six shakes in his fridge at all times and he wants it Beyonce colored. He dumps one on his desk. Kareem pops up from the other side of the cubicle and warns Winston not to let Joe see him hurt.

Back at the apartment, Russell dumps something in the sink and it acts up. Nick attacks it with a baseball bat-sized plunger and gets tossed around, telling the other guys to ""anchor"" him. They line up and fight the disposal. Jess taps it and the crisis passes.

Jess suggests a game of True American -- 50 % drinking game, 50% life-sized Candyland.

They set up zones in the apartment and a trail of chairs. The booze and beer are the ""soldiers of the secret order"".

""Everything you hear in True American is a lie, knock on wood,"" Winston says.

It starts with a shotgun tip-off. Russell grabs a beer can and shotguns it like a pro. They take turns shouting out American president's names and jumping on chairs and holding numbers on their foreheads. Russell starts to figure it out, walking from chair to chair because the ground is lava.

At one point, Russell, Winston and Schmidt end up all hugging together on a chair, each drinking a beer. Cece comes home and announces she's getting in Schmidt's bed. The game ends when Schmidt quits to join her.

Russell is psyched his team won. Winston carries him around the apartment chanting USA.

Later around the table, Russell announces he's trashed. Jess is ready to call it a night, but Russell isn't finished yet. Schmidt comes out shirtless with his hands bound -- water break. Winston asks for advice for dealing with his boss who, like Russell, is a rich white man. Russell suggests a power play -- drip his ""boys"" in his boss' shake. Jess is appalled, the guys love the idea.

Russell shushes her and says it's guy thing.

Jess tries again to get him to come to bed, reminding him they have a big day planned. But Nick suggests the idea journal. Jess goes to bed alone.

Jess goes in to Schmidt's room in the morning to talk to Cece. She's mad at Russell. She doesn't want to fight with him because he always fought with his ex-wife and being peaceful is their thing.

Nick presents his ""real apps"" prototype to Schmidt, following Russell's advice. It's a fork and spoon and corn holder, Swiss Army Knife-style, to strap to your phone. ""It's also a gentleman's shiv,"" Nick says.

Back at the radio station, Joe introduces Winston on-air, then does the interview for him, again mocking his basketball abilities. Winston eyes his fridge full of shakes.

At the loft, Jess makes hangover eggs for Russell. ""They'll either stop you from throwing up the rest of the day, or you'll just throw it all up really fast. They're high-risk, high-reward,"" Jess says.

Russell wants to go back to bed, but Jess tells him about the day she has planned, including apple picking. He says no way. She gets angry and they're about to fight when Nick and Schmidt interrupt with their sales pitch.

Russell hears the name ""real apps"" as ""relapse"" and Schmidt and Nick start arguing. Nick foists the prototype on him and skewers Russell's hand. He's bleeding, but they have no band-aids. Jess tapes a napkin to his hand and Russell announces he needs to go home and asks if that's a problem.

Jess grits her teeth and says everything is fine.

Winston conferences with Elvin, telling him he's decided to quit the radio station. ""I can't let you do that,"" Elvin says. He calls for his mom and yells that Winston just asked if he could smoke weed. His mom freaks out and tells Winston he'll never nanny again. Elvin gives him a smile on his way out and Winston sees he did him a favor.

Back at the station, Winston tries to throw away all the shakes, but Joe has one. He asks what Winston did to them. Winston confesses they've been compromised, then says he wants the job. He tells Joe he stuck his ""beans"" in them and swirled them around. Joe busts out laughing. ""We're going to do that to Kareem,"" he says.

Jess waits for Russell to come home. She wants to fight with him. She tells him her world is as important as his. ""And if you want to get with me, you're going to have to get with my friends -- and that is a Spice Girls song,"" she says. They both end up laughing. She says they just fought, but he says he won. They head inside."

Jess warns them that Russell's daughter Sara is on her way over. She lays down some ground rules about swearing and ""no bringing home college girls, Berlusconi.""

Nick defends himself but has no moral authority because he's not wearing pants.

Russell's ex-wife Ooly (Jeanne Tripplehorn) drops Sara off and keeps referring to Russell as her husband. Jess clarifies and she says Russell ""will always be my husband, you know what I mean."" Jess doesn't.

Cece rests in Jess's room and Schmidt worries she's getting tired of him and might want something more than sex.

Jess introduces Sara to everyone. She seems taken with Nick, although she tells him his eyes look like poop. Which causes Jess to call him ""Ol' poo eyes"".

Winston picks up his boss outside a rundown house, where he's hiding behind the Dumpster. Joe runs out and jumps in Winston's car as men run out chasing after him.

Jess totally loses Sara and finds her going through her laundry. She wonders why Jess has so many bras. Jess tells her she can ask anything she wants. Sara takes her up on it. ""Are you in love with my dad? Do you and my dad ever 'dry lump'? Is sexting cool? Have you ever done a 99? Have you ever given a person 'plow chops'? How do you make love to a person 'animal style'?""

""Do you want to learn how to play bridge?"" Jess offers.

Schmidt suggests he take Cece out on a real date to Italy on Ice. She says she can't go right now and suggests he take someone else.

Jess talks to Sara, telling her to find a ""partner"" to share these things with. Sara suggests Nick. She gets all teenage girl twitterpated and says she wants to rub her face on his face.

Schmidt and Cece bring their drama into the room with Schmidt threatening to call another woman and ask her out and Cece insisting she doesn't care.

Nick goes to an art gallery with Chloe and tries to talk art. His phone rings. It's Schmidt. He talks to Nick like he's a chick and Nick takes him at face value. He tells him what he's wearing. ""You taking care of that tushy for me?"" Schmidt asks. ""I'm trying to eat less donuts?"" Nick says.

Cece glares at Schmidt and storms off.

Jess suggests they're an example of people who should not be making love. Sara suggests she loves Nick so much she's going to die. She locks herself in Nick's room.

Winston tries to get Joe to the studio, but he insists on hopping out at a yard sale.

Jess tries to talk Sara down but Cece comes over freaking out about Schmidt asking her out. She pounds on the door, calling Sara a brat and telling her she needs Jess's full attention. Cece freaks out that she's going to be a terrible mother.

Cece tries to calm down but ends up telling Sara she's too young to have sex but when she does to always use protection because even if he says it's tantric and you're Indian and know better, you're just going to end up pregnant.

Schmidt hears her and immediately comes over and puts his head on her belly. ""We made a caramel miracle,"" he says.

Schmidt tells Nick the news and he freaks out about the fact that Schmidt's not freaking out. Schmidt wonders if it's fate and he's never going to find a girl better than Cece.

Back at the loft, Sara thinks Jess's life is cool, like ""Gossip Girl"" but everyone is old and poor. Sara asks Jess if she thinks Nick is hot and she says sure, ""in a rumpled small town PI kinda way."" Sara gets back to the topic of Nick, wondering if they'll ever do it animal style.

Schmidt presents Cece with a mocktail and finds she's crying. He tells her she's amazing and will do amazing things and he'll support whatever she does. Then he tells her he needs to do some research so he doesn't impregnate the baby. ""We could have a Russian nesting doll situation on our hands,"" he says.

They eat a very quiet dinner, with Nick's friend Chloe. ""Are you and Nick making love?"" Sara blurts out.

Chloe offers to clear the table and Nick gives Jess an ""in your face"" over the fact Chloe has basic table manners.

Sara tells Jess she hates Chloe, but Jess says she doesn't know her well enough to hate her. Sara says she does know her -- from the school bus. Chloe recognizes her as an annoying kindergartener. Chloe is 18. Jess realizes she subbed for her eighth grade English class.

Winston gets Joe to the Strahan studio but Joe gets out of the car and runs from the studio. Joe confesses Michael Strahan makes him feel like an idiot. Winston tells Joe that he's not better than him at yard sales. ""If you were a woman, or even dressed as a woman, we'd be unstoppable,"" Joe tells him.

Nick reels from the fact Chloe is 18. Jess freaks out. Sara is in her room upset over Nick and Ooly is there to pick her up. ""I might as well call you 'Bridge to Tarabithia' because you make children cry,"" she tells him. Jess orders Schmidt and Winston to help her with the situation.

Schmidt goes and intercepts Ooly, pretending to know her.

Jess and Nick try to get Sara out of his room. Nick says he can be a bit of an anchor, then he tells her he hasn't felt the way she's feeling about him in a long time and that's the best part.

At the curb, Schmidt makes up places he saw Ooly, including the Olympics, someone's funeral and at her salon.

Upstairs, Sara says she's too embarrassed but Jess assures her they're the most embarrassing people on the planet. Jess volunteers that she talks louder to blind people. Nick offers that he's 30 and has peed in every pool he's been in. ""I still think it's funny when a guy puts tennis balls under his shirt and pretends it's boobs,"" Nick says.

Sara says she's stuck. She opens the door and they find her wearing all of Jess's bras. Jess gets to work on the front and Nick works on the back. And that's when Ooly comes in. She's taking in the scene when Cece runs in praising god about getting her period.

""Welcome to our home, would you like a drink?"" Jess asks.

Sara says bye to Nick, telling him she's over him. She hands Jess her bras back. ""Bye, Ooly, you rulie,"" Jess says. ""Bye Jess, you're a mess,"" Ooly says.

Downstairs, Cece tells Schmidt that now things can go back to how things were. He goes along with it then sees something and rushes her into her car.

She drives off and he looks at the sky writing: ""Marry me."""

Schmidt visits Cece. Her Russian roommate Nadja announces, ""Cece, the Jewish is here to make sex!"" Schmidt points out they've barely spoken since he nearly impregnated Cece. She wonders if the whole thing is too intense and maybe they should stop.

Schmidt says OK, if that's what she wants. Then Nadja pipes up that she'll go out with him instead. Cece starts to say no, but Schmidt says yes, if that's what Cece wants.

At the loft, Jess describes running into Russell's ex Ooly at Russell's gym. Jess was wearing a polka dot bikini and ran into naked Ooly in the steam room. Ooly gave a full-frontal hug.

""It was really foggy, and I kept making eye contact with her nipples and then I panicked and invited her to dinner with Russell and me tonight,"" Jess explains.

Ooly is like a looming presence between them and she just wants to deal with it, even if Ooly isn't Russell's favorite person. Jess says she's really good at dealing with divorced people.

Flash back to Jess' parents fighting when she was young and Jess trying to diffuse with Cheap Trick's ""Surrender:"" Mommy's alright, daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird....

Out at the restaurant, Ooly asks about the quesadillas, but pronounces them with a castillian ""th"", earning an eye roll from Russell. And so it begins.

Russell and Ooly start arguing about a vacation they took and how Russell did or didn't get lost. Jess tries to focus on the food but soon they're standing up yelling at each other.

Jess breaks into Cheap Trick. Russell and Ooly stop arguing but then stare at each other lustily.

Later, Jess tells Cece about the heat between them. Schmidt comes out of his room and Cece tells him Nadja is looking forward to her date with him.

Up on the roof, Nick waters his tomatoes by spitting water on them. Winston talks about Shelby's cat. Birds circle and Nick screams at them. Winston brings it back to Shelby.

On his date with Nadja -- dinner in the apartment -- she lists what she likes about America, including: salad bar, ""Despicable Me,"" David Fincher, Connect 4, sidewalk, Leon J. Pannetta. She segues to offering they do a sex party on his face.

At the gym, Ooly tells Jess she can't be in the same room with Russell without them wanting to rip each other's faces off. She compares it to standing on the bow of a catamaran, except you're naked and getting splashed with spray and you're on fire. She gets pumped up and turned on. Jess tries to relate.

""I'm just like, Russell, put away the passion and show me a moderately good time,"" Jess says.

On the roof, Nick builds a scarecrow. Winston asks him to keep it down because he and Shelby are trying to ""make love.""

Nick is annoyed and Winston asks if he's allowed to be happy. ""You're allowed to be happy, but it's really annoying the way you're doing it,"" Nick says.

Nick yells that he doesn't care about Shelby and that he used to be Winston's Shelby. Nick drives him off with a pitchfork, telling him to get off his farm.

Jess and Russell sit on the couch reading and she asks if she does stuff that annoys him. He mentions her eyes bugging out and how she squats when she thinks. She does both and gets in his face, trying to annoy him. She yells at him to show her the passion. Then flings coasters at him under he finally asks what's going on.

Something's missing and she didn't realize it until she saw he and Ooly nearly strangle each other. ""You want me to treat you like my ex-wife, who I hate?"" Russell asks. She wants the spark. He says passion is over-rated. She asks him to take her home.

Nick brings his scarecrow downstairs and bashes it. ""What is this, Martin Scorcese's 'The Wizard of Oz?'"" Winston asks.

Nick apologizes, but then says they used to be miserable together. Once they pooled their money and bought an online dating profile. The ladies did not dig ""Ninston.""

Winston urges him to not give up and tells him how calling Shelby out of the blue paid off.

Cece comes home and asks Nadja about her Schmidt date. She says ""small man go to hospital."" Cece rushes off.

Russell takes Jess home. He tells her he's done the explosive passion thing and being with Ooly was like getting closer and closer to a wood chipper.

She tells him she wants passion even if it's harder. So that's it. They say good-bye (but not before Jess mistakes the seat adjuster for the door handle and leaves in a final moment of embarrassment).

Cece rushes to visit Schmidt and starts to apologize to him. Then she sees the ice pack on his junk. He says things got a little out of control with Nadja and he broke his penis.

""There was a moment where it was like watching myself, watch myself. I think I finally understand what 'The Tree of Life' is about and I cannot be sure, but I am almost certain Nadj'a vagina contains a right angle,"" he says.

Cece is upset and finally tells him she doesn't want him to be with anyone else because she likes him. He clarifies that she likes his personality. ""I was surprised, too,"" she says.

She kisses him. But his injury kicks in. ""Oh my god, my penis is having a heart attack! Don't touch me!""

He yells at her to leave, admonishing her for bending over in yoga pants. He calls for a nurse, preferably a male heavyset one. ""Describe it to them as a battered highway cone,"" he says.

Jess comes home and sees Caroline walk out of Nick's room in her shirt only. Caroline goes to the bathroom and Jess yells at Nick, reminding him they had a terrible relationship and he only thinks it's right because he doesn't have the courage or the patience to be alone.

She storms off, yelling at him for making terrible life decisions. She says she's disappointed in him and tells him to put on his flannel and keep not living up to his potential.

Soon they're yelling at each other and she's saying she doesn't want to look at his face. So he offers his rear and then they're yelling and waggling their behinds at each other. ""I'm winning this moment!"" he shouts.

Up on the roof, Winston tries to glue a tomato on the plant to fool Nick. Schmidt wonders if it will work. ""When it comes to tomatoes, no one in the world knows less than Nick,"" Winston points out.

Schmidt ices his junk. He can't have any excitement for eight weeks or he's in excruciating pain. Winston tests him. ""Boobies. Girls with clean hair,"" he says.

Schmidt squirms as he's turned on and proclaims it the least fun game they've ever played. ""Models eating sliders, Bernadette Peters on a high beam, freshly baked bread...."""

Later, Winston gives it a turn and finds Jess on the floor listening to ""River"" over and over. He's now hoping it thaws and Joni falls through.

Jess worries to Cece if she made the right choice. Cece thinks it's time to turn off Joni. Nick and Caroline come in with a dance routine to the song. It involves a lot of hip thrusting. Jess is finally ready for a drink.

She goes out with Schmidt and Winston. Schmidt wants her phone, to prevent her from backsliding. Winston is jazzed that his boss invited him to play poker.

They're not happy Nick's with Caroline. They wonder if it's time to show him the video he made last time he broke up with her of all the reasons he shouldn't be with her.

Cece arrives dressed frumpy, like a ""women's studies major,"" Jess says. Schmidt says it's a precautionary measure until his junk heals. It doesn't work, he limps off in pain.

Jess teaches Nick about backsliding.

Cece isn't sure what she's supposed to do with Schmidt since everything turns him on. Cut to him getting turned on bird watching, because of the eggs.

Nick thinks Caroline changed. And she's way hotter than the voice in his head who sounds like Tom Waits and tells him he looks bad in hats.

Cece has to go visit her grandmother in the home tomorrow. Old people freak Schmidt out, with their hands and their legs...""they're like a human version of pleated pants.""

Jess steals her phone back from Nick and dials. She wakes up in bed with Paul.

In the loft in the morning, Winston confesses he got wasted last night with Joe and got his ear pierced.

They say an awkward hello to Paul and he hugs Jess good-bye. When he's gone, the backsliding accusations begin.

She wants to give it another shot even though he's an ugly crier. ""It's like a slow motion sneeze,"" she says.

Schmidt goes to the home with Cece, less turned on than he's ever been.

Caroline looks at apartments with Nick and suggests they move in together. She also mentions she's 33, not 30 like he thought. She doesn't want to start at the beginning again.

Jess visits Paul and doesn't get very far before he confesses he has a very serious girlfriend. He starts crying and says he now knows how Bill Clinton feels.

His girlfriend comes by for lunch and sees him crying and Jess covers by pretending she just explained the electoral college.

At the loft, Winston is now rocking a hoop earring.

Jess comes home and confesses to Schmidt and Winston, saying Paul's girlfriend looks like an Asian her. She thinks she has to tell his girlfriend the truth.

Back at the home, Schmidt asks the olds how to sustain a relationship. Cece comes back in the room and hears her grandma telling Schmidt he's exactly what Cece needs.

She sits down and says she feels like she's ready for something real with him. He feels the same way. Then he starts writhing in pain. She realizes emotional intimacy is turning him on. He passes out.

Back at the loft, Winston is now wearing a feather earring. Nick tells him about looking for an apartment with Caroline. Schmidt runs into the room and they reveal the DVD.

It shows Nick in a full Grizzly Adams beard, talking to himself and reminding himself that Caroline dumped him three times -- once before he had to speak at his brother's wedding. He wrote a poem and gives it to Schmidt.

Schmidt produces it. ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/No, a summer's day is not a bitch.""

DVD Nick goes back to crying into his mason jar of tears. He asks future Nick if he always wants to be a bartender and dress like an ""unsponsored professional skateboarder."" DVD Nick tells him he's doing the right thing.

Nick insists Caroline has changed then leaves.

At school, Jess tells Paul he has to tell his girlfriend what happened or she will. Paul says the girlfriend is his soul mate.

""For someone with a soul mate, you sure did have sex with me,"" Jess says.

Paul shows Jess the engagement ring he bought. And Jess starts to feel sorry for him. His girlfriend, Asian Jess comes in. Her name is Jen. Paul blurts out that he slept with Jess.

Jen starts ugly crying, just like Paul.

Jess tells Jen that Paul was just scared and made a mistake. She says Paul has something to ask her. Paul proposes. Jess helps him get down on one knee and presents the ring, even asking Jen if she'll marry Paul.

At the loft, Jess tells Winston and Schmidt about Paul's proposal. They send her to the bathroom to talk to Nick. She tells him he doesn't have to settle and he deserves love. She even tries her best Tom Waits voice.

He tells her he signed a lease with Caroline this morning."

""You're making a huge, life-ruining mistake by moving in with a woman who turned you into an agoraphobic, turtle-faced, borderline alcoholic,"" Jess says.

Winston wonder what he'll do with all his extra money with Nick not using him for everything. Schmidt plans to call a plumber and just throw money at him.

Later, Schmidt asks Winston to drive him to the doctor. He's getting his bandages off. ""It's time to make this horse into a unicorn,"" he says.

They interview potential new roommates. Neil responded to their Craiglist ad with a fax. He was in HR, but had to let himself go. Jess tells him she hopes he likes feminist rants because that's kind of her thing.

Winston and Schmidt take her into the bathroom and tell her to be normal. She can't believe they aren't fighting for Nick.

They tell Neil he's in. He hopes they're OK with songs, because he's kind of a troubadour.

Later, Nick retrieves his lamp from Winston's room. Winston freaks out a little and Nick asks if he's still afraid of the dark. ""If I were afraid of the dark that would be a totally natural, adaptive, evolutionary response,"" he says.

Nick turns out the lights as he leaves and Winston shrieks.

Schmidt visits Cece on a set. He ended up with a cast. On the plus side, he can't get aroused anymore. She tests it, whispering ""fresh, pressed linens"" in his ear. It's like a swaddled baby.

A hot male model tells Cece they're ready. She tells Schmidt to hang out. The photo shoot is Cece straddling a missile with the dude behind her. Schmidt interrupts, asking if they learned nothing from Eisenhauer.

Later, Nick says goodbye, telling the group he took his fair share of rubber bands, so he doesn't want to hear about it. Jess asks Nick why he's rushing things. He says he's confident. ""Are you?"" she asks. ""Yes,"" he says. ""Are you?"" she asks. ""Yes,"" he says.

Nick, Schmidt and Winston get into the U-Haul and head to his new apartment -- which he blows right past, freaking out.

Cut to Nick in the desert, running in circles. ""What have I done?"" he screams into the canyon. Winston asks for the keys to drive him back to Caroline's. Nick screams, grabs the keys and hurls them off a cliff.

At the apartment, Neil is moving in. Cece drops by and tells Jess about Schmidt being jealous at the shoot. Schmidt calls.

Back in the desert, Winston gets worried about how much daylight is left. He plays it off saying he's worried about Schmidt. ""He's a Jew in the desert, I don't want him to wander,"" he says.

Caroline calls for Nick. He says he freaked out. She says she knows it's a lot, but tells him to just come back and they'll deal with it. He says he loves her. He tells Winston he might have over-reacted by throwing his keys.

Jess shows up with Cece. Cece tries to explain that Gino from the photo shoot is just a guy she works with. When Jess hears Nick say everything's fine and he's moving in with Caroline, Jess throws her keys. Winston loses it, worrying about the werewolves that will eat him.

They unpack Nick's moving van. The tow truck can't come until tomorrow. Luckily, he stole a lot of beer. They hang out on his furniture and Jess finds a mix tape Nick made when he was 14. It includes ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something, then ""How Bizarre"" by OMC. Nick and Jess start rocking out.

Schmidt sees Cece's phone buzz with a text from Gino. ""Remember your butt? Me too. Ha ha LOL.""

Late at night, they're on to Crash Test Dummies ""Mmmm.""

Nick thinks they're trying to show him what a mistake he's making by having a good time. He goes to look for his keys in the dark.

Jess sees Schmidt bumming. He says Cece's never going to be happy with someone like him, so he'll have to ""White Fang her."" He thinks he has to let her go so she can be happy.

Jess finds Nick looking for his keys. They're talking when suddenly he grabs her and clamps his hand over her mouth. There's a coyote right next to them.

They hold on to each other and try to figure out what to do. Jess starts making the Road Runner ""meep meep"" sound.

Schmidt tells Cece they need to talk and says it's not working out. Then he shooes her away and tells her to go back to his kind. She asks if he's white fanging her. It's the only book on his Kindle. She tells him they have to trust each other.

""You slept with me, that doesn't say a lot about your taste in men,"" Schmidt says.

Down in the canyon, Nick and Jess are waiting for the coyote to make a move. Jess tells Nick that she wants him to be happy and if that means moving in with Caroline, he should do it. He wonders if she'll be OK and she says she will, because she met him.

Then she flips up the fur-lined hood of the coyote and says to beat it, you have to become it.

Nick tells the coyote he's not with her on this. ""This her move, not mine, sir,"" he says. She crawls at it, making ayiyiyiy noises and howling. It runs away. They celebrate, but their cheering freaks out Winston. He runs off into the night.

The night morning, he comes back, alive. Jess takes her keys out of her pocket, drops them on the ground and ""finds"" them.

Back in the city, they take Nick to Caroline's. The guys punch each other goodbye man-style, until Schmidt plants a wet one on Nick. Jess settles for a ""see ya.""

They settle in at their homes. Winston sleeps in the dark.

Jess closes her drapes but sees Nick's moving van outside. Then she hears Nick's mix tape blaring from his room.

""Welcome back, you clown,"" Jess says.

They each have their own private dance party in their rooms to ""You Shook Me all Night Long."" Neil sits on the couch next to a big box with air holes.

Jess closes things up by doing her slow dance funky chicken.

At least, that's what she tells us in a voiceover. So it's a bit shocking when she steps inside her house and shoots herself in the head. Mary Alice may be dead, but we soon realize her voiceovers will live on as narration from beyond the grave.

Mary Alice's suicide rattles the other residents of Wisteria Lane, including her closest friends. There's former high-powered businesswoman Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), who is unable to manage her three unruly boys. There's klutzy single mom Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher). There's model-turned-trophy-wife Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria Parker). And, finally, we have the perfect homemaker, Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross). These four ladies were Mary Alice's best friends. And not a single one of them has a clue as to why she killed herself.

At Mary Alice's wake, Susan meets plumber/hunky new neighbor Mike Delfino (James Denton). Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), urges her mom to make the first move. So, Susan brings Mike a housewarming gift. But she's not the only one interested in Mike; Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), the most predatory divorcee on the block wants him to come by and ""take a look at her pipes."" When Susan goes to invite Mike over for dinner, she's alarmed to see Edie is already there. So she lies about having a clogged drain. We admire Susan's initiative as a hot, prowling divorcee, but we question her commitment to her daughter's education once we see her stuff Julie's school project down the drain to create the aforementioned clog.

Nosy neighbor Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook) tells Susan that Edie is having a man over that night. Susan assumes it's Mike. She goes over, measuring cup in hand, to ""borrow a cup of sugar."" It's all very neighborly until Susan sneaks into Edie's house through the back door. While Edie is busy with her gentleman caller, Susan accidentally knocks over one of the many candles burning in the living room. The room erupts in flames and Susan bolts, leaving her measuring cup behind. Gathering with the rest of the neighbors to watch the raging fire, Susan is relieved to see Mike stroll by. He wasn't the one with Edie after all. You know, Susan never did get that cup of sugar.

Lynette is mortified when her three sons jump into the pool at Mary Alice's wake. She wades in, fully dressed, to get them out. When she runs into an old work colleague at the grocery store, a frazzled Lynette lies and says she's happy being a stay-at-home mom. Husband, Tom (Doug Savant), arrives home early from a business trip, much to Lynette's relief. But when Tom wants to have unprotected sex -- and risk getting her pregnant again -- Lynette socks him in the jaw. Tom may want to think again about getting some protection.

Gabrielle doesn't want to attend a party with her hubby, Carlos (Ricardo Chavira). It's being thrown by Carlos' boss, who is always trying to grope her. As soon as Carlos is gone, Gabrielle falls into the arms of her teenage gardener, John (Jesse Metcalfe), with whom she's been having a secret affair. Heading out for the boss' party, Carlos notices the yard hasn't been mowed. Rather than risk having John fired, Gabrielle sneaks away from the party and mows the lawn -- in her long dress and high heels. Landscaping never looked so good!

Bree's children bemoan her stuffy, formal dinners. So the family dines out at the Saddle Ranch Chop House, where Bree's husband Rex (Steven Culp) shocks her by saying he wants a divorce. Instead of answering him, Bree fixes him a salad from the salad bar, where she accidentally piles on onions, which Rex is deathly allergic to. At the hospital, Rex tells her he's sick of her being so perfect all the time. Her response is to disappear into the bathroom to water his flowers, where she wipes away the tears before coming back out.

Mary Alice's teenage son, Zach (Cody Kasch), wakes up in the middle of the night to find his father, Paul (Mark Moses), excavating something buried underneath the pool. We're not sure what is going on, but we do know that midnight pool excavations are rarely a good thing.

As Mary Alice's friends clear out her clothes, they find a handwritten note that arrived the day she killed herself. It reads, ""I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell."" Susan asks, ""Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?"" Now that we're hooked on these housewives, we're pretty desperate to know what Mary Alice did, too."

John jumps out of a window, but fortunately Carlos doesn't see that he's naked from the waist down, only that he's trimming the hedges as usual. Carlos surprises her with an expensive necklace but she is blase. He asks her what's bothering her and she says their marriage isn't exciting enough anymore and that she wants him to surprise her more often. She shows up at John's after deciding it's too dangerous for them to keep meeting at her house. After they have sex, he presents her with a single red rose. ""It's perfect, just like you,"" he says, and she realizes he's in love with her. Carlos surprises Gabrielle with a brand new sports car. When he asks her if it's the best gift she's ever gotten, she lies and says, ""Yes,"" even though John's gift clearly meant more to her.

Susan (Teri Hatcher) and the other women try to decide what to do about the blackmail note they found in Mary Alice's things. When Susan stops by to see her husband, Paul (Mark Moses), he tells her he doesn't care what Mary Alice's reasons were, so she hangs on to the note. Meanwhile, Paul has dug up a trunk that was buried beneath the pool. He wraps it in plastic and dumps it in a local lake, but it surfaces almost as soon as he's gone.

Bree (Marcia Cross) asks Rex (Steven Culp) if he'll cancel the meeting with the divorce lawyer and start going to a counselor instead. At Dr. Goldfine's (Sam Lloyd) office, Rex says Bree doesn't like to talk about her feelings, and that he doubts she even has any. But Bree's too distracted by a loose button on the doctor's jacket to listen. When Rex is delayed for their next meeting, Bree meets with the doctor alone and instead of telling him her problems, she insists he let her mend his button.

Mrs. Huber (Christine Estabrook) helps Edie (Nicollette Sheridan) go through the ruins of her house and gets suspicious when Edie denies that a still salvageable measuring cup is hers. Mrs. Huber finds out from Julie (Andrea Bowen) that Susan had lost her measuring cup and puts two and two together.

Lynette's (Felicity Huffman) rambunctious boys won't buckle up in her minivan and she is pulled over by a cop. But when the officer criticizes her mothering, she snaps and he is so intimidated, he lets her off with a warning. Mrs. Huber gives Lynette advice on how her mother dealt with her: she would leave her by the side of the road and drive off. In desperation, Lynette tries the tactic. But when she comes back for her boys, they're nowhere to be found. A neighbor has taken them in, and is threatening to call social services on Lynette. But the boys attack the woman, coming to their mother's defense. They may not be perfect, but at least they're loyal.

Susan is horrified when she runs into Mike (James Denton) while she's throwing out the garbage in her bathrobe, sans makeup. She asks him to dinner anyway, but since she's a terrible cook, he offers to host. Edie stops by as Mike and Susan are unloading groceries and Susan has no choice but to invite her. Susan is discouraged when Mike's dog, Bongo, doesn't seem to like Susan, but adores Edie. To get Bongo to like her, Susan dabs gravy on her ear. All goes well, until Bongo starts choking -- he's swallowed her long, dangly earring! The evening is over as Mike rushes Bongo to the vet. Mike tells Susan he was so upset because Bongo was his late wife's dog. Susan is relieved Mike isn't mad, but she realizes he's still not over his wife. What she doesn't know yet is that he's keeping a gun, a pile of money, and a map of Wisteria Lane in his kitchen cabinet."

Susan (Teri Hatcher) convinces the other women to go through with a dinner Mary Alice had planned. Bree agrees to host. Susan despairs at being the only single woman there, but then Mike (James Denton) jogs by. The men of Wisteria Lane are less enthusiastic about the dinner -- Carlos (Ricardo Chavira) is busy and Tom (Doug Savant) says he's too tired from traveling and begs Lynette to cancel the sitter. Rex is tired of keeping up appearances about his and Bree's marriage. She informs him that their cover story for therapy is they're taking tennis lessons.

After arguing with her ex-husband Karl (Richard Burgi), Susan feels bad and asks him to come over, intending to apologize to him. When he stops by, he catches her just out of the shower, wearing only a towel. During their ensuing argument, she slams his car door angrily -- right on her towel, which he takes with him as he drives off. She's naked in her front yard! And she's accidentally locked herself out! She's hiding in the bushes when Mike happens by and says he'd love to go to dinner. ""I assume the dress is casual,"" he jokes at her expense.

Zach (Cody Kasch) finds the gun Mary Alice used to kill herself and demands to know why his father kept it and why he won't talk about her at all. Just then Bree stops by to invite them to dinner, but Paul (Mark Moses) declines. Zach is disappointed but thanks Bree for remembering his mother.

Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) is making out with John (Jesse Metcalfe) in her foyer when a neighbor girl looking for her lost ball sees them through the glass door. Gabrielle decides the best bet is to bribe her with a doll. But what she really wants is a bike. When Gabrielle buys her one, she assumes that's the end of the blackmail, except now she has to teach her how to ride it!

Lynette (Felicity Huffman) blows her top when she sees photos from Tom's business trip of him downing margaritas with the guys at a Mexican restaurant. He says they can go to the dinner party, but she's already canceled the sitter, so he agrees to babysit. Irked when Tom is dismissive of the difficulties of taking care of the boys, Lynette urges the kids to load up on sugar.

At the dinner party, when Carlos peppers Rex with questions about tennis, Rex admits that he and Bree are in marriage counseling. Everyone is shocked but Bree plasters on a fake smile and says ""Dinner is served."" The mood is tense until Susan breaks the ice with her humiliating experience earlier that day. Lynette and Gabrielle both admit similarly embarrassing incidents. But the laughter stops when Bree blurts out, ""Rex cries when he ejaculates."" A furious Rex grabs his keys and leaves.

After dinner, Susan thanks Mike for being a perfect gentleman and he admits he snuck a peek. ""And for what it's worth, wow!"" he says. When Karl shows up with his new girlfriend, Brandy (Anne Dudek), the next day, Susan apologizes to both of them, even if they won't do the same for her. And then it's Brandy, not Karl, who offers the long-awaited apology.

Lynette tells Tom about the dinner fiasco and then asks him ""Are we happy?"" He reassures her by putting on a sombrero and making margaritas.

Rex is moving to a hotel while Bree cheerfully packs for him. When she asks him why this is happening, he says it's because she can't even let him pack his own suitcase.

A distressed Bree stops by Dr. Goldfine's office to ask him what Rex said in his private session. While he delays his next client, she notices audiotapes of his sessions and decides to take Rex's. Instead, she only has time to grab a tape marked ""Mary Alice."""

Nick Stokes and Warrick Brown both realize that they only need to solve one more crime to reach the level of CSI 3. Catherine Willows jumps out of a car, saying goodbye to her daughter and her sister before rushing into the CSI building. Jim Brass hands the CSIs their assignments for the night.

Brass and Grissom investigate what appears to be the suicide of Royce Harmon. However, the autopsy shows that the entry hole for the bullet is too small for a shot at close range, as would be the case if he had shot himself in the chest, and they realize that Harmon was murdered. Grissom finds a fingerprint with latex particles in it on the tape-recorder Harmon used to record his suicide note. The print belongs to Paul Millander, a man who sells fake Halloween hands made from a mold of his own hand. Grissom realizes that the suspect used one of these hands.

Nick Stokes arrives at his crime scene and meets a man who was drugged by a woman and had his possessions stolen while he was passed out. Nick notices a discoloration around the mans mouth. He then learns about Kristy Hopkins, who crashed her car because she passed out and may be connected to his case. He notices discoloration around her nipples and realizes that she put scopolamine on her nipples to knock out her victims and steal their possessions.

Catherine and Warrick arrive at a house where a man lies dead. They learn that the dead man had been staying at the house until the owners recently kicked him out. When he tried to kick in the door, the husband shot him. Catherine notices that the husband's left toenail is broken and that the laces of the dead mans shoes are tied differently from each other. Warrick processes the shoes and finds a broken toenail in one of them. He tries to obtain a warrant for the husbands toenails but Brass refuses to call the judge, so Warrick visits Judge Cohen. In exchange for giving him a blank warrant, the judge gets Warrick to place a bet for him on a football game.

Grissom takes Holly to her first crime scene, a store robbery, and leaves her there. However, when the store owner pulls a gun on Holly, she requests back up from Catherine. Later, as Holly wonders if she is cut out for this job, Catherine convinces her to stay until she solves her first case.

Brass discovers that Warrick went behind his back to obtain a warrant and pulls him from his case. He forces Warrick to shadow Holly. However, Warrick still has to place the bet for Judge Cohen and leaves Holly at the scene alone with a police officer. Unbeknownst to the CSI team, the officer leaves Hollys scene, leaving her to process the scene alone. The suspect returns to the scene and attacks her. Meanwhile, Grissom takes over Warrick's case and finds the husband's toenail clippings. He matches the broken nail in the shoe to the husband's clippings and concludes that the husband shot the victim and then kicked the door in to make the murder look like self-defense.

Nick, having solved his 100th case, is now a Level 3 CSI. As the CSI team begins to celebrate, Brass tells them the news that Holly has been shot and is in hospital."

Nick is assigned to work with Grissom on a case and Warrick is placed on leave until the Gribbs case is solved. Grissom also tells the team that he is bringing in Sara Sidle from San Francisco to investigate Hollys shooting.

Grissom and Nick arrive at their scene and find Ted Sallinger on the ground in front of a casino, having fallen from the roof. They learn that Sallinger had won the $40 million jackpot the night before and was staying in the presidential suite. As they process the suite, they find a broken champagne bottle and bloody towels. They question Sallingers girlfriend Jamie, who tells them that he broke up with her immediately after winning the jackpot. Angry at being dumped, she attacked him with the bottle; he left and never returned. The keycard records for the suite confirm her story.

Grissom and Nick conduct experiments to see if Sallinger fell, jumped, or was pushed from the roof they conclude that he was pushed, and thus murdered. Sara approaches Grissom at the crime scene and after a happy reunion, she asks after Holly.

Autopsy shows that Sallinger died due to blunt force trauma to his head. Grissom and Nick find fibers in the victim's watch, which was bought after he left his suite. The fibers match the carpet in the suite, indicating that he returned to the suite after he broke up with Jamie. Grissom discovers the murder weapon, a candlestick, in the suite and asks the hotel to check the keycard monitoring system. They learn that the monitor does not work, and conclude that Jamie attacked Sallinger when he returned to the suite after buying his watch. She then pushed him off the roof.

Catherine processes her crime scene and finds a beeper. Back at the lab, she meets Sara and is initially hostile, thinking that Sara will steal the case from her. However, they agree to cooperate and Sara asks where she can find Warrick. Catherine points her to the casinos.

Sara finds Warrick at a blackjack table, and he tells her he went to buy a coffee when Holly was shot and that he felt it was safe for him to leave because there was an officer there. Sara confronts him with the suspicion that he was placing a bet and tells him that Holly died on the operating table.

The beeper goes off, and Catherine calls the number. She expresses interest in meeting up for a little ""something something"", and the suspect gives her his address. She and Brass go to his motel to arrest him, and Catherine notices a cut on his face. She collects DNA from under Hollys fingernails and matches it to the suspect.

Warrick receives a phone call from Judge Cohen who informs him that he placed his bet on the wrong team. The mistake cost the judge $10,000, and demands that Warrick find the money and deliver it to him and tells him that he 'owns' Warrick for the time being.

Grissom speaks to Warrick about Sara's report and decides that since he has lost one good CSI, he does not want to lose another: He reinstates Warrick."

At the Garas' residence, Brass attempts to discourage Laura's husband, Jack, from paying the ransom, while Grissom and Nick analyze the tape-recorded message for evidence. Noticing a gap of silence and a low-frequency buzzing sound, they speculate that Laura is buried in the desert near power lines. Sara does a walk-through of the house and sees numerous signs of struggle. When Grissom joins her, he notices dirt on the bedroom carpet and a halothane-soaked handkerchief lying on the ground outside.

An analysis of the dirt from the Garas' home reveals traces of gold and cyanide, a combination commonly found at gold mines. Grissom and Sara search the desert with an infrared camera and spot the glowing image of a thrashing body underground. They frantically dig until they unearth Laura.

Unable to discourage Jack Garas from paying the ransom, Brass tails him to the drop site. When a young man retrieves the bag containing the money, the police move in.

When Grissom interviews Laura Garas at the hospital, she says she remembers being grabbed from behind in the hallway of her home and having something clamped over her mouth, but she cannot remember anything about her assailant. Grissom asks her for a DNA sample to compare to the duct tape used to silence her, and to the truck belonging to the man caught at the ransom drop-off site, Chip Rundle, Jack Garas' personal trainer. Brass tells Rundle that his fingerprints were found on Laura Garas' makeshift coffin. Rundle explains that he helped Jack move crates. Brass releases Rundle but recorded the interrogation to use as a vocal comparison to the ransom message.

The AV lab matches Rundle's voice with the voice on the ransom message. After finding strands of hair in the front passenger seat of Rundle's truck, Sara asks Grissom to help her reconstruct Laura's abduction. She notes that the fibers from the sheepskin seat covers were found on the back of Laura's sleeves, which could only have happened if Laura were sitting in an upright position like a normal passenger. A blood test confirms that Laura never ingested the halothane. The CSIs realize that Laura was an accomplice in her own ""abduction"".

Laura persistently denies any relationship with Rundle. Sara says they staged the kidnapping as part of a plan to run away together with a lump of Jack's fortune. Nick plays a cleaned-up version of the ransom recording for Jack; on it, Laura is heard telling Chip to ""Hurry up!"" As Laura is arrested, her angry husband asks Grissom why she didn't just give Rundle up. ""Self-preservation,"" Grissom explains. ""If she rats on him, she rats on herself.""

Catherine and Warrick are assigned to the case of the disturbing hit-and-run of a young girl, Renda Harris. The only evidence they find, however, is a common car-paint scrape on the girl's scooter, so they return to the lab. In autopsy, Doctor Williams shows them a partial license plate number made visible on a bruise imprinted on the body of the girl.

A hit on the partial license plate number brings Catherine and Warrick to the home of Charles Moore, a courteous seventy-three-year-old. He claims his car was stolen but a search of the house reveals the car to be in the garage. Moore confesses that he was behind the wheel, that he spotted Renda in the middle of the road but accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake.

Catherine and Warrick examine Moore's car and they notice the driver's seat is pushed too close for his height and that the car stereo has been set to a hip-hop station and is on full blast. They ask Moore if anyone else drives his car, just as his grandson, James, enters. Moore admits that after hitting Renda he'd banged his head and James drove him home; neither Catherine nor Warrick believe his story.

Catherine takes a closer look at Charles Moore's car and finds a small piece of tooth lodged in the steering wheel; the tooth belongs to James. James is arrested and Charles is released. An understanding and sympathetic Warrick accompanies James and offers advice before he's taken into custody. Warrick also writes his cell number on James' hand and tells him to contact him just in case trouble arises."

Autopsy shows head trauma and signs of recent sex. Catherine calls Wendys husband, Winston, and the CSIs are surprised to learn that he did not report Wendy missing, although she was in the water for two days. They question him and learn that his marriage was on the rocks the couple had not had sex for several months.

Further inspection of the body reveals splinters in her head wound and shows that Wendy was dead before she fell into the water. Her stomach contents lead Grissom and Catherine to a restaurant near the lake. A waitress recognizes Wendys picture and remembers that she had dinner with a Phil Swelco. Grissom and Catherine track him down and question him. He is distraught at the news of Wendys death and admits that they were having an affair. He says that after their date, Wendy took her boat across the lake back to her house.

As they leave Swelcos house, they see Winston waiting for them outside. He says he was following them and asks how Swelco is related to Wendys death. Later, Grissom and Catherine discuss how much they should tell Winston about Wendys affair. When Catherine later tells Winston, Grissom angrily reprimands her for compromising the case because of her personal feelings.

Grissom and Catherine find Wendys boat and discover that it ran out of gas. They realize that Wendy tried to restart the engine, dislocated her shoulder, lost her balance, hit her head, and fell into the water. They visit Swelco to tell him the news and find him dead in his house. Winston sits nearby, sobbing that Swelco killed his wife. However, they inform Winston that Wendy's death was an accident and that he killed an innocent man.

Warrick goes to court to testify in a case but is frustrated to find that the case has been continued. Judge Cohen, who considers Warrick to be in his debt, tells Warrick to compromise the evidence for a rape case because he owes the rapists family. Warrick protests but Judge Cohen does not let him refuse. Warrick returns to the lab and attempts to sign out the evidence in the rape case but cannot bring himself to do so. Morally conflicted, he turns to Grissom for guidance.

Warrick meets Judge Cohen and asks him for assurance. He leads the judge into outlining his exact wants, and Brass appears to arrest him. Warrick reveals that he was wearing a wire, and defiantly tells the judge that nobody owns him.

Sara and Nick arrive at a fraternity house where James, a pledge, is hanging in an apparent suicide. Autopsy shows signs that James suffocated, but his tongue is missing teeth marks, a common side effect of hanging. They also find ink on his penis. They question two members of the fraternity, Matt and Kyle, and learn about an initiation that all pledges must go through: going to sorority row and having different parts of their bodies signed. James was caught signing his own penis and was humiliated in front of the other pledges as punishment.

James autopsy also reveals a strip of raw liver with threads of fabric in it in his throat. When Sara and Nick accuse Matt and Kyle of hazing, they explain that James asked for one more chance to prove himself, so Matt made him swallow raw liver. When James choked on it, they performed the Heimlich maneuver but he died; they staged the hanging to avoid suspicion. However, Sara and Nick find no evidence of the Heimlich on James body. Closer examination of James penis reveals a signature: Jill.

In autopsy, Grissom and Warrick learn that Erics body is abnormally dry. Warrick discovers that the maggots found in his body contain jimsonweed, suggesting that he ingested the drug before he died. Warrick also finds traces of aluminum in Erics nose.

Brass questions Bobby, Erics friend. Bobby says that he and Eric attended a rave and that they drank a tea that they bought that night. He does not remember what happened after that, but knows that he has not seen Eric since the rave. The coroner finds jimsonweed seeds in Erics stomach, but the seeds were not toxic enough to kill Eric. As he questions Bobby, Bobby continually scratches his arm; he says he thinks a spider has bit him and shows the bite to Grissom. He also tells Grissom that he works in a fireworks shop.

Grissom and Warrick realize that after the boys drank the jimson tea, Eric developed photophobia. Scared by the lights of the rave, he ran into the desert and took off his clothing as his body temperature rose. Meanwhile, Bobby developed auditory hallucinations, and he attacked Eric to keep him quiet. The aluminum in Erics airway came from Bobbys hands as he suffocated him, and the bite mark on Bobbys arm matches a mold of Erics teeth.

Sara arrives at a dumpster where a womans body, wrapped in plastic, has been dumped. She discovers that the womans body has been embalmed, and uses the womans fingerprints to learn that the woman was buried the week before. Sara talks to the funeral director who suggests that the grave was robbed for gold or jewelry. They exhume the grave but find no casket, and the director suggests that the casket was stolen too as it would be just as valuable. Sara arranges a viewing of the caskets and is surprised to find hairs from multiple donors inside the caskets. She discovers that the fingerprints on the plastic belong to the funeral director, and he confesses that he was recycling coffins in order to make more money.

Catherine and Nick arrive at a school and find the dean in an office, dead due to blunt force trauma to the head. The founder of the school, Kit Armstrong, says she hit the dean on the head with an object in self-defense after he tried to force himself on her. Catherine and Nick determine that the dean was hit three times while he was lying on the floor. They also discover a void in the spatter pattern, indicating the presence of a third person in the room when Dean Woods was killed.

Kit admits that she had asked Julia Easton, a teacher, to come to the office to witness the harassment. Nick tells her that reenactments of the crime show that the dean was on the floor when he was killed and that Kit would have needed help to hold him down while she hit him. Catherine and Nick process the deans shirt and find a void in the blood spatter. They trace it and find a hand print, one with a disproportionely long pinky finger. They question Julia and learn that she has a sprained pinky finger. Nick offers her a finger splint as Catherine demonstrates how a hand with a splint on the pinky finger creates the exact void found on the deans shirt. Catherine speculates that Julia held down Dean Woods while Kit killed him. Kit confesses that the dean was blackmailing her after learning about her lesbian relationship with Julia."

The weapon is identified as a curved object with a serrated edge (eg crocodile teeth).

The house in whose foundation the Jane Doe was dump was sold after completion, removing the homeowner from suspicion. Grissom notes that, ""if not for a leaky pipe, she could have been down there forever."" Nick confirms that the ""killer was counting on it.""

Grissom calls in Teri Miller, with whom he communes over tarantulas, to make a model of Jane Doe's face. The apply a gel to the mold to the concrete to find Jane Doe's face. She is of nordic decent, so blond, and brown eyes are chosen because they photograph better. The news helps circulate the molded face, which is identified as Fae Green.

Dr. Robbins finds traces of salt and sand perserved in the ear canal. Grissom talks to Fae's mother, who says that Fae had just been certified as a scuba diver and had just moved in with boyfriend Jason Hindler, before her disappearance. The mother is certain that Hindler has nothing to do with Fae's death. Nevertheless, Nick and Grissom pay Hindler, now married, a visit. While wandering around Mr. Hindler's den, discovers that a previous fish tank had broken and leaked salty water and sand on to the floor.

Nick finds out that Mr. Hindler used to be a subcontractor at the housing development. Going back to the scene, Grissom finds bloody hand prints. They accuse Mr. Hindler, who screams ""I didn't kill Fae. I love her. I still love her."" His wife, Amy, is startled by the revelation. Nick sees a picture, and realizes that the murder weapon was a rock climbing pick. Amy pulls a gun on Nick and confesses that she killed Fae with one. Mr. Hindler was engaged to Amy before he met Fae, and Amy inadvertently killed Fae in order to get him back. Grissom pulls a gun on Amy and talked her down.



Grissom gives Sara an OIS (Officer-Involved Shooting), and Warrick volunteers to double-up. The officer is Joe Tyner, who ""responded to shots fired; suspect fled the scene."" The story goes that Officer Tyner followed a man in a jeep in a car chase until they ended in a parking lot. The man refused to be taken in and shot himself during the standoff. Warrick takes the gun, supposedly drawn but not fired. Unfortunately, a bullet is missing from the gun's clip, which weighs on Warrick's suspicion of the victim speeding down the strip only to commit suicide. Sara worries about pissing off the Police Department.

Sara and Warrick interrogate Officer Tyner without telling Brass first, who serves as Tyner's Union Rep. The round was not found at the scene, and Tyner can not explain where it went.

Warrick goes off to the crime scene to search for the bullet. A parking valet comes up to the CSIs and gives his version of the story, which matches word-for-word up to the point where the victim shoots himself. Instead, according to the valet, the man got out his registration, and the officer fired, ""just like that.""

The D.A. files charges against Officer Tyner, who violently confronts Warrick. Grissom stands up for Warrick, and Brass confronts Grissom in turn, demanding the missing bullet. Warrick deduces that, if ""it's not in the body"" and ""it's not at the crime scene"", then it must be in the jeep; the two break the jeep apart, piece by piece. After searching ""every single piece of metal,"" Warrick finds the missing bullet in the spare tire. However, the lab determines that said bullet is from the victim's gun, confirming that the victim committed suicide.



Grissom tries to withhold a 426 (sexual assault) from Catherine over ""conflict of interest."" The alleged victim is an exotic dancer, which we learn Catherine used to be, and the accused is Catherine's ex-husband, Eddie. Catherine asks to do the prelim(inary evaluation), nonetheless; Grissom agrees.

Eddie claims that the sex was consensual. Catherine is planning on delegating the case to another CSI, and Eddie warns that, without Catherine, their daughter Lindsey may have to visit Eddie at Nevada State Prison. Grissom is concerned that Catherine is still in love with Eddie and demands she pass the case off to Warrick. He later confronts Warrick, who attempts to cover for Catherine.

Catherine walks in on Det. Evans interviewing the alleged victim, ""April."" There are bruises and skin under the victim's fingernails, but these could be consistent with either rape or rough sex. Catherine takes advantage of her past as an exotic dancer to get information from April's manager, Ted Beaton. Searching April's locker, Catherine finds contraceptives. The Contraceptive Film have to be inserted 1-3 hours before having sex, meaning that April had to have known she was going to have sex 1 - 3 hours before being ""raped.""

Confronted with this, April admits that she faked the crime in an attempt to get money out of Eddie."

Please, God, help me!""

The mother, father, and two brothers of a family were murdered. The two sisters were spared.

Simon, an intern, follows Grissom through a preliminary walk-through of the house, taking his notes. The father, Stock Collins, is lying in a pool of blood where he died, a single-edged blade having stabbed him several times in the back and neck. Simon feels sick, and Sara takes over for him.

A blood swirl is left on the wall; Sara thinks it might be a cult symbol. The mother was stabbed once to the throat, likely while sleeping. A brother was found, killed in the same manner as his mother. The blood swirl is found, again, on the mirror. The younger brother was still alive when he died, his blood prints on the wall.

Grissom declares that ""this is the only crime scene in Las Vegas tonight.""

Grissom talks to Tina Collins, who is worried about her little sister, Brenda Collins (Dakota Fanning). Brenda offers only the cryptic ""the buffalo.""

The offending knife was taken from the house, and the killer had been in the house before. Grissom finds a footprint in the kitchen, but it belongs to the paramedics.

Grissom sends Sara to accompany Brenda Collins to the hospital, which Sara resents. She tries to talk with Brenda, who reacts badly. Tina is put through a psych evaluation. After an examination with psychiatrist Dr. Leever (Aasif Mandvi), a woman tries to take Brenda, but Sara refuses to leave her.

Catherine thinks the blood swirls are mimicry of cults. Grissom determines that the killings woke the father, who ran to protect Brenda. Catherine maps out the crime scene for hours on end, working past a time when she was supposed to pick up Lindsey. Instead, Eddie picked up their daughter, and had pancakes waiting for his ex when she got home. Unfortunately, at that moment, Grissom calls for her return. Later, Eddie files a complaint with social services against Catherine.

Warrick find treads from a scooter, one that a kid, Oliver, living nearby owns. It turns out that three other kids share the scooter. One had had sex with Tina, but was grounded. One had gone camping. The third, Jesse Overton, had also had sex with Tina and was with a church group. Jesse smokes the same kind of cigarettes with the same kind of matches that were found at the scene.

Grissom is busied with the fact that Tina Collins, who he'd presume would run to her family to see if they were still alive, didn't have a spot of blood on her clothing. Tina can't explain it.

Jesse throws away the scooter in his own trash can, along with his bloody clothes. Under a polygraph, Jesse confesses to all four murders, saying that Tina requested it of him. Jesse lies about the motive, so Grissom continues to investigate.

Catherine discovers that the father was actually killed, coming out of Brenda's room. The father had been sexually abusing Brenda, just like he had Tina. He wore a necklace with a buffalo on it. The mother and brothers were killed because they didn't protect either girls. As it turns out, Brenda is Tina's daughter with her father."

In first class, a little girl cries for her mother as some sort of scuffle takes place. On the runway, Brass announces that the plane is being treated as a crime scene. He and Grissom enter first class and it's a mess with a dead guy still on the floor. There are ten witnesses, nine passengers and one flight attendant. According to the crew, the dead guy had some sort of attack and died before the plane landed. Grissom photographs a bloody handprint on the cockpit door and some shoe impressions. There's also blood on the dead guy's hand and shirt, with blood on a CD nearby. Grissom says he wants the entire plane taped off.

Outside the plane, the sheriff comes up to Grissom and tells him that the FAA has jurisdiction but since they won't be here until sunrise, CSI has ""about twelve hours to be heroes."" Back in first class, the rest of CSI has arrived. Sara tells Nick that the passengers in coach didn't see anything and left through the rear of the plane. The dead guy is Tony Candlewell, a communications company manager from Atlanta with no record. Looking around the plane, they think there's too much damage for one guy, but Grissom says that with ten witnesses saying Tony Candlewell went nuts, they have to rely on the evidence. Grissom has Catherine and Warrick start interviewing the ten people from first class; he also says they should assume everyone has evidence on them. He tells Nick to go with the coroner and says that he and Sara will work the crime scene.

The first class passengers are being held in the airport lounge. Brass comes in with Catherine and Warrick, announcing that they're here to gather evidence. When a passenger protests, Catherine becomes the PR guy, saying that they'll make this as quick and painless as possible.

Back at the plane, Grissom interviews the pilot, who says that he saw Tony Candlewell board and that he seemed like an okay guy. The pilot didn't become aware of a problem until about thirty-five minutes into the flight when the flight attendant (Shannon) asked him to come out because of a problem with a passenger. In a flashback, we see Tony Candlewell banging on the bathroom door because it's occupied. Shannon tells another flight attendant to make sure no one from coach comes forward. The pilot tells Candlewell thatthere are two other bathrooms in coach he can use; when Candlewell refuses, the pilot tells him that he needs to go back to his seat. In the present, the pilot says that Candlewell didn't seem to be drunk or on drugs and that flying seems to bring out the worst in some people.

At the morgue, Dr. Williams takes Candlewell's temperature; it's 98.1. Nick comments that since a body's temperature starts dropping after death, he should be colder than that. He puts the temperature at the time of death at about 101.6. There's also petechial hemorrhaging behind the eyes (suggesting suffocation), an impression on the neck that looks like the heel of a boot, multiple contusions on the front and back, and a broken hand with some defensive wounds on the palms.

Grissom and Sara map out who was sitting where in the plane. They note that the seat directly in front of where Tony Candlewell was is broken. We see Brass and Catherine interview the guy (Nate) who sat there. He says he flies first class so he can work during the flight but Candlewell kept kicking the back of the seat, although he claims he only punched the back of the seat to get Candlewell to stop. Meanwhile, back on the plane, Grissom finds blood drops away from where the action occurred. Sara finds something interesting (that we don't see) where Lou Everitt was sitting. Warrick and Brass track him down. He has a cut across his face that he claims he got when Tony Candlewell swung at his face with a CD. Brass and Warrick, however, seems to doubt his story, noting that he's had a few drinks (Everitt claims he's a nervous flier and that Shannon, the flight attendant, will back his story). Brass and Catherine interview her. She says that thiry-five minutes in, he began pressing his call button complaining of a headache, so she gave him some aspirin. She claims not to know what set off his headache. Grissom comes in and asks if Catherine's found out anything. She tells him no and suggests that they're all hiding something.

Grissom heads back to the plane and tells Sara that, according to Nick, when the coroner cut open Tony Candlewell, she found intracranial bleeding, thoracic hemorrhaging, and a ruptured spleen. Sara finds a broken bottle with what looks like dry blood on it next in 2E, which was occupied by Marlene Valdez. Brass and Catherine interview her and her husband, Max. She's complaining about her blouse, saying it's ruined. She thinks her husband owes her for saving his life. She says that Tony Candlewell was wandering around sweaty with his eyes glazed over and she was sure he was going to hijack the plane. We see this in a flashback, with her telling Max to do something before she does. Max gets up and tries to get Candlewell to return to his seat. Candlewell responds by shoving Max into the drink cart. Back on the plane, Grissom finds the other half of the broken bottle that Marlene slashed the victim with. They figure he would have headed to the lavatory to wash up. They head over there; there's no visible evidence, but Sara brings over an alternative light source (?) and Grissom's Christopher Columbus, which shows evidence of sperm. Warrick and Catherine interview Vicki Mercer and her ""business partner."" She says she was in the lavatory (alone) and he claims he was asleep with his headphones on the entire time, so they don't know what happened.

On the plane, Sara finds khaki fibers from pants similar to the ones Tony Candlewell was wearing caught in one of the seats. At the lab, Greg and Nick are working on getting evidence from the victim's clothes. Greg says that there is no blood or saliva but Nick finds shoe prints on the back of the jacket. Grissom tells Nick to bring the jacket up and tells Catherine to get prints off of everybody's shoes. Three people's shoes match the impressions on the jacket-Lou Everitt, Max Valdez, and Dr. Kiera Behrle.

The interview the doctor first. She has a black eye that she claims she got during the fight. Catherine asks why her shoe impressions were on the victim's jacket. In a flashback, we see her get elbowed in the face, which is when she accidentally steps on Tony Candlewell's body before she starts to give him CPR. On the plane, Sara checks the defibrillator on the plane-it was never used. She figures that even if Dr. Behrle didn't know about the defibrillator, the flight attendant should have. She claims that by the time she thought to grab the paddles, it was too late, and besides which, she was scared. She thought he was going to bring the plane down. In a flashback, we see her try to get everyone to return to their seats. Candlewell pushes her out of the way and starts hitting and kicking the door to the cockpit. Everyone is accounted for during the struggle except for the guy in 1A, Mr. Cash.

Warrick and Grissom go to interview Mr. Cash. He was in his seat the whole time but didn't see much-he's legally blind. He could hear a lot of shouting and dimly see the victim being pulled away from the door. He identifies the voices as Lou Everitt, Max Valdez, and Nate (the guy who's seat was being kicked). He hears a struggle, people shouting (""Get him away from the door!""), and dimly sees a group subdue the victim. Grissom's beeper goes off-it's Dr. Williams. Tony Candlewell was suffering from undiagnosed encephalitis and that's what set him off.

All the CSIs are now at the plane carrying dummies to represent several of the passengers so they can act out the murder. They have ten minutes before they have to turn the plane over to the FAA. They start out with Tony Candlewell taking his aspirin and uncontrollably kicking Nate's seat, causing him to drop his laptop and confront the guy. They figure that Lou Everitt got up and took a swing at the victim, causing him to take a swipe at him with the CD. They figure that Max gets up to confront Candlewell and get shoved, which is when Marlene slashes at him with the wine bottle. He then goes for the cockpit, but the door is locked so he heads for the exit and attempts to open that door. They figure that Lou, Nate, Max, Marlene, and Dr. Behrle jump the victim before Sara interrupts and tells them that ""if you jump a guy at the exit, he dies at the exit."" Since Candlewell was found several feet away, they figure that he must have tried to escape. After he died, Dr. Behrle turned him over and attempted CPR (probably to cover for herself).

It's now sunrise and the plane belongs to the FAA. Unfortunately, when Grissom tells the sheriff what happened, the sheriff decides to turn the passengers loose, saying that a jury will never believe that five strangers got on a plane and killed someone. Grissom and Catherine watch as the passengers are bused to their destinations before returning to the crime lab where Warrick, Nick, and Sara are watching the news and discussing the outcome of the case. Warrick understands why the passengers did what they did, says that it was self-defense and he would do the same thing. Nick and Sara say that it was murder; Nick's on the fence about how far he would go, but Sara says she could never take a life. Nick asks Catherine what she would do if she and Lindsey were on the plane; she says she would go all the way. Grissom points out that they're all speaking from the point of view of the passengers. He says that everyone just assumed that Tony Candlewell was a jerk and a threat. He says that it took five people to kill him but it would have only taken one person to ask what was wrong and save his life."

The husband, Scott Shelton, claims to have nothing to hide. Searching the house, Sara notes how little of Kaye's things are present. Grissom finds evidence of a green blanket, like the one Kaye was wrapped in, no longer on the couch. Brass determines that the husband's gun has recently been cleaned. Mr. Shelton comes up with an explanation for every discovery.

After Sara finds evidence of blood, she and Mr. Shelton scream at each other. ""I am a woman, I have a gun, and look at how he treated me. I can only imagine how he treated his wife.""

Grissom determines that Kaye Shelton had been dead for 3 days, and Sara is disappointed that the team couldn't have found the husband guilty. Grissom checks the blanket, and determines that it took the insects an extra 2 days to start breeding in the corpse.

Grissom assigns Catherine and Warrick the missing Paul Sorenson, last seen at the home of Richard Zeigler. Warrick has a court date, testifying about chain of custody. As it turns out, the Paul Sorenson was a painting. Mr. Zeigler thinks he walked in on the robber, who had disengaged the security alarm.

Dusting for prints, Warrick thinks he has found an ear print. Mr. Zeigler lines up all of the family to have their ears printed. The print matches a son, Jason, who has the painting in the trunk of his car. Mr. Zeigler decides to not press charges.

Catherine feels that there's more to the story, and Warrick has to go. Ecklie tells Grissom that Warrick was gambling at the Masino instead of being in court. Grissom has Sara look in to it, and she finds that he was, in fact, in the casino.

Catherine investigates further, and discovers that the painting is a forgery. The two go to Jason's dorm room and recover the real Sorenson. The son had been switching out the million dollar paintings for his fakes, partially because it amused him to know his father didn't know the difference.

She goes to her baby son's room to find he is missing and the window is wide open with a ladder leaning against it. She also finds a note in the crib saying that the kidnapper will call with instructions in six hours. Grissom arrives at the scene and the mother and her husband Steve are waiting for him with the ransom note. Grissom is interested in the open soda bottle on the kitchen counter. The father informs him he opened it when he called 911. Grissom requests an unopened soda bottle, a piece of Zack's (the baby) clothing and blood samples from the entire family. Grissom tells Sara to examine the ransom note and to take the Anderson's computer printer with her to the lab. He also gives Nick the opened and unopened soda bottles and tells him to open the bottle at 72 °F. Sara finds out the note does not match the Andersons' printer, so Grissom tells her to get a warrant for all the printers at Mr. Anderson's office.

The scent dogs start barking and Grissom and Warrick run to meet them. They find Zack's body carefully placed under a statue at the golf course. The autopsy reveals that Zack died due to asphyxiation. Grissom thinks it is possible maybe his abductor accidentally smothered him, but Dr. Robbins believes the crime was too violent to have been accidental; his sternum was cracked. Grissom and Catherine talk to the Andersons, explaining why they cannot release the body and that the way Zack's body was treated is not consistent with a stranger having abducted him. Grissom and Catherine find a pair of nylons with green stains, an empty bag that once contained a baby blanket and a roll of rubbish bags, at the Andersons' house.

Nick tells Grissom, at the lab, that the soda bottle was opened at 11:30 pm (which is not consistent with the time when 911 was called). A set of prints on the ransom note is matched to Needra Fenway, Steve Anderson's secretary; her printer also matches the ransom note.

Fenway says she was having an affair with Steve, but that she ended it. Grissom says her hair was found in the crib and Catherine tells her that getting rid of Zachary would have been an easy way to end Steve and Gwen's marriage. Dr. Kane (psychologist) informs Grissom that mothers sometimes kill their children in order to avenge their husbands' affairs.

Zack's time of death is placed at around 9pm and Dr. Robbins discovers the fiber that was in his throat is Metaradim, a fire retardant. Grissom finds an oven mitt at the Andersons' house that matches the fiber. Catherine and Warrick replay the 911 call. They hear a distressed Gwen and then Catherine suggests checking if Tyler (the older son) has a cell phone.

At a meeting between Grissom and Catherine and the Andersons' lawyers, the CSIs are granted three questions for each family member. Grissom points out that a ransom price was not listed on the note, and asks if it is because they could not put a price on their own son. Gwen quickly confesses to the crime and says her husband and older son were only lying to protect her. She tells them she accidentally smothered Zack with a pot holder, when he would not stop crying.

When Warrick hears that Gwen and Steve have been arrested he is very surprised, because on a 911 recording from Tyler's cell phone you can hear him shout ""What did you do, Robbie?"" (Robbie is the middle son). Tyler tells Gil and Brass what happened. His parents were out. He was on the phone with his girlfriend, and when he turned around he saw Zack dead and his three-year-old brother Robbie standing over him with a pot holder in his hand. He called 911, but then got disconnected. When his parents returned home they found him performing CPR- the wrong way; instead of using two fingers on Zack's chest, Tyler was using his palms, which is what cracked his sternum. Steve tells Grissom they did not tell the truth, because they did not want Robbie to have to live with the fact that he had killed his baby brother. As he is three, Robbie can not be held liable for his brother's death, and it is unlikely he will have any memories of it later in life, Gwen is released to be with her family and to face questions from the press."

When Frasier remarks that Mann's statement gives no additional details as to why he hates Frasier, Mann does a follow-up column. The remarks cause Frasier to go on another tirade on the air, in which Mann eventually calls in and challenges Frasier to a fight. Frasier attempts to say no, but is chided by Mann to a public fist-fight.

When he gets home, Martin explains how proud he is that Frasier didn't back down, but Frasier contends that he is not going to fight Mann. Martin then explains his distaste for this, comparing Frasier's actions to what he did when he was in school, where he avoided facing a bully.

Frasier takes this to heart and shows up the next day, intending to fight Mann. However, before the fight can begin, some officers break up the fight. Secretly, Martin arranged for some of his friends to come down and stop the fight, saving Frasier from being knocked out."

Returning to his apartment, Frasier tells Martin that he is willing to take his Father anywhere he'd like to go on a vacation. Much to Frasier's (masked) chagrin, Martin claims he would like to go on a road trip in a motorhome.

This leads to Frasier having a conversation in private with Niles, and Martin in private with Daphne. Both Frasier and Martin try to get the other to come along, feeling that the situation may not be enjoyable.

Niles refuses at first, but once he hears Daphne is coming, he agrees to come along.

Once the road trip gets started, Martin tells how he intends for them to go to visit Mt Rushmore. However, Frasier claims he wishes to see where the road takes them.

Eventually, the group find themselves in a small tourist stand, but upon finding out they are in Canada, Daphne panics. As she doesn't have her Green Card yet, she is in danger of being deported.

The group then attempts to calmly head back over the border, but are stopped by customs. Martin manages to save the day when he makes up a story that they don't have a proper license for Eddie, and shows that he's a retired cop from Seattle.

Following the aftermath, Frasier and Martin have a small heart-to-heart talk, as the rest of the passengers sleep calmly."

He meets with his publisher, Sam Tanaka, at Café Nervosa with Frasier at the table to present a new idea, which he doesn't have. When Sam floats the idea of two siblings writing a book about sibling psychology, Niles leaps on the idea and tells him that will be the project. Frasier is initially reluctant to join the project, but Niles convinces him to do it. When they start writing, they find themselves at a loss for ideas, but get the idea to use Frasier's show to get material. The next day, Frasier has a theme show and asks callers to share their stories of sibling relationships, giving them a wealth of material for the day. After the show Sam Tanaka calls and tells them he has been discussing the serialization rights with Reader's Digest and wants the first few chapters as a sample. Frasier and Niles tell him their current material is very rough and Sam gives them until Friday to rework the book.

Following the Gershwin brothers' example, Frasier suggests that he and Niles lock themselves in a hotel room to get the privacy they need. They do so and start writing, but spend days in the hotel room and become unable to even agree on the opening sentence. Come Friday, they have nothing to show for their work except a lot of resentment on Niles' part because he is annoyed by how he is more successful as a psychiatrist than Frasier, who still becomes a celebrity, and he is tired of being the second of the two to reach the milestones of life, such as getting married and having children. After the Crane brothers' fight turns into physical violence, they split up. After their resentment continues for a while, Martin tells them about a partner he had on the force who as killed after they had a similar falling out. The story, which he later tells Daphne was a lie, makes Frasier and Niles make amends."

Frasier holds out for as long as he can, but finally calls off due to the sickness. Gil takes Frasier's time slot while he's out, bhut Roz soon overhears Gil and the station manager talking bout Gil taking the slot permanently. Hoping to stave this off, Frasier convinces Niles to substitute for him until he gets better.

Niles does so, and Frasier is now incensed when it seems that Niles is doing a great job. After suffering a nightmare in which Gil and Niles plot to kill him, Frasier awakes and demands Daphne get him some medication.

Frasier returns to the station drugged up. While Niles and Roz demand he go home, Frasier tricks them and locks them out of the recording booth, before security ends up dragging him out of the building.

We then see Frasier wake up, confiding to Daphne that he had a dream that he went down to the station drugged up, and was dragged out. Daphne manages to calm Frasier down, claiming it was all a dream. However, as she leaves his door, Martin asks why she didn't tell him that it all really happened."

Eventually, Daphne, Martin, and Eddie stop by with Daphne wishing to pick up some more coffee beans, as Martin angrily gets into an argument with Frasier before he takes Eddie and leaves.

Daphne takes leave soon after to find Martin, and Frasier and Niles have a discussion regarding Niles little infatuation with her. Roz soon after takes leave and tells the two that the man she was meeting was trying to convert her to his religion. Frasier soon wonders himself if he will ever find someone, or end up old and alone.

Martin soon after returns to the Cafe, and apologizes for his foul mood. When Frasier notes that something seems to be upsetting him, Martin explains that a week ago was his birthday, but noone remembered.

Continuing on, Herbert takes his dog into the nearby park and finds blood splattered on a tree. The dog sniffs at it and then runs off, and Herbert chases after it. It stops by the corpse of a young boy underneath a railroad overpass, and Herbert stares in shock

That night, detective Ralph Anderson drives to the crime scene where other police officers have already arrived. An officer, Tamika Collins, is questioning Herbert, and Ralph explains that he got held up in court. Tamika takes Ralph to the corpse, explains that it was Frankie Peterson, Joy and Fred's younger son. He tells her to have someone take Herbert home, and stares at the bloody corpse in horror. Yunis Sablo with GBI introduces himself and offers whatever help his department can provide. Yunis says that there are human teeth impressions on the wounds.

Later, Ralph questions Herbert, who says that he didn't see anyone going to the park. He describes the van but didn't see much. Herbert confirms that he didn't touch the corpse to see if it was still alive.

A few days later at home, Terry Maitland is making breakfast for his wife Glory and daughters Maya and Jessa. Terry talks about the Little League he's coaching and they all agree that his team the Dragons will win. Jessa tells Terry privately that it was brave of the families wanting to play, and Terry notes that it's been a few days since the murder and people want to see if they can push through.

Jeannie tells her husband Ralph that she has to work at the shelter. Ralph is lying on his bed, staring up at the ceiling in shock, He talks about how they trust their son Derek with the killer for two years, and Jeannie points out that Derek died of cancer and Ralph should focus on arresting the killer for what he has done. Ralph goes and says that hopes the killer resists.

The Dragons are at the baseball field playing, and Terry is coaching from the first base line.

Ralph gets an arrest warrant at the courthouse and leaves. Ralph remembers he and Tamika going to the Peterson house and Joy coming to the door. She stares at them and realizes something is wrong, that something happened to Frankie, she screams.

-----

Ralph meets with teacher Mary Moore. He questions Mary, who describes how she was leaving the grocery store at 3 pm and saw Frankie walking his bike past, his wheel chain broken. She tells Ralph that Terry pulled up in a white van and gave Frankie a lift. All Mary remembers about the van plate is that it was out of state, but insists Terry was driving.

As Ralph goes, he calls Tamika to get a copy of Terry's prints from the Board of Education.

-----

Ralph and his officers arrive at the baseball field and Ralph tells them to go in and read Terry's his rights so that everyone can hear, and then make sure everyone sees them cuff him.

Yunis arrives with a search warrant for the house .

Ralph talks to Juney Moore, Mary's daughter, She tells him that that she was walking near the park and saw the white van. Terry walked out of the woods, his mouth covered in blood, and looked at Juney. When she asked about the blood, Terry claimed that he got hit by a branch. The girl is sure Terry was making it up because he had blood all over. Terry got in the van, waved to Juney, and drove off.

-----

Terry sends Trevor in to bat even though he hasn't got a hit all season, insisting that everyone plays. Glory stands up in the stands, and the two officers come over and arrest Terry for Frankie's murder. Terry apparently has no idea what they're talking about, and they cuff him and read him his rights. Everyone watches and some of them take photos on their cameras.

-----

The police find the van and take DNA and blood samples. They remove a flyer from under the windshield wiper. Meanwhile, Ralph meets with Claude Bolton, a strip bar bouncer at the Peach Crease and AA member. Claude says that Terry came into the bar at 8 on the night of the murder and asked to use the men's room to clean up the blood on his face. He asks Claude if there is a ""doc in a box"" in the area to get his nose cauterized, and Terry asks him to call him a cab. Terry confirms that he parked his van in the back and Claude assures him it will be okay there for a while.

Claude tells Ralph that Terry came out of the rest room wearing fresh clothing and describes them, including a belt with a horsehead buckle on. He hesitates and then says that Terry had more blood on the back of his jacket and it didn't jibe with him saying he had a nosebleed.

-----

The officers take Terry to Ralph's police car, and Glory runs after them and demands to know where they're taking her husband. Ralph tells Glory to let them take Terry away, and Terry calls to her to get their daughters and call their lawyer, Howard Saloman. The officers drive off with Terry and Glory goes back to the field.

Howie is practicing at a driving range when Glory calls him. She tells him that the police arrested Terry for Frankie's murder, and says that Terry wasn't in town the day of the murder. Howie figures the police have a search warrant for the Maitland house and tells Glory to drop the girls off at a friend's house. He then tells Glory not to let the police take anything but what's on the warrant, and to refuse to answer their questions on her lawyer's advice.

In the car, Terry tells Ralph that he was out of town when Frankie was killed. Ralph asks Terry if he ever touched Derek, and Terry is offended. Another officer, Don, asks him if there were other boys. Terry tells Ralph that he just ruined their lives and sits back.

-----

Ralph talks to a cab driver, who picked up Terry at the Peach Crease. Terry insists that she call her dispatcher and say that she picked him up, then has her take him to the Amtrak station to take the overnight to Dallas/Fort Worth. He didn't say anything else, and she didn't smell any alcohol off of him.

The surveillance cameras at the Peach Crease shows Terry talking to Claude and then him leaving later in fresh clothing. There's more footage of Terry at the Amtrak station, apparently making sure he was seen clearly by the cameras. Ralph and Yunis watch the footage, and Ralph figures that Terry is acting like he wants to be caught on tape. Yunis confirms there's no record of Terry buying a ticket, and Ralph wonders why Terry called a cab. He points out that everything Terry did after murdering Frankie was idiotic, and wonders what kind of criminal wants to get caught. Yunis suggests Terry wanted to be punished for what he did, but admits he doesn't buy it either. He asks if Ralph is going to cuff Terry at the game, and Ralph doesn't answer.

-----

Ralph watches Terry in the interrogation room through the one-way mirror. DA Kenneth Hayes comes in and tells Ralph that the DNA in the van matches Frankie and Terry has a rare blood type that was on the branch used to sodomize Frankie. Ralph wants Terry's DNA tying him to the murder, and Hayes and Ralph go in to meet with Terry. Terry refuses to talk without Howie present, and Kenneth asks him if he was out of town when Frankie was murdered. The suspect still refuses to talk, and Kenneth tells him that they can hold him for 48 hours without charging him and then they have to take him to the courthouse for arraignment.

Ralph suggests Terry help himself out by letting them take a DNA cheek swab. Terry still refuses to do anything without Howie present, and Ralph insists that he has a solid case. When Terry asks for his lawyer, Hayes and Ralph leave as Howie arrives. Howie goes with the two men, leaving Terry alone in the interrogation room.

Howie asks if it's a mistake or they've lost their minds, and Ralph insists that there no initial interview. The lawyer points out that Ralph arrested Terry in front of a hundred people without an initial interview or verifying his story, and Hayes says that the evidence they had was strong enough they didn't want to risk Terry running. Howie notes that they could have posted officers around the field and waited until the game was over, and asks Ralph why he did it. Ralph says that he had his officers arrest Terry because he couldn't have trust himself not to beat Terry. Ralph walks off and Hayes shows Howie the file on how Frankie was killed.

Glory drives home and Yunis shows her the warrant to search her home. She points out that there's nothing specific listed on the warrant, and Tamika says that it's at their discretion given the nature of the crime. The officers take her daughters' things away, and as Glory goes in, a man in a hoodie is among the bystanders, watching.

Howie, Hayes, and Ralph go back into the interrogation room and Howie tells them to lay out their case or he's going to the press and saying they ruined Terry's life without saying why. Hayes says that Terry's fingerprints were on Frankie, his bike, the branch, and the van. There were 70 prints in blood, several witnesses identified Terry, and the blood match. Terry says that it's a nightmare, and Hayes suggests that he end it by telling them why he did it. The suspect insists that he was in Cap City with two fellow teachers, at a conference for secondary school English teachers. Howie notes that Terry's alibi isn't convenient for Hayes, and Terry says that there were dozens of people who saw him. Howie warns that Ralph and Hayes are making a bad mistake by arresting Terry, but Hayes insists that there's no mistake and they'll have the DNA from the swabs to confirm Terry's guilt.

After four days have passed, Joy Peterson goes to the station and demands her son's body for burial. The officers lead Terry past, and Joy yells at him asking if he killed Frankie. Her other son Ollie holds her back. Terry is taken to prison and searched, and some of the prisoners recognize Terry as the child killer. Terry says nothing, and the guards lead him out.

After Frankie' service, the Peterson's hold a wake at their house. Ollie sits by himself while his parents Joy and Fred talk with the visitors.

A private detective working for Howie, Alec Pelley, calls the Babcock Hotel where Terry said he was staying and confirms Terry's alibi.

After processing, Terry refuses to go in a cell with the prisoners who recognized him earlier. The guard is unimpressed but his superior tells him to put Terry in a separate cell so they don't lose him. Once the guards leave, Terry moves out of sight of the other prisoners staring at him.

Hayes tells Ralph to question the two teachers Terry was with, and Ralph says that they've talked to one of them and he's confirmed everything Terry said. Ralph figures Howie already sent an investigator to the Babcock to get the security tape, and Hayes warns that what they have is inconclusive e.

At the Babcock security room, Alec goes over the security footage and spots Terry going into a gift shop. There's no surveillance camera in the shop, and the security chief says that there was a public-access camera crew covering the panel.

Joy, Fred, and Ollie clean up the food after the wake, and Joy looks at a photo of Frankie. She then takes Frankie's baseball bat and smashes the plates, screaming in fury and grief. Joy goes through the house, hitting everything in her path, while Fred and Ollie stay away from her. She finally drops the bat, sobbing, and collapses. She appears to go unconscious and Fred runs to the phone to call 911.

At 3 am, Glory wakes up and checks on her sleeping daughters. Jessa is sitting up on her bed, and Glory asks what the matter is. The girl is staring at her window, and yells that she will not when Glory interrupts her. Jessa tells Glory to tell ""him"" to get out of her room, and Glory says that no one is there and Jessa is dreaming. Her daughter says that ""he"" was saying bad things to her, and Maya comes in, hearing the noise. Glory assures her that her sister is having a bad dream and holds Jessa. Jessa insists that ""he"" was there and it wasn't a dream.

The next day, Alec calls Howie to say that he sent him a link, and tells him to look at it and tell Alec what he thinks. Howie looks at the video at the link and swears in astonishment. The video from the panel shows Terry asking a question, and Howie shows it to Hayes and Ralph. The time of the question is the same time that Frankie was murdered 70 miles away.

Later, Ralph tells Fred and Ollie that evidence clears Terry. Fred refuses to hear it, and Ralph sits with Ollie.

Hayes, Ralph, and Yunis discuss the case, and Hayes warns that juries rarely convict on fingerprint evidence. The witnesses won't stand up to cross-exam, and Hayes is starting to have his doubts about the DNA evidence. Ralph goes to the Babcock to find out for himself.

Howie and Glory meet Terry in prison and tells him that the charge was withdrawn. However, the lawyer warns that Terry will still be arraigned. However, Howie promises that by the time Terry reaches the courthouse, he'll make sure every reporter in the state has a copy of the video so Judge Landy won't deny Terry bail. Howie says that the video tape and witnesses clear Terry but he wants more physical forensic evidence from the Babcock proving Terry was there, even though it's unlikely given it was a hotel room. Terry suggests that there was something.

Ralph questions the bartender at the Babcock bar, but the man doesn't remember Terry drinking there. He goes over the security footage and sees Terry go into the gift shop, and talks to the owner. She was working during the conference and recognizes Terry. The owner points out an expensive photo book that Terry look at but didn't buy, and no one has touched it since Terry was there. Ralph buys the book and leaves with it, passing Alec. The two men know each other and casually greet the other. Alec knows about the photo book and Ralph admits that he has it, and Ralph admits that he hopes he doesn't find Terry's fingerprints on it.

Back at the station, Ralph lifts prints from the photo book and confirms they're Terry's. He and Yunis then shows them to Hayes at the DA's home and notes that they confirm Terry was at the gift shop. Hayes doesn't believe Terry was in two places at once, and Ralph admits that he had to log them into evidence. The DA says that Ralph sabotaged their own case, and Ralph tells him that if Terry is innocent then they're not done. He asks Hayes how badly he wants to win, and Hayes asks him how badly he wants to lose.

The next day, Ralph and Jeannie go to Derek's grave and wish him a happy birthday. Ralph says that he would do anything, and Jeannie understands that he can't get justice for Derek. His wife asks him if he really thinks Terry killed Frankie. Ralph admits that he doesn't know.

Back in his office, Ralph goes over the footage of Terry at the Amtrak station and compares it to the video from the panel. When the Terry at the station puts his hand on a wall, Ralph calls Tamika in. They realize that the Terry at station is giving them the finger,

Glory lays out the suit that Terry will wear to court.

The guard refuses to remove Terry's manacles, and Ralph admits that he's there on his own. He tells Terry that the van with the New York plates is still bothering him, and Terry tells him that the last time he was In New York was 16 years ago for his honeymoon. Ralph explains that they back-checked Terry's movements over the last six months and couldn't find anything but a family vacation to Dayton that the Maitlands flew to and from.

The detective says that he's baffled by the conflicting evidence, and says that he has credible witnesses who saw Terry covered in Frankie's blood. Ralph figures that no one can explain it, and asks Terry if he had any physical or verbal contact with Frankie on the day of the murder. Terry says he didn't, and says that he didn't abduct or murder Frankie when Ralph asks. Ralph tells him that they're done for the night, and Terry says that when Ralph arrested him at the game, he asked him if he ever touched Derek. He tells Ralph that Derek was the best drag bunter he ever had, and had a lot of guts. The kids called Derek ""The Whiffer"", and Terry told them to stop. Terry taught him how to bunt and Derek never flinched. The other kids started calling Derek ""Push It', and Terry asks if Ralph noticed how confident his son was. Terry admits that he hoped he did touch Derek when he taught him the bunt. With that, Terry goes back to his cell.

The next day, mortician Craig Kohara shows Fred and Ollie two coffins, for Frankie and Joy. Kohara offers them a discount since they're buying two coffins.

Terry showers at the prison.

At the courthouse, a crowd gathers for Terry's high-profile quest.

Howie drives Glory to the courthouse.

A reporter questions Hayes and notes that he could be focusing so much on Terry that he's letting other suspects slip past. Hayes insists that Terry is guilty, and the reporter asks if he's running for governor. The DA insists that he only cares about bringing justice to Frankie's killer.

The prison guards bring Terry to the courthouse and lead him out. Many of the spectators boo, and Ralph takes Terry in as Howie and Glory arrive. A masked Ollie steps out, shoots two of the guards and hits Tamika in the leg, and Ralph shoots back, killing him in self-defense. Ollie's last shot hits Terry in the neck, and Ralph goes over and confirms Ollie is dead. Glory goes to Terry, who is bleeding out, and Howie yells for 911. Ralph comes over and checks Terry's wound, and has Glory put pressure on it. Terry whispers to Ralph that he didn't do it and it wasn't him, and a doctor arrives. Terry dies despite her efforts, and the man in the hoodie watches as the rest of the crowd scatters. After a moment, he walks away.

Later in the hospital, a doctor--Myron Lazar-- checks Ralph. Ralph says that he killed a boy, and the doctor makes sure Ralph is fine. Myron tells him to concentrate on his breathing and get it down, draws the curtain, turns off the lights, and leaves.

The police question Glory.

Jack Hoskins is out hunting when he gets a text saying he's needed back ASAP. Cursing, Jack loads up his truck and drives off.

Yunis visits Ralph, who is at home sitting in front of the fireplace. Ralph confirms that he's on administrative leave for two weeks and they've assigned him a trauma therapist. Yunis says that Tamika is laid up with a shattered bone from the shooting and worried about her unborn child, and Ralph wonders why he didn't keep her back. He wonders why he thought arresting Terry in front of spectators was the way to go, and Yunis tells him that he had his reasons. The GBI officer tells Ralph that they found out a boy had been stealing cars and ditching him, and the van was the first vehicle he took. The boy drove it from New York to Ohio, and Ralph remembers saying that the Maitlands vacationed in Ohio. All the boy remembers is that he left the van at a shopping mall parking lot.

At the Peach Crease, Jack tells a man at the bar, Ed Polk, about the vacation he gets and they called him back early. Polk doesn't care and Jack throws his drink on him. When Polk man comes at him, the drunken Jack kicks him in the kneecap, wedgies him, and punches him to the floor. The bouncers get Jack out, and the bartender buys Ed a drink.

Glory sits on her porch, and hears Jessa and Maya yelling at each other. Their mother goes to Jessa's bedroom and Jessa says that ""the man"" was there and then left. Glory calms Jessa down and gets her back into bed.

Ralph is up smoking, and Jeannie finds him. She remembers that it's been five years since he smoked, and Ralph describes a piece of blue paper he saw beneath the van's windshield wiper. Ralph says that he's going to go in the next day to check it out, and Jeannie reminds him that he's on leave and supposed to see a therapist. She asks him to lie next to him in bed, and Ralph lights up another cigarette.

The next day, Fred sits in his otherwise-empty house. He finally makes a rope out of torn sheets, ties one end to the bed, puts the other end around his noose, and tries to hang himself. A woman is jogging by and sees the bedroom window shatter as Fred kicks it in his death throes, and she yells for help. Down the street, the man in the hoodie watches and then leaves.

Ralph goes to the station and tells the clerk Mildred that he needs the keys to the evidence room. She lets him take them, and Ralph goes in and takes a photo of the blue paper from the van. When Ralph goes out, he sees Jack, who says that they called him back in after Ralph shot Ollie. Hayes calls Ralph to his office and says that at least one of them came out a hero. He then tells Ralph that he's not running for reelection after Terry's death, and he needs to move on. Hayes then tells Ralph that the DNA in the saliva on Frankie's body is a match to Terry's. Ralph wonders what different it makes, and Hayes points out that when Gloria sues them for negligence, it might keep her reward down. The detective wonders if Glory deserves every penny, and Hayes insists that they both thought they were prosecuting the right guy. As Ralph starts to go, Hayes talks about how strange things have happened throughout history. The DA admits that there are unanswered questions, and they have to learn to live with it and move on. Ralph says that it's hard for him and leaves.

That night, Ralph shows Jeannie the flyer and asks her what comes first thing to her head. He figures someone saw it, tore it off but left a corner, and got into the van. Jeannie uses Google to find the restaurant the logo belongs to, between New York and Ohio, and finds a Big Daddy's Hangry-Q in Dayton.

Glory finds Jessa sitting on her bed, and the girl says that she dreamed about the man again. There's a puddle of goo on Jessa's floor, and Glory goes to get Jessa some water.

Ralph and Jeannie visit Tamika in the hospital after she delivers her baby. Jack is sitting in the room, and Tamika's husband and mother are there. Tamika says that Yunis updated her on the case. Ralph finds Yunis looking at Fred, who survived his hanging but is in a coma after his brain lost oxygen for ten minutes. The agent says that the Peterson family is gone, and Ralph leaves with Yunis and says that he needs to know if the boy dumped the fan near the Hangry-Q. Yunis advises him to take some time for himself, and Ralph admits that he hasn't seen his therapist yet. He figures that if the boy dropped the van is Dayton when the Maitlands were there, they want to know if the killer crossed paths with the family. Yunis confirms that the boy is in foster care, and agrees to get Ralph with him if Ralph sees the therapist.

Later, Ralph meets with the therapist and refuses to discuss Derek. The detective says that he's sorrowful and angry, and isn't getting much sleep. The therapist asks him about his dreams, and Ralph says that he's having weird ones. He describes his dreams of what happened when Terry was killed, and claims that no details stuck with him. The therapist tells Ralph that it's good Ralph came in so soon, but warns that the injuries to Ralph's psyche could take weeks to manifest. Ralph suggests that he's fine even though he doesn't feel fine, and being there feels like a punishment. The therapist tells Ralph that he can walk out and he won't stop him, and Ralph tells him that when anyone says that they're there to help, things get worse for him.

Later, Yunis takes Ralph to the boy, Merlin, at the foster home. Ralph asks him if remembers the Hangry-Q in Dayton and when Merlin left the van off. Merlin says he never saw the restaurant before, but he remembers the parking lot. The boy remembers that it was ""three cars ago"", and Ralph tries to narrow it down to a date. Merlin finally remembers a woman with a smudge of ash on her head. Other people had it, and Ralph figures that it was Ash Wednesday. As they leave, Ralph confirms the date was March 6 and the Maitlands were in Dayton during that day even though they flew both ways.

Back home, Ralph approaches Glory at her house and says that he needs to talk to her. She refuses at first, and he suggests that if Terry didn't do it, someone deliberately framed him and it might happen again. Glory asks Ralph how she's supposed to explain to her daughters while she no longer has friends, and the thing will go with them no matter where they move. Ralph says that the only way Glory is going to get her life back is to clear Terry's name, and they need to find the real killer.

After a moment, Glory closes the door in Ralph's face. She sees Maya on the upstairs steps and sits down next to her, and holds her tight.

The next morning, Howie finds Ralph working on his lawn. The lawyer knows from Glory that Ralph visited her. Howie warns that talking to Glory won't stop him from filing a lawsuit, and Ralph tells him that he doesn't care about the lawsuit. The lawyers set up a meeting between Ralph and Glory at Glory's house with Alec looking on, and Ralph says the van used in Frankie's murder was dumped in Dayton when the Maitlands were there.

Glory figures Ralph is still trying to pin the murder on Terry and tells him to get out, but Ralph believes that Terry never saw the van as he claimed. He says that it's all strange and the van seemed to follow the Maitlands home. Ralph asks why the Maitlands went to Dayton, and Glory explains that Terry's father is at a senior center in Dayton, has dementia, and tends to be violent. She and the girls stayed in the hotel or went to a movie the entire time Terry was at the senior center. When Ralph asks about the Hangry-Q, Glory tells Howie that she wants the interview over. Ralph asks if anything out of the ordinary happened, and Glory insists that nothing happened.

Maya is listening from the stairs and says that Terry got a cut. When Ralph goes out to join them, Maya asks him if he's the man who killed her father. Ralph says that he didn't but he made some terrible mistakes, then asks Maya to tell him about the cut. She says that he saw it visiting his father, and she remembers it because Terry said he got it from a nurse but the nurse was a man. Terry said that he bumped into the nurse when he slipped on a wet floor, and when he got up he saw he had a cut on his wrist. Maya then reminds Glory that there was a ""pig restaurant"" near their hotel, even though they never went there. Glory doesn't remember, and she says that the cut was nothing and goes upstairs with Maya.

A teenager, Ethan Elman, drives his truck out to a barn that his family owns. He finds a pile of abandoned clothing on a hay bale, and sees that it's covered in goo. There's a horse-head belt buckle in the pants, and police sirens sound in the distance. Ethan looks nervously around, wondering if the clothing's owner is still there."

The GBI agent and his men bag the discarded goo-covered clothing.

At the cemetery, Ralph cleans up Derek's gravestone and wishes he could tell his dead son about the last week. Two gravediggers laugh as they walk by, and Ralph walks over to the Peterson graves they were digging. The detective looks at the family's four graves.

At the station, the officers welcome back Tamika, who is on crutches after her leg was broken by Ollie's shot. Jack is surprised to see her there, and Tamika says that she's there to pick up some things. Her superior says that he's going out to the barn because the State police found clothes that they think belong to Terry. Jack figures everything will be wrapped up by the time he gets there.

Ralph is going over his files when Jeannie comes in. Her husband says that he found out which senior center Terry's father was at, and that the father was arrested for aggravated assault in 1985. Jeannie reminds Ralph that he's on leave because of post-shooting protocol and suggests he take the time off. Ralph asks how her day was, and they both chuckle.

At the Peach Crease, Jack is drunkenly telling a stripper to dance to humpback whale music. He insults the dancer and she storms off. Claude asks Jack if he's working, and Jack says that he's taking his time getting there. When Jack tries to provoke Claude, Claude doesn't rise to the bait. Jack tosses money on the stage and leaves.

A bus arrives at the prison and the guards take a new inmate, to his cell. The man glances briefly at another prisoner as he goes past his cell.

Jack arrives at the barn that night and finds the place closed up. He urinates and then goes in, using his flashlight to see. Someone moves in the darkness, and Jack jumps and calls out that he's a police officer. Something stings Jack in the back of his neck and he curses.

Ralph watches news footage of Terry arriving at the courthouse, and remembers hooting ollie.

Jack finds a medical cabinet and bandages his neck. When he touches the reddish skin, he moans in pain.

The next day, Yunis meets Ralph at a diner and shots him photos of the clothing. The horsehead buckle is the same one they saw on Terry in the surveillance tape, and Terry's fingerprints were on it. Some of the fingerprints were solid, while the weaker prints were like an 80 or 90 year old. Yunis confirms that they all belonged to the same person, but the forensic account couldn't account for the discrepancy. The fingerprints matched the ones in the van,, but there was one set that the techs thought was too degraded to check.

Ralph wonders what's going on, and Yunis says that they first thought the substance on the clothing was semen. However, the liquid was in other parts of the barn, and nobody has been able to identify it. Ralph thinks they should let Howie and Alec know what's going and see if they have any ideas.

In prison, the newcomer watches the prisoner. The prisoner takes a lens out of his eyeglasses.

The school principal, Theresa Ogletree, calls Glory in and the other children and their parents have a growing hostility toward Jessa and Maya. Theresa says that she's going to have to release Glory's daughters. She offers to help Glory with home schooling, and says that it's outrageous when children have to pay for the sins of their parents. Glory insists that Terry was innocent and leaves.

Ralph and Yunis meet with Howie and Alec, and Ralph insists that they're just trying to get to the bottom of what happens. Ralph says that he's trying to get justice for Terry and Frankie, and isn't going to apologize for fucking up. Howie insists someone else had to drive the van, and Ralph wants to find the real killer because no one else will go through it and nothing less will do. Alec figures someone has to retrace Terry's steps to Dayton, and Howie suggests they send Holly Gibney. Ralph has heard of Holly and figures that she's... unique.

Holly is in her apartment identifying cars as they drive by, going by their engine sounds. Alec calls and asks her to retrace Terry' movements in Dayton. Holly wants to meet with Ralph in person but refuses to fly there because she's afraid of flying. She goes to the bar below her apartment and complains that one man is sitting in her seat. He irritably moves and Holly sits down, continuing her conversation with Alec on the phone. Alec agrees that she doesn't have to fly, and Holly hangs up and orders a drink.

The next day, Ralph meets with his therapist, Herb, and figures that Herb is outwaiting him so he'll go past his rehearsed answers. Ralph says that he's been gardening since their last meeting, and things are good with Jeannie. He talks about how things were rough when they lost Derek. Herb offers his condolences, and Ralph tells him that they're good. The therapist asks how things were for Ralph when they got rough, and Ralph remembers drinking and getting involved in bar fights. He then tells Herb that they should just focus on the courthouse shooting.

Jessa sits outside her house and stares off into the night.

Later, Alec takes Ralph to meet with Holly at a bar and they watch a baseball game on the TV. Holly pieces together the date and stats of a game Alec saw as a child going just by the date, Ralph gives her all of the information on Terry's vacation, and says that she needs to find out who was working in the center wing the days that Terry visited. Holly quotes Ralph her fee, assuring him that he'll get back anything she doesn't spend, and asks for half up front. Alec agrees and Holly offers a toast in Lithuanian.

In prison, the prisoner gets a letter with a drawing of a bloody child's face. The guard says that it must have slipped through the screening. Once he leaves, the child-killer sharpens the glass lens on the edge of his bunk.

Holly suggests that Terry had a doppelganger, a mythical creature that is a non-biological double of someone. She says that they're looking for a flesh-and-blood biped, and Ralph notes that she said ""if"" it's a myth. He admits that he has no tolerance for the unexplainable, and Holly says she's a savant. Her parents had her tested and studied by psychiatrists when her behavior first manifested. None of them could account for it, and Ralph is shocked her parents let them study her. Holly says that they were scared and though the psychiatrists could ""cure"" her of being herself. She says that she's good and goes upstairs to her apartment, and thanks Ralph for drinking to make her feel comfortable as she goes. She goes up to the stairs, gasping for breath. A man comes out and looks at her, and Holly calms down and continues to her apartment.

The newcomer pulls a razor from where it's buried in beneath the skin of his leg.

The child-killer lies on his bunk and looks thoughtfully at the sharpened lens.

Grace wakes up to find Jessa sitting by her bed. She says that her mother has to call Ralph because she has something to tell him. When Glory asks what it is, Jessa says that ""the man"" told her to only tell Ralph, and refuses to answer Glory's questions.

Later, Ralph takes Jeanie to the Maitland house. Howie is there with Glory, and Glory explains that Jessa thinks she has to tell Ralph something about her dream. She tells Ralph that he should ease Jessa's mind, and Ralph agrees. They go in and Jessa insists that it wasn't a dream. Glory and Maya point out that a man couldn't have gotten upstairs, and Glory interrupts when Ralph ask why Jessa though it was a dream. Jessa says that the man said he wouldn't come back if she gave Ralph the message, and tells him that the man said that Ralph should stop. If Ralph didn't stop, something bad would happen. When Ralph asks for details, Glory takes Jessa to her room and curses Ralph for not helping.

Jeannie talks to Glory privately, and Howie asks how Ralph found Holly. The lawyer admits that Holly is a loony but good at what she does.

Glory and Jeannie talk in the kitchen, and Jeannie says that Derek used to have nightmares and telling him he had bad dreams just agitated him. They took Derek's nightmares seriously and eventually he either got over his dreams or got bored with them questioning him. Jeanie advises Glory to let Ralph keep asking Jessa about her dream. Glory refuses, but says that Jeannie can talk to Jessa.

Jeannie talks to Jessa, who says that she's seen the man four times. The first time h looked like Terry, and she didn't mention it to Glory. Jessa explains that the man was mean and tried to make her cry. The second time his face was blurry like someone tried to erase it. The man said more mean stuff, and the last time the man wasn't blurry and was muscular with tattoos. Jessa says that she's tired and doesn't want to talk about it. Ralph is listening and tells Jessa to tell the man to give him the message. Jessa says that Ralph doesn't want the man to do it, and the man wants Ralph to be scared rather than her.

Holly goes to the hotel room where Glory and her daughter stayed, and recreates what happened in her mind. She then goes to the parking lot of the Hangry-Q where Merlin abandoned the van, notices a surveillance camera, and studies it. The head of mall security, Andy Katcavage, pulls up and says that he's shorthanded so he's working. Holly tells him that she's looking for the footage from six weeks ago, and Andy says that they erase them once a week. She explains that she's trying to find the man who took the van, and explains that he murdered a child. Holly says that she's a PI, and Andy exchanges business cards with her. He tells her to contact him if she needs help and she leaves.

Jack is at the Peach Crease, drinking, and the back of his neck is swollen. He falls off his stool, drunk, and when one man tries to help him up Jack screams in pain. Jack says that he'll do anything to make the pain stop, and it does.

Jeannie goes to the Maitland home and asks Glory how she and Jessa are doing. Glory confirms that Jessa slept through the night, and Jeannie assures her she just wanted to check on the family. Glory says that Maya saw a horror movie about leprechauns and Terry told her that leprechauns aren't allowed to leave Ireland. Maya accepted that, and Glory breaks into tears at the thought of Terry. She asks Jeannie how she lives with Derek's death, and Jeannie says that it's impossible.

Holly goes to the senior center and the receptionist, Angela, refuses to let her talk with Peter Maitland. She says that Peter wouldn't recognize Holly and he's been going downhill in the last month or so ago. Holly asks if something happened then, and Angela figures that Holly is a reporter like the ones who showed up a month ago when the police were there and orders her out. The receptionist isn't aware that Terry is dead, and calls a security guard. Holly leaves on her own and calls Ralph, and explains what happened. The police wanted to talk to Peter as part of the investigation, and she's going to look into it. Holly apologizes for calling prematurely but says that sometimes she likes to hear the voice of someone on her side.

That night at her apartment, Holly checks the newspaper from a month ago and finds an article about two young missing sisters. The killer is described as a ""monster"".

After lights out, a guard unlocks the newcomer's cell door. The newcomer goes to the child-killer's cell, and the killer hears him coming, takes out the lens, and puts his back to the wall. The newcomer comes in and the killer tells him he doesn't need to do it. The newcomer comes at him, the killer cuts his throat with the sharpened lens and collapses. Startled, the newcomer leaves.

Jack sits in his apartment, saying that he'll do whatever the creature needs him to do."

Holly calls Ralph and says that there were two similar murders of twin sisters, and the suspect killed himself in prison. Heath worked at the senior center where Terry's father Peter stayed, and the man was one of Heath's charges. Holly warns that she probably won't get back into the building after what happened the day before, and Ralph goes down his living room and looks at the articles Holly emailed him.

Outside the senior center, Holly waits for Angela to leave. Once she does, Holly follows her home. When Angela gets out of her car and walks to her apartment, Holly follows her and Angela sprays pepper spray in her face. Holly admits that she followed Angela from worker, and insists that she's a PI rather than a reporter. She directs Angela to her ID, and once she checks it Angela takes Holly inside and gives her a wet cloth.

Holly notes that the papers said Heath claimed he was on vacation the time of the murders, and Angela says that he told her he was going to his mother's place. She confirms that he came back to check on his charges from time to time, and doesn't figure Heath killed the girls. Holly says that there have been lots of cases of killers whose close ones never suspected them, and Angela says that when she did see ""Heath"" back at the senior center, he didn't say anything even though he's usually chatty. The PI writes down the date Angela saw ""Heath"", and Angela tells her that one of the janitors said he saw ""Heath"" come out of Peter's suite. The janitor saw ""Heath"" bump into Terry and scraped Terry's hand, drawing blood.

Angela notes that there were other witnesses who said that they saw Heath with his mother at the time of the murders, Heath's mother Ernestine said Heath never left her side the whole week. The police were interested in Peter after the girls' murders, and Angela tells Holly that she'd have to talk to them about why they were interested in Peter.

Jack goes hunting and kills a deer.

Glory interviews a home-school tutor, Florida, for her daughters. She that the envelopes with all of Florida's references are from different states but all postmarked Atlanta, she writes down an equation and asks Florida to solve it. Florida can't, and Glory figures that she's a tabloid reporter undercover. Florida says that she's trying to write a sympathetic article, and Glory orders her out. She throws Florida's purse out on the sidewalk and a recorder falls out of it. Florida picks up her things and drives off.

Jack loads the dead deer into the forest from his truck and winces at the painful spot on the back of his neck. He then gets into his truck and drives off.

Glory goes to a restaurant to eat with Howard, and people look at her and mutter Terry's name. One man tells Glory that she has a lot of brass showing her face in public, saying that might someone might want to even the score against her daughters. Howard tells the man to stop and the two of them start fighting. The owner tosses the man out, and Glory sits in silence.

Holly calls Ralph and tells her what she found out from Angela, and Ralph knows about ""Heath"" scratching Terry from what the Maitlands said afterward. Holly notes the discrepancy of ""Heath"" being there the day after the girls were found day. Ralph calls Yunis and says that he needs to take a look at the footage of Terry from the day of the murder. Yunis warns that it's a tricky request, and Ralph says that he figures something on one of the tapes is a game changer.

Holly pays a nurse to get her in the back entrance of the senior center.

Ralph goes over the tapes from the strip club with Yunis.

Holly goes to Peter's suite and discovers that Alzheimer's has scrambled his memories. He rambles on and Holly asks him if Heath said anything. Peter then says that it wasn't Heath, and figures that ""he"" fooled all of them.

Ralph goes over the tape and finally locates a shot of ""Terry"" scratching Claude's hand.

Jack goes to a hardware store and buys lamps of all sizes along with gas containers.

Holly meets with Andy and notes that Heath killed the two girls when Andy was still working homicide. She figures there's a connection between Heath and Terry, and Andy admits that he can talk to some people... if Holly goes out to dinner with him. Holly agrees to dinner, and Andy tells her that he has the strength of ten because his heart is pure. Amused at his joke, Holly chuckles.

Jack drives the lamps and gas containers out to the forest and places them near the dead and rotting deer.

Holly and Andy go to a restaurant for dinner and they talk about how Holly was raised in Pennsylvania. She says that she went to Chicago to start over because her mother died, and her mother was taking care of her. Holly brings up the subject of Peter, and Andy tells her that the police investigated every suite that Heath might have entered. A day later they got a DNA match on one of the girls. The police thought it might belong to Heath's younger brother Aaron, but the DNA didn't match and Aaron OD'd later. They found plenty of DNA evidence and one girl's bloody clothing, all connecting Heath to the murders.

Andy notes that Ernestine, Aaron, the girls, her mother, and their grandfather, all died. He tries or order but Holly just wants a drink and Andy has the same.

At the Peach Crease, Ralph comes over and asks Claude how he's doing. The detective says that he's not there to jack Claude up, and asks if Claude remembers ""Terry"" scratching him on the wrist when he came in the night of the boy's murder. Claude doesn't remember anything new from that night, and Ralph leaves.

Andy walks Holly back to her apartment, and she admits she has no idea how tall she is even though she can calculate anyone else's height. He invites her to have a nightcap at the bar beneath, and Holly says that she can't because she has to work. She impulsively kisses Andy and walks inside, goes to the bar, and looks over her notes. She tells the bartender what happened and the bartender wonders who gave the ""murder virus"" to Heath.

Holly gets a coffee to go, visits Angela, and asks if Heath took any trips out-of-state in the last year. Angela remembers that Heath went to New York City but doesn't remember where he went. She tells Holly that Heath sent her a postcard and shows it to Holly. Holly takes photos of it and gives it back to Angela, then back at her apartment does a Google search of crimes in NYC just before Heath visited. She finds a report of a midtown bartender, Maria Ceneles, arrested because of a child slaying. On the postcard Heath says that he met a girl.

The next morning, Holly calls Ralph and says that she has to go to NYC to investigate a child killer who crossed paths with Heath at the hotel he was staying at where she worked. Maria is alive on Riker's Island, awaiting trial, and the lawyer has always gotten permission for Holly to meet with Maria. Ralph agrees to talk to Howard who is covering expenses.

At the station, Tamika hands out invitations to her newborn's christening. Jack is staring at a blank arrest report. Tamika hobbles into Jack's office and asks if he's mad at her because he didn't look her way when she was talking about the christening. She points out that Jack hasn't done anything, and Jack promises that he'll be at the party.

Holly takes a taxi to Riker's and remembers being MRI'd as a child, and her mother being there to comfort her and putting a small fetish doll in her hand. The taxi arrives and Holly stays in the back, remembering, as long as she can. She then takes the bus to Rikers.

-----

After breakfast, Heath and Maria have sex.

-----

Holly explains that Heath was arrested for torturing and murdering two girls in Ohio a month ago, and says that he was innocent like Maria was.

Maria says that they wouldn't let her go to her father's funeral and insists that she was innocent, and Holly tells Maria that she knows. Maria realizes who framed her, but says that no one can help her because what the killer does can never be undone. Later, Holly discovers that one of the women in the reception area overheard her and left Holly a piece of paper with an address.

In Howard's office, Merlin meets with Ralph and says that he left the van in the parking lot. He didn't tell Ralph about the man who took it because Merlin was scared of the man.

-----

The man in the hoodie stares at Merlin from across the lot and says nothing.

-----

Ralph asks Merlin to try and draw the man he saw, and Merlin starts sketching.

Holly goes to the address and meets with the visitor, Idilys Castro, who says that she overheard what Maria told Holly. She asks if Holly believes in one devil or many, and explains that in Cuba she was told that El Coco would come for her and ate her if she misbehaved. Her grandmother was told the same when she was a child, and the legend of El Coco goes back many generations. A Russian woman once told Idilys that El Coco was Baba Yaga, the boogeyman, Idilys warns that El Coco can look like a person if it wants. She says that the creature is known as the Grief Eater because it stays behind and feeds on the pain and anguish of the families of victim and framed killer.

Merlin finishes his sketch and shows it to Ralph. The man's face is crude and unfinished.

Back in her hotel room, Holly sits in her bathtub, drinks, and looks up El Coco on the Internet. There are pictures of the inhuman monster in cultures and legends across history, always feeding on children. After a moment, Holly lays back and submerges her head beneath the water."

Three Days Earlier

Tracy sits in his home, with ""Child Killer"" scrawled on the walls outside, and smokes. He then sweeps up the dust, takes out his military uniform, and lays it on a bed.

In the woods, Jack pulls the dead deer over to the pile of lamps and gas containers that he's made. He argues with his unseen controller, insisting that one of the lamps is perfectly good, and asks why it doesn't like it. There's no answer, and Jack angrily asks what's happening to him. He says that he's ready to die, and collapses to the ground in agony.

At the clinic where she works, Jeannie calls Anjanue in to her office. She notices a man in a hoodie sitting in the waiting room as she goes inside.

Ralph tells Yunis, Howard, and Alex what Holly found out in NYC. She's learned that Maria's story is pretty much the same as Heath's, and admits Holly hasn't found out anything except there are other child-killers in the U.S. Holly is heading back to Dayton, and Ralph suggests that she's coming back because she's waiting for everything to gel. He suggests that they have faith in Holly's investigation and see where she takes them next.

Jeannie talks to Anjanue and assures her that she's doing everything she should be doing to stay clean and then the judge will downgrade her sentence. Anjanue says that she didn't go to her parenting workshop because her baby got sick, and the instructor didn't respond to Anjanue's texts. As Jeannie escorts Anjanue out and calls in her next client, she sees that the man in the hoodie is still in the waiting room.

Jack watches Howard's office building.

Ralph, Howard, and the others come out and Howard says that they haven't found out anything about the goo in the barn.

Jeannie tells everyone that they can't wear hoodies over their heads. The one man doesn't remove his hoodie or move, and Jeannie goes over to him. She prods him in the shoulder, and his head falls back since he's asleep.

At home, Ralph reviews an article on Maria's arrest and the boy Luis that she killed. Jeannie comes in and she talks about how her day was weird. She talks about the man in the hoodie at the clinic and suggests that they get takeout because she doesn't want to cook. Distracted, Ralph agrees, and Jeannie goes to lie down for a bit. When the food arrives, Ralph goes to the bedroom to wake Jeannie up. She doesn't wake up and Ralph sits down in a chair next to the bed.

-----

In the past, Ralph sits in the bedroom drinking. Jeannie refuses to get out of bed, still mourning their dead son Derek. When he says to pull herself together, Jeannie kicks Ralph away and points out that he's at home when he should be at work. Ralph says that Derek son is gone, and Jeannie says that Derek was gone and he was hers and Ralph wasn't there. She tells Ralph to go.

-----

At the bar beneath her apartment, Holly sits and drinks. She talks to Skye about the boogeyman in Skye's childhood, and Skye says that it was Baboulas. Holly says the words ""Grief Eater"" and asks Skye what's the first thing that comes to mind when she hears them, and Skye finally says ""Tear Drinker"". When Holly considers places a Tear Drinker would go, she finally comes up with the idea of a cemetery. Skye wonders if they're just goofing around discussing a Tear Drinker, and Holly offers her $200 to drive her around.

At the Peach Crease, Claude sits at the bar and remembers the night ""Terry"" came in. He looks briefly at the hand that ""Terry"" scratched.

Jeannie goes to the kitchen to the water and hears someone moving in the house. She assumes that it's Ralph, but no one responds to her calls. A figure in a hoodie steps out and Jeannie drops her water glass in shock. The figure commands Jeannie to sit and she does so, and then says to tell Ralph to stop or she and Ralph will both die.

The next morning, Ralph wakes up in his bed and gets up. He finds the broken water glass on the dining room floor and drops of the Outsider's silvery blood. Jeanie is lying on her bed, asleep, and Ralph discovers her feet are cut from the broken glass. Jeannie jerks awake, crying, and Ralph goes to get something for her feet. She doesn't remember what happened, and tells Ralph he should drop the investigation. Jeannie feels that if he doesn't, something bad will happen, and Ralph tells her that something bad has already happened and he's trying to get to the bottom of it.

Holly drives to Hofstadter house and takes a photo of the outside wall with ""Child-Killer"" scrawled on it. She finds the place boarded up and goes inside, taking photos of everything and finds Tracy's closet.

Outside, Jeannie tells Ralph that someone was in the house and spoke to her, telling her to tell Ralph to stop investigating or they'll die. Ralph figures that she had a dream, and insists that no one will die. He figures that Jeannie overheard Jessie say the same thing, and Frankie's death has stirred up their memories of Derek. Jeannie doesn't believe it, and Ralph reminds her that she used to sleepwalk when the doctors put her on anti-depressants. She still sleepwalks, and Ralph figures that she's looking for Derek. Ralph swears to her that she had a vivid nightmare.

Holly has Skye drive her to the cemetery nearest the Hofstadter house and she finds a grave to the two dead sisters. Their mother's grave is nearby, and Holly figures that the Outsider take the entire family eventually. Holly takes photos of the nearby houses, and Skye comes over. The PI says that ""he"" was there, and all he had to do was close his eyes and inhale the grief. Holly goes back to the car and Skye follows her.

Jeannie sits at the kitchen table and draws the figure's face as best she can recall.

Holly has Skye drive her to the cemetery where the Hofstadters are buried, and sees a nearby abandoned factory. She takes photos of it and sends all of her photos to Ralph. Holly then calls him and asks him to take some photos around where Terry is buried. All she will say as explanation is that it might be important, but Ralph demands something to give the others. Holly tells him to humor her and hangs up, then notices a man kneeling next to Heath's grave. She takes a photo of him and goes over, offering her condolences.

The PI claims that someone asked her to come there and offer his respects, and asks what Heath's relationship was to the man. The man--Tracy--says that ""he"" fucked over Heath good and fucked him over as well. Tracy walks off, ignoring Holly's questions.

Jeannie has Ralph drop her off at an Urgent-Care, and Ralph says that he'll be there for her outside if she needs him. He then explains that Holly wants him to go to the cemetery to take photos of where Terry is buried, and doesn't know why. Ralph admits that he's going to do it, and Jeannie tells him to tell Glory. When her husband hesitates, Jeannie says that she'll call Glory later, gives him the sketch she made of the figure, and goes inside. Ralph looks at the facial features of the deformed figure as Jeannie drew him, then calls Yunis and asks him to check Claude's fingerprints against everything they have on Terry's homicide. He also asks Yunis to send him a mugshot of Claude and drives off.

Later, Yunis meets with Ralph. As they drive out to the cemetery, Yunis says that Claude's fingerprints didn't match anything at the scene. He asks Ralph what it was all about, and Ralph shows him Jeannie's drawing. He insists that Jeannie had a bad dream, and Yunis talks about how his great-grandmother had a dream of how she had a dream about one of her sons dying in the war before she got the official news. Yunis insists that dreams are messages.

The men arrive at the cemetery and find Glory and Jeannie already there. Glory complains that the temporary stone isn't there yet for Terry, and Ralph asks her if she minds if he takes some photos. She agrees and Ralph takes photos of the area. Yunis points out the barn where they found the clothes.

At Tamika's christening party for her baby, Jack arrives. Ralph and Jeannie are there, and Ralph goes over to Jack, who is drinking ginger ale and says that he's taking a break. When Ralph asks Jack if he saw anything at the barn that the state police might have missed, Jack angrily tells Ralph that he's not on the job. Tamika comes in with her baby, Jerome, and Jack declines to hold the baby, claiming he's coming down with something. He walks out and Tamika gives Jerome to Ralph to hold, then goes after Jack. Tamika confronts Jack and asks what's going on with him, and complains about his attitude the last few days. Jack says that he's going through a patch, and he wouldn't hold Jerome because he doesn't want anything to happen to him. He refuses to explain further, and tells Tamika to back off for her own sake.

That night, Holly calls Ralph and tells him that he's looking for hiding places for something. She says that Terry and Heath never went near the children they were accused of murdering. Holly also isn't surprised that the barn was close to Terry's grave. She finally tells Ralph that it's better if she explains in person, and Ralph tells her that she has to tell everyone involved by coming to Cherokee City.

That night in her apartment bed room, Holly is in the bed and watching a horror movie. Andy calls from the bar downstairs and invites her to join him. Holly invites him up to her room where there's a mini-bar, and when he comes up, she tells him how she snuck into Heath's house. She notes that the mattress was gone but someone came in and put clean sheets on the box springs. Holly explains that two daughters hired her to investigate their mother's strangulation death, after all of her things were stolen. She figures the killer was someone who knew the victim and displayed gestures of remorse, and the bed-maker was involved in the twin sisters' murders.

Andy pulls Holly over, and Holly says that she has a big meeting and she's nervous. He offers to go, and Holly suggests that they lay down for a little bit.

As Tamika lies in her bed, she hears someone moving in the house. She gets up, draws her gun, and goes to investigate. She finds the figure standing over Jerome's crib, and watches as the intruder picks up the baby. The baby cries and the figure walks off... and Tamika wakes up from her dream. She discovers that Jerome isn't in his crib, and runs outside to find her husband Roger sitting on the porch swing, holding their son.

Holly gently kisses a sleeping Andy and then leaves for Cherokee City.

Jack goes to Ralph's house and apologizes for snapping at him the day before. He says that he's been having personal problems, including drinking, Jack offers to take up some of the slack with everyone's workload and show Ralph what an asset he can be. Ralph points out that the Maitland cases are closed, and Jack asks for an opportunity to help. After a moment, Ralph asks Jack about the barn.

Andy wakes up and sees a note that Holly left behind for him.

Tracy sits in his running car and takes a revolver out of the glove compartment. He gets out of his car, approaches a nearby truck that he's been watching, grabs the driver, and shoves him to the ground, gun held at his head. As Tracy realizes that he3 has the wrong target, the driver asks what he wants.

Holly is driving and comes to a traffic jam caused by the police ahead. A train is crossing the tracks, preventing her from going further.

As Andy dresses and prepares to leave, he finds Holly's list of timetables of the murders. He takes it with him.

The police have surrounded Tracy and tell him to put the gun down. The driver warns Tracy that if he shoots him, the police will shoot him. After a moment, Tracy drops to his knees and tries to fire at the SWAT officer, and they open fire on him.

Once the train passes, Holly's engine breaks down.

Andy gets on a computer and checks the names on Holly's timetable against the Internet news reports of the people.

Holly calls a tow truck for her car.

Jeannie comes out at 6 am and finds Ralph still up. He goes to make her some coffee, and Jeannie asks him about Merlin's sketch. Ralph explains where the sketch came from, but isn't convinced the figure is real.

Holly wakes up and goes to the bathroom. Tracey is there, his face shot up, and he grabs Holly and turns her toward the front of the bus, telling her to look. Holly sees a semi across the highway, and Holly yells at the driver to stop. When she moves up front, she sees that there's no semi there. The driver pulls to the side, scraping the guide rail, and brakes the bus to a halt. Holly looks back and sees no sign of ""Tracey"", and tells the driver that she must have had a nightmare. The driver continues along.

Jack wakes up and feels at the blisters on his neck, and discovers that they're gone.

At the kitchen table, Jeannie insists that she saw the same person as Merlin. Ralph doesn't believe it, or that Jessa saw the figure as well. He points out that they're both alive despite the threat the figure made to Jeannie, and Jeannie suggests that Ralph is making a worse mistake keeping the investigation going. Ralph asks if she would feel the same way if Derek died, and Jeannie says that he's hitting below the belt but admits that he's right. Her husband says that he believes Jeannie dreamed the entire thing and there is no figure.

As Ralph washes the dishes, Jeannie says that she wants to go to the meeting with Holly and bringing Tamika, Jack, and Glory as well. She insists that Glory needs to see that Ralph is making some progress, and offers to invite Glory personally. Ralph agrees and answers his phone when Jack calls. Jack asks if there's anything he can help out with the meeting, and Ralph invites him along.

Later, Jeannie is sorting things in Derek's room and asks Ralph if he wants to help. He declines and leaves, and Jeannie takes the toys to the Maitland house for Jessa and Maya. She says that Glory should only go to the meting if she wants and assures her that she'll be there, and then asks Jessa if the figure still had Terry's eyes when he visited the second time. She says that the figure had holes for eyes, As Jeannie goes, Glory tells her that what she's putting Maya and Jessa through better be worth it.

Ralph meets with Herbert, who points out that Ralph missed their last session. The therapist warns that if he thinks Ralph is incapable, he'll have to note it to the review board. Ralph finally says that he saw Derek in what he says was a dream. Herbert asks why he thinks he had the dream now, and Ralph suggests that Derek was telling Ralph not to confuse him with Ollie since they would have been the same age.

On the bus, Holly gets a call from Andy. He says that they found the Williams' sisters fingerprints in Tracey's car. Tracey dated the older sister, and Andy suggests that Tracey was an accomplice in their deaths.

Ralph returns home and sees the sketches of the figure taped to the wall, including the new ones that Jeannie made from Jessa's description.

Jack meets Holly when her bus arrives in Cherokee City, and introduces himself. He explains that Ralph asked him to pick Holly up. They go to a diner and Jack says that he's new to the investigation. Jack asks for a preview of what she'll be talking about. Holly doesn't want to, saying that she's still organizing her thoughts. The detective wonders why Holly keeps staring at him, and she says that he looks like he's going through hell. She wonders if his wife left her, and Jack says that she left a few months ago but he was glad to see her gone. As they go, Holly mutters that no one will believe her.

After using the bathroom, Jack wets his face and looks at himself in the mirror. He turns and sees the words ""Stop her"" written on the wall behind him. As Jack drives Holly to the meeting, he asks Holly why no one will believe her, but she refuses to talk about it.

At the meeting at Howie's office, Alec points out all the evidence pointing to Terry as the killer. Jeannie notes that Terry was in another city. Jack and Holly arrive, and when Holly comes in she goes over everything that she's found about the other two murders. She notes all of the contradictory information and the fact that each killer had an apparently-accidental encounter with the previous one a month earlier.

Holly suggests that the three supposed killers were victims, and were all selected She suggests that El Cuco is a real entity that kills and eats children. Yunis is familiar with the legend from his childhood and crosses himself. Howie tells Glory that he doesn't have to listen to Holly's garbage, but Glory wants to hear the rest and Jack sides with Holly. Holly says that whatever the presence is, it's evil and it's real. She says that the key to stopping the next murder is to discover who El Cuco plans to duplicate next.

Glory curses at Holly, furious that she's been investigating the boogeyman to clear Terry. She walks out and Howie goes after her. Ralph and Yunis leave next, and Yunis figures that Claude is El Coco's next target. Ralph doesn't believe a word of it and walks off.

In the conference room, Holly tells Jeannie that everyone in the related families has died. She figures that Tracy was involved in the Williams' sister murder, and he was somehow driven to help El Cuco when it had taken on Heath's appearance. Jack looks at Holly's evidence and listens, and winces at the renewed pain in his neck. ""Stop her"" appears on his hands, but only he can see the words.

Alec meets with Howie and says that he doesn't believe Holly, but he isn't ready to say he doesn't. He's read up on myths and legends, and suggests that the legends of El Cuco has a basis in fact. Howie isn't impressed, and tells a joke about a Yiddish vampire, then walks off.

Jeannie gets into the car with Ralph, and when Ralph complains about Holly ""clown show"", Jeannie tells him to cut it out. Holly is sitting in the back, and Jeannie explains that she invited Holly to stay with them. Ralph sarcastically agrees.

Jack drives home.

When the Andersons return home, Jeannie takes Holly to the guest room. Holly looks at the figure sketches taped to the wall and complains that Jeannie didn't bring them to her, and Jeannie admits that she should have. Jeannie explains where she got them, and Holly says that they signify transformation. She figures that El Cuco waits 24 to 27 days between killings because it transforms between each murder.

Jeannie shows Holly where the figure was sitting when it warned her, and Ralph says that he didn't dust for fingerprints because there was no sign that anyone was sitting there. Holly asks Jeannie to get her Scotch tape and colored markers, and Ralph sarcastically comments on El Cuco. He says that he's known people like Holly who live in their own reality, and Holly says that she knows what she sounded like and doesn't enjoy being humiliated. She insists that she delivered what she believes is the truth, and apologizes for what the meeting became. Holly tells Ralph that she's such a disappointment to him, and asks him to let her see the investigation through.

When Jeannie returns with the tape and markers, Holly creates a purple light from her phone and checks the chair where the figure was sitting. Traces of the figure's liquids are on the chair and table, and Ralph says that they have to have the residue tested to confirm if it's the same they found in the barn. He says that the original residue samples are still being tested, and Holly says that the technicians are stumped because what they're examining isn't human, animal, mineral, or vegetable. She suggests that they'll eventually dismiss the residue contents as contamination, and figures that El Cuco is shedding.

Jack enters his home and stands hesitantly in the darkness.

At home, Glory looks through a drawer with Terry's things and buries her face in his clothing.

After Jack takes a shower, he comes out to find his dead mother waiting for him.

Glory takes out a drawer

Jack says that his mother is dead and she should go away. El Cuco, appearing as Jack's mother, tells Jack that he fucked up like he always does. She leaps across the room and tackles Jeff, then punches him repeatedly.

Glory tosses Terry's clothes and things on the hallway floor into a pile.

Sobbing, Jack crawls away and begs his mother to stop.

Jeannie wonders if El Cuco was there or not, and Holly finally speculates that the creature projected its consciousness because it was too weak to move. El Cuco can't risk physical exposure, so it uses ""servants"" like Tracey. Ralph goes into Derek's room and wonders if he saw El Cuco earlier instead of his son. Glory calls and asks Ralph to come over.

Ralph and Glory meet in the Maitland kitchen, and Ralph apologizes for not vetting what Holly was going to say. He insists that they're going to continue to find the real killer, and Glory figures that Terry was so good that they shouldn't have to work so hard to prove his innocence. She asks Ralph if he thinks Terry killed Frankie, and Ralph says that he doesn't believe it. He insists that whenever he investigates a crime, there's a rational explanation.

At the strip bar, Claude hears two men arguing. He goes over to break up the fight and one of the men slashes him with a knife. Claude goes berserk on the man, and the other bouncer pulls him away, warns him that he's still on parole, and tells him to get some. When Claude goes out the back, he pauses as he senses something, but then dismisses it as his imagination. As he gets in his car and drives away, Yunis watches him down the street from his car.

Ralph returns home and finds Holly in the kitchen making tea. He tells her that it's not his decision to fire her from the case, and complains that she gave a name and resume to the unexplained. Holly warns Ralph that El Cuco is trying to stop them, terrifying the people around Ralph, and says that El Cuco wouldn't be trying to stop them if their investigation didn't threaten it and it wasn't vulnerable. She says that Ralph is the one El Cuco would go after the most, and asks what El Cuco said to Ralph. Ralph insists that ""Derek"" wasn't El Cuco, and finally tells Holly that ""Derek"" said to let him go. He admits that he didn't tell Jeannie, and Holly goes to bed as Ralph mutters that ""Derek"" wasn't El Cuco.

Glory finds Jessa going through Terry's things.

Ralph and Jeannie lie in their bed, and they hold each other.

Holly prints out the photo of Tracey's neck with the blistering.

The next morning, Jack wakes up choking on his blood sprayed on the walls. The blisters on his neck are back, and Jack says ""okay"".

Holly is getting dressed and putting makeup on his bruises when Jack calls him. He says that he hated the way she was treated in the meeting and offers to provide her with something tangible to prove her theory. Jack tells Holly that he found something at the barn that everyone overlooked, and she needs to come see it for herself. Holly goes to her car, and Jack tells her not to mention her excursion to the Andersons and hangs up. Jack then loads his pistol and goes out. Holly is there, having found his address on the Internet, and says that she doesn't trust anyone's driving but her own. Jack gets into the car with Holly and when she notices his bruises and cuts, says that she should see the other guy.

Holly drives to the barn, and says that he would look better without the makeup covering his bruises. She grabs a pack of wipes and takes one out, and when she ""accidentally"" drops it, Jack bends over to pick it up. Holly sees the blisters on his neck then looks away when Jack sits back up. She says that she needs to go back to Ralph's to get some stuff she printed out that Jack should see, but Jack stops her and says that it will keep."

Andy is packing his things and leaves.

Ralph stands in his kitchen and stares contemplatively at the kitchen table while drinking his coffee. He takes down the sketches of the Outsider that Jeannie taped to the wall, and Jeannie comes out and sees him put them in a drawer. He asks where the chair is that the Outsider sat in, and Jeannie says that she doesn't want it there and it's out back until the next garbage pickup. She says that she's already ordered a replacement. Ralph notes that he heard Holly leave earlier and Jeannie wonders what business she would have in town that early. She wishes Ralph has talked to Holly, and he says that he was in bed. Jeannie leaves for work, leaving Ralph alone.

Howie is working in his office when the phone rings. He finally takes the call from Glory, who says that she's going back to work that day. She doesn't want to sue, and Howie tells her that they'll proceed when she's ready. Jessa asks Glory stay with them, and Maya wonders if people are going to be mean to her. Glory tells her daughters that there are nice people in Cherokee City and she's going to sell a house to one of them.

Ralph picks up the photo of the back of Tracy's neck that Holly printed out, then drops it and walks out.

Holly continues driving with Jack in the seat next to her. He winces in pain and Holly asks how far it is to the barn. Jack turns on the radio and doesn't answer her question, and Holly repeats her question. He talks about how he didn't believe in anything when he was kid, including the boogeyman, but now he believes that there's something worse out there than anything he ever imagined. Holly tells him that he's right to believe, and Jack wonders what the Outsider is. She admits that she doesn't know anything about the Outsider, and Jack shows her the blisters and says that he's just like Tracy. He wonders if he'll eventually let himself be killed, and Holly says she's going to track and expose it if she can. Holly says that once she sees what Jack wants to show her at the barn, she'll find it and stop it. She asks Jack if he knows she's trying to help him, and Jack moans in pain and doesn't answer her question. Jack then tells her to take the next road and turns up the volume on the radio.

Ralph tries to call Holly but she doesn't answer. He leaves a message for her to call him, then calls Jack and gets his voice mail. Ralph leaves a message for Jack to call him, asking if he knows where Holly is. He then calls Ralph and asks him to have Holly call him. He calls Alec, who says that Holly seemed to be hanging around Jack and figures that they're together since neither of them are answering their phones. Ralph tells Alec to meet him at the apartment where Jack is staying.

Claude gets fired at the strip club, and his former boss Lenny gives him severance pay. The ex-bouncer says that he hasn't been feeling like himself lately and goes to his car.

Holly continues driving, and Jack wonders why the Outsider picked him. She suggests that the Outsider is drawn to pain, and Jack has been wronged all his life. Jack describes how his mother wronged him.

Glory shows a couple a house, and they stare at her. She finally says that she's Terry's wife, and all they're thinking about is which of their friends they'll blab to first. Glory snaps at them and then takes them to see the guest room.

Ralph and Alec knock at Jack's door but get no answer. They pick the lock and go inside, and find the blood on the walls and the place torn up. Ralph calls to put a BOLO out on Holly's car, and says that they should consider Jack armed and dangerous. Once he hangs up, Ralph and Alec break into Jack's truck in the parking lot and search it. Alec calls Howie and says that Holly is missing and they think she's with Jack. Howie says that he can't help them at the moment, and figures that Holly and Jack went off somewhere together because Jack apparently believed her claim. Alec says that there's blood on the walls and hangs up.

Jack's phone rings, and he ignores it. Holly asks him what the Outsider forced him to do for it, and Jack says that it has had him do spying, mostly. She wonders why Jack didn't stop him from telling everyone what she knew instead of just taking her there, and points out how the Outsider is making Jack pay. Jack tells her to keep her eyes on the road, and wishes that Holly had told him more about his tormentor than she really can.

Ralph goes to Tamika's house and asks how she's doing. She joins him on the lawn, and Ralph tells her that they think Jack has taken Holly. Ralph wonders if Tamika has noticed anything odd about Jack, and she says that she hasn't seen since the christening. Meanwhile, the Outsider enters Tamika's house and looks down on the crib where Tamika's baby son Jerome is sleeping. Meanwhile, Tamika says that she's transferring to computer crimes after she comes back from maternity leave, and tells Ralph that she hopes he finds Jack before going inside.

Alec and Ralph go to the strip club and ask Lenny if Jack was there. Lenny says that he wasn't, and says that Claude quit. Alec asks Lenny to give them a ring if he talks to Jack and hands the owner his card, and meanwhile Yunis calls Ralph and says that he pinged Holly's phone and it's with Jack's. Both phones are heading down the highway, and Ralph and Alec drive to intercept them.

Jack seemingly dozes off, but Holly wakes him up to say she has to go the bathroom and can't hold it. She pulls over at a gas station, then fishes for something in her handbag. Jack asks what she's taking with her, and Holly says that she's having her period. He takes her phone, claiming the battery on his is about dead. Holly goes into the restroom and closes the door behind her, gasping. She can't get the window open. An impatient Jack finally comes over.

Holly grabs the lid off the toilet and breaks the window. Jack runs around to the back, and Holly runs out the front and gets back into her car. When Jack comes back, he holds up the car keys he took. She has a spare set and drive away, and Jack draws his gun and shoots at her. Cursing in frustration, Jack throws the cell phone down and stomps it. Holly pulls over down the road and discovers that her cell phone is gone.

Alec asks Ralph if any of it makes sense to him since he knows Jack. The investigator wonders why Ralph thinks Jack would abduct Holly, and Ralph says that nothing has made sense in his life since Frankie was killed. Alec talks about how, one summer when he was a kid, he got lost in the woods. It got dark and cold, and two hunters who were part of a search party found him. Before they found Alec, he heard something call his name twice. Ralph immediately dismisses it as imagination, but Alec insists that wasn't what happened, and he's never been so scared since. The police officer has nothing to say to that.

Glory meets with her employer Lorraine at her house, and Lorraine warns that the couple might file charges for emotional distress. She figures she should never have let Glory come back to work, and Glory figures there'd never be a right time. Glory says that she needs to make a living, and suggests Lorraine sell her house and move with her daughters to get a fresh start. Before she goes, Lorraine tells Glory that she shouldn't let them run her out of town after what they've put her through. Glory calls Howie and tells him that they should sue the police and any other city government department, and maybe the individuals.

Ralph and Alec reach the gas station, and question the clerk who saw nothing. Alec sees where a car pulled out, and the two men find the smashed phone. Ralph admits that he doesn't know if Holly is dead. Police cars pull up and Ralph figures that once they show them the cell phone, they can go because Yunis already briefed the police.

In the forest, Jack sits alone and considers shooting himself. He puts the gun in his mouth and tries to pull the trigger, but can't. Jack yells in rage and drops to his knees, then rolls over on his back. He shoots his gun into the sky, cursing.

Howie arrives at Ralph's house, and finds Ralph, Alec, and Jeannie there with Holly. Holly tells them that she originally believed Jack, but then sound the blisters and figured Jack was delivering her to the Outsider. She figures the Outsider only feeds on children, and came to the conclusion Jack was taking her somewhere to eliminate her and he had no choice in the matter, but he was fighting against the compulsion. Holly figures the Outsider gets into his ""Renfields"" through the blister wound, and the only way they can get free is through death. She figures Jack Is wherever the Outsider wants him to be.

Jack walks to the highway and tries to get passing cars to stop for him. A truck driver finally stops and gives Jack a lift.

Yunis shows Holly a photo of Claude and asks if she's ever seen him, and Holly says she hasn't but hesitates. He tells Holly to hold onto the photo, and Andy arrives at the f4ront door and asks to see Holly. When Holly comes to the door, Andy hugs her in relief.

The truck heads to Cherokee City.

Yunis tells Ralph that they have an APB out on Jack and the cops are staking out his apartment. The GBI agent notes that the gas station was in the opposite direction from the barn, and Jack's phone is turned off. Ralph wonders why Jack didn't kill Holly in the first place, and Yunis says that Holly told Ralph the truth about Jack not wanting to kill her but Ralph won't believe it. Yunis says that Holly said she didn't recognize Claude but she couldn't work out where she had seen him. The GBI agent says he just wants the whole thing to end, not make sense like Ralph does, and leaves.

The driver drops Jack off at a roadside restaurant.

Andy talks to Ralph and says that he's been doing his own research on Heath, which led him to Terry. He wants to be part of the investigation. Holly calls Ralph in and points out that the Outsider in its final transformation stages, and that Ralph knew the Outsider scratched Claude. She wonders why Ralph didn't tell her, and Jeannie tells her husband that he doesn't get to play like it's reasonable and rationale to ignore everything irrational happening in his face. Jeannie tells Ralph that he needs to get over that or step to the side because he's standing in everyone else's way.

Jack sits on the grass across from the restaurant as night falls.

Ralph calls Herbert and makes an appointment in an hour. He then looks at the kitchen chair that he recovered from the garbage, then sits on it. Later, Ralph meets with Herbert and asks him if he believes in God, or Heaven and Hell, or evil. The therapist finally says that he believes in medical research, and Ralph figures that Herbert believes negative things have a rational explanation. Herbert asks Ralph to tell him what's going on with him, and Ralph explains that something is unfolding that is too much for him. The therapist asks for specifics, and Ralph finally tells him that he has to let go to let something in. He apologizes because he can't say anything more, and Herbert says that he can't do anything for him. However, the therapist says that there's a lot they don't know about the world and never will.

The next morning, Holly wakes up from a nightmare of Jack shooting her at the gas station. She goes to the bathroom mirror, looks at herself, and screams in defiance."

The car guarding Jack's motel room leaves in response, and Jack goes into his room and gets some guns out of a hidden compartment. He loads them up and takes them to his truck, gets a radio out of his glove compartment, sets it to the police frequency, and drives off.

Claude goes to Cecil, Tennessee, and meets with his brother Seale. They hug and go to get beers.

At the Anderson place, Holly wonders where Claude is. Andy says that he already checked with Claude's parole officer and learned that he said he was going to go hang with Seale in Cecil. Howie says that there's not much there then bars and a cave, and Holly says that she's going to go to Cecil and isolate the Outsider if he there's taking on Claude's form. She figures that when the Outsider strikes, all of the forensics will show that Claude was responsible.

Holly explains that the Outsider had to run once the footage turned up of Terry being 60 miles away when Frankie was murdered. She figures that it has to stay in one place for weeks at a time after it kills, to regain strength and go through the transformation, but this time it was too weak to fend for itself and had to run. Jeannie figures that if Holly can provide Claude with an alibi, then the police will look at other suspects and the Outsider will run again, weaker than before. Eventually Holly figures that the Outsider will reveal itself to the world.

Ralph asks her how they'll know what it becomes after it becomes Claude. Holly figures the Outsider isn't strong enough to kill yet because it's still transforming. Andy tells Holly that he wants to go with her, and Yunis wants to go as well. Ralph finally says that he'll go, and a surprised Holly agrees.

In Cecil, Claude and Seale drink and talk about how big the coming cave festival will be. Seale mentions how Claude left the Peach Crease, and Claude explains that he felt he had to get out of Cherokee City before something really bad happened. He tells his brother that he can't sleep and keeps triple-checking the locks on his doors. Claude thinks there's someone in the apartment with him or trying to get in, and it feels like something is going to go down.

As they leave, Yunis suggests to Holly that he call ahead and have Claude held by the authorities before they arrive. Holly agrees, then tells Andy that she's going to ride with Ralph. Ralph goes back in his house with Howie, who says that he worries about Ralph sometimes. The lawyer says that Glory has given him the go-ahead to sue everybody in town involved with Terry's arrest except Ralph. Howie says that Glory figures that Ralph can vindicate Terry, tells Ralph to be careful wherever he's going, and leaves.

As Ralph packs, Jeannie comes in and wonders where she's going. Ralph says that he doesn't have another lead, and his wife tells him not to go because he doesn't believe in the Outsider so he won't see it for what it really is. Jeannie warns that there will be a battle and she can't survive losing Ralph as well.

Jack drives down the highway and hears a radio APB for him. They identify his truck by make and plates, and Jack curses in frustration.

As Ralph drives, he tells Holly that Jack broke into his own place and stole his truck. He talks about how Jack once told him that all he wanted to do as a kid was become a sharpshooter in the military. Jack enlisted at 18, then went to sniper school and got his dream. He failed the last round of psych evaluations before deploying, and ended up as a warehouse clerk. Holly figures that's why the Outsider wanted Jack, and Ralph asks what the Outsider wants. Holly says that it just wants to survive and it's not human, and an irritated Ralph tells her that he knew she was going to say that.

In a rundown neighborhood, Seale brings Claude to the old family house where Seale still lives.

Yunis drives and asks Andy if he's a believer in El Cuco. Andy says that he believes in Holly and goes where she goes, and they discuss Andy's relationship with Holly. He hopes that he and Holly are a ""thing"", and Yunis says that Hollys is a very unique person. Yunis says that Holly can walk into a room full of people and pick out which ones are going to die soon, and asks if Holly has acted toward Andy like she can sense the same thing about him. Andy looks nervous, and Yunis snickers and admits that he was joking.

Holly asks Ralph why he's coming, and doesn't accept his answers that he's looking for answers. He says that he's desperate but won't tell anyone because they're afraid of being laughed out of the squad. Holly says that she knows he's still fighting the theory, but she feels more grounded around him than anyone else. Ralph half-jokingly challenges that, and Holly says that she needs disbelief more than belief.

Claude asks Seals if he's still going to the anger management class, and Seale says that he finds the class helpful. His brother looks at a photo of their family and they both admit that people in their family have a temper. One of Seale's fellow workers pulls up, and Seale goes to talk to him while Claude goes to get some takeout. Two policemen pull him over and one of them says that there's been a complaint, addresses Claude by name, and tells him to step out of the car and come with them.

The officers take Claude to the jail and lock him up, without telling him why they arrested him. They finally give him his phone call.

Holly tells Ralph that she didn't know about his son. Ralph talks about how his mother died when he was in the basement when he was 16, and after he played a song on a record she wanted (Washington Square by The Village Stompers), he called his father to tell him what happened. He heard the song on the radio for the first time in 15 years later on the night Derek was born. Ralph asks what Holly makes of that, and Holly says that it was a coincidence. Surprised, Ralph says that he thought she'd have more and chuckles. Holly joins in and Ralph says that his mother would have loved the story.

Claude tells the officers who arrested him about some of the strippers at the Peach Crease. Seale come in response to Claude's call, furious, and the officers tell him to calm down or they'll arrest him as well. When Seale prepares to fight, one of the officers tasers him and both officers handcuff him.

A man returns from fishing and finds Jack's truck parked next to his. Jack shoots and kills the fisherman, then sits in the forest and listens to chewing sounds, disgusted. Once the Outsider is finished with the fisherman's body, Jack takes the man's truck and drives off.

Claude and Seale sit in a cell together, and Seale calls the officers ""pansy-assed little bitches"" because one of them tased him from behind.

The Davidson family drives to the Cecil caves.

Jack pulls over on the highway and tries to avoid looking at the fisherman's photo of his family on the rearview mirror. The Outsider in the back tells him to pass the photo back, and Jack reluctantly does so. El Cuco's hand has Claude's tattoos on the knuckles. The creature says that it needs to eat, saying the fisherman was full of cancer, and Jack drives off.

When Ralph and the others arrive in Cecil, they wonder what to tell Claude. Holly says that they should tell him the truth, go in, and Yunis says that they're there to pick up Claude. Yunis confirms with one of the officers, Council, that his superior had them detain Claude and calls the man. Once Council gets the okay, he releases Claude. Claude refuses to go without Seale, and Yunis agrees to get Seale released as well.

Howie asks Alec why he didn't go with the others, and Alec finally says that when he was Iraq, he felt something bad was going to happen. He tells Howie that he hasn't felt that way since he did foot patrols in Iraq, and that he isn't going on any more foot patrols.

In the caves, Jack listens as the Outsider feeds. It roars at Jack, who clutches at the blisters on his neck in pain.

The Davidsons arrive at ""Cavestock"", and the father Mike winces at the price.

Ralph and Yunis take Claude and Seale out, and Holly and Andy are waiting. Holly says that they need to talk privately, and they go to the Bolton home and tells Claude about the Outsider. Claude admits that he feels like something has been getting into his head, and Ralph walks out. Yunis says that they had Claude picked up for his own protection, because the police could alibi him if there were any murders. Claude insists on staying in his family house and Holly says that they'll stay there with him. Seale figures that he can vouch for Claude on his own, and Yunis points out that he doesn't have the best reputation.

Holly goes out to Ralph and tells him to go home. If he can't believe in the Outsider, they're a danger to everyone else. Ralph tells her to let him come in at his own pace, and she asks him to come in faster.

That night, the Davidsons walk around Cavestock and the boy, Sam, looks around, thrilled. His sister, Wanda, notices a cute boy at a food stand and says that she's hungry. Sam goes off to look at something, while his parents get beers.

Ralph notices gunshot holes in the inside walls of the house, while identifies Seale's jigsaw puzzle even though he put away the box lid.

Alec visits Howie and says that he should have gone with the others. He figures he should have watched Holly's back, and Howie points out that Holly is with three police officers. Alec admits that Howie is right but he can't help feeling like they abandoned Holly.

The group goes out on the porch and Claude asks them how long they intend to stay. Holly figures the Outsider will strike soon and frame Claude. Seale tells them that they'll have to find somewhere else to stay, and his brother tells him that everyplace is booked up for Cavestock. The group agrees to stay, and Yunis goes to check out something he saw when they drove in and will be back soon.

Sam is looking at a display, while Mike tells his wife Deb that he's finally bored with Cavestock. Deb says that Sam isn't bored, and Mike points out that Sam is a nerd. Meanwhile, a foxhead-masked Outsider comes up to Sam and offers to take him to a cave with prehistoric claw marks on the ceiling. Sam eagerly goes with him to see the claw marks.

Mike sees Wanda with two boys and goes over to ""disperse"" them. One of the boys sees Sam with the masked Outsider and admires the latter's mask. Wanda goes over and yells that the Outsider has his brother as the Outsider takes Sam into the crowd. When two locals come over to confront the Outsider, he shoves Sam at them and tries to run, but they tackle him. Mike pulls off the foxhead mask and gets a look at Claude's face, and the Outsider runs off.

Ralph calls Jeannie and tells her that not much is happening there. A car pulls up, slows down, then drives off. Seale comes over and Ralph realizes the driver was Seale's weed dealer. He asks Seale to hold off on buying while they're there. Holly and Andy come out and ask to borrow Ralph's car so they can get some things. They drive to a convenience store, and Holly sees something nearby and tells Andy that she'll be back in a minute. She goes into a strip-mall church, crosses herself, and sits down next to Yunis. Holly says that she's tired and Yunis takes her hand.

At the station, detectives question the Davidson family about what happened.

Yunis drives back to the Bolton house with Holly, and sleeps in the car. Meanwhile, Holly sits on the porch couch with Andy and he covers both of them over with a blanket, holding Holly.

Ralph wakes up in the middle of the night when hears something moving. He goes to investigate, drawing his gun, and finds Claude looking out a window and yanking opening doors, looking for someone. Claude finds no one, and Ralph watches him from the shadows and then goes back to bed.

Later, Ralph wakes up on the sofa where he's sleeping when Seale flashes a camera bulb in his face. Seale says that he wanted to document the occasion of police sleeping in the house.

The next morning, Howie and Alec knock on the car window, waking Yunis up. They go in the house, waking up Andy and Holly on the porch. The police detectives arrive and say that they're there for Claude. Ralph and Yunis tell Seale to go inside and let them handle it. Once he does, Ralph flashes his badge and suggests that they talk outside. Once the detectives say what happened, Ralph says that he can personally vouch that Claude was there with him. Holly joins them as the detectives show them a tablet with video of Mike unmasking the Outsider--revealing Claude's face--at Cavestock. Holly tells Ralph that ""he"" is here, then corrects herself and says ""it""."

At a barn, one boy climbs up into the hayloft with a flashlight. He hears someone moving in the darkness, and the boy he's playing flashlight tag with ""tags"" him. The boys, John and George Weaver, run outside and across a field into the forest.

At home, the boys' father Emmitt calls them to dinner. They don't respond, and Emmitt goes into the barn to look for them but doesn't find them. Emmitt searches the forest for them but doesn't find anyone.

Now

Inside the Bolton house, Howie looks out and watches Ralph and Yu8nis talk to the Cecil detectives. The lawyer goes out, and Ralph shows him the video of ""Claude"" at Cavestock. Ralph assures the detectives that Claude was with him the night before, and says that they were there because Claude is a witness in a homicide and Ralph came down to get a statement. Yunis explains that they wanted to question Claude is a non-threatening environment, and Seale let them stay. He says that the perp they're looking for abducted an 11-year-old boy in Cherokee City, and Ralph asks to interview their witnesses to see if they're dealing with the same guy. The detectives consider the idea, say that they'll be in touch, and leave.

Once they leave, Holly warns that whatever they say in front of Claude, El Coco can see and hear what he sees through their mental link. Seale isn't convinced but Holly tells him that the safer Claude is, the safer they all are. Howie hangs back with Ralph and asks him if the video was of El Coco. Ralph advises Howie to believe it while he's there and goes inside.

The group meets in the kitchen, and Andy wonders what they do once they find El Coco. He wonders if they can kill it, and Ralph figures that if it needs food to sustain itself, it can be killed. Holly suggests that they just contain it, but still isn't convinced El Coco exists. The others admit that they don't know anything about stopping it, and Holly says that one of them take Claude somewhere while the rest of them make plans. She tells Seale to drop the attitude because they need him. When Claude comes in, Seale suggests that they go to a diner to get chicken. Howie offers to drive Claude, and Claude agrees to go with him.

Ralph calls Jeannie and tells her that they're working on ""it"". He says that they're making progress, then says that El Coco is there. As Jeannie backs out of the driveway, she almost hits a jogger. Jeannie pulls back into the driveway, and tells Ralph that he can't go near El Coco. She asks Ralph to come home, begging him not to go after it, and Ralph says that they're just going to share what they know and step away.

-----

John and George go to the nearby Bear Cave. They don't have money to go in through the front gate and John takes his brother to another entrance blocked by a rock fall that the local children know about.

-----

The group watch the video and figures El Coco panicked. They figure it's starving and took the rest, and will go after another kid. Yunis points out that El Coco knocked over Mike Davidson even though he's starving. Andy confirms there's only one cemetery within ten miles, and suggests that he and Holly check it out. Seale says that they don't have any family buried there, and that all of the coffins at the one the Boltons favored got flooded in the 60s. Holly and Andy go to the kitchen, and Seale tells Ralph that Claude is all that he's got.

-----

Emmitt comes to the main entrance and talks to the woman running the souvenir shop, Evelyn Stickhouse. She says that no one has come through, and when he says that he needs to go in, Evelyn tells him to go ahe3ad without paying. Emmitt grabs a flashlight and goes in.

-----

Yunis hears from the detectives that Sam and Mike are coming in to look at mug shots, and they'll let Ralph and Yunis sit in. Howie and Claude leave to get chicken.

Hayes' secretary tells him that a hiker called in and said that he came across the body of a young boy who was killed the same way Frankie was. They wanted Hayes to check it out, but he refuses while telling his secretary to have the police in Cecil keep him posted.

Claude figures that El Coco sees and knows everything he does, and asks Howie to pull over because he's going to be sick. Howie does so and Claude gets up and throws up. When Claude gets back in, he tells Howie about he figures there's nothing he can do about any virus, including El Coco.

-----

John and George continue into the caves. Meanwhile, Emmitt continues searching for his sons.

-----

Andy and Holly arrive at the overgrown cemetery, and they find the stones of a couple who died at around the same time. Holly deduces that they both died of Spanish Flu in 1918, but Andy believes that they were conjoined at the soul and one decided to follow the other. When Holly smiles, Andy notices but she says that she's not smiling about anything in particular and leaves, with Andy following her.

Ralph and Yunis participate in Sam's questioning, and how Foxhead mentioned the Bear Cave. The boy describes how his grandpa wrestled with Foxhead, Ralph assures Sam that he's doing great, and asks if Foxhead touched Sam. Sam says that Foxhead had his hand on his shoulder, and Ralph confirms that Foxhead didn't scratch Sam. He claims that Foxhead wouldn't have hurt Sam to reassure the boy.

Andy and Holly go to Cavestock and get a map of the area. He wonders why El Coco ran off the direction that he did, and Holly finds the mounted map of the caves that Foxhead and Sam were looking at. She finds traces of the same residue found on the clothing.

Ralph questions Mike, who asks why Ralph asked Sam if Foxhead scratched him. The detective says that it's just a question they're required to ask, and Ralph says that the umasked Foxhead had ""weird eyes"" that were too far back in the sockets and he still looked like he was wearing a mask.

In the caves, El Coco looks at Jack sitting by himself.

Once Mike and Sam are escorted out, Ralph and Yunis ask one of the detectives about the Bear Cave. He hasn't heard of it, and they leave.

Hayes goes over photos of Frankie's body at the crime scene,

After Howie and Claude get chicken, Howie says that they should wait to go back and suggests they try some of the chicken now. Claude figures that Howie doesn't remember him from court eight years ago, representing him on a charge of assault and battery in a bar fight. Howie was sentence to mandatory AA, and Howie tells him that he's had to stand up for evil bastards and Claude should take it as a compliment that Howie doesn't remember him.

-----

John and George continue through the caves, and they come to a dead-end and retrace their steps.

Emmitt continues searching. He hears his sons yelling and yells back to them, but they can't find each other because of the echoes. Emmitt finds the Bear Cave and yells at his sons to stop moving while he goes for help. He leaves, snaps at Evelyn, and calls in locals to help him search for his sons.

-----

When they go back to the Bolton house, Andy points out the path El Coco fled on the map. When Ralph mentions the Bear Caves, Seale says that it was sealed in 1947 because the Weaver boys got themselves lost. Four Boltons died in the search.

-----

Emmitt, his wife Dara, and half of the search party open up the rock fall, and Emmitt assures Dara that they'll get their boys out. The party enters the caves and follow their voices. The yelling sets off a new rock fall, trapping them.

-----

Seale says that the party was trapped in the caves when there was a rock fall, and they slowly starved to death. Other search parties couldn't blast the rocks free without bringing down the entire cave, and 34 people in the first party died. Seale says that his people are ""buried"" in the cave, and it's the biggest cemetery in the state. He describes the souvenir store, and how locals broke down the concrete plug the state authorities sealed the caves off with so they could go in and get high. Ralph asks Seale to show him where it is on the map, and Seale gets a bigger map of the area. Holly figures that El Coco is in the caves, and Seale comes back and shows them the caves and a back entrance but an earthquake caused a rock fall and blocked it off.

Seale says that maybe El Coco is waiting for them. Ralph claims that they're just trying to find El Coco and call in the ""cavalry"", and they'll tell them that Foxhead is in there. Seale wonders what happens if El Coco gets past the party, and if it will come for Claude since he doesn't know anything since they're keeping him in the dark. Howie and Claude come back with the chicken.

Glory visits Jeannine.

As the group prepares to go into the cave without Howie, the lawyer complains that he didn't come there to babysit. Howie warns that he has to leave the next day, and Ralph assures him that they'll back in a few hours.

Glory says that she ran into Hayes at the county building and he wanted to talk to her. She refused because he's a plaintiff in one of her lawsuits, but he was acting hangdog. Glory explains that she was mad at Jeannine for dragging her to the meeting, and Jeannine admits that she and a lot of the others believe what Holly said about El Coco. She tells Glory that she can't explain what the others are doing but they're risking their lives. Glory says that she didn't want the meeting to destroy the good will between them, and she wants Jeannine to know that she respects the sincerity of Jeannine's beliefs.

The group takes two cars to the caves, and Yunis tells Ralph that he's stopped talking about El Coco as conditional, and Ralph agrees but admits that it makes him sick to his stomach. Alec is in the back, and tells Ralph that he has to take small bites to accept that El Coco is real. When Ralph objects, Alec tells him to accept what he can until he's ready for another bite. Yunis wonders what they do if El Coco doesn't want to be contained, and Alec says that then they kill it before it kills them.

Howie smokes weed with Seale and coughs, and Seale asks if it's right them not telling Claude their plans. He insists that it's not right, and Howie tells him to stick with the plan. Howie goes to the kitchen to get some leftover chicken, and Claude wakes up. As Howie opens the refrigerator, he hears Seale telling Claude about El Coco. He goes back as Claude tells his brother that El Coco is in his head, and Seale just told him that the others are coming for it.

El Coco sits up and walks away.

Howie calls the others but doesn't get a signal. Seale admits that he might have fucked up, and Claude tells him that the others are going up against El Coco for him. The three men get into Howie's car and drive to the caves.

Jack loads the guns that he brought with him, takes a drink of whiskey, and goes to a hill. He sets up a sniper post and waits, unaware of the rattler nearby.

As Andy and Holly drive to the caves, they play movie trivia and Holly knows all of the movie info. She admits that she never saw the movies. They pull over and kiss, then drive on to join the others. Jack sees the cars pull up and prepares to shoot.

As Andy prepares his gun, Holly warns that firing it in the caves is a bad idea because the sound could cause a gunshot. Jack pulls the trigger, blowing Alec's head open, and the others take cover as Jack fires six more shots."

Yunis and Ben draw their guns and return fire, but are unable to hit their attacker. Ben yells to Jack saying they can talk, but Jack ignores him and keeps shooting as he drinks from the bottle of whiskey he brought.

Howie, Claude, and Seale drive up, and the other wave waves at them to keep going. The lawyer pulls over and the three men get out and take cover. Seale returns fire with his rifle, hitting Jack's bottle, and a rattlesnake approaches Jack. When Jack tries to knock it away with a long stick, the others get to closer cover. Jack returns to shooting and kills Seale when he steps out, then laughs in triumph. Yunis fires back at Jack and runs, and Jack shoots him in the arm. Ben helps Yunis to cover, and Howie gets back in his SUV but Jack shoots at him through the window.

Claude runs to his brother's corpse and tries to drag him away, and Howie goes to help him. Jack is distracted reloading, and Claude and Howie get the body to cover. Andy's phone won't get reception, and Holly realizes that he's considering making a break for one of the cars and tells him not to think about it. Yunis says that they have to advance or die, and Andy runs for the truck. He gets in and stays low, and starts the truck. Andy backs the truck up then stops as he passes out, and Jack shoots the gas tank, causing a leak onto the road. Holly realizes what will happen next and tries to run over, but Howie stops her and says that he'll get Andy.

Jack shoots the gas puddle, causing a spark that ignites the gas tank. As Howie runs over to get Andy out, the truck explodes, killing both men. Jack draws a bead on Holly, who walks out, stares at Andy's burning body, and then screams at Jack in defiance. Breaking free of El Cuco's control, Jack hesitates. El Cuco tries to take control of him again, and Jack clutches at the throbbing blisters on his neck. Jack mutters ""no more"" and turns to see the rattlesnake. He thrust his leg out at it and tells it to come at him, and it bites him.

The group below hear Jack's screams of pain, and then a gunshot. Holly walks over to Ben and tells him that it's time as more gunshots ring out from Jack's position. She says that it's time and walks away.

El Cuco realizes that Jack is dead and sits down, growling.

Ben gets some flashlights, confirms that Yunis will be okay by himself, and goes into the caves with Holly. Jack limps up, his body swollen with the venom, and Ralph aims his gun at him. Yunis aims his gun as well and tells Jack to put down his rifle, and Jack says that El Cuco is in the caves and they should kill it. He then kills himself with his own rifle and Holly and Ralph continue into the caves through the back entrance. They find the gate unlocked and walk into the darkness. They find El Cuco's handprints on a railing and Holly figures he's scared of dying so he can be killed. There are half-eaten animal carcasses scattered throughout the caves, and Holly figures that he's feeding.

Holly and Ralph wade through an underground lake and hear something splashing behind them. They find traces of El Cuco's spoor on the walls in the shape of his handprints, dozens of them, and Holly realizes that he was in a frenzy. Ralph finds the stone that marks where the search party died beyond, and Holly figures that El Cuco went crazy trying to get at the bodies.

Yunis kneels next to one of the corpses and clutches his head in grief.

Ralph and Holly reach a larger cave, and El Cuco tells them to watch their step because it's slippery. They go in and find El Cuco's lair. El Cuco, wearing the shape of Claude, is waiting for them. Ralph draws his gun, and El Cuco asks Holly what made it so easy for her to believe in him and how she convinced Ralph and the others. Holly asks what El Cuco is and what its name is, and he says that he doesn't remember. She wonders if there's more like it, and El Cuco wonders if there's more of its kind because there are times when he can sense there could be more.

When Ralph aims his gun at El Cuco, he points out that the noise would most likely bring down the walls and kill all of them. El Cuco yells and parts of the ceiling crumble. The creature says that the dead are there and advances on Ralph, and says that he still that the bodies give off a glow, particularly the Boltons. El Cuco says that their emotional fills them, and says that it eats to survive. Holly asks why he feeds on children, and El Cuco tells her that they taste the sweetest.

Ralph moves in on El Cuco, and Holly tells him to stop, warning that El Cuco is poison. El Cuco tells them that he can't let them leave, and Holly says that they can't let him leave. Ralph says that Yunis is still alive and knows what El Cuco is, and El Cuco walks toward Ralph and says that he needs to eat. Claude steps out of the shadows, shotgun ready, and Ralph tells him to put it down. Holly warns him not to shoot, but Claude stares at his doppelganger,

After a moment, Claude shoots El Cuco. The sound echoes throughout the chamber and the ceiling starts to come down. Ralph gets Holly out, while Claude stares at El Cuco's body. When the collapse ends, Claude calls Ralph and Holly over. A slab of rock has pinned his leg, and Holly and Ralph lift it off. They hear something moving in the darkness and go to check it out while Claude stays behind.

El Cuco is impaled by a stalagmite, impaling him to the ground. Holly borrows a knife from Ralph and uses it to stab El Cuco in the heart. Ralph tells her to leave El Cuco's body there because no one believe he killed Frankie. They go back to Claude and assure him that he killed El Cuco, and then they help Claude out. Ralph sees two children, Frankie and Derek, but Holly and Claude don't.

Ralph tells Holly and Claude to go on, then goes back to El Cuco and retrieves his knife. He says that El Cuco is playing possum. Ralph admits that he's not sure if El Cuco can be killed, and figures El Cuco is getting weaker and can't run or hunt. When El Cuco moves his hand, Ralph pins the hand to the ground with the knife. He talks about how tourists and then scientists will come, and the scientists will take El Cuco to their labs and cut off pieces of him as samples. Ralph picks up a large and rock and says that it would serve their purposes if no one knew El Cuco existed. El Cuco takes on the appearance of all the people that it's duplicated, and Holly returns to see Ralph beat in El Cuco's head. He sees Holly, and she turns and leaves.

Ralph and Holly take Claude back to the cars, and Claude stares at Seale's body. Ralph and Yunis drag Jack's body away, and Holly looks at Andy's body and then continues walking When Ralph finds her, Holly says that Andy only came there to be with her. Ralph says that they need to get their stories straight before the authorities arrive, and once the others leave, Ralph looks at the bodies and kneels in the dirt.

In his office Hayes is looking at the footage from the strip club. Yunis calls and tells Hayes that there was a shootout, and Alec, Howie, and Jack are dead. He tells Jack that was compelled to kill by someone else, and the killer is still out there. Yunis claims that the killer is still on the loose, and sends Hayes a link to the video. He advises Hayes that some of the decisions coming out of his office need to be revisited.

Ralph tells the local detectives that Seale got a call from someone who claimed to have knowledge of a more like suspect in Frankie's killing.

Yunis has Claude review his testimony that Ralph and Yunis came to question him because he identified Terry at the club. Claude claims that he made a mistake and the killer was someone who looked like Terry.

Hayes goes over the transcripts from the witnesses who identified Terry, and looks at the video of El Cuco from Cavestock.

Ralph says that the trail lead to the cave's souvenir shop and Jack. He says that he thought the phone call was to set up an ambush.

Claude wonders how long they'll keep Seale's body. Holly tells him hopefully not long, and Yunis continues going over the story they came up with.

Holly tells a police interrogator how she met Andy, and she recommended the others hire Andy as part of their team. Once the interrogator leaves, Holly breaks into tears.

Once Ralph finishes answering the detectives, he calls Jeannie and says that he needs her to do something so they can pull off their story.

That night, Jeannie goes to see Grace at her home. She tells her that what's important is that when the police ask Grace about the meeting with Holly, Grace tells them that Holly said nothing about shapeshifters or anything sounding supernatural. Grace says that she can do that. Jeannie returns home and burns the chair El Cuco sat on when he visited her.

Ralph walks out of the Cecil police station.

The next day, Hayes visits Grace and says that they have avenues of inquiry in Frankie's murder. He says that they're reopening the case, and they've reexamined the perp DNA and had a mixture of samples that makes the evidence unreliable. Jessa and Maya listen from the stairs, and Grace tells them to go upstairs. Once they do, Hayes says that he's holding a press conference to announce the opening of the investigation and officially go on record that he's dropping the charges against Terry. He says that because her pending lawsuits against him and his office, he can't tell her the full story. Grace admits that she understands and ushers him out. Her daughters come back and ask if Hayes were mean to her. She says that he wasn't, and they hug.

At home, Ralph finds Holly packing to go back to her home. He suggests that he wouldn't mind teaming up with her again if the opportunity arose, and Holly tells him that El Cuco asks her about why she was open to believing in his existence. She says that her father was ex-military and when she was little, he told her that a man would know a man. Holly tells Ralph that an outsider knows an outsider, and they hug. As Holly goes, Ralph asks what else is out there. She just shrugs and smiles at him, and leaves.

Later, Ralph brings in his bags from the trip.

Holly goes to the funeral home where they're holding Andy's service and lights candles.

At the cemetery, Ralph tells Jeannie that he saw Derek and he spoke to her. He says that it wasn't Derek, but the vision told him to let him go. Jeannie jokingly says that there's no chance of that, and Ralph chuckles. He then tells her that the whole experience cracked the world open for him, and Jeannie suggests that after many years they'll just visit their son's grave. The two of them lay flowers on Derek's grave and leave. Nearby, Frankie lies buried.

Back in her apartment, Holly washes up and imagines seeing Jack in the mirror behind her. She turns but no one is there. Examining the back of her neck, Holly confirms that there's no sign of El Cuco's mark. She goes to her laptop and confirms via the Internet that Terry was exonerated. She toys with her hair and stares at the screen while the radio plays Washington Square by The Village Stompers, the song Ralph played when his mother died when he was 16 and that he heard again 15 years later on the exact night when his son Derek was born and that he told Holly about while driving to Cecil with her (in episode 8 ""Foxhead"")."

U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens strolls down a boardwalk and joins a con at a table. Raylan informs him he has two minutes. The con recounts the story of how Raylan pulled a gun on him yesterday and told him he had 24 hours to get out of town or he'd shoot him on sight.

The con doesn't believe him and doesn't want to go. He doesn't think Givens will shoot an unarmed man, as he claims to be.

Givens tells him he's got 30 seconds. He counts down. Time runs out. The con pulls a gun. Givens beats him to the draw and shoots him dead.

Later, Givens's boss checks to make sure that Givens knows they're not actually allowed to shoot people on sight anymore.

At another date and time, Givens and his boss meet with the Department of Justice about the shooting. Givens reiterates that ""he pulled first, I shot him.""

In the parking garage, Givens's boss tells him he's being reassigned to the Eastern district of Kentucky. Givens grew up in Kentucky, he doesn't want to go there but has no choice.

Lexington, Kentucky:

Givens reports to work. His new boss is Chief Deputy Art Mullen, an old friend, who suggests they start with a drink.

He has a ""Tombstone"" poster on his office wall.

Givens did fugitive work before, but in Kentucky he'll be doing that, plus witness relocation, asset forfeitures and prisoner transport.

He tells Givens that his ex-wife Winona is still in town, working at the courthouse.

He tells him about a case the U.S. Attorney is trying to put together on someone from his hometown named Boyd Crowder. Givens knows him. They dug coal together when they were 19.

Cut to Boyd with a dude named Jarrett, checking out a federal building under construction and saying it's not a good target for their rocket launcher.

Boyd has a huge swastika on his shoulder. This perhaps explains why he then gets out of his car and aims it at a black church. He shouts ""fire in the hole"" and blasts it.

In a bar, Givens tells Mullen a story about coal digging, which involves shouting ""fire in the hole"" before a charge blows. Mullen catches Givens up to speed on Boyd, who got into domestic terrorist type activities after a stint in the army. Now he comes into towns, blows up a car and uses the distraction to rob a bank. Raylan notes that he saw that once in a Steve McQueen movie.

Boyd pitches his rocket launcher into a river. He asks Jarrett why he didn't want to blow up the church, and why he suggested a half-built building. He suspects Jarrett is FBI and that's the kind of innocuous target they'd be willing to sacrifice to get someone into the movement. Boyd's in the backseat as Jared protests that he's not a snitch and to check with his people in Oklahoma. ""We'll see,"" Boyd says as he shoots Jared through the back of the head.

Boyd calls into a trailer full of neo-Nazis. He reports on the evening and his crony tells him, by the way, Jared checked out in Oklahoma. Oh.

The next day, Givens goes to the courthouse to watch court reporter Winona. He gets a call and leaves.

He arrives on the scene of Jarrett's murder, where Mullens tells him they think it was Boyd. The car and gun have been wiped clean. They found the cap of a rocket launcher.

Givens goes to the church bombing site. One of the witnesses heard someone shout ""fire in the hole.""

The church is Jamaican (the kind that believes marijuana is a way to spirituality, Mullens explains) and Givens gets the preacher to cooperate with a well-timed Peter Tosh reference.

Back at the neo-Nazi trailer, one of the brothers gives Boyd the news that his brother has been shot.

""What, where?"" Boyd says.

""At his house.""

""No, dumba---, where on his body?""

""I don't know.""

""Well, is it serious?""

""Oh yea, he's dead.""

Back at the office, Givens learns that Bowman Crowder was shot by his wife Ava, who said she got tired of him getting drunk and beating her. She's already been arraigned and released without bond.

Raylan pays her a visit. They say an awkward hello and she kisses him full on the mouth. She confesses to having a crush on him since she was 12.

She tells him she told Bowman she wanted a divorce and he told her her body would never be found. She tells him about Bowman's plans to get into the NFL never materializing and him blaming her for her miscarriage after he beat her with a belt. The last time he beat her it was because she called his brother Boyd creepy to his face. She calmly tells Raylan how he knocked her into the stove and she knew it would be the last time he beat her. So the next night she fixed his favorite dinner, waited until he was shoveling it in and then blew him away with a .30'06 deer rifle. There's still a blood stain on the floor.

Raylan waits as she gets in the shower.

Boyd's flunky walks in the front door. Raylan sizes him up and asks to see the guy's swastika tattoo. From the guy's gator necklace, which he boasts he made himself, Raylan puts him as being from Florida. Belle Glade, he confirms. The guy is Dewey Crow.

Raylan remembers sending away a Crow away in Florida.

He says he's there to take Ava some place. Raylan sends him outside to knock on the front door properly. Instead, Dewey goes to his trunk and grabs a shotgun.

Raylan coolly sets down his drink and walks outside as Dewey points the scatter gun in his face. Raylan warns him he only draws his ""sidearm"" if he's shooting to kill. Dewey thinks he's got him already, but Raylan asks if he'll be able to rack a load before he shoots him dead. Dewey pauses to think.

Raylan walks right up to him and takes the gun out of his hands.

""Man, I don't understand you,"" Dewey whines.

Raylan tells Dewey to tell Boyd he's back in town. He empties Dewey's gun and gives it back to him. Back in his car, Dewey starts to talk tough and Raylan bounces Dewey's face off the steering wheel.

Boyd and one of his guys wait in a truck outside a bank as fire engines race past to a fire. Boyd explains he won't kill Ava, she didn't have a choice. But he intends to take care of her. Suddenly two overweight neo-Nazis run out of the bank with masks on and hop in the getaway truck. Boyd drives off.

Back at Ava's, Raylan explains that they want to catch Boyd in the act.

Cut to Raylan driving up to Boyd in a former church. They greet each other like old friends, hugs and all.

Boyd sends his guy for a jar of 'shine and two glasses.

They share the moonshine and Boyd asks if Raylan has seen his dad yet. He remembers a scheme the father used to run stealing machinery and selling to the Colombians and getting paid in cocaine.

Boyd is soon telling Raylan his theory that Jewish people run the world. This leads into more unevolved racist theories he links to the Bible. Raylan tells him he thinks he's just using the Bible to justify what he likes: money and blowing s--- up.

He knows about Boyd's pal's dope record and thinks that, and not racism, is why he blew up the black church -- because they didn't like the Jamaicans getting a free pass for drugs from the police.

He thinks Boyd isn't dumb enough to believe his racist talk.

Boyd asks him if when he shot the con in Miami, he saw his father's face.

Raylan bristles, but tells him to come down for a police line-up tomorrow.

As he's leaving, Boyd asks Raylan if he'd shoot him if he had the chance. If he makes him draw, Raylan says, he'll put him down.

At the line up, the preacher won't make an ID.

After, Boyd brings up the 24 hours Raylan gave the con to get out of Miami. Boyd offers Raylan the same deal.

Raylan runs into Ava in the courthouse. She says if she pleads to manslaughter she won't have to go to prison. She offers to cook Raylan dinner. He says as a Marshal he's not allowed to socialize with witnesses. She says she's cooking anyway.

Outside, Boyd's lackies watch the two of them.

Raylan tells Mullen about Boyd's 24 hour threat. Mullen says that makes him bait.

Boyd's guys follow Raylan to a motel and watch him with other marshals.

There's a knock at Ava's door. It's Boyd.

She calls Raylan and tells him dinner's almost ready. Raylan knows Boyd is there.

Raylan, Mullen and a few other deputies leave in separate cars. Boyd's guys cut off Mullen's truck and open a hail of fire. He calls Raylan and tells him to keep going. Another car follows him.

Back in front of the motel, Mullen and his deputies engage in a good old fashioned shoot out. Mullen gives the order to just wing them. The neo-Nazis are soon wounded but ready to keep shooting until a black female deputy gets the drop on them.

Out on the way to Ava's, Raylan is clearly being followed. He stops and when his pursuers stop, stealthily approaches Boyd's guys. He gets Dewey's back seat. He fires a shot through their car roof with the scatter gun and cuffs them.

Raylan pulls up to Ava's carrying the shotgun. Boyd greets him with a gun pointed at him. Raylan drops the shotgun and Boyd puts his on the table and goes back to eating Ava's food after sending her in the other room.

He's chatty, asking about the shooting in Miami. Raylan tells him his gun was holstered. They're sitting at opposite ends of the table, just like in Miami. Boyd says Raylan's time is up.

With his gun on the table, Boyd is amping up to draw, but Ava comes around the corner with her late husband's deer rifle. She aims it at Boyd as she tells him about shooting his brother.

Boyd goes for his gun, but in a flash Raylan grabs his from his holster and shoots Boyd clean through the gut and out of his chair. Raylan stands over Boyd. ""You did it, you really did,"" Boyd gasps.

""I'm sorry. You called it,"" Raylan tells him.

Flash to them in the mines during a cave in. He tells Ava they dug coal together.

Later, an ambulance takes Boyd away. Mullen wonders why he didn't aim for the heart.

In a cul de sac house, a man gets out of bed in the middle of the night. He finds Raylan sitting in his living room, drinking beer. The former Mrs. Givens comes downstairs.

They talk outside. He tells her about tracking a money launderer to Nicaragua, where the cartel's gun thug Tommy was looking for him, too. Tommy got the drop on him and put him in a car with another man. At a plantation Tommy tied the man to a palm tree and asked Raylan where the money launderer was. He told him what he knew, but Tommy must not have believed him because he stuck a stick of dynamite in the man's mouth and lit the fuse.

The next time Raylan saw Tommy was Miami. He told him he had 24 hours to get out of town or he was going to kill him.

""He pulled first, so I was justified,"" Raylan says.

What troubles him, though, is what if Tommy hadn't drawn and he'd killed him anyway. He never thought of himself as an angry man.

Kindly, Winona tells him: ""Honestly, you're the angriest man I have ever known."""

Well, Amen, brother -- but we have business to attend to elsewhere. And that business: escort Dewey from prison to home. Givens lets Dewey drive (generous) and the little white supremacist gabs on and on about his pappy, who has never left Kentucky. We imagine the conversation reminds Givens of his own daddy. Dewey then makes the mistake of trying to hit Givens when his guard is down. Only problem: Givens' guard is never down. Seconds later, the car is stopped and Dewey's already broken nose spitting blood. Givens handcuffs the criminal's wrist to the wheel -- and makes him drive anyway.

Was Givens justified? Damn right he was. The title card says so.

Later, a pair of officers escorts a batch of prisoners to a fancy rich-person party. Turns out the inmates are part of a performing band called the ""Big House Boys."" The drummer, Price (Myk Watford), asks to use the restroom -- and, once alone with the guard, bashes him in the face with what looks to be a shovel. So Givens gets a call from Mullen, who explains that Price and bass player Cooper (Chris Ellis) made a break for it. Givens pulls over at the first gas station he sees. Sure enough, Price is behind the counter pretending to be the attendant. Givens is about to draw when Coop appears holding shotgun. ""Set your weapon down on the ground, please"" the polite escaped con says. Coop then points his shotgun at Price, telling the drummer to get the hell out -- and fast.

So now it's just Givens and Coop. The con looks at Givens' badge and recognizes the last name. Turns out Coop knows Arlo Givens -- our hero's father. Coop takes Givens' gun, badge and hat before locking the Deputy U.S. Marshall in the store and leaving. ""Well, shit,"" Givens says to no one in particular. The next day, Mullen ribs Givens for letting the escapee go. Luckily, Givens' hat and car were found. ""You starting to regret me coming here?"" Givens asks. So the search is on for Coop, who broke out of prison despite the fact that he only had three months left to serve. On the way out of the station, Winona appears to chew out Givens for breaking into her house and scaring Gary. ""I won't show up unannounced anymore,"" Givens promises. We're not sure he really means it, though.

Givens and Tim then head out to interview Shirley Kelso (Kristin Bauer), Coop's ex-wife. ""If he turns up, you'll be the first person I call,"" she claims. Of course, moments after the Marshalls leave, Coop shows up to confront his ex and her ""cousin"" Dupree (Johnny Sneed, who is likely her boyfriend). Turns out the two had been tearing up houses searching for a large amount of cash that Coop hid before going to prison. The escapee admits that he hid the money in a house that was under construction years ago. Shirley and Dupree beg to be part of the team. Coop agrees -- but only because Dupree is familiar with new-fangled alarms.

Later, Givens shows up at his hotel to find Ava on his bed. ""I can't sleep with you, Ava,"" he says. ""I can't be getting amorous with a witness in a shooting I was involved in."" They share a drink -- and Ava coyly agrees to sleep on the floor. Cut to Coop, Shirley and Dupree, who drive past the house where Coop hid the money years ago. They quickly break into the house, which is luckily unoccupied. Much drilling and tearing up the floorboards later, the money appears to be gone. ""Let me get this straight,"" Dupree asks. ""After all this time, you have no idea where the money is?"" Coop admits that he doesn't -- so Dupree shoots the escaped convict in the chest. Shirley apologizes (and seems genuine), but the related lovers leave the old man to die in the empty house.

Givens, meanwhile, reads an article about floorboards being torn up in the Riverbrook housing complex (the handiwork of Shirley and Dupree, who have been randomly looking for Coop's stash for months). He quickly leaves Ava asleep in the bed (turns out Givens took the floor) and drives with Rachel to Riverbrook. ""Oh, shit!"" Givens exclaims. There in the street is Coop, bleeding profusely from his stomach. Coop explains that he couldn't find the money -- and was shot for it. ""I thought I broke out because of the money, but then I saw Shirley...."" the old man trails off.

So how did Dupree know where the money is? Turns out Coop based his directions to the stash on the location of a nearby school. Rachel points out that a second school was built years ago. Coop was going off the wrong school! Cut to the house, where Shirley and Dupree have taped the upper-class couple to back-to-back chairs. The couple bickers back and forth. ""I told you we shouldn't have taken the money!"" the woman says. We soon figure out that the two found the cash while doing some plumbing. ""Where was your second guessing when you got your new boobs?!"" the man responds. He then explains that the money is all gone -- spent on plastic surgery, a boat and TVs. Upon hearing that the man is wearing $700 shoes, Dupree shoots him in the foot.

Outside, officers have surrounded the place and get ready to go inside. The gunshot hurries them along a bit. Givens decides to enter the house with his firearm holstered. ""If you move too fast from where you're standing, you're dead,"" the marshal patiently explains. Asks Dupree: ""Do you really think you can draw and fire before one of us pulls the trigger?"" Dumb question, of course. Yet this time Givens lets someone else do the killing. When Dupree makes a move, he is shot dead through the window by Tim, who was a sniper in Afghanistan. A frightened Shirley immediately puts down her weapon. She didn't like Dupree much anyway -- especially after he shot her husband.

Speaking of Coop, we find the convict heading back to prison. Givens explains that the couple in the house found the money. Coop shrugs -- and tries to defend his wife. ""Maybe we'll get out about the same time,"" he tells Givens. ""Man, she looked good."""

Givens is casual, however -- he's heard this story before. Turns out pops has served plenty of the time over the years and is known for a bad temper. ""Good thing he didn't pass that on,"" says a sarcastic Mullen. Later, Gutterson hands Givens a case file. Rachel explains that the rookie cop in the office has to ""handle"" Pinter -- a duty that is now being passed from Gutterson to Givens. So Givens visits Pinter at a nearby bar, where the fast-talking Brooklyn native explains that he is a freelance ""fixer"" and bookie. Givens asks the man if he has anything of use to the Marshals -- and Pinter just grins.

Back at the office, Rachel runs down the case of an escaped con named Tiny, who pulled apart his shackles before putting two officers in the ICU. ""I get the feeling 'Tiny' is meant to be ironic,"" Givens quips. Turns out Pinter fed Givens the name. He also gave the Marshal the name of the man's common-law wife. ""Sooner or later, he'll be back to Sherese,"" Givens says. Sure enough, the cops soon raid the woman's apartment -- and find Tiny tied to the bed in his underwear. Tiny likes the kinky stuff, apparently.

Later, Givens and Ava shoot pool and flirt -- though the conversation quickly takes a turn toward Givens's ex-wife. Ava asks if Givens came back to Kentucky for his former gal. Givens shakes his head. ""As soon as I get reassigned, I am gone,"" he says.

The next morning, a collector named Curtis, who works for Pinter, pays a visit to Travis Travers, a playboy who didn't pay up when he lost. The two banter back and forth before Travers confesses that he doesn't have $18,000. Curtis pulls out a pair of shears and warns: ""I'm gonna start pruning things on you."" Travers then offers Curtis a deal: ""What if I told you you could get 10 or 20 times that much?"" Curtis lowers the shears. He's listening.

Givens, meanwhile, heads to the bar to give Pinter his cut of the reward for the Tiny-collar -- but the bookie/snitch is gone. ""Something is making my neck hair stand up,"" Givens tells Mullen back at the office.

Givens shags an address for Pinter and heads to the home, where he runs into none other than Travers. ""I just watch the place while he's away,"" says Travers, who explains that Pinter is on vacation. The man is obviously lying, but Givens lets him go for the time being. Travers then rushes back to his own pad, where Curtis has Pinter tied up in a chair with a bag over his head. Turns out Travers was about to search Pinter's house for money when Givens showed up. ""It's time to accelerate the situation,"" Travers says. A short time later, Pinter's girlfriend Samantha is dragged into the room. Curtis threatens to clip her fingers off -- and Pinter explains that he knows she's in on the scheme. ""You're the only one I told about the escape fund,"" Pinter gasps.

So Pinter's gal betrayed her boyfriend to Travers, who had no choice but to cut Curtis into the plan.

""You said we weren't actually going to hurt him!"" Samantha protests. She then looks out the window and spots Givens wandering around the property. Curtis heads outside to confront the Marshal. ""You like Westerns?"" the collector asks while reaching as if to draw. Bad move. Givens causally and quickly draws his own weapon -- all the while explaining the mechanics and potential risk in such a move. Curtis backs down, but his ears perk up when Givens explains that he only wants to give Pinter $10,000. Curtis kindly offers to hold onto it for Pinter. Givens pretends to agree -- and volunteers to head back to the office to retrieve the reward. Inside, Curtis explains to Travers that the Marshal is going to return with $5000(!) for Pinter.

And when that happens? ""Oh, I'm gonna put a hole through his head,"" Curtis brags. (We'll see about THAT, bub.)

With Givens away, Curtis proposes ""practicing"" a draw contest with Travers. We think Curtis is just looking for a ruse to kill Travers, but it's Travers who shoots a hole in the collector's chest! Curtis falls dead into the pool.

""What happened to your stress techniques?!"" a terrified Samantha asks. Travers explains that it's far too late to play nice with Pinter and threatens to cut off the man's unmentionables. Just then, the doorbell rings. It's Givens, who knows exactly what he's getting into, of course.

Travers lets the Marshal inside. Travers walks casually through the living room before grabbing a gun and FIRING on Givens. He misses -- and Givens quickly calls in backup (as if he needed it). Samantha, meanwhile, has had a change of heart. She frees Pinter, retrieves Curtis's handgun and passes it to the now freed Pinter who immediately fires through a door -- mistakenly hitting Givens!

""Holy shit, Marshal!"" Pinter screams. But Givens never flinches. He hears another door opening behind him and, just like Pinter, fires deliberately through at it. The door slowly swings open to reveal Travers with two exsanguinating bullet holes in his chest slumping to the floor. Justified? You better believe it, pal.

Naturally, Givens was wearing a bullet-proof vest the entire time.

Later, Pinter claims that Samantha was a hostage, too -- and not part of the plan to rob him. ""Is that your story?"" Givens asks the bookie. Explains Pinter: ""She was only doing what I taught her to do."" He then explains that he plans to use the reward money to get out of town for good. Sounds like a good deal. Givens pays the man.

Case closed, but not the episode.

Later that night, Givens visits Ava. ""What would happen if I found something here that made me not want to leave?"" he asks. He then leans in and passionately kisses Ava.

We tastefully fade to black."

Dr. Peter Oldham gives dental work in exchange for food. And what does he get for his trouble? Grief from a Bluetooth-wearing blowhard complaining about the dirty office and the receptionist, Mindy. So, Peter snaps -- and follows the man to his SUV. ""You don't want to pay me?"" the dentist asks. ""That's OK, but I'm going to take back what's mine! Consider me the repo man."" The good dentist than proceeds to rip two teeth out of the man's head. Was it justified?

Later, Mullen explains the case to Givens, who immediately recognizes the dentist as Roland Pike, someone the ""cartel"" and the Marshals Service have been looking for. Mullen is sending Givens to look into the case along with Rachel. ""And you're going to love this part: Rachel is taking lead,"" Mullen says. Sure enough, Givens doesn't love it. Cut back to sunny L.A., where Givens learns that Roland acquired a dental degree in Panama while on the run from the cops and the cartel. We also learn that Roland gave Givens the slip some years ago.

While Givens and Rachel chat with the local FBI guys, Mindy leaves the office with a container of tamales. She heads straight for Roland's car up the block -- and reveals that the tamales hide small bars of gold. Getaway money. The two go over their plans to sell the gold and then head to Belize, where they'll open up another office to help kids. Mindy wonders why 20 FBI guys are now staking out her BF's office. ""I got a lot of unpaid parking tickets,"" Roland says. Unbelievably, Mindy appears to believe him (or pretends to).

Later, Roland admits to Mindy that he used to work for ""some really bad men ... I was their accountant."" Roland then stole from the drug cartel and ran. Mindy is amazingly understanding. ""Don't lie anymore, OK?"" she says. ""You'll break my heart."" Fair enough. So while Mindy is trading gold for cash, Roland heads to the parking lot to steal a car. An old man with a fake leg hobbles over and calls him on it -- then suggests taking Rolands's old (hot) car in exchange for looking the other way. Roland agrees.

Cut to Givens and Rachel interviewing folks from Mindy's apartment complex. Givens gets Mindy's cell from a woman named Shawni. Moments later, Givens calls Mindy and asks to speak to Roland. ""I suppose you're still really mad at me, huh?"" Roland asks. Givens just grins. ""You know what's going to happen to you and Ms. Springer if the bad guys find you before I do?"" he asks. Roland, who knows exactly what will happen, hangs up in a huff and immediately ditches the phone. At the same time, the old man is being pulled over by a pair of cops. He claims to have found the vehicle ""in your sister's ass.""

Meanwhile, two cartel members spot Givens in the crowd of police (it's not hard with the cowboy hat). Turns out Givens shot one of their business associates, Tommy Buck. ""The cowboy goes?"" one of the men asks the other. The answer: ""We stay on him until he brings us to Rollie, then we clip 'em both."" Uh oh.

Roland then visits one of his patients. ""Mindy and I need to get into Mexico,"" he explains. ""We need someone who knows how to get across without getting caught."" Mrs. Pena is offended. ""You come to me because we're Mexican?!"" As it turns out, though, Mrs. Pena's father does know a way -- and offers to help. Mrs. Pena sneaks into her kitchen and immediately dials 9-1-1.

By the time cops arrive, however, Roland and Mindy are gone. The old man admits that he set Roland up with an escort across the border. ""You should know that without proper information, bad men will find your dentist friend before I can"". Givens explains. ""They'll kill him and the girl."" The old man gives up the location of where Roland is meeting the escort. Afterward, Givens unexpectedly confronts the two cartel goons, sliding into the back seat of their car like an old friend. The cowboy then gives the goons two options. The first: go back to Miami NOW. And the second option? ""Next time I see you, I kill you.""

Cut to Roland and Mindy, who meet their border-crossing guide in the middle of nowhere. Givens isn't far behind, of course. He finds the couple's stolen car -- and the engine is still hot. Just then, the goons pull up behind the marshal, who stands in the middle of the deserted street with his hand on his gun. It's an old-fashioned stand off. ""You take one more step and I'm gonna shoot you -- that's all I'm going to say,"" Givens warns. The goon takes a single step forward -- and Givens shoots him in the chest. The other goon tries to draw -- and Givens shoots him in the chest. Justified. Twice.

Roland and Mindy, meanwhile, are walking through the desert when their guide suddenly demands twice the money they agreed to. The guide then stabs Roland and tries to rape Mindy. Bad idea. Roland picks up the biggest rock that he can pick up and BASHES the guide in the head. ""I yank a guy's teeth out and then I kill a guy,"" Roland says to Mindy. ""You got to get away from me!"" Mindy comforts the doc, telling him that she knows he is a good guy because he traded dental work for food. It's true love, apparently. So the couple gets walking again -- and Givens isn't far behind.

""Hello, Rollie,"" Givens says. ""You all right?"" Roland agrees to be led into custody when a figure on a nearby hill starts SHOOTING. It's the cartel. ""Looks like we got a sniper on the Mexican side,"" Givens explains. Roland then explains that dentistry has been his calling since childhood -- and he knows that the witness protection program won't allow him to work on teeth. Roland then begins to stand up. ""You get those handcuffs ready!"" he says. ""I love you, Mindy."" The sniper opens fire -- and kills Roland. Mindy screams. Givens sighs heavily. It's as if the dentist chose to die rather than live an unfulfilled life.

On the long ride home, Rachel takes the hat off of a sleeping Givens and tries it on. ""Does it fit?"" Givens mutters. No, says Rachel. It doesn't fit her at all."

He exits the van and knocks on the door of the small house, pretending to be an out-of-work landscaper looking for work. The ex-wife tells Givens to ""do what you want, but I ain't paying you."" So now Givens has yard work to do.

Cut to an old man twirling a baseball bat. It's the dead of night and the old dude breaks into a ramshackle house and starts destroying the decor. Sometime later, a cop wakes the old man, who has fallen asleep on the couch. Turns the old guy is none other than Arlo Givens, who actually owns the place. He rents it out and smashed up the stuff belonging to Perkins, an occupant late in paying rent. Later, the cop takes Arlo away and Perkins rushes to the bedroom, removing a panel from a closet. Whatever was behind that panel is now gone. Perkins appears quite concerned.

Later that night, Givens explains the case to Ava, who is more interested in giving the Deputy Marshal a backrub. They are soon rolling around naked in bed -- when Ava's cell phone suddenly begins to ring. She ignores it. After the love making is finished, however, Givens checks the call: His father is in jail. Again.

Givens meets Helen, Arlo's girlfriend, at a local diner. She teases Givens about knowing to call Ava to reach him -- and then asks the boy to bail out his father. Givens isn't pleased, but heads to the jail anyway. Later, Perkins bursts through the front door of Arlo's house to find Helen. ""Arlo took something of mine and I want it back,"" he says. ""I had something valuable. I put it there -- and now it's not there anymore."" Helen grabs a knife and takes a swing at Perkins' hulking ""nephews,"" but misses. They violently throw her to floor.

Father and son, meanwhile, drive home. ""How many men you shot?"" dad asks. ""All the shit I pulled over the years, I never shot anyone. Not a one.""

They arrive home to find the door busted. Inside, Helen is cleaning up shattered plates. Arlo becomes furious -- and starts searching for his baseball bat. ""Arlo is up to something,"" Givens tells Helen. For right now, however, Arlo has revenge on his mind. He heads to the diner, where the two hulking nephews sit and eat. Using a ruse of paying them, Arlo pulls out his baseball bat and starts swinging. After getting in some vicious licks, he collapses into a booth, clutching his chest. Uh oh.

Later, Givens does yard work for the ex-wife of the fugitive, but still hasn't been invited inside. He decides to up the ante by asking to use the restroom. Inside, he spots the fugitive and pulls the man aside. ""I didn't want to make a scene in front of your kids,"" Givens says. ""I'm a Deputy U.S. Marshal and I'm here to arrest you on a outstanding warrant."" The fugitive makes a move to run and Givens tackles the man, cuffing him. ""Let him go!"" the ex-wife screams. She is holding a large shotgun. Givens talks her down, promising leniency for the mother of two. Case closed. But not the episode.

Givens heads to the local police department and learns that Perkins has recently finished a six-year prison term for illegally selling pharmaceuticals. Interesting.

Givens then heads to the hospital, where Arlo is busy flirting with nurses. Arlo then tells Givens that he once rebelled against his own father, a preacher. Givens doesn't appear too interested -- and warns his father not to underestimate Perkins.

Later, Givens visits bar owner Johnny, Boyd's cousin. Givens wants information on Perkins, but Johnny proposes Givens work for it. The two used to play ball together, apparently, so Johnny throws Givens three pitches in the ally. After making Givens bail-out on the first pitch, Givens hits the final pitch hard, making Johnny duck. Johnny explains that Perkins is once again moving prescription drugs.

So Givens visits Perkins -- and explains that the rented house used to belong to Helen. Givens would escape to the place as a kid when Arlo was raging. ""Want to know my favorite hiding spot?"" Givens asks. ""Come here. I'll show you."" Givens then picks up his father's baseball bat and herds Perkins toward the bedroom closet. He removes the panel and discover a bags of drugs. Perkins tries to run, but Givens hits the man in the shins with the bat. Like father, like son. Perkins claims he had no idea that there were drugs in the closet. ""The last time I looked in there, it was empty,"" he cries. So what was in there? Perkins explains he had $75,000 in drugs behind the panel... until Arlo broke in.

So Givens heads back to the hospital and commands ""Helen, go outside and have a Menthol.""

Arlo says. ""You think I got stolen drugs? Get a warrant. Search the house.""

Says Givens: ""I know the OxyContin is gone and I know the money you got from it is probably buried underneath the ground... but what you didn't think about is what I'd do when I found out about you. I got you out of jail. At the very least, I'll get you back in.""

Givens then accuses Helen of planning that bag of drugs in Perkins' closet.

She protests -- too much. Givens storms away. Nothing like family to ruin a cowboy's weekend.

He visits the family plot next to his father's house where his mother is buried. He looks at his own tombstone, and turns away, confident that he knows where his father has stashed his ill-gotten cash."

Once again, the criminal goes on and on about his ""ministry"" before Givens interrupts him with a question about Arlo. ""I want to know everything you know about what he's up to,"" Givens says. Boyd warns Givens that he would do better to worry about his immortal soul -- and he might have a point. Givens is one violent dude.

Later, a half-naked Ava awakens a fully naked Givens. The two are sharing a hotel bed again -- and the topic of living together arises. ""You're tarnished with the dark stain of D-I-V-O-R-C-E,"" Ava jokes. The talk soon turns serious, though -- as some of the men who made Ava's past life so miserable are soon due to be released from jail. ""I ain't leaving,"" she says. Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. It's Mullen, who admonishes Givens for not checking his cell phone. The marshal and his boss have to drive to Cincinnati. ""Tell me that wasn't Ava in there,"" Mullen says. Givens can tell him no such thing.

The pair arrives in Cincinnati and head to an art gallery. They ask about a man named Owen, who tried to sell some art to the place. Owens apparently stole a bunch of money some years back -- a small-time Madoff. The gallery owner takes the marshals to Owen's home, which contains an extensive art collection. They explain to Owen that all his assets will become property of the U.S. government. The news doesn't faze the man, who shows the gallery owner his ""Hitler"" paintings. ""You mean Adolf Hitler?"" Mullen asks.

Givens then questions Owen's young wife -- and explains that her husband has been served with an ""order of forfeiture.""

""He thought he was so smart,"" the wife says. ""All his Jew lawyers can't help him now. I bet he never told them about this Hitler collection.""

Offended, Givens leaves. Back inside, the gallery owner declares the Hitlers to be fakes. Considering he paid $300,000 for the paintings, Owen is angry. After Givens and Mullen leave, Owen and his wife berate David, the man who sold Owen the Hitler. David claims the gallery owner is lying. ""He wants to get them from you for cheap!"" David says. Just then, Greg the horse trainer enters -- and shoots Owen in the head.

David is horrified. ""Why?!"" he gasps. Snaps the sudden widow: ""They can't put a dead man on trial. The case against Owen will be dismissed!"" She then warns David that he did sell Owen fake Hitlers -- on her suggestion -- which would ruin his reputation if revealed. So David agrees to play along. Later, the cops arrive to arrest Owen, but discover him dead -- seemingly from a suicide (he is holding the gun). Givens isn't buying it, though. He notes that most suicide victims fail to hold onto the weapon.

But Givens has bigger problems. Back at the office, he is introduced to agent David Vasquez. ""I'm looking into your shootings,"" Vasquez says. ""Would really like to talk to you."" Givens swears that the mobster he shot way back in the first episode ""pulled first."" In other words, the killing was justified. Now it's Vasquez's turn not to buy it.

Later, Winona visits Givens -- and asks for a favor. ""I need you to run some names,"" she said. ""I wouldn't ask you this if it wasn't really important."" Givens, after explaining the illegality of such a request, grudgingly agrees.

Meanwhile, David is being interviewed by Gutterson, who explains that something was burned in Owen's fireplace the night of his death, but it wasn't the Hitlers. David appears surprised. ""We don't know where the paintings are,"" Gutterson admits. Givens then visits his ex-wife's new husband, Gary, a Realtor. Givens then begins talking about the state of the housing market ""People must be doing some desperate things,"" the marshal says. ""You've seen any of that?"" Gary squirms -- and with good reason.

Givens pulls the man close and warns him about ""dragging"" Winona down into any illegal shenanigans. Gary appears terrified, which is more than justified given Givens history of violence.

Cut to David confronting Owen's wife about the non-burned Hitlers. She explains that she decided to hold onto the paintings as ""insurance."" Even worse, she demands David's share of the sales: $150,000. ""If you don't get it, those paintings will reappear and everyone will know you sold fakes,"" she sneers. David would appear to have no choice. Later, Givens visits Mrs. Owens -- and asks about her relationship his horse-trainer Greg. Givens then asks about the paintings. Which paintings? ""The ones you burned in place of your husband's Hitler paintings,"" Givens says. Mrs. Owen flinches -- and storms out.

Later, Mrs. Owen runs to Greg. She tells him that Givens ""knows"" about the paintings. She then pressures him to deal with David, who has yet to give up the $150,000. After Mrs. Owen leaves, Givens enters to talk with Greg. The marshal tells a long story about wanting to shoot his ex-wife's new husband at one point, but ""where would it end?"" The answer: nowhere good. The horse trainer, who has been holding a pistol on he marshal under the desk (which Givens surmises) seems to take the story to heart.

David soon arrives -- to find the furniture covered in tarps. Uh oh. Sure enough, Greg punches David out cold before leveling a gun at him. Mrs. Owens urges the horse trainer to shoot, but he hesitates. Finally, Greg lowers the gun -- and announces that he isn't going to do it. The police, who have been waiting in the next room the entire time, enter. ""I'm sorry,"" Greg tells Mrs. Owens, who is cuffed and led outside. Case closed.

But not the episode. Winona visits Givens at his place -- wondering about the names she asked him to run through the system. First, though, Givens admits he ""played his part"" in the divorce. He then explains that he didn't find ""anything out of the ordinary"" in relation to the names. Winona thanks her ex and then takes her leave.

Later, Givens pays a visit to the gallery owner, who explains that his German father once worked for Hitler. ""I hated my father,"" the owner says. ""So I buy Hitler's shitty paintings -- and I burn them."" He shows the marshal his private ""art collection,"" shelves of jars holding the cremains of der Fuhrer's canvases.

Finally, Givens visits Boyd again. ""I want you to forget about Arlo,"" Givens says. ""I met a man whose whole life was crippled. I'm just going to let that old dog lie."""

Suddenly, Johnny Crowder enters and begins asking about rope to tie up a deer, a shovel to dig a hole and, oh yeah, a chainsaw. The implication is clear: Ava is a dead woman. Ava smirks and tells the shop owner to ""put it on my tab,"" referring to the items on shopping list.

The shop-keeper's wife has been listening, and orders Johnny out of the store at shotgun point. Retorts Johnny on the way out: ""Tell Raylan I said 'hey.'""

Later, Givens visits Ava -- and finds her packing her bags. She is considering leaving town -- and talks of shooting her husband. ""Killing a man -- it's a big deal, isn't it?"" she asks. Depends on whether it's justified.

Later that night, a masked figure bursts into the bedroom where Ava and Raylan are asleep and starts blasting blindly with a shotgun. Givens grabs Ava and rolls off the bed. He then leaps to his feet, grabs the gunman and tosses him out the second-story window. The shadowy figure gets up and runsas Givens shoots at him.

A close call. ""Thanks for being here,"" Ava says. Later, the cops tell Givens they have discovered blood on the lawn, but no body. The man escaped.

So Givens and Sheriff Hunter head out to question Johnny. On the way, Hunter explains how Johnny's relative, Henry Crowder, raped his 10-year-old niece. Hunter has been searching for Henry ever since -- and the Crowder clan knows it. The pair enters a bar and finds Johnny playing pool. ""Take your clothes off,"" Hunter growls. He wants to look for evidence that the man was shot and fell out a window. It's pretty clear he didn't, but Hunter pushes the issue. He is a very angry officer of the law. Finally, Givens steps in and holds Johnny while Hunter pulls up his shirt. No wounds. No bruises. No shooter.

Cut to a dingy room inside a dingy house. A young man, Red, sits in a chair, bleeding profusely. An older man, Mr. Duke, who had earlier been watching Ava outside the police station stands over Red. ""I'm so sorry!"" Red sobs. ""I screwed up! I know I did!"" Mr. Duke videotapes Red -- and then pokes him in what looks to be a gunshot wound. ""You should do something about that before it gets infected,"" Mr. Duke taunts.

Later, Givens visits the office, handing Ava over to Rachel for safekeeping. ""Just what part of 'being under investigation' confuses you?"" Art sarcastically asks. ""You shot somebody else -- at her house!?"" The boss is angry that Givens slept with a woman so closely involved in the investigation into the recent actions of the modern-day cowboy. Givens, for his part, can hardly protest. Perhaps sleeping with Ava wasn't justified. Later, Winona introduces herself to Ava. ""I'm Raylan's ex wife,"" she said. ""You ever been tangled up with a law enforcement officer?"" Ava isn't sure what to say.

Cut to prison, where Givens meets Boyd. ""You don't know anything about somebody taking a shot at Ava?"" Givens asks. Boyd claims to know nothing about the matter. Givens then suggest that perhaps Boyd's father, who is also locked up, had something to do with it. Instead of answering, Boyd begins to preach -- which is the very last thing Givens wants to hear. He springs across the table, to choke Boyd against the wall. Guards quickly break up the scuffle. ""I'm so very disappointed in you,"" says an eerily calm Boyd.

Cut back to the dingy house, where Red is feeling much better. Mr. Duke, meanwhile, is still angry. ""You were to spot -- that's it!"" Mr. Duke says. ""You see, there's rules to being a hit man."" So we're dealing with a hit man and his ""apprentice."" But who hired them?

Later, a calmer Givens once again sits down with Boyd. ""Anyway, you were saying?"" Givens says. Boyd tells the marshal that his father swore not to hurt Ava -- for now. Instead, Boyd theorizes that perhaps the mysterious hit man wasn't after Ava at all. Perhaps the shotgun-wielding assailant was there to ""off"" Givens himself. The cowboy is shocked -- mostly because it makes perfect sense (Givens certainly has made enemies). Then Boyd drops another potential bomb: ""How well do you know Sheriff Hunter?""

Sure enough, we cut to Hunter meeting with Mr. Duke and his young apprentice. Red. The talk soon turns to Givens. ""We can set him up so you can put him down at a distance,"" Hunter tells Mr. Duke, who claims to have been given ""very specific orders."" In other words, the men from Miami who ordered the hit on Givens want it up close and personal. Suddenly, Hunter pulls his gun and shoots the Mr. Duke d-e-a-d where he sits. ""Jesus Christ!"" Red screams. Hunter then explains that the cartel isn't going to like the fact their hired gun is dead, so ""We have to give them what they want... Raylan Givens.""

Hunter then calls Givens, who is on to the sheriff thanks to Boyd. ""You know I got Ava?"" Hunter asks. ""Pay careful attention now -- or she dies."" So Givens meets Hunter on a rural road. Givens demands proof of life. Sure enough, Ava has been bound and gagged in Red's van. Givens drops (supposedly) all his weapons and gets into the driver's seat of Hunter's police cruiser.

Hunter calls the U.S. Marshals and threatens to shoot Givens ""in the back of the head"" if he sees any officers approaching as the cruiser and the van attempt to escape. Hunter then explains that the cartel approached him with an offer: they'd deliver Henry Crowder if Hunter did them a ""favor.""

Meanwhile, Ava has worked out of her bonds -- and attacks Red in the driver's seat of the van. It swerves -- and then crashes to the side of the road. Givens takes advantage of the distraction and promptly reaches back to disarm Hunter, breaking his wrist in the process. He has Hunter cuff himself before approaching the van to find Ava is alright. Red, in the meantime, is unconscious at the wheel. Case closed, but not the episode.

Cut to the prison, where some inmates surround Boyd and confront him about talking to Givens. They accuse him of being a ""snitch"" brandish an edged weapon and start beating him viciously.

Suddenly, a big man roughly intervenes, telling the accusers that they are not to touch a ""man of God."" Boyd smiles. ""It's good to see you, Daddy,"" he says."

I feel like you're my responsibility,"" a lecherous Bo says.

Givens approaches. ""You were just leaving,"" he says. Bo makes a few more off-color ""pie"" comparisons before Givens indirectly threatens the hardened ex-con with bodily harm. Bo scrams... for the time being.

Back at the office, Givens runs into Vasquez, who suggests a ""sit down"" in a few hours.

""Do you plan on using a union lawyer?"" he asks. ""Think about it."" Sounds ominous.

Cut to Winona returning home to find a strange, but well-dressed man in her house. Wayne, who sells security systems, claims to have been invited by Gary. Winona angrily demands the intruder leave. ""I hope you'll let Mr. Hawkins know I was here,"" he coolly says. ""Tell him I didn't forget."" Oh Gary, what no good are you up to now?

Givens, meanwhile, suddenly has more to worry about than lawyers. A prisoner named Wallace has managed to corral two guards, holding a shiv to one of their throats. ""I'll talk to you because you won't bullshit me,"" Wallace yells to Givens. Mullen quietly orders Givens to take a shot if he can't outwit the criminal (seeing as how it would be justified, of course). While Givens banters with Wallace, Gutterson snakes a camera through a vent near the ceiling. Wallace then turns off the lights and shuts the door to the locker room.

Later, Rachel looks at photos of Wallace and sees ""Simone"" tattooed across the man's chest. Givens inquires about the name -- and Wallace tearfully explains that Simone is his daughter, who the criminal hasn't seen in more than a decade.

But just as Givens thinks he might be getting somewhere, Wallace smiles and confesses that he is lying. ""Simone"" actually represents David Simone, a man Wallace killed. ""He was my first!"" Wallace says with a laugh. The criminal then explains that he has no illusions how this will all end. He just wants to ""screw"" with the guards like they screwed with him in prison.

Art summons Givens into his office, explaining that the cowboy has 15 minutes to wrap things up before the SWAT team arrives -- and likely kills the prisoner.

""Is there any way we can get some fried chicken in here -- spicy?"" asks Givens. Art is perplexed -- and so are we. Vasquez, on the other hand, appears to like the idea.

""For what it's worth, if you put this guy down, no one from my office is going to question you,"" he adds. Good to know.

Cut to the Hawkins' household. Winona challenges Gary about Wayne. Gary claims not to know the man. ""You know what he was here for,"" Winona says. ""I know you're into something with some bad people."" Still denying all the charges, Gary storms out of the house -- blaming Winona for sending a threatening Givens after him.

Back at the station, Wallace continues to run down his sordid history, telling stories of braining his boss with a chain and how his daddy worked as a security guard.

Just then, the heavily armed SWAT team enters. ""Time for the fun to begin,"" Wallace quips. The team immediately cuts all the lights. Mullen, meanwhile, tries to stall the new arrivals, telling the S.W.A.T. leader that fried chicken is on the way. Perhaps Wallace will put down his shiv if offered food. ""It might be good to give him an out so that he saves face,"" Mullen explains to the S.W.A.T. leader, who couldn't disagree more.

But they give Givens two minutes anyway. ""Put down the shiv,"" the Deputy Marshal says. ""Live to see what I got coming for ya.""

Just then, Gutterson enters with a giant bag of food. Givens take a bite of the ""extra spicy"" -- and Wallace practically drools. Givens then promises to order Wallace a chicken dinner each night for the next three days -- and even engage in polite conversation -- if the criminal will let the guards go. The offer is tempting to Wallace, who claims to only want to be treated like a human being. Givens then offers the man a shot of bourbon from Mullen's special desk drawer stash.

And just like that, the hostage-taker puts down his shiv and surrenders. ""I think the bourbon sealed it,"" Givens tells Mullen and Vasquez, who offers to postpone the meeting mentioned earlier.

Givens, however, would rather ""get it over with."" So Vasquez starts asking questions about Ava -- and even produces photographs of the pair. Givens is as surprised as he is angry. Vasquez then explains that Boyd's lawyer will ""strongly suggest"" that Givens began his relationship with Ava before he was reassigned to Kentucky.

Meaning: ""We're going to have to release Boyd Crowder,"" Vasquez says. The bottom line is that the entire case against Boyd is predicated on the testimony of Givens and Ava, who are both ""compromised."" Vasquez then advises Givens to stay away from Boyd.

He doesn't, of course. Givens is there when Boyd is released from prison. The man continues to preach the good word of God, believing his sudden freedom is His work. ""The way I see it, I'm the one who allowed you to be released upon the world -- just like I'm the one who's going to find a way to put you back in a cage,"" Givens says.

Boyd just smiles -- and greets Bo, who is waiting outside the prison with a lawyer. ""I will continue to pray that someday I will bring you a modicum of peace,"" Boyd says.

Givens then gets a call from Ava... and decides not to answer."

He is currently on a ""well-earned vacation"" from law enforcement. Two loud drunks are getting rowdy at the end of the bar, bragging about their conquests. Givens asks them to turn down the volume. ""I didn't order assholes with my whisky,"" he says. The three step outside -- and Givens, after putting up a good fight, ends up on the ground getting pummeled and stomped. The bartender steps outside with his pump shotgun noisily displayed, to stop the beating. Soon after, Winona appears to help her ex-husband sit up.

She drives Givens back to his hotel room -- and tells the lawman about her visit from Duffy. ""He was on that list I gave you,"" Winona says. ""If the names on that list were clean, why did you go see Gary?"" She then helps Givens take off his boots before asking him to stay away from her home. Winona doesn't object when the lawman suggests that he might pay a ""peaceful"" visit to Duffy, though. ""Are you capable of that?"" she jokes.

Cut to Gary, who pays a visit to family man and former football player Toby. ""I got an investment opportunity for you,"" Gary says. ""Shopping mall."" Toby smells trouble. Indeed, Gary admits that he is currently ""overextended."" Worse: he took some money from people he ""shouldn't have."" Toby offers muscle instead of money. ""You know I miss being the baddest guy on the field,"" the former University of Kentucky and NFL player says with a grin.

Givens, meanwhile, pays a visit to Duffy and his ""muscle,"" a former professional boxer. ""If either of you go near Gary or Winona, I'll come back here and upend your entire existence,"" the off-duty Marshall says after some banter. After Givens leaves, Duffy tells his goon to tail Givens and then ""put him in the ground.""

Later, Duffy calls his boss (a Mr. Arnett), who tells Duffy to keep calm -- and to have a long, productive talk with Gary. Speak of the devil, Gary suddenly shows up with Toby. ""Just get me the money,"" Duffy says. ""All these little visits are getting pretty tiresome."" Gary starts jabbering about doubling Arnett's money in 24 months while Toby out-and-out threatens. Duffy is unimpressed by either pitch. He even offers Toby a chance to back out, but the former athlete is enjoying his role as enforcer far too much. Bad decision.

Givens, in the meantime, heads back to the bar in search of his beloved cowboy hat. ""Wouldn't it be easier just to go buy yourself a new hat?"" the bartender asks. Sure, but when did Givens ever do ""easy?""

The Marshall next pays a visit to the wise-cracking informant, Arnold Pinter, from an earlier episode, who warns Givens that Duffy is ""mercurial"" and Arnett has hired him. Givens knows Arnett by ""reputation. In short, anyone involved with either thug is in trouble. To prove the point, we cut to Toby's home. Duffy and his goon enter -- and the latter promptly -- and brutally -- beats Toby to the ground. And then beats and stomps him some more.

Later, Duffy and his goon surprise Gary in a parking lot. Duffy orders the man to pay up. The goon punches Gary in the face and then tosses him Toby's Super Bowl ring. ""By the way, next time it will be your wife,"" Duffy says before leaving. The goon, a former professional boxer, then returns to his home -- and finds Givens waiting. The lawman demands to know what Duffy has planned for Gary and Winona. The goon promptly calls Winona a ""bitch,"" prompting Givens to deliver one of his patented ultimatums: ""Disrespect her again and I'll put a hole in your leg."" After several discharges, for emphasis, of the pistol disarmed from goon, the boxer reveals that the plan is to kidnap Winona TONIGHT in order to force Gary to pay.

Givens quickly calls Winona. ""I'll be there as soon as I can,"" he says. Cut to Gary, who returns to Toby's house. The former player limps to the door on crutches. ""You're on your own now,"" Toby says. Gary apologizes, swearing that the bad guys won't bother him again, and returns Toby's Super Bowl ring.

Meanwhile, Givens drives Winona to a secure location. She accuses her ex of feeling ""good"" about Gary's misfortune. ""I ain't here to gloat,"" Givens says. Winona then defends her choice of man, saying she needed ""a little hope"" in her life.

After dropping off Winona, Givens finds Gary by the site of his failed shopping complex plot -- armed. The realtor then puts the gun to the side of his head. ""If I kill myself at least Winona will get the insurance,"" Gary reasons. ""All I'm trying to do is make things better and I keep making it worse. I'm such a freaking loser!"" Givens talks the man down, urging him to deliver his ""pitch"" for the project. So Gary does -- pointing out where the movie theater, horse stables and stores would go. Givens is impressed, but says: ""It ain't worth dying over."" Gary agrees. So the pair head to Duffy's office, where Arnett waits.

Gary admits he doesn't have the money, but hands Arnett the deed for the property. Duffy is incredulous, but Arnett knows the land will be worth even more than Gary owes in a few years. ""We've been laboring under the assumption that you were going to pay us with a portion of the recovered money,"" a fuming Duffy says. Duffy then pulls a gun, as does Arnett's body guard and the boxer.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Everyone goes down, except for Givens, Gary and Arnett. Gary takes the opportunity to tackle Duffy. Givens pulls out his cell phone. ""I'm going to need some squad cars and an ambulance,"" he says.

So Givens drives Gary home to Winona, who embraces her man. A forlorn Givens watches from the car before driving back to the bar where we opened the episode. Sure enough, the men who beat up Givens are at the bar -- and one of them is wearing the Marshal's hat. ""I ain't leaving without the hat,"" Givens warns. ""And I'd be sober this time."" After some thought, the man wisely returns the hat to Givens who exits the bar, adjusting the hat on his head.

A happy ending, indeed."

Part of his ministry involves holding a gun to Bobby Joe's head and threatening to shoot if the hillbilly doesn't quick using drugs. Suddenly, Givens saunters into the service/camp.

""I assume you're going to do what you always do: steal money and blow shit up,"" Givens tells his old friend/nemesis. Boyd insists he is on the righteous path. He then asks to speak to the ""congregation,"" praying to God that Boyd might be forgiven for blowing up a ""black church"" with a rocket launcher and shooting his associate in the ""back of the head."" Furthermore, Givens tells the suddenly wary church-goers that there is a $50,000 reward for anyone who offers information that lands Boyd back in jail.

Amen.

Later, a team of cops finds a scantily clad woman sucking the poison out of a judge's groin area. The man was apparently bitten by a copperhead snake.

Cut to police HQ, where Mullen tells Givens of Judge Mike ""The Hammer"" Reardon. Mullen suggests looking for criminals who the judge put away -- especially those with experience handling poisonous snakes. Meanwhile, Boyd and his ""congregation"" come upon a meth lab in the woods. ""I come in peace,"" Boyd says. ""But if I come back here again and you're still cooking up that poison ... I hear these things blow up all the time."" A regular Holy Warrior, that Boyd.

Givens visits Reardon, who reveals that he is wearing a skimpy bathing suit under his robe -- along with a gun. Indeed, the judge is an eccentric. He also believes Givens is completely justified for shooting Tommy Buck in Miami. ""One less predator to come after the herd,"" Reardon says.

Later, Givens follows Reardon home when the judge begins to drive erratically. The judge's car crashes. Turns out there was a ""failure"" in the car's exhaust system, which pumped carbon monoxide into the vehicle, causing the judge to lose consciousness. ""About as accidental as a snake in the bed,"" Givens observes.

Back at the judge's house, the pair share a drink. Givens asks if Reardon would call Ava's judge and suggest that the woman be allowed to leave the state. The judge refuses. ""I'm not gonna piss in another man's sandbox,"" he says. Says Givens: ""Fair enough.""

Meanwhile, cousin Johnny pays a visit to Boyd's camp to ask about the threat to the meth lab. Turns out Bo wasn't too happy to hear of it. Boyd is unrepentant, though. Cut to Givens, who asks the clerk at a smoke shop for the whereabouts of Pastor Israel Fandi. The boy, Bunny, claims not to know -- so Givens begins dropping glass bongs on the floor. Bunny quickly relents, giving Givens the address for a Mrs. Davis. Before leaving, Givens hands the clerk a wad of cash. ""I break it, I buy it,"" the lawman says.

Moments later, Givens is visiting Mrs. Davis, who recognizes a picture of Fandi as ""Otis,"" a man who landscapes her yard for free. Givens is immediately suspicious. Back at the office, Givens refuses to tell Mullen where he was, calling it ""personal business.""

Later, Reardon takes Givens to a honkytonk go-go bar, where a shady looking young man eyes the judge from the bar. Givens catches up to the man in the bathroom, but Reardon claims not to recognize him. Reluctantly, Givens lets the smart-mouth suspect leave. Back at headquarters, Givens discovers that the man's name is Virgil, a divorced dad who got 15 years from Reardon for possession with intent to sell. Interesting.

It's soon back to ""personal business,"" though. Givens returns to Mrs. Davis's home to find Fandi/Otis working in the backyard. ""Boyd Crowder, the man who blew up your church, just got out of prison,"" Givens explains. ""Your testimony could put him back in."" Fandi refuses, guessing correctly that it was Givens whose screw up (with Ava) resulted in Boyd receiving a get-out-of-jail-free card. Later, the cowboy cop returns to the case at hand, interviewing Virgil's ex-wife, who provides him with a return address.

In the meantime, Boyd makes good on his holy threat and storms the meth lab. He drags out two of its residents before tossing a Molotov cocktail inside. BOOM! Mickey, one of the meth heads, cries out that his buddy Gil was inside. ""You killed Gil!"" Mickey says. Boyd appears genuinely horrified. Turns out even the Lord's work can go terribly wrong.

Back at the go-go bar, Reardon asks to use the restroom. While Givens scopes out the bathroom, Reardon gives the Marshall the slip. Moments later, Givens storms outside to find the judge with his pants down, a woman kneeling in front of him and Virgil holding a gun. ""Can we agree the young lady can go?"" Givens asks. Virgil refuses, demanding the judge's attention. ""This is my courtroom and you're overruled!"" he says. Suddenly, Reardon pulls his own gun and fires. Virgil goes down with a gunshot wound to the arm. Givens quickly disarms Reardon. He then reveals that Virgil took out a life-insurance policy on himself. The money was to go to his ex-wife and kid. ""Was that the plan?"" Givens asks. ""Shoot the judge, make me shoot you?"" It sure was.

Later, Reardon looks contemplative for the very fist time. ""Thanks,"" the judge says. ""If you didn't stop me I would've killed him."" Perhaps the ""Hammer"" won't be so quick to judge so harshly next time.

The next day, Givens asks Ava to come see him. She does -- and Givens reveals that Reardon has agreed to talk to her judge so that she can ""get out of Kentucky."" Snaps Ava: ""How far away do you want me?"" She knows it's not just about keeping her safe -- but alleviating Givens's guilt for setting Boyd free. True enough.

Back at the office, Givens receives bad news from Mullen: the man who died in the meth-lab explosion was a confidential informant. ""The last report he filed said Boyd Crowder threatened to blow the meth lab up if they didn't shut it down,"" Mullen explains. He then theorizes that Boyd is trying to shore-up his daddy Bo's criminal empire. Givens admits that he had visited Boyd's men and offered a $50,000 reward. He also admits to asking Fandi to testify. Mullen encourages Givens to try again.

Givens visits Fandi and reveals that he knows Fandi is planting marijuana in the yards he landscapes. ""We can get a warrant, search your basement and your garage, or you can do your civic duty,"" Givens says. ""You think you're scared of him? You have no idea what you can expect from me.""

Fandi laments: ""Tell me what he looks like and I'll say whatever you want me to say!"" Givens is SHOCKED. He thought the pastor was holding out because he was scared of Boyd. Turns out that Fandi really didn't see the man.

Asks Fandi: ""How are you going to get him?"" Givens throws up his arms. ""I don't know,"" the Marshall says. ""I don't know."""

They cuff the ""shepherd"" of this particular flock as well as Dewey Crowe. Back at the office, the officers attempt to get a follower named Luther to assist them in putting Boyd back behind bars. Luther stares at Givens and growls: ""You strike at the shepherd, the sheep may scatter.""

One by one, during interrogation each of the ""church"" members repeats the identical phrase in the identical manner... except for Dewey who garbles it.

Later, Boyd is brought in for questioning. Asks Givens: ""Are you working for your daddy ... scaring everyone back under his wing?"" Boyd, without admitting to anything, suggests that the blown-up trailer might have been an ""accident."" Suddenly, God-fearing Mullen becomes righteously angry. ""It's assholes like you that give Christians like me a bad name!"" the boss yells. A state police officer suggests tracking down the two men who escaped from the meth lab -- if Boyd didn't already kill them.

Speak of the devils, the scared pair meet with Bo and Johnny at the bar. ""Is it too late for us to get your protection now?"" one of the men asks. Says Bo: ""Never too late ... we'll get you up and running again."" Cut to Givens, who is on his way out of the office. The modern-day cowboy runs into his ex wife, who is acting nervous and flirty. ""Thank you again for what you did for Gary,"" Winona says. Later, Givens visits Hunter in prison. The former sheriff drops a bomb: when Bo went to jail, he handed collection and protection duties to none other than Arlo Givens -- and, apparently, Arlo promptly screwed it up. ""Can't imagine ol' Bo is too happy about that,"" Hunter says. ""Can you?""

Cut to Bo paying a visit to Boyd's camp. He takes his son aside and hands over a wad of cash. Turns out Boyd's handiwork at the meth lab -- accidental or not -- has been a boon to daddy's business. ""I got people lining up with cash in their hands, begging me for protection,"" Bo explains to his son, who promptly returns the money. It's against his new religion. ""You're not taking me seriously, daddy -- and I don't find it amusing,"" Boyd says. ""You're wasting your time if you think I'm doing anything on your behalf."" Bo leaves the money on a rock before storming away.

Givens and Mullen, in the meantime, visit Raylan's step-mother Helen. Givens explains that they know about Arlo's recent business endeavors. The wife, naturally, is indignant. ""You can put on that hat and badge and pretend you're somebody else,"" she sneers at Givens, who warns her that Bo will come looking for the money Arlo lost. That shuts her up fast.

Givens and Mullen then head to the local VFW hall, but are refused entrance. Only veterans and their guests are allowed. So the Marshals call former Army sniper Tim, who flashes his ID and gets them inside, where Arlo sits and drowns his sorrows. ""You can either sit around waiting to catch a bullet,"" Givens begins. ""Or accept protection from the Marshals' service,"" Mullen continues. When Arlo refuses, his son more or less calls dear old dad a lowlife.

Arlo stands and SLAPS his hat-wearing son. It's a tense moment before Givens taunts his pops and then exits. Mullen then hands Arlo his card. ""We're taking down the Crowders and you can either go with them ... or not,"" Mullen says before taking his leave as well. Outside, the men's cell phones suddenly start ringing in unison. Not a good sign. ""Let me guess: missing meth cookers,"" Mullen says upon arriving at the scene. Indeed. The two witnesses to Boyd's ""accident"" have been shot in the head, murdered by Bo and company (though the Marshals don't yet know it).

The next day, Bo pays Arlo a visit. ""Where's my money?"" the Crowder crime family patriarch asks. Arlo blames his failure to run the business on ""young punks"" and tells Bo to get control of this born-again son. ""At least he didn't join the other team!"" Bo yells. So now the two old men argue about who has the better/worst son. Helen, meanwhile, listens from the next room, shotgun at the ready. ""You have until this time tomorrow,"" Bo warns.

Cut to Givens, who drives along the road and notices a hitchhiking Dewey. Turns out the not-so-bright follower was kicked out of Boyd's camp for masturbating. Givens smirks -- and then has a brainstorm. ""You are now a duly deputized U.S. Marshal,"" says Givens, explaining that Dewey will become his man on the inside upon returning to Boyd's camp and begging for forgiveness. It's too much for Dewey, who confesses that Boyd targeted the meth lab because one of his converts, Bobby, had once been a cooker there.

So the team of Marshals returns to the church camp. Boyd is once again handcuffed while the officers search for Bobby. While they wait, Givens and Boyd chat. It's not long before Boyd reveals that Arlo was working for none other than Ava's ex husband. Assuming that's true, why did Ava never mention it to Givens? It's not like the two haven't had an opportunity to talk during the past few weeks. Givens is perturbed.

Later, the Marshals leave and Boyd begins frantically digging underneath the makeshift campfire. Bobby is underneath in a wooden box, breathing through a length of hose. ""Bobby, I'm going to have to ask you for one more favor and I gotta warn ya, it's a big'un,"" Boyd says. Bobby says he'll do anything because Boyd saved his soul.

Helen, meanwhile, is busy digging, too. She unearths a suitcase from her garden -- and opens it to find whatever she had stashed there (money, we're guessing) long gone. She throws the suitcase down in anger.

Later, Givens heads to the bar -- and finds Ava having more than a few drinks. He wants to know what she is doing back in town considering she has a bull's eye on her back. Ava blows off her former beau and points out a scruffy looking dude sitting across the bar. Hesler, one of Bo's goons, has been following her. Givens challenges the man, who gets mouthy. So, the Marshall slaps Hesler and then breaks his finger. Givens then approaches Ava, who is drunk and refuses to leave. ""You are leaving with me if I have to arrest you and put you in handcuffs,"" he says.

Turns out our favorite cowboy has to do just that. Givens drives the passed-out and cuffed Ava to Winona's home. ""I need her to stay at your place tonight,"" he asks his ex. Winona, after teasing Givens for messing up another relationship, agrees. She owes him, after all. Cut to Helen and Arlo, who are arguing over the missing money, which has apparently been gone for some time. ""I planned on filling it up again,"" Arlo says of Helen's buried suitcase. Suddenly, GUNSHOTS! The windows shatter! Moments later, a pick-up truck speeds away from the house. Helen and Arlo rush outside, firing their own guns, but the truck disappears into the night. ""We either run or you kill Bo,"" Helen says.

Dewey, meanwhile, has returned to camp to find Boyd waiting. The boss explains that he can't ""abide"" his followers talking so freely to Givens. Boyd then pulls a gun and points it at Dewey's stricken face. ""I'm sorry, son, but the work we're doing here is too important,"" Boyd says. ""I hope you understand."" Boyd looks to the heavens ...and lowers his weapon. Murdering a man in cold blood just wouldn't be the Christian thing to do. ""Go,"" says Boyd, banishing the sinner from the flock.

Cut to the Marshal's office, where Bobby has turned himself in for a crime everyone is fairly certain he didn't commit. ""I come up here to tell you that I'm the one set fire to that trailer,"" Bobby says. ""Not Boyd. Not anyone. Just me."" Givens is shocked. That's some ""favor.""

Later, we see Boyd buying military-grade weapons with the money his daddy left behind at the camp. For what exactly?

Givens, meanwhile, returns to his hotel room to find his daddy quietly waiting for him in the dark. ""Hello, Raylan."""

He admits to skimming just a little bit off the top. Givens then acknowledges that the Marshals aren't so much interested in the past. In other words, they'd like Arlo to get back in Bo's ""good graces"" in order to provide information on Boyd.

""You want me to be a snitch?"" Arlo asks. Exactly. Cut to Florida, where Bo meets his supplier on a golf course. The smooth-talking criminal warns Bo of the potential ""consequences"" of their partnership -- a warning Bo finds insulting as it implies he is little more than a rube. The kingpin's main concern, however, is Givens (of course). Turns out the man knew Tommy Bucks.

Back in Kentucky, the Marshals try to convince Arlo to wear a wire. He refuses, which makes Givens' blood boil. ""Everything that led to this moment was your choice!"" the son yells. Seethes Arlo: ""You are a miserable sonofabitch, Raylan... I'm glad your momma didn't live to see how turned out!"" Arlo charges out of the office.

Later, Mullen admonishes the younger Givens for losing his cool (again) -- and orders him to convince dear ol' dad to return and be a mole -- wire or not.

The next morning, Ava wakes up to discover she is at Winona's house. The two women share an awkward cup of coffee before Givens calls. Ava explains to the Marshal that he was ""right"" -- and that she'll be heading out of town until everything blows over. Cut to an empty warehouse where Bo and the gang are getting a tour from a realtor. They claim to be in the furniture-making business (rather than drugs). When the realtor leaves, Bo takes charge. ""I don't want to be here more than week,"" he says. ""Is that enough for you to cook the entire shipment?"" Nods all around.

Later, Ava returns home to find Bo's thugs drinking beer and watching TV. They claim that the house is Crowder property since it has always been in the name of Ava's ex. Meanwhile, Winona pays a late-night visit to Givens at his hotel room. With almost no words, she takes off her wedding ring and leans in to kiss her ex husband. Soon, they're in full-fledged foreplay mode and clothes become optional.

Afterward, Winona gets dressed, puts on her ring and walks out. No words because none are needed. Unfortunately, Ava is parked outside -- and watched the former Mrs. Givens leave.

The next day, Ava goes to see Helen. ""I need a gun,"" the former tells Raylan's step-mother. ""You always struck me as a woman who takes things into your own hands."" Helen warns that Bo won't take kindly to Ava clearing Crowder thugs out of her house with a shotgun. ""I just have to show him I'm not scared,"" Ava says.

Cut to the inside of a church, where Boyd volunteers to preach to the crowd, including his father. ""Like Jesus, we must never be afraid to strike out against those who practice evil!"" Boyd tells. ""We must take the high road of righteousness ... even if it means leaving our own flesh and blood behind."" Outside, the two threaten each other. Someone is going to meet their maker soon.

Later, Givens arrives outside the VFW to find it swarming with cops. Turns out a young man called ""Lucky"" is inside with a grenade. The soldier's unit is about to be sent back to the Middle East and he isn't allowed to go due to a lung condition. Inside, Arlo talks gently to the boy. ""I'm telling you old timer, you really don't want to be here,"" Lucky says. ""What you think you going to say to me?"" Arlo insists he only wants to finish his drink. They swap horrible war stories in which they lived while others died. (Arlo's narrative being convincingly fabricated on the fly.) ""I think Lucky was the name given to you because it's a blessing, not a curse,"" Arlo says. ""Why not you?"" The boy begins to cry. Moments later, he gives himself up with no further violence. Givens enters and joins his dad at the bar. ""I'll wear the wire,"" Arlo says. ""I just spent an hour next to a nut job with a live grenade. Turns out I'm not as afraid of dying as I used to be.""

Ava, in the meantime, enters Johnny's bar armed with a shotgun. She confronts Bo in the back room. ""It's not my fault your son is a wife-beating piece of shit,"" she says. ""You harassing me like this? It ain't right."" Bo says he doesn't want to kill Ava, but he does want her to leave Kentucky and never come back. She refuses -- and warns the old man that she has already shot one Crowder and isn't afraid to plug another.

Later, a wired Arlo visits Bo while Givens, Mullen and Gutterson listen in from a nearby van. Arlo talks a good enough game, but holds up a notepad to Bo that reads ""play along... I'll feed Feds garbage. You pay me."" Bo responds with his own note reading, ""Kiss my ass."" Bo, who now knows that Givens is listening, says that Arlo should ask his son to make sure Ava gets out of town. ""She stood right where you're standing and pointed a shotgun at me,"" Bo says. Arlo smiles. ""If I see him, I'll tell him,"" the elder Givens says. Silently, Arlo gives Bo an envelope stuffed with newspaper cut in the shape of currency, while the listening surveillance team hears the sounds of paper and believes that Arlo is paying Bo the $20,000 they'd given him to make their set-up convincing.

Afterward, Givens runs straight to Ava, who is sitting in the dark with a shotgun. ""What the hell are you thinking?"" Givens demands. Ava then reveals that she knows that the cowboy rekindled his romance with Winona. ""I can be myself here,"" a weary Ava says. ""Whether I die tomorrow or 10 years from now, it's going to be here. This is home.""

Later than night, a truck transporting Bo's newly cooked drugs is stopped when a disabled pickup is parked in the middle of the road. The transporters exit the truck with guns drawn -- and then drop to the ground when a masked Boyd appears holding a rocket launcher.

The young Crowder, with his trademark ""Fire in the hole!"" yell, proceeds to blow up his father's drug shipment.

Now who is justified?"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1644780/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,"Bo gets revenge on Boyd for blowing up his ephedrine shipment, asks Arlo to help him kill Raylan at the request of the Miami cartel, and kidnaps Ava for bait and insurance against Raylan.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Adam Arkin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['cleave gag', 'knocked unconscious', 'abduction', 'tent camp', 'dead body hanging from a tree', 'hit on the head with a shotgun butt', 'parent grown child relationship', 'cabin in the woods', 'threatened with a shotgun', 'gunshot wound', 'bullet wound', 'police informant', 'confidential informant', 'dead body', 'father betrays his son', 'homicide', 'uncle shoots his nephew', 'wound', 'woman holds a shotgun', 'revenge', 'old friends reunited', 'betrayal by father', 'father and son talk', 'talking to god', 'prayer', 'watching tv', 'dead body in a tree', 'hung from tree', 'hit in the face', 'split lip', 'reference to the los angeles clippers', 'reference to the phases of the moon', 'threatened with a gun', 'smoking marijuana', 'camouflage', 'bloody nose', 'drinking whiskey', 'episode title spoken by character', 'consequence', 'police shootout', 'harlan county', 'slow motion scene', 'shot in the back', 'knocked out with a gun butt', 'shot to death', 'shot in the neck', 'shot in the chest', 'shot in the arm', 'whiskey', 'digging a grave']",[],"Boyd carefully approaches Ava's front door and knocks. ""I apologize for the late hour,"" he says. ""I just want a word."" Behind the door, we hear a shotgun being cocked. Armed, Ava opens the door -- only to find an apologetic Boyd, who lists his many regrets (including holding Ava hostage, ""lusting"" after her and letting his brother make her life miserable). ""How 'bout what you do for me is you leave here and never see me again!"" Ava spits. Boyd agrees -- and walks away into the night.

Later, he is picked up by Johnny. ""Damn, boy!"" Johnny says. ""We're taking over!"" Apparently, the plan was for Boyd to hijack the shipment from Miami so that he and Johnny could become the new drug-manufacturing kingpins in town. Boyd deflates his relative's enthusiasm when he gently explains that the shipment was blown up. ""This is bat-shit crazy,"" Johnny says. ""From here on out, you just stay clear of me -- or I will you kill you with these bare hands!"" Once again, a serene Boyd agrees.

Gio's drug runners from Miami, Ernesto and Pilar, in the meantime, have found their way to Bo's headquarters. They describe the man who blew up the truck -- and dad quickly recognizes the suspect as his born-again son. ""How do you think it's going to go for you when my uncle finds out you lost his shipment?"" Pilar asks. Bo figures it won't go very good at all, so he ties up Ernesto and Pilar before they can report back. The duo are NOT happy.

In Lexington Givens and Mullen discuss a burning truck found in the road. It contained ingredients to make meth -- before it was destroyed. ""Like somebody hit it with a rocket launcher,"" Mullen says. ""Boyd's M.O., isn't it?"" Givens agrees. Something isn't right. Is Boyd a vigilante?

Arlo enters -- and Mullen explains that the case has suddenly gotten bigger. Along with working for the Marshals, Arlo will also be in contact with the FBI and the DEA. ""It's not just a little family affair anymore, Arlo,"" Mullen says.

Meanwhile, Bo's men raid Boyd's church camp -- and find Boyd waiting. ""Looks like you've been a bad boy,"" Bo says to his son. ""Johnny, hurt my son ... and don't stop until I tell you."" So Johnny, who is plenty upset with Boyd for other reasons, punches Boyd in the face. Twice. Three times. Four times. Five. Boyd, covered in blood, refuses to react. Bo demands to know where the weapons cache is hidden. After a few more punches, one of Boyd's men steps forward and reveals the weapons are buried under the campfire. ""You're no longer my son,"" Bo says. ""You're no longer their leader. You are being cast into exile."" Bo then threatens to kill one of Boyd's followers unless he leaves town. Once again, a bloody but accepting Boyd calmly agrees and walks away into the woods.

He doesn't go more than a few hundred yards, however, before he hears gunshots from the camp. Boyd turns around and runs back to find all of the men shot dead and hanging upside down from a tree. Boyd begins to SCREAM in real pain.

Cut to Bo, who releases Ernesto and Pilar from the barroom closet. He assures the two Miami criminals that the man who blew up the truck is ""out of business"" and that Uncle Gio will get his money back. ""He's going to get every penny that I owe him and a little something extra,"" Bo explains. What that ""little something"" might be, Bo won't say.

Later, Bo busts visits Givens's hotel room, where Arlo is being stashed. It's a risky move, to be sure, but the pair need to talk. ""Things are different,"" Arlo says. ""They know about Boyd blowing up your shipment."" He then explains that the FBI and DEA are coming aboard. Bo then says he can't trust Arlo to give him inside information unless he can prove himself. ""My Miami friend lost a captain and a couple of button men to a certain deputy marshal,"" Bo explains. ""In order to get square with him, I'm going to have to ask you to help me give him Raylan."" Arlo is struck. Can he actually sell-out his own son?

An anguished Boyd, meanwhile, is digging graves for his former comrades. He stops to talk to God. ""I'm gonna need a sign,"" he says. ""I'm gonna need to know their sacrifice meant something to you!""

Later, Givens returns home to find his father waiting. The two share a drink and Arlo tries to make ""small talk"" about women and family history. He is clearly stalling.

Arlo then pulls out a gun only to find that Raylan has anticipated his betrayal and beaten him to the draw. Dad quickly lowers his weapon.

""When are they coming?"" Givens asks. Arlo explains that Bo and his men are already outside -- and that Arlo was to shoot Givens in the leg. Givens doesn't hesitate. He shoots his father in the arm. ""Then what happens?"" the Marshal asks.

What happens is two of Bo's thugs burst into the room, guns drawn. Givens warns them to drop their weapons, but they turn their weapons on him. So Givens shoots them both -- one in the chest and one in the throat. Justified yet again.

""I'm going to need an ambulance,"" Givens says into his 'phone. ""And a coroner.""

Bo and Johnny, in the meantime, head to Ava's house, and using deception, throw a bag over her head and drag her away after Bo butt-strokes her with her own shotgun to subdue her. At the last moment, Bo turns on Johnny. ""This is for tipping Boyd off to that shipment,"" Bo growls before gut-shooting Johnny from close range with Ava's short-barreled shotgun. Bo tells the grievously wounded man that the authorities will think Ava shot ""another Crowder"" before disappearing forever. Not good.

Cut back to Raylan, who is busy cleaning his father's wound. Suddenly, Boyd enters the hotel room. ""I am lost, Raylan,"" says Boyd, explaining that dear-old-dad murdered his congregation. ""I sent my flock to slaughter.""

Givens's cell' 'phone rings and he answers, seeing it's from Ava but Bo is on the other end of the line. The elder Crowder tells Raylan that Ava is alive but in the trunk, and orders the Deputy U.S. Marshal to head toward Bulletville -- alone -- where they will make a ""trade.""

""My life for hers?"" Givens asks. ""Something like that,"" Bo says and hangs up. A subdued but very serious Boyd offers to help since he knows ""every inch"" of the area where his father has a cabin and is certainly headed with Ava.

So the odd partners drive to meet Bo.

""You were telling the truth, huh?"" Givens asks. ""This conversion?"" Boyd explains that he no longer knows for sure. ""I set all this in motion, didn't I?"" Boyd asks. Givens figures he also had something to do with it when he shot Tommy Bucks in Miami.

The sun rises and Givens and Raylan arrive on the road to Bo's cabin. Givens hands Boyd a revolver and drops him off -- warning him not to ""take advantage"" of the situation -- before heading to the remote wooden abode. Givens is then met by Bo and a thug, who disarm the Deputy Marshal of both his primary and back-up handguns.

Boyd, meanwhile, has snuck around the back of the cabin where Ava is tied up. He eases inside and shoots one of Bo's men, mortally wounding him. Outside, Givens takes advantage of the distraction and regains his pistols while shooting the thug multiple times in the stomach and disarming the surprised, and confused, Bo.

And just like that, Givens and Boyd are alone with Bo. Boyd raises his gun to his father. Givens tells his new partner that he doesn't want to do that. ""It's not something I want to do, my friend,"" Boyd says. ""It's something I have to do."" Boyd explains that his father killed his spirit when he murdered the men at the church camp. Bo is defiant. ""You gonna pull the trigger, or you gonna talk me to death?"" he asks with a sneer.

BLAM!

An unexpected shot from concealment strikes his father in the back and exits his chest. Bo, shocked and mortally wounded, falls to the ground.

More gunfire explodes from the woods. Boyd is hit in the upper arm as Raylan returns covering fire with his two recovered pistols while the pair retreat into the cabin where Ava waits.

The furtive shooters are the Miami drug runners, Ernesto and Pilar, plus two more of Bo's men. Givens quickly takes one of them out with a well-aimed shot as Ava provides unaimed distracting fire.

Another stealthily approaches a rear window, and as he quietly opens it to back-shoot Raylan, is quickly shot twice in the face by the Marshal laying in wait beneath the window.

The cabin is suddenly riddled with automatic rifle fire. Ernesto and Pilar have AK-47s. ""All we want is Raylan Givens!"" Pilar yells. Givens tells Boyd to leave with Ava. He'll deal with the drug criminals.

Boyd and Ava sneak out the back while Givens walks with his hands raised out of the front door. Ernesto raises his gun to kill Givens, but is shot by Boyd from behind a tree with the telescoped rifle the second of Bo's gang Raylan killed had left in the rear during his stealthy approach.

Givens then draws his weapon and opens fire, finishing off Ernesto. Pilar makes it to their SUV and speeds away. Givens is about to go after her, when Boyd appears with his rifle pointed at Givens. He tells Raylan that Ava is still running through the woods, and seems intent on pursuing the escaping woman.

""I'll get her,"" Boyd says. Asks Givens: ""What are you going to do after you get her?"" Answers Boyd: ""I haven't quite figured that out yet.""

Sensing that Raylan is having doubts about letting him go after Pilar, Boyd tells him ""I'm going to bet my life on you being the only friend I have left in this world.""

Boyd lowers his weapon and gets into his father's car to drive after Pilar.

The Deputy U.S. Marshal, with a certain amount of ambivalence, lets Boyd go, pointing his empty service weapon at the disappearing Crowder vehicle while making a young boy's play gunshot sound."

A voice questions her about reality.

She wakes up on a sunny morning in the southwest USA, Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) greets her father Abernathy (Louis Herthum) and smiles.

Newcomers arrive in a town by steam locomotive train. Teddy Flood (James Marsden) a young man, walks through the old western town. A posse is being organized to chase a man who murdered the Marshal. Teddy goes to a saloon, he turns down a hooker, then notices Dolores outside. He runs out to meet her, she is glad he came back, then rides off on her horse. Teddy follows and the two ride together. She explains the nature of a Judas steer in a cowherd, Teddy is a greenhorn. At night they ride back to her ranch. When close they hear gunshots, Teddy grabs a rifle and goes to see. A man murders Dolores's parents and pours milk over the bodies. Teddy comes in shooting and takes out the villains. A voice explains to Dolores her world is made to gratify the Newcomers.

A gunslinger, a man in black (Ed Harris) arrives at the farm and greets Dolores crying over her father. He mentions he has been coming for 30 years but she doesn't remember him. Teddy confronts him and tries to shoot the gunslinger but the bullets have no effect. The gunslinger laughs at Teddy and says he was made to be a Loser, As he drags Dolores off to rape her in the barn, Teddy continues shooting to no effect, then the gunslinger shoots him and continues taking Dolores screaming to the barn.

A new day, Dolores awakes. Teddy rides a train into town. A huge control room staffed by techs observe the tableau in reduced scale 3D. Elsewhere, android humans and horses are being manufactured.

Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) and a tech Elsie Hughes (Shannon Woodward) observe a hooker android, Clementine (Angela Sarafyan). He points out their boss Robert Ford has uploaded a new update into the androids, to make them have more human gestures, based on old subconscious memories. Lowe is called away, Hughes kisses the hooker android after he leaves.

Lowe goes to a meeting with the Operations Manager Theresa Cullen ( Sidse Babett Knudsen) and Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) due to some unauthorized activity, they are preparing to enter the environment, Stubbs hints that the AI are like teens, ready to rebel. Lowe says there hasn't been a critical failure in 30 years. The humans take an elevator to sub level B83 and enter a wet room, ready with guns. They enter another room of androids standing silently in the dark. In a small glass walled room Ford (Anthony Hopkins) is chatting with an old cowboy android. Old Bill is the second host ever built. Bill goes and lies on a cot and covers himself with a plastic sheet. Lowe congratulates Ford on the new gestures update.

Dolores greets her father in the morning again. He warns her about a bandit on the loose, she has errands to run, she will return before dark. The train arrives in town, the sheriff arranges a posse, the hooker approaches Teddy, Teddy goes out to meet Dolores. This time the gunslinger meets her at the hitching post and says he has other plans that evening. He goes to the saloon.

A group on horseback ride a trail. A guest couple, husband and wife, are with the posse. They find a dead body, the Sheriff appears to freeze up as a fly crawls on his face. The wife says she is going back to town.

Returning to the Swamp after a long session in the OR, Capt. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda) receives a letter announcing that Ho-Jon (Patrick Adiarte) has been accepted into his alma-mater, though he and Capt. ""Trapper"" John MacIntyre (Wayne Rogers) still have the task of coming up with $2,000 for travel and tuition. Hawkeye convinces Trapper that they can accomplish it by raffling off a weekend pass to Tokyo with the company of a gorgeous nurse. They go to Lt. Col. Henry Blake's (McLean Stevenson) office to propose the idea to him, and he nervously gives them permission. Hawkeye convinces a nurse, Lt. ""Dish"" (Lt Dish is dating Hawkeye and Hawkeye convinces her to do the favor for Ho-Jon), to agree to be the nurse who will accompany the winner to Tokyo, but he promises that she'll be able to get out of spending any time with the winner.

Later on, Hawkeye and Trapper get into an argument with Maj. Frank ""Ferret Face"" Burns (Larry Linville), who, in a fit of rage, destroys their still. Furious with him, they put a bag over his head and throw him out of the tent. When Henry hears about it, he withdraws the passes and cancels the party they had planned to throw for fear that Frank will complain to General Hamilton Hammond (G. Wood). He adds that he has to see Hammond in Seoul and was unhappy about the party taking place in his absence. However, as Henry is leaving, Cpl. Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) reveals that he tricked him into signing two passes, so the party can take place. Unfortunately, Hawkeye's and Trapper's happiness is short lived as they discover that Frank was made temporary commander. To get rid of him so they can have their party, Hawkeye injects him with a sedative, wraps a bandage around his face, and puts him in a bed in post-op, prescribing a dose of sedative every hour.

An upset Maj. Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) comes to the party in search of Frank, who she has been unable to find. Suspicious of the activities of Hawkeye and Trapper, she calls General Hammond, a former lover, who is so excited to hear from her that he departs for the 4077 at once. Meanwhile, Hawkeye announces that they have raised $1800 and then has the nurse draw a name for the raffle. Hawkeye has fixed the raffle so that the winner is Father Mulcahy (George Morgan), but unfortunately, he announces this just as Hammond walks in.

While the infuriated general questions Hawkeye and Trapper, Margaret walks in with Frank, still sedated and with bandages around his head, and screams at the two of them. Hammond demands that they be arrested, but just in the nick of time, choppers arrive loaded with casualties. After the session, which Hammond participates in, he tells Henry that Hawkeye and Trapper are two of the best surgeons he has ever seen and, for that reason, he is dropping the charges."

Haweye manages to stabilize the general by pushing plasma. He is out of danger for the time being. He and Trapper later learn that the hydro-cortisone has been stolen by black marketeers, along with half of the other medical supplies (before it even left Seoul) and an entire replacement shipment (the truck was stopped by MPs for a routine check, and that's when the hijackers emptied the truck). When they go to Henry's office to complain (that they lost 200 vials of hydro-cortisone), they find him showing off a newly acquired, 100-year-old oak desk. Henry is too nervous to call General Hammond and demand action, so Hawkeye makes the call for him; however, Hammond refuses Henry's request for a fresh shipment as the 4077 has already received its shipment for the month, as far as the army is concerned. Plus, he has a meeting McArthur that evening.

Radar puts the doctors in touch with a black marketeer, Charlie Lee (Jack Soo), who asks $10,000 for a load of hydro-cortisone he has in stock. The price is too high for Hawkeye and Trapper (they start by offering a trade, like free hospitalization, appendix operations, nose jobs.. But Charlie's men already have a health plan and retirement benefits), so they offer to trade for Henry's desk (of which they say there is only one in the whole of South East Asia). Charlie later visits the 4077th, dressed as a South Korean general, in order to examine the desk. He agrees to the trade, on the condition that the desk must be ready to load onto a truck early the next morning; if it is not, he will sell the hydro-cortisone to another buyer.

Radar wakes Hawkeye and Trapper an hour ahead of the pickup so they can sneak into Henry's office and get the desk. Hearing the noises of their attempt to move it, Frank and Margaret separately approach the office to investigate. Upon finding one another, they rendezvous in the supply tent and lock the office door, leaving Hawkeye and Trapper with no way out. As Radar tries to persuade Charlie's truck driver to wait, the doctors take down one wall of the office and carry the desk out. Before they can get it onto the truck, though, Frank recognizes the driver from Charlie's previous visit (He believes that the driver and Radar are running the drug black marketing syndicate) and orders him off the base. With the truck now gone, Hawkeye tells Radar to call in a chopper pilot, who airlifts the desk out of the office and flies away to deliver it to Charlie as a stunned Henry watches from the ground. Charlie, now dressed as a private, delivers the hydro-cortisone as promised. Henry becomes suspicious, recognizing him as the visiting general, but Charlie only says, ""You know how it is, Colonel. We all look alike"""

Haweye continues to flirt with Cutler during surgery, and this is noticed by both Burns and Houlihan. Trapper tries to spend time with Cutler after surgery, regaling her with tales of his heroics in surgery. While they are all discussing surgical procedures in the mess tent Major Houlihan tells Cutler she needs to see her. Houlihan tells both Trapper and Hawkeye that they can forget about Cutler and she will make sure of that. After they leave, Hawkeye and Trapper both try to let on that they're going back to sleep or work. However, they both go to Cutler's tent (Trapper suggests that they share her, with Hawkeye taking the day watch and Trapper taking the night watch) and find her packing her things; Houlihan had her transferred to another unit because she was a distraction.

Hawkeye and Trapper go to Col. Blake's office to demand that Cutler's transfer be stopped. He tells them that Major Houlihan makes all the decisions about the nursing staff, but if one of them would box in the inter-unit boxing tournament he's ordered to participate in by Brigadier General Barker, he would see what he could do. Barker's boxer is the champion material and he is bringing him to the 4077 for the first fight. The nurse who fought in the tournament last year is gone. So, he needs one of Trapper or Hawkeye to step up for 3 rounds. After sadly watching Cutler drive off in a jeep, Trapper decides to fight. Trapper used to box in high school, but is not in shape.

Hawkeye spends some time training Trapper but neither are really confident about winning, especially after they discover Trapper has a ""glass stomach"". Even father Mulcahy says Trapper hasn't got a prayer. While the two are relaxing in the Swamp, Radar comes in and tells them that Trapper's opponent Sgt Flaker has arrived and that he heard that the guy is remarkably tough. The guy is huge, he knocks out jeep when angry and is mean. They decide the only way Trapper is going to survive is if they cheat. Capt. 'Ugly John' Black's (John Orchard) (Anesthetic) plan is to rub ether on Trapper's boxing glove and then to get his opponent in a clinch so that the ether's fumes will knock him out.

Later on, Pierce, McIntyre, Blake and Burns are sitting in the mess tent talking when General Barker and his boxer come in. After they leave, Henry asks Trapper if he wants to reconsider and Hawkeye tells Henry and Frank about their plan to use ether. Frank was sitting at their table having lunch, and hence overheard the entire conversation. During the introductions of the boxing match, Burns and Houlihan switch the ether with distilled water. When Trapper gets clobbered in the first round (he goes down twice and hits the mat), Hawkeye discovers the switch and runs to get real ether. During the second round, Trapper, with real ether on his glove, gets his opponent in a clinch, until he falls out of the ring, out cold, on top of Burns and Houlihan. Henry holds up his end of the bargain and gets Cutler transferred back to the 4077, where she is so impressed that Trapper fought for her, she completely ignores Hawkeye"

Blake's head to a general to protest the decision.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['E.W. Swackhamer'],"['', '']",[],"['military', 'soldier', 'military uniform', 'famous entrance']",[],"After a long O.R. session, Major Burns complains to Col. Blake that the surgeons respect Hawkeye more than him (no-one asks for his help in the surgery room, while Haweye is always asked to assist), even though Burns outranks him. He intends to press charges like insubordination, failure to salute an officer, lack of military courtesy. Hawkeye and Trapper find out that Burns writes to each of his patients back home every yr. He intends to restart his practice after the war. In the latter he greatly exaggerates his exploits that make him sound like a much better surgeon than he actually is. He was in practice for 3 yrs and had a $35K house and 2 cars.

In response, Col. Blake appoints Hawkeye as chief surgeon, to consult on all shifts. Haweye is the best cutter in the outfit. Certified in chest and general surgery. Burns is furious over the choice, believing that the position should be determined by rank and that, as the highest ranking surgeon (and the unit's second-in-command), he should automatically receive the position. Blake refuses to reconsider, reminding Burns that Hawkeye has two specialty certifications and that he performs better when ""the heat's on"". An angry Burns promises to bring plenty of heat to his commanding officer, and he and Major Houlihan go over his head to General Bradley Barker (Sorrell Booke) in the hopes that he will overrule Blake and name Burns the chief surgeon.

The general arrives just after the entire camp, with the exception of the two majors, have thrown a massive party for Hawkeye, and are now finishing off with sex, drinking, and gambling. Major Burns informs him that a badly wounded patient has been waiting in surgery for half an hour while Hawkeye is playing poker. When the general confronts Hawkeye, he orders him to perform the surgery. Hawkeye refuses, explaining to Barker that when the patient came into the 4077th, his condition made him too great a risk to operate immediately. Hawkeye also informs the general that he will not perform the operation until the patient is stabilized unless an emergency arises and that Barker is free to take over treatment if he desires.

Furious at Hawkeye's perceived insubordination, Barker storms across the compound looking for Col. Blake. He proceeds to inspect the entire camp and finds disrespect for military authority at every turn, including Corporal Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr), who is wearing a dress while on guard duty. He finds Radar in Blake's office, drinking his whiskey and smoking his cigars. By the time he finds Blake, Hawkeye has gone to the OR and Barker asks him about the condition of his patient. Hawkeye responds by telling Barker the patient is stable and ready for surgery. As Barker observes the surgery (Hawkeye finds all the large holes in the patient's lungs and even finds a small one which was not visible unless he looked for it.. He saw some bubbles in the blood that he could not account for), he realizes Hawkeye is more than qualified for his chief surgeon position and that his choice to wait to operate was the right decision. For this reason, he drops all the charges he had intended to press. General Barker also advised Col. Blake to give Major Burns ""a high colonic and send him on a ten mile hike"" as a punishment for Burns and Houlihan calling him to the 4077th and wasting his time. Later on Burns is operating and asks Hawkeye to assist. Hawkeye walks over and says to Frank, ""I'm ready, doctor.""."

Baker makes Young-Hi to carry all his gear, unpack it, run a bath for him, shine his shoes and all other menial jobs that he can think for her. The term ""moose"" derives from the Japanese word for daughter, ""musume"", and refers to female servants of servicemen, who may be treated almost as slaves. Young-Hi is just Baker's servant and not a sex slave. Hawkeye speaks with Blake to order Baker to release Young-Hi. Blake can order Baker, but he will simply pick her back up, 5 mins after he leaves the unit. Thats not a permanent solution. Haweye speaks to Young-Hi who confirms that she is not sleeping with Baker, but she doesn't want to run away as that would bring dishonor to her family. She can only leave when Baker releases her. Capt. 'Spearchucker' Jones (Timothy Brown) is Haweye and McIntyre's dorm mate.

Hawkeye Pierce is outraged and tries to convince Baker to let the girl go free. But Baker refuses to release Young-Hi as he knows Hawkeye is a temporary commission in the army. He even tries to by Young-Hi off Baker for $600, but he is not interested in selling her. Eventually, he plays poker with Baker (and cheats with a little help from Radar.). Radar is spying on Baker's cards from outside Haweye's tent and relays the information to Hawkeye via an earpiece that Baker cant see. Hawkeye cleans out Baker for $2200, including a $1200 IOU. Hawkeye insists that Baker settle the IoU in cash.

Baker agrees to trade Young-Hi for the debt he runs up. However, he explains to Young-Hi that she now belongs to Hawkeye, rather than that she is free (as was Pierce's intent). Young-Hi doesn't want to go home and is excited to work for Hawkeye. Hawkeye enjoys the service provided by Young-Hi. she cleans and arranges the entire swamp. Pierce first attempts to get rid of Young-Hi by sending her on a truck to Seoul, but she gets off when the truck stops for gas and hitchhikes back to the 4077th.

Eventually Pierce, Jones and McIntyre decide to ""demoosify"" Young-Hi and teach her how to be a person who deserves to be well-treated and not subservient. Hawkeye teaches her to speak like a normal person and not like a moose. He teaches her to look people in the eye, and not look down when spoken to. She is given some basic training as a nurse. They soon meet the head of Young-Hi's family and discover that he is Young-Hi's little brother Benny (Craig Jue) and that he immediately plans to sell her again. Initially, Young-Hi agrees with Benny out of loyalty to her family but then returns, having told Benny to ""shove off"".

In the end, Young-Hi is enrolled in convent school in Seoul. In the last scene of the episode, Pierce, McIntyre and Spearchucker Jones receive a letter from her. Roger Wilco."

Crandell Clayton (Herb Voland) recommends the 4077th which has the highest fitness record amongst all MASH units, plus is commanded by Blake, who is a friend of Clayton, in command of the finest team of surgeons in Korea. Bricker wants one of the doctors to ""star"" in his documentary and Hawkeye Pierce agrees when faced with the possibility that the role could go to Frank Burns.

The documentary is nothing more than turgid propaganda. Bricker wants patients to smile, while serving their nation. He wants Hawkeye to look serious and conferring with other doctors. He wants something dramatic inside the operating theatre. Bricker is not satisfied with Hawkeye and eventually asks Frank to take over the acting duties. Frank's script indicates that the doctors are all volunteers, and working hard to save American lives. The surgeons are called Yankee-Doodle doctors. Hawkeye and Trapper know that Bricker is only filming a bunch of lies for a fairy tale documentary.

In the night, while Radar occupies Bricker at dinner by getting him to tell stories of his movie career, Pierce and McIntyre destroy the film by exposing it to light. Blake figures out that Hawkeye and Trapper were behind ruining the film and confronts them. Hawkeye and Trapper know that there is no proof against them. Bricker decides to re-shoot the entire movie again without Hawkeye. Blake says Hawkeye is the heart and soul of the 4077 and wants Bricker to compromise a little. But Bricker would rather wrap up the shoot at the 4077 and go back to Seoul instead. Blake tells Hawkeye that Bricker and Clayton will simply shoot their movie at another MASH outfit and that will leave the 4077 out in the cold.

They persuade Blake to let them make their own film (by sending Bricker back to Seoul, but keeping his camera guy and all his equipment) and turn it into a comedy, casting Hawkeye as a Groucho Marx-type doctor, Trapper as a Harpo Marx-esque surgeon, and Radar as their hapless patient. The movie is screened at the mess tent at night, with General Clayton in attendance. The surgeons are shown as skirt chasers. The doctors don't admit any patients unless they have a reservation (which is of-course, absurd). The surgeons are depicted as hapless buffoons inside the operating theatre. They use a hammer as anesthesia. and a rusted saw as scalpel. The doctor leaves his wrist watch inside the patient, after surgery. They party all night and indulge in sex, debauchery and booze.

The final scene is a somber monologue by Hawkeye about the grim realities of war, delivered at the bedside of a patient in the post-op ward. He says patients have a 50-50 chance. Guns and mines have more power to take life than the doctors have to preserve it. No promises, no saints in surgical garbs. Blake is mortified and Clayton is unimpressed at first, while the rest of the crowd loves the film. Afterward, Clayton tells Blake to destroy it but save one copy for him, so that he can have something to laugh at once the war is over, and he will also use the final scene in his own documentary."

Hawkeye blames Trapper for nothing restocking the till, who in turns blames Hawkeye for being drunk all the time), and decide that they need some R&R. Radar confirms that the enemy has pulled back and thus the deluge of injured soldiers is over at least for a week. Unfortunately, Henry is leaving for a few days, leaving Frank-who is unlikely to let them have R&R for any reason-in charge. Blake refuses to sign any R&R forms for Hawkeye and Trapper before he leaves.

Hawkeye decides to pretend to be insane to try to get a few days off despite Frank's prejudice. He starts treating dogs in the post-op room. He rejects a proposition from an attractive nurse Cutler, eats a plate of ostensibly human liver (from a North Korean soldier who died in post-op) in full surgical garb, and reacts violently when Frank touches the plate (he says Frank is not sterile and has ruined the liver). Trapper tells Frank that Hawkeye is losing it, and that he (Trapper) should take him to Tokyo for R&R.

Uncertain about whether they are serious or if it is an elaborate act, Margaret calls in a psychiatrist friend, Capt. Philip Sherman (Stuart Margolin), to assess Hawkeye's emotional state. If anyone can spot a phony, he can. Hawkeye tells Sherman that he is in love with Frank. He sleeps with Frank's shaving brush under his pillow.. But Frank only has eyes for Hot Lips, who dyes her hair blonde. Hawkeye is thinking of dying his hair black, so Frank has a clear choice. Sherman declares him to be insane. When Henry returns and learns of Sherman's finding, he argues that Hawkeye was merely trying to get R&R, but Sherman insists that Hawkeye needs to be committed to a hospital in Tokyo. Frank and Houlihan see this as an opportunity to get rid of Hawkeye one and for all, and support Sherman and his findings.

Hawkeye, upon hearing this, confesses he simply wanted a holiday from the war, but Sherman, who has designs on Margaret, insists that he be sent for treatment. Hawkeye concocts with Radar an elaborate plan to foil Sherman, Margaret, and Frank's plan to get Hawkeye out of the unit. Radar talks to Sherman and plants ideas in his mind that Margaret, who has rebuffed all of Sherman's past advances, has the hots for him. Meanwhile, Trapper switches signs on Margaret's tent, leading Sherman to believe it is the VIP tent. After Sherman returns and settles in Margaret's cot, Trapper switches the signs back. When Margaret comes back and starts undressing, Sherman excitedly launches himself at her and drags her onto the cot. Margaret screams out and various members of the camp rush in, making it appear that Sherman was attempting to force himself on Margaret. Sherman flees the unit that night and Hawkeye is allowed to stay. He and Trapper are granted a week's R&R, but just as they are about to leave, a wave of fresh casualties ruins their plans."

Hawkeye is asked to perform surgery on Cowboy and to take out the bullet from his shoulder. He is anxiously awaiting a letter from his wife, who he fears is leaving him for another man (""She's probably off with some rodeo rider; she's a sucker for a 10-gallon hat!""). Frank wont allow Trapper to use an army jeep to take a nurse on a date. Trapper gets into a furious argument with Frank, which brings Blake into the picture. Blake says that army jeeps are not a personal taxi service and asks Trapper to find a different mode of transportation.

The Cowboy wants to be sent home before his marriage completely falls apart, but Henry refuses, stating that the Cowboy's wound is not serious enough to merit a discharge. Henry says everyone has problems back home. Even he has a wife and a bunch of credit cards that are overdue. The guys feel Henry Blake is going sour on them. The guys decide to give him some relaxation to take the pressure off him. Bad luck then follows Henry wherever he goes: he gets shot at while golfing with Hawkeye (They think that the North Koreans are shooting at them.. but the shot came from the direction of the camp), his tent gets flattened by a driver-less jeep, and the latrine is blown up with him inside it. Deciding to leave camp for a while (since he is bringing down the morale of the unit), he is nearly killed when his desk chair explodes. Henry initially thinks Trapper is behind this, as Henry refused the use of the army jeep to him for his date. Radar starts to maintain his distance from Henry as he is afraid of being caught in an accident too.

The Cowboy offers to fly Henry to Seoul since a jeep would take more than half a day, then tries to push him out of the chopper in midair. At the same time, Hawkeye and Trapper realize that these ""accidents"" have been the Cowboy's attempts to get revenge against Henry for not sending him home (They find gunpowder and detonators in cowboys's stuff in post-op). Cowboy is an excellent shot, who can shoot a moving snake at 50 feet, going at full gallop. Radar brings a letter from the Cowboy's wife, and Hawkeye and Trapper inform him over the radio that it has finally arrived.

The letter is postmarked Reno, Nevada, which sends the two doctors into a panic, given Reno's reputation (at the time) for quick and painless divorce proceedings. The letter also begins with ""Dear John"", the cliched opening of a letter to a man whose heart is about to be broken. It turns out, however, that the Cowboy's real name is John Hodges and that he does live in Reno. In the letter, his wife explains that she had felt herself tested by temptation, but her love for him has allowed her to overcome it. The Cowboy brings Henry safely back to camp and receives a month's stateside leave."

After a tearful goodbye, Henry moves to Tokyo Medical HQ for administrative and training duties..

Frank is second in command and thus moves in Henry's tent and takes charge of the 4077 MASH. He makes Radar work to the bone, to put the camp ship shape. Radar is not allowed to go to bed even at 2 am in the morning. Frank then changes the camp to be more military, introduces daily exercise, 6 am bugles, and he confiscates Hawkeye's and Trapper's still. Frank also puts them on report for being unshaven, out of uniform, beds unmade, and personal effects in unmilitary condition. The guys think about ways of getting rid of Frank, including killing him. Radar points out that there is no guarantee that things would improve with Frank out of the way. Frank's replacement might not even be a surgeon and could be even more classic military than him. The only answer really is to bring Henry back from Tokyo. Henry understood them and they understood Henry. They had a mature, grown-up relationship.

They use forged passes to go to Tokyo to convince Henry to come back. They say Frank is running the unit into the ground. Morale is down to zero and everybody hates each other. Leslie the nurse (whom Henry had a relationship with), also misses him and has gone off the rocker since he left. Henry has 3 classes a week in Tokyo and the rest of time is spent getting massages and spas and evenings spent in the company of lovely Korean ladies with sake. He loves his life and has no interest in going back to the 4077. Hawkeye and Trapper end up saying that Radar is sick.. He is having some weird symptoms (Abdominal cramps, chills and high fever for over a week) and they cant figure out what is wrong with him. They want Henry to write the letter to his family in case things go bad and he dies. Henry is concerned when he hears that Radar is sick. He loves the boy as his own dear son. He reserves a chopper under his own name, priority one, and flies directly to the 4077th.. Henry says he was the best diagnostician in Bloomington Illinois.

Their ruse is revealed when Radar panics as Henry wants to operate on him since it could be a perforated ulcer. Frank decides to be boss Henry around (he wants Henry to sign a Transient Medic form and a Visiting Physician in a combat zone) (Frank also wont allow Henry to operate on Radar without his go ahead), but Henry decides to stop Frank by assuming command then and there.

Missing pieces include Frank's silver picture frame (Frank kept a picture of his loving mother in that frame and is very upset), Margaret's hair brush (its an ivory brush, gifted to her by her father and Houlihan did 100 strokes of that brush on her hair every night before going to sleep), Haweye's stizzle stick and Trapper's watch. Henry is shown to be in a flirty relationship with Lt. Leslie Scorch (Linda Meiklejohn). Henry gets a gift for Leslie when he returns from Tokyo, but finds it stolen as well and only the box was left behind. Henry offers an amnesty if the thief returns all the stolen articles by 1900 hrs that night. But then, even more things end up stolen from the camp. The camp is searched by Henry (which reveals many secrets like Radar sleeping with his teddy bear, Leslie's collection of under garments) and everything is found in Hawkeye's locker, leaving the other MASH personnel suspicious of, and disappointed in, Hawkeye.

Hot Lips and Frank pressure Henry to court martial Hawkeye and Hot Lips threatens Henry of escalation to Gen Blake, if he does not initiate court martial proceedings against Hawkeye. Henry is forced to Hawkeye under constant surveillance. Radar is assigned to keep an eye on Hawkeye, but he is not very good at it, and only ends up staring at him. Even in the operating room, Houlihan keeps a track of every equipment Hawkeye uses. The entire camp is against him. even father Mulcahy thinks Hawkeye did it. The nursing staff is also avoiding being seen with Hawkeye.

Hawkeye manages to let it be known to the camp the location where the recovered items are being stored (Lt. Col. Blake's desk). When the items disappear yet again, Hawkeye summons many of the MASH personnel to the mess tent in the middle of the night in order to reveal the identity of the criminal. After parodying countless detective stories by revealing possible motives others might have to frame him (Frank dislikes Hawkeye enough to have him transferred, Houlihan is Frank's sweetheart in this crime, Jones hates Hawkeye because he loses to him at poker all the time, the nurses hate him as he is a player, Trapper is jealous of his for his popularity with the ladies, Radar was the only person with access to all the tents and was short enough to go un-noticed), he tells the assembled staff that he has treated the items with a chemical which, when it comes into contact with a human being, turns that person's fingernails blue.

When Ho-Jon hides his hands, Hawkeye knows he has found the criminal. (The chemical treatment story was merely a bluff.) Ho-Jon is not punished, however, as he has stolen the items only to raise money to bribe border guards to bring his family from the north to the south. The whole squad to let Ho-Jon keep the stuff and use it bring his family to south Korea The plot was presumably inspired by a similar ruse used by the mathematician John Napier to identify a thief among his household staff"

They believe Frank has hepatitis and try to keep him operating.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Terry Becker'],"['', '']",[],"['military', 'soldier', 'military uniform']",[],"Hawkeye and Trapper move a North Korean POW patient into the Swamp, rather than have him shipped out early. Frank forces Henry to take action against the North Korean and not give him bed space at the 4077. Hakweye argues that the man has multiple lacerations and if he is shifted to the PoW section of the camp, he is likely to die. Hawkeye tells Blake that he wants one day for the patient. Blake agrees to give them one day, but the patient cannot stay in post op. By moving him to the swamp, the patient is not taking up anyone's space, but Hawkeye's own.

They discover that the POW has a rare blood type AB Negative. If Blake uses the camp's supplies for the North Korean patient and if later one of the their own soldiers need it, Blake will catch hell for it and will have to answer to the General himself. Since Frank has the same blood type, they furtively steal some of Frank's blood in the night. However, when the patient develops hepatitis (abdominal pains, darkened specimen, nausea, cant keep anything in his stomach), they suspect Frank is the carrier, and have to keep him away from Margaret and patients till they get back a confirmation of whether Frank is infected or not. Frank refuses to give them a blood sample for testing.. All the blood they had of him, they have a little left over. But they need a urine sample as well, to back that up.

By way of apologizing for their machinations to determine whether or not Frank had hepatitis (they get Frank to drink 3 cans of beer (by way of tasting them to help them figure out what is wrong with the beer taste and which one is stronger) and then try to get his urine sample by getting Radar to block the officers latrines (He tells Frank that the latrines are closed for redecorating and that its high time that the US shows the Koreans democratic plumbing in action) and getting Frank to pee in a bucket) instead of simply being up front with him, Hawkeye presents him with a bouquet of daisies at the end of the episode. Hawkeye and Trapper send the urine sample to the lab in Seoul, but must wait 2 hrs for the results to come back. So, whenever Frank and Houlihan try to get together in a tent, Hawkeye signals someone on the base to cut them off and keep them from meeting. Then as Frank heads into surgery, Hawkeye suggests that he take a day off, since it is a light day. When Frank wont budge, they tell him how the North Korean patient got hepatitis from a blood transfusion from Frank. Frank still wants to go into surgery since symptoms take weeks to appear.. So, Trapper and Hawkeye handcuff him. Frank tests negative for Hepatitis when the lab reports come in, but tests positive for Anemia as his blood was taken without him being ready for it.

In the course of the episode, Margaret and Frank set up a rendezvous. Alan Alda does a very respectable imitation of Pete Smith, the MGM Studios short subject humorist famed for his ""Pete Smith Specialties"", describing their behavior and actions as the lovers go about their shenanigans."

Reminding him war might have been rough in the days of the Civil War but it's no picnic in modern times either. Fortunately, Hawkeye is writing the letter during a lull after three straight days of overwork in the O.R. He recounts in the letter how the tensions mounted between Trapper and Frank. Henry tried to ease tension by asking about the Bears/Packers game while Frank strongly suggested that the O.R. could use some military discipline. Hawkeye played if off as a joke but then recounts in the letter that humor in an operating room might seem like sacrilege but it's is a necessary defense against the stress.

In contrast to the stress in the O.R., Hawkeye recalls the ways in which Father Mulcahy tried keeping the spirit of the season alive and well despite the dismal setting of a war zone, first by setting up a makeshift nativity scene and then by getting some of the enlisted men to find a suitable Christmas Tree. Next Hawkeye recalls Radar's latest adventure, trying to secretly mail a jeep home one piece at a time. Hawkeye and Trapper were curious about what he was doing, so they took an X-ray of one of his packages and realized that it contained the steering wheel. When asked about the packages, Radar told Henry that they were toys for the orphanage, to which Henry was all too happy to help get it on its way.

Next up is a recounting of Henry's fumbling attempts to keep with the Army's silly regulation of providing the officers and staff with a monthly lecture. Unfortunately, this month's lecture is on premarital sex and the family, which a very nervous Henry clearly isn't fit to deliver. Naturally, Hawkeye and Trapper can't stop with the jokes, Margaret and Frank try to take things seriously, and Radar sits in the front row genuinely trying to learn something. Finally, Henry gets so nervous that he can't finish the lecture and bolts out of the tent to the applause of Hawkeye and Trapper. Next is Trapper who spent his off hours doing some very good work: giving shots, lollipops and smiles to the local Korean children from the surrounding area. During one of these sessions, he was called by an elderly Korean man to help a local who had gone into labor: a baby calf, for which he received a gallon of milk.

Over in recovery, Hawkeye recalls that while Father Mulcahy was still trying to spruce the place up with holiday cheer, an argument broke out between Frank and Klinger. It seems that Frank wanted him to remove his scarf (given to him by his mother) because it wasn't regulation. Klinger refused and Frank knocked the tray of specimens out of his hands leading to a scuffle. Father Mulcahy tries to break it up. Klinger knocks Frank cold, and the Father sends him away just as the M.P.s show up. After successfully persuading the officer to let him handle the situation he leaves recovery to finds Klinger who is on his way back with a hand grenade. Appealing to his sense of humanity, Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) tries to persuade Klinger to hand over the grenade, reasoning that everyone including Frank is tired. Klinger reasons that he can't take off the bandanna because he's afraid that it will bring him bad luck and something horrible will happen. Mulcahy assures him that he can keep it and Klinger turns over the grenade. Next he details the life and times of one Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan and her strange duality of femininity and military discipline. Her recent ""date"" with Frank was undone when Hawkeye and Trapper made their way into her tent while she was out and rearranged some things that turned the evening into a complete disaster.

Finally, the Korean children were getting all excited for the Christmas party, complete with Santa Claus - or in this case Hawkeye Claus, whom everyone is just hoping would arrive sober. Dressed as the right jolly old elf and on the way to the festivities he was intercepted by Henry who had just received an urgent message about an infantry squad that was pinned down by heavy crossfire on Hill 28 about 20 miles away. Their corporal was hit bad and needed a surgeon badly if he hoped to survive. The only person qualified for a chest wound was Hawkeye and the chopper at that moment was waiting to fly him out. So, Hawkeye was flown there and dropped onto the site still dressed as Santa.

Hawkeye signs off the letter on behalf of himself and everyone else at the 4077th. Merry Christmas!"

During the party, she is delighted when she is presented with a cake and some gifts but when everyone starts singing ""For She's a Jolly Good Fellow"" something inside of her breaks and she bolts from the party in tears. Later she confesses to Margie when it comes to men, she has never . . . had anyone who cared about her. At 28 years old, she feels that her time for romance has long-since dried up and blown away. Her last prospect was with a man back home who might have proposed if he hadn't been drafted. As her discharge draws near, she sees no prospect for romance when she gets back home.

Later, when Hawkeye is trying to make a move on Margie, she confides in him about Eddie's problem. Hawkeye admits that while she is a cute girl, she is also a test-case for clumsy. Moving back to making moves on Margie, she refuses and pushes him away. Margie make Eddie her mission. Radar overhears her in the nurse's shower (don't ask) talking about how if Eddie's love life does heat up, everyone else's is going to cool down. She puts the plan into action despite Hawkeye's reasoning that such a protest could be damaging for morale.

Frustrated by the sexless chill in the air, Hawkeye determines to break the siege by getting one lucky volunteer to try and romance Eddie despite her famously myopic skills in the amour department. Radar allows the men of the camp to draw straws. Unfortunately, the shortest straw is drawn by Hawkeye himself. Hawkeye's attempts to romance Eddie are humiliating to say the least. He has trouble warming up to her and she's more like a kid sister than a lover. Worse, she's a terminal klutz. Plus, she isn't entirely sure why Hawkeye would have any interest in warming up to her. Finally, he gets a date but Eddie is so excited that she steps on his ankle.

The preparation for the date is less like preparing for a night of romance than it is preparing to send a guilty man to his execution. The evening gets off to a bad start when Eddie answers the door and smacks Hawkeye in the face with it. While making a toast she splashes her martini on his chin. Embarrassed, she gets up to leave and smacks him in the eye with her head. Trying to get some kind of romance started, he puts on some music and offers her a dance - to which she immediately dances him right into the furnace. Then she knocks over a tray of glass, which he immediately steps on. When she tries to help him, she knocks him into a bookshelf and injures his shoulder. Finally, she loosens up enough to kiss him without hurting him. She comes to the realization that if she takes things slow, that she can be romantic with a man - that is, until she brings the stovepipe down on Hawkeye's head. Still in pain, he laughs it off.

A few days later Eddie is leaving the 4077 and Margie and Hawkeye are there to see her off. Margie admits that she's missed being chased around by him for the past week or two. He says he's ready to get back to normal. She responses by stepping on his foot."

Reporting the problem to Henry, he too has noticed a change in the little guy's behavior. First he found Radar curled up in the fetal position on top of the file cabinet and then he refused to provide the monthly report to General Clayton. Just then Margaret bolts through the door complaining about a screw-up in the supply order. Henry gets the idea to see if perhaps the problem is medical, so he suggests that they give Radar a complete physical.

Hawkeye and Trapper put Radar through the works but it turns up nothing. So, they assume that Radar's problem might my psychological. Appealing to him to open up, the kid finally hands them a phonograph record. It's a spoken-word Dear John letter from his girl Linda Sue back home. Seems that since Radar has been gone, she's taken up with local boy Elroy Femple and the two are planning to get married. After hearing this, Hawkeye and Trapper find Radar curled up in the fetal position. Determined to jump start his stalled love life Hawkeye and Trapper try finding a nice girl to set him up with. Hawkeye's first stop is Margie who declines because she already has a date . . . with Hawkeye! Meanwhile Trapper tries Lieutenant O'Brien who is in the shower. She says no, so Trap leaves her without a towel. Then Hawkeye tries Lieutenant Jones, but in describing the romance of the date they both get turned on.

They run out of options but just then Lieutenant Louise Anderson (Kelly Jean Peters), a new transfer, pulls up in a jeep. Radar makes eyes with her and falls instantly in love. As she is getting settled in, Hawkeye tries getting to know her a bit and finds out that she is a swarming intellectual. She knows his reputation and turns him down flat. Hawkeye, reports back to Radar with a stack of books to smarten him up, despite his simple-minded intellect. Hawkeye tries setting him up with a few key phrases to make him sound smart, but at lunch he basically fumbles the whole thing. Yet, Louise never-the-less buys that Radar is an educated man. This does not sit well with Margaret who is outraged that one of her nurses, an officer, is consorting with an enlisted man and demands to Henry that the relationship be terminated or she will report to General Clayton. Hawkeye determines to show her a little humility by threatening to break up the affair between Margaret and Frank. Officially, Henry denies any knowledge of this, but unofficially Hawkeye has his full support.

The scheme is to keep Frank and Margaret apart. The first date is easy, Trapper and Hawkeye slip chloroform into his cologne bottle. The second date is more complicated as Frank and Margaret try having a late-night rendezvous. It is waylaid by Radar who calls Margaret over to post-op. Meanwhile, Frank sneaks over to Margaret's tent only to find Hawkeye and Trapper lying in her bed. Margaret returns to her tent and desperately asks what she can do to get them to leave her alone. They ask her to ease up on Radar and Louise and cut out the G.I. nonsense. She refuses, so they determine to keep up the shenanigans. The deal is that she stop coming between them and to stop threatening Henry and to stop going to General Clayton when she doesn't get her way. Exhausted, she relents. The next day, Louise and Radar are having lunch together. Louise is lost in her own little world, babbling on about the misfortune of 19th century composers. When Hawkeye and Trapper join them at the table, they find that Radar is not listening, he's fallen asleep. All have a good laugh."

Not wanting to get into trouble for this generous act, Hawkeye lies and tells the good sister that it all came from Captain Tuttle. She is overwhelmed with gratitude but Hawkeye and Trapper don't want her to make a fuss since Tuttle is such a man of humility. In trying to straighten out the paperwork, Hawkeye tells Trapper that Tuttle was his imaginary friend as a child and apparently the fall guy for everything that he did wrong. Eventually, of course, when Hawkeye was drafted, Tuttle came right along with him.

The paperwork proves not to be a problem until it falls into the hands of Colonel Blake who quizzes Radar about who Tuttle is - he doesn't remember ever having met him. Radar does some fast talking to get the Colonel's mind around the fact that the man doesn't exist, until Henry recommends that Tuttle be made Officer of the Day. Things go from bad to worse when Frank and Margaret get wind of the new man at the camp and demand to see his file. Again, acting fast, Radar does some quick dodging to keep them at bay while Hawkeye and Trapper dream up a profile that can't be traced. When Frank and Margaret dig further Radar has to do some shuffling with the radio so that she can't check up on Tuttle with General Clayton up at H.Q. in Seoul. Hawkeye diverts her efforts by pretending to be the General on the phone.

The con game is starting to work its magic on Henry, who believes that he had breakfast with Tuttle, and with Frank, who believes that he and Tuttle are kindred spirits. But Henry gets more and more inquisitive and demands a meeting with the new man. Hawkeye, Radar and Trapper have their hands full running Henry and Frank all over the camp looking for Tuttle. Continuing the ruse, Hawkeye and Trapper then arrange for Tuttle to be paid a large sum of back pay. When the finance officer comes around, he is overcome with pride when Tuttle (actually Hawkeye in surgical garb) informs him that all of his future pay is to go directly to Sister Theresa's orphanage.

News of Captain Tuttle's generosity reaches General Clayton - the REAL General Clayton - and he insists that the good captain's generosity be made more tangible and more formal. When the General arrives at the 4077th to give Tuttle a medal, the captain is called into the compound. Hawkeye then shows up to give the general the bad news that while everyone else was at breakfast thinking only of their own stomachs, that Tuttle went out in a chopper to do some field surgery, taking along everything that he needed. . . except his parachute. Hawkeye delivers Tuttle's eulogy and there isn't a dry eye in the camp. Later Radar would like to know where he and Trapper came up with the parachute and the dog tags. Trapper tells him that they came from Tuttle's replacement Major Murdock."

Hawkeye and Trapper are busy removing a slug from the thigh of Colonel Buzz Brighton (Leslie Nielson). Margaret is overcome with hero worship. Brighton is a tough guy who brags that a slug in the leg won't keep him out of the thick of battle. Trapper warns him that when the local wears off, the pain will wash in. The Colonel is not phased - he believes that rest and relaxation is for the weak. Back at The Swamp, Hawkeye and Trapper get busy downing homemade gin and having a few laughs with the Colonel but again Trapper warns him to take it easy, that his wounds need time to heal both physically and psychologically. Brighton believes that the stress of war wounds is just an excuse for cowards to get out of doing their duty. He wants to get patched up and get back to his outfit. He's a fighter who believes that the superiority of combat is more important than the toll of humanity employed to create victories. Obviously, Hawkeye and Trapper disagree, but Buzz reasons that when the war ends, the doctors will go back to their practice but regular Army officers like him will effectively be out of work.

Quite satisfied with his warped point of view, Brighton leaves The Swamp to exercise his leg, leaving Trapper and Hawkeye to wonder about the fate of the men under his command. Hawkeye notes that Brighton is a ring banger, a man of authority who constantly keeps banging his ring on the furniture to remind them that he outranks them. He and Trapper reason that the only way to keep him from causing so much chaos is to make sure that the Colonel has a nice long stay at the 4077th. Working on a way to get him off the field of battle, they first look into his medical record only to find that he is not only in perfect health but that he holds the record at West Point for never having been on sick call. Worse, he's racked up a massive number of casualties among his men while only having gained half the ground. Trapper concludes that the best way to keep the Colonel out of the game is to work on his sense of reality.

At that moment, Frank begins snooping around and tattles to the Henry that Brighton's wound is superficial and that he should have already been released. Henry leaves it to Frank to find out what is happening, mostly because he doesn't want to be in the same room with him. Hawkeye and Trapper try to reason with Buzz and ask him to stay around for psychological observation, but Buzz won't hear of it. He's determined to get back to his outfit soon or the Army will give his command to someone else. He asks the boys for a second opinion from Henry, but they suggest that Henry's hard drinking might mar his judgment. Then Buzz asks about Frank, but Hawkeye suggests that his fitness as a doctor shouldn't be clouded by the fact that he's a cross dresser.

Frank stops by The Swamp to give Buzz a physical in order to get him on his way, but homophobic Buzz won't let the Major come near him. Flustered, Buzz exits The Swamp to go back to his tent only to find out that it has been moved. He quickly lays the confusion on his encounter with Frank. It is at this point that Margaret decides to investigate the Colonel's extended stay. She finds nothing in his medical file that seems out of place but Hawkeye explains his psychological condition and implores her to approach him, not as a fellow officer, but as a woman. He reasons that Brighton needs a woman's caring touch. Naturally, she buys every word.

In the shower, Hawkeye plants the seeds of deceit on Frank, asking him why he just saw Margaret getting all spiffed up for the evening. Frank doesn't have a date with Margaret and storms out of the shower to confront her about whomever she might be seeing behind his back. He puts it together that the date is with Buzz but she insists that there is nothing going on. In order to complete the circle, Hawkeye and Trapper inform Buzz that Margaret is hot to trot. Hawkeye's next stop is to Henry's office to get the old man boozed up. Margaret gets all dolled up and stops by Buzz's tent in an effort to use her charms to calm his apparent need for a woman's touch. But it turns out that Buzz isn't really all that interested in Margaret and asks her just to give him a release. As the sexual struggle gets hotter, Frank shows up. Margaret knows that he's there out of jealously, and so does Buzz . . . but not over Margaret.

Everyone eventually crowds into Buzz's tent for various prepared reasons and the whole situation frustrates Buzz who proves his mental instability by trying and failing to reason out that he is mentally stable, only the prove that he's really not. Hawkeye takes advantage of the moment and sends Buzz off in an ambulance. He's going back to the states for observation."

Hot Lips doesn't want him seen in her tent, and throws him out in the mud, before calling Trapper and Hawkeye for help. Trapper decides to put Frank in traction as that would help him recover faster. While recuperating in post-op, he puts himself in for the Purple Heart. Margaret justifies it by claiming that since the injury was sustained at a front-line unit (due to a ""slip in the mud on the way to the shower""), technically that makes it battle-connected.

Hawkeye's old friend Tommy Gillis (James T. Callahan) appears at the 4077th. They have known each other since the 5th grade. A reporter in civilian life, he is a combat soldier working on a book about life on the front lines called ""You Never Hear the Bullet"". He is writing the book from a soldier's perspective, to make it more real and authentic. The book is intended to show how death in battle can be sudden and not surrounded by any prior drama, unlike how it is often depicted in the movies. Tommy leaves for his unit just as wounded arrive at the compound. While operating on a Marine with appendicitis (Ron Howard), the doctors remark on how young he looks. Later, recovering in the hospital ward, the Marine asks Hawkeye how soon he can get back to the front and boasts about killing enemy soldiers. Hawkeye discovers that the Marine is in fact only 15 years old, having used his older brother's ID to enlist and go to Korea to win back his ex-girlfriend. The marine imagines he will return a hero from the war, with a medal and everything. Hawkeye gives the Marine some sage advice about women. Any girl worth having wont care if he has a medal or not.

Later, Tommy himself shows up as a casualty on the operating table, having been shot by the enemy on the front lines. Just before being anesthetized, he weakly tells Hawkeye that he in fact had heard a bullet just before being hit, just like in the movies. Hawkeye, close to tears, suggests that ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet"" is a better title anyway, and tries frantically to save Tommy's life. Unfortunately, Tommy dies on the table and Henry Blake orders Hawkeye to move away and help Trapper.

Hawkeye is later seen crying for his friend, but wonders why he never cried for any of the other men he has seen die while in Korea. Henry consoles him by remarking ""There are certain rules about a war. Rule Number One is: Young men die. And Rule Number Two is: Doctors can't change Rule Number One."" Not wanting to see another young man die needlessly, Hawkeye immediately reports the underage Marine to Major Houlihan and the MPs, sending him back to America and safety. The young Marine tells Hawkeye he will hate him as long as he lives and Hawkeye says he hopes it's a very long healthy hate. While initially furious, the young man forgives him when Hawkeye presents him with a medal - the Purple Heart that Frank was to be awarded (but was not entitled to)."

Hawkeye dares Trapper that he will walk into the mess tent naked, and no-one would notice. Hawkeye complains that everyone has become a zombie at the camp and nothing fazes anyone anymore, since they all see so much misery anyways on a daily basis. Everything goes well till a GI notices and that leads to wolf whistles and Klinger admonishing Hawkeye for his lack of taste. Hawkeye loses a $50 bet to Trapper.

Father Mulcahy has back trouble which the new surgeon Adam Casey attends to by straightening his spine. Casey is a terrific surgeon that Hawkeye looks upto. The North Koreans have been keeping the 4077 busy with a steady stream of casualties and having an extra pair of hands in the form of Adam was really helpful. Casey admits to Father Mulcahy that he is not really a doctor. Soon, Radar figures out that Casey is a sergeant and has MPs on the lookout for him. Radar tells Hawkeye, who tells Casey not to touch a patient without a license (Hawkeye was about to confront Casey in the mess, but the choppers brought wounded.. So, Hawkeye decides to keep Casey away from the patients in surgery), but encourages him to get one. Casey says he has impersonated a teacher, an engineer, surgeon, he can do it all. He just never had the patience to do it by the book. Hawkeye's failure to throw the book at him causes Casey to reassess his career choices: and an R.C. priest named Schwartz (that is Casey's real name) is born.

Radar has signed up for a correspondence course (from the AAA High school diploma company of Dellavin Indiana) to become a high school graduate. Radar hadn't studied for his exam and hence tried to get Henry to sign his passing certificate. But Henry notices this and refuses to sign his passing papers till he cleared his test. Radar sits for the exam but flunks every question (He had taken a peek at the question paper, but had memorized the answers in the wrong order). Henry does not have the heart to fail him, and passes him regardless. There is more fun to be had over Hotlips' recent tiff with Frank (The King Kong and Fray ray of the 4077); Hot lips sends away Frank when he is only interested in sex, while she wanted to have an intelligent conversation. Frank gets drunk on gin with Hawkeye and Trapper, he stays up all night and wont let Hawkeye and Trapper sleep either and confides that his own brother used to call him Ferret Face. He then falls down drunk.

He asks for long underwear, parkas with fur liners, and nice woolly caps. Hawkeye receives a pair of long-johns from home. He is warm and is really enjoying the weather. Hawkeye is miserable and tries to buy the long johns from Hawkeye, who refuses to sell them. Hawkeye gives them to an ill Trapper out of sympathy and Trapper loses them to Radar in a poker game. Hawkeye protests since he only gifted the long johns to Trapper since he was dying of cold. But Trapper was down to his last $3. Trapper and Hawkeye are back to being miserable and cold.

The long-johns proceed to pass through the hands of almost everyone in the camp: Radar is attracting the nurses, who give him a lot of attention due to the long johns. Radar gives them to the mess cook (Joseph V. Perry) in exchange for a whole lamb roast with mint jelly. Radar loves food so much more that he gives up the nurse for the rack of lamb. the cook bribes Frank with them to avoid being demoted because of the unsanitary conditions of the kitchen. Hawkeye is furious to see the long johns on Frank, but Frank insists that possession is 9/10ths of the law. Hawkeye had to back down.

Margaret is angry that Frank always talks about his wife. She wants to know what he would give up for her sake. Frank says the moon, when Margaret wants to hear that he would give up his wife for her. Frank gives the long-johns to an intimidating Margaret as a sign of devotion to her (Margaret is furious at Frank for letting her freeze, and kicks him out of her tent, after she takes the long johns), before Klinger steals the long-johns from Margaret's tent. Klinger was having to bear the winter in thin cocktail dresses and learnt from Frank that Houlihan had taken the long johns from him. Margaret is horrified and asks for help from the first person she can find, Hawkeye. A remorseful Klinger then gives the long-johns to Father Mulcahy (he says if he return the long johns to whom he took it from, he is likely to get killed in return), who in turn gives them to Henry (but not until after he spends the night wearing them and had his first real night's sleep in 10 days).

Henry claims he will return the long-johns to their rightful owner but gets caught putting them on by Hawkeye and Trapper. Henry rebuffs Hawkeye's demand that the long-johns be returned. Just then Henry comes down with abdominal pain. He has been having this pain for 2 weeks and has been throwing up and he has fever. Hawkeye examines Henry and says that it is his appendix that is acting out.

Radar is collecting on the betting pool from everyone even Father Mulcahy. Meanwhile, Henry has gathered several officers and nurses into his office to listen to game on the radio. Unfortunately, right at kick-off, the North Koreans spoil the party as bombs begins to drop just a few feet from the camp. The personnel begins to hunker down, putting mattresses over the windows of the O.R. and getting the wounded to safety. As Radar tries to get regimental headquarters on the phone, Henry his hit by several shell fragments that blow through the office and suffers a minor head injury. With Henry out of commission, Frank insists that hes in charge since hes second-in-command. Just then an approaching bomb is heard, but the result is a thud rather than a boom it seems that the bomb has landed in the middle of the camp but didn't explode.

Hawkeye makes it back to the office just as Radar gets Colonel Hersh (Alan Manson) of regimental headquarters on the phone. He appraises Hersh of the situation, not only of the bombing but of the unexploded shell currently taking up residence in the middle of the camp. Hersh advises Hawkeye to handle the bomb with extreme caution, listening to it with a stethoscope to see if it is still ticking and writing down any serial numbers so that the origin of the bomb can be determined and also asks him not to call him back until halftime. Hawkeye immediately assigns Frank the job of going out to check the bomb since hes the one in charge. Just then Trapper walks in and the three draw straws to see who goes outside. Frank draws the short straw and immediately faints. Trapper and Hawkeye play evens and odds to see who gets to go out Hawkeye gets the dubious honor. Wearing socks and a helmet liner, Hawkeye very gently makes his way outside and toward the bomb. As he starts listening for any ticking, a still shell-shocked Henry emerges from O.R. and begins shouting. Henry quickly comes to understand what is going on and quiets down. Hawkeye nervously reports that the bomb is ticking away loud and clear.

Henry finally comes back around and calls Colonel Hersh with the information about the bomb, but Hersh doesn't recognize the serial numbers or the identifying marks as anything hes familiar with. He suggests that Henry call The Navy. When Henry questions why the Navy would drop a bomb on them, Hersh supposes its because Army is beating Navy 14 to nothing. Meanwhile, Klinger goes to see Father Mulcahey, not in a dress but in a nicely-tailored suit designed for a man! He confesses that this is the suit he planned to wear when he got his discharge, but hes wearing it today because hes not sure if the bomb will go off and kill him. He further confesses that he only wears dresses to get out of the Army because he was brought up to respect all life, and also that if the bomb fails to kill him that he will immediately go right back to wearing dresses.

Rader gets Commander Sturner (John A. Zee) of The Office of Naval Operations on the phone and turns them over to Henry. Sturner tells Henry that the best thing to do is to bug out, but Henry tells him that's not an option. He asks if they are bombing inland and if they have a shell with the serial numbers that Hawkeye retrieved. Sturner takes down the numbers and says hell call back shortly. Several members of the 4077th begin preparing for the worst, including Frank and Margaret who share a bottle of champagne that she had been saving for New Years. Meanwhile, Henry tells Radar about a mishap from college when he was serving as team manager at the Ohio State-Illinois game. Seems the quarterback Tank Washington twisted his ankle, and Henry taped up the wrong leg, a mishap that bred a grudge that resides to this very day. Every year, Tank comes by Henrys house to shoot out the porch light despite the fact that hes a judge.

On his way over to O.R., Radar spots Nurse Hardy (Sheila Lauritsen) and fumbles as he tries to confess his true feelings for her and suggest that since the immediate future is in question that they visit the supply tent together. Shes flattered, hes confused. She takes him by the hand and leads the way across the compound. Meanwhile Hawkeye, Trapper and Ugly John are involved in a high stakes poker game high stakes if the bomb goes off and low stakes if it doesn't. Sturner finally gets back with Henry on the author of the unexploded shell. Seems it belongs to the C.I.A. who wouldn't tell anyone that they had their own bomb. Henry tells Trapper and Hawkeye that the Navy thinks that the bomb could go off in another hour, but if it stops ticking it might have two minutes Sturner might have been more positive with the fact but the C.I.A. wouldn't tell him their business.

Hawkeye and Trapper are charged with disarming the bomb, with Henry safely behind sandbags shouting instructions through a bullhorn. But he fumbles the instructions halfway through, and the bomb stops ticking. Hawkeye and Trapper hit the deck as the bomb goes off, not flinging shrapnel or fire but hundreds of pieces of white paper its a propaganda bomb. Hawkeye grabs a piece of paper and reads Give yourselves up, you cant win! - Douglas MacArthur. Later that day, after everything has settled down, the final score of the game is announced, Navy-42 Army-36. The winner of the betting pool turns out to be none other than Father Mulcahy. Hawkeye wonders how he has such good luck, to which the Father simply looks skyward. Meanwhile Radar spots a nurse hanging her laundry on the line.

When it is interrupted by incoming wounded, Hawkeye and Margaret operate on a patient and Hawkeye insults Frank by saying that he doesn't know what he is doing on the operating table with his patient. This time the insult goes outside the operating theatre and Hawkeye gets personal against Frank at the lunch table. Hawkeye says that Franks is consistently bad at his job as a surgeon. He asked for help 3 times in a single session and when he makes a mistake, he doesn't have the sense to admit it and start over. He is insulting to the nurses, bloody arrogant, demanding, distracting and dumb. and surgically incompetent. He would let Frank operate on him for dandruff. A definitive pain in the butt. Hot lips tells Henry that she will go to Geneal Blake if Hawkeye doesn't stop and apologize to Frank, in public.

The patient that Hawkeye operated on, had a large metal fragment from a grenade. He had a hole in his Iliac artery and the fragment was close to his spinal cord. The patient was in danger of being paralyzed, but Hawkeye's expert hands saved him. However, Hawkeye's patient fails to improve after surgery (fever, abdominal pain, pulse 112, BP 110 over 70.. temperature 101). Hawkeye starts him on IV penicillin as he might be having a wound infection. Hawkeye becomes overly concerned with the case (as the white blood count drops to 18000 and the temp rises to 102), to the point of attacking Frank over comments at lunch (Frank says that the super surgeon has messed up for once.. And that Frank didn't kill anybody that week), sleeping in post-op, snapping at Trapper for playing poker too loudly (after he himself refused the offer to join them at the poker game), and moving out of the Swamp to the supply tent.

While Hawkeye retreats to the supply tent to reflect on the case, he is interrupted by his date (whom he turns away), Trapper (whom he turns away as well), two other soldiers, and Henry. Henry implies that Hawkeye is concerned more about his ego than about his patient. He says Hawkeye cannot be so in knots about a single patient in an outfit like this. he cannot be Dr. Perfect in this GI butcher shop. Hawkeye replies with a glib remark about Henry's intelligence, which ultimately insults Henry and allows Hawkeye some peace and quiet.

While pondering the case outside the supply tent, Hawkeye encounters Margaret and she theorizes that they made a mistake during surgery (there were a lot of fragments and maybe Hawkeye missed one), eliciting extreme doubt from Hawkeye, who in turn insults her (she was just assisting and he was in charge of the surgery). During the night, Hawkeye has an epiphany and reopens the patient to find a small piece of shrapnel damage behind the sigmoid colon, at which point Frank states that ""anybody could have missed that."" Hawkeye responds with a sincere ""Thanks, Frank."""

As he does to his wife.. Houlihan starts hitting Frank with stuff from inside her tent.. Then they make plans to take leaves at the same time and meet in Tokyo.. Then they proceed to have sex), she also demands a transfer (as she has been publicly humiliated). Henry is livid with Hawkeye and Trapper, and vows to do more than just fire them. They were directly responsible for the loss of a general surgeon and the head nurse of the 4077 MASH unit.

Hawkeye and Trapper are glad to be rid of the pair at first, but then learn that they will have to work double shifts until replacements arrive. This means that they are working almost non stop. Replacements in the army can take forever. They finally realize that they have gone too far. They need to figure out a way to make Frank stay. They know that Frank is greedy for money.

To trick Frank into staying, the two surgeons lead him to believe that large deposits of gold can be found near the camp. They leave the small sample of the gold filling from the dentist office on their table at the swamp as proof. They do all this, while Frank was pretending to be asleep. Frank goes by the creek near the camp, and finds rocks painted with gold left by Hawkeye and Trapper.. But he believes he found real gold just lying around.

His greed gets the better of him and he withdraws his transfer request, after which Hawkeye and Trapper humiliate him again by driving past him in a jeep that they have painted gold"

Michael finds his brother G.O.B. and asks for his check for the party, to which G.O.B. responds that he will be performing the Aztec Tomb illusion at the party and suggests Michael charge the party to the company's credit card. He then lets slip that their sister Lindsay has been charging her month-long visit to the city to the company.

Michael visits his mother Lucille at her apartment and confronts her about using the company credit card on Lindsay. He learns that the company has also paid $16,000 for the Aztec Tomb and $40,000 to Lindsay's anti-circumcision charity H.O.O.P.. Lindsay and her husband Tobias Fünke arrive at Lucille's apartment and Michael gives them all an impassioned speech about the virtue of hard work.

At the retirement party aboard the Marina Hornblower George decides to name Lucille president of the company, and quietly apologizes to Michael. Michael makes the decision to move him and his son to Arizona away from his family's self-delusions and selfishness when the SEC raids the party and takes George into custody. Buster, Michael's younger brother and perpetual graduate student, attempts to steer the boat to freedom but suffers from a panic attack.

The family gathers at the police station where they learn George will be kept in custody and all accounts have been frozen. The family reacts to the latter. Lucille names Buster to be acting president of the Bluth company but he suffers another panic attack. The family, tired of attempting to find other work, asks Michael to come back and help run the company. Michael realizes they legitimately need his help and that his son would be better off with more family in his life, so he agrees to stay.

George Michael and Maeby While working at the banana stand, a Bluth family operation since the 1950s, George Michael is approached by Mae ""Maeby"" Fünke, his cousin that he rarely sees. She suggests they make out at the retirement party to teach Lindsay a lesson about keeping them separated. George Michael expresses fear that it is illegal.

At the party, Maeby grabs George Michael and kisses him as Lindsay passes. Lindsay doesn't notice and Maeby sulks off. George Michael, however, is aroused by the kiss and begins to struggle with feelings toward his cousin. He becomes incredibly uncomfortable when he learns that he and Maeby will be sharing a bedroom in the model home.

Tobias's piracy Ever since Tobias lost his psychiatrist license after performing C.P.R. on a sleeping man he had been searching for a new life calling. When Michael jokingly suggested the retirement party was pirate themed, Tobias took it seriously. He dressed in Lindsay's clothes and accidentally boarded a boat with some gay men to protest the yacht club's refusal to let gays marry at sea. He befriended the men and realized he wanted to be an actor."

George Michael tries to find time away from Maeby so Michael makes him manager of the Banana Stand. When Michael finds his family lying around the model home he decides that Maeby should work at the Banana Stand to avoid becoming lazy. At the Banana Stand, Maeby regrets her decision and convinces George Michael to take some money from the register to go play ske-ball.

Michael heads over to his mother's apartment to ask her about the location of the flight records. She refuses to tell him but he later thinks of a ruse to get Lucille to lead him to the records: he warns her of an IRS audit on her furs. Lucille has Luz take all her furs to the storage unit where the flight records are kept. Michael tracks Luz and finds out T-Bone has burned the unit down.

Michael is confronted by G.O.B., who wants to be given some responsibilities. Michael asks him to mail a single letter. Michael then heads back to prison to make a stand against his father, who tells him ""there's always money in the Banana Stand"". The next day T-Bone begins working at the Banana Stand, as hired by George Sr., so Maeby and George Michael take off to have lunch. At the restaurant, George Michael realizes they are doubling their losses by throwing away bananas for every dollar they take and begins to panic.

Michael then finds T-Bone at the Banana Stand and heads to the beach to clear his head. Michael then receives a call from Maeby, warning that George Michael is about to burn down the Banana Stand. He agrees to help him as a sign of defiance against George Sr. While they watch it burn, Michael asks G.O.B. if he has mailed the stand's insurance check. G.O.B. had hurled it into the sea, and flees Michael on his Segway.

Michael cockily eats an ice cream sandwich at prison and tells his father that the Banana Stand has been burned down. George becomes angry, and tells Michael there was $250,000 lining the walls of the Banana Stand.

Tobias heads out into the world to find an audition. Michael shows him a flier for an open casting call for a ""fire sale"" TV advertisement. Tobias auditions for the ad as if it were a real fire. When the casting director Roger Danish sees Lindsay's reaction to the sale, he gives her the part. Lindsay celebrates her new job and Tobias is seen crying in the shower. Lucille takes her daughter out to lunch, and the two make jabs at each other throughout the lunch.

The next day, Linsday oversleeps and misses the ad taping. Tobias misses his call from Roger Danish because he was crying in the shower again."

Buster is later put in charge of building a bicycle for George Michael. He forgot to install breaks, however, and crashes when he takes it out for a ride with Michael. A lonely and bitter Lucille returned to the office to get Buster but Michael said that Buster was doing fine without her. Buster then stood up for himself and told Michael that he liked living with his mother. He then firmly told his mother that he would sit in the front seat, a small but significant act of independence from his mother.

Fry playing the video game Monkey Fracas Jr. at the pizzeria he works at. Fry loses the game and is then sent out to his next delivery at Applied Cryogenics. On his way, he sees his girlfriend Michelle in a cab with another man, Charles Constantine. Michelle, proclaiming she's left Fry's stuff on the sidewalk, speeds away with Constantine with his car. Fry keeps riding his bike, saying, ""I hate my life. I hate my life."" He makes it into the lab where a guy outside says, ""Happy New Year!"" and rides away on Fry's bike. Upon arriving at the Cryogenics chamber and trying to find I.C. Weiner, the pizza's intended recipient, Fry realizes he's been duped and was sent on a prank delivery. Sitting down in a chair, he balances onto its back legs, cracks open a beer and says, ""Here's to another lousy millennium."" The entire world is counting down on New Year's Eve and as the countdown hits ""one"", Fry blows a party horn to celebrate the millennium. As soon as he blows it, Nibbler pushes Fry's chair and Fry falls into the Cryogenic Pod. The freezer freezes Fry and he is frozen and stuck there for 1000 years. Over the course of the next thousand years, the Planet Earth is repeatedly destroyed by invading aliens and rebuilt as Fry waits in stasis.

In the year 2999, Fry is released from his cryochamber and wakes up on New Year's Eve. With a shock, he realizes he is in the future and laments the loss of his family and friends but quickly dismisses his sadness with a loud ""YA-HOO!"" Terry, a worker at Applied Cryogenics welcomes him to ""the world of tomorrow"". Fry is escorted to the fate assignment officer's office, where he meets Leela, a beautiful woman with a huge eye in the center of her face, who explains that it is December 31, 2999. Talking things through with Leela, Fry confesses that the 20th century didn't hold anything for him and he feels optimistic about the future. After an encounter/examination with the Probulator, a DNA scan reveals that he has only one living relative in this time period: his many times great nephew Hubert J. Farnsworth.

Fry starts to make himself a promise that, with his ""second chance"", he's going to make the most of his life and not mess things up again. A menacing chime brings him out of his reverie as Leela reveals she's found him his permanent career assignment: delivery boy. Fry begs for any other job but Leela says that everyone, even herself, has to do a job whether they like it or not, citing that, in the future, ""you gotta do what you gotta do"". She tries to implant a Career chip that will label Fry as a delivery boy forever, but Fry runs away. Giving chase, Leela ends up falling into one of the cryogenic tubes, which sets itself for 1000 years much like Fry's tube. Fry then leaves her to be frozen there but, out of the goodness of his heart, decides to reset the tube to thaw in 5 minutes, says ""You owe me one."" and leaves the lab.

Walking around New New York City and seeing how much it has changed, he decides to call his relative Farnsworth. He gets in line for what he thinks is a phone booth and meets Bender waiting in line. It turns out the phone booth is actually a suicide booth and that Bender is eagerly awaiting his death. After accidentally activating the machine, Fry pushes Bender to the other side of the booth and they survive.

Having failed at killing himself again, Bender invites Fry to get drunk with him at a bar. Meanwhile, Leela's stasis chamber is timed out and she is unfrozen, Terry again appearing and being told to shut up. After being yelled at by her boss for losing Fry, Leela is forced to continue her pursuit of Fry. Fry finds out that Bender wants to kill himself because of his programming as a girder-bender for suicide booths. Fry convinces Bender to abandon his plans of suicide and the two become friends. Leela spots them inside O'Zorgnax's Pub and after requesting backup, chases them into the Head Museum where Fry encounters the head of Leonard Nimoy. Fry asks Nimoy to do ""the thing"" (the Vulcan salute) but being a head in a jar, naturally he can't. Leela catches up with them and Fry and Bender run for it but knock over the shelves, on which sat Richard Nixon's jar, which breaks. The backup Leela requested earlier arrives and they start beating up Fry. Leela sees the officers are out of control and helps get them off Fry. Hiding in the back room of the museum, Bender's programming prevents him from bending some bars to aid in his and Fry's escape. However, Bender is then able to bend the bars after getting electrocuted by a light bulb socket.

Bender and Fry run into the ruins of Old New York, where Fry has a flashback of ice skating with Michelle at Rockefeller Center on their first date. The memories of Fry and Michelle dancing fade into a two finned beast which bursts out of what used to be the ice rink, now a fetid pond. After realizing that everyone he knows is gone, Bender points out that he can see someone Fry knows: Leela has found them. Giving in, Fry resigns himself to becoming a delivery boy and readies himself to have his career chip implanted but Leela instead removes hers and declares she's quitting.

They finally track down Professor Farnsworth, who clarifies that Fry is indeed his uncle. After being given a tour of Planet Express, his delivery company, all four are shocked as the police knock on the door having tracked them down. They plan to get away on the ship at the same time as the Earth counts down to the year 3000. As they prepare to take off the police have a cannon aimed at the Planet Express Building, ready to fire at them should they try to take off. As the take-off countdown and the planet countdown both reach zero, they blast off under the cover of fireworks celebrating the new millennium.

Fry, Leela and Bender realize they're all fugitives as they now no longer have career chips. Professor Farnsworth reveals he has kept the career chips from his old crew (in an envelope marked ""Contents of Space Wasp's Stomach"") and invites them to join his company. When Fry asks what his job title will be, Farnsworth tells him his job is to transport the cargo safely to its destination. Fry clarifies that he's a delivery boy, which Farnsworth confirms. Overjoyed with his new job, the Planet Express ship flies off into the cosmos."

Quickly, he tries to turn it off but Leela turns it back on again. Bender then admits that he likes to cook but was too embarrassed to tell it to anyone.

Hermes threatens to cut Bender's salary, since Bender has no official duties at Planet Express except sitting on the couch watching the cooking shows all day, something he wanted to keep to himself.

Inspired by the Neptunian TV chef Elzar, Bender decides to take on the job as the ship's cook. He, Fry and Leela go to shop for ingredients in Little Neptune. While Bender is buying a Neptunian Slug, Fry tries to get his lungs replaced with gills by an organ seller. Just as the seller was about to do unsafe surgery, Leela interrupts the transaction, knocking out the dealer and his crony.

She berates Fry afterward for his reckless behaviour. Professor Farnsworth then sends the crew off on a delivery to the planet Trisol, a mysterious world in the depths of the Forbidden Zone in the Galaxy of Terror. Leela claims that the scary names are a false conception of the galaxy. Bender serves the crew a meal of salty Neptune slug and salted water.

After the ship lands, Fry is assigned the task of making the delivery trek across the desert under the planet's three blazing suns. When he arrives at his destination, the Trisolian palace, he finds it empty. Stricken with thirst, he grabs a bottle of blue liquid that is sitting on the throne and drinks it. Armed Trisolians, who are revealed to be liquid-based organisms, storm the throne room, revealing that the bottle Fry drank actually contained the emperor Bont the Viscous. Rather than being punished, Fry is declared the new emperor. Shortly afterward, he opens the package that he was delivering, to reveal a ""Please don't drink the Emperor"" sign. Ironically, Fry declares that the package arrived just in time.

After being found by the crew, Fry chooses Bender as his new prime minister. The high priest Merg informs Fry that as part of the coronation, Fry will have to recite the royal oath which consists mainly of a very, very long list of emperors, in the order that they killed each other from memory, on pain of death if he makes a mistake. During the pre-coronation party, Leela informs Fry that the average reign of a Trisolian emperor is only one week, as whoever ""drinks"" the old emperor is declared the new one. When Fry refuses to listen to her warning, Leela returns to the ship, vowing not to help Fry again. Fry, apparently aware he cannot be drunk because he is solid, ignores this.

At the coronation, Fry recites the oath properly and is sworn in as Fry the Solid. As the suns set, the Trisolians begin to glow - including the alive-and-well emperor Bont from inside Fry's stomach. Bont demands that Fry be cut open and drained.

The crew takes refuge in the throne room and tries to work out a way to extract the emperor without killing Fry. Bender calls Leela on Fry's behalf, but gets an inconclusive response. She has to fight her way past Trisolian forces in order to reach the palace.

Bender sees what is happening and decides to exploit the situation: He lies to Fry by saying that Leela is dead. This prevarication saddens Fry so profoundly that he begins sobbing, though slowly. After Leela arrives, she begins beating Fry, causing him to weep in pain, extracting the emperor. Once he is out, the emperor beats Fry up, taking turns with the other crew members, as well as thanks him. With the emperor safely outside Fry's body, the crew is allowed to leave."

In 1963, Rob and Beth Ann Stanton move into their mansion in Pasadena following the death of their daughter. After meeting Leo and Sheila Mosconi, Beth Ann overhears Sheila reveal that Leo witnessed Rob kissing a waitress at a diner in Glendale. Beth Ann refuses to believe her husband's infidelity until he calls Beth Ann and tells her he's meeting a client. Beth Ann goes to the diner, and sees Rob kiss the waitress. At Sheila's advice, Beth Ann goes to the diner to confront the waitress, whom she learns is named April. However, Beth Ann loses her nerve and instead befriends April, although she keeps her identity secret from her husband's mistress by saying her name is Sheila.

In 1984, Simone and Karl are hosting a house party. Simone receives an mysterious envelope addressed to her, with a strip of photo booth pictures of Karl kissing a man inside. Simone confronts Karl and wordlessly confesses that there have been others. She demands that he packs. Later, Simone finds Karl slumped on a chair in the bedroom having attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. Simone swiftly calls an ambulance, with the neighbors congregating outside. Simone lies and tells them he fell down the stairs. Her friend, Wanda, who has long resented Simone for always flaunting about money and how perfect her life is while she works through a divorce and drinking problem, doesn't buy her lie. She reveals she was the one who sent the pictures of Karl kissing a man in the envelope. Simone pins her to the ground, with an EMT having to pull them apart. The next day, Naomi's son, Tommy, who was a waiter at the party, admits to Simone that he saw the photos and makes a romantic pass at her. Simone declines his advances, but Tommy states that unlike the men she married, he is in love with her.

In 2019, Taylor and her husband Eli have an open marriage. Taylor breaks the ""no hookups in the house"" rule when she lets her lover, Jade, stay for the weekend after she is threatened by a dangerous ex-boyfriend, Duke. Eli initially opposes, but eventually agrees when he finds himself becoming attracted to her, and allows her to stay longer if she wanted.

In the closing monologue, the wives Beth Ann, Simone and Taylor talk about a woman's motive for killing, who they would kill and could they get away with it."

The show opens with an establishing shot of New York City in the year 2418. Ed Mercer arrives by commuter pod to his apartment. He hears his wife, Kelly Grayson, giggle from the bedroom. He opens the door to find Kelly in bed with a Retepsian named Darulio. She pleads to talk with him but he returns to the pod and leaves.

A year later, Admiral Halsey summons Mercer to his office in Planetary Union Central. Halsey acknowledges that Mercer's performance in the past year has markedly declined, tardiness and sloppy workmanship hurt Mercer's record, but ""the Union needs captains"" and offers Mercer command of the USS Orville, a mid-level exploratory cruiser. Mercer hurries to find Gordon Malloy, a former pilot, and enlists him as helmsman of his new ship.

Mercer and Malloy fly to the Union Dockyard orbiting Earth, where the Orville awaits.

ACT 2

In the ship's Shuttle Bay, Mercer introduces himself the crew of the ship. He meets the senior staff: Chief of Security Alara Kitan, Navigator John LaMarr, Second Officer Bortus, Chief Medical Officer Claire Finn, and Science and Engineering Officer Isaac.

Before departure in the afternoon, LaMarr meets Malloy in his quarters. Malloy explains that he was disciplined for damaging a Union craft with a risky flight maneuver. ""I was trying to impress a girl,"" he admits. Halsey tours the ship's interior with Mercer one final time before wishing the captain good luck.

The Orville departs the Dockyard and embarks on its first mission under the new captain.

ACT 3

The bridge crew discuss their mission to resupply the Epsilon Science Station on the colony planet Epsilon 2. While on route, Halsey sends orders to briefly rendezvous with a nearby station to pick up their new First Officer. Mercer reads the new addition's name and stampedes to his office.

Mercer calls Halsey, incensed that the new First Officer is none other than his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson. Halsey dispassionately replies that complaining about the placement on his first day ""will not look good,"" and Mercer is stuck with the decision.

Grayson tepidly enters Mercer's office and apologizes for her affair. She continues that she requested the transfer to Mercer's ship to atone for her behavior, but the conversation quickly devolves into an argument about their relationship prior to the divorce. Grayson concludes by saying that she will transfer to another ship as soon as an opening becomes available.

Grayson meets Malloy in the hall. She hopes that their relationship will be professional considering that Malloy and Mercer are close friends.

ACT 4

The Orville arrives at Epsilon 2. From the Bridge, Mercer speaks with the station's overseer, Doctor Aronov. Aronov looks panicked; the station needs no supplies, but the request was sent for an urgent matter that he will only discuss on Epsilon's surface.

A small away team to the planet is formed: Mercer, Grayson, Finn, and Kitan. Aronov gives them a brief tour of the facility, including giving Mercer a handful of modified redwood seeds that can can grow into a tree in any environment.

Aronov ushers the team into a wing of the facility where temporal fields are studied. A recent breakthrough has led to the creation of quantum accelerator, a device that can accelerate time inside a ""quantum bubble."" Janice Lee, a physicist researcher, demonstrates by aging a month-old banana to 100 years in only seconds. Kitan realizes that the accelerator is more than scientific equipment, it can be used as a weapon to turn ""entire armies into frail armies.""

Suddenly, a nearby lab technician pulls out a PM-32 and demands the accelerator.

ACT 5

The technician is Derek Ashton, an undercover Krill spy. He calls for a Krill destroyer to raid the facility and steal the device. From the Orville, Bortus attempts to communicate with Mercer, but Ashton forces Mercer to say the Krill come in peace.

Kitan manages to subdue Ashton. The team grabs the accelerator and flees to the shuttle, pursued hotly by Krill soldiers. In space, the Orville (now aware of the situation), distracts the superior Krill ship by firing on it.

Safe on the shuttle, Finn dresses Mercer's shoulder injury--he was shot while running to the shuttle. Nearly at the Orville, the team is interrupted by a Krill soldier who managed to board the shuttle and hide.

ACT 6

The soldier holds the shuttle at gunpoint with a Plasma Rifle, demanding the device. Mercer decelerates rapidly and the inertia sends the soldier flying into the front of the ship. The shuttle parks in the Orville's Shuttle Bay, and the away team hurries to the Bridge.

Though the Orville was able to distract the Krill destroyer, the spatial coils are badly damaged and the ship is no longer able to match the destroyer in battle. The Krill captain demands the device lest the Orville be destroyed.

Grayson schemes to place a redwood seed inside the quantum accelerator and send the device to the Krill by remote shuttle. Mercer gives the activation code to the Krill captain, which activates the device and causes the seed to grow rapidly into a massive redwood tree, destroying the enemy ship.

In Mercer's office, Grayson announces that she will transfer to another ship. Mercer admits that Grayson is a brilliant officer, whose talents the Orville cannot afford to lose. Problems stemming from the divorce can be overlooked.

Grayson meets Halsey in his office in New York to thank him for her position. It is revealed that she requested that Mercer was promoted to captain of the Orville."

While walking down the street, they approach a news vendor who asks where their badges are and offers to sell them some. As they continue to walk down the street, Lt. LaMarr starts teasing Lt. Kitan about her latest breakup by grinding on a public statue. Unknown to him, several bystanders record the act and upload it for viewing by the entire population.

The team enters a local coffee shop and start to ask Lyselle, who is behind the counter, if she has seen the anthropologists. She is confused by their questions, everyone knows who these two are because they have been corrected. While in the coffee shop, the video of Lt. Lamarr's grinding is seen on the view-screens, and everyone starts to surround them and take videos. As they hurriedly leave the shop, Lt. LaMarr is arrested for his lewd behavior.

While waiting in an administrative office, it is revealed that the justice system is a pure democracy, using up votes and down votes to decide guilt or innocence. Instead of a trial and a lawyer, he is assigned a PR agent and will be required to go on a publicity tour for a week where he has to convince the public he is truly sorry for his transgressions as they vote. If he receives 10,000,000 down-votes, he will be 'corrected'. Lt. Kelly remains with LaMarr to help on the publicity tour, while the rest of the team searches for the missing anthropologist. The first event does not go well, with Lt. LaMarr receiving more down-votes.

The rest of the team go back to the coffee shop and question Lyselle further. She is able to provide them the location where the anthropologists were sent to but sadly reports that one of them was shot trying to escape. After finding the remaining anthropologists, they examine him and learn that correction procedure is very similar to a lobotomy and cannot be reversed.

The team reveals their extra-terrestrial origin to Lyselle and take her back to the Orville. As they question her, they discover she has no concept of any legal procedure recognized by the Union.

As they watch from the Orville, the final publicity event doesn't go well and the down-votes start to skyrocket. It requires some quick thinking by the team and Isaac to flood the stream with comments and manipulated images, stem the tide of down-votes, and save Lt. LaMarr from correction.

At the end, Lysella shows signs of rethinking their justice system."

But after a few minutes the batteries on the Walkman fail, leaving them disappointed. They hear a noise from the attic and Mari thinks it's the spirit of the dead man. Natalie mocks her by saying that maybe it's the dead guy's missing fingers. The girls get more creeped out and Ben tells everyone they should just sleep.

In the morning, Misty goes in to the room where Ben is sleeping. He has an erection. As she reaches for it, Ben wakes up and yells at her. Natalie nudges Jackie to wake up. Jackie complains of menstrual cramps and Natalie says that they're all having them. A reluctant Jackie is sent to get water from the lake. She find Lottie stand immobile in the water. Jackie is concerned for her. Shaunu arrives and asks if Jackie needs help with the water. Jackie notices that Shauna seems more ""chipper"" than the others and Shauna says that she hasn't gotten her period yet. Jackie comments that ""Good thing you're a virgin or we'd really be in trouble.""

Taissa catches Shauna dipping a menstrual rag in some blood from a killed animal. Shauna shows the rag to Jackie saying ""Thanks for jinxing me"", implying that she's gotten her period too. While the other girls work, Jackie sits fiddling with the dead Walkman. Shauna takes Jackie aside to show her how to butcher one of the animals, a task that Jackie finds too gross to engage in. Shauna tells Jackie that she has to find a way to contribute because the other girls are noticing that Jackie isn't doing her share of the work. She gives Jackie a pep talk, saying that Jackie has always been good at inspiring people.

Van and Taissa make out behind the cabin. They hear a scream. Mari comes running out of the cabin. She says that she was standing under the trap door to the attic when she felt something fall on her. The girls can't find anything on her and Taissa mocks Mari's belief in a ghost. Jackie suggests that they hold a seance in the attic in order to get over the fear of the attic. Taissa think's it's a dumb and immature idea and Laura Lee warns against dabbling with the occult, but the other girls agree. Shauna and Jackie begin preparing the attic, putting candles on a set of symbols which have been carved into the floor. Misty gives Ben a drink to help relieve swelling in his leg.

Natalie and Travis hunt for more food. They joke and tease each other. Eventually they kiss. The girls have the seance, greatly enjoying themselves as they ask banal questions about their lives. Taissa and Laure Lee sit downstairs, the only ones who aren't participating. Laura Lee reads the flight manual for the plane they found. Taissa says that Laura Lee is even crazier than the other girls if she's thinking of flying the plane. Suddenly, Lottie screams. She's catatonic, rocking back and forth saying ""It wants"" over and over again. Then she begins speaking in French. Jackie, who was in French class with Lottie but was a poor student, tries to translate, saying that Lottie is saying something about blood. She then goes to the window and bashes her head against it, cutting herself on the glass. Laura Lee begs Ben to make the girls stop but he is sick and vomits. Laura Lee grabs her bible and rushes upstairs, yelling at Lottie ""The power of Christ compels you"". She then throws the bible at her. This does the trick, with Lottie coming out of her trance like state, seemingly oblivious to what has happened.

Ben confronts Misty about why she poisoned him. She admits that she has feelings for him. Ben tells her that he has feelings for her too and that he got angry at her because he's afraid he can't control himself around her. He tells her that because she's underage and also her teacher that he can never cross that line, even if he wants to. He warns her to keep this a secret from the other girls, lest they be jealous. As they prepare for bedtime, Taissa decides to sleep in the attic to prove to the other girls that there's nothing to fear. Shauna decides to go with her. Up in the attic, Taissa reveals that she's figured out that Shauna is pregnant and warns that if they're stuck there much longer, the situation will become obvious to everyone.

In the present:

It's Halloween. Shauna texts with Adam, who invites her out to a club, while her daughter Callie wants to go into the city with her friends. Shauna tells Callie that she has a book club meeting that night. Jeff agrees to hand out candy on his own to allow the women to go out.

Natalie gets a call from Kevyn. He tells her that he got the file on Travis' death and that the toxicilogy report shows Travis was sober when he died. Kevyn tries to invite Natalie out but she cuts him off saying she has another call. Natalie calls Misty and asks her to get her contact to hack into the police files. Misty is at work at the nursing home and scares some kids by faking a medical emergency with a patient.

Taissa discusses with Simone how she's behind Bathurst in the polls. Their dog begins barking at something. Taissa goes out to investigate and finds that someone has written ""Spill"" on their door in red paint. Later, after coming back from trick or treating, Simone suggests that Taissa use the information about Bathurts daughter's drug addiction. Taissa seems reluctant. When she goes into her son's room she finds a jar of red paint under his bed. She and Simone confront their son about why he painted that word on their door. He denies it, saying that ""the lady in the tree"" did it. When Taissa says that there's no lady in the tree, he storms off. Taissa and Simon discuss what's happened. Simone worries that Taissa is being distracted from her family. Taissa decides to call a press conference the next day and announce that she's quitting her campaign.

Misty goes to Natalie's place and gives her a gift of an aroma diffuser. She tells Natalie that her contact, someone she knows from an internet message board, got the files, but now he wants an in person meeting. They meet at a restaurant. The contact says that he got spooked when he discovered that the man he stole from was a cop. He says that he will give them the information if they let him in on the investigation. Natalie spills a cup of gasoline on him and threatens to light him on fire, making him hand over the file.

Shauna and Adam go out to the club. They're dancing and having a good time when Shauna sees Jackie across the crowded club. She chases her down and finds out that it's her daughter Callie, dressed in a Yellowjackets uniform that she found in Shauna's closet. Adam comes up and embraces Shauna. Callie realizes that her mom is cheating on her father. Shauna takes Callie to go somewhere so she can come down off of the drugs she's on.

Natalie and Misty review the file of Travis' suicide. Misty notices something in several pictures of the floor around where Travis body was found. There appear to be remnants of wax, as if candles had been lit. Sketching out the location of the candles, they discover that they are in the shape of the symbol from their time in the wilderness.

Shauna and Callie talk about what's been going on. Callie suggests that Adam is interested in Shauna because of the Yellowjackets. Shauna says that he doesn't know about that, but Callie says that he probably looked her up on the internet. Callie asks when her mom fell out of love with her dad. Shauna says that there's a lot of baggage between them. Shauna asks why she and Jeff never talk about Jackie. Shauna reveals that the Yellowjackets uniform Callie is wearing was Jackie's, not hers. Jackie's parents gave it to her on what would have been Jackie's 40th birthday. Callie reveals that she notices how unhappy her mom is and that it's not okay what happened to her in the wilderness.

Taissa holds a press conference outside her home. As she looks at her prepared remarks, announcing that she will be quitting the campaign, her vision begins to swim. She changes her mind, showing the graffiti on her home and making an angry and impassioned speech announcing that she's staying in the race. She sees a woman, bleeding from her eyes, standing across the street.

The morning after Halloween, Callie tries to blackmail her mom, saying that she will reveal that Shauna is cheating if she doesn't allow Callie more freedom. Shauna explains to Callie what life will be like if her parents divorce, including having to spend time at her father's sad sack bachelor pad. An intimidated Callie confesses to Jeff that she snuck into the city but keeps silent about Shauna's infidelity. Shauna searches on the internet to see what kind of information Adam might have found about her.

Taissa visits Natalie. Natalie shows her the images from the scene of Travis death, telling her how they form the symbol. Taissa asks who might have done that. Just then, they both get a text message from an anonymous source. It tells them to collect $50,000 and await instructions. It includes an ASCII version of the symbol. Taissa calls Shauna to inform her about what's happened and learns that Shauna already heard about it from Misty. Natalie derides Misty as a ""conniving poodle haired freak"". Unbeknownst to them, Misty is watching on a spy camera hidden in the gift she gave Natalie."

Unknown to the public, however, his contribution is merely handling the public relations for the team, while Jim Ferris (Martin Milner) actually writes the books... Jim wants to end the partnership after the current ""Mrs. Melville"" mystery is completed and write on his own, and this has caused a heated argument with Ken, who see's his lavish lifestyle going up in smoke. However, there is still the mutual life insurance policy that the partners have! While Jim is working at their office on a Saturday to finish the last chapter of the final book, Ken visits him to apologize for blowing his stack previously and to ""grant the divorce"" that Jim seeks. He plays an obviously false practical joke with an unloaded revolver and breaks open a bottle of champagne to put Jim at ease. Furthermore, Ken insists that Jim take a break and join him for the day at his new lakefront cabin which Jim has yet to see.

We see the beginning of the murder plot when Ken 'accidentally' leaves his Dunhill cigarette lighter in the office, and he must return to get it while leaving Jim in the car outside. He uses this time to place a list of names of west coast gangsters in a drawer and to then trash the office, so it will look as though gangsters that Jim was allegedly researching for a book have done it and, of course, killed Jim. Nearing the cabin, Ken stops at a local grocery store to pick up some supplies, and also make an (untraceable in 1971) phone call to Jim's wife Joanna (Rosemary Forsyth) to establish that he is 2 hours away from the office... Later we find out that while he was using the pay phone, Lilly La Sanka (Barbara Colby) the nosy widow who owns the store and has obvious designs on Ken Franklin, has checked his car to see which girlfriend he has brought with him this weekend, and spied Jim Ferris sitting in the passenger seat.

Upon reaching the cabin, Jim is uncomfortable about leaving town without telling Joanna, so Ken tells him to call her and tell her that he's working late at the office, as he has done so many times before. Again, this is 1971, and people were still in the habit of using operators to place long-distance calls. Jim does precisely that and Ken has to stop him so that Joanna won't know that Jim is NOT calling from the office. This also establishes the direct-dial call on Ken's phone bill as though it is the call that he made to Joanna, NOT from the pay phone at the market... During the phone call, Ken shoots Jim with the pistol that now has cartridges in it, and then Joanna calls the police and sends them to the duo's office.

As a daring and useful way to dispose of JIm's body, Ken returns to Los Angeles with Jim in the trunk of his car. He later dumps the body on his own lawn at night and calls the police, telling them that this is a message from the 'gangsters' that he had better not follow in Jim's footsteps.

Lilly La Sanka visits Kenwhile he was going out with sexy blonde Gloria (Lynette Mettey), at the door of a luxurious cinema. Lilly pesters Ken about the murder so that he is forced to talk to her. On a dine out at a restaurant, Lilly asks Ken for $15,000. She'll never ask him anything else afterwards, but she wants to put a price to her silence just this once. They have a second date - in her home behind the store - where they drink a lot, dine heartily and he says he'll give her the money, and she insists that she's got class and honour, so he won't hear of her afterwards. After drinking well and much, she starts to realise the ackwardness of the situation. Knowing that he won't have a second chance, he hits her on the head, goes to one of her rental rowboats on the lake, throws her body into the lake and their champagne bottles, overturns the boat and swims to the shore.

Columbo pesters him - he suspects something when he hears that a local shop assistant has died of a freak accident. The final clue is given to Columbo when he finds a scrap of paper on which Jim Ferris has written down an idea for book by Ferris and Franklin - this very same scenario.

When Columbo arrests Ken, the faux writer says that this murder plot really WAS his - the only really good idea he ever had. He had told it to Jim 5 years earlier but, ""who knew that idiot would write it down..."""

Brimmer tells Arthur that his wife is not really being unfaithful. Arthur is much relieved. Brimmer recommends him to pay more attention to her and that's what Arthur intends to do: to buy aplenty luxurious presents for her. Arthur Kennicut, a renown and wealthy LA publisher, leaves contentedly.

Brimmer goes to a room nearby. Thirty-somehting Lenore Kennicut (Patricia ""Pat"" Crowley) is there, on her own, listening to everything. She asks why Brimmer wanted her to listen to what has just happened between him and her husband. Brimmer says to her that he'll keep quiet about Lenore's love affair -of which he has photographic proofs - if she helps him by giving him information concerning some of the business associates and customers of his husband. Brimmer has been secretly blackmailing people, and Lenore can be a good contact in order to find more victims. Lenore doesn't even want to talk to him. She has recently decided to come clean to her husband, so she threatens him with telling her husband of his proposal. There is a row, and hot-tempered Brimmer kills Lenore of a blow on the head. Brimmer is cold-headed as well, and he knows what to do. The audience will see his cold-blooded actions reflected on the surface of his huge glasses. He cleans his office up, takes all her jewellery away from her and gets rid of the corpse, dumping her in an factory-crammed area of the city, intending it all to look like a robbery gone terribly wrong.

After her body is found, two people are on the case: one is shabby-looking and cigar-smoking Lt Frank Columbo (Peter Falk). He is stopped by a traffic police officer (Bill Hickman) because there is a light broken in his car. His driving livence is also about to expire. Despite all this, the traffic officer suggests driving in front of him opening the traffic for him. As usual, when he reaches the place where the crime was found, Columbo gives his grey raincoat wearing and clumsy appearance, so that Arthur Kennicut won't trust his abilities, so he hires private detective Brimmer once again to investigate the case. Brimmer tells Columbo that he wants to help him, not compete agains him.

In spite of Brimmer's devious tactics, Columbo soon finds out that Lenore Kennicut was really having an affair - in spite of Brimmer's denial. He talks to the golf instructor who used to be Lenore's lover. He talks to him, and he first denies it, but afterwards he admits it, although he says that everything was over and that she intended to go on being married to her husband. As usual, Columbo asks Brimmer about the things he doesn't understand. Lenore was hit on her head with a left hand, but frist Brimmer says that he's right-handed, to being forced to admit soon afterwards that he's ambidextrous, which means that he can write both with his right and his left hand. Brimmer starts getting more and more nervous, and he finally decides to offer Columbo a well-paid job, trying to buy him out. As usual, that only is a further proof of Brimmer's guiltiness.

Columbo finally uses a double-ruse to force an admission of guilt from Brimmer... He intimates to Brimmer that one of the victim's contact lenses has fallen out, and it might be in the killer's vehicle. Brimmer has to go to the repair shop (which Columbo and Kennicut are stalking out) in order to search the trunk of his Eldorado for the contact lens, which implicates him totally.

The reason Columbo was able to stage the Cadillac in a garage? He had disabled the car by putting a potato in the tailpipe, as he used to do when he was a rebellious teenager!"

Gen Martin J. Hollister (Eddie Albert) is a war hero. In times of peace, he has dedicated himself to the building industry. He is worried but he thinks he will be able to get out of his financial problems with his prestige intanct. There is a museum exhibition which is going to feature memorabilia from the war he fought on. He's going to donate some of his weapons, military gear, uniforms... to that exhibition. One of his business associates calls on him while he's trying his old uniform. They've charged a lot of money more for the construction of a building that it should have cost. Col. Roger Dutton (John Kerr) is going to run away to Europe before the scandal breaks out and makes it to the healines. Hollister doesn't want to run away, because he's got so many things to lose, and he thought of pinning everything down on Dutton. In the ensuing argument, finally Hollister shoots Dutton.

There is a sharp cut of the camera to the sail of a small fishing boat. Helen Stewart (Suzanne Pleshette) gets really excited. The young divorcée says that she's seen it all. Her mother, Mrs Walters (Kate Reid) hasn't seen anything, but she complies with her daughter and they come back to shore and call the police so that that night, Officer Sánchez (Ron Castro) calls on Hollister.

Enter shabby-looking Lt Frank Columbo (Peter Falk), as usual. He interrogates Hollister. He eventually admits that he had tried on his old uniform, and that he was playing with his gun. However, it doesn't seem like any of the weapons Hollister keeps has been used recently. Hollister gets to know the name of the person who is accusing him, and he learns that he's Helen Stewart. Hollister calls on Helen, and talks to her about what she saw, when, and even takes her on a boat trip to exactly the same place where she was when she saw him shooting his business associate. Helen starts denying what she saw, especially because she feels dazzled by Hollister's charm and attentions.

The main twist of this episode consists on how Helen starts falling in love with Hollister. At first, her mother is a bit nervous about it, but in the end, she also considers Hollister a good possible husband for Helen. The opening day of the exhibition, all media are present, even TV. That gives Columbo his final idea.

But Columbo is a hounddog in search of his prey. He visits the military exhibition, and pretends that, just by chance, he came across with Hollister and Helen. It's Helen who looks more annoyed with Columbo's assistance, and this time, it's her who is rude to the lieutenant. There, he points to the weapon Hollister used in killing Dutton and Hollister finally confesses."

Tracy looks unfit for the job, because she isn't even able to look at the dead body, but she has to stay for an hour with the body getting heated up by the blanket, to delay the apparent time of death. Meanwhile, Dale goes to the opening day of an exhibition by eccentric painter Sam Franklin (Vic Tayback). When he arrives in his flashy car, he makes Joe (Dennis Rucker), the parking boy, look for one of his cufflinks. Later, saying that there is a problem with his watch, asks several people, including Sam Franklin, what time it is, to establish the time of his alibi. At home, Tracy waits for a private security patrol to leave after a check, then fires a shot into the air, runs down the steps to her car, and rives away.

Enter Lt Frank Columbo (Peter Falk). He starts questioning aunt Edna Matthews (Kim Hunter), Frank Simpson's ex-wife, whom he had repeatedly declared to be his only mistake during his own life, as he should have never divorced her. Dale treats Edna kindly, but that's just his plot. First, he takes the two paintings to his own flat. Dale had given his keys to Columbo so that he could check some art book Dale had at his apartment. Columbo has fallen asleep on an armchair when Dale comes back with the paintings, wrapped on a painting portfolio. Dale wakes Columbo up and says to him that he's carrying the work of some new painter inside. Columbo asks to see them, but Kingston doesn't want that. Columbo insists and touches the paintings, but Dale obviously won't let him take a look at them.

Tracy is frustrated by her inability to paint well and creatively. However, Dale encourages her, even though he knows that she has not enough talent. Columbo talks to the landlady (Mary Wickes) with Joe, who spent some time looking for the cufflink around the car in vain. Dale simply found it afterwards.

Some clues lead to the aunt of Dale Kingston, the ex-wife who inherited almost everything. Columbo realises that, if the aunt is accused of the murder, she won't be able to keep the money or the properties as her own, because a person guilty of murder cannot inherit anything from the murdered person.

Dale then gets rid of Tracy by meeting her up in the hills, then bludgeoning her with a rock and dumping her body, passing her death off as a car accident. It turns out he never loved her - in fact, she was just a gullible person who happened to fall in love with him, somebody unsure of her own merits and talent (of which he thought she had none). Columbo has been pestering Dale about his relationship with Tracy, whom he denies any knowledge whatsoever, especially at first.

However, some clues still lead to Dale's aunt, so Captain Wyler (Barney Phillips) and another policeman (Claude Johnson) visit her home. Suddenly, they find the two paintings wrapped in cheap brown wrapping paper. They arrest the aunt.

Columbo doesn't seem satisfied with this solution. Aunt Edna is terribly upset because she looks so guilty, in spite of her innocence. He sits around a table with Dale, his aunt, and Wyler. Columbo tells Wyler to check the paintings for prints. Dale says that it's only natural that there are handprints on the prints, as he must have touched them at his uncle's mansion. Columbo says that he himself had touched the paintings at Dale's apartment, in that portfolio he was trying to hide so eagerly, so if the paintings have his (Columbo's) prints, they are the ones which he touched at Dale's apartment. Dale says that everything is a conspiration, that Columbo must have touched the paintings at Edna's apartment. Columbo shows his hands: both are inside gloves.

Dale is trapped, and his aunt is cleared when Columbo's prints appear.

She remembers how her brother, called Bryce (Richard Anderson) insisted in that she will break up with her boyfriend Peter Hamilton (Leslie Nielsen), because he disaproves of it. He threatens to fire him if he persists in going out with her. She's had enough: first it was her father who would control her, but now it's her brother. Beth has got a gun. She awaits for Bryce, in the hopes of shooting at him and making believe she thought he was a burglar. She takes her sleeping pills as usual, and knows that the butler and maids will be on their free day.

Bryce can't unlock the front door with his keys. He taps on the window of Beth's bedroom. She's half-dizzy because of the pills. She tells him to come in through the window, as she has disconnected the alarm. When Bryce comes in through the window, the alarm bell starts off, and Beth shoots Bryce. Seh breaks one of the window panels to jutify the alarm bell. She takes off Bryce's fake keys and puts in the real ones, then wakes up the entire home but nobody is there. She knows perfectly well that it's Charles (Joel Fluellen)'s day off. Beth reviews everything on her mind.

When the time arrives, Peter is near the home. Beth's plans look like a success. He runs to the home when he hears all the rackas. Beth has to improvise when Peter ring the bell on the front door. While Peter is checking on Bryce, Beth throws Peter's keys among the plant pots. When Peter finally pronounces Bryce dead, Beth seems to be genuinely terrified about what has happened.

Enter Lt Frank Columbo (Peter Falk). He starts prying around, as usual. Two detectives help him (Richard Bull & Garry Walberg).

Mrs Chadwick (Jessie Royce Landis) arrives with her annoying dog. She bosses Columbo around. Mrs Chadwick slaps Beth, but she says that it was all an accident. Columbo says that he comes from a big family, while Mrs Chadwick says that Bryce used to protect Beth. Mrs Chadwich says that she doesn't want anybody from outside the family to take charge of the advertising agency and other businesses of the family, which her late husband and later Bryce had taken care of. Now Beth wants to take the lead, arguing she has never given the opportunity to take responsibilities before.

Columbo wonders about the newspaper. Why didn't Beth take Bryce's newspaper and attaché case at the same time. Mrs Chadwich says it must have been due to Beth's confusion at the time.

Some time afterwards, the jury gives the verdict: it was an accident, so Beth can go free. Beth tells Peter that she has some appointments: she wants to re-organize the company. Columbo is present at the court, and he talks to Beth's lawyer. Columbo takes him to a drive-in fast food restaurant. The Waitress (Susan Barrister) tells him not to leave with the tray attached to the driver's car window. Peter asks Columbo whether he believes in a conspiracy. Columbo knows that Peter didn't have anything to do with it. Peter insists that he loves her with or without money. Columbo plants on Peter's brain the idea of Beth being free for the first time on her life... and leaves with the tray.

Columbo interrogates Charles and the maid (Barbara Rhoades) about Beth's new fancy car. Columbo talks to Beth on her beauty parlour. Columbo wonders about Beth ordering the car before the ""accident"". Columbo sets an appointment with Beth. He goes with her and asks for a ladder to be brought. He also wonders about the lack of grass remains on the soles of Bryce. He also wondered about the spare key kept hidden by a flower pot. But Beth says she got second thoughts about that. Columbo is dismissed by Beth, who says that the verdict has proclaimed her innocence.

Beth goes shopping. Her attire is less demure. Peter watches the shopping spree in amazement. He goes back to the office, wondering whether she really likes this new Elizabeth. She is also speaking on the main meeting board, taking charge of the presidency and promoting Peter Hamilton. Not even Mrs Chadwick dares to speak out. Beth wants the company to take new clients. One of them, Fred (Frank Baxter), insists that the company has all the clients it can handle, but Beth threatens to dismiss him, so Fred will have to accept the changes. Beth also anounces her engagement to Peter Hamilton quite bluntly. Beth threatens her mother to sue her if she doesn't allow her to take control of the company. Peter hears all this.

Columbo appears and Mrs Chadwick leaves. Peter wants to leave, but Beth tells him to stay. Columbo asks about the lack of dust on the lightbulbs. Beth says that the service must have cleaned it, and insists that she won't answer more questions. Beth gets so frantic that she breaks a vase. Peter tells her to calm down. Beth doesn't want to argue with him. Peter is annoyed because he didn't know anything about his own promotion or his engagement. He wonders if he really knows her. Beth, on her part, also starts thinking that Beth is a completely different person now.

Hamilton sees Columbo on the bar. He says he doesn't feel really engaged. Columbo says that he believes that Beth killed her brother on purpose. Hamilton defends her: he was there, after all. Columbo mentions one of the saying of his wife: to put the cart before the horse.

Somebody fumbles at Beth's bedroom window lock. She picks up her gun and first tries to phone the operator, but then she goes to watch who it was, thinking it was annoying Columbo. Columbo says that the clue was given to him by Peter Hamilton himself. He had heard the two shots, and then the alarm bell. That's why Columbo is going to arrest Beth: Hamilton won't like it, but he will testify agains her. Beth thinks of shooting Columbo, but he knows it's not her style. He tells Beth to take off her nightgown and dress up.

Robin'],[''],[],"['police', 'police team', 'pilot episode']",[],"Robbery/Homicide is answering the call to the home because there is a deceased woman lying face down, naked, on the bedroom floor, with her hair shorn. Ellen Parks, sits with her coat on, telling Detective Flynn her boss is on vacation in Hawaii, staying a few extra days. Her boss is Dr. Elliot Collier, a computer scientist, and Ellen was his secretary. Detective Waters comes to get Flynn to review the body. Flynn asks if there was any identification on the body and Waters tells him two driver's licenses, two passports, all fake, with the pictures cut out. The maid called police when she returned to work and found the body in the bedroom. She sits talking to a policeman. Four or five blows to the back of the head is what killed her, even though she was shot in the face, all according to Dr. Tanaka, where he says the naked body lie for twelve days.

Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson is introduced by Det. Sgt. Gabriel to the doctor, acknowledging again both Detectives, Flynn and Waters. She excuses herself to Det. Lt. Flynn, she bending down to examine the victim. Tanaka comments, I'm just here to declare the victim dead and write it up as a homicide, something a Coroner's attendant usually does, but some ass-hole at Parker Center insisted on a doctor. Brenda acknowledges the ass hole to be her. Brenda notices vomit on the victim, sniffing the stains on the floor, where someone tried to clean up. She asks the doctor to expedite the autopsy, stating she will follow him to the morgue when he is ready to leave. The bullet in the victim needs to be hand delivered to Firearms Analysis for a quick turnaround.

Flynn is irate Brenda is taking the case over, loudly expressing his opinion. Chief Johnson explains to Flynn there has been a change of plans, Priority Homicide has been assigned the case. She also insists a warrant will be needed to search the garage and car, since it is detached from the house. She asks Ellen if Dr. Collier gave her permission to allow strangers into the garage and car; Ellen shakes her head no. She orders everyone out of the car and garage. Det. Waters disagrees with her, calling her a bitch. She retorts, excuse me, Lieutenant, if I'd like being called a bitch to my face, I'd still be married.

At HQ, Captain Taylor of Robbery/Homicide, takes issue with the manner she treated his officers at the crime scene. Deputy Chief Pope tells Captain Taylor, we tried running the department your way, and we had a twenty-year veteran indicted for lying under oath and the murderer being interviewed by Larry King. Bottom line, it did not work, therefore, they brought in Brenda, the closer. Pope continues with Collier developed an anti-piracy computer program CEO Dr. Brown values at over a half-trillion dollars. Dr. Harlan Brown is Collier's boss, fourth richest man in America. The department needed more specialization, Pope declares to Taylor. It is no reflection on anyone's ability to do their job. Pope further adds, Brenda's qualifications include her CIA employment. Before a jealous and disgruntled Taylor left Pope's office, he handed him a folder with some snide remark.

The house is rented by Dr. Elliot Collier, who is missing, Sgt. Gabriel says Dr. Collier deleted his entire employment record; Brenda stipulates we have no picture and no fingerprints. Gabriel says Collier had himself listed as a Christian Scientist employee, thus no medical record on file. Brenda states this disappearance was likely premeditated, but the murder was not. Brenda, in the car with Gabriel, states the victim's prints are everywhere in the house, in his office, in his car, but Collier's prints are nowhere to be found. At HQ, Detective Tao explains he was doing some background on Dr. Collier, and he talked to his mother. Tao informs Brenda with a certificate, Elliot Collier died when he was nineteen, according to Social Security records. Brenda then asks, who is this guy?

Pope shares with Brenda those folder contents which are requests for immediate transfers back to Robbery/Homicide from every single member of her squad. Brenda's response is they'll have a whole list of other reasons to hate my guts. Gabriel has been showing the autopsy in the murder room at the same time Brenda listens to Pope, taking the Taylor-folder from Pope. Twelve years ago, the woman had breast reduction surgery, work on her jaw line and likely a nose job as well. Brenda adds to Gabriel's information, which means she was serious about changing her appearance. She discards each transfer request in a wastebasket as her orders are directed to each of the officers with a final comment, all we have now is a woman we cannot identify murdered by a man who does not exist.

In Brenda's office are Collier's boss and the company attorney. CEO Dr. Brown tells Brenda, Elliot Collier is a genius, continuing to prattle on about Collier, trying to compare his idiosyncrasies with Steve Jobs of Apple Inc. Brenda inquires how much will your company be worth if we can't find him? Attorney Banks says he will not be intimidated by Brenda's accusations. Brenda says the man who created his identity was stolen from a teenager who died in 1989. Banks objects to searching Elliot Collier's office records and computers. Brenda comes back with how a company whose entire reason for existing is to make things secure, cannot locate or correctly identify their most valuable employee. What would that do to the value of your stock? Brenda gets a signature from Dr. Brown for permission to search the records after threatening a press conference.

Provenza is downstairs near the Firearms Analysis entrance arguing with Taylor to get the bullet from the victim identified. Taylor refuses to allow Brenda's team to go to the front of the line. Pope intervenes by continuing the shouting match with Taylor. Finally, Taylor begrudgingly relents to Pope in a face to face confrontation. Pope wins, entering the lab with the bullet taken from the victim's head.

Collier transferred all his money into accounts of his victim's aliases, according to Det. Garth, furthermore, Collier rented his house and car. Brenda asks why would he transfer money to her if he planned on disappearing. Tao speaks, he didn't get rid of everything. Tao says there is one identity he missed, no one entered his office secured area without an iris scan. Tao shows Brenda security pictures of Collier's scanned eye, and adds in the land of no evidence, the left eye is king. Tao also shares mash notes, in e-mail, from Collier to his Secretary Ellen. Brenda requests Tao run a check on our Miss Ellen Parks, with a little cross around her neck. Gabriel asks Brenda what if Ellen found out Collier was living with another woman, and Brenda responds, killed him in a jealous rage. Gabriel speculates what if he was taking off with this woman and Ellen killed them both. Provenza pokes his head in her office asking what she wanted. Brenda says what about the bullet and Provenza answers didn't college boy tell you.

Brenda confronts Pope in the parking garage as he is going to his car and she is noticeably mad at not getting cooperation, accusing him of playing with her livelihood. She screams, I want that report and that bullet back. He promises to get the results from firearms analysis asap.

Brenda invites Sanchez to sit in on the interview with Ellen since he has been with her since her arrival; she sends a disgruntled Gabriel home to rest while Daniels listens from the hallway and others listen from the control room. Brenda's initial interview with Ellen has her admitting Collier would give me the keys when he would go on vacation, but the relationship was not romantic. Ellen says she has never dated anyone, ever. Brenda asks Ellen, did you know Dr. Collier was living with the victim? Did he ever mention that? You never met her or saw her? Dr. Collier had a relationship of some kind; we found her fingerprints all over the house and at work. Ellen responds with that is really surprising, because there are very strict rules about that. Brenda adds, it very surprising when someone we really care about does something like this. I know Dr. Collier was your friend. If Dr. Collier gets in touch with you again, you must let us know. Brenda concludes the interview.

Fritz meets Brenda in the hotel bar, renewing their friendship. Brenda has her Merlot and Fritz has his water. He offers her an FBI report on the mystery woman, saying you were right, the victim's got a record, in fact, she is wanted for murder. Brenda looks with surprise at the paperwork.

At HQ, Brenda reviews the contents of the FBI packet with the detective team. The victim's name was Alana Devin, she would have turned forty next month. In 1991, she shot a security guard outside a pharmaceutical company during an ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) protest. Alana Devin was a lesbian. Like Collier, she was a computer scientist and she changed her identity. The gun that fired the bullet into her face is the same gun used in the original crime, as Brenda holds up the evidence bag containing the bullet. Detective Garth informs Brenda the day Collier leaves, Ellen closed her checking account, the day he went missing, she reopens it. Brenda says she needs to take another look at Alana's body. Gabriel takes a call, telling Brenda the morgue released the body. Taylor explains the moment the victim identification is out, the coroner certifies the body, and it is released by law to the family, common procedure for releasing bodies from the morgue, which Brenda wants back to conclude her case. She tells Taylor you have no right to share the victim's identification. The family has been waiting fifteen years for Alana to come home, they can wait three more days. Taylor asks why the body is important to conclude the case. She tells Taylor she doesn't report to him so your question is irrelevant. Pope quiets the heated conversation between Taylor and Brenda. You will have the body back tomorrow morning.

Brenda and Gabriel leave Pope's office while Pope tells Taylor to sit down, we need to talk. Gabriel confides in Brenda, he was the one giving Taylor the ID to release the body. She acknowledges because he is your friend. Gabriel asks her, have you been able to figure out how Dr. Collier was able to get rid of his fingerprints everywhere? Brenda replies with a yes. Gabriel continues with that bit about bringing the body back, was that true or are you bluffing? Brenda answers, I never bluff, I just express my optimism forcefully. You had Ellen Parks picked up and held overnight. We don't have the gun, and no witnesses. Ellen will be very helpful with that, I promise. Is this more of your forceful optimism? Brenda comes back quickly with oh no, it's my experience. Because as any good interrogator will tell you, as hard as a secret is to uncover, it is even harder to keep. Goodnight Sergeant. Goodnight Ma'am.

Pope is questioning Brenda's actions and intent by keeping the suspect Ellen Parks held overnight and not seeing her all day. Pope insists if Brenda does not get what she needs from Ellen, then she's going to get a lawyer, and we are screwed. Brenda response is I know a little something about admiring the boss and finding out he is not the guy you thought he was. Pope leaves her office.

Brenda goes into her final interview with Ellen dressed very conservatively. She is immediately met with a confrontation telling Ellen to sit down, telling her she lied about her relationship with her boss. Brenda shows Ellen the email correspondence between Collier and her. Ellen agrees with Brenda that she was emotionally intimate with Collier, but not physical. Brenda consoles then confides in Ellen, she loved Dr. Collier and he loved her, and were you aware he changed his name from Alana Devin. Did he tell you he was living under a false identity and he had shot a security guard? Ellen answers yes to all of the questions. You kept that information from the police, why? He showed you the gun? The shooting was an accident, he didn't mean to shoot anybody. Yes, he showed me the gun.

Brenda discloses Alana was Dr. Collier. Brenda shows Ellen the pictures of Alana before and after the surgeries. The iris scan of Alana's left eye matched the scan of Dr. Collier's left eye; a confirmation they were the same person. Let's go back to the night you were leaving. That is when you met Alana Devon, right? These things have to said. She had plastic surgery that changed her jaw line and her nose and reduced her breasts. She proceeded to live her life in permanent disguise. Brenda shows Ellen the pictures of Alana before and after the surgeries. She always turtlenecks because she had no Adam's Apple. She also claimed to be a Christian Scientist, so she would not have to take the company physical. That's why we only found Alana's fingerprints at Dr. Collier's house, and in his office and in his car, not because Alana was living with Dr. Collier, but because she was Dr. Collier. Do you know how I can prove this Ellen? The shot that was fired into Alana's face missed her left eye, and when I took her body back to the morgue, I found the iris scan of the left eye matched exactly the iris scan of Elliot Collier's left eye. The man you were having an affair wasn't a man at all, he was a woman. That night you were leaving, he told you the truth, he showed you who he was. I have it right don't I Ellen, or are you a lesbian?

Ellen slams her hand on the table declaring I am not a lesbian, while she points her forefinger to the ceiling, to emphasize her sexual preference to Brenda. Ellen is offended by Brenda's remark about being a lesbian, stating how could you say that? Brenda comes back with the statement, but you didn't mean to kill him, did you? Hadn't planned on that, but just for the record, just so it is clear, could you please say that out loud. Ellen states, I didn't mean to kill him. I was kissing him and she pulled my hand down against her and I picked the paperweight up off the desk and I hit him over the head with it. I just beat her head in.

Sgt. Gabriel tells Brenda, while she is packing to leave for the night, you know you were right from the beginning, looks like love."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542955/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"Amidst meddling by Captain Taylor (who plants one of his staff on her team), Brenda looks into the murder of a movie star's wife.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Michael M. Robin'],[''],[],"['cheating husband', 'police team']",[],"A beautiful woman is found dead in her shower with no immediate sign of how she died. Initially it appears to be an accident at home, but Brenda has her suspicions when none of her hired help is present and the razor, she obviously used to shave her legs is missing. Could a missing razor lead to her killer? Brenda continues her investigation with weak cooperation among her team of detectives. Only Det. Sgt. Gabriel is with her as she looks for the killer among suspects including her philandering husband.

On the scene Gabriel states the conditioner she applied has to be on her twenty minutes and during that time Brenda says she shaves her legs. Brenda looks for the missing razor, and it is important if they cannot find it. Lindsey says Heather has not worked in two years, she was not in a hurry contradicting Jennifer's story.

At the morgue Brenda questions if the conditioner could have shut down her central nervous system. The coroner will look at her brain to determine if that was true. She tells Agent Howard she will send a picture of her scalp to determine the possible cause of death once the coroner is through.

Brenda is late for the Dean Kingsley interview. She arrives with Sanchez asking questions of Dean while his agent sits with him. Soon his attorney arrives saying no further questions leaving with her client and agent. Brenda goes to Pope complaining about the mishap and the quality of officers given to her by Captain Taylor. Taylor's additional officer is to be Flynn

Lindsey is filling in Brenda with Heather's calendar. Brenda is updating the murder board with the data. Lindsey had an affair with Dean in the past. It's not like she was Dean's last girlfriend, the sailboat is more like a ferry. Heather would take everything Dean had if she were to find out about the affairs.

If you can't interview the suspect you find what you can about the victim was Brenda's response to Gabriel asking what if Dean will not talk to us. Brenda eyeballs Heather's appointment book wondering who Heather was getting all gussied up to see. Rather than invite these people down to HQ, at no expectation of privacy, we should see the people at their workplace, keeping them in their comfort zone.

First visit is Jennifer, Heather's hairdresser, saying she had a 11:30 lunch appointment, and normally she performed her hair appointment in the shop, but Heather insisted she meet her that morning, be here by eight were Heather's exact words according to Jennifer. Second stop, Janine, Heather's Personal Shopper, black and red dress for Brenda. Janine's husband left her because of Dean, win some and lose some, she tells Brenda. Third, Isabelle, makeup artist for Heather, added eyelashes to Brenda, gave the restaurant name location for her 11:30 appointment; get a divorce first, he made a play for me in front of his wife. Fourth, Allison Metcalfe, I am Dean's alibi, Brenda responds, oh no Miss Metcalfe, you're his motive.

Brenda sits with Fritz at dinner explaining she got to know the manager this afternoon which is how she could get the reservation for the restaurant they are in. Fritz provides the details from the toxicology report on the nicotine conditioner, under exact conditions, it could be only fifteen minutes for it to penetrate and be toxic.

Brenda requests from Lt. Tao evidence to prove the nicotine conditioner and the victim hair follicles match. Brenda interviews Donnie Holt, owner of the boat slip two over from Dean Kingsley, who recognizes the picture Brenda provides as the new girlfriend, sailing off with her that night. The picture was Allison Metcalfe. The liquid nicotine found at the Kingsley house did not match up with the strands of hair from the victim. The Kingsley prenuptial agreement does not exist, Dean did not have one at all. The victim's cause of death was from a nicotine solution absorbed solely through the scalp. Brenda says his alibi is solid, the revised autopsy report confirms her suspicions and the prenup was non-existent.

Dean lied when he said he was alone on the boat and he conspired with Allison Metcalfe when she decided to pass that lie on to the police. Conspiracy equals obstruction of justice. Flynn goes to Taylor who goes to Pope who prevent Dean's arrest.

Brenda confronts Flynn the next morning stating no one thought to inform her of that decision, looking about into the squad room faces. Well then, I'll just go arrest him myself, as she leaves without any cooperation from her officer staff. Gabriel chases her down. Can you be certain you can drive Dean Kingsley back to Parker Center without getting lost? Brenda holds out her keys to Gabriel, gesturing you drive.

Dean's attorney says my client doesn't have to talk to you. Brenda responds, but he does have to listen. Taylor and others watch the interview. Brenda tells Dean he is responsible for his wife's death. Telling all these women the lies with a non-existent prenup. Being out on your boat when your wife is murdered is too much even for Hollywood standards. Did you ever think that one of these women might take you seriously? I would like you to make a list of all these women you have played this game with over the last three years, handing Dean a pen and paper. And I would like you to sign this custody agreement, because I am going to need it to make my case, showing the agreement to his attorney, before she put it in front of him to sign first.

Brenda returns to the hair salon on the premise she can't seem to get her hair the way it was before. Jennifer hears about the latest girlfriend, a restaurant manager from Beverly Hills, and Dean with a good alibi, on his sailboat with that manager. Brenda says the hairdo you gave me was the same as the one you gave the woman who played opposite him in his last movie. I looked it up on the crew list, that is how you knew him. Tell me Jennifer, did he ever take you sailing? Donnie Holt greets her, remember me? Brenda distinguishes among the dates Dean had, determining Jennifer was a few back since the latest girlfriend, verified by Donnie. . You washed Heather's hair and conditioned it just you always do, but you wore gloves because you didn't want to get any of the nicotine on your hands, and after you massaged it in, she went into the shower to shave her legs, and you waited until she died. And then you went into clean up a little, you took the razor by mistake, to be neat, and on the way home, you got rid of the poison, the gloves and the razor along with anything else. Gabriel hands Jennifer the agreement where Dean Kingsley signed away his parental rights, provided you tell us where you dumped the cleanup materials. Jennifer complies with the request, giving the location of the stuff she tossed. Brenda told her if she got an attorney, she would tear up the agreement, and Dean and the new girlfriend would sail off with her new baby. Jennifer signs the agreement, acknowledging her criminal act."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542965/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,"Brenda's investigation into the murder of a teenage prostitute puts her in the FBI's headlights, and in a possible conflict with Fritz.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Elodie Keene'],"['', '']",[],"['teenager murdered', 'police team']",[],"Brenda is looking for a corpse among the bags in the morgue storage, i.e. toe tag #2005-3290, a teen prostitute, murdered by stabbing, but with Gabriel's assistance, they find the body of the young victim, from the racks. The body has been there three days already, no name. Gabriel asks what makes a hooker so important and Brenda answers the client list is the factor moving it to Priority Homicide, which is why Brenda is searching for the body, not waiting for a morgue attendant. She makes a positive identification from the file and the face of the dead victim.

Captain Taylor argues with Brenda over the handling of the prostitute murder case and conversations center around the client list of notables. The teen prostitute was murdered, stabbed multiple times, and judging from the stab wounds, the M.E. identifies the killer as at least six feet tall because the victim is just shy of six feet; pictures of the dead girl indicate her assailant was ruthless, showed no mercy with multiple wounds. The stab wounds were caused by a six-inch serrated blade. Time of death estimated to be between eight PM and midnight. Brenda has her detective-staff look for leads, including suspect backgrounds, one of which is a friend of Pope's, named Danny Booth, and his fiancé. Brenda tells her officers the killer was likely a regular customer since there was no sign of a break-in, robbery or struggle. Gabriel reviews the killing with slides from the victim's web page, named Strawberry Lollipop, which is the only name known so far for the victim. The web-page calendar depicts March with a reduced list of clients, around twenty-five, presumably limited to her regulars. Brenda requests Lt. Provenza talk to any of her customers, should they happen to come in. Pope catches Brenda before she leaves, stating no feathers ruffled unless you think the suspects are guilty. The matter of interviewing Pope's friend Danny Booth, a regular-client, is mentioned with orders to have the interview at eight AM in Pope's office and off the books.

Brenda looks over the recent victim's house with Det. Daniels while Provenza interviews six-foot-suspects, including a judge, who was at dinner the night of the murder. A congressman client offered a tip to Provenza while being interviewed of possible contractors, since the victim was having her kitchen remodeled. Brenda eyes the blood-stained mattress, hears and sees the victim's cat. Daniels admires the granite countertops, stainless appliances and custom cabinets. Brenda pulls the local take-out menu from the refrigerator, calls the number for a to go order asking if her card or boyfriend's card is on file; it was the boyfriend.

The boyfriend-pimp Nik is called in for questioning, his rap sheet consists of an A&B charge he got dropped; he is the illegitimate son of the head of the Russian mob, Ivan Kozlov, known for heroin trafficking. Captain Taylor is the resident expert on the Russians, according to Flynn. Brenda declines hearing from Taylor, for now. Nik is not involved in the drug business and he waived his right to counsel, but he did say he was thirsty; Brenda brings him something to drink. Zoya Petrovna was the girl's name according to Nik, telling Brenda he was in the Federal Building for several hours while the murder was taking place. Nik is unaffected by the girl's death, showing no sympathy or remorse. Agent Fritz Howard stops at Brenda's hotel room to take her to dinner and confirms the whereabouts of Nik Kozlov in the FBI building for the evening into the morning, because he was told the same.

The next morning, Brenda talks to Danny Booth about a name he does not recognize of the woman he was spending two-thousand per week; Brenda comments that's is quite a lot on a Federal salary. That's enough, Mr. Booth, we'll meet again on more formal circumstances. That's all the questions for now, as she exits, followed by Pope, excusing his friend. Brenda says he is not innocent, and he works for Immigration & Customs Enforcement. The girl was eighteen, practically a child, and her name was Zoya Petrovna. Pope asks about Nik's alibi and Brenda says it was confirmed by the FBI. Flynn gives Brenda Zoya's phone records, showing conversations with Nik Kozlov and Nadia Orwell. Brenda orders background information on Booth's fiancé and Nadia Orwell from Provenza and Sanchez. Franny, from Taylor's office, provides Gabriel with data of a similar victim from six months ago.

Brenda sits in her car trying to eyeball Nadia, within time she comes toward her pushing a baby in a cart. Brenda visits with a reluctant Nadia to learn the connection among the mob, Booth and Zoya. Once she sees Zoya's murder picture, she becomes talkative, willing to give Brenda information. Nadia identifies Booth from a picture, saying all immigrant girls have to date him. She called him a sick pig as soon as she saw his picture. Immediately after getting off the plane, they meet Booth, who stamps their passports. Nadia Orwell was a former Russian prostitute who informs Brenda how corrupt the system is with the men running the outfit, starting with the immigration agent Booth. If Nadia gave the names of three aliens, she would be released from her obligations. Nadia got married and is free from the ring. She tells Brenda about Zoya wanting to stay in the U.S., get married with baby. Nik rejected that notion. Nikolai Kozlov, a pimp for the mob, related as a step-son of the head man. Nadia cries believing she betrayed Zoya in allowing her to come here, and Zoya not being able to return because Nik held her visa.

Gabriel shows Brenda a file of another stabbing victim, another Russian prostitute from months ago; there is no M.E. report with the file. The FBI visits the murder room demanding files be turned over now on Zoya. Brenda has to comply, except for the woman Gabriel found from the data search. Brenda tells Gabriel she finds it interesting that suddenly an eighteen-year-old Russian hooker becomes vital to our national security apparatus. Why the FBI suddenly wanted all the info on Zoya leaves Brenda curious, but they asked for Zoya, they got info on Zoya. They didn't ask for the woman Gabriel found with Franny's help, which Brenda opens the file, showing her morgue picture. Brenda and Gabriel visit a cemetery with unmarked graves looking for the match of the victim Gabriel found. She is identified as Vonya, the body is exhumed, as Brenda talks to the priest associated with the cemetery. He recognizes Booth's picture Brenda shows him. Brenda learns from the priest the exhumed woman was pregnant.

Brenda interviews Booth in an interview room, stating how he sleeps with every girl coming in from Russia, stamping their passports, taking money from the mob for each girl and with whom you have your choice to sleep with coming into this country. Booth says he might need an attorney, but Brenda says he doesn't need a lawyer, otherwise she will talk to his fiancé about what he has been doing with these girls. Brenda orders Booth to call the FBI, make an appointment to talk, telling them what you do for the Kozlov's. Brenda goes in place of Booth, directly to the same agents' office that took files from the LAPD. Brenda learns the FBI agents are holding information from her because of their investigation of the racketeering within the organization. Brenda explains to the FBI agents, Nik Kozlov was to be the father of a baby from another prostitute before she was murdered in the same fashion as Zoya. Brenda realizes then, the FBI is covering for Nik, because she asks if they might know where Nik was when Vonya was murdered. She purposely mixes dates of the murder, and the FBI response is the same, they have an excuse for Nik both times.

She is in the FBI parking lot ordering Gabriel to get Nik and his father in for questioning, when she meets Agent Howard. Brenda questions Fritz if he was lying before and he responds, I told you what they told me. Fritz acknowledges the giant RICO investigation going on, she balks at his excuse, saying Nik was never in custody, they wanted him to testify against his father, so they flipped him. Letting people kill teenage girls because they have connections to the mob is just wrong, Brenda walks away form Fritz in the Federal parking lot, he admitting what is going on here is morally reprehensible. I hope you're not mad at me in the morning, as she drives back to her office. Brenda tells Pope, I had Nik Kozlov ordered in here, arresting him for murder. Taylor says Andy Osterman is with Nik, one of the top mob attorneys, you won't get in a word. Brenda asks Taylor for any information he can provide on Nik's relations with his family. Taylor updates Brenda on Nik in front of Pope just before she goes into a meeting with him and his attorney. Taylor states, Nik is the son of his father's second mistress, an American girl, a pro, who went missing when Nik was four. Nik is not very high up the ladder in the organization, his legitimate brothers handle the heroin business; Nik just manages the ladies; Nik is the family pimp.

Brenda introduces herself to Nik's attorney, stating Nik and her are old friends, having met, talked beforehand, with Nik declining the presence of an attorney. Andy turns to Nik, asking if he was stupid. Nik claims he didn't do it, that is why the decline for counsel. Brenda shows him a picture of Vonya, killed by stabbing, same knife used to kill Zoya. Gabriel tells Andy, DNA tests prove she was the mother of Nik's unborn child. Brenda agrees it happens, claiming that is how Nik entered the world. Brenda also looks Nik in the eyes, explaining when his father passes, he will be shut out of the family business altogether, for being illegitimate; his step-brothers will inherit the business, as they are legitimate heirs. Tell me Nik, did what happened to your mom when you were a little boy, did that make you think whores were disposable? Nik lunges at Brenda. Andy Osterman holds him back in his seat. Since Nik won't tell me where he really was during the time of Vanya and Zoya's murders, perhaps Mr. Osterman you could tell me where you were? You are Nik's criminal attorney, right, for his whole family. So, were you with him last Friday when he was being questioned by the FBI, from seven PM until five in the morning? I can't imagine the FBI would question someone for ten hours without his attorney present or that Nik wouldn't have called for you under those circumstances. The FBI gives your client an alibi for these murders. Brenda to Osterman, can you help me with that? Andy says no, I don't think so, no. Brenda says well, I tried. You are free to go Nik, thank you. Osterman turns to Nik, come on Nik, it is time to go home. Brenda gets up, opens the door, turns to Nik, that's it, Nik, there's nothing more to do. Nik again lunges at Brenda, saying he wants to confess, I killed them. The officers move quickly to rescue Brenda from Nik's grasp, with his pleas of guilt, not wanting to go with his attorney. Brenda says I would like to help you Nik, but I just don't know who to believe, you or the FBI.

Brenda walks out of the interview room, down the corridor, Pope stops her asking, what did you just do? Brenda pulls both pictures of the slain girls from her purse, holding them up for Pope to see. Pope eyes the photos, turns, and walks away, while Brenda clutches the pictures, looking forlorn.

At her new home, Brenda answers the door. Fritz comes in, complementing her about the house, telling her Nik Kozlov was found murdered last night, had his throat slit. Brenda responds, so, the world is short another budding serial killer. Fritz says the Kozlov empire remains standing. Brenda says I have someone to replace Nik, meet Danny Booth, she holds a file up, and his fiancé. It was not my job to protect Nik Kozlov, it was my job to seek justice for those two teenage girls. Fritz takes Booth's file home with him while Brenda hears and sees the cat come into the living room. She is mad the animal was not removed prior to her moving in to Zoya's old place."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542959/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,Brenda's investigation into the murder of a psychiatrist and the drug trial he was conducting is disrupted when Pope leaks confidential information that Flynn uses against her.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Craig Zisk'],"['', '']",[],"['police team', 'drug trial', 'ex boyfriend ex girlfriend friendship']",[],"A psychiatrist is found murdered in his office, no sign of any items stolen, personal or otherwise. His records are plainly displayed about his desk, including his appointment calendar and some patient files. Gabriel updates Brenda, we've got no signs of a break-in, no theft, he's still got his wallet on him. Brenda observes the victim's mouth, I have the feeling Dr. Rainey spent his last few seconds gasping for air. Yeah, red dots on the eyes, petechial hemorrhaging. Gabriel concludes, he was suffocated. Det. Daniels imparts the victim's wife would like to see the body, Brenda asks to see her somewhere in another room. Brenda orders Det. Sanchez to put down the files he has in his arms and also orders Lt. Provenza to do the same with the doctor's appointment book; they are both considered privileged information, and cannot be removed from the premises. Brenda directs Provenza to collect the couch cushions, have SID pack them up and take to forensics, please.

Leah Rainey laments she warned her husband, explaining to Chief Johnson the study her husband was conducting is a clinical trial, an antidepressant designed to treat drug addiction in teenagers. She was concerned this could happen. I'm a psychiatrist also working with juvenile offenders, we wanted to do something to save these children.

The murder room discussion is led by Lt. Tao, over 2,000 addicted teens are in the program. Provenza quips, so, we have a few suspects. Flynn stabs the conversation with so it seems not to be working. Tao adds details, maybe because only half the kids got the medication, one-half were given a placebo. Flynn asks, and we can't go through the doctor's files, Chief? Brenda reacts, no, not an option. How is the clinical trial going? Det. Daniels interjects some news of a family suffering a loss through their son Cody as a result of the medication. Flynn insists the special master obtained through a judge he knows will allow the patient files accessible. Brenda dismisses his idea. Flynn is disturbed with the fact Brenda does not want to pursue the special master, and he takes his problem to Pope. Pope explains to Flynn the manner in which Chief Johnson is approached yields a better chance to get results. Pope tells Flynn there was an incident in Atlanta where she was brought up on charges of ethics violations and therefore has been going by the book ever since. Pope discloses the ethics charge was dismissed but is a matter of record. He asks Flynn to start the special master paperwork and he will speak with Chief Johnson. Pope requests Flynn not to mention anything about the ethics inquiry, it stays just between us.

Brenda talks to Dr. Jerome in his office to get up to speed about how the program is progressing. Dr. Jerome gives his explanation of the trial's progress, for instance, if the drug was abruptly withdrawn, it would produce health risks, such as convulsions, coma and death. After Cody Hammond died, Dr. Jerome suggested to Dr. Rainey the trial should be shut down, but the drug company would not even consider it. Dr. Jerome has his phone ring a few times during the interview with he stating it is common when treating adolescents. It could cost as much as one-hundred-million dollars to shut the whole program down because of restart up costs. There is a knock at the doctor's door and a group of teenagers is seen outside ready to start their session. He excuses himself to Chief Johnson, but the group session is there to begin. Brenda gets the name of the drug company lead, a Dr. Dawson.

Brenda has Dr. Dawson in her office where he is adamant about not shutting down the program and putting his company under suspicion. Dawson threatens Chief Johnson telling her to leave his company alone. Lt. Flynn tells Det. Daniels and Lt. Tao he believes he might have found the chink in our Chief's armor-plated Wonder-Bra. He describes the ethics violation inquiry in Atlanta and has his source from the press help him dig for information about the case. Brenda wants to solve the case of murder to Dr. Rainey and if he had published the cases of failure in the experimental drug program, wouldn't that have had the same effect on the program being delayed? I'm looking for a bad guy that killed someone. Dr. Dawson continues his mean demeanor in Chief Johnson's office, even referring to Atlanta and a possible lawsuit to the LAPD. Pope corners Brenda explaining how Lt. Flynn's idea of the special master would help uncover a possible suspect. Pope waves over Flynn and Brenda imparts, there is no better time than the present, step into my office, please. Brenda proceeds to state how unhappy she is Flynn went over her head. This idea of yours is a no go because she does not want wait around two months for a judge to consider the document where they could lose time in solving the case. Brenda makes it incredibly clear to Flynn she is not interested unless the sun explodes, then she would consider the proposal. She directs to Flynn, get the students in here to be interviewed now. Flynn rejoins, whatever you say ma'am.

Gabriel to Brenda, can we talk a minute regarding ethics? Certainly, detective. There nothing that would please me more than to get information from Dr. Rainey's office files or from Dr. Dawson's company files. It is not just an issue in ethics, Brenda makes the point to Gabriel, it's a matter of logic, if Dr. Rainey's files are so important, then why are they still in the victim's office? If Dr. Rainey's files could tell us who murdered him, then why didn't the killer take them? Gabriel replies, that's a very interesting question. Brenda directs her ire, so while Lieutenant Flynn gets all bent out of shape with me, I want to find out who is all bent out of shape with Dr. Rainey. For example, the parents of Cody Hammond. Brenda and Gabriel visit the Hammonds in their home. Mr. Hammond claims Dr. Rainey killed his son, because when he got sick while on the medication, they took him off the drug altogether. Mrs. Hammond recalls, when the paramedics arrived, my son was lying dead near the dining room table. None of that matters, because you didn't come here to investigate what happened to Cody anyway, did you? Mrs. Hammond gets up from her chair to grab her drink sitting next to the near-empty Stoli bottle. Mr. Hammond expresses his feelings about Dr. Rainey and the drug company where they continue along their paths like nothing happened. Brenda and he have a poignant exchange about the two deaths, Cody and Dr. Rainey.

Pope asks Flynn, Lieutenant, what's all this? Flynn quips, it's bring-a-juvenile-offender to work day. Chief Johnson wanted us to interview as many kids associated with the drug trial as we could put names to. Pope's response to Flynn, instead of going through the victim's files? Yeah, we're filling up the joint with teenage junkies. Pope abides with Flynn, I'll have another talk with Deputy Chief Johnson, after Flynn informs him she passed on the summary judgement. Flynn wants to pursue another angle with Chief Johnson before Pope has another talk with her.

Flynn to Gabriel, I brought in all the names from the phone dump like she asked me, plus some high-school junior Dr. Rainey put on the no admit list for dealing pot, Eric Plackton. Mr. Plackton was a little more reluctant to stop by, he put Sanchez through hell. Gabriel to Flynn, hey lieutenant, it's what she wanted, not me. Flynn retorts, well, you keep telling yourself that Sergeant, maybe it will sound believable. Flynn walks away as Gabriel shakes his head in disgust.

An officer or two officers interview the teen-agers, while Chief Johnson and Dr. Jerome observe in the media room. Lt. Tao to Teri, were you mad at him? Teri says, no. I just wanted back in the drug trial. Provenza and Sanchez interview the drug dealer Julio had to run to catch. Gabriel is interviewing Gretchen. Gretchen reveals, I never had a problem with medicine, no side effects. It completely changed my life. Mrs. Schiller adds, we don't see the depression anymore.

Provenza continues interviewing the teen drug-dealer Eric while others watch in the control room. Provenza avows, you knifed another boy. Dr. Jerome discloses to Brenda, somebody must have pulled some strings for this kid, because we weed out kids like him. He should have never been in the study at all. Brenda to Dr. Jerome: Dr. Rainey's wife warned him about kids like that. Dr. Jerome: Leah Rainey sees the worst kids in the city. Provenza exclaims to Eric, the day Rainey died, campus security caught you on tape. Eric discloses, I sneak in every day, I go where my customers are. Dr. Jerome is in the media room watching Gretchen, and standing next to Brenda. Gretchen to Gabriel: Dr. Rainey did not want me to see my boyfriend anymore either. Gabriel: What did Dr. Rainey have against your boyfriend? Gretchen: When you are that old, you forget, I think, what it is like to be in love. This medication changed my life, if he hadn't put me in that study, I would not have known how to care for someone else. Eric, teen-drug-dealer, you never even read me my rights; you don't have crap on drug charges. Brenda politely asks Dr. Jerome, could you please wait for me outside in the hallway, thank you. She then turns and speaks to the guys in the media room, you guys are acting like a bunch of dentists in a strip club; out, out. She adds, if you can't book our drug dealer on possession, get him out of here. Brenda yells at Lt. Provenza, she is sixteen years old, he continues to stare at Gretchen in the video, sarcastically saying I am so ashamed, as he finally exits.

Lt. Tao asks Lt. Flynn, you're emailing a reporter? Flynn counters, you want to dig through the dirt, get yourself a worm.

At Brenda's house answering the phone from Gabriel, are you sure it was Dr. Jerome's office and not Dr. Rainey's? Which files did he say were stolen? How far away are you? There is a knock at the door at Brenda's house, she is surprised to Det. Gabriel. This is Special Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI, so we will pick up in a few days, then I'll call you. They all leave Brenda's.

At the doctor's offices, Det. Gabriel expresses, there is no forcible entry, Lt. Tao adds, she wants a complete SID workup anyway. Dr. Jerome comments, they took my laptop. Tell me, Miss Johnson, why would one of the kids do this to me?

Brenda questions Gabriel, did you do all your homework on Dr. Rainey's wife? He retorts, need to talk with her again first thing in the morning. The victim's wife Leah Rainey is a psychiatrist also, working in the same building. Gabriel interviews Dr. Rainey. I will try to make this as painless as possible. Your husband never called the Hammonds? Mrs. Rainey ripostes, he would have liked to, but he was counseled against it by the insurance company, malpractice issues, saying you are sorry for someone's loss can be misconstrued as an admission of guilt. Gabriel inquires, can you think of any reason your husband might have broken a confidentiality agreement? Dr. Rainey reacts with yes, when a crime has been committed, privilege goes away, you call the police. Gabriel pursues his questioning, suppose one of the teenagers opened up to your husband about a crime, how could I access that file? Mrs. Rainey rejoins, privilege belongs to the patient, or in this case their legal guardians; do you even know who these kids are? Only a few, he replies.

Pope is looking at the newspaper article while talking to Brenda as they walk the hall at HQ. Pope expresses wow, could they have put sexual misconduct in any bigger type. Brenda asserts the writer said the source is a high-ranking officer close to the chief's office. Pope retorts, well, you know it wasn't me because I know the whole thing was bogus. A lot of people could have leaked that story. Didn't you tell me that jerk from Curson was threatening you? While you're questioning their ethics, maybe they are returning the favor; reporters disguise their sources all the time. Gabriel slaps the newspaper article down on Flynn's desk in front of him, gives him a cold stare; no words are exchanged.

Pope is in Brenda's office listening, do I look hurt to you, Will? No, if I'm not mistaken that's your angry face, as it is with most things. Brenda looks perplexed listening to Pope's comment on what came down in Atlanta. Julio enters her office, that good looking girl we had in here yesterday, Gretchen Schiller. She was just rushed to the hospital with convulsions.

Brenda greets the Schillers at the hospital, while Gabriel has choice words for Dr. Dawson, who questions why LAPD is at the hospital; the doctor is put in his place quickly by Gabriel. Mrs. Schiller is frantic, the doctor said they couldn't find any sign of the medicine in her bloodwork. Does that make any sense to you? Brenda reacts, it's beginning to, yes. Brenda to the Schiller's, what happened to Gretchen is not your fault.

Brenda is in the electronics room viewing the original interviews of Gretchen and Eric; she is instructing Buzz to play them, rewind and play them again. The conversations are Gretchen saying no side effects, with Gretchen's mother adding she has even started dating again. Brenda realizes Gretchen's mother was right, she was taking the medication. Brenda has Buzz play back interviews of drug dealer and Gretchen Shiller. The drug dealer student speaks, I didn't care, I was getting a placebo anyway. Now Brenda knows, uttering to the dual-screens and Buzz, I was concentrating on the wrong person. Brenda is referring to the drug dealer as the wrong person rather than Gretchen. Det. Gabriel, I'm going to need Gretchen's cell phone again and I want to see your notes from your interview with Dr. Rainey's wife.

Brenda is in Pope's office, having a conversation with him and he is to trying to understand why she wants the officer guarding Dr. Rainey's office removed, but not taking the files, making them completely accessible. She affirms, this will help make the case. Brenda hands Pope an authorization for wearing a wire, because she cannot authorize it herself.

Brenda encounters Dr. Jerome and Dr. Watson arguing in the murder room, she declares to Dr. Watson, Gretchen is going to be fine. She is not talking yet but the doctors will find out what happened with her medication. I'm still interested in Dr. Rainey's files. Dr. Watson maintains they're protected. Brenda retorts, I know, confidentiality, but I can still get permission from the patients. Dr. Jerome can give me the names of the parents since the patients are minors. Dawson shouts back, if the parents find out what happened to Gretchen and Cody they're going to pull their kids from the study; you think what happened in Atlanta got ugly, wait. Brenda informs Dr. Jerome, as of tonight, Dr. Rainey's files will be free of police protection, and Dr. Dawson knows that.

Pope to Flynn, handing Flynn a one-page document, Lieutenant Flynn, Deputy Chief Johnson's authorization for a wire. I want it run through the van and through our electronics room here. You'll have to split up the squad, but you've gotten pretty good at that, haven't you? You leak to the press again, I'll have your stripes. Got it? Lt. Flynn acknowledges. Pope's last orders, give her the authorization, take the night off, let the people here do their job.

Brenda is sitting in Dr. Rainey's office with the lights off and near a light switch, Gabriel and Julio are in the van, Louie and Buzz are in the electronics room, all of them are listening to Brenda, wearing a wire, in Dr. Rainey's office. Dr. Jerome enters through the dark, he goes to the file drawer, pulls a file, attempts to leave and Brenda turns on the lights. She speaks to Dr. Jerome, that happen to be Gretchen Schiller's file doctor? Yes, it is Gretchen's file. Dr. Jerome speaks, after you told me the files were unprotected, with Dr. Dawson gone, I got worried, now that I don't have any records of my own. How is it your office got broken into with a policeman down the hall and why would the drug company steal your files and leave Dr. Rainey's files untouched? Brenda looks Dr. Jerome into his eyes, asks him may I be honest with you? I think you killed Dr. Rainey yourself. I think the file contains information Dr. Rainey was going to report you to the police. My guess is Dr. Rainey gave you a chance to turn yourself into the police, and you paid him back by smashing him over the head with his phone and smothering him to death with the cushion from his sofa. . Brenda continues, from Gretchen Schiller's interview, Gretchen said she had a boyfriend Dr. Rainey wouldn't approve. You got the file right there, why don't you open it up and read your friend's notes. Now that you have broken into the office and stolen the file, I cannot open it myself, but a judge can. Dr. Jerome reacts, she is a delusional girl, on serious medication. Brenda ripostes, this is so amazing, holding up Gretchen's cell phone, your entire relationship memorialized in text messages. Dr. Jerome tries to somehow justify his behavior, but Brenda corrects him, in this case it's called murder. Dr. Jerome counters, how is it murder? You said Gretchen was getting better. Brenda retorts, I lied, she's still in a coma, and the person you have been exchanging text messages all day about accidently switching out Gretchen's medication with a placebo is a forty-five-year-old Chinese-American detective in my office. Lt. Tao sends Dr. Jerome the text U R a murderer. When I find cases where someone has been sexually abusing a minor, I usually find it is part of a pattern. You said you specialize in adolescents. How closely do you study them? Transference issues, in law enforcement we call it statutory rape, maybe you prefer molesting. Brenda has reached the point where the case is solved and she has heard enough of Dr. Jerome, murderer of his associate, Dr. Rainey. The officers in the van, Gabriel and Julio, say it is time to leave the van and enter the office. Brenda tells the officers to get him out of here; Gabriel and Julio arrest Dr. Jerome."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542957/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,Brenda works to solve the rape and murder of a congresswoman's daughter.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Greg Yaitanes'],"['', '']",[],"['police team', 'rape and murder', 'attempted rape', 'congresswoman']",[],"Brenda and Gabriel enter the hotel where U.S. Congresswoman Simmons is attending a function and just being introduced by the Mistress of Ceremonies. The officers ask the receptionist for the Representative's seat location. They walk to the correct table, inform US Rep. Simmons who they are and they would like a word with her about her daughter. She responds, give her five minutes; Brenda, with Sgt. Gabriel, depart for the corridor. The Congresswoman, with her aide, Larry Fine, enter the hallway and Brenda asks her if this is your daughter, from a picture she is holding. Brenda informs her daughter has been found murdered. Sgt. Gabriel says it was from a blow to the head, and she was also raped in her home. Rep. Simmons is naturally distraught, Chief Johnson says they will talk later, adding, this being a terrible time to converse.

Brenda enters the crime scene, filled with her team of officers and patrol staff. Lt. Tao says there were no sign of forced entry, likely it was someone Carla knew. Tao shows Brenda the probable events in the bedroom; Brenda asks Det. Daniels for a name of the ex-boyfriend, when she can determine it. There is a cutout picture from a mural Brenda finds in the dresser drawer; it is the boyfriend and Carla. Daniels comes back with information on Brett Harlan, with whom Carla worked with at their employer ad agency, which Brenda says that explains why she kept it to herself.

Brenda acts as Det. Gabriel's secretary, entering the interview room where Brett Harlan waits. She is wearing an earpiece to hear of the fingerprint report from the crime scene. Brenda questions Brett on his whereabouts around the time of the murder and he gives a friend's name he was with at a bar. Brenda asks for a swab for DNA because some of his stuff was found at the crime scene. Brett figures out it was Carla who was raped while Brenda feigns, she was not supposed to inform anyone of the victim's identity. Brett says Carla was holding onto his belongings until he gave her key back. Brett explains their schedules have not been suitable for him to meet Carla to make the exchange, the key for the personal items. Brenda says she cannot provide further information about the case. Gabriel confirms the alibi with Brett's friend and Tao says the fingerprints do not match the killer's, i.e. anyone known to the police, including Brett. Brett says he warned Carla of doing this weird stuff. Gabriel tells Brenda that Brett's fingerprints do not match the rapist. Brett removes his shirt for Brenda to look for any blood on him unidentified from the crime scene; Brett complies and there is no blood or any marks. Brenda tells Brett someone killed Carla during the attack in her home.

Pope emphatically states Rep. Simmons wants to enter Carla's home, being the emotional wreck, she is, so if you want something Brenda, go get it now. Brenda takes the key from the uniformed officer, leaving the door open, since he says the key is marked do not duplicate. Brenda begins her search of Carla's home and bedroom. As she is looking through some desk ornaments, someone tapes her mouth with duct tape, throws her to floor, slugs her, tosses her on the bed, proceeds to rape her, when she pulls her revolver out sticking in the man's gut. He gets off of her, removes his mask at her command, where she continues to point the gun at him. She informs him he is under arrest for breaking-and-entering, attempted rape, and assaulting a police officer.

Brenda places one more bandage on her forehead, calls Agent Howard, when Det. Daniels enters her office, saying her assailant is in the interview room and Congresswoman Simmons is in Pope's office awaiting word on her attacker's response to police questioning. Sgt. Gabriel confronts interviewee Andrew Gage, Brenda's attacker, stating to him, you are under arrest for the attempted rape and battery of a police officer. Gage states he doesn't need an attorney, shouting to the Sgt. he is married, while Gabriel opens Gage's leather bag of S & M accessories. Gage says I brought what I thought she would like as Gabriel questions how his wife would react to his extracurricular activities. Brenda is watching this interview with Pope in the media room. She had previously told Gabriel he would be more objective conducting the interview. Gage screams to Gabriel the woman who did this to my face was asking for it as he refers to a document in his bag. Gabriel refers to the previous girl was attacked in the same house and Gage denies knowing anything about a previous girl. The paper gives the address of Carla's house, requesting the service through a web site referral; Gage repeats, she was literally asking for it, via a personal of the Jones list. Gabriel looks at the paper, Brenda asks Pope to please have Gabriel stop the interview.

Brenda walks the webpage document info to Pope's office where Simmons and her aide are waiting. Brenda requests Rep. Simmons let the police finish their investigation before asking for this progress report. Brenda tells Congresswoman Simmons the man we arrested tonight is not the man who killed your daughter, his prints do not match any print we found at the house. Brenda proceeds to explain what she knows based on the Jones list, i.e. personal ads placed for S&M invitations, Representative Simmons says she doesn't have her reading glasses, Brenda reads the ad. The sheet reads, in part, come to the house, key under a rock by the door, tape my mouth and have your way with me. Simmons interrupts, stating Carla did not write that filth. She leaves the room while Larry asks how the ad was found. Pope tells him from someone responding to it. Brenda assures him the ad will be taken down by morning. Larry leaves. Brenda sadly laments to Pope, she was asking to be raped Will, she wasn't asking to be murdered.

Brenda is met by Agent Howard in the parking lot, afterward at her house, where he attaches a new bandage to her forehead. She invites Fritz to spend the night on the sofa sleeper, not in her bed, as she tells him she has been through a rough day with men.

Brenda and team head to the Jones list headquarters as Brenda learns from Lt. Tao one million people a week visit the web page. Entering Jones headquarters and dealing with the irritated owners, Brenda manages to secure the list of responders logging into this ad featuring Carla's address. Over six-hundred members of the Jones list reviewed Carla's ad, DNA from the rape kit indicates the killer is Caucasian and has red hair. Matching DMV photos will validate the suspects and a search can begin.

Brenda and Gabriel locate suspect Corey Horowitz at his fraternity, but he does not really have red hair, and usage of his credit card leads to the home of pledge Jeffrey. Brenda interviews the neophyte fraternity member, telling her the woman resisted the attack, fighting back harder than expected. Jeffrey waives his right to an attorney as Brenda provides proof of his fingerprints at the crime scene and bets him there will be a DNA match if he does not want to talk. Jeffrey lets Brenda know the fraternity boys dared him to follow-through with the meeting. He tells Brenda when I got to the house, I found the key, snuck in the front door, took off all my clothes, had the tape ready, doing whatever it said in the ad. When I let her up, she got hysterical, she tried to kill me. She pulled a lamp out of the wall, hit me over the head, she was screaming like she was crazy. Jeffrey lifts his shirt up showing Brenda the blood and wounds from Carla's defensive moves. She broke this glass thing, she gouged me and was slashing at my neck. She was trying to kill me, so I pushed her away, when she smashed her head on the dresser. I tried to help her up when her face just went white. I didn't know what to do, then she was dead. I left, locked the door behind me, kept the key, because I didn't want anyone else to go in there. I didn't know what else to do.

Brenda leaves Jeffrey, points to the restroom for the disturbed Congresswoman, argues to Gabriel and Pope arresting Jeffrey is not the way to proceed. We can't get him for B & E because he had access to a key supposedly left by Carla, he can't be arrested for rape because he reasonably thought he had consent, and charging him with murder, he will argue self-defense because Carla fought back. Brenda has a glazed look in her face repeating Carla fought back is what is wrong.

Lt. Tao notes to Brenda every time Carla Simmons went online, her computer recorded it. Brenda asks to be shown how Carla placed her ad. She was not a regular on this site, just the one time placing the ad, as Tao demonstrates for Brenda. There is also no record of any kind of dating-service-site activity like the Jones list from Carla's computer. Tao prints out the date and time stamp of the ad placement for Brenda. Tao asks, you have a confession, what is it you are trying to prove? Intent, Lt. Tao, intent, because without intent we do not have a murder, and our rapist goes free.

Brenda gets information from the team how the descriptions were created by the Jones list users. She has called back Brett Harlan, ex-boyfriend, to answer some loose ends since they found the killer and to return his stuff. Brenda shows Brett the ad, saying Carla was raped and murdered because of the ad on the internet. The ad was placed by somebody else using her computer, notice there is a date and time stamp on it. Brenda tells Brett that Carla did not fill the Jones list form in herself, she was at work when it was completed, and it was filled by a browser auto fill. Brenda tells Brett there is a better reason Carla did not place this ad because she fought back, and why would she fight back if rape was what she intended. Brenda informs Brett, she didn't even know about the Jones list, someone else put up this ad. Someone who had access to her computer, someone who could get in and out of her house.

Brett responds with are you suggesting I put that ad up? Brenda answers no, I am not suggesting that, I can prove it. Another ad you placed of yourself on another site, describing yourself as a control freak, you spelt control incorrectly twice in each ad, spelling it with two l's. Brenda puts the proof on the table in front of Brett. She tells him, walking out that door now makes you look guilty which is what the District Attorney will see as this is being taped. Please tell me you didn't want Carla to be raped? Did you expect people to act on that ad and murder Carla? Brett is standing and shouting no, no. He sits and tells his version of what made him place the ad. Weeks ago he lost his temper reacting to Carla's gunning the car in reverse when he punched her in the arm. He apologized several times, not even bruising her, but she broke up with him for that one thing. Brett said he pursued the apologies, calling her a hundred times, but Carla never responded. Brenda says so you were hurt and angry; she says thank you Brett, it's not pretty, but now at least we know the truth.

Brenda puts Brett's stuff on the table asking for her house key since that was the deal made with Carla. Brenda says, she would return your stuff and you would give her back the key. Brett says oh yeah, I must have lost it. Brenda says really, the landlord only issued two keys, one Carla kept and the other she gave to you. Brenda produces a key, which Brett tries to take, but Brenda pulls it back. She says I got this from the guy who raped and murdered Carla, which you left outside for him. He found it outside her house under the rock where you said it would be. If you didn't intend for anyone to rape Carla, why did you leave the key for him? Brett is silent. Brenda comments, shoot, now we have a problem. Gabriel speaks, if someone dies in the commission of a felony, like solicitation of rape, and there was proven intent, Brenda adds, that is first-degree murder. Brett speaks, saying I thought if she knew what real violence is like then she would know what I did was really nothing.

Congresswoman Simmons enters the murder room after Brenda is warned she is approaching, pulling down the screen to cover the picture detail on the murder board. Simmons looks at Brenda, I think I could have spared myself some doubts about my daughter if I had let you do your job. I can't begin to thank you for proving she was the girl I thought she was; I did know her, so thank you. Brenda says you're welcome. Pope asks if she is okay and she responds yes, I am good. Alone, Brenda calls Fritz to have breakfast with him, somewhere away from the offices and she asks him for good directions."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542967/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,"Priority Homicide investigates the murder of a judge, and Brenda must bond with his autistic son to find the killer.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Gloria Muzio'],"['', '', '']",[],"['police team', 'murder', 'missing boy']",[],"A judge is found shot to death lying in a park and his son is missing, possibly abducted by the murderer. The mother, Jillian Thompson, comes to HQ looking for her son, Brenda learns she is divorced, working in Phoenix, where the judge had full custody in L.A. Brenda is aware their son is autistic, after visiting the judge's home. Jillian speaks about the treatment her son Keith has received from the classmates where he attends school.

Eddie Hoke is a suspect, a big fish per Captain Taylor, Pope has Hoke brought in for questioning with Brenda and Taylor sitting in on the interview. Hoke's attorney states my client was in your cell when this all went down.

The judge's car is found at the airport with the autistic son in the trunk. Brenda has some of her clues divulged by way of the son as she seeks the murderer. Keith is continually uttering the coordinates where he is located or wanting to know the coordinates of his immediate location; the episode title is a reflection of Keith's autistic behavior.

Brenda asks the team of detectives, wouldn't a carjacker who had no qualms killing a judge, also kill Keith? Brenda pleads with Pope not release Keith to his mother because she will take him to Phoenix then she will have to have him extradited. The judge's Mercedes has a special GPS installed, stating the precise location of the vehicle upon start of the car through an electronic voice. The reason why Keith went into one of his anxiety modes when Brenda's car was started and the voice never came on announcing the location. By researching the coordinates, Lt. Tao and Brenda realize the killer made a stop other than the park or the poker game.

Gabriel and Brenda go to the other location to find a bar, with Gabriel asking Brenda why would someone who has just shot a judge with an autistic teen locked in the trunk of a stolen car, come here? Daniels and Sanchez have Tao search the calls of the number from the men's room payphone from a time immediately after the murder. There was one familiar number called from that phone. It turns out to be a cell number held by Jillian Thompson; a phone she later denies owning, although purchased in Tempe AZ.

Video tape shows a man leaving the bar, who in turn is identified by Keith from the control room. The suspected killer is Jason Murphy, interviewed by Brenda, determining his brother was sentenced by the judge. Brenda describes Jason's actions on the night of the murder. Three cigarettes he smoked with the grounded butts in the area outside of the poker game. Jason car-jacked the Mercedes, he shot the judge, stole his car with Keith in the back seat, later put in the trunk, which Keith scratched Jason because he doesn't like being touched. He drove to LAX, left the car and flew home to San Fran, his flight manifest shown to him by Brenda. Brenda asks Jason to write down the name of the person hiring him to kill the judge. He would not be charged by the state of California for any crime giving Brenda the written name.

Brenda leaves Jason in his interview room going to Jillian's interview room, where Brenda is told Jillian did not purchase a prepaid cell phone, days earlier. She answers Brenda's inquiry of the $75,000 withdrawal being for home improvements to accommodate Keith moving to Phoenix and having his own room. Brenda then shows Jillian a picture of Jason Murphy asking how long she has known this man? Jillian says she has never seen him before, but Brenda asks why did he call you twenty minutes after he murdered your husband?

Brenda shows Jillian pictures of two choices where Keith can be housed while she is in prison; she also sees her name penned by Jason Murphy on a tablet saying she hired him to kill her ex-husband. Brenda says to Jillian you have a choice of facilities for Keith to reside, tell me you paid Jason to kill your husband or I will turn Keith over to Child Services and he will go the lesser desirable location.

Jason Murphy called the judge's home threatening husband Michael Thompson according to Jillian. Brenda says to her, then you knew he would not be opposed morally to killing the judge. When Michael took away Keith, he took away my life, cries Jillian to Brenda, I guess now we're even.

Brenda goes back to the interview room with Jason Murphy and his attorney Pierson. She then introduces Special Agent Howard from the FBI, who will be taking Jason into custody, as the new Federal law for car-jacking has the death penalty attached to it. Agent Howard will fill you in on all the details. Thank you says Brenda, as Agent Howard reads Jason his rights."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542956/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,"Brenda is asked to prove a hate crime, but Taylor's interference may finally be enough to ruin the case.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Arvin Brown'],[''],[],"['african american female detective', 'african american woman']",[],"A man enters a bar requesting help with a bloodied individual being carried in his straddled arms. A doctor-customer calls for an ambulance and the police, while attending to the injured man. The doctor re-phones emergency services, saying he called twenty minutes ago asking them to hurry. There is a composite poster labeled gay-basher on the entry door. The man-in-the-bar ridicules Det. Ross for his late arrival and handling of the bloody incident. Captain Taylor explains to Lt. Flynn, the hand-off to Priority Homicide is due to the political nature of the case; he excuses Det. Ross from his duties while Chief Johnson enters the bar area. Brenda has brought her sick cat to a crime scene in a pillow case and she is questioned by Sgt. Gabriel, why the cat to the crime scene? Gabriel hands the animal to paramedic Terrence, requesting it be brought to an animal hospital, while Terrence is there to transport the beating victim. The man originally carrying the victim was given a sedative by Dr. Hall, and is holding the bat found outside where the bloodied man was found. He is crouched near the victim, dazed, due to the medicine he was given. Det. Sanchez informs Brenda the bar patrons have disturbed the crime scene as he explains the case to update her.

At autopsy, Dr. Crippen explains the first blow to the side of the head is the cause of death, the other wounds came afterward, including the cracked ribs, left arm broken in two places and the shattered femur. The blow to the side of the head is the only strike from the back, the other wounds came after the victim was likely dead. Brenda wants the autopsy evidence in a hate crime detailed before the body is opened up to prevent the court accusing the police from inflicting the wounds. The doctor understands there was some jewelry stolen. Gabriel says a Gucci watch and a diamond ring. Dr. Crippen hands Brenda the item found under the victim's T-shirt; she holds up a pair of designer dog-tags, diamond-in-laid. Crippen adds, there was residue of Special-K under the victim's nostril; ketamine mix to dull the senses, popular in gay-dance-clubs. Brenda is aware of the drug's effects, possibly making the victim not suffer through the beating.

Flynn gets a tip the gay-basher-poster looks just like the woman-caller's boyfriend; he transfers the caller to Robbery/Homicide, directly informing Captain Taylor of the call. Brenda goes to her office where Assemblyman Bridges, local politician representing a gay neighborhood, and Chief Pope are waiting for her. She tells them they are picking up the man matching the composite picture. The only blood found at the crime scene is that of the victim, despite there being so many people disturbing the area. Brenda educates Bridges on procedure, i.e. we do not disseminate the picture of a person-of-interest to prevent the court from accusing the police of contaminating the evidence; we just don't want to track the murderer down, we want to make certain we do it so he is put away for life. Robbery/Homicide is in progress of apprehending a suspect at his apartment address with Captain Taylor leading the group. Blake Rawlings, gay-basher is taken out of his apartment by the police when they bash open the door and he is shooting up in the bathroom. Brenda politely explains her methods to the Assemblyman of gaining the suspect's trust while Rawlings is cuffed and hauled away by Robbery-Homicide. Taylor makes certain Blake eyes the composite drawing while he is on the floor of his motel-room-apartment; by some standards, Rawlings was roughed up taking him into custody.

Pope is screaming there is no evidence where the arrest was made, no wallets, no jewelry, no bloody clothes, no stolen property at all. Brenda, in Pope's office, reminds him of the mess Robbery-Homicide made of apprehending Blake Rawlings based on the composite drawing tip. Pope doesn't want to cause any more friction within the gay-neighborhood via Assemblyman Bridges. He insists Brenda continue with the case and leave Taylor be. Brenda says Taylor wants the case, let him take it. Pope insists she take it and he will handle Taylor. Brenda tells him you always say you will handle Captain Taylor but you never do. She exits Pope's office upset, with the file.

Brenda has Barry, the victim's friend looking at Blake from the media room, and he recognizes him from the picture in the bar, not sure of the identity that night. Barry tells her Rawlings was leaning over Clint in the dark at the time and then he threw the bat at me. Brenda asks Barry to describe what happened before the attack. Barry describes Clint as a little high, they stopped for a drink before heading out dancing; Barry was the designated driver. He left the bar, but to return, forgetting his jacket with his cellphone in it. He tells her their house just went on the market, he has not been working much lately, and Clint was trying to get back into acting. Barry is teary telling his story. He does not recognize the found dog-tags, he says they were certainly not Clint's.

Brenda interviews Blake Rawlings with Jimmy York, Blake's attorney. Blake says he goes after gay guys heading back to their cars because they are dropping stuff, usually alone and they have money; he claims he does hate anybody. Blake says the stolen property is hiding in the trunk of his girlfriend's car. He tells Brenda he went to the grocery store the night of the assault because the girlfriend doesn't want him using drugs around her; he used the parking lot of the store to shoot up and continues to plead for help from Brenda.

The police call upon Jennifer Russell, Blake's girlfriend, who remembers and calls out Captain Taylor's name to Lt. Flynn, saying she was the person calling the tip line for the reward money, turning in Blake. She said Flynn transferred her call to Captain Taylor; so, did you bring the money? Lt. Flynn tells her, you don't get the money until he is convicted, honey. Flynn hands her a search warrant, they go to the garage, pop the trunk, finding all sorts of loot and a wooden bat; just like Blake said it would be.

It doesn't surprise Brenda that Flynn transferred the call to Taylor, as she looks over the stolen property tagged on her desk. She listens to Det. Gabriel praising her good work, saying he just wants to get the bad guy. She orders him, together with Sanchez and some uniforms to find the watch and wallet near the crime scene. Terrence interrupts Brenda to report on her cat; it was very pregnant with six kittens, presenting her with bill. Pope calls for her, she says Sgt. Gabriel will show you out and I will pick up my cat, thank you. Brenda informs Gabriel they will not be arresting Blake just yet.

Agent Howard is driving Brenda to dinner, but before they dine, she must meet with Pope for a drink. Fritz says he will pick up her cat and kittens. She informs Pope she hasn't charged Blake with the murder yet, after Pope hands her a token gift of appreciation for her hard work and for putting up with the forces that are; he tells her the gift is a pair of small diamond earrings. He asks why Blake hasn't been charged. Brenda says it is an evidence issue and no confession are reasons given for not making the arrest stick.

Fritz notices the blue box from Pope, saying jewelry is never just jewelry, despite the way Brenda pushes it off as the token gift it was. Brenda's epiphany is when she thinks of the meaning behind the dog-tags encrusted with diamonds. They were given to Clint by someone other than his lover Barry. Brenda is holding Kitty, while the kittens are in the back seat. Agent Howard ponders how he is going to valet this car with six kittens in the back seat.

The kittens are in Brenda's office as she gets some good news when Gabriel gives her the stolen wallet, ring and watch taken from Clint. They were tossed in a nearby pond with the money gone from the wallet. Brenda asks Lt. Tao to identify the merchant selling the diamonds in the dog-tags, Det. Sanchez is asked for a dump of every cell phone the victim was using in order to find anyone else he might have been taking to at length. Sgt. Gabriel is asked to secure credit reports, hopefully providing the frequent callers from Clint and Barry. I am pretty sure they didn't buy this necklace, but I am pretty certain there is someone else who did. Flynn asks what about me? Brenda says you can command the tip line because irrespective of already catching the guy, who would transfer those calls to Captain Taylor if you weren't here? Flynn has a look about him knowing he crossed the line.

Provenza asks Taylor why he is marching Blake Rawlings to an interview room lead by Det. Ross and patrolmen. Taylor responds, sometimes Pope giveth and sometimes Pope taketh away. Brenda is reviewing Blake's interview when Provenza inquiries what she wanted. She says I think I got this, go home Lieutenant, there no sense everyone being exhausted. Taylor grills Blake, working on a confession from him on the premise he gets help for his addiction. Provenza mentions Tao says you might think there is someone else that could be involved in this murder. Brenda answers, there could be a strong possibility. Taylor sweats Blake into a confession, telling him I can help you. I can give you an upgrade from assault with a deadly weapon to first degree murder; Det. Ross, put that back in its cage, and Taylor exits the interview room.

Tao, with Sanchez, show Brenda the results of their findings. Julian Carver, photographer, purchased the dog-tags on his American Express card. Brenda looks through the credit reports confirming Barry and Clint hadn't made a lot of money in the last couple of years. Tao notes they were not legally married, but they had joint accounts, shown from their credit reports, eyeing also the suit Barry bought for Clint's funeral, draining the last of his available credit. Flynn trumpets Taylor just got a confession from Blake Rawlings, but Provenza, with the help of Buzz, says that confession isn't likely to hold up. In his hand, he has tapes from retailers showing Blake was in the parking lot like he said, when the murder took place. Brenda views the video and agrees, Blake couldn't have committed the crime, after looking at the tapes with other officers, and Buzz running the machine at Provenza's direction. Brenda states she needs this Julian Carver.

Brenda, Gabriel and Sanchez drop in on photographer Julian Carver, and Brenda asks him how well he knew Clint Harper. Julian says I took six rolls of him six weeks ago, he was looking for an agent, needed some new pictures. Brenda says according to his cell phone records, you must have known him fairly well, records show frequent calls between you two, some were rather lengthy. Sanchez finds a bag of Special K stored in the microwave oven, Brenda comments, now I don't know what to believe, Mr. Carver. Brenda holds up the dog-tags found on Clint while Gabriel finds revealing poster-size photos of Clint and Julian. Julian confesses to his affair with Clint. He opens up saying Clint was ready to move in, leaving Barry for me. Julian tries to prevent Brenda from taking anything belonging to Clint, including the large provocative pictures. She counters with either you let me take these pictures or I arrest you for possession of a controlled substance, your choice. Don't worry about the pictures, I going to display them.

Julian Carver is alone in an interview room while Brenda and Barry watch in the control room. Barry says he has never seen him before, even after being shown a poster picture of him, looking much healthier and wearing less clothes. She then shows him a poster-pic of Clint; little comment from Barry. Brenda hands him a box of items Clint was not wearing in the picture. The property left at the studio now belongs to you Barry, community property law prevailing, including the house you were selling, to pay off your debts. If Clint had dissolved your partnership, you would have had to split everything equally, after you supported him for the last six years, then you fell on some hard times. You went out looking for another boyfriend and you knew a composite was being circulated around your neighborhood, you told me yourself. Brenda reminds Barry of the aluminum bat purchased days ago, using the same credit card for the new suit he purchased yesterday. Those credit cards were stolen, and after you bludgeoned Clint to death, you threw those cards in the pond across the street. How did it feel, Mr. Anderson, the boy you spent all this time with was about to leave for someone else, with half your assets? Barry stares in silence at the revealing pictures of Clint with Julian, hung around the room by Brenda.

Screw Julian Carver! I loved Clint, I loved him. Barry's outburst when Brenda asks if they had a photographer at their ceremony. Barry states he begged Clint not to go, not to humiliate me, to allow these photographs. None of this was easy, I had given him everything, what had he given me, I never wanted to hurt him, I was trying to work it out.

Watching the Barry-interview with Pope and Brenda, Assemblyman Bridges says this was supposed to be a hate crime, Brenda responds, I think it is. Bridges comments, how am I to explain this to the community? Pope chimes in with well, you have been trying for years to say that gay and straight marriages were pretty much the same. I think this guy has done it for you.

Taylor is trying to justify his behavior with the case, i.e. Blake Rawlings' forced confession. Brenda speaks her mind to Taylor, it's not the department you have been treating like crap, it's me. That's because you have been getting mixed signals, so let's see if we can straighten things out. I don't want an apology from you, I want an acknowledgement of my rank. I want an understanding you are beneath me in the chain of command, and I want you to be officially warned if you undermine my investigations ever again, Chief Pope will recommend an investigation from Internal Affairs, which I believe is the established procedure for an insubordinate officer. Are we all agreed? Pope says I see nothing improper in that request. Good, thank you so much, as Brenda exits with her kittens in their box. Taylor tells Pope, sir, I think I should point out I only got the confession you wanted me to get. Pope answers back with on the other hand, you may have accomplished more than I expected.

Brenda returns home with the kittens and Fritz brings her a bed for Kitty and the pillow case she was in when Brenda brought Kitty to the crime scene. Brenda thanks Fritz for the return of the pillowcase as it was one of a set given to her from her mother when she went to school at Georgetown."

At the mother's home, Brenda informs her of the body recovery, the mother is hysterical with the news. The man standing next to the mother is her cousin, Alejandro, gardener for the same family-employer. Brenda and Sanchez listen to the mother's cries.

Dr. Crippen, Medical Examiner, estimates the time of death to 46-52 hours based on the time in the water and the amount of decomposition; Brenda confirms the time span between two and eight PM on Monday. Crippen begins with the rape kit exam, Brenda is obligated to observe, she soon has to leave the autopsy room and sit in the hallway. Dr. Crippen sits with her after he has completed the autopsy. The camera shot shows the marked abrasion on her cheek. Blunt force trauma to the head is the cause of death, the blow so strong it broke her neck, the lungs were empty, she died before she hit the water. The bruise on her was caused after death, there was sexual assault, a lot of ripping, a lot of tearing, she was a virgin. The DNA was washed away by the river water, there is nothing to collect for evidence. There was no evidence of torture, whatever happened to her she did not hurt for very long.

Det. Gabriel enters the Phillips house, employment home of Carmen Alvarez and her slain daughter, Marta. Mrs. Phillips assures Brenda that Marta and her mother were treated like family, asking what kind of monster would do this to a sweet girl like Marta? Hart Phillips comes into the kitchen area, reintroduces himself to Brenda, saying he has to leave, but they can talk later, as he has an appointment he has to attend. Austin Phillips, the son, describes a person of interest in the area, seen always carrying a camera, average height, dark hair and average weight.

Chief Johnson invites Austin and his mom to HQ to look at some photos of known sex-offenders in the area. Austin recognizes a picture, asking who he is. Brenda and Gabriel dispatch themselves to the house of Wayne Mathers, he answers the door, they enter, are introduced to Vera Mathers, Wayne's mother, who doesn't like the intrusion and suspicion from the LAPD. Wayne asks if he could change his shirt before they go downtown with pictures he has taken. Brenda sends Det. Gabriel out the back to watch so Wayne does not leave by the window, while Vera Mathews coughs repeatedly, smoking a cigarette and using an inhaler. Brenda asks Vera if she was home last Monday between two and eight PM, when a gunshot rings out from the bedroom. Wayne has shot himself dead on his bedroom floor. Gabriel calls for assistance, grabbing the weapon from Wayne's bloodied hand.

Brenda is in the murder room declaring she wants to know if Marta was the only child Wayne was able to find, in view of the many illegal children in L.A. Lt. Provenza comments on not being able interview the dead Mr. Mathers for a confession. Chief Johnson responds to the lieutenant's snide comment by informing all of the two-hundred-fifty-seven or more twelve-to-thirteen-year-old missing Latina girls. Illegals are prime targets for child molesters, Brenda wants to know if Marta was the only one Wayne managed to find. Brenda also would like to know how Marta got into that river. Brenda asks Gabriel to assemble a crew to dig up Wayne's backyard looking for any more victims. She also wants to know how Marta got that bruise on her cheek. She sends Provenza to Marta's school to talk to her teachers, to find out who her friends were. Chief Johnson requests, let's see if we can figure out how and when Wayne grabbed her; the choice of victim in this case is usually based on availability. Lt. Tao to look at Wayne's computer and Det. Sanchez to run photos by Marta's family. I want to go to sleep at night knowing we buried the killer and not his crimes.

Brenda and Sanchez are interviewing Alejandro trying to get a handle on the identity of Marta's killer. She places pictures of men in front of him seeking recognition. He does not ID any and claims it was his fault she was killed. He asserts it was he who brought up Carmen and Marta from Mexico, acting through a coyote and paying the $2,600 cost for each. Sanchez knows he is lying; the money is too much for him to have. Sanchez yells at him, he doesn't get a lawyer, illegals are not entitled to counsel. Brenda pleads with Alejandro for any information he can provide regarding the rape, beating, and dumping of Marta Alvarez into the river. Brenda advises Det. Sanchez about his temper, she wants to find out all she can these people, not scare them away. She sends the detective on a mission to find all he can about Alejandro.

Lt. Provenza meets Brenda in the hallway having nothing to report from the school but he has delivered Vera Mathers to her office. Brenda puts out Vera's cigarette, no smoking in her office. Vera says her son was a drunk, he didn't take pictures of human beings, he took pictures of flowers in parks and gardens. Too often he would be found with his pants down, having to pee, passed out in a park full of little kids; he was arrested and charged with the wrong crime, she insists her son was not a sex-offender. Wayne would never hurt a kid. She shouts disparaging remarks about the ethnicity looking at the picture of Marta. Vera blames Brenda for the death of Wayne.

Chief Johnson inquires who was aware of Carmen's weekly schedule? Carmen Alvarez answers very few people knew as she packed her daughter's belongings. Brenda learns firsthand Marta received good grades at school, evidenced by an A graded paper. Brenda admires Marta's work when she learns Mrs. Phillips returned the backpack to Carmen saying Marta forgot it at their house. Marta's backpack and notebook contained a handout Brenda holds in her hand dated the same day Marta disappeared. Brenda asks Carmen if she could borrow the school items, promising to return them. The expression on Brenda's face when she sees the date of the handout signals an alarm in her head.

At HQ, Brenda goes through the school items informing Det. Gabriel the Phillips' house could be the crime scene, requesting him to alert Mrs. Phillips of that fact, also Chief Johnson has Sgt. Gabriel get Wayne Mathers' photographs from SID, immediately. Lt. Tao requests Lt. Provenza's help him look at the photos. Mrs. Phillips is startled someone could have been in her house and taken Marta. Brenda asks if they could look around, getting her to sign a consent form. Austin Phillips takes a call from his father explaining the police are at the house. Lieutenants Provenza and Tao show each other pictures of flowers from Wayne's collection. Hart Phillips dismisses the police revoking the signed consent form. Provenza shows a photo with the date and time indicating the same hours the little girl was killed. Brenda is calling a judge for a warrant to enter the Phillip's house and search the premises. Det. Sanchez is putting a warrant out for Alejandro and Provenza calls Brenda with the photo find. Brenda asks Lt. Tao if the time, date could have been tampered with on Wayne's camera. Sanchez tells Brenda Alejandro has left the area, probably returned to Mexico, and Carmen has returned to Mexico. Hart Phillips is seen through their home glass doors, conferring with his wife and son, when Brenda informs him of the warrant she just received to search his house. He requests Chief Johnson for a place to talk; they head downtown while Mrs. Phillips and her son say they refuse to stay in the house. Brenda informs them their cars are staying pending investigation, Leslie and Austin leave indicating they will ask the neighbor for transportation, while SID searches.

Brenda meets Pope in the hallway learning Hart Phillips is waiting for his attorney who claims he is close; she is mad attorney Banks has taken so long to get his client's interview, certainly delaying the interview for a lame reason. Hart begins his story while constantly looking at his watch and asserting he was having an affair with Marta, particularly over the last two weeks. His story becomes harder to accept when claiming he dumped the body in the river. He states he paid Alejandro to bring Marta and her mother back from Mexico, like he did with the former housekeeper who got pregnant. He continues to fabricate his story by saying he panicked when Marta pulled away from him and slipped on the steps, justifying why he did not call the police or an ambulance. He wrapped her in a blanket, put her in his car and dumped her body in the river, thinking she would just float away. Brenda says the autopsy report said she regained consciousness when she hit the water. Hart says he could hear her screams but couldn't get to her before she hit the water. Brenda stands, leans over to Banks, shouting at him if he knowingly delayed getting to the interview, he is in trouble. He turns to Hart asking what that was all about? Brenda runs into the media room telling Pope that Marta was dead before she hit the water, indicating the story she just listened to was just that, a story to gain time for the real criminal to escape. She gets on her phone to Sgt. Gabriel to locate Austin Phillips. Brenda shouts to Pope, he kept us waiting in order to let his son Austin escape.

Lt. Tao informs Brenda Leslie Phillips has left for the border, first in her neighbor's car to the airport, then in a rental car via San Diego. Sgt. Gabriel brings back evidence Austin went on line to find registered sex-offenders, choosing Wayne Mathers, shown on Austin's laptop. Austin had Wayne picked out before LAPD arrived on the scene at the house. The police also found a car jack in Austin's car matching the scar left on Marta's face. Back in the interview room, Banks gets the brunt of Brenda's ire, stating he gave Hart need time to compose himself. Brenda corrects him, you mean time to compose a false confession. She shows Hart the picture of Marta, while he sets his terms for Austin to come back to the U.S. Brenda does not agree to his plan. Brenda to Hart, if I were you Mr. Phillips, I would spend little less time worrying about your son and spend time what I am going to do with you, as she firmly closes the interview room door.

Chief Johnson sits at Pope's desk telling him Leslie Phillips used her credit card to check in at a resort in Ensenada. Brenda requests Pope's help in getting to force a confession from Austin. Pope questions her uncanny ability where Brenda says he doesn't have the faith in her abilities as much as she does in her own. Getting a seventeen-year-old to confess to life imprisonment as opposed to life on the beach seems impossible but he is willing to let her try and hands her two bottles of Cuervo Gold as persuasion for the Federales. Brenda says the Mexican police have a better record with the FBI than the LAPD. Pope understands she is travelling with Agent Howard to Mexico, no escort required.

Brenda enters a room with Agent Howard, Austin Phillips and two Federales. Brenda introduces Austin to Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI. Austin asks for his lawyer. Brenda explains he is not entitled to legal counsel nor does he have the right to remain silent because he is not in the United States anymore. Brenda asks Austin to come with them back to the U.S., Agent Howard affirms he will charge Leslie Phillips with crimes keeping her in a Mexican prison for three years, surviving that, she will be transferred to an American prison where she will spend the next fifteen years. Brenda says your father will be charged with aiding his mother in helping you to escape to Mexico. Austin refuses to leave Mexico under any circumstances, even though Chief Johnson and Agent Howard state the money he thought was accessible isn't, your credit cards are frozen, there is no ATM access. No cash, no parents, no allowance, no hotel, there is a significant difference between visiting the beach and living on one. Austin shouts he is not leaving no matter what you say, referring to Brenda's deal.

Brenda bluffs a proposal with Fritz about letting the parents go free if Austin details what happened at his home with Marta. Brenda turns to Austin declaring freedom for his parents if he tells what happened. Austin asks then you'll unfreeze their assets? Brenda responds yes I will unfreeze their assets, but I want to hear the truth. Austin talks about Marta's behavior toward him, their getting to together in his father's study when his parents weren't home. I told her this is what meant to be my girlfriend, she went really quiet, running away, she fell down the stairs; it was an accident. Brenda interrupts saying it was no accident you went online to find a sex-offender pedophile you could blame. It is not an accident that Wayne Mathers is now dead because you did not want to be accused again for rape, it was no accident you dumped the body of the girl in the L.A. River. We found her DNA in the trunk of your car, I have evidence to prove it. Austin shouts at Chief Johnson, good for you, now you can leave. Brenda comes back with now you can stay.

Brenda shows an attending Federalé a birth certificate of the victim, Marta Alvarez, proving she was born in Mexico. Just your bad luck, I guess, because you sought sanctuary in the country of your victim. Brenda iterates to Austin Phillips, since you killed a Mexican national you can be tried here for your crime, the police don't like when a naturalized citizen, particularly a minor, is murdered, especially by someone outside of their country. Austin is led out screaming for his mother while she is restrained outside in the hallway.

Brenda uncaps the tequila bottle chugging a few ounces, Fritz says he guesses he is driving. They decide to stay the night. Sgt. Gabriel is shown herding Kitty's kittens, mentioning the Chief can relax, he will handle the home front."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542966/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,Brenda tangles with a meddling deputy D.A. as she investigates a butler's possible murder made to appear as suicide.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Tawnia McKiernan'],"['', '']",[],"['police', 'sibling rivalry']",[],"The Dutton driveway gate is locked, none of the siblings know the code for entry, Brenda arrives with a bench warrant for the Dutton butler, who is supposedly in the house but not responding. Gabriel explains to Brenda the Duttons are locked out of the home of their late father because of the will. Brenda pulls a patrol car up and parallel to the gate, gets on the hood and climbs over the barrier. Gabriel follows her inside the house, only to find the butler hanging out back on a rope from the flag pole, with the big ladder on its side lying nearby. Gabriel lets Provenza inside the yard with everyone else. The Duttons are staring at Albert, the butler, hanging just out of the rear entryway.

While Deputy D.A. Yates introduces himself to Brenda at the crime scene, he identifies the victim hanging from the flagpole as definitely Albert Turner. Yates came looking for Albert because he did not show up in court today. The body crashes to the floor of the foyer, and Brenda requests no one touch the body other than the coroner's staff, in view of the broken glass caused by the fall. Yates affirms he was trying Albert for the death of the former Mrs. Dutton, Angelina. Brenda quips, that seems like a waste of time. Chief Johnson invites attorney Bloom come by her office tomorrow afternoon and she needs Gabriel to request a quick autopsy, to determine the cause of death. She also wishes Lt. Provenza to secure the crime scene until the body is removed. Chief Johnson leaves with her familiar thank you all very much, saying so nice to meet you to DDA Yates.

Attorney Bloom is in Brenda's office informing her of his position in the Dutton family. Albert Turner was indicted for killing Mr. Dutton's widow. Bloom utters indicted, but not convicted. Bloom adds his entire practice exists solely to handle their affairs. Albert was on bail, taking care of the house, and Bloom also represented him. Bloom continues to reveal everyone hated Angelina Dutton. She changed the will, benefiting the Dutton children far less than were originally granted before the marriage. Albert was on an agreement to be taken care of for his life. Brenda queries Bloom, who do you think killed Angelina Dutton? Bloom leaves Brenda by snidely saying he would not want to speculate on that, but he and Albert spent their careers straightening out after the Duttons.

DDA Yates comes to Brenda's house stating they got off on the wrong foot the other day. Brenda shoots back with that was because it was in your mouth. Yates reveals he doesn't believe Albert Turner killed himself. He helps Brenda with the dirty kitchen by drying while she washes the dishes. Billionaire Roland Dutton fell in love and married a stripper, Angelina, who later died of an overdose. Yates insists he believes Albert never had any part of her death, he was just simply an easy target. Yates offered Bloom a deal for Albert, just wanting to know which of the Dutton children did it. Dennis Dutton has a history of violent behavior. Ten years ago, he beat his girlfriend with a golf club, going overseas until the best witness against him died in a car accident. Yates pleads for help from Brenda in finding the killer of Angelina and Albert. Deputy D.A. Yates blatantly apologizes to Brenda for his prior condescending behavior. His request includes getting the coroner to re-examine the body and determine Albert's death was not suicide.

Brenda watches Provenza's interview of Albert, the Lieutenant is proud to say the butler did it, but Brenda has Buzz rewind the tape to show a cane draped over the chair next to Albert in the interview room. Next, the coroner inspects the corpse closer to find a degenerative joint disease, arthritis severe enough to prevent him from ever climbing the ladder found at his hanging. Det. Gabriel and Chief Johnson receive news from Dr. Crippen upon further review he declares Albert Turner's a homicide. He couldn't possibly have carried out the suicide by carrying the ladder from the garage, drunk and on pain medication for his arthritic hip, hoisted himself up the ladder, tying himself to the flagpole with the rope and hanging himself.

Brenda's plan is to do a background check on the latest victim then call in the Dutton's for further questioning. Whatever reason they can find for inviting the Dutton children to HQ will be pursued. Deanna Dutton is picked up for possession of a controlled substance by Det. Daniels at a nightclub. Detective Sanchez and Officer Susanna Walsh pick up Delvin Dutton at a bar for solicitation of Sanchez while Walsh stands aside while the pair talk price. Delvin tries to pick up Sanchez and gets busted with Walsh cuffing him at the bar. At HQ, Brenda requests a complete financial check on Albert from Lt. Tao, when Attorney Bloom enters her office complaining she picked up the Duttons without allowing him to hear from them beforehand. Gabriel interrupts their conversation stating the reason they couldn't find Dennis Dutton because the District Attorney's office picked him up last night. She interrupts Yates while Dennis sits at the table in the D.A.'s office. Attorney Bloom arrives and scolds the D.D.A. and Brenda for holding Dennis. Yates asks Dennis where he was at the time of Albert's murder and he claims he was at home. Brenda demands to know how Dennis made a living while he was in Switzerland and Bloom explains he handles all the Dutton finances, providing all the children with an allowance.

As Deanna is vomiting in the toilet her attorney is asserting her alibi for killing Albert. Deanna was sequestered at a rehab in Malibu when the murder took place. Devlin sits in an interview room ask for Julio to interview him. Brenda summons Julio, the arresting officer, to join them in the interview room while his fellow officers watch. Devlin provides the name of the hustler he was with when Albert was murdered. Devlin also provides Brenda with financial information explaining where the money comes from to fund his reckless behavior and that of his sister's drug supply.

D.D.A. Yates shows Brenda pictures of Cristine Berringer, Dennis Dutton's former girlfriend, indicating the Dutton's don't take rejection very well. That picture was taken a few hours after she broke up with Dennis. Brenda has Yates exit promising to share information in the near future as she is getting signs her officers are finding information. Lt. Tao informs Brenda James Bloom has Dutton's endurable power of attorney to handle the Dutton's business affairs, he controls all the family finances, in fact he runs the company. Albert had an account opened by wire in Geneva two weeks after Angelina died; five million dollars held in certificate of deposits automatically renewed every ninety days, except it was reversed last Friday afternoon in the name of Dennis Dutton. Provenza announces he was wrong, he has the fingerprint analysis he hands Brenda; the ladder was wiped clean at Albert's place of death. Provenza quips, I doubt if he wiped the ladder clean after he was declared dead.

Gabriel enters declaring shots fired at the Dutton house. Brenda declares it her lucky day because she didn't know how she was going arrest the Dutton children again. In the Dutton house with attorney Bloom present, Brenda requests an explanation. The explanation doesn't work with all arguing amongst one another, so Brenda has them all arrested to be interviewed together, a group therapy session Brenda chides Bloom.

All the Dutton's are in the interview room with Bloom and Yates. Brenda assumes, in front of everyone, that whoever murdered Albert also murdered Angelina. Deanna was in rehab when Albert was murdered, however, a search of her house revealed a supply of Vicodin. Chief Johnson said we found Vicodin in Albert at the autopsy, which does allow for a prevailing conspiracy potential. Yates adds how do we know you did not share those pills with your brothers and they didn't drug Albert. Bloom insists he removed the supply of drugs from Deanna's house last month and the months before when he dropped her off at rehab, which he promises he will testify to in court. Brenda is satisfied, well that's good enough for me, Deanna, you can wait in the hallway. Devlin announces he has already proven he had an alibi, but Brenda comments you have said you had the gate passcodes, so you could get in and out. Why would Devlin kill the family butler, if Albert killed Angelina he obviously made the children fabulously rich, suggests Bloom. Brenda puts up another argument when Bloom declares Devlin did not have the passcodes, he stole the remote control when you found Albert's body. He gave the remote back to Bloom after Dennis shot at him. Yates probes Bloom, would you willing to swear to that in court as well? Bloom declares I would. Well then Devlin, you can wait in the hallway with your sister.

Brenda queries Dennis, where did the source of the five million dollars Dennis received by wire come from? Bloom explains after the incident with the former girlfriend, Dennis was never allowed access to any of the funds. Bloom signs a waiver for Brenda to validate the issuance of funds restricted by the will and controlled by Bloom. Well then, Mr. Dutton, would mind waiting outside for a moment please? Dennis compliments Bloom on a job well done. Yates speaks to Bloom, congratulations, once again you have helped a murderer go free. Brenda speaks to Deputy D. A. Yates, if you had been listening carefully, someone just confessed; why Mr. Bloom. Brenda speaks to Bloom, thanks to you, the Dutton children all have concrete unbreakable alibis and you were the only one left with the motive, means and opportunity. Yates looks at Bloom, my god, you took the drugs from Deanna's house, only you and Albert had the passcodes to the gate. Brenda adds, and you were the only one who could transfer funds in and out of Dennis' account. You signed this waiver for us to check the validity of the transfers. We discovered you gave Albert five-million dollars. That was an advance on his inheritance. Then why did you take it away? After Mr. Yates offered him a deal you transferred that money out of Albert's account and into one held by Dennis. And why would you have done that because you knew Albert was going to die.

Yates speaks to Bloom, Angelina was liquidating the company, hiring all new attorneys. You spent your entire life straightening up after the Duttons, always around the family, but never really a part of it, that's hard. Killing people, maybe a real Dutton could get away with murder, but not you. Now, you're a good attorney, you know what we're going to find. Yates declares, I am going to trace all of these cash transfers to and from Albert, right back to you. Aren't I James? Bloom is still standing and appeals to them; will you take the death penalty off of the table? Yates responds, if you confess to both murders right now? Bloom sits, reflects by saying, the only thing I really regret, is killing Albert, that was too bad, I'm going to miss him, but I'm really sorry I never got the opportunity to knock-off those horrible children. Is there a chance I could plead insanity?

As Brenda tidies up her office, Dennis Dutton stops by to trade quips, and Chief Johnson has the final word, be careful what you wish for Mr. Dutton."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542961/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,The investigation of the murder of a Middle Eastern businessman and his bodyguard is complicated by the FBI who believe the case to be related to terrorism.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Rick Wallace'],"['', '', '']",[],"['police', 'fbi']",[],"Brenda and Gabriel are seen driving on the way to a murder crime scene, when Sgt. Gabriel gets fed up with his boss's directions and inquiries as she squints to see anything. He stops the vehicle, gets out and returns with sun glasses for her. He explains this is L.A., the sun shines 329 days a year; that squint is not working for me. She likes the shades, indicated by her smile, as they head to their destination.

Priority Homicide officers with patrolmen are on the scene. Dr. Wm. Graham, whose smock is smeared with blood, is giving details to Sanchez when Brenda and Gabriel arrive. Iranian businessman Razi Moktari and his driver Jeffrey Sanders are found fatally shot in a parking garage. Det. Daniels updates Chief Johnson on the identity of the bodies on the garage slab. Lt. Provenza points out Layla Moktari is sitting in a black-and-white unit, and she speaks to women only, giving Det. Daniels her initial story of they were leaving her doctor's appointment and getting into their car when a black SUV driving by started shooting from the vehicle. Det. Daniels says Layla did not get a good look at the shooters driving by. Dr. Graham is Layla's physician and he was the first person seen when police arrived. Lt. Tao adds the husband was probably dead before he hit the pavement, as he demonstrates to Brenda details of the actual shooting. Lt. Provenza notes the gun in the hand of the bodyguard-driver, there is no evidence of him firing a shot. No evidence of casings left from the bodyguard, indicating all casing were from the shooter. Lt. Tao found eleven casings, he comments, possible a professional hit. Brenda issues assignments to her officers seeking more information of the scene, telling a patrolwoman to secure the parking garage, nobody in or out, until she says so. Two FBI agents roll up, Brenda greets them, they claim the purpose for their presence is to observe. They do refuse Lt. Provenza's effort to escort them away from the crime scene, as directed by Chief Johnson. Agent Jackson explains to Det. Gabriel he does not take orders from LAPD. After bumping Provenza to the ground, they back off to their vehicle, making it obvious they want something from the incident. Layla made mention to Daniels she feared the US Government was involved.

Taylor stops Pope in the hallway informing him of the FBI threatening to pull their people off six cases they are collaborating, namely a drug-gang sting because of Chief Brenda Johnson's recent actions. Pope is also informed by Brenda of the incident in the garage between Jackson and Provenza. Agent Jackson promises Pope and Brenda there will be an FBI liaison-agent assigned to them in order to share any information within national security parameters.

Security cameras were shut down at the time of the shooting per Gabriel, so identity of the alleged get-away vehicle is not available. The wires were cut from the security system, indicating the shooting was planned. Eleven confirmed casings were found at the scene, all from the shooter, and all forty-caliber. Sanchez informs the group of bodyguard Sanders being the real deal, with an unblemished service record together with a similar record in private practice. Lt. Tao identifies the type of weapon and Brenda assigns him and others to find any leads of other crimes with that weapon. Brenda learns Agent Howard is the newly assigned liaison officer, as he enters her office through the hallway door.

Agent Howard addresses Brenda's staff, providing them with lists of suspects, commenting to Brenda they are not the friendliest group I ever met. Brenda responds with they are slow to warm up. Chief Johnson and Agent Howard head out to visit with the wife and son at their palacious home. The house furnishings have been damaged when the FBI came to search the premises. An ambitious search was conducted as noted by the damaged furnishings. Layla conveys to Brenda the changes Iran experienced and how it affected them in LA. Agent Howard grills Layla's son, Faraz, while Brenda listens to his mother. Her daughter has asthma, aggravated from the dust rising from the recent FBI raid. Her name is Fatima and she is up in her room, resting.

Daniels confirms flight reservations were made for the daughter Fatima, and mother Layla, next week to Iran, no ticket for the father or son. Gabriel states no vehicle left ten minutes before nor after the shooting. Brenda responds then the car is still there. Gabriel is assigned to check all the cars in the garage and Brenda asks him to see Taylor for additional help with the search. While in Taylor's office, Gabriel gets the help of Lt. Flynn with the search of garage-vehicles, Flynn is assigned by Taylor. Tao shares internet information from a patriot site on a suspect with Agent Howard. Brenda tells Fritz they picked him up fifteen minutes ago. Brenda tells Fritz she knows the two million dollars belongs to the government, and given to Moktari to be traced by an FBI middleman, and now it can't be found. Brenda insists there is no evidence to date on Moktari, otherwise he would have been arrested long before he was gunned down.

Dr. Graham exits the interview room, greets Layla, introducing himself from their garage encounter. Layla and her son enter the media room to view a lineup, conducted by the FBI. She does not recognize anybody. Fritz excuses them from the room, when mother and son pause to argue, trading slaps across one another's cheek. Brenda has Buzz record their conversation, as mother and son are separated. They all gather in Pope's office, asking Layla if she wants to press charges. She declines, wanting to go home with her son, who has a temper like his father.

Brenda interviews suspect Craig Sherman, who says he committed the killings, also stating he left in his vehicle afterward. This fact makes Brenda know he is not the killer, just a zealous storyteller, a person simply looking for publicity. Something he said perplexes Brenda, he said things better than they actually happened. There is a physical review of the shooting with Tao placing rods in the two dummies as Provenza pretends he is firing a gun using his hand. Brenda asks everyone why the bodyguard did not get off a single shot during the shooting. Tao and Brenda examine the bodyguard's gun, finding the firing pin was altered with superglue, preventing the gun from firing. Sanders would not have noticed the gun was altered. He would have to take the gun apart to find the change to the firing pin. Whoever did the shooting knew they would not have to concern themselves with the bodyguard. Tao inputs, who had access to that weapon?

A policeman interpreting the son's conversation has him saying he will be alright, you will go home where the air is pure for Fatima, and the people are pure for you. I found father's money, I will look after myself. Gabriel and Flynn enter the media room with Gabriel informing Brenda there are no fingerprints nor blowback on any of the vehicles. Chief Johnson orders Gabriel to release the crime scene, thanking the Sgt. and Lt. Flynn, adding, we will try a new tack on the car in the morning.

Chief Johnson enters her office where Jackson and Pope are standing and Fritz is sitting. Jackson responds to her inquiry about Mrs. Moktari's son being located in a place where Agent Jackson says he is not at liberty to say; he is the son of a terrorist with a lot of money and we need to get it back. Brenda addresses Agent Jackson, although your lack of respect for my professional ability is obvious, I would like to share an observation with you. I think physical torture of people is an unreliable means of extracting information from someone. Pope returns fire with removing a murder suspect is hardly what we agreed to earlier. Jackson comes back with knowing her son is in custody might be incentive for Mrs. Moktari to tell us what she knows. An observant Islamic woman is more like to talk to me than she is to you, Brenda shoots back. Jackson leaves Brenda's office, Chief Brenda quips, so if I can't get Mrs. Moktari to tell me who the killer is, they are going to beat the information of the kid? Both Fritz and Brenda mention they have equally strong feelings for one another and Agent Howard says he is officially removed from the case tomorrow morning. Fritz adds, that is why she is better off finishing this investigation on her own. Brenda responds I appreciate that. Before you finish up your paperwork, I have a favor to ask. If I am expected to get Mrs. Moktari to flip on her son, I need to have something the FBI seized. Get me the daughter's prescription out of the FBI evidence. Pope tells Agent Jackson having a mother give up her son might be a little too much to ask, even for Brenda. Jackson comments we'll settle for knowing where the money got to. They watch the interview together with Layla and Dr. Graham. Gabriel joins them in the media room.

Layla is in the interview room and now joined by Dr. Graham with Chief Johnson. Brenda explains that you two were the only ones to last see the murderer escape, so it would be of great help for some more information. Brenda had one of her best officer's search for that SUV, when it dawns on her, there wasn't one; it didn't exist, there was no get-away car. You two just met one another yesterday, yet it is strange the two of you telling the exact same lie. Then I thought maybe they're just pretending to be strangers. You told me your daughter has asthma and Dr. Graham is a pulmonary specialist; he treats lung disorders. I found your daughter's prescription, and the attending physician is Dr. Graham. The doctor tells Layla it would be better for me to handle this, we want a lawyer.

Brenda responds, if you want a lawyer, I'm handing this over to the FBI, and they have Faraz, I think they might have taken him to Egypt. Layla gasps at the thought of her son gone and in another country. Brenda tells Graham to be silent or be placed under arrest for murder. Layla says she waives her right to counsel. Brenda speaks, someone tampered with this gun, and with your answer, you could be deciding who lives and who dies. Layla screams he wasn't sending me back to Iran, he was sending me back to the 17th century. Brenda requests Layla to tell me what happened. Layla details the crime, stating we planned it on my doctor visit. William cut the wires to the security cameras, and as we were leaving, coming out of the elevator, he walked over to Razi and fired the gun; he then put it in his pocket. He was only trying to save me. Chief Johnson responds to Layla's tearful lament, I am sure you wouldn't have a problem convincing a jury of that. Brenda pauses to mention, what about Jeffrey Sanders, an innocent man killed so you would not leave any witnesses. Agent Jackson walks in with a Federal Warrant for Layla Moktari and would consider it a personal favor if you would turn the doctor over to me as well. Brenda complies.

Agent Howard enters Chief Johnson's office stating to her, they handed Layla over to the CIA. Brenda says they'll send her back to Iran; a rare intelligence asset on the ground. Fritz says we got Dr. Graham. Brenda responds, on a plea deal; probably sign a confidentiality agreement, serve time for manslaughter. The husband is killed and an innocent man was gunned down in the process. She could have just filed for divorce instead. I can't think of a single culture where that is the right way for a woman to gain her independence. So, did you find your money? Razi had half of it, the rest of it is gone, Agent Howard answers Brenda's question. The two leave with Fritz taking Brenda out to dinner."

Meanwhile, Captain Taylor makes a fateful decision about supporting one of his men.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Gloria Muzio'],"['', '', '']",[],"['african american female detective', 'african american woman']",[],"The episode opens in the morgue, with camera fixed on the examination table. The medical examiner identifies the body in front of him as Lisa Barnes, the victim of meth-amphetamine induced heart failure, found dead at eleven this morning. Presumed to have been the victim three years ago of a serial killer named Bill Croelick, who is on death row for killing her. Taylor tries convincing Pope into ignoring the body of Lisa Barnes which they are standing over in the morgue as the person presumed dead at the hands of Croelick. Taylor to Pope, we misidentified this victim and Pope says what's the alternative? Taylor suggests in Pope's face, do us a favor, send this girl to the crematorium as a Jane Doe, keep Croelick in prison, don't damage the reputation of our department. Pope returns with here is the favor I am going to do for you, I am going to forget you said that. Chief Johnson enters, Pope begins an explanation of events from three years ago with a murder victim, he then hands the update over to Lt. Flynn, the officer on the case. Flynn tells Brenda, Miss Barnes identified through dental records. The medical examiner recaps that the body on the table is Lisa Barnes, dead as of eleven this morning from meth-amphetamine heart failure. The problem is the wrong body mistaken for Lisa, and Bill Croelick is on death row for killing Lisa Barnes; a trial happening some three years ago. Brenda probes, so, who did Bill Croelick kill? Pope counters that is what we need Priority Homicide to find out, before we have him released.

A forthcoming procedure spread by Pope for Brenda in Pope's office. Croelick's method of killing was making certain there was little evidence available for conviction. As Flynn put it earlier, he barbequed his victims. Pope says he cut off her hands and feet, set her on fire twice, pushed her off a cliff in a car. Brenda gives a, sounds thorough. Chief Johnson summarizes for Pope, to arrest Croelick again, we must connect him to the young lady he murdered, and we may have only forty-eight hours before he walks. Pope finishes providing Brenda with information about Croelick, summing she is his type, namely blond.

Brenda is at the murder board having Deputy D.A. Powell explain her part in the trial of Bill Croelick. Brenda directs her comments to Deputy D.A. Powell, please explain some of the mistakes made, start with the body we found yesterday. Powell chronicles Lisa Barnes' last years with her meth habit and Flynn adds what he discovered since it was his case at the time which brought Croelick to justice and eventually prison. Brenda adds, of what you thought was Lisa Barnes. Did you run the dental records through the missing persons database? Powell answers no. Flynn holds up Lisa's driver's license found at the scene, through dental records we identified the victim as Lisa Barnes. Brenda orders Lt. Tao to collects all the files of missing female victims at the time of the crime. Powell mentions Dr. Nelson Graydon did the work-up on the forensics, he is the only forensic dentist in L.A. County. Brenda orders Det. Gabriel to get Dr. Graydon to come in to HQ. Flynn tells Brenda about Anna Tandy, a similar victim from 2000, also his case, and like Lisa, blond and petite. Anna died in much the same way Lisa was, presumed to be Lisa. Powell says there was a witness to Anna's death, and Croelick confessed to the witness he killed Anna, but the witness died before it went to trial. Four days into the trial, the witness overdosed. Left to Powell was a lot of circumstantial data, and a deposition from Dr. Easton, who did Croelick's psych evaluation. Easton interjects his testimony was on the part of Lisa Barnes, not a part of this inquiry. Croelick's acquittal made us sick, states Powell. With Lisa Barnes, it was a chance to finally get him. Provenza chimes in with Dr. Easton had two chances to interview Croelick. Brenda inquires with Dr. Easton, do you think Croelick killed our Jane Doe? Easton says yes, based on the similarities of each crime. Moved to Brenda's office, Easton tells they found his fingerprints on a stainless-steel lighter found at the scene. Easton describes Croelick as borderline sociopath, knows the difference between right and wrong, smart. Easton concludes by elucidating Croelick's family upbringing, making it cringeworthy in his detail. Every woman Croelick ever dated was like his mother, blond, suffering a horrible death at the hands of his father, according to Easton.

Brenda meets Bill Croelick, exchanges artificial pleasantries, while the media room learns he has waived his rights. She excuses the officers standing in with a chained convict, saying she thinks it would be fine one-on-one. Brenda iterates you plead not-guilty three years ago murdering Lisa Barnes, and it turns out you were telling the truth. Brenda requests Bill tell who did die in that accident three years ago, promising to erase the capital conviction, dropping the death penalty. Bill responds with why should he answer any of her inquiries, when he leaves a free man in twenty-eight hours. Brenda departs the room after Croelick makes a point to ascertain she is not too far from assistance.

Brenda greets Roy and Kim Barnes stating she is the bearer of some unique news. Mr. Barnes, your first wife Lisa is dead, again. Brenda says Lisa, found yesterday, dead from a drug-overdose, is news to Roy. We already have a positive identification of the body, we don't need you to see her again. Brenda adds Roy was still married three years ago, the death certificate I hold is more current, and accurate, than the one you signed. Please sign this document for us to swap dead girls. Roy signs the document acknowledging Lisa's recent death. Brenda tells him she wishes she could identify the person he thought was Lisa years ago; she cannot for now.

Dr. Crippen has the body formerly known as Lisa Barnes on the morgue-table with Chief Johnson and Sgt. Gabriel standing by looking at the charred bones. Brenda solicits the M.E. for his help in identifying the body by looking at the remaining teeth. He hands the remaining teeth to Sgt. Gabriel.

Dr. Easton shows Brenda what he had to work with based on dental records and a few remaining teeth from the victim. There is a marked difference between the x-rays of the current victim and those from three years ago. Brenda takes the jar of remaining teeth, thanking Easton she would like a second opinion identifying the teeth in hand. She gives the jar to Agent Howard for analysis and identification rather than rely on the results of unreliable Dr. Grayson. Brenda hands Fritz forty files of missing-women and the jar, hoping he can get a match via FBI forensics. Brenda is asking Agent Fritz Howard to identify the remains of the charred dental work from the person formerly buried as Lisa Barnes. Det. Gabriel informs Chief Johnson she has a visitor, it is Bill Croelick dropping in to say good-bye, he says he cannot talk now, his attorney is waiting for him downstairs. He exits while watched by officers and patrolmen.

Taylor is in Pope's office ranting about Chief Johnson not getting Croelick to give up information. Taylor invites Pope to demote Chief Johnson, allowing the LAPD to get what everybody wants, Croelick back in prison. The proposed demotion will send a message throughout LAPD, per Taylor. Pope mentions Flynn got his promotion off this case, do you think he is creating the evidence? Pope says he is interested in getting this current case solved.

Doctors Easton and Graydon both are demanding police protection from Croelick who has called identifying himself to each and threatening their families. Brenda requests their requested police protection from Bill Croelick. Lt. Flynn declined his protection, saying he could take care of himself, referencing his holstered weapon as plenty of protection.

Croelick surprises Brenda on her front porch, she points her gun at him while calling Det. Gabriel for assistance; I have located Croelick, he is on my porch. Bill says his attorney called him stating the police were looking for him. He claims his accusers framed him. Killed and burned to death was Anna Tandy, using an accelerant of grain alcohol down her throat, according to Bill, but the unidentified girl burned recently, not treated in that manner. Police arrive to haul Croelick away. Brenda looks spellbound after Croelick mentions the lighter found at the scene of the recent murder and the use of the accelerant being absent.

Both Brenda and Crippen stare at the burnt corpse, swapped from the grave of Lisa Barnes. Dr. Crippen, the Medical Examiner, declares the Jane Doe in front of them, is an example of lungs not exploding, however, Anna Tandy, the girl from a few years ago, her lungs exploded. Brenda requests he take-a- peek inside, but Crippen says, tell me Chief Johnson, where do you see an inside? They are looking at a partial charred corpse, hands and feet removed.

Fritz enters Brenda's office with a file, Brenda grabs the file inquiring is this my Jane Doe? Referring to the missing dentist, he may have skipped town, nowhere found. Fritz states, I promise that's your girl, first reported missing June 2002. Brenda declares, she looks almost exactly like Lisa Barnes. Moving into the murder room, Brenda announces, let's hope this girl rings a bell with someone. Dr. Easton blurts out, her name is Samantha Jones, she is chapter eight in my book, I testified at her rape trial. Brenda inquires, and who was the arresting officer in the case? Flynn acknowledges by nodding.

Flynn, Taylor and Brenda are in Pope's office, Pope enters his office demanding to know what is this all about? Explain it to me, Croelick has nothing to do with this Samantha Jones, at all? Some other scumbag raped Samantha, and we had a hell of time getting her to testify against Croelick; the woman was unstable, you ask some of these chicks about it, and they would rather be murdered than sexually assaulted. Samantha said that, it is in Easton's records. Some women cannot deal with rape, when she disappeared, we all thought she had committed suicide. Chief Johnson chimes in with her conclusions. Well, I suppose she could have lifted Bill Croelick's stainless steel cigarette lighter, making sure his prints were still on it, made a copy of Lisa Barnes' license, stolen a car, pushed it off a cliff, chopping off her hands and feet while discarding them in route after setting fire to herself. Maybe she trained for her suicide at the Cirque due Soleil. It seems much more reasonable that she was murdered, and somebody planted the evidence, after the fact, doesn't it?

Taylor has his say stating it is possible this girl, Samantha, did commit suicide. It is possible that someone familiar with the Croelick case, wanting to put him away, could have planted the items. I just think Internal Affairs should investigate this whole situation. Pope enquires Brenda, you agree? Brenda answers no, no I don't, not yet. I would like to have a private discussion with Lieutenant Flynn, if you don't mind.

Brenda confronts Flynn in her office, declaring if you want to keep your job and your rank, you better be straight with me, without all the usual crap I have to take from you. Three years ago, Samantha Jones, a rape victim was murdered, in the same way Bill Croelick kills his victims. Flynn adds, looks that way. She was the same weight, height and color as another rape victim, Lisa Barnes, a drug-addict, living on the streets. Flynn agrees the two women looked alike. I don't know if someone wanted to frame Bill Croelick or someone wanted us to think Lisa Barnes was dead or someone wanted us to misidentify Samantha Jones. Brenda asserts someone planted Lisa's driver's license on the scene. Did you do that Lieutenant? Did you tamper with the evidence because you saw a promotion in your future? Flynn stands, looking Chief Johnson in the eyes, saying no. I had an audit of your investigation, eight print packages came back from the crime scene. All but one of those packages went to the courthouse, why the one? It arrived late, the case was over. The prints were partials and palm prints, it didn't matter, states Flynn. Brenda adds, you mean they didn't match Bill Croelick's. There were palm prints on the car? A direct order issued to Lt. Flynn to get the taillight of that car and the other set of prints. You're not going to move to have me investigated? No; get me the print packages off that car, please; thank you. Brenda exits her office though the back door while Lt. Flynn looks bewildered.

Gabriel is with Roy and Kim Barnes, suggesting they have the right to remain silent, why don't you use it? She is in one interview room and Roy follows Gabriel to another room. Brenda explains to Dr. Easton, here is what I think is plausible, but that's not where I would like to be, going into an interview. Doctor you will be wearing an earpiece when you interview these people.

Everyone wanted us to think it was Lisa who died in that car, she had been missing for a long time, she was a drug addict; it is possible she was dead. With Roy's first wife declared legally dead, he can marry the second time. What I want to know if Roy or Kim or the two of them could plan a murder this complex. Most important thing, I need you to have him grab a glass of water and leave it in the room when they go. Can you do that? I need to get their palm prints, but I need to do it legally. When someone leaves their glass behind deliberately, that means they don't consider it theirs legally, and can take the prints off it, even if I don't have probable cause to ask for it. I will be right in your ear trying hard not to bother you.

Gabriel enters the media room saying they each declined counsel, saying they were both innocent and it was too expensive.

Easton greets Roy Barnes. Roy says I remember you, you're a psychiatrist. You testified at Lisa's trial.

Easton tells Roy, there is a thought you might have murdered Samantha because she looked like Lisa, and you thought that Lisa was dead. Easton drinks his glass of water, palming the glass as he lifts it. Roy does the same as he drinks from his water glass. Roy says I gave up looking for her long before she turned up dead. Easton invites Roy if he wants to take his water, he declines, as Easton leads him out of the room; both water glasses left on the table as the two men exit. Lt. Tau enters the empty room wearing latex gloves, taking Easton's glass.

Brenda to Easton through the earpiece, I have a couple of questions before you go into see Kimberly. The murderer had to be someone who knew exactly how Croelick kills his victims and someone who knew how to manipulate Croelick into picking up his stainless-steel cigarette lighter, so it could be dropped later at the crime scene. Kind of like you manipulated Roy into picking up his glass just now. Someone who knew Bill Croelick smoked a lot, someone who knew how he operated, like the way he moved with Anna Tandy.

Easton enters the empty interview room noticing the glass missing was his, not Roy's; Tau is inspecting the print from Easton's glass and Tau tells Brenda the print is good, we got a match. Brenda reminds Easton of the palm print on the back of the car Samantha Jones was in when you pushed her off the cliff. I warned you doctor, don't leave the glass behind, and you abandoned it. You were the only one who said Miss Jones was suicidality depressed; Brenda reads Easton his Miranda rights. Easton runs, but stopped by an angry Lieutenant Flynn. Easton demands an attorney and Provenza says he will get him a phone book.

Taylor meets up with Flynn, saying well, that's one arrest that's really going to cost her. Flynn returns with you want to gloat to someone you're close to? Grab a mirror, Captain. I'm applying for permanent transfer to her squad.

Croelick meets Chief Johnson in the HQ parking lot. Imagine Dr. Easton having an affair with a rape victim then murdering her just to keep it quiet, what a monster, wouldn't you say? Brenda answers him, I don't believe in monsters."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542964/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,"Captain Taylor makes his move against Brenda, meaning she must juggle concerns of an I.A. investigation with solving the murder of a famous producer.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Michael M. Robin'],[''],[],"['african american female detective', 'african american woman']",[],"Priority Homicide is called to a Hollywood home where a naked man is draped over the edge of an outdoor poolside hot tub, face down, bottom torso in the water. Loud music is playing, a liquor bottle is present, a wet robe is in a nearby chair and Lieutenant Provenza is giving orders to his fellow officers in his best Chief Johnson exaggerated southern voice. The orders include SID be called to the scene, secure a background check on the victim, identify any fingerprints on the bottle, summon neighbor calling into police and get an estimated time of death. As he is issuing his directives, Brenda congratulates him on his choice of excellent ideas.

Detective Sanchez informs the Chief the victim's name is Dick Pruitt, Hollywood producer, found alone in his present state. Detective Daniels brings the neighbor over to talk, Pruitt's wife and son moved out yesterday according to Daniels. Lieutenant Tao assesses the use of alcohol in the hot tub, giving the tequila to SID, Brenda picks up the wet robe, smelling like chlorine. Brenda begins her directions for the officers, find the spouse, I would like to talk with her, I'm surprised she is not around, identify any prints from the cd player, Lieutenant Flynn is requested to do the honors at the morgue and Lt. Provenza to get the hair piece to SID.

Pope hands Captain Taylor an internal anonymous complaint issued regarding Chief Johnson's working with the District Attorney's office and the FBI. Taylor feigns surprise at the complaint declaring how serious the document could be while Pope wishes it be made to disappear. Pope informs the Captain if there is any complicity in the charges being brought to IA then Captain Taylor could be brought forward to IA, also; assuming he had a hand in the complaint. Pope advises the Captain he will be acting on the complaint straight-away.

The murder room meeting yields information on Dick Pruitt's arrest record including DUI's and a wife refusing to press charges after being assaulted by him, the autopsy report from Lt. Flynn found water in the lungs, he did not cook, he drowned, with a BAC of 0.16. Detective Daniels announces the toupee evidences there might have been a struggle, for it was expensive and was not easily removed. The water saturation indicates he was in the hot tub for at least three hours. Brenda needs the finger prints on the cd player be secured, the know-it-all neighbor will be visited again and I plan on seeing the spouse at her parent's residence, her father is a concert pianist, according to Det. Sanchez.

Brenda summons Gabriel to accompany her, but beforehand, meets Pope at the elevator asking when he was going to tell her about the anonymous complaint. Pope says he never planned on telling her, he was trying to make it simply go away, as it reflects badly on him as well. Brenda looks at him, iterating conduct unbecoming. Pope summarizes, it is in my hands, go solve your case. He gets on the elevator while Sgt. Gabriel stands off, but within earshot.

Brenda sits at the dining table with Pruitt's wife, Amelia Pruitt, her mother, Delia Lopez, her father Alonzo Lopez, guest Dennis Burke and Sgt. Gabriel. Amelia is at her parent's home since she left her house days ago, Dennis Burke, Alonzo's master student, claims they were all dining when the incident happened with Mr. Pruitt. Amelia doesn't know what the argument with her husband the other night was about, as Brenda questions her, seeing the bruising around her neck and wrists. The Lopez's wish to be alone after this initial questioning. Brenda excuses herself and Sgt. Gabriel, they exit the house, in the driveway, Brenda mentions murderers need air-tight alibis, while Gabriel seems to think Amelia has one.

Deputy D.A. Powell and FBI Agent Jackson are in Pope's office discussing Chief Johnson's competency versus her dismissive attitude. If IA were to contact you regarding Chief Johnson, Pope enquires, your concerns her intra-agency relations are considered bad. Pope proposes a meeting with the two individuals and Captain Taylor, since he is the anonymous source.

Sandy DeCourt, Dick Pruitt's agent, is there to be interviewed by Brenda, per Lt. Flynn. Sandy is very open about her client's behavior, saying he played around, and she would have killed him too, if she was in love with him, but she wasn't. She got dismissed by him recently, no specific reason, so she could be a suspect. While she is talking to Brenda about her former boss, Gabriel is in the media room inquiring about the IA complaint which everyone knows was Taylor's doing. Sandy says Amelia did it, she says I know she did it.

Back in the murder room Provenza and Sanchez cannot believe Amelia could have killed Pruitt, hold him under water until drowning. Daniels wants to show Sanchez how she could do it while the other officers observe. Daniels is behind Sanchez with his feet below him, in a sitting position, he is able to stand with her on his back, but Daniels proves it with Sanchez's feet up, level on a chair; he cannot stand up. Amelia possibly could have accomplished the task with him relaxing with his feet elevated in the tub. Pruitt's feet show marks on them as Brenda held up a photo, indicating he struggled causing the abrasions on his heels. Flynn takes a call from the neighbor. Brenda says she will go visit him at his home. Where is Sgt. Gabriel? Provenza volunteers to go with Brenda.

Gabriel is in Taylor's office declaring he would tell IA the charges against his boss are small-mined, petty and malicious; he is ashamed of whoever may have filed them. The charges further make him sick to his stomach and you will excuse me Captain, I am investigating a murder. Taylor tried to play the role of the aggressor, but Gabriel leaves him speechless as the Sergeant exits.

Pruitt's neighbor, Mr. Mitchell, says the argument he heard was with the girlfriend, overhearing how she worked on the recent project, how she was too expensive for what she did, identifying her DMV picture Provenza shows him. Mr. Mitchell identified her car as well, saying that was her in the picture. Mitchell also said the gardener was present that evening, he saw the truck. Interviewing the gardeners proved neither could understand English, likely eliminating them when they chose to invoke counsel. Sanchez asked them questions in Spanish evidently eliminating them as suspects.

Pope meets Brenda in her office informing her of the planned meeting in his office. She will be there as scheduled, after listening to all his scenarios. Essentially she is expected to apologize to all three, promising to do better, where IA will turn to Taylor exposing his accusation as frivolous.

Chief Johnson and Sergeant Gabriel have been waiting in the Lopez residence for twenty minutes, Brenda enters the den where Dennis Burke is playing the piano. He replays the works he just completed by touching the control on a recording device attached just below the keyboard. Brenda and Gabriel witness the device and hear firsthand what it is capable of doing. Dennis uses the piano when he cannot secure a practice piano at school. He speaks very highly of the family and reflects on exactly where everybody was in the house the evening of the murder. Alonzo retired to the piano room to practice for an upcoming concert, Delia Lopez took her husband in a plate of food leaving Dennis to be with Amelia. Amelia was not in the mood to chat, going upstairs to her room. They continue to probe where everybody was with Dennis answering questions, when Delia enters vouching for her daughter being up in her room. Delia summarily dismisses Brenda and Gabriel threatening harassment charges. Brenda mentions you will have to take a number and she leaves with the Sergeant. At the car, Brenda comments the subway would have allowed sufficient time to commit the murder and attend the concert.

Lt. Tao goes over the train schedules while referring to a map. Lt. Flynn describes the unlikelihood of backtracking from the trains to the Pruitt house. Provenza brings up the truck reported parked near the Pruitt's; college students drive such trucks. Lt. Tao mentions the cd player did not have any prints on it, it was wiped clean, maybe it was brought to the scene. Brenda invites Tao secure the footage of the security cameras of the subways around the time before the murder and after. Let's look for such a truck parked in one of our subway stations and include the impound lots. Brenda has Provenza and Flynn retrace the train travel routes including a car-drive to the Pruitt house.

Brenda takes time to clearly state how she will attend the meeting tomorrow regarding the complaint about her and she has enjoyed working all the people in the room. Interrogating people, getting to the truth and knowing the right thing to do politically are two very different things. In fact, to do either of them very well, you pretty much have to ignore the other. Brenda interjects that she might not be here tomorrow after the meeting, and she compliments every one of the officers how great it has been working with them. She leaves for the evening. Provenza says the smart move is to not get involved until the dust settles. Flynn fires back, that is the smart move, what is your idea? Provenza grins.

Brenda is likely thinking of the long day ahead while sitting at her desk when Lieutenant Tao enters with pictures from the surveillance cameras, there was a truck found in the impound lot taken from a subway station lot and a cap found in the truck matching that worn by the subject in the pictures. Thank you Lieutenant Tao, have Sgt. Gabriel meet me outside of Pope's office, I am going to have to speed out of here like the wind. Tao comments we are pulling for you Chief. Thank you Lieutenant, that means a lot.

Brenda enters Pope's office, Chief Pope, I want to thank you for arranging this meeting. Brenda to Deputy D.A. Powell, I would like to start with you Miss Powell. I'd like to say how sorry I am, that I was unable to ignore your general level of incompetence in the wrongly obtained conviction in the case of Bill Croelick and I am sorry if you felt hurt and defensive about putting a man on death row for the wrong crime. I certainly hope that will never ever, ever happen again. Brenda turns to FBI Agent Jackson. Agent Jackson, I deeply regret that the FBI handed over two million dollars to a man on the terrorist watch list without the capacity to trace it or manage to follow him for months without knowing his wife was having an affair with her doctor; and, I hope you do much better in the future. Brenda to Captain Taylor, Captain Taylor, I suppose I should apologize to you for not having been born in Los Angeles, but having seen your work up close now for several months, I can honestly say that, try as I might, I can't think of any fair and reasonable system on earth where I wouldn't outrank you. I hope that clears everything up. Thank you very much. Pope smiles discretely, well, she did say she was sorry. Brenda leaves Pope's office.

Chief Johnson is at the Lopez residence, Amelia answers the door, Brenda orders her to stand aside or Sgt. Gabriel will escort you downtown. Gabriel puts Dennis Burke in his place, with I suggest you step aside. Brenda moves to the studio, blocked by Delia Lopez. After asking her who she was with when her son-in-law was drowned in his hot tub, Brenda exclaims exactly no one, looking to Sgt. Gabriel, arrest Delia Lopez for the murder of Richard Pruitt. Stay inside Mr. Lopez, I need you to make a choice who you're protecting with this alibi of yours. Brenda and Alonzo step inside the studio, Brenda closes the door, he says my daughter is a victim herself, can't you see that? My wife is not a murderer.

Brenda gets the truth from Alonzo. I know she was here, referencing his daughter, but where were you? Pictures blown up to show him getting on the subway near his house, wearing the cap found in the truck, he is pictured getting off the train at Western and Hollywood, pictured coming home from his son-in-law's house, his clothes damp from drowning Richard Pruitt and finally a pic coming home as fast as you can, riding the escalator at the subway station. Brenda dumps the cap from an envelope, stating here is the cap you bought from a used-car dealer off Melrose. Alonzo picks the first photo claiming it is not me, I was here playing the whole time. Brenda begs to differ, pushing the play button on the recorder attached to the piano, music playing. Brenda directs you didn't keep Dennis around here for Amelia, you kept him around for yourself. Dennis was stalled at the dinner table so he could say he heard you playing in the next room. Your wife came in with a plate of food, restarted your program while you were gone, making Delia an accessory to murder. Brenda's phone shows Pope is calling, she reads Alonzo his rights declaring he is under arrest for the murder of Dick Pruitt. Brenda prompts him if he would waive those rights, leaving his wife free of involvement, leaving her surprised he was not in the room when she bought the food into him. Alonzo consents, he says yes to waiving his rights, so his wife could visit him in prison. I do waive my right to an attorney, my wife and daughter are not involved. I murdered that filth who beat my daughter. I protected my family like animals are allowed to do, as I have the right to do.

Pope is speaking from his office directly to Taylor, it doesn't make any difference what Jackson and Powell said; there's a limit to what the Chief cares about that. Taylor thinks he is not alone on looking at all grievances, but Pope reaches into to his briefcase with proof to the contrary. In it are transfer-request-papers from all officers in Priority Homicide declaring they want out of the division if Chief Johnson is put somewhere else or worse. Now if some one wants to be responsible for getting rid of some of the finest officers picked for Priority Homicide in the first place, I guess I can't stop them. If the Chief decides this was a colossal waste of our time and resources, there will be serious repercussions. If, on the other hand, this complaint was to suddenly disappear, low I am to suggest it, there is a promotion available. Taylor finally looks toward Pope, saying Commander Scotts position. Pope adds, one rank below Deputy Chief, any chance you might be interested? Captain Taylor perks up, grinning.

Sgt. Gabriel is clearing the murder board with Lt. Tao, Buzz is nearby, Pope is in Brenda's office handing her the transfers, obviously not to be honored as she remains in her position. Brenda exits her office, grabs the wastebasket, walks in front of the murder board, so, we have a summation of a case to write. She begins assigning tasks to the officers. She calls their names from the papers before discarding them, one by one, in the wastebasket. Pope passes by noticing all is back to plan in the murder room.

Brenda finishes by saying if you want, Chief Pope tells me at the conclusion of a successful case you all gather at O'Malley's to celebrate, so if you would like, I want to buy you all drinks; everybody agrees. Brenda retires to her office, shuts the blinds and enjoys a chocolate treat."

Pike is held prisoner and tested by aliens who have the power to project incredibly lifelike illusions.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Robert Butler'],[''],[],"['teleportation', 'illusion', 'torture', 'picnic', 'horse', 'pilot episode with missing cast', 'pilot episode has different cast', 'slavery', 'psionic power', 'prison', 'telepathy', 'hell', 'star trek', 'female lieutenant', 'meteorite', 'distress signal', 'transporter room', 'clipboard', 'martini', 'glass beaker', 'shipwide announcement', 'exoplanet', 'beaker', 'landing party', 'battle axe', 'shield', 'morning star the weapon', 'human versus alien', 'ball and chain flail', 'counting down', 'hostile alien', 'goggles', 'knoll', 'enclosure', 'human alien fight', 'sword', 'screaming in pain', 'rescue attempt', 'vial', 'punishment', 'prisoner', 'man in pain', 'reference to adam and eve', 'sugar cube', 'thermos', 'nourishment', 'orion slave girl', 'six member team', 'alien plant', 'camp']",[],"The USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter), receives a radio distress call from the fourth planet in the Talos star group. A survey expedition on the ship SS Columbia had been reported missing from Talos system 18 yrs ago. Spock (Lenord Nemoy) argues that the crew of the ship may have survived on the 4th planet (which is a class M with an oxygen atmosphere) even after 18 yrs. A message from Talos indicates that there are 11 survivors. The Enterprise has a crew of 203. Pike is tired of making life and death decisions for his crew on a daily basis. He considers resigning from his post. A landing party is assembled and beamed down to investigate. Tracking the distress signal to its source, the landing party discovers a camp of survivors from a scientific expedition that has been missing for eighteen years. Amongst the survivors is a beautiful young woman named Vina (Susan Oliver).

Captivated by her beauty, Pike is caught off guard and is captured by the Talosians, a race of humanoids with bulbous heads who live beneath the planet's surface. Vina and the survivors suddenly disappear after Pike is lured away from the rest of his landing party. Pike is captured and taken underground, while the landing party is stranded on the surface of the planet. The landing party's weapons are not able to cut through the alien metal guarding the entry door. It is revealed that the distress call, and the crash survivors, except for Vina, are just illusions created by the Talosians to lure the Enterprise to the planet. The Talosians communicate telepathically and can read the primitive human minds. While imprisoned, Pike uncovers the Talosians' plans to repopulate their ravaged planet using him and Vina as breeding stock for a race of slaves.

The Enterprise uses power cannons to blast through the metal, but it wont budge. The crew knows that the survivors were illusions and thus are not sure now if the metal they see in front of them are illusions or not.

The Talosians use their power of illusion to try to interest Pike in Vina, and present her in various guises and settings, first as a Rigellian princess, a loving compassionate farm girl, then a seductive, green-skinned Orion. Pike resists all forms. Vina is punished when she communicates to Pike and answers some of his questions.

After an earlier landing party failed to gain entry from the surface, six members of the Enterprise crew prepare to beam into the Talosians' underground complex, but only Pike's first officer and yeoman-both women-materialize in Pike's cell to offer further temptation. Vina is angry at her captors as she did everything they asked her. The first officer says that the Vina listed on the crashed spaceship was an adult and that was 18 yrs ago. By then, however, Pike has discovered that primitive human emotions can block the Talosians' ability to read his mind, and he manages to escape to the surface of the planet along with the two members of his landing party. Pike captures one Talosian, when he tries to sneak into the cell to pick Pike's phasers. Pike guesses correctly that the phasers are working but the Talosians have created an illusion that they are not. Pike threatens the Talosian with death, if he doesn't help them escape. The first officer finds that they not being able blast through metal was also an illusion.

The Talosians confront Pike and his companions before they can transport back to the Enterprise. The captain tries to negotiate, but the first officer (Majel Barrett) sets her weapon on a build-up to overload. Pike and Vina move closer to her, agreeing with her preference for death rather than captivity. After all, as Vina explains, if the Talosians have even one human being, they might try again. This demonstration of fatal resolve confirms what the Talosians have been gleaning from the records they've accessed from the Enterprise's computers: The human race despises captivity far too much to be useful.

Despite their last hope having been proven unsuitable, the Talosians are not vengeful. They let the humans go. The first officer and yeoman beam up immediately, but Pike remains behind with Vina, urging her to leave with him. Vina explains that she cannot leave. An expedition had indeed crash-landed on Talos IV; Vina was the sole survivor, but was badly injured. The Talosians were able to save her, but as they had no understanding of human physiology or aesthetics at the time, she was left horribly disfigured. With the aid of the Talosians' illusions, she is able to appear beautiful and in good health, as much to herself as to any others.

Realizing that the continued Talosian illusion of health and beauty is necessary for Vina, Pike is ready to return to the Enterprise without her.

The Enterprise visits planet M-113 for routine medical examinations of the husband-and-wife (Robert Crater and Nancy) archaeological team stationed there. McCoy used to have a relationship with Nancy, ten years ago. Nancy appears to all 3 men of the landing party in 3 different forms. Nancy lures Darnell, a member of Kirk's landing party away, seducing him. Robert comes to meet McCoy and Kirk. Robert asks for more salt to be sent to the planet due to its heat.

McCoy talks about how Nancy has no gray hair and Kirk thinks its his affection for Nancy talking, to him Nancy appears of a normal age. They hear Nancy screaming and find Darnell dead. Nancy claims that Darnell died by eating a local plant species which was poisonous. Nancy has been replaced by a shape-shifting creature forced to survive by extracting the salt from the bodies of members of the crew, killing them. Kirk beams back up with McCoy and Darnell. A proper check reveals Darnell has no salt in his body. He is curios as both Nancy and Robert specifically wanted salt tablets to be supplied. Spock is the logical Vulcan. Uhura is a passionate lady.

Nancy shape shifts into a dead crewman Green to meet Kirk and McCoy who found the other dead crewman Sturgeon. Kirk, McCoy and Green (Shape Shifted Nancy) return to the Enterprise. Spock can only find Robert on the planet, while Green goes off in search of salt. Green gets more & more desperate and shape shifts into Nancy to meet McCoy. Nancy is able to put McCoy to sleep in his cabin and then shape shifts into McCoy to hunt for more crewmen.

Kirk and Spock beam down to meet Robert. Spock finds Green's dead body on the planet. Meanwhile the creature as McCoy reaches the bridge and gets access to all security protocols. Robert meanwhile reveals that Nancy was killed by the shape shifting creature of the planet (who needed salt to survive), who is the last of its kind. Kirk returns to Enterprise with Spock and Robert and lays salt tablets as bait to catch the creature Kirk wants Robert to help him find the creature, but Robert refuses as the creature is simply trying to survive. Kirk orders the truth serum to be injected into Robert and Spock accompanies McCoy. The creature, as McCoy, attacks Spock and kills Robert. Creature gets back to the real McCoy and shape shifts into Nancy and wants McCoy to protect it from Kirk. Kirk and Spock enter the room and beg McCoy to see that the creature is not Nancy. The creature has super human strength and can paralyze Kirk. It is about to kill Kirk when Spock intervenes. Only when the creature shape shifts into its original form, is McCoy able to shoot and kill it."

The Enterprise picks up Charlie Evans, an unstable 17-year-old boy, who spent 14 years alone on a deserted planet Thasus (His space craft crashed on a deserted planet, but he managed to survive). He was sent aboard the Enterprise from a cargo vessel who wants Enterprise to drop off Charlie to his relatives on Colony Alpha V. Charlie claims to have lived by eating local plants and learned to talk by interacting with the ships memory banks, which also survived. Charlie is curious and has never met females before. He says the people on the previous ship didn't like him.

Kirk wants McCoy to talk to Charlie about sex. Meanwhile Charlie has a crush on Janice. Spock meanwhile thinks there were Thasians on the planet where Charlie crash landed. Charlie can control other people, and can play all sort of card tricks. When Charlie finds out that the cargo vessel captain is trying to connect with Kirk, the vessel blows up, indicating Charlie had something to do with it. Spock defeats Charlie at 3D chess. He gets mad, and when Spock leaves, he mind bends the chess pieces. Charlie's crush on Janice is turning into an obsession. He wants to have sex with her.

Janice talks to Kirk to dissuade Charlie. Kirk tries to speak to Charlie that he cant have Janice. Kirk takes Charlie to the gym for some release. Kirk beats Charlie at wrestling and Charlie gets mad at a crew member who laughs. Charlie makes him ""disappear"" into thin air. When Kirk tries to arrest Charlie he makes all the phaser guns disappear as well. Charlie admits that he was responsible for the destruction of the cargo vessel as they weren't ""nice"" to him. When Kirk tries to contact Colony Alpha V, Charlie blows up the ship's communications. He wont allow Kirk to change course either as he wants to get to Alpha V asap. Charlie goes to Janice to have sex and she slaps him, so he makes her disappear. Charlie is more and more out of control of Kirk.

Charlie takes control of the ship and Kirk realizes that Charlie is maxed out. His plan it to overwhelm Charlie's mental powers to distract him and tranquilize him. As Kirk turns on every power system on the ship, Charlie tries to fight that and as a result loses control of the communications. A Thasus ship appears on the starboard side and hails the Enterprise. Janice is returned to the Enterprise. The Thasus leader tele-forms on the bridge and says that Thasians gave Charlie powers to survive, but he misused them and escaped. Kirk begs that he belongs with his own kind, But Thasian leader argues that Charlie will kill humans and humans will be forced to kill him to survive. Thasians offer him life in their own world.

They retrieve the data on the transmitter and figure that 200 yrs ago, the Valiant was hit by a magnetic storm at the edge of the galaxy and was thrown back into the galaxy space. The ships log then has multiple searches on ESP (Extrasensory Perception) ratings of crew members. Something else happens which kills all crewmen on the ship other than the captain. The Captain then orders self destruction of the ship a few days later.

Kirk orders the Enterprise to the point where Valiant went and encounters a force field. After the Enterprise attempts to cross the Great Barrier at the edge of the galaxy, crew members Gary Mitchell (Helmsman) and Elizabeth Dehner (Psycologist) are hit with massive energy surges, which also knock out the ship's warp drives. The ship uses impulse power to return back into the galaxy. The Enterprise has a few people dead and each of them had a portion of their brains burned out. Spock finds that both Mitchell and Dehner scored high in their academy ESP scores.

Mitchell is in sickbay and displays aggression and wants Kirk to be ""nice to him"".. He can control instruments with thought.. Dehner observes him and he trusts her. Kirk finds that Mitchell is able to control the ship's bridge instruments and confronts Dehner, who defends Mitchell saying he hasn't hurt anyone and a being with superior ESP could be beneficial for mankind. Spock reckons Mitchell is developing ""godlike"" psychic powers, and soon wont be under anyone's control. Spock says Kirk has 2 options, kill Mitchell. or strand him on planet Delta Vega (which they reach under impulse) and use the Dilithium core from its mining machines to kick start the Enterprise engines and warp out. Kirk forces Mitchell down to the surface of Delta Vega after drugging him. Mitchell talks about finding a ""suitable"" planet for himself where he can play god. Kirk discovers that hitting a force field drains Mitchell's power for a second. The Enterprise engines are repaired. Kirk installs a destruct button on the surface of Delta Vega, in case Mitchell escapes. Meanwhile Mitchell gets more powerful and is able to project his power beyond the force-field and escapes. Turns out Dehner was in cahoots with him. Kirk goes after Mitchell and Dehner with orders that Enterprise leaves to the nearest base within 12 hrs (if they don't hear from Kirk) and expose Delta Vega to a lethal dose to radiation to kill everyone on the surface.

Kirk tracks Dehner and Mitchell as they plan to settle on their new life on Vega. Dehner speaks to Kirk, but Kirk tries to get Dehner to see that Mitchell is not God, but a human who got God powers. He is not compassionate and has all the flaws of humans. He appeals to her human side to help Kirk stop Mitchell. As Mitchell tries to kill Kirk, he proves Kirk's point and Dehner tries to stop Mitchell, in the process Dehner stuns Mitchell badly and drains his power, giving Kirk an opening to attack Mitchell and bury him in the grave that Mitchell had prepared for Kirk.

PSI 2000 is a frozen wasteland that is about to rip apart. Enterprise mission was to pick up the scientific crew and to observe the disintegration of the planet But the crew finds everyone frozen to death (with life support systems turned off) and one person taking a bath fully clothed. Tormolen picks an infection from the planet by being careless with his gear. He was having trouble operating an instrument and hence removed his gloves momentarily and touched surfaces in the laboratory with his bare hands, which was enough for the infection to find its way through.

Spock and Tormolen are beamed back up, and the ship remains in orbit to take measurements as the planet breaks apart. Aboard the ship, Tormolen gets manic depressive (he says that 6 people were dead, and they didn't have a care in the world before they killed themselves) and tries to kill himself (he was already picking fights with everybody on the ship), in the process cutting his skin and spreading the infection to other crew members as well. The infection spreads with contact to the skin. Tormolen dies from his injuries which puzzles McCoy as the injuries were superficial and yet nothing McCoy did could revive him. The only reason he died was because he didn't want to live.

The Planet begins to collapse and the helm needs to react quickly to maintain the ships distance from the planet, saving it from sudden magnetic field and gravity spikes. Both the helmsmen were involved in saving Tormolen and now show casual behavior and desert their posts. Spock notices too late and orders other crew members to control the helm of the ship.

A strange, intoxicating infection, which lowers the crew's emotional inhibitions, spreads throughout the Enterprise. As the madness spreads, the entire ship is endangered. The planet's mass shrinks further, which pulls the Enterprise towards it The infected crewmen have taken over the Engine bay and locked Scotty out. From there Helmsman O'Reily has taken control of the entire ship, including communications. Kirk orders Scotty to cut through the walls to get to him. Helmsman Sulu (who was captured by Kirk and Spock) is in sickbay, with McCoy running tests on him. There are 20 mins left before the Enterprise enters the planet's atmosphere and total destruction. Spock is infected by nurse Catherine (who insists that she loves him) and locks himself in his room

Kirk and Scotty break into the engine room to find O'Reily has shut the engines down. He needs 30 mins to fire them up. The ship has 8 mins before it burns up. Kirk wants Spock to help him cold start the engines with an implosion, which has never been done before. Kirk also catches the infection, while McCoy finds the antidote serum. McCoy figures that somehow the planet's water changed to a complex chain of molecules. It passes from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream it acts like alcohol and depresses the center for judgment Kirk goes to Spock's room and slaps him several times to get Spock to take control of his senses. Spock says there is an intermix formula to cold start the engines based on relationship between anti-matter and time. Spock and Scotty work on the formula and fire up the engines. The formula works, but the engine output is very high and ship accelerates beyond the speed of light, the speed it now travelling back in time.. Kirk and Spock make a note of it, as they regressed by 71 hrs and hope to use this someday"

Scotty finds out about the malfunction when one of the animals beamed up after Kirk split into 2, who are not duplicates, but opposites of each other

Good Kirk puts the pieces together (with reports of Kirk assaulting McCoy for Saurion Brandy and so on) and deduces that he himself has split into 2. Evil Kirk tries to rape Janice (Kirk has always had a thing for Janice, but had never acted on his impulses before due to the constraint from his good self, which was now removed) and hits a yeoman unconscious, when he sees this and then runs away to try and warn Spock. Janice scratches evil Kirk's face. Spock deduces that there is only one logical answer that there is an impostor on-board. Spock says that they cant kill the evil Kirk as they don't know the impact it could have on the good Kirk Meanwhile 4 men from the ship are stuck on the surface of the planet and cant be beamed up since Scotty has not figured out how to fix the transporter yet. Temperatures are dropping and it gets to minus 120 degrees at night. They will die

Meanwhile Good Kirk makes an announcement to the crew over the PA about the impostor. The evil Kirk listens to the broadcast and covers his scratch. Spock understands that the evil Kirk is still Kirk and asks the good Kirk where he would hide in the ship. They both head to the lower engineering levels where they find the evil Kirk hiding. As Evil Kirk starts to shoot the good Kirk, Spock captures him with the Vulcan neck grip. Before falling unconscious, the evil Kirk fires his phaser which hits the transporter circuit boards. Spock observes that the good Kirk is quickly losing his ability to make decisions and says that its the evil Kirk, that makes Kirk a great leader.

Meanwhile the transporter will require a week to get fixed and men below are dying by every passing hour. good Kirk is indecisive.. Meanwhile the evil Kirk is dying in the sick bay as its internal organs were injured during the duplication process. Good Kirk talks to his evil self and gives it reason to live. Scotty figures out a way to make the transporters work by using the impulse engines. They send the duplicate animals through the transporters and then reverse it and find that it comes back as a single self. The animals dies. Spock says its the shock of putting the animal together that killed it, while McCoy wants to do a full autopsy on the dead animal before proceeding any further. Spock wants Kirk to go through the transporter, but McCoy is afraid it might kill him.

good Kirk wants help in making the decision, but is not yet willing to relinquish command. Evil Kirk escapes the sick bay (by hitting the Good Kirk and stealing his uniform) and takes control of the bridge and orders the Enterprise out of orbit, abandoning the team on the planet. The good Kirk reaches in time and realize that they are both halves of each other and cant survive in isolation. They head to the transporter room. Kirk comes back as one.

The vessel has no registration identification and its planet of origin is uncertain. The vessel's captain gives his name as Leo Walsh and the 3 women are his cargo. Kirk says Leo is lying and convenes an inquiry on him. Walsh is confined to his quarters till the completion of the inquiry.

The 3 women smite all the men on board the Enterprise (they are dreadfully beautiful and charmingly sexy). In rescuing the occupants, the Enterprise damaged its lithium crystals (as the ship's own engines overheated during the rescue) and only one functioning left, and that too might not hold as it has an hairline crack at the base. Spock suggests a course to Rigel XII, a mining planet with a supply of lithium.. The planet is only 2 days away.

Under a lie detector machine, Leo reveals that he is Harry Mudd, an interstellar con man, who is transporting three mysteriously beautiful women to become the wives of Dilithium miners on a settlement planet Ophiuchus-3. Mudd says his profession is to recruit wives for settlers. There is no data on the 3 women Ruthie, Magda and Evie. Evie says that they come from planets with no men. She welcomes the opportunity of men waiting for them to be their husbands. As the hearing concludes the last crystal goes off and now the entire ship is dependent on batteries. Mudd is happy that the ship is going towards the lithium mines as that would also have rich miners for the girls. The ship proceeds to Rigel XII on auxiliary impulse power.

McCoy gives the medical exam to one of the girls and finds no readings for her on his scanners. Evie is tasked by Mudd to seduce Kirk but she cant do it, as she likes Kirk. Mudd takes a communicator that Magda stole and contacts Rigel XII. Meanwhile as Enterprise enters orbit around Rigel XII, the women show rapid signs of aging and want Mudd to give them the pills. Kirk meets the leader of the miners Childress & Gossett, who wants Mudd freed (charges dropped) and his girls in exchange for the Dilithium crystals. Kirk has to agree. But at the surface Evie refuses to mingle with the mining crew and escapes into the magnetic storm that suddenly engulfs the surface of the planet. Childress wont give the crystals without her.

Kirk returns to the Enterprise to search for Evie who is now lost on the planet, but the magnetic storm in interfering with the sensors (they have already been searching for 3 hrs and 18 mins) and the ship is now down to 43 mins of power as several more hours of search reveals nothing about Evie's location. Childress finds Evie and brings her to his cabin. He finds Evie getting old. As the magnetic storm eases, the Enterprise finds Evie in Childress's cabin. Kirk and Mudd enter Childress's cabin on the planet's surface, where Kirk makes Mudd reveal that he has been giving the women Venus drug, which makes them rounder and more appealing.

His last message was 5 yrs ago where he talked about finding underground caverns. Since then 2 expeditions have failed to find Korby. But Korby responds to the Enterprise. Kirk beams down with Chapel and 2 security men. One of the men is pushed down a bottomless pit by an unknown assailant & the 2nd one is murdered, when Kirk is distracted by Dr Brown (Harry Basch), Korby's assistant.

Kirk meets Korby, who stops Kirk from establishing contact with the Enterprise. Brown draws phasers on him, but Kirk shoots him, revealing that Brown was an android. Kirk is controlled by the unknown assailant, whose name is Ruk (Ted Cassidy). RUk was found on the planet by Korby, protecting the machines left by the old ones. Korby has discovered an ancient machine which allows him to duplicate any living person with an android replacement. And a young girl android, Andrea (Sherry Jackson), who is dressed in an unusual jumpsuit resembling red suspender bottoms with straps, with no blouse. She is also an android created by Korby.

Kory demonstrates the results of his experiments to Kirk & Chapel. Korby plans to use the machine to spread controlled androids throughout the Federation. Eventually Korby says by continuing his work he can transfer entire consciousness into an android. Korby wants control of the Enterprise to travel to a planet with the proper raw materials to continue his experiments. Korby brings Christine into an experiment chamber. He says ""Here is how you make an android. He pushes a switch, and the table swivels, revealing Kirk. On the other side is a putty form. He spins the controls and the machine turns wildly. As it is spinning, Kirk says over and over quietly ""Mind your own business, Mr. Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference."" He wants the phrase inside the android Kirk's mind.

As Kirk expected, Korby sends the android up to the ship to give orders to Kirk's crew, in order to to help Korby take over. Spock stops the android in the hallway and says ""Captain, are you alright?"" And the android Kirk snaps at him with the prejudiced phrase ""Mind your own business Mr. Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference!"". Spock knows something is wrong. Down on the planet, the real Kirk stirs up Ruk's anger (Kirk reminds RUk that the old ones created him and the androids killed the old ones as they were not logical. The Androids are making the same mistake with Korby and Kirk makes Ruk realize that one day Korby would have to be killed too). As Korby enters the room, Ruk moves toward him to kill him. Korby disintegrates Ruk.

Next Kirk finds Andrea. He says ""Andrea, kiss me."" Again, she kisses him softly. Then she is about to slap him, and he grabs her and kisses her some more. She is weak and dizzy. The android has beamed back down and is preparing things to bring to the Enterprise. Andrea sees him. She looks at him and says gently ""Please kiss me."" He says ""It is illogical."" So she shoots him with a phaser. Korby is in the room holding a phaser on Kirk, but his hand is caught in the door. The skin comes away, and underneath there is circuitry. Korby is an android too. What the hell?? Andrea comes in to report shooting the prisoner and sees Kirk, and recognizes her mistake. Then she moves slowly toward Korby. She says...

""To..to love you. To.. to kiss you."" She moves her lips toward Korby's, but the phaser goes off and they are both disintegrated. The ship is saved. Nurse Chapel decides to stay on the Enterprise."

The person dies in front of them and McCoy finds that the metabolic rate of the body is very high. They find Miri hidden in one of the old buildings which as per Spock are more than 300 yrs old.

On Miri's (Kim Darby) planet, all of the adults are dead. Miri is getting older, and she will die too. There is a virus that kills everyone when they go through the change from teenager to adult, and their body changes. The little children and teenagers steal the phasers and communicators of the landing party. Kirk finds Miri pretty and who likes the handsome Captain Kirk. He is so sweet to her, that she becomes fond of him.

Miri points to Kirk that all the people on his landing party, except Spock, are contracting the bacterial decease. Kirk orders the Enterprise not to send anymore personnel down to the planet. Miri helps them find an old hospital, where they learn of an age elongation project, which focused on reducing the metabolic rate and the concentration of nucleic acid in the body. Hence the children on the planet are hundreds of yrs old, but due to puberty certain glands get activated and as they turn adults, they die within days. Their plan was to prolong life by 1 month for 100 yrs of actual elapsed time.

Post puberty, Miri has 5-6 weeks left before the decease takes over and she dies. The Enterprise crew is older and they have 7 days. But with the communicators gone, McCoy does have access to the ships's computers and cant create an anti-virus.

But then Yeoman Janice is crying, because she is catching the virus. She says to Kirk ""You always liked to look at my legs. Well, Captain, look at my legs."" There are ugly virus blotches on her thighs. So Kirk holds her because she is sad. But Miri is spying, and sees them, and becomes jealous. She runs to tell Jahn (Michael J. Pollard), the teenage boy who is the leader. She says ""If you kill the Yeoman, you will defeat them, because she is all love & charm with the Captain."" She is so jealous she wants the Yeoman dead, because she admires Kirk so much. Spock and McCoy are close to a vaccine but need access to computers to test it. Kirk reasons with Miri to tell him about the communicators and Janice. he says unless Miri gets the vaccine she will also die. Miri is adamant that the decease only kills some children, randomly. He shows Miri her blotches.

The children throw rocks at Kirk. He yells ""Stop it!! You are all going to die. Miri is dying. Jahn is dying. We can help you."" Finally they agree. McCoy's vaccine works and Kirk transports all kids to the Enterprise to take them to an Earth colony. Miri is crying because she tried to betray them, but Kirk takes her face with his hand and kisses her respectfully on the forehead. ""You know, Miri"" he says ""Because of the virus, all of you are really hundreds of years old. I never did like older women."" She smiles at him. She never loved anyone so much."

The madman transports himself on the Enterprise inside one of the boxes that Enterprise was supposed to pick up and then reaches the bridge. He identifies himself as Van Gelder to Kirk and seeks asylum aboard the ship and a guarantee that he wont be taken back to Tantalus (the penal colony). Spock disables Van Gelder and Kirk returns the ship to Tantalus.

In the medical bay, Kirk questions Van Gelder, who is in pain every-time he reveals something about his identity to Kirk. Kirk contacts Tantalus director Dr Adams, and offers to returns Dr Van Gelder, who was Adam's associate. Dr Adams is known to have revolutionized penal colonies with his rehabilitation work with criminally insane minds. But McCoy is not sure about this, and wants Kirk to personally investigate this matter on Tantalus. Kirk decides to go with Dr Helen.

As Spock attempts to connect with Van Gelder's (Morgan Woodward) mind on ship (where he talks about a neural neutralizer on the surface), the amiable Dr Tristan Adams (James Gregory), at the penal colony, explains to Ms Noel, and to Kirk, that Van Gelder was once the head of the facility but is now mad. Kirk, in his command uniform, and Dr Noel, dressed in life science colors with black leggings, explore the facility, and stumble upon a' treatment room' with a powerful strobe-light device. Adams explains that this is the neural neutralizer where Van Gelder injured himself. Its an experimental treatment, which Ven Gelder used on himself before subjecting any human to it, and it went wrong, damaging his neural synapses. Spock mind melds with Van Gelder to find the truth if Kirk is in danger or not.

Exploring late at night, the two decide to see what the 'treatment room' is really about. Kirk goes into the chair, and from the control panel, Helen uses the microphone, and plants the innocent suggestion in Kirk's mind that at last year's Life Science Christmas Party, where he met her, they did more than just chat. That the night continued in his cabin. Dr. Adams at this point catches them with his goons, restrains Helen, and then turns the strobe up to full, and uses the mike to intensify the illusion in Kirk's mind - to the point where he will experience extreme pain unless he is near Helen.

Kirk is isolated in locked quarters, and when they throw Helen in too, Kirk madly kisses her and holds her. Helen says ""Stop, they did this to you. We must find a way to stop them."" Kirk regains his senses for a moment, and comes up with a plan. He boosts Helen into an air-duct, and leaves right away when the goons come to bring him for another 'treatment'. Helen reaches the control room, and shuts down the power, to open the security screen which blocks transporters. Kirk has disabled Adams and his goons and runs back to find Helen.

Helen crawls back into the room, and he takes her in his arms and begins kissing her passionately. Spock, who has beamed down with a phaser, sees them and coughs. ""Captain"" he says, and raises his eyebrow seeing the two of them hugging. Meanwhile, Doctor Adams, who was knocked unconscious by Kirk when the power went down in the 'treatment room' and collapsed in the chair, is in the chair when the power is restored. Alone, and with not even a tormentor for company, he dies. Don't use power to brainwash others. He got what he deserved. .

Spock performs a mind meld for the first time in this episode."

No star-ship has been this far out from Earth before. The ship has been making star maps in this section for 3 days now. Kirk and the Enterprise have encountered a space buoy which will not leave their path. The cube object stays at a distance of 1593 m and measure 107 m on each side, 11,000 metric tonnes in weight. the cube has been holding the ship for 18 hrs. It is a device of some kind and currently is posing no threat to the ship. No signs of life, or any answer to any communication frequencies of any kind. Kirk tries to go around and then retreat, but the cube follows and narrows the gap, thereby increasing the radiation on the ship. As everyone's life on the Enterprise is endangered, Kirk decides to destroy it with phasers. Kirk is not happy with the performance of helmsman Bailey during this crisis. Bailey took time to follow Kirk's orders and panicked at several instances as the cube followed the Enterprise. Kirk orders a set of simulation drills till the response times are adequately addressed.

A few hrs later a mammoth ship traps them in its tractor beam. The ship has energy readings similar to the cube, only much larger. The ship is more than a mile in diameter. Bailey again freezes at his station and fails to act timely on Kirk's orders.

The captain of the other ship is named Balok (Clint Howard), a hideous, ugly being who promises to destroy them. He says Enterprise has illegally entered his star system and destroyed the buoy that was supposed to be their warning. Any hostile action will lead to destruction. Balok grants them 10 mins to say their prayers before the Enterprise is destroyed. Every time Kirk tries to explain their actions as an act of self preservation, Balok starts a humming frequency on all channels to drown his voice out. Kirk pretends that the Enterprise has a doomsday weapon called Corbomite which will destroy everything, including Balok. Kirk says that there is no record of Corbomite, and the last time it was used was 2 centuries ago. Every Earth vessel is equipped with it. If the vessel is fired upon, Corbomite generates an energy pulse of equal and opposite intensity aimed at the firing vessel. Kirk further says that death has no meaning for Earthlings and challenges Balok to fire.

Dave Bailey (the helmsman) begins to lose control, and Kirk orders him to leave the bridge. Later he comes back and tries to remain calm. Balok is deceived by Kirk's trick and delays the destruction of the Enterprise. Balok retreats and leaves a smaller vessel (2000 metric tons) to guide the enterprise to a suitable planet to be interned, while the Enterprise will be destroyed. The smaller ship tows the Enterprise towards a planet. Kirk uses the Enterprise Engines and Impulse power to work against the tow. He drains the towing vessels power and overheats their engines, thereby damaging them. As Enterprise breaks free, it picks a distress signal from Balok saying that engines are damaged and life support systems are failing.

Kirk decides to board the vessel and rescue the alien. Kirk, Bailey and McCoy beam over. Balok is not a gruesome being. He is a small man, no more than three feet, the size of a small child.

He laughs and offers them orange drink called Tranya. The distress signal was a test to gauge the real intentions of the Enterprise. He asks if one of them can stay with him to share cultures. Kirk asks Bailey, and Bailey says yes, because the pressure would be less."

Captain James T Kirk beams down to find out, with Spock and McCoy. Commodor Jose Mendez (Malachi Throne) shows Kirk that Captain Pike is in a wheelchair machine, and only his head can be seen in it, and he can only answer with a blinking light. One blink for yes, two blinks for no.

Kirk learns from Mendez, the commander of the entire star-base, that Captain Pike was injured in a fire (a baffle plate on a old star-ship ruptured), when he rushed in and pulled out all the children cadets that were still alive. The Delta rays from the fire destroyed his entire body and left him like this. Mendez tells Kirk ""It is impossible for him to send a message."" Spock is hatching a plot. His whole plan is to kidnap Captain Pike and take him to Talos IV.

Talos IV is a planet that is OFF LIMITS for all of Starfleet. Visiting Talos IV means the death penalty. It is the only Death Penalty in Starfleet, other than treason. No one knows why. Spock has prepared fake copies of Kirk's voice and the Starbase voices. He subdues a guard and then transmits the messages to the Enterprise. He returns to the ship, carrying ""orders"" (fake) from Captain Kirk that Spock is now in command. Pike, who Spock has kidnapped, is kept quietly in a room. McCoy doesn't like it, but orders are orders.

Commodore Mendez and Kirk pursue them, flying in a small shuttle-craft. They almost overtake them, but their craft runs out of fuel. Spock shows mercy and rescues them (before that he feeds a tape of instructions into the computer that keeps the ship on course for Talous IV and the orders cannot be overridden), but then Spock must stand trial for Court Martial aboard the ship. Kirk says we cannot have a Court Martial with only two command rank officers. But then Spock, for an unknown reason, tells them ""You have three command rank officers. You have Captain Pike. In the courtroom on the ship, Spock asks to play a ""video,"" which he says will explain his reasons. Mendez and Kirk know they must allow him any evidence in a court martial capital trial, so he is allowed. The video shows Captain Pike's first visit to Talos IV. ""Where did you get this video?"" demands Mendez. No answer. Then the video plays.

We see the old bridge of the ship. Captain Pike, and Spock, and the first officer Number One, who is a smart, but cold, tall brunette, and other crew men and women. Spock is younger, so he has more emotions.

They receive an automated distress call from Talos IV. The call is from USS Columbia, which was lost in the Talos Star system 18 yrs ago. Talos IV is the 4th planet of this star system and a class M planet. They beam down to a barren, rocky planet and find vibrating plants and a tent-camp full of very old men. These men sent the distress signal many many years ago, when their ship crashed, and are shocked to see humans coming toward them. They cannot believe their eyes. Suddenly a very young and beautiful blonde girl walks toward the men, dressed in rags, but very attractive. Her name is Vina (Susan Oliver). The old men explain that she was only a baby when the crash occurred, and her elderly parents died in the crash.

She is fascinated with the young men who have arrived, especially Captain Pike. ""Do you want to see our secret?"" she asks him, and Pike takes her hand and follows her. She leads him to a cave, and then BOOM!! She vanishes into thin air. Spock sees this and yells ""Look!"" Suddenly the entire tent-camp, and all of the old men disappear. It was all an illusion. Spock notifies the ship quickly. 2 old women emerge from the cave and capture Pike as he has been lured away from the main landing party.

Suddenly, the video in the courtroom stops playing, but nobody has turned it off. ""What is the meaning of this?"" demands Mendez. ""Starfleet does not keep these kinds of records, and if you have received these from Talos IV (this video was not a tape, but a transmission), then you have signed your death warrant."" Spock says ""Commodore, if I am to die, so be it. But you MUST see the rest of this video."" Mendez denies Spock's request, and demands that Spock release the controls of the Enterprise. He calls for an immediate vote. ""Call for a verdict,"" says Mendez. ""Guilty, yes or no? My vote is yes. It must be unanimous. Captain Kirk?"" Kirk looks sad, but knows the law. ""Yes"" he says quietly. Mendez looks at Pike in his chair. ""Yes or no, Captain Pike?"" Pike blinks yes. Spock is guilty.

Spock grabs Kirk's arm. ""Jim"" he says. ""Don't stop me. Don't let HIM stop me. You MUST see the rest of the video."" Spock is dragged out by guards, and taken to the holding cell. Kirk looks at the blank screen. What the hell happened down there, he thinks."

They have no choice. Spock cannot stop it, nor the trial board. We see Pike and Vina, the blonde girl, dressed now in a small dress, inside a Plexiglas cage with nothing but a bed. Pike realizes that they are prisoners. Suddenly, three Talosians approach the cage. They have shapes like very old women, with large brains, covered with pulsing veins. They speak with their minds. The Keeper, who is their leader, speaks to Pike through the Plexiglas.

Suddenly Pike finds himself on a fantastic planet with a castle. This cannot be real, he thinks. I was here a month ago. How can this be real. Suddenly a woman rushes toward him, scared, and says ""Hurry. We must hurry."" This is Veena, dressed now as a princess, with a tall hat and veil. This cannot be happening, thinks Pike, but he follows her into the castle. On the wall of the parapet is a beast-like man with a sharpened spear. He grabs for Veena. Pike fights him, and after a struggle, kills the beast-man. Veena looks at him. ""You saved me."" and tries to kiss him. Then they are back in the cell. Pike realizes that Talosians can read his mind and can create any illusion which his brain will accept as reality.

Pike talks to Vina. He asks her why they are doing this to him. She explains that the Talosian race died out many years ago in a surface war, which forced the species underground. There was no life underground, so the Talosians focused on creating brain power to live the life of their ancestors in their dreams. Then they started capturing other species and created scenarios for them, and it was like a form of entertainment for them. They knew that the entire culture would be destroyed unless they found a way to repopulate the planet. When the ship crashed, she explains, I was the only survivor. But Pike says you are just an illusion too. But she tells him she is real, as any woman he has ever seen.

The Keeper returns. ""Do you find her suitable?"" she asks Pike. ""If you can read my mind, you know I like her. But what is to stop me from breaking out of here and twisting your neck off?"" The Keeper frowns. ""You forget the unpleasant alternative of pain."" Suddenly Pike is in a pool of molten flaming lava, dripping from his skin. He is in agony. Then the illusion stops. The Keeepr says ""We only want you to find her desirable to perpetuate the species and the woman needs a mate. Perhaps our deepest memories are from our homes."" The illusion shifts, and Pike is now on his farm on earth. Vina is sitting on a picnic blanket, and there is a horse standing by. ""Tango!"" he says, ""recognizing his horse from childhood. ""Sorry, old boy, I have no sugar cubes."" He reaches in his pocket and he does have sugar cubes. ""They think of everything."" Pike theorizes that Talosians want their captured species to pro-create as they want to create a colony of slaves to maintain their planet and their machines to keep them alive.

Vina looks at him. ""Stop fighting"" she says. Pike asks her ""How do you stop them from reading your mind? Do angry thoughts prevent it?"" She is upset that he will not sit on the blanket with her. ""Yes, but you cannot keep the angry thoughts going"" Pike takes her hands. ""They know I find you desirable. But why do they want me to mate with you?"" The Keepers meanwhile are watching on a monitor. A man can be comfortable with fond memories of home. But he wants something exotic, something tempting, yes.

Suddenly Pike is in a harem, and there is a green Orion slave girl doing an exotic dance. The green girl is Vina again, looking at Pike sexually as she dances. he is losing control of himself. He is sweating and helpless to watch her. He runs to a cave, but she appears with a torch in front of him, biting her lip and looking at him lustfully. Then we see them in the cage. Pike has his eyes closed, and Vina is stroking his hair. In his mind, he is still in the illusion. The Keepers are approaching. ""No"" she says ""I almost have him. Why are you stopping?""

Pike snaps out of it. The Enterprise has been trying to shoot through the cave wall on the surface of the planet, but it is not working. They decide to beam down six of the crew, led by Number One (Majel Barrett) to the caverns underneath the planet, where they have tracked Captain Pike's signal. The transporter beam shimmers, but afterward, they are all still on the pads. But the two women are not. they have been transported. In the cage now are three women. Vina, Number One, and a young yeoman Colt (Laurel Goodwin). The Keepers approach. Captain, we see that sometimes the men of your species require a choice. All are suitable. The female you call Number One is tall, strong, and possesses a superior mind. The other has youth, and particularly strong female drives. She has admired you for a long time, but has always thought you unreachable.

Pike says ""Number One, give me your phaser."" She does. He turns it up high and shoots at the Plexiglas, but it does not work. ""When I get out of here"" Pike says ""I'm going to twist your head off."" It is a little later, and they are all sleeping in the cage. A small door opens at the side. A bony hand is reaching in to take the phasers that the girls had with them. Pike lunges, grabs the hand, and drags the Keeper inside. He grabs her neck as the girls all wake up.

""I see you wanted our phasers. Why?"" He turns one up to full power, and shoots at the Plexiglas. He says to the Keeper, ""Now I'm willing to bet that I just blasted a hole in the wall, and you are causing the illusion that I have not. Would you like me to test my theory on your head?"" He points the phaser at the Keeper's head. Suddenly, the hole appears. They all step through it, Pike holding the Keeper tightly, and the girls all climbing out. They reach the cave entrance, and the Keeper is forced to remove the illusions. Number One sees the destroyed entrance. ""We did blast through it. They only made us think we had not.""

The Keeper speaks. ""We cannot permit you to leave. We must preserve our race."" Kirk says to his crew women ""Turn your phasers on auto-destruct."" Then he turns to the Keeper. ""In three minutes, there is going to be an explosion, destroying everything within a mile. Now, to show you how barbaric I am, you go back down below and save yourself."" The Keeper is stunned. Pike turns to Vina. ""You too."" She looks at him with love. ""No"" she says, if you three consider this so important, I will stay with you.""

Another Talosian suddenly appears at the entrance and whispers to The Keeper, who say to Pike ""We will allow you to leave."" Pike turns off the destruct on the phaser, and the girls do as well. The Keeper speaks. ""We had no idea how strongly your species feels about captivity. That you would rather die than face it. You are too unstable for us."" Pike orders his crew girls back to the ship and says he will follow in a moment. When they leave, he turns to Vina. You may come too. but she says she cannot. Suddenly the illusion of her beauty fades, and we see a deformed and crippled girl. ""This is how they found me in the crash, a lump of flesh, barely alive. They repaired my body. Eveything works. But they had no idea what a human looked like, so this is what they made.""

The Keeper says ""Now you know."" Pike asks ""Will you give her back her illusion of beauty?"" The Keeper smiles ""And more."" Vina has become even more beautiful in the illusion. The Keeper says ""We will die out as a race."" Pike returns to the Enterprise. Number One asks ""Didn't Vina come with you?"" He says to her ""No. And I understand her reasons.""

In the courtroom. the monitor stops. Now Kirk understands. He turns to the Commodore and says ""Commodore, don't you think..."" but suddenly the Commodore vanishes. The face of the Keeper appears on the screen. ""Captain Kirk"" the Keeper says, ""the Commodore was not on board. His appearance on the Enterprise, and on the shuttle-craft were merely illusions, to keep the pretense of a trial continuing until your arrival. We welcome Captain Pike to live here in comfort with Vina.""

Kirk turns to Pike. ""Chris"" he says, ""Do you want to go there?"" Pike blinks yes. The guards bring Pike to the transporter room. Kirk turns to Spock and says ""you could have asked me."" Spock replies ""Would you have said yes? I could not afford to endanger you, only myself."" A message comes through the intercom on the bridge from the Starbase. ""We received transmissions from Talos IV. All charges against Mr. Spock are dropped, signed, Mendez, JM, Commodore."" Everyone except Kirk leaves the courtroom. Kirk looks at the screen. There are Vina and Pike, entering the cave entrance, both young and attractive. Kirk smiles and The Keeper speaks. ""Captain Pike has his illusion, and you have your reality. May you find your way as pleasant."""

But turns out Thomas had called Kirk to accuse an actor Anton Karidian of being the mass executioner Kodos. Kodos was suspected of killing 4000 people, but the authorities now ascertain that he is dead. Kodos was the Governor of planet Tarsus IV 20 yrs ago and declared martial law and killed 50% of the population. He did after the food supply on Tarsus was destroyed by a fungus. Kodos split the population into 2 parts, 1 would get rationed food supply and the other was put to death. Anton is part of the travelling stage troupe that performs cultural plays all over the galaxy for the last 9 yrs. No info on Anton is available from 20 yrs ago. Thomas wants Kirk's help to capture Kodos.

Captain Kirk suspects Anton of secretly being the former mass murderer Kodos the Executioner, who slaughtered thousands on the planet where Kirk lived with his parents when he was a teenager. On board also is Kevin Riley (Bruce Hyde), whose family too fell victim to Kodos. Kirk observes the acting troupe performing ""MacBeth"", but cannot determine Kodos' identity positively. Kirk attends a cocktail party given by Thomas, which has invited Anton and Lenore. Anton doesn't attend, so Kirk decides to seduce Lenore. But then Thomas is found dead just outside the party venue. Kirk is now determined to find Konos. Kirk arranges for the pick up for the acting troupe to be diverted and offers to drop them to their next venue via the Enterprise.

Spock is curious about the theatre troupe on Enterprise and figures out the link between Kirk, Kodos, Anton and Riley (by re-searching on the ship's library computer). Kirk and Riley are the only eye witnesses alive who can identify Kodos, 7 are dead and every time the theatre company was playing nearby. The actor's daughter, Lenore (Barbara Anderson) (is 19 yrs old), dressed smartly in a short white fur dress, is escorted by Kirk through the ship, finally ending in the small observation deck after hours. The lead actor, an older gentleman named Anton Karidian (Arnold Moss), when questioned by Kirk, does not confess, but explains why he think ""Kodos"" did what he did. There was no food on that planet, and no hope unless some were killed off. They had no idea a supply ship was about to arrive. How Karidian knows the details of what happened at all is not explained and Kirk does not press him. Kirk subjects Anton to a voice analysis, but its not an exact match to Kodos, yet it is very close.

Lieutenant Riley, who is working in a minor engineering control room (upon orders from Kirk) is nearly poisoned. We see a hand slipping something into his milk. Riley recovers from the attempted poisoning while the acting troupe puts on a performance of Hamlet. Riley seeks revenge on Karidian for killing Riley's parents. He is stopped by Captain Kirk. Anton had hear them argue, and goes to Lenore. But Lenore assures Anton that she has silenced 7 and the last 2 will be silenced today. Anton is disappointed that her daughter has brought more blood on his hands. Suddenly there is Lenore, with a weapon grabbed from a crewman and aimed at Kirk. It wasn't Karidian killing potential witnesses, it was his mad daughter, trying to ""protect"" her father. She fires at Kirk, but Karidian/Kodos steps in front of him. Lenore accidentally kills her father. Kirk grabs her, disarms her, and later learns from McCoy that Lenore no longer remembers anything including killing her father."

Kirk is clear that to prevent inter-planetary war, the outposts and the ship are considered expendable. The last war was more than a 100 yrs old and no one knows what a Romulan war ship looks like. and there are no visuals on any Romulans either.

From attack on the outposts, Kirk and Spock learn that the ROmulans need to de-cloak their ship in order to fire, making them visible for brief periods. Spock and Kirk also theorize that the cloaking device takes too much power from the ship's engines. Enterprise starts tracking a ship near Outpost 4 who is now moving across the Neutral zone. They get visuals from the ship and see that Romulans look like Vulcans. The whole ship turns against Spock. The Romulans pick up the Enterprise on their sensors. It is shown that the Romulan commander understands Kirk's maneuvers and knows that if Kirk follows the Romulans into the neutral zone, it will be shot and a war will start. The Romulan Commander doesn't want another war.

On Enterprise Spock is aware of the Vulcan and Romulan colonizing past. He says Earth needs to show courage and thus attack is the best option. As Enterprise prepares to attack, the Romulan Commander understands Kirk's plan and attacks first. Kirk evades their attack by reversing. The Romulan commander goes back on the path to the neutral zone, but this time Kirk decides to follow it, violating the peace treaty. In the neutral zone, the Romulan tries to fake its destruction by throwing debris out of its tubes, but Spock spots the ruse. However Spock has lost track of the Romulans and thus a wait and watch ensues.

Kirk outsmarts the Commander and attacks the Romulan ship, but this time the COmmander puts a nuclear device in the tubes with a proximity fuse. As Enterprise moves closer, the warhead explodes and damages the Enterprise badly. Aboard the Romulan ship, which possesses a 'cloaking device' to make it invisible, the men tell their Commander ""We must go for the kill! A Federation star-ship is a great prize. We will be honored when we return."" But the Commander (Mark Lenard) knows they are low on fuel, and weary from battles. He wants to bring his ship and crew home safely. But the men keep saying ""We must destroy the Enterprise."" (Also, there are no women on the Romulan vessel, as there are on the Enterprise).

Meanwhile, Kirk's ship is badly damaged, and Kirk decides to keep the power low, to pretend to be ""dead in the water"" to bait the Romulans. The end is near. Suddenly there is an explosion in auxiliary control, where Mr Stiles (Paul Comi) has been working with another crewman. Mr Stiles is a very prejudiced man. He has been making accusations about Mr Spock, because he looks just like the enemy, because of his ears. He accuses Spock of being a spy. That is why Kirk sent him on the repair mission. After the explosion, there is smoke pouring out of the auxiliary control room. Mr Spock is passing by and sees the smoke. He runs in and is choking, and pulls one of the men out safely, but the other chokes to death.

On the bridge, Kirk's plan is working. The Romulan commander is baited, and Kirk waits for him to bring his ship close and for him to turn off the cloaking shield, so to be able to fire torpedoes. Kirk waits till the last second, and commands ""Fire!!"" The Enterprise phasers cripple the Romulan ship. He radios the Commander, who he sees on the view-screen, standing, near death, among his dying crew.

""Beam your survivors here,"" says Kirk. ""We are merciful to prisoners"". Kirk was not lying. But the Commander is a good soldier and says ""It is not our way."" Then he detonates his own ship with all of the remaining crew on board. McCoy reports in from Sickbay on the intercom. ""Spock and Mr. Stiles are recovering,"" McCoy says. ""But we have one casualty from the explosion in the control room."" Lt. Tomlinson is dead.

Kirk is devastated. He goes to see Angela in the wedding chapel. She is crying. He tells her things to make her feel better. There will be no wedding, only mourning. Luckily, in the next episode,""Shore Leave"", Angela has a new boyfriend named Esteban, so all is resolved."

Sulu and McCoy are down on the surface of a planet along with Lt. Angela Martine (Barbara Baldavin) and her boyfriend Mr Esteban, and all are taking normal readings, until they stumble upon Rabbit tracks, but human sized! McCoy sees 'Alice in Wonderland' and the 'White Rabbit', right out of the Lewis Carroll story.

Up on the ship, Spock is insisting that Kirk report for Shore Leave, so he beams down with Yeoman Tonia Barrows a very pretty Yeoman with brunette hair. Krik thinks this is McCoy's ploy (The Alice in Wonderland story) to get him to take shore leave. When they arrive Sulu is running down the hill like a madman, claiming that he is being chased by a Samurai. Suddenly Yeoman Barrows (Emily Banks) screams from the bushes and runs out with her uniform half ripped down the shoulder, saying it seemed like her attacker was 'Don Juan'.

Spock sends an emergency call and beams himself down. He tells them that they are temporarily trapped on the planet due to a huge 'damping field' of electricity, and they are stranded as the energy is draining the Enterprise and impacting their communications. Kirk meanwhile has spotted an old enemy from school named Finnegan, who punches the guts out of Kirk. He was just talking to McCoy about Finnegan. Then, Kirk smells a nice flower (He thinks of Ruth), and suddenly, there is Ruth. ""Ruth"", he says ""How can you possibly be here""? (Ruth is a very favorite love of Kirk's from his school days). She has golden hair tied in a circle of rings above her head, and a chubby face and smile.

McCoy and Barrows find a princess gown like those worn by medieval ladies (She was just talking about being dressed like a princess), and McCoy suggests she try it on. He is trying to answer a security call, full of static, from Sulu but is distracted by the sight of Yeoman Barrows changing her clothes. Suddenly there is the sound of a horse charging toward them with a black knight. McCoy refuses to believe that it is real. ""It simply cannot be real"" he says, but LOOK OUT the black knight kills McCoy with his lance, and Kirk, who found an old Colt 45 gun, shoots the knight. McCoy is dead. They examine the knight, but he is made of cellulose like a plant, and McCoy's body is gone!!

On the hillside, Esteban is pointing out to Angela a Japanese ZERO fighter plane, of the type which attacked Pearl Harbor, thereby forcing the U.S.A. into the Pacific Theatre of World War II in the sky. He tells her not to worry unless it begins a 'strafing' run, then IT DOES!! and Angela is killed by the machine guns. Kirk sees Finnegan again, and beats the brains out of him. Spock finds him and says ""Are you happy?"" Kirk smiles and says yes. Spock has an idea. He tells them all of these illusions are things that the crewmen desired to see, or enemies from the past that they wanted to beat up.

In order to protect themselves, they must stop imagining and thinking. They gather in the field at attention. Suddenly McCoy walks up to them with an old man and a two lovely feathered dancers. The old man explains to them that this is a 'pleasure planet' and he is the caretaker, a Robot. As long as they guard their imaginings it is perfectly safe to have shore leave on the planet. Yeoman Tonia jealously grabs McCoy away from the feathered dancers, and Angela, who is also still alive, grabs Esteban away too. Kirk is about to go go back to the ship when suddenly he sees Ruth, and decides to stay. Spock is left to mind the ship and the entire crew is allowed to take shifts of shore leave. At the end, everyone is very happy, and Spock says ""illogical"". Everyone laughs and all is resolved."

He informs Kirk that the mission takes top priority and that all other considerations must wait, as there is a plague out of control on the New Paris colonies and the medical supplies can save them.

Kirk is also investigating a quasar, Murasaki 312, around which it is passing. Kirk sends 7 crewmen on the Galileo shuttle-craft to investigate closely. The Galileo is hit by severe radiation and goes off course, Its communications with Enterprise are broken. On Enterprise, Kirk finds that the quasar has ionized the entire quadrant with an area of 4 solar systems. And somewhere amongst the 4 systems is Galileo.

Kirk has a dilemma. Seven of his crew are caught on the surface of one of the planets, inside the Galileo shuttle-craft, including Spock, McCoy, Scott, Mister Boma (Don Marshall) (a militant black officer), an inexperienced yeoman, and two red-shirts. The weather conditions make it impossible to leave the planet. Uhura reckons that the Planet Taurus 2 is a class M planet with a oxygen, nitrogen atmosphere. But this planet is dead center of Murasaki 312. Kirk takes the Enterprise there. Meanwhile the Galileo has crashed on the planet, but has all instrumentation damaged. Spock knows that Enterprise will looks for them, but with the lionization effect of Murasaki, their instruments wont work.. And its a huge planet.

The Enterprise does reach the planet, but even the transporter beams wont work. Kirk sends shuttle-craft Columbus to search the surface. Scotty and Spock learn that the shuttle-craft has lost a lot of fuel and has no means of reaching escape velocity till it lightens its load by 500 pounds. Two red-shirts are killed by monsters (ape like, with primitive weapons) on the planet,and Mr Boma is arguing with Spock always, especially about the insanity of burying the dead, which Spock feels is a waste of when they are so near death themselves.

Scotty proposes to use power from the phasers to get the engines enough thrust to lift them into orbit, but that leaves the Galileo without any defenses. Meanwhile on Enterprise the crew gets the transporters to work, speeding up the search.

The yeoman and McCoy try to encourage him. In space, Kirk is pressured but will not relent to the authority of Ferris. Finally the ship must leave, but on impulse power only, by Kirk's order, with scanners directed to the rear. Yeoman Mears (Phyllis Douglas), Boma and the three irreplaceable crewmen finally lift off, having drained power from their phaser weapons, but it is too late. The ship has to use boosters to attain orbit and use up most of its fuel and so cant land back again. The Enterprise will not be able to see them. The jolt of the craft when coming through the atmosphere throws the yeoman to the floor. Then Spock ignites the fuel, the craft creates a red line, they are spotted and rescued, and Spock defends his decision to do something drastic as logical. Spock is very proud. And the whole crew laughs, including the yeoman, because they are happy and the lost red-shirts have been buried with ceremony."

Kirk, reaching toward him in concern, is as well. The ship receives old style western messages from the surface and know that there is life down there.

Spock dispatches a team of Jaeger (Richard Carlyle), McCoy and Desalle (Michael Barrier), wearing masks to defend against the noxious gases (as detected from the ships's sensors). Once below, Jaeger gives the OK to remove masks as the atmosphere is similar to Earth... The team enters a castle and sees Sulu and Kirk, who are frozen. Voila, here is Trelane (William Campbell), an effeminate dandy, dressed in frills and speaking like a woman. Trelane expresses himself in a fancy manner but his desires are for beauty, not relations. The team and the unfrozen Kirk and Sulu are beamed away by Spock on-board ship, who has been able to use the ship's sensors to figure out that Kirk and the other team members are on a specific part of the planet, seemingly able to support life.

But Trelane is not a pushover. He comes aboard the Enterprise & has the power to freeze the whole ship, and he does. Kirk is righteously upset, and beams more of his people down, including Spock who Trelane does not like. Spock says ""I object to power without discipline."" Trelane learns accidentally that there are women aboard, and transports two down. Uhura and Yeoman Teresa Ross, dressed in red with black leggings, her full blond hair kept above, and very young. Trelane changes her into Cinderella, complete with ball gown, and a strap from the foot of her white pearled dress attached to the wrist to prevent trailing during a dance. As Uhura is forced to play the harpsichord which she enjoys because she didn't know how previously, Trelane dances a minuet with Yeoman Ross. Kirk and Spock reason that Trelane knows all of Earth forms but none of its functions (food and wine are tasteless etc).. They reckon he has a machine that does all this for him.

Now Kirk has time to discover Trelane's power source, his large mirror, and he challenges Trelane to a duel. Trelane is distracted by the dance with Teresa Ross, who is smiling and enjoying dancing. Disturbed by Kirk's feigned jealousy, but seeing another fun opportunity, agrees. They each take a pistol, but Trelane claims the right to shoot first. He nobly fires into the ceiling. Kirk smiles knowingly, but fires at the mirror, Trelane gives a sharp look to Kirk. Clearly, he is displeased. The power is destroyed and all return to the ship. Yeoman Teresa Ross asks if she can change out of her Cinderella clothing. Kirk is embarrassed and blushing and says sheepishly yes.

Trelane is not that impotent. He follows the Enterprise on a collision course with the Planet. Kirk transports himself to Treland, as he sits above in judge's robes and wig. ""Did you really think that was ALL of my power, Captain?"" In desperation, Kirk challenges him to a royal hunt, with himself as the hunted, which extends the inevitable a few more minutes. Suddenly,Trelane's parents (disembodied voices) arrive to take him away from his toys (his predators) and apologize to Kirk for their son's interference. Kirk is back aboard and relieved. Finally he can relax. No one died, not the Yeoman or Uhura either. He tells Spock ""Trelane was a small boy."" The Enterprise is safe. Kirk has discovered that power and maturity do not always equate."

Cestus III is a remote earth outpost but well stocked with friends and other things, so Kirk is happy to beam down with Spock, and some others to enjoy the hospitality. But, They have beamed into a trap.

An alien race, the Gorn, a reptilian species who resemble large crocodiles with sharp fangs and beehive eyes, have completely destroyed every living thing. Kirk's friends are all dead. During a shootout, Kirk and the five crewmen try to plan strategy. They attack Gorn formations with mortar fire and force them to withdraw. Meanwhile the Gorn ship attacks the Enterprise in orbit. Sulu is in command and attacks the Gorn ship with Photon torpedoes. The Gorn have fled in their ship. Kirk is angry. His friends and his men are dead. ""We will chase them"" Kirk says. The Enterprise chases the Gorn ship, after beaming Kirk and his team from the surface, to an uncharted section of the galaxy. Kirk wants revenge for the loss of life of his crew.

Both the Enterprise and the Gorn ship are frozen in space. A powerful voice comes on the loudspeaker while an eerie light is throbbing. It says ""we cannot allow violence in our sector. we are the Metrons."" Kirk debates this until he is gone. The Metron voice explains. ""The two captains will fight and decide the fate of their ships."" Spock and everyone are stunned. Kirk and the Gorn ship captain are transported to an Asteroid, which has materials to build a weapon and attack each other. But they cannot communicate with their ships. The Gorn is over 7 feet tall and powerful. Now Kirk fears for his life. He tries to set a trap for the Gorn by throwing rocks on him and trying to stab him, but this is a monster. Kirk hesitates a moment before killing him. The Gorn hurts Kirk's leg and Kirk is limping. Because the Metrons are powerful and civilized, they allow the rest of the crew to see Kirk die and to prepare themselves as well for death. But Kirk is not out of ideas. And Spock sees it too on the video monitor. The Gorn calls Kirk on the communicator and says that humans were intruding in their space by building a colony on Cestus III. McCoy is intrigued to learn that humans may be in the wrong in this situation.

Kirk finds sulfur, diamonds, coal and other things to make gunpowder and a missile launcher. Now Kirk is about to die and he lights a piece of his uniform on fire as a match and uses his translator as a flint. The cannon goes off, the video goes blank on the ship. Kirk's cannon worked and the Gorn is almost completely unconscious. Kirk grabs the Gorn's knife and is ready to thrust it into its neck. Then Kirk throws away the knife and says to himself ""I won't kill you."" Then he yells at the sky. ""I won't kill him. The Gorn thought they were defending their sector. I won't kill him for you"". The Gorn of course is almost dead anyway. Now Kirk relaxes waiting for the Metrons to kill them all. But they do not.

A Metron appears in a glistening shimmer. A young man, with blond hair, wearing a thin wispy robe, appears. He says ""Why didn't you kill the Gorn?"" And Kirk says ""Maybe he was right in the fight. I don't know,"" The Metron says ""You showed mercy. maybe you are worth having in the universe."" Kirk smiles. The Metron says ""In all honesty, I will kill the Gorn and his ship if you wish."" Kirk says ""No, we will work it out."" Then Kirk is back on the ship. Spock says ""What did the Metron say?"" And Kirk says to Spock ""He said we were a very promising species. Did you know that?"" Spock says ""I had my doubts."" Then Kirk and all the human crew begin laughing including the yeomen."

All systems are down and they are reduced to impulse power only. Uhura cannot contact Starfleet but picks up a general radio frequency that talks about the manned moonshot attempt in 3 days time. The Enterprise has traveled back in time to the 1960's. They have to get back. But the US Air Force saw them, and sent one fast interceptor plane to see what they are. Sulu is trying to get the Enterprise into orbit using impulse power. The plane is ordered to intercept the UFO and forced it to land, or disable it enough, so that it cant escape till the other planes arrive.

One of the pilots is Captain Christopher (Roger Perry). He is a good man with a wife. But his ship is too close to the Enterprise and Kirk starts the tractor beam on him to prevent him from firing, and he is about to explode (as the plane is too fragile to withstand the tractor beam), until Kirk beams him on board. Now Captain Christopher knows everything about the future, and he could destroy the world. But Kirk can't kill him to silence him.

Spock says to Kirk ""You can't let him go back."" But then the pilot, Captain Christopher, says ""I have a wife."" Spock looks in the History book, and he tells Kirk that Captain Christopher did absolutely nothing important in his whole life, so they CAN keep him, because taking him would not change History. Kirk is happy about that, because he didn't want to kill him. Spock looks at the rest of the book, and guess what? Captain Christopher's future son (who hasn't been conceived yet) changed the world like you would not believe. His son will be the leader of the first expedition to Saturn.

So now they can't keep him OR kill him, they have to put him back. Also, by the way, his airplane took pictures of the Enterprise (which are now stored in the Air Force library), so first things first, Kirk needs those pictures back. They don't know the way around the Air Force library on the base. Kirk and Sulu get down to the Airforce base and retrieve the recordings, but are apprehended by a guard. The guard takes their communicators and accidentally presses the emergency signal. He is beamed up immediately by Spock. Now they have 2 problems. Meanwhile Kirk and Sulu's activities trigger the security alarms on base and security guards move into position to intercept them. Sulu is able to beam up, but Kirk is arrested by the other security personnel on the base, before he is able to escape. Spock confers with Christopher, who offers to help Spock rescue Kirk.

Spock rescues Kirk with Christopher guiding him, but then Christopher tries to escape, but Spock recaptures him and everyone returns to the Enterprise. The plan is to slingshot around the sun and go back in time, even before they first appeared in the Earth sky. Then break free of the sun and propel forward in time, putting the guard and Christopher in their places at the exact time they were picked by the Enterprise.

Now it is very tricky, but they finally get Christopher transported back inside his plane at the exact moment that he thought he saw the Enterprise. Now the Enterprise has to use a special technique to get themselves back home. It is scary and several yeomen fall down during the turbulence, but they get back home safe and sound."

""You killed my father."" she screams. This is the daughter of Ben Finney. Her name is Jamie (Alice Rawlings), and her hair is in braids and she is crying. The Commodore arrests Kirk after he ascertains from the computer logs that Kirk jettisoned the pod before going to red alert.

Kirk knew Finney as an instructor at the academy. They were both assigned to the same ship, when Finney made a mistake, which Kirk found and corrected, and saved the ship, which otherwise would have blown. Finney was reprimanded and demoted. During the storm, Kirk had assigned Finney to the pod, as it was his turn. Kirk went first to yellow and then to red alert. Finney couldn't return in time and Kirk jettisoned the pod. But the computer recording shows that Kirk was still on Yellow alert.

Kirk meets an old romantic friend, Areel Shaw (Joan Marshall). Areel works here at the Starbase as an ensign-lawyer. Kirk still likes her, but now he has a ship and she is a lawyer, so they only meet to kiss sometimes and talk. Areel is the prosecuting attorney on Kirk's case The trial begins. There is a panel of four judges. The main judge is African and the other three are Indian, Caucasian and a female. Areel Shaw is at the prosecution table. Kirk sits at the defense table with Sam Cogley, an eccentric man who relies on books, not computers, for his knowledge of the case. Areel calls Dr. McCoy. She says ""Doctor, would you consider yourself an expert in space psychology?"" McCoy says ""I suppose so."" ""Suppose, hypothetically, that crewman A resented Captain B, and showed it. Wouldn't Captain B begin to hate Crewman A back?"" McCoy agrees

Then Areel calls Mr Spock. Spock states that it is impossible for Kirk to jettison the pod without the red alert. He states that the computer is wrong. Now Cogley looks straight into Kirk's eyes. ""Captain Kirk, you recall jettisoning the pod during the ion storm."" Kirk says ""I do."" Cogley continues ""Do you swear that you jettisoned the pod after and not before the red alert?"" Kirk looks directly at Cogley. ""It was after the red alert."" Areel looks sad. ""It gives me no pleasure to do this your honor, but will the computer record please be played. The taped record is played on the view-screen. There is a closeup on Kirk's control panel on his Captain's chair. The alert light is yellow, not red. Then his finger ejects the pod. Kirk look amazed at the screen. ""But that's not the way it happened.""

Spock is confused. He transports quickly to the ship and plays several quick games of three dimensional chess with the computer, then beams back down. The trial is ending. Areel Shaw says ""That is the prosecution's case, your honor."". Suddenly, Spock bursts into the courtroom and rushes to Cogley and whispers to him. Cogley states that The greatest documents which have formed all the laws since the beginning of time. The Bible, the Codes of Hammurabi and Justinian, the Constitution of the United States, the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies, the Codes of Alpha III. Can you condemn a man based on a computer record?"" ""What would you have us do, Mr. Cogley?"" Cogley say loudly ""I want to question the prime witness against my client. The computer.""

Now it is several minutes later, the crew of the ship has been beamed down, and only the four judges, Areel, Cogley, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the transporter chief are aboard. McCoy uses a white-sound masking device to block the sounds of the heartbeats of those on the bridge, which are thumping on the loudspeaker. Meanwhile, Cogley questions Spock. ""Mr. Spock, you beamed up to the ship during the trial. Why?"" Spock responds ""I could not believe the Captain would act out of spite or malice. I wanted to check the computer. I played several games of 3-D chess."" ""What was the result?' Cogley asks. ""I won all the games. This is impossible. The computer's program must have been altered.""

Cogley asks ""Who would have the knowledge to effect such a change?"" Spock replies calmly ""Myself, or the records officer."" ""And at the moment, you have no records officer."" Spock says ""True. Until the accident, the records officer was Benjamin Finney. By now, McCoy has masked all the heartbeats. Cogley says ""Now mask the heartbeat of the transporter chief on the transporter deck. It is done. There is still one heartbeat, pulsing, over the loudspeaker. The black judge listens and it dawns on him ""Finney!""

Kirk and Spock go below decks to find Finney. He had faked his own death to discredit Kirk. He always held secret hatred for Kirk since his younger days when Kirk logged an error Finney had made on another ship. They find him in the engine room, looking like a madman, holding a phaser pistol. ""You found me, but it's too late, I've shut off your engines. The Enterprise will crash into the planet, you'll all die."" Kirk says ""Including your daughter Jasmie. She's been beamed aboard."" Finney screams ""WHY would you do that!!"" He is knocked unconscious by Spock. And he babbles the pieces of the engine he removed. They are saved.

Kirk and Areel are standing together now on the bridge before the Enterprise is leaving for its next mission. She tells him Cogley is defending Finney, and she hopes he'll win. THen she gives a sweet smile and asks Kirk ""Do you think it would cause a breach of discipline if a lowly ensign 'kissed' a Captain on the bridge of his ship?"" Kirk says ""Let's find out."" He kisses her romantically. Spock raises an eyebrow, as usual."

During ""Red Hour"" you can go crazy, and are allowed to tear off other people's clothes and do anything you like, and you may hit them with sticks or kill them. What would happen?

Guess What? The Enterprise will discover it.

First, Sulu and a redshirt are below on the planet, investigating.

Many years before, a ship named Archon visited the planet, but no one returned from the mission. Sulu and the redshirt are about to find out why. They are in danger, trying to beam up as quickly as possible. The redhirt says ""There's no time"" so he runs off, Sulu has used his communicator and asked for immediate beam-up, but one second before he escapes, there is a lawgiver, who looks like the Future Ghost in Scrooge, who taps him with his staff, which is bamboo and hollow, but with immense power.

Now Sulu is beamed up, and Kirk is in the transporter room with the others, and is amazed, because Sulu has a silly smile on his face like a girl, and looks at the ceiling and says ""Peace be to you. brethren"" and Kirk looks at him for a long time, and says ""take him below.""

Now they must find out what the heell went on down there, and rescue the redshirt, and slap Sulu out of it. They beam down and meet Reger, a scared man, like a rabbit. Reger has a daughter who is beautiful and wears a red velvet dress. Kirk says ""what happened?"" and Reger says ""Quiet. Landru will hear you."" And Reger looks up at the ceiling, he is scared of Landru, whoever he is. Kirk looks baffled. ""Who the hell is Landru.""

Wait!! Landru is a ""god"" from the planet. He invented the ""Red Hour."" His theory was that if you bottle up your feelings all day, you need The Red Hour to release them. The only trouble is, people get hurt and killed and raped, usually you or someone you love. Reger's daughter, anyone could be.

The crew find out from Reger that there is a resistance to Landru's rule, and they work in threes, but they work in threes, and do not know who each other are. There is an old fogey man who says to Reger ""Let your daughter outside during Red Hour. She is young."" Reger does not want to let his daughter out into the street. And a redshirt who is attracted to Reger's daughter also says no.

Then, Guess What? Red Hour starts and people get raped and beaten. Kirk has had enough.

He finds the computer lab, but all except he and Spock are absorbed. Kirk is held by two lawgivers and brought into the absorbtion room but the old man working the controls tells the Lawgivers to take a break, that he will see to Kirk's absorption. After the lawgivers leave to go and get Spock, the man at the controls says ""Hush, I am with the resistance. I was the third in Reger's team. My name is Marplon."" He is still scared of Landru. Kirk says ""Where is the damn computer room?"" As Spock is brought in by the lawgivers, Kirk hits one and Spock nerve-pinches the other so they are unconscious.

Kirk and Spock are led by a frightened Marplon into the computer room. They see Landru's face on a video on the wall and hear his frightening voice, but WAIT. it is a computer voice. Landru is fake. Kirk says ""I am going to pull the plug on him."" He explodes a hole in the wall with his phaser, and there is the computer inside the room behind, still talking nonstop. He cannot shoot it, the computer has a self defense screen. But he will outTHINK it.

He says ""Landru, you are for the good of the body?"" Landru says yes, the good of the body must be preserved. Kirk says ""The body is dying. Young girls are being raped and beaten. How is that good for the body?"" Landru does not know, and in his confusion, he explodes. Spock says to Kirk ""Logical. Flawlessly logical."" Now it is time to gather up the crew to go to the ship. Sulu is back to normal, do not worry. Reger's daughter is fine too. Wow."

Now this ship contains a super human race of our fellow earthlings. They are the best of the best. Physically strong, or beautiful if you are a female. They went into space on a ""sleeper ship"" which would make them hibernate for a long time.

The leader is Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban). His sleeping capsule is designed to open as soon as someone comes on board. This way he could check, and go back to sleep in case they are hostile. Kirk beams over with a medical team, Khan's chamber is powered, and he is choking. McCoy says ""take him out or he dies."" Another member of the team Marla (Madlyn Rhue), who is an expert on humans from our time, says ""He is magnificent"" and she bites her lower lip, which is a sign that she likes him already.

The Botany Bay was a penal colony in Australia. Kirk and McCoy reckon that the ship contained a superior breed of humans who left Earth after the Eugenics war (in the 1990's), whose sole purpose was to develop a new species of humans by genetic engineering. Spock figures out that in the 1990's a superior breed did gain power in 40 nations, but superior breed gave rise to superior ambition and the takeover failed. After the war ended 80-90 specimens of this breed went missing. Spock reckons, this is what the Botany Bay carried.

Kirk allows McCoy to save him, and they beam him back. So now Khan is lying down in sickbay. Then he hides a knife, and when McCoy comes in to check on him to see if he is alright, he holds the knife up to McCoy's throat and grabs his head. ""One quick motion and you will be dead."" McCoy is sweating but he says as cool as ever ""It would be more effective if you cut the carotid artery, right below the left earlobe."" There is a pause. Then Khan laughs and drops the knife.

Now Khan is getting along but avoids Kirk's questions on the nature of his mission & the date of his liftoff, and the Captain invites him to dinner. Spock keeps asking Khan questions and bothering him, while Kirk watches. What they found out was that Khan and his people were designed to take over the world. This explains their large muscular frames and superior minds. The women were to be breeding stock for a superhuman race. Now Khan has to impress and seduce Marla, because he needs help to capture the ship. She visits him and he starts to kiss her, she resists, and he throws her to the ground. ""Go. Or Stay!. But do it because it is what you WISH to do."" She is crying and says "":I want to stay."" He says ""Now you must beg me to stay."" She says ""I'm begging you."" So he grabs her arm and says ""I need your to help me take over the ship."" She says no, so he twists it. She says alright.

Khan beams over all of the muscular men and beautiful women on his crew and the Enterprise is taken over. Khan takes over Engineering and cuts off oxygen supply to the bridge, till everyone collapses and is captured by Khan's men. Kirk is in an air pressure chamber with the pressure going to zero. Khan wants the crew to join him and help him conquer a planet, in exchange for Kirk's life. Marla finally gets some strength of will and saves Kirk, then Kirk saves Spock, then the crew is free, but Khan is loose. Kirk finds him in the engine room and he must kill him because Khan is blowing up the engines. Kirk takes a pipe and beats Khan on the back one, two, THREE times until Khan is knocked out. Now Kirk saves the ship.

Finally, Khan is on trial. Kirk says ""we can take you back to prison, or you can go down to the planet below and start a new world. it is green and there are animals. Khan says ""Do you know your Milton, Captain?"" ""I see"" says Kirk, and they are sent to the green planet. Scotty says ""I don't know John Milton, Captain."" Kirk says ""It is a quote from Paradise Lost by John Milton. Better to reign in Hell than Serve in Heaven. Kirk is happy that Khan, Marla (who decided to marry Khan) and all of the enemies are away safely on a deserted planet, and Khan is happy that he is still the ruler."

She dresses in a flowing sheer garment. Her planet is called Eminiar. They are neighbors with a planet nearby called Vendikar. Very nice planets with nice buildings and beautiful, well-dressed people. The Enterprise is taking a trip and comes nearby Eminiar. They get a radio warning saying to get out. Enterprise is carrying Ambassador Fox (Gene Lyons) who tells Kirk that the Federation has lost many soldiers in the quadrant due to the lack of galactic port here. He tells Kirk to disregard the message and proceed to Eminiar VII.

Kirk decides to beam down with a landing party. Himself, Spock, two red-shirts and a very beautiful Japanese Yeoman named Yeoman Tamula (Miko Mayama) beam down. When they arrive on Eminiar, They meet Mea, and Kirk looks her over. Mea has a mean look. She says ""Captain, you should not have come. You are in danger. We are at war."" Kirk says, ""Mea, the buildings are all here. You cannot have been at war too long'. The leader of the planet Anan VII (David Opatoshu) says that Eminiar are at war with Vendikar, the 3rd planet in their system.

Anan invites Kirk to the war room. Guess What? It's a computer room with lights and sounds. They're fighting by computer. Anan explains that attacks are launched mathematically, as per a mutual agreement between the warring nations, to protect the civilization, but to simulate the effects of the attack people impacted walk into a disintegration chamber. People follow this edict with a sense of duty. Meanwhile, a tall blond American-type man comes in and whispers to Anan. Anan immediately orders security guards to surround all of them, including Tamula.

Anan says, ""we warned you. it's too late. Your ship is a casualty of war, all of your men are dead."", but when Kirk checks in with Scotty, the Enterprise is well. Anan gives Kirk's men 24 hrs to report to the disintegration chambers, as their death is also simulated. When Kirk refuses to order his men to surrender the ship, Anan locks them up

Anan is using a fake voice machine to speak like Jim, and to tell Scotty to beam everyone down. Scotty is listening. he is temporarily in command and sitting in the Captain's chair. Scotty compares the voice with a sample of Kirk and the computer says its a fake. Meanwhile, Spock tricked the guard (using a mind meld) and the guard unlocked the door to check, and gave him a neck pinch to knock him out. As they escape, Kirk grabs Mea, who is headed to the disintegration chamber, as she was also declared a casualty in the last attack. Kirk destroys the disintegration chamber.

Kirk asks Mea to take him to Anan's chambers, who has just ordered an attack on the Enterprise with real weapons. Fox stops Scotty from attacking the planet and open a channel with Anan. Anan invites Fox down to the planet, but his real intention is to blow up the Enterprise as soon as its screens are lowered to allow transported function. Scotty refuses to lower the screen in defiance to Fox.

Kirk reaches Anan's cabin with the help of Mea. Kirk is captured by Anan's guards. In the melee, Anan is distracted and Fox beams down to the planet. Spock gets a communicator and speaks to Scotty and learns Fox has beamed down. He saves Fox from being fried in a disintegration chamber. ""Captain"" Anan yells ""If you do not let us disintegrate our casualties, Vendikar will have no choice but to start using real weapons, and both planets and all their people, will be destroyed. You will be destroying two planets."" .. Spock arrives with Fox and rescues Kirk. Kirk and Spock fire their phasers into the entire computer and it is obliterated. Kirk asks Anan to talk peace with Vendikar. Ambassador Fox offers to be the negotiator between the 2 civilizations.

Anan is still angry, but he looks at Fox and says ""Maybe we can do it. We will try."" Spock debates with Kirk that he took a big chance by destroying the computer. Kirk argues that Eminians were killed 3 MM people a yr for 500 yrs. Even an actual attack wouldn't kill more people and it would reduce their ability to wage war.. hence it was a calculated gamble to get them to talk peace."

(This is someone who specializes in the science of plants).

Many years ago she met Mr Spock and fell in love with him, but he was a Vulcan, and could not feel love for her. So they parted.

Now, guess what? The Enterprise is sent to Omicron Ceti III, because the planet has been bombarded with rays and everyone is surely dead, including animals and women. There was a scientific team down there. But when they beam down, someone yells at them. It is Elias Sandoval, a very smart scientist from Earth. ""What the hell?"" Kirk says. ""How is he alive""?

They are all alive, but not animals. How? Then Leila comes into the room where Kirk is meeting with Sandoval.. Spock sees her and is surprised. Leila says ""Let's go for a walk."" She looks so happy. They go out to the fields.

Sandoval is explaining to Kirk that they don't want to leave because they are happy. Kirk says ""Damn all, you must leave. It is orders.""

So now Leila is with Mr Spock and she shows him plants called ""The Spores"". The Spores have always been on Omicron Ceti III. When they shoot their seeds in your face, you become happy forever. When the spores shoot at Mr Spock, he begins to choke. Leila is upset. She cries. ""It's not supposed to hurt."" Spock is in awful pain. ""I am not like you. I am Vulcan. I am not supposed to be happy.""

Finally he stops choking and he looks up at the sky and smiles a big smile. What the hell? Then he looks at Leila. He says ""You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of love I ever imagined."" She smiles. Now they can kiss and have fun.

Meanwhile, Kirk is upset because Mr Spock is not answering his communicator. Finally he comes to the field with Sulu and DeSalle and sees Spock playing in a tree. What the hell? He says ""Mr Spock, you did not answer the communicator."" Spock says ""I didn't want to, Jim. Here, let me show you,"" He brings all three to the spores, and they shoot, but they miss Kirk. But Sulu and DeSalle become happy. Kirk says ""I will stop this.""

But now McCoy is infected and beams spores up to the Enterprise. Kirk beams up and sees that everyone is lining up to beam down. He stops a crewman who is a rebel. I order you to go back to your post. The crewman says ""No."" Kirk says ""This is mutiny, Mister."" The crewman gives him a look and says ""Yes sir, it is.""

Now Kirk is alone on the ship. If he leaves the ship will crash out of orbit. A spore plant that was hidden behind the console, suddenly explodes on him. He smiles. He calls Mr Spock on the communicator. ""I belong now, he says. I'm coming down."" Spock, his best friend, smiles ""Good. See you at the beamdown point.""

Kirk goes to his cabin to get his things. He picks up a container with three medals and snaps it shut. He is mad that he is abandoning his ship. As he sets the controls to beam down and abandon the Enterprise, he slams his fist three times. ""I ... Won't ... Go."" then he shakes. He expelled the spores from his body.

Now he has to think. Angry emotion gets rid of the spores. He calls Spock. ""Mr Spock, we can't come back later, so could you help me carry some things?"" Spock says ok and beams up. Kirk has a big pipe in his hands, but Spock is very strong. LOOK OUT. Spock is standing there and Kirk says ""You half-breed. You have the nerve to love that girl!! You belong in the circus, by the dog faced boy.""

Spock swings a punch, Kirk ducks, Spock is about to kill Kirk, then the spores are expelled. Kirk talks to him like a friend, but Spock is sad that he can't be in love. But back to work. Spock creates a buzzer in the airwaves that will make everyone angry and expel the spores. Leila asks on the communicator can she see him. He says ok, but she knows as soon as she kisses him he is not the same. She cries ""I love you Mr Spock. What is your first name?"" he says ""You couldn't pronounce it.""

Now everyone on the planet gets angry and fights, even the fancy scientist, and they are all saved from the spores. Wow."

The miners on a subterranean planet leave a man named Schmitter in charge of watching for the monster who has been killing miners.

Schmitter hears noises and he is scared. He screams, and the miners run back. Schmitter has been burned to a crisp, and he is dead. The monster disintegrated him with acid. It is too late to save him, but they send a subspace message to the Enterprise, which is nearby.

Kirk and Spock meet officially with Chief Vandeberg, an old man with white hair, and Ed Appel, a tall angry miner.

Kirk asks for a report from Vanderberg, who tells Kirk that the miners drilled into a new pocket of Pergium, a valuable ore, and suddenly men began dying. Spock is distracted, and holding a bronze globe. He asks ""What is this?"" Vanderberg says ""That is just something we found in the mine. Get down to business.""

Meanwhile, Guess What? The monster has crippled the air system by burning it with acid. Now they only have a few hours of air left, while Scotty is trying to make repairs. The Enterprise tries to evacuate all of the miners, but a few, including Ed Appel, refuse to leave, and arm themselves with sticks and clubs as extra security, under the watchful eye of Enterprise Security Chief Giotto, a tall officer who means business.

Kirk and Spock walk follow a tunnel, which splits into two paths. They each take one.

Kirk comes into a mine. He tells Spock on the communicator. Spock says ""Captain, stay there."" Kirk hears a noise. The wall in front of him is burned with acid. There is the 'Horta', a lava-like mass of ugliness that slithers on the floor, and is as big as four men. Kirk lifts his phaser and points it at the Horta. Earlier, The Horta was shot by a phaser, and it remembers the pain. It backs off.

Every time Kirk raises his phaser, the Horta backs up. Kirk is talking to Spock on the communicator. ""It doesn't seem to be harmful, Mr Spock. ""I am hurrying to get to you Captain. This creature has killed several miners."" Spock arrives and the two of them decide that Spock must use the Vulcan Mind-Meld, and mentally connect with the creature.

Kirk says to Giotto on the communicator ""Keep those men there. No one gets by."" Kirk also calls the Enterprise and asks McCoy to beam down to heal the wound. McCoy does.

Spock is hearing the thoughts of the Horta. His face is in pain. ""The Children. The Children."" Spock is in a trance. McCoy is trying to figure out how to heal a creature made of silicon, which is mineral. Kirk goes to the next cavern and sees 1000 silicon globes, like Spock was holding in the office. What the hell?

He comes back in to Spock, McCoy and the Horta. ""Spock, what did the Horta tell you?"" says Kirk. Spock replies ""At first nothing but incredible pain. Your phaser hurt it badly. This Horta is the last of its kind.""

""And the silicon nodules?"" asks Kirk. Suddenly, the miners with clubs break past Commender Giotto. They are an angry mob now. Kirk holds the phaser up ""First men to move gets some of this."" Ed Appel says ""That monster killed 20 of our men."" Kirk yells ""And you killed 1000 of her children. There are very few left.""

So here is the story. The Horta was the ""Mother"" of all of these nodules. The nodules are baby Hortas.

Vanderberg says ""What happens when these things start hatching?""

Kirk says ""Then they will make more tunnels for you, which means more Pergium and more money.""

Vanderberg and Appel stop yelling. Kirk says ""But the Horta may die."" McCoy suddenly shouts ""It won't die. I healed it. I believe I can work miracles. I had Scotty beam down concrete and i patched the hole.""

Once the crew are back on the Enterprise, Vanderberg calls and says all is well. Do not mess with Mothers. They are fiery when it comes to their children. Wow. All is resolved."

The people are moving around like sheep, as if nothing has happened. Kirk and Spock go to see the council, while Sulu is in charge on the ship (with orders to retreat if attacked by the Klingon fleet). The council is led by Ayelbourne (John Abbott), an old man who speaks peacefully and gently. Kirk argues that Organia side with the Federation since Klingon is a military dictatorship and life under their rule will be very unpleasant. They organize defenseless planets such as Organia into slave labor camps. Ayelbourne says that they are not in danger, but Kirk and his ship is. Spock tells Kirk that Organian society is arrested in time and has no intellectual advancement in many thousands of years.

The Klingon fleet arrives and Sulu buggers out after informing Kirk. Ayelbourne changes Kirk and Spock into local clothing to protect their identity as Federation officers. Ayelbourne takes away their phasers and refuses to return them. The Klingons beam down. Kirk and Spock are dressed like the Organian people. Kor (John Colicos), the commander of the Klingons, says ""Who are these two."" Kirk poses as a Organian citizen and Spock as a Vulcan trader. Kor says ""I like this one. He has spirit. Not like you sheep."" Kor publishes many new rules for the Organians to follow. Kirk and Spock sneak out on a night mission and set bombs in the ammunition dumps of the Klingons. Ayelbourne implores Kirk never to use violence again, But Kirk again begs Ayelbourne to resist the Klingon rule. Kor had overheard everything (plus when accosted, Ayelbourne reveals Kirk's real identity to Kor) and throws Kirk and Spock into a dungeon. Kirk thinks Organians are plain cowards. That night Ayelbourne rescues Kirk and Spock as the Klingons wanted to do violence to them.. Kor executes many Organians. Kirk says to Ayelbourne ""Don't you care?"" Ayelbourne says ""Only their bodies are dead. It is you who must leave. We do care deeply about you."" Kirk wants his phasers to be returned to fight the Klingons

Ayelbourne says to them ""I have your phasers & communicators. Now please leave before you are hurt."" Kirk says to Spock ""Can we get to Kor?"" Spock says ""The odds are 7824.7 to 1."" Kirk laughs. ""Let's improve our odds"". They do get to Kor and there is a standoff in the Klingon headquarters. Kor informs Kirk that a Federation fleet is en-route to Organia and Klingons will fight. Kirk is talking to Sulu by communicator. ""Get ready to fire on the Klingon ship, Sulu."" The Klingons are about to fire too. Kirk, Spock, the Klingons on the planet are all holding guns. But then the guns become hot, and they all have to drop them. On the ship, Sulu says ""Captain, the instruments to fire are too hot to handle."" Then Ayelbourne and the council walk in.

Ayelbourne says ""Gentlemen, I cannot have you commit violence against each other. You are disarmed. Now make peace.""What gives you the right"" says Kirk ""to tell our Federation."" ""Or our Empire"" Kor says. Kirk continues ""Not to fight??"" Ayelbourne says ""Gentlemen, begone, your presence disturbs me."" ..

The Enterprise was studying a barren planet, which suddenly now shows a sign of a single life form. The life form appeared with the energy surge. The Federation thinks that this blinking means that there will be an invasion. furthermore they withdraw all ships within a 100 parsecs of the Enterprise as the blinking originated from the area Enterprise is patrolling, but impacted every quadrant of the galaxy and much more beyond.

Kirk beams down and finds there is a small ship, and up on the mountain is a tall man named Lazarus (Robert Brown), taller than any of them. He tells them to run away, he runs down the mountain and falls off. His head is bleeding badly. They beam back up. The assistant engineer, Lt Masters (Janet MacLachlan), an African woman with very short black hair, very serious but beautiful, is concerned about the engines. The surge drained the Dilithium crystals and this could mean trouble for the engines.

Lazarus meanwhile is hurt and has a bandage. He tells Kirk to kill the beast below. This beast, as Lazarus calls him, will destroy the universe (as it has killed every man, woman and child in his own civilization). Lazarus says he escaped his home planet in his ship and has been chased by the beast to the current planet. Now each time the landing party beams down and beams back up (with Lazarus), Lazarus seems different. Sometimes he is wearing the bandage, sometimes not, sometimes calm, sometimes insane. Every time Lazarus seems to change, the change is accompanies by the celestial event and the energy surge.. The calm version has the bandage and the insane version doesn't.

Spock detects a radiation on the planet's surface, but no source. He thinks its a rip in our physical universe. Lazarus wants control of the ship's Dilithium crystals to destroy the beast. The insane version steals the crystals and the calm version of Lazarus asks Kirk to find his enemy to find the crystals. Kirk confronts the calm version and says that there is no planet at the location where he says he comes from. Calm Lazarus admits that he is a time traveler. Spock theorizes that the ship's instruments are designed to measure all energy and matter in this universe. The fact that the source and energy of the radiation cant be detected means it is not from the current Universe, but a parallel one. And the beast is nothing but the negative self of Lazarus from the parallel anti-universe. If these two matter and anti-matter meet, then there will be total destruction of everything.

Lazarus steals the Dilithium crystals and beams to the surface. Lt Masters has got the engines under control. Kirk beams down and goes into the ship after the calm Lazarus. He is transported to an alternate universe because the little ship is a door to the other universe. In the other universe, Kirk meets the calm Lazarus who says that he is from the parallel universe. Some yrs ago his people figured out how to travel from one universe to the other, which involves crossing a threshold. But the Lazarus from Kirk's Universe couldn't handle this truth, and referred to his mirror Image as the beast. The insane Lazarus wants to use the Dilithium crystals to travel to the parallel universe to kill his mirror image, not realizing that he will destroy the universe in the process. The sane Lazarus asks Kirk to push the insane Lazarus into the threshold, where the sane one will be waiting. He will hold the insane Lazarus while Kirk destroys the ship in his own Universe. This will destroy the ship in both universes and both Lazarus's will be stuck in the Threshold for eternity. This is the only way to solve the issue.

Kirk agrees. He goes through the portal and tricks and pushes the other Lazarus onto the little ship, then the first Lazarus enters from his side and blows up the ship. The two are trapped forever in limbo, fighting each other."

Sulu is badly hurt at his helm station, McCoy prepares to administer an important drug called Cordrazine. ""A few drops can save your life."" says McCoy. Just then, another shock wave hits, and McCoy accidentally injects the drug into his own arm (the entire hypo-spray). McCoy has become a madman, and is running around like crazy. He punches a guard, and beams himself down to the planet.

Of course, they must try to rescue him. Kirk, Spock, Scott, Uhura and two red-shirts (security) beam down after him. When they arrive on the rocky planet, they see a large arched gateway with shimmering rocks. There are rocks all around, and McCoy is hiding behind one. Spock gives him a neck pinch to put him temporarily to sleep. The arch speaks in a dark, forbidding voice. ""A QUESTION!! SINCE BEFORE YOUR SUN BURNED HOT I HAVE AWAITED A QUESTION."" The arch then 'says' that it is the Guardian of Forever. It displays scenes from world history within the semi-circle of its arch, ranging from Egypt, to Palestine, to Rome, to modern day, and keeps showing them in a loop. ""The Guardian"" says they can travel to anywhere in the past they wish. Spock (finally) turns on his tri-corder. Uhura is in contact with the ship (to prepare for when they need to beam up).

McCoy wakes up, pushes the two guards aside, jumps into the arch, and vanishes. Uhura says ""Captain, I've lost contact with the ship."" They all check their communicators, and have nothing but dead air. The Guardian says slowly, ""All that you knew is gone."" Kirk is confused. Spock theorizes that McCoy must have changed history, when he arrived in the past. Now they must rescue him. Only Kirk and Spock will go to find the solution and rescue McCoy and the Universe. Kirk says ""If we fail to correct the damage McCoy did, all of you must jump in. You will be alive at least in the past. Uhura says ""Captain, I'm scared"". Kirk comforts her. Spock times the 'jump' with his tri-corder and they both jump in.

They are back in 1930's Earth in New York, during the Great Depression of the 1930's. Everyone is poor. They steal some earth clothes to 'hide out' and duck into a basement running from a cop. Someone asks from the top of the stairs ""Who is there?"" They say ""We just wanted to get warm."" The woman coming down the stairs is beautiful, like an angel. She is a social worker with big ideas, very, very pretty, and Kirk is attracted to her. She gives Kirk and Spock a job at 15 cents an hour, and Spock tries to build a computer using copper wire and other cheap material. He says to Kirk ""You are asking me to assemble a mini computer using the equivalent of stone knives and bearskins."" Spock explains that they cannot determine whether McCoy arrived before or after their 'jump.' But during the time before McCoy comes, Kirk is falling in love with Edith Keeler (Joan Collins). Spock finally assembles enough data to examine newspaper articles from the time to show the two different time-lines that would occur, and that Mccoy somehow changed. It turns out that the focal point is Edith Keeler. In the first time-line, Edith becomes the head of a peace movement that grows to such size that it stalls the US entry into WWII, but when she did, she unwittingly let Nazi Germany take over the world. But in the other, she is struck by a truck that very week. Spock concludes that for the Universe to be set right, Edith Keeler must die.

Kirk says to Spock ""Spock I believe I am falling in love with Edith Keeler. Spock says ""Jim, in order for the Universe to be saved, we need to stop McCoy from somehow saving her. Edith Keeler must die as it actually happened."" McCoy lands on the street in the middle of the night, and is still woozy from the Cordrazine. He loses his phaser pistol and a bum picks it up and accidentally phasers himself to disintegration. The next night Kirk is taking Edith to the movies. Edith says ""I have been dying to see the latest Clark Gable movie. ""Who?"" asks Kirk. Edith says ""You know Doctor McCoy said the same thing today"" (McCoy had walked into Edith's mission on 21st street for a cup of coffee). Kirk says ""Who?? Where?"" ""He's in the mission, she says. ""Wait here"" says Kirk. He runs across the street to the Mission. McCoy runs out and Spock too. They're reunited.

Then Edith starts to cross the street. Kirk looks and sees a big truck coming. He begins to go after her. Spock says ""No, Jim."" Then McCoy jumps toward Edith, and Kirk grabs him, and holds him back. The truck kills Edith. She is dead. McCoy looks with horror at Kirk. ""Do you realize what you just did, Jim?"" Spock says calmly, ""He knows, Doctor, he knows."" They are returned by the Guardian to the planet."

A mysterious mass insanity phenomenon has been sweeping the galaxy in a straight line, infecting system after system and its heading straight for Deneva now. There is no known medical or scientific cause for this phenomenon. Jim Kirk's brother Sam lives there. Sam is married. His real name is George Samuel Kirk. Only Jim calls him Sam. Sam lives with his lovely wife Aurelan (Joan Swift) who is tall with dark hair worn up and his son Peter (Craig Huxley), who is about 10 years old. Jim is looking forward to seeing Sam. Deneva was colonized over a century ago and is one of the most beautiful planets in the galaxy. The federation is using Deneva to run supplies to the miners in the asteroid belt and bringing cargo out. Deneva has had no Federation contact for over a yr.

But as the Enterprise is approaching Deneva, they encounter a small spaceship which is headed on a direct course to the Denevan sun. They intercept the pilot's radio message. He sounds insane. Moments before the Enterprise's tractor beam can capture his ship and pull him to safety, he screams out on the radio ""I'm free. Its finally gone now."" Then his ship is burned up by the sun. They quickly beam down and discover Sam. Sam is dead, and everyone who is still alive is crazy. McCoy examines one of the insane citizens and says that their nervous system is being violently stimulated.

Kirk and the landing party find Aurelan and Peter, but they are insane too. They beam back and after medical help, Aurelan says that ""things"" arrived on Deneva on a ship 8 months ago and since then its been chaos and horror. The things made the crew to bring them to Deneva. She screams in pain and says the Things are forcing them to build ships for them to spread further in the Universe. McCoy says that Aurelan is resisting something every time she answers a question. Eventually, she passes out from the pain.

There are jellyfish type creatures all over (who cannot be killed by phaser power), Suddenly one flies off a wall and sticks to Spock's back. Spock fights through his insanity, and even tries to take over the ship. Eventually, Spock is able to control the pain in his mind, but is not allowed to return to the bridge. These creatures attack the brain and the nervous system. They leave tentacle like structures inside the body and removing them surgically can endanger the life of their host. Spock uses his Vulcan mind control to block out the pain and comes out of sick bay. He wants to beam down but is stopped by Scotty, and Scotty summons Kirk to the transporter room. Spock says to Kirk that they must capture one alien specimen and Spock says that he is the logical choice to capture one since he is already infected.

So he beams down with a grabber and captures a creature to put in a jar. They examine it on the ship & looks like an algae, single brain cell. The cell is part of a far larger organism in which the cells are not physically connected to each other. The organism is thus far more resilient to their weapons. Kirk says something about the sun made that pilot scream ""I'm free. What was it?"" McCoy says ""We tried heat, we tried radiation. They didn't work. Aurelan and Peter would burn up before we killed the creature."" Kirk cannot allow this organism to spread beyond Deneva and is prepared to kill a million people on Deneva if they cant find a way to destroy the organism, without killing its host. Kirk knows these creatures have been migrating all over the galaxy for thousands of years. He turns on the scanner light and the idea occurs ""Light! We have to blast them with light."" The sun radiates light at an intensity of 1 million candles per square inch. The specimen dies under light, but Kirk needs a test subject. Spock volunteers to be put under bright light. It works, The creature is dead. But Spock is blind.

Then McCoy realizes they only needed to use invisible light. Kirk and McCoy feel guilty, but there was a rush, so they didn't feel too bad. They flash bright invisible light on the planet via 210 ultraviolet emitting satellites positioned at an altitude of 72 miles and everyone is saved. Then Spock comes on the bridge and he is not blind. He has a second eyelid, says McCoy. Everyone laughs, men and women on the bridge, and all is resolved."

Unsure exactly what to do, Sam rushes off with Diane close behind. She the chastises Sam for running out on his friend this way. Sam then decides that he will stand by his friend...causing some in the bar to question Sam's attitude.

Sam and Tom both have their pictures run in the newspaper alongside an article about Tom's book. When a couple new patrons come into the bar talking about Sam's article, Cliff, Norm, and several others tell Sam that they are fearful that Cheers is going to become a gay bar. Overhearing their paranoia, Diane joins the conversation, and the guys claim they can spot if a person is gay or not. Putting their claim to the test, Diane explains that there are currently two gay men in Cheers. The group soon believe they have found their men, and demand Sam eject their suspects.

Sam instead takes them into the pool room, where the guys insist he kick the two men out. Instead, Sam refuses. When it seems that Sam has turned on them, the guys trick the two men into thinking the bar is closing for the evening.

After the two leave, the guys think they've won...only for Diane to admit that the two men they just kicked out were not gay. The guys are unsure just where these men are...only for the two to have been playing along with the gang all along.

Unknown to Diane, Sam has entered her into the contest. Naturally, when she finds out, she is livid to be entered into something she considers degrading towards women.

Even Carla warms to the idea.

On the day of the contest, Diane attempts to give her speech as soon as she can, but is soon hustled into the contest. Sam is rather impressed with how she's acting, but upon finding her unused note cards and the reason why she decided to stay in the contest, he chastises her and reminds her of a facial tic that surface when she's nervous. Naturally, this causes Diane to develop her nervous tic, but she still manages to impress the judges.

Upon winning the contest, Diane continues to try and tell of her message, but forgets all about it when the prize package she won includes a week-long vacation in Bermuda.

However, what seems like a friendly, simple game, is soon found to be otherwise, when it's revealed that George and Coach have been betting money. George's 'hustle' over the last few months has caused Coach to lose $8,000.

Wanting to help Coach, Sam goes to neighborhood conman 'Harry the Hat' for an assist. Harry tells Sam that George is well-known in several states, but that he does love poker. Harry then works out a deal with Sam: a small poker game will be set up, and George will be unable to resist joining in. However, when Harry asks for $5000 to use in the game, Sam at first refuses, but changes his mind when Coach's asks for him to go through with it.

Eventually, the poker game is held, and just as Harry said, George shows up. After beating out most of the Cheers gang, it comes down to just George and Harry. However, George keeps winning, and Sam tells Harry he's concerned. Even so, Harry tells Sam he can still win.

Eventually, George cleans out Harry, and Sam is angry. Harry tells Sam that he tried everything he could, but he's sorry. After going to the men's room, Coach notices that Harry actually had a hand of cards that could have beaten George's last play! The Cheers gang then realizes that George and Harry were attempting to con the gang out of their money. They demand that George hand over what he's won, but he refuses, saying he could very well report the bar for the poker game they are holding.

It is then they reach a compromise. Harry still has some money on him. George can win it off him, and they'll split that up. George then requests that one of the group serve as a signaler to let him know if Harry has a losing hand. Coach volunteers, and says he'll rub his nose as the signal.

After Harry exits the washroom, George tells him that the group is on to their scheme, and the two then play another hand. Both men put down all their money, and the tension mounts. Coach then rubs his nose, and tells George that it was itchy.

George then puts down his 3 queens...but is shocked when Harry reveals four-of-a-kind! Harry then collects his winnings, with Sam angrily telling him not to come back. Meanwhile, George is seething at Coach, who insists that his nose really was itchy, and that's why he said what he said. George doesn't care about this, and calls Coach a stupid man who deserves to lose all his money.

After George storms out, the group are unsure what to do, when Coach puts his head in his hand. He then starts to laugh, and suddenly, Harry emerges from the pool room! It is then revealed that Harry and Coach had a plan of their own, and kept it secret from everyone else! Harry then gives Coach back the $8000 he lost to George, and splits the rest of the nights winnings with the group."

In her apartment, she opens a cigarette box and finds a .38 revolver, so she calls Perry. He explains how to check if the gun has been fired recently - it hasn't. Evelyn wants help because she was recently acquitted of stealing jewelry from movie star Helene Chaney (Gloria Henry) at a motel in Riverside, CA. Perry tells her to go to a hotel, but on the way a car driven by the hooded man tries to force her off the road, so she fires the gun, although not aiming at him. The car with the mystery driver veers off the road.

Evelyn arrives at Perry's office convinced that she just escaped a murder attempt. Perry calls Paul to trace the gun's ownership and goes to the scene of Evelyn's escape to find a crash scene and LAPD Homicide already there. He gets a peek at the hood found on the victim. It's a pillow from the apartment building where Evelyn was staying. When Perry is back at his office, Lt. Tragg storms in, asking who sent Perry to the murder scene. He reveals that the victim was named Harry Merrill, and he died from a .38 bullet in his head. Tragg leaves without seeing Perry's client, but promises ""I'll be back."" Once he's gone, Evelyn explains that Merrill, originally named Lester Gladden, was a man who stole $1500 from her five years ago in a ""you ought to be in pictures"" scam. Two months ago, Merrill walked into the cafe where Evelyn works, and she demanded her money back. He said she should come to the Eucalyptus Grove motel in Riverside, but instead of getting her money, she walked into trumped-up charges of stealing jewelry.

The next morning, Paul reveals that the gun was one of an identical pair bought in Riverside by movie mogul Mervin Aldritch (Ralph Clanton). Tragg arrests Evelyn, and soon after Paul shows Perry a marriage certificate for Gladden/Merrill and Hester Charles (now famous as Helene Chaney). Aldritch, who is now engaged to Helene, admits that he paid Merrill $10,000 not to make trouble by claiming he hadn't been properly served papers in his divorce. Perry hands Aldritch the .38, on which he had earlier put a small file mark, and asks Aldritch if it's his personal gun, or its mate, which he bought for Helene. Aldritch goes to check if his own gun is in the glove compartment where he left it, then returns saying that gun is missing. He hands a revolver back to Perry, but it's the other one, which Perry hadn't marked. Perry then goes to the crime scene and manufactures false evidence by firing the new gun into a post and a tree. On his way to the office, Perry is met by Tragg, who takes the gun, and says that Merrill's pillow hood had no bullet hole, so he'd been shot, then planted in the crashed car.

At the preliminary hearing, Perry takes advantage of the fake evidence he planted to convince the court that the gun without a file mark, which he truthfully claims was never in Evelyn's possession, was the murder weapon. He calls the manager of Evelyn's apartment building to the stand and asks her if anyone else in the court had rented a room from her. She points to Louis Boles (Vaughn Taylor), hen-pecked manager of the Eucalyptus Grove motel, but states that he used the place not to sleep in but to watch Evelyn's apartment. On the stand, Boles denies a series of accusations from Perry, but then lets slip that there was no registration card for Merrill on the night of the jewelry theft because he'd never signed one. After that, he confesses that he was in league with Merrill to frame Evelyn, but Merrill reneged on the bribe he'd promised. Boles then schemed to murder Merrill for the $10,000 payment he'd received from Aldritch, so he could get away from his shrewish wife. In the office, Perry explains to Della and a relieved Evelyn that Boles shot Merrill, planted the gun in Evelyn's apartment, became the hooded driver in the hope that Evelyn would fire the gun but not hit him, then set up the fake crime scene."

His wife Doris (Hillary Brooke) is afraid and decides the next day to file for divorce. 364 days later, when the divorce is about to be finalized, Frank Maddox (John Archer), Pete's business partner, meets with Doris Cole at her home in Santa Barbara. Together they arrange to force Pete to pay Maddox $500K (more than double the fair price) to buy his share of the business, or Doris will stop the divorce, thus preventing Pete from marrying his true love, Lucille Mays (Helen Mowery). Pete's niece and secretary Edna Hammar (Nancy Hadley) calls in Perry, who arranges a meeting with Maddox and his lawyer Ralph Duncan (Thomas Browne Henry), in an attempt to stall while the divorce decree goes through. Also present are Pete's half-brother and partner Phillip Kendall (Harry Hickox), and Edna's fiancé Steve Harris (Darryl Hickman). The haggling stretches into the night, so Perry suggests that Maddox and Duncan spend the night at Pete's house. Perry returns to his office, and Steve volunteers to go to Santa Barbara to keep an eye on any comings and goings at Doris's house. Meanwhile, Pete and Lucille prepare to fly to Las Vegas so they can get married the instant the divorce decree is final.

Later that night, Edna encounters Maddox in a hallway. He explains that he is exchanging bedrooms with Phil Kendall, because the bed in the guest room was too small for him. At 11 PM, Maddox goes out to a pay phone to call Doris, bringing her up to date on the progress of the deal and promising to call again at 9:30 AM. The next morning, Perry returns to Pete's house, but it's Lt. Tragg who answers the door. Phil has been found stabbed to death in the guest bed, and Tragg is very interested in Pete's whereabouts. Perry learns that the divorce decree went through. Steve reports that around 3 AM, he overheard Doris's end of a phone call from lawyer Duncan, who apparently just rehashed what Maddox had discussed with Doris at 11. Perry tracks down Pete in Vegas, where Tragg appears and arrests him, with the aid of local police.

In court, Maddox testifies that he saw Pete wide awake and holding a knife at 3:05 AM. Perry pokes holes in the credibility of his account. Duncan testifies about the little he knows, and Perry pelts him with questions about the ethics of a lawyer dealing in what is essentially a blackmail scheme. Duncan words his responses carefully, claiming innocence while avoiding anything that could be perjury. He does state categorically that he never had any contact with Doris. Steve is called as a hostile witness and has to testify that he noticed a carving knife missing from the sideboard around 10 PM, when Pete was still up. On cross-examination, Steve testifies about the 3 AM phone call, pointing out on a photograph where he stood in order to overhear Doris. Perry accuses Steve of making the phone call himself, posing as Duncan, in order to give the impression he was in Santa Barbara all night. Instead, he came back to Pete's house just long enough to murder Phil in a way that framed Pete. Thus, his fiancée Edna would inherit the business, and he would eventually get control of the money. Steve denies all this, but then Perry reveals that the photo on which Steve identified his precise location wasn't even of Doris's house! Later, as Pete and Lucille leave on their honeymoon, Perry explains that Duncan's testimony, so firm about not contacting Doris although he was slippery about everything else, made Perry suspect that Steve was the liar."

They see Sybil's husband Bruce (William Roerick) kissing flashy blonde Roxy Howard (Greta Thyssen). Sybil explains that the house is a model home on land owned by Sylvan Glade, a housing development company. They've stopped work on building houses because they think they've found oil on the land. Roxy has a friend in the company who's letting her live in the model home while she tries to get Bruce to financially back drilling for oil. Sybil wants her husband back and thinks that if Perry can block the oil deal, Roxy will become a nag about it and she can win Bruce back by being understanding. Sybil will put up money so Perry can become a stockholder, and he agrees.

Attending a Sylvan Glade board meeting are company president George Lutts (Richard Hale), his son-in-law Herbert Dean (Robert Cornthwaite), Sam Elkins (Tyler McVey), Bruce, Roxy, ... and a new stockholder. Perry points out that the company charter prohibits going into a business other than home building without unanimous approval of stockholders. He says he's unalterably opposed and then leaves. Bruce tells Roxy that means the deal is off, but she insists he not give up so easily, threatening to tell Sybil about what they've been doing.

George Lutts now realizes he made a big mistake in selling stock to Perry. When he discusses it with Herbert and George's daughter Vinnie Dean (Jean Howell), she tells him what she's learned from Herbert about Bruce and Roxy at the model home, and Sybil spying on them. He realizes how this connects to Perry, and the next day he approaches Sybil while she's spying again. He threatens to tell Bruce, but a gunshot is heard (although not very loud). George grabs his throat and falls, dead. Sybil frantically runs to her car and speeds off, but she soon drives into a ditch and can't get the car to move.

Later, Sybil has been explaining events to Perry in his office, having taken a cab there. Perry asks to see the cab receipt for $2.95, then drives Sybil to her car. A gun that should be in her glove compartment is missing. Perry involves Paul, some of his operatives, and Sybil's good friend Ruth Marvel (Claudia Bryar) in a scheme to obtain another cab receipt from the same driver and for the same fare, but innocently driving around Beverly Hills. Sybil keeps that receipt in her purse.

At Sybil's preliminary hearing, Lt. Tragg testifies that powder burns prove that Lutts was shot from 18 to 24 inches away. Sybil insists to Perry that it was a distant shot. The cabby, Jerome Keddie (James Gavin), testifies about picking up Sybil at her car and identifies the receipt police found when they arrested her. On cross-examination, Perry makes Keddie identify his trip sheet, which shows a different trip number that the one on the receipt (due to Perry's earlier scheme). Perry asks if he can unequivocally identify Sybil as the fare on the first trip, and he admits he can't. The judge declares the Keddie's testimony is compromised. Burger is furious and moves for a dismissal of this hearing until he can obtain more evidence.

Paul has discovered that the one location with a clear shot at where George Lutts had been standing is a Sylvan Glade tool shack. It's locked, so Perry goes to Herbert Dean, but he says he doesn't have the key either. While Perry's there, Vinnie Dean admits that her father was hard to work for due to his stinginess, but Herbert kept the job for her sake.

Back in court, ballistics expert Alexander Redfield (Norman Leavitt) testifies that two shots, with different types of cartridge, were recently fired from Sybil's gun. The first shot matched the fatal bullet, but no bullet was found from the second. Perry questions how a that shot could have possibly missed from close range. He proposes that the first, fatal, shot could have been fired from a distance, and the second shot fired a bit later at close distance with a blank, to create the power burns. Redfield admits this would work, except that the paper wadding used to keep the blank's power in place would have penetrated the skin and been found by the coroner. Perry produces a gun (which Redfield silently pushes away when Perry inadvertently points it at him) and fires it at a piece of fabric. It produces a pattern of powder marks, but no hole from the wadding, to the amazement of Redfield. Burger calls Ruth Marvel as a hostile witness, and gets her to admit that Sybil had asked for her help in obtaining the second cab receipt. Perry uses his cross-examination to claim that this was all just a test of whether cabby Keddie could really recognize Sybil.

Paul reports that Roxy unlocked the shack, removed a bunch of junk (including small sandbags, iron pipes, clamps, two-by-fours, and a stool), and dumped it in a gully near the model home. The stuff isn't there now, so Perry asks Paul to obtain a similar collection of items.

Bruce takes the stand and testifies that he owns several guns. He had loaned one to Roxy, who later returned it. Perry is about to ask Bruce to check serial numbers of his guns when loud squeaking disrupts the court. It's Paul, bringing in the duplicate junk, covered up and on an old hand-pushed truck. The judge (Morris Ankrum) castigates Perry for not waiting for a recess to bring this in, or at least using a less squeaky truck, then calls the recess. Paul says he felt like an idiot, but Perry says he intended the noise to further upset a nervous witness.

When the hearing resumes, Bruce testifies that he checked his serial numbers, and one of the guns in his possession isn't his. It could have been the one he lent to Roxy. She's called to the stand, clearly unhappy about it, and denies having switched guns. Perry uncovers the junk, now revealed to be assembled into a makeshift shooting stand. He repeatedly presses her about why she threw out the stand (not the same one, but Roxy doesn't know that). Finally, she breaks down and says that Sybil was the intended target, to stop her from blocking the oil deal, which would have made Roxy rich. However, she wasn't the shooter. Perry says that the real murderer was someone who was followed back to his own garage and found the disassembled stand still there, but didn't get a chance to warn Roxy. She points to her accomplice and the real killer, Herbert!

Back in Perry's office, we learn that Sybil and Bruce have reunited and gone to Mexico for a second honeymoon. Tragg arrives with Perry's shooting stand and points out that it's his responsibility and he can't just put it in the trash. However, Tragg will handle the matter for a price. Perry guesses that the price is revealing how he shot that fabric without making a hole. He just used a little chalk instead of paper wadding. The power would have blasted it away, leaving no trace. Tragg stalks out, telling his officer, ""Get me out of here before I use that thing (the stand) on myself."" Perry, Della, and Paul get a good laugh."

Later, Briggs visits Wilma Adams (Olive Blakeney) , who was also summoned to Logan City and is staying at a boarding house. He's there because Wilma's son Marv (Gary Vinson), a chemical engineering student, is engaged to Helen Waters (Carolyn Craig), daughter of local big-shot Clyde Waters (Victor Sutherland). Briggs says he knows part of a secret about Marv's father, and will uncover the rest of it thanks to the presence of Lois Reed. He says that $5000 will make him less curious. Marv arrives, having learned that his mother is in town. Briggs leaves, but Marv quickly sees that the P.I. has upset Wilma, so he follows Briggs outside and they get into a fight. It's broken up by Police Chief Glass (Rusty Lane).

Briggs next reports to Clyde, who initially hired him to look into the mystery surrounding his prospective son-in-law's father. Briggs tells him that Marv's father was actually Ben Devereux, a local man who was executed for murder. Clyde pays Briggs for his services, but Briggs wants another $5000 to keep the matter quiet, and again mentions that Lois Reed is in town. Later, Clyde visits Perry in L.A. and explains that he has nothing against Marv, but merely wondered why the boy seemed to know so little about his father. With Briggs intent on blackmail, it seems matters have spun out of control, so he needs help from Perry and Paul. He adds that Devereux was convicted of murdering his partner 18 years earlier. Perry will look into the trial record, while Paul looks up Briggs.

In Logan City, Perry returns the transcript of the Devereux trial that he has borrowed from Judge Meeham (Nolan Leary), who was the prosecutor in that case. Perry questions why both Meeham and the defense attorney permitted a ""Miss X"" who was mention several times in the case, was allowed to remain anonymous. The judge replies that she wasn't involved in the murder or its motive, so it was agreed not to have her suffer embarrassment. Perry is at a filling station intending to return to L.A. when Chief Glass drives up and insists that he follow him to the Norris ranch. There, meets retiree George Norris (Don Beddoe) and his wife Martha (Paula Winslowe). She says that the man Devereux killed was her first husband, David Latwell, and she doesn't want all this mess dug up again.

Perry next goes to the Waters ranch, where he, Clyde, and Helen observe Marv entertaining some schoolchildren. He pours some ""magic water"" on a duck and sets the bird in a water trough. After a moment, it sinks, and one of the children quickly rescues it. Marv reveals to the adults that what he poured on the duck was a chemical that removes oil from the duck's feathers. Perry gets a call from Paul, who has tracked Briggs to Logan City, and they agree to visit Briggs that evening. When they arrive at the Sands Motel, they encounter Lois, who heard them drive up and thought it was her cab. She says that she heard someone visiting Briggs half an hour earlier and believe they may have left together. Once she returns to her room, Perry and Paul enter Briggs' unlatched door. They find some old newspaper clippings and notice a strange odor. Then they spot the man himself - dead.

Later, as the police investigate, Dr. Creel (Joseph Forte) says that Briggs was killed with poison gas - potassium cyanide pellets tossed into a container of hydrochloric acid would do the trick. The Chief, adding this bit of chemistry to Marv's earlier fight with Briggs, plus Lois having spotted Wilma's truck (which her son had been borrowing), decides that the young man is his chief suspect. He heads to the Waters ranch, where Marv had been staying, but Perry knows that Marv was about to return to school. He and Paul drive to the bus stop and find Marv there. Perry drives off with him, and hears from Marv that he never saw Briggs again after their brief fight. Chief Glass pulls them over, arrests Marv, and admonishes Perry for his interference.

In jail, Perry can't get Marv to take interest in his own defense. He suggests that Marv is afraid the proving his own innocence will shift blame for the murder to his mother. After that, Marv won't talk to Perry any more. Perry gets a call from Lois, who tells him to ask Judge Meeham who really defended Devereux. He does just that, and learns that while another man handled the case in court, the defense was prepared by George Norris. He's the one who agreed with Meeham to leave ""Miss X"" unidentified.

Perry calls on George, who first explains that what is now the Norris ranch was at the time of the murder co-owned by Devereux and Latwell. However, they argued constantly. Perry asks if George agreed to leave Miss X anonymous to sabotage his own case, but George admits that that was merely the result of his shortcomings as a lawyer. He still doesn't know if Devereux was guilty or innocent. The motive for protecting Miss X was that her father was the beloved Reverend Logan, for whom the town was later named. However, Miss X left town at the time of the trial and didn't even return for either her father's funeral or the town renaming ceremony. She's been married and divorced, and is now Lois Reed. Perry visits Lois, who tells him that Briggs offered her $1000 just to show up in town for a couple days. About two hours before his body was found, he visited her and she told him she quit. He wrote down three names on a piece of paper and circled one, calling it the ""murdering goose who laid a golden egg"". Lois never got a look at what he wrote.

In court, pompous D.A. Harry Cortland (Philip Tonge) is having Helen testify to Marv's knowledge of chemical tricks. When Clyde testifies to the ""drowning duck"" trick, Cortland suggests that Marv might have let the duck drown if the boy hadn't intervened, but Perry objects and Judge Meeham sustains him. During a recess, Paul gives Perry a report on Wilma's bad heart - it's surprising that she's lived even as long as she has. Perry uses this fact to get Marv to cooperate at least to the extent of telling his attorney where Wilma has been staying.

Paul and Della go there, but find her dead (from natural causes). Next to the body is a small strongbox, which Paul and Perry later open with Marv's permission. Inside are various papers that Wilma had collected from Ben's desk, with photos of Lois and an incomplete letter that basically says ""My Dear, We both know our marriage is over. I love someone else. We can discuss a settlement after I return from my weekend trip."" Perry visits Lois, who's a bit drunk. She laughs at the idea that she'd marry the short, dumpy, square, and bald Ben Devereux. Her affair was with Latwell, who shared a desk with his partner. 18 years late, she sounds like she's still in love with him.

The next day, Lois testifies in court about how Briggs brought her to Logan City in what she finally learned was a blackmail scheme against multiple people, but she doesn't know whom. Dr. Creel testifies about poisoning with HCl and KCN. He says that these are commonly found around a farm for pest control, and that using them would not require a chemist's special knowledge. Paul enters with a copy of a newspaper clipping from Briggs' room at the Sands. Perry calls Martha Norris to the stand. She repeats her testimony from the Devereux trial: When her husband was murdered, she was laid up with a self-treated sprained ankle from a tractor accident. When she claims she and Latwell were in love, Perry introduces the incomplete letter, which was never shown in the earlier trial because it would have required calling ""Miss X"" to explain its significance. Perry suggests that Briggs was murdered because he discovered that Martha killed her husband and intended to blackmail her. She repeats her ankle alibi, but Perry introduces the newspaper clipping into evidence. It's dated the day of the murder and has a photo of Lois and Latwell at the county fair, with Martha standing in the background. Martha breaks down, but says that her husband was better off dead than with someone like Lois.

Later, Marv complains that the town refused to believe his father. Perry sets he shouldn't let his resentment color the rest of his life. Marv asks how it could not, when the whole town also turned against him. Perry reminds him that Helen is part of the town. The couple look into each other's eyes, just smiling, until Della says ""Don't just stand there. Do something!"" As they kiss, Della looks satisfied with herself, while Perry and Paul examine some papers."

Hutton) are arguing in the mansion where they both live. She storms out of the study just before Norton's attorney Arthur Crinston (Robert Griffin) arrives at the front door. Donald Graves (William Schallert), Norton's secretary, lets him in, but tells him that Norton is too upset to talk business. Crinston has an appointment with Judge Ryan Purley (Howard Wendell) at 10 PM, so it's agreed that he'll come back at 11. As he's about to leave, Fran storms out of the house, gets in her car, and speeds off.

Fran barges into Perry's office and says that she wants Perry to break the ""spendthrift trust"" of over $1,000,000 that her father set up, leaving Norton in complete control of Fran's money. He'll use his power to cut Fran off if she marries before age 25 (in about a year and a half), but Fran wants to marry now. Perry says he'll need a day or two to investigate. Later, Paul reports that 5 years earlier Fran's widowed father had to track her down when she ran off with a bellman. Convinced that his daughter was too impulsive, he set up the trust - and died not long afterward. Lately, Fran has been seen in the company of artist Rod Gleason (Brian G. Hutton). Perry visits Rod and surmises not only that he was that bellman, but that he and Fran have secretly married. Fran emerges from hiding and admits that Perry is right. He has also correctly guessed that they can't keep the marriage secret for another 18 months - Fran is pregant.

Perry visits Norton and says that a court might have something to say about Norton's arbitrary use of his power as trustee, but he gets nowhere. He reports the discouraging news to Fran and leaves. At 11:06, Rod is walking outside the mansion when a car pulls up. It's Judge Purley, who is giving Crinston a ride. Since Crinston doesn't expect to be very long, the judge decides to wait in the car so he can keep listening to a prize fight. Graves lets Crinston in, and a few minutes later the lawyer returns to Purley's car. Over the noise of the radio, a voice is heard, and Crinston asks Norton what he wants. The reply is that he wants some papers Crinston has at home, and will send Graves along in the judge's car to retrieve them. Graves squeezes into the front seat, and as they start to drive off he turns around to put a briefcase in the back. He suddenly shouts to stop the car, saying that through the study window he saw a man come up behind Norton. They return, and the police arrive.

Later, the police surgeon (Larry Thor) tells Lt. Tragg that Norton never knew what hit him, and ""an ash tray got him over the left ear."" Crinston, Purley, and Graves tell what they know. Graves doesn't know what to say when Tragg asks him if he could recognize the killer. Fran and Perry are also in the mansion, and she tells him that Rod was there to take her bags - she was moving in with him. She admits Rod was angry with Norton and insisted on talking to him - but insists that Rod would never have committed murder. At his apartment, Rod tells Perry that he headed to the study, but heard voices so went out to the garden to wait until Norton was alone. After the exchange of voices between the house and Judge Purley's car, he went back to the study and found Norton dead. He panicked and ran. Perry thinks Burger will have a field day with this case, but agrees to defend Rod.

Paul observes the police making a same-conditions test of Graves's ability to recognize people in the study from his location in the car, and he definitely passes. However, Lt. Tragg calls Paul into his office, reveals the he knows of Paul's unauthorized attendance at the test, and hands him a subpoena. If Perry tries to challenge Graves's account then Paul, obviously not biased toward the prosecution, will have to testify that he saw Graves proving his visual acuity.

At the trial, Burger parades his witnesses before the jury, all recounting the events we've seen. On cross-examination, Judge Purley says that he didn't know Norton and had never even spoken with him on the phone. Crinston testifies that his 11 PM meeting with Norton was to be about a tax matter, but Norton was too upset about Fran to discuss anything. Clara Mayfield (Lillian Bronson), the housekeeper who had helped care for Fran after her mother died, testifies that she saw Rod come in from the garden and go into the house. On cross, she admits that Norton threatened to fire her unless she stayed away from Fran.

Perry has Paul maneuver Judge Purley so he'll hear the upcoming testimony from just outside the courtroom. He calls Crinston, accusing him of embezzlement and then killing Norton, who had caught on. Crinston firmly denies everything that Perry said. Next, he calls Graves and asks him to read aloud some sentences - a few old adages ending with ""Crinston, I want Graves to go with you."" Perry then recalls the judge, who testifies that the voice he heard that night was the same one he just heard: not Norton, but Graves. The secretary admits it, but says that this was his only part in the crime - Crinston was the killer. The latter holds his head in despair.

Later, Perry agrees with Clara that Graves only abetted the murder for a share of the embezzlement profits. However, they differ on whether Fran's baby will be a boy or a girl."

Harry Marlow (Dan Seymour), ex-con and now a florist, drops by to suggest that he'd make a good silent partner in Mildred's business. She wants nothing to do with him, but his manner hints that he's confident he'll get what he wants. Mildred, who is recovering from a recent heart attack, collapses and sends Tulloch running to fetch her pills.

In his office at Club Eldorado, owner Sam Lynk (Michael Emmet) is playing poker with Harry and Bob Kimber (Mark Roberts), with club hostess Lola Florey (Peggy Maley) in attendance. Bob has a full house, and - seen only by Lola - a gun and set of stock certificates in his coat pocket. The hand is interrupted by a phone call, which Lola answers. It's Miss Carling (Jann Darlyn), the woman for whom Sam dumped Lola, who's obviously not pleased. Back in the game, Sam keeps raising Bob until the pot is huge. Bob calls, but Sam's four deuces have him beat. In all, Bob now owes $37,000, and has to pledge his stock. Harry manages to find an offensive way of saying that Mildred has entrusted Bob with 49% of Orchids Unlimited. Bob punches him, but Sam pulls him off and sends him to the bar. Harry expects Sam to hand over the stock, for which Sam has already been payed $40,000. However, Sam says he now wants an additional $10,000, as he charges more for his services to people he dislikes.

At their apartment, Mildred learns from a drunk Bob that Sam now has the stock. She calls Perry, who's in the middle of vital work, so she has to settle for an appointment at 10:30 next morning. She goes to the club, where Lola privately tells her that the game was rigged and about the deal with Harry. Admitting that she's acting as a woman scorned, Lola agrees to come to Perry's office next morning, bringing one of Sam's marked decks as evidence. Mildred leaves, and later Lola is about to do likewise when a cigarette girl (Dawn Richard) hands her a box of chocolates that had been left anonymously for her shortly before.

Perry and Della are still working late when he gets a call from Lola, weakly saying that she's eaten poisoned candy. Then she stops talking, but the line is still open, so Perry hopes they can get it traced, but no sooner does he say this than it's disconnected. He immediately calls Lt. Tragg but can't tell him much because Lola isn't listed in the phone book. Luckily, her name is familiar to Tragg, who gets her address from the police registry of night club employees. He sends an ambulance and meets Perry at Lola's house. They find her barely alive, six candies gone from the box, and the receiver of the phone back on the hook. Perry has Della peek into the trash, but she sees nothing but some used tissues.

At her apartment, Mildred looks unwell again. A gun falls out of her coat and she puts it back. Perry and Della are at the door. She tells him that Bob has returned, exhausted from business travel, and is now asleep. It's all a lie, as are her claim that her urgent problem has been cleared up and her denial of knowing Lola. As they leave, Perry speculates that there's a link from Mildred to her husband (a known gambler) to Sam (another gambler) to Lola (Sam's employee). Therefore, he goes to Sam's house but finds him on the floor, shot dead. The phone is off the hook, and near the body Perry finds Mildred's pill prescription. He returns to Mildred's apartment and finds the gun in her coat. She tells Perry about her meeting with Lola and that she went to Sam's, found him dead and Bob's gun on the floor, so she took it, but couldn't find the stock. She had a blackout while there, which is how she must have dropped her prescription. Perry warns her not to lie, because they'll give her a paraffin test to show if she's fired a gun recently. The police pound on the door, and Mildred realizes that Bob's fingerprints must be on the gun, so she grabs it and wipes it, but fires a wild shot in the process. As Lt. Tragg bursts in to arrest her, she collapses.

Later, her doctor (Henry Hunter) has put an oxygen tent around her bed. He's says that she'll never live through the stress of a murder trial. Her husband should be with her, but the police are still looking for him. Downstairs, Burger has arrived and said he won't let Mildred evade justice. Perry says that if he questions her and she suffers a fatal relapse, he'll accuse the prosecutor of manslaughter. Burger replies that he's instructed the city medical officer to examine her, which can't be medically objectionable, and let the D.A.'s office know as soon as Mildred is fit to be arraigned. He adds that he also intends to charge Perry with malfeasance, for telling Mildred to fire the gun in her apartment, the rendering a paraffin test pointless.

In Perry's office, Paul reports that Lola is recovering and soon will be discharged. The poison was Veronal, and a few more pieces would have killed her. Harry Marlow show up, still after the stock. He threatens to testify that he was on the phone with Sam when he was murdered, and Sam told him Bob was there. Perry throws him out, but soon bumps into him again leaving Lola's hospital room. Perry tells her that she's still in danger from her poisoner, who is also Sam's killer, so she should tell the D.A. what she told Mildred. Lola won't cooperate, and after Perry presses her she indicates that Harry made threats. Perry convinces Tragg to put a stakeout on Lola's house, despite Burger's possible ire at being left out of the loop. Perry decides to go there himself, and Tragg goes too.

We see some rags thrown on the floor and splashed with what must be a flammable liquid, since a lit match thrown into the pile instantly results in a roaring fire. Outside, the police see the flames and call the fire department as Lola runs out, screaming. Perry arrives and calms the hysterical Lola. She says that she saw Harry, who hit her and set the fire. Tragg congratulates Perry, who explains to Lola that at his suggestion, Harry had been jailed on extortion charges earlier that day. She tries again, saying it was actually Bob that she saw, but the police have him too. Defeated, she admits that she lifted Bob's gun at the poker game and used it to kill Sam. She set the fire herself.

Back at the office, Perry explains that Lola poisoned herself to set up an alibi and points out the clue: When Perry and Della looked around Lola's place when she was found poisoned, where were the wrappers of the six candies she'd eaten? She hadn't called Perry from home at all, but from a phone booth near Sam's house, giving her time to shoot him, rush home, and collapse. The only remaining question is who was really on the phone with Sam at the time of the murder, and Tragg enters, announcing that it was just Tulloch, Mildred's nurseryman, in a vain attempt to get the stock back for her. The lieutenant adds that he comes with a present from Lola, who wants to show there are no hard feelings. It's a box of chocolates, so Perry offers Tragg a piece. He replies, ""After you."""

Through binoculars they spy Belle Adrian prowling about the house. Fortunately, Perry Mason on vacation comes to Belle's aid when she is charged with murder.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['tire tracks', 'broken mirror', 'mother daughter relationship', 'neighbor neighbor relationship', 'man wears a bathrobe', 'man uses a wheelchair', 'awakened by a scream']",[],"On a rainy Friday night at his lakeside cabin in Bear Valley, Mark Cushing (Eric Sinclair) is showing home movies of him waterskiing to Carla Adrian (Barbara Eden). He ended up in a wheelchair with a broken leg, but that doesn't stop him from making a determined grab for Carla. He tears her blouse, and gets a good slap in return. A couple cabins away, Sam Burris (Malcolm Atterbury) rouses his wife Betsy (Dorothy Adams) from bed, telling her that he heard a shot and the sound of broken glass. Soon, they hear a scream, and use binoculars to check what's going on at the Cushing cabin. They spot Belle Adrian (Sylvia Field), Carla's mother, and Betsy convinces Sam to call the sheriff.

The next morning, Sheriff Elmore (James Westerfield) is conducting a crime scene investigation of Cushing's place. He's dead, and the main clue seems to be broken glass from a mirror. Sam arrives, at the sheriff's instructions, but doesn't have much to tell. He still hasn't spilled the beans about seeing Belle and Elmore can tell he's holding something back. He knows that Sam disliked Cushing. Sam admits that he's convinced he was once cheated in a business deal with Cushing, but says that something like this - murder - is an entirely different matter. Perry is vacationing at a neighboring cabin, so Belle calls on him to ask for assistance. She explains how Carla figures in what has happened, including the fact that Carla had a flat tire later that night. However, Belle omits any mention of her own late-night visit to Cushing's cabin. She wants Perry to find whoever it was who screamed that night, so Perry puts Paul on the job. The sheriff also comes calling, and is very suspicious of Belle's story, since it doesn't fit the evidence of the various tracks of footprints left is the rain-soaked ground.

Later, Perry goes to Belle's cabin, meets Carla and her boyfriend Harvey Delano (Peter Nelson), and learns from Belle that the sheriff has been by with a search warrant. He's taken a pair of Belle's shoes, Carla's torn blouse, and a woman's gold compact, inscribed ""From Mark to Carla with love"", which was found hidden in a boot. It seems that the broken mirror found at the murder scene is a good fit for this compact. Sheriff Elmore reappears, and with his help Perry draws a diagram of the location of the relevant cabins, plus Carla's car and the various footprint paths between them all. The sheriff mentions finding fingerprints on the car, mostly of people with legitimate reasons to touch the car, but also a single print he couldn't identify. He found a gun near the car, which Harvey recognizes as one he lent to Carla so she could learn to shoot. Others knew she was doing this, so there was no point in trying to keep it secret. Finally, the sheriff reveals that Belle's shoes had traces of blood and glass particles on them, so he arrests her for murder.

Paul gets a report from an operative who had been assigned to check out Cushing's funeral, looking for any candidates for the mystery screamer among the mourners. He's tracked down a Marion Keats (Joan Weldon). Perry visits her, but she's hostile and uncooperative. Perry serves her a subpoena for the upcoming hearing. Meanwhile, by bribing a desk clerk, Paul has learned that on the murder night Marion received a phone call, in which the party at the other end said merely ""Yes"" and hung up. Then Marion got her car and drove off, later checking into a hotel in Bear Valley. She could have been in the area as early as 1:30 AM.

At the hearing, Sheriff Elmore admits that the evidence of Belle's shoes isn't as conclusive as he thought, since there's no glass that could have only come from Cushing's cabin. Betsy Burris testifies about seeing Belle that night, a fact that Belle had still kept from Perry. In a recess, Belle gets a lecture from Perry, then admits that she went there when she heard the scream and tried to cover up anything that would connect Carla to the murder. She took the compact, wiped away fingerprints, washed glasses, etc. Back in court, Sam describes the murder scene as he saw it the next day - the body, the evidence that two people had been watching home movies, etc. The D.A. (Paul Fix) berates him for his earlier reticence about Belle, and says he'll sit back and watch Perry rip him apart in cross-examination. However, Perry has no questions at this time. Della reports that Paul has learned who left the mystery fingerprint on Carla's car. It was Nora Fleming (Eve McVeagh), Cushing's cook/housekeeper.

Perry now calls Marion, but her lawyer George Lansing (Addison Richards) intervenes, accusing Perry of harassing his client. Perry insists on his right to question her, but after his first question both the D.A. and Lansing object, saying that Perry has no specific and relevant purpose to his question and is on a fishing expedition. This gives Perry the opening he needs to lay out exactly what he aims to show. Marion was Cushing's jealous girlfriend and had made arrangements with Nora to call her if Cushing brought a girl to his cabin. Nora is the one who called that night, and off Marion went to Cushing's cabin. Marion blurts out ""He was dead when I got there!"". She explained that when she arrived in the area, the first thing she saw was Carla's car, which angered her, and she took Carla's compact from the car. Then she went to Cushing's cabin, saw the body, screamed, dropped the compact, and left. Perry recalls Sam, and notes that in his description of the crime scene, he mentioned seeing a glass with lipstick on it. But he couldn't have seen that the day after the murder - Belle had cleaned it up! Sam knew about Carla's borrowed gun and used it to kill Cushing. Then he went to bed and roused his wife, pretending that he had just heard a shot and broken glass. Marion's scream coming then was a lucky coincidence."

Meanwhile, outside apartment 604, Fay Allison (Sue England) sends her fiancé Dane Grover (Douglas Dick) off to his bachelor party, then takes over doing the dishes from her roommate Anita Bonsal (Jean Willes). Anita says she doesn't resent her for marrying Dane, who had dated Anita first. Anita announces she's going to be out late, then secretly goes up to 702. Carver is supposedly getting a divorce so that he and Anita can marry, but for now she insists on going out, as it's only 9:15. She says she'll wait in the car, but not for long. However, it's 9:58 when she finally gives up. When she returns to 604, she suggests hot chocolate. While Fay is making it, Anita grabs a box from the medicine cabinet, and eyes a pile of Fay's clothes.

At 1:30 A.M., Fay's aunt Louise Marlow (Frances Bavier) arrives for the wedding, using a key she was sent, only to find both girls unconscious. She calls her old family friend Perry, who informs Dr. Hawley (Howard Culver) of the emergency. He and Della arrive to learn that Fay has suffered a severe overdose of barbiturates, and Anita a moderate overdose. Perry is sure this couldn't be an accident, so he and Della look for clues. They find keys to both 604 and 702 in Fay's purse. They to go 702, where Shirley Tanner (Gloria McGehee) emerges from 704 across the hall and complains about the noise from all the comings and goings. Perry and Della enter, to find Carver dead, with a vivid lip mark from a kiss on his forehead. As they leave, they encounter Don Rolston (Douglas Evans) and Vera Payson (Joi Lansing) on the way to visit Carver. Shirley comes out again to complain about even more people going into 702. Vera seizes on the fact that Carver already has company to insist to Don that they should leave. From the lobby, Perry calls Louise and tells her to arrange for an ambulance to take Fay and Anita to a private sanitarium. Della goes outside to check the name on the buzzer for 702, but then needs Perry to let her back in because the door is locked.

Later, Lt. Tragg arrives with police officers and police lab technician George Harlan (John Harmon). The homicide lieutenant has questions for Perry, but also some answers. Carver has been dead since 9 or 10, from what turns out to be cyanide in his drink. Tragg wonders why Carver doesn't have a key to his own apartment. He finds clothes, which are identified by dry cleaning marks as belonging to Fay. The next day, at the sanitarium, Anita tells Tragg and Perry that she never used sleeping pills, but Fay sometimes did. She also denies knowing Carver. Fay makes the same denial, and also insists she didn't drug the chocolate.

Back at the office, Paul reports that the poisoned glass in 702 had been wiped clean, but a second glass had Fay's fingerprints. Don did Carver's taxes, and Vera's a party girl. Perry wonders how they got into the building, since Carver certainly didn't buzz them in. He tells Paul to check out all the tenants in the building. Fay's fiancé Dane arrives with money to pay for her defense, which Perry accepts, but tells him he'll need to help in other ways. Dane agrees, and warns Perry that the police are sure to find out that Fay was at his family's house on a day when the gardener was using cyanide.

In court, Don testifies that he and Vera rang 702 and were buzzed in, then they spent several minutes in the lobby arguing about whether to go up and see Carver. During this time, the elevator doors closed and it went up, so when they were finally ready to use it, they had to call it and wait for it to come down. When it did, no one was in it. Burger objects to all this testimony about elevator movements, since they could be caused by any tenant visiting any other tenant. For once, Burger is sustained, but Perry doesn't appear to be bothered by it. Shirley testifies about seeing Perry outside her apartment. She states that she had sublet apartment 704 about a week before the murder, from Jerome Hill, who was leaving town. Della has to testify that she and Perry found the key to 702 in Fay's purse. Lab technician Harlan testifies about the fingerprints, and on cross-examination says that lip prints are as distinctive as fingerprints. Perry has him compare Fay's to ones of Carver in a crime scene photo, and they don't match.

During a recess, Perry frets that he doesn't yet have the answers that will conclusively exonerate Fay, Paul reports that Jerome Hill never left town after subletting his apartment to Shirley. Back in court, Anita testifies that she didn't know Carver, but Perry produces charge account records signed by him, paying for expensive gifts with the monogram ""AB"". He accuses her of giving Fay a dangerous dose of sleeping pills, hoping to kill her, and also moving her clothes and a glass with her fingerprints into 702 so she'd be blamed for the murder. Her motive was that she wanted Dane for herself. Hysterical, Anita runs out of the witness stand to a window, threatening to jump.

Burger moves for a mistrial due to all the melodrama, but Perry says that if given some leeway he can clear everything up. He begins to question Shirley, but suddenly presses a paper to her lips and asks for Harlan to check the lip print. Shirley says that won't be necessary. Carver had dumped her for Anita, so she moved across the hall and waited for an opportunity to poison him (apparently thinking Anita would be blamed, since her clothes were in the apartment). She buzzed in Don and Vera and returned to 704 a little before Perry and Della arrived. Anita confesses that she came back to 702, found Carver dead, and hatched her plan to shift the blame to a dead Fay. This included taking Carver's apartment key and putting it in Fay's purse.

Fay and Dane leave for their honeymoon, and she kisses Perry goodbye. He reveals what set him after Shirley. Hill had vacated his apartment because Shirley paid him a $500 bonus to sublease it, when other apartments in the building were for rent. Della wipes a big smooch mark from Perry's cheek. He seems very pleased with himself."

He's sure Edgar will pick her up, and soon ""get friendly"", so he leaves. Edgar acts as predicted. He's a movie producer, senior partner in Fidelity Studios, and says that maybe he can find a job for Veronica. He takes her to a beach house owned by the studio, which uses its elaborate grounds for shooting films. Inside, Edgar starts to play host when another car drives up, so he sends Veronica out the back way. Outside, she hears a gunshot and runs about a mile to a service station with a phone booth. She tries to call Pete at their rendezvous point, but he's not there. As she leaves the booth, John Addison (Robert Ellenstein) drives up, seems about to make his own call, but turns back, and agrees to give Veronica a ride.

The next day, Addison, who is also a partner in Fidelity Studios, sees Perry at his office. He says that after he dropped Veronica off she was arrested for vagrancy, and he wants Perry to bail her out. When he does, Veronica tells him that she was living with her mother in Albuquerque but grew bored and hitchhiked to L.A. Perry gives her a little money and suggests that she return home. She says she will. When Perry returns to the office, Della tells him that Veronica's mother stopped by and paid $100 to handle the cost of getting Veronica out of trouble. Also, Veronica now has a job as a contract player at Fidelity.

That evening, Perry stops by Addison's office, where he's working late with screenwriter Lorraine Ferrell (Catherine McLeod), Edgar's unhappy wife. She leaves, and Addison explains that he hired Veronica - leaving the details to his assistant Myrtle Northrup (Peggy Converse) - because ""she seemed like a nice girl"". Unfortunately, Pete knows about this and wants $10,000 to keep it out of the scandal sheets. Perry has Addison sign his name on a piece of paper, then write a check for $2000 but instead of signing it normally, trace his first signature onto the check. Perry leaves with the check, telling Addison to have Pete come to the law office. He gives Pete the check, but afterward has Paul arrange to put out the word to all the banks that someone is forging high-profile people's names on checks.

Perry goes to the beach house in response to a summons by Addison, who wants to show him something inside. Perry explains that if he sees evidence of a crime, he must report it immediately, but if Addison just tells him something, it's a privileged communication. Addison says he went to the house to rest after scouting nearby shooting locations, and found Edgar's body, dead a few days. Perry immediately figures that Edgar died Tuesday night, when Addison was in the area (having picked up Veronica then), and that's when he really found the body. Addison admits that's what happened, and he was about to enter the gas station phone booth to call the police when he realized that Veronica could identify him. Perry tells him that if he wants a witness to his ""stumbling across the body a few days later"" ploy, he'll need a better companion than his own attorney.

The next day, Addison takes Myrtle to the beach house to ""take inventory"", and arranges that she be the one to see the body first. She volunteers to call the police as if she came there alone, hoping to keep Addison's name out of it, but he insists he has nothing to hide and makes the call. Perry is summoned to the office of Sgt. Bent, who works forgery cases. The check with Addison's traced signature has surfaced, and Pete is in custody. Perry warns him that by claiming that he didn't forge the check, he'll have to admit to being a paid-off extortionist. Lt. Tragg enters, already aware that Pete could have helpful knowledge concerning Edgar's murder. Sgt. Bent, now suspecting that Perry may have passed the check with the traced signature calls Addison about it, at Perry's insistence. He's astonished to hear Addison say he really signed the check. Tragg immediately catches on to how Perry trapped Pete while avoiding being guilty of passing a forged check. He takes Pete away to meet with Burger.

In court, a police fingerprint expert (Perry Ivins) testifies that along with prints of people known to be in the beach house, there were prints of an unidentified woman. There's no way to know when any of the prints were left. Tragg testifies that ballistics show that bullets from the missing murder gun matched ones Addison had used on practice targets, so the gun had been in his possession at one time. Pete, under immunity from prosecution, testifies to taking the $2000 as hush money concerning Addison's whereabouts on the murder night. He also admits to being a convicted blackmailer, but Burger objects when Perry wants details about his doings with Veronica. The judge says he'll rule when court resumes the next day.

Paul has brought Martha Dale (Barbara Pepper), Veronica's mother, from Albuquerque and put her up in a hotel. Della is surprised to see that this isn't the same Mrs. Dale she met earlier. The real Martha says that Veronica has quite a history of running away, and she hadn't heard from her daughter in 10 months. Paul reports that once Veronica checked out of her room on Burger's instructions, a Drake Agency operative entered the room and retrieved a booklet filled with pages of numbers.

Back in court, Veronica is on the stand, perjuring herself every time she opens her mouth: She was at the gas station because a rancher dropped her off there. She doesn't know Pete. She'd been living with her mother until about four days before the murder, when she headed to L.A. to better herself. She stops the parade of lies when she sees that her mother has entered the courtroom. Perry produces her booklet. It's a list of license plate numbers and dates. She claims that's just a hobby, but Perry thinks she keeps it so diligently for purposes of extortion. Furthermore, the license plate just before Addison's doesn't belong to some unknown rancher but to a studio car used by Edgar! Trapped, Veronica admits the truth about her shady practices and about what happened with Edgar. She only briefly saw the car that drove up the the beach house that night, but could testify that it wasn't Addison's. Pete adds that he and Veronica had been working together for at least 6 months. He explains the scheme against Edgar, but has no idea why anyone was posing as Veronica's mother.

Perry and Paul go to the beach house to reenact the murder, bringing along Myrtle, who has a key to the place. Their attempts accomplish nothing, and Perry says the best thing will be to plea bargain down to 2nd degree murder - a 20 year sentence for Addison. Myrtle is shocked at the idea of taking away 20 years from the life of such a great man. Finally, she says that she overheard that Edgar was going to the beach house, so she went there herself, taking Addison's gun for protection. She confronted him there and started to call Lorraine when Edgar grabbed a poker to stop her. The gun went off in their struggle. Perry acts unconvinced, so Myrtle proves her confession by taking him to an urn on the property where she hid the gun.

In the courthouse, Perry learns that there's a mob of reporters waiting to question him about the case, so he and Della sneak out a back way, leaving Paul to deal with the fourth estate. Perry tells Paul that it was Myrtle who impersonated Veronica's mother, hoping to keep anyone from learning the vixen's connection to Addison. Della thinks that a good lawyer can get Myrtle off with a plea of self-defense, and Perry agrees. He tells Paul to warn the reporters against picking up a lady on the highway. ""If she's no lady, it could be murder."""

When Ed arrives, Mitchell reports on the sandwiches Ed provided, saying that his wife made them. They were loaded with arsenic. He returns home, where he confronts his wife Myrna (June Dayton) and her cousin Louise Ansel (Sarah Selby) with the news, and adds that he suspects Myrna poisoned her Uncle Charlie.. He's leaving on a business trip to Bakerstown, and Myrna has packed his bags, including a package of chocolates. However, he has left a letter with the poisoning accusations at his real estate office to be read in case of his death. If he dies, Myrna will soon follow him, via the gas chamber!

After driving about an hour, Ed pulls into the Vista Motel. He seems very tired or weak. At 11:30, he calls the motel office from his bed, saying he's sick. Dr. Renault (James Maloney) lives around the corner, so he arrives quickly. After putting Ed under an oxygen tent, he tries to call Myrna. Louise takes the call but doesn't mention it to Myrna. Her priority is to convince her cousin to see an attorney about Ed's charges. At Perry's office, Myrna and Louise provide a key to Ed's office, plus a letter of authorization for him to retrieve the letter. Perry says the letter could be very damaging, particularly since Myrna got a large inheritance from Uncle Charlie, whom she's accused of having poisoned. However, he can't touch the letter while Ed is alive. Louise finally reveals Ed's current lstate of health. When she and Myrna go to the motel, Ed accuses Myrna of poisoning the chocolates, then begins gasping. Dr. Renault checks the oxygen tent, gives Ed a shot, then examines him. He pulls the bed sheet over Ed's head and tells Myrna ""I'm sorry."" Then he goes to call the police. Louise says they should call Perry and have him retrieve the letter before it's too late.

At Ed's office, Perry and Della find an envelope addressed to the police in the event of his death, plus a withdrawal slip for $17,300 from Ed's checking account, written in a feminine hand. Meanwhile, Rita Norge (Rebecca Welles), Ed's secretary, arrives outside the office, notices Perry's car, peeks inside, sees him, and leaves. Della answers the phone, thinking Myrna might be calling, but hears only ""Unit 13. Desert Motel. Bakerstown."" Perry tells Della to have Paul go there immediately. They steam open the envelope, but it contains nothing but blank pages - no invisible ink either. They reseal it.

When Lt. Tragg arrives at the Vista Motel, all are shocked to discover that Ed's body is gone. At the real estate office, Rita has returned with a police officer (Keith Alan). Perry shows his letter of authorization, and the policeman takes possession of the envelope. Perry gets a call from Myrna, who says it appears that Ed was only unconscious, as he's gone off and hasn't been found. When Paul goes to the Desert Motel, he finds reason to believe that Ed reserved Unit 13 under the name John Stokes.

Perry is reporting this to Myrna at home when Tragg arrives to question her about Uncle Charlie's death. He's already been exhumed, and the coroner reports he dies of arsenic poisoning. There's arsenic plant spray at the house, and Ed's candy was full of the stuff. Louise exclaims that Myrna bought the candy and also had vetoed Louise's idea that they hire a nurse for Uncle Charlie. She tells Tragg about the lab report Ed had obtained, and ends by accusing Myrna of two murders. Tragg says ""Burger's going to love this case. With a witness like this, how can he lose?""

In Burger's office, the two attorney's argue about the opened envelope and whether Ed is dead. Tragg calls to report that the body has been found again. Two boys came upon an open grave a couple days earlier, and when they later saw it filled in, they dug for a bit until they found a corpse. The coroner reports it contains arsenic. Burger offers no death penalty in exchange for a guilty plea, but Perry rejects the idea since it wouldn't apply to the charge of murdering Uncle Charlie. Burger says they'll see how Perry's destruction of vital evidence will sit with a jury.

Paul tells Della that Beckmeyer, Ed's private eye, has been watching Unit 13 at the Desert Motel. Della gets a call from Gertie the receptionist that Beckmeyer himself is in the outer office. He tells Della he'd like to get paid for his latest work for Ed. He thinks he's spotted the mysterious John Stokes, but his description matches Paul. A call comes in from a Drake Detective Agency operative who was tailing Rita. She's back at the real estate office, in violation of Tragg's orders for everyone to stay away. Perry and Paul find her there, throwing out papers. She's hostile, but does mention that Ed sold all his investments a few months ago. She won't answer questions about the $17,300, and when Perry says he wants to protect Myrna's property, Rita replies that she's sure Myrna will get everything she deserves.

Perry goes to Tragg to report his suspicions about Rita. The lieutenant, who tends to smirk when things aren't gong well for Perry, is practically beaming as he pulls out a copy of the receipt he gave Rita when she turned over the $17,300. In court, Deputy Coroner Hoxie (Michael Fox) testifies that Ed died of heart failure caused by arsenic he had ingested. He had eaten about an hour before death, and candy in the room tested positive for arsenic. On cross, Dr. Hoxie testifies that Ed had a .15% blood alcohol level - ""the beginning of intoxication"". (This was 1957.) He says that he found Ed had eaten bacon and eggs - not chocolate. Dr. Renault testifies that Ed told him he'd eaten poisoned chocolates from Myrna, so he pumped Ed's stomach. That explains why Dr. Hoxie found no chocolate in the body, but not how the bacon and eggs got there. Renault declared Ed to have died at 5:15 PM.

Perry and Della visit the site where the boys had found first an empty grave then a couple days later a filled-in one with a corpse. He wants to figure out why the grave was dug in advance. Also, where did Ed get eggs, bacon, and an alcoholic beverage an hour before he died? He wouldn't have walked into a diner in his pajamas. They search for clues, and a jackrabbit draws Della's attention to an area where a car and trailer had been parked for a long time.

Back on the stand, Dr. Renault admits he may have met Ed prior to encountering him at the Vista Motel. When pressed for details, he claims doctor-patient privilege. Perry makes him admit that he just has a diploma mill degree in ""Health Medicine"". When Perry asks him if he conspired with Ed to fake the latter's death, Renault pleads the Fifth. Beckmeyer testifies that one of his jobs for Ed was to find a quack who lived near a motor court. He set up a meeting of Ed and Renault one week before the death. He admits that he opened up several bank accounts into which Ed siphoned money. Perry gets him to admit he owns a trailer, and that Ed might have been in it at some point. Perry accuses him of having given Ed the bacon and eggs and poisoned wine there, having already dug Ed's grave. Beckmeyer starts to deny it, but Perry produces a receipt that shows he bought a shovel the same day the grave had been dug. The private eye confesses that Ed kept bragging about his perfect plan to disappear with Myrna's money, framing her. Beckmeyer figured he could make the plan more perfect with a couple additions, but now realizes he was wrong.

In the office, Della is trying unsuccessfully to hang a painting. Perry says that Beckmeyer had taken $210,000 from the accounts he'd set up. He reveals that the clue that pointed to the culprit was the ""Unit 13. Desert Motel. Bakerstown."" phone call. It was intended to lure Rita there, and could only have come from Beckmeyer, who wanted that last $17,300. Ed had poisoned Uncle Charlie, so Myrna would inherit a fortune he could steal. He's also the one who left blank pages in the envelope - something that would convince the police there was tampering of evidence."

They even have keys to the same house. At the office of his land investment company, boss Joe Bradford (Bruce Cowling) tells subordinate Jack Harper (Robert Clarke) to get his boat, the Mary Belle, ready to be sailed to San Diego for an important business deal. Martha calls, but Joe puts her off by arranging a rendezvous he has no intention of keeping. He tells Jack to remember whose wife Martha is.

That night, Martha's in bed when she hears a prowler, so she comes downstairs with a gun. She sees muddy prints from a woman's shoes on the floor, and goes back upstairs, dresses, and goes out. Rita is hiding in the house and sees this. The next day, Martha tells her story to Perry. He tries to call Joe but gets Jack, who after sending Perry and Martha on a wild goose chase admits Joe's plans to use the Mary Belle. She (the boat) is at La Cuesta harbor, where old salt Captain Noble (Francis McDonald) takes them out to the her in his boat. Boarding, they find Joe face down, dead. There's also a broken hurricane lamp with a candle that's tilting to one side, although it had been burning evenly. Back at the Bradford home, Lt. Tragg arrives and takes Martha in for questioning.

At the office, Paul reports that Rita was Joe's first wife, but he got a Mexican divorce before marrying Martha. Rita arrives, still insisting that she's the one and only Mrs. Bradford. Perry takes her to Burger's office, where she says that she went out to the boat to talk to Joe but found him dead. He was face up, not the way Perry found him. After she leaves, Burger tells Perry he's charging Martha with the murder. He produces a pair of her shoes, with blood on them that matches Joe's type.

Jack is on the Mary Belle, gathering up his personal possessions. The police are finished with her, having gone over her with a fine tooth comb). Company surveyor Larry Sands (Whit Bissell) arrives, wondering if he can find anything that will help Martha. Jack is even more anxious, since he and Martha are romantically involved. At least he has an alibi, as around the time of the murder he bought gas with a credit card, miles away from the harbor. Larry says he has no alibi. In fact, he soon goes to Perry and confesses to the murder. They go to Burger, who wonders how Larry killed a much larger man. Larry says he brought a rock from the beach and hit Joe on the head before he could move. In falling, Joe hit the table, breaking the hurricane lamp and putting out the candle, which he relit. Burger asks if there was anything unusual about the candle, but Larry can't think of anything. ""Wasn't it crooked?"" asks the D.A. ""Come to think of it, yes"" answers Larry. Burger immediately calls him a liar, since he's wrong about the murder weapon and the time of death.

In court, Tragg identifies the actual murder weapon, a small fire axe with traces of Joe's hair and blood, but no fingerprints. However, Martha's prints are on the candle, which is still stuck to what's left of the hurricane lamp at the same odd tilt. Rita testifies that she now realizes Joe had divorced her, but has no memory of it or anything for two years up to just before she went to the beauty shop. She also tells of entering her former house that night, seeing Martha leave, and finding Joe's body. Perry and Della spend that night aboard the Mary Belle, along with a dummy they put in the face-up position that Rita had described for Joe's body. Some hours later, everything in the cabin starts to tilt to one side. The dummy falls over to the position Perry found. The candle has burned out, and Della lights a new one. To keep it straight up and down, she has to put it at an angle to the slanted table.

Jack testifies that he bought the hurricane lamp and candles as part of outfitting the Mary Belle for the trip to San Diego. She had developed electrical problems, so these were now needed to light the cabin. Capt. Noble explains that at low tide, the boat would list to starboard in the shallow harbor. Using a model, Perry shows how this relates to the crooked candle. Low tide was at 1:17 AM, so Martha must have been on the boat and replaced the candle (leaving her prints) around then, 8 hours after the murder. Larry testifies about his false confession, mentioning out his errors. Perry accuses him of making the mistakes intentionally. The hurricane lamp and candles were new, hadn't been mentioned in public, and had been removed when he met Jack on the boat. Therefore, he had no way of knowing about the hurricane lamp or candles, crooked or not. He breaks down and confesses. He killed Joe because he loved Martha, but when he learned she loved Jack, he lied to protect himself and make Martha look more guilty.

In the office, Della gets a call from Martha, who is mailing in her check. She wants to avoid Perry, who's spoiling to lecture her about the folly of clients who don't tell their lawyer the truth. Paul comes in and borrows $75 for his date with his new client, Rita, who wants to know about her two missing years. Paul figures that until he can help with her past, he might as well try to make her present memorable."

In his office at his estate, George Alder (David Lewis) has his secretary Sally Fenner (Peggie Castle) show in Dorian, who enters, note in hand. It states it's from Agatha Alder, George's aunt, and dated the night she disappeared off her yacht, the Sea Witch, in a violent storm. It says that she believes George is about to murder her. He knows she's going to disinherit him over his mistreatment of his wife, Karen (Joan Banks). The final sentence begins ""If he pushes me through the porthole..."" and no more. Dorian asks for $50, and while George is getting out the money, Karen walks in. She's clearly drunk, and has come in to get more liquor. George orders Sally to take Karen back to her room, and when Karen complains, he slaps her. Later, Sally expresses her disgust at George's behavior and says she's quitting. George mentions that $10,000 the Agatha withdrew from the bank is missing, and that Sally could easily have taken it.

That night, Sally sneaks back into the house to fetch the note. She gets it, but fails to see George's body lying on floor. Moreover, she knocks over a lamp, alerting Hess the guard (John Cliff) and his dog. She flees the house, running to the beach and then swimming for it, with the dog in hot pursuit. Perry and Paul are in a boat, finishing up a long day of bass fishing, and rescue her. She shows Perry the note, and they take her to a jetty near where her car is parked. They return the boat to where they're parked and are about to leave when the police arrive and ask if they've seen an attractive blonde - she's wanted for George's murder.

Sally comes to see Perry at his office the next day. He thinks she may be in danger from the murderer, who may have killed George to cover up the murder of Agatha. The note incriminating George is obviously a fake. It was supposedly typed during a raging storm, but doesn't have a single error. Perry has Della take Sally to his apartment. Perry goes to the Alder estate, where Karen admits she's glad to be free of her abusive husband. She believes George murdered Agatha, and mentions that on board the Sea Witch that night with Agatha were George, Sally, the ship's captain, and Agatha's maid Nina Santos. Karen was left ashore because the others were ashamed of her - except for Sally, who was always sympathetic.

Later, Paul says he's discovered that Nina is now a hostess at a local cantina, so he and Perry interview her there. Nina says the note confirms her own suspicions, as Agatha was too good a sailor to let herself be accidentally swept overboard. Paul misjudges his tolerance for hot chili, and needs to down an entire pitcher of water. Meanwhile, Lt. Tragg arrives at Perry's apartment and arrests Sally for murder and Della for aiding a fugitive from justice. At Burger's office, Perry gets Della off by saying she was acting on his instructions and he avoids charges against himself, at least for the time being, by reminding the D.A. that he's sworn to service the cause of justice, not get as many convictions as possible. After they leave, Tragg brings in Dorian with the original note. The one he gave George was a copy that he'd made. Tragg also has the typewriter on which this note was made - it was at Sally's apartment.

In court, Tragg identifies a poker as the murder weapon. He found the french doors to George's office had been jimmied, and there were footprints outside that matched a pair of Sally's shoes. Sally's fingerprints were on the poker and George's cash box. On cross-examination, Perry gets Tragg to admit that her fingerprints were to be expected since she worked there, and that the lieutenant had found a key to the place on her key ring. If she had the key, why would she jimmy the french doors? Nina voices suspicions of Sally regarding the $10,000, but Perry produces evidence that she and her husband had bought the cantina for exactly that amount. Nina only pretented to be nothing more than a hostess there. She says the money was a gift from Agatha, who was always kind to her. She was afraid no one would believe her after Agatha's death, so she lied about it.

Coroner's physician Dr. Murray (Forrest Lewis) testifies that Agatha died from drowning, and there were no marks on her body to suggest violent treatment. Perry specifically asks about her being pushed through a porthole, as mentioned in the note. He replies that although the portholes were wider than usual on the Sea Witch, Agatha's hips were even wider. Burger next calls Karen, but gets a surprise when she testifies that from her bedroom she saw a man run out of the office and onto the beach that night. (Her description sounds like Dorian.) Burger accuses her of perjury and asks why she didn't mention that earlier. She says that, with George as her husband, she had to drink to forget - and sometimes it worked.

After a recess, Burger puts Karen back on the stand and confronts her with a photo of the view from her bedroom. You can see trees, but no beach. On cross, she discusses entering the office as George was paying off Dorian, and mentions the incriminating note and bottle. After proving she has excellent eyesight, she identifies the bottle on the prosecutor's table as the one she saw. However, Perry points out that Dorian had only brought a copy of the note, not the original or the bottle. The only reason she could identify the bottle is because she drank it contents, then put the note she had faked into it and threw it in the cove so it would wash up and be found. Karen admits it, and also confesses to killing George. It had made her feel free for a little while, but now she really needs a drink.

At the cantina, Perry explains that he suspected Karen because the fact that Agatha's death had to be accidental tended to eliminate the suspects who'd been on the Sea Witch that night. Paul is paying attention to an attractive dancer and doesn't notice the waitress putting sauce on the ham and eggs he ordered. Soon he is downing another pitcher of water."

Someone in the car shoots at her. Dixie runs - right into another car. Inside, Morey learns that she's been sent to the hospital. He immediately goes to her locker, takes out a mink coat, and gives it to Perry and Della. As the police arrive to investigate what happened to Dixie, Morey pleads that they help him. The mink, the worse for a couple moth holes but still a mink, is Dixie's legitimate property. However, if the police see it they might suspect that Morey's is the kind of place where waitresses are encouraged to ""get friendly"" with customers.

Perry noticed that Dixie left right after Fayette entered, so he asks Morey what he knows about the man. Morey claims ignorance, but he asks for Perry's legal help, without specifying for what. Perry, believing that Dixie is in danger, calls Lt. Tragg and asks that he tell the hospital to put her in a private room and allow no visitors. Tragg agrees to this - and also to sending the hospital bill to Perry's office.

By the next morning, Paul's man in Portland has reported about the pawn ticket. It was for a gun - a 38 caliber police special. Paul also warns that the police know Della left the restaurant wearing Dixie's mink. At the hospital, Perry encounters Tragg, who's somewhat miffed that Perry is being uncooperative after Tragg did him a favor. Perry is about to go see Dixie when the lieutenant tells him the she has disappeared from the hospital. Back at the office, Paul has learned that Fayette was once arrested as a bookie, but never brought to trial. Apparently, he had very good connections. Also, the gun Dixie pawned was the service revolver of Detective Claremont, who was shot and killed with it about a year earlier. Ever since, the police have been looking for Tom Sedgewick, another bookie who had been seen talking to Claremont shortly before the murder. Paul warns Perry that the police will pull out all the stops to catch a cop killer, and he'd be better off staying out of their way by dropping Morey as a client. However, Perry refuses to take the easy way out. Perry gets a call from Della. Tragg is at the office and wants the mink. Perry tells her to give him the receipt from the storage company where they left it.

Late that night, Perry is awakened by a call from Morey. He and Dixie are at the Keymont Hotel, room 721 and need Perry to come. Perry calls Paul, saying to join him there. Perry gets there first, but finds no one in the room. He notices a lipstick on the floor, and its texture shows that it was most recently used on a rough surface rather than lips. This soon leads him to look under a table, where he finds the message ""262 V3 L15 Mason Help"". Paul arrives, and Perry tells him about the message, and that it's a trap. If someone really tried to write that while pretending just to be sitting at the table, it would come out in mirror writing. Next, they decipher the message. In Volume 3 of the phone book in the room, on page 262, line 15, they find the name, number, and address of one Herbert Granton. Paul recognizes this as a name Fayette had used in the past. Since the message is a trap, they don't head there. Instead, Paul uses a hall phone to call the front desk and pretend to have airline reservation information for Fayette, but the room number on his paper is illegible. The night clerk, Frank Hoxie (Than Wyenn), obligingly tells him that Fayette doesn't answer, but the room number is 815.

Perry and Paul go there only to find Fayette shot dead. They are soon followed into the room by Tragg and Sgt. Jaffrey (Douglas Kennedy), a vice detective and Claremont's superior at the time of his murder. They had arrived because the guest in the next room had heard arguing and a shot, and called Hoxie who called the police. Hoxie was also cooperating with them when he gave Paul the room number. The detectives wanted to find out what would be done with the information. Now that they've caught Perry and Paul, they press for more information. Jaffrey wants to get rough, but Tragg restrains him and points out that they can take Paul's private investigator's license from him for failing to cooperate. Paul's uncertain what to do, but Perry ends his dilemma by revealing the call from Morey and Dixie. Tragg demands that Perry hand over the pair by noon. Perry says he's unable, but Tragg insists, saying that Perry's status as an officer of the court requires him to cooperate. If Perry doesn't give him the two suspects, Tragg will ask the D.A. to begin disbarment proceedings against him.

However, this is soon rendered moot, as the police pick up Morey and Dixie on their own. In jail, Morey tells Perry that Tom Sedgewick is his half brother and is engaged to Dixie. Tom's connection to the ""Mr. Big"" of the bookmaking operation was through Fayette. Det. Claremont wanted to use Tom in a plan to uncover the top man. When the detective was killed, Tom left and ended up in Portland with Dixie. Perry points out that they had the murder gun with them in Portland, and Morey is shocked to think that his half-brother is guilty after all. He needed to return to the dry climate of L.A. because of tuberculosis, even though he'd been warned by Fayette that this would have fatal consequences. That's why Dixie fled when Fayette showed up at the restaurant. She feared she'd be tortured into revealing Tom's hiding place. While she was hospitalized, she got a call from a woman who said she knew who was Claremont's actual killer and that Dixie should come to the Keymont Hotel. Dixie called Morey to come with her, and he brought his gun for protection. They checked into room 721, but noticed they were being observed. That's when Morey called Perry to come there, but shortly after he hung up, two thugs entered the room at gunpoint, took Morey's gun, and left. Of course, his gun had been found by the police and proved to have been used to kill Fayette.

In court, Hoxie testifies about Morey and Dixie checking into the hotel and asking about room 815. On cross-examination, he admits that he's an ex-con, and he got the hotel job through the help of a sympathetic law officer. He had been working their steadily every since, except for one month the previous year when hotel management sent him to Mexico City to collect on a bill. Perry shows him a photo of Claremont, which Hoxie identifies as a man he saw go to Fayette's room just before the Mexico trip. On recess, Perry tells Paul to find out everything about the ownership of the Keymont hotel. Why would a third-rate hotel fly an employee to Mexico City for a month just to collect on an unpaid bill?

Later, Perry is alone in his office when Sgt. Jaffrey enters. He senses that Perry has worked out a solution, and wants to know if Perry can tell him who killed his subordinate, so he can bring the cop killer to justice. Perry says the sergeant can do that easily just by giving himself up! Jaffrey was the higher-up whom Claremont was trying to track down. Hoxie can testify to Jaffrey's presence at the Keymont, and probably would have blown the whistle earlier if Jaffrey hadn't arranged for him to go to Mexico until the murder was out of the papers. Jaffrey killed Claremont and planted the gun on Tom. Later, he killed Fayette, who started to panic when Dixie disappeared. Perry produces a copy of the Keymont's incorporation papers, showing Jaffrey's signature as owner under a fake name, but in his handwriting. Jaffrey pulls his gun. He plans to say that Perry resisted when Jaffrey was arresting him for attempted bribery. As he prepares to shoot, Tragg, looking in from the next room through a slightly open door, shouts ""Hold it, Jaffrey."" Shots are exchanged and Jaffrey goes down with a bullet to his arm. Tragg is unwounded, but disgusted by the sight of a cop who killed one of his own men. Perry says he should call an ambulance. Tragg agrees but adds, ""Don't hurry.""

Back at Morey's, Perry relates that Jaffrey gave himself away by his astounding lack of curiosity when Perry was pointing out the message under the table. He didn't bother to cross the room to see the message, because he had written it himself. Also, a policeman is far more likely to shoot it out even in unfavorable circumstances rather than give up his gun. However, he would turn over his weapon to a superior officer. When they all order dessert, Perry says he'll take anything Morey has - except for a moth-eaten mink."

A strange man says someone has been murdered and he has two $1,000 bills as a retainer, as well as half of a $10,000 bill that will serve to introduce Perry's mysterious client.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],"['telephone booth', 'blackmail', 'murder', 'trust account', 'embezzlement', 'veiled woman', 'retainer', 'torn bill', '100000 dollar bill', 'male police officer', 'police', 'police officer', 'motel', 'janitor', 'convertible', 'pay phone', 'cigarette smoking', 'courtroom spectator', 'birth certificate', 'secretary', 'lawyer', 'fire escape', 'blood stain']",[],"""The Case of the Baited Hook"" (which could have been called ""Bob and Carol and Tragg and Abigail"")

Bob Dawson (Willard Sage) confronts his partner, Albert Tydings (George N. Neise), about an $80,000 shortfall in a trust account belonging to Carol Stanley (Judith Braun). Tydings amits he embezzled it, but he has a file that prevents Dawson from doing anything. After he leaves, Tydings tells the company clerk, Richard Ellis (Al Hopson), that he himself took only $60,000 and gives Ellis a day to return the extra $20,000. He takes a call for Bob from Carol and arranges for her to come to the office at 10 PM to discuss her account. He seems pleased, but his secretary, Enid Shaw (Mary Castle) looks resentful.

Carol arrives at the office and finds no one there except Tydings, who is slumped over his desk. She calls Bob and tells him that his partner has been murdered. Outside, a policeman tickets Carol's car, which is parked to close to a fire hydrant. Bob (not revealing his identity) and Carol (going him one better with a thick veil) go to Perry's apartment. Bob gives him two ""Grovers"" ($1000 bills) as a retainer. Then he takes out a $10,000 bill, which Perry says he hasn't seen before. (They were very rare even in 1957, and bore the image of Salmon P. Chase, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary.) Bob tears it in half, giving one half to Perry and the other to the disguised Carol. Perry will get Carol's half if the need arises for him to represent her, or return the retainer if he declines the case.

The next morning the no-nonsense Miss Abigail Leeds (Geraldine Wall) barges into Perry's office. She says that in 1939 she was asked to take Carol (then known as Katrina) out of Poland and look after her until her parents could follow. They never made it out. Being single, she put Carol in what she thought was a respectable welfare home, but turned out to be a baby farm, i.e., an adoption-for-pay racket. Luckily, Carol was acquired by the Stanleys, who turned out to be kind. They adopted her legally and left her a six-figure trust fund when they were killed in a car crash. Unluckily, Tydings was named trustee. Abigail knows about his thievery, but only Carol has legal standing to start an investigation, so Abigail will bring Carol to the office that afternoon.

Paul reports that he traced the serial number on the $10,000 bill, and it had been issued to Tydings. Perry wonders if he's been retained by both sides of the same dispute. The pair go to Tydings' house and find blood both inside and out. The trail leads them to a closet, and when they open it, Tydings himself falls out, face forward. Paul calls the police. Back at the office, Perry tells Abigail and Carol that Tydings is dead. Abigail volunteers to be the new trustee, serving at no fee. Lt. Tragg arrives to question Abigail about an unpleasant meeting she'd had with Tydings. She says ""Whoever murdered him did a civic service."" Tragg admires her frankness.

Perry goes to the Tydings and Dawson office. With Tydings dead and Bob having left town last night, Ellis is in charge. He claims professional ethics prevent him from helping Perry. Perry wants to talk to Enid, but is told that she usually comes in late. Paul reports that Bob's car has been found, wrecked, by a lake. While the police are dragging for a body, Paul and Perry join them and don't correct the conclusion to which Officer Duggan (Lyle Latell) has jumped, that they are from the press. Perry points out that no one was driving when the car crashed, as the gas pedal has been wired down. So there's probably no body to find.

That evening, as soon as all the investment office staff have left, Perry and Della sneak in, with Paul as lookout. Perry examines the ledger of Carol's account, which he has a court order to do, and finds evidence of Tydings' defalcations. On the floor he finds the empty shell of a small-caliber bullet, perhaps from a Beretta. If Tydings was shot in his office, why was the body moved miles away to his house? Perry speculates that if a woman shot Tydings and Bob was involved with her, he might move the body to protect her. Perry notes that on his daily calendar for 10 PM the night he was murdered, Tydings made a sketch of a female torso. If Tydings was expecting something to happen, perhaps the woman involved is Enid, as there must be some reason she can come into the office late. Perry gets a frantic phone call from Paul, who had trouble getting through. Tragg is on his way up! They duck out a window onto the fire escape, and evade capture.

Back at the office, they learn that Bob is wanted for murder. Blood found in his car matched Tydings' blood found in his office. Paul's man tailing Carol calls in. She's led him to a motel where Bob is hiding. Paul and Perry go there to question him. However, Tragg has been following Perry (perhaps the fire escape ploy was less effective than Perry thought?) and arrests Bob and Carol. She hands Perry her half of the ""Salmon"". Eventually, the D.A. charges Carol with murder and Bob as an accessory, because the record of the parking ticket shows she was at the office building at that time.

Perry and Della go to Abigail and Carol's house. They find cancelled checks for $150 payments from Abigail to Ellis, going back five years. Perry goes to the T&D office and uses one of the checks, plus a court order, to put an end to Ellis' stalling. The clerk reluctantly hands over Tydings' blackmail file. Perry tells Ellis that he'll no longer have money problems, because by the time he gets out of prison for extortion and grand larceny, he'll be getting his old age pension. Perry tells Abigail that Burger is charging Carol with 1st degree murder, which means the gas chamber if she's convicted. He mentions that he knows who killed Tydings, but can't prove it to a jury. She realizes that he means her, but wonders if he's just a good guesser. He produces Carol's birth certificate, which shows that Abigail is the mother. Unwilling to risk her daughter's fate any more, she confesses. Tragg is waiting in the next office to arrest her, and Perry says he'll defend her. Tragg and Abigail leave, arm in arm. (If you'll forgive an editorial comment that doesn't really belong in a plot synopsis, this is perhaps the lieutenant's finest moment in the entire run of the series.)

Later at Perry's apartment, he has a bad cold and Della is mothering him. Della brings up the case, and Perry mentions that Carol had found out about her parentage while in high school and didn't care. She only avoided mentioning it to her mother to avoid embarrassing her. Della concludes that the murder to protect that secret turned out to be futile and senseless. ""All murders are,"" replies Perry."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0673254/?ref_=ttep_ep15,,"When Perry Mason finds some fans and shoes that belong to a fan dancer, he places an ad that several people mistake for a missing horse. Not only does another fan dancer show up, but so does her husband...dead, leaving Perry confused.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['ranch', 'overturned car', 'stabbed in the chest', 'stabbed to death', 'japanese sword', 'ostrich feather', 'horse', 'fan dancer', 'hotel', 'wall safe', 'landlady', 'telephone booth', 'pay phone', 'record store', 'nightclub', 'car crash', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"At night, a man on horseback rides up to the house at the Callender Ranch. He goes through a window and goes to a wall safe. A watchman sees his flashlight and shouts ""Who's there?"" The would-be burglar flees on his horse, and the watchman shoots at him. The next day, Perry and Della are driving home when they see an old car forced to crash by a reckless driver. They help an old woman out, but have trouble aiding her because she only speaks Spanish. A bilingual driver stops to assist, and takes her off to the hospital before Perry can get more information or give the woman the contents of her car. These prove to be an ostrich-feather fan with the initials ""L.F."" and a pair of high-heeled shoes. The woman in the car was certainly no fan dancer, so Perry assumes she must have been delivering it to someone else.

To keep this from getting too confusing, it needs to be noted now that two women bear the legal name Lois Fenton and stage name Cherie Chi Chi. The one who was born Lois Fenton (Susan Cummings) is always referred to as Lois in the episode. The one who was born Irene Kilby (Judy Tyler) and later changed her name to Lois Fenton is called Irene in court but otherwise is always called Cherie Chi Chi, so that name will be used here.

The next day, rancher John Callender (Hugh Sanders) arrives at Perry's office in response to an ad in the paper: ""If the 'fan dancer' who lost certain property wishes to recover it, write to Box #9052, L.A., Cal."" Callender explains how he tricked the paper's ad office into revealing Perry's identify and produces a letter from ""Lois Fenton, stage name Cherie Chi Chi"" authorizing Callender to pick up her property. He describes the property as a palomino quarter horse, which of course Perry says is completely wrong. Callender accuses him of a shakedown, and gives Perry until the next morning to surrender the horse. He's staying in Room 511 at the Richmel Hotel. Gertie (Connie Cezon) enters with a note from Arthur Sheldon (Scott Elliott), who's also looking for a horse belonging to ""the real Lois Fenton"". He wants Perry to come to Room 510 at the Richmel.

That evening, Perry and Della are at a club where Cherie Chi Chi is doing her fan dancing act. She comes to their table, and Perry says what he found wasn't a horse. She correctly describes the fan and shoes, so he agrees that the waiter can pick them up for her from Perry's car. She kisses him and leaves. Perry goes to the Richmel to see Arthur. Lois is hiding in the bathroom. Arthur says that Lois is married to Callender, but he mistreated her and she's left him. To force her back, the rancher says he has checks that her brother Jasper (John Brinkley) forged. The burglary at Callender Ranch was a botched attempt to retrieve the checks. Jasper stole Lois' horse for the effort, and the watchman is sure that his shot wounded the animal. Callender wants the horse so he can accuse Jasper of burglary. Perry orders Arthur to check out of the room immediately and bring Lois to his office the following day.

Perry calls Paul and tells him to put a man in Room 510 immediately and have another tail Arthur. Also, he needs Paul to start looking for the missing horse. The next morning, Perry and Paul knock on Callender's door. They get no answer, but the room is unlocked. Callender has been run through with a sword. Returning to 510, Paul calls the police, and Perry gets a report from Paul's man, Frank Faulkner (Robert Bice): He arrived at 2:20, but Arthur hadn't checked out yet, so he bribed Meeker the house detective (James Nolan) to let him hide in a broom closet. As he did so, Arthur ran out of Room 511 back to 510. At 2:23, a woman carrying a violin case went into 511 and came out at 2:32, still with the violin case. Later, a ""character"" wearing a buttoned-up overcoat in midsummer went into 511 and popped out again ten seconds later. When Lt. Tragg arrives, Paul goes to him and says he happened to have the room under surveillance. Tragg immediately thinks this is a Perry Mason case, and Paul grudgingly confirms Perry's interest, but states he doesn't know where Perry is at the moment. Tragg warns Paul that is Perry is holding back information, he'll throw the book at both of them. Tragg then marches over to 510, but Perry has already left.

Perry meets Della at a diner and warns her that Tragg has a man following him. The lieutenant thinks Lois killed Callender and Perry is harboring her. Della reports that Paul has found the horse. Perry tells Della to have Lois meet him at a record shop later. He next visits Cherie at her apartment. She explains that she received the Cherie Chi Chi act when Lois retired to marry Callender. She made herself as much like Lois as possible with clothes, etc., and even changed her legal name. She insists she visited Room 511 at 2 AM, not 2:23, to show him that Perry had returned her fan. However, Callender still thought Perry had the horse. At the record shop, Perry finally meets Lois face-to-face. She admits to hiding from Perry when he visited Arthur, and after he left impulsively going over to 511 to tell her husband she'd ""get back"" at him if he kept making trouble. When he laughed at this, she got frightened, ran out of the room and down the stairs, and did not return to the hotel that night. She also explains that at the time she left Callender, she intended to go back to fan dancing, as she'd made an agreement with her replacement that she could re-assume the Cherie Chi Chi act whenever she wanted. Unfortunately, the rancher had the only copy of that agreement. Perry, not wanting her to give the appearance of hiding, tells her to check into a motel near where Starlight is now stabled. In the flight from the burglary attempt, the horse only suffered a scratch, because the bullet went into the saddle.

Later, Perry and Lois visit the stables, and Perry has the stable hand (Dennis Moore) put the saddle in his car. Lois says that Arthur rented a room at a cheap boarding house as a place for Jasper, but he never appeared, so Arthur went there when he left the Richmel. He found a bloody fan there. When Lois arrived, she tried to wash it out and then threw it away. Perry thinks she's holding back from him, and decides they should go to the police. While he's dealing with stable paperwork, Lois rushes to his car and drives off.

The next day's newspaper headline reveals that she's been arrested, and things look bad for her. The police have two witnesses, house detective Meeker and Paul's operative Faulkner, who identified Lois as the woman who entered Room 511 at 2:23. Jasper has confessed that he took Starlight and attempted the burglary. The police have the saddle with the bullet. A bellboy says he saw the sword among Callender's possessions when he checked into the Richmel, so Jasper couldn't have seen and grabbed it and used it to stab Callender during his ten-second stay in the room. The police found Cherie, assured themselves that it wasn't her but Lois that the two witnesses identified, and released her.

In court, Dr. Lambert (Herbert Lytton) testifies that he found portions of an ostrich plume in Callender's stab wound. Meeker testifies that he saw Lois in the lobby at 2:20 - he pointed her out at the police shadow box. Faulkner explains the workings of the shadow box (basically an early version of the one-way mirror) and says that he, too, identified Lois - both times. Questioned by Perry, Faulkner says that Lois was very sulky the first time in the shadow box and that Sgt. Holcomb (Rusty Wescoatt) had them repeat the identification 20 minutes later. When court is recessed, Lois confirms that she was taken into the shadow box twice, but firmly denies that she was sulky the first time. Faulkner, feeling guilty for being forced to testify against the people he's working for, gives Perry a tip: Cherie is being voluntarily held in police custody.

When the trial resumes, Perry complains to the judge (Sydney Smith) that Cherie is being held incommunicado. Burger claims he has the right to hold material witnesses and doesn't even have to prove that he'll actually call them. However, he does agree to produce Cherie. Meanwhile, Jasper testifies that he did see the dead Callender when he popped into room 511. He told no one at the time, but the next day he went to the police and gave them a written statement. When Cherie enters the courtroom, the judge has her and Lois stand side-by-side. They clearly aren't identical twins, but look very similar in a general way. As Perry begins to question Cherie about the shadow box, Burger objects, and Perry explains to the judge what happened. The police had arrested Cherie under her new legal name of ""Lois Fenton"", and it was she whom Faulkner and Meeker identified on the first time in the shadow box. Realizing their mistake, they had the witnesses come back and make the identification again, this time with the original Lois. Finally, they had Lois come back again to the shadow box, with no identifying witnesses, just so she would confirm that she'd gone there twice. Burger catches Sgt. Holcomb before he can leave the court and vows to get to the bottom of this. In any case, Perry can now continue his examination of Cherie. She testifies that she's the one who entered Room 511 at 2:23, but Callender was already dead. Jasper's earlier ten-second visit to the room tends to confirm this. The judge says that unless Burger has some refuting evidence, he'll direct the jury to acquit.

Later, at a club, Perry admits that lawyers can get too cynical about their clients. He would have been better off if he'd believed from the first everything Lois told him. He explained that around 2 AM, Callender was showing Jasper the fan, illustrating that's what Perry had found so the horse (and the threat it represented to Jasper) still remained to be found. As the rancher held the fan in front of him, Jasper took up the sword and stabbed him right through the fan. He came back later to remove the fan, having realized that it could incriminate his sister. Arthur's peculiar movements that night were also just an attempt to deflect the police from Lois. Cherie had spent ten minutes in a room with a murdered man looking for that agreement that she'd relinquish the fan dancing act to Lois. As the night club act comes on - we see it's now Lois - the waiter delivers a memento from her to Perry - an ostrich-feather fan."

The dictatorial uncle tells her she can't get married and has her look at papers he threatens to show her fiancé. With a nasty laugh he asks her ""Do you plan to have a big family? What if the kids take after your side?"" Nadine is reduced to tears. Later she visits John in his lab and tells him perhaps having a wife at this early stage in his career would be a burden. He reassures her that he loves her. While he's distracted, she steals some KCN (potassium cyanide) tablets, putting them in a saccharine bottle. After she leaves, John notices that his bottle of KCN has been moved.

When she returns home, Martin is asking for his nightly hot chocolate. He has spent the day with his lawyer and tells his other relative Marian Newburn (Fay Baker) and her husband Lester (Walter Coy) that he's going to leave all his money to the medical foundation that has been helping him. In the kitchen, Marian sees Nadine's ""saccharine"" bottle and sniffs it suspiciously. Elsewhere, Lester tells Nadine he was worried about her, but couldn't phone because Marian would misunderstand. When the hot chocolate is ready, Nadine takes it to her uncle. Soon she is summoned back to find him in death throes. He manages to say ""You poisoned me, you devil!"". Nadine screams.

Dr. Robert Denair (Barry Atwater), a psychiatrist, plays a tape recording of Nadine while under a truth serum. She talks about poisoning her uncle and throwing the pill bottle in Westside Lake after weighing it down with short from a shotgun shell. Denair has been treating her since three days after Uncle Martin's death, as she's been on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Perry wonders if what she says under the drug is necessarily true. Furthermore, Martin's death certificate listed the cause of death as coronary thrombosis. Perry tells the doctor he's under an obligation to report a crime to the police, but if it turns out there is no crime, he could be sued. To be better able to advise the psychiatrist, Perry sees Nadine at the hospital. He takes the tape and tape recorder from Denair, so no one will stumble on them. As he leaves, Nurse Wilson (Lida Piazza), who knows all about Nadine's case, is on the phone, spilling the beans to Lt. Tragg.

At Westside Lake, Perry has a snack at a hotdog stand while two children are in the lake. One of them, Arthur (Rickie Sorensen), shouts ""I found it!"" and shows Perry a saccharine bottle. At an analysis lab, Perry instructs Arthur to hand the bottle to Dr. Korbell (Steven Geray), who will check the contents for cyanide. Perry returns to his office to learn that Nadine has disappeared from the hospital. Dr. Korbell calls, reporting that Tragg arrived to take the bottle. Now the police want Perry for evidence tampering, so Perry goes to Tragg's office with Arthur, who says that Perry never had possession of the bottle. When The lieutenant checks with the crime lab, which reports that the bottle only contained saccharine. Tragg lets Perry leave with the tape recorder seized from his office, but keeps the tape of Nadine.

At Perry's apartment, Paul reports that police divers have found another bottle in Westside Lake, and it does contain KCN. Tragg now thinks that Perry planted the bottle of saccharine to confuse things, as the lakeside hot dog vendor swears he saw Perry throw something in the lake. Perry and Della intercept John as he leaves a market with two bags filled with groceries. He denies that Nadine stole any KCN, but Perry warns him that Burger will break down any attempt to lie on the stand. Della says it's a shame he and Nadine aren't married, since a husband can't testify against his wife. As a police officer approaches, John suddenly gets in his car and speeds off.

At the Newburn house, Perry is talking to Lester, who lets slip that he knows two bottles were found in the lake, which hadn't been made public. He claims he planted the saccharine bottle because he felt sorry for Nadine. However, he vows that he won't repeat his admission, even on the witness stand. After Perry leaves, Marian snaps at her husband, showing her jealousy of Nadine. She reminds Lester that Martin left all his money to her. Paul has learned that the police caught Nadine and John at the Mexican border - they're not married. In jail, Nadine tells Perry that the papers with which Martin threatened Nadine's marriage showed that her father had been committed to an institution for the criminally insane. She told John about this when he insisted on trying to get a quicky marriage. He told her, as does Perry, that experts agree there's no such thing as a ""bad seed"" that she could have inherited. Nadine doesn't know what to believe.

On the witness stand in Nadine's trial, John tries to avoid perjury while not accusing Nadine of stealing KCN, but his prevarications are transparent. Martin's physician Dr. Granby (Maurice Manson) testifies that although he had put coronary thrombosis on the death certificate, mainly because Martin had a history of heart disease, he has changed his mind since the autopsy. He now believes the cause of death was poisoning. On cross, he admits that while the autopsy proved there wasn't a coronary, it couldn't actually confirm cyanide poisoning because the body had previously been embalmed. Other than lack of other explanation, the main reason to cite poisoning as cause of death was Nadine's taped confession. Perry says that means his testimony is hearsay.

The time has arrived to hear arguments on the admissibility of the tape, so the judge (Morris Ankrum) has the jury retire. Burger says a confession, no matter how obtained, is admissible as long as he can corroborate it with other evidence, which he proceeds to do. He introduces (A) a shotgun shell from which shot has been removed,; (B) the bottle containing KCN and shot, and (C) the bottle of saccharine, also with shot. Perry calls Lester to refute prosecution claims that the defense attorney planted Exhibit C. However, Lester denies everything, just as he said he would. Perry requests that he be allowed to take the stand to impeach his own witness. He's holding the two bottles and becomes absorbed in them until the judge calls him out of his reverie. Perry then withdraws his objection to admitting the tape, saying he doesn't want his client to be labelled a murderess who got off on a technicality. The judge says he can't just waive his client's right and asks Nadine if she'd prefer new representation. She says that she trusts Perry.

With the jury back, Perry points out that while the shot in the shotgun shell A and in the saccharine bottle C are the same type, the shot in the poison bottle B is larger. Sgt. Davis (Paul Hahn), a police ballistics expert, confirms this, saying that the shot in Exhibit B was coated with what appeared to be ink. Perry introduces an old-fashioned pen holder, which Paul had taken from Lester's house while Sgt. Davis was being summoned. This type of pen holder contains shot, which helps keep the pen clean. Back on the stand, Lester now admits to throwing the bottle of poison in the lake, to protect his wife, who was the murderer. Marian shouts ""That's a lie!"" Lester says that Capt. Hugo told him he saw Marian put the cyanide in the chocolate. Over Marian's continued protests, the judge orders her held on suspicion of murder and Lester arrested for perjury.

At the Wellman house, Perry accuses Capt. Hugo of being the murderer. John had called the house right after noticing that some KCN was missing and told Hugo about it. So the Captain knew about the poison Nadine had taken and put it in the chocolate. The old salt admits it. Della wonders why, if he was out to protect Nadine, he didn't come forward when she was arrested. He replies that he had faith in Perry. They need to turn Hugo in, but he figures that he'll still come out ahead."

She claims it contains her diary, which details the truthful account of a notorious bank heist her father was convicted for.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Ted Post'],"['', '']",[],"['nude sunbathing', 'trailer', 'golf course', 'pay phone', 'newspaper headline', 'grand jury', 'perjury', 'pulled over by the police']",[],"In a wooded area, a man spies on Arlene Dowling (Susan Morrow) as she sunbathes in a clearing. He finds her trailer a short distance away, just far enough for him to hook it up to his own vehicle and drive off with it, undetected. When Arlene discovers her trailer is gone, she seems to have nothing but her towel to cover herself, but somehow she makes it back to civilization intact, and engages Perry Mason to recover the trailer. Its greatest importance to her is the diary hidden in it, which records everything she has discovered in her efforts to clear her father, currently in prison for having stolen a large amount of cash while employed at a bank. She is being helped in her researches by her father's friend George Ballard (Ralph Moody), a bank examiner at the time of the defalcation, who wishes he could clear Dad, but didn't have his eyes on him the whole time.

Perry finds the trailer by placing an ad in the paper. Arlene is shocked by such a prosaic move, but George tells her that Mason is being clever, because what matters is success. Mason receives a call to go to a used car lot, and in turns calls Arlene to join him there. They find the trailer, and while Mason deals with the lot owner, pointing out that he's trying to sell stolen property, Arlene enters the trailer, only to find the diary missing. She pays off Mason, but later he receives another payment anonymously by mail. Perry decides he better keep looking into the case. The leads him to Dr. Chandler (Carl Betz), who provides medical services for bank employees, and is also romantically involved with Arlene, and thus ready to help however he can. Perry also encounters Chandler's nurse, Helen Rucker (Gertrude Michael), and a former bank employee now reduced to hustling pool for a living, Bill Emory (Peter Leeds).

Finally, Perry decides it's time to talk directly to Arlene's friend George, who is quite cooperative even though Perry's arrival interrupted George as he listened to his favorite radio show, featuring a sports commentator. As their conversation covers what George knows, he mentions in passing that he remembers the serial number of one particular bill, because it corresponded to a bet in a horse race which George made, and won a tidy sum. Perry realizes that this serial number appears on one of the bills with which he was paid through the mail - obviously a trap. As George is in the kitchen, Perry rolls down a window shade, puts the bill inside, and rolls it up again.

Outside, two plainclothesmen are staking out George's house. Detective Myers (Walter Reed) spots the window shade going up and down, shortly followed by Arlene entering. He thinks the man at the window looks familiar, and when his partner Sgt. Neil (Marc Pickard) asks if it could be Perry Mason, Myers says yes. Soon, it turns out that George has been murdered, Arlene is suspected, and Perry is on the hot seat as a possible accessory. D.A. Burger thinks the raising and lowering of the shade was some kind of signal to his client. Perry does manage to track down Arlene (thanks to the rather lame efforts of Dr. Chandler to keep her hidden) and convince her to turn herself in, but he's still in trouble.

At the trial, various secrets are revealed. George, of course, was the real culprit behind the original theft of the bank's money. Detective Myers didn't see Perry raise and lower the shade after all, that was a coincidence: The radio sports show on ended over half an hour before the time reported by the detectives, and Perry was only in George's house for a few minutes. Nurse Rucker was heavily involved in a scheme to get the money, working behind the back of the clueless Dr. Chandler, but she had an alibi for the murder. By process of elimination, the ringleader of the plot, the one who murdered George, was the pool hustler, Bill Emory.

Later, at a restaurant, Burger sees Perry and apologizes about the accusations he made. Perry offers to buy the D.A. a meal to show there are no hard feelings. He asks the waitress to bring Burger a serving of crow."

He gives her a week to pay him off, or he'll reveal their marriage to Elaine's rich boyfriend Ross Hollister (James Seay). Later, Elaine is swimming with Ross at his pool when his business partner Sheila Cromwell (Virginia Gregg) drops by. Ross has been checking the company books, but won't be finished until the next day. Ross is about to leave town, and the easiest way for Sheila to get the books - and Ross's report on them - is for Ross to take Elaine's spare apartment key so he can drop off the books and report there even if Elaine is asleep or away. He'll leave the key under the mat so Sheila can pick them up, also independently of Elaine's presence. Sheila and Elaine leave, and Ross reads his mail - a report from a private investigator that Harry has been visiting Elaine.

At his office, Perry gets a letter, stating that by going to Elaine's apartment he can find the license number of the car involved in the hit-and-run of his client Robert Finchley (Brett Halsey). A key is enclosed so he can let himself in. Perry goes there and cautiously uses the key. Inside, he finds Elaine asleep in her bed, so he goes back out and rings the doorbell. She lets him in and professes to know nothing about the hit-and-run, but while she's making coffee, Perry finds a license number written down. Elaine says she may need Perry's help, but he just calls her a good actress and leaves. Paul Drake traces the license number to Stephen Argyle (Donald Randolph), who claims to have been at his country club from well before to well after the time of the hit-and-run. For corroboration, he calls in his chauffeur, who turns out to be Harry Pitkin! Later, Harry goes to the country club and bribes the doorman to lie, backing up Argyle's alibi. However, insurance adjuster Francis Bates (Chet Stratton) discovers this dodge almost immediately. Argyle's and Harry's handling of the matter have ended up making him look obviously guilty of the hit-and-run. Bates suggests to Argyle that they bypass Perry and settle directly with Finchley.

Perry is grumbling about this shady dealing when he gets a call from Elaine, begging him to come to her apartment. There, she shows him Harry's corpse, with her revolver lying nearby. Charged with murdering Harry, she tells Perry about the arrangement involving her spare key. She doesn't understand how it ended up being sent to Perry. From Sheila, Perry learns that she and Ross were also in business with Argyle. She also says that Ross is doing business at various places in Canada, and she doesn't know where he'll be until he calls her.

At the preliminary hearing, with Sheila on the stand, Perry goes over the complicated scheme for dropping off the company books, then asks Sheila why she did nothing when she couldn't get into Elaine's apartment to pick them up. (The spare key went to Perry, not under the mat.) She tries denying that the books were important, but Perry counters that Ross must have been looking for a major problem with the accounting. Sheila then breaks down, prompting the judge to call a recess until the next day. In the interim, Sheila sends a telegram to Ross in Halsey, California. Paul is tailing her and soon knows about a whole series of telegrams that Sheila has been sending him there. When Sheila is back on the stand, Perry confronts her with this, but she still won't explain. Burger calls an Orange Country deputy sheriff (Ed Hinton), who testifies that Ross's body was found on the beach, shot about a week before Harry's murder.

The next day, Argyle is reading a newspaper with the headline ""HOLLISTER MURDERED - Mason's Theory Boomerangs"". Sheila enters, wielding a gun. She accuses Argyle of embezzling $187,000 from the business, murdering Ross when he discovered it, framing himself for hit-and-run as an alibi, then murdering Harry to cover that up. Argyle throws his drink in Sheila's face and grabs the gun. He can barely get his threat to her out when Lt. Tragg enters and arrests him. The gun wasn't loaded because people can get hurt that way, he explains. Perry congratulates Sheila on her performance. She was glad to help, since she was only lying because she thought she was protecting Ross, whom she loved.

In his office, Perry explains that once he knew the sequence of events, he concluded that Argyle murdered Ross, took the key from him, and sent it to Perry as part of framing himself for hit and run. He's interrupted by the appearance of Bates, whose insurance company is upset with him for paying off an incorrect claim. (Argyle may be a double murderer, but he didn't commit the hit and run.) Perry points out that the standard release form Bates used when he paid off Finchley admitted no liability, so Finchley gets to keep the money, and Bates should leave now. Perry, Della, and Paul toast Bates as he slouches off, probably to start looking for a new job."

On the way to stay with her friend Doris Stephanak (Karen Steele) in Los Angeles, her purse is stolen in Fresno and she's reduced to hitchhiking. She's picked up in a Lincoln driven by Michael Greeley (John Hubbard) (but Carol doesn't know his name). He drunkenly grabs at her, and in their struggle, he sideswipes a truck. In his office, D.A. Burger receives a report from his subordinate Hanley (Harlan Warde). The truck driver was killed, but Claire was just knocked out and awoke with cuts and bruises. Greeley has apparently vanished, as the prosecutors assume she was the drunk driver, and plan to charge her with theft and manslaughter.

Doris goes to Perry's office to get help for her friend, who has been arrested. Perry, going by the newspaper report, doesn't think this is his kind of case, but at Della's urging, he listens to Doris, who explains what really happened to Claire. Later, Paul has learned that the car the unknown man was driving is owned by Jerry Heywood (Grant Richards), the wunderkind of Magnum Studios, where he makes the magnificent (in 1958) salary of $3,000 per week. He denies being the driver or having loaned his car to anyone, but this is suspect because he recently had argued with his insurance company over a claim and as a result is currently uninsured.

Perry goes to see Heywood, but just gets a repetition of what Heywood told the police and is shown out by Heywood's butler and general factotum, Ernie Tanner (Fredd Wayne). Heywood calls the Greeley home and is told by Marcia Greeley (Helen Westcott) that her husband is out. They agree that he could cause trouble for them. Tanner tells Heywood he wants a raise, and alludes to Heywood having lied about being home the entire day of the crash. Angry, Heywood pushes him out of the room.

In jail, Claire recounts her encounter in the Lincoln, adding a detail she'd forgotten before - in the struggle, she got lipstick on the driver's shirt. Perry says he'll arrange bail and pays for Claire and Doris to stay at the Gateview Hotel under the name ""Joan Lewis"". They do so, but we see Greeley bribing a desk clerk at the Gateview to show him ""Joan's"" registration card. It occurs to Perry that the drunk driver might be desperate enough to go after Carol. Della calls her room at the hotel, but there's no answer. At the hotel, Perry peeks through the transom window and sees a body on the floor. Paul calls Lt. Tragg, and they enter the room together. The body is identified as Michael Greeley, a public relations worker at Magnum Studios. Tragg immediately suspects Claire.

Perry interviews Marcia without mentioned her husband's death. She says that Michael was at a premiere that night, and that her husband might give a ride to a woman but isn't the sort who'd leave her in the lurch. The discussion ends when Tragg calls Marcia with the grim news. Doris tells Perry that Carol had left the room because her arm was bothering her and she went to a drug store for aspirin. When she returned and saw the dead Greeley, she panicked and went to Doris' apartment, where the police found her. They've pieced together what happened and have dropped the theft and manslaughter charges against Carol, but Burger is going to try her for 1st degree murder.

Tanner calls to leave a tip - Heywood has a lodge near Fresno. Perry wants more information out of Tanner, who has an eye for the ladies. Paul's usual operative for this sort of thing isn't available, so Doris volunteers. Meeting Tanner at his regular bar and getting friendly with him, she learns that Heywood's car was apparently driven nearly 700 miles between the day before the crash, when it was serviced, and the crash.Tanner adds that he got fed up with Heywood, socked him, and quit. He's not afraid because he has something on Heywood - something that relates to Greeley.

Meanwhile, Perry gets a call from Marcia, saying she's coming to the office to give him something that belonged to her husband, but won't say what. Perry guesses that it's the lipstick-stained shirt, which would have helped confirm Carol's story when she was charged with theft and manslaughter, but now will just help Burger. He hopes he can figure out a way not to accept it from Marcia. Before she arrives, Perry gets a call from Doris. She had left Tanner's hotel room to get him some coffee and returned to find him collapsing in the bathtub. Perry goes there, finds Tanner shot dead, with a pillow having been used as a makeshift silencer. After he takes Doris home, he returns to the office to deal with Marcia, but his quandary is solved when Tragg barges in and takes possession of the shirt. It's a rainy night, and Tragg notices that Perry's shoes are wet. The lieutenant also spots a pillow feather on the office floor. Later in the police lab, Tragg tells Burger that the shirt isn't Greely's size and doesn't share the laundry mark of his actual shirts. Burger thinks Perry planted it to trip up the prosecution. He'll reverse the situation by simply doing nothing about the shirt.

In court, Perry is surprised when Burger doesn't introduce it as evidence. He cross-examines Heywood, who claims the car sat unused between when it was service and when it was stolen. Using the odometer data, Perry points out that this meant it was driven over 600 miles during a 9-hour period, in traffic. The drive is consistent with a round trip to the Fresno lodge (assuming he left earlier, not when he said the car was stolen). Heywood denies it. Perry gets the shirt from Burger and shows that it's laundry mark matches the one the Heywood is wearing. He claims that Greeley hired Tanner to spy on Heywood. When Heywood left for his lodge with Marcia, Tanner told Greeley, who went to the lodge and stole the car to strand them there, intending to blackmail Heywood to avoid a scandal. Marcia panicked when they found the car gone, which is why she accidentally packed Heywood's shirt in her own bag. Perry then accuses Heywood of the murder, but Marcia rises to his defense and confesses that she killed both men. She even apologizes to Heywood for causing him so much trouble.

Later, Tragg tells Perry that he was very lucky that Marcia confessed, because there was no way he could have linked her to the killings. Perry asks if, in their long acquaintance, Tragg had ever thought him stupid. Tragg says he thought Perry was unscrupulous, conniving, and unprincipled - but never stupid. Perry then asks what the lieutenant would call someone who was at a murder scene in wet shoes with feathers spread around but didn't check his shoes for them. ""Stupid"", answers Tragg, and he immediately concludes that the feather in Perry's office got there on someone else. Eliminating Perry and himself, he realizes it had to be Marcia. ""Oy gevalt!"" he says as he leaves, somewhat abashed."

Agnes Sims (Betty Lou Gerson) sees him and tells her partner Edmund Arthur Lacey (Robert H. Harris) about it. Lacey tries to follow George, but gets a powerful sock in the face for his trouble. He goes to Paul Drake's office and explains his lonely-hearts magazine to Paul, drawing attention to an ad from an attractive 23-year-old woman with a big inheritance. Lacey needs to prove to the postal authorities that this isn't a fraud, and his own efforts to find her have been unsuccessful (and painful). Paul charges him $200, then composes a letter in which he frankly admits he's writing because she's rich, and which he'll mail to Box 96.

In her home, Marilyn Clark (Kathleen Crowley) reads a letter that sounds like Paul's to George, her step-brother. However, this letter is from a Charles B. Bartleby. Despite George's doubts, she answers it with an invitation to meet. When she meets Charlie, he's unsure of himself and something of a rube, but Marilyn is charmed. Later, Lacey phones Paul to call him off, saying that Marilyn has revealed herself, and the postal authorities are satisfied. In fact, Lacey is with Charlie, who has dropped his rustic accent, and Charlie's accomplice Delores (Anna Navarro), who plays the jealous other woman in the ""blow off"" of their con game. Although Marilyn might be good for up to $75,000, Charlie will only let Lacey have $1000. Lacey can't go to the police, because he interfered with the U.S. mails when he substituted Charlie's letter for Paul's original one.

The con game enters its next stage as Charlie tells Marilyn that he needs money to pay for drilling for oil on his land, or he'll lose everything. Her solution is that they get married, and they kiss. Paul goes to Perry, worried that Lacey's shenanigans could cost him his license. Deciding he needed to know what was going on, he tailed Marilyn (who really is a wealthy heiress) and saw her getting a certified check for $50,000 from her bank. Marilyn also met Charlie, whom Paul recognized as a well-known con man. Paul saw Charlie purchase a wedding ring, then pick up two airline tickets to Rio at a travel agency. Perry recommends that Paul inform the bunco squad.

Lacey is lurking around outside Charlie's motel bungalow when Marilyn arrives and enters. They're about to get married, and Marilyn gives Charlie the certified check. Charlie brings out some champagne, but he's still doing his bumbling act and has to hunt around for glasses. Delores enters and goes into her screaming, furniture wrecking act, which frightens Marilyn off. As she's leaving, Delores gives Charlie a good whack on the head, and he falls to the floor. Lt. Kramer (Robert B. Williams) of the bunco squad enters, expecting to arrest Charlie and Delores, but Charlie is dead.

A distraught Delores confesses to Lt. Tragg, who informs her that Charlie wasn't kill by the blow, but by poison. He orders an APB for the arrest of Marilyn. George asks Perry for help and brings her to Marilyn. She explains that a year ago, her sister fell for Charlie's con game, became pregnant by him, and committed suicide after he left with her money. She left a diary with the detailed story, giving Marilyn the information she needed to lure Charlie into trying the same thing with her, so she could turn him over to the authorities. Poison was never part of the plan. Marilyn doesn't want to turn herself in, but Perry makes it a condition for helping her.

Perry interviews Delores and points out that she and Lacey are also possible suspects in the murder. On his way out, he has to dodge an ashtray thrown at him by the temperamental Delores. A little later, Lacey is taking money from the safe in his private office, when Delores starts shooting at the door from the outside, shouting ""Assassino!"". She enters, but has exhausted her rounds. Tragg enters and arrests both her and Lacey. They were tipped off about Lacey by Agnes, who realized that he was absconding with her share of the lonely-hearts profits as well as his own.

In court, Lacey can't explain what he was doing outside Charlie's bungalow on the night of the murder. George admits that if anything happened to Marilyn, he would inherit her fortune. Delores testifies that on the day the blow off concluding the con game was to occur, she followed their standard procedure. She packed, paid off the motel bill, picked up airline tickets, then waited out of sight until the moment for her betrayed woman act came. She refuses to answer Perry's cross-examination questions, so Perry agrees to defer them until after Burger has a chance to explain the consequences to her. The autopsy surgeon (Robert McQueeney) testifies that Charlie was killed with prussic acid, which was in the champagne bottle. After adjournment, Paul and Della go to the motel to reenact how the poisoning could have occurred. Perry's unhappy, because Marilyn could have added the poison while Charlie was getting glasses, and he can't find an alternative. Della draws a comparison to a ship in a bottle, which gives Perry an idea.

Delores is back on the stand, now prepared to answer Perry. He goes on the attack immediately, pointing out that when she picked up tickets (to Hawaii) at the travel agency, she could have found out about the two to Rio that Charlie had already picked up. He was planning on abandoning her and really going off with Marilyn. He produces a hypodermic syringe like one that Delores bought the day before the murder. She responds that she's a diabetic, as her doctor can verify. Perry seems nonplussed for moment, but then points out that a diabetic's syringe would have a needle much shorter than the 2-inch needle on the one Delores bought. However, it's perfect for injecting poison through the cork of a champagne bottle. Delores breaks down and confesses. ""If I don't have him, nobody can!""

In his office, Perry explains that Delores shot at Lacey just to avert suspicion from herself. She had no intention of hitting him. The one thing that got Perry thinking about her was the wedding ring Charlie bought, which he wouldn't need unless he planned to really marry Marilyn."

Stanley (James Bell) at a flophouse to discuss the $50,000 J.J. embezzled from the Texas National Bank ten years earlier. J.J.'s partner Ned Bain (Carl Benton Reid) is now rich and respectable. West insists that J.J. help blackmail Ned. Later, a car parks in front of the Colegrove Apartments and Harriet Bain (Virginia Vincent) - looking what in 1958 would probably be called ""mousy"" - gets out and goes to Apartment 2A, West's residence. He plays a tape recording of J.J. and her father discussing a payoff to cover up the embezzlement. Harriet refuses to believe it and runs out in tears.

She goes to Perry's office and tells her tale to Della, as Perry is in court. Harriet knows about the tape because her father has heart trouble and needs her help with things like handling phone calls. She explains that she wants to avoid bad publicity because of Addison Doyle (Robin Hughes), a friend of her stepsister Sylvia (Tina Carver), with whom she is now engaged. Even Harriet is surprised that Addison picked her over the more glamorous Sylvia. Since Addison is from a conservative old Boston family, a scandal could ruin things for her. Although Perry is set to fly to London for a law conference, Della talks him into delaying his departure to help Harriet. Paul knows West as a slick and unscrupulous operator and will put a tail on him in the hopes of leading to J.J. Perry also needs Della to purchase a small magnet for him.

When West plays the tape for Perry, the attorney insists on examining it to check that it hasn't been spliced together. As West shows him the tape, Perry takes out a cigarette from his cigarette case, which also has the magnet hidden inside. In this way he degausses the tape and when West tries to play it again, there's just silence. West says he'll need time to figure out what's wrong, so Perry leaves, having succeeded in delaying West's plans. West takes the tape recorder and a bottle of booze across the hall to 2B, where J.J. is now staying. Later, he calls Perry and says he has another copy of the tape.

Harriet tells Perry that Ned now knows about the tape and insists it's a fake, so they go to see him. He explains that he was an oil wildcatter who got financing from J.J. When he struck it rich, J.J. was paid back and got his share of the profits, but later turned to drink. The last Ned saw of him was when he gave him a handout six months ago. Ned refuses to pay blackmail, but authorizes Perry to get the tape back however else he can, in order to protect Harriet and her impending nuptials. Perry could use help tracking down J.J., but Ned says he doesn't have an address or even a phone number for him. On his way out, Perry passes Addison and Sylvia, who seem to be acting rather friendlier toward each other than one might expect of prospective in-laws.

That night, Ned gets out of bed, already fully dressed. He takes a bag engraved with his initials with him and sneaks out of the house, but Harriet notices him go. He goes to J.J. at his apartment and tells him that his motto is ""Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today - or tonight."" Downstairs, a cab is waiting and the driver (Leonard Bell) notices a car park behind him. The car is the one we saw Harriet driving earlier. Ned comes out, no longer carrying his case, goes to the cab, and tells the driver to return him to the corner where he picked him up.

Paul has learned that J.J. is staying in 2B. Perry and Della go to meet West. There's a note for Perry on the door to 2A saying that West is out and they should come in and wait. Perry is doubtful, and then Harriet screams and rushes out of 2A, saying she found a body in the kitchen which she thinks is J.J.'s. Perry says ""It's a trap!"" (Cf. ) He decides to check out 2B, telling Della to ring the bell if anyone is coming up on the elevator. Inside J.J.'s apartment, Perry finds nothing particularly suspicious, but he seems oddly interested in the food contained in a deep freezer. He gets the signal from Della and notices West leading her and Harriet into his apartment. Perry comes in behind them, pretending he just got there. West says he's been away much of the night, playing poker. When he sees the body in his kitchen, he seems surprised and worried. He calls the police. When they arrive, Lt. Tragg learns from Dr. Hanover (Dennis King Jr.) of the Coroner's office that death was caused by bleeding from puncture wounds, caused by something like an ice pick. From the body temperature, he estimates death occurred no later than 3 AM, but will know more later. Tragg's men find an ice pick.

In the office, Paul reports that Tragg knows all about Perry's sojourn into Apartment 2B. West had left a tape recorder set to start recording sounds in the hallway at 9 AM, and it picked up everything Perry, Della, and Harriet had said. Tragg has had everyone in the Bain household fingerprinted. After learning that Ned has suffered a heart attack he rushes to him at home. He learns from Ned's doctor (Alan Gifford) that Ned will pull through although with great difficulty and that the attack must have been caused by severe strain of some sort. He also hands Harriet a tape reel in its metal case that he found under Ned's pillow. Perry takes it and asks Harriet if she left the house that night or knows if her father left the house. She lies on both counts. Addison says Sylvia was at his place that night, but it was all ""perfectly proper"". Tragg arrives, takes the tape from Perry, and arrests Harriet on suspicion of murder - her fingerprints were all over the ice pick found in 2A.

In court, Tragg is testifying about the ice pick, which he says originally came from the Bain house. On cross-examination, he acknowledges that members of the Bain family might be expected to have their prints on their own ice pick. More reluctantly, he admits that since the police were able to take the pick to their lab without disturbing the fingerprints, someone wanting to frame Harriet might be able to transport it from the Bain house to 2A also without marring the prints. Dr. Hanover testifies that blood of J.J.'s relatively rare type, AB, was found on the ice pick. Based on post-mortem lividity, rigor mortis, and body temperature, he has narrowed the time of death to between 2 and 3 AM. He admits that changes in the ambient temperature would affect these findings, but he carefully checked the apartments temperature, and it was normal.

Armed with a doctor's statement that Ned is able to testify, Burger calls him as a hostile witness, and he's wheeled in on a stretcher. When asked if the embezzlement charge against him is true, he doesn't answer. Burger then asks if Harriet knew the charge to be true, and Ned is again silent. From the defense table, Harriet shouts ""Leave him alone! I knew it was true!"" Burger has a final question for Ned - When did he last see J.J.? - and this time Ned answers: 11:30 the night he died. On cross, Ned says that J.J. called him hoping to make a deal that cut West out. Harriet withdrew the money from the bank, knowing it was to pay off J.J.

The next prosecution witness, West, perjures himself by claiming that J.J. came to him with the blackmail tape, and West merely informed the Bane family about it. When Burger is finished, Perry seems absorbed in a book that Paul brought into court for him, and he needs to be prodded to begin cross-examination. He gets West to admit that he was paying J.J.'s rent for 2B and other expenses. Perry suddenly accuses him of putting J.J.'s body in the freezer in order to confuse the time of death. Type AB blood in the freezer would corroborate this, so the judge (Morris Ankrum) moves the trial to Apartment 2B. They do find blood stains in the freezer, and Dr. Hanover confirms that this ruins his time-of-death calculations. The judge orders further investigation of the blood stains and the arrest of West on suspicion of murder.

At the Bain house, headlines in a paper Addison is holding recap these events, as Perry and Sylvia arrive. Perry gets a call from Della and announces that Harriet was released and is on her way home. Sylvia and Addison agree that it would be tactful if he's not there when Harriet arrives, so he leaves. He goes to a bus depot and opens a locker that contains the case with initials N.B. He checks inside, and it's full of cash. Suddenly, he's surrounded by police and Perry, who tells Tragg, ""Here's your killer.""

Perry is hoping to finally leave for London and catch at least part of the conference, and asks Paul to take him to the airport. Paul knows that the key clue had to due with the book on criminal investigation that he brought Perry from the Bain house, but wonders what exactly it was. Perry says that he caught Addison looking at that book, and it cited a case of using a freezer to confuse time of death. Addison's motive was the $75,000 bribe, which was a sure thing compared to the risk of Harriet losing her money (statute of limitations didn't apply to the bank suing for return of Bain's ill-gotten gains) or just refusing to marry him over Addison's inability to resist Sylvia. It turns out the Sylvia didn't even really want him. She was just trying to get Harriet free of his influence. Della enters with Harriet, who is now ""all dolled up"". Della has arranged for her to leave on a vacation on the same flight to London Perry is taking. She figures that the new Harriet will need a reliable escort. Perry escorts them both out, leaving Paul holding the bag."

Janet Morris (Bethel Leslie) accuses him of stealing from her husband. He says he'd never do anything against Dr. Morris, but he is carrying a wad of bills - $92,000! He says he's delivering it to Morris. At the police station, Morris (Shepperd Strudwick) confirms Dave's story, but isn't very forthcoming about why he's been renting that apartment under the name ""M. Morris"". The Robbery Division lieutenant (Arthur Hanson) returns the cash to Morris, but says he'll inform the Treasury Department about the suspicious amount of cash. Morris accuses Janet of spying on him, but she denies it, and says she didn't know Dave was his friend.

In Perry's office, Janet admits that her marriage is an unhappy one, and that her husband has turned to his nurse, Gladys Strome (Maxine Cooper) for the affection lacking at home. Now that there may be trouble with the government over the $92,000, she wants Perry to defend her community property interest in the cash. Meanwhile, Dr. Morris decides the time has come to act and calls Dave, who is now back home in Loganville CA, where his wife (Jeanette Nolan) runs a diner. He agrees to come back to L.A., and after hanging up takes another drink from his flask.

At a tiny airport, Morris is preparing for a flight in his private plane when Janet arrives. She has a thermos of coffee for him and says she's now ready to give him a divorce. Morris says he thinks that's just some scheme that will cost him more money. Airport manager Phil Reese (Woodrow Chambliss) has been observing this exchange. Later, we see the doctor's plane flying erratically and crashing, then a newspaper with the headlines ""Prominent physician in plane crash. Cause of fatal accident unknown."" Lt. Tragg visits Reese, who tells him that a radio operator heard the pilot report being very tired, then mumbling unintelligibly. He gives Tragg the thermos that Janet put in the plane and was found in the wreckage. The lieutenant goes to Janet and tells her that even though all that was left in the plane was an almost completely destroyed corpse, the coroner was able to detect morphine sulfate in the stomach.He tells her that she better get a good lawyer because the D.A. wants to talk to her. She doesn't know Perry's number, but Tragg tells it to her. Later, he tells Perry that in addition to community property, Janet is the sole beneficiary of a $125,000 life insurance policy Morris took out. ""Guys have been murdered for less,"" he says.

Paul reports that Gladys is the sole support of her mother and younger brother, but has left on vacation. Morris left her $50,000 in his will. Also, the $92,000 in cash is missing. Perry goes to the diner in Loganville, where he finds Mrs. Kirby castigating a workman for dropping screws, which she assumes she'd end up being charged for. She tells Perry that as far as she knows, Dave has hit the bottle again and is on skid row in L.A. The last she saw of him was when he got the call from Morris. He vanished, along with $154 in sales tax money. She interrupts the interview to tell the cook to use halves of pickles instead of whole pickles as a garnish on sandwiches, to save money. Then she tells Perry that the two of them are wasting each other's time.

Later, Mrs. Kirby comes to L.A. and reports her husband as a missing person. She's brought to the D.A.'s office, where Burger and Tragg insinuate that the $92,000 might have been a motive for Dave to kill Morris. Mrs. Kirby angrily denies the possibility, saying that Dave has loved Morris since they were pilots together in World War 2. After she leaves, Burger says that the fact that Dave was also a pilot was news to him. He sends Tragg and a team to comb the plane crash site. When they arrive, they find Paul and his men, who have just found a good luck medallion inscribed with the name Dave Kirby. Perry had the same idea as Burger, but sooner. Tragg points out that this only served to save him a lot of work, as he makes Paul hand over the medallion.

Janet is on trial for murdering Dave while attempting to murder her husband. Phil Reese testifies about what he observed, and is amazingly specific about times, the number of people at the airport, even the license plate numbers of Janet's car and the car she parked next to. On Perry's cross-examination, he explains that he has a ""photographic memory"" and illustrates it with a detailed description of Burger's dress, down to a loose button on one sleeve of his jacket. However, he was elsewhere when the plane took off and didn't observe that.

During a weekend recess, Perry visits Gladys' whiny mother (Helen Brown) and oafish brother Arthur (Al Lettieri). For a $100 bribe, Arthur reveals that Gladys is living in Boca de Oro, Mexico under an alias. Perry flies there and finds her with Morris. He admits changing plans at the last minute, having Dave fly the plane to Salt Lake City in order to throw Janet off the scent while he and Gladys went south. They took the $92,000 in cash, on which Morris had already paid the tax. He got a divorce in Mexico and married Gladys. He has no intention of returning, but after some goading by Perry, he says that the next day they'll take the first plane out of Boca de Oro. After Perry leaves, Gladys doesn't understand until Morris points out that he didn't tell Perry what direction that plane would be taking.

Back in court, Perry is cross-examining Lt. Tragg and asks why the police, with all their facilities, couldn't find Morris. The lieutenant answers is ""We have"", as the doctor and nurse enter the courtroom, looking unhappy. When Burger calls Morris to the stand, Perry objects, arguing that California law doesn't recognize Morris' Mexican divorce, so he's legally married to Janet and therefore can't testify against her. The judge (Owen Cunningham) agrees, so Burger calls Gladys. She testifies that Janet once told her that only death would set Morris free from her. Perry asks her if Morris ever prescribed morphine for Dave, to deal with the aftermath of his alcoholic binges. She doesn't remember.

Burger's next witness is Mrs. Kirby, who identifies the medallion as one she bought as a gift for Dave. She knew nothing about Dave flying the plane in place of Morris until the D.A. informed her. On cross-examination, she testifies that Morris did in fact prescribe morphine sulfate for Dave. She admits that she has filed life insurance claims totaling $15,000. Perry has jeweler's records showing that the medallion (platinum, so it wouldn't be consumed by a fire) was only delivered to her the morning of the crash, so she must have taken it to him at the airport that day. He says she also brought him a bottle of whiskey loaded with morphine. She tries to deny having gone to the airport, but Perry points out that the license number Reese mentioned as parked next to Janet's is for her car. He asks if Reese is in the courtroom, but Mrs. Kirby shouts ""Don't bother!"" and confesses. Dave was no good to her alive, so she thought maybe he'd be worth something dead.

Later, Paul asks what tipped Perry off. He mentions that it was very out of character for the penny-pinching Mrs. Kirby to buy her husband an expensive present. She must have had an ulterior motive. Della enters with bread and cold cuts to make sandwiches, since she's been losing weight from always working late on cases. Perry and Paul dig in, and Della seems resigned to going hungry again."

He reminds her that her next monthly $1000 payment is due tomorrow, and offers to leave her alone and turn over the Gallagher files to her for a lump-sum payment of $10,000. They arrange to meet at Ferrold's, a French restaurant, the next evening, and Marian abandons her trip. As they leave, we see that they have been observed by another man. Marian goes home and confesses to her husband Arthur (Peter Adams) that she's being blackmailed over Gallagher. Meanwhile, the mystery man at the terminal turns out to be a P.I. hired by Charles Gallagher (Paul Picerni). He tells his client about Carlin, but he didn't overhear his conversation with Marion.

At Ferrold's, headwaiter Pierre (Jan Arvan) gets a call from Carlin, cancelling the reservation and requesting him to tell Marian to come to his home instead. Marian arrives, and as she is getting this message, she happens to hear Perry and Della arrive and claim their reservations. Perry and Della are seated, and Perry is shocked to discover that coffee costs $1. Pierre comes over with a phone with a call from a woman unknown to Perry, but we see is Marian, calling from inside the restaurant. She retains him to take the pay-off to Carlin, which she has a waiter deliver to him. Perry and Della go to the Carlin house, but Carlin claims complete ignorance of what they're talking about. After they leave, Arthur Fargo emerges from another room, and we learn that he and Carlin are partners in the blackmail scheme. However, Arthur has learned from Marian that she's been paying twice what he and Carlin had agreed. He demands his share of the extra money and leaves, saying he'll be back for it in a couple hours. Perry has remained across the street, and observes a woman walk up to Carlin's house and enter. Later, Paul arrives to help, but as Perry is filling him in, there's a big explosion and fire at the Carlin place.

Later, the fire department takes a corpse out of the house. It's burned beyond recognition but Paul describes the build of the body and Perry says ""That's Carlin."" Paul mentions that there was a bullet in his head. The next day, Paul talks to a waiter (Jean Del Val) at Ferrold's and learns that Pierre quit his job the previous night. He also gets a look at the reservation book, and learns enough to identify Perry's mystery client as Marian. Perry and Paul go to the Fargo home, where they first notice a dry spot on the drive, indicating that the car had only been driven away within the past hour, when it finally stopped raining. Next, they look in a window and see a man's body. Going inside, they see he was murdered, and find a note from Marian to Arthur saying she's taking the bus to Harristown. Perry works out that the bus left L.A. too early for Marian to have committed the murder - if she was on it.

Paul flies to Harristown, intending to confirm Marian's alibi. He arrives at the station just before the bus and has Marian paged. However, the police are there too, and they arrest her for the murder of her husband. Another arriving passenger, Diana Maynard (Dorothy Green), offers to help, once she has put a patch on her mildly infected eye that's bothering her. She agrees to dictate a statement that she and Marian rode together on the bus all the way from L.A. Perry is glad to have this, but is troubled that there are other witnesses who claimed she got on later, at Wayne City. Gallagher arrives at Perry's office, but Della tells him he's left. Gallagher, Marian's brother, was an escaped convict in his youth. Since then he became prosperous, but Carlin knew his background. He wants to help by turning himself in, but Della says coming clean would give the D.A. a motive for Marion, so he decides to keep out of sight.

In court, Perry easily demolishes the testimony of an airport parking attendant who claims to identify Marian as the woman he briefly saw while she was wearing dark glasses and a floppy hat. However, he's unable to shake the story of a charter pilot who testifies that he took Marian to Wayne City in time for her to catch the Harristown bus from there. Later, D.A. Burger receives an anonymous call, tipping him off to the significance and whereabouts of Diana Maynard. From the French-sounding accent, Burger guesses that it's Pierre, whom he like to have picked up. Lt. Tragg tells him that the police have been looking and Pierre is nowhere to be found, but he has no trouble following the tip and arresting Diana at the hotel where Perry has been hiding her. Burger interviews her, points out inconsistencies in her account, and advises her not to commit perjury.

At the next court session, Perry calls Diana to the stand, but only asks her about arriving in Harristown. He then objects to Burger's attempt to cross-examine her about when Marian got on the bus. The judge agrees that cross-examination must relate to matters brought up in direct examination. So Burger calls Diana as a prosecution witness and gets Diana to tell her new story, that Marian got on at Wayne City. Now it's Perry's turn to cross-examine, and since she testified about what she saw and is still using her eye patch, Perry challenges her ability to identify people. While being tested, she correctly identifies Lt. Tragg, the P.I. who baby-sat her for Perry, and the parking lot attendant. However, she wasn't in court when the attendant testified and had been kept away from news of the trial. The only way she could recognize him was because she was the one who drove Marian's car to the airport, where she took the charter plane to Wayne City and boarded the bus there. Caught in a lie, Diana admits her role, but points to another man in court as the murderer. That man tries to leave to court, but he's caught and his disguise is removed. It's the supposedly dead Samuel Carlin!

Later, we learn that Gallagher has been pardoned for his earlier crimes. The body identified as Carlin was actually Pierre, who was making money as Carlin's errand boy. The phone call to Burger was made by Carlin, adopting a fake French accent. Perry and Della then head back to Ferrold's to solve the remaining mystery: What could make a cup of coffee be worth a dollar?"

Young) when Dave's ex-wife Helen (Constance Ford) arrives with her brother Bob Kramer (Denver Pyle) to pick up the Reeds' young son Tommy (Kelly Junge Jr.). Dave tells Bob that he wants sole custody of Tommy, and he can prove Helen is an unfit mother. Bob replies that if Dave tries anything, he'll ""not live to appear in court.""

That night, a somewhat drunk, fur-clad woman saunters into the Burgundy Club. She's either Helen Reed or her twin, but is known there as Joyce Martel. Johnny Hale (Murray Hamilton), the club's owner, takes her into his private office. He's unhappy that he hasn't seen her for a week, but she's in a good mood, emphasizing that she needs to be herself. She gives Johnny a playful kiss, which he returns with passion.

Later, Bob arrives at Helen's apartment, having been informed that she's sick again. She describes a nightmare in which she was wearing daring clothes and a mink, even though she's very allergic to fur. She also remembers smoking and drinking, things she never does. Worst of all, she recalls going into an apartment and seeing Dave lying on the floor with a bullet hole in his head and a gun nearby. She asks her maid Sarah (Louise Truax) to get her pills from her purse, but the purse isn't hers - it's monogrammed ""J.M."" and contains a gun. Helen says the purse and gun are from her nightmare.

The next day, Helen and Bob repeat their story to Perry, with one additional detail - the gun belongs to Bob. They're worried that there might be truth in Helen's dream and if so, Bob could be charged with the murder. (Because of the death threat he made in front of Harry, of course. Where does Perry get these clients?) Perry goes to Reed Industries where he's made an appointment with Dave, whose private secretary Cora Dunbar (Carole Mathews) tells him the boss hasn't come in yet. He's going to wait, but he gets a call from Della that Paul needs to see him immediately at 622 South Barry, Westwood. (Barry is a real street in the Westwood area, but it doesn't have addresses in the 600s.)

Perry arrives to find this is the Crest Apartments, and Paul has discovered that a key in the ""J.M."" purse is to Apartment 310, which is registered to a Joyce Martel. Using the need to return the purse to its owner as an excuse, they enter the apartment with the key and discover Dave's body. They look around a bit, and find plenty of items with the ""J.M."" monogram. Paul also finds a photo of ""Joyce"", and when he later shows it to Perry, the attorney learns that Joyce and Helen are the same person. Lt. Tragg arrives and notes that no self-respecting private eye would carry that purse with a daytime suit, so he takes it.

When Perry arrives at Helen's actual apartment, he finds a cab driver (Frank Jenks) shouting through the door that he needs to return the mink stole he's carrying to her, or he'll be in trouble. She left it in his cab last night when he drove her from her place to the Burgundy Club and later to the Crest Apartments. The allergic Helen vehemently denies the fur is hers, but the cabby recognizes Sarah from when he first picked up Helen. He knows he couldn't have mistaken two people. To Perry, this means that there's a witness to Helen having been in the area of Dave's murder around the relevant time.

Back at the law office, Bob explains that Joyce Martel was originally Helen's imaginary playmate, some of whose imaginary actions started becoming real. There's a knock on the back door Paul always uses, but it's Tragg. He announces that Bob's gun was indeed the murder weapon, and Dave was shot between 9 and 11 PM. He say's that Bob received a note from Cora saying that Dave asked him to come to Apartment 310. Sure enough, Bob has the note in his coat, but says he never read it. Just as he received it, he got the phone call that Helen was sick, and forgot about the note. Tragg is unimpressed and arrests Bob.

Paul has informed Perry about Joyce's trips to the Burgundy Club, so he goes there and barges into Johnny's private office, where he finds the club owner in the company of Helen-as-Joyce, complete with mink stole and sassy attitude. Later, Dr. Maitland (Abraham Sofaer), a psychiatrist who recently started treating Helen, explains the concept of multiple personalities. Helen perceives Joyce's actions as nightmares, but Joyce is fully aware that she and Helen inhabit the same body. Joyce's lack of a fur allergy isn't their only big difference - the doctor believes Joyce might be fully capable of committing murder.

In court, Burger is presenting his case. Sarah testifies about seeing Bob's gun in the purse. Cora explains that she sent that note to Bob on Dave's instructions. He told her that he knew of Helen's indiscretions through detectives he'd hired, and intended to prove them to Bob. If they didn't relinquish custody of Tommy, Dave planned to pillory Helen in the press. On cross-examination, Perry asks about Cora's relationship with Harry. She admits that Harry bought her a ticket for a vacation in Mexico, but she was ""going to reimburse him later"". She denies leaking to Harry information that Dave wanted kept from him, but in the process starts to refer him as ""Harry"" before correcting herself to ""Mr. Vance"". Harry testifies about Bob's death threat to Dave. On cross, he relates that Dave had summoned him to Apartment 310 to be a witness to his encounter with Bob, but when he arrived around 10, Dave was already there. He delayed reporting the death, and even bought Cora the ticket to Mexico, so that a check Dave had signed to seal the Anderson deal would clear.

Johnny testifies that he'd known Helen for two years, but on cross clarifies that he knew her only as Joyce. This opens up the issue of Helen's multiple personalities, despite Burger's customary sputtering about Perry's courtroom theatrics. First, Dr. Maitland explains that Helen is a ""true schizophrenic"". With Helen on the stand, he demonstrates her strong allergic reaction to the mink stole. Then Dr. Maitland talks to her and educes the Joyce personality. She's delighted to have her fur again, and doesn't mind admitting that she took Bob's gun, wanting to make Bob think that Helen did it. Perry accuses Joyce of the murder, but Johnny protests that he won't let her take the blame for his crime. He had a jealous rage when he saw Dave with Joyce, not realizing that they meant nothing to each other.

Later, Perry announces that Dr. Maitland holds out strong hopes for Helen's complete cure. Della thinks it's a shame that this means she'll remain allergic to fur."

Contact Elston Carr, 123 North Renuda Drive, Los Angeles California. WARNING Impostors will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" In his camera shop in San Francisco, Mr. Lowell (Otto Waldis) and Doris Hocksley Jackson (Toni Gerry), who lives in the apartment building next door, read this personal ad from a local paper. Lowell says there can't be that many Hocksleys around, and they should try for it.

At the home of Elston Carr (Anthony Jochim), his nephew Alan Neil (Warren Stevens) checks his messages with secretary Rebecca Gentrie (Olive Deering). Several women have called, but Alan tells Rebecca that he loves only her. Doris is waiting for him in Carr's study to state her claim. She says her father was Adam Hocksley and produces her birth certificate, evidence of where she's lived, etc., but Alan is interested in things like photographs and letters. She says the only thing she has like that was a book she received from Peiping (the pre-1949 name for Beijing), along with a photograph with a note on the back. The note was gloomy, talking about a partner turning Judas, and Doris asks if her father died in Peiping. Alan says that Adam Hocksley died there. Then he asks who supplied her with the material she presented, accusing her of being a fraud. She wants to see Carr himself, but Alan says he'd just turn her over to the D.A. because she's missing two critical pieces of evidence. Even Alan doesn't know exactly what they are, and the answer to that is locked up in the nearby safe. Alan says he'll help Doris for half the fortune.

Doris goes to Perry, wanting him to represent her, but he's undecided. He makes an appointment to see Carr, and when he arrives the old man is wheelchair-bound and helped by Gow Loong (Benson Fong). Carr is dictatorial and cynical, pointing out that the $2.2 million is legally his own money to give away or not, as he pleases. He, Hocksley, and John Lowell were partners in gun-running and related activities in China, where they made a fortune, kept in U.S. banks. Lowell was the Judas, turning his partners over to the Communists. Hocksley was killed and Carr was wounded, lucky to escape with the help of Gow Loong, who hates Lowell and is still trying to track him down. Carr thinks Perry could do a better job of the search for Hocksley's daughter and offers him a $10,000 retainer, but Perry refuses since he may represent a Miss Hocksley. Carr asks if he means Miriam Hocksley (Mary Shipp), another claimant whom Adam apparently favors. Perry explains he means Doris Hocksley and gets the address where Miriam is staying in L.A. so he can visit her. Miriam tells Perry that she has no certain knowledge of being the rightful claimant, but if she is, she wants the money. She knows the vital evidence has something to do with books and photographs, so she's having some sent from her home in Palm Beach.

That night, Perry is at home when he gets a call from Della, asking if she can give Rebecca his home number, as she wants to call him directly. Perry permits it, and soon gets a frantic call. She came home, heard a shot from the study, looked in, and saw Carr's body sprawled on the floor with a gun nearby. She heard the noise of someone still in the study, so she locked the door, trapping the person inside. She asks what to do, so Perry tells her to call Lt. Tragg. When the police arrive, they go in guns drawn and find Carr as Rebecca described him, and Doris nearby, holding a book and wearing a blank expression. Carr's pocket watch has written on the inside ""17L-42R-13L-4R"". The dial of Carr's safe is set to 13, and turning it right to 4 unlocks it. To Tragg, this means someone was interrupted opening the safe, presumably by Carr, so the intruder shot him. The only thing inside the safe is an empty tin container. Tragg asks Doris about the bible and photograph of three men that she's holding, but she's in shock. Tragg orders her taken away, first for medical examination, then for booking. Rebecca explains that Alan and Gow Loong had left earlier in the evening, leaving her alone with Carr, who told her to go ahead and see a show to which she had a ticket. When she returned, events transpired as she'd told Perry. Tragg questions why she locked the door when Carr might still have been alive, but she said she was certain at first glance that he was dead. Perry demonstrates that the bible, which has rounded corners, fits perfectly in the empty tin. The photo has square, unbent corners, so was never kept in the tin.

The next day, Paul is back from San Francisco and reports that Doris is a widow and has a six-year-old daughter with polio. Care for the girl is costing her $100 per month although she only nets $48 per week. He heard about, but did not meet, the helpful neighbor. When Perry hears the man's name is Lowell, he recalls the John Lowell who was ""Judas"" to Hocksley and Carr. Perry visits Doris in her hospital room, which has iron bars on the window, and they review what she already told Tragg. Carr had called and invited her over. When she arrived, no one let her in, but the door was open. In the study, she found the dead Carr and the gun, which she picked up, accidentally firing it. Perry asks about Lowell, and Doris says she's known him about four months, ever since he opened the photo shop next door to where she lived. He provided the photo she brought, but has no idea how he could have a copy of the photo that came with the bible. Doris had kept the bible but tossed out the photo years ago.

At trial, Dr. Morton (Bert Holland) of the coroner's office testifies that Carr was shot twice from six to nine feet away. One bullet entered his heart and was instantly fatal, the other was lodged in the spine. Rebecca relates what she previously told Perry and Tragg. On cross-examination, she confirms that the house was unlocked when she returned, and that she only heard one shot. Tragg testifies that tests show the gun that fired the bullets is the one found at the scene, and it has Doris' fingerprints on it. He also identifies the bible, photo, and tin. On cross, he says that three bullets had been fired from the gun, including one that was found in the floor. He calls it a miss, but has to admit that Doris' explanation of accidental firing is a possibility.

Alan and Miriam address each other as ""darling"" as she prepares for testifying that afternoon. Alan warns her not to volunteer anything about what happened the night of Harry Foster's party. She agrees it might give people the wrong idea. On the stand, she testifies about her conversation with Perry, who apparently knew from Doris that the key to the vital evidence was in Carr's safe. (Perry objects to hearsay, but Burger successfully argues the exception to the hearsay rule involving the establishment of the defendant's knowledge facts.) On cross, she says that she did not have a bible with rounded corners or a photo like Doris' as part of her evidence supporting her claim. Perry reads a note that Paul brings him, then asks Miriam where she was on the night of the murder. (Burger objects, as this is utterly unrelated to direct examination, but Perry successfully uses the cross-examiner's catchall of attempting to show bias of the witness.) Miriam answers that she was at a party in Beverly Hills, hosted by people named Foster.

On Burger's direct examination, Alan recounts the innocent part of his encounter with Doris. On cross, he denies the part about offering to help Doris for half the money. However, he admits to also being at the Foster party, that he and Miriam were away from the party from about 11 to 1, and that he and Miriam used that time to wed, having obtained a marriage license a week earlier. Perry now declares that the key to everything is the empty tin, so he rips it open. Inside a hidden panel is another copy of the photo of three men, this one trimmed to fit. The bible that also fit and the photo that matched were the objects that were to identify Adam Hocksley's daughter, so it really is Doris.

Late that night, Perry is home when he gets a phone call: ""It's Miriam. I killed Alan because he was no good. He killed his uncle. Now Doris can go free. I'm going to kill myself."" There's the sound of a gunshot. Perry calls the police and rushes to Miriam's apartment. Medics are carrying her away and Tragg says she has a 40/60 chance of pulling through, but Alan is dead. Perry says that Miriam was completely honest through the whole case. She didn't care all that much about the money, but loved Alan and didn't kill him. This surprises Tragg, in view of her confession, but Perry says the detective is jumping to conclusions. He points to a bullet in the wall, which couldn't have been from a shot fired from where someone shooting at Alan would stand. Perry, Tragg, and Burger go to Carr's house and announce Alan's death to Rebecca and Gow Loong. Rebecca acts shocked, but Perry says she made two mistakes. One is that Miriam is alive, which Burger confirms. Now Rebecca is really frantic. She'd loved Alan, who said he loved her too, but was lying, so she killed him. As Tragg takes her away, Perry and Burger agree that they both need a drink.

Later, Perry says that Rebecca's big blunder was calling him at home. None of the other people connected with the case, including Miriam, had his home phone number, so Perry knew the call was a fake. The bullet hole in the wall was made by Rebecca to produce the required gunshot sound. Rebecca had also been the one caught opening the safe, out of her misplaced love for Alan, when she was found by Carr and shot him. She was in the process of arranging a cover-up when Doris blundered on the scene and made it easy. From all this, Paul draws the moral ""What some women will do for a man is just plain murder."" Della and Perry are quite unimpressed."

She's pleased with his helpfulness, but her husband Scott (Tom Palmer), observing from the bushes, is clearly not. He storms back into the house, loads both barrels of shotgun (avoiding getting his prints on the shells), and puts it in his golf bag. He drives to a remote location, fires it once, then returns it to his gun rack. Marion enters the room and shrugs off his remark about what she does with the help. He gets a call from his Ellen Waring (Barbara Lawrence), his partner in the real estate business. She was expected to come to the Shelby's that evening, but says she and her friend Arthur Williams (Jonathan Hole) can't make it. Shelby is disappointed, but says he'll call her tomorrow.

Perry and Della are working late again when a telegram arrives: ""Need help desperately. Expect to be arrested any moment. Contact me in care of Shelby, Pinewood Lake. Frank Lawton."" During World War II, Perry and Frank served in the same company (implying Perry was in the Army, contradicting other episodes that had him in the Navy). Frank was shot twice in the war, after which his wife was killed in an accident, and he's seemed to be jinxed ever since.

Meanwhile, Shelby, in his pajamas, takes wire cutters and a flashlight from his car and walks down to the dock, which has a phone. He calls Frank, who lives in a bungalow on the property, and says ""This is Shelby. I'm at the dock. Bring my shotgun. Hurry!"" He disconnects the phone's handset with the wire cutters, which he then throws in the lake. Frank hastily gets dressed, grabs a set of keys, and runs to the main house. As he unlocks the door, he hears ""No! Don't! No!"" followed by a gunshot. He grabs the shotgun and runs to the dock, where he finds the flashlight but no Shelby and no response to his repeated calls. Marion arrives, asks Frank ""Where's my husband?"", and breaks into sobs.

The next day, Detective Sgt. Dix (Claude Akins) questions Frank's account, and shows him that the phone from which he said Shelby called was disconnected. Perry and Della arrive to find that the police are searching for Shelby's body, presumably in the lake. Dix notes that the shotgun Frank had was fired very recently. Frank is surprised to see Perry and denies sending the telegram. Dix gives the suspect a few minutes with his attorney. When Perry asks if there was a romance between Shelby and Ellen, Frank admits he can't be sure. Ellen often visited, sometimes alone but often with Arthur, and occasionally Arthur came alone. He's an accountant who had done work for the partnership, and also is quite the camera bug. Frank says that Shelby's appearance of wealth was just a front, used to impress people so he could con them out of their money. Frank says he could have been in love with Marion with some encouragement, but she never gave him any. Dix returns, having found Frank's notebook, and quotes a passage in which Frank wonders why someone like Shelby is permitted to remain alive.

Later, Perry tells Paul that he suspects Shelby is alive. He was being hounded by creditors, so he could have engineered his disappearance to elude them. Paul says he couldn't have just rowed away, since no boats were missing from the dock. Perry thinks Shelby could have had a confederate, perhaps Ellen, waiting in a boat for him. They go to Ellen's apartment building and look in the garage for her unit. The passenger seat of her car is soaking wet, as are a blanket and men's shoes they also find there.They call Sgt. Dix, and when he arrives Paul mentions that as they waited outside he spotted a man through the window of Ellen's apartment. Ellen lets them in and lets them look into the bedroom, where a woman is sleeping. Ellen says it's her mother. The man Paul saw was Arthur, who lives in another unit in the building and had dropped by for coffee. Arthur comes to the door and needs to be told what's going on, as he hadn't heard about Shelby. Asked about the wet things in her garage, Ellen explains that she and Arthur went on a lakeside picnic the previous day, to celebrate their upcoming wedding. Arthur tried to do some fishing, but slipped and fell in the lake. Sgt. Dix calls his headquarters, and learns that Shelby's body has been found in the lake, his head blasted with a shotgun.

In court, D.A. Howard Black (Peter Hansen) has Dix identify Frank's notebook and the shotgun. On cross-examination, Perry makes him admit that he couldn't swear that this shotgun was the murder weapon. Marion testifies that, half asleep, she heard loud voices, then a gunshot. Now fully awake, she went to the dock and found Frank calling out for Shelby, holding the shotgun. On cross, she says her marriage lacked affection, because of her husbands flagrant affair with Ellen. On her turn on the stand, Ellen, now Mrs. Williams, denies this accusation. She describes the picnic and mentions that Arthur took photographs, which he hands over to Black and Perry. The D.A. intends to call Arthur so he can introduce the photos into evidence, but first there's a recess. Paul and Perry use the time to visit the site of Ellen and Arthur's picnic.

When the trial resumes, Arthur identifies the photos and produces a receipt from the camera shop where he took the film to be developed. It's dated 10 AM the day after the murder, and Arthur explains that the shop was closed by the time they returned from the picnic and opened at 10 the next day. On cross, Perry questions him about what he found in the course of his accounting duties, and he admits that there was a ""slight"" discrepancy of about $120,000 in Shelby's books. Perry introduces a bank statement that shows Shelby withdrew $121,700 the day before his murder. He also shows Arthur a receipt that he and Paul got from the same camera shop, and there's no time shown on it. Arthur admits that he specifically asked for the time to be included. He says that he took the picnic photos between 2 and 5:30 the afternoon before the murder, but Perry shows that the shadows point west, implying the photos were taken in the morning. With his fake alibi exposed, Arthur admits that Shelby had hired him to help him vanish. However, Marion paid him more to double-cross him, but he just stood by while she shot him. She screams a denial, but Arthur says that to protect himself, he brought along his camera, loaded with infrared film. Ellen hands over a photo of Marion kneeling over Shelby's corpse on the dock. Marion collapses.

Later, Perry is with Frank, as he packs to move out of the bungalow and ponders his own ability to misjudge women. Perry says that Marion never particularly wanted to frame Frank. That was Shelby's plan, and Marion merely took advantage of the opportunity it created. Sgt. Dix enters and says that the missing money and murder gun were found under a plank in the dock. Frank also gets his notebook back, but he tears out the pages and says that in the future he'll leave all the writing to guys like Hemingway. He won't even write telegrams, and if he ever needs Perry's help again, he'll send smoke signals."

Gary's the foreman at Bannister Farms, and needs to leave soon to give the bosses wife, Lisa Bannister (Osa Massen), a ride. He's approached by Stefan Riker (Werner Klemperer, famous as ), who shows him the photograph of a woman. Gary claims he doesn't recognize her, but later, in the car, we see that it's Lisa. He tells her how he has protected her and claims his rewarded by forcibly kissing her, which earns him a slap.

At home, Edward Bannister (Robert F. Simon), who needs to use two canes to walk, complains about his wife having another of her headaches, but his daughter (and Lisa's stepdaughter) Doris (Gigi Perreau) is quick to defend her. Riker appears at the door and says he's Lisa's cousin. He tells Edward he recently arrived from East Germany. When Lisa enters, Riker acts like a happily reunited relative, but Lisa is clearly stunned and distressed. Edward says this is because she'd told him she had no living relatives. Later, Doris stops Lisa from taking an overdose of pills. The stepmother reveals that Riker is a friend of her father, who isn't dead but is in fact Hans Gebhardt, the real head of the Communist Party in East Germany. (For the purposes of this story, we need to assume that the notorious was a figurehead.) Riker may know that Lisa entered the U.S. on a forged passport. Doris promises to find a way to deal with the problem. Doris goes to Riker's apartment and throws herself at him. Three months after his arrival, Riker has clearly prospered, with a nice new car and spiffy clothes. Edward tells him he better leave town, but the German doesn't care.

Della returns to the law office to find a disheveled Doris, who says she can't remember her name. She found a torn piece of paper with Perry's name and office address on it, and thought that he might know who she was. Perry arrives and doesn't recognize her. She manages to say that she might have been on Sunset Canyon Road when she awoke from whatever happened to her, then she collapses. Perry takes her to the hospital. The following afternoon, the late-rising Edward sees the morning paper, with a photo of Doris and the headline ""Amnesia Victim Found by Prominent Attorney"". He calls Perry and asks for his help in getting her home. When Perry asks about Sunset Canyon Road, Edward says he thinks Riker, whom Doris had been seeing, lives around there. Della looks up Riker in the phone book, as Perry wonders why Riker hadn't called to identify Doris.

That question is immediately answered for the viewer, as we see Riker's dead body sprawled on the floor of his apartment. Lt. Tragg and his men are there, and find a stack of letters from Doris, full of declarations of love and jealousy. Outside they find a gun and a stepladder hear the rear window of Riker's apartment. Directly under the window are two indentations in the ground, as if the ladder had been placed there so someone could look in the window, then moved to the side. Perry and Della, observing the homicide detectives going back and forth, don't go to the apartment. Instead, Perry goes to the hospital, where Dr. Forbes (Wendell Holmes) gives a diagnosis of ""general amnesia"". Perry starts to make arrangements to move Doris to a private sanitarium, when Tragg arrives and posts a police guard.

Paul has little to report. The police obviously think that Riker was two-timing Doris, so she killed him out of jealousy. Perry goes to Hennessy's and talks to Gary, who's sympathetic but unhelpful. After he leaves, Helene mentions that Gary, who denied knowing Riker, had actually met him frequently at the lounge. Paul summons Perry to a gully off Sunset Canyon Road, where he's found Doris' wrecked car. It's in neutral gear, so could have been pushed. In the car is the paper from which the scrap with Perry's address was torn, so she presumably wrote it herself. Perry and Paul don't need to worry about what to do with all these indications that Doris faked her accident, as Tragg immediately arrives, having spotted Perry's car parked along the road above.

In court, Dr. Forbes testifies that he now believes Doris was faking amnesia, because her physical condition and behavioral symptoms don't match general amnesia. On cross-examination, Perry gets him to admit she could have had partial amnesia, and it was the doctor, not the patient, who claimed it was general amnesia. Tragg takes the stand and identifies the ladder, which has Doris' fingerprints, and a plaster cast of the ground beneath Riker's window. Burger demonstrates that the spacing between the indentations in the cast matches that of the rear legs of the ladder, although the shape of the indentations is just a good fit, not an exact one. The lieutenant explains that when there was weight on the ladder, the legs would have wiggled around, thus changing the shape of the imprints. Burger next calls Lisa as a hostile witness and forces her to identify Doris' handwriting on a note from Riker's apartment. It says, ""I saw you with her again. It's times like this I get so mad I could kill you."" On cross, she testifies that she hated Riker, but Perry accuses her of being the ""her"" in the note and of lying.

During a recess, Perry tells Doris that, despite his attempts, no one in court is going to believe her amnesia story. She finally drops that lie, telling him that she did use the ladder to spy on Riker, saw him with that woman again (no one she knew), waited for her to leave, then went in and shot him. Perry accuses her of trying to protect Lisa. She admits that she found Riker dead, and in his hand was a medallion she often wore suspended from a gold string necklace, a gift from Edward. Doris took it from the dead hand and threw it away, assuming that Lisa was the killer. They both hated Riker, Doris' protestations of love and jealousy just being an act, attempting to frighten Riker away from Lisa. She won't tell Perry what Riker had on Lisa, and if Perry tries to use the admissions she just made to him in court, she'll deny everything.

Perry calls Edward and asks him to bring Lisa's medallion or a copy to Paul in a lot near the court the next day. However, on that day he arrives and tells Paul that he couldn't get a copy that fast. When the trial resumes, Burger has Edward on the stand and uses registration data to show that the murder gun was his. It was kept in Gary's desk in the tack room, and Edward admits that Doris knew this. On cross, Perry has Edward describe the medallion, then claims that it had been in the hand of his corpse. This starts a row among Perry, Burger, and Doris, which requires some sternness from the judge (Pierre Watkin) to put down. Perry then asks Edward if he had any idea where the medallion went after it left his home. Burger objects to this as calling for hearsay, but Perry counters that it's best evidence, since Edward himself put the medallion in Riker's dead hand. Wrongly thinking the German was having an affair with Lisa, Edward murdered him and tried to frame her. Edward tries to deny it, but Perry shows that the ground impressions from below Riker's window perfectly match his two canes, down to the irregularity caused by a tack in one of the canes.

Later, Perry explains to Della what started him to suspect Edward. If Riker had actually ripped Lisa's medallion off her, it would be impossible for her to fail to notice that, and therefore wouldn't have left it. The most logical other person to have access to the medallion, when Lisa wasn't wearing it, was Edward. Della, curious about what hold Riker had on Lisa, starts to speculate about when Lisa entered the country. Perry stops her, saying that since Doris was willing to go to the gas chamber to protect Lisa's secret, they shouldn't pry. Della agrees, saying that every woman is entitled to at least one secret. ""What's yours?"" he asks, getting the reply ""You'll never know."""

Wynant), president of Cal-Texas Explorations returns to his office to find his secretary out but Rose Calvert (Pamela Duncan),an employee who doesn't belong there, snooping around his desk. He immediately suspects that she's working for former Cal-Texas executive Warner Griffith (Johnny Mack Brown). She denies this, but we soon see her calling Warner, informing him that she has possession of confidential reports. Working late, Dan can't find documents relating to a Texas project, and is certain Rose took them. Amelia Armitage (Jacqueline Scott) barges in, introduces herself, and says she knows all about Warner's plan to take the company away from him through a proxy fight. She believes he would bleed the company, thus hurting the stockholders. After she leaves, Dan gets a call from an unidentified woman. She has a list of the proxies Warner has obtained, but because Dan is being followed and his phone may be tapped, insists on an elaborate plan. Dan is to go to a phone booth at a nearby drug store. The phone will ring at 8:15 and he'll get further directions.

Dan proceeds as instructed, and the phone does indeed ring at about 8:13. He's told to go to Room 709 of the Hotel Redfern. This being 1958, the hotel actually has a human elevator operator, Mavis Jordan (Natalie Norwick). She's absorbed in a book, so doesn't look up when Dan asks for the 7th floor. There's no answer at Room 709, but the door is open so he goes inside, finding Rose lying dead on the floor. He takes the gun lying near her body and wipes his prints off surfaces he touched. He takes the stairs to the 6th floor and summons the elevator from there. Mavis, still not looking up, comments that he walked down from 7. As he exits the elevator, he brushes past Lt. Tragg, who's headed in the opposite direction.

Later, Dan and Cal-Texas attorney Varnell (Donald Foster) explain the situation to Perry. They show him the gun, which Perry says he'll have Paul send to the police, as it's evidence. Dan says he thinks he now knows who called him - Linda Griffith (Marie Windsor), Warner's wife. Perry tells Dan that he should stay out of circulation, but not by fleeing town or hiding under an assumed name. He should drive his own car to a nondescript motel and register under his own name. Perry visits Linda and asks why she lured Dan into a trap. She admits making the first phone call, but when she called at 8:15 to have Dan meet her, he didn't answer. When Perry describes the second call Dan did get, she realizes that she was right - Dan's phone was tapped, and whoever tapped it set up the fake second call. She was quite sincere about helping Dan with the proxy fight, as she's planning on divorcing Warner. She's convinced he's having an affair with Rose, who's helping him obtain proxies. Hearing there's been a murder, she's too nervous to hand Dan the proxy information now, but she does give Perry a photo of Rose that she discovered her husband had taken. She mentions that Rose is married but separated. She also knows that Rose had been using Room 709 at the Redfern for the work she was doing for Warner, but actually lived at the Serrano Arms.

Perry finds a letter stuck partway into Rose's mailbox at the Serrano, and sees on it the return address of Fred Calvert (Jack Weston) in Ellendale, about an hour's drive from L.A. Perry goes there, and Fred says that Rose left her about 7 months ago. She wanted more fun than she could have with Fred, but he thinks she'll eventually return to him and the security provided by their house, which is completely free of mortgage. Perry shows him the photo, which Fred identifies as Rose, and tells him that she may have been murdered. When Perry gets back to the office, Warner is there. Perry voices suspicions that after Rose delivered her material against Dan, and Linda started accusing him of an affair with her, Rose turned from asset to liability, giving him a motive for murder. Unfortunately, the murder took place between 7:30 and 8:30 PM, and Warner didn't get back from a day in Phoenix until around 1 AM.

Perry enters Burger's office, in response to an ""invitation"" delivered by Tragg. The D.A. says that the gun he sent was indeed the murder weapon, and then goes into one of his typical tirades about Perry's shady behavior. However, this time Burger and Tragg have duplicated his reasoning about avoiding flight or hiding. Tragg opens a side door, and beckons Dan into the room. As Dan's trial nears, Amelia comes to Perry with a story of having eavesdropped on the phone call Dan received after she had supposedly left, and then having followed him to the drug store, where she heard the pay phone ring. This would prove that Dan was telling the truth about those calls, but Perry immediately realizes she made the whole thing up out of information that had been made public. He tells her that help like that could get his client the gas chamber.

In court, Fred testifies to coming to the morgue the day after the murder and identifying Rose's remains. Tragg testifies that he went to Room 709 based on an anonymous tip. He found a set of Dan's prints on a chair. Mavis testifies that she saw Dan in her elevator, despite being absorbed in the book ""You'll Die Laughing"". She remembers him in particular, because he went to 7 and came back from 6. On cross, Perry questions how she could recognize anyone if she was looking down at her book. She reveals that she's an expert at identifying people by looking at their feet. She mentions tests at Stanford at which her ability was declared ""phenomenal - a quirk of nature"" and is ready to cite other academic references when she's excused.

Warner describes his spying with Rose's help as an investigation of Dan - attempting to show that he was releasing valuable information to competitors. He claims that Dan learned that she kept her documentation in Room 709 and says ""She could have ruined him. That's why he killer her!"" On cross, Perry forces him to admit that the ""release of information to competitors"" really just consisted of partnering with a group of smaller companies to make land purchases for Cal-Texas, to avoid the spurt in prices that would have resulted from one big offer. This was a perfectly natural business practice, which Warner as a candidate to take over the company ought to know. In fact, Rose's ""evidence"" was merely a cheap trick, and not a motive for her murder. Warner admits he knew that Rose had taken a company-owned gun from the Cal-Texas offices. However, he denies having chartered a private plane to take him to L.A. and back to Phoenix in order to commit the crime while apparently out of state. He says that he really did return around 1 AM and went to her residence at the Serrano Arms, but no one was there. He denies having taken the letter from Fred that Perry had seen but is now missing.

Back on the stand, Perry questions Fred about the time gap between when he learned his wife might have been murdered around midnight and his visit to LAPD the following morning. Fred finally admits that he had driven to the Serrano Arms to retrieve the letter then back to Ellendale, so he could tell the local sheriff about his wife's possible murder and have him accompany Fred on his trip to the L.A. police. He wanted the letter back because in it he'd given Rose the deed to his house in an attempt to win her back. If she was dead, he didn't want her relatives getting the house. He insists he had no motive to kill her, as he just wanted her back. Perry badgers him with accusations that he went to Room 709, pleaded with her, and when she kept rejecting him, killed her in the heat of the moment or accidentally. Fred keeps saying ""No"" to all this, so Perry has him stand up so Mavis can identify his feet. Before she can say anything, Fred admits that everything happened exactly as Perry had said.

Perry and Della are out celebrating with Dan, and they reveal to him that Mavis couldn't have actually identified Fred, because he was wearing different shoes in court than on the murder night. Amelia drops by, and Dan belatedly recognizes her name as belonging to the family that controls 37% of Cal-Texas stock. Given her obvious sympathy for Dan, the proxy fight is a dead issue. Perry and Della leave Dan and Amelia. Looking back at them, Della remarks that Dan is a good age match for Amelia. Perry asks what she has in mind. She answers that with them both caring so much about Cal-Texas, it would be a good time for a merger."

Fred tells her she can pick up the money at 5 PM tomorrow, at the apartment, and says there's now nothing between them. ""Nothing but money,"" says Kim. Later that night, Inez Kaylor (Karen Sharpe), finds her drunk roommate and fellow hostess Kim contemplating future prosperity. Inez calls being a hostess ""The best way I know to get a massage to music,"" but she does enjoy the occasional overseas modeling assignments that come with the job. Kim says that's part of the operation, and that when Inez figures out what she's talking about, she'll have security. The next day, Danceland boss Martha Rayburn (June Vincent) asks Inez why she's trying to see Fred, who's just the club's landlord. Inez replies that Kim is missing, and Fred might know about it, as they had been dating. Martha responds that Fred is a happily married man. Inez repeats some of Kim's disconnected comments from the night before, and Martha tells her to forget about it and get back to work. Just as she exits Martha's office, Fred enters it. Inez lingers near the closed door long enough to hear him tell Martha that while he was stopped at a red light, someone came up and robbed him at gunpoint.

The following morning, the police come to Albert's trailer, roust him out of bed, and arrest for robbing Archer. Perry comes to him in jail and says he'll defend him pro bono, as he's aware of Albert's problems. Eight years earlier, Albert was driving 36 hours straight to be on time for a new job. He fell asleep at the wheel, and his wife and two children were killed in the resulting accident. When Perry meets Fred and Martha, he asks why they didn't report the robbery, which was in fact reported by a chance witness. Martha lies, claiming that she wasn't feeling well at Danceland and Fred agreed to drive her home. When the robbery occurred, she wasn't up to dealing with the police, so convinced Fred to forget about it and take her home.

Perry and Paul don't have much success getting more information from Danceland employees. However, Paul mentions that Larry the bouncer heard from Inez that she'd been fired by Martha, in the club, at a time after the robbery. Inez has moved to Las Vegas, so Paul dispatches his man Ralph Faulkner (Gil Frye) to find her. Later, in a hallway of the court building, Ralph brings Inez to Paul and leaves. She's quite willing to help catch Martha in a lie. Paul goes into the courtroom to tell Perry, and the second he's out of sight a tough customer who later turns out to be Joe Gibbs (Ned Wever) approaches Inez. In court, Martha has just testified for A.D.A. Walsh (John Alvin) that she recognizes Albert as the robber. On cross-examination Perry sets up the confrontation with Inez, but when Paul goes back to retrieve her, she's vanished. Perry gets a recess until the following Monday.

Lt. Tragg drops by Perry's office and announces that Kim's body has been found, and a search under Albert's trailer uncovered her purse and jewelry. Now that it's a murder case, Burger will be prosecuting personally. Paul finds Inez, but now she's completely unwilling to cooperate, so Paul serves her with a subpoena. She fakes taking an overdose of sleeping pills to distract him, then goes through a window, down a fire escape, and drives off. Perry wants to look around Inez's apartment, and to make this legal he buys up a contract under which Kim had made a time purchase of a mink, which Inez now has. She took it out of state, which triggers the right of the seller (or his assignee, Perry) to enter her premises to repossess the merchandise.

Perry and Della go to the Vegas apartment, but Inez isn't there. They are let in by Mr. Wickett (George Cisar), who, after being sufficiently tipped, leaves them alone. They find a postcard from the Universal Modeling Agency, telling Kim to report for a new job on the 20th of the month. As Della is checking out the bathroom, Joe enters with his key, draws a gun, and takes the postcard. Della gets a look at him, but is herself unseen. Back in L.A., Della applies for a job at UMA and is told by Marge (Robin Raymond), the company secretary, to wait for the boss. Christine (Jacqueline Holt), a model, enters and reports her return from abroad. After Christine leaves and Marge briefly steps out, Della gets a quick chance to snoop through UMA's contact information. She manages to look innocent when the door to the boss's office opens and out steps Joe. He's favorably impressed by her potential as a model, until she says she's married. Pointing out that the UMA ad said ""unattached models only,"" Joe shows her the door.

In court, Della tells Perry that the UMA records she saw listed the Danceland Ballroom as the phone number for most of the models. She also identifies Joe as the man who pulled a gun on Perry in Las Vegas. She notices that Martha's purse is just like one that Christine had when she was at UMA. Perry says that he's seen one like it too. He resumes his cross-examination of Martha, and she testifies that she doesn't believe in handing out gifts or bonuses to her hostesses. Asked about her purse, she says that it was design for her and has to be specially ordered. Perry points out that the purse that the police found matched it exactly, so Martha has to contradict herself and say that she gave such a purse to Kim. In Perry's office, Paul brings in Kim's purse, but he'll need to get it back to his police contact in an hour. Perry finds a secret compartment behind a mirror built into the purse. It contains traces of white powder, which Perry tastes. He notices the manufacturer's tag, and tells Della to go shopping.

In court, Perry shows Martha a bag and asks ""What if I told you it belonged to Kim Lane?"" Burger is furious, but the judge (Fay Roope) lets Perry continue. He makes Martha open the compartment behind the mirror and observe traces of white powder. Perry says it has the taste of heroin, and recommends that the D.A. investigate her and Fred for drug smuggling.Perry tells Martha that he can subpoena UMA records and the purses of all the models. He warns her that by sticking to her story regarding the robbery, she can increase her risk from years in prison as a drug smuggler to the gas chamber as an accomplice to murder. She admits that she was lying to help Fred, because the witness who reported the crime had seen a woman in the car. He failed to notice that the woman was dead - it was Kim, but Fred didn't kill her. He paid blackmail to her at the apartment used for their trysts, then told her to clear out. As she was packing, he went out for cigarettes, and returned to find her dead. He decided to drive off with her body and dump it.

Joe's testimony about the smuggling operations is rather matter-of-fact. The secret compartments of the purses were loaded and unloaded while the models were being photographed, so they were unaware of the smuggling. Perry says that a model who did figure it out would be in a great position to demand blackmail. Joe insists that none ever did, not even Kim. After all, she got her $5,000 from Fred to keep her from revealing their amour to his family. Perry has the court stenographer (Charles Zacha Jr.) read back the relevant part of Martha's testimony, and there was no mention of an exact amount of money. The only reason Joe knew it was because he killed Kim for it. The judge dismisses the case, and Perry shows Burger that he hadn't stolen state's evidence (and he doesn't mention ""borrowing"" it) - he was bluffing Martha with a copy bag that Della had obtained, containing not heroin but flour.

In Perry's office, Della wonders who was the actual robber, and Perry says he'll turn up sooner or later. The fact that the robber threw Fred's wallet in the same general area as Joe threw Kim's purse and jewelry was just a coincidence. Paul enters, announcing that a job at a record shop is all arranged for Albert. It should be good for him, as he likes listening to music. The police have found Inez and she's OK. She wants to go to business school, so Paul is taking her out so he can recommend a good one. He claims he used to be a teacher at one of the best. Perry says he was the track coach - any gal he couldn't catch in three laps around the desk is ready for the business world. (This is a reference to an old cliché, mainly seen in cartoons drawn before the 1970s, about a lecherous boss chasing his secretary around and around his desk.)"

They find the door to the office bolted, but are finally let in by an intruder, gossip columnist Mary K. Davis (Marian Seldes). They realize she has stolen a book of patient records from the office, but before they can do anything about it, Mary pulls a gun on them. She says the only way they'll get the book back is if they give Mary a baby. She's told everyone, including her husband, that she's pregnant. Mary gives Barnes and Walsh until 10 AM to accept her terms.

Back in her own office, Mary prepares the story, based on the patient records, that she'll publish if she doesn't get her baby. Mary's assistant Connie Cooper (Ruta Lee) is shocked, but Mary puts her in her place by threatening to make public the terrible secret of who is the real mother of Connie's fiancé, Bob Shroeder (Don Garner). Mary reveals that she's adamant about her plan because her supposed pregnancy is her only way of prying her husband Ralph (Philip Ober) away from his girlfriend. Dr. Barnes calls, and Mary gives him another 24 hours.

Later, Laura Walsh visits Perry's office and asks him to recover the record book. She admits that she and Dr. Barnes have been arranging off-the-books adoptions of the children of single mothers, not for money but to provide good homes for the children. Perry explains that he can't simply steal the book back from Mary, so Laura leaves in frustration. Perry tries to call Mary Davis, but Lt. Tragg answers. Mary has been murdered. Later on, Tragg and D.A. Burger are discussing the case in the latter's office when Laura enters and confesses to the killing.

Perry is frustrated with his client's actions, but nevertheless pursues every avenue of investigation that he can. This includes talking to Connie and Bob, but they aren't much help. Connie blames herself for much of what has happened, as she had naively confided what she knew about Barnes' operation to Mary. The ever-trusty Paul Drake is more helpful. He has pored through trash to recover an envelope that Mary had addressed to herself under her maiden name at another address. It seems she ruined the envelope and had to do a new one, discarding the one Paul found. Perry learns that the address is of an apartment that Mary had recently rented, obviously as a place she could mail the record book for safekeeping.

Perry guesses that the book hasn't been delivered yet, so he sends Della to rent the apartment (as Mary has failed to pay the latest weekly rent). When the mail carrier arrives, Della follows Perry's instructions to avoid identifying herself as Mary, then tries to hide the package within the apartment. (Perry doesn't want it found, but doesn't want to involve Della in interfering with the mails either.) However, a noise a bit like pottery being broken interrupts her, and she hides behind a door from an intruder. We only see the shadow of an arm holding a gun, which is then withdrawn. Della runs out the door, taking the package with her in her panic. Back at Perry's office, she's afraid her actions will get her sent to jail.

Mary's lawyer, Arthur Jarech (Berry Kroeger), has duplicated some of Perry's reasoning and comes to offer Perry the opportunity to share the blackmail possibilities created by the record book. Perry rejects the offer with scorn, and Jarech says he'll go to the D.A. Perry takes the record book to Dr. Barnes, and pointedly leaves him alone with it while he gets a drink of water. Barnes takes the hint, and burns the book.

In court, it's clear that Jarech went through with his threat, as Burger puts Della on the stand and begins to question her about the intercepted package. However, Perry stops every one of Burger's questions with a laundry list of objections, including the old standbys, ""assuming facts not in evidence"" and ""incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial"". The judge (Morris Ankrum), commenting that these ""mere technicalities"" exist to protect the constitutional rights of the accused, sustains every one of the objections. Burger will be forced to produce the proper chain of evidence through a laborious process, so he asks for an adjournment.

Back at the office, Della is still fretting about what happened at Mary's apartment. She mentions the something-breaking sound that alerted her to an intruder, and Perry has a brainstorm. He and Paul go back to the apartment building, where the manager shows him the junk he had removed from Mary's room when she missed a rental payment. It includes a number of broken dictaphone cylinders and a dictaphone machine. The broken cylinders aren't of much use, so Perry hires an actress (who seems a little too attractive for Della's taste) to record a new cylinder, copying Mary's voice. She has barely left when Tragg comes in and seizes the dictaphone, broken cylinders, and new fake one, as stolen evidence. It turns out that there was an anonymous tip that Perry had a recording that would solve the case.

In court, Burger presents these items as evidence, despite Perry's assurance that they are incompetent, etc. As he starts to play the one intact cylinder, Connie jumps up and screams that they have to stop it. She admits she killed Mary, but they must not play that cylinder. She tells Bob that she didn't want his mother's secret revealed, and ended up killing Mary in a struggle. Bob says they could have lived with it. Ralph Davis and Perry also express their sorrow over Connie's unfortunate actions.

In the wrap-up, we learn that Bob's mother was a murderess who gave birth while on the run from the law. Tragg enters and mentions that Burger is planning on charging her with 2nd degree murder, since there was a struggle. He also says that Burger realizes the source of the ""anonymous tip"" and would like to charge Perry with something. However, Tragg pointed out to the D.A. that Perry had correctly told him the cylinder wasn't proper evidence. The lieutenant reveals the formerly intact cylinder now in pieces to show how mad Burger got. However, says, Tragg, the D.A. shouldn't get mad: ""He missed me by nearly two feet!"""

He fears his wife Louise (Susan Dorn) has found Charlotte's letters to him, and she might even be listening in on another phone. He's right, and Louise confronts him about the affair, trying to slap him. They struggle, and she tumbles down the stairs. A month after getting out of the hospital, she's crippled and won't leave her bedroom. George pleads with Louise's cousin and companion Vicky Braxton (Mary LaRoche) to ask Louise to see him. As Louise leaves, he's stunned to see the new maid - it's Charlotte, working under the name Martha Baxter. He thinks it's too risky for her to be there, but soon they're kissing.

Vicky passes on George's request, but Louise is adamant that she'll see no one but Vicky and Nora Mae Quincey (Lenore Shanewise), the practical nurse. Louise thinks George tried to kill her, and she also suspects him of taking some of her jewelry to give to his girlfriend. Due to her religious beliefs, she can't divorce George, but she can cut him out of her will, leaving everything to the Wayne Medical Foundation. She reassures Vicky that she won't change the $350 monthly stipend left to her in the existing will.

George peeks into Nora Mae's room and sees her playing a bizarre amalgam of chess and checkers, her ""opponent"" being an empty chair. She also responds to the imaginary companion's admiration for the jewelry she's wearing. Having seen enough, George closes the door and knocks. Before answering the door, Nora Mae puts away her chess set and hides the rings and bracelet with it. George tells her he talked to a doctor who gave him some new pills to help Louise. She tells him the only thing she ever gives Louise is a tonic Dr. Williams (Charles Lane) in some milk and honey. George gives her the pills anyway.

When Perry arrives at his office, Nora Mae is waiting for him. She reported her suspicions that George's pills are poisoned to the police, but they were too busy to help. Perry takes one pill to have analyzed and Nora Mae negotiates a $5 consulting fee. Once she leaves, Della remarks that the jewelry Nora Mae was wearing made her fingers look practically on fire. Perry agrees that they looked expensive, and says there's more to Nora Mae than meets the eye. When Nora gets home, George confronts her about the jewelry and insists that she give Louise those pills. Later, George is again spying on her as she puts the pills into the milk and takes it into Louise's room.

Vicky is in bed when she gets called over the intercom by a distressed Louise. She calls in Dr. Williams, who begins to treat her but soon declares that it's too late. Soon, Homicide is combing over the place, and with George's help have found Nora Mae's chess set, with hidden jewelry. Lt. Tragg confronts her about it, and she says that she couldn't resist borrowing (albeit without asking) what she was sure was just inexpensive costume jewelry. Tragg estimates its value at around $25,000 (a figure Burger would raise to $40,000).

In Perry's office, Paul reports that the pill Perry gave him was just a sedative. Louise was killed by arsenic in the milk. George's first wife, Grace Gordon, died of a heart attack induced by food poisoning. She left George $53,000, which he lost in a business venture. Since his second marriage, he's living on handouts from Louise. In jail, Nora Mae explains that she put the pills in the milk, took it into Louise's room, waited for George to leave, went to the kitchen, poured that milk down the sink and replaced with with a new milk/honey/tonic concoction. She tells Perry to try not to worry.

In court, Dr. Williams testifies about testing the milk for arsenic. He also mentions that while Grace's tumble down stairs left her crippled, it did not reduce her life expectancy. In cross-examination, he notes that the honey in the milk would have masked the sweet taste of arsenic. Tragg discusses the thorough search he made of the home. He identifies a bottle of poison found in the kitchen and says that Nora Mae's fingerprints were on it. Under cross-examination, he admits that the poison was next to various household cleaners that Nora Mae would have naturally handled when performing her duty of keeping Louise's room clean.

George testifies that he wanted Louise to take a sedative so he could search her room for the letters. After he saw Nora Mae take the drugged milk into Louise's room, he checked several times, but she was always awake. He also says that Nora Mae was eager to put the pills in the milk. On cross, he claims not to know a Charlotte and that the letters were from a Mary Smith who moved to Texas a couple of months ago. Perry brings up George's first wife, and gets him to admit that Louise left an estate of around a million dollars. Perry requests an autopsy of Grace Gordon, but Burger's next witness, Dr. Meecham (Charles Davis), testifies that this has already occurred. No arsenic was found. It was impossible to check for cyanide, because the body had been embalmed before the autopsy. (Formaldehyde in embalming fluid destroys cyanide.)

During a recess, following a request from Perry, Vicky produces the missing letters, including Charlotte's signed photo, saying she found them taped to the back of the mirror in Louise's room. They recognize Charlotte as Martha the maid. Vicky explains that while Louise would have of course seen the photo, she never had the opportunity to recognize ""Martha"" because only Vicky and Nora Mae were allowed to enter Louise's room. Back in court, she repeats all this on the stand, and admits she was careless in not checking out the phony maid's references, because the household was desperate for help. Perry counters that she had the letters all along and hired Charlotte intentionally, to involve George. She wanted to frame him, because if convicted he'd be barred from inheriting and the money (under Louise's earlier will, still in effect) would go to Vicky as nearest living relative. She confesses, saying that Louise constantly wore her wealth like a badge and treated Vicky as nothing but a poor relative.

Later, Perry explains to Della and Nora Mae that he knew Vicky had the letters all along. The claim of finding them behind the mirror had to be a lie, because if Tragg says he's done a thorough search, you know it was extremely thorough. Nora Mae again negotiates her fee and pays Perry $25 for defending her."

He takes his family on a ship cruise where his wife consults Perry about the cash, but when Carl apparently goes overboard, she is charged with murder.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['asking for an autograph', 'accountant', 'dress', 'money belt', 'man uses a wheelchair', 'speaking on the telephone through a handkerchief', 'fingerprint', 'purser', 'ship captain', 'storm at sea', 'man overboard', 'ocean liner', 'courtroom spectator', 'title spoken by character']",[],"In his office, Andrew Dale (Maurice Wells), president of State National Savings & Loan, is reluctant to lose bookkeeper Carl Houser (Theodore Newton), but wishes him well. In a store room, Carl secretly loads up a money belt.

On the cruise ship Westminster, Perry and Della are returning from a contested will case in British Columbia. The meet come fellow passengers: Carl; his wife Anna (Lurene Tuttle); their daughter Laura (Maureen Cassidy); nurse Evelyn Whiting (Joan Tabor); Roger Cartman (Alec Cawthorne), her wheelchair bound and heavily bandaged patient who is unable to speak due to a broken neck; L.A. realtor Roland Carter (Ralph Dumke); and Roland's secretary Daniel James (Donald Lawton). In her cabin, Anna tells Perry about cash, originally $100,000, in the money belt, which Carl told her came from winning a lottery, but she believes was stolen. Perry has Paul investigate the matter, and soon he is in the office of the S&L president, trying to keep Dale from jumping to conclusions about Carl. Sure enough, the accountants report that the books balance perfectly.

On the ship, there's been a report of a man overboard. Perry goes to Anna's cabin, where a photo of Anna and Laura has been replaced by one of Carl. Captain Walters (Gavin Gordon) and ship's purser Buchanan (Noel Drayton) enter. They've found Carl's gun and believe he was washed overboard. A search of the cabin produces a dress Anna was wearing earlier, now very wet, and the money belt, which still has $91,500 in it. In jail, Anna says that Carl took off his money belt and left the cabin. She followed him to the boat deck, getting wet, but Carl kissed her and told her to leave. She also mentions that they moved to L.A. from Chicago about a year ago, the impetus apparently being a blizzard. Della informs Perry that daughter Laura has disappeared.

In court, Burger produces the ship's log to prove that Westminster was in California territorial waters, so the court has jurisdiction. Purser Buchanan testifies about finding the wet dress and the money belt. On cross-examination, he states that the last time he saw Carl alive was when he handed him a note from nurse Evelyn. She gave it to him when she and her patient Roger were exiting the lift that goes to the ship's hospital. During a recess, Paul brings Perry to a house in Pacific Palisades where Evelyn and her patient went after docking. Evelyn's address on the ship's passenger list was phony, and Paul couldn't find anything about Roger Cartman. They've both left the house, but the wheelchair is still inside. The house is owned by Chicago gambling figure Morgan Shreeves, who recently walked on a tax evasion charge. Perry decides he and Paul should enter the house through a window and leave their fingerprints.

Later, Paul calls Burger, disguising his voice, and tells Burger that Evelyn and her patient saw everything from the ship's hospital, and that they've left a house where Perry has left fingerprints. Burger of course thinks this means Perry bribed them to disappear, but it's really a scheme to get the police to track Evelyn down. In court, Burger calls Laura as his next witness. The police arrested her at LAX when she returned from San Francisco. She testifies that she was on 'A' Deck of the ship when she heard a gunshot on the boat deck immediately above. She looked up and saw what she thought was a woman pushing a man over the guard rail and the man falling into the sea. Burger gets her to admit that she thought the people she saw were her mother and father. On cross-examination, Perry gets her to recall that she reported over ship's radio that ""a man"" went overboard, not her father. She realizes that the notion that she saw her parents entered her mind later, when her father was reported missing. Before court recesses, Burger announces that Carl's body has been found.

Paul reports to Perry with details. The body was found floating a mile offshore and died of a gunshot, but not from Carl's gun, which had been found on the ship. Also, Carl was on the jury in Chicago that acquitted Shreeves. Back in court, Burger, openly out to get Perry, calls fingerprint expert Christopher Walsh (Bill Quinn). He produces prints found at the house in Pacific Palisades and testifies that they match Evelyn Whiting, an unknown person many of whose prints were on the wheelchair and thus assumed to be Roger Cartman, homeowner Morgan Shreeves, Perry Mason, and Paul Drake. On cross, Perry asks if he also has Carl Houser's prints from having recently identified the body, and he does. Perry then gets him to demonstrate identifying the prints without seeing the names written on the cards. In doing so, he finds prints on two cards that are identical - those of Carl and the man assumed to be Roger. (By now it should be obvious that there isn't a Roger Cartman, or an Alec Cawthorne.) So Carl was in the Pacific Palisades house at a time well after when he supposedly died aboard Westminster. Burger suspects trickery in all this and requests a recess, but Perry asks for the opportunity to examine Evelyn first, and Burger agrees.

She admits she and her husband worked for Shreeves and that Carl was bribed to hold out for his acquittal. That, not embezzlement, was the source of the $100,000. Shreeves was nervous about loose ends, so got Carl to agree to disappear. The ""body"" that Laura saw go overboard was actually a dummy, and the man in the wheelchair whom Perry and Della had seen with Evelyn earlier was Shreeves himself. The plan went wrong when Anna was accused of murder, as Carl wouldn't allow that to stand. Shreeves needed him dead. Knowing she's now suspected of murder, Evelyn screams for Shreeves to come forward. Her husband Roland Carter stands, shouts ""You want Morgan Shreeves? Well, here he is!"", and pulls Daniel James out of his seat.

At night in Perry's office, Paul looks out into rain, which makes him hungry. Luckily, Della arrives with food. Perry explains that a key clue was the substitution of Carl's photo for the one of Anna and Laura. Only Carl had a motive to do that, wanting a memento of the family he was reluctantly leaving - and that made sense only if he didn't expect to die. Della still credits Perry with mental telepathy, saying she was floored when James, not Carter, turned out to be Shreeves. Perry admits that he was floored too, which makes Paul choke on his sandwich."

At the office of the motel Glenn owns, Castle enters and tells Glenn he wants him to pay up on $8000 in promissory notes. He'd promised Glenn more times, but the only thing in writing is ""payable on demand"", and he's demanding. Glenn realizes that Castle's plan all along was to force him to sell his motel. Some investors want to put a casino on the property, and Castle promised he could get it for them. He even put of $50,000 as a guarantee. Castle decides Glenn is too tough to deal with, so he shoots him dead, hoping to fare better with his daughter Stephanie (Peggy McCay). However, when he goes to her in L.A., she puts him off. She won't do anything until she gets advice from her friend Mike Garvin (Sr.) (Lyle Talbot).

Michael Garvin, Jr. (William Swan), who was once engaged to Stephanie, goes to Castle to warn him off. Castle tells Junior he should go back to his used-car lot or his new bride, ex-model Margo Garvin (Ann McCrea). Then he slugs Junior and tosses him out. Castle next pays a call on Eva Elliott (Alix Talton), now working as Mike's secretary, and accuses her of telling Junior about his designs on Stephanie. He warns her that he knows about checks she forged back in Kansas. They're interrupted by a call from Stephanie, wanting to talk to Mike. Eva says he's away and she doesn't know when he'll be back. After Castle takes his leave, Eva calls Stephanie back and says that Mike is coming in from Vegas and that he left a message for Stephanie to meet him next morning in Perry's office. After hanging up, Castle lets Eva know that he was eavesdropping at the door, and repeats his threats to expose her.

In Perry's office, Mike says that Castle's offer of $90,000 is only half what the land is worth. He suspects Castle murdered Glenn. He mentions that he's well protected with three revolvers (with proper permits). He keeps one in his vault, one with his son Junior, and one in a holster he wears at all times. Perry tells him he should go to the Las Vegas police with his suspicions about Castle. The talk of her father's death upsets Stephanie, and Mike attempts to comfort her. After they leave, Della says she thinks Mike is in love with her.

Perry goes to see Castle and demands an offer of $225,000 for the land. Castle tries desperately to bargain, but Perry knows when someone is over a barrel. Castle finally agrees, and Perry tells him to come to the office next morning. He leaves the apartment building and calls Paul from a phone booth. As they discuss Castle, Perry sees Stephanie drive up and enter the building. Then the police arrive and Perry notices Stephanie attempting to sneak out a back way. He intercepts her and offers her a ride. As he's turning his car around, Lt. Tragg steps up and begins a friendly chat. Stephanie won't say a word. After Tragg leaves, Perry tells Stephanie that Castle has been murdered. She asks how he knows, and he says that nothing else would get the homicide lieutenant out late at night. She's still unwilling to talk about what happened.

The next day, Margo visits her husband at Junior's Used Cars to give him the gun he forgot to take with him. Mike calls Perry and asks him to defend Stephanie, even if it conflicts with his own interests. Perry visits Stephanie, who shows him the gun Mike gave her for her protection, after they left Perry's office. She says she's never fired it, but Perry checks and finds that it has been fired recently. She admits she visited Castle in the hope of learning something about her father's murder, but found him already dead. Perry visit's Junior's office, asks to see his gun and ""accidentally"" fires it, damaging Junior's desk. Perry hands the gun back to him and has him bring it to Stephanie. If she's ever asked, she's to say that Michael Garvin gave it to her. Perry and Della are dining al fresco when a tired Tragg shows up. He has arrested Stephanie, and ballistics tests show that the gun they found with her was the murder weapon. Now Perry worries that he may have framed his own client.

In court, Eva testifies that she saw Mike with no gun in his holster the night of the murder. She knows of the three guns, but couldn't possible tell one from another, as they are identical except for serial number. During a recess, Paul reports that Castle secretly owned 40% of Julie's, a swanky dress shop in Vegas. Della calls it the kind of place where expensive (in 1958 dollars) merchandise is shown by long-legged models. Both Eva and Margo were formerly among these, and Paul is surprised when Mike claims he never knew that about his secretary and daughter-in-law. Back in court, Junior testifies about Perry's visit to the lot, and angrily accuses him of switching guns. He points out that the gun that was originally in his possession could be identified by the initials he had scratched on the handle. It's not the one proved to be the murder weapon. On cross-examination, he admits to Margo having brought him a gun when he forgot it. Perry suggests that she would have had time to shoot Castle with it. Now Junior gets really mad, until the judge (Frank Wilcox) reins him in with the threat of a contempt citation.

Burger tries to rectify confusion over three guns by calling them the ""vault gun"", ""Junior gun"", and ""holster gun"" and attempting to trace their movements. Having ballistics check the bullet Perry fired into Junior's desk would have helped, but the bullet ricocheted out a window and couldn't be found. Perry wonders if Eva thinks of Mike as a father figure, but she insists he's ""much younger"" than her father. (This was obviously just her perception. Lyle Talbot was four years older than Russell Thorson.) She thinks his questions are irrelevant, but he says they may hold the answer to the mystery of the guns.

Perry recalls Mike, who testifies that he visited Stephanie late that night (after the murder) and switched the gun he'd previously given Stephanie (""holster gun"") with his spare (""vault gun""), which he'd just retrieved. He explains that he made the switch out of fear that Stephanie had shot Castle in self-defense. Only he and Eva had the combination to the vault. Perry says that since Mike's office is close to Castle's apartment building, Eva had time in the half-hour that Mike was away to remove the ""vault gun"", kill Castle with in, then return it to the vault, following which Mike took it. She confesses, explaining that she was trying to get out from under the hold that Castle had on her.

At the used-car lot, Junior is getting the new desk that Perry is going to pay for. The movement of the three guns still doesn't make sense, but we learn that Stephanie, fearing that Mike might have shot Castle, hid the ""Junior gun"" and let the police find the ""vault gun"", which was still in her possession. She and Mike are at the Hall of Records at the moment, getting a marriage license.

To review: (1) Initially, the three guns are in their rightful places. (2) Mike gives Stephanie the ""holster gun"". (3) Eva takes the ""vault gun"" from the vault, shoots Castle with it, and returns it. (3) Mike takes the ""vault gun"" and switches it with the ""holster gun"". He thinks he's just taken a possible murder weapon from her and replaced it with an innocent gun. However, from this point until her arrest, Stephanie possesses the murder weapon.

Stewart Brent marries Miss Anne Rowan in Las Vegas"". She goes to tell her roommate and fellow blonde Enid Griffin (Barbara Baxley), but finds her unconscious. She's taken an overdose of sleeping pills, but Sheila found her in time and Enid will be O.K. She tells Sheila she was upset over the marriage, as she's now in love with Stewart, for whom she works as private secretary. She regrets the suicide attempt and vows to fight for Stewart.

Stewart (Grant Withers) arrives at the Brent Building, which he owns, and runs into Perry, whose offices are there. He invites Perry and Della to a reception in honor of his bride. After Stewart gets to his office, where Sheila also works as a secretary-receptionist, Arthur Binney (Richard Erdman) enters and asks to see Stewart. Sheila hands him over to Enid, who soon after enters Stewart's office and says that Binney wants to see him on a private matter concerning his wife. While there, she surreptitiously turns on the intercom, then leaves as Binney enters. He claims to represent a scandal magazine, but it's just a cover for a blackmail scheme. He gives Stewart a copy of a mugshot indicating that Anne spent a year in jail on insurance fraud. He wants $30,000 in one week. Enid hears all this, but Stewart notices that the intercom is already on when he uses it to have Enid contact the Paul Drake Detective Agency. Paul comes to see him, and Stewart admits he'd met Anne in Vegas and had only known her for two weeks when they got married. Paul will need Anne's fingerprints to check the validity of the mugshot, so Stewart invites him to the reception.

At the reception, Anne (Mari Aldon), another blonde, tells the bartender to make new martinis with less vermouth, despite Enid's mention that the first Mrs. Brent liked them that way. Anne is clearly trying to win over the reluctant Enid. She candidly admits to habitually misplacing earrings, and lights Enid's cigarette. Much to their surprise, Della and Perry see Paul swipe the lighter that Anne just put down. After the party, Paul meets Stewart at the latter's office and says Anne's prints match the mugshot. She really did spend a year in jail in Tacoma, WA. After Paul leaves, Stewart grabs several packets of bills and a gun from the desk and puts them in his briefcase. He gets a call from Binney, who tells him the week is up and directs him to the Valley Motel, telling him to register as Thomas Walsh.

At the motel, Binney tells his female partner (whom we never see clearly) that she needs to leave because Stewart is on his way. She drops a towel she was using and goes. Binney apparently knows that Stewart will be given the unit adjoining his own, since he comes through the connecting door and hides behind the outer door to Stewart's unit. Once Stewart enters, Binney knocks him on the head with a blunt instrument and grabs the briefcase from the unconscious body. He dumps the contents on the bed and takes the money, but avoids touching the gun. When Stewart wakes up, he goes to the bathroom shared by the two units to deal with his head wound. He picks up the towel and his gun falls out. There's a small hole encircled with a black substance on the towel. The phone in Binney's room starts ringing, and when Stewart looks in, he sees a dead Binney. The money is gone, but Stewart finds an earring next to the body. He wraps it in the towel and puts it in his coat pocket. Motel manager Harry Mitchell (Wally Brown), who has been calling for Binney, enters and catches Stewart with the gun in his hand. Later, Lt. Tragg has arrived and Stewart freely confesses to the murder. He's put in Tragg's police car, but the lieutenant is delayed by a call from Burger, so there's no one in the back seat with Stewart. He takes opportunity to cram the towel down into the seat.

When Perry visits Anne, she refuses to believe Stewart's confession that Binney was blackmailing him for involvement in a hit-and-run, so Stewart killed him. Perry says that a false confession means Stewart is shielding someone, and Anne is the most likely. It follows that Binney would try blackmailing her too. She admits to her year in Tacoma jail and that she'd given Binney a $2500 pair of earrings to buy him off, but swears that she's never been to the Valley Motel. In jail, Stewart admits to Perry that his confession was a like and gives him a summary of the events at the motel. He says Enid can prove he had her withdraw $30,000 from his bank account.

In Perry's office, Paul reports that Binney was an experienced blackmailer, having recently arrived from Tacoma. In the past, he had always worked solo. Enid arrives with the bank book that shows the $30,000 withdrawal. She mentions that when she saw Stewart in jail, he told her about the towel and earring he hid in Tragg's car. She says they have to find it before the police do, but this is one of the days when Perry is against evidence tampering. Later, at the police garage, the attendant (Cy Malis) wishes Tragg a happy birthday. Asked what makes him think that, he says a woman came by asking to leave a surprise birthday present in the lieutenant's car. She was quite upset when she wasn't allowed to do this. This gives Tragg an idea, so he and Sgt. Brice (Lee Miller) search the car and find the towel.

At the motel, Harry has let Perry and Della access to the crime scene. Perry examines a hole in the wall, from which the police have already extracted a bullet. Harry mentions that Binney was periodically visited by a blonde, and there was also a woman who called him nearly every day. She was calling when Harry came into the room, wondering why Binney didn't answer, and encountered Stewart. Later, Perry gets a call from an unidentified woman. She tips him off about Enid's suicide attempt.

In court, Enid identifies Stewart's briefcase. Burger mentions a statement Stewart made about finding his intercom open, which forces Enid to testify to the blackmail threat she overheard. She also discusses withdrawing the $30,000 and giving it to Stewart, but has to admit that she can't know whether he actually took it with him. Tragg testifies that the police tracked the path of the bullet, and concluded that the shot was fired from the doorway between Binney's unit and the one Stewart rented as Thomas Walsh. He also identifies the towel and earring he found in his car, and reports that it was one of a pair Stewart had purchased. Dr. Cortley (Alan Dexter), a consultant to the LAPD crime lab, testifies that tests prove that the towel was used normally, as indicated by traces of lipstick, etc., However, it was also used as a silencer, thus explaining why no one heard a gunshot at the time of the murder. On cross-examination, he says that traces of hair on the towel were from a peroxide blonde who was originally a light brunette. He says it's possible that the bullet tracking was off by as much as a few feet, making it possible that the gun was fired from near the bathroom.

During a recess, Paul confirms Enid's suicide attempt. Perry has him take photos of the three blonde women involve in the case to Harry, in the hope that some time to study them will make it easier for him to identify Binney's visitor in court. The next day, Harry testifies that no woman was with Binney near the time of the murder, but there was a blonde visitor to his room 2 or 3 times a week. He identifies Sheila as the visitor. She admits to being Binney's partner, but vehemently insists that he was alive when she left.

Later, Anne goes to the Valley Motel and asks to register in Binney's old unit, saying she's going to play ""Button, button, who's got the button?"" She tells Harry that she was the real mastermind of the blackmail scheme, Sheila just being a go-between. She decided to get $30,000 from Stewart because the marriage couldn't last long. She asks him where the money is, pointing out that she'd given Binney two earrings ""to make the plot look good"", so Harry must have taken them both but dropped one while moving the money. She says that Harry is entitled to $1,000 for his part in the plot, but he disagrees and pulls a gun. Tragg and his men enter and arrest Harry. Perry and Stewart follow, and the latter runs to Anne, clearly delighted with the success of her charade. Perry tells Tragg that Harry was the person best positioned to enter Binney's unit while Stewart was unconscious. Stewart and Anne are apparently busy congratulating each other on the outcome, so Tragg suggests he and Perry wait in the car."

It appears that Bertrand's step-daughter struck Fleetwood as she was driving toward the house but the cover-up results in murder.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['hedge', 'car', 'motel', 'dog', 'footprint', 'cigarette smoking', 'amnesia', 'pay phone', 'telephone booth', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"Bertie Allred (Neil Hamilton, Commissioner Gordon on ""Batman"") asks his wife Lucille (Ann Lee) if dinner can be delayed, as his employee Bob Fleetwood (Harry Townes) is coming. His stepdaughter Pat Faxon (Yvonne Craig, Barbara Gordon on ""Batman"") says Bertie should move his car, which is partially blocking the driveway. She clipped the hedge while maneuvering around it. When Bertie does so, he finds a collapsed Bob near the hedge and brings him into the house.

On Monday morning, Della brings Perry a check for $2500 and a letter from Lucille asking him to represent Pat or her if it should become necessary. Perry visits Pat, who explains about possibly hitting Bob with her car. Luckily, he wasn't dead, just unconscious, but he woke with amnesia. Bertie and Lucille took him out of the house, but Pat doesn't know where. She mentions that Lucille plans to get a divorce, which upsets the greedy Bertie, since her wealth isn't community property. Perry suggests an alternate explanation: someone slugged Bob to frame Lucille. If it's Bertie, that makes him dangerous.

Paul has learned that Lucille is at the Mountain View Hotel, so he and Perry drive there in heavy rain. The door to her unit is open and there are signs that a man and a woman were there until recently. Perry finds Lucille at her home. She says that she and Bob were waiting for Bertie in her unit, but eventually Bob went back to his adjoining unit and when she checked on him discovered he'd left and driven off in her car. She called Pat to pick her up. Lt. Tragg arrives with the news that Lucille's car has been found at the bottom of a canyon, with a dead Bob. The car was in neutral, so it's murder. He says that Lucille was seen to have left with Bob, then returned on foot before Pat came to take her home. After getting word from another detective, Tragg makes a revision: despite having Bob's identification, the corpse is definitely not him, but Bertie.

Paul has learned that Bob is staying at the ranch of P. E. Overbrook (James Bell) a few miles from the hotel. Perry and Della go there, with Della posing as the amnesiac's wife Mabel. He denies ever having seen her before. When Perry asks how would he know, he says it's just a feeling. They manage to get him to leave with them, and turn him over to LAPD, where he's questioned and then sent to the hospital. Tragg tells Perry that Bob remembers walking along the hedge when something hit him, but nothing after that.

Lucille denies going in the car with Bob. She says she walked down to the road from the hotel to attempt to hitchhike, but changed her mind and came back, where Pat found her. She says that Bertie was a liar and a cheat. He might have gone as far as murdering her to prevent her threatened divorce. Perry notes that Burger can use that as a motive for her to kill him first. Paul reports that Bob was visited at the hospital by his girlfriend, Bernice Archer (Frances Helm). They visit her, and she says she wasn't worried because Bob had experienced bouts of amnesia before, and when he called from the hospital he said he wasn't mixed up in anything.

At the hospital, Perry and Tragg confront Bob with inconsistencies in his supposed amnesia. He says that at his job he'd discovered papers showing that Bertie had forged a survey on mining property in order to swindle his partner out of a fortune. Unfortunately, he exclaimed ""What's this?"" on seeing the evidence - Bertie heard this, figured out what it was about, and knocked Bob unconscious. On Monday night, Bertie came back to the hotel with a gun, obviously intending to murder him, and perhaps Lucille too. He forced Lucille to get into the trunk of the car and made Bob drive. On the steep road, Bob suddenly accelerated then slammed on the brakes, causing Bertie to bump his head on the dashboard and drop the gun. Bob grabbed it and conked him on the head with it. He went to Overbrook's ranch because he was aware that Overbrook was another person Bertie had swindled. At the ranch, he parked the car between the road and the house, and area that was muddy after the earlier rain. Then Lucille somehow got the trunk open, or maybe it wasn't closed all the way. She jumped out and ran toward the road, ignoring Bob. Once they leave the room, Tragg tells Perry that the police have secret information that confirms Bob's story, and even Bob doesn't know about it yet.

In court, Bob tells his story. On cross-examination, Perry merely asks Bob why Bertie was found with his personal possessions and ID. Bob says Bertie must have taken them for reasons of his own. Burger now reveals the source of the secret information. It turns out that Overbrook is an experienced tracker. Using a detailed diagram made by the police, he recounts how the morning after Bob's arrival he backtracked along the route Bob had left, leading him to where Lucille's car had been left. He found tracks of a woman's shoes, running from near where the trunk would have been to the road, and walking from another part of the road to the car. There are also tire tracks of the car being turned around and driven back on the road. There are also prints Overbrook made when he walked from this area to the farm road, from which he gathered boards he set down so investigators could walk from the farm road to the car's location without disturbing things. Lucille tells Perry that she didn't make any of the tracks.

During a recess, Perry, Della, and Paul go to the Overbrook farm. Della notices the gap between the two sets of woman's footprints. ""Coming and going"" says Perry. Paul's worried that there's nothing there to contradict Bob's account. Bernice couldn't have made the tracks Monday night, because her whereabouts have been confirmed. Perry has Della try running in the mud, but ultimately concludes that something Paul said is the key to the mystery.

Back in court, Perry calls Bernice. He has a record of a phone call to her from Bob on the murder night. He suggests that early Tuesday morning, by which time knowledge of all her movements was no longer certain, she could have made false prints to frame Lucille. She denies it, so Perry calls Overbrook for the purpose of proving his suggestion. He gets the tracking expert to admit that there's nothing in the prints that shows that the track from the car to the road was made first. Someone could have walked from the road to where the car had been then run back to the road. Overbrook admits it, and adds that there was a bush squashed by the car that the woman could have stepped on to avoid leaving prints in the gap between the two sets of prints. So the tracks don't confirm Bob's improbably story of Lucille escaping from the trunk after all. Perry then asks him to explain his dog Prince's footprints, which are also on the police diagram. They show that Prince made lots of prints between the car area and the farm road, but did not accompany Overbrook when he backtracked Bob from the house to the farm. So these prints were the result of separate occasions. Perry suggests that Overbrook did the backtracking while leaving Prince to guard Bob, found the car with an unconscious Bertie, a man he hated. He took the car and ran it into the canyon, then returned. Later, he realized there were prints of him going to the car but not leaving the area. Therefore, he got the boards and laid them to cover up his approach to the car area, then stepped off and walked back to the farm road. On this occasion, Prince was with him. Overbrook admits his actions, but says that Bertie was already dead when he found him. Bob shouts ""That's a lie! He was all right!""

Leaving court, Perry says Paul gave him the key to the solution when he talked about the woman's prints ""coming and going"" - the opposite order from what everyone was assuming. (However, it was Perry himself who used those words, not Paul.) Burger thanks Perry for handing him the guilty party - it had to be Overbrook. Perry counters with some alternative assumptions that make it credible that Bob is guilty, and Burger leaves, annoyed. Perry admits to Paul and Della that Burger had it right. He just doesn't want to establish the precedent of agreeing with the D.A."

As he heads for the office of the boss, Philip Larkin (Terry Becker), Philip comes out and tells George to wait for him. Philip then proceeds to invite himself to Lorraine's place, but she says no. She angrily ended their relationship due to ""cruel accusations"" that Philip made. Philip waves an envelope in her face, saying it contains proof, which he intends to use to force her back to him. He's in the middle of an ""If I can't have you, no one will"" threat when senior secretary Irene Collaro (Virginia Field) reminds him that George is waiting.

Lorraine gets a note - she assumes it's from George - telling her to go to Alcorn's Jewelers and pick up a package. She arrives just before their 9 PM closing, and Mr. Alcorn (Chet Stratton) has no record of such a package. She tries calling George, but the phone is answered by George's wheelchair-bound wife Claire, who believes any woman who communicates with George is having an affair with him. She yells at Lorraine, calling her a trollop, but hangs up when George enters the room. Lorraine next tries calling Philip, but Philip can't answer because he's lying on the floor of his room, dead. Next to him are a gun and a nervous Joseph Harrison (John Hoyt). Handkerchief in hand, he picks up the phone and puts it back down, then leaves the house. This has the effect of making Lorraine give up on dealing with the supposed package, so she apologizes for keeping Alcorn past closing time and leaves the store.

A couple hours later, Joseph returns to the house to find Lt. Tragg and his men in mid-investigation. Someone must have given them a tip almost immediately after the murder. Joseph tells Tragg he has come to see his ex-wife, Ethel (Fay Wray), who is Philip's mother by her first husband. Tragg produces the murder weapon, a World War I German gun, and Joseph admits it's his. Tragg already knows that for 6 months Joseph was under a doctor's care in Utah, up until 2 weeks ago. Joseph confirms this and says he spent the past two weeks at Lake Tahoe and just drove back to L.A.

The next day, Tragg shows Burger that Joseph's fingerprints are on the gun case, despite his claim that he'd just arrived. They couldn't be old prints, as the Harrison's maid, Sarah Winslow (Nancy Kulp), reported that she'd polished the case earlier that day. There were no identifiable prints on the gun itself. She also told Tragg that Philip resented Joseph, who when he married Ethel took over management of the company her first husband had founded, dissolving his own smaller company. Philip somehow worked on his mother until she finally agreed to divorce Joseph and let Philip take over the company. This is enough for Burger - he tells Tragg to bring in Joseph.

In Perry's office, Ethel asks Perry to represent Joseph, who has been arrested. It's clear to Perry that she's still in love with her ex-husband. In jail, Joseph admits to Perry that he went to Philip's room arount 9 PM and found him dead. He guesses that he must have touched the gun case in a moment of panic after seeing his gun on the floor. Lorraine tells Perry about her fruitless trip to the jewelry and unavailing phone calls. This sounds like an arranged alibi to Perry, but Paul reports that Alcorn confirms it. Paul hasn't been able to learn why Lorraine stopped seeing Philip. What he does know, from a source he won't even tell Perry, is that Burger apparently has secret evidence that will send Joseph straight to the gas chamber.

Ethel has disappeared, and both Perry and Burger want her found. Paul goes to Irene's apartment posing as a gas company man. Unfortunately, Irene just had a visit from the real gas man two days ago. She says Ethel isn't there and won't let Paul inside. Meanwhile, Sarah visits Burger and tells him that Ethel packed and left shortly after talking to Perry. Burger, true to form, jumps to the conclusion that Perry is guilty of professional misconduct.

In court, Sarah recounts what has she already told. On cross-examination, she explains that she was in the kitchen at the time, therefore at a distant part of a large, solidly-built house. No phone near her location rang when Lorraine called, because Philip had a separate line. Perry asks about her prints being on a door to Philip's room. She says she must have opened the door to air out the room, but doesn't remember when. Burger forces Lorraine to admit that Joseph was affectionate to her in a fatherly way, and objected to Philip as unworthy of her. Burger then plays a silent home movie, although it's admissibility is subject to later voir dire. (The term can refer not only to jury selection but to things like establishing the qualifications of an expert witness. Apparently, something like that is intended here, with the film instead of an expert.) The film shows Joseph and Lorraine as she tries on a necklace. They laugh and smile at the camera, until Philip enters. There is angry arguing and pointing at the camera, climaxing with Joseph punching Philip, knocking him into a hedge.

During a recess, Joseph refuses to say what the fight was about. Meanwhile, Claire finds a torn-up letter from Ethel to George and draws her usual conclusion. Unconvincingly attempting to disguise her voice, she calls Perry and tells him to investigate Ethel, because she's in love with George. Perry points out that he doesn't know where Ethel is, so Claire reads the return address on Ethel's letter. It's Irene's apartment. Perry finds Ethel there, and she explains that the letter was just information she wanted George to pass on to Joseph. Perry says he needs Ethel in court, but Irene insists that this could hurt an innocent party. Perry realizes that Irene was the one behind the camera on that home movie. Tragg arrives, ending any debate about where Ethel will be tomorrow.

In court, Irene reveals that in the film, Philip was accusing Joseph of being Lorraine's father. Perry insists on his right to go beyond normal cross-examination rules because they're in a voir dire. He notes Irene's foreign accent and asks how she got her job. She says that while scouting for possible European branch offices, they came to where she was working in Paris, and she ended up working for Joseph. She never heard any hint that Joseph was Lorraine's father. Perry says there are records of Irene's monthly checks to Lorraine's childhood foster parents, and she got Lorraine her job. He concludes that all that pointing at the camera in the movie was because Philip was also accusing Irene, behind the camera, of being Lorraine's mother. She admits it's true. Perry has the court reporter (Richard Bull) read back the part of Irene's testimony where she said ""they came"", so it wasn't just Joseph. Who is she protecting? George confesses to being Lorraine's father and to murdering Philip, which was his way of finally trying to protect her.

Later, Della tells Paul that George didn't intend to frame Joseph by using his gun. He did this merely to confuse the case because, unaware of Joseph's departure from Utah, he thought the police would find that Joseph was a thousand miles away at the time. It was his note that sent Lorraine on the errand to the jewelry store, establishing her alibi around 9. He also tipped the police to the murder soon afterward, so they'd arrive soon enough to get a good fix on the time of death and rule out Lorraine as a suspect."

Diana grabs the gun, but in the struggle it goes off, sending a bullet into the wall and bringing in building superintendent Otto Kessler (Ludwig Stössel). Diana only stays at the apartment on her days off from her secretarial job at the home of wealthy Matthew Bartlett (R.G. Armstrong), where she also has a room. On her next day at work, Matthew's stepson Tony Davis (Jan Merlin) makes a pass at Diana, annoying her. He's the cause of the friction between her and Marian, whom he's seeing. It amuses the smug Tony to tell Marian that Diana keeps throwing herself at him. Diana leaves the room, giving Tony a chance to snoop. He finds an anonymous letter to Matthew claiming that his late son Robert and Robert's wife Norma Carter (Adventures of Superman (1952)'s Phyllis Coates) had a son, Bobby (Casey Peters), and that Norma is an unfit mother to Matthew's grandson. Later, Tony shows the letter to his mother, now Helen Bartlett (Irene Hervey), who only married Matthew to provide security for ne'er-do-well Tony. Helen knows the claim in the letter is plausible, so she sends Tony to visit Bobby and his mom at her house. He's useless as a spy, and Norma tells him to get out.

Helen and Tony decide to get rid of Diana by planting ""stolen"" jewelry in Diana's room at the Bartlett house shortly before Matthew returns from a trip. Diana says she intends to tell Matthew about the stolen anonymous letter, so they forcibly throw her out. In the process, Tony strikes her, giving her the titular black eye. Diana goes to Perry, who has Della take a photo of Diana's injury, then they drive her to her apartment. The next day, Perry goes to see Matthew, who doesn't need any convincing that Diana is the injured party. He regrets his marriage to Helen, which was the result of an emotional tailspin after the death of his son. He already knew about Bobby, as the anonymous letter writer had previously called him with the same information, which Matthew pretended to disbelieve. The letter was obviously a second attempt by the same source. Unexpectedly, Lt. Tragg enters and says that Diana has been murdered, her body and car having been found outside Norma's house. However, when they arrive at the scene, Matthew recognizes the body as Marian's. When Norma returns home, she says that she and Marian were good friends.

Diana is missing, but before long comes to Perry's office and explains: That night, she received a call that her car had been involved in an accident. This lures Diana to the scene, leaving footprints for the police to later identify, of course. She finds no one home, but then discovers Marian's body. Panicking, she finds her car won't start, so she hitches a ride to Union Station and spends the night there. Tragg arrives to arrest her as a suspected murderer. Perry interviews Diana in jail, and from her account of how she got her job, gets her to realize that Matthew only hired her as a pipeline to information about Bobby, who often visited his mother's friend Marian.

In court, D.A. Burger brings out the footprint evidence and Kessler's misleading account of the gun incident. Tony testifies that he and Marian were engaged, and that Diana was angry about it. Perry cross-examines him aggressively, bringing up the black eye. After court is adjourned, Matthew meets with Norma, begs her to let him bring up Bobby, and offers her $100,000 to make up for his earlier shabby treatment of her. At first, Norma rejects the money, but takes it when Matthew asks her to do it for Bobby's sake. Back in court, Burger introduces Marian's diary, which the police found in her apartment, to show the tension between her and Diana over Tony. Perry insists that he has the right to look over the diary, to check whether the parts that Burger had read were taken out of context. The judge lets him do so during an adjournment.

Soon, Perry and Della make a call on Norma. There were entries in the diary that meant nothing to the police or Burger, who didn't know about the situation with Bobby, but revealed much to Perry. He tells Norma he knows that she is not Bobby's mother, Marian was. (The father isn't named, but he wasn't Robert Bartlett.) Norma took the child from her unwed friend, supposedly out of kindness, but actually with the long-range goal of selling him to Matthew. She even was the source of the anonymous messages, and called herself an unfit mother to plant the seed in Matthew's mind that he should take Bobby. However, Marian's return to L.A. complicated things, so Norma murdered her to keep her from interfering. Norma leaves her house and drives off, with the police in pursuit. She swerves to avoid a bus and crashes. Dying in the hospital, she confesses. Burger moves to have Tony arrested for perjury.

In the epilogue, Perry decides not to reveal to Matthew that Bobby is unrelated to him. He does point out that raising a small boy may be a job for more than just a grandfather. Matthew takes the hint and decides to call Diana to see if she'd like to help out. Helen is apparently out of the picture. Della wonders whether Perry is doing the right thing, but when he asks her if she can think of one good reason for spilling the beans about Bobby, she admits that she can't even think of a bad reason."

She escapes him, and enters Perry's outer office. Gertie (Connie Cezon), the rarely-seen receptionist, assumes this is the typist Della requested from a temp agency, and the woman plays along. In Perry's private office, Paul mentions the police search for a would-be burglar of the SADC offices. Della realizes that the description fits her new typist, who has suddenly left.

Perry goes up to the SADC offices, on the way encountering an attractive woman (Joan Elan). (Much later, he'll learn this is Mrs. Lumis). Mr. Lumis tells Perry that after reporting the attempted burglary, Baxter disappeared. A ""wharf rat"" named Jack Gillly (Hank Patterson) sees a man dumping a body in the water, recovers it, and reports to Lt. Tragg. The corpse is Baxter, and in a line-up, Gilly points out the man he saw dumping it, identified as Duane Johnson, who quickly becomes Perry's client. As usual, Perry is faced with a client who's less than forthcoming, saying he has an alibi, but because it was a married lady, he won't identify her.

Meanwhile, Paul has tracked down the typist - she's Patricia Taylor, a senator's wife. Perry and Paul interview her, and she admits that when she first met her future husband, she found him pompous and drew some mocking cartoons which she sent to Duane Johnson, whom she thought was a friend. Later, she wrote to get them back and Johnson wrote that he'd hand them over, but at a meeting on the night of Baxter's murder, she's told that the letters could be used against the senator, unless some payment was forthcoming. Perry pressures her to come forward, so she does - to D.A. Burger.

In the People v. Jefferson jury trial, Heinrich (Harold Dyrenforth), a servant at the house Baxter had rented, testifies that he heard Baxter in an argument earlier in the evening of the murder. Perry gets him to admit that people could have come and gone without him knowing, and that he didn't see or hear any actual violence. The defendant takes the stand but still refuses to name his alibi. Patricia testifies she was at the restaurant to discuss the cartoons for about 15 minutes. A photo of the meeting was taken by a restaurant photographer. There's another photo of the defendant there with a different woman. Burger is more interested in bringing out details of the attempted blackmail, including introducing apparently friendly letters from Johnson to Patricia. He also points out that the meeting at the restaurant was short enough that it allowed the defendant time to commit the murder and dump the body. The jury returns a verdict of guilty on the charge of 1st degree murder.

The papers are full of predictions that Perry's going to lose a client to the gas chamber, but he's more preoccupied by that second photo. The woman in it looks familiar, and he finally places her as the one he saw exiting the SADC offices. He correctly guesses it might be Mrs. Lumis, and she's the one his client is protecting. She agrees to testify, but once Perry leaves, we learn that this will require her to stay behind while Mr. Lumis heads to Mexico with a ""package"". Then Lumis goes to retrieve a man he's been keeping prisoner, but Paul and Perry catch him.

In court, Perry reveals that the kidnapped man he just rescued is the real Duane Jefferson (Steve Carruthers), and the man he's been defending is an imposter, James Kincaid. Perry moves to have the entire case thrown out on a technicality. Some of the evidence Burger had produced (the letters to Patricia) were from the real Jefferson, not Kincaid. So this was false evidence with respect to the defendant, even though Burger had acted in good faith (since he believed that the real Jefferson was on trial). With the entire case thrown into confusion, the judge continues the hearing to a later day.

In Perry's office, he explains how Lumis wanted to steal diamonds from Baxter. When the real Jefferson wouldn't go along, he conspired with Kincaid - who decided to add some blackmail and murder into what Lumis expected to be mere larceny. Because of the identity confusion, Burger is going to have to try the entire case over again, but Perry is sure he'll win in the end. It's clear that Perry feels no obligation at all to Kincaid, because he agreed to defend a man named Duane Jefferson. Perry, Paul, and Della are on their way to dinner with the real Jefferson, a treat by Senator and Mrs. Taylor, who are grateful that Perry didn't introduce Patricia's cartoons in the trial."

Mason takes the case to court and wins Reed's freedom on a writ of habeas corpus. Before the writ can be served, however, Reed escapes and is charged with murder.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Roger Kay'],"['', '']",[],"['season finale', 'uncle nephew relationship', 'slot machine', 'reference to fairbanks alaska', 'airport', 'bugged telephone', 'habeas corpus', 'senile dementia', 'sanitarium', 'bank', 'reno nevada', 'hotel', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"When Donna Knox (Joan Camden) wants to cash a check for $20,000 made out to Maury Lewis (King Calder) and signed by Daniel Reid (Edgar Stehli), bank executive Herb Walker (William Remick) calls the home of Willard Scott (Arthur Space), Daniel's nephew with whom he lives. Willard's wife Arlene (Mary Anderson) takes charge and says not to honor the check and to tell Donna the truth - that Daniel is as crazy as they come. Daniel enters, takes the call, and insists the bank honor the check.

Donna brings the cash to Maury, who takes $500 to pay off former private investigator Dave Kemp (Alan Lee), who helped track down Daniel. Dave was promised half, but he can't even finish threatening Maury before Donna pulls a gun on him. Dave goes to Arlene and Willard, telling them that Maury and Donna will take Daniel ""for every dime they have"" (sic). He doesn't know what they have on Daniel to use for blackmail. Arlene's the one who knows what to do. They take an extremely unwilling Daniel to the Norris sanitarium, and tell Dr. Norris (Richard Aherne) that Daniel has been giving money to strangers. Norris diagnoses senile dementia.

In Perry's office, Millie Foster (Kitty Kelly), saying she's Daniel's fiancée, ask for help in getting him released. Perry petitions for a writ of habeas corpus. At the hearing, the Scotts' attorney George Metcalf (Simon Scott) explains to a skeptical Judge Treadwell (Richard Gaines) that Daniel is physically unable to be in court, as ordered. Norris explains than Daniel's absence was under his orders, because Daniel would be over-excited by the hearing. He explains that his diagnosis was based on Daniel's violent behavior and an arcus senilis (a crescent ring on the cornea) in his right eye. Perry points out that the judge also has this symptom. Norris tries to explain that he evaluated the combination of symptoms, but the judge interrupts. It's clear to him that if he'd objected to being kidnapped and manhandled, having this thing in his eye, he'd have been declared senile too. He orders the court to reconvene at the sanitarium, but when they get there, Daniel has cleverly escaped. He knocked out an attendant with a bar of soap inside a sock, then left, disguised as a laundryman. The judge has heard enough. He grants the writ of habeas corpus and says Norris will have to answer to contempt of court charges. Perry wonders where Daniel has gone.

As it happens, Daniel is in Maury's hotel room, bending over the blackmailer's corpse. He calls Millie and tells her to meet him at the usual place. As he leaves, janitor Victor Kowalski (Sid Tomack), in the process of carrying away a broken sand jar, sees Daniel, who is still pretending to be a laundryman. Later, the hunt is on for Daniel, and Paul reports that Millie is missing too. Dave calls Perry and tells him about Donna's relationship with Maury. Perry heads to her apartment, but Lt. Tragg gets there first. She's drinking to forget, but it's not working and she decides that revenge is better. She's quite willing to cooperate with the police in any way that will put Maury's killer in the gas chamber.

Millie calls and says that she and Daniel are in Reno. Paul and Perry go there and here Daniel's story. 30 years ago, he was in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he first met Millie. He and his partner Monty Siwel (sp?) discovered a gold mine. The greedy Monty tried to kill his partner, but Daniel was hot. He fired the first shot. He buried Monty in the snow, told people that Monty had to go to Seattle on business, and disappeared from Fairbanks by buying tickets to Seattle in Monty's name, which he used with Millie. They were married there, but she left him because he wouldn't go to the police about Monty. Later, Maury found the body, figured out what had happened, and eventually showed up to blackmail Daniel. Tragg enters with Nevada state troopers, and Daniel agrees to waive extradition.

After they leave, Perry and Paul discuss Tragg's surprisingly opportune arrivals. He suspects his office is bugged. He has Paul get a message to Della, so she'll know what Perry has in mind to confuse the police and Burger. The next day, he calls her at the office and makes up a story that Monty Siwel and Maury Lewis are the same person. He mentions that one surname spelled backwards is similar to the other (suggesting that Monty's last name is something other than ""Siwel"", as reported on IMDb, but not included on the episode credits). Daniel had a stronger motive than just blackmail to kill the partner he cheated out of a fortune. When Paul and Perry fly back to L.A., they are greeted by Della, who says that Perry's invented tale turns out to be completely true. Police in Alaska had Monty's fingerprints on file, and they match Maury's. In jail, Daniel tells Perry that he really thought at the time that he'd killed Monty, unaware that native trappers found him and nursed him back to health. He found out 3 months ago when Maury showed up for blackmail.

In court, Tragg testifies about switchboard records at Maury's hotel showing the call to Millie. On cross-examination, Perry asks him about what Tragg learned of the victim's movements after leaving Alaska. Tragg says Monty went from Fairbanks to Seattle where he married Millie, to various places, ending in a hotel in Phoenix before coming to L.A. Perry then asks about what Tragg learned from the Phoenix hotel manager, forcing Tragg to give a description that obviously matches Daniel, not Monty. Tragg has no explanation for the discrepancy. Victor testifies about seeing Daniel leave Maury's room at 9:26, saying that he checked his pocket watch. Perry points out that, by his own testimony, he had his hands full with a heavy broken sand jar at the time. Dave, the ex-P.I., visits Perry's office and says that Donna took the missing $20,000. Asked about his own whereabouts at the time of the murder, he says that he was discussing business with Arlene then. After he leaves, a dejected Perry tells Della that he'll just have to call Willard to testify about Daniel's mental incapacity, and hope for the best.

It's Burger who calls Willard, getting him to testify how the sanitarium visit ended with a writ of habeas corpus, effectively proving that Daniel was responsible for his actions. On cross, Perry asks him why, while supposedly working with family lawyer Metcalf for joint custody of Daniel's affairs with Arlene, he was also going behind her back with another lawyer to petition for sole guardianship. He doesn't have a good answer, so Perry asks him where he was at the time of the murder. Willard answers that he was at home with Arlene, but it turns out that Dave's claim that he was with Arlene at a nightspot is true, verified by the club's manager. Willard confesses to murdering Maury, claiming he thought Daniel would merely be put away somewhere rather than getting the gas chamber. His motive was a desperate desire to get away from Arlene and her constant nagging.

Back at the office, Tragg pulls apart Perry's phone, revealing a bug. He explains that he just learned of its existence. Dave planted it, then fed information to an eager beaver in Homicide in the hopes of getting his P.I. license back. Tragg promises that he won't. Perry mentions that it was Millie who shot Monty in Alaska, and Daniel was merely covering up for her. He also admits that his talk of having to call Willard as a witness was just an act for the D.A.'s benefit. Tragg suggests that Perry not invite Burger to his next performance."
