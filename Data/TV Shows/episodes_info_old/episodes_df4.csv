The Brothers Grimm, 1812



PORTLAND

A young woman, Sylvia Oster (Joy Flatz), is seen walking out of the double doors of a large building. Dressed in a red hooded sweatshirt, black cropped jogging bottoms and pink Nike running shoes she proceeds to insert earphones from her iPod before starting her jog, Sweet Dreams by The Eurythmics plays .

A weathered sign indicates the route of two trails, Talon Creek and Sweetbriar. Sylvia takes the Talon Creek trail, a dirt pathway in a densely wooded area. She stops when she sees a small Hummel figurine, of a girl, on a lichen covered log by the side of the trail. Looking around, and seeing no-one, Sylvia picks the figurine up, a look of consternation on her face as she gazes at it. Suddenly a dark unclear figure rushes in from the right bearing Sylvia away. Animal growling and fading, dying, screams are heard from off screen. The camera pans the moss covered trees in the surrounding area finally coming to rest on Sylvias still playing iPod which lies on the ground.

A busy city street. Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) is seen exiting a Jewellery store, a small box with an engagement ring held up in his left hand as he approaches his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) standing by their car. After some harmless banter and joking, where we find out Hank has been married four times while this will be Nicks first, they both turn to look at a pretty young blonde woman (Claire Coffee) who, coffee in hand, laughs and chats with another woman before proceeding on her way. Hank asks his friend ""Detective what are you looking at, you just bought a ring.."" Nick responds by giving Hank a description of what he sees ""She wears Armani, makes low six figures, drives a BMW and is falling for a senior partner at her law firm."" Hank ribs him for not just seeing a pretty young woman. As Hank turns away to get into the car Nick continues to watch the woman. Noticing his attention the woman smiles, then her face suddenly morphs into a grotesque vision, which Nick sees. The woman senses a change in Nicks demeanour and head down continues, unsmiling, on her way, while Nick looks on thoughtfully.

Nick and Hank walk down a wood lined pathway in company with a Forest Service Office (Burl Ross), who gives details pertaining to the discovery of the crime by a hiker. They stop, Nick kneeling to view a bloodied, fly covered, severed limb. The Forest Service Office informs them that ""the rest of her is off trail."" They proceed off to an area with fluorescent indicators scattered all around, and enquire as to how the officer knows the victim is a female. The Officer indicates a pink Nike running shoe. The officer tells the pair that normally they could recognize the animal which attacked, bear, cougar or wolf, by its tracks, however in this case it is interesting that the only track found is that of a boot. Nick shouts to the investigation teams that a cast be made of the imprint. Hank comments to the Officer that DNA would tell them whether ""this is your case or ours."" Retracing their steps Nick says to Hank that the case is reminiscent of one he heard occurring a month ago in Munson(?) Creek Falls. Hank agrees ""a hiker and a Bob cat"" to which Nick replies""except the Bob cat wasn't wearing boots."" Stopping suddenly Nick asks Hank if he hears music and proceeds outside the cordoned off area to find the joggers iPod, still playing Sweet Dreams, at the side of the path. He calls out his discovery to the investigators and then confirms the song playing for Hanks benefit.

Nick and Hank enter the Police station discussing what to do until they receive the DNA results; compiling a list of violent (human) predators in the area and getting more information on the Munson Creek Falls attack. Hank turns into a room leaving Nick to continue walking on down the corridor. Nick enters the main squad room and sees a seated, handcuffed angry young perp (Casey Vann) being processed by a colleague. The young man looks at Nick and his face changes, mouth widening and a forked tongue showing, he hisses at Nick. Nick, his attention looking at the perp in disbelief, collides with Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) who after a smart comment continues on his way.

A pale bald sick looking woman is seen behind the wheel of a vehicle as it makes its slow way down a tree lined suburban street. Looking in the direction of a well maintained house she turns down a road so she can access and park to the rear. Her vehicle is shown to be towing an old, although well maintained, travel Trailer. She gets out the car, and with the use of a stick, makes her way to the door where she peers into the lounge via the door window.

In the squad room Nick and Hank discuss the number, 25, of violent predators in a five mile radius of the crime scene, unfortunately none of them have MO's indicative of this crime. Replacing the phone Hank says they have a hit on the ID of the victim, Sylvia Oster, who went out jogging but did not return.

Standing outside, Nick and Hank take details of Sylvias disappearance from her friend (Tierra Valentine). They view a picture of the missing girl on her friends phone and confirm that she was wearing pink Nikes when she left for her run at 7.30am that morning.

Nick and Hank, back in the squad room, bring up Sylvias Oregon driving licence on the computer, confirming they now have a positive ID of the victim they decide to call it a day and go home. Nick picks up his jacket and the ring box falls out and is picked up by Hank who passes it back to him while commenting on Nicks ""Big night"".

Night time and Nick draws up in front of the house seen earlier. He exits the vehicle, stares at the house and then looks around and listens to the sounds of dogs yelping in the local area. He enters the house into a darkened hallway and calls out to Juliette Silverton (Elizabeth Tulloch), with whom he shares the home. Looking in the dining room he sees the bald woman seated at the table preparing vegetables, her back turned to him, it is his Aunt Marie Kessler (Kate Burton) whom he seems happy, but surprised, to see. Juliette states Aunt Marie was here when she got home and asks if Nick knew she was coming. Aunt Marie says she meant to call but that sometimes she forgets things and assumes she has done them. During a welcome hug Marie whispers to Nick ""We need to talk"".

Nick and Marie walk along the darkened street and discuss how long Marie has left to live, ""2 mths, 2 wks or 2 days, nobody knows"" she states. Marie says she has things to tell Nick about his family and then asks if he has been seeing strange things. Without being specific she comments that things are happening too fast, faster than she expected and that the family legacy is passing to him. That if he loves Juliette he must leave her as it is far too dangerous for Juliette to be around him. Suddenly Maries attention is drawn to a parked car and she announces that ""He is here - Hulda"" (Danny Hernandez). A humanoid creature carrying a scythe jumps out and battle ensues. Despite her illness Marie does her best to defeat the creature however it is finally killed when Nick shoots it. The dead creature reverts to its human physique.

Nick kneels by Marie at the Kerb, she asks if the Hulda is dead and confirms that 'they' had been following her and she thought she had lost them before coming to Nicks. She takes a decorative green locket on a chain from around her neck and gives it to Nick telling him to never lose it and to guard it with his life, that 'they' would be looking for it. Before losing consciousness she tells Nick that his parents did not die in a crash but were killed.

Marie is seen on a stretcher being loaded onto an ambulance, while Juliette looks on. Nick explains the attack to Hank but does not mention that Hulda was a creature at the time. Hank leaves to run Huldas prints and make further enquiries. Nick travels in the ambulance to the hospital with Marie after saying goodbye to Juliette.

Nick sits on a chair outside Maries room sketching the face of the creature he killed before being called in by Dr Rose (Ayanna Berkshire) when Marie regains consciousness. Surrounded by machines Marie holds Nicks hand and confirms that Nick saw the Hulda in his creature form. She explains that as the creatures lose control 'we' have the ability to see what they really are. That fairytales are real and that what the brothers Grimm wrote about aren't just tales, but very real. Nick is one of the last Grimms and he is vulnerable now. She wishes she had more time but everything is in her trailer. Nick asks about his parents but does not receive any answers as Dr Rose asks him to leave while confirming that he can see his Aunt tomorrow. Walking down the hospital corridor he takes out the green locket and examines it, and discovers it is in fact a key.

Nick returns to the squad room and examines the inscribed blade of the scythe; he has flashbacks to the Hulda creature and the perp creature he had seen earlier. Hank comes in, asking if Nick has had the scythe translated and Nick confirms that it says ""Reapers of the Grimms"".

Walking down the station stairs Hank confirms that Huldas prints connect him to several violent assaults and deaths in various States; Florida, Alabama as well as Chicago. Passing them on the stairs Sgt. Wu tells Nick that Cpt. Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz) wants to see him.

Capt. Renard confirms that if Nick had to shoot anyone he picked the right one. He asks how Nick is holding up after his first shooting and advises him that after an incident of this nature he is required to speak to a Police Psychologist, and after confirming that Nick will do so tells Nick to take care of himself before leaving.

A dark misty forest, a woman in a long red silk dress runs in slow motion. It is Juliette, she stops and turns with a look of fear on her face. A close up of the Huldas face as it hisses.

Nick sits up suddenly in bed, Juliette sleeping beside him. Woken by the dream he looks out the bedroom window to the trailer.

Using a torch Nick enters the trailer and looks around seeing a table, chair and various pieces of equipment as well as books and herbs. The trailer has obviously been redesigned for storage and study rather than living in. He looks at the strange green key in his hand, obviously intent on finding the lock to which it fits. Drawings are pinned to ceiling and walls, map charts are rolled, various pieces of scientific equipment are scattered around on surrounding surfaces. Nick opens a cupboard to reveal various antiquated weapons; swords, maces, axes, bows, daggers, axes etc. some unrecognizable. He closes the cupboard then seats himself at the table where a large book lies open. He flicks through the pages which show medallion diagrams, sketches of creatures and old photographs until he comes to a picture of a 'Hag' and is reminded of the young blonde woman he saw earlier. He hears a noise and raises the torch to dazzle Juliette who has followed him down. He quickly ushers Juliette out of the trailer and when asked says he couldn't sleep and will deal with the strange trailer later. Nick explains that he was brought up by Marie after the death of his parents, from age 12. That he knew nothing about the trailer. They hear a cat and looking around see nothing, re-entering the house. They are seen from an overlooking point between the trees; a strange animal sound is heard.

Hank walks down a station corridor, talking on the phone ""This is what we're looking for; if its an exact match of the boot prints its going to be very helpful."". Nick intercepts him as he finishes the call and informs him that the DNA results of the attacker are inconclusive and that they still don't know if they are looking for man or beast. Hank shows Nick a picture of the type of boot which matches the plaster cast taken at the scene.

A pair of feet, encased in boots similar to those from the picture, below blue trousers walk down a wet sidewalk. The back of a man is shown, Blue jacket, cap and brown satchel, as he places a brown envelope in a mail box, 7122. He continues to walk down the sidewalk, passing a young girl walking in the opposite direction. The girl is wearing red hoodie, purple leggings and has a pink and purple backpack. The mailman pauses, turns, and proceeds to follow the young girl, his face remaining hidden from the view.

Nick, at the hospital, is informed by Dr Rose that Marie remains in a deep coma. She enquires if Nick knew about the scars, from knife wounds, that cover Maries body, he did not, and confirms that she was a librarian. Nick answers his phone then rushes from the room.

A suburban street where police cars are parked and officers walk around. On the porch of a house Mrs Howell ([link-=nm2365770]) sobs and explains to Sgt Wu that her daughter Robin (Sophia Mitri Schloss) was supposed to go to her grandfathers house directly after school. The grandfather (Mark Lewis) explains that she never turned up and after checking the neighbourhood decided they should alert the police. Sgt Wu turns, intercepts Nick and Hank as they arrive, and updates them. Sgt Wu says he will check out the grandfather and then hands them a photograph of Robin.

Capt. Renard briefs detectives on the case, an enlarged projected picture of Robin behind him. The projected image changes to the route she would take to the grandfathers house. The Point A to Point B route goes around a green area, with many paths, identified as Berkeley Park. Capt. Renard instructs that alternate routes should be checked and then gives a description of her clothing at which point Nick turns to look at Hank. Nick and Hank speak to Renard as the meeting adjourns and the other officers leave. They point out to Renard that the jogger also wore a red hoodie. Renard hopes that it isn't the same guy, given the type of death the student suffered.

A white van with red and blue stripes drives down a leaf covered road. Nick and Hank walk down a road and discuss Robins route. Hank points out that while Mrs Howell may have been specific about the route, children did not always follow the rules and it would be natural for a child to take the shorter, more direct, route across the park.

Nick and Hank enter the wooded park, at a route marker they split up. Nick takes the Hollyberry Trail and Hank the Mill Pond. Nick is nervous as he walks the path, turning at every sound and remembering Maries words ""You need to be careful...you're vulnerable now...this isn't a fairytale"". Hank spots a pink and purple backpack discarded and partially hidden by a large fern and calls to Nick, who rushes over. The backpack bears the initials RH, Robin Howell. Nick starts to search around as Hank reports the crime scene by phone. Nick quickly finds a boot print, and calls to Hank, then swiftly begins to follow boot prints through the overgrown wood, off-trail. Eventually he arrives at a street. A man emerges from the small house directly opposite, a yellow VW beetle parked in its drive. The man opens and removes mail from his box as three children riding bikes pass him on the sidewalk. The man turns to look after the children, his eyes turn red, his ears elongate and turn pointed as his face sprouts hair. He sniffs the air then turns and sees Nick in the wood, shows pointed uneven teeth and growls in his direction. Nick stops and stares intently before calling ""Hank, I got him!"" The man shakes off the visage and bolts for his house as first Nick and then Hank follow. Nick chases him inside, grabs and then pushes him down shouting ""Where is she? Where is she?""

Outside the house various police cars and officers are seen. Nick and Hank are in the lounge along with Sgt Wu who is searching for evidence, and finding nothing. Hank escorts Nick out onto the porch, pulling him by the arm. Hank asks what they are doing and what Nick sees about the man that no-one else does as he has no priors and is clean. The man, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) is seen sitting in the rear of a police car. Nick says he fits the profile ""he's a loner, never been married and lives across the street from the park"". Hank points out that without evidence that won't get the man into court unless he sues them. Hank walks away as Nick returns the stare of Monroe, still seated in the back of the car.

Juliette looks down from the bedroom window onto the trailer which is lit from within by a torch. Nick is seen sitting at the table flicking through pages of the large book, finally stopping at a sketch resembling Monroes creature form.

A lamp lit window, through which Monroe can be seen eating while he stands. Nick positioned opposite stares intently. Nick receives a call from Juliette which he ignores when he sees Monroe exiting the house and walking to the rear of the property where he relieves himself at various points along the fence. Nick, having followed, watches him from the opposite side of the building. Monroe turns slightly and sniffs the air before returning to the house. Nick turns to retrace his foot steps, the lights go off inside the house. Nick sneaks below the window. The glass smashes as Monroe in his creature form attacks Nick, stands, and then tells him he ""shouldn't have come back"" before shaking his head and reverting to human appearance. Nick starts to reach for something at his side, before Monroe good naturedly tells Nick to ""lighten up, I'm just making a point"" and then proceeds to invite Nick in for a brew while telling him he is paying for the broken window. Monroe then turns away, leaving Nick to follow.

Inside the house Monroe passes Nick a bottle of beer while commenting, and peering closely into Nicks face. that he had ""never thought to see one of you before..a Grimm. Well whatd'ya know"". Nick is surprised and asks for further information. Monroe tells of how he was scared, as a kid, by stories told to him by his mother of the Grimms. Then wonders aloud how long Nick has been at this as he seems 'kinda new to it'. When Nick asks what he knows the man says that someone in Nicks family must have just died which would explain it. Nick mentions the comatose Marie Kessler and Monroe looks serious having heard of her and then turns away saying he doesn't want any trouble, that he is a Blutbad, but hasn't killed in years. A Blutbad being the big bad wolf. Monroe knows about the books as do all the Wessen or creatures, the Grimms having been profiling the Wessen for over 200 yrs. He stays good through a strict regimen of diet, drugs and palates. He is a ""reformed Blutbad, a weiner Blutbad, a different church altogether."". Monroe informs Nick that he can't stop from being a Grimm, it is who he is. Nick explains that the only reason he is at Monroes is because he is still looking for Robin, and Monroe tells Nick he is not aware of where she is. That Blutbaden (pl.) don't socialize much; as bad things happen when a pack gets together, especially when they see the colour red. That he is a clockmaker and he was marking his territory when pissing against the fence. Nick elicits the information that Monroe knows of other Blutbaden in the area, that he knows who took Robin and that Monroe had better help him find her. Monroe warns Nick not to threaten him but maintains his control when Nick physically pushes and holds him against a wall.

A dark river flows beneath a wooden bridge in a forest. A VW Campervan is seen driving across the bridge before stopping in front of a small solitary cottage covered in moss, a light glows on the porch. The driver gets out, it is the postman. Going to the rear of the campervan he removes a large sack which he carries into the cottage, the whimpering of a child is heard. Inside the cottage the postman passes a shelf on which stands the Hummel figurine of the little girl. The postman places the sack on the floor, it wriggles, he moves a coffee table, lifts the rug and opens a trap door hidden beneath. His feet and lower legs are seen as they descend some well worn wooden steps. He empties the sack onto a pretty, linen covered, four-poster bed. Robin tumbles from the sack and then quickly scoots to the head of the bed, her arms wrapped around her knees. The postmans face is now seen (Tim Bagley), an average middle aged and harmless looking man. Robin asks to go home and the postman tells her she is home and offers to take and hang up her hoodie. Frightened Robin lets him, and he is seen placing it on a hanger in a small wardrobe where several similar red hoodies hang. He asks if Robin would like a chicken pot pie, to which she shakes her head as a negative, before he runs up the stairs and slams the trapdoor shut, leaving Robin rocking back and forth in the light of a bedside lamp.

A Yellow VW Beetle is seen driving erratically and at speed along a darkened forest track. Monroe, driving, hangs partially out the window as he casts around for the postmans scent. Nick offers to drive but Monroe continues on. Monroe tells Nick that if the Blutbad had fed the day before then he is good for a week, maybe 10 days tops, giving him time to fatten Robin up. Monroe suddenly picks up the scent and says they are really close, and re-seats himself within the vehicle.

Inside the cottage the postman looks closely at his boots, covered in mud. He looks around, stands and moves off screen.

The Beetle is seen to stop in the middle of the wooden bridge, above the river, a Dead End sign caught in its headlights. Monroe removes the keys and indicates that this is as far as they can go by car, before both he and Nick get out. Monroe brings out a packet of wolfsbane which he proceeds to smear on his clothing indicating that Nick should do the same if he wants to stay alive. Nick starts to head the rest of the way across the bridge but Monroe calls him back and heads in the opposite direction, they must go a less obvious route. They go down the bank into the river and then walk closer to the cottage. Monroe starts to change into his Blutbad visage but fights it. On seeing the cottage Monroe changes fully, but again is able to maintain his control and revert back to his human physique. He tells Nick that he cannot go any further as he can't guarantee what will happen, he could be on Nicks side but on the other hand he could join with the other Blutbad or even go after the girl. Monroe then leaves returning back the way they came. Nick remains and looks toward the cottage.

Hank is awoken by his phone ringing. Nick informs him he has found the girl.

The postman is seen standing in front of a roaring fire before turning, sniffing the air, and making his way to the window where he looks out onto the dark moonlit forest. A knocking sound is heard, and looking toward the coffee table the postman sees the vase of flowers moving. The postman opens the trapdoor to see Robin who asks to go home and he again tells her that she is home before slamming the trapdoor shut.

Nick stands on the bridge by the Dead End sign as Hank arrives in his car and gets out. There is no sign of Monroes vehicle. After telling Hank where the cottage is Nick smears Hank with wolfsbane and tells him it is so he won't be smelled. Hank tells him they aren't hunting deer and asks about their backup. Nick admits that he, Hank, is the only one he called. Having already cried wolf once he doesn't believe anyone will take him seriously. Nick takes Hank via the same route he was shown by Monroe, down the bank and across the stream. Nick is vague with information when asked by Hank how he found the place, saying it was something to do with the boots, this was one of the addresses and that he has forgotten the owners name. They come to the edge of the woods and view the well lit cottage, with its now smoking chimney. Nick is still waiting for details on the vehicles plates. Hank tells him he better not be wrong this time, and Nick asks for his trust.

Inside the extremely neat and tidy cottage the postman is seen replacing the rug and coffee table. Standing up he sniffs the air and turns in the direction of the door. Nicks hand is seen using the knocker. The postman opens the door and greets them asking if he can help them. Hank and Nick look down at the mocassin type slippers on the postmans feet, then Hank introduces them and asks if the postman has a few minutes. The postman invites them in and they enter the lounge and look around. Hank picks up a cushion and the postman admits to having done the needlepoint himself. A kitchen timer rings and the postman excuses himself so he can go and remove a pot pie from the oven, before they talk. The postman appears so harmless and unimposing that Hank finds it hard to comprehend that Nick can be serious in believing he is guilty. Nick confirms he does.

Hank follows the postman into the kitchen trailed by Nick. The postman is seen taking the pie out of the oven then placing it on the counter and taking a deep sniff, his eyes momentarily turning blood red. He turns to the pair with a smile and apologizes for taking so long. Hank asks what the postman does and then what he was doing when Robin went missing. He tells them he was on his round and asks why they are asking. Nick shows him a picture of Robin and the postman expresses false dismay at hearing what has happened and hopes they don't believe he had anything to do with it. Hank says they have to explore every possibility, the boots being the main one, and the postman gives them permission to search anywhere they want, the boots having been destroyed on the fire.

Nick is seen opening the wardrobe of the bedroom, he looks at the clothes neatly folded and the shoes on their racks. There are no boots of any type. From the doorway Hank tells Nick that if the postman had anything to hide he would have kicked them out, that he is leaving as he wants to keep his job. To the sounds of the postmans humming Nick follows Hank out the bedroom, down a short hall to the lounge where the postman asks if he can offer any further help. Hank leaves as does Nick, after a final backward glance toward the postman.

Outside Nick follows an angry Hank, apologizing as he does so, because he truly believed he was correct, he is quickly cut off by Hank as he swiftly turns round to face Nick. ""The song. He was humming the same song"". says Hank ""The one on the dead girls iPod"". They both turn to see they are being observed from the window by the postman, who suddenly turns away out of sight. The lights in the cabin are suddenly extinguished. Nick and Hank rush toward the door.

Entering the doorway, with weapons drawn, the two detectives quickly fan out and use torches to look for the postman. Hank is knocked over by the postman who then proceeds to attack Nick in his Blutbad form, unseen by Hank, before making his escape through the open cottage door. Hank having recovered shoots the postman four times in the back. The Blutbad is seen falling to the ground, once again changing into the form of the human postman. Nick turns him over and asks ""Where is she? Where is she?"" to which the postmans final word of reply is ""Grimm"", before he dies.

Nick and Hank re-enter the cottage shouting Robins name throughout the rooms. Hank leaves to 'call it in' but goes to find the electricity breaker first. Nick looks around the lounge at the mess caused by the struggle and notices water from a toppled vase seeping through the floor boards. Squatting down he hears muffled sounds so lifts the rug to find the trap door. He opens it and calls out to Hank as he descends the stairs to find Robin bound and gagged on the bed. Nick unbinds Robin and tells her they are the police. Robin wraps her arms around Nicks neck, is hugged in return, and is told she is safe, while Hank looks on from the stairs. Nick turns to face Hank as his partner says ""I don't know how you did it, but you did."" and holsters his weapon. Nick tells Robin they are going to take her home.

Nick sits at the side of Maries hospital bed talking to her as he holds her hand. Marie, still comatose, has respirator tubes attached and lines running from her arms. Nick tells Marie that there are many things he doesn't understand and things he needs to ask her. He loves Juliette and doesn't want anything to happen to her. A doctor is seen entering the room and moving to the other side of a bed. A syringe of liquid is seen being prepared as Nick looks up and recognizes the Doctor as being the young blonde woman he saw earlier. He prevents her from administering the drug to Marie but is accidently injected with it during the struggle. Falling to the floor, into unconsciousness, Nick sees the young woman fleetingly change to the visage of the Hag as she exits the room.

The young woman is seen exiting the hospital via the employee entrance, removing her white doctors coat as she does so. Lightning flashes overhead as she gets into a black SUV driven by Capt. Renard. On hearing that the blonde was unsuccessful at killing Marie because of Nicks interference Renard says it is ""unfortunate, but we will just have to try again, and hope that Marie does not wake up first."" The car drives off down a wet street.

Marie is shown opening her eyes, as she wakes from her coma."

and then peeped through the

keyhole;

seeing nobody in the house,

she lifted the latch.



The camera pans through darkened woods, coming to rest on an extensive, palatial, wooded house all in darkness. Two figures, breathing heavily, dash across the lawn in front of the building toward the front door. The glass of the door window is smashed by an elbow allowing a hand to gain entry to unlock it. A dark haired man and a blonde woman enter with flashlights in hand. Checking the area the couple turn to their right down a passageway. The camera comes to rest on a the wooden carved animal head of the banister.

The couple, Gilda Darner (Amy Gumenick) and Rocky Babb (Alexander Mendeluk) enter an expensive and beautiful kitchen. Gilda exclaims in awe and asks ""why weren't we born rich?"" as she opens the door to the refrigerator and views the shelves stocked with various luxury foods.""Because our parents didn't have any money."" replies Rocky as he selects an expensive bottle of wine from the well stocked shelves.

Gilda and Rocky, now dressed in the house owners clothes, drink wine and joke about going on their yacht, while standing in the main lounge with a roaring fire behind them. Finally they throw their empty wine glasses into the fire. Gilda runs up the stairs laughing as Rocky follows. They emerge into a bedroom the walls and shelves decorated with frightening looking masks and primitive pottery. The couple fall onto the single bed entwined. Gilda gets up and leaves. Rocky again follows Gilda to an expensive and tastefully decorated bedroom where he falls backwards onto the bed calling out to Gilda. Gilda appears, dressed in a rich luxurious fur coat and hat. She opens the coat to reveal she has only pink underwear on beneath, before diving on top of Rocky.

The, now lit, house is shown, a carved bestial totem pole is picked out in the headlights of a vehicle. An SUV with multiple spot lights and a dead deer tied to its hood makes its way up the drive to stop before the house.

Gilda sits up in bed on hearing the vehicle arrive. Rocky cuddles her, sure she has made a mistake. Gilda insists he check from the window. Looking down from the window he spots the SUV, and they rush to get dressed and leave the house before they are discovered. Gilda indicates they should go out the window rather than use the staircase and proceeds onto a small balcony, over the rail to land in a heap on the ground. As Gilda tells Rocky to ""hurry up"", he is suddenly pulled backwards into the room while Gilda looks on. Sounds of fighting and cries of pain are heard as shadows of a fight are seen on the bedroom ceiling. The sounds of fighting and pain follow Gilda as she runs across the lawn to the pickup they arrived in. Growling animal sounds are heard and an indistinct figure chases after her. Gilda gets in the vehicle, guns the engine and races down the road away from the house.

A Doctor (Eric Schniewind), holding medical paperwork, enters a room where Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) sits on the end of an examination bed. He proceeds to tell Nick that his results show he has an enzyme in his blood stream normally associated with spider bites and that luckily he did not get a higher dose as it would have paralyzed his lungs and that should he feel unwell he should return to the hospital.

Walking down the hospital corridor Nick tells Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) that a few toxins were found in his blood and that he will be okay. They proceed to Marie Kesslers (Kate Burton) room and are informed by Dr Rose (Ayanna Berkshire) that they need to stabilize Marie as they can't afford for her to fall back into a coma and that Nick should visit again in the morning. Marie looks at Nick from her bed, her eyes closing. Capt. Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz) joins Nick as he looks into Maries room and confirms the details of the attack on Marie and Nick. Hank confirms that he has the security tapes, which are on the way to the precinct, in hopes of identifying their assailant. Cpt. Renard and Hank walk away leaving Nick to follow.

A video tape of hospital corridors and rooms is being played, split screen. Nick is seen entering his Aunt Maries room. Cpt. Renard viewing the tapes asks details of the last time Nick saw his Aunt. Nick says a couple of years and doesn't know what she has been up to. Cutting back to the video we see a young blonde woman (Claire Coffee) in a doctors white coat entering Maries room. Nick stands and confirms that she is the assailant. The woman is seen from the back so recognition is impossible and Renard leaves. Hank queries what Marie could have done to piss of so many people. They are interrupted by an officer (Rich Cashin) informing them that he has stopped a DUI on the highway who has a weird story about her boyfriend being attacked. Her name is Gilda Darner. Nick and Hank scoot their seats backward so they can see the woman seated at a desk in the main squad room. Nick gives a description of what he sees to Hank ""Grown up way too fast, single parent if she has any, takes way too many chances and looks for excitement in all the wrong places."". Hank and Nick then rise and approach Gilda.

Daylight, Nick and Hank, with Gilda in the back of the car draw up to the previously seen house, Gilda confirming it is the correct one. A squad car is parked, the two officers standing on the porch. The pair are met by Sgt Wu (Reggie Lee) who advances from the porch asking what they are doing there as he had not called it in yet. He gives details of a breaking and entering, reported by the house owners Mr and Mrs Rabe who had returned from Seattle 2 hours previously. The fridge was raided, wine drunk, clothes worn and a couple of beds tested. There are no signs of violence; no blood and no body parts. Hank, Nick and Wu walk around the house to the door with the broken window while telling Wu they are trying to confirm how much of Gildas story is true. They agree she is ""copping to the B&E"" so some of the story is.

Upstairs Diane Rabe {Jodie Harwood) and her husband Frank Rabe (Currie Graham) confirm someone having slept in their bed, that they have an alarm system but have been lax in using it due to the house being somewhat remote and never having had a problem before. Looking out the window Nick notices some scratch marks on the inner window frame when Wu tells him he should see the living room.

Nick examines a coffee table in the lounge; scattered food and empty bottles litter its surface. Frank confirms that they haven't had a chance to check for any thefts, although nothing obvious has been taken. Hank comments on and shows knowledge of the couples collection of rare and expensive aboriginal art, including glass covered weapons. He points out one item he has never encountered before, a paw shaped weapon with bone claws, leather wrapped grip and carved bear shape at the end, which Diane explains as ""Germanic, very rare, dating from circa 900 AD"". She further explains that they are ""members of organizations which protect native lands from development. There is a lot of rich cultural heritage disappearing and we are trying to protect what's left both locally and globally."" She is interrupted by Frank who believes that they are getting sidetracked. Diane agrees but says the you have to respect your ancestors, to which Hank agrees. Nick during this time has been looking around the other various tribal masks and statues on display in the room finally taking a closer, extended, look at the clawed club, during which he confirms who else had access to the house while they were away; cleaning crew, son Barry who was staying with friends and some neighbours who check on their house when they are away.

Leaving the house Hank tells Nick his second wife was an anthropologist. Gilda watches from the back of the car as they approach. They agree two people were in the house but there is no sign of Gildas boyfriend, who Hank believes is probably at home sleeping it off.

A darkened cave. A fire burning, the light flickers off the walls. Rocky is shown tied up with a blindfold on at the back of the cave. Growling animal sounds can be heard. A heavily furred creature approaches Rocky, scratches his cheek with its claws then sniffs his face. The screen darkens and scream is heard.

Back at the station and Nick and Hank question Gilda about the events of the night before, going over her statement of events. Gilda cries as she admits it is her fault, that she left him (Rocky) there and that she should have gone back for him. She begs Nick to do something. Sgt Wu taps on the glass of the interview room beckoning Hank who then leaves. Nick offers Gilda a handkerchief and takes the opportunity, during Hanks absence, to ask Gilda about the animal chasing her the previous night. She has no idea, she was scared and just wanted to escape so took no time to look around at her pursuer. Nick looks on as she continues to cry, and tells him she knows something terrible happened to Rocky.

On the station stairs Nick joins Hank and Wu. Rocky is not at home and his father, a truck driver, hasn't seen him since he arrived home two days ago. Rocky no longer has a cell phone, as they were cutting back on expenses. The father says that find his pickup and that is where the son will be. Nick confirms the vehicle has been impounded as Gilda was driving it when she was arrested. Wu leaves after telling them that is all the information he has on Rocky. Hank theorizes that possibly the party got out of hand...Rocky got hurt...he fell down the stairs or Gilda pushed him...he broke his neck...Gilda got scared...pushed his body in a river or the woods and now she is trying to make out she is innocent. Nick doesn't agree with Hanks scenario and believes Gilda is not trying to cover up but is pushing them to find him. Nick believes they should take another look at the house they broke into. Nicks phone rings and it is Marie who tells Nick that she needs to see him now.

Dr Rose tells Nick that Marie is very weak and that she may not have much time left. Two police officers guard Maries room as Nick enters, sits and takes her hand. He says how afraid he was that he had nearly lost her as she is the only family he has left, to which Marie replies Not yet. She tries to reassure Nick that he will be alright despite the confusion he feels with everything that is happening to him and the things he sees. She tells him to be strong and not doubt himself. That he has a responsibility that he cannot ignore to ""hunt down the bad ones"" as his ancestors did before him. She tells him the Reapers followed her here and that there could be more, their numbers are unknown. The Reapers are a secret organization dedicated to killing the Grimms. Nick now knows that he is not the only Grimm in the world however Marie does not have contact with them. Marie warns that there are more creatures in the books than she has ever seen and that he must keep the trailer a secret as they don't know about it. Dr Rose rushes in and asks Nick to leave as Marie show signs of agonizing pain.

In the hospital car park Hank asks after Marie to be told that ""Shes dying of cancer and had two attempts made on her life, apart from that she is doing alright."" They get in the car and Hank comments that she is a tough old lady. Nick then enquires about the Rabe residence. Hank informs him that their house sits on 200 acres and backs up onto a national forest which is 500 miles of trees behind them and lots of places for Rocky to get lost. Hank starts the car.

The car Nick and Hank are travelling in drives a meandering, forested, road. Suddenly three off-road motorcycles crash out of the woods onto the road in front of them. Hank punches the breaks then eases on down the road as the motorcyclists perform wheelies in front of them. Eventually everyone parks outside the Rabe residence. Nick and Hank approach the tree youths on the bikes, criticizing their driving and pointing out that they could have caused an accident. The youths turns out to be Barry Rabe (Parker Bagley), Jason Colbert (Robbie Clark) and T.B. Colbert (Ethan Atkinson). Hank shows the boys pictures of Gilda and Rocky but they deny ever having seen them, even in school. Diane Rabe then calls the boys in for Dinner and tells them to go and wash up. Diane then asks Hank and Nick if they have found out who broke into her house. Nick confirms that they have and Diane calls Frank out. Hank passes Diane the photos, as Frank arrives, and they both look at the images but deny ever having seen Gilda or Rocky. Nick then enquires of Barry if he happened to come home last night, to which Diane replies that he was staying over at Jason and TBs house. Hank tells her they have to ask just in case he saw the boy (Rocky) leave. Barry tells them that he didn't get back until this morning after his parents arrived back. Suddenly his face morphs into a thickly haired creature similar to a bear, then quickly changes back to human. Nick gulps on viewing the change. Frank Rabe notices Nicks sudden apprehension. Hank asks where the Colberts live and is swiftly interrupted by Frank asking why they need to know, and the reason for their questions. Nick tells him that they are trying to figure out where everyone was the previous night. Hank telling them that they know the two in the pictures broke into the house but that no-one had seen Rocky since. Nick gives them an account of Rockys last minutes and Diane interjects that rather than believe Gildas story Nick and Hank should remember that she and her family are the victims. Diane then ushers the boys into the house. Frank tells Nick and hank that if they want to speak to him they can call him at his law firm, before he turns and enters the house. Hank comments that they really hit a nerve with their questioning. Frank is seen peering out at them as they stand by their car. Nick tells Hank they should run down some phone records so that they can pin down where everyone was the previous night. Hank gets in the car while Nick stares at the bestial totem pole.

A blonde woman approaches an SUV which is parked below a freeway. Standing by the driver window Cpt. Renard tells her that Marie has awakened from her coma, and that she now has police guards. The woman (Claire Coffee) asks Renard what he wants her to do about the situation. Renard says that ""We cant allow her (Marie) to tell him(Nick) anything more, we need him with us."". Renard instructs the woman not to take care of it personally but to find the right people (human) to do the job of getting rid of Marie, as they can't take the chance of the excitement blowing the attackers cover should they change in front of Marie. Suddenly a young thug (Jake Street) bangs a metal bar on a trash can and asks the woman and Renard if they know that this is a bad neighbourhood asking how much they will pay not to get hurt. The woman turns to him with a smile and tells Renard she will take care of this situation, as she proceeds toward the thug. The womans face changes into that of a Hag and screams are heard from the thug after she has walked off screen and Renard looks on.

At home Nick is looking at Animal Totem Poles and figures on his computer screen as Juliette calls his name. She has brought home Chinese food and voodoo doughnuts. She admonishes him when he tries to take one as they are for dessert. Looking at the computer screen Juliette asks if they are buying a totem pole. Nick tells her he was just curious having seen one outside the house of a case he is working on. Juliette proceeds to read from the screen, as Nick brushes hair from her face ""Some kind of clan of the bear. The bear is the messenger to the supernatural world, his position of dominance in the totemic hierarchy is the result of a common ancestorial belief in the sanctity of their territory."" Juliette discusses her visit to the hospital to see Marie, the police guards and that she can't even die in peace. She asks how Nick is doing but isn't convinced by his happy manner.

Barry, Jason and TB enter the clearing of a densely wooded area. TB and Jason carry flaming wood torches; a clothed body appears to be slung over Barrys shoulder. Barry throws the body forward and it is seen to be a clothed mock-up now impaled on sharp wooden stakes within a dug out pit.

Nick is seen sitting at the trailer table, sketching the figure at the top of the Rabes totem pole. The door to the trailer opens and Marie enters, still wearing her hospital gown as Nicks look on in disbelief. She moves to the table and gazes down at the sketch and comments A bit more red. She moves to a cupboard containing various antiquated weaponry; swords, axes, daggers etc. and takes out dagger. Moving to the table she says ""When the sun goes down."" then stabs Nick through the left had pinning him to the table.

Nick sits up in bed with a gasp, having awoken from the dream. Juliette asks if he is okay. He responds by telling her it was just a bad dream and then continues with the details. Looking at his hand there is no sign of injury. Juliette says even she couldn't interpret that dream. She is leaving early for work as she has a Bulldog to operate on at 7 am.

Nick enters the trailer then turns to look around and examine some of the strange items on display. He opens the weapon cupboard and removes a paw shaped weapon similar to the one he had seen at the Rabe residence. He hears Maries words ""You have to hunt down the bad ones."" then has a flash of Barrys morphing face.

Eddie Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) is seen using an exercise machine. He hears a knock at his door and turns to look at a clock; 6.28 am. He resumes his exercise but the door is knocked again and he gets up to answer it with a sigh. Nick is standing on the doorstep. He tells Monroe they have to talk to which Monroe replies ""Not at 6.30 in the morning we don't."" and then tries to close the door. Nick forces his way in a brown bag held in his arms. Monroe makes some sarcastic remarks about coffee, bagels etc. Nick thanks him for his help on his previous case which involved a Blutbad, and hands him the bag asking if he has ever seen the item it contains, the paw weapon. He tells Nick that he hasn't seen one up close as Jägerbars use them for disembowelling. Nick asks Monroe if he has any information on Jägerbars. Monroe does not take kindly to Nick comparing Blutbaden, of which he is one, with Jägerbars. Nick explains that the weapon belongs to Marie at which point Monroe tells Nick he has had nothing but nightmares for the last two nights thinking Marie was coming to cut off his head. Nick tells him Marie is still in the hospital. Monroe then goes on to tell Nick about the weapon; it is used in the roh-hatz which is a form of bar mitzvah for Jägerbar involving a lot of pounding of chests and wailing which is supposed to connect with the primitive beast in everyone including humans. Monroe mentions a chase which involves camping out etc. at which point Nick leaves in a hurry.

Sitting beside Maries bed Nick is seen sketching the head of a Jägerbar. Marie in the bed behind him wears an oxygen mask. Marie recognizes the drawing as a Jägerbar and asks if Nick has seen one. Nick confirms that he has met a family but that the boy, Barry, is the only one he saw transform. Marie asks the boys age and is told he is 18. Marie says that it could be a problem if they are traditional and asks if anyone died. Nick tells her there is no death but he has got a missing person. She tells him that the roh-hatz is a right of passage, from boy to man, and that it isn't pretty and occurs at sunset.

Nick enters the squad room where Hank informs him they have the phone records and have triangulated several of them including those of Barry Rabe which puts him at the family home at 11.30 pm on the night that Rocky went missing. Barry is therefore lying and dad as a lawyer is running interference. Cpt. Renard then approaches and tells Nick that he had to remove the police guarding Marie at the hospital as he couldn't prove the second attack so wasn't able to justify the expense to the chief etc.

Monroe is seen repairing a clock when his phone rings and he hesitantly answers it and asks Now what?.

At the hospital Monroe tells Nick that he must be out of his mind asking him to guard a Grimm given that he is a Blutbad. Nick tells him it is only for a short period until he can figure something else out. After a little arguing Monroe finally agrees to help although he is not a cop and he was stupid to ever speak to Nick. Nick tells Monroe that he trusts him. After leaving Monroe says quietly that ""maybe he shouldn't.""

Hank calls Nick to let him know that Gilda had made bail, went over to Rockys dads house, took a gun and told the father that she would get Rocky back or kill the people who took him.

Gilda drives up to the Rabe residence, gets out and threatens Diane with the gun asking where Rocky is. Diane says she knows nothing about Rocky and pleads with Gilda not to hurt her. Suddenly Barry in his Jägerbar form attacks and disables Gilda. Diane then says ""Well done son. Hunting two is better than one, you make your ancestors proud."" She then moves over and kicks Gilda in the head as she starts to regain consciousness while Instructing Barry to get rid of her pickup.

Frank arrives home and greets his wife who is pruning roses. She tells him that Barry is out with friends, riding their bikes. Nick and Hank arrive and inform Frank and Diane that Gilda is on her way to their house with a gun. Looking around Hank determines that she hasn't arrived yet and on the way to the car tells them he will block off the road in case she arrives. Nick then tells Diane and Frank that they need to talk now as he knows what they are and they know what he is. Frank says that he knows that Nick is a Grimm and a danger to his family, that wearing a badge won't protect him. Nick tells him that it isn't about his being a Grimm and then goes on to look at Diane and say he knows about the hunt, Frank wonders what he is talking about. And exclaims that no-one does the roh-hatz any more looking at Diane in with genuine disbelief. Looking at his wife Frank suddenly realizes that what Nick is saying is the truth. He asks Diane where the boys are, but she refuses to answer instead telling Frank to ask to see Nicks Warrant before walking off into the house. Frank exclaims that he had no idea. Nick invites Frank to help him find them before it is too late to which Frank agrees exclaiming that they will need to take his 4 wheeler. Both men head off as Diane watches from the doorway. In the vehicle Frank asks Nick not to hurt the boys should they find them. Nick tells him he won't if he doesn't have to.

Frank is seen blocking the road and requesting backup. He notices a grassed lane and walks down to investigate and finding Gildas hidden Vehicle. A call from Nick and he confirms that Gilda has already arrived. Nick tells him he is with Frank and they are going to get the boys.

Inside the cave Gilda is heard sobbing. Both she and Rocky are bound and blindfolded. The three bare chested and tattooed boys drag Rocky to his feet and tear off his t-shirt. Barry cuts his own arm and smears the blood on Rockys face. Rocky begs them to let Gilda go. The boys inform him that they will, and she will even be given a head start as will he.

Monroe paces outside Maries room, finally entering. He speaks to her apparently unconscious face telling her that his family would never forgive him if they found out he was this close to her and didn't avenge his family, some of whom had been killed by Grimms for admittedly legitimate reasons. Marie opens her eyes and tells him to take his best shot at which time Monroes eyes turn to blood red as he stares at her. He then turns to the room entrance and sees a thuggish man (Keith Cox) approaching who suddenly veers away. Monroe follows him as Marie looks on.

Frank and Nick stop the vehicle in the woods having to take a foot trail. Frank admits he can't guarantee the boys will be where he thinks they are.

Monroe follows the thug through a doorway in a boiler room. The thug steps out from behind a pillar an attacks him. Standing up Monroe is grabbed from behind, his arms pinned to his sides. A second thug (J.J. Morris) starts to lay into him and Monroe falls to the floor with the thugs continue to kick him. Temper raised Monroe turns into his Blutbad form, grabs the larger thug and raises him above his head to impact large pipes attached to the ceiling. The smaller thug brings out a gun and Monroe grabs and slams him into a pillar before grabbing his right arm and tearing the limb off at the shoulder. Monroe then reverts to his human form. Looking down on the thugs he admits ""That went a little too far."" before turning and running from the scene.

Nick and Frank enter the now empty cave. Frank picks up Rockys t-shirt, sniffs it and turns into his Jägerbar form and telling Nick that it (roh-hatz) has already started. Nick who had drawn his weapon as Frank changed watches as Frank follows Rockys scent out of the cave. Nick gives chase.

Gilda and Rocky are seen running through the forest, a roaring Jägerbar a short distance behind them, followed by a second. They come to a sudden stop as another Jägerbar appears ahead of them. Nick crashes out of the undergrowth between them. Repelling the attack of 2 of the Jägerbars, before raising his weapon and shooting into the air. He levels his gun at the remaining Jägerbar who carries a paw weapon and tells him ""This isn't going to get any better unless you stop."" The final Jägerbar reverts to the form of Barry and is intercepted by his father, now in human form, who tells them the hunt is over and it all stops now. Barry suddenly moves forward shouting ""No. Mom. Dont!"" Nick turns in time to see a large brown bear charging at him from the opposite direction. The bear jumps over a log, lands and disappears. Sounds of animal pain are heard. Walking over to the pit the boys had earlier dug they see the bear turning into Dianes human form, her body speared by sharpened stake.

Diane is seen being stretchered to an ambulance. Barry in handcuffs apologizes to her and is told he did no wrong. Frank disagrees and tells her that their son did do wrong and now they are all going to pay for it. She replies by saying you have to respect your ancestors. ""Not like this."" says Frank. Barry is placed in the rear seat of a squad car beside Jason and TB as Frank explains to Nick that Diane just wanted the boys to know their heritage.

Nick receives a call from Monroe, who shows signs of the beating he has taken at the hands of the two thugs. He explains to Nick that he protected Marie but may have gone too far. He turns into the wall as a wheeled stretcher containing the thug whose limb he tore off goes by, a wheeled box containing the severed limb follows. He tells Nick he can't stay around the hospital given what he has done and that Nick needs to return quickly as he can't be sure he got all of them.

Nick makes his way to the hospital.

A priest (Matt Baker) walks down the corridor toward Maries room, a scalpel held in his hand. On entering he draws the curtains around her bed and then leans over her with the intention of cutting her throat. Maries eyes open and she grabs his arm and forces him backwards are she jumps out of bed and they both crash through the curtains and tussle in the corridor. Marie gains the upper hand turning the scalpel in the priests hand and forcing it into his chest. Nick arrives in time to catch Marie before she collapses. Marie tells Nick ""Remember who you are and trust your instincts and nothing else."" before she dies.

Nick drives from the house with the trailer attached as Juliette looks on from the window.

Kneeling by a grave, Nick lays a bunch of flowers. Juliette asks if he is okay and he replies ""No, but it will be."" they both walk away from the grave as they are spied upon by a creature hidden in the surrounding bushes, its shape indistinct.

A view is shown of the grave Marker:

PORTLAND

The camera pans over a river and bridge then cuts to a scene of an electric tram, its doors opening as it comes to a standstill. The lower legs and feet of a woman are shown, wearing black patent stiletto heels with red soles. The woman, now seen to have long dark hair and wearing a black suit, joins the queue and gets on the tram.

The pretty young woman holds onto a grab strap as a young clean shaven male traveller passes by, a large long green canvas bag clutched to him. Sitting the woman looks toward the young man and sees him looking around the tram. The young man then nods, in the womans direction, and she quickly turns to see a bearded man, wearing glasses, acknowledge the nod with one of his own. The young man then reaches down and begins to open the top of his bag and takes out a large boom box. Held in the air the song 'YMCA by the Village People' is blasted out. The people in the carriage begin to sing along and do the actions, the young woman smiles as a look of relief passes over her face. The tram driver (Wrick Jones) is shown, muttering something unintelligible. The smile quickly disappears from the womans face as she is jostled by her fellow travellers, when she stands to make exit from the vehicle. The tram stops and the revellers disembark quickly laughing and high fiving as they all leave.

The tram driver having turned to watch everyone disembark then rises from his seat and makes his way down the passageway shouting ""Miss"". The camera viewpoint changes to reveal a body lying on the floor with the upper half obscured by a seat. The corpse is recognizable as being that of the young woman by the black patent heels with red soles.

Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) walk toward a now taped off area around the tram. They discuss the sudden death, assuming that the young woman was part of the flash mob, and that it was ""a crappy way to go"". Sgt Wu (Reggie Lee) identifies the young woman as ""Serena Dunbrook"" (Mary Ann Jarou) ""aged 34"" who was on her way to work, as a lawyer for Berman, Rautbort & Associates. Wu then passes Nick Serenas Drivers license, which he obtained from her purse. Nick looks at the picture and makes comment only to be told by Wu that is ""what she used to look like"". Wu leans down and removes the sheet from the victim. Serenas face is revealed, a grotesque transformation of her pretty features having taken place. The face is swollen, eyes wide open and protruding and the skin has an unhealthy and discoloured mottled effect. Nick , kneeling, looks at her features intently.

Wu says that, although unofficial, they believe that Serena has died of anaphylactic shock. Hank finds it hard to believe that ""one little bee sting"" could have killed her. Still examining the body Nick says that they should get the ME to check her medical records to see if there is anything in them to indicate any severe allergies. He also points out that as yet they cannot be sure that that it was an accident, while Wu makes a tasteless joke about it being a killer bee as well as telling them that it is just a waste of their time. Hank reminds them of a dog which was attacked in Cathedral Park by a swarm of bees the previous week. Wu, unconvinced, decides to bet them $20 dollars that there is no foul play involved, a bet that Nick takes as he exposes the victims neck to show them a large puncture wound just below the left ear which was made by something larger than a bee stinger.

Dr Harper (Sharon Sachs), Nick and Hank enter a hospital examination room. Harper confirms that Serena died of Anaphylactic shock, from bee venom. She informs Nick and Hank that she has sent a sample away to a local Apiarist, Bee Keeper, for further analysis. Nick asks about the wound and Harper admits that she doesnt know what caused the wound as it is too big for even the largest syringe. The medical records do not show any record of an allergy, however given the amount of venom, 50mg, in her system it was unsurprising that Serena died as that of a normal bee sting would only be 0.1mg. Nick and Hank then run through a scenario of the chain of events leading to the death which was committed by an unknown person injecting Serena with the venom. Harper confirms that it is a homicide.

CCTV images play on a computer screen: HILLSBORO *226/07:13. The screen shows passengers inside the tram, Serena entering and moving out of view as everyone suddenly does the YMCA hand gestures. Nick instructs WU to get it on the news in the hope of witnesses coming forward. Rising to leave Nick and Hank are intercepted by Capt. Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz) who tells them that he wants their full attention on the case as he doesnt want the city population to fear travelling on public transport. He confirms with the pair that it wasn't a random killing.

Nick and Hank are in a large office contained within the Berman, Rautbort & Associates building where they interview Harrison Rautbort (Shelly Lipkin) and Camilla Gotlieb (Linn Bjornland). Both confirm that she was a good lawyer and a nice person with no known boyfriend. Nick and Hank enquire if she had any enemies or if the cases she was working on could have contributed to her death. Harrison does not think so but offers them full access to case files which he will message over to their office for them to check out. Camilla is tearful throughout the interview and says that Selena took her under her wing. On leaving the office Hank checks his cell phone and says ""Harpers Bee man just buzzed me."". A look from Nick and he says ""Yeah, I went there.""

Blue flowers in a garden with bees buzzing around happily as they feed on the nectar. Hank and Nick are seen examining empty bee hives and other paraphernalia. A bee lands on Nicks hand and Prof. Elliot Spinella (Michael J. Prosser) tells them that it is a Queen and that she must like Nick as she is fiercely protective of her nest and almost never shows herself. Spinella clothed in protective gear then removes the bee from Nick and places her back in her hive, thereafter removing his bee hood. Nick asks if he has had any luck analyzing the toxin Harper had sent over. Spinella confirms that he did and that it is not synthetic but naturally occurring, that it must have been harvested. Spinella explains that each toxin is individual and has markers for a specific region or country, however in this case he is unable to specify the region due to its unusual chemical balance which he has never seen before and therefore has no known origin. He also tells them that if they were considering him as a suspect he does not have the equipment to harvest that amount of toxin and that he has an alibi for the time of murder with 11 witnesses.

Back at the station Wu informs them that their appeal for witnesses from the flash mob has paid off, as they turn a corner and make their way through a group of people, he confirms that 22 people have so far come forward. Wu also lets them know that Renard is taking a keen interest in the case. Hank asks Wu to check out Professor Spinellas alibi while he and Nick interview the flash mob witnesses. Each of the witnesses #1 (Michelle Danilson), #2 (Claire Doody), #3 (Austin Hillebrecht) and #4 (Marzell Sampson) confirms that they received a tweet with the date, time and venue of the flash mob and that they did not know the other participants or who sent the tweet. No-one witnessed the murder. Nick finally interviews Doug Shellow (Rich Morris), who has placed his cell on the interview table, and asks Shellow to show him a copy of the tweet which was sent, but he is refused. Nick then asks him to repeat his version of events and trips up as the details are no longer the same as his previous statement. Nick then asks to see the tweet again and reaches for the cell. Shellows hand covers the cell before Nick can reach it and then hand and arm morph into a spike covered appendage. Nick and Shellow stare at each other before being interrupted by Hank knocking on the glass windowed door as he looks in. As Nick leaves the room we see that Shellows hand and forearm have now returned to normal. Hank informs Nick that the text was sent from a spam email address so no other details can be found of who sent it. During the conversation Nick is looking through the window at Shellow whose face morphs into that of a strange insect with large dark eyes, small antennae, sharp teeth and two small moveable mouth type parts on the chin. Nick turns in time to see another of the witnesses, John Coleman (Stephen Lange), who is seated outside the room, also morph into one of the strange insect Wesen. Nick then returns his attention to Shellow who proceeds to return to normal. Nick then confirms with Hank that he believes that Shellow is involved in the murder.

A vehicle is seen entering the gates of the Primrose Paper Mill, a sign declares that the paper mill is closed and that no trespassing is allowed. Hank and Nick drive up in time to see the car drive through into the factory grounds. They comment that this doesn't look like a place to call home as we see Shellow ascending stairs to a door in the factory building. The site of Shellows legs walking in the door clearly show the floor of the building which is strewn with small pieces of paper suitable for paper making. Nick watches from the corner of an opposite building and it becomes clear that Nick and Hank had been following Shellows vehicle. Nick and Hank make their way down the rubbish strewn road to the doorway while discussing the Primrose Paper Mills history as having been a family business and being there forever. The pair enter the building where they see, from a hidden position,Shellow and Coleman talking before being joined by a woman whose face is hidden from their view. A bee suddenly lands on a wire in front of them and is quickly joined by the full swarm which proceeds to chase them. The noise of the bees as well as the sounds Nick and Hank make while retreating from the bees alerts the three conspirators to their presence causing them to scatter and make a hurried escape. Nick and Hank dash through the factory until they find an isolated office which they lock themselves inside. The swarm of bees covering the windows and door as they try to block any entrance points. The bees disappear as quickly as they arrived and Nick and Hank leave the safety of the office. Once again walking through the factory Hank comments on the coincidence of Selenas death by bee venom and that they have been swarmed. Nick says he doesn't think it is a coincidence as the bees have completely disappeared. Nick hurries Hank out of the building on the premise of finding his partner help for his bee stings having noticed white footmarks on the ground belonging to the three conspirators.

Back at Nick and Juliette Silvetons (Elizabeth Tulloch) home. Juliete applies a stick cream to Hanks wounds. Nick enters the room with two beers and a water for Hank. Juliette explains that bees normally have to be provoked before they sting and enquires as to whether Hank kicked their hive or something. Hank says no and then Juliette continues to explain that bees are highly effective communicators with the scout flying around until they find the perfect flower when they buzz back to the hive and communicate with the colony to follow them. Nick tells Hank that he has put out an APB for Shellow and Coleman as they are the best bet for solving the crime. John and Doug reporting to her shows a connection to Serenas murder. Hank suggests taking a look at the case files Berman, Rautbort & Associates had sent them and stands to get them. Juliette disagrees telling Hank he must rest and not scratch the stings for the next eight hours as she has tranquilized him with her remedy. Nick agrees with Juliette so Hank goes home for the night. Juliette and Nick kiss as she tells him she understands that he has to work. Nick tells her he just has to do some research and that he will not be too long. Juliette walks away, hands in pocket looking slightly unhappy but resigned to the situation.

Forest Hill Storage Yard where an old fashioned silver trailer is parked up. Nick parks to the rear of the trailer, gets out and enters it. Nick is viewed through the skylight sitting at a desk poring over a large book containing hand drawn images and text. A bee is seen on the skylight as he does so. A closer look at the page shows the drawn image of the insect Wesen that Shellow and Coleman turn into as well as a needled weaponlike device.

BOOK INFORMATION: Mellifer Is the messenger among all. They balance the ecotone of our world. I have found that we should treat a Mellifer with respect for they pose no threat to a Grimm.

The stinger is used as a weapon of self defence by the Mellifers. I have witnessed it used on Hexenbiests.

Nick turns the page of the book and sees a picture of a Hexenbiest. His memory returns to a young woman (Claire Coffee) he had previously seen for the first time outside a jewellery store (EP1-Pilot) and later in the hospital when she was trying to kill Aunt Marie Kessler (Kate Burton) (EP2-Bears will be Bears). Her visage changing the first time to that of the one in the book, this being his first sighting of a Wesen and prior to his learning of the Grimm legacy from Aunt Marie. He reads aloud The Hexenbiest mark can be found under the tongue in both human form and morphed form. ""The drawing shows a tongue with a crescent shaped mark."" Turning another page he views another drawing, of The Mellischwuler (sp?) The Queen Bee. A drawing of a Queen Honey Bee is shown opposite. Nick takes out his cell and makes a call. He asks the other person if he/she had heard of the tram incident?

The scene changes to that of the darkened paper mill factory. A shadowed figure walks between machinery a torch lighting their way. The person suddenly turns a corner and comes into the light where we recognize him as Nick. Turning to light the area from which he just came a short sharp scream is heard as Nick turns the torch on Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), a Blutbad (werewolf) Wesen. Monroe tells Nick to calm down as he is at the factory at Nicks request. Having already been informed of the tram case by cell phone, Monroe comments that murder is not something he would expect of a Mellifer. Nick says that he read in the book that they generally only attack when defending themselves, which Monroe confirms then informs Nick that they act as the gossip section of the Wesen world. Nick tells Monroe about the bee attack on Hank and himself before bending to kneel beside the white footprints he had seen on his earlier visit. Nick then informs Monroe that he needs him not for the knowledge he may have of Mellifers but for his nose, in the hope that he can follow the scent of the two men who earlier escaped from the factory. As a bribe, when Monroe does not seem keen, Nick offers Monroe a bottle of '78 Bordeaux which he has in his car. Nick asks Monroe if Mellifers are messengers why they would then murder an innocent girl. Monroe replies that she perhaps wasn't so innocent.

Monroe moves off up some steps, sniffing the air, as he tracks the two men. Nick follows closely behind him. Monroe confirms that Mellifer have only one natural enemy The Hexenbiest. Monroe stops and tells Nick he can smell a female, 'Undeniable' being the perfume she is wearing. He then leads Nick into an office. Monroe continues to sniff around the office, seats and computer keyboard, as Nick checks a filing cabinet, and draws out a file telling Monroe the woman is Melissa Wincroft (Nana Visitor). Monroe asks if Nick just 'Grimmed' that information but Nick says he got it off an envelope sitting on the desk.

Nick and Monroe walk in darkness toward the entrance of a large white, pillared, mansion. Nick tries the door while Monroe hangs back still sniffing for the females scent or perfume. Unable to gain entry they make their way to an open glass door where torch in hand Nick enters with Monroe following closely on his heels. Nick steps on something crunchy and shining the torch downward sees a multitude of dead honey bees on the floor. Hearing a strange sound they make their way to the front hall before starting to ascend the main staircase, the weird sound obviously emanating from the upper levels. Monroe stops and questions Nicks sanity in going in that direction, but nevertheless follows him. As they pass below the upper edge of the staircase we can see liquid dripping from the upper level, and they continue onward. The turn to the right and ascend a smaller workaday staircase leading to the attic with a closed door shown at the top of the stairs. Nick continues to ascend and then opens the door slowly and quietly. He shines the torch into the room and sees some large stalactite structures dripping liquid into buckets.

Morning and Police cars and officers have cordoned off the house. Inside Hank and Nick examine the structures more closely, they resemble huge honey combs. Nick says he found the house through examining Serenas Legal Files which had been sent over as promised. He confirms that Melissa Wincroft owns the property and the liquid was similar to that which killed Serena. Hank notes that it looks like she left the property suddenly without choosing to sell it or buy another. Nick tells Hank that he did not call him as he was supposed to be resting from the bee stings he suffered the previous day. Hank asks Nick to connect the dots for him. Nick explains: a messy class action suit the previous year, Serena represented a hostile company takeover of Primrose Paper Mill, the employees fought it, including Coleman and Shellow, however they lost. Melissa Wincroft was their boss, her family having operated and owned the paper plant for over a century and therefore having the most to lose. Melissa then took revenge on Serena for causing the loss of the company. Nick and Hank are interrupted by an officer who informs them that Sgt. Wu says that there has been another flash mob murder in Chapman Square.

Walking toward a cordoned off area of park Wu tells them the details of the murder: the victim doing yoga, the flash mob occurring, the victim dying in the same way Serena did. All of which was caught on an overhead camera. Shellow and Coleman were not involved as they had been arrested and where in a cell at the station at the time. Neither of them will say anything until they Lawyer up. Approaching the victim Renard is seen kneeling down looking at the swollen face of the victim. Nick and Hank confirm that they have a solid lead on the perp, Melissa Wincroft, whom they are zeroing in on. Looking down at the victim Nick recognizes her as being Camilla Gotleib, from her large gold locket, and the other lawyer involved in the Primrose Paper Mill class action suit. Renard says that they now definitely have a pattern. Nick turns, cell phone ready to use, as he comments that there was a third lawyer on the case and that they have to get to them before they are also murdered. Calling the police station he asks that Police be deployed to the Legal firm to take the third lawyer, Adalind Schade (Claire Coffee) into protective custody.

Renard, Nick and Hank walk into the captains office to speak to the third lawyer. As Adalind turns and faces the doorway Nick recognizes the woman as the one who tried to kill his Aunt Marie. He also knows her to be a Hexenbiest. Adalind does not let on that they have met before although on leaving the office and moving past Nick that she is wary and anxious. Renard noticing Nicks scrutiny asks a number of questions, in order to find out if Nick is telling more than he has said and/or to see if Nick has made Adalinds connection to himself (EP1- Pilot). Nick says he doesnt know her and so Renard finishes his questioning by telling Nick to look after Adalind as they wouldnt want a third lawyer murdered.

Nick is seen rushing into Dr Harpers autopy room and asking to see the 2 previous victims tongues. Harper removes them from the fridge and explains they were so swollen it was the only way she could examine them. On examination Nick sees the mark of the Hexenbiest on each of the tongues. Not tattoos according to Harper.

Hank and Adalind are seen viewing a screen where Melissa Wincroft (Nana Visitor) is answering questions regarding her companies earnings. She then goes on to stress that it was more than a company, it was a family that they were trying to tear down and that they are just using the case to get them out of the way. The woman says she knows who is behind it and that they are not going to get away with it. Hank then turns to Adalind and says that it sounds like a threat to him but Adalind cannot believe that she would have done it to Serena and Camilla. Nick enters the room and comments that it seemed a lot more personal than professional which Adalind refutes by stating she was just doing her job. Both make veiled comments to each other regarding their hidden identities; Grimm and Hexenbiest. After some more comments between then Hank decides to excuse both Nick and himself from the room. Walking down the hall Hank queries Nick questioning technique by treating her like a perp to which Nick replies that he does not trust her. Hank however says that all they have to do is protect her and first on the agenda is hunting down Melissa Wincroft.

The camera cuts back to Adalind as she rises and comes to the door of the interview room to speak with Renard. She lets him know Nick recognizes her from the Hospital. Renard tells her that Nick isn't letting on and that he (Renard) will protect her. Adalind says she can look after herself but that Renard had better find The Queen or she won't be the only person to get stung.

Hank comes off his cell phone to tell Nick that Melissa as no activity on a credit card, cell, travel, bank account and can not be found in the system. Nick replies that she has no known family and the only known friends she has are Shellow and Coleman. Nick points out that they do not need Melissa to get in touch with either Shellow or Coleman that all they need is for Shellow to communicate with her, by text, and they can intercept the call and track her down. Neither of them knowing that Nick and Hank are protecting Adalind Schade.

Nick enters an interview room to speak to Shellow. Nick sits down and produces Shellows cell phone explaining that he, Shellow, was about to show him some tweets. Nick lays out how much time Shellow is already due to get for conspiracy to murder and that they can put him at the murder scene. He then wants to know who he is trying to protect and if there is another victim, and drops Melissas name. Hank then rushes into the room telling Nick that Renard wants to see him urgently. Nick leaves the room and Shellow quickly picks up the cell phone Nick had left on the table. Checking that no-one is looking through the door window he then looks suspiciously at the two way mirror where Renard, Wu, Nick and Hank return his stare. Shellow begins to type then send a text/tweet which Wu intercepts via a computer. The message reads ""They don't know AS open."". Nick deciphers it as Adalind Schade being open to being murdered.

A young woman, blonde hair with a handkerchief held to her mouth alights from a yellow cab and makes her way into a modern building, closely watched by a man in a parked car. On entering the buildings Reception she ignores the security guard, when he offers a good morning, but continues to the lift. The security guard lets an unknown person know she has arrived via his radio headset. The woman then enters the lift and is quickly joined by a male traveller. On turning we realize the male is Wu and the woman is an undercover policewoman made up to look like Adalind. Wu lets Nick and Hank know that the trap has been set to catch Melissa, if she shows herself.

Putting his cell away we see that Nick, Hank and Adalind are in a hotel room. Hank reassures Adalind that all eyes are on her apartment and that this is the easiest way to flush her out. Adalind comments on the inconvenience it is to them and Nick replies somewhat acerbically that they are just doing their jobs. It is clear that after trying to kill his Aunt Marie Nick does not believe Adalind deserves the protection, but is unable to confide and legitimize his reasons to the others involved including Hank. Hank breaks the difficult situation by asking if they want room service. Hank leaves to make/get some coffee leaving Adalind and Nick in the room together. Nick then tells her he knows she is a Hexenbiest like Serena and Camilla and that she had tried to kill his aunt in the hospital, that he has seen the marks on their tongues. Despite the questioning that follows Adalind remiains silent with just the pressure of her nails in the chair fabric showing her stress. He asks why the Mellifers want her dead and she tells him to figure it out. He replies that while he doesn't like it it is his duty to protect her but that she better hope he better not have a good reason or a bad day at work as it won't save her.

A parked car within which is Melissa and Dr Spinella. He asks why Melissa involved him as he is clean and doesn't want to go to jail, morphing under stress into a Mellifer as he does so. Melissa explains that he has as much to lose as the rest of them. Melissa slides open the door of the minivan and a swarm of bees fly out.

Hank, in the kitchen, sees a bee then turns and notices a few more. Following them he sees they are entering via an open window in the bathroom.

Back in the living room Adalind tells Nick he doesn't know what he is getting himself into. Nick then taunts her by saying it would therefore be understandable if a Queen Mellifer was to kill another Hexenbiest. This causes her to lose control and morph into a Hexenbiest. Nick finally smiles at her as she fights to regain her control. She then points out that it won't be a Grimm killing a Hexenbiest but a cop letting an innocent young woman die in everyone elses eyes.

A call from Hank and Nick swiftly joins him in the bathroom. Unable to close the window Hank is fighting a losing battle with the bees. Neither he nor Nick can budge the window.

Adalind turns around in her seat the light from the window quickly being occluded.

Back in the Bathroom the bees begin to fly up and away from the window. Nick rushes through to the living room and Adalind, followed by Hank. On arriving in the room Adalinds seat is vacant, and bees cover the entirety of the outer window.

Hank and Nick rush it into the hall, there is no sign of forced entry and the lift is still on their floor. They open the door to the stairwell with Nick going down and Hank up, shouting Adalinds name as they go. Nick spots Adalind on the stairwell below him and shouts out, but she ignores him and keeps descending.

Nick reaches the basement, opens the door and is presented by swarms of bees and Melissa with a stinger in hand. She tells him she has to kill Adalind and that he doesn't understand. Nick has drawn his gun and has it aimed at Melissa as she talks. She claims they killed Serena and Camilla to protect Nick, that they closed the paper mill down so that the Mellifers couldn't pass on their message to him. Nick says that they still killed two people which Melissa refutes as they were Hexenbiests. Melissa says she has to finish it, the killing of Adalind, then turns and flees. Melissa is then seen grabbing Adalind and they both fight. Nick is unable to get a clear shot. Adalind grabs Melissas arm which morphs causing Melissa to withdraw her hand and the pain causing her to morph as well. Both woman shout things to Nick; do your job, don't listen to her, act like a Grimm etc. Nick moves closer as Hank arrives. Adalind calls out frailly, acting the innocent, to Hank for help. Nick warns Melissa to back away before he finally shoots her twice in the back. Hank helps Adalind as Melissa stumbles toward Nick in her morphed form. Melissa falls to her knees, features returning to normal and passes on a final message ""Hes coming for you...Hes close"". Melissa then dies and all the bees fall to the ground. Adalind gives him a final sneaky smile, crouched in Hanks arms.

In bed, alongside Juliette, Nick remembers something his Aunt Marie told him ""You have to hunt down the bad ones, just like your ancestors did"". Juliette turns over and snuggles to his chest before raising herself and looking in his face. She comforts him by saying that Hank said that he (Nick) did the right thing. Nick says that sometimes it isn't that simple. She tries to comfort him by saying that he made a difference to Hank and the woman he saved, without realizing that it may not have been the correct decision for these particular circumstances but is unable to say so. Juliette then says that she is cold but Nick insists on closing the window for her. He sees what looks like a queen bee which alights and crawls on his hand and then suddenly stings him. He quickly closes the window."

She is accidentally hit by a car driven by a man who is quite shaken up by the event. As he approaches the victim to check on her, another man appears and verifies that she is still breathing and instructs the driver to call 911. While he is back at his car making the call, another man the unknown man kills the woman and leaves unnoticed. Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive on the scene and, after the CSI is finished, observe that the barefooted woman has no injuries to her feet but does have glass in cuts on her arm.

A reaper comes to Portland and checks into a small hotel, the Joyce Hotel. He receives a call on his cell phone and tells the caller he will call when it's finished. He looks at a newspaper article about the death of Hulda and opens up a Scythe and Woges into a Hässlich.

The two detectives confer with Doctor Harper, the medical examiner, who tells them that the victim was murdered by asphyxiation. Using fingerprints, Hank identifies the young woman as Faith Collins. Nick and Hank interview Faith's husband, Roy Collins, who has a record of spousal abuse. Roy admits to having argued with Faith, but denies any wrongdoing. He admitted he was upset when he came home from work hungry, and Faith wouldn't get off the computer due to her ""322 friends"" online. He says she left their home but that he waited for her to return as she always does. 104 Capra Morphs Garden

Billy Capra morphing.

After conferring with Captain Renard, Nick and Hank check Faith's page on a social networking site and find a picture taken in the garden of the Bramble Haus, a bed and breakfast. They check with the owner and operator, Billy Capra, just as a young man and woman are checking out. Capra says he showed a room to Faith but that she did not stay. The detectives visit the garden where Hank inadvertently steps on and kills a toad. Capra says the toad is an endangered species and picks up the remains. Nick sees Capra woge into a creature form he does not recognize. As the detectives leave the garden, Capra eats the toad.

The reaper goes to the police station and asks to talk with the detective who shot his friend. Sergeant Wu takes the request to Renard who tells him to get the reaper's personal information and tell him that someone will get back to him.

Nick and Hank decide that they have to look into Billy Capra's background; as they enter the squad room, they pass the reaper.

Nick goes to Marie's Trailer and reads about Ziegevolk. He then goes to ask Monroe some questions. Monroe tells him that Ziegevolk secrete a special pheromone in their sweat that makes woman fall in love with them.

Nick and Juliette are shopping and he tells her he has been wondering why people are attracted to each other.

Back at work, Nick tells Hank that the glass pieces from Faith Collins's cuts are regular window glass and that she must have broken a window right before she died. They discuss the fact that three women from out of town have disappeared in Portland since Capra arrived and bought the Bramble Haus. They also find that a similar situation has occurred in three other cities in the U.S. Together, they brief Captain Renard. Of the 17 women found in these cases, 14 were found pregnant and the DNA showed they all had the same father.

Billy Capra feeds three women kept in cages in the basement of his inn.

While staking out the inn, Hank Griffin installs a tracking device on Billy Capra's car; the detectives are dismayed when Capra goes out for the evening and leaves the car at home. Hank searches the premises of the inn while Nick follows Capra on foot and sees him consume a toad before entering a bar. Hank finds broken glass in the inn's garden and uses that as an excuse to enter the building. Nick calls Monroe and asks for help. Upon learning that Nick just wants him to hang out at the bar and watch Billy, he gladly agrees as long as Nick is paying for the drinks. He notes that a Ziegevolk who eats toads is a breeder, and that their pheromones are even more powerful and can even make men fall for them. He sees Billy talking to a woman and tells Nick.

The reaper returns to his hotel room and finds Captain Renard waiting for him. Renard reminds the reaper that he should not have come to Renard's city without permission and that he should kneel before Renard. The captain denies the reaper's demand for vengeance in the death of Hulda and uses the reaper's own scythe to slice off his outer ear. Renard tells the reaper to leave and never to return.

Meanwhile, Hank is inside the bed and breakfast when he hears a noise. He goes into the basement and finds a hidden room. Inside, he finds three women in cages. He passes out from the gas that Capra has installed to prevent escape, so he doesn't answer his phone when Nick calls to warn him that Capra is coming back.

Billy Capra returns to his Inn and turns off the gas in the basement. He goes upstairs and soon Lisa enters. He is about to take her on a garden tour when Nick enters and asks her to go with him. Outside, he tells her she walked into a police investigation and requests that she leave the premises. Nick had requested a tracking of Hank's phone when Hank hadn't answered his calls and learns that Hank's phone is inside the inn. Nick dials Hank's number, follows the sound, and enters the basement. Seeing Hank lying there, he rushes in to help him. Billy, who had been upstairs packing, shuts and locks the door behind Nick and turns the gas back on. He flees to his car, taking Lisa with him.

Nick and Hank manage to break out, despite the vivid visual hallucinations Hank is having. The women are rescued, but Billy managed to get away. Returning to the car, Hank picks up his laptop to check for info from the tracking device they had planted on Billy's car. Luckily, it works and they track him to a park. Once there, they spot Billy and Lisa and call for Billy to halt. Billy woges into a Ziegevolk and runs for it, until he is hit by a bus. He is alive but injured. Nick wonders how Billy is going to like being caged up the rest of his life, as a Female Paramedic who is putting an oxygen mask on Billy, shows signs of response to Billy's pheromones."

Nick and Hank are led to a expelled music prodigy who has a strange sort for vengeance against those who wronged him.,[],TV-14,Release date,['David Solomon'],"['', '', '']",[],"['cage', 'bully', 'party', 'rascal', 'execution', 'embarrassment', 'dancing', 'adolescent']",[],"A rave is being held somewhere in Portland, Oregon where a popular DJ, Retchid Kat, is disc jockeying. At the same time, a string quartet consisting of Sarah Jennings, Carter Brimley, Trey Harrison and Marvin is practicing Saint-Saëns's Danse macabre (translating as ""Dance of Death"") under the direction of Paul Lawson at the Von Hamelin Music Institute. Later that evening Lawson enters his car and finds many rats inside. The rats attack. The next morning, the school principal, Grace Kaplan finds Lawson dead in his car with rats walking on his partially eaten body. The police find cages labelled with ""Geiger Pest Control"" in the bushes.

While interrogating the members of the quartet, Nick and Hank learn that there was a student called Roddy Geiger that was suspended a few days earlier, though Sarah says that Roddy wouldn't do something like that.

When they get to the Geiger home, Nick and Hank hear violin music which leads them to Roddy playing in a shed where rats are pressed up to the cages, listening. His father, Ephram Geiger, accuses them of coming to arrest and hurt them, woging into a Reinigen just before he tries to strike Hank for grabbing Roddy (who was probably about to run away). Roddy sees that Nick is a Grimm and instantly distrusts him, accusing Nick of wanting to kill him before attacking (which is stopped by Nick punching him in the face). Both Geigers are arrested.

Ephram Geiger says that he was in the mountains during the time of attack while also saying the cages were stolen and that the students at the school never let his son forget their lack of wealth. He also says that Roddy is a prodigy. During Roddy's interrogation, details about his suspension surface. He was suspended for attacking Carter and Trey, though he claims that ""Yeah, I attacked after they jumped me."" He also admits that he was at the rave the night before and says that one person can alibi him. That person reveals that Roddy is DJ Retchid Kat and Roddy goes free though his dad stays.

Doctor Harper calls them and tells them that Dr. Lawson did not die of the rats; he died of a heart attack. Harper also shows green and red nylon fibers that she found in a rat's stomach which could have come from the car.

Sarah Jennings This then goes back to Roddy who is watching a car and obviously aggravated as he woges into his other form. Sarah gets out of the car and Roddy tells her that the cops have his dad and that the person who did this wanted them (the police) to think it was one of the Geigers. Sarah says that everyone thinks that and says that it makes sense and that Lawson was the one that got him out of the quartet. Roddy says that it's bogus and she knows it. She says that they're her friends, and when he asks her what he is, she claims that he's someone she used to care about. Roddy kisses her and says that she still loves him, but Sarah says that she can't keep sneaking out to be with him before pushing him away. She asks if he didn't put the rats in the car then who did and Roddy accuses Carter. She refuses to believe it, however, and they are interrupted by Sarah's mother who tells Roddy to stay away from her daughter. He meets Carter on his way out and steps forward threateningly, but Carter has his phone already dialed to 911. Roddy hits the car window before stalking away.

Hank comes in with the report that says the fibers came from blankets and an expensive German car. Sarah's mother walks in at the end of the discussion and demands to know why Roddy hasn't been arrested, accusing him of harassing Sarah and saying that he's ""out of control"". She then says that they should get evidence that Roddy was guilty of the murder. When she says that he doesn't belong at the school, Hank asks ""Or your neighborhood?"" and she avoids the subject by saying that they should be writing this down because she was filing a report. Hank later says that he hasn't ""had that much fun since that drunk threw up on [him] at the Christmas party.""

Nick goes to Monroe who tells him about how Reinigen are at the bottom of the food chain and Nick shows that he already knows a bit about them by saying that they're only violent when pushed to the limit. Nick then asks Monroe to talk to Roddy and convinces him to by describing Roddy's musical talent.

Hank and Sgt. Wu go out drinking and Hank admits that Nick's instincts are often right. Hank leaves and meets Adalind Schade who asks to buy him dinner. Captain Renard is watching them from his car.

The camera shows a picture of the quartet minus Carter with Roddy in his place. Roddy is playing a Brahms concerto which Monroe comments on (""You were kicking some butt on that Brahms concerto, man!""). When Monroe says that he is a friend of Detective Burkhardt, Roddy tries to close the door. Monroe catches it, partially woging and revealing his Wesen form. This causes Roddy to back away in fear. Monroe tells Roddy about how Nick isn't like other Grimms and that he's worried about Roddy. Monroe then proceeds to try to lecture Roddy on ""not being stupid"" and how he has talent. Monroe leaves feeling proud of himself.

Unbeknownst to him and Nick, Roddy gets a call from Officer Clay who says that Roddy's father was injured when he refused to enter the cell. Roddy destroys his room (including smashing the picture) in anger. The next day, he unleashes the rats and packs up his violin and Retchid Kat head before heading off to a warehouse with the rats following, accidentally leaving a set fire behind.

Hank and Nick are telling Renard about the results they found with the fibers and it is discovered that Carter drives a car of the description they're looking for. Renard grants them a search warrant.

Carter, Trey, and Marvin are talking about the rats and how Sarah is now suspicious of them. They each get messages about Retchid Kat playing. They all decide to go.

Nick and Hank search Carter's SUV (while being badgered by an indignant father) and find a school banner that matches the fibers as well as a rat dropping. They then go to Sarah's house and find a text on her phone that says that Retchid Kat would be at a warehouse on Front Street.

When the quartet arrive, they think that they might be early and decide to just follow the music which leads them downstairs, Nick and Hank arriving just as they start heading down. In the warehouse, Retchid Kat stops the music and says how they were the ones who killed Lawson which causes Sarah to realize the truth. He then starts to play the violin showing that it's Roddy, and the rats start to attack. The boys run away and Sarah is alone and still being attacked, so Roddy stops the music just before Hank comes in and shoots his gun upwards so that rats will disperse. Nick rushes to Sarah and gets the remaining rats off her.

The boys admit to the police that they did it, but they only meant to scare Dr. Lawson and make it seem Roddy did it. Sarah bluntly says that Roddy was better than all of them and asks them to tell Roddy she's sorry. Hank says that she should tell him herself.

While trying to write the report, they decide to let Roddy off the hook seeing as it was doubtful anyone would believe them and no one forced the four to go down there.

Nick also learns that his presence is beginning to affect the creature world when his refrigerator repairman turns out to be an Eisbiber who is terrified of Nick."

The man, Hap Lasser, is watching an exercise video on TV, and he lifts a Shake Weight, shaking it in spastic bursts. Hap loses his grip, sending the Shake Weight flying through a window. Hap sighs and heads for the door. Hap goes outside to retrieve the Shake Weight. As he bends down to pick it up, in a split second, his home explodes in a fireball behind him. Hap slowly turns and stares back in disbelief at his burning home. Dawn breaks on the crime scene, as a bomb squad and Fire & Rescue root through the smoldering wreckage.

Nick and Hank try to get a statement from Hap, who's staring at what's left of his home, picking up pieces of his shattered life. Hap makes it clear that he's not involved in any shady activities that would result in his home exploding. As he gets emotional, Nick sees Hap morph to reveal himself as a Blutbad, though he doesn't realize Nick is a Grimm. Hap reveals that his brother died in a similar house fire last month, but he doesn't worry about a connection between the two fires. Nick and Hank aren't convinced; this is too strange to be a coincidence.

As Hank and Nick question Hap in an attempt to make a connection between the two fires, Monroe pays a surprise visit to the station. Apparently, he's Hap's emergency contact, and he has begrudgingly agreed to take in Hap during his time of need. Hap excitedly hugs Monroe who is uncomfortably trying to resist. Nick asks Monroe to keep an eye on him for a couple days to make sure he stays out of trouble.

Hap's home is now abandoned until an unknown roar of a motorcycle approaches. The female helmeted rider approaches the wreckage, sniffing until she picks up a scent. Finally, the rider hones in on a plume of vapor around a burst and twisted propane line. The frustrated rider gives a creature-like growl and tears off on her motorcycle. Nick and Hank go over the arson case files with the arson investigator, Lt. Orson. The lieutenant explains that despite the fact that these ""accidents"" look like foul play, it seems to be a true coincidence; both fires can be explained by electrical issues. Despite the evidence, Nick refuses to believe that this was by chance, and he suspects that maybe the beneficiaries were responsible.

Back at Monroe's place, Monroe is less than thrilled at the idea of having Hap as a house guest, putting a damper on his very organized way of life. Meanwhile, Nick drives up to Monroe's house. As he pulls to the curb and kills the engine, the window suddenly shatters, and a ferocious female Blutbad attacks him ruthlessly. When she realizes he's a Grimm, she suddenly jumps back, unnerved for a moment. Monroe and Hap rush out just in time as Hap screams for the fighting to stop; the Blutbad is Hap's sister, and Monroe's ex-girlfriend, Angelina. Now in Monroe's house, Monroe explains the situation to a furious Angelina. She questions how they could be friendly with a Grimm after what he's done to their ancestors, and the fact that he's a Grimm and a cop. Angelina believes that her behavior was warranted; she was protecting her brother and Monroe. When Nick discovers that Angelina is the sole beneficiary in the event that both Rolf and Hap die, he grows suspicious of her involvement in the fire, but Monroe pleads with Nick that despite her hotheaded nature, he knows Angelina, and she would never do that to Rolf.

Angelina tears through the park, running wild and free. Monroe takes after her with pure glee across his face. Monroe gives in to the chase, and falls on top of her and the two tumble to the ground. Angelina wildly licks the side of Monroe's cheek bringing out his Blutbad side and they make love. As dawn breaks, Monroe and Angelina wake in the forest. Monroe's alarmed to find bloodstains on his hand and mouth and the bloody remains of a rabbit close by. Meanwhile, Hap is awakened by someone knocking on the door, claiming to be a rib delivery. When he opens the door, he's met by the sound of multiple bullets from a silenced pistol that hit him in the chest. With dying eyes, he looks up at the silhouette of a fearsome pig creature before being shot in the head. When Angelina and Monroe return to the house, the police have already arrived. Their late arrival made the cops suspicious. In thinking that the two were the killers, the two are brought in for questioning.

As Hank questions Angelina, he notices the blood on her shirt. She aggressively throws her shirt at Hank, telling him to test it. As Monroe and Angelina leave the police station, Angelina voices her frustration with Monroe for being friends with cops, who are trying to pin Hap's murder on her.

After investigating, Nick and Hank come to find that Lt. Orson is thought to be a serious suspect after seeing in his profile that his two brothers in Eugene were murdered two years ago, and they believe that Angelina was responsible. In their theory, Lt. Orson killed hers for payback. Since he's an arson expert, he knows better than anyone how to make an explosion look like an accident. Nick and Hank take up their theory with the captain, who tells them to make sure it's solid before throwing around accusations. Nick talks to the lieutenant, letting him know that they're getting a second opinion on the files. The nervous lieutenant woges into a pig creature, or Bauerschwein. Nick calls him out as a Bauerschwein, revealing that he's a Grimm. Lt. Orson tells Nick he has nothing against him and would hate to stir up trouble now.

Nick shows up at Monroe's, searching for Angelina. Angelina stopped by earlier looking for Monroe's help in tracking down the pig that killed her brothers, but he refused to take part. Monroe tells Nick the same thing he told her; he's staying out of it. Because the Blutbad-Bauerschwein Feud goes back centuries, they get blamed for every Bauerschwein death. Angelina arrives at the precinct in a sundress to track down Lt. Orson's office and sifts through files, looking for his home address and is interrupted by an officer. Angelina attacks the officer with her Blutbad strength and takes off on her bike. After hearing about the attack when he arrives at the station, Nick rushes to Lt. Orson's home, worried that Angelina may beat him there.

Nick arrives at the Lieutenant's house to find him relaxing in a mud bath. Orson explains that it's a comforting activity for Bauerschwein. He tries to reason with Nick, making the argument that they're actually on the same side. He states that Angelina is a monster, Rolf was the same, all Blutbaden are animals, and Angelina is the one they should be after. Nick asks if Hap was an animal, knowing Orson doesn't have a comeback for that. Orson instead tells him that the only reason Angelina murdered his hard-working brothers was that it ""was something to do on a Saturday night."" Nick tells Orson that regardless of her actions, he still killed two people and is under arrest. Before they can argue further, Angelina arrives on the scene, wrestling Orson to the couch. Both are woged, and a vicious fight ensues. Nick finds himself in quite the predicament, unsure of whom to shoot. When presented with an opportunity to hit Angelina's lower back, he takes it, remembering reading about Blutbadens' vulnerability relating to a nerve cluster in the lower spine from the Grimm diaries. When Angelina recovers and goes for Nick, Orson picks up his gun and shoots Angelina. Orson makes a move to fire again but is stopped when Nick knocks the gun out of his hand. Nick turns back to Angelina, but she has already run off into the night, leaving only a blood trail.

After other officers arrive at Orson's home, Orson is being taken away by paramedics when he tells Nick that sometimes being a cop gets in the way of what you have to do. At home, Monroe goes through pictures of himself with Angelina and Hap on his computer, reminiscing. Nick calls and updates him that Orson has been arrested and Angelina was shot. He believes that Monroe can help find her, but Monroe tells him to not push it and hangs up. Hearing a noise outside, he goes out to investigate and finds the framed Lasser sibling photo near the front door. As he looks out into the night, Angelina can be heard howling in the distance."

He takes them to his camp at gunpoint and is about to kill both of them when he hears a strange noise from the woods. The drug dealer goes to investigate the sound, but a rope wraps around his neck and pulls him out of sight. The couple hear an animal growl and see a shadow tearing through the contents of the drug dealer's tent, before they loosen their bonds and escape into the woods.

Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive at the crime scene. They examine the drug dealer's body. The neck is badly bruised and bent at a grotesque angle, clearly broken. The crime scene techs find brown hair on the body, which clearly does not belong to the bald drug dealer. DEA Agent Langford identifies the dealer as Delmar Blake, whom the DEA has been investigating for some time, but never been able to convict. Langford also makes clear that the DEA is solely concerned with Blake's drug operation, not finding his killer, who, he figures, ""did the planet a favor."" After the detectives talk with the Forest Service Ranger, Nick goes back to the body and discovers buckshot in a tree. As he searches for more evidence, a dark figure drops from the trees and flees from Nick. Nick chases after the figure, and it turns to growl at him, revealing it to be a female Blutbad with hair longer than her height. The Blutbad runs away.

Interviewed at their home, Dustin and Lauren relate what they saw, swearing that they never got a clear look at who (or what) attacked the drug dealer and tore through his tent, but whatever it was, it saved both their lives.

Nick and Hank brief Captain Renard, who notes several odd aspects of the crime: if the killer was a rival drug dealer, he would have taken the several million dollars worth of marijuana plants that Blake was growing; instead, he simply stole some food and a sleeping bag.

Micah and Roland Blake, the deceased Delmar's brothers, arrive at the police station and demand to see their brother's body. Hank and Nick tell them that they will all have to meet at the morgue. At the morgue, Micah and Roland act in a threatening manner but refrain from actually making any threats.

Nick and Hank return to the station. The brown hair found at the crime scene has been analyzed. Sergeant Wu tells Hank that the hair matches the DNA of Holly Clark, a girl who disappeared nine years ago at the age of seven.

Meanwhile, Micah and Roland abduct Dustin, and take him captive. They suspect he was after Delmar's drugs or knows what happened to him. He tells them exactly what happened, but they leave him tied up until they can determine if he is telling the truth.

Nick, completely baffled, seeks the help of Monroe, who is decorating for Christmas. Monroe tells Nick that Christmas is a big tradition in his family, and suggests that Santa Claus is not only real, but a Wesen to boot. Nick shows Holly's picture and Monroe says he can't tell from a photo whether she really is a Blutbad, but agrees that if she was, she'd have a better chance to survive on her own in the woods for nine years than a normal human would. Nick also explains that Holly was adopted as a young age, and doesn't know yet if her adoptive parents were Blutbaden, and asks what that could mean for Holly's development. Monroe explains that a Blutbad typically doesn't experience his or her own animal side until later in his childhood, and his own first morph ""scared the crap out of me."" If Holly did not have parents who understood what was happening to her, like Monroe did, then that could definitely explain why she disappeared into the woods. Nick says he needs Monroe's help to search the crime scene, and Monroe warily agrees, but not until the morning. He warns Nick that, whatever he may have in common with the girl, neither of them is prepared to deal with a Blutbad who has been living wild for nine years.

Nick goes home for the night and is perplexed about a car that speeds past his house. As he and Juliette prepare for sleep that night, they discuss Holly's situation.

Hank, who worked on the Holly Clark case before, gets permission to re-open the investigation. He sees Holly's adoptive mother to inform her the case has been re-opened. Hank asks her if she and her husband used to take her camping, and Holly's mother reveals they had taken Holly a few times and borrowed camping equipment from their former neighbor, James Addison. Hank has Wu get information on Addison, and Wu reports that of all the neighbors questioned about Holly's disappearance, Addison had the best alibi: he was in the hospital following a wild dog attack. However, on reading the report it was discovered that Addison reported he had been hiking near Mount Hood when the attack occurred, but he was hospitalized at Community Hospital in Beaverton, which would have been an hour's drive away. Hank and Officer Wu agree they should visit his home to question him. Mr. Addison, still needing a cane to walk, confirms that on the day Holly disappeared he had been in the hospital being treated for a wild dog bite, but when questioned why he drove such a long distance to be treated, he grows defensive. Hank requests that Mr. Addison accompany them to the station for a formal statement.

In the woods, Monroe picks up Holly's scent and he and Nick chase her through the woods and discover her refuge, a tree-house built in the forest's canopy. Monroe and Nick climb the tree and quietly enter, finding her passed out on her cot. Monroe cautiously approaches her and sees a spread of buckshot wounds in her lower abdomen. She awakens and growls defensively at Monroe. He shows her his Blutbad form, and she relaxes a little. Nick attempts to treat Holly's wounds, but she again growls in self-defense, unsure of Nick. Monroe explains to her that Nick can be trusted and she relaxes and lets Nick tend to her wounds. Nick fears that Holly needs more complete medical treatment and says they need to get her to a hospital. Monroe objects that Holly could hurt someone, but Nick says they have no other choice but to leave her there, which he refuses to do. Since his cell phone isn't receiving, Nick leaves to get help.

Monroe comforts Holly and feels her forehead, which is burning hot. He then says he'll go and get her some Burdock Root, a medicinal plant, to help her fever. Frightened of him leaving and never returning, Holly grabs his hand and whimpers. He promises he will return and she lies back down.

When Nick reaches the edge of the forest, he reaches Hank on his cell phone, requesting paramedics. He also asks Hank to run a name that Nick saw on some old camping gear in Holly's tree house: Addison.

At the station, Hank hangs up his phone, turns and asks Addison to explain how his camping gear turned up in Holly's hideout. Addison panics and throws a punch at Hank, which Hank blocks and punches Addison in the throat, dropping him. As he is restrained, Addison yells that Holly almost killed him and begs the police to keep him safe from her, clearly more terrified of her than of going to jail.

As Monroe digs up the Burdock Root, Micah and Roland, who were searching the site of their brother's murder, catch sight of him and follow him back to the treehouse. As Monroe is helping Holly chew the root, the brothers fire a warning shot and tell Monroe to come down. He obeys, but then they hear Holly in the tree house. Monroe insists no one is there, but one brother goes to look, and tells the other brother to shoot Monroe if he sees anyone. Holly has escaped, and Monroe breathes a sigh of relief, until the brother sees Delmar's camping gear in the tree house. Nick returns and tries to control the situation, but Holly intervenes and using her long braid to wrap around the neck of one brother, killing him, while Nick shoots the other one. Holly collapses after she saves Nick and Monroe.

Nick and Monroe take Holly to the hospital, and Hank informs her shocked mother that her daughter has been found alive. Nick drops off Monroe before taking Holly home, but she doesn't want him to go. He holds her hand and tells her to remember that she will never be alone.

At first, Holly barely recognizes her mother, but then holds up the plastic hair bow she was wearing the day she was abducted, and hugs her tearfully.

Sergeant Wu responds to the alarm and find Patterson's body. Detectives Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive at the crime scene soon after. After Captain Renard arrives, the crime scene investigator announces that they have recovered a fingerprint from the gavel used in the judge's murder. Elsewhere in Portland, the unidentified man is seen throwing a severed hand into a body of water.

Back at the precinct, Hank is talking to Captain Renard when he gets a call that the fingerprint on the gavel matches that of Vince Chilton. Hank, Renard, and Nick accompany a tactical team to Chilton's apartment. The lead officer secures the area and reports to Renard that there is a dead body in the apartment. The body is identified as Vince Chilton and is missing its right hand. On the stump of the right arm is a very old woman's watch. Hank remembers that Nick knows a watchmaker. The detectives go to Monroe's Home, where Monroe examines the watch and finds that the movement was glued to stop it at 10:15 on March 11th. Monroe traces the watch and finds that it last belonged to Mary Robinson. Hank recognizes the name as that of a retired assistant district attorney, and admits to having a bad feeling about the situation. Uniformed police, including Sergeant Wu, respond to Robinson's house, where they find her dead, her tongue having been cut out and placed on a set of scales. When Hank sees the body, he realizes that he knows the identity of the killer.

Back at the station, Hank explains to Renard and Nick that the killer is Oleg Stark, who was convicted of murder in the deaths of Jack Lambert, his wife, and child. They discuss how Stark escaped from prison in California and that he is insensitive to pain and has very dense bones. Hank explains that Judge Patterson presided, Mary Robinson prosecuted and Vince Chilton was the jury foreman. The verdict was handed down at 10:15 on March 11th. Renard puts Hank into protective custody and tells Nick to trace Stark's movements.

Evidence of Stark is found nearby where Hank used to live and Nick and Capt. Renard rush over. While they investigate the area, Stark watches from afar to see if Hank will appear. Nick begins to sense something... like someone is watching him but when he turns, no one is there.

Nick heads to Aunt Marie's trailer and begins to see if he can find a creature that matches Stark's medical condition. Unable to find anything, Nick begins to look around. Inside the weapons cabinet, he finds a case and inside is a rifle with an engraving on how to use it.

Nick gets home and hears a noise outside which he attributes to raccoons but when he hears it again, he cautiously approaches the doors from where the noise came. When he gets close enough, Stark crashes through the window and begins to attack Nick. Stark demands to know where Hank is. He slowly closes in on Nick and as he does, Nick sees Stark's face change into a creature. Stark continues to pressure Nick who fights back demanding to know where Hank is. When Stark realizes that Nick is a Grimm, his anger amplifies and he is intent on killing him. Juliette happens to walk in as Stark is about to finish him off. Nick warns her to run and Stark goes after her. She flees to the kitchen to find something for her safety and as Stark follows her, she takes a pot of water that was boiling on the stove and throws it at him which his eyes. Unable to see clearly, Stark stumbles out of the house as Nick tries to guns him down.

At the hospital, the doctor tells Captain Renard and Juliette of Nick's condition, saying that he has bruised ribs, a dislocated shoulder, and a mild concussion, but no broken bones. The Captain assures Juliette that Nick will have round the clock protection, as will she. Nick begins to realize how dangerous being a Grimm can be and how close Juliette was to getting hurt. After she leaves, Nick calls Monroe and tells him what happened.

Sgt. Wu informs Hank of what happened to Nick. Angry, Hank decides to take matters in his own hands but instead Wu devises a plan to get Stark using Hank as bait. They realize Stark attacked Nick to draw out Hank so he decides to bait Stark by visiting Nick at the hospital.

While Monroe visits Nick, Nick describes to Monroe his attacker. Monroe is able to identify him as a Siegbarste (otherwise known as an ogre) and tells him they are very rare but the worst of their creature kind. Apparently, he once had a childhood friend named Freddy whose father was brutally murdered by one, and that Nick was very lucky to still be alive. They carry grudges and are very hard to kill unless you have Siegbarste Gift (a poison) which was very rare. It calcifies an ogre's bones so that you can shatter the ogre from the inside out. The trick is to get it into the ogre. Nick remembers there was a bottle in the trailer labeled as such and the rifle in the case was made to get it inside them. Nick asks Monroe to get the poison and rifle for him.

As Monroe gathers the items needed to fight Stark, Hank goes and visits Nick. Stark is nearby and watches him enter the hospital. Hank tells Nick about the plan to ambush Stark but Nick tries to tell him that it won't work. It is then that Hank confesses that during the trial he ""misplaced"" bogus evidence that had the jury seen it may have given Stark a chance to walk. Although he and the assistant DA knew it was a set up by Stark, they didn't want to give the jury any reason for reasonable doubt and it became ""lost"" on its way to court. Hank tells Nick that he intends to stop Stark and instead of following through with the Captain's plans, he was going to lead Stark to the quarry where it all started. Nick calls Monroe and tells him to give Hank the gun but Hank had already left the hospital. Nick implores him to follow and somehow give it to him to use.

At the quarry, Hank confronts Stark and Monroe sees he's too late. He sees that Hank is aiming a rifle at Stark and knows that won't stop him. He opens the case and starts putting the Siegbarste Gewehr together. Monroe watches as Stark and Hank fight. As Stark is about to smash a piece of concrete over Hank, Monroe shoots and kills Stark, saving Hank who wonders where the shot came from. Monroe discreetly gets out of the area.

Monroe calls Nick and tells him that Hank is safe. Hank visits Nick and tells him that someone shot Stark but he doesn't know who did it. At the precinct, Captain Renard chastises Hank for trying to be a lone cowboy, then tells him that the bullets taken out of Stark's body were made in England over 100 years ago and was fired from a very old and rare elephant gun made for royalty. They both wonder who in the world would own something like that."

He chases the other across the garage and a few seconds later is dead from having a screwdriver driven into his throat. However, his appearance has changed to that of an older man. A hooded figure drags the body to a dumpster, which is later emptied by a collection truck. Nick and his partner go to the site where the body was discovered after it jammed the rear loader. After learning the victim's identity and that his address was on the garbage truck's route, the detectives go to investigate. Finding blood in the dumpster and drag marks with blood on the sidewalk, they question the building manager. The manager tells them about an argument that happened the day before between Lenny and Mason, and asks if Natalie had gotten hurt and tells Nick and Hank that Natalie was Lenny's live-in. The detectives request to see inside Lenny's apartment and find it in disarray and state that it looks like Natalie Haverstraw left in a hurry.

After an APB is put out on her, they find Natalie in a motel and question her. She says that Lenny had been drinking and they got into an argument and he hit her. She told him she was leaving and went to pack her things, when Lenny exploded and she is sure he would have killed her if Marty, another tenant, hadn't come by then to see if everything was all right. Lenny started yelling at Marty, when another tenant, Mason Snyder showed up. Marty left and Lenny and Mason's argument got heated. She had Mason escort her to her car to leave after she got her stuff. Natalie was surprised that Lenny had been murdered.

Nick and Hank then go to the junk shop Marty owns to hear his take on the argument. His account was almost identical to Natalie's, and he says his dad can verify that he returned to the apartment after the argument. During the interview, Nick sees Marty woge into a mouse-like creature. After that, Nick and Hank visit the law office of Mason Snyder. When Mason gets into an argument on the phone, Nick sees him woge into a snake-like creature.

Next Nick visits Monroe to learn more about the snake and mouse creatures. Monroe says Mauzhertz are very meek and afraid, and one rarely meets a Lausenschlange and lives to tell. Monroe answers a phone call about repairing an old clock tower the next day at 12:30, and he excuses himself to get more details.

Juliette Silverton arrives home and sees a woman in a pick up truck photographing the house. Juliette writes down the license number of the truck and tells Nick. He learns that the truck is registered to John Oblinger.

Later an unknown man is at a repair shop, upset with the owner about the outcome of his car repair job. The owner, Andy yells ""Then take me to court!"" The shop owner then woges into the same old man at the parking garage. The unknown person then kills him and dumps his body in the dumpster. Nick and Hank are called to investigate the crime scene when the body is discovered the next morning. They feel the two cases are connected. After looking at the shop owner's recent customers, they discover one of them is Marty.

At around noon, Monroe arrives to fix the clock tower. He discovers no one is at the location. He sees someone on the balcony, but when he looks up, people attack him. Before he gets knocked out, he realizes he is being attacked by Wesen.

Juliette goes to the address at which the pick up is registered. She sees the woman, who rushes two children into the house after noticing Juliette.

Marty meets Natalie as she is moving the rest of her belongings. Natalie tells Marty that she needs to leave town and start over. Mason comes out with boxes of Natalie's belongings, and Marty leaves. He is looking into Mason's car, when Mason grabs him and declares that Natalie is his and so is Marty. His arm is around Marty's neck, choking him, but the attack is interrupted when a couple enters the parking area. Marty seizes the opportunity to escape, and jumps into his car and speeds away.

Nick and Hank go into Marty's cluttered apartment and there they find Marty's Father, dead. He has been dead at least two days. Marty then goes to attack and kill Mason, Nick and Hank arrive later and realize Marty is dangerous and at large. Marty then meets Natalie with flowers and an invitation to dinner. Natalie, surprised by Marty's new personality, agrees. At dinner, Marty is giving Natalie positive complements when an argument between a father and his son interrupts. Marty then punches the dad, Natalie has to drag Marty out of the restaurant. As they leave, Marty sees every man as his dad.

Marty then speeds off with Natalie in his Camaro. Natalie appears frightened. The police start chasing him, before they lose him as he goes to his shop. At the shop, Marty drags Natalie into the shop. Nick and Hank then find Marty holding Natalie hostage inside the shop. After taking Natalie to safety, Nick tells Marty his father is dead. Delusional, Marty tells Nick he sees his father everywhere, no matter how many times he kills him. Nick arrests Marty.

Juliette tells Nick about having ""investigated"" the woman.

Afterwards, Nick visits an injured Monroe, who found a reaper symbol on his car after he got beat up. Monroe says the Reapers attacked him because he was helping a Grimm. Nick says he won't ask Monroe for help. Monroe objects; he vows to stick with Nick and be ready for any future attacks."

When they hit a river, one of the teens, Steven, slips in and floats away. Before Kevin can help him, he's grabbed from behind by the Geiers who pull him, screaming into the woods. Kevin is dragged past a fire pit into a barn, where the body of a young girl is being thrown into the flames. The next morning, we see Steven's lifeless body float down the river and over a large waterfall--just after a crow appears and pecks Steven's eyes out.

Over coffee, Nick confesses to Monroe that he wants to tell Juliette about being a Grimm. Monroe warns that nothing good can come of it and notes that Nick should breakup with her for her own safety. Nick refuses to give up on Juliette, determined to find another way. Monroe admits that Wesen can be seen by humans only if they decide that they want to be seen, but most humans simply can't process the gravity of that event. Wogeing for Juliette would likely have devastating consequences. Steven's body is discovered washed up on the river. He's strikingly pale, his eyes have been replaced by blood-circled sockets, and two puncture wounds on his neck lead Nick and Hank to believe that the body was drained of blood. The only thing on him is a puka shell necklace. According to Harper, the boy died from drowning, but he probably drowned because he was incredibly weak from loss of blood. Nobody puts I.V. needles in their neck by accident; this is definitely a homicide.

Nick and Hank gather Steven's identity and track down his PO box. In the post office, they find a kid with a similar necklace, which leads them to the sellers, two young teens. These ""street kid"" siblings Gracie and Hanson knew Steven well; he got work at a ranch a month back and they haven't seen him since. Their last encounter was at the local free medical clinic. Nick and Hank go to the clinic to follow up, but Steven's medical records don't provide any clues.

Nick and Hank are called to a particularly unusual car crash. The contents of the SUV are strewn about: human blood, livers and hearts. As the driver's pried from the car and dies on the gurney, Nick sees him transform into a Geier. Later, Nick and Hank test the blood and organs and find that the blood from the vehicle matches that of Steven. However, the organs do not; they appear to belong to a number of different people. It looks like somebody has been harvesting human organs... and not from a hospital. Additionally, the organs are young and healthy, leading Nick and Hank to believe that street kids are the main target.

Later, after studying up on Aunt Marie's books, Monroe confirms Nick's suspicions that Geiers are his primary suspect. These creatures harvest human parts for Wesen enhancement. Apparently, humans organs are the equivalent of exotic animals to Wesen, but unlike human exotic ingredients, like rhino horn, being worthless idiocy, humans organs do actually work for Wesen. Nick persuades Monroe to go to one of these shops for human organs and bring proof. Monroe buys Nick ""Gallenblase,"" which is ground up human gallbladder. After laboratory confirmation, Nick goes back and confronts the store owner, threatening him until he gives up his contact who's delivering the goods. Nick orders him to stop selling human organs and destroys the ones he has in stock.

The phone number of the organ dealer leads the police right to the source, where countless human organs are found drying in a greenhouse-like contraption. The police take down the only man at the location and find that he's received a number of phone calls from a free medical clinic - the same clinic that the street kids frequently visit. After entering the clinic, Nick threatens the only nurse left to give up the location where they're operating on the children.

Gracie and Hanson are snatched off the street by the office manager from the clinic and thrown into a white van. Hanson discreetly leaves a trail of pukka shells as they're led to the cabin in the woods and prepped for surgery. The same female doctor from the clinic performs organ-harvesting surgery on an innocent victim as Gracie, Hanson and the previously missing Kevin await their fate. Nick, Hank, and Captain Renard lead a SWAT team to a woodland facility where the organ removal takes place. The police arrive at the organ removal site and notice the trail Hansen left. A gunfight ensues and Nick chases the head surgeon outside. She attacks Nick from the trees and eventually falls into the giant fire pit formed outside. All of the kids are saved from the organ removal site.

When Renard arrives back at the precinct, he has received a package from the Reapers. It appears to be the ear of the reaper he previously severed at the beginning of the series/season. Renard is called on his cell phone by a representative of the Reapers whom he does not know. The man compares a Grimm uncontrolled to a samurai without a master and says things have gotten ""out of balance."" He tells Renard he has to get control of Nick or ""get rid of him"", if not they will. Renard reminds him that this Grimm has a badge and a conscience. In a show of his confidence, he also suggests that if the reapers are so concerned they should come to take care of the problem themselves. The man replies, saying if things do not change, the reapers will do just that."

He briefly woges into a Fuchsbau as he approaches her, ready to lay on the charm. The woman has a quick tongue and coyly plays against his advances, leaving the gallery and leaving him wanting more. He follows the woman, Lena, outside and manages to talk her into his stylish apartment. When she tries to leave, Ryan attacks her, throwing her down onto the couch. Lena turns the tables and pins him down, wogeing into a terrifying spider creature. Ryan tries to fight back and even manages to bite off one of her fingers, but he's no match for Lena's spider form. She regurgitates a milky liquid, forcing his convulsing body to swallow it. Later, Lena emerges from the apartment, her hair a mess, her face smeared with blood, and one of her fingers missing, horrified by what she's done. Nick and Juliette are at home when their home is egged. Nick runs outside and finds two boys. On seeing Nick, one of the boys briefly woges into an Eisbiber; both boys then flee on foot. The next morning Nick is discussing his exposure to the creatures with Monroe. Monroe reminds him that Grimms are a curiosity to many members of the Wesen community - many Wesen tell their kids about Grimms to scare them: ""Be good or a Grimm will come and cut your head off"". Monroe asks about Nick's progress in revealing his being a Grimm to Juliette. Nick admits that he has not yet told her anything and Monroe responds that Grimms must not be so brave after all. Nick's cell phone rings, summoning him on a case.

Nick and Hank arrive at their latest crime scene to find Ryan's dead body completely desiccated. Nick and Hank are stumped; that kind of deterioration doesn't happen overnight, but his girlfriend talked to him on the phone the night before. Additionally, video surveillance from the gallery confirms that he was alive. Nick and Hank note him talking to the woman in the black hat, the question is... did they maybe meet up later after the event? Nick finds Lena's finger, but as he's holding it, it twitches, freaking him out into dropping it. An amused Hank collects it instead.

Later, Harper examines the dead body and explains her discovery to Nick and Hank. The body was forced to ingest a highly corrosive acid, killing the victim from the inside out. The acid, suspiciously enough, is found in spider venom. Then, the victim's organs were sucked out by some mechanism that left a bite mark, literally sucking him dry.

Lena enters an upscale bar, this time, as a blonde. She sets her sights on a nicely dressed man dining alone and goes in for the kill. Later in a dark hotel room, Lena attacks the man the same way she did Ryan, forcing him to ingest the corrosive white acid as she woges into a terrifying spider creature.

Nick goes to the address linked to the car that had been stalking his house. John Oblinger, an Eisbiber and also Bud's friend, answers the door and spills his beer on the floor at the sight of Nick. Nick sarcastically states that if ""you can't hold your liquor, you shouldn't be drinking."" Nick corners Bud and John in the kitchen and demands that they make sure no one visits his house again. Nick is also deliberately menacing to the Eisbibers, and does nothing to alleviate their fear till the end, when he states that he is not going to kill them, unless he feels that Juliette and himself are threatened. The Eisbibers are terrified and agreed fervently to whatever Nick says.

As the second victim is discovered, a match is found on the fingerprints at the scene. The prints are linked to a similar killing of three victims in another state five years before and an identical case five years before that. There seems to be a pattern, and only two have been killed so far. That means Nick and Hank don't have much time to track down their killer before a third man is found dead. Meanwhile, Lena removes her wig and makeup and greets her husband at her daughter's soccer game. As it turns out, the killer is also a soccer mom.

Later, after the game, Lena gives her husband the gold Rolex watch she took off Ryan's dead body as a gift. They share a passionate kiss; despite her horrible nature, it seems their love is true and genuine.

After investigating Aunt Marie's books, Nick discovers a spider creature that seems to match their suspect. He goes to Monroe with his suspicion and learns about Spinnetods, the Black Widows of the creature world. Monroe doesn't know much but remembers that he has a contact who might be able to help Nick out. Monroe takes him to visit Charlotte, a Wieder Spinnetod who is a resident of a Klosterhaus, a retirement/monastic retreat home for wesen. Having turned her back on who she was years ago, she's actually 26 years old but appears 70; her biology causes rapid aging. The only way to stop the curse is to kill and suck the life out of young men. It must be done every five years, three victims at a time. She estimates the perpetrator must be around 28 to 32 years old.

Entranced by the watch, their young daughter takes it from her father's nightstand and takes it with her to school, showing it off to her classmates. The principal reports her having the watch, the tracking number leads the police back to Lena. When Nick goes to question Lena, he notices her bandaged finger and is sure he's got her cornered. But when she unravels the bandage, her finger is there, intact.

Nick takes Lena's prints from the house and finds that they somehow match that of the severed finger from the original crime scene. While they can't fathom how it's possible, this is reason enough to take Lena into custody. They arrive at her house, but it's too late; Lena's already left for her third kill. The police track her to the Marina, where she's seducing a young man on his boat. The police intercept the young man and find Lena, who viciously attacks Nick, trying to make him her next victim. He fights her off and manages to trap her in a net, ironically leaving her in a tangled web. Later, Nick and Hank go to escort Lena's confused and worried daughter. Nick sees her woge into a young Spinnetod and is fearful of the cycle that will inevitably continue. Meanwhile, a rapidly aged Lena sits in the holding cell."

Nick just wants a simple steak dinner at home. While putting away the laundry, Juliette finds Nick's engagement ring he bought in.""Pilot""

After finding Dimitri Skontos is their primary suspect at the murder scene, Nick and Hank pay a visit to his probation officer, Leo Taymor. Leo says Dimitri was released on probation last month, and Dimitri missed his last probation appointment. Leo adds that Dimitri also has had three prior run-ins with the law, and he has some violent tendencies. Dimitri works at his uncle's boxing gym. Nick and Hank decide to go there next.

At the gym, Nick comes across Dimitri's workout buddy, Brian Cooney, a Dickfellig. The last time Brian saw Dimitri was a few weeks ago, before he went running in Forest Park. Brian then takes Nick and Hank to the running trail, before going on a run of his own. Hank spots horse manure and alerts Nick; it is only six miles from the murder site. As Brian is running down the trail, the same men on horseback rope and capture him.

Franco calls Hank to tell him he has found Dimitri's car, abandoned and salvaged. Once there, Nick and Hank see no value in the abandoned car, the local auto pickers have taken everything from the car except the frame. They spot someone by the nearby abandoned warehouse and decide to go inside. They pursue him; inside they find a lot of blood. Hank tells Franco to call forensics to get the DNA from the blood. He and Nick see a ritualistic fighting area marked on the floor. The words are in Latin and there is blood everywhere. They have to be using more than their fists; later they find medieval weapons which confirms their suspicions. Franco spots the guy going inside the warehouse, but he gets injured by the suspect and he escapes.

Back at the station, reports come back that the blood in the warehouse matches Dimitri's blood. That means Dimitri had to have fought in the arena, but how and why? They take the pictures of the fighting ring to Captain Renard so he can translate the Latin. The words refer to fighting to the death of it. The captain then tracks down Leo Taymor, the man who runs the fight club. Renard tells him to shut it down since he disobey his orders by using Dimitri. He was only supposed to use drug addicts since they have no family. Leo refuses to obey saying royalty doesn't matter that much anymore. At that Renard pulls his gun and threatens to kill Leo, telling him to clean up the mess, or he will clean it up for him.

Nick recruits Monroe to find out more on where the fight club is. Monroe visits a bar where he finds a Wesen bookie. After showing that he is a Blutbad, Sauly, the bookie, offers Monroe money on a top greyhound. Monroe declines, saying he needs something with more life and death. Sauly responds saying he does not do the Löwen Games. After Monroe gives him $100, he give Monroe the number of a representative to attend the Löwen Games. Monroe calls Nick to tell him he will meet a guy at 6pm in Linnton, the contact will then take him to the location of the fight.

Back at the station, Renard informs them that Brian was recently reported missing. He asks where they last saw him, they said he was going on a run in Forest Park. Later, Franco calls Nick to tell him that they have found Brian's car. It appears the car was dumped so no one would know Brian was missing. Just as Nick arrives, Monroe calls him saying he has been waiting for his contact to take him to the fight club. Nick tells Monroe to get out of there, just as a car with a horse trailer pulls up. Monroe is taken by some group of people, Nick hears the scuffle and leaves to go to help Monroe. Nick arrives just as the person who assaulted Monroe is about to drive off in his Volkswagen Beetle, presumably to dump it with the other cars. Nick tells the driver to get out, and he arrests him; Nick gets the location of the fight club.

Clement and Gus, Monroe's captors, put him in a cage in the fight club. Monroe is next to the cage occupied by Dimitri. Monroe offers to help his injured hand in order to salvage any shred of humanity Dimitri may have left. His hand has a huge nail stuck in it, Monroe pulls it out. The ""handlers"" come in to throw meat in the cages, since Monroe is a vegetarian, he refuses to eat it. On the contrary, Dimitri savagely devours it. Monroe is shocked and disgusted to learn that the flesh is human after seeing a tattoo on the chunk of flesh Dimitri is consuming. The tattoo is that of a Rhino, exactly the same one that Brian Cooney had. Monroe is later subjected to electric shocks to provoke him into changing into a Blutbad.

Monroe is taken into the fighting ring to face Dimitri. Monroe puts up a good fight with Dimitri, but his skills are no match to Dimitri, a fighting veteran. Monroe is pinned to the ground, and just when he is about to die, Nick shows up after calling for police backup. He puts a gun to Leo's head, demanding he let Monroe go. Leo refuses, saying someone must die. Nick, outnumbered, volunteers to fight in Monroe's place. The crowd goes wild to see a Grimm battle a Wesen. After a hard fight, Nick manages to defeat Dimitri. The crowd isn't happy and starts to make their way into the arena when the police backup shows up. The police arrive just in time, shutting down the operation and saving Nick and Monroe. Hank arrests Dimitri.

Meanwhile, Juliette watches the time go by waiting for Nick to show up for dinner. She is upset her romantic dinner is going to waste. It will be another night alone while Nick is who knows where... yet Nick is apparently planning on proposing. Nick calls Juliette to tell her he is going home from work. Juliette is noticeably upset, and does not talk to Nick much. Juliette sadly goes to put away the ring, not sure if Nick will ever propose.

The priest asks if the person in question can be saved, but Renard insists that Taymor is no longer afraid of the sword now, or in the hereafter. After assurance that this is the only way, the priest agrees, and follows Renard to Taymor. We see Renard walking away as the sounds of Taymor's death are heard in the background."

As the store is closing for the night, they kick the door open and start shooting with automatic rifles. Sam Bertram makes his way to the vault to stay safe. After he shuts the door, the criminals start drilling through the vault's door. Seeing that they will blow the door out, Sam Bertram gets a small box with gold coins in it and eats them. Sam Bertram is near-death from the coins just as the vault door is blown.

Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive at the scene accompanied by Sgt. Wu. They go into the vault to see it robbed of all items and Sam Bertram's dead body. His face is covered with hundreds of shards of glass and metal. Unfortunately, the security camera was ripped out by the robbers. The robbery looks professional, the thieves knew what they were doing.

Meanwhile, the robbers return to their base to sift through the coins. After looking at each and every coin, they decide it must still be at the shop. Soledad Marquesa thinks that one of his accomplices might have stolen the coins. After threatening them, he leaves angry. Ian and Hans are left alone when someone slips into the house, the two draw their guns. Thinking the other person is the burglar, Ian and Hans shoot each other. A Steinadler then emerges from the shadows, looking over Hans and Ian's dead bodies.

Harper reports back to Nick and Hank about Sam Bertram and how he died. She says his whole system shut down, it was not the blast alone. So she started looking in his system only to discover three gold coins. Gold usually does not cause an allergic reaction powerful enough to kill, so the coins must contain other metals. The coins must have been valuable if he swallowed them. The coins have a swastika on the reverse and the head of the Nemean lion on the obverse. Hank decides to collect the coins for evidence, Harper is upset because she still needs to run toxicology tests on them. Nick gets a call that they have found the BMW at the scene of the robbery, Nick and Hank go there next.

Nick and Hank arrive at the scene of where the BMW is parked. Officer Brenner is waiting for them in his police cruiser; Nick and Hank will go inside while Brenner watches the perimeter. Hank goes in first and forces Farley Kolt to the floor. Brenner sees Soledad run out of the house and pursues him; unfortunately, he jumps a fence and disappears. Hank is upset with Brenner for letting the suspect get away, Brenner goes to his car to call for a coroner when a hand grabs him and later kills him. When Nick arrests Kolt, he sees him transform into a Steinadler.

Back at the Precinct, Nick and Hank report their findings to Captain Renard. Hank keeps talking about the guy he took down (Farley Kolt) and also mentions the coins. The Captain wants to see these coins and Hank reluctantly gives them to him. Hank wants to interrogate Kolt, but since he was rough with him earlier, the captain tells Nick to conduct the interview. Renard examines them and feels their power, he then makes a phone call to his friend in France to tell him he has found the Coins of Zakynthos. Nick suggests Hank goes home since he is angry and has had a long day. Nick then goes to interview Farley Kolt.

During the interview, Farley Kolt tells Nick this is not about him being a cop, it is about being a Grimm. Kolt says the robbers robbed the store to find the Coins of Zakynthos. He tells Nick the long story about the coins; whoever possesses them has a strong influence on others. He says the coins have been safely kept until 18 years ago, when the Grimm protecting them (Nick's Parents) was killed in a car accident. The accident was in Rhinebeck, New York, the same place where Nick grew up.

Nick calls Monroe to come into the Trailer to translate some German entries. They discover Schakale, who are ruthless killers and like to eat babies, and Steinadler which are eagle-like creatures who are usually involved in the military. Before he leaves, Monroe finds a vintage Akeley film camera and a Kineclair projector. Aunt Marie must have used these somehow. Monroe says his great-uncle Olaf was a newsreel editor in Berlin in the 1920s.

The Captain is seen in his apartment getting ready for bed. He has the coin in his hand and seems to be gaining power from them. He then goes to bed, putting the coins on his nightstand (in the open). In his dream, he wakes in the night and goes out to his balcony. He hears faint cheering, so he opens the sliding door. Looking out from his balcony, the captain sees a massive crowd in downtown Portland cheering. Some people are holding huge flags with a lion head on them. The lion head is the same one on the coins. The crowd cheers him on as if he is their leader.

Captain Renard shows up the next day in full uniform. He orders a press conference for 2 PM, all personnel are required to attend. Nick searches for the coins in the evidence depository. He is unable to find then, only finding the box that contained them, which is now empty. The evidence officer says either Renard did not take anything in or did not fill out the log. The officer has to kick Nick out so they can go the press conference; Nick keeps the box. At the conference, Hank is there and asks Nick if he found the coins. Officer Brenner is also in attendance, but he looks strikingly similar to Soledad Marquesa. The press think Renard's speech is to launch a political campaign, such as his intentions to run for mayor, but he says it's just a warning to any would-be criminals.

With Soledad Marquesa still at large, Nick and Hank go to his last known location: a hotel room. No one is there, but they do find some clothes and a suitcase. The suitcase contains a film reel with film in it and two letters concerning the coins. One letter is in German from 1943 and the other is in English from 1945. The one in English from the Office of Strategic Services is about the coins. It says that the coins are made of gold, arsenic, and mercury. They are not to be handled, they were transferred in a lead box to an allied headquarters' vault. Ten coins were thought to exist, however they only found three. Hank is convinced that the coins made him act strangely; he also suspects that the Captain has them in his possession.

Hank decides to search for the coins himself in Renard's office. When he is searching, Nick bursts in with Farley Kolt, who was just cleared in the murder investigation. Kolt knows Soledad must be here, and he's hunting down Renard for the coins. Soledad gets into the parking garage and causes a blackout by destroying the breaker. Just as Hank, Nick and Kolt arrive, Soledad takes hold of Renard. A gun fight ensues; Nick helps Renard, but the coins and Kolt are gone. Hank manages to shoot Soledad, he lays on the floor near death. Nick asks Soledad if he killed his parents but Soledad dies before he can answer.

Later, Nick finds Farley Kolt in his hotel room. He tells Farley to put the coins on the bed and leave. Just as he is about to lunge for Nick, Nick hits him hard with his gun; Farley drops the coins. Nick quickly retrieves them and tells him to forget about the coins forever. Nick goes back to the trailer where he examines the coins. Just as he can feel the coins' magic spell start, Nick quickly puts them back in their box. He then stuffs the box behind another bigger box in the weapons cabinet.

Nick loads the film he got from Kolt onto the old Kineclair projector. As he hand cranks the film, it turns out to be old video from the 1940s showing Adolf Hitler giving a speech. The Coins of Zakynthos are visible on Hitler's coat collar. Hitler then woges into a Blutbad."

When they go in, they notice someone else has come before them. They tell the other person to leave and they will forget they were ever there. While looking for the other copper thief, they hear fire coming from a blowtorch. Suddenly a strange gas fills the area and they can't breathe. A huge fireball suddenly erupts, engulfing the two men in flames. The source is revealed to be a creature.

Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive at the scene accompanied by Wu. They go into the basement of the warehouse to see the two dead bodies. Jordan Vance, the fire investigator, tells them that whatever set them ablaze had to get hot really fast. It was not gasoline, since there was no gasoline odor. Nick and Hank then go to talk to the building's owner, he says this is the third building the copper thieves have hit. Hank then spots an oily substance on the ground. Touching it with his hand, he borrows a lighter and a small fireball erupts briefly then dies out.

At the Precinct, Jordan tells Captain Renard that the oily substance Hank found was a mixture of human fat and methane. Renard is surprised it is human fat because it is nearly impossible to get at huge amounts, like the that found at the crime scene. Jordan says he will run the substance to see if any DNA results come up. Wu then interrupts to tell them a witness has just come in. The witness says he saw a man run in front of his car last night. After he saw the news report about two people dying, he came forward. He said the man had a scraggly beard and hair and a large scar on the right side of his face. The man was wearing a long jacket and appeared homeless. The man looked scared and continued running. After talking with the police sketch artist, they come up with an accurate picture of the suspect. Wu then comes to tell them a 9-1-1 call was placed by the owner of the buildings, he said someone attacked him.

Wu, Nick and Hank cautiously arrive at the scene of the crime. The same suspect is now in another warehouse, Nick tells everyone to use walkie-talkies to alert one another to where he is. While looking for him, Wu gets sprayed with an oily substance and it is hard for him to breathe. Nick and Hank quickly go over to help Wu. Just then, the homeless guy ignites the gas and they all scramble to find cover. Nick catches a glimpse of him wogeing into a dragon creature. The suspect got away, but the ID report came back. Their suspect is Fred Eberhart, a homeless veteran who also worked as a welder. The only family member living in Portland that Fred has is his daughter Ariel Eberhart. Nick calls her listed phone number; he gets an answering machine for a nightclub.

Since the club is on Nick's way home, Nick pays a visit. While inside, he spots a male Eisbiber and a female Fuchsbau in the audience. He also sees Monroe, so he goes to talk to him. Nicks tells Monroe that Ariel's dad might have burned some people to death and that he's a creature. Monroe tells Nick that Fred is a Dämonfeuer, a dragon-like creature. Outside the club, Monroe tells Nick that Dämonfeuers like to capture princesses and have their lovers come back to sacrifice everything. He also tells Nick he got a call from his cousin that a Grimm was beheaded near the Schoonselhof in Antwerp, they have not found his head--it was probably reapers. Monroe tells Nick to watch his back; Nick then goes to talk to Ariel.

When Nick goes to question Ariel, she immediately notices that he is a Grimm. She also tries to make unwelcome advances towards Nick. She says she has been out of contact with her father for several years and does not know where he lives. After Fred Eberhart's wife died, Fred fell apart-he blamed himself for his wife's death. Nick gives her his phone number in case she gets any more information on her dad. Still suspicious, Nick follows her home.

At Ariel's house, Nick hears her coughing, so he goes to the side of the house to investigate. She suddenly appears and tackles Nick to the ground, ripping open his shirt. Ariel starts kissing Nick just as his phone starts ringing. The tackle made it come out of Nick's pocket. Ariel answers the phone with Juliette on the other end. She makes it seem to Juliette like Nick is cheating on her. Nick angrily snatches the phone from Ariel and starts to explain to Juliette; but she hangs up angrily. Nick then leaves despite Ariel's pleas to stay.

Back at the house, Nick explains the whole situation to Juliette. He says that he met Ariel when following up on a case involving her father. He went to her house to talk with her about her dad, that is when she assaulted him. Nick did not arrest her because she is the only person who knows anything about her dad. His phone was dislodged from his pocket when Nick was tackled. Juliette then believes Nick that it was an accident. Ariel appears and sprays the fluid on a window in Nick's house and draws a broken heart. Later that night, Ariel visits her father and tells him she's found someone that will make him better.

The next day, Ariel calls Nick to tell him to come by her house tonight so she can help find her father. Nick then calls Juliette to tell her he is going back to her house and Hank will be accompanying him. Nick and Hank arrive at Ariel's house to find that no one is home. Hank breaks the glass on the front door to open it to get inside the house. No one is inside either; the house is covered in copper (mainly wire). They then hear lightning sounds from the static electricity equipment on the top of the house; they decide to leave. Nick goes home early to find clothes on the staircase. As Nick gets in bed for a night with Juliette, he sees she has a tattoo. He realizes that Ariel is in his bed, not Juliette; what has she done to Juliette? Nick grabs his gun, but quickly ducks for cover when Ariel breathes fire. He chases her out of the house, but she's already gone. Nick's phone rings, it turns out to be Ariel on Juliette's phone, she says it's time for search and rescue.

As Ariel drags a bound up Juliette into a railroad cart, she continues to tell Nick that she has lost hope for her father until she found him. She tells Nick that it's time to face up and fight your Dämonfeuer, just as Ariel and Juliette enter the cave. Nick recruits Monroe to help him, after explaining it to Monroe, he says Ariel took Juliette to the dragon's lair. They then determine the lair is in a tunnel on an abandoned mining railroad line. Since it will take hours to walk down the tracks, Monroe and Nick look for other options. Monroe spots a vintage Freemont streetcar, and because he collects model railroads, he gets it running in no time.

Nick and Monroe cautiously approach the tunnel with a plan, Monroe will rescue Juliette while Nick fights the dragon and buys time. The battle with Fred Eberhart is tough for Nick, he has to duck multiple times to avoid being burned. Nick grabs a copper pole, to defend himself. Monroe carefully approaches Juliette, telling her that he is a friend of Nick's. When Ariel unties Juliette, telling her to scream, she punches and kicks Ariel, then she quickly escapes with Monroe. Fred Eberhart is about ready to burn Nick to death when Nick stabs a copper pole through his abdomen. Fred falls down, near death. Ariel rushes to him saying, ""You fought valiantly daddy."" They all leave as Ariel spits out the flammable substance (lipids) while spinning in a circle. She recites a poem before igniting the lipids.

They all meet outside, where Nick hugs Juliette. Monroe introduces himself to Juliette saying he's a ""private investigator"". Monroe and Juliette shake hands before everyone goes home. On the way home, Juliette asks Nick to stop the car. Juliette is visible upset and tells Nick that she's not sure she can tolerate the stress of Nick's job. She does not want to make a decision tonight, it is definitely something they both need to think about.

While Juliette is talking to Nick, he has a flashback about what his Aunt Marie said relating to Juliette-""I know you love Juliette, but you have to end it and never see her again."" He is starting to realize that what Marie said is starting to come true. As Juliette states that she is glad Ariel is dead, Ariel is seen leaving the cave where she was thought to have died."

Renard says his family used to own it during the 17th century, however they lost it along with some heads during the Revolution (which may refer to the French Revolution in which, during a period known as the Reign of Terror, many people lost their heads to the guillotine). Renard then asks how it has been going with Hank. Adalind says Hank is not interested in her. Renard hands over a vial of blood saying Hank just had his physical. Renard tells Adalind to do whatever it takes to make Hank like her.

Back at Nick's House, Nick and Juliette are eating dinner when Juliette says she wants to learn to shoot a gun. Just then, there is a knock at the door. Nick opens it to find Bud. Nick reminds him that he told him never to come back, Bud says not to take it the wrong way. He says they are sorry for all the things that have happened (All of the Eisbibers watching them and possibly Oleg Stark breaking in) and give them a gift. He assures them they will not be bothered; Nick and Juliette go back in the house and Juliette is wondering how the refrigerator repairman will keep people from bothering them. Nick tells her that the license plate they wrote down (the truck) was parked in a house which Bud was in. They open the gift to find a quilt.

Two Skalengecks inhale drugs through a huge horn-like pipe. After the potent drug gets them high, the two men leave to get more. Adalind arrives at the spice shop operated by Freddy. She hands him a list and tells him to make sure that the ingredients are fresh. Freddy gets the ingredients and hands them to Adalind, but realizing what she is, tells her that it's on the house. After she leaves, the same two men barge in. One turns his sign from open to closed and the other confronts him. They demand pharmaceutical grade Jay. Freddy says that it is in the basement. The two men head down there after beating him to the ground. On the floor, Freddy glances up to see the alarm system keypad. He pushes the emergency police button, setting off the alarm. The two men realize that the police will be there soon, and only take what they can carry. On the way out, Freddy woges into his Fuchsbau form and bites one of the men's leg. With his leg bitten, the guy shoots Freddy multiple times, killing him.

Nick, Hank, and Wu arrive at the crime scene. They find Freddy's dead body with lots of blood around it. Hank finds a piece of skin inside Freddy's mouth, he must have taken a bite out of his killer. They suspect he was dealing drugs ""under the table"" since his spices that are sold upfront are not worth that much. They then decide to have all the spices tested to see if any are illegal.

Nick contacts the shop owner's next of kin, Rosalee Calvert. She lives in Seattle and says that she will come down to Portland just to bury her brother and close the shop. At the police station, Rosalee requests to go to the shop. Nick decides to go with her. At the shop, Nick sees Rosalee woge into a Fuchsbau like her brother. When Rosalee realizes Nick is a Grimm, she is frightened. Nick reassures her that he won't hurt her and that he didn't kill her brother, he is only trying to catch his murderers. He explains his previous encounter with Freddie, who was being supplied by Geiers with medicinal remedies made from human organs, before Nick shut him down. Nick's first thought was that the Geiers retaliated against Freddie, but he isn't sure. Rosalee says she will inventory the contents of Freddie's shop and determine if there is anything worth killing over. Nick gives her his card, telling her to call if she finds anything out or needs anything. As he is leaving, Rosalee admits that Nick is not at all what she expected a Grimm to be.

Adalind is at her house baking cookies. She reads the recipe, which turns out is more of a potion. It calls for blood of the deceiver and blood of the deceived. Adalind then adds some of Hank's blood from the vial and a drop of hers. Later, she drops by Hank's house just as he is arriving home. She gives him the basket full of chocolate chip cookies as a thank you for saving her life. Hank, flattered by the kind gesture, takes a bite. He says they are very tasty. Adalind instructs him not to give them away, they were made just for him.

Nick then goes with the police lab reports to Monroe's house. With all the scientific names, Monroe can't pick out which spices are used as drugs. Nick decides to have Monroe look at all the spices in the shop's basement. At the shop, Nick introduces Monroe to Rosalee as an acquaintance of her brother. Looking through the boxes in Freddie's storeroom, Monroe comes across jars of Jaycene, or ""Jay"" as it is known in the Wesen world. He explains that it is derived from a particular type of mold, and normally lethal to humans, but acts as a very potent painkiller for Wesen. However, if used for ""recreational"" purposes, it is the equivalent of Meth mixed with rat poison and helium - very bad for the brain and liver, but horribly addictive. As Monroe and Nick start to leave, Rosalee stops Monroe and woges into her Fuchsbau form. Monroe woges too; Rosalee wanted to make sure Monroe really knew her brother. She asks Nick whether any of his police colleagues know he is a Grimm, and he says no. She admits to being a little bewildered at the situation: a Grimm with a Blutbad friend/ally. Sheepishly, Monroe says, ""it's complicated.""

Juliette arrives home at night and hears the door rattling. She looks out to find Bud fixing the door. They both scare each-other, Bud says he has fixed the door and hands her a basket. The basket has a cherry pie in it, he says his wife bakes the best pies. He also tells her the basket does not need to be returned, his kids made it. He then grabs his toolbox and leaves.

Rosalee is in the basement looking at boxes when suddenly the two robbers/Jay addicts burst in. She hides behind a corner, but her cover is blown when her cell phone rings. While trying to escape, she has to stab Joshua Hall with a box cutter and bar the doors shut. Nick then gets a call and takes her to the police station, where she identifies the two robbers, from mug shots, as Clint Vickers and Joshua Hall. Glancing around at the other police officers, she asks Nick how he manages to balance being a cop and being a Grimm. Nick shrugs and says he just does what he can. Rosalee says she understands: all Wesen have to deal with living two lives, and it's not easy. Nick suggests that he send a uniformed cop to stay with her at her brother's house, but she requests Monroe instead.

Monroe arrives at Rosalee's brother's house, he is given the couch to sleep on. The next morning, Rosalee says she is going back to the shop, so Monroe goes too.

Hank's love potion cookies seem to be working he has hallucinations/dreams of Adalind in the shower. The next day, Hank comes to work with a cookie. Wu wants a piece, using an anecdote about his mother always sharing her cookies, but Hank stares him down as an obvious no. Unfortunately, Hank and Nick have to go to track down the criminals (where Hank has another vision of Adalind which makes them lose them) and he leaves his cookie. With Nick and Hank gone, Wu decides to steal the cookie and walks away eating it. Wu then goes to the shop to check on Rosalee, he arrives sweating and out of breath. He then passes out and his face swells with welts.

Monroe calls Nick to tell him that Wu just walked in and passed out, Nick leaves the apartment crime scene to go check on Wu. Monroe and Rosalee work to create an herbal remedy with Keim extract, Rosalee says she has seen this before, when she was 17. Just as Nick arrives, Rosalee puts some of the antidote on Wu's face. To make the herbs work faster, they have Wu drink it. Wu then has weird hallucinations that everyone's face is melting off, Rosalee puts a cloth on Wu's face so he does not see anymore.

After about 30 minutes, they take the cloth off of Wu's face. His face is back to normal, except some scars. Since he will be unconscious for about another 8 hours, they decide to take him to his apartment so he will wake up in familiar surroundings. In his apartment, Rosalee says it is an effect of a Zaubertrank 23 potion. If the right person takes it, they get an deep emotional response; but if the wrong person takes it, an allergic reaction happens. Rosalee says that the people who broke into the shop the other night were looking for Jay. She says she was hooked for seven years and that she knows some dealers to help track down the killers. She meets a guy and asks for two tickets.

Nick and Monroe decide to go into the Trauminsel. Once inside they search the tents for Clint and Joshua. Nick finds Clint, and gunfire ensues. All of the participants run out of the warehouse onto the street. Monroe finds Joshua and chases after him, but once they get outside, Joshua turns a gun on Monroe. Luckily, Rosalee is there and knocks the guy out with a brick.

Wu is awake in his apartment late in the evening, Nick is there and is talking to Wu. He tells Nick that he just walked into the shop and woke up in his apartment. He says he had pretty weird dreams but does not go into detail (one might be the one where everyone's face was melting). Nick then asks Wu if he would like him to bring some food, Wu says he has plenty of food. Once Nick leaves, Wu unzips his couch cushion and rips off a chunk of the stuffing and eats it.

Rosalee is at the shop when Monroe comes in. He has a bouquet of flowers and hands them to her. He says they are for saving his life and that he knows it's not equal trade. Rosalee says she plans to stay in Portland, and decides to reopen the shop. Monroe is glad, he says he has the rest of the day off and would like to help put things up in the shop.

Juliette and Nick are at the shooting range where Juliette gets every shot near the middle. Nick asks if she's sure she's never done this before. The episode closes with Hank having another dream/hallucination of Adalind."

Nick wants to make sure he is not needed during the upcoming weekend. Nick then asks Hank if he thinks that Juliette will say no. Hank says she won't say no to a romantic weekend; since that is not what Nick meant, he pulls out the ring. Hank is surprised Nick is going to propose, Nick then gives him the brochure of where he is staying at (Whispering Pines).

Next to the Whispering Pines welcome sign on the side of the road, Robin Steinkellner is on the phone. She asks the man on the other end when he will pick her up. The man tells Robin that his car broke down and he is waiting for a tow. He tells her he will be ready tomorrow. Robin then starts making her way back home. When she arrives back at her house, she looks to see if anyone is there. When she turns around her husband, Tim Steinkellner, is there. He is upset with her and asks her why she is outside. She says she wanted fresh air. They both woge into their Wesen forms; Tim tells her, ""It's time to eat,"" and he takes her inside. Robin does not want to eat, but despite that, Tim starts to make her a shake out of worms, yogurt with broccoli and milk.

Back at the station, Hank is looking up info on Adalind Schade. He looks intently at her pictures and pulls up a map of the location of her apartment. Wu walks in and asks Hank if he has any weekend plans. Hank says he does not have any plans and asks if Wu does. Wu says he plans to sit on his couch with his cat Samson and watch ""The Apprentice"" while eating. Wu then proceeds to take a paperclip out of its cup and eat it.

Nick and Juliette are in their car on a narrow rural road, they pass a sign that says ""Whispering Pines"". Since Nick is unable to locate to road which leads to their cabin, he stops at a red farmhouse. He asks the man inside where the road is, the man says a drunk driver knocked down the sign a week ago. Back in the car, Juliette notices a sad woman looking out the window and finds it unsettling. Nick hears something fall in the house, then Tim Steinkellner (the man) yells at Robin, Nick sees him woge into an alley cat.

Later in the evening, Juliette sees Robin struggling with Tim outside. After Tim forcible takes Robin inside, she calls Nick over. To make Juliette calm down, Nick calls the local sheriff to report a domestic disturbance. The sheriff arrives, but he quickly goes in and back out to leave. He does not arrest Tim. After the sheriff drives away, Juliette is distraught and wonders why he did not arrest Tim. Juliette then comments that trouble is seeming to follow them, hearing that, Nick has a flashback of Oleg Stark breaking in and Fred Eberhart holding Juliette captive. Juliette wants to talk about all those situations, but Nick says he does not why things are happening.

Since Robin won't voluntarily eat her health shake, Tim says he has no choice but to strap her into a chair. He then puts a feeding tube in her mouth and food in the other end. He turns it on and the piston starts pushing the food into the tube. Sheriff Munson arrives just as Tim is in the middle of feeding Robin.

Back in Portland, Hank is becoming more obsessed with Adalind. He is even spying on her apartment. To see if she will answer his call, he calls Adalind, he sees through the window that Adalind recognizes the number but refuses to answer it. Just then, another man, Peter, walks up to Adalind's apartment and kisses her. He then goes inside the house and they both go into another room. After waiting for the man to leave, he tells him at gunpoint never to come back. The clearly angry man gets into his car and drives away. He is later seen talking to Renard in a car, so this was clearly planned by Renard.

Nick quietly calls Monroe late at night so Juliette won't hear. Monroe is a bit surprised and irked that Nick would call him at 2:30 am. Nick then describes what Tim looked like when woged. He said that he is not a lion nor a tiger but is not like a house cat, he is somewhere in-between. Monroe understands from the definition that he is a Klaustreich. They are total jerks; but women love them. He then tells Nick that Molly, Monroe's girlfriend in high school, left Monroe for a Klaustreich. The Klaustreich got her pregnant and she had his ""litter"" at prom. Her parents were upset and they got the police involved; as a parting gift he gave Molly a slash on the face. The police did not catch him, but Monroe says somebody did (probably himself).

The next day, Nick tells Juliette his plan for the day. He will take her to downtown Whispering Pines to go shopping in as many stores as she wants, then they will go grocery shopping for their romantic (proposal) dinner. At the grocery store, Robin is secretly talking to one of the employees. The employee says he will try to pick her up later in the day and will give her some money. Robin is trying to get away from Tim by going out of town where he will never find her. At the same store, Juliette bumps into Robin. After introducing themselves, Juliette gives Robin her phone number, just in case she is in trouble. Tim then tells Robin that it is time to leave and she makes her way to the register. Gary, the clerk/product stocker, is stocking shelves when in the background, Tim starts getting closer to him. Although they never talk or make physical contact, Tim definitely has his eye on Gary. Seltenvogel Woge - Robin Steinkellner

Nick is getting coffee when he sees Robin woge into a bird with golden plumage. Nick goes outside to call Monroe. Back at Rosalee's spice shop, Monroe is helping Rosalee stock the shelves. Monroe answers the call from Nick, who wonders if Monroe knows anything about a Wesen like Robin. Monroe asks if Nick is joking, because what he is describing sounds like a Seltenvogel, which are so rare that most Wesen believe them to be extinct. In ancient times, they were highly valued, but kept prisoner like concubines. Rosalee overhears and pulls a book from her brother's collection. Together they explain that, once in his or her life, a Seltenvogel's glands produce a dense mineral deposit, known as an Unbezahlbar, which is highly prized by Wesen, both for being incredibly rare, and also for being composed mostly of gold. Monroe is alarmed to hear that the Klaustreich Nick encountered is the Seltenvogel's husband: it is a safe bet that once Tim gets the stone, he will most likely kill Robin as being of no further use to him.

After Monroe hands up, Rosalee finds multiple passports from different countries, all bearing her brother's photo, but under different names). She has no idea why her brother would have these.

Adalind is getting out of the shower when Renard sneaks into her apartment to talk about Hank. He tells her it is time to stop ignoring Hank; the next time he calls, answer it. Despite being uncertain, she agrees to go ahead with the plan. Renard tells her, ""Just be who you aren't."" Sure enough, Hank calls and is surprised to hear Adalind's voice. She claims she was busy and had 18 hour work days and says tomorrow would be a good time to go to dinner. They both agree that they will have dinner tomorrow.

Robin is fixing Tim some tea when he gets a call. The person on the other end says he needs a tow. Tim says he does not know how long it will take and leaves. Just after his car is gone, Robin quickly runs outside. This was a plan made by Gary to give Robin the opportunity to leave; she had better hurry, if Tim gets there first, Robin would not get to leave. At that same time, Nick and Juliette are back from shopping. Juliette sees Robin leave and pleads Nick to follow her. He agrees and tells Juliette to stay home, the romantic dinner will have to wait.

On a forest service road, Gary is waiting to pick up Robin. After hearing some rustling in the woods, he thinks it is Robin and tells her to hurry. Instead of Robin, Tim pounces out of the bush in his Klaustreich form. Robin arrives at Gary's car only to see his dead body fall onto her lap, the face clawed and bloody. She jumps out of the car, running into Tim, who tells her that she should never have come and takes her back to the house for another feeding.

Nick is on Robin's trail and finds Gary's truck off the road, covered by some vegetation. Knowing that it is most likely a cover-up, Nick looks into the car to find Gary dead. He calls the sheriff and tells him there has been a homicide, the sheriff will be at the scene soon. Seeing this, Nick knows Robin is in danger, and quickly makes his way back to the farmhouse.

Back at the farmhouse, Tim straps Robin into the chair. He examines her Unbezahlbar and determines that it is ready to ""hatch"". Nick arrives and points his gun at Tim, he woges and Nick says he knows he is a Klaustreich. Knowing Nick can't both attack him and turn off the machine, Tim then turns the dial to high speed and attacks. Nick eventually overpowers Tim, silences the machine, and unstraps a weak and grateful Robin.

Nick then takes Robin to the cabin Nick and Juliette are staying in. Juliette goes to get a coughing Robin some water. Robin questions why Nick is helping her since he is a Grimm. Nick tells her not to talk about it here. Trying to comfort Robin, Nick tells her that Sheriff Munson is on his way. Robin reveals the frightening information that the sheriff is Tim's cousin, a fellow Klaustreich, and a willing accessory to her captivity. As Munson arrives and the two Klaustreichs advance on the cabin. Panicked, Robin runs away while Nick pursues. Juliette, meanwhile, grabs her own gun and sneaks away to call the state authorities. Munson tells Tim that Nick is a cop and Tim tells Munson that Nick is a Grimm. Knowing they will be in the cabin, they set out to look for them. Robin and Nick do not get far, Robin collapses in the forest, the Unbezahlbar is blocking her windpipe. She pleads with Nick to remove it, and since he does not know how to, he FaceTimes Rosalee. Rosalee tells him to cut in a vertical line right where the skin is tight. After that, you must put your hand in the incision and ""pop"" the Unbezahlbar out of place. He does that and takes the ""egg"" out. Monroe and Rosalee are both amazed, Nick says he will call them back after the situation calms down. Robin is now able to breathe much easier. Nick offers her the ""egg"", but she wants no part of it, saying it is responsible for most or all of the misery she has suffered at Tim's hands.

Right as Nick is about to take Robin to safety since she can now breathe, Sheriff Munson and Tim Steinkellner arrive. Though they are both armed, Tim and Munson are both nervous about the fragility of the stone, and Nick taunts them by tossing it from hand to hand, knowing that one careless shot and the stone will be worthless. Munson tries to bargain with Nick, even offering him a piece of the money. For answer, Nick tosses the stone high into the air and, as both Tim and Munson look skyward, Nick tackles Munson. Tim drops his gun to catch the stone in both hands and takes off running. Juliette appears, having circled around behind the men, and fires into the air. Nick subdues Munson and tells Juliette to keep her gun on him while he runs after Tim.

Nick is close on Tim's heels, and Tim makes the mistake of looking over his shoulder while running, tripping on a tree branch in his path. The stone goes flying into the air, hits a tree branch and shatters. Tim watches desolately as worthless flakes of gold flutter to the ground, and offers no resistance as Nick arrests him. Nick cheerfully quips, ""Well, you know what they say, Tim: if you want to make an omelet, you've gotta break a few eggs.""

Hank and Adalind having dinner at a French restaurant

Back at home, since Nick did not have time on their weekend getaway, Nick proposes to Juliette. She turns him down. Although she loves him and would like to marry him, she feels like Nick has closed himself off and has been keeping things from her. While a distraught Nick goes to another room, wondering what he will tell her, Juliette opens the box to study the ring.

The episode ends with Hank and Adalind having dinner at a French restaurant."

In all the haste, Nick spills a bottle of ink onto the key. Seeing a pattern imprinted on his fingers, he presses the key onto a piece of paper. The pattern looks like it is missing something. Just then, Juliette calls Nick, reminding him not to be late for their dinner with Adalind and Hank.

At the police station, Captain Renard is getting in his car. Just then, a gun is pressed against his neck by Thomas Woolsey. Renard knows him because he is his cousin's bodyguard; Renard's cousin wants to meet him. At an abandoned warehouse parking lot, Renard's cousin says that the family wants action. Renard tells him that he has been calculating his moves carefully. His cousin cautions him, if he does not give them the Nick's key, the family will take the Grimm and find it themselves. Renard then grabs Woolsey's gun and shoots his cousin, Anton Krug, and Woolsey. He then drives off.

When Nick arrives at the restaurant, he remembers that Hank's date is the same person that tried to kill Aunt Marie. Nick does not want to have dinner with Adalind and keeps throwing hints to what Adalind really is. After Adalind excuses herself to the restroom, Nick follows her. He confronts her in the stairway telling her to stay out of Hank's life. She threatens to scream if Nick does not let her go, and she tells Nick that there is nothing that can stop her. An angry Nick is in the restroom when Hank comes in. Hank asks what is going on with Nick and Nick says it's an issue between him and Juliette. Hank tells Nick that he got a call about a murder and Nick says he has to take Juliette home then he will go to the scene.

At the scene, Nick and Hank are greeted by Wu. After applying chapstick to his lips, Wu decides to take a bite. Nick is shocked and asks Wu why he did that, Wu responds like nothing happened. Wu thinks that the two men shot each other, but they will need to investigate. Hank asks Nick how this one will turn out. Nick thinks Hank is talking about the murder but Hank is really talking about him and Adalind. Nick says that Hank and Adalind's relationship will not work out. Hank spots a cell phone under the call and asks another investigator for a baggie. The cell phone might help the police find the murderer. Wu then eats the rest of his chapstick.

Renard is at Catherine Schade's house. He reassures her that if her daughter brings Renard the key, Catherine's debt will be paid. After she inquires what Renard will do after he has the key, Renard replies, ""those who help will be remembered and rewarded. Those who don't will be forgotten."" As Renard leaves, Catherine looks into a mirror; Renard tells her not to look in the mirror too much.

Back at the station, Wu decides to buy a soda from a vending machine. Upon receiving the soda and some change, Wu decides to eat some coins and wash it down with soda. Hank and Nick are talking with Renard and going over the evidence they have compiled so far. Nick suspects that there might be a second vehicle that drove away, carrying a third man. Hank says they found a cell phone at the scene. Renard, looking concerned, asks if they have accessed the data on it yet. They say they have to send it to the lab since it won't turn on and probably broke when it hit the ground. Wu meets Hank and Nick and tells them info on the airline records that he has reviewed. Wu says that both of the victim's guns were checked in with customs, so both guns ""knew each other."" Noticing Wu is not himself, Hank says that it is late and they can pick up the investigation in the morning. Hank is tired and mad he had to cut his date with Adalind short.

As Hank leaves, Nick tells him that he will take the phone down to evidence. Alone with Wu, Nick asks him if he is feeling okay. Wu admits that he has been having some stomach problems and has been gaining weight. Nick then suggests that it was something that Wu has been eating. Wu says he has been eating okay. Wu then tells Nick that he is going to pass out. He then passes out on the floor, everyone rushes to help him. Nick tells someone to call a medic over, as he tries to do CPR. Since everyone is distracted helping Wu, Renard sees the opportunity to snatch the cell phone. When no one is looking and puts the phone in his pocket.

Adalind arrives home after the short dinner with Hank, Nick, and Juliette. After putting up her coat, she senses an intruder is in her house and woges into her Hexenbiest form. The intruder also woges into a Hexenbiest. Adalind recognizes that it is her mom and greets her. When her mom asks her how things are going, Adalind says that her mission involves getting the key from Nick, a Grimm. Her mom tells her that she must succeed and asks her if she still loves Renard. Adalind says that she still loves him. Adalind's phone rings and it's Hank. Hank wants to have dinner with her tonight, Adalind says she can't since her mom is with her and they have not talked in a long time. She says she can have dinner tomorrow. Hank is satisfied, since he is spying on her outside her window, and agrees to have dinner tomorrow.

At the hospital, Nick gets news on Wu's condition. The nurse comes over with a plate full of all the stuff he ate. She says he has Pica, a disorder that causes someone to eat inedible items. It could be caused by stress, he definitely needs to get help. Nick visits Monroe to discuss Hank's infatuation with Adalind. Monroe says that she could certainly have done something to Hank. After prompting from Nick he calls Rosalee as she knows more about that sort of thing than he does.

Later, Renard is seen with gloves on at his desk. He opens the phone and removes the SIM card and the battery. He then inserts a new SIM card. Once everyone has left the station, Renard puts the phone back on Nick's desk before he leaves for the night.

Nick, Monroe, and Rosalee go to the spice shop to research what Adalind could have given to Hank. Rosalee finds the list that Adalind gave Freddy (""Island of Dreams"") and says that it's for a very dangerous recipe which can make someone go from very in love to very dead. When Monroe and Rosalee are researching on their own, they speculate that same potion may be responsible for Wu's condition.

Back at Adalind's house, she is wearing leeches on her face under the direction of her mother to make herself more beautiful.

The next day Adalind calls Hank at work to ask him for dinner at her place that night. Renard is at Adalind's house and tells her that she is very powerful.

The CSU tech returns the cell phone and reports that the cell phone is completely blank. Nick tries to discuss this with Hank, but Hank is completely distracted by the thought of dinner with Adalind.

Rosalee discovers the the potion is La mort pour l'amour.

Nick goes to talk to Captain Renard about the case, and explains his theory about there being a third man involved and theorizes the truth of the event to Renard. Renard says the families of the victims have strong political connections in Europe and that they will have to let this one go. Before Nick can reply he receives a call from Monroe telling him that he needs to get to the Spice Shop, because if Hank has taken what they think he's taken he is ""knocking on heaven's door.""

At the spice shop, Rosalee explains what they have found and agree that it's also what is affecting Wu. Rosalee mixes the cure and says that it has to be administered nasally using a nez-soufflet. They decide to try the cure first on Wu.

When they arrive, Wu is at home eating his carpet, so they break in. Wu then starts convulsing and they put him on the settee and administer the cure. Wu arches his back a couple of times, then his skin turns red, and then he returns to normal. He wakes up, spits out some carpet and is very confused and embarrassed since he is in his underwear. As Wu rushes off to get dressed, Monroe says that he thinks it worked. Nick calls Hank to find out where he is, so they can administer the cure to him. Hank is just about to enter Adalind's house so he won't talk.

By the time they get there, Adalind has already left and Hank is in her bed unconscious. Rosalee tells Nick that because Hank and Adalind have had sex, the cure is useless and the only way to cure Hank is to kill the Hexenbiest whose blood was in the potion. Nick then gets a call from Adalind and she says that Hank will be dead by morning unless she gets the key. She tells him to bring the key to the Bremen Ruins. Rosalee tells Nick that he can't kill her as that won't break the hold she has on Hank. The only way to break the hold is with the blood of a Grimm, his blood, which will kill the Hexenbiest spirit within her.

Nick and Adalind meet, but instead of giving her the key he challenges her to fight. She agrees, and woges into her Hexenbiest form. During the fight she woges back into human form and Nick kisses her on the lips, forcing her to bite his lip and swallow some of his blood. The Hexenbiest spirit then leaves Adalind and Hank wakes up. Adalind tells Nick that he has killed her, she doesn't have any powers and is just like everybody else, that she is nothing. She walks away crying. Monroe calls Nick and says that Hank is okay and he's wondering what they are doing in Adalind's bedroom.

Adalind goes to her mother's house where her mother and Renard declare that she is useless to them now, just another pretty girl.

Later, Nick is in the trailer studying the map fragment printed by the key."

In a confrontation at a bus station, Ian takes a bullet in the shoulder but survives, leaving behind a duffel bag, which Waltz finds.

Waltz visits Captain Renard's house and requests Renard's assistance, but is turned down. Disappointed, Waltz shares that the High Command has not been pleased that so many of the Resistance have found a safe harbor in Portland. Threateningly, Waltz leaves him with a message in Latin: ""If you seek peace, prepare for war."" Hank and Nick investigate the shooting at the bus station. The bus driver identifies the passenger getting shot at as Ian and the police are able to make a photo identification.

Rosalee is grabbed by Ian as soon as she enters her spice shop in the morning. Alarmed at first, Rosalee quickly recognizes him. She gets the wounded Ian into bed and calls Monroe for help. After she explains to Monroe Ian's association with the Resistance, Monroe instantly makes the connection that the pursuers must be the Verrat, which worries him: ""They make the Spanish Inquisition look like the SPCA.""

Waltz uses his sources to find a Resistance bartender, a Lausenschlange who ""knows things."" Pretending to be in need of forged documents, Waltz gets information about a camera shop in downtown with that service. Waltz shoots Quinn for his trouble, leaving Ian's passport behind.

Later, Nick surveys the crime scene at the bar, and Waltz comes forward as a witness identifying Ian as the shooter. Nick sees him change into a Hundjäger and Waltz realizes that Nick is a Grimm.

As Ian heals up, Rosalee informs Monroe that she and Ian used to be an item years ago when the Blutbad shows distrust. She swears to a jealous Monroe that it is all in the past. Ian is hesitant when Monroe suggests they call in Nick, given his Grimm lineage. Both Wesen, however, testify to Nick's character and Ian begrudgingly agrees.

Renard offers advice when Nick and Hank have no luck on Ian's case. After they leave, Waltz calls and confirms that he's using the police to help him find Ian and that Nick is a Grimm saying that ""there's more to him than meets the eye"".

After hanging up on Renard, Waltz goes to the place the bartender gave him. There he puts on a guise before pulling out a gun. Terrified, the shopkeeper woges. Waltz threatens Reginald's family if the latter does not help him find Ian.

Nick arrives at the spice shop, and tries to arrest Ian based on the evidence at the shooting. Rosalee quickly explains the situation to a distrustful Nick, being Ian's alibi during and before the bartender was killed. After Nick is reassured that Ian is unarmed and clean, he finally lowers his gun.

Ian tells them about Edgar Waltz and the rapidly growing Verrat. Monroe adds that the Resistance, the Laufer, is the only thing in the Verrat's way, an organization Rosalee reveals that most of her family were a part of. Ian notes that Grimms decided to fight on the Verrat's side. Nick expresses his apathy to the politics - he just wants Ian out of the country, and is forced to turn a blind eye to them getting fake traveling papers.

Rosalee goes to Reginald with Ian's ID card, telling him that Ian was shot and that he needs papers. Reginald reluctantly takes it, looking nervously at the pictures of his children.

Nick finds a tape of the Verrat in the trailer and watches with horror at how the Verrat had once executed Wesen without trial when their only crime was marrying outside of their own race. Just after the movie, Waltz calls wanting to talk under the terms of a freidenreden about catching Ian Harmon.

Ian acknowledges that Monroe cares for Rosalee, but maintains his distrust in Grimms. Monroe rebuts that they're all equals - isn't that what he's fighting for?

Nick calls then, telling them about the conversation he had with Waltz. Ian explains that freidenreden is a white flag truce with no weapons and no fighting. He also says that Waltz has a high respect for the rules and will honor the truce, but only when Nick is present.

Nick meets Waltz the next day and Waltz admits to the murder of the bartender. Nick says that he will arrest Waltz the second the truce is over, but it turns out that they both have weapons. In the middle of the meeting, Reginald calls and turns Rosalee in. Waltz hangs up and says that if Nick attempts to follow him, he will shoot the first person he sees.

Nick and Hank go to Renard and Nick tells the Captain that the killer called him and admitted to the murder while also threatening innocents. They find the latest call by the number as Reginald's Cameras and head out.

Reginald gives Rosalee the passport and apologizes, covering it up as condolences for her brother's death. As she leaves, Waltz comes out from the back, assuring the safety of Reginald's family. As Waltz starts tracking Rosalee, the police pull up to the camera shop and find Reginald's dead body.

As Rosalee puts together the documents, Waltz comes in pretending to be a customer. She finds a note in the passport package that says ""I'm sorry. I had no choice. He is an agent of the Verrat,"" and is prepared when Waltz puts a gun to her back. She is forced to call Monroe. Waltz takes the phone and says that if he doesn't get Ian in fifteen minutes, he will kill Rosalee.

Monroe calls Nick and tells him about the situation. When they arrive at the shop, they debate over who should go in first. It is decided that Nick should.

Waltz is about to kill Rosalee when Nick enters and pretends to turn Ian in. Monroe then comes in saying he's the one Rosalee called, reassuring the horrified Rosalee of a plan. Nick and Monroe fake an argument. When Waltz asks Rosalee who she called, believing them all to be Fuchsbau, she says that she didn't call one. Monroe woges, stunning Waltz, and attacks.

After a scuffle, Ian shoots Waltz. Nick takes Ian to his car. Before they leave, Nick tells Monroe to get rid of Waltz's body. After Nick drives off, he uncuffs Ian, gives him the documents, telling him not to come back. Ian, believing he was being arrested, stares after the retreating Nick in wonder.

The police find Waltz's body and Renard suggests that someone else might catch up with Ian without them. The episode closes with a clip from earlier of Ian saying that the world is on the brink of war."

Later, he is carrying some of them through a forest, when Monroe, in his Blutbad form, tackles him to help Nick sharpen his Grimm skills. Nick is a bit put out, but Monroe points out that he needs to become better aware of his surroundings. After they both get up off the ground, Monroe reminds Nick he was supposed to apply wolfsbane to his clothes, but Monroe informs him that he didn't use enough and Monroe could still smell him a mile away. Nick shows Monroe the weapons: he needs to learn how to use them properly like his ancestors did because he can't just shoot everyone. For example, a few days earlier, he pepper-sprayed an unruly student who was actually a Skalengeck. Monroe says that the Skalengeck probably enjoyed the pepper spray. First, he shows the Doppelarmbrust, explaining that the hollow bolts used are filled with hellebore extract as a tranquilizer, and the other bolt is filled with lethal hemlock. Monroe then mentions that they were originally designed to take out Blutbaden. Nick fires a practice bolt at a hanging melon, then takes a swing at another with a Kanabo.

That night, Robert Grosszahn and Sal Butrell meet underneath a partially-constructed bridge. Robert woges into an Eisbiber after stepping out of his truck. Sal then demands money from Robert, but gets denied as Robert states that ""I will not pay you anymore"". Sal responds by shifting into a Hässlich and punching Robert in the gut to be able to drag him off.

Packing up shop for the night, Arnold Rosarot hears a noise and looks through a gap in the supplies. He sees Sal drowning Robert in cement. Arnold hurriedly calls 9-1-1, but is too late. Seeing Robert dead, he panics and knocks over a few objects. This alerts Sal who chases after Arnold through the construction site. Arnold manages to get ahead just enough to hop in his truck and drive away.

John Oblinger has fallen asleep in front of the TV in his living room when a noise awakens him. Grabbing a fire-poker, he goes down into his basement where the noise had come from. Arnold appears behind him and startles John. Both woge into Eisbibers and recognize each other. John asks Arnold what happened, but the latter begins to break down in tears.

Nick and Hank arrive at the scene of Robert's murder. There Wu tells them that the victim had apparently been drowned in cement. They go then to the victim's car where Hank finds Robert's phone, and that his last appointment was at 9:30 PM with someone with the initials of S. B. Dispatch then calls and tells them the identity of the witness, Arnold Rosarot. They then drive off to his place of residence.

Arriving there, they find the door unlocked and no one answers, so they enter the premises. They notice a lot of well-crafted whirly-gigs and Nick notices a fishing photo with Bud Wurstner, John and someone who he presumes is Arnold.

Nick returns home and is studying information about the suspect. Juliette walks in and notices that he wrote Eisbiber on the paper. She asks him what it is and he says it is a possible witness. She then goes on to say that she would like to invite Monroe to dinner. At first Nick objects, saying Monroe is a loner, but eventually, he gives in and agrees to ask.

He goes to Monroe's house the next morning. Nick tries to get Monroe to say he is sick, but Monroe states that will only work for one night and he wouldn't want to be rude by declining the offer. Nick states that there is nothing in their relationship that they could mention to Juliette, not even how they met. They eventually both decide to pick one story and stick to it through the dinner.

Nick then meets up with Hank at the Grosszahn Construction headquarters and they question Robert's secretary. She says that she had no knowledge of his 9:30 appointment or what S. B. stood for. She mentions that Robert had been arguing with Mr. Butrell at the planning commission.

At the planning commission, they're lead to Sal's office and question him. He states that he had an alibi for 9:30 last night, saying he was playing poker at the Trip Trap Social Club with six other people. When Nick mentions the 9:30 'S. B.' appointment on Robert's phone, Nick sees him woge into a Hässlich. Sal clearly has made Nick as a Grimm, but smoothly breaks eye contact with him and instead tells Hank that they were trying to work something out for 9:30 that morning, but Robert never got back to him and suggests that he entered the appointment wrong. Sammy comes into the office to tell Sal about a meeting. He then gets Sammy to confirm Sal's alibi. Nick and Hank then leave, satisfied that the questioning can't go any further at that time. Sal calls Herman in and tells them both that the one cop was a Grimm.

Having called ahead, Nick goes alone to Bud's shop to ask him if he had seen Arnold. Bud offers him some carrot cake his wife made but Nick declines. Bud says he has not seen him in weeks and Nick explains that he may have witnessed Robert's murder. Nick then shows him a picture of a Hässlich, which Bud identifies. He recalls that Arnold was working on a bridge for Robert. He explains that Hässlich believe that they own all bridges, so if one is being built they demand a cut from the construction company. It's a form of 'traditional' extortion; the Eisbibers don't like it, but it's always been that way. He reveals that most of the construction firms in Portland are Eisbiber-owned, and thus have to payout to Hässlich, the literal 'trolls'. Bud offers to go check a place where Arnold might be. He says if he is correct, he will carve a series of numbers into Nick's porch step, but Nick says that he can call him instead and leaves.

Back at home, Nick and Juliette finish setting up the table for dinner when Monroe arrives. After an awkward greeting, they settle down to eat. They tell Juliette about how Monroe helped with the Oleg Stark case by checking out the watch. Juliette then asks how they met and Nick says that Monroe helped identify a little girl's kidnapper through his boots. (""Pilot"") It then gets weird as Monroe deviates from the story and they struggle to fix the error. Monroe then quickly changes the subject by asking for the recipe for the vegan salmon.

Bud goes to John's house to ask about Arnold. He says that John's would be the first place Arnold would go in such an event as this and that he needs to talk to him. John complies and takes Bud into the basement. Arnold is upset that John would tell someone until he is reassured that it is only Bud. Bud then tries to get him to tell the police who he witnessed murder Robert, but Arnold refuses. He says that if he leaves that basement he will be killed. Bud tells him that they have 'the' Grimm on their side, which surprises Arnold. Bud continues to try to convince Arnold to come forward to no success. John then suggests they should be ""fair and democratic"" and bring it up at the Lodge, where Arnold can hear out Nick anonomously.

Sal meets with Sammy and Herman in the Trip Trap Club at night to discuss what to do about Nick. Sammy wants Herman and himself to leave town for a while, but Sal says they shouldn't. He then suggests that they deal with him by calling Reapers, to which both Sammy and Herman are hesitant about. Sal, however, says that in order to protect their interests they have no other choice.

Nick is helping Juliette clean up from dinner and asks her what she thought of Monroe, to which she replies he was one of the strangest people she has met. He then gets a call from Bud, saying to meet him at an old power plant for an emergency Lodge meeting and that Arnold will be there.

In Mannheim, Germany, a mysterious man sends two Reapers to Portland, Junkers and Reaper. They are to return with Nick's head.

Nick arrives at the power plant and is greeted by Bud. He takes him inside and asks him to tell the others what happened, and why he needs Arnold. Meanwhile, a plane lands in Portland and one of the Reapers calls Sal. They tell him they need to meet and tell him a time. The Eisbibers meet in their lodge. Most seem to want to leave the Hässlich alone. They put it to a vote, however, to be democratic. Sadly, the majority want to be safe and not go against them. The moderator then asks Nick to please not cut off their heads for not agreeing. Nick is disappointed that the Eisbibers won't stand up for themselves, but before leaving he thanks Bud for trying: he had hoped that the others would have the same kind of bravery that Bud showed while interacting with him.

Sal goes to meet the Reapers and is instead knocked unconscious and moved to an unknown location. They then interrogate him to see if he is working with Nick. Meanwhile, Bud visits John, lamenting the failure of the Lodge vote as Arnold listens in from the basement stairs. The case affects not just Arnold but all Eisbibers, and during the meeting, Bud recognized what they really are from Nick's viewpoint: cowards. For the first time, he's ashamed to be Eisbiber, which gives Arnold something to think about. At the precinct Nick and Hank go over the case with Sean Renard: they have no physical evidence on Sal and he has alibis. Without Arnold's cooperation they will lose the case, but just as they leave Renard's office, Bud and John arrive with Arnold, and with Bud's encouragement says he's ready to come forward. This gives them a reason to go after Sal.

The Reapers are still working Sal over, threating that if Sal doesn't deliver the Grimm to them, they'll kill him. Sal tells them that Nick is a cop; they ask if he expected them to be able to waltz into the precinct, ask for Nick and then behead him, but he figured that as they're the experts, they had such things covered. Just then, Nick calls Sal from a precinct phone, wanting him to come down for more questions. With a switchblade at his neck, Sal asks for the Reapers' benefit what happens if he doesn't want to, to which Nick answers that he'd be forced to send officers to make sure he does. Sal proposes they cut to the chase: they're both part of the Wesen world and they could have an off the record, face to face meeting and he'll make to worth Nick's while. He then states he'll be at the club in ten minutes; after the Reapers hang up for him, he tells them they ought to hurry over there. When Nick and Hank arrive at the Trip Trap Club and arrest Sal for the murder, the Reapers are in a car a short distance away, ready to follow Nick.

After Arnold identifies Sal in a lineup, Nick congratulates and thanks him for his bravery. He recommends that Arnold lay low for a while just in case, at which Bud suggests he stay at the Lodge. Nick offers to drive Arnold there himself and they leave with Bud and John following in Bud's truck. It's past sunset as they near the dam, at which Bud and John noticed the Reapers' headlights following them for the past ten minutes and call Nick to warn him. In the parking lot, Nick grabs the bag of Grimm weapons that was still in his car and they hurry into the generator room. Nick tells the Eisbibers to get downstairs to the Lodge and fights the Reapers himself. Immediately disarmed of his gun, he manages to get to his Kanabo and defends himself, beating back and disarming one before being disarmed himself by the other. Nick is forced back to avoid the deadly swings when he ducks one, and it accidentally decapitates the other Reaper that had stood up behind him. The Reapers' shock gives Nick enough time to grab the Doppelarmbrust from the bag and he kills the other with a bolt to the throat.

Monroe arrives with a shovel after being called by Nick and is stunned to identify the attackers as Reapers, examining a traditional inscription on the blade of one the scythes. He confirms Nick's suspicions that they'll keep coming until they kill him. Nick considers that he needs to send the Reapers a message and Monroe wholeheartedly agrees. Perhaps recalling the personal attack on himself, (""Of Mouse and Man"") Monroe states that when it comes to sending messages to Reapers, ""two heads are better than one"", before hefting the scythe he's holding and decapitating the other corpse.

The next day, Nick briefly visits Sal in lockup, asking if he's surprised to see him and stating that he met 'his friends'. On Sal asking what happened, Nick says he knows how it is: they got angry and ""kinda lost their heads.""

Nick returns home and finds a bewildered Juliette waiting on the porch. He asks what's wrong, and she replies, ""There's just so many."" She leads him inside and shows him the living room, now packed wall-to-wall with pies, fruit baskets, bread baskets, jars of homemade jam and preservatives, quilts, cake tins, bouquets of flowers, and various other gifts. Juliette says people have been dropping them off all day, and asks Nick what he did. Nick, knowing the entire Eisbiber lodge is giving thanks, shrugs and says, ""just my job.""

The episode ends with the 'distributor' of the reapers receiving a package via airmail with a note saying ""Next time, send your best."" He then goes through the packing styrofoam, only to drop the box out of shock upon finding the two Reaper heads inside."

But she refuses and is soon after murdered by a Murcielago - a bat-like creature that kills with a sonic scream.",[],TV-14,Release date,"[""Terrence O'Hara""]","['', '', '']",[],['in laws'],[],"A warrant is out for the arrest of Bernard Aidikoff for his involvement in a Ponzi scheme. He decides to shoot himself instead of getting arrested. Arthur Jarvis hears the news on the radio and panics. He calls Spencer Harrison, and the two agree to meet at Arthur's house. When he gets home, Arthur sees his wife, Lucinda trying on bunches of dresses, which means even more of his funds are depleted. Spencer arrives and Arthur tells him that all of his money was invested with Aidikoff, even the house. Spencer then suggests that they ask to borrow money from Mavis Kerfield, Lucinda's stepmother.

Mavis turns them down, however, because they have stayed away from the family for so long. Mavis sends them out, saying, ""Send my love to Lucinda."" Spencer stays a moment longer and mentions how without Lucinda's Dad, Mavis would still ""be cutting hair in Beaverton.""

That night, Mavis is settling down for bed when she hears a noise. Frightened, she looks under her bed to find a creature that claws her face. Mavis runs in fear through the halls, making it to the balcony overlooking the foyer. The creature catches up to her and emits a supersonic scream that breaks all of the nearby glass, including that of a nearby chandelier. Mavis is in excruciating pain and is shown with blood streaming from her ears, nose, and eyes. Mavis falls over the balcony to the floor below.

Nick is in bed, dreaming about Soledad Marquesa and his parents' murder. Juliette wakes him up from his nightmare to make sure he is okay. Juliette offers to keep investigating Rhinebeck, NY, and Farley Kolt.

Meanwhile, Arthur is sitting in his living room staring at the fire. Lucinda comes downstairs looking for him and, seeing him looking worried, asks what's wrong. He won't tell her as he ""would not want her to lose her smile.""

The next day, Tiffany Kerfield, one of Lucinda's stepsisters, is talking with her sister, Taylor, about checking up on their mother because she has not been able to reach her all day. Tiffany opens the door to Mavis' house and is horrified to find Mavis' body on the floor. The police are called in, and Hank and Nick arrive at the scene. Wu says it could have been an accident, except for the claw marks and exploded eyeballs. Nick and Hank go upstairs, only to find more broken glass. Nick suggests that the light fixtures could have been broken to keep it dark, but Hank points out that the mirror is broken as well. They question Taylor and Tiffany. They tell the detectives that Arthur Jarvis had a motive to kill their mother. They also state that Arthur Jarvis and Spencer Harrison had visited Mavis yesterday, asking for money, but had been denied. Neither Arthur nor Spencer has been on good terms with the Kerfields since Arthur's marriage to Lucinda.

Juliette calls Arnold Gubser, the detective who investigated the murder of Nick's parents in 1994, saying that Nick, a detective with the Portland PD, is looking for a little closure. The detective says he hasn't thought about the case in many years but promises to re-open the case files and send any information he finds to Nick. Juliette calls Nick and tells him the good news.

Nick and Hank pull up at the Jarvis home to question the couple. Spencer is inside as well, and the couple insists that he stay while the police question them. Nick tells them that Mavis has been murdered. Lucinda is shocked. Nick says that since Arthur and Spencer had seen Mavis the day before for financial help, they need to be questioned. This angers Spencer and Arthur, who had been keeping their visit and their financial troubles a secret from Lucinda. Spencer then woges into a bat-like creature and asks if they can have a minute. As Hank and Nick wait outside, Nick receives a call from Gubser, who tells him that a year after the investigation into Nick's parents began, the case was reclassified as a homicide, with four suspects: Soledad Marquesa, Ian Flynn, Hans Roth, and Akira Kimura.

Nick and Hank interrogate Arthur back at the precinct. He tells the detectives that he had been set up with the Kerfield sisters at a Black Tie fundraiser; while there, he met and danced with Lucinda. It was love at first sight, he says. Lucinda had never had a good relationship with the Kerfields, and his choosing Lucinda over Tiffany and Taylor was ""the straw that broke the camel's back."" He also says that he only went to ask Mavis for money because that was his last option.

Lucinda and Spencer are questioned back at the precinct as well. Lucinda says her relationship with Mavis and her daughters was strained after her father died. Nick asks if she knew of a will. Lucinda says she was not kept in the loop but is not surprised when Nick tells her that her father's estate was left to the stepsisters.

In his interrogation, Spencer says that among other things, Lucinda's father was never a good judge of women; he believed (wrongly) that Mavis would do right by Lucinda after he died, and Spencer has done his best to make up for that failure. Nick and Hank conclude the interrogations and brief Renard on the findings. Nick then receives the pictures from Gubser, including the picture of the fourth suspect.

Later, Arthur is talking to Lucinda in their bedroom. She says she wants to go over and talk to her stepsisters, but Arthur tries to dissuade her. She shouts that it is family business, but he is worried that if one of the girls could kill their own mother that they could kill her. She sneaks out anyway. Spencer finds out and goes after her. Lucinda meets Tiffany and tells her that she is sorry that Mavis died. Tiffany is scornful, accuses Spencer and Arthur of killing Mavis, and gets into her car. Lucinda woges into a Murciélago and kills Tiffany with a supersonic screech.

Meanwhile, at Nick's trailer, Monroe and Nick look through the books to find out what kind of Wesen Spencer is. Monroe identifies him as a Murciélago, a bat-like creature whose screech is capable of exploding eyeballs and bowels, as well as rupturing ear drums. The one thing that can negate it is a Murciélago Matraca, which sends out sound waves of its own. Nick happens to have one in the trailer and shows it to Monroe, who gets very excited and admires its craftsmanship. In testing the device out, a bottle that the Murciélago Matraca is pointed at shatters.

Nick goes to the Jarvis house to find Spencer, but the couple has not seen him. They say that he might have gone after Tiffany, so Nick heads to Mavis' house to stop him. Spencer arrives on the scene but is too late to have stopped Lucinda from murdering Tiffany. Nick arrives a few minutes later and arrests him. He woges, but Nick threatens to blow his head off if he opens his mouth because he ""knows how you kill."" Spencer protests that Nick doesn't understand, but he is still arrested.

Nick and Hank are briefing Renard when Wu says Spencer wants to confess. They both go into the room, and Spencer confesses to both murders, saying he couldn't stand how they treated Lucinda. He explains that he has the ability to produce sound waves that could be used to kill, as in the case of Mavis and Tiffany. Hank believes Spencer is trying to play the insanity card and leaves in disgust. Alone with Nick, Spencer remarks on the irony that he managed to get rid of Hank by telling him the literal truth.

Nick, who knows the truth about what Spencer can do, asks if he is going to confess to the murders. Urgently, Spencer says Lucinda, not he, is the killer. Nick has trouble believing this, and Spencer explains that Lucinda ""has no conscience"", and, while she was living with her stepmother and stepsisters, made their lives more miserable than they ever made hers. Spencer, knowing what she is capable of, tried to keep her happy by giving her everything she wanted, which was the only way he knew of controlling her. But despite his best efforts, Lucinda is out of control, and has already killed twice. If Nick does not move quickly, he warns, Taylor will be dead before the night is out.

Nick leaves interrogation and Hank says he has just finished conferring with the family's estate lawyer, who has confirmed that Mavis' will leaves everything to her two daughters, but if all three of them die, then Lucinda will inherit her father's entire $52 million fortune.

In Nick's absence, Spencer breaks the exterior window of the interrogation room with his screech and escapes. He returns to the Jarvis house, where he finds Arthur, morosely clutching a bottle of liquor. In a drunken daze, Arthur says that he took Spencer's advice and tried to stand up to Lucinda, but she clawed his face and ran out. Spencer asks where she went, and Arthur says, to Taylor's house. As Spencer runs out, Arthur keeps talking to the empty room: ""You know what else she said? She said she never loved me.""

Lucinda is inside Taylor's house attempting to kill her when the police show up. She runs off with Nick in pursuit. Monroe pulls up in his car with the Murciélago Matraca. Nick and Monroe set it up in front of a building Lucinda has run into and crank it up. She jumps out of a window to escape the painful sound and runs into Spencer. Lucinda asks Spencer to help her, and he says he will. He kills her with his screech, but she stays alive just long enough to bite his throat and kill him. Nick and Monroe hear Spencer scream in pain as his neck is bitten. They go to investigate and find the two bodies. Monroe wonders how Nick will be able to explain all of this. Nick and Hank bring the Murciélago Matraca to Captain Renard, saying they found it at the crime scene. They explain how it makes a high pitched sound. Renard asks if either of them want to show him how it works, but they just look at each other, in no rush to show Renard.

Nick and Juliette are at their house sitting by their computer. Juliette says she's working on trying to help bring Nick closure about his parent's deaths. On the screen of the computer is an image of Akira Kimura, one of the suspects in the murder of Nick's parents."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2373011/?ref_=ttep_ep21,,Episodes of vicious attacks by Bigfoot-like Wesen known as Wildermann are suddenly rampant. Nick and Monroe discover that the errant Wesen are connected to a psychologist performing medical experiments to help the Wesen control their urges.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Omar Madha'],"['', '', '']",[],"['syringe', 'therapy', 'metamorphosis', 'injection', 'bare chested male']",[],"A group of self-proclaimed cryptozoologists, Michael Patterson, David Gimlin, and Vera Saldona, are looking for Bigfoot in the woods. Michael and David are each using a video camera to record everything they find. Michael and Vera spot a fresh kill and broken branches, telltale signs of Bigfoot, according to them. David starts making a Bigfoot call he learned on the Internet, and the group hears a distant roar. The sound of footsteps gets closer and they get attacked. One of the video cameras gets dropped on the ground and Michael gets thrown up against a tree.

Thom Carson, a horse owner in the area near the Bigfoot attack, hears a commotion outside. He grabs his gun, and when he sees the figure disturbing the horses, he tells it to ""get out of there"" and he shoots. He goes up to the horses and see one of them was attacked. He calls Juliette, who soon shows up. She examines the claw marks and says she will clean up the wounds, give the horse a shot of antibiotics, and take a blood sample. Thom then shows her tracks he found and how the fence has been broken. They discover some hair on the ground and Juliette picks some up and puts it into a jar to test it out. They discover footprints that appear to be big human footprints. Juliette asks him if he's sure he saw an animal and they see blood on the ground. Thom admits he took a shot, but didn't think he hit anything. The pair then follow the prints into the woods. Thom finds a shoe, and when he reaches over to pick it up, he finds that there is a human foot inside. Just past the foot are the bodies of Michael Patterson and David Gimlin.

Nick is in the trailer using the piece of the map that the key makes and putting it up against other maps trying to figure out if it matches anywhere. Juliette then calls him and tells him about the bodies. He tells her to stay there and not touch anything, and he tells her he is on his way.

Nick and Hank arrive to the scene and look at the bodies. Hank thinks the wounds look like they were made by animal and suggests maybe a wolf. Nick says based on the footprints, he thinks whatever did this was human. Wu chimes in that ""the answer is obvious. These murders were committed by a barefoot man carrying a wolf."" Nick says to get some dogs out there to see if they can track whatever they're looking for. Wu then calls Nick and Hank over because he found one of the video cameras on the ground, but before they can look at the footage, they hear something in the bushes. Vera comes out of the bushes, crying and scared. She says that Bigfoot is the one who killed Michael and David.

Back at the precinct, Nick, Hank, and Captain Renard watch the footage on the video camera they found. Hank tells Renard that they identified the two victims as David Gimlin and Michael Patterson, both 25 years old and self-described cryptozoologists. In the footage, they discover that the figure described as Bigfoot is wearing clothes.

Later that night, Nick and Juliette are sitting in bed talking about the events in the woods. Juliette asks what killed the two men and Nick tells Juliette they have some footage and that the suspect is wearing clothes. Juliette says if it was the same thing that attacked Thom's horse, then it wasn't a man.

Monroe is woken in the middle of the night. Hearing noises outside, he goes downstairs. He looks around and goes to his open windows and smells the area to see if he can get a scent of who or what is around. Suddenly, he hears his door opening. He squats down behind his kitchen wall, morphs, and waits for the intruder. He attacks the intruder, only to discover it is his old friend, Larry. Monroe drags Larry to the couch and lays him down. Monroe notices the bullet wound in Larry's leg. He asks him how a Wildermann gets shot in the leg and stands up to get supplies to clean the wound. Larry then starts speaking. He mutters to Monroe that he ""cant get out"" and that it's ""not working."" Monroe isn't sure what he is talking about and Larry passes out. Monroe then realizes that Larry isn't retracting out of his Wildermann form even though he passed out.

Nick is awakened early the next morning by a call from an Associated Press reporter who is calling to get information about the recent attacks.

Later in the day, Nick tells Hank about the call. Hanks says that he also got a call early in the morning. Renard is talking to a crowd of reporters who want information about the attacks. Monroe then calls Nick saying that he may have the Bigfoot that people are looking for on his couch, and Nick heads to Monroe's house.

Juliette calls a colleague to ask if he could could sneak her into his lab so that she can run a DNA spectrum on the hair that she collected by Thom's house, since she doesn't have the right equipment in her lab. Nick arrives at Monroe's house, where Monroe is working on Larry's bullet wound. Monroe thanks Nick for coming. He says that he would call 911, but Larry isn't in an explainable state because anyone could see him as a Wildermann at the moment. Monroe then introduces the term ""woge"" to Nick and tells him he doesn't think Larry can do it to get back to his human form for some reason. Monroe explains that Larry is a nice guy when Nick says that he killed two people. Monroe doesn't think he meant to and explains that last he heard, Larry had been seeing Konstantin Brinkerhoff, a therapist who specializes in identity issues and impulse control. Monroe then catches the scent of the search dogs that are being used to look for Larry. Monroe and Nick take Larry's shirt off and Monroe puts it on. He leaves his house and runs into the woods to draw the search dogs away from his house with Larry's scent.

The dogs pick up the scent and the handler says to let the dogs run. The dogs eventually catch up to Monroe, who then turns around to face them, woges, and roars, which scares the dogs and sends them running away. Hanks hears the roar and then sees the dogs whining and running past him. He pulls out his gun and is knocked down by a woged Monroe, who quickly continues running before Hank can get a good look at him.

Monroe arrives back at his house out of breath. He says to Nick that he bumped into Hank while he was still woged. Larry interrupts the conversation by walking into the kitchen begging them to ""get it out."" He reaches to the back of his neck and, as Nick and Monroe watch in horror, painfully pulls something out of his neck. He tells Nick and Monroe that he didn't mean to and didn't want to kill the two men. He then stumbles backwards into a wall, slides down it, and dies. He then finally woges back into his human form. Nick receives a call from Hank while Monroe grieves over his friend's death. Hank tells Nick about what happened while looking for Larry in the woods, including running into Monroe.

A little while later, Nick and Monroe bring Larry's body into the woods to get him away from Monroe's home so he isn't tied to the crime. They lean him against a tree near where the dogs caught up to Monroe. Monroe tearfully says his final goodbye, and he and Nick start to head out of the forest. Nick asks Monroe about Konstantin Brinkerhoff, and Monroe tells him he is a Wildermann like Larry and gives Nick a little information about Wildermann.

Soon later, Nick goes to one of Konstantin Brinkerhoff's lectures. After the lecture, Nick goes up to him and acts like he wants an autograph. Nick mentions Larry was one of Brinkerhoff's patients and they step aside to talk. Brinkerhoff said Larry was struggling with issues like impulse control, and when Nick asks about Larry having violent tendencies, Brinkerhoff says no more than normal, which Nick implies for a Wildermann. They continue to talk about what what Brinkerhoff did in his appointments with patients. Nick then gets a call from Hank saying that Larry's body was found by a guy walking his dog.

Juliette is in the Oregon Health & Science University lab looking at the hair that she collected under a microscope. She writes down that it is hair of a hominid, but after looking at the hair again, she writes that it could also be primate hair.

Nick meets Hank at the scene of Larry's body and asks if he is okay as Hank is having a flashback of his run in with Monroe. A little while later, Renard tells the press that the body they found is the suspect that they have been looking for in the recent murders.

In the woods, Harold and his friend are sitting around a fire. The friend gets up to relieve himself and is attacked by Alan Evercroft, who is having the same problems as Larry. Alan charges Harold, but Harold holds up a piece of building equipment, which Alan runs into and is impaled by, killing him while Harold runs away. The next morning, Harold is talking to Nick and Wu about what happened. Nick and Hank then examine both bodies. They discover that Alan has the same thing in his neck that Larry had.

Juliette receives a call from someone who also ran DNA tests on the hair she found, and the man says the results were inconclusive. She is told that the results are of a single organism with two genetically distinct cells, like a chimera.

Monroe goes to a bar to meet with Reynaldo to talk about Larry. Reynaldo tells Monroe the last time he saw Larry, he was really happy because he found a way to solve their (Wesen) problems overnight. Reynaldo says that Larry wouldn't say how, but Alan Evercroft and Dan Murray went to see Brinkerhoff after they talked to Larry and saw how happy he was.

Nick and Hank go talk to the CSU Tech who discovered that the devices found in Larry and Alan Evercroft's necks was a type of drug pump. The tech says that the drugs were nothing illegal and wouldn't ""make the average person go ape."" Monroe calls Nick to tell him about Alan Evercroft and Dan Murray also seeing Brinkerhoff. Nick tells Monroe that Evercroft was killed the night before and that he had the same type of pump as Larry did in his neck. Monroe tells Nick he'll call Dan, but when he does, Dan's brother, Travis, answers and tells Monroe that Dan died two days before and that he had problems that his family didn't know about.

Nick and Hank are talking with Captain Renard about Dan Murray, and they tell him that Dan also had a pump in his Neck. Wu comes in and tells them he heard back from the company that made the pumps and that Konstantin Brinkerhoff is the one who ordered them, four pumps in total. Renard says they better figure out where the fourth pump is.

Brinkerhoff is in his office writing about the devices failing. He looks at his hand as it suddenly becomes very hairy. Monroe knocks on his door. When Brinkerhoff opens the door, Monroe says they need to talk about his friends. Brinkerhoff says the drugs work, but he didn't have time to test them out as much as he wanted to. He says the problems start when the dosage drops. Brinkerhoff hurries to his desk and pulls out a jar containing a blue liquid and a syringe. His hand starts shaking before he can put the syringe into the jar and he drops the jar, which shatters. He tells Monroe that he has to help him, but as Monroe is slowly walking up to him, he woges and hits Monroe, knocking him to the ground. Monroe woges to try to fight back, but Brinkerhoff slides him across a table. Nick shows up, yelling for Brinkerhoff, but Brinkerhoff runs and jumps through a window. Monroe says that Nick and Hank need to stop Brinkerhoff because he's been using the drugs on himself and now he is out for blood.

Hank calls for backup as he and Nick pursue Brinkerhoff. Brinkerhoff charges two men, attacking one while the other one runs and calls the cops to tell them they're getting attacked. Nick and Hank hear about the attack on their police radio and head towards the attack location. Brinkerhoff runs into a building where a formal party is being held and starts attacking people as they run to escape, claiming that Brinkerhoff is Bigfoot. Brinkerhoff drags a girl with him as he heads out of the room. Nick and Hank arrive to the scene and a man tells them he's not sure what he saw, but it grabbed a woman and dragged her into the theater. Wu arrives and goes with Nick and Hank to the theater.

All three are up above the theater's seating with their guns drawn. They spot Brinkerhoff as he goes through another door. Nick follows, while Hank and Wu find another way. Nick finds the girl that Brinkerhoff took and goes to check on her, discovering she is still alive. As he checks on her, Brinkerhoff approaches him from above. Hank sees him, and before Brinkerhoff attacks Nick, Hank shoots him and Brinkerhoff falls to the seats below. Wu calls in about the woman while Nick and Hank go down to check on Brinkerhoff. When they get down, Brinkerhoff is still woged, and Hank sees him revert back to his human form as he dies. Hank starts to question what he saw and Nick tries to tell him it's just Brinkerhoff, but Hank swears his face was just different.

Monroe and Reynaldo are at a bar having a drink to honor their fallen friends. The news comes on talking about Brinkerhoff's death and saying that the Bigfoot reports were nothing more than mass hysteria. Juliette and Nick are at their house also watching the news. Juliette tells Nick about the hair she collected. She tells him she did a DNA test on it, which revealed it wasn't human, yet the hair still couldn't be matched to any known species. Juliette says that for the first time in her life, she wonders if things like Bigfoot are more than just stories."

(""Big Feet"")

The next day, Nick meets Monroe for coffee and worries that despite his stoic exterior, Hank is bothered by his encounter in the woods. Monroe has seen that kind of reaction and warns that most people can't process the knowledge. Nick warns him that Hank also got a good look at Brinkerhoff as he transformed back to human form, and Monroe suggests that Hank might be able to handle it better because he's a cop. As they leave the shop, private investigator Nathaniel Adams takes surveillance photos of them. He then returns to his hotel room, adds the photos to his collection, and calls Akira Kimura, his employer, to tell him that he's found Marquesa, one of the three thieves who came to Portland looking for the three gold coins.

At the station, Nick receives an Interpol file on Kimura and is studying it when a tired-looking Hank comes in. Nick tells his partner that Kimura beat a coin dealer in Hamburg, the same dealer that sold the three coins to Sam Bertram in Portland. Kimura has a tattoo of a Viking sigil on the left side of his head, rumored to give the wearer invincibility, and the file notes that Kimura was last seen in Lisbon fourteen months ago. Nick tells Hank that he is not only involved with the killers from ""Three Coins in a Fuchsbau"" but is also a suspect in his own parent's murder.

Akira Kimura shows up at Adams' hotel room to look into what happened to his former associates. Adams says that the police found three gold coins within the stomach of a victim, but that these were gone when the body arrived at the morgue. He shows him pictures of Nick, Hank, Monroe, and Renard, but seems pretty sure that Renard has the coins. He asks to be cut into the deal. Instead, Kimura murders him after saying that he no longer needs his help and takes the evidence. Later, a mysterious woman in black is seen spying on him from the shadows. She isn't surprised to find Adams dead and figures he found something that wasn't good for him.

Adalind Schade is at a new apartment, mixing a potion. She then feeds it to a stray Siamese cat she's captured, using a saucer of milk. Adalind shows up at Juliette Silverton's veterinary clinic with the stray and claims it's her pet named ""Majique"", whom she says has been acting sluggishly and seems sick. She mentions that she and Hank have broken up and that Nick does not seem to like her, and she asks Juliette not to mention this to him. Juliette says the cat seems okay but that she would rather keep it overnight to be sure. During the examination, the cat scratches her hand. The cat's eyes soon change entirely to all black, and its tongue is fluorescent yellow.

The partners are called to the hotel to investigate Adams' murder, and Wu gives them the background on Adams that they have. Someone ripped out his throat, and Nick confirms that someone else entered the room and rolled the body after Adams died. They find the rental keys for Adams' car and confirm that he had cameras in his trunk.

Nick and Hank go back to the station and download the photos from Adams' cameras. They're surprised to discover that Adams was taking pictures of them, Monroe, and Renard, and Nick calls the captain to warn him while Hank organizes security details for his house, as well as Nick's and Renard's.

Kimura attacks Captain Renard in his home after ransacking it and murdering his housekeeper, Patty. He knocks Renard unconscious and then interrogates him at knife point. He does not seem to believe Renard when he tells him that the coins were taken from him by Farley Kolt. The interrogation is interrupted when Sergeant Wu and another officer arrive at the door to check on Renard.

Kimura escapes after attacking one of the officers, but Hank and Nick easily identify him from Renard's description. Wu is able to track him to the Palms Motor Hotel, where the manager at the desk says that Kimura checked in that morning, paying cash for three days. As Wu and another officer approach his room, they instead find the woman in black leaving. After a brief fight in which she displays impressive strength and agility and jumps off the first floor balcony onto a patrol car, she escapes.

Nick talks to Monroe, telling him that Kimura has pictures of both of them and that he may need help bringing him down. He wants to catch this dangerous killer himself rather than kill or arrest him so that he can interrogate him ""Grimm-style"". In the trailer, Monroe helps Nick look through books and prepares a Doppelarmbrust dart containing a sedative called Schlaftrunk, strong enough to incapacitate the Schakal.

Nick goes home and sees Juliette, who says she is not in the mood to cook and has made reservations for dinner. (Actually a set of reservations in each of their names, so they could choose to be late if they like.) Nick notices the bandage on her hand and asks how it happened. When she admits that she was scratched by a cat owned by Adalind, Nick freaks out and insists that she go to the hospital. They get into an argument, and Juliette insists that Nick explain what his problem with Adalind is. He says she is a witch, which Juliette clearly does not buy. Nick finally decides to tell her the whole truth and takes her to the trailer in order to do so. She does not believe him and walks out of the trailer as Nick excitedly is explaining the Wesen and Grimm world. He catches up to her outside in the rain where she says he needs to talk to someone about this, but that someone is not her. Before going home, Nick asks that she come with him to one more place and give him one last chance. They stop by Monroe's home.

Monroe is taken by surprise and initially does not want to confirm anything. When he sees the scratch and hears that it was Adalind's cat that did it, he agrees to cooperate. He tells Juliette to prepare herself, turns around, and changes. While he is facing the other way, Juliette faints before she sees him transform. They rush her to the hospital.

The doctors are not sure what is wrong. An E.R. doctor states that cat scratches are not usually dangerous, so there could be something else going on with her. He advises Nick to go home as it will take quite a while to run some tests and tells him that he will be called if they know anything. As Nick and Monroe leave, Monroe tells Nick that the doctors will probably not be able to help Juliette and that they will need to find Adalind's cat. They find the cat in Juliette's veterinarian office and take it to Rosalee Calvert's Spice Shop. She says her and Monroe will try to figure out what is wrong by running their own tests on the cat. At the hospital, Juliette suddenly awakes with her eyes having turned entirely black like the cat that had scratched her.

Nick stops by Adalind's home to find her gone and everything missing, except for the bowl of half-drank milk she gave her cat.

Nick returns home to find it ransacked. He then hears Kimura walking downstairs. He fails to shoot him successfully with the Doppelarmbrust, and the two engage in hand to hand combat. Kimura gains the initial advantage, but Nick manages to subdue him, fueled by his anger over the murder of his parents. Suddenly, the mysterious woman in black shows up. She dodges Nick's attacks, kicks him away, and then quickly finishes Kimura off and knocks him out temporarily by injecting him in the chest with a drug. Nick points his gun at her, but she calls him ""Nicky"", and he is shocked to recognize her as his ""dead"" mother."

The men begin to bicker as they drink, which catches the attention of Matt while he sits with Doc and Kitty.

The fight turns physical with Jerry besting Andy easily. The Marshal comes and breaks up the fight and takes Jerry to jail. He asks Jerry why he was picking a fight with a store owner like Andy. Jerry only offers up that it's personal. Matt sets Jerry's bail at $25. Andy enters the jail stating that the fight was his fault and that he doesn't want to press charges for assault. He ends up paying Jerry's bail and he is released.

Next, we see Jerry on his horse and appears to be heading out of town. He is stopped by Andy on foot and Jerry dismounts and the men begin to argue again. Andy offers to pay $600 if Jerry will just let their past issue go. Jerry refuses the money for his silence. Andy draws on Jerry, but Jerry is faster and kills Andy. The town's s people prevent Jerry from leaving the scene and Matt comes to investigate. The towns folks want to string up Andy, but Matt says he gets a trial.

Back at the jail, Jerry tells Matt that Andy had a gun and that somebody must have picked it up. Jerry comes clean about the history between him and Andy. He explains how Andy is a Quantrill Raider, mentioning his tattoo. He continues that The Quantrill killed his father in front of him and took his girl.

Matt looks in the street for the gun. He notices Belle a hostess at the bar who went home early in a window above the street. He goes up and tries to get her to tell him what she saw, but she won't talk.

The next scene is at the coroner's inquiry with Doc, Matt, Jerry and the township. Jerry explains how The shooting was self defense and as part of the Quantrill raiders Andy killed his father and took his woman a decade ago. Belle comes into the inquiry and testifies that she saw the shooting and that the shooting went down as Andy said.

Jerry is set free and in the closing scene we see Jerry leaving town and Belle is looking out the window at him. Jerry calls up to her using her name back when she was his girl a decade ago before the raid. She tell's him that girl is dead. Jerry continues to ride out of town."

Ashley is not happy.

The gang gets together and talks about the plans for a memorial for Alison. Hanna gives Spencer Alison's bracelet, saying she doesn't want the responsibility. After referring to the mysterious ""A"" as a ""her,"" Spencer goes into her wireless account and blocks any electronic contact from people she doesn't know. As Mr. Fitz rides by Aria follows suit, as does Hanna. Emily still isn't talking to Ben. One of Alison's MISSING posters blows right up to them with the words ""Ding dong the bitch is dead"" written in red.

Maya gives Emily a new scarf. She lies about its origin to the rest of the girls. Hanna gets a call from her dad. Toby and Emily bump into each in the cafeteria. Emily doesn't say anything about her recent contact with Toby.

Hanna's dad tells her he's coming for a visit. She starts to ask whether he's talked to Ashley but does not.

Fitz and Aria awkwardly discuss the nature of their relationship. She agrees to come over for dinner.

The rest of the girls wonder whether Hanna's dad is only coming to town because of Sean's card. Spencer's teacher absolutely loved her essay (the one she stole from Melissa) and has submitted it for a national contest.

Emily puts the scarf back in her locker before running into Toby, who is now in one of her classes. Toby ends up being assigned her lab partner. While looking through her text book Emily finds someone has pictures of her and Maya kissing in the camera booth.

Aria comes home to find her mother Ella making dinner for her father. She lies and says she'll be eating over at Spencer's. After her mother references being all alone with her husband Byron, Aria flashes back to watching Aria and Alison watch Byron making out with Meredith. At the time Alison tried to convince Aria to tell Ella. In present day Aria doesn't say anything to her mother.

While Hanna tries on an outfit for the meeting with her father, Spencer tells her about stealing the essay. Spencer says she hasn't peeked at any potential blocked messages.

Emily asks Maya if she was the one who put the pictures in her chemistry book. May says she didn't do it. Emily is worried about someone seeing them kissing.

Hanna's father Tom arrives. Though Ashley has clearly gotten herself ready for a nice evening, Tom was under the impression he would be alone with his daughter. Tom and Hanna leave alone. At the curb Hanna realizes Tom knew about her crashing Sean's car. She is initially upset, but he calms her down by saying he's only there to help.

Before dinner Fitz suggests that perhaps her parents have an ""understanding"" that she doesn't know about and maybe it isn't her problem to fix. She overreacts, thinking Fitz doesn't believe she is mature to handle her parents' issues and storms out.

Hanna tells the girls she had a great time with her father. He has something to tell her and wants to take her out for a nice dinner. Hanna thinks it might be that he wants them to have more consistent contact.

During a class of ""To Kill of Mockingbird,"" Fitz and Aria have a back and forth that gets a tiny bit awkward. Fitz ends up snapping at another student.

Emily sees some of the jocks have filled Toby's locker with shaving cream.

At dinner Tom introduces a stunned Hanna to his fiancé Isabelle and her daughter, who is approximately Hanna's age.

A drunken Wren shows up at Spencer's house in the middle of the night with a gift for the family. She tells him her family is out of town and they end up nearly kissing. We see someone is videotaping their interaction.

Aria goes to Fitz' apartment and yells at him for being immature in class. He agrees.

Over coffee Wren tells Spencer he is terrified of her father. She tells him she never wanted to hurt Melissa. She says he is too drunk to drive home.

Hanna learns about Isabelle and her sailing daughter Kate. Tom has agreed to pay for the damage to Sean's car as long as Hanna works off the damage in Sean's mother's office. Hanna is nasty towards Kate. Hanna gets an ""SOS"" text from Spencer.

After Emily throws away the pictures of her and Maya she talks with Toby. They discuss his being the butt of jokes, the pictures in her text book (he didn't see it) and her swimming. He gives her advice on life and the two seem to be bonding.

Aria and Fitz eat leftovers and he apologizes for his behavior in class. She talks about the desire to fix her family and says she realizes her parents have to handle it themselves. He asks her to stay but she leaves to talk to her mom.

Spencer walks Wren to his motel and has Hanna pick her up. He tells her again that he wishes he had met her before her sister and kisses her while Hanna looks on from the parking lot. While sitting in the car Hanna hears a radio station play a song dedicated to her from ""her best friend 'A'."" It is called ""I Don't Need You Anymore."" Spencer gets in the car and Hanna tells her ""we are so out of our league.""

Emily meets Maya who makes reference to her being sacred of anybody seeing them together. Emily apologizes and says she doesn't know what their kiss meant. Emily says she needs some time and space to figure things out. Maya says ""I care about you, so I'll wait.""

Aria comes home and tells her mother there is ""something you should know."" Ella hands her a typed letter from 'A.' The letter tells Ella that Byron has cheated on her and that Aria was aware of the infidelity.

Back at Spencer's place, Hanna tells her she is worried that 'A' hasn't stopped. Spencer notices Wren's present has been moved. Someone has been in the house and she rushes upstairs to check on Alison's bracelet. It is not missing, but when the two girls turn to look across Spencer's room they both gasp.

On her way home Emily gets a text from Spencer reading ""SOS."" At the same time Spencer also gets an ""SOS"" text from Spencer.

Someone has written ""It won't be that easy, bitches,"" on Spencer's mirror in Alison's favorite shade of lipstick."

Aria tells the others that Alison saw her father kissing Meredith. They head upstairs to clean Spencer's mirror and Hanna's now unblocked phone rings with a text. It's a video message from 'A' showing that he/she was videotaping them from Spencer's closet while they looked at the mirror. The go upstairs and find the lipstick inside the closet.

Aria and her brother Mike discuss the fact their parents have been acting weird lately. Cut to them downstairs arguing. Byron tells Ella he things they should seek counseling. After Byron leaves for work Aria tells Ella that Mike knows something is going on. Ella tells her not to worry, that the issue is between her and Byron.

Hanna runs into Sean on her way to her first day of work at his mother's office. He tells her he tried to take the fall for wreck and they have an awkward conversation about Homecoming. He says he hasn't thought much about the dance before hopping into a car with a pretty girl.

At school the girls discuss the possibility Toby's blind sister Jenna broke into Spencer's house. They think Emily should ask Toby where he was last night. Spencer's teacher walk up and tells her that her essay won the national award.

In lab Toby tells Emily he was studying the night before at the Grille. He often goes there for quiet just about every night. He asks whether Maya is the newest member of her group of friends.

Fitz tells Aria he'll be reading one of his stories that night. He tells her she can come.

In the elevator after work Hanna stares at Jenna while she puts on her lipstick.

Spencer's father could not be happier about her winning the essay contest. He wants her to play tennis with him against a potential client at the country club.

Hanna spots Jenna leaving the floor in the building where she's working. She walks into the room (which is empty) but is chased away by a guard.

Toby and Emily realize they have similar taste in music and Toby offers to burn Emily a CD of a new band she might like. He suggests they meet up at the Grille later and she agrees.

Following Fitz's reading Aria runs into one of his friends from college.

Spencer practices her game at the club in anticipation of the match. She runs into a club employee who thinks she's going at it pretty angrily.

When Aria walks away, Fitz's buddy tells him he's asking for trouble seeing one of his students.

Hanna tells her mother Ashley about the cheerleader she saw Sean with the other day. Ashley tries to assure her that there is no evidence Sean is dating her. Hanna mentions her father is engaged, a fact Ashley did not know. Hanna glances at her Instant messenger and sees a note from 'A.' It is the pictures of Emily and Maya kissing.

Sitting at the Grille, Hanna tells Spencer that the lipstick she saw Jenna putting on in the elevator is the same shade as what was on her mirror. Emily walks in and decides to ignore Toby and sit with Hanna and Spencer. Toby leaves.

Fitz and Aria return to his place. Fitz expresses concern about their relationship. Aria seems to convince him that age doesn't matter when they're together. They agree she will bring over dinner the next night.

Spencer leaves the Grille and mentions potentially being interested in the guy from the club. The waitress brings over a CD for Emily. Hanna sees the gift and clearly thinks it could be from Maya. Hanna seems cool with the prospect.

We see a happy Emily going to bed clutching the CD from Toby.

To Spencer's dismay, her father tells her it is his best interest that they lose the doubles match. It is the best way to ensure he gets the sale. During the match Spencer begins playing worse as the club employee looks on.

Hanna finally goes into the door where she saw Jenna exit. It is a counselor's office. After being mistaken for a patient, Hanna makes up a lame excuse and leaves.

With their parents arguing in the background, Mike tells Aria he is upset with what is happening. We cut to Byron telling Ella he wants to save their marriage, that he wants things to be the way they used to be. He says the time with Meredith was a mistake and used Aria to help cover it up because he was afraid.

After Spencer and her father lose the club employee walks over to her. She tells him it was important for her team to lose and he tells her sees a lot of game-playing at the club. She asks him if he'd like to go out some time.

Hanna tells Ashley she still hasn't heard from Sean and is worried the relationship is over. Ashley thinks she shouldn't tell Sean how she feels.

Aria arrives at Fitz' place for dinner. He is clearly upset. She left her cell phone there the other night and after it repeatedly buzzed with a text he finally checked it in case there was an emergency. It was a note from 'A,' referencing Aria and Fitz' relationship. Fitz is angry she told one of her friends. Aria tells him she doesn't know 'A' and didn't tell anyone but he doesn't believe her and asks her to leave.

Hanna runs into Sean. She asks about the girl and he tells her she was simply a friend he attends RLW (Real Love Waits) meetings with. Hanna asks if she can go to the meetings with him and Sean seems to like the idea.

Spencer's dad tells her he got the sale. But to get it he had to lie and tell the client her club employee friend (Alex) screwed up a reservation. Spencer is so angry that she tells her father she stole the essay.

Emily finds Toby at the Grille. She apologizes for dissing him the other night and gives him a CD she burned for him.

We see Spencer and Alex go on their date.

Aria and Mike eat dinner together. Neither knows what will happen with their parents' marriage."

They get her to agree to attend the Homecoming dance. Spencer is head of the organizing committee and Hanna is gunning to be voted queen. Spencer will attend the date with Alex, the country club employee. Emily says she is planning to go stag. In all of them is the message: ""Lions and Tigers and Bitches, oh my. There is no place like Homecoming, see you there. --A.""

Hanna joins Sean at one of his abstinence club meetings. There she meets one of the school's nerds, Lucas.

Fitz blows off Aria in the hall. Emily runs into Maya. Maya isn't planning on attending the dance and asks if Emily wants to catch up some time. Spencer wants Hanna to get Jenna's file from the therapist's office so they can find out what she and Toby may know. Spencer is freaking out because Toby just bought two tickets to Homecoming. Hanna's friend Mona comes by and makes fun of Alex to Spencer. From across the cafeteria Hanna and Spencer spot a tattoo on Toby's side. It reads: ""901 free at last.""

Toby asks Emily if she wants to go to Homecoming with him and produces the two tickets. She says yes.

Alex stops by school to ask about Spencer's dress. He will be buying a new suit and insists on paying for the dance tickets.

Hanna runs into May and indicated that Emily would really want her to be there.

Toby goes to pick up Jenna, who is upset he was talking to Emily. She tells Toby that once Emily finds out the truth ""she'll hate you.""

Hanna manages to rig the door to the therapist's office in such a way that she will be able to get back in over the weekend.

Hanna asks Aria why she's going to the dance solo. Aria indicates she's upset, and Hanna assumes it's because of her parents. Aria doesn't say anything about Fitz.

The Homecoming theme is Carnivale. Spencer is upset to see Melissa is there as a fill-in for another alum who was supposed to crown king and queen. Melissa mentions the essay and Spencer says their parents think it will be less embarrassing for the family if Spencer does not admit she copied the work.

Hanna is pleasant to Lucas, who is there taking pictures for the yearbook. This disgusts Mona, who like Hanna used to be unpopular and doesn't want to descend the social ranks.

Aria has the first shift at one of the booths and is dismayed to see Fitz will be working with her.

Spencer introduces Alex to Melissa, who recognizes him from the club.

Aria and Fitz make awkward small-talk. He has gotten a haircut. She says once again that she didn't tell anyone and indicates that ""A"" is not one of her friends. She starts to talk about last summer but doesn't finish the story.

Toby and Emily arrive at the dance. They walk in the room hand-in-hand and the girls are absolutely stunned. Toby goes to get some punch and the girls grill Emily about why she's with someone who has reason to hate them. At this point Emily realizes that Hanna was referring to Maya when she told her to follow her feelings.

Melissa gets Alex alone and indicates that Spencer is using him to get back at their father.

Spencer tells Hanna and Aria she thinks Toby's tattoo refers to September 1, the day Alison disappeared. This is enough reason for them to demand Hanna go to the therapist's office and get Jenna's file. Hanna tells Aria to keep Sean company while she's gone.

Alex asks a distracted Spencer if she'd like to visit the fortune teller.

After calling a cab Hanna runs into Lucas. He agrees to give her a ride to the office building.

The fortune teller begins to read Spencer's future. It is pretty dark.

Toby spots Jenna across the room and doesn't react.

Emily asks Maya whether she said anything to anyone about them. Maya thinks Emily should deny who she is and says she will leave Emily alone if she can honestly say she doesn't have feelings for Emily. Emily says nothing.

Fitz starest intently at Aria and Sean dancing together and then leaves the dance.

The fourtune teller's last card has a hand-writeen message the teller clearly hasn't seen before. It says: ""Kiss by bye to your B.F.F.""

Aria catches Fitz before he leaves to tell him she doesn't want him to hate her. He says watching her with Sean made him realize their relationship made no practical sense. He actually got his haircut to impress her and was hoping to see her at the dance. With that said he leaves.

Hanna looks through the files.

Emily is upset and Toby suggest they go up to the chemistry lab where it is more quiet.

Spencer ignores Alex yet again to answer her phone. It is Hanna saying that she cannot find a file for Jenna under Marshall but isn't finding anything. Spencer suggests checking under ""Cavanaugh,"" since Toby's parents may have adopted her. Hanna's phone dies and when Spencer turns around Alex is gone. Hanna spots a file for Toby.

Toby asks Emily about Maya. Emily admits she may have brought the wrong person to the dance. She asks him why he likes her despite knowing what she did. He responds that he's done a few things he's not proud of: ""We've all got secrets, Emily,"" he says before closing the door.

Melissa announces that Sean and Hanna have been named king and queen of the dance. Hanna is nowhere to be found.

Hanna is in the hallway showing Spencer and Aria Toby's file. It turns out that Alison was aware that Toby had a romantic relationship with Jenna. The three girls think this is enough for him to want Alison (and them) dead. They try to call Emily to warn her.

Toby doesn't want Emily to answer the phone since he's about to tell her what happened the previous summer. Emily tells Toby he is scaring her, then gets a text from Aria that reads: ""You're with Ali's killer! We have proof . . . "" She tries to leave but Toby won't let her. She slaps him across the room and pushes him into a shelf full of chemicals. She runs downstairs to the dance and Toby follows. She runs along a hallway near the dance and appears to trip, then scream.

Cut to the City of Rosewood's welcome sign. It reads: ""Population: 7,988."" A mysterious figure blacks out the final '8' and replaces it with a '7.'"

They hear her phone and follow it to the chemistry lab where they see the broken glass and blood. Cut to Toby (with a cut face) sitting in his car in front of the ER with Emily in the back unconscious.

Aria and Spencer tell Emily about what they found in the file. The two girls think Toby must have killed Alison, but Emily isn't sure it adds up.

A cop tells Emily's mother that Emily was dropped off at the hospital by Toby, who then disappeared. She seems surprised Emily was there with Toby. Toby returned home the previous evening to drop off his family car and promptly left on his motorcycle.

To this point Emily has said only that she was injured by tripping at the dance. Spencer and Aria want them to tell the police everything other than the file. Aria's parents aren't speaking to each other. After the other two girls leave, Hanna tells Emily that A sent her the picture of her and Maya kissing. Emily is worried about what a relationship with Maya would do to her friendships.

Spencer shows up at the club to talk to Alex. He is still upset about what Melissa said and only agrees to get her a second chance if he gets to plan their next night out.

Aria tries to call Fitz but has no luck. Her parents' marriage is clearly dissolving and it is bothering Mike. Sean sends her flowers with a note thanking her for ""keeping him company.""

Jenna pays Emily a visit. She is worried about Toby and thinks Emily might know where he is. The police are looking for the file and Jenna thinks there could be trouble if it ""falls into the wrong hands."" Based on the fact that she has kept quiet about what Alison told her at the hospital, Jenna thinks Emily owes her the favor of getting back the file.

Hanna goes to the yearbook office to take king/queen photos with Sean. While she waits, she talks with Lucas about the dance. Sean arrives and is still clearly pissed about being left the previous night. We see Hanna has Jenna's file in her purse but doesn't answer her phone when Emily calls.

Emily's mother comes into her room and asks about Toby. She's clearly upset Emily went with such an undesirable character.

During the photo shoot Sean and Hanna can barely stand next to each other. Before leaving Sean snaps at Lucas a few times.

Aria's father Byron tells her that he is going to move out.

Emily's mother finally leaves her room which allows Emily access to her cell phone. She tries calling the girls as they pull up to their secret meeting spot in the woods. Aria misses the call as the three girls take the file.

Hanna wants to burn the file; Spencer and Aria think they should turn it in. After a minute of so of yelling Aria grabs the file and tosses it into the river. Immediately after returning to the car Aria sees a text from Emily telling her ""whatever you do, don't destroy that file.""

Spencer is convinced they won't hear anymore from A. Alex texts her that he has to blow off their do-over date since he has to work. Spencer doesn't but it since the country club is closed Mondays.

Aria finds a sub in Fitz' room. The woman doesn't know when he'll be back.

In the hall Emily tells Jenna that the file has been destroyed.

Hanna goes to see Lucas who wanted to show her possible pics for the yearbook.

Spencer goes to the club and finds Alex is, in fact, working. Spencer takes off her jacket and starts to help.

Cut to Emily arriving home covered in dirt. She hides her bag under the bed before getting a text from A: ""There's only so much you can bury. You're not done with me yet.""

Spencer mother brings Hanna, Aria and Spencer to school for the SATs. Her mother comes inside to check if the test will be administered with a major storm on the way. Spencer introduces her mother to Alex (whose school is also taking the SATs there) and it is obviously awkward. A teacher says the test will be given. Darren arrives and tells the girls about Alison's memorial being destroyed the night before.

Emily arrives at her locker and Darren confronts her. He tells her Toby was spotted at a gas station a few days ago. We see Emily's shoes are muddy.

In the library the girls talk about the memorial. They still aren't sure about A's identity. Emily shows up and lies about why she wasn't with them the night before. Aria's mother Ella arrives. She will be one of the proctors. The two argue about the fact Aria isn't comfortable visiting her mother at her apartment.

Hanna's mother Ashley gets a call from Aria's father Byron. He's lost power and needs to sends a fax. She invites him over.

It looks like there will be a delay in starting the SATs. Hanna and Lucas talk about her online sale. Mona walks up (with a new bag and makes fun of Lucas. Hanna does not defend him.

Emilys sees this text from A: ""Your weren't the only wont with Great Expectations. Check it out."" Darren is continuting to poke around and the girls are nervous. He comes over and asks about the night before. Emily lies and says she was with the other girls studying at Spencer's. Darren leaves and Emily gets grouchy when they asks about the night before. She excuses herself and walks through the stacks.

In the stacks Emily find a copy of ""Great Expectations."" Inside is a letter addressed to Alison from her.

Spencer looks down at her phone and sees this text from 'A:' ""Define ""desertion."" Seems like you're about to lose Emily. Who's next?"" She shows it to Aria and Hanna and all three scan the room nervously.

Spencer walks over to Alex to talk about her mother and he blows her off.

After Lucas stares at Mona from afar, Hanna tells her that the bag she bought online belonged to her. This irritates Mona who takes another shot at Lucas.

Neal approaches Aria about going to a basketball game. She politely turns him down but decides to join him when he leaves the library.

With Byron in the kitchen Ashley loses power as well. He expresses frustration at the difficulties of being a single parent.

In an adjacent room Neil plays guitar for Aria. She begins to sing a song she recognizes.

Emily flashes back to Alison reading Great Expectations. Emily talks about dreaming that Jenna got her sight back. Alison reads Emily a passage and the two kiss briefly. Back in present day we see the letter talked about the kiss.

Just before Aria and Neal are about to kiss, Fitz walks into the doorway. He tells them everyone is supposed to return to the library. Aria lingers behind and asks him about ignoring her calls. He tells her he went to New York to deal with ""my issues."" Fitz thought about her constantly but thinks the consequences are too dire. She storms out.

Byron and Ashley talk about why his wife left and the strange

Mona makes more crack about Lucas and this time Hanna defends him.

Spencer tries to talk to Alex again. He says she needs to talk to her mother.

Emily flashes back to being in the locker room and staring at a topless Alison. While helping put Alison's bra on Emily kisses her on the neck and gets completely rejected. Back in present day Emily thinks she hears someone in the library. She wanders around a shelf before coming back to where she was standing near the book. She sees that her letter to Alison is now gone.

Fitz runs into Ella in a back room. She asks him if he's noticed any changes in Aria recently. She says she's glad Aria has him in her life during this tough time for the family.

Emily returns to the locker room. Hanna asks about the previous night but Emily doesn't want to talk. Darren arrives and asks Emily to come with him. He directs her to her bag, which was left unattended on a table. The other three girls follow them in. He shows them photos of Emily sitting near the destroyed memorial the previous night. She says the memorial was already destroyed when she got there. He then pulls out pieces of the memorial and the letter to Alison, which was dated three days before Alison's disappearance. Darren suggests Emily sought vengeance for being rejected, but Emily says she went back to the memorial to say she was sorry for the horrible things she wrote in the letter. Emily admits to loving Alison ""more than a friend"" but never had the chance to tell her. Spencer's mother arrives and immediately shuts down the questioning, telling Darren ""you're done. You're done with this investigation.""

Back in the locker room Aria assures Emily that Alison loved her. They hear that the storm warning has been lifted but the SAT is still postponed.

Spencer thanks her mother for helping with Darren and then asked if anything happened with Alex. She takes Spencer into a classroom and tells her she got loaded at the club during a weekend the rest of the family was out of town. She drunkenly talked to Alex about having a lump removed from her breast and he was nice to her. She made Alex promise never to bring it up. She never told anybody about the lump because ""our family doesn't handle imperfection very well.""

The power comes back on at Hanna's place. Ashley tells Byron the fax went through. They start to plan on dinner that Saturday, but both come up with awkward excuses not to make it happen.

Aria tells Neal she's up for a date that weekend. It also sounds like she'll be having dinner at her mom's place soon.

Spencer grabs Alex in the hallway and kisses him.

Lucas thanks Hanna for standing up for him to Mona. He's clearly into her and starts to say her name but trails off. The camera pans down and we see Lucas' sneakers are covered with mud."

All at once they get simultaneous texts: ""Camp Mona is a scavenger hunt and I'm the prize. Come and find me bitches. -A""

At home, Ashley tries to get through to someone on the phone but fails. Hanna hits redial and hears it's a mortgage company.

Mona breezes in, with Ashley out of earshot she tells Hanna she wants to cut school for her birthday. When Hanna resists, she tells her: ""If you disappoint me, I'm going rogue.""

Ashley overhears Hanna start to tell Mona things have been tight since her dad left, and interrupts, giving Hanna her last $100 bill.

At their home, Byron asks Aria about her lunch with her mom the next day. He wants to tag along.

Melissa asks Spencer why she didn't tell her Ian was back - he asked her out to coffee. He broke her heart, she said no. She's still getting over Wren.

Flash back to Ian teaching Spencer how to play a lawn sport and it turning into a make out session. Allison sees it and tells Spencer she's a ""skank.""

Aria makes plans for Sunday with her boyfriend. Ezra sees her kiss him and she feels compelled to make excuses for him. But he says she's allowed to be with whoever she wants.

Aria joins the girls in the hall, they're all atwitter. They heard the cops found something of Aria's. The girls are all paged to the principal's office. Hanna texts Mona that she's stuck at school and gets back a ""screw you!""

The cops come in to talk to them. Except they're not cops, they're FBI.

The agents explain they were asked by local authorities to help with Allison's murder. An anonymous source left a tape. She plays it for them. It's Allison in the clothes she was wearing when she was murdered, and someone else's sweater, flirting with someone behind the camera. They tell her about Allison's ""older boy.""

The mortgage company tells Ashley her extension request is denied. Mrs. Potter comes in for her appointment and fishes around in her purse for her key. She paws through wads of cash to get at it.

Aria tells her boyfriend what the FBI was asking about. She opens her locker and a book falls out with a note from ""A"" directing her to a poem by Ezra Fitz.

As Mrs. Potter is leaving she scoops up all the butterscotch on Ashley's desk and leaves her key behind. Ashley doesn't say anything.

At school, a heavier girl asks Hanna for the name of her liposuction doctor. Mona clues her in, ""A"" sent her a text saying Hanna had liposuction. Mona informs her she's no longer invited to her party.

But later Hanna tells Spencer she's still going.

Aria reads the poem ""B 26"" by Ezra. It brings her to tears. She goes to see him. She asks him how he could have ended things if he felt that way about her.

She tells him she's moved on and he should. Her boyfriend walks up and hears. But she says nothing is going on.

Melissa mopes at home as someone comes up to the window. It's Ian. Spencer and all the girls come in. Melissa walks off and Spencer tells her to give Ian a chance. She gives in.

Spencer tells the girls about her ""moment"" with Wren. And she confesses she also had a moment with Ian, then they started dating after he and Melissa broke up.

They see a report on the news saying a warrant has been issued for Toby's arrest. Aria doesn't believe he was Allison's boyfriend since she made such a show of hating him.

Emily hangs out with Maya. She gets a call, but it's just heavy breathing. They hear a noise downstairs. It's Emily's dad, returned. Pam tells Maya they're ready for family time.

Aria tells her mom how Allison was apparently pretending to hate Toby. Ella tells Aria she wishes she'd told her about her dad. Aria promises no more secrets.

Emily's dad checks on her. He tells her Toby is dangerous. He tells her Toby owes Allison's family the truth, saying it's always better to be honest than tell a lie. Emily's about to tell him something, but doesn't. In the hallway, Pam looks at pictures of Emily and Maya from the photo booth.

Melissa comes back from coffee with Ian, saying she had a good time. She tells Spencer she's tired of them hating each other. Melissa mentions the news and Spencer says Allison had a lot of secrets.

Emily pulls up for glamping. Suddenly, Toby appears in her backseat. ""I want to finish what I started to tell you at homecoming,"" he says.

In the woods, Toby tells Emily that September 1 was the day he ended things with Jenna. She threatened to tell people he forced himself on her if he broke up with her. Jenna was in love with him, and still is, he says.

Mona welcomes people to her party and hands out swag bags. There are massage tents, mani-pedis and the works.

Toby tells Emily that he asked Allison to meet him to help with Jenna and he saw her and lent her his sweater because she was cold. He saw her getting into a car with an older guy. He swears he's innocent. He knows it looks bad and he plans to run. He tells Emily he's not leaving til midnight, if she can get away.

Emily tells Aria and Spencer about Toby. They want to call the police. Hanna calls and Aria tells her about Toby but they get cut off. Aria gets a text. ""You found my bracelet, now find me, bitches.""

Mona summons Emily and Aria to have their hair blown out so Spencer heads off to where they found Allison's bracelet. Aria gets a text from Ezra saying he has to see her.

Hanna sneaks up to the edges of the party, on the lookout for ""A.""

Spencer comes back with Jenna's keychain and a note: ""You're as in the dark as Jenna, looking for me in all the wrong places.""

They wonder where they should be looking.

Ashley drives through town, clearly tense about something. Byron knocks on her window, asking for a lift home. She says she's not going home. She drives off, and we now see she has wads of cash in her purse.

Toby waits at the church for his ride. Police cars pull up instead.

Back at Mona's party, Spencer figures out the note. They're supposed to go to Wright's Playground.

Hanna waits in the woods. A car pulls up.

Spencer and Emily go to the playground. A swing is swinging but no one's there.

Hanna tries to see who's getting in the car through her binoculars, but can't.

We see it's Ezra, waiting for Aria. He tells her he was a coward and should have fought for her. He was looking for another job so they'd have a chance. He thought she deserved a chance at an uncomplicated relationship. She tells him he doesn't get to decide that. He asks her to forgive him. She says no. Then she kisses him.

Hanna sees the car's headlights go out and can apparently see inside: ""Oh my god.""

Emily and Spencer find a tree with names carved in it: ""Allison +...."" They remove the moss to see ""Ian.""

Hanna watches as someone sneaks up on Ezra's car and writes ""I see you"" in the steamed up back window. She sends a text to Emily and Spencer: ""SOS. I know who 'A' is. Heading to the parking lot.""

It's completely dark and spooky as Hanna goes to the parking lot. The other girls appear on the other side of the lot. Hanna sees A running in the distance. She runs toward the girls in the parking lot, but they scream when they see a car coming right at her.

It runs her down.

She rolls up on the hood and then lies in the dirt as they call for help. She's not breathing. They get a text: ""She knew too much. -A""

Cut to someone's house, with the tape of Allison flirting with the camera playing on a laptop. We see the end of the tape, her taking the camera and turning it around on the person filming: it's Ian."

Cut to the girls watching Hanna being taken away in an ambulance. Aria looks over and sees Noel standing in the shadows.

Ashley tells the girls Hanna is badly hurt, several broken bones and a damaged spleen. They tell her about the car hitting Hanna. Nobody knows who driving the car and Ashley tells them it wasn't Toby, as he was picked up by the police last night.

Emily wants to tell the cops what they know, but Spencer thinks they should talk to Hanna first.

At home Spencer tells Mellissa what happened and learns that her sister is shacking up with field hockey coach Ian.

Ashley talks to Hanna in her hospital room and tells her Lucas came to visit her.

Some has written ""I see you"" into the back window of Ezra's car. He thinks someone saw them together last night but Aria isn't sure.

During breakfast Emily defends Toby to her parents.

The girls finally speak with Hanna at the hospital. After Ashley leaves the room Hanna tells them she thinks Noel is A. She saw him in the woods and saw him write on the back of Ezra's car. This leads to Aria coming clean about her and Ezra. There is a knock on the door. Aria answers the door to find Noel. She pretends Hanna is asleep and they go into the hallway.

Noel says he heard about the accident from someone else. He says they ""need to talk"" and asks her to call him. Noel lies to Aria and tells her he was somewhere else last night.

Back in the room Aria tells the girls about Noel's lie.

Emily's father Colonel tells Pam he's leaving again for work. Pam thinks Emily has been acting confused. Colonel thinks she should be direct with their daughter.

Hanna is having nightmares. She's visited by Mona, who cheers her up and ends up giving her a mini-makeover.

Aria, Emily and Spencer talk about Noel and the identity of Noel. They think Aria should find out what Noel saw.

We see a shadowy figure enter Hanna's room. It is Lucas, who kisses her on the forehead and leaves.

The next day Hanna tells her mother she doesn't need a private room. Ashley says she has figured out a ""professional courtesy"" with the bank to help them get back on their feet.

Aria confronts Noel about his lie. He assumes Ezra forced her to do something and they should go to the police. She tells him he doesn't understand and says the best thing he can do for her is not say anything to anyone.

Emily is making calls to see if she can visit Toby. Jenna hears this and says Toby doesn't want to see her. Jenna blames her for Toby running away. Emily wants to talk with him but Jenna doesn't want to let ""anyone come between us."" Emily makes reference to their relationship being inappropriate.

A medicated Hanna is visited in a dream by Alison. Alison says the four of them remember more about that night than they think they do. Alison assures her that the truth isn't always the best way to go.

Aria and Ezra discuss their relationship, but she doesn't mention what Noel knows. She asks whether he thinks the whole thing has been worth it.

Aria tells Emily she's not sure how to handle thing with Ezra.

Lucas visits Hanna. He confesses to kissing her while she was asleep. She awkwardly tells him she thought there were just friends and he basically brushes her off.

Colonel overhears Emily on the phone with Maya. This leads to him warning her about trying to visit Toby and asking her what is going on. She tells him she's afraid of him and Pam because they don't' know she's gay.

Aria tells Spencer about the origins of the relationship with Ezra. They are going to see the tree that had Alison's named carved into it but are stunned to find it has been cut down.

With Emily listening from the top of the stairs Pam and Colonel discuss their daughter's revelation. We learn someone mailed the Emily/Maya kissing pictures to Pam. Both are concerned but Pam seems far less understanding.

Aria and Spencer return to Spencer's place to find that Melissa and Ian have eloped. ""It's like last year never happened,"" Ian says. They haven't told Spencer's parents yet.

We see Ezra leaving his classroom after hours with Noel spying on him.

Emily tells the girls about telling her parents. They talk about the tree and Spencer thinks it's possible A is more than one person. They notice that A has signed Hanna's cast: ""Sorry about losing my temper. My bad. Love, A."" Hanna begins to panic."

Once the three are gone she gets the following text from A: ""Like Mommy, like daughter. Can you run from the law on those legs?""

Hanna confronts her mother about the cash she found. Ashley admits she ""borrowed"" the money from a bank customer with the idea of replacing it later. Hanna wonders how she'll pay back essentially stolen money and Ashley ignores her.

During dinner Emily's mother awkwardly asks about Maya's dietary needs. When she leaves the table Emily tells her father they should cancel if it will be too difficult. Colonel says Pam was up all night working on the menu.

Spencer (who is still going strong with Alex) is upset when she feels her mother is taking Melissa and Ian's eloping so passively. Veronica says should doesn't like what happened but advises her youngest to try and be happy for her sister. They see Toby walking into city hall and Veronica tells Spencer he is out on bail and probably visiting with his attorney.

At school Maya asks Emily if dinner is still on and Emily advises her to wear a dress. Aria gets a strange wave from Noel. Emily tells Maya her parents have been a little strange about her gay announcement and basically warns her that Pam isn't as easy-going as her mother.

After class Aria tells Ezra that Noel was the one who wrote on his car. She tells him Noel promised not to tell anyone but Ezra seems concerned. He wants them to talk about it later.

Emily tells Spencer she worried about dinner. Mona tells them she wants to have a welcome home party for Hanna.

Noel comes to see Ezra about a paper. Noel threatens that if the grade doesn't get changed from a 'C' to an 'A' he'll go to the principal about his relationship with Aria.

Ezra tells Aria that Noel isn't who she thinks he is. Jenna arrives with a slip for him to sign and hints that she may have overheard them.

Alex tells Spencer the pro recommended him for a tennis clinic over in Sweden. She thinks it's an outstanding opportunity but he says he's going to turn it down to stay in town and work construction. He tosses the form into the trash.

The Maya dinner couldn't be much more awkward: Emily forgot to tell her mother Maya was allergic to seafood. Maya's parents were anti-war protesters (Emily's father is in the military), her parents did not get married until she was old enough to be a flower girl in the ceremony and they tattooed their wedding ring. Colonel seems to be enjoying Maya but Pam is having trouble. She goes to the kitchen to look for something else to make Maya and begins weeping.

Mona surprises Hanna with a huge group of people at her house. Among them is Noel, who gives Hanna huge smile. She seems worried. Lucas is getting drunk and is still bitter about their ""break-up.""

Emily and Maya sneak onto the porch. Maya says the experience was exhausting and bails on Hanna's party. They kiss just as Pam walks out with some food for Maya's family.

Spencer suggests she and Alex sneak away to her parents' cabin. She spots Noel while they kiss and gets freaked out. Aria confronts Noel about his blackmail of Ezra. He lies about the whole thing, denying Ezra's accurate version.

Emily goes to see Toby and tells him that she tried to contact him in jail. She tells him she wasn't the one who talked to the police. He says he's been getting death threats. She asks him if she believes her about not calling and he turns the question back around on her. After she leaves he begins to remove the police tracking bracelet on his ankle.

Aria asks Hanna if she can leave the party and it starts an argument about Ezra. Hanna is hurt Aria didn't tell her about the relationship.

Spencer finds a furious Alex outside. He just got word that an application for the clinic in Sweden was submitted electronically on his behalf. Spencer is the only one he told and he's angry she didn't honor his wishes. She swears it wasn't her but he leaves. Immediately Spencer gets a text from A: ""Point, set, match!""

The increasingly drunk Lucas mocks Sean while he tells a story. Sean goes after him but Noel breaks them up before anything happens.

Hanna takes Lucas outside and asks why he even came. He rants about not letting people walk over him and lets slip that ""considering what (Alison) did to me I should have done way worse to her."" He admits to destroying the memorial because ""dying doesn't make you a saint."" She says she won't tell the cops. Sean comes outside and Hanna asks him how well he knows Noel. She asks him to tell everyone to go home.

Spencer tells Aria that she still thinks Noel is A. He walks by and she gives him a death stare.

Toby continues to work on breaking his bracelet. Jenna walks out to the porch and he tells her about Emily trying to contact him. He says Emily wasn't the one who turned him in. She says she knows, because it was actually her. She says he needs to be home where he's safe and strokes his face. Toby responds ""you can chain me to this porch and I'd still never touch you like that again."" She slaps him and walks inside.

While Hanna cleans up she hears something near the front of the house. She goes to investigate with a crutch and sees a shadow flash by. She backs into the kitchen and turns out the lights. Ultimately it turns out to be her mother. She goes to the pasta box and sees that the money is missing.

Pam tells Emily that Colonel is leaving at the end of the month. Emily thanks her for the evening, but Pam responds that she isn't okay with it, that ""it makes me sick to my stomach."" Emily is stunned.

Spencer's father indicates to her he doesn't love Ian. He says a police friend told him the blood stain found on the sweater at Toby's was a match for Alison and they probably won't investigate anyone else. Spencer looks at a Hilton Head tag on Ian's golf clubs and flashes back to Alison returning from a low-key weekend with her grandmother. The same tag was on Alison's suitcase but she brushed it off as nothing.

Hanna offers to call Sean to see if anyone saw anything but her mother cuts her off. She gives Ashley a pain killer to help her sleep. Once Ashley leaves Hanna finds a $100 bill rolled up in one of her pill bottles with a note from A: ""You'll get your $$ back. If you do what I say. Sweet dreams.""

During the closing credits we see gloved hands loading $100 bills into a piggy bank of some sort."

Spencer tells Emily she thinks Ian and Alison were today that weekend she disappeared and calls the Hilton Head course pretending to be Ian's husband looking for information on the room he stayed in on a past trip. Agent Cooper walks by while she's on hold.

Hanna's mother drops her off. Before getting out she apologizes for the cash going missing. Ashley said she had planned to invest the cash, so losing it will make it harder to replace what she ""borrowed"" from the bank.

Hanna joins the girls at their table and Agent Cooper says she'll be leaving town soon. Spencer hangs up and tells them Ian was definitely at Hilton Head the same weekend Alison was.

In school the girls wonder if perhaps A (possible Noel) could be helping them find Alison's killer. They see Noel talking to Aria's brother and Aria points out the two aren't friends. May shows up at the table and it seems the relationship is going well.

Noel shows up at Ezra's desk with a re-printed copy of his paper. He needs an A to be eligible for Friday's game and when he starts to spill the beans to another student Ezra says he'll give it another look.

Hanna finds one of her mother's $100 bills taped inside her locker, along with instructions from A telling her to go to an address on Main Street and ask for ""Hefty Hanna's order."" Toby shows up with a cop and grabs some things out of his locker. ""Killer"" is written across the locker and at least one student calls him a murderer.

Hanna gets a box of cupcakes at the address from A's note. She gets a text from A telling her that if she wants the money back she needs to eat the entire box. She spots Noel getting out of a car and it looks like he's watching her. She starts eating and a few guys sit nearby and make fun of her. She has a flashback to Alison comforting her during one of her heavier days and saying she can help her.

Emily's mom bursts in on Emily and Maya studying. She snaps at Maya, who quickly leaves. Emily tells Pam she's ashamed she is her mother.

As Hanna finishes the last cupcake she is spotted by Aria. Hanna gets a text from A saying ""You know how to get rid of it."" Aria sits with Hanna, who tells her about Alison teaching her how to purge during a low point. In the bathroom Hanna does not throw up, but finds some of the $100s taped to the paper towel dispenser.

Pam goes through Maya's bag, which she left in Emily's room. She finds a few joints.

Ezra gives back Noe's paper, again with a ""C"" on it. Noel says ""Do you know what this means?"" and Ezra doesn't seem to care.

Spencer watches as little kids literally cross the street to avoid Toby. She sees him duck into an alley and cry.

Pam asks Emily about the drugs and says she is no longer allowed to see Maya.

Before dinner Aria asks Mike about Noel. He says they hang out occasionally and Noel told him a rumor that Ezra was having a ""thing"" with a student. Bryon overhears this and asks Aria if she knows anything about it. She makes up an excuse about studying and leaves.

Aria goes to see Ezra, who tells her ""it's over."" He emphasizes that their relationship was real and that he plans to resign the following day to protect her. She says she loves him and they start fooling around.

After finding an ovulation kit Melissa tells Spencer she and Ian are trying to get pregnant. Ian walks in on the conversation.

Ashley catches Hanna trying to put the money back in the pasta box. She tells her mother about finding it in the bathroom of the restaurant.

Aria makes arrangements so she can stay over at Ezra's. They cuddle on a couch.

Despite being sworn to secrecy Spencer tells Hanna about Melissa wanting to get pregnant. Spencer thinks Ian is manipulating her sister. She says she wants to see the inside of Ian's boxes before they move. Emily walks up with news that Maya is headed to juvenile camp for three months because Pam busted her.

As Ezra walks towards to office to resign we see Noel getting busted to stealing answers to midterms. ""I don't see us ever believing you again,"" he is told. At that moment all the girls get a text from A saying ""A is for Alison not Amateur.""

At Spencer's the girls analyze this news about A. Before heading out for a date Melissa assures the girls she doesn't have to worry about Ian looking at other women. Emil arrives and all three girls seem giddy. They send her up to Spencer's room where Maya is waiting with candles. Maya isn't leaving until the next day. The other girls helped set up this final night. While the girls look through Ian's boxes we see someone watching them from outside.

Emily and Maya come downstairs as the person still watches from outside. Maya leaves and Emily thanks them. After striking out with Ian's boxes, Aria gets a text from A telling ""Don't say I never gave you anything, turn on your computer."" There is a video with Alison and Ian together and it seems to indicate a struggle followed by her falling to the ground.

They hear a noise and we someone flee the scene during the closing credits."

Ian walks into the room and very nearly catches them with the laptop open to a freeze-frame of him. The decide they will take the laptop to the police the next day.

Hanna is running a tight ship as organizer for an upcoming dance competition/fund-raising event that seems to have a presidential theme.

Spencer seems to be having cold-feet about their plan to turn over the Ian/Alison video to the police. Aria and Emily convince her that it's the right thing to do, particularly since it might prove Toby to be innocent.

Hanna and Sean have a conversation about fund-raising for the dance and she has to fib about her mother's ability to contribute. She also asks about the possibility for more work with his mother at the dental office.

Aria's mother surprises her by brining by her old babysitter, Simone. Simone is a writer and seems to be having lots of success since graduation. Of course her mother quickly mentions that she is trying to set-up Simone with Ezra.

Emily's not being allowed to call Maya at her camp. Hanna suggests paying a tech-savvy new kid (Caleb) to rig her phone so she can get through. She spots Lucas who is ignoring her.

Spencer notices that her laptop is missing. The only time it was out of her sight was during gym and the only people who could have access to her locker would be the coaches. Since Ian coaches field hockey the girls are worried he knows what they know.

Emily gets impatient Caleb is taking too long with her phone and wants to pay him more money to speed up the process. They strike up a conversation.

Hanna gets shot down for a possible job because he mother owes the store money. Afterwards Hanna gets a text from A: ""Wanna keep Mommy out of prison? I've got a job for you.""

Aria pops in on Ezra unannounced and finds him reading one of Simone's stories. He actually has to take off to meet with Simone and look over her writing. Aria is clearly bothered by the whole thing.

Spencer asks Ian if he's seen her laptop. He says he hasn't and asks whether she backs up her file. This leads to a conversation about his chaperoning the dance that night and he makes vague references to them putting the past behind them and acting like a family.

Emily spots Ian locking his briefcase in a desk drawer. As the dance starts the girls talk about checking Ian's bag to see if her laptop is there.

Byron shows up at the dance and has a brief conversation with Ella.

Simone arrives at the dance, saying she's there because Ezra mentioned he was chaperoning.

Caleb arrives with Emily's phone. Hanna isn't happy he charged her extra. When he walks away A sends Hanna a text: ""Job description: Heartbreaker. $200 for each dance with Lucas.""

Though it upsets Sean, Hanna gets Lucas to dance with her.

Emily hangs up with Maya and we get a sense the conversation wasn't great. She tells Spencer ""it was like she was there, but she wasn't.""

Aria interrupts Ezra and Simone and manages to get Ian's keys from his jacket.

Hanna gets Lucas to dance with her for another song, this one a slow dance.

Ella's mother seems to think Aria wants to spend more time with Simone.

Sean is upset that Hanna has now danced with Lucas for five. He storms off when she looks at an incoming text. It is A telling her dances with Lucas are now worth $500.

Caleb spots Spencer trying to get into Ian's drawer. He offers to help her get in and she eventually asks him how much it'll cost for him to talk.

Byron and Ella dance together. He suggests taking Simone out for pizza with the kids but she thinks it would be a mistake.

Emily grabs a flask that Hanna brought to the dance.

Spencer tells Aria that Ian's key broke but Caleb said he wouldn't say anything. Aria gets fed-up as Simone and Ezra continue to talk and Spencer has to step in and ask him to dance to keep her from embarrassing herself.

Outside Hanna finds that Emily is by herself and has finished off the entire flask. A drunken Emily thinks Hanna is being cruel to Lucas and says she thinks Alison would be proud of her. She leaves and another A text arrives for Hanna: ""You have Lucas' heart. Now rip it out. Last dance $1000.""

Spencer explains to Aria why she had to save her. Sean tries to apologize for his earlier actions and suggest they dance. She says she has to dance with Lucas but can't explain why. While Lucas watches from afar he breaks up with her. Lucas walks over to find her crying. He asks if she wants to talk and she says ""just dance with me"" and drapes her arms over his shoulders.

Aria and Spencer grab a drunken Emily, who is getting progressively louder as she talks about Ian. She walks over to him and says ""I know what you did. We all know. And you're not going to get away with it."" Ian grabs Spencer and demands to know what is going on. She says it is just about them having kissed before. He says that better the truth, or ""someone's going to get hurt.""

Emily plans to crash at Spencer's place. Lucas walks outside and offers to take her home. She says Emily ""needs me"" and he awkwardly walks away. Hanna reaches in her pockets and finds a huge wad of cash.

A weepy Aria tells Ezra she can't compete with Simone and that it makes sense he would want to be with her. He assures her ""I am already in love with someone else.""

Hanna won't let Emily drunk-dial Maya and puts her to bed. Hanna starts to tell Emily what she was doing with Lucas but sees that Emily has passed out.

Downstairs Spencer and Hanna find Spencer's laptop sitting on the table. The video is gone, but they find a picture of Alison taken in Spencer's yard the night she disappeared. There is a caption that reads ""Watch your backs. I didn't -- A."" There is a shadow behind Alison in the picture and Hanna asks Spencer if she knows who it is. ""I have no idea,"" Spencer says while staring straight ahead in shock."

The guess is that her brother Jason must have taken it and the plan is to ask him about it.

Hanna's mother gets word from the bank that the elderly client she ""borrowed"" $50,000 from is suddenly asking for a meeting with her. Ashley tells Hanna she comes into the bank once a year so this is bad news.

Spencer meets with Jason who is in town ""taking care of family business."" He's not sure if the picture is legit and will show it to a private investigator and see if it's real.

Emily is back with the swim teams and is kicking butt. The coach is impressed. A team leader, Paige, doesn't seem thrilled that Emily is back and performing so well.

Spencer gives Aria tickets for an art opening in Philly. The plan is for Aria to spend a night with Ezra out of town so the two can be a real couple.

After practice Paige addresses the rest of the team. She hopes to be the next captian and hands out gifts. The coach cuts her off to praise Emily and Paige is furious.

Aria suggests the tickets/out of town date idea to Ezra and he loves it.

Hanna has been skipping gym class and is given detention. Caleb overhears this and makes a crack about spending quite a bit of time there himself. He leaves and Hanna opens her locker to find a letter from A. It reads ""Wanna help mama get $$$$? Show Aria's mom what her kid's been hiding."" Inside is a ticket to the art exhibit Aria and Ezra will be attending.

At home Hanna finds her mother looking pretty down. She makes a comment about ""not matter what happens you'll always be my little girl"" and the two are emotional. Hanna leaves the room and goes over to the ticket and puts it in an envelope for ""Ella Montgomery.""

Paige corners Emily in the locker room, clearly threatened her captaincy is in jeopardy. After Emily denies any interest in being team captain Pagie makes a derogatory comment about her being a lesbian.

Hanna addresses the tickets from the school's PTA and puts them in Ella's box at school.

Later Hanna runs into Aria and immediately acts weird. She tells Aria it might be too risky to keep seeing Ezra and says she has a bad a feeling about the trip to Philly. Aria thinks Hanna's jealous and gets angry.

Emily tells Spencer and Aria about Paige and the comments. Spencer knows her and says she'll step in if Emily wants. Emily says no thanks and lets them open Paige's gift to the team. It turns out to a be a ""Go Sharks"" bracelet identical to the Alison bracelets they're all wearing. If it's from the same store maybe they can find out who bought the fake Alison bracelet.

In Ella's class Hanna starts having second-thoughts about giving her the ticket. This is confirmed with Spencer answers a school-related question and talks about standing up to bullies. This seals it and after the bell rings Hanna tries to get the letter back from Ella. But her detention proctor cuts her off and there is nothing Hanna can do. In detention Hanna tells Caleb that if Ella gets to Philly ""a lot of people are going to get hurt."" Caleb gets himself out of class with a fake call.

Ezra surprises Aria with a limo for their trip to Philly. We cut to Ella, whose car doesn't seem to be starting.

The swim coach has a sit-down with Emily and Paige. She makes a reference to anti-homosexual comments but Emily says it was just a misunderstanding.

Byron comes over to Ella and tries to help her start the car (which he bought for them when they were together). They think it has to do with an anti-theft measure and she's pretty mad.

Jason tells Spencer his PI thinks the picture is legit. He tells her he's not sure whether he took the photo or not because that summer he was pretty into drugs. He was hanging out ""a bunch of losers,"" one of whom was Ian. He says Ian was a master of pretending to be a preppy kid while being into drugs.

The conversation between Aria's parents turns to the fact Byron had a date that night. Despite that fact he still offers to drive Ella to her art opening.

Spencer tells Emily about Ian spending that summer at Alison's house. Spencer has an appointment to meet with an older woman who makes the bracelets in her house. She also tells Emily she was the one who told the coach about the comment Paige made. Emily isn't happy and Spencer makes a comment about Emily having never stood up for herself with Alison.

We see Aria and Ezra leave the museum talking about the fact the artist was a no-show for the big openign. This doesn't seem to bother them. They kiss and continue their evening an out-in-the-open couple.

A nervous Hanna goes to see her mom at work. While she's there they get word the elderly woman had a heart attack and died that day.

Later that evening Byron drops Ella off at the museum. They seems to be getting along pretty well and she gives him a peck on the cheek before getting out of the car and saying good-bye. The turns into seriously kissing and she doesn't make it out of the car.

Spencer visits the bracelet maker. She looks up her records and finds the purchaser was ""Spencer Hastings.""

Hanna finds Aria in school the next day. She is all set to confess until Aria says she had a great time and it is obvious she did not run into her mother.

After swimming a few laps Emily finds her head being held under the water for several seconds. It is Paige, who is angry she has been replaced as the anchor for the relay teams by Emily. She thinks that once again Emily has gone running to the coach to handle her problems.

Caleb reveals to Hanna that he was responsible for Ella's car from working the previous evening. She offers to pay him but he says he doesn't want her money. She asks what he wants and he says ""I'll think about it.""

Ella tells a briefly terrified Aria that she went to the art opening the night before. But she talks about meeting the artist so it is clear she never actually made it inside the museum.

While looking at the picture Spencer has a flashback of a huge argument she had with Alison that night. Alison was basically forcing her to tell Melissa ""everything."" Spencer is furious and basically hints that the four of them might no longer hang out with her. Spencer last words are ""you are dead to me already."" Alison leaves out the front door and after a moment Spencer follows.

Spencer tells the girls that she shadow in the picture was her. She didn't tell them originally because she so guilty about what she had said to Alison that maybe she was to blame because of what happened. Spencer looks out the open window to another open window. Jason is there and has been listening."

Spencer looks out the window and sees that Toby's mailbox was the one smashed. Spencer apologizes to Emily for how she treated Toby. Emily thinks she should apologize to Toby.

Someone's been stealing food from the vending machines and sneaking out of the school late at night. Aria tells Hanna about the ticket she found. She things it's weird her mother had a ticket to same show but Hanna tells her not to worry about it.

Hanna tells Caleb to make sure he doesn't tell anyone about what he did to Ella's car. He thinks she owes him for keeping quiet. He leaves and she gets a text from A: ""Caleb's quiet, but how R U gonna shut ME up.""

Emily and Paige finish in a dead-heat during a race in practice. This means there will have to be a run-off the following morning to figure out who will be the anchor for the next race. Paige is still super-focused on winning above all else.

Aria talks to her mother about the ticket and her Philly trip. She admits she didn't' actually go the show, but instead had dinner with ""a friend.""

Calebe tells Hanna he needs her help finding new clients with money to spend.

Emily tells Spencer about the swim-off. Spencer convinces that it's okay to want to win. Spencer sees a sign for tutoring Toby in French. Emily thinks it's a bad idea, but Spencer thinks it could be a good opportunity to find out if the person who gave her name to the bracelet woman is the same one who framed him.

Spencer tells Ian she's going to miss practice to tutor and it leads to an argument. He wants her to cut him some slack. Melissa shows up and Spencer tells them about working with Toby. They hate the idea and Spencer makes a crack about Ian's history of lying.

Spencer shows up at Toby's place. The sit on the porch and he asks her why she's there.

Aria continues to worry about how close she came to being busted at the museum by her mother. Hanna continues to say it's a coincidence she shouldn't worry about. Aria hears Byron make plans to go out. He tells her it wasn't her mother but Aria isn't sure and tells Hanna they have to follow him.

Spencer remembers that Toby has read Catcher in the Rye and gives him a French version of the book to help with his studies. He thinks she must want something or she wouldn't be there. She thinks he is being framed and is worried the same thing is happening to her. She apologizes for what she thought about him. Toby says after giving Alison the sweater she got into a car with ""some guy."" They notice something in a window and he quickly goes inside.

Spencer tells Emily she finds Toby ""different"" than she expected. Spencer is trying to find a connection between Toby and Alison or Toby and her.

Aria and Hanna tail Byron to the school. Hanna suggests she call her mother and we see that Ella is, in fact, at the school having a secret rendezvous with Byron. Aria doesn't believe her mother's story that she it at home and walks towards the school. Hanna follows.

Inside in the library we hear that Byron and Ella are keeping their new connection a secret because they themselves aren't sure what is happening. Aria spots them in the library and realizes ""my parents are having an affair with each other."" Hanna looks in vent and finds a bunch of cell phones, some cash and a few other supplies. She shows Aria and thinks it must be A's stuff. Hanna grabs the cash. We see that someone is watching them and a hooded figure begins chasing them. Eventually Hanna sprays the person with mace and it turns out to be Caleb.

Caleb has no place to crash and has been living at school. His foster parents don't care and his social worker ""is a joke.""

Emily gets a text that alarms her. She goes to the front door and sees a soaked Paige standing in the pouring rain. She is crying and tells Emily she understands why Emily might hate her and apologizes. Emily tries to stop her but she gets on her bike and leaves.

The next day the coach tells them there will be no swim-off because Paige ""had an accident while riding her bike last night.""

Caleb exchanges info about potential clients for answering questions about his past. He stops short of talking about his real parents.

The swim meet begins. Outside the pool Melissa asks Spencer what he problem is with Ian. Melissa says it was her who proposed and wanted to elope. Spencer tells her to ask him about Alison and the summer she was killed. Paige shows up at the meet and watches Emily come from behind to win the relay.

Aria gets a text from A that reads: ""Almost got you busted. Wanna know how? Ask Hanna!""

Hanna finds Caleb fishing his stuff out of a trash can. He tells her the debt is paid and she offers a place to stay. He passes but she gives him her address and tells him there's an old couch in the basement. Aria comes over and shows Hanna the text from A. Hanna fesses up to what she did. Aria is furious and doesn't want to hear any excuses.

Paige tells Emily she fell down on her bike and makes it sound like she might be finishes with the swim team. Emily tells her the key to avoid burnout is to swim for yourself. She asks Paige when the last she swam ""for fun"" was and the two jump in the pool and swim some laps.

Spencer arrives at Toby's and he tells her ""this isn't going to work."" He gives her back the book she gave him and closes the door.

We see Aria avoiding Hanna's calls and texts. A tearful Hanna tells Caleb what is going on and he comforts her.

Melissa tells Spencer she knows about her and Ian. Spencer says she thinks he's dangerous and Melissa says she doesn't want to fight. Melissa reveals that she's pregnant. Spencer doesn't react and Melissa storms off. Spencer looks down at the book she got back from Toby. Inside is a piece of paper. On it is a Braille phrase, along with: ""I found this in Jenna's rom. You may be right. --Toby.""

As the final credits roll we see a gloved figure listening to a record on learning to speak French. It begins skipping on the phrase ""Je suis."""

Ashley heads to the bank to return the small amount of cash they have left. Hanna points out that Mrs. Potter doesn't need the money anymore and suggests that if it doesn't need to sit in the safe deposit box it should go to someone who needs it. Her mom just wants the whole ordeal to be over. When Ashley leaves Hanna lets Hanna upstairs from the basement. He says he's saving money to go live with a friend in Arizona. Ashley comes back for a second and almost catches Caleb.

Aria and Hanna make up. The both apologize and realize A is the real bad guy.

We see Ezra talk to some a few teachers about a book-signing with a published author. Ella is listening and says she might like to come along.

The girls give Hanna grief for getting close to Caleb. A man names Nick walks into the cafeteria looking for the swimming coach. He is Paige's dad and he is furious that the school is giving preferential treatment to Emily over his daughter just because she's gay. Ezra intercepts him and talks him down.

Ashley has a meeting with a man named James Leeland. To her shock he claims to be a long-lost relative of Mrs. Potters, her great-nephew. He wants to look at the safe deposit box and has already prepared copies of his identification for her to present to the state revenue agency. He is an architect. At the end of the meeting he asks her out for drinks.

Paige tells Emily that she didn't say anything about her being gay. Her day must have asked around.

Ella tells Byron he should make sure to meet with Ezra during Aria's parent-teacher conferences. She has lots of good things to say about him and Byron seems a tad jealous. He says something about them getting together that Friday and she mentions going to the book-signing with Ezra. He thought she didn't care for the author.

Spencer goes to see Toby, who is leaving for the prosecutor's office. She asks about the ""BAD"" and he says she's reading it wrong. He tells her to come back the next day. Spencer gets a text that reads ""Jenna is gonna be soooo pissed --A.""

Emily's worried about Hanna talking to Caleb and she says she hasn't told Pam anything about Paige's father. Araia tells Spencer she and Hanna are fine now. Spencer says Toby wanted them to have the message. Spencer realizes that Arais is calling from Ezra's house while she waits for him to get back with takeout.

Ezra gets home and makes a comment about meeting Byron. He's a little more worried about that than he is dealing with Ella.

Ashley gets ready to meet James. Hanna clearly doesn't trust this guy. The doorbell rings and it is Caleb. Hanna is stunned and Ashley doesn't like the look of him. He is polite and ends up coming inside to study. James arrives and is greeted by Caleb. Caleb watches him closely as he signs a form before leaving with Ashley. After they leave Hanna tells him what's going on with James. Caleb points out that for being an architect he used a cheap pen.

The meeting with Ezra and Byron turns contentious. Bryon brings up the fact he's ""going out with my wife"" and starts ripping the author they're going to see.

While the girls our out shopping Aria and Hanna tell the other girls what happens with A and the trip to Philly. They tell them how Caleb helped and Hanna says he's been staying in the basement. They see Jenna trying on a lace nighty. She tells the clerk ""I want it to be perfect. He likes lace.""

Ezra tells Aria the meeting with her dad went terribly. ""He hates me or he's crazy.""

Spencer looks at the Braille and seems to figure something out.

Pam arrives at the school for the parent-teacher conferences and Ella fills her in about Nick and his trip to the cafeteria. Pam had no idea.

Toby tells Spencer that for the moment he's not being charged with Alison's murder because the blood evidence was ""corrupted.""

Caleb tells Hanna he's done research on the man her mother is out with. He's using the name of a legitimate architect who died several years ago.

Jenna pulls out at home in a cab. She heard the good news and wants to take Toby to the police station to have his ankle bracelet removed. He says he already has a ride, grabs Spencer's hand and leaves her standing there.

Ashley decides that saying about the fake great nephew would only draw attention to the situation. She also doesn't trust Caleb. The plan is to show ? him the safety deposit box and ""go from there.""

Byron tells Aria that based on the parent/teacher conference meeting he thinks Ezra is a ""lightweight."" Aria defends him but Byron isn't having it. He lets slip that Ella is part of the situation and Aria tells him the thing Ezra is taking her too is being attended by half the department.

When Ashley opens the box James is clearly surprised to only see $3,000 in there. When he starts fishing about the possibility money was stolen Ashley makes a reference to his bank in Syracuse that lets him know she might know he's full of it. He smiles.

Pam comes to school and asks Emily if the story about Blaine's father is true. Emily says she didn't think her mother would defend her. Pam promptly turns to Paige's father and threatens that if he doesn't drop this crusade ""I'll show you what a real agenda looks like."" Afterwards a weepy Pam tells Emily she loves her and apologizes.

Toby and Spencer end up at a lookout point-type area overlooking the city. She's figured out that the Braille symbols actually spelled out 214 but doesn't know what it means. He doesn't either, saying only that he overheard Jenna talking about Spencer to someone and made a rubbing of what she wrote. He thinks they need to find out what she's up to and says he doesn't trust his sister. He thinks Jenna is afraid of Alison's friends.

Emily gets in her car to drive home. Paige jumps in the passenger seat and says Pam was right about her dad. When Emily starts complaining how tough her life is at the moment Paige leans over and kisses he deeply. She says ""don't tell"" and jumps out of the car.

Caleb makes a comment about perhaps not being in a huge hurry to leave for Arizona. She thanks him and they stare at each other before he heads downstairs. There is a knock at the door. It's an exterminator who has gotten a call from someone named ""A"" about ""infestations in the basement."" Hanna gets rid of him but realizes what's happened.

We see Ezra and Aria making out on his couch. The phone rings with a call from Byron. He's read some of Ezra's stories and wants to have a beer with him.

We see Spencer and Toby drive past a motel. The camera zooms in to focus on room 214.

During the closing credits we see someone lay flowers at the gravestone of Mrs. Esther Marie Potter."

Spencer is woken up from a nightmare by Ian packing up some of his stuff to make room for baby stuff. He tells her Melissa told him what she said at the swim meet. He tells her he had nothing to do with Alison's death and tells her that Alison wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer and was all but stalking him.

Ashley notices that food is missing. She reiterates to Hanna that she doesn't like Caleb being her friend and turns down her request for him to stay with them for a little while. After Ashley leaves Caleb surfaces and Hanna says she'll asks again.

Aria stops by Ezra's place. She lies and says her friends don't know about them and he says he's cast Hanna and Spencer in the play. She asks him to make her stage manager so they'll have more opportunities to see each other. He doesn't like the idea but agrees.

While Caleb is showering Hanna goes into the bathroom to grab her makeup. While in there her mother comes in looking for her phone. Hanna is forced to jump into the shower with a naked Caleb so her mom thinks she's the only one in there. Her mother doesn't discover Caleb but Hanna gets an eye-full of Caleb.

Spencer sees Paige calling Emily's cell phone. Emily doesn't mention the kiss. Spencer still hasn't figured out the meaning of ""214."" Emily asks to return Toby's book because she wants to make sure he knows she didn't turn him in. Across the courtyard they notice Ian give Jenna a bag.

During the next play practice Hanna tells Mona about the shower incident with Caleb. Mona, the lead, is acting like a diva. At one point Aria slips up and calls Ezra ""Ezra"" instead of ""Mr. Fitz."" The subject of Ian comes up and we get a flashback to the girls and Alison crashing a fraternity party of Ian's. Alison made them all fake IDs. Inside they spot Ian (newly dating Melissa) helping take an obviously drunk girl upstairs. Alison suggests they split up.

Emily drops by Toby's. He tells her that Jenna was the one who turned him in: ""Her way of keeping me close to home."" She suggests they go out for breakfast as friends to celebrate his being free. He agrees on the following morning.

Aria dad Byron shows up at Ezra's office for their happy hour trip. Byron is complimentary of Ezra's writing and impact on his students.

Hanna seems weird around Caleb.

At the bar Byron lets slip that Aria has looked at colleges in California. He seems surprised. Byron also mentions that if Ezra worked at a college he'd have more time to write.

Spencer tells Toby about Ian giving Jenna a bag. She thinks they need to steal her phone and find out if she's been in contact with Ian. They can get Caleb to unlock her phone in an attempt to figure out the 214 thing.

Emily shows up at Toby's for their breakfast. Jenna tells him she's left with Spencer and makes a crack about it feels to be ""second choice.""

Toby gives Spencer the phone, worried Jenna will find out. Afterwards Toby tells her that he did not spy on them the night of Jenna's accident. He says Alison made that up. Toby says the whole ""Alison thing"" never made any sense to him.

Prior to the next play practice Aria apologizes to Ezra for her slip-up. He's made at himself because he never thought them working on the play together was a good idea. A few comments about the future are made.

Hanna gives Caleb Jenna's phone and asks him to try and hack it.

There is confusion that Aria didn't do her job telling everyone in the play about the upcoming Saturday play. They clear the room and Ezra and Aria begin talking about the future. He is thinking about college jobs and doesn't seem confident about them still being together when she leaves high school.

Outside the other three girls spot Ian and flashback to the fraternity party. The drunk fell down the stairs and was badly hurt. Emily saw Ian standing at the top of the stairs but never mentioned it. They wonder now whether it might not have been an accident.

Caleb isn't able to get into Jenna's phone. When Hanna pushes him for results he mentions she's been acting weird about their shower run-in.

During practice we get yet another flashback to the fraternity party. While the four girls watched the drunk girl get loaded into an ambulance Alison finally showed up. When they suggest leaving Alison is bold enough to ask a cop to give them a ride home. Following practice Spencer spots a trophy from Ian's golf down in Hilton Head in a crate. It has what looks like dried blood on a corner and the decision is made to take this potential murder weapon straight to the police.

After dropping the trophy off at the station the four girls think they might be putting the saga of Alison's death behind them. Three of the girls (other than Hanna) decide to stay at Emily's place.

On the way home Aria drops by Ezra's place to say she agrees working on the play was a bad idea. She goes on a rant about the future being uncertain and cites a desire for them to be happy in the moment. He kisses her.

Hanna and Caleb finally discuss what happened in the shower. She makes reference to possibly wanting something to happen between the two of them and they kiss.

Thinking Ian will be hauled away in cuffs, the girls are stunned with a detective walks over to them during school the next day. It turns out the trophy was a fake (there was no golf tournament in Hilton Head at that time) and the blood on it was from a rat. They are taken down to the station themselves for more questioning.

Afterwards they all get a text from A: ""'Rat' me out, your blood's next."" They now wonder if perhaps Ian was right about Alison stalking him and wonder whether she might have been the one to shove the drunk girl down the stairs. They next wonder if Alison though Jenna was blocking her way to Ian and threw the firecracker in the garage knowing Jenna was in there. Ian glares at them from the steps.

During the closing credits we see rats in cages."

When the detective questions the likelihood of Ian being interested in a younger girl none of them tell him about his relationship with Spencer.

Afterwards the kids' parents are told the girls are free to go. The adults think the girls are victims of a prank.

In the hall the girls confirm to each other they all lied about Spencer and Ian. One of Emily's neighbors, Garrett Reynolds, walks by. He's a low-level cop who seems to like the girls.

The detective working the case tells Garrett he going to want him to do some research into the girls to make sure they're telling the truth.

Spencer's parents tell her they think she should see a therapist. Spencer says there's nothing wrong with her, only that she's scared of being near Ian. Ian and Melissa walk into the room and say they hope she gets the help she needs. Spencer responds she doesn't know why Ian even came back since he would have ""gotten away with it"" if he'd stayed away. Spencer and Melissa yell at each other.

Emily wants to talk with Paige about their kiss. Paige wants to pretend it didn't happen.

Spencer takes Toby to a motel where he's going to stay for a few days until his parents get home. Jenna isn't sure it was him who stole her phone, he says, but the suspicion makes living there bad enough. Toby promises that if Jenna has anything to do with her being framed he'll help. He leaves and she hears flute music comes from a nearby room. She knocks on the door and it stops. She looks in through a window and sees the green bag Ian gave Jenna a few days earlier. She sees that the room is No. 214.

When Hanna's mother goes upstairs for a shower Caleb surfaces from the basement. They start to get friendly and her mother come back down, complaining that the toilet seat was left up again. Hanna eventually admits Caleb's been over a few times to help her with homework and defends him to her mother as being a good guy. She leaves and Caleb comes back inside for a kiss.

Aria walks to Ezra's classroom and sees him having a conversation with Jenna. At that exact moment she gets a text from A: ""The LOVER and the SCORNED are now BFFs. Scared yet? You will be."" Jenna leaves and Ezra says he was talking to Jenna about a writing competition. Her story is about a blind person whose brother is responsible for an accident.

Emily finds a note in her locker from Paige asking to meet that night.

Spencer tells Hanna and Emily about room 214 and her desire to get inside. Spencer sees Garrett in the hall and asks him to follow-up on the Hilton Head story. He says he's waiting on a call-back about Ian and Alison being down there. He asks about Ian's motive and she says it was that Alison was going to tell Melissa about their affair.

In the bathroom Jenna makes a reference to 1984 and Big Brother always watching.

Spencer brings Toby some things and they pay a cleaning lady to let them into 214. Inside they find Jenna's glasses. The bag from Ian is in the closet but it's empty.

Hanna's mom catches Caleb and Hanna making out. She's also found his stuff in the basement and realizes he's been there for weeks. She's pissed and tells him to leave. Hanna begs her to let him stay, to which she replies ""we don't lie to each other.""

Emily meets Paige at a diner in the middle of nowhere. Seeing Emily with Maya let he know she was gay and their kiss the other day was her first-ever with another girl.

Ezra comes home to find Aria in her best dress. Ezra talks about Jenna and this irritates Aria.

Hanna brings Caleb a tent after he turns her down for getting him a hotel room. She tells him about being heavy and he says he's never met his father. He thinks his mother is in Arizona but he doesn't know for sure. More making out.

Paige sings karaoke while Emily watches with a huge grin. She brings Emily on stage and they finish the song together.

Spencer is still in Toby's room waiting on Jenna to show. They play Scrabble and he appears to be challenging her intellectually. She spies on him as he undresses.

After karaoke Emily and Paige kiss in the parking lot.

Spencer gets into bed with Toby, though it doesn't look anything happens.

Hannah and Caleb go all the way in the tent.

Emily notices Aria is ignoring Ezra's phone calls. She mentions being bothered by Jenna and her story. Emily thinks Aria needs to tell him the truth.

Spencer wakes up the next morning with her arm around Toby. She carefully removes it and gets out of bed. They hear flute music in 214 and creep into the room. The music is coming from a radio. The bag from Ian is on the bed. It's filled with ice and there is a note from A which reads: ""You're getting colder."" Spencer lies to Toby and says she has no idea who A is.

Emily is bothered when Paige reminds her she can't be seen with her in public. Emily doesn't love the thought of a relationship existing in the shadows and says they need to just be friends.

Aria goes to see Ezra and tell him weepily she's been debating telling him something.

Hanna returns home to an angry mother. She walks past her mother upstairs after saying ""you of all people should understand."" Hanna's phone rings with Caleb and she answers it.

Toby kisses Spencer in the parking lot of the motel. She's into it.

Caleb walks into the kitchen and we learn he's been invited to dinner. Ashley tells him he can stay in their guest room for a short time and then warns him not to hurt her daughter.

Arai has told Ezra about her regrets from ""that night."" He says he still loves her and she thanks him for not looking at her differently.

After Hanna goes to bed Ashley says ""you can call me Ashley"" and smiles at him. He ducks onto the deck and makes a phone call: ""I can't do this anymore,"" he tells someone on the other line. ""It's over. I'm out.""

Spencer comes home and finds a cop car outside their house. Melissa tells her that Ian was actually in Hilton Head with her. They had gone down there to get an abortion. She lost the baby before they got to the doctor and Ian had been lying to protect her. Her parents come into the room, angry that their daughter hasn't been honest with the police. They know she was seeing Ian and Spencer looks into the living room and sees Garrett.

Emily gets an ""S.O.S."" text from Spencer. All three of the other girls go to Spencer's place and watch her talk to the police from across the street. They simultaneously get a text from A: ""Breaking news, bitches. Spencer Hastings now a person of interest in my death.""

During the closing credits we see someone in a rocking chair viewing videotape (with audio) of the girls watching Spencer and getting the text."

While she freaks out we get a strange shot of Ian taking a swig of milk and glaring at Spencer.

Aria finds out her mother stayed the night. Byron gets caught in a lie about it and both he and Ella tell her ""it just sort of happened."" They tell Aria and Mike they're thinking about ""trying something.""

Hanna finds out about the search warrant while cooking with Caleb. While putting Caleb's lunch in his bag she notices a piece of pendent jewelry she thinks is for her.

Hanna shows a picture of the jewelry (an owl) to Emily and Aria. She thinks it is a reference to their night in the woods. The girls see Sean chatting it up with Paige. Spencer sits down and tells them about the search. She says there is a chance it could happen to the three of them.

Aria tries to send a mushy text to Ezra. But she accidentally sends it to her mother who looks happily curious about whom her daughter's love interest might be.

Sean tells Emily he's interested in Paige. Emily says she doesn't have any information for him.

During a free period Ella shows Aria the text. She's not upset, but wants to know who the new boy might be. A stammering Aria tells her it's ""private, right now"" and that seems to be okay.

Aria takes some ""Ezra things"" out of her room.

While Spencer sits deleting emails from her laptop Toby shows up and tells her there's an undercover cop car across the street. She tells him about the search and the fact she's a ""person of interest."" He suggests she take the cops some coffee to show them she's no afraid. She thinks she is pretty suspicious to the cops right now and he points out they are in the same boat.

Emily and Paige discuss Sean. She is going with him to the lake with a group of people.

Ella tells Byron about Aria's secret romance. He doesn't have as much of a hand's off view of the situation as she does.

Aria gives the Emily stuff to Emily to keep in her locker. The two overhear Caleb on the phone telling someone about Hanna that ""it's different now. I don't think she's who you say she is.""

The girls tell Hanna they think Caleb was talking to another girl. Hanna is in full denial mode, saying ""you heard wrong."" Jenna walks by wearing the owl pendant from Caleb's bag around her neck.

Emily overhears Paige bragging about Sean to another girl.

Just as Spencer is about to confront Jenna she sees her take the owl off her neck and take off its head. It's really a flash drive.

Hanna still doesn't think the Caleb/Jenna thing is what it looks like.

After putting a note in his locker she tries 214 on his combination. It opens the lock right up.

Hanna confronts Caleb, who says Jenna offered him money to listen to her. He says his feelings for her changed everything but Hanna is still pissed he was spying on her. He grabs his bag and leaves her house.

Spencer tells Toby about Hanna, Caleb and Jenna. He feels somewhat responsible. She tells a story about running away when she was younger. It came after a fight with her sister and after she returned a few hours later her parents had no clue she'd been gone. Byron picks up a book in Aria's room. Ella walks in and confronts him about prying and points out that she may have learned it from them. This leads to an argument that Mike walks in on.

No one has heard from Hanna. Aria wonders if she should pick a boy out at random so her parents will stop asking questions.

Hanna shows up at school and tells Emily and Aria that ""it's all true."" Jenna walks into the bathroom. Hanna slaps her in the face, knocking her glasses onto the floor. She hands back the glasses and identifies herself.

Mike is blaming Aria for their parents fighting. He wants her to make it better, even if that means lying to them. Downstairs Byron tells them Ella isn't shoing up for the big dinner the kids made.

Spencer comes at night to find Ian sitting alone in the dark with a cocktail. She thinks he wants her to run away and he says only that she should take the help that's offered: ""Because when they arrest you, it'll be too late.""

Paige stops by at Emily's place after her date with Sean. He kissed her tonight and she realized the night was a sham. Paige is looking for advice about coming out, worried the world will change if she admits who she is. This leads to them kissing.

Ashley overhears Hanna crying and mentions through the door that Caleb's stuff is gone. He's left.

Spencer's mom says they have a shot at having the search warrant thrown out. But she adds a police source of her says there were some fibers in her bracelet that match Alison's sweater. Her mother thinks someone is trying to set her up and Spencer seems relieved she is supporting her."

Spencer thinks she notices someone watching them from outside the restaurant. After they leave we see Garrett the cop is hiding in the shadows.

The next morning Spencer overhears Melissa and her mom talking about her. Veronica wants Spencer to help out with the town's founder's festival, in part because of public opinion related to neighbors who could become jurors. Toby calls and her mother won't let Spencer answer the phone.

Mona shows up while Ashley is awkwardly asking Hanna about Caleb. When Hanna confirms Caleb is gone for good Mona apologizes for letting her friend get hurt.

Caleb approaches Aria in the hall to talk about Hanna. Ella spots this conversation and mouths to Aria ""Is that him?""

Paige tells Emily she got tickets to a concert. Emily's isn't thrilled to learn a boy named Troy is coming for ""insurance."" Paige is considering coming out to her parents and Emily agrees to go with her when she meets someone from a college pride group.

Aria talks to Ezra about them hanging out at home instead of going to the festival together. She is trying to avoid her mother seeing her talking to him.

Hanna asks Caleb about his job spying for Jenna. He says Jenna offered him a lot of money to find a key that came from Alison. Caleb tells her he misses her but Hanna is having none of it.

Aria tells Spencer she doesn't want to tell Ezra about her parents sniffing around. She's at Ezra's waiting for him and his laptop accidentally turns on. She sees a social network page that appears to show Ezra writing to a woman whose profile picture is of her and Ezra together. He calls to say he's running late at work and she abruptly says something came up and she has to leave.

None of the girls know what Alison's key might have been. Aria tells them about the girl (Jackie) Ezra was with in the pictures. She's convinced that since Jackie was wearing an engagement ring it means Ezra is leading a triple life.

Spencer goes to see Toby. With the police sitting nearby he doesn't think they should talk there. Spencer tells him her place won't work either so they agree to talk at the festival. Spencer walks past Garrett's cruiser. He gets out and tells her it's better he is the one tailing her, rather than someone who thinks she's guilty.

Emily arrives at the coffee shop a little early and finds the girl from campus pride club, Samara, already waiting on Paige.

Hanna has found the name of a woman (Tonya Freeman) who went to the same college as Jackie and Ezra but doesn't have an account on the social network site. The plan is to ""friend"" Jackie and get more information on her relationship with Ezra.

Emily and Samara talk about the issues dating a closeted girl and they realize Paige probably isn't going to show. Samara invites Emily to her art table at the festival.

During festival set-up Spencer and Ian continue to butt heads. The topic of Hilton Head comes up and after Melissa and Ian mess up a detail related to one of the hotels there Spencer asks her sister whether she was ever at Hilton Head. Melissa turns and walks away without saying a word.

Emily and Samara enjoy each other's company at the festival when Paige walks by. Paige seems really bothered by the whole scene.

Caleb stops by Hanna's place to return a tool he still had. He tells Ashley that Hanna is lucky to have her and tries to give her a letter for Hanna (who is at the festival). Ashley suggests he go to the festival and give it to Hanna in person.

Paige is upset at Emily for talking about her at all. Paige begins snapping at both of them. Emily says she's tired of Paige's drama and leaves.

Jackie accepts the friend request. But instead of viewing the page Aria clicks ""remove this friend."" She's had a change of heart about spying.

Caleb shows up looking for Hanna. Hanna has Mona tell him to get lost. He gives Mona a letter to give to Hanna and leaves. Mona promptly opens the letter, tears it up and throws it in the trash without telling Hanna. The camera pans to the trash and we see that in the letter Caleb told Hanna ""I love you.""

Ian and Spencer have another brief confrontation at the festival.

Aria confronts Ezra about what she saw on his laptop with him and Jackie. He tells her Jackie was a college girlfriend, his first serious one. He proposed to her when they were in Italy and she was the one who decided against it. Ezra wonders if maybe Aria isn't bothered by the fact they can't take a picture together. He assures her ""that was then, you are very much now.""

Ashley tells Hanna that Caleb stopped by their house and that he is leaving Rosewood. She thinks her first impression of Caleb was wrong.

As Emily sits at home admiring the earrings she got from Samara, she gets a text from Paige wanting to talk. The next text comes from A: ""Poor Em, You definitely have a type. Love me, lie for me."" Emily flashes back to Alison giving her a vintage snow globe and telling her ""you're the only who understands me, Em."" Before leaving Alison told Emily ""Make sure you keep that in a safe place, it's a lot more valuable than it looks."" Emily walks over to the snow globe and starts looking at it. Underneath she finds a storage facility key had been hidden.

As a joke Aria and Ezra take a picture together with each wearing a bag over their head. Emily sends out a text about finding the key and Aria leaves. We see Garrett lurking in the hall of Ezra's apartment building.

At the festival Spencer gets a text from Toby asking her to meet in the fun house. Inside she sees written in huge letters on one of the walls: ""Shut up or I'll shut you up. --A"" She goes through a side door and finds herself in a tiny area. An unseen person jams something into the door, locking her in.

Aria finds Hanna at the festival and tells her about Emily and the key.

Spencer at this point is freaking out, screaming for someone to let her out.

Garrett knocks on Ezra's door and asks if he can come in. Garrett says ""I'd like to talk to you about one of your students.""

Spencer drops her phone while trying to call Aria.

Hanna and Aria pass Caleb, who is getting on a bus. Hanna doesn't go over to him and he leaves.

Ian opens the door with a crowbar and rescues Spencer. The rest of Spencer's family is there and Ian tells Veronica someone intentionally trapped her in. Spencer looks at her phone and sees a different text from Toby. The first text that told her to come inside the fun house was from somebody else. Outside Spencer is shuffled away from Toby by her mother. But Spencer rushes over to him, hugging and kissing him in full view of everyone.

Hanna, Aria and Emily open the storage lock. Inside is only a childhood lunch box of Alison's. Inside the lunch box is a flash drive. Hanna grabs it and they leave.

The video on the flash drive shows someone has been spying on them for years. But Alison is in most of the videos, so it wasn't her. Spencer thinks Alison's knowledge of these videos is what got her killed.

During the closing credits we see someone take the spare key from under the mat in front of Ezra's door."

Ashley tries to convince Hanna to cheer up. She asks about Caleb's letter and Hanna says she never got it.

Spencer makes a crack about Melissa's baby not being human. Both her sister and mother are upset.

Pam tells Emily her dad will be on assignment in Texas for longer than he thought and he wants them to stay with them for a year. She responds that she's finally starting to belong, but Pam doesn't seem sympathetic.

After making a joke about having to resign (he did it because he got another job) Ezra tells Aria the officer (Garrett) was just asking standard question. This means he will no longer be her teacher.

Hanna mentions Caleb's letter to Mona. She basically says it wouldn't matter either way, but looks guilty when Hanna says she feels stupid for thinking Caleb actually loved her. Hanna spots Lucas, who is still mad at her.

All four girls follow Jenna into a room at school. Spencer tells her about the video and they say they want the truth. She tells them the day before Alison went missing she came to see Jenna in the hospital and played her the video. Alison says ""The guy I like likes to make movies."" Alison says as long as Jenna ""keeps our secret"" the video will stay hidden. Alison said she was on her way back from Georgia.

After Jenna leaves they decide the video was Alison's insurance policy. They surmise the reason Jenna showed up at the funeral was because ""she could.""

The girls buy a pre-paid cell phone in order to contact Ian. The plan is to tell them they want money in exchange for the video, with plans to video tape him when he tries to make the buy. They send him a text ""I have Ali's video"" and watch as he looks at his phone and leaves the room. This proves to all of them that he is guilty. Ian responds wanting to know what they want. Hanna grabs the phone and texts ""Bring $10,000 to Willow Park. 9pm. Come alone.""

Mona shows up and the girls leave, with Hanna leaving her cell phone behind. Caleb calls and she picks it up. Mona lies to Caleb, telling him she gave Hanna the letter and Hanna threw it away. Luke overhears this and realizes Mona is lying. She tells him if he forgets about the letter she'll help transform him.

Jenna answers a phone call from Ian. She tells him ""They've got the video and they've seen it."" He tells her not to worry, that he'll take care of it.

An off-duty Garrett tells Emily he knows she wouldn't have done anything to hurt Alison. He gives her his cell in case she needs anything. Hanna is waiting for Emily on her porch. She gives Hanna her phone. Emily is not thrilled about moving to Texas.

Spencer and Toby are studying together. He brings her over to the window, opens it, and the two of them sit together on a chair.

We see Jenna telling someone ""If this gets out we'll lose everything."" But (gasp!) the man is Garrett. He tells her not to worry and they start kissing.

Ezra's ex shows up at the faculty mixer Aria's parents are hosting. She says she works at the school where Ezra was just hired and Aria starts to panic.

Melissa sends Spencer a text that Ian didn't pick her up and she needs a ride. She leaves Toby and we learn that Toby is planning to tail Jenna that night at the same time as the meeting with Ian. They kiss.

Ezra finds Aria upstairs. He says she's not a part of his life anymore but Aria is upset that he didn't tell her the whole story: ""Until today you were the guy who would never lie to me.""

As tears stream down her face, Hanna deletes Caleb's contact info from her cell phone.

Cut to Caleb riding in a car with Lucas, who is clearly brining him to Hanna. When Caleb asks why he's doing this Lucas responds ""Because Hanna deserves to be happy.""

Mellissa tells Spencer she's sure something is wrong. She left her phone back at the church. As they contemplate going back to get it they get in an accident.

Veronica meets Spencer at the hospital. Spencer is fine and Melissa is stable, but the doctors are trying to see if anything is wrong with the baby.

While Hanna, Emily and Aria wait for Spencer, they get a text from A: ""Buckle up, Bitches. Nothing is as it seems."" A car pulls up.

Spencer and Veronica can't get in touch with Ian. Spencer leaves to get Melissa's phone in case. A cop gives Spencer her purse and she sees the texts from her friends. Spencer calls Aria and fills them in. They tell her to stay with Melissa.

The car pulls up and Emily says ""Thanks for coming."" Unfortunately we see that it's Garrett: ""Trust me,"" he says. ""I'm glad you called.""

After Garrett checks the area he asks if anyone knows they're there. Hanna says she left a note for her mother. Garrett points out there is only one way to reach their location and tells them ""If Ian shows, we'll see him coming.""

Spencer arrives at the church to look for the phone.

Hanna tells the other girls she lied about tell her mother anything. They notice that Garrett has a gun. A car pulls up and someone gets out with a bag. Garrett walks up from behind and points his gun at the man, telling him to put his hands in the air. But we see that it is not Ian.

Spencer searches the empty church for the phone. She gets up and Ian is right behind her: ""Lose something?""

The man, Logan Reed, tells Garrett he was paid to drop off the bag. Aria leaves Spencer a message that they are no their way to the hospital.

Ian calls the pre-paid phone and it rings in Spencer's purse. Ian says he has been waiting for her to leave the hospital. Ian says he's going to take care of the situation. Spencer pulls out the flash drive, throwing it in one direction as she runs in another. She climbs to the bell tower, calling Emily along the way. Ian catches her.

Emily picks up the phone and they hear her conversation with Ian. She mentions the church and Hanna calls 911. Ian's plan is to push her over the edge and make it look like a suicide. Just as she is about to go over the edge she grabs to his clothing. A shadowy figure arrives and Ian says ""What are you doing here?"" The person tosses Ian over the edge and the bell begins to ring.

The other girls arrive at the church and rush to the top of the tower. They find a shell-shocked Spencer and Ian, who has been hung by the bell rope. Spencer tells them someone else took care of Ian, but she didn't see who it was. She starts to cry and they hug her, saying ""it's over.""

When the police arrive they do not find Ian's body. The rest of the parents arrive on the scene. It's clear that the neighbors at the scene aren't sure what to think about these girls. At this moment they get yet another text from A: ""It's not over until I say it is. Sleep tight. While you still can, bitches."""

Francis tells his bodyguard Steve (no surname) to notify the neighbor and, while he is alone, strangles the injured dog to death to put it out of its misery. He returns home and dresses for a party.

New Year's Eve celebration in a hotel ballroom. Speaking to the viewer, Francis introduces newly elected President Garrett Walker (Michael Gill), Vice President-elect Jim Matthews (Dan Ziskie), Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), the presidential Chief of Staff; Francis identifies himself as House Majority Whip, with 22 years in Congress.

In the office of the White House chief-of-staff, Francis is told by Linda that the President-elect will NOT appoint him Secretary of State, as promised, and has chosen to keep Francis as Majority Whip. Instead, the president will nominate Senator Michael Kern (D-Colo.), (Kevin Kilner). Francis is offended and disappointed but outwardly accepts the President's decision.

At the offices of Clean Water Initiative, which Claire directs, Claire is telling her office manager, Evelyn Baxter (Maryann Plunkett), that CWI is expanding to an international dimension and will need 6 or 7 more employees.

At The Herald, Zoe offers chief political correspondent Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer) to be her researcher on the Hill. Jenine is despective and brushes Zoe off (""I don't have time to be anyone's training wheels"").

Francis returns home at night, to tell Claire that the Secretary of State job is not his. He is quietly furious. So is Claire, who had been counting on a big donation for CWI from the SanCorp corporation, a natural-gas provider, if Francis became the U.S. foreign secretary.

At dawn the following morning, they chat over coffee. She reaffirms her support for him. He is grateful and in an aside says ""I love that woman more than a shark loves blood.""

At Francis' office, his secretary Nancy Kaufberger (Elizabeth Norment) and chief of staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) watch the nomination of Michael Kern as secretary of state. Francis arrives and hints at the future, revealing his anger and frustration. (""We are no longer bound by allegiances. We serve no one. I hold [Walker and Vasquez] accountable."") ""Retribution?"" asks Stamper. ""No, no, it's more than that,"" Francis replies. ""Look at the bigger picture.""

Stamper realizes that Francis is going to go after his enemies' political careers. ""Kern first?"" he asks. ""That's how you devour a whale, Doug, one bite at a time,"" Francis answers. To torpedo Kern, Francis will ""need a buffer, someone we control completely.""

At a church service, the minister tells politicians in the audience to deal positively when faced with defeat. Leaving service, Felicity Holburn (Francie Swift) commiserates with Claire about Francis not getting the Secretary of State job. Felicity's husband, Senator Charles Holburn, (Karl Kenzler), tries to console Francis.

In Russo's bedroom, the Congressman has sex with his secretary, Christina. They've had an affair for six months.

Francis and Claire attend a concert at the D.C. Center for Performing Arts. Francis steps outside and is photographed by a paparazzo oggling a petite concert-goer in a tight white dress.

The woman turns out to be Zoe Barnes, who lives in a dingy walk-up in a less-than-affluent D.C. neighborhood. Upon returning from the concert, she sees the picture of Francis leering at her, sent to her over the Internet by the paparazzo. She Googles Francis' official Congressional website to learn more about him.

On Capitol Hill, Francis is visited by Linda, who brings him two tickets to the presidential ball and tells him that Donald Blythe (Reed Birney), is drafting a new law on education. Blythe is a liberal and Linda asks Francis to review the draft and make it more moderate (""We need a bill that we can pass."") All that within 100 days, she says. ""I can do that,"" Francis assures her.

Later that day, Doug gives Francis a list of possible legislators who could replace Kern as Secretary of State. Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) appeals to Francis and he asks Doug to set up a meeting.

At CWI, Claire tells office manager Evelyn that the SanCorp donation fell through and that Evelyn will have to make a list of employees who can be let go. Evelyn is shocked.

That night, Zoe shows up at Francis' house. She tells him that she needs access to Capitol Hill through him. (""I protect your identity; I print whatever you tell me and I'll never ask any questions. I promise absolute discretion."")

She guesses that education will be the first issue that the new administration will deal with. He does not confirm that guess but tells her that they will meet again.

On a Washington street, a police car stops Russo's car. He is accompanied by a woman other than Christina, an unnamed call girl (Rachel Brosnahan). The policeman arrests him on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.

Stamper learns of the arrest and notifies Francis by phone. Then Stamper approaches the D.C. police commissioner, Barney Hull (Chuck Cooper), and asks him to release Russo, no questions asked, no paperwork filed. Stamper offers Hull endorsement from Underwood and fund-raising for a run as Mayor of D.C. Russo is released.

Over breakfast, Claire aks Francis for two tickets for the Holburns to the presidential ball. She explains that she needs a donation from them for CWI now that the SanCorp donation fell through.

On Capitol Hill, Francis ostensibly shreds Blythe's education bill telling him that it's too liberal. He asks Blythe for a rewrite.

Meeting later with Catherine Durant, Francis hints that he will torpedo Michael Kern's nomination for Secretary of State if she's interested in the job. She appears to be receptive.

Francis summons Zoe to an art museum, where he gives her Blythe's draft bill. She takes it home, studies it and writes an in-depth article about it.

Francis invites Russo to his office and tells him that he rescued him from jail. For doing that, Francis asks Russo for his ""absolute, unquestioning loyalty."" ""Anything. Name it, Frank,"" Russo replies.

Zoe delivers to city editor Lucas her story about the Blythe bill and photocopies of the half-shredded bill. Executive editor Hammershmidt approves its publication and orders Janine to assist Zoe with further research. Janine, who is clearly Zoe's senior but now is in a subservient position, is insulted but complies.

President Walker is inaugurated. In his address, he stresses his education reform bill. At the inauguration ball, Francis dances with Cathy Durant.

The following morning, Francis goes to Freddy's Barbecue Joint for breakfast. He opens a copy of The Herald, which carries Zoe's story on Page One, blasting Blythe's educational bill as ""far left of center"" and tying a ""massive funding package to liberal mandates.""

Francis asks Freddy (Reg Cathey) for a second helping of ribs. ""I'm feeling hungry today!"" he says. (CHAPTER ENDS.)"

A kitchen faucet drips. Frank (Kevin Spacey) breaks it with a hammer blow, then stalks away angrily, obviously in a bad mood.

Later, at his office, Frank meets with Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali), a lobbyist for SanCorp, the natural-gas producers. Frank tells Remy that President Garrett Walker (Michael Gill) is considering multimillionaire Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney), a nuclear-energy proponent and the owner of many nuclear power plants, as his new Vice President.

""You and I cannot let that happen,"" Frank says. ""SanCorp does not want a pro-nuclear-energy man in the White House. SanCorp needs to initiate a hostile takeover"" of some of Tusk's subsidiaries, Frank proposes, companies that refine and ship the uranium Tusk's plants need. Remy sounds doubtful but promises to ""make some calls.""

In her office at CWI, Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) is talking to her lawyer, Oliver Spence (Michael Warner), who tells her that her former associate, Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt) is suing Claire, claiming that Claire fired her because she was pregnant. Claire denies the accusation. The lawyer recommends offering Gillian a settlement.

Slugline reporter Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer) tells fellow reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) that, to investigate the death of Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll) they need the arrest record from January, when he was detained for driving while intoxicated. ""We need to know who got him off,"" she says. ""If Underwood was involved, we're talking abuse of power and corruption."" Zoe counters that ""there are no files, no arrest records, nothing."" Zoe proposes enlisting Herald city editor Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) to do some research.

In bed that night, Zoe asks Lucas for help in her investigation but he is not receptive.

In the Oval Room the following morning, President Walker asks Frank about his visit in St. Louis with Raymond Tusk. Frank says he wasn't able to convince Tusk to accept Walker's offer of the Vice Presidency but suggests that Walker invite him to the White House and do it personally. Walker's chief of staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), sides with Frank. Walker agrees to a meeting that Friday.

Lucas arrives at Zoe's apartment looking agitated and secretive. Closes all windows, turns off all lights, takes Zoe into a hallway and says that a cover-up of Russo's arrest and release goes all the way up to the Police Commissioner. Through a contact in the Police Department, Lucas has obtained mugshots of Russo's companion at the time of the arrest, a prostitute named Rachel Posner (Rachel Bresnahan). He gives Zoe the pictures and a copy of the woman's previous arrest record. If Zoe investigates further, her life may be in danger, he says. She insists that she'll go on.

Remy phones Frank to say that Scott Cunningham (Armand Schultz), CEO of SanCorp, cannot immediately engage in a corporate takeover of Tusk. Frank asks for a meeting with Cunningham. Remy refuses the request. Frank decides to fly to Atlanta anyway and meet with Cunningham.

Janine, Zoe and Lucas go over Rachel Posner's record. Janine recommends going to Lynchburg, Va., the woman's hometown, to gather more information. Zoe notices that the woman's previous arrest record placed her at the District Grand Hotel.

In Atlanta, Scott Cunningham gets into Frank's car against his better judgment. Cunningham claims that Remy did not speak to him about Tusk and refuses to talk any further with Frank. Frank suspects double-dealing on Remy's part.

Doing research at the District Grand Hotel bar, Lucas notices a call girl (Kellyn Lindsay) picking up a hotel guest. He decides she might be a good source for information about Rachel Posner.

At home, Claire describes her nightmares to Frank. She talks of seeing ""the kids"" and seeing ""the girl"" being taken away from her by a clinging vine. Apparently, that's how she visualizes the three children she conceived but aborted.

Later at night, working out in the basement, Frank falls on his back when the rowing machine string breaks. Remy phones him and says he's on his way to Frank's home for a conversation. When Remy arrives, Frank berates him for not telling Cunningham that SanCorp should attack Tusk's holdings. Remy says that he'll deal with Cunningham ""my way.""

Claire's lawyer tells her that Gillian doesn't want a settlement and wishes to go to court.

In Lynchburg, Va., Zoe meets with one of Rachel's guidance counselors (Carlyncia Peck), who says that Rachel dropped out of school and ran away. The counselor intimates that Rachel was abused by her father.

In Frank's office, Linda tells Frank and Doug that Tusk and the President will meet the following day. Frank asks her to set a meeting between House Speaker Bob Birch (Larry Pine) and the President. She's puzzled but agrees.

Leaving the school, Zoe phones Janine to tell her she's ""got something for you."" The ""something"" is an off-the-record schedule for the President, which shows that Walker will meet with Birch on Thursday and Tusk on Friday. That apparently means that the President is going to offer the Vice Presidency to one of them. Janine publishes the item.

The press, alerted by Janine's blog, pounces on both Birch and Tusk. As coached by Frank, Linda tells the President that the leak was the result of a clerical mistake and that the clerk has been fired.

Frank goes into a church and berates God for not aiding his plans.

Claire confronts Gillian at the latter's home. Claire tries to mend fences but Gillian refuses.

Back at home, Claire tells Frank that everything they're doing will go for naught if they have no children to leave it to. Clearly, she has been affected by the fact that Gillian is expecting a child.

At the District Grand Hotel bar, Lucas shows the local call girl a picture of Rachel. The girl says Rachel quit ""the business"" and is serving tables at a restaurant in Georgetown.

Claire visits an ob-gyn, Dr. Larson (Theresa McCarthy), to inquire about the chances of having a baby after three abortions. Dr. Larson is doubtful.

At the office, Doug warns Frank that Tusk is making a play for SanCorp stock. To Frank, that means that Remy is now serving Tusk, not SanCorp, and has tipped Tusk of Frank's plan. Everything is now backfiring.

At the restaurant in Georgetown, Zoe steals an employee roster that contains Rachel's telephone number. She calls Rachel to make an appointment. The two meet that night at the entrance to a federal building. Zoe says that she knows that Rachel was with Russo when he was arrested for DUI.

Rachel walks away and into Stamper's car. Lucas sees the car drive away and takes down the license number.

Frank gets a call from his barbecued-ribs provider, Freddy (Reg Cathey). When he arrives at Freddy's, he finds Remy and Tusk inside. Remy confirms that he has defected to Tusk (""SanCorp is a big fish but Tusk is a whale."")

Inside Freddy's, Tusk tells Frank that he has bought 3 percent of SanCorp's stock and within the week he will own 10 percent. Tusk wants to stay in good commercial relations with China and needs Frank to help him in Congress. Frank refuses to be an ""indentured servant"" to Tusk; he wants an equal partnership.

In Zoe's apartment, Janine, Zoe and Lucas try to figure out what really happened to the late Peter Russo. Janine says that Frank wanted Russo to win the Governorship of Pennsylvania, but Zoe realizes that the opposite is probably true: ""Maybe he wanted Russo to self-destruct."" Her trust in Frank wavers.

Arriving in the Oval Office, Frank is greeted by Walker and Tusk. Walker confesses that he sent Frank to St. Louis so Tusk could vet him. Walker offers Frank the Vice Presidency. Frank accepts.

Frank returns home, tells driver Ed Meechum (Nathan Darrow) that he'll need him to continue to be his bodyguard. Meechum accepts. Inside, Claire congratulates her husband on the appointment.

In a cafeteria, Stamper asks Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly), Russo's former aide and mistress, if Zoe Barnes has harassed her. She says that Zoe knew something about the President's withdrawal of the nomination of Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) as Secretary of State (SEE CHAPTER ONE.) Doug seems concerned.

Claire and Frank leave the house at night for a jog through the neighborhood. Inside their home, Frank's telephone rings. It's a call from Doug. (END CHAPTER)"

Bob Pinciotti (Don Stark) is Donna's father & Midge (Tanya Roberts) is her mother. Red doesn't like any machine that is not American built. The family had to buy a Toyota, since the gas prices are going through the roof. Red was offered $400 trade in for the Vista, but Red decided to offer it to Eric instead. Eric manages to get beer, as Kitty asks him to put the warm beer in the fridge in the basement.

Red Forman (Kurtwood Smith) and his wife Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp) want to hand the keys to the Vista Cruiser to their son, Eric (Topher Grace), to use. Through persuasion from his friends, Eric uses the car to get out of town for a Todd Rundgren concert in Milwaukee with his closest friends: his neighbor, Donna (Laura Prepon), Hyde (Danny Masterson), and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Eric also decides to invite a new foreign exchange student from school, named Fez (Wilmer Valderrama). Kelso's girlfriend Jackie (Mila Kunis) invites herself along, and Eric is uncomfortable around Donna when Kelso inadvertently tells Eric that Donna likes him. The gang doesn't like Jackie, but is not able to say anything to her face.

Hyde and Eric want Kelso to dump Jackie, but every time he tries, she lures him with make-out sessions, and he can't. eventually the gang allows her to come as there is a gas shortage, prices are high and the Vista takes a lot of gasoline to run. Jackie is rich and offers to pay for the whole trip's worth of gasoline. The gang have one of their pot sessions. Red and Kitty finally hand over the car to Eric, but not before giving him a full top down on insurance costs, that is requires maintenance, and that it's not a bedroom on wheels. All the time, Eric is totally stoned. No beer cans and donuts are allowed in the car. And no trips out of town ever. Of course, all rules are broken on the very first day when Eric is goaded to take the car to the concert. Turns out this was a ruse to get the kids away so Red and Kitty could have sex.

However, on the way to the concert the car battery dies; the only way they can get a new one is if they give up two of their concert tickets to the mechanic. The rest of the group forces Kelso to give up his and Jackie's tickets as they don't like her. While the rest are at the concert, Jackie and Kelso make out in the car, and Jackie asks Kelso if he wants to break up with her and Kelso, who has been telling the others the entire episode he wants to break up with her, tells her he doesn't so they can continue to make out. At the end of the episode, Eric and Donna sit on the hood of the car and before she goes home, Donna kisses him."

Kitty is obvious, as Eric is not allowed to open the fridge or the kitchen drawers, Kitty wants Eric to wear a particular shirt on his birthday, he sees 7 bags of potato chips that Kitty claims were on sale and his sister Laurie is coming to town. Kitty also wants Eric to go to the grocery store and get a large bag of frosting and 15 bags of regular M&Ms. Donna is older to Eric by a month. Eric is uncomfortable since money is tough around the house and he doesn't want any fuss on account of his birthday. Eric wants a cassette player for the car as his present, not an 8-track.

Meanwhile, Eric's older sister, Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly), returns home from college for a weekend visit (and for the surprise party for Eric), and Kelso tries, unsuccessfully, to attract her attention even though he is in a relationship with Jackie. Laurie hates Hyde, as he won't pay any attention to her. Laurie is very sexually promiscuous and is somewhat of a tease. Eric makes a deal with Laurie to convince Kitty to call off the surprise party in exchange for the vista cruiser for an entire night. When Red finds out that Laurie wants to loan the Cruiser, he says that the Vista Cruiser is not dependable (it could break down and leave her at the mercy of any maniac who came along) and gives her his own brand-new Toyota and $30 for spending money.

Donna is also stressing over what she should get Eric for his birthday because she is unsure of the state of her relationship with Eric after she kissed him in the previous episode. She is not sure if she is still a friend or his girlfriend. She tells Jackie that she kissed Eric, and Jackie helps her choose a meaningful gift for him, a scented candle. Its practical and romantic. Eric dreams that Donna presents herself to him as his birthday present. He is then woken up in bed by Kitty for breakfast in bed.

Kitty still goes ahead with the surprise party. Red stops Eric from jumping ship. After the gifts are opened (he gets an 8 track tape player from Red & Kitty), Red takes Kitty and they go over to Donna's house with her parents Bob Pinciotti (Don Stark) and Midge (Tanya Roberts). Red wants to give the kids some privacy as they celebrate with Eric. Kitty is stressed about the fact that Eric is now almost a man. Kitty doesn't want to go as Eric is still her ""baby"" and she can't bear to see him grow up. Eric wants Laurie to help them get beer, but she refuses. Meanwhile Donna rehearses with Jackie how to give the candle to Eric, while the guys think Donna will have sex with Eric on his birthday. Eric meets Donna in the porch and opens his candle. They hold hands, when a drunk Kitty comes around crying that her baby is all grow up."

Money is tight around the house. Kitty serves Tuna casserole way too often. The other option is not pay car insurance and the family can have steak.

Jackie's father (Paul Kreppel), a city councilman, arranges for President Gerald Ford to stop at Point Place as part of his re-election campaign. Point Place is a whistle stop on his trail across Wisconsin. The principal of Point Place High School makes a speech warning against any ""maladjusted"" activity, which of course gives Hyde the idea to ""fight the power"". Red is angry at Ford as he allowed US jobs to be outsourced which is why he lost his own job. Kitty is pickled pink that Ford is coming to her house (which he is not). Eric is neutral about the whole thing and says that everyone is entitled to their own political opinion. Kitty bakes pies for the President.

The guys decide to streak naked when Ford comes to town for a campaign stop. Hyde wants to protest, Eric wants to look cool in front of Donna, and Kelso just wants to do something stupid and fun. Eric gives it some thought, but eventually decides to join Kelso and Hyde. Jackie's father holds a meeting of the organizing committee, which includes Bob, and says that they will hold a Q&A session with Ford. They decide to select the ""right"" people (the Average Joe, or in other words ""a loser"") to ask the questions. Meanwhile, Bob wants Red to ask Ford a question in the Q&A. Red first refuses as he is a democrat and hates Ford. Red agrees when he sees this as opportunity to embarrass Ford on National TV. However, Bob gives him a 'crappy' question (What has been your favorite Parade), leading Red to decide to ask what he wants anyway. Red says that a man can not stand idly by while everything is taken away from him, his job, his stability, his right to free speech. Eric borrows Red's trench coat.

Donna refuses to wear an American flag jumpsuit her father, Bob, gives her as it will embarrass her. But Kitty advises Donna that all family are embarrassing, or they are dead. So, she wears the flag jumpsuit and joins her parents. On the day though, everyone decides not to streak, as there are too many guard dogs and the Secret Service. The guys take a vote and decide unanimously to sit down peacefully. Donna is disappointed as she was looking forward to seeing Eric naked.

Ford falls to the floor 3 times before he can come to the podium to greet the audience. However, when Red gets up to ask his question, he stutters and starts to bomb. Even the dogs are looking at Red and judging him. In desperation, Eric puts on a Nixon mask and streaks across the auditorium, motivating Red to ask, ""How the hell could you pardon Nixon?"". Red later acknowledges Eric's role in bailing him out at the Ford reception."

Donna's mom Midge overhears Jackie's conversation and agrees with Jackie. She says women have to act weak and fragile (so men can feel superior) and that's the way they control men. Midge says that Donna can stick to her principles and then 40 years from now she will be telling her cats how she won a basketball game.

Donna beats Eric again (this time at air-hockey where Donna has claimed that she was a novice) and soon he starts to avoid playing with her. So, Donna tries to throw a game intentionally and Eric figures it out and is not amused by the pity. Kitty encourages Eric not to keep scores with Donna and to just enjoy her company, while he can.

Jackie wants Kelso at her beck and call and humiliates him specifically when he is spending time with Hyde and Fez. Kelso tries to stand-up to Jackie, but totally caves in front of her. Jackie makes it known to Hyde and Fez that she won in the battle for Kelso. When Hyde tries to confront him, he says ""at least he is getting some"". Next time when Jackie calls, Kelso tries to get Fez to listen to her, and Fez would tell him what to say while he played cards with Hyde. Only Jackie finds out when Fez gets excited when Jackie describes of her and Kelso's sex sessions to him.

Red's job hours at the auto plant are cut back and he is forced to stay home, keeping himself occupied by ""fixing"" things, much to Kitty's dismay. These are all the things that Kitty needs and uses and loves. Red only makes them worse and Kitty is afraid to point it out to him. He fixes the dryer in the basement and then the dining table in the kitchen (it wobbled slightly). But after Red fixes it, it is now slanted, but Kitty is afraid to point it out to Red. But Red finds out and by the time he is done with it, the table has no legs. Kitty breaks the garage door when Red tries to fix Kitty's refrigerator. This was Kitty's way to keep Red away from the house and fix things in his garage, where he can do minimum damage.

Eric and Donna decide to reconcile. But they play ball again and this time Donna wrestles Eric to the ground and grinds him into the dust. They end up in a position where Eric is on top of Donna and it becomes awkward for both. Red then sees Eric lose to Donna again at a basketball game and shifts his focus to training him.

They decide to throw a party at a pool at a vacant home that Jackie's mother is attempting to sell. Kelso does quick math to figure out that they will make $224 if they sell $2 per entry. The pool is empty, and the party is at the bottom of the pool.

Meanwhile, Kitty invites Bob and Midge over, and while talking, Red works out that the gang are throwing a party (Eric took a bucket and 2 bags of ice and Donna took all the cups.

However, at the pool, they soon discover they need a tap to extract the beer. Eric sends Kelso out with his gas money to purchase one at the liquor store. Eric says he is happy to give up his gas money because by the end of the night they will make over $200 from the party. Kelso manages to buy the tap as the store clerk doesn't need any ID to sell a tap, as one can drink beer with a tap alone and Kelso wasn't buying any actual beer. However, after leaving the store, Kelso has the tap broken in half by two bullies from school (who broke Eric's pencil in 2 earlier in the day).

Eric doesn't tell Red about the bad news and lets his parents enjoy their celebratory night together (They are going for a dinner and a movie together). Laurie tells Eric that she has flunked out of college and had just made out with Kelso."

While making the fix, Michael takes a fall and badly hurts his arm.

The gang comes back home late at night and Eric seeks medical advice from his nurse mother (for Kelso's injury). Eric gets traumatized by accidentally walking in on his parents making love. Eventually, the gang takes Kelso to the hospital for treatment.

The unsavory idea even gets Laurie's sympathy, yet he rather lets them thinks he's on drugs. Laurie tries to reason that Red and Kitty are in love and have urges and needs, but Eric is not willing to consider that at all. Eric is acting weird in front of them, acting weird at the dinner table, can't look them straight in the eye, can't sleep for the entire night due to recurring nightmares. Kitty brings out the diagnostic chart for signs of drug use and Eric scores 9 out of 10. Blood shot eyes, mood swings, irregular appetite, odd sleeping patterns, and so on. Kitty is distraught. Red says Eric is just weird. But then Eric walks in looking all over the place and can't look his parents in the eyes. Red also believes that Eric is on drugs.

Jackie semi-nurses Kelso and makes him realize Hyde is no real friend, to little avail. Jackie says it was Hyde's idea to paint the pot leaf and then it was Hyde who made Kelso fix the mistake. But Kelso is clear that Hyde is his best friend. Kelso finally confronts Hyde by blaming him for his fall. Hyde refuses to apologize to Kelso, since neither did, he push Kelso or made the railing slippery to cause his fall. Kelso says that Hyde doesn't respect him and instead laughs at him. Hyde turns the tables by narrating how Hyde was bit in Kelso's back yard by his dog and Kelso did nothing but laugh. Kelso and Hyde forgive each other and are back to being friends again.

Donna goes on a date with Eric, but he is so traumatized that he won't even make-out with her. He tells Donna the truth. Donna says she saw her parents having sex when she was 12. She says that eventually the pain will pass, and he will be able to live again. But then Donna relives her horror with her parents and now won't let Eric touch her. They drive back home.

Red and Kitty talk to Eric about his drug problems. Eric finds it easier to accept the drug problem than to admit that he saw them having sex. Laurie tells Red and Kitty the truth. Red won't touch Kitty when she reminds him that he walked on his parents having sex that one time.

Fez gets on the water tower to fix the graffiti and falls but is alright. The mural still looks like it is giving the middle finger."

Chrissy is driving through town and staying in a motel. Chrissy drives a Vespa and calls love an outdated concept made by industrialists to keep girls subservient. Hyde loves Chrissy as she is dark, obnoxious, dangerous and paranoid. She is his perfect girl as she is easy too. Chrissy believes that the establishment doesn't want the people to feel good. So, every time they have sex is like a huge protest against the establishment. She tells him she wants to go to New York to start a punk band and when she asks him to go with her, Hyde must make a tough decision. Eric disapproves of him leaving Point Place.

Kitty tries to help Jackie in making a pie on a home economics assignment. Red and Kelso want to make smaller paddles for Pong to make Red's Atari Pong more challenging. It is awkward every time Jackie and Kelso run into each other as they are still broken up. Jackie keeps burning up pies as her mind is totally on Kelso. So, instead of watching the oven, she talks on the phone about her troubles and the pies keep burning. Kitty encourages her to take the money and buy a pie.

Meanwhile Red and Kelso bond over fixing the Atari pong machine. Red also feels that the Atari Pong game can up the challenge quotient and by then Kelso had already opened the machine. But Red warns that if Kelso can't put the machine back together, he will owe Red $118 or else Red will have to kill him. Kelso is an electronics wizard and Red knows nothing. Eventually, it works. Kelso thinks computers is the future, Red thinks its soldering.

Eric obviously fumbles with Donna's bra every time they are together. Donna is even able to anticipate Eric's moves as every time he goes for the bra, his lips stop moving. Donna feels neglected as Eric focuses all his attention on her breasts. Eric discusses his problem with Hyde, who tells him to buy a bra, practice on it at home and then gift it to Donna. At the next date, Donna is not wearing a bra to make it easier for Eric.

When Red finds out Hyde is thinking about moving to NYC, he and Kitty decide to talk to him as they know his mother drinks and doesn't care about him. They believe NYC is no place for a 17-year-old teenager. The Formans argue that Hyde needs a high school diploma and without it he is likely to end up as lower than nothing. Hyde simply walks away and Red blames Kitty for running the talk. Hyde is still determined to leave as this might be his only chance to escape Point Place. But after talking to Eric, Hyde realizes that his life and his friends are in Point Place. Hyde backs out to Chrissy.

Fez feels left out of everything. Hyde has run away with Chrissy and Donna & Eric want to do things alone.. which leaves Fez alone. He makes a big speech that every day he comes to the basement looking for friendship and acceptance, and he only gets rejection and abandonment."

Kitty had packed the leftovers for Bernice and Bernice insults Kitty by saying the next time she wants to eat out. After Eric tells her it wouldn't kill her to be nice day for one day, his paternal grandmother Bernice (Marion Ross), who always bags on Kitty, drops dead on his shoulder. Eric feels he killed her by his blunt retort and doesn't dare tell Red, even though Donna thinks he should.

The Vista Cruiser is parked in the driveway with Bernice in it. Eventually, Eric has no option but to deliver the news to Kitty. Kitty changes her attitude the minute she hears that Bernice is dead. Kitty refuses to consider that she ever said anything nasty about Bernice.

Meanwhile, Red's very emotional brother Marty (Pat Skipper) has arrived and is a millstone around Red's neck. Red is embarrassed by his emotional brother Marty. Laurie doesn't mourn but sees the advantages of her grandma's death. She had a paper coming up in the week which she was going to flunk and now has the perfect excuse.

Donna tries to convince Eric that he did not kill Bernice, but Eric knows that the shock of hearing her grandson tell her that she is nasty killed Bernice. Eric is depressed and Donna encourages him to talk to Red about how he feels. Eric says that talking is not going to help him. Only drinking can. Hyde takes him drinking instead. Eric and the guys go to a bar pretending to be soldiers, get hit on by some girls (Charlotte and Charlene) and end up in a fight. The boyfriends of the 2 girls arrive and pick a fight with the gang. They knock Eric out cold, prompting Hyde and Kelso to attack them. Fez stands by and continues his conversation with the girls. Eric comes home at 2 am and Marty encourages him to let out his feelings, while Red orders him to bottle it up again. Red sends Kitty and Marty to sleep and has a beer with Eric. Kitty hides her mixed feelings by cooking.

At the funeral, Jackie and Kelso have sex (Jackie thinks Humans are fragile beings). Kelso makes awkward comments, Fez consoles Red and is re-directed to Marty. At the open casket, Kitty asks Bernice to be nicer to God. Jackie is perplexed that people get old and die. Hyde eyes the ring on Bernice's finger. Fez is horrified to find a body in the casket. Red cant say anything.

Red finds a train set in Bernice's things and fights Marty for it (even though it belonged to Marty). Marty wants Red to admit that he wants the trains, but Red is only willing to show that by keeping the trains that he is doing a favor to Marty. Marty leaves the train set for Red as he loves playing with it. Eric admits to Red his last words to his Grandmom and Red laughs it off saying ""It could only happen to you son"". Kitty finally mourns for Bernice when she runs out of eggs and flour.

Jackie catches a cold from the reservoir and ends up in bed. Kelso is horrified at her ill appearance and turns away from her. But later Kelso apologizes to Jackie saying that this illness is temporary and soon she will be hot and pretty, just like her mom (which also gives him hope for the future). Kelso is convinced that Jackie's physical beauty will last forever.

Midge's Feminist Warriors - which no other husband puts up with - decide to meet at Midge's place every week. The group keeps making Midge crazy with their anti-male talk. Midge points out the female suppression in the English language with words like mail-man. Midge calls Bob a part of the problem. Yet member Sharon actually proves an old-fashioned caring housewife at heart when she finds good provider Bob feeling neglected. Sharon says that a hard-working man who provides for his family, deserves to come home to a hot meal, and not eat a cold sandwich by himself. Bob starts developing feelings for Sharon and animosity towards Midge, which Donna picks up on. Donna sees that Bob is all dressed up in his finest suits whenever Sharon is supposed to visit the house.

Red feels that with the car plant about to close, money is too tight even to afford pork chops. Yet Kitty and Eric implicitly expect him to play ""Santa Claus"" for home-wrecked Hyde after his mother abandons him. It starts with Eric asking Red if Hyde can stay over for the night. Red agrees but asks Eric to split his pork chop with Hyde. Eric finds out that Hyde had to pawn his color TV for cash. And he overhears Hyde talking to Edna over the phone and finding that Edna is not planning to come back. Donna joins the pot circle for the first time. Hyde is not there, and Eric tells the gang that Edna is not coming back. Donna gets high and decides to count all the molecules in her body.

When food and supplies grow low for Hyde at Edna's rented house, Eric persuades his parents to take Hyde in. Red is not in favor of having another mouth to feed in the house, But Kitty asks Red to at least pay a visit to Hyde. Kitty and Red visit Hyde. The house is a mess, with garbage everywhere and no furniture to speak of. Kitty tells Red that she cannot allow Hyde to live like this. Red is reluctant as he doesn't have the money. Kitty starts to cry and Red cannot stand it anymore. He orders Hyde to get his stuff in the car. Hyde is angry at Eric since now Red yells at him all the time and back home, Hyde didn't have to answer to anybody. But deep down, Hyde is thankful to have a roof over his head and Kitty fawning over him with hot cocoa and cookies."

He is no longer 'admired' by the other boys as the perfect bad example. Hyde works hard and takes pride in what he does. Kelso and Fez lose all respect for him.

Donna and Eric no longer have a place to make out since Hyde has to do his homework. Kitty was disappointed in Hyde when he is failing his class, and Hyde promises to try harder.

Eric's initial happiness with the brother he never had soon turns in frustration as Hyde constantly gets high praise and is even set as an example for Eric, while Eric is now kid no. 3. Since Hyde does all the work around the house, Red only pays him and Eric gets nothing. Hyde scores a C- on his history paper and is applauded. Eric gets a B and is scolded for not getting an A. Eric is asked to be more like Hyde. When Eric confronts Hyde, Hyde calls him a lazy, spoiled brat. Eric says that he has been doing the chores for 16 years and Hyde is making him look bad.

Eric listens to one of Kelso's worst-advised ideas... He sets about coercing Hyde to do destructive things. Instead, Eric ends up bouncing a bowling ball off the couch and breaks the TV, despite Hyde begging him not to do so as nothing good can come off it. Kelso and Fez run away pronto. Hyde tries to cover for Eric, but Red punishes them both by asking them to get a job and buy him a new TV. Red wants a brand new model with a remote and a 26 inch screen.

Fights between Midge and Bob get worse. Midge wants Bob to do the dishes, but Bob says that the feminist philosophy has gone to her head. Bob warns Eric that Donna is likely to turn out the same way. Jackie advice Donna that she can play off Bob and Midge for her affections and come out ahead. She can have twice as much stuff, twice as many clothes and her parents will fight over who gets to buy her a car. Donna is worried that her parents might end up being divorced.

Red's fellow Korea veteran Bull (Mitch Pileggi) is in Point Place, showing off to him and Bob as a success in business selling hot tubs with a young, attractive wife. Bull even offers Red a job since he is opening up a Hot Tub store in Point Place. Red, jealous of Bull's success, reconsiders his life choices, but changes his mind after Bull and his wife (Arlene Pileggi) invite Red and Kitty to a swingers party.

Graham suspects that Garrett Jacob Hobbs, dubbed the ""Minnesota Shrike"", killed eight girls, but not the one impaled on the deer's head; that, he maintains, was a victim of a copycat, who called Hobbs to warn him. Crawford harbors suspicions that Abigail was somehow complicit in her father's killing spree, despite objections from Dr. Bloom, Lecter and Graham. Lounds meets the brother of the impaled girl and reveals to him that Abigail Hobbs is out of the hospital. Lecter and Graham take Abigail to her home, where she and her neighbor Marissa are confronted by the brother of the impaled girl, Nicholas Boyle. The following day, Abigail is taken to the cabin where Marissa is found impaled on a deer's head. In her house, Abigail finds the hair of one of the murdered girls inside a pillow and inadvertently kills Boyle in a way that, according to Lecter, cannot be seen as self-defense. Lecter helps her cover-up the murder, after which Abigail admits to Lecter she knows he had made the call to her father. Lecter suggests that Abigail keep his secret in exchange for his hiding her murder."

With the house complete, Charles goes into town in search of obtaining seed and a plow. On his way to town, Charles stops to give aid to Doc Baker, whose carriage has a broken wheel. While getting a ride into town in the repaired carriage, Doc Baker explains word has gotten around town about Charles and his family, and explains the Ingalls will be a welcome addition to the town of Walnut Grove.

Without the means to pay, and unable to get credit at Olson's Mercantile, Charles seeks seed and a plow at the neighboring Feed and Seed. In exchange for free seed and a plow, Charles agrees to replace the roof of the Feed and Seed's warehouse, which had collapsed under the previous winter's snow, in addition to stacking dozens of sacks of grain once the roof work is completed. Concerned over Charles' ability to get the job done while splitting his time between the Feed and Seed and Hanson's Mill, Mr. O'Neill, the owner of the Feed and Seed, requires Charles to sign a chattel mortgage on his team of oxen. The oxen will revert to O'Neill if the work isn't completed within three weeks.

Working six hours at the Feed and Seed and six hours at the Mill each day has left Charles tired and in a foul mood, and without any time to spend with his family. To make it up to them, he agrees to take the family on an afternoon picnic. However, while attempting to get a stuck kite out of a tree, Charles falls from a great height and breaks several ribs. He's tended to back at the Ingalls farm and confined to his bed for two weeks.

With Charles unable to finish his work at the Feed and Seed, and with only a few hours left on the chattel mortgage deadline,, O'Neill pays a visit to the Ingalls farm and relieves Ma of the oxen despite her pleas for compassion. Charles, upon hearing of this, leaves his bed early and heads to town, determined to finish his work. Unbeknownst to Charles, Mary and Laura follow along behind him. Charles begins stacking the grain, but collapses soon thereafter due to his injuries. Mary and Laura attempt to step in for their father, but the task is simply too much for girls of their size.

Seeing the girls efforts, the men of the town stop what they're doing, make their way to the Feed and Seed, and pitch in to get the job done. Charles realizes that while he's new to Walnut Grove, he's already made some dear friends, and collects his oxen and heads back home with his girls."

Also, the girls buy their school tools, like boards and pens at Mr Oleson's (Richard Bull), who is a kind man. Caroline buys an expensive fabric to make herself a dress, which she can barely afford. When at home, she's sad she could not follow the advice she gave to her own daughter.

Time goes by. All parents visit the school to hear their children reading some compositions. Caroline uses the expensive fabric to make the girls new dresses.

Caroline Ingalls (Karen Grassle) decides to do her bit: she convinces all the farmer wives to pick up the loose shafts of corn and wheat which have survived the hailstorm.

When Laura tells that the mention of death in the song ""Go Tell Aunt Rhody"" makes her sad, Maddie explains that death should maybe be seen as a new beginning, and not an end.

It turns out Maddie is visiting, as a diversion to give Charles Ingalls some time to help Maddie's housemate Amy Hearn decorate the place for her surprise 80th Birthday Party. As they talk, Doc Baker stops by to deliver some mail for Maddie.

It turns out the letter is from Maddie's daughter Eliza, and upon reading it later, she grows sad that her daughter and family can't attend her party. Amy tries to cheer her friend up, but as she discusses her own children, she looks over and realizes Maddie has died.

A funeral follows shortly thereafter, attended by a number of the townsfolk, and Maddie's family who have come. Amy stands next to the Ingalls girls, and mentions how while people may miss birthdays, they almost always show up at a funeral to say goodbyes. Laura feels this is a backwards way of doing things, and feels funerals should happen while one is alive, so goodbyes can be said in person.

The Ingalls girls visit her over the next few days to give her some company, but shortly after Laura visits, she rushes into town to tell Charles that Amy is sick. Charles and Doc Baker rush to her residence, but Baker can't find anything wrong with her.

It is then that Amy asks the two men to promise to help her. She requests Charles be the one to make funeral and wake arrangements for her, and Doc Baker to contact her family to attend. Once they promise, Amy suddenly jumps out of bed, and the two realize they have been deceived! Amy tells that she wants a funeral and wake held on her birthday, and is doing this because she wants to see her own family (whom she hasn't seen in a number of years) before she really does go.

Charles shares the news with his family, but Caroline naturally finds the whole plan to be ridiculous. She goes to Amy's place to talk some sense into her, and returns having been talked into making a cake for the wake!

As part of the plan, Amy is snuck over to the Ingalls to stay, while her house is set up for the wake.

Things almost go awry when Father Gorman from Mankato shows up early to the Ingalls' place, but given he has no idea what Amy looks like, she claims to be a family friend of the deceased.

On the day of the birthday/wake, Amy dresses in black with a veil to disguise her presence. Naturally, she is overjoyed to see her daughter Bridget and her family show up, along with her son Sean.

As the wake goes on, she sneaks over near her children, listening in to their conversations, but grows surprised when her son Andy (whom she hadn't seen since he was a teenager) shows up!

Amy can't take it any longer, and finally reveals herself. Naturally, her children are shocked and upset, but she tells how desperate she was to see her family, and how she may not have many years left.

The family hugs and Charles pulls out his fiddle, turning the somber occasion into a party."

She wants permission to speak with a prisoner she thinks has important intel. He's about to be executed and Carrie thinks is the perfect time to get information about the man he worked for, Abu Nazir. Estes says no, but she goes in anyway.

Carrie tells the prisoner she will take care of his family if he gives her the information. He whispers something into her ear as she is dragged away by guards.

TEN MONTHS LATER

Carrie returns home to her apartment early one morning. She has clearly been closely tracking this Abu Nazir for some time. She washes herself up, takes a blue pill of some sort and removes a wedding ring.

Carrie is late to Estes' briefing. He tells them about a Delta Force operation that resulted in the rescue of an American POW, Marine Corps Sniper/Scout Sergeant Nicholas Brody, who had been in captivity since 2003 and presumed dead. Brody said his sniper partner Corporal Thomas Wilson was killed in captivity. The room applauds but Carrie leaves with a concerned look on her face.

Carrie meets with Saul Bernson, who seems to be her boss and a mentor within the agency. She says tells him the prisoner she spoke with ten months ago said Abu Nazir had ""turned an American POW."" She didn't think much of it at the time because she wasn't aware there were any prisoners alive in Iraq or Afghanistan. Saul wonders why Brody wasn't just dropped off at a checkpoint. Carrie thinks Abu Nazir is playing the ""long game."" She's been in the ""penalty box"" and doesn't have as much access as she used to. He tells her to find a way to get him more intelligence.

Brody gets cleaned up and tells somebody he wants to speak with his family before his debrief.

Cut to a woman having sex with a guy with whom she seems to have an intimate relationship. The phone rings: ""Jessica? It's me. Brody."" A panicked Jessica stands up and tells the guy she has to leave.

Jessica returns home. She gathers son Chris and daughter Dana (who is clearly having some alienated teen issues) to tell them what has happened.

The family prepares for the reunion. Chris admits to Dana that he has no memory of his father. As soon as they leave the home two men in phone repair uniforms break into the home and begin setting up surveillance in every room. Carrie comes in to meet them -- Virgil and his brother Max - and gives them instructions to put video and audio surveillance devices in every room in Brody's home.

Brody is struggling on the flight to the ceremony, vomiting in the plane bathroom. It seems like Estes may end up getting the job of CIA director because of Brody's rescue.

Brody sees his family for the first time in eight years. It is awkward at first, but they embrace each other. The Vice President arrives and thanks Brody.

With Carrie watching closely on TV, Brody addresses the crowd. He gives a flawless performance.

Max finds one of Carrie's pills that she's been hiding in an aspirin bottle. Virgil isn't sure what it is.

On the way to the car the family is greeted by the man we saw in bed with Jessica earlier. His name is Mike and he's a Marine who is clearly close buddies with Brody.

The family returns home. There are hundreds of fans and members of the press waiting. They pose in front of a yellow ribbon tried around a tree in the yard.

Carrie convinces Saul to get her into Brody's next debrief. He makes her promise not to raise any eyebrows.

Carrie carefully watches the monitors. That night the phone rings but nobody is there. The reunited couple starts to be romantic and Jessica notices the scars all over Brody's torso. She cries. The couple has emotionless sex and Jessica weeps afterwards.

The debrief begins without incident. But when Carrie is allowed to question Brody she seems skeptical when he says Abu Nazir wasn't present during any of his interrogations. She doesn't believe him. We are shown Brody's flashbacks and he did meet with Abu Nazir during his captivity. The questioning gets borderline awkward.

Jessica and the kids are preparing for a welcome back party that night. Brody says he's still at the debrief, but we can see that he's in a car.

Virgil calls Carrie to tell him that Brody just lied to Jessica on the phone.

Estes tells Saul about Carrie making a scene at the debrief. Estes tells him the last time she was like this was when she got into the Iraqi prison and ""nearly caused an international incident.""

With Carrie and the surveillance guys in a van nearby, Brody meets with a woman. It turns out to be the wife of his USMC sniper/scout partner Thomas. She was the one who called and hung up because Jessica is upset with her for getting re-married. She asks how Mike died. Brody says he was beaten to death, but tells her he wasn't there when it happened. Based on a flashback it looks like he is lying again. Virgil asks Carrie about the pill they found. It turns out to be an antipsychotic and he is concerned. She says she has a mood disorder she's been dealing with she was 22 and nobody knows about it.

Carrie comes home to find Saul has found her surveillance setup. He tells her to get a lawyer because she's going to need to report her actions. She makes a halfhearted pass at Saul which is not well-received.

Carrie takes one of her pills and seems to be having a rough patch. She changes clothes, puts on her wedding ring and goes out.

At the barbecue Mike talks to Jessica. He mentions that they were close to moving in together and telling her kids about their relationship. He wants to know what happens next and she simply says ""He's my husband, Mike.""

Outside Brody notices Jessica and Mike together. He asks Chris about Mike helping out his mom while he was gone.

Carrie is at a bar where there's a jazz combo playing, with a guy she's clearly just met. She tells him she wears the wedding ring to weed out men looking for a relationship. Just before they leave together Carrie notices the fingers of the horn and bass players in the band. It reminds her of something Brody was doing.

Carrie excitedly visits Saul and shows him footage that during every public appearance Brody has been tapping his fingers in a pattern almost like a musical phrase. She thinks it's a signal to someone in the viewing audience. Saul is skeptical at first but eventually agrees she might be onto something. If it's a code of some kind, Saul thinks they should get the crypto guys on it. This seems to have bought Carrie some time.

Jessica wakes up to find Brody is gone. We see him out for a jog. While he jogs we look into his memory and see that he was the one who killed Thomas using his fists, and he did it with Abu Nazir looking on.

Brody stops running in front of the Capital building and stares at the dome."

Walker's body is brought out and dropped in the hole. Brody is placed on the edge of the hole and begins singing ""The Marine Hymn"" as a gun it put to his head. The trigger is pulled and Brody wakes up in bed. Carrie wakes up as well, watching as Brody begins to weep in bed.

In the morning Jessica makes reference to the fact it ""happened again."" At 4:00 am Brody woke up and began speaking in Arabic while clutching Jessica's arm. She is badly bruised. Jessica and the kids leave and it appears this is the first day that Brody has been left home alone.

After his family leaves Brody begins to recall his time alone in a cell. He walks outside briefly but comes right back inside as dozens of reporters hurl questions at him. Brody ends up in a corner of his bedroom, clutching the walls.

The crypto-guy tells Saul he's hasn't yet found any patterns with respect to the apparent finger tapping signals. Saul is meeting with Judge Turner (Michael Mckean) he clearly has dirt on. The judge gives him a four-week Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant and isn't happy about it.

Saul brings Carrie the warrant. He makes reference to her lying about him and coming on to him. She shows him that Brody hasn't moved in five hours. Saul doesn't think this is strange, arguing that if Brody was working for other side he's go right to the press and begin playing the hero role.

We see an attractive woman named Lynne Reed (Brianna Brown) interviewing a girl (Melissa Benoist) to be part of a Prince Farid's harem. She makes a call about getting a wax and Farid's No. 2 doesn't seem to trust her, even grabbing the phone to make sure. We see that Reed's call is placed to a CIA operator, who pretends to take the appointment then immediately calls Carrie.

Carrie watches Jessica come home at night. Brody, who has been sitting against the wall all day, gives her a smile and says his day was ""great.""

Estes and another higher-up are waiting for Mike when he returns to his office. They tell him they'd like him to lean on Brody to reenlist. They are offering Brody a promotion and significant financial compensation. They tell him to emphasize how this could help Brody's family.

The next morning Chris asks Brody what it feels like to kill someone. Brody doesn't answer, but notices a reporter in their backyard taking pictures. Brody goes out to confront the man and when he insists of pressing for an interview, punches him in the throat with Chris watching. Brody walks out the backyards and disappears.

Carrie realizes what is happening and sends Max to follow.

Jessica comes downstairs and Chris tells her what happened.

Max follows Brody into a mall. Virgil comes to Carrie's to stand in as watcher of the video feeds.

Carrie meets with Reed. She shows her video from five days earlier when Farid met face-to-face with Abu Nazir. Carrie could not be more excited and Reed is terrified. She wants to end her work for the CIA but Carrie convinces her she'll be safe.

Carrie calls Saul with news of a getting a visual confirmation of Abu Nazir. Saul says ""I'll assemble the group.""

Mike drops by the Brody household in uniform. Jessica thinks he must have heard about Brody disappearing. Jessica fills him in about everything, including the flashbacks and bruises. Virgil notices the two were probably having an affair.

Saul tells Carrie he can't yet authorize more surveillance of Brody. He reminds her that Estes's career is tied to Brody.

Carrie calls Max, who has lost contact with Brody.

Estes congratulates Carrie on the news and says he wants Reed to stick close to Farid. But he has no intention of providing increased protection for Reed.

Max finds Brody in a hardware store. He's looking at things like lumber, wiring and screws.

Mike stays over for dinner. Chris asks awkward questions about Mike outranking his father. Brody comes home with a bag and heads for the garage. Carrie is furious to learn Virgil couldn't get a camera in the garage. They are able to listen to Brody tell Jessica he was out walking all day. She reminds him how rough things were when he was gone. She's upset that Chris saw him hit the reporter. After dinner Mike tells Brody about coming back to the service. Brody tells him he'd be able to provide for Jessica and the kids. Brody completely blows him off.

Upstairs Brody takes Chris aside and apologies for him having to see him hit the reporter.

Jessica tries to talk to Brody about talking to the media as he watches TV. He ignores her.

As Farid (Amir Arison) is preparing to arrive for his visit Virgil clumsily spills tea on Reed's shirt. She goes to the bathroom to clean up and finds Carrie waiting for her. She has a device for her to install on Farid's Blackberry to copy the memory. Carrie again assures her she'll be protected.

Carrie goes to visit her sister Maggie and two nieces. Maggie is a doctor and she's been providing Carrie her anti-psychotic medications from her sample drawer. Their father lives with Maggie and he has a condition similar to Carrie's.

Brody wakes up in the night and flashes back again to his captivity, walking through a corridor. With Carrie watching live he goes to the garage and starts tinkering with the garage door. He sweeps up the floor and flashes back to coming upon some Muslim men as they prayed. He washes his hands. Brody takes out a mat, lays it on the floor and begins performing the Salah.

Brody tells Jessica that he fixed the door. We see him put on his uniform and walk out the front door. He walks over to the media and begins to hold an impromptu press conference.

Carrie calls Saul and tells him that Brody is doing exactly what he said earlier, ""playing the hero card."""

Afterwards he leaves the room briefly to speak with his top aid. Reed is able to copy the contents of his phone just before he returns to give her an enormous diamond necklace.

The TV network is preparing for a huge network interview with Nicholas and his family in two days. Virgil and Carrie watch in horror as the TV crew very nearly move a couch and expose one of their surveillance microphones.

Dana is sharing a joint with her friends and tells them she's not interested in doing the interview. They think she should do something crazy.

Estes briefs a team about Reed getting video of Farid and Abu Nazir having a face-to-face. Carrie mentions Reed has copied Farid's cell' 'phone data and the plan is to start following the money from there.

Carrie isn't thrilled after her briefing that Saul asked a few probing questions about the likelihood of Farid being involved in terrorism. He brushes her off.

Dana missed the interview prep and Jessica yells at her about it. Jessica tells her husband about Dana's recent attitude issues. Nicholas goes to speak with his daughter and during their conversation Jessica is stunned to hear Dana laughing behind her closed bedroom door.

Carrie meets with Reed at a hotel swimming pool to get the chip. Reed expresses doubt about Farid being involved in anything evil.

In the kitchen the following morning Jessica asks Nicholas about his conversation with Dana. He says they were watching a funny video. To Jessica's surprise Dana has some of the breakfast which her father has prepared.

So far the CIA tech guy hasn't found anything suspicious on Farid's phone. He still hasn't gotten to some of the encrypted stuff.

Carrie confronts Saul about him still being pissed at her. He says she destroyed their trust by lying to him and treating him like everybody else.

We see some of the solo portion of Nicholas' interview. He's asked about the beatings and torture. When he's asked why he was beaten, we see Nicholas flash back to being given food by Abu Nazir after a round of torture. Nicholas obviously doesn't mention this.

Dana crudely tells Jessica that she knows her mother has a sexual relationship with Mike which she instinctively denies, then tells her that she thought Nicholas was dead all this time. Dana says that it seems everybody knows the secret except Nicholas. Jessica pleads with her daughter to promise not to say anything to her father.

Virgil shows Carrie footage of Jessica quietly telling Mike that Dana knows about them being together.

During a night out at the club for Farid's harem, one of the new girls being auditioned asks Reed about her necklace.

Carrie watches Nicholas act distant with Jessica before bed he's curled up on the bedroom floor with just a pillow.

Farid's top aid tells Reed that Farid wants her to ""entertain"" a business man that night. Reed seems surprised by the request, and he tells her only that Farid can be ""excruciatingly indirect."" Reed says she has to freshen up before leaving.

Carrie witnesses a particularly disturbing sexual encounter between Nicholas and Jessica. Nicholas tells his wife to remove her night shirt, then pleasures himself in front of her before lying back down to fall asleep. Jessica seems mortified and Carrie is clearly embarrassed at watching this.

Reed calls Carrie from the bathroom. She's worried about the fact that normally the girls aren't even allowed to speak with men other than the prince. Reed asks if the people Carrie has protecting her (there are none) will be able to follow her. Carrie says yes as long as her cell phone is turned on. She has Virgil go with her to provide some help for Reed. They track Reed's cellular signal from the car.

Reed goes to a hired car in the alley which is to take her to her encounter. The driver, friendly and conversational as he holds open the vehicle's door for her, then shoots her with a suppressed pistol and takes the gift necklace off her neck before leaving her body in the alley behind the club.

Carrie and Virgil are seconds behind. A distraught Carrie sees Reed's body but Virgil insists that they have to leave.

The next morning Jessica wakes up and sees Nicholas and Dana are both gone. They are on a walk and it seems like Dana is leaning towards telling her father about Mike. Nicholas shows her a padlock on a chain link fence with his and Jessica's initials on it that he and Jessica put it there when they were dating. He tells Dana that what has happened to their family isn't easy for anybody. He says that both he and Jessica are struggling and Dana should cut her some slack. Dana doesn't say anything about Mike.

Estes tells Carrie that Reed was DOA and the missing necklace was a crown jewel of some sort. The thought is that the Saudis made her as an informant and decided to use the necklace as a way to fake a robbery. Carrie watches the police interrogation of Farid. He seems genuinely upset that Carrie is dead and demands the police find out what happened. She's furious to learn Farid and his entourage are on their way flying back to the Gulf.

We watch the family portion of the interview. The moderator asks about the homecoming. Nicholas pauses for a long time and Dana cuts in to save the day, softly talking about how great things have been.

Carrie finds Reed's parents sitting with their daughter's body. They aren't allowed to be told their daughter was more than just a high-profile escort.

Carrie tells Saul she's frustrated they can't tell Reed's parents their daughter deserved better. She's tired of being cut out, is upset her informant was killed and begins to cry. Saul comforts her. Carrie doesn't think Farid could have known Reed was going to be killed. They wonder if perhaps somebody in the entourage was actually the person Abu Nazir was meeting with. Saul says that the best way to move wealth is through jewelery. We cut to Farid's second-in-command selling the necklace for $400,000.

We then see a real estate agent congratulating a young couple on purchasing their first home with cash. The man is of Middle Eastern descent and the home is near an airport, which the ""wife"" says is perfect for them."

Brody, every bit the hero and playing the good soldier card, speaks easily and inspirationally to a group of troops about to embark for the Gulf War, advising them: ""Friendly fire isnt. Never lie. Never leave a man behind. And if you pick it, it will not heal."" They laugh.

A political operative of the vice president, Elizabeth Gaines, asks Estes about Brody's psychological state, seemingly looking into the possibility for him running for office. It's implied that this will help Estes' chances to be named CIA director.

Saul is next in Estes' office. He tells him about Abu Nazir and the necklace and they head over to Carrie's briefing. She is explaining that Reed's necklace was brought to a laundromat that doubles as a Hawala broker brought by Bin Abbud's top aide, Latif Bin Walid. 51 people have come and gone since and they believe one of them may have the money. The plan is to open files on all of visitors. We see that one of the men is our homebuyer of the house near the airport.

Carrie's warrant is about to expire. Saul says he can't help her extend it and tells her to take down the surveillance and cover her tracks.

After his speech Brody invites Mike in for dinner, noting that for the past few weeks he hasn't been hanging out. Brody makes a comment that implies he's aware of what went on while he was gone between Mike and Jessica, though he doesn't explicitly accuse him.

Brody comes home to Chris excitedly watching a buck in the back yard. Brody grumpily mentions the deer will probably trample their new flowers. Brody goes to the garage to pray. He daydreams about hugging Jessica when he left for war. Brody then unlocks a toolbox and starts cleaning his military-issue handgun.

Brody notices that the flowers have indeed been trampled by the deer. The family leaves for church, allowing 90 minutes for Carrie to remove the surveillance. Carries hates it, but Virgil pushes her out the door.

We see the Brody family at church while Carrie, Virgil and Max remove the surveillance equipment. In the garage Carrie finds the basin Brody's been using to wash his hands when he prays. She doesn't seem to connect what it means. Virgil tells her they're almost done and they remove the last camera.

After church Body is introduced to Gaines, who attended the service. She wants to take him to lunch the following week.

Mike tells Jessica about the interaction with Brody. He thinks they should find a way to hang out together as a group. Jessica starts to confide in Mike about Brody but stops herself.

Estes asks another agent, Danny Galvez (Hrach Titizian), about Carrie. He dangles a promotion in exchange for information about her. Carrie comes in and Estes leaves. They discuss the guy we know bought the house near the airport, a professor named Raqim Faisel (Omid Abtahi).

Jessica asks Brody about the meeting with Gaines. Carrie sits, watching from the car. Galvez calls her with information about Faisel taking strange trips to the Middle East.

Jessica comes into Dana's room and asks if she's told Brody about her and Mike. Dana asks if she and Brody are getting a divorce.

While waiting to meet with Faisel, Galvez asks Carrie about Estes. She reluctantly confirms that they had a one-time hook-up. Faisel leaves his school and heads away from his apartment. The woman he is living with gets a call from a man who tells her that she should tell Faisel that the ""traffic on the beltway is bad and he should take a different route."" She rushes upstairs and hangs an American flag out an upstairs window. Faisel sees this just as he is about to turn into the driveway and calmly drives past the home.

At a bar Carrie and Galvez tell Estes that it looks as if Faisel's background checks out. Estes reaches out to her and they appear to make up on some level.

Jessica does some drinking at the party they're hosting. Mike and a date arrive. Brody is in the garage alone, watching the people inside while he cleans his gun. He notices Jessica place a hand on Mike's shoulder as he moves past her.

We hear gunshots and everybody goes outside. Brody has shot the deer. Chris walks outside and is upset. The partygoers leave and Jessica has it out with he husband, yelling at him for being distant and not being able to have sex with her. She says they need help. She says if he won't do it ""I can't do this anymore.""

Carrie gets home and starts staring at pictures of Brody.

Faisel and the woman discuss what happened with him being followed. He thinks they should leave, but she tells him they have been instructed to stay in the home. They kiss.

Faisel appears to have been cleared by the official investigation.

Carrie asks Saul if she can put a tail on Brody. He says no.

At home that night Carrie seems to think of something. She leaves.

Brody tells Jessica he's leaving to drop in on a veteran's support group, and from her reaction, we she she approves and takes this as a sign of hope. Carrie is outside the home, watching this.

She follows Brody to the support group. Carrie goes inside and bumps into Brody, telling him ""I'm not supposed to be here."" She leaves and he follows her outside. She pretends to be worried he recognized her since she's an active intelligence officer. Carrie says she bounces around to various meetings. They start talking and seem to strike up a rapport, connecting on a 'nobody understands what we've been through' level."

We see Brody praying in the garage as this person is blindfolded and placed on a small plane.

Carrie stops by her sister's place and isn't thrilled when her dad is there alone. She talks with her father for a few minutes before the phone rings. It's Galvez, saying the only surviving terrorist from the compound from which Brody was rescued has been captured.

Saul is at the airport welcoming his wife Mira, just back from time with her family in India.

Carrie steals a few pills from the family medicine cabinet and is on her way. She and her father talk about the side effects of the medication they are both taking.

Saul is called away. Mira isn't happy.

At the briefing we learn the terrorist, Hamid, was a mid-level member of Abu Nazir's group. Estes wants Brody to help Carrie and Saul interrogate Hamid.

After the briefing Carrie tells Saul she thinks including Brody in the interrogation is a terrible idea. He says they have no choice since there is still no evidence linking Brody to Abu Nazir. Saul has what might be a prayer rug on the floor of his office.

Mike is waiting for Brody during a daily run. He needs to come in but he can't tell him the reason. Brody is coolly antagonistic to his former friend. At home Chris mentions he has a karate thing coming up he'd like his dad to attend.

Saul oversees Hamid's transportation.

Carrie welcomes Brody to the facility where questioning will take place and pretends their support group meeting never happened. Saul interrogates Hamid, with Carrie and Brody watching in another room. Brody feeds Saul information about his torture at the hands of Hamid, the goal being to scare Hamid with how much they know about what happened. Saul mentions the safety of Hamid's family and leaves him with a piece of paper and crayon. They want him to give them some names and remind him how cruel Abu Nazir can be. Carrie thanks Brody for his help. He asks for time with Hamid but she says that's not possible.

At home Jessica shows Brody a new hair cut. She did it in part to thank him for going to the support group.

We see that Hamid is being subjected to torturous conditions: Every few seconds hot lights turn on and heavy metal music is blasted.

The next morning Hamid begins to write. He tells them he doesn't have know any names, but gives them a Pakistani E-mail address. Carrie asks him whether Brody ever met Abu Nazir. He says he won't talk until he has proof his family (who the CIA has in protective custody) is safe.

Brody goes to see Estes. He makes a lengthy plea to be able to spend time with Hamid. He says he needs to look his attacker in the eyes and show him he didn't beat him in order to move on with his life. Estes seems to be convinced.

A tech guy looks into the E-mail address Hamid provided. He sends a test E-mail and tracks where it goes. Carrie is stunned when he shows her where it lands.

Carrie rushes to tell everyone that the E-mail ended up at Faisel's college. He is the new focus.

Estes takes Brody to see Hamid.

Faisel hasn't been at the university all day. Carrie calls Virgil and asks him to help look into it.

Brody meets with Hamid. Hamid ends up spitting in his face and the two wrestle on the floor, briefly out of the sight-line of the video cameras.

Virgil finds an address in Faisel's office of the house near the airport.

Brody comes home and finds that Mike took Chris to his karate thing. Brody and Mike have a contentious exchange.

Carrie and Virgil watch Faisel's house. Saul calls her and tells her that Hamid is dead. having killed himself using a fragment of a razor blade. Carrie tells him he went through a dozen cavity searches and assumes it was passed to him. They wonder if this means Faisel could have been tipped off. Saul gives her the go-ahead to move in and they find that it appears Faisel left in a hurry.

Saul and Mira have a discussion. She appears to be saying that she can no longer put up with the demands of his work schedule and needs more. The doorbell rings with Carrie. She shows him footage of Brody's meeting with Hamid and they notice the wrestling around on the ground happened to take place in a blind spot away from the room's many cameras. Carrie wants to go Estes, but Saul thinks it's too early. They get into a huge argument and he tells her to leave.

A weeping Carrie shows up at her sister's door. She says she thinks she's just quit her job. She ends up staying and her nieces join her in bed.

Brody apologizes to Chris and says he's proud of him.

Carrie gets up in the middle of the night. One of the nieces wakes up and tells her she's a little worried about the bad guys. She wants Carrie stay with them and says they'll protect her. Carrie says, ""That's my job."""

In a meeting Carrie suggests that they polygraph everybody who met with Hamid while he was in custody. Saul defends the idea and it gets approved. Afterward Carrie tells Saul this is her great plan to get Brody.

Brody is finishing a speech for Walker's memorial. Their family will be hosting the reception afterwards. Jessica tells him about not getting along with Walker's wife.

Carrie does well in her polygraph, though there is a blip when she says she hasn't taken illegal drugs since working at the CIA. Estes is pretty grouchy during his polygraph.

Saul goes to Faisel's home. A neighbor says he kept to himself, but mentions that there was a woman there living with him.

A panicked Faisel and his female companion are on the run in her car. He's very nervous and she attempts to keep him calm. She apologizes for ""dragging you into this.""

Brody speaks at the service. He takes the podium and flashes back to beating Walker to death. After a few words Brody stands at attention and begins calling the name and rank of every Marine at the service. Each answers ""present."" He gets to Walker and calls his name three different times. It is an emotional moment. After the service Carrie tells Brody he needs to appear the following day for a polygraph.

Saul tells Estes about the woman in Faisel's life. He also asks about being re-assigned to the field.

Faisel and his girlfriend arrivie at a rural home. They go on the porch and look inside. She notices a bomb trigger connected to the front door and tells Faisel they need to leave. They get in the care and take off. We see somebody in a car watching. Faisel is now even more panicky but she continues to tell him he needs to relax.

At the reception following the funeral Brody's men ask him how they were taken. He gives them a story and an injured former soldier named Lauder tells Brody he's full of it. He wants to know why Brody is all of a sudden working to help the military recruiting effort. He also begins to talk about Mike being with Jessica while Brody was gone. Mike punches the crippled Lauder in the face a few times. Brody pulls Mike off and starts beating Mike. Brody gets in his car and leaves.

Carrie has figured out that Faisel's girlfriend is Aileen Morgan. They have a mug shot of her protesting a G4 summit but don't know much else. Saul is grabbed for his polygraph. Aileen is a rich girl and lived in Saudi Arabia for four years during part of which time Faisel was also in the country.

There is a blip in Saul's polygraph when he's asked about passing Hamid a razor blade. The questioner tells him to relax and Saul says he can't with what it happening right now. He gets up and says he'll finish the test tomorrow.

Saul returns to the Aileen meeting. Carrie brings up the possibility that Aileen is the terrorist. Brody calls Carrie and tells him he can't do the polygraph because ""I'm a mess.""

Carrie meets Brody at a bar. He mentions the fight with his best friend and she talks about pretending not to know him at the questioning. They start drinking pretty heavily together. Outside in the parking lot they both seem pretty loaded. Carrie ""slips"" and tells him about the razor blade he will be questioned during the polygraph test. They start kissing and fall into her car. They have brief drunken sex.

Faisel is still freaking out and wants them to turn themselves in. Aileen suggests going to Mexico. She goes to the bathroom. A car pulls in front and machine gun fire riddles the door, killing Faisel. A frantic Aileen is able to escape out the bathroom window.

Saul tells Mira (Sarita Choudhury) he put in for the New Delhi station. She says she doesn't want him to come with her. She ""needs"" to go alone. He asks for how long and she says she doesn't know. It sounds like she's leaving him for good.

Brody gets home the next morning just as the kids are leaving for school.

Carrie watches Saul's polygraph the next day and hears him talk about the trouble with his marriage. He seems to do well with the razor blade question.

Brody arrives for his polygraph. He appears to pass with flying colors and Carrie looks stunned. She asks the questioner to ask about the razor blade a second time, still nothing. She then wants him to ask Brody if he's ever been unfaithful to his wife. He says ""no"" and still passes. Carrie tells Saul that he's lying, but doesn't tell him how she knows.

Carrie sees Brody pull up in his car in the parking lot. He tells her to get in. She does and they drive off."

In the car Brody asks Carrie if he passed the polygraph. He says he's taking some time away from Jessica and tells her his wife is sleeping with somebody else. Brody takes them to a dive bar where they shoot some pool. A member of a Neo Nazi brazenly starts hitting on Carrie and when she screws around with him they have to fight their way out of there. She says they should go to her family's cabin.

Jessica and Dana get into a big fight, and the mother grounds her for the next three days.

Saul tells Estes that Aileen popped up in Beaumont trying to leave the country. Texas agents are going to intercept her and he wants the chance to question her down there. Since Nazir had her boyfriend killed, he thinks she'll give him up.

Brody and Carrie arrive at the cabin. She can't find the key and calls her sister. Her sister reminds her that she only has one more pill left and doesn't want her to skip her meds. Carrie gets inside before Brody and finds a revolver and loads it. Back outside she asks him about being able to beat the polygraph. He says he's become an expert on lying to save his life. They go inside and start fooling around.

Aileen's bus stops in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Mexican police grab her outside the bus and Saul is with them. He says he's her ride ""unless you prefer the federales."" They ride together, with feds following behind them. They have a 25-hour ride back to Virginia. He basically presents her with the opportunity to talk to him before they arrive and she's formally handed over to the FBI.

The next morning Brody and Carrie battle hangovers and debate whether they should head home.

Saul asks Aileen about the plan she and Faisel had with the house. He wants to know what Plan B might be and says he can help her. He starts to talk about Faisel but isn't getting through to her yet.

Brody and Carrie decide to stay and go on a hike. She tells him a story about a significant other being killed over there. He says he can't be with his wife the way he can with her.

Dana drinks beer and smokes pot with her friends at home. They want to leave and she argues that she's grounded. She walks into a closed door and badly cuts her arm when the glass panel shatters.

Saul asks Aileen if she realizes that she could face the death penalty. She asks why he's even here and he says he thought they could ""understand each other."" She talks about her father finding out she was dating the ""local brown boy"" and he mentions his wife being brown as well.

Dana gets 19 stitches. Mike is there when they get home from the hospital, having watched Chris and temporarily fixed the door. Jessica tells Mike she misses him and they begin to kiss. Dana comes in and when her mother goes to check on Chris, she tells Mike that it would help if he'd stayed away: ""There's no place for my dad when you're here.""

Brody and Carrie make dinner and debate whether or not to drink. They stay away from the liquor and end up having what seems to be emotional, satisfying sex. During the night Brody yells out during a nightmare. Carrie comforts him.

Saul and Aileen stop in Saul's Indiana hometown. He tells her a bit about his childhood. Saul thinks she ended up where she is because of the boy she fell in love with. If that's true he says he wants to help get her through.

The following morning Carrie makes casual reference to the obscure tea that Brody drinks. She covers by saying ""you probably had it at Langley,"" but he looks suspicious.

Aileen starts to ask Saul about his marriage. Saul tells her where Faisel was buried and this leads to a break.

Saul calls Estes and says that Aileen was told only to buy that home underneath the airport flight path and wait for a vistor. The visitor, an American, arrived on Monday and was on the roof for an hour. Aileen is working with a sketch artist.

Brody tells Carrie that he never drank tea at Langley. He asks her if she spied on him and starts to put together how they got together. She admits that she's working and he wants to know ""on what suspicion?"" She tries to run and he shows her that he has the gun. She tells him about the bomb-maker telling her that Nazir turned ""an American POW"" just before he was executed. She admits that she is the one who thinks he is working for terrorists. He puts the gun down and tells her to ask him anything. He says he didn't slip Hamid the razor blade. She asks about his garage and he tells her that he goes there to pray and admits to being a Muslim, saying he turned to religion after being ""in despair for eight years."" He also admits that he killed Walker. He was told by Nazir that he if he didn't beat Walker to death he'd be killed himself. Brody says he lied about meeting Nazir because he was embarrassed that he took comfort from the man. He says he did not become one of Nazir's followers, but Nazir ""was kind to me. And I loved him.""

An agent on Aileen's roof starts scanning the area with binoculars, and tells them that it is one mile from the airport with a view of the helipad for ""M-1,"" or Marine One. This is well within the range of an expert sniper and Saul tells Estes to send him a picture of Brody so Aileen can take a look at it.

Back at the cabin Carrie still isn't convinced: ""I know an American POW was turned. It has to be you."" Saul calls her cell phone as Brody says he is leaving. She lets him walk out and answers the phone. It's Saul telling her that in fact a POW was turned, but Aileen has identified Walker, who is still alive and now a terrorist. She runs after Brody and tells him she was wrong and that what they shared meant something. He says ""F*%# you"" and drives off. She weeps.

Brody goes home. He looks in on all of his family members and then goes outside to the backyard. He cries."

Walker's wife Helen (Afton Williamson) and son Lucas (Jaden Harmon) are in Estes's office. She tells Carrie that her son mentioned seeing his father near his school. Walker's wife isn't sure what to do with the information that her husband is alive and has been brainwashed.

Saul asks Brody to confirm his answers about Walker. He ends with ""All I know for sure is that he's dead.""

Brody spots Carrie in the hallway and asks her why she's there. She says she can't tell him. He accuses her of sleeping with him to get information.

Brody comes home and tells Jessica about being called back to Langley. She tells him she waited on him for six years after being told he was dead. She says ""I screwed up,"" but doesn't think she should still have to pay for that. Brody says ""I don't want everything to fall apart.""

Saul tells Carrie he thinks Walker has been calling his family's voicemail to listen to his wife and son's voices. Estes and FBI Special Agent Hall (Joe Urla) come into Saul's office and are filled-in. Hall doesn't like the idea of waiting for a call via Walker's wife.

During family game night Jessica gets a call about a party she and Brody had been invited to. It's being hosted by the political player Elizabeth Gaines he'd been introduced to. Brody agrees to go.

Saul wants Mira to go with him to Elizabeth's party. She says she's still leaving the next morning. Carrie knocks on the door and tells him she's been placed in charge of the task force. She admits to having contacted Brody and then gotten involved in a relationship with him. He eventually gives her a hug and sends her off.

Carrie is at the Walkers' with Helen. They fake her leaving to take her son Lucas to school. The first phone call is a telemarketer. Helen begins to weep afterwards, scared to talk to him. The next call is a hang-up. They trace the call to an area of NorthEast DC.

Walker dismantles the cell phone he has just used. He pulls the key off the dollar bill.

Chris points out to Dana that their parents don't seem to be fighting. A limo arrives to bring the Brodys to the party.

Saul and Mira also leave for the party and he tells her about the guy they're chasing having the ""fatal flaw"" of loving his wife.

At the party Saul correctly guesses that Elizabeth Gaines (Linda Purl) has a plan for Brody and Jessica.

Carrie is staying at the Walkers' place. Helen talks about being lucky to find her new husband and asks Carrie about her personal life.

Brody holds court at the party, telling a few entertaining war stories. He and Jessica notice that everybody at the party is being incredibly nice to them. They realize they're being courted. Elizabeth tells Saul if he wants to talk to her about Mira she'll be there. On TV the entire party sees that a Congressman has been caught in a sex scandal. Elizabeth clearly knew this was going to come out.

In the limo ride home Jessica and Brody seem to be enjoying each other's company. They get home and find the kids still awake. The family sits together and watches a movie.

Helen gets another phone call. This time she asks ""Tom is that you?"" and begins talking to a silent Walker who is just listening on his end. While Helen talks the CIA team gets a location for Walker from his cellular signal. Helen says she never stopped loving him. When Walker finally says ""Helen?,"" she has terrible second thoughts and screams a warning that she's done a terrible thing, that the call is being tracked and that he needs to get out of there now. He puts the phone down and takes off a split second ahead of authorities. Walker takes down one member of the team and takes his pistol. When Carrie hears Walker's location she orders the team to stay back and flank him. But it's too late; they follow him into a mosque and mistakenly shoot two men during morning prayer.

Walker manages to escape and we see him at the storage locker. Inside he opens a large suitcase that contains a take-down sniper rifle.

Estes tells Carrie, Saul and Hall that what happened was ""a nightmare."" The consensus seems to be their only option is to go public and identify Walker as a terrorist.

Carrie goes to Brody's house early the next morning and tells him that Walker is still alive. She is letting him know that they are going public about the manhunt a few hours ahead of time. She tells him about their time together in the cabin ""it wasn't just my job."" Jessica stands at the front door and he goes back inside the house with her and Carrie leaves.

Saul comes home just as Mira is leaving for the airport. He was supposed to make her breakfast but missed it because of the Walker fiasco. In tears she said she can't recall the last time he was home for 12 straight hours He says work is his Achilles heel and they hug. She gets in the cab and leaves.

Five hours following the announcement Saul tells Carrie they've gotten 2,000 tips, all likely bogus. He thinks Walker is likely deep in his hole. She tells him she's had an epiphany and thinks she's going to be alone her entire life.

The man from the Diplomat vehicle who passed the money with the numbered key and the scribbled message to Walker. comes home. His electronic security system lets him know that someone in his the living room. He sees a person is watching TV news coverage of the manhunt for Tom Walker.

He says ""Walker are you crazy? You can't be here...."" But it's Brody. He's furious, chokes the man and says ""you people told me Walker was dead."" The man tells him he'll have to talk to Abu Nazir. Brody says he's done talking to Abu Nazir: ""Tell him it's over."""

He calls with a question but she doesn't hear the phone so he leaves a message. Jessica and Dana talk about Tom Walker being the terrorist and how that must be affecting Brody. In the parking lot Jessica calls Brody just as he is attacked by three men. He handles himself quite well until one of them injects something into his neck.

Carrie goes to the scene of the mosque shooting. Outside the Imam is saying that his people did not know Walker and the victims were fired upon first. She is met by Special Agent Hall (Billy Smith). He walks her through the scene and shows her that Walker had to have known the layout of the mosque well enough to get away.

Later Carrie speaks with the Imam. He tells her he has seven eyewitnesses who said Walker never fired a shot. He implies that he knows something, but won't talk without getting anything in return, specifically an apology from the FBI.

Jessica leaves Brody a message.

We see somebody taking off Brody's shoes and wiping his face. Before his eyes open he flashes back to Iraq three years earlier. He is with Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) in a nice-looking apartment. Nazir says ""this is your new home"" and he offers him a hot bath. In the bathroom Brody looks at himself in the mirror. After Brody cleans himself up Nazir introduces him to a young boy named Issa. He says he will live there with Issa until he learns fluent English. The young boy is shy at first and Brody tentative in his approach. But he and Issa slowly make a connection over soccer.

In present day Brody is still unconscious and being examined by a doctor.

Carrie tells Paul about the Imam withholding information. She suggests the FBI needs to admit being wrong. Hall basically admits his guy screwed up but says in no uncertain terms that the FBI will never admit the mistake.

Brody flashes back to trying to use soccer to connect with Issa.

Carrie plays the secretly recorded audio of her conversation with Hall to Estes. Estes points out that using the tape would be burning an important bridge with the FBI and that they have no guarantees about the Imam's info. He tells her not to do anything that could jeopardize the FBI's manhunt.

Issa knocks over some glasses with the soccer ball. Brody takes responsibility for the accident to Nazir. Issa smiles briefly.

Saul almost catches Carrie taking one of her anti-psychotic pills in his office. She tells him she's sure the Imam isn't a bad guy. Saul thinks she's approaching the problem the wrong way.

Brody and Issa pray together.

Carrie visits the Imam and his wife at their home. She appeals to the potential of what could happen if another terrorist attack occurs and it is discovered he withheld information. He still wants ""the truth"" and ultimately he refuses to tell her anything additional. At a dead end, Carrie leaves her card with them.

We see Walker in the woods with his rifle. He places a target on a tree and begins to practice.

Brody's English lessons with Issa are working. It's taken a years, but Issa seems to be bonding with him.

Carrie gets a call from Zanira, the Imam's wife who wants to meet in 15 minutes.

A hunter comes across Walker in the woods. They compare firearms and it's clear the hunter is suspicious.

Zanira tells Carrie that Walker has been at the mosque 8-10 times over the past month, each time meeting with a man who does not come there to pray. The man drives a car with diplomatic Saudi plates.

Issa finds Brody having one of his nightmares. He has drawn a picture of them together.

Brody wakes up in present day. He is bandaged. There is a TV in the middle of the room. On it is a live satellite feed with Nazir. Brody thinks everything he believed in was based on the lie that Walker was dead. Nazir says that Walker is ""helping, that's all you need to know."" Brody references being trusted to teach Nazir's son. Nazir asks ""Have you forgotten?""

Brody flashes back again to teaching Issa. After Issa leaves for school Brody hears a huge explosion. He goes outside to find his school has been bombed. Brody finds Issa's body under the rubble. Brody weeps and carries the boy away. Together Brody and Nazir prepare Issa's body for burial.

Nazir tells Brody he prays he never forgets what he committed to do in Issa's name. It sounds as if what is happening was Brody's plan, not Nazir's. The feed ends and another man comes in to play archived footage of a U.S. press conference. It's the Vice President (Jamey Sheridan) saying that a drone attack successfully hit Nazir's terrorist compound and the images of dead children are false, created by the terrorists for propaganda purposes. He further tells Brody that the Vice-President will call him shortly, asking him to run for the recently-vacated Congressional seat, and that he is to accept that request. If Brody does, it will be a signal to Nazir that he is still committed.

The hunter who spotted Walker heads back to his pickup truck and looks at Walker's face on the front page of USA Today. Just before he can drive away Walker kills him.

Brody is given some pills and directed to his car.

Walker drives away in the hunter's truck with the man's body covered up in the bed.

Brody drives away just as Saul and Carrie up to the same block. Saul says Carrie needs to find a way to interrogate the Saudi diplomat.

Jessica is upset with Brody, who tells her that he was attacked and robbed. He says he has a few broken ribs but didn't want to worry her. He says he wants to make sure to spend more time with the family. She says they have a voicemail from the Vice President's office."

Saul is briefing the department about Al Zahrani who is $750,000 in debt and despite his three wives and 10 children, is a closeted homosexual. They have video and photos of him with men in a bathhouse. They need to find a way to get Al Zahrani to talk, and the answer may be the equity bank that holds most of his debt.

Carrie meets with a bank representative and asks ""how would you like to cause him some pain?"" and says the CIA wants to borrow the bank.

Brody gets a surprise visit from Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) and his Secret Service protective detail. After the detail has secured the Brody home, the Vice President asks them to ""clear the room."" He then says he wants Brody to run for Congress in the upcoming special election for Representative Richard Johnson's recently vacated seat. He says he needs to discuss it with Jessica.

A representative from the State Department doesn't like the CIA's plan of meeting with Al Zahrani for two hours during his lunch break. Saul and Estes (David Harewood) don't seem to care. The plan is for Carrie to run the interrogation, because her being a woman could throw him off.

Carrie gets to work researching Al Zahrani.

Brody tells Jessica about running for office. She thinks it's a terrible idea, because the result will be their personal life getting dragged through the public eye, and makes specific reference to her relationship with Mike Faber and his sexual bender with &quot;the CIA girl.&quot;

Brody calls Carrie and says he wants to meet regarding something personal. They plan on the following night.

Brody goes to see Mike (Diego Klattenhoff). He apologizes for hitting him and says that he and Jessica didn't do anything wrong, since they thought he was dead. He asks for Mike's help convincing Jessica to let him run for office.

They bring Al Zahrani (Ramsey Faragallah) up to an empty floor. They force him to stay and when he wants to make a call to his embassy Carrie shows him pictures from the bathhouse. He has a seat. She explains that it is clear he is getting money from another source and they know that it is Abu Nazir. Al Zahrani says he doesn't know Abu Nazir. When Carrie threatens to expose his secret he says he doesn't care. His wives are fully aware of who he is and he's willing to pay the price. Carrie's last-minute ploy is to threaten deporting his most talented daughter, a student at Yale who is interested in art. If the U.S. keeps her from living in America or Europe she will be forced into a subservient life in Saudi Arabia. This works, and Al Zahrani explains his relationship with Walker. He has a special signal he gives Walker when they need to see each other and they tell him to set it up a meeting.

Mike drops by to see Jessica. He pleads Brody's case and advises her that perhaps she should listen to him.

Brody comes to Carrie's place where she has opened a glass of wine, has Miles Davis playing as atmosphere and is wearing a nice dress. But he is only there to make sure that if he runs for office no one will ever know about their relationship. She gives him her word. After he leaves she angrily dumps the wine she had poured for them down the sink, throws the bottle out and begins to cry.

Saul is struggling without his wife Mira.

The time of the Al Zahrani/Walker meeting has arrived. Agents and snipers cover the very public Farragut Square in D.C. where they are to talk. Al Zahrani arrives but there is no sign of Walker. Eventually an Africa-American man approaches with a briefcase, but he is wearing a hat and keeping his head down. It could be Walker, but nobody knows for sure. When Carrie realizes that he is holding the briefcase in his left hand (Walker is right-handed) she begins to get suspicious. The man walks up to Al Zahrani and we see Walker (Chris Chalk) is watching this from a nearby building with a cell' 'phone in his hand. Carrie screams for everybody to get away just as Walker pushes a button and the case explodes. Carrie is blown backwards violently. We see a horrific scene of death and lost limbs.

Jessica tells Brody that, after discussing things over with the kids, they all support Brody's desire to run for the vacant seat in Congress.

Saul has concluded that while they know that Tom Walker has turned and is working for Abu Nazir, there must be a mole inside the government and working close to his CIA branch who somehow tipped Walker to the trap in the public square.

Carrie has a severe concussion but will be okay. She lies in a hospital bed and watches Brody officially announce his candidacy on the television screen."

Estes gets word that the President isn't thrilled with how Walker is making them all look bad. In terms of finding the leak, Saul tells Estes that 16 different agencies had knowledge of the mission with Al Zahrani. The Vice President wants to speak with Estes.

Saul shows up at the hospital and finds that Carrie seems to be experiencing a full psychiactric break. Saul is stunned at what he's witnessing.

Dana reluctantly agrees to enjoy her family outing, a weekend trip to Gettysburg before Brody's campaign starts up.

A doctor finally shows up. Carrie is still acting crazy and Saul tells her ""You're not yourself."" He explains what she's doing and the doctor asks if she's seeing anybody else. She tells them to call her sister Maggie.

Brody and his family are on the road.

Saul brings Carrie home where they wait for Maggie. Maggie (Amy Hargreaves) tells Saul that she's bi-polar and the explosion must have set of her off. Maggie gives her some meds and goes outside to talk with Saul. Maggie says it could be days or even a week before she completely evens out. A psych ward is the best place for her but Saul realizes that would kill her security clearance forever. Maggie agrees to watch her during the day as long as Saul comes back for the night shift.

The Vice President is upset with Estes that he's being forced to hide out while Walker is at large. He wants to announce his candidacy for Presidency soon. Estes mentions that the explosives in the park were connected to the Saudis. The Vice President tells him to fire someone, ""I don't care who.""

Brody teaches his kids all about the Battle of Gettysburg. Brody speaks passionately and knowledgeably about the battle and talks about doing ""whatever is necessary"" for a cause.

Saul tells Estes about Carrie's theory that the sniper thing might be a sideshow to something bigger. He says doctors are keeping her longer but doesn't tell him about her actual condition.

Dana tells Brody she didn't realize her father knew so much ""about anything."" She understands why he wanted to come there. He says thing are going to get ""pretty wild"" and makes her promise to watch out for Jessica when he's not around.

Carrie tells Maggie that something big is happening ""something dangerous,"" and she has no time for rest. Carrie runs out of the car through traffic and heads over to a piece of ground where one plant is peeking out. She thinks ""this is how everything works.""

Brody's family goes into town for lunch. He excuses himself and heads into another store. In the back he meets the explosive maker we saw earlier. The man places the vest (which is not armed) onto Brody and explains exactly how to use it. Brody references what will happen to his body after the explosion and they speak in Arabic. He leaves with a package and he hides it in the trunk of their car. Dana catches him and asks about the package. He says it is a surprise for Jessica.

A man in the restaurant recognizes Brody and says he'd vote for him. He shakes his hand and introduces him to his family and most of the people in the restaurant.

Saul comes to relieve Maggie, who tells him about the ""incident."" Carrie has been given a sedative and Maggie thinks she needs to rest. Saul goes upstairs to see Carrie, who is in bed. Saul apologizes for what has happened, saying he knew something had happened to her when she returned from Iraq. He says he should have asked ""If you were really okay.""

Downstairs Saul starts looking through the maze of ""work"" Carrie had been doing during the day. He pauses on something. It's a blown up copy of Aileen's driver's license. He starts grabbing other papers and placing them on the wall, grouping them by the color Carrie used in highlighting information. Eventually he covers the wall with her work.

Brody has a meaningful dialogue with Chris near the ice machine. It's clear he's saying goodbye in some way.

Jessica tells Brody she's seeing progress with their marriage. She wishes she had said yes earlier to him running for office. She smiles and says ""I'm happy."" They start to get intimate.

The next morning Carrie walks downstairs. She is emotional when she sees that Saul's been up all night looking at her work. It's a timeline for Abu Nazir's activities and they begin to talk through everything. They think during a break in Abu Nazir's activity he may have been mourning and something tragic must have happened. They need to find out what occurred. She tells him about the condition she has had since college. Maggie and Carrie's father Frank arrive to stay with her.

The next morning Dana goes into the car and start to open the wrapped package. He catches her just before she can get it open. She is skeptical of his excuse.

Frank is trying to help Carrie get through the final stages of her manic period. He can't stop her from making a phone call.

Brody and family get home. Dana's boyfriend Xander (Taylor Kowalski) is waiting for her. Carrie calls Brody. She's calling about Abu Nazir and is curious about the period of his life when they think something happened. He asks if it would help if they met.

Dana tells Xander her father was strange all weekend. She's taken video of him standing still for what seems like 10 or 15 straight minutes in the parking lot.

Carrie gets herself together in anticipation of seeing Brody, applying make-up to cover her wounds from the explosion in the park, fussing over her appearance and what she's wearing.

The doorbell rings but it is Estes with several agents. He says Brody called him and ""told me everything."" Estes mentions the fling and that Brody has said she was harassing him. The are clearing her office and now her home. They start to take down her work which Saul had laid out on the wall and he notices that something is wrong with her. She panics and starts crying as her sister and Estes try to calm her down."

Brody is leaving a videotape message to be viewed after he's dead. He talks about loving his country, and says what he's doing is simply part of the oath he has taken as a Marine. He thinks the Vice President of the U.S. is a domestic threat to the country.

Saul stops by to see Carrie. Maggie says she's not doing well. Carrie hasn't left her room in three days and isn't eating. Saul talks with Carrie. He doesn't discuss specifics, but promises not to give up on looking at Abu Nazir's break from doing bad things. She talks about Brody and he wonders if she's in love with him.

Brody finishes videotaping (inside a storage locker - the same locker where Walker had gotten his sniper rifle) and hides the video camera card in a stone wall, marking the location with a chalk line.

We see Walker hide in the backseat of a woman's car while she is playing bingo in a senior center.

Vice President Walden addresses key staff and supporters, talking about announcing his Presidential run the following morning. Estes thinks the plan is dangerous given how many important people will be there. Walden isn't worried since Walker is ""only one guy.""

Walker is still in the back seat as the woman drives up to a checkpoint near her home. Apparently she lives just two blocks from the State Department. When she gets into her underground garage Walker pops out from the backseat and sticks a gun to her head.

Virgil tries to help get Carrie to eat. It isn't working.

Brody says grace before dinner. This is unusual and Dana notices.

Walker cuts a circle in the glass in one of the woman's apartment windows. The women is tied up, unharmed, in a nearby chair.

That night Brody remembers the words of Abu Nazir. He goes to pray. Dana catches him and he has to explain that he has converted to Islam. They agree that Jessica wouldn't understand and this will be their secret.

DAY 2

Carrie wakes up and is frantic for her meds. Virgil brings them.

Saul brings Estes a partially redacted file. It is what he thinks is a drone strike during Abu Nazir's down period that seems to coincide with the terrorist's likely location at the time. Estes doesn't seem very interested, particularly given that it's related to Carrie's theory.

Jessica takes Chris to his karate match.

Carrie has Virgil take him for a drive and they end up at the scene of Walden's announcement. She tells him she thinks ""half the government"" will be in one spot and this may be the target. He explains that she is no longer working for the CIA and they should leave it alone. She tells him a single sniper doesn't make sense and tells him she's the same person she's always been. She seems to convince him she's onto something.

While Brody puts on his explosive vest Dana starts to talk to him from the hallway. She doesn't want him to go. She doesn't have a good feeling about what is happening with Walker and all the security. Brody arms his vest. His car arrives and he meets the Secret Service agent who has been assigned to him.

Estes and Walden talk and it seems Estes is also aware of the drone strike. Walden tells him he needs to get Saul to stop snooping.

Saul gets word from Galvez that it appears any record of that drone attack has been intentionally wiped from the files. Saul says he's going to follow-up on it himself.

Carrie and Virgil are now in the crowd. She explains that with the security on-hand the only way you attack that kind of event is if you're planning on taking all of the high-value targets out at once.

Walker takes his rifle and positions himself inside the window.

Brody arrives and makes small talk with Gaines. Walden shows up a few seconds later.

Walker loads a round into the rifle and fires. He kills Elizabeth Gaines, her blood spraying all over Walden. Everybody is rushed inside. Walker fires two more times, one bullet hitting a window and one hitting an agent. Everybody (including Brody) is moved past the metal detectors. Walker leaves the apartment.

Everybody is hustled into an underground bunker. Brody asks about Walden.

Saul gets a call from Carrie. She assures him that Gaines was not the target and Walker would not have missed three times. She knows that since Brody is being sequestered with Walden and the other high-value targets he must be the threat. She thinks Marine 1 and Marine 2 refer to Walker and Brody, rather than helicopters used by the Executive Branch. Saul agrees to bring her in to help but instead tells an agent that a woman is acting crazy and needs to be secured.

Walden finally arrives in the room and it is secured. Brody nervously pulls the trigger key from his sleeve and walks towards Walden. He flashes to Abu Nazir saying ""remember Issa"" and flips the switch. But nothing happens. It isn't working.

Outside Carrie realizes that Saul didn't buy her story. She gets Virgil's keys and takes off.

A frantic Brody goes to the bathroom and takes off the vest. He starts looking at the wires.

We see Dana watching the TV report of the shooting. There is a knock at the door. It's Carrie. She tells Dana that her father is working with Walker and she needs to call him on the phone and talk him down. Instead Dana dials 911 and says her address and that a crazy woman is at her house and yells at Carrie to leave. They argue on the front lawn just as Jessica comes home with Chris. The police arrive and Carrie is taken into custody. While Dana looks on she sees that the phone Carrie brought is still lying on the ground.

Brody fixes his vest and puts it back on. He walks back into the room and is a split-second from detonating the lethal device when an agent pats him on the back to say his daughter is on the phone. Dana wants to know whether he's coming home. Brody tries to brush her off but she makes him promise to her that he'll be home later. She says she needs him and Brody becomes emotional. He hangs up just as Walden leaves the secure room.

DAY 3

Jessica asks Brody about pressing charges against Carrie. He says he'll take care of it.

Walden meets with Saul. Walden tells Saul he should leave the whole drone thing alone. Saul says that Walden knows that isn't his style. Saul reminds him that he worked for Walden for three years and pulls out videos of torturous interrogations that Walden ordered. Walden asks if he's being blackmailed.

Carrie is released from custody. Brody is waiting in the parking lot. Brody assures her that he isn't what she thinks he is and wants her to get help. She gives him her word that she'll leave him alone. Carrie gets into Maggie's car and tells her to take her to the hospital.

Saul and Estes watch video of Walden and Estes ordering the drone strike that destroyed Abu Nazir's son's school. Walden knows what he is doing, but thinks the collateral damage is acceptable. Saul tells Estes he's considering going to the newspapers with this information, but Estes knows he won't because it would put too many CIA agents at risk and would be used as a recruitment tool for the enemy.

Brody goes looking for his video. He finds it is missing and a second chalk line has been placed on the wall. He goes home and gets his handgun.

Brody meets Walker, who demands to know what happened. Brody says his vest malfunctioned, but Walker doesn't seem to buy it. Walker has Abu Nazir on an open phone line. Abu Nazir asks to speak with Brody, who tells him that it may be for the best that the initial plan didn't work out. Brody now has access to the next President and may be able to influence policy. Abu Nazir seems to like this idea, but need some assurance of Brody's commitment. Using code, he tells Brody to kill Walker as proof of his loyalty and Brody does.

At home Brody kisses his kids and thanks Jessica ""for everything.""

TWO DAYS LATER

Saul storms into the pre-op area of a hospital. He meets with Carrie, who is being prepped for a type of electro-shock therapy. It comes with numerous risks, including short-term memory loss, but Carrie assures him this is what she wants. He says she was right about Abu Nazir and tells her about the drone attack.

Dana joins Brody up on the roof of their house. The sit and enjoy the view.

Just as Carrie is given her anesthesia she starts flashing back to memories of being in bed with Brody their weekend at the cabin. One of those recollections is Brody's nightmares. She recalls him saying ""Issa! No!"" and realizes that Brody knew Abu Nazir's son. She mumbles ""Don't let me forget that"" in the direction of Maggie, but nobody really knows what she said.

The first shock goes through her body."

Aang must somehow find a cure for his friends. While skilled archers deployed by Fire Nation Admiral Zhao are on the hunt for Aang, the Avatar locates an old monastery and herbarium run by an insane woman. She nevertheless reveals to Aang that the skin secretions of such-and-such type of frog will cure her friends: they must suck on the frogs, specifically. While Aang is out hunting frogs, he is captured by Zhao's forces and brought back to a Fire Nation fortress. Prince Zuko views the situation as a unique emergency: he determines to free the Avatar from Admiral Zhao. Zuko dons his Blue Spirit costume and, ninja-like, steals into the fortress and disables several firebender prison guards. The Blue Spirit springs the Avatar from his predicament, handcuffed upright to two pillars on either side. Avatar and Blue Spirit must work together to escape from the fortress, taking advantage of lightning-quick wushu skills. The Blue Spirit is knocked out and Aang discovers, to his astonishment, that he is none other than Prince Zuko. Aang helps Zuko come to and offers some friendly comments, whereupon Zuko springs to action and firebends to kill against Aang. Aang uses his airbender powers to jump up to the forest canopy and escape. He is finally able to bring the medicinal frogs to his friends, Sokka and Katara, whom he left at home with Appa and Momo."

Elizabeth Jennings is getting some inside info from a member of the Department of Justice. That night, as she's removing his clothes in bed, he continues telling her about ""the sheer number of people dedicated to destroying our way of life"" while she pleasures him. We next see her leaving, removing her blond wig and driving away.

Three days later, we see Philip Jennings and another man waiting to execute a hit. Elizabeth pays a man for a few moments worth of looking out his window. Philip waits for Elizabeth's signal from the window. He waits for the man to approach. The man pauses before reaching the spot where Philip is waiting, then runs away. Philip and his accomplice give chase, with Philip identifying himself as ""immigration."" Philip and his accomplice follow the man into an alley, where the man ducks in for a moment and stabs Philip's cohort in the stomach before continuing to flee.

Philip catches up to the man, who pulls a blade on him. After a brief fight, the man tells Philip he knows he's not supposed to be killed, but Philip tells the man he has no idea how badly he's wanted. ""I could deliver you in a hundred pieces and get a medal for each one."" Philip secures the man and Elizabeth drives up in a car waiting to take the man away. The man shouts for help while being pushed into the car as Philip acts like he's a cop and gives the man his Miranda rights. Philip hops into the driver's seat and takes off. He stops in an alley to change the license plates on the car and drives away again.

Philip and Elizabeth drop their colleague off near a hospital for treatment, instructing him to identify himself as a John Doe and walk to the hospital from the drop-off spot. Philip and Elizabeth drive off with their captor asking the to consider his offer to help. Philip droves up to a dock and they watch a cargo ship sail away. Philip turns and asks, ""Why is everyone so punctual in this business?""

At FBI headquarters, a couple of agents are heading to a meeting and waiting for the arrival of ""Timoshev,"" an ex-KGB colonel who blew the whistle on some undercover agents ""supposedly"" hiding in the U.S., Agent Chris Amador tells his colleague. He's not convinced such agents exist, saying that men like Timoshev are paid millions to give up information. Timoshev has told the FBI that these agents aren't allowed to say a single word in Russian once they get to the States. ""Someone's been reading too many spy novels,"" Amador says.

We next see Philip Jennings untying his captor, who tells him the FBI paid him $3 million when he ""came off"" and more since, as a consultant. He tells Philip he can get twice that, and another $3 million for returning him. Philip pushes the man back into the trunk. We next see Philip and Elizabeth in their very normal looking American home in the morning, ushering their kids off to school. After the kids leave, Philip and Elizabeth talk about the man's $3 million claim, but Elizabeth says, ""He can buy himself a diamond-plated coffin.""

We next see Philip sitting on a park bench watching carefully at all the people around him. He sees police looking around for a suspect in some kind of robbery. Philip pulls something from his pocket and sticks it under the bench before walking away.

Back at their house, Elizabeth goes into the garage and pauses for a moment while catching her reflection in the back of the car window. She's taken back to the Soviet Union in 1960 where she's doing some boxing training. The captain arrives and takes over the training session. He tries a few of her fighting techniques on him, which he easily fends off. Eventually he gets her into a submissive hold on the ground, tears off her sweats and rapes her as her original trainer walks away.

Back in the garage in 1981, Elizabeth opens the trunk, looks inside and says, in a perfect American accent, ""Remember me, captain?"" She looks at him for a moment before slamming the trunk door back down.

It's another day in the Jennings house, where their daughter Paige is learning about ""how the Russians cheat on arms control."" Philip gets home and tells Elizabeth he made the drop at the park and got no response. Elizabeth suggests ""he can move in permanently"" and she can fix the spare bedroom for him.

Later, the family is out having ice cream and Elizabeth isn't in the mood to play. Philip talks about a client meeting he has later that night.

Later, we see him visit a woman named Martha. She calls him Clark. Philip speaks quickly about being a part of the Committee to Oversee United States Counterintelligence Agencies, and that their meeting is classified. Martha tells him about a man who was kidnapped. ""He was supposed to speak at a conference this morning, but he didn't show."" Philip asks if there was a ""centralized response"" to the kidnapping. Martha says she's not allowed into such meetings. She says the man who was kidnapped was Russian, and they had a vehicle description: A 1977 Oldsmobile, gold with D.C. plates and bumper stickers. The kidnappers were two men and a woman one of the men was ""average height with dark hair.""

That night, Philip goes through a hidden storage space behind a circuit box and plays a tape of Elizabeth's encounter with the man she met at the beginning of the episode. He listens to some of her sexual exploits with the man before he tells her about his plan to give $100,000 to a KGB defector. Philip stops the tape.

Philip reports back to Elizabeth about how the FBI is putting the pieces together about their kidnapping and the increased surveillance is likely the reason they aren't hearing back from their contacts. Elizabeth wants to kill the man because he'll just be killed back in Moscow anyway. She says the man is putting them all in danger. Philip suggests that they defect themselves and become millionaires, and ""a lot of our problems just go away."" Elizabeth isn't amused.

The next day, Philip and the kids are going to the mall. Elizabeth stays behind. At the mall, Philip embarrasses his daughter by trying on some cowboy boots and dancing along to a song playing in the store. Philip hears a man make a sexual suggestive comment to his daughter and decides not to handle the guy which we know full well he could.

Elizabeth, back at the house, takes a large knife from the kitchen and heads toward the garage. Philip and the kids get home. Philip notices the knife and Elizabeth asks, ""What, you think I killed him?"" Philip says he was ""just checking."" Philip kisses the back of Elizabeth's neck and she tells him to stop, eventually pulling the knife close to him. Philip reminds her that she's his wife, and Elizabeth says, ""Is that right?""

The Jennings' go over to welcome some new neighbors who've just moved in. They meet Agent Stan Beeman, who works for the FBI and tells them he works in counterintelligence. Philip jokes, ""I have to make sure I don't do any spying around here."" Agent Beeman tells him, ""Especially not for the Russians.""

""Oh, they're the worst, right?"" Philip says.

""They certainly are, Philip,"" Agent Beeman says. ""They certainly are.""

That night, Elizabeth tells Philip it's ""probably just a coincidence."" She says they need to get rid of Timoshev that night. Philip thinks that's the last thing they want to do. He thinks it could be an opportunity just be ""us."" He says they might be blown, and they ""are Philip and Elizabeth Jennings we have been for a long time."" He reminds her of the money they could get for Timoshev.

""Are you joking?"" she asks him. ""Is this a joke?""

Philip asks her what's so bad about America. She asks him what he'd tell their kids and he says ""the truth."" She slaps him. She says their kids would never forgive them. She says they wouldn't get away with it and asks him, ""Have you seen our trunk?"" Philip says that Timoshev was ""a fool"" and came back to give speeches and left clues about where he was staying. ""We'd be more careful,"" he tells her. She leaves.

The next day, Philip is out for a run and flashes back to Moscow, April 1962. He's looking at a picture of a woman, which he tears and throws in the trash when a colonel approaches. He's taken to a room, where he meets Elizabeth. They're left to ""get acquainted."" They're instructed to get to know each other and their new identities, knowing nothing of their actual identities. After his run, Philip calls the hospital to check on his colleague from the night of the kidnapping. He learns that the man ""expired"" that night.

When he gets home, Agent Beeman comes over and asks Philip for some jumper cables. Philip brings Agent Beeman into the garage, who notices the make and model of the car. Philip opens the trunk, instructs Timoshev to stay quiet, and retrieves the jumper cables. He hands them over. Agent Beeman says he has to go, and Philip leads him out.

Back at FBI headquarters, Agent Beeman meets a CIA agent about the kidnapping of Timoshev. Beeman says that if Russians kidnapped Timoshev they'd probably want to just stay close to their own house.

That night, Philip makes it through a school function with his son, where an American astronaut is on hand and the national anthem is played in all its glory. Later, Philip pulls Timoshev from the trunk and tells Elizabeth he's taking Timoshev to make a deal. She tells him she's a KGB officer and would die and lose everything before betraying her country. She decides to finish things herself. Elizabeth beats Timoshev so hard, at one point she kicks his head through the garage's drywall. She picks up a crowbar and Timoshev tells Elizabeth he's sorry and never meant to hurt her. ""They let us have our way with the cadets. It was part of the job a perk,"" he says.

Philip asks what he's talking about and how Timoshev hurt her. Elizabeth drops the crowbar and says nothing but ""do what you want with him, take him to the Americans if that's what you want.""

As she's walking away, Philip grabs Timoshev, pushes him up against the wall and chokes him until he dies. He lets Timoshev's body fall, then turns to look at Elizabeth, who looks at him and says nothing.

We next see Philip and Elizabeth driving in silence with the exception of Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" playing in the background. They're driving in the Oldsmobile. We next see them pouring acid on Timoshev's body before sealing him in a bag and tossing him into some water. They get back into the car and look at each other. Saying nothing, Elizabeth climbs across the car and kisses Philip. They proceed to do more than kiss, right there in the car.

The next morning, Philip and Elizabeth are helping conceal each other's wounds and bruises. They eat breakfast with their kids when the phone rings. Elizabeth answers and looks stunned. Not saying anything, she looks at Philip.

Agent Beeman sees Philip taking his son Henry to hockey practice. Beeman notices Philip's band-aids on his neck and Philip says it's just a shaving incident. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is cleaning out the trunk of the Olds.

Back at his house, Beeman tells his wife he likes Philip, but wonders if there's something a little off about him. She teases him and tells him he's back in the real world with regular, boring people.

Philip winds up in the backyard of Errol, the man who'd hit on Philip's 13-year-old daughter at the store earlier. This doesn't end well for Errol, who winds up severely beaten and with the wrong end of a barbecue fork stuck through his hand.

Elizabeth gets around to telling Philip some of her real backstory: Her father died fighting Nazis.

That night, a curious Agent Beeman breaks into the Jennings' garage and snoops around for clues, examining the car and even opening its trunk. Seeing nothing amiss, Beeman shakes his head and opens the garage just enough to make his way out. Meanwhile, we see, Philip has been standing there watching and holding a gun, but never even making so much of a move for Beeman to even have known he was there."

Phillip is having thoughts about defecting to America for the right price. Elizabeth is outraged. They've kidnapped a Russian defector a former captain who raped Elizabeth during her training back in the mother land. Phillip didn't know how the captain hurt Elizabeth, but when she told him to do with the captain what he wants, Phillip killed him by crushing his throat.

'The Clock': We open on Phillip in bed with a woman who calls him Scott. We later see Phillip telling Elizabeth that ""she"" (presumably the woman) ""isn't cut out for this."" Elizabeth tells Phillip that the woman is good at getting men to turn their brains off, which has collapsed whole empires. She says the fact that the woman cares about ""Swedish intelligence officer"" Scott Berkman (Phillip's cover) is enough. Phillip says he isn't so sure she cares about ""him,"" either.

We next see the woman at a dinner party with her husband, where a bunch of guys are talking about various missiles. She sneaks off to snoop around the study and snaps some photos from a camera hidden in her bra. Security guards catch her and take her to another room.

Meanwhile, Phillip prepares to go meet the woman hoping she completed her task. He gets to a hotel room and finds her there, excited to tell him about being questioned by the guards. She tells him she played her part perfectly. She tells ""Scott"" that she thinks he's ""the one,"" and she loves him. He tells her he loves her, too. They have sex again.

Phillip develops the photos in a dark room while Elizabeth talks to him about ""Reagan ranting and raving"" and how he ""literally wants to destroy us."" They see a clock among the items in the study and focus on it. The plan will be to get someone on the inside, which could take ""six, seven months,"" according to Phillip, and they'll take it for a day, or so, to see what they can get from it before putting it back. Elizabeth notices a picture of the woman in her bra and says, ""You never told me she looked like that. Phillip stammers a little, and then says, ""well, she's not always dressed like that.""

Agent Beeman and Agent Amador are watching a woman walk into an electronics store. She walks out quickly with a wrapped box. Beeman gets out to question the man in the store about the woman who was in there. The man says he can't tell them ""a damn thing."" They start poking around behind the counter and find a tin with Russian writing on it. It's caviar, ""very fancy stuff,"" Amador says. They take it despite the store clerk's objections.

At the Soviet Embassy, plans are discussed in Russian about a visit by British Prime Minister Thatcher and Defense Minister Nott, who will be meeting Secretary of Defense Weinberger at his house. The two men Arkady and Vasili disagree on the best way to execute the mission. Arkady reminds Vasili that he (Arkady) reports to General Zhukov, an old friend of Vasili's. Vasili says he'll cable Zhukov right away, but Arkady warns him that ""Zhukov isn't who he used to be."" And adds, ""Be careful. I tell you as a friend,"" before walking out.

Phillip and Elizabeth get their orders in a coded message. Phillip thinks this mission, which is supposed to take place in three days, should take six months to plan. Elizabeth reminds him that ""these are orders"" and ""it must be necessary."" She says they can make adjustments as they go. Phillip thinks it's ""crazy.""

Elizabeth sits at a bench watching a man walk across what looks like a college campus. She walks toward him, holding an umbrella. She releases a sharp end from its point and, as she gets close to the man, trips on purpose apparently sticking him on the foot with the sharp end. He sees her and forgives her for the ""accidental"" fall, helps her pick up her books and keeps walking.

Back at home, Phillip rounds the kids up for dinner and asks Elizabeth if she finished up the Kryzinski package. She says yes. She then notices her 13-year-old daughter is wearing a red bra and doesn't seem to like it.

Phillip and Elizabeth show up at a woman's house in disguise, saying only that they ""need to talk"" about her son. Phillip abruptly walks in, with the woman trailing him and Elizabeth closing the door behind them. Phillip calls the woman by her name, Viola. Phillip explains to her that her son has been poisoned and he (Phillip) has the antidote. He will let Grayson, her son, die in 72 hours if she doesn't complete one task: She has to go into her boss' study and take the clock from the bookshelf.

That night, Phillip worries that Viola won't make a great target, but Elizabeth assures him that the fact that Viola believed him was all that matters. Phillip is also annoyed that Agent Beeman doesn't appear to be back home yet. He wishes he knew Beeman's schedule in order to avoid too many late-night run ins. Elizabeth is worried that Beeman is still suspicious of them, but Phillip tells her Beeman's face when he saw their trunk was clean made it clear that he felt silly for having suspected anything in the first place. Phillip tells her Beeman is no fool, but ""I think he's moved on.""

Elizabeth starts thinking about her kids. She thinks Henry, their younger son, would ""adjust"" if anything happened to them. But she worries about Paige, saying ""she's delicate somehow."" She turns off the light and goes to sleep.

The next day, Viola is in her boss' study and sees the clock. She moves toward it and the woman of the house walks in and asks Viola if she's ""seen Caspar's datebook."" Viola says it's in the dining room.

""That man,"" Weinberger's wife says. ""God help us if we ever go to war.""

Mrs. Weinberger notices that Viola looks tired. Viola says she worries about her son, and they talk briefly about how they ""almost lost"" him. But he made it through this vague episode ""thanks to you and Mr. Weinberger,"" Viola says. Mrs. Weinberger leaves the study and Viola turns and looks at the clock again.

At the travel agency, Elizabeth tells Phillip that Grayson looked bad that day and Viola almost lost it when she saw him. She tells Phillip they need to cover their meets as best they can, and she doesn't think he should go alone. He says they're ""sitting ducks, either way."" He hugs Elizabeth and feels a gun she's holding in her waistband.

""I'm not getting arrested,"" she tells him.

""What if there's 10 of them?"" he asks.

Elizabeth says she's not going to make the choice of being tortured and forced to give up everything she believes in.

""One day you could maybe find a way to make them understand,"" she tells Phillip, referring to their kids.

He tells her that ""if they are there"" and catch Phillip, ""they'll be at the house in an hour.""

Phillip heads to Viola's place. Inside, he asks Viola if she had any problems. Phillip turns and sees a man pointing a gun at him, saying, ""Give it to me."" Phillip pleads with the man not to shoot, all while moving just close enough to rip the gun away. After a long tussle, Phillip breaks the man's arm and takes the gun and points it at the man, then Viola. Asking who the man is, Viola admits he's her brother. She told him, but made him promise not to come. Phillip insists no one can ever know about this because they can always find her or her family and they'll ""pay the price."" She hands him the clock and he leaves.

Elizabeth asks Paige if she'd like to go to the mall to buy bras, but Paige tells her kids don't buy bras with their moms.

Elizabeth finds Phillip working on the clock. She sees his bruises from the fight and he tells her about Viola's brother. He thinks this whole thing is turning into a mess. She takes some headphones and goes into another room, then Phillip tests the bug he installed in the clock, quietly saying, ""Coming to you live, from the home of the Secretary of Defense.""

Elizabeth comes back in and says, ""Still joking. That's a good sign.""

The bug works.

Beeman gets home and no one is there. He looks out the window and sees Phillip playing street hockey in his driveway with Henry. He walks over and they chat a bit about sports, saying they should go play racquetball. They talk a little about how life is so pleasant in the area and Beeman offers Phillip some of his fancy Russian caviar. They eat it with tortilla clips as Beeman starts to explain how he stole the caviar from a guy he ran into while working a case. Phillip says it's salty, and Beeman says, ""That's what the beer is for.""

Phillip sneaks up on Viola on the street, gives her the clock and tells her to put it back and plug it back in. Then her son will be better. She asks him if he worries about God, but Phillip says he worries about Viola and her son, and moving on after this whole thing is done.

Beeman and Amador go back to the electronics store and start to torture him, shoving foam in his mouth and choking him, asking about the woman who came into the store and what she wanted.

Viola brings the clock back to Caspar Weinberger's study and pauses for a moment. Mrs. Weinberger walks by and says hello, and Viola says nothing.

Phillip is outside in his car, checking for sound from his transmitter. Nothing but static. He's not happy.

He comes back and tells Elizabeth that Viola ""made a choice"" and didn't put the clock back. He says they have to assume she's reporting everything. They can't go back to her apartment and Grayson is going to die.

""They'll know it was the KGB,"" Elizabeth says.

""Yeah, that was the risk they took,"" Phillip says. ""They didn't ask us.""

He's relieved that at least they weren't blown. Elizabeth says they have to finish the job. Phillip gets a call with a coded message, which he says is an emergency signal from Annelise.

With other FBI agents watching from a nearby van, Beeman discreetly stands next to the woman from the electronics store at a produce stand. He tells her he's an FBI agent and knows she's stealing fancy caviar and trading it for high-end stereo equipment she's sending back to Russia, where it's probably being sold. He tells her he knows she's probably breaking a bunch of Russian laws and would face time in a Siberian prison if he turns her in. He tells her she works for him now and gives her two chances to nod in agreement. She does.

Phillip picks up Annelise. She says she's tired of doing this and threatens to call the police. He stops the car and tells her she's ""been through a lot"" and what she did the other night was ""fantastic."" She asks him about how he was ready to save her that night, and then fantasizes about escaping to Sweden together. She tells him to just ""say yes"" for that night, even though she knows it's ""not real."" She goes on talking about this, then abruptly gets out of the car and tells Phillip, ""I'll see you later.""

Elizabeth is at Viola's apartment trying to talk her into putting the clock back to save her son. She won't budged. She says she listens to her lord. Phillip says there's been a misunderstanding between her and her lord, and begins to suffocate Grayson, demanding that she promise she'll put the clock back. She screams that she will, swearing to Jesus. Phillip and Elizabeth leave.

The next day, Viola puts the clock back just before Mrs. Weinberger walks in. Phillip, listening from his car, hears the signal clearly. We next see Elizabeth sitting in Viola's apartment, with Grayson shaking on the couch. The phone rings twice, then stops. She gives Grayson the antidote and takes a deep sigh.

That night, Phillip brings Elizabeth the tin of caviar. He asks if she ever had it before and she says, ""No, we couldn't afford this. We were like you, we had no money.""

They sit down and enjoy the caviar. Elizabeth goes on to tell Phillip that had a ""tingle"" earlier, like she knew things were about to go bad. She tells Phillip she saw Henry and Paige and him, then says, ""They shouldn't ask us to do impossible things.""

""No, but we did it,"" he says. ""And tonight, we're in the house of the Secretary of Defense. They must be after something very, very big. Something that changes things.""

A lead FBI agent is on the phone explaining that the last time they had a source inside the KGB was four years ago. He then hands the phone to Beeman, who listens intently and gives many thanks. He notes ""it's a team effort,"" which appeases Amador, who looked slightly annoyed for a moment. Beeman gets off the phone and says ""that was the president."" It was just the chief of staff, ""but still,"" Beeman says.

Elizabeth goes to Paige's room while she's sleeping. She wakes her up. She asks her if she wants to pierce her ears something they'd agreed Paige could do when she was 15.

""You can go to the mall and do it with your friends, or I can do it now,"" Elizabeth says.

Paige considers it for a minute and says, ""You do it.""

Meanwhile, Phillip is sitting beside Henry's bed, watching his son sleep with a tear rolling down his eye.

At the Soviet Embassy, the woman from the electronics store sees Vasili and Arkady congratulating each other over some news. She asks the man sitting next to her what that's about. He says Directorate S had a good night, but has no further details.

Vasili and the other man head to a closed office where Arkady presents the transmitter, turns up the volume and listens in on Defense Minister Nott's conversation with U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Nott says he and the prime minister are supportive of a ballistic missile shield, provided it covers Europe as well as the United States.

""Think what a different world it will be as soon as we don't have to worry about their nuclear missiles,"" Nott says.

""Amen to that,"" Weinberger replies.

Vasili and Arkady don't look so happy any longer."

One of the Russian spies was stabbed and killed. Agent Stan Beeman has also turned a Russian KGB operative after uncovering her bootlegging operation. Beeman lives in the same neighborhood as Philip, one of the Russian spies, and they're becoming friendly  despite Phillip knowing full well that Beeman snooped around his garage one night suspecting him of some kind of wrongdoing.

'Gregory': Beeman is dominating Philip at racquetball, talking about his strategy of making his opponent work too hard until he makes a mistake. Beeman gets a page and has to leave. Philip quips that where he comes from ""if you leave, you lose."" Beeman jokes, ""If that's the way you want to win"" before leaving. Philip says to himself, ""I'll win any way I can.""

Agent Amador briefs Beeman and they head out to an operation. Beeman meets with Nina, the KGB officer he turned. She tells him she overheard that they lost an officer the same night the other turned Russian spy vanished. She says she can help him, ""and one day you will help me."" Beeman agrees. She wants expatriation and safety. He tells her to slow down, vowing to protect her as long as she makes herself ""worth protecting."" She tells Beeman that the operative was stabbed and died at an area hospital. ""He wasn't just any operative,"" she says. ""He was Directorate S.""

Amador and Beeman lead a briefing about the operative's murder. Their director orders them to ask the DMV to review driver's license photos until they find a match.

Philip and his daughter Paige are out to breakfast. He's alarmed at the ""Girls' World"" magazine she's reading. Philip reads something in the classified ads of his newspaper that alarms him. He suddenly wants to leave. They go. Philip is slightly suspicious of a woman who interjected in his conversation with Paige for a moment.

Philip shows Elizabeth the newspaper and says it's a signal from Robert, but Robert has been dead for two weeks. The signal is asking for a meeting in Philadephia. Philip says he'll ""put Gregory on it.""

Elizabeth shows up at a park and interrupts Gregory's chess game. She turns down a cigarette from him, saying she's ""trying to be good.""

The Philadelphia DMV has provided a driver's license match to the FBI. Beeman is on it.

Elizabeth and Gregory go into his apartment to talk. He turns on some music. Elizabeth tells him she needs his team to cover a meet. Gregory starts rubbing Elizabeth's shoulders and kissing her on the neck, but she goes and sits on the couch.

""Can't do this anymore,"" she says, adding that ""things are changing at home with me and Philip.""

He thinks she's ""finally leaving him,"" but she says it's ""the opposite, actually.""

Gregory reminds Elizabeth that Philip is her ""cover,"" but she corrects him and says ""he's my husband.""

Gregory gets up and hands Elizabeth a notepad for her to give him the info to cover the meeting and he'll get it done.

At the corner of Market and Powelton streets in Philly, Gregory looks around and sees, among other things, a woman nervously sitting on a bench while holding a baby. She gets up to leave and some other activity starts. Some cars start moving.

""A wife?"" Philip asks Elizabeth back in their travel agency office. The woman must have been Robert's wife, which no one knew about, and Elizabeth adds that Robert was living in Philadelphia  another thing no one knew about. Philip is nervous.

Gregory reported that an FBI team was tailing her all the way to the park and stayed with her until she left. ""She didn't seem to know about it,"" she says.

They realize they don't know what Robert told his wife about himself or them. They decide they have to talk to her, even if the CIA is all over her. Elizabeth says she'll talk to Gregory.

Beeman gives a briefing about Robert's wife. His boss doesn't want to bring her in right away, thinking that wherever she leads them might be more valuable.

Elizabeth asks Gregory to get Robert's wife by Friday, if possible. He says it's possible, but it's also possible that he and his guys go to prison. Gregory tries to talk Elizabeth out of what he sees as her fake domestic life. She leaves and asks him to get his guys together.

The FBI supervisor leads another briefing, outlining the details: The night Timochev disappeared, Robert died of a stab wound at a local hospital, and three days ago they got confirmation he was a ""deep-cover KGB operative."" A year ago, Robert married Joyce Ana Ramirez, a Puerto Rican woman. They have a baby named Oscar. The FBI doesn't know what she knows. He tells one of the men in the briefing, ""You can tell the attorney general this is the closest we've come to a live KGB on American soil since we got Rudolph Abel in '57.""

Meanwhile, Gregory is following Joyce around Philadelphia. Gregory's men orchestrate a series of distractions, including a purse snatching and the theft of a large van to obscure the FBI's view of Joyce, to allow Gregory to take her into a building and drive her away out the other side.

Elizabeth and Philip get a chance to talk to Joyce, who says that Robert told her to place an ad ""and a friend would come"" if he didn't come home within two weeks. She says Robert told her he could trust them. ""What's going on?"" she asks. ""Where is he, is he dead?""

Philip says yes and Joyce breaks down. She asks if he was dealing drugs. ""Why did he have me call you? Is it money? There's money, right? To take care of us?""

Elizabeth assures her they're going to take care of her, but Philip says they need to know what Robert told her about them and what he did. She says Robert was ""quiet  he didn't say much  I liked that about him."" She pulls a note from her pocket that Robert told her to give them. It has a phone number on it, which she says Robert told her not to call so she didn't.

Philip takes the note into another room, where Gregory is standing. Gregory asks Philip if he loves Elizabeth. Philip is confused by the question and doesn't answer it. Gregory goes on to tell Philip about how he and Elizabeth ""clicked"" when they first met and she recruited him into the KGB and was ready to sacrifice his life and family.

""You don't have a family, do you Gregory?"" Philip says.

Gregory goes on to say that Elizabeth went to his place one month before Paige was born and said she couldn't go back to her life. Philip is mixing together a solution, in which he places the note with the phone number. Gregory goes on to ask Philip again if he loves Elizabeth.

""Because if you don't, leave her be,"" Gregory says. ""And if you do, leave her be.""

Meanwhile, in the water-based solution Philip has made, the note reveals another code of some kind. Philip pulls it out without responding to Gregory's words.

The FBI supervisor and Beeman are stunned that Joyce got away from a full FBI surveillance, and they think she's a Directorate S operative with the skills to make such a move. The supervisor is confident enough that the FBI can track her down again.

Elizabeth asks Philip about the message, it's another name and phone number. Philip asks Elizabeth what she suggests they do, and she says nothing. Gregory suggests they kill her and dump the body before they're blown. Philip decides to take a walk and warns Gregory that if he touches Joyce, he'll kill him.

Philip is out for his walk when he notices the woman from the coffee shop. He grabs her and pushes her against a wall, demanding to know who she is.

""I'm Gabriel's replacement,"" she says.

Philip wants to know what happened to Gabriel, and she says, ""The Center felt it was time for a change."" He tells her to never come near his kids again. She warns him never to put his hands on her again. Philip tells the woman about Robert's wife and the name and phone number he left.

The woman then reveals that the U.S. is working on a new technology that would jeopardize the Soviets' nuclear arsenal at risk. Robert was about to buy intel from an agent and the KGB was looking all over Boston for the agent when Robert died, but it's now clear he was doing his work in Philly. She suggests they call the phone number and set up a meeting.

The TV news is reporting Joyce's disappearance as a kidnapping. She sees this and tells Elizabeth, ""They're hunting me."" Elizabeth assures her they don't know where she is. Joyce is revealing how little she knows by telling Elizabeth how confused she is about all the weird instructions Robert left for her. She then remembers a time when she was out of town but came home early and surprised him. She found him listening to a strange-looking radio device and taking notes. He told her he was doodling, but she doesn't think he was doodling.

""He was a spy,"" she says, turning toward Elizabeth again. ""You're all spies.""

She's worried that Elizabeth is going to kill her and the baby. Elizabeth assures her that Robert would have wanted them to protect her.

Beeman and Amador are back in Philly, retracing Joyce's disappearance. A guy at a shoeshine stand overhears some of their conversation.

Philip prepares for the meeting and tells Elizabeth about ""Granny,"" Gabriel's replacement. He starts to leave and Elizabeth asks, ""Do you want to talk about it?"" Philip asks if she means Gregory. He tells her he didn't realize she was running off on him. Philip is upset that Elizabeth revealed her deepest secrets about her life and their relationship to Gregory and angrily says he'll go on pretending their domestic life is intact but she should go ahead and see Gregory whenever she needs to.

Philip shows up for the meeting and three men surround him and frisk him. He's escorted down a hall in a rundown building. He's guided into a cage-like room where he meets the guy he's presumably supposed to talk to.

""You got it?"" the man asks.

Philip says yes, but asks the man's guards to stay out of his ""blind spot"" behind him. They keep getting closer  almost intentionally messing with him, it seems  and Philip turns and takes them both out with some sneaky kicks and a couple of bashes to the gut with the briefcase, from which money billows after it pops open.

The man doesn't stand up from his seat, and Philip says, ""I did warn them, twice.""

""You did,"" the man says.

""You want to start a war, or do you want to give me what I came for an keep all this cash?"" Philip says.

The man calls for a woman to bring another briefcase. Philip, meanwhile, notices he's been cut a little in the stomach but covers it up. He opens the briefcase and reveals classified schematics for a nuclear X laser anti-ballistic missile ray. The man tells Philip he doesn't know what it is, ""I just made the deal."" Philip takes it and leaves.

Gregory is still worried about Joyce sticking around, but Elizabeth tells her she hasn't made a decision. He says she's making an emotional decision. Elizabeth slaps Gregory and asks why he told Philip about them. She wants to know whether it was to hurt Philip or get back at her.

""I was just trying to do right by you,"" Gregory says. ""I love you.""

He leaves and says, ""You want to be married to him, fine. But if you're going to do it, you can't do it on a lie.""

Beeman and Amador are still in Philly trying to figure out how Joyce got away. They look at the van that was used to shield the FBI surveillance team. Beeman crouches to tie his shoe and sees someone standing on the other side of the van. The man runs and Beeman and Amador give chase but lose him. Beeman can only wonder, ""What does some guy in the hood care about a KGB spy?""

Philip and Elizabeth drive Joyce to a dirt road to hand her off to Claudia, their new boss. Elizabeth tells her that ""they have passports, new names, it's all set."" Joyce thanks her.

Claudia tells Joyce she'll ""thrive"" in Cuba. Joyce gets in the black van and Claudia shuts it. She turns and takes the briefcase from Philip. Claudia gets back in the van and it drives away. Philip is still holding his stomach where he was cut. He turns silently and gets back in the car. Elizabeth stays behind for a moment, then goes to the car herself.

The next morning, Philip and Elizabeth are in the kitchen and she asks him if he's OK. He says he's fine and says nothing else. He puts an ice pack on his wound and sits at the kitchen table.

""I was 17 when I joined the KGB,"" Elizabeth starts to say. ""Never had a boyfriend. They put me with you, we didn't know each other. When we got here, I was 22 years old. I was living in a strange house in a strange country with a strange man, and I met Gregory and he was passionate about the cause; he was passionate about everything. He was passionate about me.""

She goes on to talk about how she recruited him, ""and he didn't even want anything  he just believed, like I did. He was the first person I felt like I could really talk to, and I needed that."" She's crying a bit as she talks and says, ""It just happened. It never really happened that way for us, did it?""

""No,"" Philip agrees.

Elizabeth says she's sorry and that she wishes it had. She holds his hand and says, ""But I feel like it's happening now.""

Back in Donestk, Soviet Union, a Russian agent tells a Robert's parents their son was a hero and would be proud to have his baby back home where he belongs. The baby is laying on the table in front of them but there is no sign of Joyce.

Beeman, meanwhile, is at a crime scene and finds Joyce's dead body slumped in the driver's seat of a car with a needle in her hand and a rubber tube tied around her arm."

Philip planted a bug in the home of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Soviet agents heard Weinberger talking about U.S. plans to coordinate with Britain on a nuclear missile defense system. FBI Agent Stan Beeman turned a woman within the Soviet Rezidentura who is now providing him intel. Elizabeth revealed to Philip that she was so young when she started her spy work that they never really formed their relationship, but she feels like ""it's happening now.""

'In Control': News reports talk about Russian military exercises that are being seen as threatening. After rushing the kids off to school, Elizabeth asks Philip if they're ""still on for"" without finishing her sentence. He says yes.

At the FBI, the supervisor, Agent Gaad, tells Beeman and Amador about customs agents stopping the son of the Romanian Deputy Chief of Mission on his way back to Bucharest with three pounds of marijuana. He's going to be brought to the FBI. Gaad wants Beeman and Amador to ""take a run at him"" and see what he'll offer to stay out of trouble back home, or, as he puts it, ""See if he wants to keep his balls.""

Elizabeth is in a hotel room when Philip knocks on the door. They say nothing as he walks in and they start to kiss. Apparently, it really is ""happening now.""

Amador is quizzing Beeman with flash cards on his Russian, but everything stops when Gaad delivers news that President Reagan has been shot. The agents all head into ""the vault.""

After their little afternoon delight, Philip thanks Elizabeth for suggesting they take the afternoon off.

News reports show the shooting of Reagan and Gaad wants to know immediately if the KGB was behind it. The director tells Beeman he wants agents at the embassy, but not him.

Philip and Elizabeth are leaving the hotel when they first hear reports of Reagan's shooting. They head off to find out what they can.

Back at the FBI, Gaad continues to demand for any connection between Hinkley, the shooter, and the KGB or the Communist Party. He then asks Beeman to check with his contact. Beeman says he has a signal that can get him in touch with her within 24 hours, but Gaad wants action faster.

Philip meets with a journalist friend, Sparrow, who says he has ""no access at all."" Philip asks for the names of the nurses who were around the president. The journalist who has been identifying himself as a former Socialist turned conservative tells Philip he hopes Reagan dies on the operating table. Philip tells him his ""commitment to the struggle always was total.""

Elizabeth meets with Claudia as the radio news reports Jim Brady's death from the shooting. Claudia says there is no time for signals today and tells Elizabeth she needs to gather her supplies for ""Operation: Christopher."" Claudia says she's heard so much about Elizabeth and that they'll do ""great things together,"" but she didn't expect it to start this way. Elizbaeth asks Claudia, ""Did we do this?"" Claudia doesn't think so, but says ""they'll try to pin it on us."" She also mentions that the Red Army might move into Poland in the next 24 hours. Elizabeth mentions ""Operation: Christopher"" and asks if this is ""headed toward guerrilla warfare."" Claudia hopes not, but needs Elizabeth to find out how the president is doing and about attempts to blame the Russians. She says the Rezidentura will be ""worthless."" Elizabeth says they'll start preparations for ""Christopher"" right away. Claudia tells Elizabeth she'll ""do well"" if she falls behind enemy lines.

Things are buzzing at the Rezidentura and Beeman calls his contact, Nina, and she asks if they can discuss the next day. He says there's a deadline.

Elizabeth is in an isolated area, digging up a large crate. In a flashback, we see a similar crate in her house as her mother and a man lament the passing of Stalin. The man is courting Elizabeth's mother, saying she and her daughter (""Nadezhda"") will need ""help"" ""every woman needs a man,"" he says and offers some supplies that are in the crate from the committee storehouse. Elizabeth's mother thanks him, but declines the offer and says they can manage on their own. Back with Elizabeth and the crate, she clips some wires it was set to explode in the wrong hands before opening it. She pulls out some serious weaponry and more explosives.

A man in a basement with a table full of telephones gets a call from Philip, who identifies himself as ""Steve."" He says he needs the vice president's office deputy chiefs of staff. The man says he can set up the line in 15 minutes and Philip will call back.

News reports about Reagan continues to show up on TVs as Beeman and Amador wait for sign of Nina from a window across the street. She gets up to leave, but her boss orders her to sit in on a meeting.

Elizabeth is back and Philip says he has names. She says she got orders to be ready for Operation: Christopher, adding, ""This could be a coup."" She shows him all the artillery in the trunk of the car. He says they'll need a car and she says she'll signal Gregory.

Inside the house, Paige is bothered by the news showing the shooting over and over again. She thinks it's ""ghoulish."" Matthew Beeman Stan's teenage son is sitting with her and says it's ""pretty ghoulish"" that anyone who was shot in the incident could die.

One of Gregory's men brings Philip and Elizabeth a Lincoln Town Car with U.S. government license plates. He says he needs it back in a couple of hours. They drive away.

Nina is still in her office looking for a chance to get away and tells her boss, Vasili, she's headed to a bar with Congressional aides hang out, just in case she can pick up any info. He says that's a great idea and asks her to report back to him directly when she's back. ""Moscow needs us to be ahead of the curve,"" he says. After she leaves, Vasili asks another man in the office to follow her.

Philip and Elizabeth see a woman named Dana Simon arrive at her home. They present themselves as deputy chiefs of staff for the vice president's office. They thank her for everything she did that day. They tell her this crisis is ""about as political as a crisis can get."" She says they're quietly checking with everyone to make sure what they're hearing about the president's condition is true. She says he's going to pull through. They thank her and ask her to keep their meeting confidential. They give her a business card with a phone number where they can be reached, and Philip gives her a collectable pin from the vice president's office.

It's dark now, but Beeman sees Nina pull up in a cab. He heads outside while Amador keeps watch from the window. Amador sees the car apparently following Nina and prepares to say something. Beeman notices it, too, and walks by Nina without stopping or saying anything. Amador, too, said nothing.

Elizabeth and Philip are delivering a message in code saying that their hospital source is confirming Reagan's condition is stable. Elizabeth insists they check for confirmation that no one is taking over the government. Philip is a little annoyed, thinking Moscow is overreacting.

Inside the bar, Nina is overhearing Congressional aides talking about the line of succession if Reagan were to die.

Paige goes to Matthew's house and tells her she's sorry for what she'd said earlier. She says she's noticed it's ""horrible"" that the Secret Service agent (Timothy McCarthy) turned in front of the bullet. She says it made her think about the job his dad does as an FBI agent. She says her dad is just a travel agent. They make some sarcastic comments about how the world of a travel agent can be ""filled with peril.""

Philip and Elizabeth are set up outside Weinberger's house, with Philip setting up to take a shot at him with a sniper rifle. A neighborhood security guard notices the van and says he needs to call the cops in to assist in searching their van because there's been a rash of break ins. He goes back to his car and Elizabeth calmly walks up next him and shoots him in the head with a silencer. She gets in his security patrol car and drives away. Philip follows in the van.

Philip worries that if there is a war, they might have just fired the first shot. They argue over who ""started it."" Philip says they are the ones escalating things.

Nina walks around outside and slips into Beeman's car. She tells Beeman he can't call her at the embassy. She thinks she'll be killed. He assures her he called from a secure line and isn't being followed. She says she knows nothing about the assassination attempt, but ""everyone was freaking out, while running around like cut-off chickens."" He corrects her on the phrase and then has to assure her he doesn't think it's a joke. She says the Russians are worried the U.S. is trying to pin the shooting on them ""to justify the coup."" They think that Gen. Alexander Haig's announcement that he was in charge of the government until the vice president returned was a coup. Beeman says that's not what happened.

""Both sides have their finger on the trigger, and that's how that happens,"" Nina says.

""How what happens?"" Beeman asks.

""One mistake,"" she says. ""That's all it takes.""

Philip and Elizabeth are listening to the tap from Weinberger's office. There isn't much useful at first, but then they hear some chatter about the nuclear football. Elizabeth says they need to get it to Moscow, but Philip wants to check it out first. She wants to move on it immediately, but Philip tries to assure her that there is no coup in the works. He tells her she still doesn't know how things work in the U.S. She accuses him of having forgotten where he came from.

Beeman tells Gaad that his source says the Russians had nothing to do with the shooting. There's some tension, suddenly, between Beeman and Amador, and Amador reveals that he saw the follow car behind Nina but didn't say anything because there was a glare and he couldn't see the occupants' faces. Beeman tells him next time just tell him there's glare and he'll ""act accordingly.""

Philip and Paige watch the news and ""Charles Duluth,"" the journalist Philip had spoken to earlier and Elizabeth had referred to as Sparrow, is on talking about how concerned ""we"" (conservatives) are about Reagan, ""for the implications of his recovery on the world stage."" Elizabeth notices that Beeman is home across the street and suggests they go over and ""see how they got through the day.""

They go over to the Beemans' house and talk it over. Beeman immediately recalls how he reacted when Kennedy was shot and Elizabeth quickly chimes in, saying, ""Yeah, nothing really felt safe after that."" Elizabeth asks Beeman if he thinks ""it's going to all be alright."" Beeman says it'll be fine and adds that Hinkley is ""100 percent nuts,"" adding that Hinkley was trying ""impress this movie star, Jodie Foster."" Beeman tells them they had to investigate whether the Russians were involved but it looks like they weren't, ""which is a good thing because that could've started World War III."" Philip and Elizabeth nod and agree, ""Yeah.""

We next see Philip out in the wilderness tapping out a code that an FBI source confirms Hinkley acted alone and that the U.S. government won't blame the U.S.S.R. for the shooting. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is in bed alone and flashes back to her life in Russia as a child after the man with the crate left. She insists that he was trying to help them, but her mother says he wanted something from them.

""What did he want?"" Elizabeth asked her mother, who doesn't respond to the question but tells her young daughter that she has to rely on only herself in this world, no one else.

Back at the Beemans' house, Stan's wife is quiet but says ""never mind"" when he asks what's going on. She says it feels petty to think about this sort of thing, then admits she was happy when they lived in St. Louis. She says they made a good life while he was out on his assignment, but she thought they would get to know each other again now that he's back. She tells him he never talks to her and asks why it's so hard.

""I don't know,"" he says, adding that he was ""living with psycho-militants for too long."" He says ""it just doesn't feel like it did before."" He says he's trying.

Philip gets home and finds Elizabeth in bed awake. She tells him she's glad they did it his way this time, and that ""the center was lucky to have you on the ground today."" Philip says that if Moscow ever finds out they sat on the Haig intelligence, ""we're finished.""

She hugs him and says, ""I won't tell if you won't.""

They kiss and fall into bed together."

Claudia told Phillip that the Americans are trying to build a defense system that would wipe out Russia's nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Phillip are trying to start give their relationship the real start they never had.

'Comint': Elizabeth shows up at a man's house posing as a security company inspector. She tells the man the Department of Defense mandated a security review of all private contractors. She says she wanted to wait out of respect and says she's ""very sorry"" about his wife. He reports his name, Adam Dorwin, manager of Vizio Tech Laser Operations Group. He has top-secret clearance. She asks if he's received any communications from foreign agents and proceeds with questions. He says his contacts in the DoD are ""trustworthy idiots."" In the 35 years and eight months he was married to his wife, he says she never asked a single question about the classified work he did.

Elizabeth meets with Claudia in the car on a rainy night. Elizabeth says she could've cracked him in 30 seconds and that ""he needs his handler now, face to face, or we're going to lose him."" Claudia says the handler has left four signals ""for him"" in the last week. She says there's been no meeting because everyone's locked up in the Rezidentura and that because the FBI surveillance teams are using new encryption on their radios, the Russian agents can't tell when they're being followed, so there's no way to meet an agent. Elizabeth offers to go explain the situation. Claudia says that's not how the Russians operate. The CIA lets agents' handlers switch in an out and ""there's no real bond."" Claudia tells her about an agent she once ran in West Germany a loner oddball who never really learned to make a friend. She befriended him and many years later, as she was leaving, they didn't need him any more. She explained it all to him, he thanked her for the opportunity to work with her, and killed himself shortly after.

""We didn't need him anymore, but he needed us,"" Claudia says.

Claudia tells Elizabeth they can't lose Agent Udacha and she must find a way to get the FBI's encryption codes so the contact can meet with the one man he trusts.

Dorwin calls Vasili from a pay phone. Vasili says he shouldn't be calling him there but promises they'll meet soon. Dorwin hangs up and leaves.

Elizabeth crosses paths with Beeman and Phillip while driving into the office. They're are on their way back from racquetball. They're pretty chummy, which seems to make Elizabeth a little uneasy. Beeman says he can give Phillip a ride to the office.

At the Rezidentura, Vasili helps show ""Ninotchka"" (Nina) the proper way to brew her tea. He says shortcuts ""are the root of all evil."" His approach takes longer, but he says the tea will taste better, that ""waiting is a lost art."" He urges her to try it his way from the start next time.

Agent Amador laments that Martha, a woman he dated in the office for a couple of months, never wore sexy shoes when she was with him. Now she's sporting heels. Agent Gaad comes up with a transcript of Dorwin's conversation from the phone booth with Vasili, but they don't know who was on either end of the line. All they know is that one man said: ""I feel like I'm standing on a diving board at the edge of an empty pool"". Gaad says he smells an opportunity. Amador compliments Martha's shoes when she comes over to deliver a message to Gaad. She says that's sexism and Gaad agrees. He rolls his eyes when she walks away.

Beeman talks with Nina. He tries to convince her that he's on her side and she should think of him as a wall that's protecting her. He asks her to find out what's going on quickly and that they don't have any leeway. He tells her she's beautiful and smart and capable and beautiful again. He tries to say ""trust me"" in Russian, but she tells him that the way he's saying it makes it sound like she has no choice.

Martha is at home and Phillip is there, posing as ""Clark,"" the counterintelligence guy she's seeing. Martha seems quiet and Phillip leans in to kiss her. He says he's been wanting to do that ""for a very long time"" and wishes things were different with them. He says they can't trespass any boundaries, because he has to protect the nation's counterintelligence efforts. He compliments her shoes and she says they're new. He tells her he's worried about the FBI's surveillance. He's ""concerned the company wasn't properly vetted."" He gets her to reveal the name of the consultant, Kurt Schultz.

At the Soviet Embassy, Vasili and Arkady are talking about how they can't lose Agent Udacha. They agree that if the FBI gets to Udacha before he can, they'll lose everything. Arkady says Udacha will take the whole network with him. Vasili says he can't meet him until he can get the FBI off his back.

At home that night, Elizabeth chides Phillip for playing too much racquetball with his ""new best friends"" and says he should keep his distance. He asks what is going with the encryption guy. She says her plan is to pose as a rival looking for a job.

We next see her having sex with a man presumably Kurt Schultz in a hotel room while asking if this means she and her boss can buy his company. He finishes quickly, but proceeds to spank Elizabeth a few times before pulling out a belt and using it. She tells him it hurts and he says it's supposed to. She rolls off the bed and curls up in a ball asking him to stop and just as he's about to use the buckle end of the belt she screams and cries, ""Don't hurt me!"" He stops and tries to quiet her down. She gets up to get dressed.

Nina brings some tea to Vasili in his office and says she took his advice. She closes the door behind her and starts to take off her blouse.

""Why? Why now?"" he asks her.

""I think we're both a little lonely,"" she says.

Elizabeth tells Schultz that if her boss knew what he was into he wouldn't want to buy his company. Schultz claims the price $3 million is too low anyway. She says she knows what it's worth. He says ""there are things that aren't in the paperwork, try $30 (million)."" He mentions the classified work his company does, and goes on to say he's figured out how to make a signal cloaking system portable.

""Portable?"" she asks.

""Small enough to fit in the trunk of an FBI car,"" he says. ""Wherever they go, it goes with them. Thirty million, not a penny less.""

Nina is buttoning her blouse and Vasili thanks her for her ""kindness in a difficult time."" She says ""that's what difficult times call for."" She goes on to ask him if he's alright, noting that she'd heard something the other day.

His response is to ask her if she knows what loyalty is. He tells her about an agent he recruited there 23 years earlier. He says the man was ""a bureaucrat with a soul"". He says the man now has ""jitters"" and mimics jitters to explains what they are. He plans to reassure him everything will be fine. She asks him if it will. Vasili turns and tells her he hopes they'll be able to meet again.

Elizabeth gets home and tells Phillip she ""got it."" She takes off her shirt and the belt marks are visible all over her back. He asks what happened and she says ""nothing.""

""It happens sometimes, Phillip,"" she says.

Phillip vows to ""deal with it,"" but Elizabeth says she could have dealt with it herself. ""I wanted the intel and I got it,"" she adds. Philip says he'll be back in an hour. She tells him she doesn't need him to fight her battles for her. He gets a gun and heads out of the house, but she stops him by saying, ""You are not my daddy.""

He tells her he's her ""husband, what do you think husbands do?""

""I wouldn't know,"" she says.

The next morning, Phillip is agitated and being short with Henry for losing his thermos.

Nina reports back to Beeman about Vasili's plans to meet with the agent who has ""jitters."" Beeman asks how she got Vasili to talk and she says in more colorful terms she gave him oral sex ""just like you told me to"". Beeman stammers to clarify that's not what he said and that he ""wouldn't."" The horn of a passing train is the only thing that breaks the silence for a moment. Beeman tells her she'll live a new life one day and will have a new name. He wants her to choose the name of someone who sleeps very well at night. He says ""we have to nail down when that meeting is happening.""

""We?"" she asks.

Elizabeth reports to Claudia about the surveillance systems in the FBI cars. Claudia asks Elizabeth if everything is OK. She says yes, but it's been a tough couple of days. They have a conversation about female empowerment, based on the equal rights laws being considered in the U.S. Claudia says that she and Elizabeth have already known for years that they have to fight for their equality instead of waiting for the laws to change. Claudia says she'll get Elizabeth some info on the FBI cars, but they keep their vehicles under very close guard. Elizabeth says they'll figure it out.

The next day, Elizabeth and Phillip are driving and Elizabeth says the second car behind them is the FBI. Phillip asks Elizabeth if she's going to be mad forever. She say she's not mad and ""at least I'm not tormenting little boys about lost thermoses."" Phillip slams the brakes on the car in order to get the car behind him to stop short and the FBI car to crash into it. Phillip drives off while the FBI agents have to apologize to an elderly woman for rear-ending her.

We next see the FBI car in the shop. Phillip tells Elizabeth where the car is and says he'll distract some of the mechanics while she gets something from the FBI car. He distracts while she climbs into the trunk of the FBI car, which is on a lift. She slips an encryption card out of the portable security device and makes an imprint of it. She's about to get out of the car when it starts moving down the lift. Phillip sees it coming down. The FBI agents are told their car is ready and they start to head toward it. Phillip tries to think quickly. He goes to get his car but the mechanic says he needs to keep it overnight. Phillip tells him he needs it now as the FBI agents are already driving away.

The FBI agents drive back to FBI headquarters with Elizabeth still in the trunk. They park and leave the car in the lot.

We see Phillip pull over on the side of the road and check his trunk. Elizabeth is not there.

In the FBI parking lot, Elizabeth gets out of the trunk and starts walking around unnoticed. She walks right through the gates, giving a ""see ya"" and confident wave to the guards as she leaves.

Phillip is waiting for her with coffee and a donut. He apologizes about their argument. She says they have to do all sorts of things for their work, ""and it requires being a certain way."" He asks her what she's talking about. She says that she wishes each night that she'll ""wake up and not be worried."" He asks about what and she says, ""Everything.""

""You can't live like that,"" he says.

""Show me another way,"" she replies.

Beeman is listening to Russian language lessons on tape at home. His wife asks if he's coming to bed. She's wearing a new negligee. He says, ""Oh, you're killing me"", and continues to listen to his tapes. She reminds him about all the fun and sometimes romantic things they used to do before his assignment away. She tells him life was ""pretty freaking great, remember?"" He says he does, and says he won't be that long with the tapes. She goes to bed.

Vasili is in his office again, with Nina doing her thing under the desk. Arkady bursts in, doesn't see Nina, and tells Vasili that they got the encryption codes. He tells Arkady to signal Udacha for a meet the next day at 14:00. Arkady leaves. Vasili sighs.

The next day, Nina waits for Beeman at a random spot on the street. He pulls up and she tells him the KGB has the FBI's encryption code and the meeting with the agent is happening at 2 p.m. He thanks her and speeds away.

Gaad calls out to Amador to get his teams ready, and he goes to another agent to tell him to get the codes in the trunk units changed.

Vasili is worried now at the Embassy, saying that they've lost all the FBI communications, it's all static. Arkady suggests they've changed the code. Now they're worried Udacha will go off the deep end, but Arkady warns Vasili that he could be leading the FBI to Udacha himself, if he goes through with the meeting.

""We have no choice,"" Vasili says.

Amador and Beeman are staking things out. They talk about relationships for a moment until they see Vasili walking around the corner. They get out to follow him. We also see Udacha who we know as Dorwin walking with a briefcase, apparently toward a meeting. They follow Vasili, who goes and stands at the waterfront along the banks for the Potomac. He's just ""gazing,"" as Beeman puts it. Vasili checks his watch.

We see Dorwin/Udacha standing somewhere, also checking his watch. He turns and starts to ask, ""Did my friend send you?"" He's cut off by a bullet in the head, which Elizabeth fires.

Vasili looks as some birds fly through the sky. His sad look means something isn't right, and the look on Beeman's face, who is watching Vasili from afar makes it fairly clear he knows, too. We see Elizabeth walk away.

Phillip meets with Claudia on the street that night. She tells him about the FBI changing their encryption codes right away within the day, ""like they knew."" They understand they have a mole.

Vasili is angry with Arkady for having cabled Moscow without his permission. Arkady says there is a mole and the center demands they use ""any and all measure to catch them."" He says that's exactly what they're going to do.

Phillip gets home and finds Elizabeth asleep. She quietly asks, ""What had she say?""

""Don't worry about it,"" Phillip says. ""I'll tell you in the morning."""

Meanwhile, Agent Stan Beeman turned a Russian worker in the Rezidentura, Nina, into an informant by threatening to reveal her black-market dealings. She got her boss to reveal information to her by giving him oral sex, and told Beeman that he ""told"" her to. He insists she misunderstood. Phillip's FBI counterintelligence source told him ""they were in the secure vault all day,"" but she didn't know what was happening there. The Russian spies got the FBI's communication encryption codes, but they were changed immediately, which led Claudia to believe there is a mole.

'Trust Me': Phillip and Elizabeth are concerned about the mole, wondering how it could happen. Elizabeth gives Phillip a big kiss before leaving to take the kids to the mall.

Phillip calls his FBI source and flirts with her and tells her he'd like to see her some time, socially. She says she has to work. It's a Sunday. He insists she can be a half hour late.

""Great,"" he says. As soon as he hangs up the phone, four men sneak up behind the phone booth he's in and put a hood over his head before tossing him into the back of a van. The van takes off.

Phillip is in a chair in a big, empty warehouse space. A man approaches and tells him all the vital facts of his own life. Phillip seems to realize the jig is up. The man says the details of Phillip's life before 1963 ""seem to be a little bit hazy.""

""We know who you are and what you are, Mr. Jennings,"" he says, leaning into Phillip's face now.

Meanwhile, Nina is putting her clothes on while Vasili is still in bed. He urges her to come back and lay with him, telling her she's his ""medicine."" She says he's been under a lot of stress lately and he says ""it's a dark time"" and adds that the Rezidentura has been penetrated. She gets up and and asks if he's sure. She lays down again, not facing him as he tells her that it's his fault and she tries to convince him otherwise. He says they'll ""find this traitor and put a bullet in his head. It's only a matter of time.""

At the FBI, Agent Gaad calls Beeman in on Sunday and asks for his take on something. Gaad hands Beeman a file. It's the file on Dorwin's killing  about two miles from where the FBI was following Vasili. Gaad tells Beeman about the missile defense program  he doesn't have more details  but Dorwin was project manager for Viziotech, which was working on the missile technology. A month ago, some top-secret blueprints disappeared. Beeman realizes Dorwin was shot at the exact same time the FBI was tracking the Rezident (Vasili).

Elizabeth is at home, cutting onions, when she thinks she hears something and starts to walk around the house suspiciously  with the knife in her hand. She's in her bedroom when a man about three times her size sneaks up from behind and grabs her. Elizabeth works some serious close-combat skills and frees herself by slamming him against the wall, now in the hallway near the stairs. She then busts out some serious punches, elbows and kicks to knock him out. She turns, takes one breath and next sees the bottom of a lamp or vase striking her in the face before everything goes black.

Paige and Henry are waiting for Elizabeth to pick them up. She's an hour late. Paige calls home and there's no answer. They start walking and Paige hitchhikes. Henry says they aren't supposed to hitchhike.

Nina meets with Beeman in his car and tells him she's done because they're looking for a mole and are going to kill her. He tells her to trust him.

Phillip is getting beaten with a phone book and the man questioning him wants a list of every KGB agent he knows. Then he wants to know all the dead-drop sites and KGB communication protocols.

""It's up to you how long we do this,"" the man says.

Phillip insists he's not a spy. The man goes to a tape player and plays a recording of Phillip talking to his FBI source. The man shows Phillip the many different passports Phillip has, and start to talk about the kids, who are technically American citizens. He suggests that maybe the kids will become wards of the United States government. The man turns and says, ""Bring her in!"" Elizabeth is pulled into the room.

A guy stops and offers Paige and Henry a ride. Henry first shakes his head, but Paige eventually coaxes Henry into the car. The young man introduces himself as Nick. Henry doesn't want to shake the guy's hand.

Elizabeth is thrown into a small room that has pictures of Henry and Paige taped to all the walls.

Gaad tells Beeman that the ""dead guy"" (Dorwin) has high-security access. Gaad wants to know what Beeman's friend (Nina) has said about Dorwin. Beeman tells Gaad that Nina is in trouble. Gaad reminds Beeman that these are dangerous operations. Beeman asks for access to some of the jewels seized in a recent bust.

Nick, the driver, says he wants to make a quick stop. He hands Paige a bag of bread. Nick says it's ""for the ducks""  he always feeds them on his way to work.

Phillip is being dunked into a tank of water now, but refuses to talk. The man questioning him leaves to get Elizabeth. She refuses to get up, so two other men carry her out of the room.

Nick stops to feed the ducks, but Paige says they need to get home. Nick grabs a six pack of beer and they walk to the edge of a pond. Nick hands Paige a beer and she takes a sip, not liking it. Nick then hands Henry the bag of bread so he can feed the ducks. Nick tells Paige she's ""definitely going to be a knockout in a couple of years."" He tells the kids it's dangerous to hitchhike and they're lucky they ran into him ""and not some lunatic."" They start to leave and Nick shouts at them to stay. They stop. Nick tells Henry to grab him another beer. Henry goes to get one and Nick starts talking about how he wished he had someone to keep him on the straight and narrow, and begins to talk about God. Henry notices a knife in Nick's waistband and smashes the beer bottle over Nick's head. Henry and Paige run away.

Beeman and Nina meet and he hands her a camera, asking her to photograph documents at the Rezidentura  it doesn't matter what they are, as long as they're classified. He tells her this is the plan, but she thinks it's suicide. He tells her he's been where she is, knows the fear she's experiencing. He says he can get her out, but she has to stay with him. He convinces her she won't be caught. She says that even if she can take the pictures, she won't be able to sneak them out because of tight security. He says she won't have to.

Elizabeth is brought to a chair where she's now sitting across from Phillip. The man questioning him says Phillip can help Elizabeth and ""save her a lot of pain.""

""What do you think you're going to get from us?"" Phillip asks.

The man, suddenly interested in Phillip speaking, asks Phillip what his answer to that question would be. Phillip says, ""Nothing."" He says they'll get nothing and that both he and Elizabeth are trained for this.

""We'll die before we talk,"" Elizabeth says.

""And we know how to do that,"" Phillip says.

Suddenly, Claudia's voice calls out, ""That's enough.""

She walks into the room and orders the men to untie them both. She says, ""I'm sorry. We had to know if you were the mole, if we could trust you.""

Phillip is angry. He tells Claudia they should be the last people who should be suspected. Claudia says they had to know. Elizabeth asks if Claudia had permission for this, if Zhukov knew about it.

""This decision was made far above Zhukov's head,"" Claudia says.

Elizabeth elbows Claudia in the stomach. Phillip quickly grabs his questioner's gun and pushes him to the ground while Elizabeth dunks Claudia's head into the water. Phillip shouts, ""That's enough!""

Elizabeth throws Claudia to the ground and starts punching her face repeatedly, leaving it severely swollen and bruised, and yelling that she's going to kill her. She shouts at Claudia, ""Tell whoever approved this that your face is a present from me to them!""

Phillip pulls Elizabeth off and demands his car from the guy who was questioning him  still pointing the man's own gun at him. He tells the man to sit down and gives Elizabeth some rope. She ties the man to the chair.

Phillip and Elizabeth leave the warehouse, wondering ""how could they do that to us."" Phillip asks what they did to her and she says it was just psychological pressure, ""pictures of the kids.""

""They stopped?"" Phillip asks, suggesting that Elizabeth told the interrogators that he was considering defecting. She insists she didn't. He thinks she's lying. She stammers a bit and finally says, ""I told them that you liked it here too much.""

Phillip walks away, but Elizabeth yells at him, telling him not to act like she made it up. He yells back that he ""fit in, like I was supposed to."" He says he liked, ""so what?"" He says he was supposed to be able to trust her and he did, and he shouldn't have. She says that's not true. He walks away.

Paige and Henry get home to a dark, empty house. Henry is down and wonders, ""What if he wasn't going to do anything bad to us?"" Paige says Nick was a creep and what Henry did took courage. Henry says he was scared, and Paige says what happened has to be their secret. Henry still looks worries and sheepish, and admits he ""had an accident,"" looking down at his pants.

Nina is inside the embassy when she goes to a file cabinet to get some classified files. She tucks them into her jacket and goes into the restroom to snap pictures. She brings the file back and a man sneaks up behind her and asks if she's alright. She says yes and he walks away.

Phillip and Elizabeth drive home in silence. Phillip puts on his seat belt, veers off the road on purpose and smashes into a tree. He and Elizabeth both get out of the car without saying anything and stare at the damage.

Vasili buys some tea and the cashier seems to accidentally drop his change on the floor. Vasili bends down to pick up the coins while the man apologizes. While Vasili isn't looking, the cashier drops something extra into Vasili's bag and says, ""Enjoy!"" as Vasili leaves. After Vasili walks out, the cashier calls Beeman and says, ""It's done.""

Beeman calls the embassy which his call routed through a phone booth and asks for Vasili. When the man who answers  the same man who'd snuck up on Nina  asks to take a message, Beeman says to tell Vasili there is a tea shop in Picadilly Circus ""that I know he'll enjoy when he's not under the gun."" Beeman says to tell him the message is from Theo and says, ""He'll know,"" when asked about Theo's last name.

Nina goes and knocks on Vasili's door, and he lets her in.

Phillip and Elizabeth get home and, to explain their scrapes and bruises, tell them they were in a car accident. Henry tells them their friend Shelley's mom drove them home. Phillip gets the kids off to bed.

Phillip tells Elizabeth he's going to go see Martha, his FBI contact, and wants to make up for missing the date. He asks her if she has any jewelry he can give her. Elizabeth goes to her dresser and retrieves something in a box. Based on their silent exchange, it was obviously something that was supposed to have been meaningful between them.

""I'm sure she'll love it,"" Elizabeth says. Phillip scoffs and leaves.

Beeman calls the Soviet embassy again and asks for Vasili again, saying it's urgent. Vasili, meanwhile, is having sex with Nina. The man who answers says that he can't help unless ""Theo"" gives him more information.

Elizabeth meets up with Gregory and asks him to watch her children and Phillip. He asks her what's going on and she explains that there's a mole and she needs to know if she's being watched. He says he'll be her eyes.

Vasili meets with Arkady and they discuss the odd messages from ""Theo,"" which came from three different locations, including a phone booth outside FBI headquarters. Vasili insists he didn't understand any of them. Arkady says they'll need to ""do a light search,"" and Vasili says he understands and would do the same. Arkady calls in a man to help with the search. He asks Vasili to empty his pockets, which he does. Arkady sees the tea bag on Vasili's desk and the other man opens it and pours the tea onto the desk. Hidden in the tea are jewels. Vasili says he doesn't know where they came from.

A deeper search ensues and Vasili defends his spotless record. Arkady says all will be fine if the search turns up nothing. Then, one of the men searching the place discovers a clock with a camera hidden in the back. It's the same camera Nina was using. Arkady holds up the camera and says, ""Diamonds for information."" Vasili smiles and says he's been set up.

""Remarkably well, wouldn't you say?"" Arkady says, and Vasili's face turns cold.

Nina heads up the stairs and sees Vasili being escorted out by two guards. She says nothing.

Gaad calls Beeman at home that night and says the Rezident ""jumped ship"" and is headed back to Russia.

""Just him?"" Beeman asks.

""Just him,"" Gaad confirms. Beeman says he appreciates the call and Gaad says, ""I thought you might.""

Beeman's wife asks if everything is OK, and Beeman says everything is good. She starts to ask him if there's anything he can share with her about his work, even about his boss getting on his nerves or his partner thinking he's funny.

Beeman tells her that sometimes what he does gets scary  not for him  but he has to worry about people, ""and today it got pretty scary, but it worked out."" He say sit was a tough day, but it was a good day. She says she's glad. They kiss and Beeman turns out the light. His wife nestles her head on his chest while he stares off, thinking about Nina.

Phillip tells Martha about his car accident. She kisses him. She asks him if there's someone else who can work with her so that they can be together. He says that's not possible, but he wants to give her something so she'll know how he feels. He pulls out the box and we see its a necklace with a diamond heart pendant, which he places around her neck.

Phillip gets home and tells Elizabeth that Martha ""got over it."" She asks what he wants from her and he says ""it doesn't matter you already did it, there's no undoing it."" She tells him he's not the only one who got hurt that day. She was ripped from her house and attacked ""by the people I believed in - the people I trusted most my whole life.""

""Yeah, I think that says it all,"" Phillip says, slamming the bedroom door shut as he goes to sleep on the couch."

Agent Beeman had sex with Nina, his Rezidentura mole, and wants to get her exfiltrated. Agent Gaad says he'll ""think about it."" Phillip, meanwhile, reconnected and had sex with Irina, his girlfriend back in Russia before he became a spy, but told Elizabeth that nothing happened.

'Mutually Assured Destruction: Elizabeth is doing some decoding. Phillip gets back from racquetball with Stan and tells Elizabeth she was right about detecting trouble in the Beeman house. He tells her he missed her while he was gone and they kiss. She tells him there's ""trouble at work."" They have to stop a Russian assassin who was hired to kill scientists in the U.S. anti-ballistics missile program, but they changed their minds and were unable get back in touch with him. He had a hit list of 14 possible scientist. They don't know when he's going to kill them, or who he is.

Phillip and Elizabeth stake out one of the possible scientists. They've planted a bomb in the man's car. As a warning shot, they kill the car's engine so that the scientist will look under the hood. He does, sees the bomb and gets his wife out just before Phillip detonates the bomb. This was all an effort to get the government to give its scientists some protection.

At the FBI, Gaad briefs his group on the car bomb. Gaad says car bombs haven't been the KGB's M.O.. Agent Amador suggests they put security on more people, but Gaad says they can't chase their tails. He wants to find out who did this.

Elizabeth meets with Claudia and asks why they'd hire an assassin and try to call him off. Claudia tells Elizabeth ""the contractor"" is from West Germany and gives her some info on a weapons dealer in Baltimore he might be contacting. Claudia then tells Elizabeth that despite the bad blood between them, she feels a ""camaraderie"" with her. Claudia then tells Elizabeth that Phillip ""was with"" the agent he was assigned to, but Elizabeth is suspicious, saying she ""can think of five different reasons"" she'd poison their life. Elizabeth says she asked Phillip. Claudia tells her, ""If you start to think of your marriage as real, it doesn't work. The men don't think of it that way. It was an arrangement."" Claudia tells Elizabeth that even after what they went through  and Elizabeth's attack on Claudia  she trusts her. Claudia says she's ""not so sure"" she trusts Phillip.

Elizabeth gets home and finds Phillip asleep on the couch. She stands over him for a moment and he wakes up. She tells him ""granny"" gave her some info on the killer, then says she's starting to get over the urge to kill Claudia. ""She's just doing her job, like the rest of us,"" Elizabeth says mysteriously.

FBI agents are poring through documents to try to track down the bomber. Amador is bored and wants to blow up the Russians. Gaad calls Beeman into his office. Gaad gives Beeman the keys to a safe house where he and his source (Nina) can have their meetings.

Elizabeth knocks on a door and tells the man of the house (his daughter had initially answered the door) that she knows who he is and what he does, and they need to discuss a few matters. The man tells his young daughter to go up to her room. Elizabeth tells him she needs him to violate his confidentiality because the alternative is ""bringing people down on you who will destroy your business."" He tells her she's making a serious mistake, and his daughter soon enters the room cocking and pointing a shotgun at Elizabeth. Soon enough, Phillip sneaks up and grabs the shotgun out of the girl's hand and sends her to watch some TV. The man describes the man  6-foot-4, light skin, a little chubby, ""friendly guy, actually."" He offers to show them pictures. He got pictures of them, too, when they went to his house.

We next see a man somewhat fitting the description who is watching some guys in suits go into a house. He's taking notes in German about the comings and goings.

Phillip is making our with Martha, his FBI contact, but he wants to talk business. She wants to have sex. So they do that. Phillip starts to talk about work. He starts talking about the scientist bombing. She asks if she can help by getting anything that Agent Gaad has on the case.

Nina shows up at the new safe house and Beeman greets her in Russian. Beeman starts to talk bout ""whatever happened"" the other day. She reminds him that she kissed him, and she kisses him again. And they start getting into it again. She thanks him for getting them a place to meet. She tells Beeman that Arkady is worried at work. She doesn't know what's going on but it seems serious. Beeman asks for more information, but there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. Beeman tells her he doesn't think he should've gotten her into this. He tells her he can get her out, but it ""takes some time."" She puts his hand on her breast and says, ""I do everything for you. I'm trying my best."" He hesitates and tries to say that's not what their affair is about, but she says she's there because that's where she wants to be.

We see the assassin sit next to a woman at a bar. She asks him what his ""thing"" is, and makes some sexual suggestions. He says he's ""much kinkier than that.""

Dinner at the Beemans' seems to have some awkward moments, with Phillip seemingly noticing some odd behavior from Elizabeth. Beeman gets a call from work and says he'll be there in about an hour.

Back at home, Phillip asks Elizabeth what's going on. She says she was thinking about when they first met and whether he remembers. He says he was surprised at how pretty she was, then clarifies he was more ""relieved"" than surprised. She tells him that ""granny"" said he slept with Irina. She reminds him that she asked him not to lie to her, and he told her to her face that nothing happened. Phillip looks down and says he's sorry.

""I didn't know what to say because I didn't want to lose you,"" he tells her. ""I love you.""

She looks at him skeptically and he goes on to say he made ""a terrible mistake,"" and asks if they can try and start over. She says they can't.

""We can do our jobs,"" she says. ""We can fulfill our mission, the reason we were brought to America. But we cannot do this. We will never do this."" She leaves.

The woman the assassin had been talking to is now having sex with one of the men in suits the assassin had been watching. She lures the man to the shower of their hotel room and the assassin walks in to survey the room. The man is an FBI agent, which we learn from seeing his badge on the nightstand. The assassin replaces the battery in the agent's radio with an explosive.

At the FBI, Gaad hands Martha some files and asks her to secure them, thanking her for putting in the extra time. After he leaves, she makes copies. She goes on to snoop for more info and Amador surprises her. He tells her she's been looking very nice lately and he's missed her since they broke up. He asks if they can get a drink some time, and she says, ""No, thank you."" She tells him he's sweet and handsome, ""deep down."" Then she leaves.

Arkady calls Nina into his office. He starts talking to her about some of the opportunities agents have to sell American goods back home to make some money. She tells him she thinks an assignment in America is a chance ""to really accomplish something,"" and adds, it's ""a dream come true.""

Phillip shows up at Martha's house. They're soon having sex again. He's not very into it, distracted by the necklace he gave her  which he'd taken from Elizabeth. Later, Martha gives Phillip the information on suspicious foreign nationals who've come through immigration in the last week, correlated with the hotels they're staying in. It's just what he needed.

Later, he and Elizabeth go through the documents and Phillip soon focuses in on the West German assassin.

We next see the assassin in his hotel room watching ""The Fall Guy."" Phillip and Elizabeth break into his room, pointing guns at him. He calmly asks who they are, figuring that if they were there to shoot him he'd already be dead. They explain that they are there to make sure he complies with the revocation of his assassination orders. He reveals a detonation device, which controls an explosive attached to the wall behind Phillip. He backs away toward the bathroom, pulling his own gun and telling them to put their guns down on the count of three. He gets to two before they shoot him. A gunfight ensues. Before the assassin can regain control of the detonator, Phillip tears the explosive off the wall, tosses it to Elizabeth, who tosses it into the bathroom. The assassin pushes the button, blowing himself to bits. Phillip and Elizabeth survey the scene, then leave.

They calmly walk out while chaos is unfolding at the hotel, and drive away as emergency vehicles are driving back in the opposite direction. Phillip says they can ""get past this, it doesn't have to be like this."" Elizabeth says, ""It is like this  we didn't take a vow to be unhappy.""

Nina shows up at the safe house to meet Beeman. She asks him what he did before counterintelligence. She suggests that FBI agents are ""cops, policemen in your hearts."" She says she wonders if they understand spies. She asks what he wants with Arkady and the others at the Rezidentura. He tells her she now reports to Arkady. She says she might be able to get files for him.

The FBI agent shows up to his shift to protect one of the scientists. The camera keenly focuses in on the agent's radio, which we know has an explosive in it. The agent from the previous shift goes to his car and waits for his partner. Soon after, the place blows up.

Martha looks worried as Gaad finishes a phone call at the FBI. He reports that Leon Billings was inside, too, and didn't survive.

""They're going to pay for this,"" Gaad say. ""I swear to God, they'll pay.""

Amador wants to know what's going to happen. He says they have planes and tanks, but no one is using them. Gaad says no one is going to war over this. Gaad adds that ""this will not stand.""

Elizabeth is doing some more decoding at home in her bedroom. She comes down to the kitchen and tells Phillip that the assassin got one of the scientists and three FBI agents, but doesn't know how. The center wants to know what happened. Phillip says they had bad information and still stopped him, but Elizabeth says they didn't stop him entirely. She says this is their biggest failure in 15 years. It's their job to stop things like this. She says they can't do their jobs if they're emotional. Phillip says emotion had nothing to do with it, but Elizabeth says her head was somewhere else. She says they were never married, ""we had an arrangement and it worked.""

Phillip tells her he tried. He remembers knowing she was disappointed when she first saw him. He starts to say that if they could change things he would, but Elizabeth tells him they can't change things. Phillip tells him that, given the fact that people get separated all the time, he doesn't think the Center would even care if she didn't want to be married to him anymore.

Gaad leaves the office, saying goodnight to Martha and Amador on the way. Martha leaves and Amador seems to be preparing to follow her.

That night, Phillip is sitting in the living room and hears footsteps. Elizabeth is upstairs, walking in the hallway and going to see her children, who are each sleeping in their rooms.

Martha gets home and Amador is watching."

Meanwhile, Phillip reconnected with his girlfriend from back in Russian, Irina, and lied to Elizabeth about having hooked up with her in New York. He asks her to give him another chance and Elizabeth says no.

'Safe House': The kids are enjoying a fried chicken dinner when Elizabeth brings up a serious subject. She announces that Phillip is ""going to be staying somewhere else for a little while."" Paige asks if they're separating, but Phillip clarifies that they're ""hitting the pause button."" Paige thinks it's a joke and Henry simply asks, ""Why?"" Elizabeth says they've been fighting a lot. The kids don't understand why they can't just stop fighting. Elizabeth says the important thing is that they need some time to figure things out. Henry asks if they don't love each other anymore and they say it's complicated. Henry asks if they're going to stop loving the kids. Paige is upset and tells Elizabeth it's her fault because she's ""always giving dad a rough time."" Phillip says it was a joint decision and Paige leaves.

Philip tries to talk to Henry, who's locked himself in his room and is crying. Phillip sits outside the door and tells Henry he loves him ""so much, more than you'll ever know."" Henry keeps crying and says nothing.

Phillip leaves and tells Elizabeth he'll see her the next night at the Beemans' house. Elizabeth is surprised Phillip wants to go together, but agrees they should when he reminds her that Stan's work friends are going to be there.

The next night at the party, Elizabeth tells Phillip that Paige slept in Henry's room and nobody is doing very well. He's staying at a motel, which she says is depressing. Elizabeth says ""it's for the best,"" and Henry says he knows. Elizabeth goes to mingle. In the living room, Gaad tells Stan and Amador, and a couple of others that he's planning to take out Arkady. He says it's voluntary and if anyone should ask it was not approved. Amador and another agent agree to join but Stan says that if it's ""extra-judicial"" he'd rather stay away.

Paige tells Matthew, Stan's son, about her parents' separation. Meanwhile, Amador talks to Stan a little about the Arkady job, but Stan says he's not into it. Then Amador turns his attention to Elizabeth, telling Stan she's ""a fox"" and saying he'd ""borrow some sugar"" if she was his neighbor. Stan calls him a putz.

Sandra, Stan's wife, tells Elizabeth she saw Phillip leave late the other night. Elizabeth explains that they're taking some time apart, and that they told the kids the previous night. Sandra tells her there's ""no shame"" in a separation and tells her not to hesitate to ask if she needs anything. Paige and Henry go to Phillip and ask him to come home, but he says he can't.

We next see Phillip having some serious sex with Martha, who calls him Clark. Later, he prepares to leave and she tells him she's in love with him. She says she's waited her whole life for him and would ""do anything"" for him. She says all he has to do is ask. She says, ""Just tell me one thing: Is this real?""

""Yes,"" he says. ""Yes.""

She asks him to stay with her, ""just this once."" He kisses her and doesn't resist when she takes his jacket off.

The next morning at the house, Henry hasn't come down for breakfast. Paige asks Elizabeth what she should tell her friends. Elizabeth says she should just tell the truth, that her parents aren't living together right now. At Martha's house, Martha brings Phillip breakfast in bed, saying she can ""get used to"" having a man sleeping in her bed. She has to get to work. She tells him Gaad got a call from the White House a couple of days ago and has since been having secret meetings ""with his old buddies from the CIA."" She thinks they're planning to kill a KGB agent, saying, ""it's an eye for an eye, Clark."" She kisses him and says he can stay as long as he likes.

After she leaves, Phillip jumps out of bed and gets moving quickly. As Phillip heads to his car, Amador comes up behind him, announcing himself as an FBI agent and asking Phillip who he is. Phillip says he's ""just a guy."" Amador tells Phillip to lock up his car so they can ""take this conversation downtown."" Phillip turns and kicks Amador in the gut, then kicks his gun out of his hand. They fight for a bit, then Amador pulls a knife. He lunges at Phillip with it, but Phillip turns it on Amador and pushes it into Amador's stomach. It's stuck there and Phillip hastily stuffs Amador into the trunk of his car.

Phillip is trying to treat Amador's wounds at a safe house when Elizabeth shows up. Phillip explains what happened and they both recognize him from the Beemans' party. Phillip also tells Elizabeth about the planned hit on a KGB agent and they realize Amador will know what they're planning. She has morphine and injects Amador with some. She's wearing a blonde bob wig.

At the FBI office, an agent asks Stan if he's seen Amador and he hasn't. He notes that it's ""not like him"" to be late. Stan calls Amador and gets his machine.

Back at the safe house, Phillip pulls the knife from Amador's stomach and it gushes while Amador screams in pain. They put some pressure on it and Elizabeth tells him, ""The hard part's over.""

Stan goes to Amador's apartment and finds it empty. He listens to Amador's messages. After a couple from random women and his mother, Stan hears the message he just left. He also notices that Amador has a picture of the two of them on an end table. Stan sees Amador's car outside of his apartment, which is where Phillip parked it after wiping the prints.

Stan goes to Gaad and tells him, noting that it was odd that there were no prints at all  even Amador's own on the car. Gaad says he's got every available agent out looking for Amador and they'll find him. He doesn't want to jump to conclusions about the KGB having him.

Elizabeth leaves to get the kids and Phillip stays with Amador.

Stan sits quietly at his desk and thinks about chats with Amador. He was proud of having ""no attachments,"" being a lone wolf.

Phillip is still next to Amador, who's struggling to breathe. Elizabeth gets home with groceries and a new wok to make Chinese food. Paige is annoyed and tells Elizabeth that she doesn't want to pretend her life is ""a do-over."" She wants things to be the way they were before. Elizabeth says she knows things are hard ""but it's for the best.""

""For who?"" Paige asks.

Elizabeth gets a call from Mrs. Costa, a teacher at Henry's school. She goes to talk to Henry and says she knows this ""is a terrible thing to do to you right now."" Mrs. Costa told Elizabeth that Henry didn't do his Social Studies project, but he says he did. She asks him to show it to her and he pulls a paper out of his backpack. It says, ""The Revolutionary War. America won."" He says that's it.

Stan picks up Nina and she goes in to kiss him but he doesn't react. She says the KGB wants to know what the FBI's next move is, knowing the FBI won't sit back after the scientist was killed. Stan asks her who took Amador, and grabs her arm and squeezes it hard. He tells her to find out  now. She leaves without saying anything.

Amador's eyes open just a bit and he asks Phillip for water. Phillip gets it and pours a bit into Amador's mouth.

""Cold,"" Amador says. Phillip puts a blanket on him. Amador asks Phillip what he wants. Phillip asks who the FBI is planning to take out. Amador says he doesn't know, but Phillip says, ""I think you do.""

Gaad talks to his small group, announcing that several of his friends from the CIA will be helping. Stan shows up. Arkady will be going on his regular run in one hour and they're planning to kill him in Danbury Park. An agent will be giving a signal by raising his newspaper. If the newspaper is dropped, the mission should be aborted.

Gaad goes up to Stan after the chat and says he's glad he showed up. Stan says that if they kill Arkady they're ""signing Amador's death certificate."" Gaad reminds Stan that Amador knows the name of Stan's contact in the KGB. If he talks, she's finished.

Elizabeth gives Phillip the family update as they walk down the hall to the place where Amador is laying. She says they need information on him now and goes in to give it her own try.

A KGB worker goes to get Arkady for their usual run, but Arkady isn't going. He burnt his hand on a microwaved potato and the doctors want to graft his skin. ""American technology,"" he quips.

Elizabeth stands over Amador and he says, ""We've met before."" She says she doesn't think so. He thinks they met at a bar, had too much to drink and screwed their brains out. He tells her he doesn't know anything about a hit, ""if I did, I'd tell you, baby. Scout's honor,"" he adds.

He tells her she's going to lose this war. He says she can torture and kill him, but they're going to kick her ""motherland's marbled ass, and there's nothing you can do about it.""

Arkady's would-be running partner is jogging through the park alone and the agent making the signal slams his newspaper in the trash. The signal is to abort, but Stan says, ""Screw that,"" and radios two other agents to grab the guy. They do.

Gaad isn't happy with Stan, but tells him to go ahead and interrogate the guy, adding, ""We'll get into this later."" Gaad leaves. In an empty apartment, Stan gets into the guy's head and threatens to kill him if he doesn't give up information on where Amador is, but the man cries and begs Stan to spare him because he's a diplomat and knows nothing.

Amador finally says, ""Arkady."" Elizabeth realizes the the resident is the target, but Amador says, ""Forget it, he's already dead.""

Stan, meanwhile, calls the Soviet Embassy from a pay phone and gets Arkady on the line. He says he has Vlad. Arkady says ""he's nobody"" and has nothing for him. Stan demands Amador be released, but Arkady says he doesn't know Amador.

Stan says that if anything happens to Amador, he'll kill Vlad.

Arkady hands Nina a note and tells her to find anything she can on someone named Amador. He says the FBI thinks the KGB has him. She asks if they do and he say he has no idea.

Arkady gets a call from Elizabeth, who doesn't announce herself but was identified by his secretary as a woman who ""had the emergency code."" He answers the phone and Elizabeth confirms it's him, then hangs up without saying anything.

Elizabeth and Phillip try to figure out why Amador would lie about Arkady. Phillip thinks he's lying to cover up something else. Elizabeth takes out her gun but Phillip says he'll handle it. They agree to pump Amador with morphine and let him drift off after he talks, but Phillip goes to get more information from him and finds Amador has died.

We next see a police scene around Amador's body, which appears to have to been dumped in some industrial area. Stan goes and sees his body. Gaad comes up and says he's going to pull every agent. Gaad says that whoever stabbed Amador went through the trouble to try to save him. Gaad thinks Amador might have given up Stan's contact, but Stan says he wouldn't have. He says he'd risk her life and his own on that assumption.

Stan sits alone drinking coffee and remembers a conversation with Amador about how Vietnam changed him. One of the things Amador learned there was that ""shame"" is one thing worse than dying. Stan's order at the place where he was waiting for food is ready. He brings it back to the apartment where Vlad is being held and hands Vlad a burger. He tells him to enjoy it. Vlad takes a bite.

Stan asks Vlad, frankly, if he's KGB. Vlad nods and says yes but adds that he doesn't know anything. Stan says he believes him. Stan sits back and talks about how good American fast food is, then asks Vlad if he wants something to drink. Stan gets up and walks toward the kitchen, behind Vlad, but then turns and in one motion pulls his gun and shoots Vlad in the back of the head."

Stan, at one point, spotted one of Gregory's crew in Philadelphia after the FBI lost a subject who was being surveilled (Gregory's crew kidnapped him for Phillip and Elizabeth). Stan wondered what ""some guy in the hood"" would care about a KGB spy. Phillip hooked up with his old girlfriend from Russia, and lied about it to Elizabeth, so they're now separated, or, ""hitting the pause button,"" as Phillip told the kids. Amador tracked Phillip at the home of Martha, an FBI employee who's been unwittingly giving Phillip secrets (she thinks he works for the Swiss government and they're having an affair). Amador wound up getting stabbed with his own knife while grappling with Phillip and dying. Stan demanded that Nina get intel on who has Amador, but, finding no one, he ended up killing Vlad  a guy Nina works with who really knew nothing about Amador.

'Only You:' Elizabeth brings Phillip back to his motel, saying, ""it doesn't look so bad."" Phillip tells her to let him know when she wants to switch (she's still living at their house). He tells her to go home and rest.

At the FBI, Agent Gaad says Amador's family is appreciative of their thoughts and there will be details on his funeral coming. He gives a speech about how good of an agent and man Amador was, and says, ""he did a lot for this department and for this country."" He vows to ""take every resource we have"" and ""hunt for whoever is responsible for what happened to him."" He says they won't rest until those responsible are behind bars, ""or, even better, until we zip them up in a body bag.""

Martha comes to Stan and tearfully tells him that Amador was just asking her out again the other night. She sends Stan to see Gaad in the vault. Stan wants to know where Amador's ring is, because he didn't have him. Gaad assures Stan that he's on his side and no one is accusing him of anything. Gaad tries to give Stan a pep talk and tells him ""don't think twice about what you did."" He tells him to go home and rest. He asks him to see what Nina knows the next day about Amador.

Stan visits Phillip's motel room and Phillip has no idea how he found him.

""If I can't find a travel agent staying in a motel under his own name, then I'm in the wrong line of business,"" Stan says, seeming a bit drunk and carrying a six pack into Phillip's room. Then he admits Elizabeth told Sandra, which seems to relive Phillip, who puts on some clothes (he was just getting out of the shower). Stan talks about how he spent a lot of time in crappy motel rooms like this one. Stan finally reveals that his partner was found dead. Stan says Chris Amador was ""a good guy."" Phillip asks what happened and Stan says ""bad guys"" stabbed him.

""We're gonna find them,"" Stan says. He gets up to leave and Phillip offers to drive Stan, who is clearly drunk, home. Stan refuses, insisting he's alright. He thanks Phillip and leaves.

The next morning, Stan asks Nina who killed Amador and she asks him who killed Vlad. He says he doesn't know. She says Vlad was her friend and this is ""a really bad day."" She insists that Vlad had no idea what was going on, adding, ""we don't kill FBI agents."" She says the KGB didn't know anything until ""somebody called threatening to kill Vlad if something happened to your partner."" (That was Stan who called). He again insists he doesn't know who killed Vlad, adding, ""we're not monsters, Nina."" He says he must know who killed Amador. She tells him Vlad never wanted to be KGB and joined to make his uncle happy. He really wanted to be a doctor and was going to leave the KGB the next year to go to medical school. She asks Stan again to find out what happened to Vlad because she wants to be able to tell his family something.

Elizabeth is scrambling to get the kids going in the morning, but Paige says, ""You're the one who wanted it this way."" Elizabeth doesn't like this and tells Paige she does not get to speak to her like that. Phillip shows up to take the kids to school. Elizabeth tells him not to make surprise appearances, ""especially when we are adjusting to new routines.""

Phillip tells Elizabeth that Amador's ring wasn't on his body. Elizabeth says she'll check with Gregory to find out what happened.

At the FBI, there's a hit on Amador's ring. A salvage yard owner tried to fence it at a pawn shop. Stan heads there with some other agents.

Elizabeth, meanwhile, calls Gregory from a pay phone. She taps the phone three times and he hangs up and leaves his apartment.

Stan talks to the salvage yard owner, who insists ""it's a fair trade"" if he finds items in the cars brought to his yard. Stan wants to know who brought the car and the salvage yard owner says it was just left. After being shown how the ring was lodged into a space deep inside the trunk, Stan realizes Amador left it for the FBI to track down. Stan asks the guy again who dropped the car, and Stan punches him in the stomach, then pins him down on the trunk of the car. The man insists he doesn't know names, but it was ""some black guys"" who drop cars with him now and then. Stan brings him to look at some mug books.

Elizabeth and Gregory meet at a bar and tells him that ""the guy"" (Amador) might have left his ring behind in the trunk of the car. Elizabeth tells Gregory about her separation from Phillip. He puts a hand on her head and she says she's ""can't"" because she's ""a mess right now."" She assures him the whole thing will blow over, but to stay out of sight and keep checking his signals.

The salvage yard guy looks through the mug books and eventually picks out a face. It's Curtis Leroy Lyons, the guy Stan once saw in Philadelphia. He brings this to Gaad.

We next see a SWAT team going up a stairwell with Stan following behind. They bust into an apartment and chaos ensues. A chase begins with Curtis running for it on the street. He's eventually caught. Stan looks at him and tells him, ""You should've let me catch you the first time. I'm upset now."" The other officers take Curtis away.

Claudia gets into a car to talk to Elizabeth and Phillip, who report that the FBI picked up a member of Gregory's team. She tells them to put Gregory in a safe house. Phillip questions Gregory's loyalty while Elizabeth insists Gregory would be loyal. Claudia says Gregory could be shipped to Moscow. She also mentions the less preferable option.

Stan questions Curtis, who refuses to talk. Stan says he couldn't care less about drugs, but Curtis says he isn't dumb. Stan tells Curtis about Amador being killed and he says he feels ""like revenge."" He says he is pretty sure the Russians killed him. He tells Curtis to wait for his lawyer if he's working with then Russians, because he will have committed treason. Stan tells Curtis they don't have much in common, but they're both ""Americans,"" right? Curtis says nothing.

Elizabeth meets with Gregory that the plans to take care of him are being put in motion, and Gregory knows the plan is Moscow. He asks her to get him in L.A. He says that if she ""asked them"" it could happen. Elizabeth says nothing and Gregory starts to leave. He then asks if the two of them can ""get out of here,"" and she says she can't. He leaves.

Gaad is briefing FBI agents on Gregory Thomas. He gives the background on the possibility that the KGB recruited civil rights activists like Gregory.

We next see Claudia arrive at Gregory's house. We see FBI and SWAT team members going through what appears to be Gregory's place while we hear Claudia telling Gregory that they'd do whatever they could to make it easier on Gregory, but they can't. Claudia tells her she can't ""take any chances."" She says he's ""been brilliant, a hero"" and his reward is waiting. She tells him the FBI will follow him to the ends of the Earth. She tells him they've left evidence at his apartment linking him to Amador's murder. When the trail stops with him, they won't have to worry about it getting to Phillip and Elizabeth. She calls this Gregory's ""final act of service."" (Meanwhile, we see the FBI finding traces of Amador's blood on a pair of Gregory's shoes in his apartment).

Gregory tells Claudia he ""won't take to Moscow."" He says he's never wanted too much, he ""just wanted to live for something, and I've done that. And to know when I'm done. Now I'm done.""

Claudia comes out into the hallway and tells Phillip that they need to get him to Moscow. They discuss this a bit and Claudia tells Gregory, ""If this ends the hard way, I don't want her to have to do it,"" referring to Elizabeth, because Gregory was her first recruit. She asks Phillip if he'll be there, and he says he will.

Stan tells his wife, Sandra, they know who killed Amador. He says they don't have him yet, but they will. Stan starts to open up to Sandra, telling her that most agents never pull the trigger, but that hasn't been his destiny. He tells her she doesn't know everything, and adds, ""the world that we live in is a little darker and a little uglier than I think you know, so sometimes...."" He trails off and doesn't finish. She suggests that they get out of it all, saying their family is all that matters and they could leave everything else behind.

Gregory and Elizabeth are laughing while eating Chinese food. He tells her about Claudia and asks if Claudia could really stop him if he tried to flee. Gregory pulls Elizabeth onto the couch and tells her not to take Phillip back, but instead to find someone who will love her for being as strong as she is. Then they start to make out, and probably more.

The next morning, Phillip leaves his motel room, carrying his gun in his waistband. Elizabeth is still with Gregory and packing. He says he's not going with her. He tells her he's going to walk outside, ""find some men with guns"" and put an end to this whole thing so that she and Phillip can continue with their mission. She tries to convince him to give Moscow a chance. He says he isn't changing her mind. He starts to walk out and she says she can't let him leave that way, holding her gun and pointing it at him. He walks toward her until the gun is touching his chest. Phillip arrives and when Elizabeth tells him Gregory's plan to get the cops to shoot him dead, Phillip tells Elizabeth to wait outside. Phillip pulls his gun out and puts a silencer on it. Elizabeth drops her gun and tells Phillip she trusts Gregory to do what he says.

""We owe him this,"" Elizabeth says. Phillip thinks it's a bad idea. She asks him to please trust in her trust in Gregory. Phillip steps back and holds his gun on a counter. Gregory gives Elizabeth a kiss on the head and leaves without saying a word walking right by Phillip on his way out.

We see Phillip and Elizabeth walk to their separate cars and Phillip nods at her. They drive away in opposite directions.

We see Gregory walking the streets, right by a cop who immediately gets on his radio.

Meanwhile, Phillip gets back to his motel and Elizabeth gets back to her empty house.

Gregory is still walking as he starts to realize he's becoming surrounded by cops. He crouches behind a car and pulls a gun to shoot at the cops, who start shooting back. He hits at least one as the bullets fly in silent slow motion. Gregory is soon enough hit by three bullets and falls backward. In a new part of the montage, we see Arkady and Nina stand next to each other as Vlad's casket is taken away.

Elizabeth watches a news report about Gregory's shootout with cops. She turns it off. Phillip eats pizza alone in his motel room, and Stan looks at a picture of Gregory's dead body sitting on his desk."

A couple of U.S. scientists were assassinated by a Russian-backed hit man before Phillip and Elizabeth could stop him. Stan's partner, Agent Chris Amador, was killed and Stan avenged his death by murdering a KGB agent, Nina's friend, Vlad. She's asked him who killed Vlad and he says he doesn't know. Phillip and Elizabeth are separated.

'Covert War:' Special Agent ib Charge Gaad (Richard Thomas) briefs his team that three high-level KGB officers are being targeted in Moscow, including Viktor Zhukov (Olek Krupa), the head of Directorate S. We see Zhukov at home when someone shows up unexpected. The intruder kills Zhukov's guard and, after a brief struggles, shoots Zhukov twice, dead.

Elizabeth and Stan's wife Sandra (Susan Misner) go out for a girl's night. They're drinking at a bar when Sandra asks Elizabeth if she's ever dated anyone from a foreign country. Elizabeth says no. Sandra says she dated a visiting professor from Finland in college. She says the professor was the first of two she's ever slept with. Sandra then asks Elizabeth if she's ever thought about cheating.

Phillip, meanwhile, has the kids for the night and they watch ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom (1963).""

Elizabeth and Sandra are dancing at the bar when Sandra slips away to call home. She checks on her son, who tells her that Stan is working late.

Phillip and the kids go out to the vending machines at the motel and see a guy urinating in the parking lot. Phillip suggests to him that he ""pack it up,"" and the guy obliges while the kids giggle.

Later that night, Stan gets home and finds Sandra crying and drunk. She tells him she called headquarters and they said he'd left hours earlier. He says they were mistaken and she calls ""BS"" on him. She calls him a liar and goes off on him about how he's become ""the opposite of the man that I married."" She tells him she's sick of kidding herself about him and their marriage.

Claudia (Margo Martindale) gives Elizabeth the news that Zhukov is dead. She demands to know who did it. Claudia says the CIA Director of Planning for the Soviet Union Richard Patterson (Paul Fitzgerald) was the architect of the operation and Elizabeth says, ""He has to die."" Claudia says there will be no retribution from them, per Moscow's orders. They don't want to let it spiral out of control. Elizabeth says Moscow is wrong. Claudia says she doesn't agree or disagree, ""I follow orders."" Claudia warns Elizabeth not to disobey orders and tells her that Zhukov would want Elizabeth to do the right thing.

Elizabeth flashes back to 1964, when then-Colonel Zhukov gave her a pep talk about the chances she was dealing with and about Phillip, and love.

Elizabeth tells Phillip the news about Zhukov and says she's going to find the man responsible and kill him. Phillip asks if those are the orders, but she doesn't say yes. She says she's going to make sure ""they"" know they can't get away with such an action.

Elizabeth has been doing research on Patterson and his routines. She gives Phillip all the info and he encourages her to let it go. She realizes that Patterson's weakness is women and she can grab him at a place called The Wheelhouse. Phillip tells her they shouldn't disobey orders again. He tells her that if she wants to kill him, she should put a scope on a rifle and take him out. She makes it clear, though, that she wants to look him in the eyes before she kills him.

Stan is home when his son, Matt, gets back from seeing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)."" Stan is surprised to see Matt is wearing makeup, but Matt tells him it's a drag show and everyone wears makeup, ""and, no, it doesn't mean I'm gay.""

Arkady (Lev Gorn) finds Nina with her feet up on her desk in her new office. She's now a senior lieutenant. He tells her that he's planted a bug at the house of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. He wants her to scour FBI communications for any meetings at Weinberger's library because he wants to know anything that is said about the hits in Russia.

Phillip gets to Martha's (Alison Wright) house and she wants to introduce him to her parents (Peggy J. Scott and Richard Kline). He stays to chat for a bit, but leaves quickly while claiming he has work stuff to do. He leaves but first tells her that her parents are lovely and kisses her.

Flash back to Geneva in 1971 when Elizabeth told Zhukov that she was pregnant with her second child. She hadn't yet told Phillip. Zhukov told Elizabeth about his dog dying.

Phillip meets up with Elizabeth as she prepares to make her move to grab Patterson. He says he'll give her 20 minutes before pulling the car around to the alley. She leaves.

Inside The Wheelhouse, the bar Patterson frequents, Elizabeth flirts with Patterson about his choice on the jukebox. She says she just broke up with her boyfriend. She toasts ""to being free and easy,"" but he says he isn't ""easy."" She teases him with some crossword puzzle clues and lures him to the restroom to have sex. She tries to jam a syringe in his leg while he's groping her, but he notices and they tussle for a bit. He starts to choke against a wall, but knees him in the groin to push him off, then knocks him out with a blow to the head using the paper towel dispenser. She opens the bathroom window and Phillip is there to help drag Patterson through it.

Stan meets Nina at their safe house and she asks him again to tell her the story of who murdered Vlad. He says they might never really know what happened. ""It's frustrating,"" he says, but she suggests a different word and asks him what he wants from her. He tells her ""this part of things should stop,"" referring to their affair. He starts to say it's not what he wants, but says ""it's the right thing to do."" She says, ""Okay."" She tells him she no longer has anything... no country or family to go back to. ""I only have fear and you,"" she says. He tells her that his wife knows about the affair and Nina says, ""Family is everything.""

She steps away and slips off her robe, putting her bra back on, but Stan comes up behind her and takes it off again. It doesn't look like ""this part of things"" is stopping.

Patterson is blindfolded and chained to a chair in an empty warehouse space as Elizabeth walks around him playing mind games with him. She asks him, ""How does it feel to be alive, but knowing you're going to die, you just don't know exactly when?""

He offers information and money, but she declines both. She says she wants to know how it feels to order the deaths of innocent people. He tells her those Soviet generals were not innocent, ""they knew the risks,"" and that he is just a bureaucrat who executes orders. He decides nothing, he says, before telling her that she is just a killer with ""no heart, no soul, no conscience."" He asks her if she cares about anything or loves anyone, and she screams at him to stop talking. She fires the gun away from his head and walks out of the room where she breaks down crying. Phillip comes in and asks what happened. He takes the gun and says he'll kill Patterson, but she says it's ""not about him.""

""I was out of control,"" she says.

Phillip comforts her and tells her, ""It's okay. It happens."" She says nothing and walks out.

We next see Patterson still blindfolded and seated on a public bench. Elizabeth is watching from her car across the street before driving away.

Patterson is debriefed by Gaad, Stan and others at the FBI. He tells them about where he was taken and Gaad asked what he was doing in the restroom. Patterson says he was going to have sex with her, but she was attacked and had help. He says her intent to kill him ""was personal"" and based on the killing of the agents in Russia. He can't figure out why she let him go.

""So,"" Gaad recounts. ""A woman and a man?""

""Yes,"" Patterson confirms. ""A couple.""

Flash back to Rome in 1976, where Zhukov is telling Elizabeth how much he loves it there. He asks about Phillip and she says things are the ""same."" He told her she was chosen for America because of her fear of surrender. He told her he had no more stories to tell her, that he lost his way a long time ago and has lived for his work and ""now I miss what I never had.""

Elizabeth shows up at Phillip's motel room to tell him ""thanks a lot."" She brought beer. He invites her in. He has some things packed up and he says he can't stay there anymore. He doesn't want to bring the kids back there. They start to agree that the kids need to feel more rooted. Elizabeth says the separation was the right thing to do, but she's clearly upset when Phillip tells her he got an apartment. She leaves in a hurry and leaves her car with him (his battery was dead), rushing off to take the bus home.

Elizabeth meets Claudia in her car and asks Claudia why she told her about Patterson and then told her not to act on it. Elizabeth knows Claudia wanted her to kill him, but tells Claudia that she let him go. Claudia tells Elizabeth she wasn't the only one who loved Zhukov. Claudia claims she and Zhukov were in love, but Elizabeth doesn't believe her. She thinks Claudia was trying to set her up to disobey orders so she could be shipped back to Moscow. Claudia tells Elizabeth that her job is to help her and Phillip, but Elizabeth insists that she's only acted to hurt them. She wonders why Claudia hates them.

""Because we're better at this than you ever were?"" Elizabeth asks. ""Because I beat your face in?""

""You're still new at this, my dear,"" Claudia says, stone faced. ""So much to learn.""

""This isn't going to go well for you, old lady,"" Elizabeth says, looking Claudia squarely in the eyes before getting out of the car and walking away."

She thinks Sanford could have landed them their highest source in the Reagan administration, but he's worried they might be getting set up. They talk about their living arrangements and the kids. Phillip asks Elizabeth if she's OK with it and she says ""absolutely.""

In Caspar Weinberger's home office, we see his maid take a look at the clock in which she planted a listening device.

Elizabeth goes to a sketchy part of town and sees Sanford's signal that he's dropped something for her. She grabs a jar from the hood of a car and bring it home to examine it. She peels back a corner of what looks to be a post card and finds a tiny chip that shows some schematics for the U.S. missile defense system.

Weinberger's maid is in church looking stressed as the pastor gives her sermon.

Claudia intently plays Pac-Man when Elizabeth shows up at a restaurant to meet her. Claudia says Elizabeth's info from the colonel is ""10 years ahead"" of anything they'd already had in the field. She thinks U.S. intelligence wouldn't give up anything that valuable as a trap, so the colonel must be real. Claudia says Sanford doesn't strike her as the type that would turn them in. Claudia says the colonel has set the meeting time and that a trap is always a possibility, but it's worth the risk.

Elizabeth goes back to Phillip and complains about Claudia. She wants her gone. Phillip suggests they put a bug in Agent Gaad's office to find out if they're running an operation. He says Martha will plant it. Elizabeth isn't so sure.

Claudia is packing Vlad's things and she and another woman talk about him a bit. The other woman tells Nina that Vlad had a crush on Nina, but he knew that she was out of his league.

Phillip and Paige are having fun tossing grapes into each other's mouths when Elizabeth knocks. Paige seems a little bummed to have to leave. Phillip then rushes off to meet with Martha. At dinner, they talk about a trip Phillip wants to take with her. He orders champagne. He tells her to close her eyes, then traces in the palm of her hand, ""Marry me."" She excitedly says yes and they toast and drink.

Nina meets Stan at their safe house. She tells Stan that Sonia met a deputy chief at the French embassy and Arkady thinks the diplomat is ""vulnerable."" They hug, then she starts to take her clothes off and tells Stan she had a dream about him. She was in a burning building, maybe the Rezidentura, and then he showed up. She doesn't know if he saved her, though. She woke up, was safe and he was gone.

""It was you,"" she says, as Stan is kissing her nearly naked body. ""Did you kill Vlad?""

He tells her he would ""never do anything"" to hurt her. She continues kissing him.

Back at her place, Martha tells Phillip (who she thinks is named Clark) that she wants to take his name. He tells her she can't and there's no need. She notices his ""Martha, I need to ask you something important"" look on his face. He asks her to place a pen (which includes a listening device) in Gaad's office the next time he's out. He asks her to keep the other end of the transmitter with her because he'll need to check it when they meet. She asks him to assure her that everything's going to be alright. She tells him she trusts him and loves him.

Weinberger's maid, Viola, is in his study again. She pulls Weinberger's wife aside to talk privately. We next see her revealing the information about the bug to Gaad and Stan at the FBI. She said she was afraid for her son, Grayson, whose life was being threatened. Stan asks her if she's be OK with him calling in a sketch artist. Outside the room, Stan notes to Gaad that it's ""no coincidence"" that the CIA agent who was kidnapped at The Wheelhouse bar was also taken by a couple.

Paige is at Matt's house watching his band practice when another girl named Sarah shows up. She plays guitar and Paige gets jealous. Later that night, Paige tells Elizabeth about it. Elizabeth assures her daughter that ""we see what we need to see in people  things that aren't really there."" Paige asks if that's what happened with Elizabeth and Phillip, but Elizabeth says no.

A technician checks the bug in Weinberger's office with Weinberger's wife watching. He confirms it works, and Gaad says they're going to leave it. ""Now that we know they're listening, we'll know what to say,"" Gaad tells Weinberger's worried wife.

Gaad startles Martha as she brings some papers into his office. He leaves and she takes the opportunity to drop the pen in his office.

That night, she calls Phillip over to her place. She's made a pro-con list about their relationship and tells him it's odd that she can't even tell her parents about them. He tells her he could go to jail if their relationship were revealed. He tells her ""no one can know about this  not for the foreseeable future, anyway."" She says she can't do this if she can't tell her parents, then he relents and says it's OK to tell them if they can trust them. She says she doesn't want to wait and wants to get married that weekend.

Elizabeth and Phillip listen to some of Gaad's conversation and there's no mention of an operation to trap them. He also tells her the wedding is the next day and he needs her to be there and pose as his family.

Sanford is frisked by a cop as he heads to his car on a snowy night. Claudia tells Elizabeth the next day that he was arrested by local cops for failure to pay child support. Elizabeth worries about going into the meeting with the colonel while Sanford is locked up. Claudia is annoyed that Elizabeth went over her head to confirm the orders to meet with the colonel. This conversation happens as they're waiting for the wedding to happen. Phillip brings Martha to meet his ""mother"" and ""sister.""

The wedding happens and congratulations are passed around. Elizabeth quietly says, ""That was beautiful."" She later tells Phillip that it was ""touching,"" and is serious. She says she didn't expect it to be. She notes that he and she were ""never really married."" She asks him if things would have been different between them if they'd said those words. He says he doesn't know.

Gaad shows sketches of the couple that abducted the CIA agent (Patterson) and who poisoned Viola's son to Stan and other agents. One agent thinks the sketches of Elizabeth are two different women, but Stan says the differences are superficial. Gaad says they're looking for a caucasian man and woman in their 30s or 40s. Stan says he's certain the same couple abducted Patterson and poisoned Viola's son.

Nina drops in to Arkady's office at night. She announces that she's been spying for the Americans. She admits to having sent things back home and was turned in exchange for avoiding trouble. He asks if she's the mole and she says, ""Yeah.""

She tells him she deserves to be sent home and punished for her crime. He asks why she's telling him now and she admits that the FBI agent who turned her as become her lover. She tells him he can kill her, ""or let me redeem myself in the eyes of our beloved Russia."""

Zhukov  Elizabeth and Phillip's boss back in Moscow  was assassinated. A guy named Patterson at the CIA was said to have given the order. Claudia gave Elizabeth Patterson's name but Elizabeth didn't kill him. Instead, she let him go. Claudia claimed that she loved Zhukov, but Elizabeth doesn't believe it. Nina, a KGB worker, became a spy for the Americans when Agent Stan Beeman threatened to turn her in for some illegal selling of black market items. Nina confessed to her boss, Arkady, that she's been spying for the U.S. Meanwhile, Phillip and Elizabeth's marriage has been rocky. A contact with a gambling problem, Sanford, brought Elizabeth information about a colonel who has access to secrets and will share them for a price. Claudia has set up a meeting, acknowledge that there's risk it's a set up but it's worth it. Phillip has had Martha his contact in the FBI  to bug Agent Gaad's office to find out if a set up is in the works. Phillip ""married"" Martha  who thinks his name is Clark and he is an Internal Affairs agent overseeing the FBI. Elizabeth was there and wondered what might have been if she and Phillip had really been married. Sanford was arrested for failure to pay child support and Elizabeth is worried that he'll be broken and outed as a spy for the Russians.

'The Colonel': Stan is questioning Sanford, who doesn't understand why the FBI is involved. Stan tells him foreign countries often target people who are behind on child support and assures him he'll get it straightened out in an hour. Stan comes back and tells Gaad that Sanford is ""holding back."" Stan suggests that instead of doing anything in one hour, they should leave Sanford in the interview room until he starts ""shouting at the glass that he wants to talk.""

After sex, Martha and Phillip (who she calls Clark) lay in bed and she suggests they redecorate now that they're married. He says the place is perfect.

Elizabeth meets Claudia at a breakfast place. Elizabeth is worried about a set up. Claudia reveals that Sanford has been moved to federal custody. Elizabeth is more worried now, and Claudia understands. Claudia also tells Elizabeth that they picked up information about a big, hurried meeting Caspar Weinberger will be having with James Bakker  from the bug that was place din Weinberger's study. We know the FBI now knows about the bug and is controlling what the Russians hear through it. Claudia tells Elizabeth she heard from The Center that Elizabeth and Phillip had requested she be replaced. This leads to another showdown-style chat between the two women, with Elizabeth telling Claudia she doesn't know people at all and Claudia retorting that she knows Elizabeth better than she knows herself and adding, ""And you don't know me at all.""

Elizabeth comes back to see Phillip in their travel office. She's worried the meeting with the colonel is a set up. Phillip tells her the Gaad bug is revealing nothing. Elizabeth warns Philip that if her meeting goes bad, he needs to get out of town with the kids. She's worried that as soon as Stan gets a look at her they'll know. Phillip says he should go meet the colonel. Elizabeth tells him he needs to get the tape from Weinberger's meeting with Bakker at the same time, but he says she can do it. Elizabeth tells Phillip she understands what he's trying to do, but that the kids would be better of with him. She says the colonel is her mission.

An FBI tech shows Stan and Gaad how the bug in Weinberger's office is working and how the receiver is in a car that gets parked nearby. Stan then looks closely at the sketches they have of what he doesn't know yet are Phillip and Elizabeth.

Arkady tells Nina he's spoken to Moscow and they've agreed not to sentence her to death because she came clear. He says they were skeptical of her offer to keep working and redeem herself. He told them, though, that he has a strong instinct about her. He thinks she could ""be quite effective with the American."" She says she ""will do everything"" she can. He tells her she will need to be careful, and that if she betrays them again there will be no leniency. He tells her to continue her relationship with Stan and she may be asked to plant something on him, but the ultimate goal is to turn him. She says she doesn't think he can be turned and Arkady replies that a man who did what Stan has done to her ""is weaker and more vulnerable than he seems.""

Gaad explains the Weinberger meeting mission to some agents. They're going to be waiting for the Directorate S illegal who comes to pick up the tape of the meeting.

Phillip gets to the house and Henry doesn't want to have dinner with Phillip and Paige. Phillip decides to stay at the house for dinner.

Stan tells Gaad he thinks the Weinberger mission is going to work. Stan says they'll need to do right by their source. Gaad says he'll have a conversation after the mission is done.

Back at the house, Phillip and Elizabeth sneak over to the kitchen and make their plans in case Phillip has to take the kids off to a state park up north. If she gets out of her meeting, she'll meet them. If not, Phillip has to take the kids to Canada. Phillip tries once more to convince Elizabeth that he should go to the meeting, but she insists they have to follow orders. He agrees not to fight her on it.

That night, Stan surprises his wife Sandra with a vacation to Jamaica, but she doesn't want to go. He says that the next day the case that's been consuming so much time will be over. He says he knows she's had to hear the same old thing so many times, but that some sun and ocean could help. She says she appreciates it, ""but, no, it's not going to fix anything. Sorry.""

Elizabeth sneaks into Henry's room while he's sleeping and kisses him softly on the forehead. We next see her listening to an old tape from her mother, telling her about her uncle's ailing health and about how she's seen pictures of Elizabeth (who she calls Nadezhda) and her family. She said that even though she'd never meet them, she considers them her family, too.

Claudia knocks on an apartment door and pretends to be a clumsy friend of his neighbor who needs to use the phone because she forgot to bring the neighbor's keys. It's Patterson's apartment she knocked on. He's suspicious and makes the phone call himself, eventually letting her in but slipping a gun into his waistline on his back. She comes in and starts chatting on the phone while Patterson watches her. He averts his eyes for a moment and she hits him with a taser, shocking him into submission before he has a moment reach for his gun. She injects him with something that will keep him immobile for 20 minutes, then slowly and matter-of-factly cuts his jugular with a small blade and tells him that's ""10 minutes longer than you have left."" As he bleeds out, she holds up a picture of Gen. Zhukov and tells him about how much of a friend he was.

Paige wakes Henry up to tell him she had a nightmare and is going to wake up Elizabeth. Henry tells her, ""No, you're not allowed and you know that."" Paige goes toward Elizabeth's room anyway and knocks. Hearing nothing, she opens the door and Elizabeth isn't there. Paige finds Elizabeth coming out of the laundry room, where she'd been listening to the tape. Paige doesn't believe she was doing laundry. Elizabeth says she was folding and tells Paige to go back up to bed.

Gaad sends his agents out toward Weinberger's house.

Arkady meets with Claudia in her car and he tells her she's being reassigned in a couple of days. Claudia then tells Arkady that every instinct she has is telling her this meeting with the colonel is a set up. She tells him to get Phillip and Elizabeth out of it. He wonders why she cares since they just stabbed her in the back. She says that as long as she has this job, she's responsible for her officers. She reminds him he's responsible for them, too. She urges him to call it off, but he says that if she's wrong, they'd be giving up their greatest potential success ""since we got the atom bomb.""

""That's what we always say just before our people die,"" Claudia says. Adding, ""Then next thing we say is, 'It was so obvious'""

At the travel office, Elizabeth and Phillip share a quick moment and look at each other.

Stan meets with Nina and tells her he can't say much, but in a few hours there will be some ""very, very happy people at the FBI"" and they are going to approve her exfiltration. She's surprised by this development. They share a tender moment with Stan saying he promised he'd get her ""to the other side of this.""

Phillip has left the office and another worker hands Elizabeth a note that reads, ""I did it the way I wanted. Don't forget the pick up. See you later, I hope.""

Nina sits alone in her FBI-provided safe house and finally gets up to leave. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is preparing for the pick up. She stops to look at a picture of her family before leaving the office. Stan gets to the Weinberger location and Gaad tells him he was right about Sanford  he started shouting at the glass and wants immunity and $500,000. Stan says they should make the deal.

Phillip is driving out to the meeting with the colonel.

Nina is reporting back to Arkady about Stan's comment that the FBI would be very happy. She thinks the colonel meeting is a set up. He picks up the phone.

FBI agents watch a woman walk past the car where the bug receiver is planted.

Meanwhile, Arkady is spray painting an ""abort"" signal on the sides of some Russian cars. He tells another worker he doesn't care what the FBI will think of their spray-painted cars, this is the only way to get the signal out on such short notice. We see Elizabeth, in disguise, on a bus.

Phillip drives right by one of the cars that had the abort signal on it. Claudia sees him reach what seems to be the meeting location.

Phillip walks up and meets with the colonel, sitting next to him on a bench in a park. Phillip tells the colonel that what he sent was ""incredible."" The colonel plays with the Latin origins in the word, saying the whole plan is ""not credible,"" it's at least 50 years from being useful. The colonel goes on about how crazy the arms race could get. Claudia sees one of the cars with the abort signal on it and drives straight into the park and confronts Phillip and the colonel, declaring the whole thing is a set up. The colonel doesn't believe it and now suspects Phillip of having told someone. Claudia says they wouldn't have sent the signal unless they were sure. Phillip looks around and says there's nobody there, then Claudia realizes, ""This isn't the set up."" Phillip figures out Elizabeth is in trouble and starts running.

The car with the bug receiver sits alone while FBI agents watch from every angle.

Phillip is speeding and making dangerous passes on the streets to get there quickly.

Elizabeth is now walking toward the car and Gaad radios to his agents to wait until someone opens the car or gets in.

Just as Elizabeth is close to the car, Phillip drives up next to her and shouts at her to get in. Stan realizes it's ""the couple"" the FBI has been looking for and calls to all the agents to get them.

Agents move in from every angle and appear to have Phillip and Elizabeth boxed in, with two cars behind Phillip and Elizabeth's car and armed agents with guns drawn  including Stan squarely in front of the car  in front of them. Phillip throws the car in reverse and Stan starts shooting. Phillip splits the two cars that were forming the blockade. He gets by them and takes off, with Gaad shouting for all the cars to get on their tails.

A car chase ensues, with Gaad and Stan calling out directions and locations to be blocked by other FBI agents. Phillip, however, turns into a parking garage and loses the FBI pursuit. They steal another car, leaving behind the one the agents were chasing, and remove their disguises. They drive slowly and calmly through the streets while seeing more FBI agents with sirens blaring.

Elizabeth tells Phillip, ""We should still take the kids to that hotel tonight. It'd be nice."" Phillip says OK, but looks at Elizabeth and sees something's not right. She's been shot in the stomach.

Stan finds Nina at the safe house. She's taken a bath, she says, smiling, to start her ""new life."" Stan tells her it didn't work out. ""It all fell apart,"" he says. She acts shocked and says she can't go back there. He apologizes and says he's going to take care of this for her, ""just, not yet.""

She comes to him and comforts him. She kisses him and tells him she knows he'll take care of it.

A doctor pulls the bullet from Elizabeth's stomach in a makeshift operating room, asking Phillip for help to stop the bleeding. Claudia watches, too. Afterward, Claudia tells Phillip he should go home to stay with the kids, but Phillip insists he's not leaving her.

We next see Phillip on the phone telling Stan that Elizabeth's great aunt took a fall and he and Elizabeth are headed up to help take care of her. Stan says he and Sandra will watch the kids.

In a season-ending montage, we see Martha get home and giddily put on her wedding ring (which she can't wear in public because ""Clark"" can't have people knowing he's married to a contact); Gaad shows Sanford the colonel's file and Sanford is talking; Nina is handing Arkady a file on Stan; and Phillip and Elizabeth's kids are at Stan's house.

Elizabeth wakes up and finds Phillip next to her. He holds her hand. She tells him in Russian, ""Come home."" He says nothing and holds her hand to his lips.

Paige has gone home to get her homework and she stops at the laundry room door, going in to see what it's all about. She snoops around and doesn't see much more than folded clothes, but there's more going on and she seems to know it."

After being kicked out of multiple schools for strange events attributed to him, he ends up at the Yancy Academy boarding school, where he meets Grover Underwood, another bullied kid who befriends Percy and introduces him to trading card games based on mythological monsters, such as the Minotaur. When Percy is 12 years old, the school goes on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where their teacher, Mr. Brunner, tells them about the Greek Gods, and their importance to all their modern lives. Percy struggles to focus on the rest of lesson because of his ADHD and Dyslexia, and his mind wanders to when his mother, Sally Jackson, would tell him stories of the Greek myths, including his namesake, Perseus. Percy is scolded by Mrs. Dodds, another teacher who favors his and Grover's chief bully, Nancy Bobofit, and Percy's pencil breaks as he snaps out of his reverie. Mr. Brunner defends his student and gives Percy a pen to replace his broken pencil, and tells him to keep it. While the class eats their lunch outside, Percy tells Grover he longs to get back at Nancy, though Grover recommends against any such action. When Nancy antagonizes Grover, Percy approaches her to push her into the fountain, but she flies into it without him making contact with her. Suddenly, Mrs. Dodds transforms into a winged Fury, though nobody but Percy seems to be able to see her new form. She tells the stunned boy that she has been looking for him, calling him a Half-Blood, and demands to know where ""it"" is. When she pounces on the him, the pen in Percy's hand turns into a bronze sword, impaling the monster and turning her to dust. A moment later, Percy finds the whole class, as well as Mr. Brunner and Grover, standing over him. When Percy questions them about what he saw, they tell him that nothing happened after Nancy fell into the fountain, and there never was a Mrs. Dodds.

Later, the headmaster and administrators bring Percy and Grover into the office, as Nancy has accused Percy of shoving her into the fountain, though he claims he never laid hands on her. Taking the matter very seriously, they once again ask Percy for the truth, and once again Percy confirms that he never touched Nancy. However, Grover tells the headmaster that Percy was planning to get revenge on Nancy for her bullying, and did in fact push her. Percy is promptly expelled from Yancy, feeling betrayed by his friend. Mr. Brunner talks to Percy while he is waiting to be taken home, telling him that he believes Percy will have a difficult path ahead, but that he is exceptionally gifted, though he is uninterested in Brunner's assurances. He is brought home to his apartment in the city, where he is greeted by his deadbeat stepdad, Gabe. Gabe spends his days laying about the apartment playing virtual poker, and he too is hostile towards Percy, who despises him. Percy finds his mom, who tells him she believes his side of the story no matter what the school says, and gives him a bag of blue jelly beans as a welcome home gift. She has also been called by Mr. Brunner who told her about Grover. Percy tells her he thinks whatever is wrong with him is getting worse, and she promptly tells Gabe that she is taking Percy with her to their rented cabin in Montauk, right away, bribing Gabe to let them borrow his sports car.

On the way, Percy dreams he sees a distant hooded creature warning him to run while he can. When he wakes, they have arrived at Montauk amidst a heavy rainstorm. They settle in, and Percy asks Sally to talk. He tells her that he can barely focus in school anymore, and his daydreams have become more and more real. He starts to tell her about the incident at the museum, and Sally lets slip she knows about Mrs. Dodds. When Percy presses her about it, she tells him that they come to the cabin because she met Percy's father there. Sally has never spoken about her son's dad before, and she tells him that he was a remarkable, kind, and wise man who she loved very much. She then tells him that his dad was so special because he was not a man at all, but was in fact a real Greek god. Percy is incredulous, but Sally insists that the stories she has always told him about the gods and monsters are true, and tells him that sometimes the gods would have children with mortals, children called Demigods, or Half-Bloods. Percy remembers Mrs. Dodds calling him a half-blood, and Sally tells him that when demigods reach a certain age and realize what they are, evil forces gather to try and destroy them before they can become heroes. Percy panics, thinking he might be going genuinely insane and that his mom is patronizing him, but Grover suddenly shows up as the storm worsens. He warns Sally that they need to leave right away, as something is coming for them sooner than they originally thought. Percy immediately notices that Grover now has goat legs, and Sally tells Grover she didn't have a chance to finish explaining everything to Percy, as was their plan. They leave in the car, and Percy finds out that his best friend is actually a 24-year-old satyr, and his designated protector. His job is to make sure Percy makes it to Camp Half-Blood safely, as it is a sanctuary for demigods where they can learn about their heritage and train to survive the monster attacks inevitable to such an existence. Grover should have been able to smell the fury/Mrs. Dodds coming, but she was hidden by The Mist, a veil that hides the magical world from the normal world, such as Grover's legs and horns. For some reason, the Mist hid Dodds from Grover, even though beings from the mythic world should be able to see through it. Before they can inform Percy further, the Minotaur appears and begins chasing them down the road. He looks identical to the trading cards Grover played with Percy, and the satyr tells his friend that everything has been subtle training to try and help him survive. The monster attacks them, and though Sally is able to evade it, they lose control of the car and crash into the ditch.

The three climb out of the wreckage, Percy helping an injured Grover into the woods, where they approach the boundary of Camp Half-Blood. Sally tells Percy she cannot go with him, as the boundary keeps out monsters and humans alike, and makes Grover swear a vow to protect her son no matter what. Percy refuses to leave her behind, but she tells him to be strong. The Minotaur catches up with them, and Sally takes Percy's coat, since it has poor eyesight and relies on smell to hunt. She tells the boys to run for camp while she distracts the monster. Percy stops before the boundary line and sees the Minotaur knock his mother down, before picking her up and crushing her into dust as he watches. Enraged with grief, Percy pulls out Brunner's pen, which is vibrating in proximity to the monster, and as he removes the cap it once again turns into a sword. The young demigod charges the Minotaur and they fight, but Percy is terribly outmatched and loses his sword. He grabs onto the creature's back, and it cracks one of it's horns as it tries to knock him off. Percy holds on, and breaks the cracked horn off, using it to stab the Minotaur in the head. It disintegrates under him, and Percy passes out from his injuries. He wakes up enough to see people standing over him once again, and a centaur welcoming him to camp."

He wakes up the next day to find Grover tending to him, and upon seeing the broken Minotaur horn, realizes everything that happened the previous night was real. Grover apologizes for what happened to Percy's mom, and Percy decides to find his dad, since his godly heritage was the reason his mother was killed. Grover follows after as Percy finds the camp director, Mr. D, a disinterested and profoundly laid back man. When Percy demands to speak to his dad, Grover explains that Mr. D. is the god Dionysus, and warns him to show more respect. Mr. D. claims to be Percy's father, and asks him to retrieve a bottle of wine from the canteen for him before they can talk. Mr. Brunner finds them and assures Percy that Dionysus is not his dad, but wants to use him to bypass a curse put on him by Zeus that prevents him from acquiring alcohol as a punishment, the other half of which is having to run the camp. Mr. Brunner is actually the centaur Chiron, legendary trainer and mentor to half-bloods, who used his magic wheelchair to hide his true form. He takes Percy on a tour of camp, which covers the entire valley in which it is nestled, hidden from the rest of the world. There are hundreds of half-bloods living and training around camp, as well as Grover's fellow satyrs, and many other creatures. Percy tells Chiron he lost the pen/sword he gave him, but finds it back in his pocket. The centaur explains that unless he gives it up willingly, the pen will always find its way back to him. He takes the demigod to see the large cabins where the campers are quartered, one for the children of each god. However, the half-bloods must be claimed by their godly parent to know where they belong, and Percy has not yet been claimed. Chiron tells him that some children get claimed soon after arriving at camp, but some wait a long time. Percy is upset that his father seems content to continue ignoring him, but Chrion encourages him, and takes him to the Hermes cabin. As the patron god of travelers, the children of Hermes take in all the unclaimed demigods as well as their own half-siblings. Chrion introduces Percy into the cabin, and leaves him to settle in. He is greeted by an older, scarred camper, Luke Castellan, who shows compassion towards the younger half-blood and welcomes him into their ranks.

Later, Grover goes to the Cloven Council, the leaders of the satyrs, to express a concern about the events of the previous night. After speaking with them, he goes to see Chiron and Mr. D., and explains that Sally Jackson did not seem to die as a human should, but was disintegrated like a monster. Such a thing is achievable by god of the Underworld, Hades, and Grover thinks that for some reason, Hades has taken Percy's mother hostage. Both camp heads agree with Grover's theory, but expressly forbid him from telling Percy. Meanwhile, Percy has another dream about the skeletal robed figure, this time taunting him for the loss he's suffered, and being left alone by his father. As the ground opens up beneath him, he awakes. Luke tells Percy that many half-bloods experience vivid nightmares, as well as their natural battle-ready senses giving them ADHD and Dyslexia as a side effect of perceiving reality differently from other mortals. Percy asks if Luke is unclaimed, but Luke is a son of Hermes. However, he encourages Percy not to try and figure out the gods' plans before they reveal them, and instead focus on the primary goal of all half-bloods; Glory. The older demigod takes Percy with him and the others from Hermes cabin to begin his training, explaining that glory is a tangible reward for great deeds of battle and heroism in their world, which makes demigods more respected by the gods and feared by monsters. Percy runs afoul of Clarisse, an older daughter of Ares, who takes an immediate disdain to him and his supposed defeat of the fearsome Minotaur. Luke sends the Ares kids away, which the other Hermes kids attribute to Luke being the most skilled swordsman at camp, and a well respected adventurer. Percy decides to get some glory of his own to ward off Clarisse, and attempt to force his dad to come forward claim him. Luke warns him the gods cannot be forced to do anything, but admits that glory would make it harder for them to ignore him. They try Percy out in different disciplines such as archery and forge work, but he finds himself terribly unskilled in each. He is discouraged, but Luke is supportive. At lunch, their cabin is called to put forth their burnt offerings to the gods. Luke and the others explain this is a sign of respect to their godly parents, as burning the food you'll miss the most has the best chance of getting their attention before a prayer.

That night, Percy makes a small fire in the woods, and burns the blue jelly beans Sally gave him. He tries to talk to his mother, telling her that he is okay, and has even made some friends since arriving, but there is no sign of his dad. He resolves to find a way to make his father notice and acknowledge him and Sally both, no matter what it takes. As he returns to his cabin in the dark, he is ambushed by Clarisse and two of her cabin mates, who take him to the bathroom and demand he admit that he is lying about his battle with the Minotaur. Percy insists he's telling the truth, so they try to shove his head into the toilet, which suddenly shoots water around Percy and blasts Clarisse and the others, leaving Percy dry. They retreat, and Percy finds the girl who was watching him earlier standing in the doorway. She introduces herself as Annabeth Chase. He asks if she has been following him, which she readily admits to, waiting to see if he had what it takes to help her ""win capture the flag"". Later, the whole camp is training hard for the upcoming game, which gives much glory to the winners. Luke tells Percy that Annabeth is the head of the Athena cabin, and the leader of their side for capture the flag. She is an excellent strategist, and a fearsome warrior, and a close friend of Luke's. He explains that before he came to camp, he was on the road with another half-blood named Thalia, and they discovered the young Annabeth alone on the streets, and took her with them. Thalia was a 'forbidden child', a daughter of Zeus himself. He says that long ago, the 'Big Three', Zeus and his brothers Poseidon and Hades, mutually decided that their children were becoming too powerful, and so they all agreed to never sire more half-blood offspring. The pact held for a long time, until Zeus broke the agreement and fathered Thalia. Because of their innate power, forbidden children are hunted more fiercely than other half-bloods, constantly having to fight to survive. Before Thalia, Luke, and Annabeth could make it to camp, Thalia was killed. When Percy asks why Annabeth would be observing him, Luke explains that only way left for her to prove herself is to complete a quest, but she has not been sent on one yet. However, Chiron revealed a prophecy to her, that she would one day meet a new demigod that would go on a quest she was destined to be a part of, hence her interest in Percy. The camp is called to muster for capture the flag, split half and half, with Percy on the blue team with Luke and Annabeth. Annabeth sends Luke with the rest of the warriors, and takes Percy with her to the far side of the forest. Percy asks her not to expect too much of him, but she expresses her confidence before turning invisible with a magical Yankees cap she got from her mother, and seemingly leaving him alone on the ridge with no instructions.

As the game begins, Luke's battalion fights and wins their first skirmish, and Luke orders them to make for the enemy flag. His friend is concerned about Clarisse, who captains the red team, and will be guarding the flag, but Luke tells him that Annabeth has a plan involving Percy. Meanwhile, Percy whiles away the time alone on the overlook, but is eventually found and confronted by Clarisse herself, as well as her two minions. She tells him she's more interested in getting revenge than the flag, and attacks Percy with her magic spear. Percy does his best to defend himself, but the three Ares children quickly overpower him. Clarisse offers to let him go if he admits he made up the Minotaur fight, but Percy makes a run for it. The teens pursue and corner him on the shore, injuring him as he struggles to keep up. His instincts begin to kick in, and he is able to fend off Clarisse's sidekicks. As Clarisse presses her attack, Percy accidentally breaks her magic spear, enraging her. Before she can go further, the horn sounds signaling the end of the game, and the blue team storm the beach with the red flag in tow. Clarisse leaves Percy be, and Annabeth reveals she was watching Percy invisibly the whole time. Percy demands to know why she didn't step in, and she responds by shoving him into the lake, to confirm her suspicions once and for all. The water heals Percy's wounds, and the whole camp sees as a glowing trident appears above his head. Percy has been claimed by Poseidon, God of the Sea.

Later, after Percy has moved into the deserted Poseidon cabin, Chiron and Mr. D. tell Percy that his father and Zeus have been locked in conflict for months since the theft of Zeus' Master Bolt, the symbol of his power and authority. Zeus thinks Poseidon has had it stolen for him, and as a confirmed forbidden child of the sea god, Percy is suspect number one. Zeus has therefore issued a warning to Poseidon; unless the Master Bolt is returned to him before the Summer Solstice in a week, there will be a terrible war among the gods. Chrion says that while Poseidon has always been jealous of Zeus' position, their third brother Hades has reason to hate both of them, and is likely the real culprit. Therefore, Percy must undertake a quest for his father, to go to the Underworld, find the bolt, and return it before war breaks out. Percy refuses to go on an errand for his dad after being ignored his whole life, despite Mr. D. ordering him to accept. Percy is adamant, but Grover appears, and against Chiron and Mr. D.'s wishes, tells Percy that his mother is still alive, and being held in the Underworld too. If he goes to get the Master Bolt, he could also find Sally and bring her back. Percy decides to take the chance and accept the quest."

With the quest legitimized by the oracle, Chiron lines up the most qualified campers so Percy can choose his two quest companions. Percy immediately chooses Annabeth, telling Chiron that he wants someone who won't hesitate to do what must be done if the quest requires it. He also chooses Grover, who is on a punishment detail since going against Mr. D. Grover doesn't understand why Percy would want him on the quest, and Percy doesn't tell him that Delphi also prophesied he would be betrayed by a friend, just telling Grover that he trusts him the most. Percy packs to leave, having been supplied with human money as well as golden drachmas, the currency of the Olympian world. Luke comes to give him a pair of winged shoes he was gifted from his own father Hermes, and Percy confides that he thought about choosing Luke as his second questmate, but was afraid that if the chance comes to rescue his mom, and it complicates retrieving the bolt, Annabeth may try and stop him, and Luke would be on her side. Luke understands, and asks Percy to watch out for them. As the trio leave, Annabeth stops at the pine tree that marks the edge of camp. Grover explains that the tree is where Thalia was struck down while covering Luke and Annabeth's sprint to safety, holding off a group of monsters sent by Hades, including the fury who attacked Percy, Alecto. Thalia stayed behind to fight, against the protestations of her assigned satyr protector. Before Thalia could die, Zeus turned her into a tree that would strengthen the borders of the demigod sanctuary. Percy is unimpressed by Zeus' solution to 'save' his daughter, which annoys Annabeth. She takes charge of the group, telling Percy to follow her lead if he wants to survive. They make their way to the city and take a bus out of town. Percy doesn't understand why they are traveling via a slow, smelly bus all the way to Los Angeles where the entrance of the Underworld is if their quest is so important, instead of taking a plane. Grover tells him that as a forbidden child, Percy has a target on his back from monsters and gods alike. Zeus may very well try to kill Percy himself, and the sky is his domain. Staying on the ground is their best chance to avoid his wrath, and the smell of the bus should help hide them from monsters. They stop at a gas station and Annabeth leaves to restock their snacks. She insists Percy stay on the bus, and they argue about her assumed authority on this mission. Grover attempts to defuse the situation by singing a satyr song of consensus, but only succeeds in annoying them both into silence. While inside, Annabeth detects one of the Furies, and and finds Alecto/Mrs. Dodds on the bus. She puts on her invisibility cap and quietly confronts her. They spar verbally before Annabeth demands to know why she and the other fury are skulking about, and Alecto tells her they have been sent to retrieve Percy, alive. She offers Annabeth a deal; lure Percy outside where they can take him quietly, and Annabeth and Grover can continue the quest unimpeded. Annabeth silently returns to the others and warns them of the danger, as Alecto and her fury sister transform and attack. Annabeth kills the second fury and Percy and Grover activate the fire alarm, causing Alecto to get blocked by the evacuating passengers while the trio escape into the forest.

Grover leads them to a secret Satyr path through the woods, which was used by his Uncle Ferdinand who went on a quest of his own years ago, and never returned. Percy says they need to contact camp for help, but Annabeth insists that encountering danger is simply part of going on a quest. Percy is uninterested in continuing blindly for the sake of glory, and Annabeth asks him why he is afraid of accepting who he is, reminding him he is more than just a kid. Percy suggests they at least call her mother, Athena, to help them. When Annabeth balks at the idea, Percy realizes that none of the gods are in regular contact with the half human children. They continue arguing as Grover tries ease the tension, and Annabeth lets slip that Grover was her protector before he was Percy's, and Percy realizes that his friend was the protector who failed to save Thalia. Before they can continue fighting, Grover suddenly smells someone cooking hamburgers in the middle of the wilderness. They follow the smell to the seemingly desterted Auntie Em's Garden Gnome Emporium and Cafe, where they find a large statue garden. Annabeth is suspicious, and soon they find perfect statues of real monsters. Realizing who lives here, they try to retreat, but Alecto has caught up with them. She chastises Annabeth for not taking her deal, but they are stopped from fighting by the emporium's owner, Medusa. She knows who the two demigods and their satyr friend are, and invites them inside for food and to talk. The fury shrinks back, but will not leave without her prize. Percy suggests they go inside, thinking they can trust her as his mother was always sympathetic to Medusa's story, and she may not be as evil as people think. Annabeth is unconvinced, but with no other choice, she follows them in. Medusa welcomes them, though Annabeth is concerned she is more at risk than the others in this case. Medusa assures her she does not hold a grudge against the girl simply because she is Athena's daughter. As they eat, Percy asks what Medusa is, if she isn't a monster, yet is powerful enough to strike fear into the monster outside. The woman claims that she cannot stand monsters, and claims her power to deal with them permanently is a gift from the gods. Annabeth reminds her that it was a curse, one placed on her by Athena. Medusa admires Annabeth's loyalty to her mother, telling her that when she was mortal, she was once a devout worshiper of Athena, content to serve her without recognition forever. However, Poseidon saw her and fell in love with her, and in jealousy, Athena cursed her to never be looked at again. Annabeth says that isn't what happened, that her mother is just, but Medusa says that all gods are bullies, blaming mortals for their own mistakes. Annabeth calls her a liar, and Medusa goes to the kitchen to prepare more food, asking Percy to join her. Feeling sorry for her, he goes and apologizes for Annabeth's behavior. She tells Percy the girl will betray him, as she was betrayed by Athena. Percy insists she wouldn't, and asks why she's so interested in keeping him safe. She says that she feels kinship with his mother, who she says is in danger because of Poseidon's negligence. She tells him his companions will try and stop him if he deviates from their quest to save his mom, and offers to 'remove' Annabeth and Grover so he can finish his quest. When she turns, Percy has already run for it. Angered, she takes off her veil and pursues.

With the fury still outside, the trio meet up and flee into the basement, finding a vast cavern with hundreds of human statues, Medusa's victims. She enters the basement, and the three kids run into the maze of statues. Grover tries to use the flying shoes to distract her, but accidentally flies off into the darkness, leaving Percy and Annabeth on their own. They hide as Medusa approaches, who tells them they have made their choice to side with their parents against her, mocking Percy that he could have saved his mother if he had listened to her. Percy draws his sword and closes his eyes as she finds him. Before she can kill him, Grover crashes next to them, drawing her attention while Annabeth puts the Yankees cap on her. As the cap turns her invisible, Percy is able to cut her head off. They regroup and find the invisible head, and Percy and Annabeth take it upstairs. Percy goes outside, and uses Medusa's head to turn Alecto to stone when she charges at him. The two return to the basement and find Grover, who has discovered the petrified body of his uncle among Medusa's victims. Percy suggests keeping the cap on the head and burying it to ensure no one will ever stumble upon it, which Annabeth reluctantly agrees to, before demanding to know what Medusa meant by saving Percy's mom. He wants to know what ""offer"" the fury made to her, and they begin arguing again. Grover snaps at them both, telling Percy that the hat is the only thing she has from her mother, and tells Annabeth that Percy's mom is alive and being held in the Underworld. He asks them both to have sensitivity towards eachother's situations, and asks Percy once again what it is he seems so scared of. Percy finally admits that the oracle warned a friend would betray him, so he picked Annabeth for the quest because she would never want to be his friend, and he picked Grover because he thought he could trust him no matter what. However, ever since they began the journey he has felt alone and confused. Annabeth tells them that Alecto offered to let her and Grover go if she turned Percy in, and Percy tells her that Medusa said she would help get Percy's mom back if he let her have the other two. Having come clean to eachother, Grover says they need to commit to working together as a team from now on if they are to have a hope of completing their quest. Percy decides to use the Hermes Express postal service that Medusa used to ship her statues to send her head to Olympus. Grover and Annabeth warn that the gods won't take it well, but Percy argues that between Medusa trying to stop their quest to prevent war, and her conflict with Athena, they might see it as a tribute. And this way, Annabeth can keep her mother's hat.

Later, at the Empire State Building in New York City, Hermes happily delivers the package with Medusa's head to Mount Olympus."

Percy is too scared to let go of the edge, and Sally grows frustrated, insisting that being able to swim may be essential to Percy's survival one day, and she might not always be there to help him. Percy encourages his mom to take a deep breath and calm down, as she's taught him, confident that she will always be there for him, and she embraces her son. As she lets go, young Percy finds himself alone in a vast desert, seeing the dark robed figure in the distance. The figure warns him that being a forbidden child trying to be a hero will lead to his destruction, and tells him a new danger is coming for him already. Percy wakes up from the dream, in the cabin of a train headed to Los Angeles, along with Annabeth and Grover. Percy asks the also awake Annabeth about Thalia, the last known forbidden child. Annabeth tells him Thalia was tough, and that unlike the naturally kind-hearted Luke, with Thalia, respect had to be earned. Percy asks if that is why Annabeth is so hard on him, and Annabeth admits it's part of it. Percy wonders why the gods, their own parents, seem to require sacrifices or great deeds just to be notice their children, when family is meant to love unconditionally. Annabeth tells him its not just the gods who think that way, and explains the reason she was on the streets alone when Luke and Thalia took her in. Athena creates her children and gifts them to the mortals she loves, such as Annabeth's father. Her dad did love her very much, but eventually he met and married another woman, and they had children of their own. Soon Annabeth felt treated as a burden rather than a gift, and so she ran away at 7 years old. She tells him everyone has conditions, but at least the gods are straightforward with theirs. Grover awakens, very cranky with the sound of them talking so early. The three get up to get breakfast. Outside, a flying figure crashes in through the side of the train.

Later, in the dining car, Percy asks the other two how they are supposed to know where to go when they reach California in two days. Grover tells him they won't know until they get there, but they should have plenty of time to find it before the deadline. He asks Annabeth why they are even continuing the quest when the oracle implied they would ""fail to save what matters most in the end"", and she tells him that the prophesy could mean just about anything, and might not even have to do with their quest. She advises him not to try and read too much into prophecies, as they are pretty much impossible to interpret correctly. They see a group of centaurs galloping in the plains outside the train window, and admire the magnificent creatures. No one else on the train can see them because of the Mist, and Grover tells them there used to be massive herds of centaurs and other creatures before humans began killing them. The two tell Percy of Pan, God of the Wild, who disappeared thousands of years ago. Since then the natural world and the human world have fallen out of balance. The Satyrs send the bravest of their kind, called Searchers, to search for the missing god and bring him back, but none have ever succeeded. Grover's uncle Ferdinand was one such Searcher before he was killed by Medusa. The three kids are approached by a Police officer, who asks them to accompany him back to their cabin, which has been ripped apart and the wall blown open. They deny any knowledge of how their room came to be this way, though the officer is unconvinced, as a woman in the neighboring cabin claims to have heard a crash from the room, followed by children's voices running away. They challenge this accusation, but Annabeth's smart attitude towards the officer leads to them being detained in the dining car while another officer questions the woman. Percy assumes the officer must be a monster since he seems so convinced of their guilt, when they could not have possibly caused so much damage from the inside. Annabeth thinks he is human, but whatever tore their room apart must have been looking for Zeus' Master Bolt, thinking, as many Olympians do, that Percy has stolen it. They need to find a way out of the situation before they get delayed, but the woman comes to sit with them, asking the guarding officer to give them a moment to talk. The officer leaves, and she seems to be an ordinary woman with a dog carrier. She tells them she knows they must be scared without their parents around, and doesn't really think they destroyed the cabin, but just wanted a chance to speak with them face to face. Grover notices a piece of broken glass on her jacket, noting that the windows were broken from the outside. The animal in the woman's carrier becomes extremely agitated, and she calms it, telling it to be patient. She tells the kids that they aren't to blame for what happens next, but unfortunately they will have to bear the consequences of their parent's misdoings. Percy warns her that they have defeated several monsters, and will take her down the same way. The woman tells him the monsters they have killed were her own children. Grover and Annabeth realize with horror that the woman is Echidna, the Mother of Monsters. She tells them that she finds demigods to be the true monsters, too dangerous to be left alive. She calms the creature in the carrier again, telling the children it is young, and still learning to hunt. Their conversation has been meant to make them understand the danger, instill fear in them, all to make them easier for the monster to track. The carrier opens and the creature shoots out it's tail and jabs Percy in the chest, before Annabeth stabs it and the three run. The Police officers pursue them, Echidna scolding her child for getting overexcited before releasing it following. The trio run along the train, which is pulling into the St. Louis station. They block the officers from following them, and find a small stinger where the monster hit Percy. He seems fine, and the monster starts to catch up with them. With the train now stopped, they hurriedly disembark and head across the train yard to safety. Annabeth tells them they have a little time, since the young monster likely won't go far from it's mother. All the same, they can't outrun them for long. Luckily, Annabeth knows of a nearby sanctuary where no monster, even Echidna, can enter. A temple to Athena; the Gateway Arch.

She excitedly tells them about the arch's architectural genius, held up by pure math and physics, a monument to perfection, a tribute to Athena that was built by one of her half-blood children. Grover dislikes that the arch also represents mankind taking over wild places and killing its animals, a simplification that Annabeth takes umbridge with. Grover goes to book new train tickets, and Annabeth regrets snapping at him. Percy is grateful for the safe haven her mom has provided for them, and they wonder if it was luck or fate that they were in the right area to find a temple of the gods when they needed one. She tells him she knows he thinks its silly that Athena might care for her after so much silence. Percy assures her it doesn't matter what he might think, he's new to being a demigod anyway. She suggests that even though the arch is a monument to Athena, it's still a temple, and Percy might be able to contact his father. Percy is uninterested in trying to talk to Poseidon, saying that he is past trying to win his dad's attention when Annabeth has already been more helpful to him in a few days than Poseidon has been his whole life. He suddenly collapses, and they realize the monster's stinger must have been poisonous. Annabeth has an idea, and she and Grover help him outside. They put him in a nearby fountain and splash him with water, thinking that Poseidon's magic should be able to cure the poison like it healed him at camp, but it's not working, and Percy is getting worse. Annabeth wonders if the water must be from a naturally flowing source for Poseidon to heal his son. They see Echidna in the distance, making for the arch as the monster causes havoc behind her. Annabeth tells them they need to get back inside and head to the very top of the arch, the best viewpoint, which is really an alter to Athena. They are going to pray to her mom and ask her for help. They bring Percy back into the safety of the arch, but Annabeth is distracted by Echidna speaking telepathically to her before joining the boys. They get to one of the elevators, but see Echidna and her monster follow them inside. Grover recognizes the creature as the Chimera, one of the most feared demigod killers in the world. Confused as to how the monsters could have gotten into the temple, Percy asks Annabeth what Echidna said to her, recognizing the telepathy from when the fury Alecto spoke to him at the museum. Annabeth tells them that Echidna was allowed entry by Athena, who has been angered by her daughter's 'impertinence'. Percy realizes she means the head of Medusa, saying that he was the one who sent it to Olympus, not her. Nevertheless, Annabeth went along with the idea, and Athena has been embarrassed. She will not protect them from the Chimera, or help save Percy. They make it to the top of the archway, resolving to fight it out, but find the arch full of innocent tourists. They pull the fire alarm to start an evacuation, and Annabeth tells Grover to take Percy and hide in the crowd going back down while she holds off the monster. She orders the satyr to get Percy to the river so Poseidon can heal him, and make sure they get the Master Bolt and finish the quest. They refuse to leave her behind, but she says someone has to stay and keep the monster busy or they will all be killed. Percy offers her his sword, but manages to slip past her and lock her and Grover out of the top of the arch. They beg him not to try and stand alone against the monster, but he tells them that Poseidon has never been there for him and would not have healed him. He would have died anyway, at least this way the other two can finish the quest. He turns to face the approaching Chimera and Echidna, who have reached the peak of the arch. The Mother of Monsters advises him to give up, but Percy, weak from the poison, stands his ground. He attacks the Chimera, managing to cut it but barely avoiding getting burned to death as the massive creature breaths fire at him. Echinda uses her powers to blow a hole into the floor of the archway, as Percy loses his sword to the Chimera's thick hide. The monster charges the half-blood and Percy is thrown backwards into the open hole, barely managing to hang onto the edge. Echidna taunts him for not having anyone left who cares enough to be willing to help him. His strength fails and he falls from the top of the arch and plummets towards the ground, suddenly getting caught by a huge spout of water coming out of the Mississippi River. He finds himself at the bottom of the river, his foot trapped by debris. He tries to free himself and swim to the surface, but is approached by a sea spirit, sent by Poseidon, who tells him that his father has always been watching over him, and is proud of him. She tells him to breathe, but he panics and tries again to free his leg from the riverbed. The spirit assures him it has been hard for Poseidon to stay distant, but he will always be there for his son. She tells Percy to trust his father. With no other choice, Percy takes a breath, and finds that he can breathe normally underwater."

Grover nervously points out that the cops are eyeing them with interest, but Annabeth is distracted by three old ladies knitting amidst the chaos. One of the ladies cuts a strand of yarn while looking directly at Annabeth, as Grover tells her they should leave. They go to the riverbank, hoping that Percy is somehow still alive after falling from the arch during his battle with the Chimera. To their surprise, Percy climbs out of the river unharmed, and healed from the Chimera's poison thanks to Poseidon. Annabeth is relieved to see him, and he tells them that they need to make their way to Santa Monica before they go to the Underworld, as the sea god is going to help them with their quest. Grover informs him that the Police are now after them, since the officers on the train reported that they blew a hole in it, and now they think they sabotaged the arch. Unable to get tickets on public transport without risking arrest, they start walking. Percy, who has found a new sense of commitment to the quest since being saved by his father, and points out that they still don't know who actually stole the Master Bolt, since Hades couldn't have done it himself. If they are going to succeed fully, they'll need to find out who Hades sent to carry out the theft. He notices Annabeth is distracted, and she tells them about the three old ladies she saw, the Fates. When they cut the string in front of her, it meant that one of them will die soon. Percy is skeptical, but just then they are approached on the road by a biker who offers to help them, and knows of their task. It's Ares, the God of War, who was also sent out by his father Zeus to find the bolt. He meets them at diner to talk, and shows them a news broadcast; Percy and his mother's absence has been reported by his stepfather, Gabe, who has accused Percy of destroying his car and having something to do with Sally's disappearance. The FBI and the media have gotten involved, and there is no way the three kids can travel officially without being caught. Percy is infuriated, and Ares tells them that their quest will fail inevitably. They truth is, Zeus will probably still go to war with Poseidon even if they manage to get the bolt back, since their family craves conflict. However, since Percy is family, he offers them a deal in exchange for transport out west. He left his shield, his own symbol of power, at an abandoned theme park nearby. If they retrieve it and bring it back to him, he'll get them a ride. Annabeth is flippant towards the god, but they agree to his deal. Ares decides to keep Grover with him as insurance to make sure Percy and Annabeth return, and Grover tells them to go on since he has his own plan.

Percy and Annabeth arrive after dark at Waterworld, a huge dilapidated amusement park. As Percy moves through the turnstile, he triggers a trap that activates a sharp grinding device overhead that lowers as the stile moves. He stops halfway as Annabeth realizes the blades are made from Celestial Bronze, the same material his sword and her knife are made from. The enchanted metal passes through mortals, but is deadly to monsters and half-bloods. She figures out the machine does not lower all the way, and tells Percy to finish passing through. The device retracts when he reaches the other side, and a counter ticks him and Annabeth as they enter. They realize a god must have built the park, and only Hephaestus, the God of Craftsmen, would have had the ingenuity. The trap was only meant to scare them off, but now he knows they're here. Meanwhile, Grover is able to impress Ares with his knowledge of lesser known wars, and tells him that warfare reflects nature's own brutality. Ares is flattered, and they start to chat. Annabeth and Percy start their search, and try to figure out why Ares would have left his shield at Hephaestus's park. Percy remembers that Ares has had a longtime affair with Hephaestus's wife, Aphrodite. They realize the two gods must have met, been caught by Hephaestus, and left in a rush. As they approach, one of the rides lights up and activates, the tunnel of love. Assuming their quarry lies within, they climb aboard the boat and are taken into the building. Magical lights depict the story of Hephaestus, having been rejected by his own mother, Hera, for his deformities, and later turned away by Aphrodite, who chose Ares over him. Percy comes to understand what Ares meant about family of the gods being messed up, and realizes why his mother waited so long to tell him about his heritage. She was trying to keep him away from the Olympians and their constant conflict. He wishes she had prepared him better, but Annabeth points out Sally was probably trying to make sure Percy didn't end up just like them. The lightshow concludes, and the boat drops down into a steep thrill ride, and they land deep below the park in another part of the ride. They can see the chamber where the shield is held, but the boat is about to be torn apart by another deathtrap up ahead. They abandon the boat and jump into the water, but the strong currents drag them under. Percy reaches out to Annabeth, and jets of water shoot from his hands. They wake up on a platform in the shield chamber, unsure of what exactly Percy did to save them. Ares' shield is held fast in the hands of a giant statue, in front of which sits an ornate golden throne. They set about figuring out how to free the shield from the statue.

Meanwhile, Grover gets Ares to go on a rant complaining about the campers at Camp Half-Blood, who visit Mount Olympus on a field trip every Winter Solstice. Grover points out that one of the half-bloods must have taken the Master Bolt while they were there, but Ares dismisses the idea. When Grover implies that Ares has already found the lightning thief, the god of war becomes closed off after telling him he knows that Percy did not steal the bolt, to Grover's interest. Back at the park, Percy tells Annabeth the rest of Hephaestus's story. After being rejected, he built the golden chair and tricked Hera into sitting in it, but she couldn't get back out. All the other gods tried to free her, but Hephaestus's craftsmanship was too complex and strong for even them. They eventually agreed to let Aphrodite become his wife if he let Hera go. Percy realizes the chair is the mechanism, a bargaining tool. One of them must sit on the throne to release the shield, but won't be able to leave. Annabeth immediately tries to make the decision to stay, but Percy won't let her. She insists he won't make the choice to sacrifice himself for her again, and Percy tells her the whole reason he chose her for the quest was because she could do what needed to be done for the sake of their mission, even if it meant leaving him behind. The Fates were right, one of them would have to take the fall to get the others to the Underworld in time. Annabeth argues, but Percy points out that she has a better chance of succeeding without him than he does without her. She reluctantly agrees, and promises to get him mom back from Hades, and return to find a way to get him out. He sits on the throne, which covers him in gold, making him one with the chair as the shield is dropped from the statue. Annabeth is devastated at the loss of another friend, and doesn't take the shield. She starts frantically trying to reverse the mechanism on the chair as a figure enters the catwalk above; Hephaestus himself. He shows her the way out, and tells her to take what she came for and go. She refuses to leave without Percy, and the god of craftsmen tells her it is impossible to reverse the machine. He reminds her how she has displeased her mother, and tells her once she leaves and completes the quest for the Master Bolt, she will achieve monumental glory, and win back Athena's favor. Annabeth is tired of the Olympian cycle of sacrificing everyone around them to get what they want. She tells him she doesn't want to be a part of it anymore, saying that Percy is different from all of them, willing to give himself up for the good of others. She isn't willing to let her friend take the fall for her for the sake of glory and power. Her words move Hephaestus, and he reactivates the chair and releases Percy. He tells Annabeth he'll have a talk with Athena, and lets them both leave with the shield.

The return to the diner and give the shield back to Ares, who shows them to their ride west, the back of a semi truck carrying live zoo animals. The truck is heading to Las Vegas, where they can find Hermes and try to get his driver to take them the rest of the way to Los Angeles. He also gives them a backpack of supplies, but tells them they have no chance of actually succeeding. Percy becomes angered by Ares' continual insistence of their failure and nearly challenges the god, but Grover convinces him to take what they can get and leave. As Ares closes the truck behind them, Grover tells the other two that he has figured out who stole the Master Bolt."

An Entity, in the guise of the Yancy Headmaster, berates the unseen ""Lightning Thief"" for losing Zeus's Master Bolt after stealing it for the Entity, who has resolved the situation himself. The theft of the bolt and following war between the gods is only the prelude to the Entity's true plan. However, he warns the thief that future failure will result in their replacement, as he looks at Percy. He tells the demigod it isn't yet time for them to meet, and in the meantime Percy will prove his worth. Percy wakes up in the trailer of the Zoo Animal transport truck Ares provided for them to stow away in to Las Vegas. They are almost at their destination, and Annabeth uses a piece of crystal to reflect the light into a rainbow on the wall. Percy puts a golden drachma into the refraction, and Annabeth asks Iris, the Goddess of the Rainbow, to help them get a message to Chiron at Camp Half-Blood. The rainbow turns into a visual link to the camp office, where Luke answers. He tells them that Chiron is busy trying desperately to keep things under control, as news of an upcoming war has the campers taking sides against eachother. The two inform him of Grover's discovery that Ares knows who the Lightning Thief is and is covering up for them. The only person he might do that for is his own half-blood daughter, Clarisse. Percy tells Luke to have Clarisse brought in and questioned about something else that is coming, something even bigger than the war between Zeus and Poseidon. Luke promises to see it done, but Annabeth cuts off the connection before Percy can ask him for advice dealing with his father, Hermes. Annabeth tells him the Luke and his dad don't get along, and would try to talk them out of speaking with him. Grover comes back from talking to the animals on the truck, who've informed him that the men transporting them are illegal exotic animal smugglers. They have a plan to escape, but they need help getting out of the cages.

As soon as the truck arrives in Vegas, the animals run amok in the crowded Vegas Strip, though Grover has given them a Satyr blessing to help them reach the wilds safely. The trio head for the Lotus Casino and Hotel, a massive and lavish establishment full of patrons. After their initial urge to check out what the casino has to offer, Grover reminds the others of the Odyssey, in which Odysseus met sailors who forgot who they were and became contentedly trapped after eating enchanted lotus flowers. They don't have any choice but to risk it and enter, and Annabeth says they should be safe as long as they don't eat anything. They search for the messenger god, but the casino is a maze of arcades, gambling tables, and restaurants. They decide to split up, Annabeth going with Percy since he doesn't know what Hermes looks like. Annabeth reminds Grover to come find her if he gets to Hermes first. When Percy asks why, she explains that her connection to Luke could persuade his dad to help them. During her time on the road with him and Thalia, she met his mother, a seer, one of only a small number of mortals that can see through the Mist. Many of them can see into the future, and the horrors can drive them mad, a fate that befell Luke's mom. Luke blames Hermes for it, but despite this, the messenger god cares deeply for his son, and has always wanted to win him back. Meanwhile, Grover finds another satyr, an old family friend of his, Augustus. He was another Searcher for Pan until he, like Grover's uncle Ferdinand, went missing. He doesn't remember Grover, who realizes he must have eaten the lotus flowers. He tells him about finding the petrified Ferdinand in New Jersey, which seemingly breaks through to Augustus. He tells Grover that he has found Pan, inside the casino. He is very close to breaking through to him, but he needs Grover's help. Percy tells Annabeth about the dreams he's been having, and the entity that has spoken to him in it. However, this last dream he seems to have eavesdropped on the Entity's meeting, in which he spoke to whoever stole the Master Bolt for him. Assuming the entity is really Hades and the thief is Clarisse, they wonder what the next step of their plan could be if starting war amongst the gods is only the beginning.

Grover follows Augustus through the casino to the arcade, but doesn't understand why the god of nature would hide in an artificial paradise like Vegas. Augustus forgets who Grover is again, and offers him the snack he's been munching on. Grover refuses to eat the lotus flowers, but sees it is just ordinary food. Before he can warn the others, he suddenly starts to forget why he's there. Unable to remember his mission, he goes to help Augustus find Pan. Annabeth and Percy find Hermes enjoying himself at the craps table. He knows who they are and why they are there, and tells them he has no interest in helping them find their way into the Underworld. At the mention of Luke, Hermes' attitude changes. He teleports them to a private room in the casino to talk. He remembers Annabeth from the last time he saw Luke, and she tells him she overheard Luke blow up at his dad and blame him for what happened to his mom. She asks him to help them, and show Luke how much he cares in the process. Hermes is unconvinced. He's helped heroes find the secret way into the Underworld before, and each and every one of them has met their doom inside. As for Luke, he was warned not to engage with his offspring, but he ignored them and tried to help Luke and his mother anyway, only succeeding in making their lives even worse. He tells them gods and half-bloods can't help but hurt the ones they love most, illustrating his point by showing Percy a flashback of him in the back of a car, leaving Percy shaken. Annabeth asks him one last time to help them, but Hermes refuses. Annabeth walks out, and the god tells Percy it was Poseidon himself that told him to stay away from his children, telling him its too hard watching them struggle without being able to help them, but it is necessary to let them follow their own path. Percy tells him his dad was supposed to meet him in Santa Monica and asks him why he would do that if he thinks it will only make things worse. Hermes tells him gods do not like to feel powerless. However, in any event, its too late now. They've been in the Lotus Casino longer than they think.

Percy finds Annabeth hesitating at the exit. It is already night time, and they realize they have been inside for three whole days. The lotus flowers weren't in the food, they were pumped into the air itself, and time moves much faster outside than it does in the magical casino. Hermes let them waste time talking to him, making Annabeth feel less guilty about having picked his pocket while invisible after she left. She has the keys to his car, all they need to do is find it, but Hermes reminded Percy they had something else to do before they go. Annabeth starts to realize Grover is missing, but Percy has forgotten him completely. They spot Augustus as their suppressed memories return to them, and he runs when they approach him. Percy chases and eventually tackles him, getting him to tell them where their friend is. Grover is in the arcade, playing a virtual reality game. They get him out of it, but he has no idea who they are. They hurriedly explain their quest, and he is enthusiastic to join in. They head to the parking garage to look for Hermes' car, and on the way Percy asks Grover what game he was playing. Grover says he thought he was searching for Pan, and was getting close. They find Hermes' Taxi, along with a note addressed to them. The god of thieves noticed Annabeth picking his pocket, and has left them instructions for the car as well as a map to the entrance to the Underworld. As soon as they are on the road, Hermes' power will allow the car to instantly take them anywhere, but first they need to get it out of the parking garage. They realize none of them know how to drive, and Percy volunteers to give it a try. They crash into the walls and are nearly struck by a semi before making it onto the street, where the car teleports them straight to the beach in Santa Monica.

The trio get out of the car, and Grover's memories return to him. He wonders why he forgot so much faster than they did, and Annabeth guesses it was because she and Percy had eachother to remind them what was important. Percy is nervous about meeting his dad, but his friends encourage him. He walks into the surf, and submerges. As he reaches the depths, he is greeted by the Sea Spirit who helped him in the river. She tells him the sea god waited as long as he could for his son, but the solstice has just passed a few hours ago, and Zeus' deadline has expired. Poseidon had to leave to marshal his forces for war. He left a message, the spirit telling him his father is very proud of him for making it this far, and doesn't blame him for the mission's failure, but now it it time to return to Camp Half-Blood. He is free of his quest. Percy refuses to give up, telling her that the war between Zeus and Poseidon is part of a larger plot, one the gods are completely unaware of. Something worse is using them against eachother, and he will not stand by and let it happen. He asks the spirit to help them finish the quest, and she remarks how like his father Percy is. She tells him what belongs to the sea can always return, giving him magic pearls, each of which will help one of them escape the Underworld. Percy notes there are four pearls, and the spirit tells him to find the Master Bolt, and return with his mother"

According to Hermes' map, the secret entrance to the Underworld is in the store, and Crusty is it's guardian. Percy asks him to let him pass, but Crusty instead tries to convince Percy to sit on one of the deadly beds, his ancient method of killing his guests. Percy is well aware of the danger, and an invisible Annabeth shoves Crusty onto the bed, trapping him. They let him live, but he warns them they will never succeed in bringing someone back from Hades. Nevertheless, they find the entrance to the Underworld as Grover joins them. The satyr is nervous about going into the depths, so Annabeth hands him a stress ball to relax. Percy gives each of them one of the pearls he got from the Sea Spirit to help them escape when the time comes, keeping the other two for himself and his mom, before they all descend into the Underworld.

In the past, Sally Jackson takes a young Percy to a boarding school in the countryside. Percy refuses to go, but Sally tries to convince him it's for his own good. They argue, and he locks himself in the car. Sally orders him to open the door, and he angerly relents. In the Underworld, the trio arrive just across the River Styx, outside the walls to Hades' realm. Grover's squeaky stress ball threatens to give them away, so Annabeth decides to hang on to it. They spot Charon, the ferryman to the Underworld, leading a new group of souls to the long line waiting for entry. They sneak along the line to the front, but are confronted by the undead boatman, who immediately notices they are not dead. Despite their attempted bribe to let them pass, he calls for Cerberus, the giant, three-headed dog and guardian of the Underworld, and the massive dog chases them along the river and eats Grover. Annabeth and Percy split up, and Percy is cornered by the monster. However, Cerberus is placated by Annabeth climbing up and scratching him, putting him to sleep. Grover is able to pull himself out of Cerberus' mouth, but Annabeth's arm is getting tired. Grover uses the flying shoes to fly him and Percy to the top of the wall, but Cerberus wakes up before he can go back for Annabeth. She throws the squeaky ball up to the top, and the giant dog leaps up to get it, Annabeth jumping off near the top. She takes the ball and throws it into the Styx, and Cerberus happily runs after it. Grover and Percy are amazed, and she sadly says her dad had a dog like him when she was little. They find themselves at the edge of Hades' kingdom, and see his palace in the distance. As they prepare to continue, Grover realizes his lost his pearl when Cerberus ate him.

In the past, Percy sits outside an office while Sally talks to the principle of the boarding school, who informs her they have decided to revoke Percy's admittance due to a recent call from his old school that he has psychological problems. Sally tells him she has already taken her son out of his previous school and he has nowhere else to go. The principle suggests she homeschool him, but Sally says she can't, to Percy's disappointment. In the Underworld, Grover insists they leave him behind after they find the bolt, as they now do not have enough pearls for all three of them and Sally. Percy refuses, and gives Grover his pearl instead. He tells him and Annabeth to leave with his mom after they find her and the bolt, and says he will find another way out. Before they can discuss it further, they realize the forest they are in is full of the souls of dead humans, rooted to the ground and unaware of the childrens' presence. Annabeth tells them they are in one of the Fields of Asphodel. The souls here are people who have intense regret for choices they made or didn't make in life, forever trapped by the roots. They hear Cerberus coming after them and make a run for it, but Annabeth falls behind. The boys go back and find her stuck in place, her leg caught by the roots. Grover realizes she must have regret for something, but they can't get her free. She tells him and Percy to go on, while she uses her pearl to escape. Percy hesitates, but she orders them to leave her. They get to the border of the forest as Annabeth uses her pearl and disappears, and they boys keep running as Cerberus continues his pursuit. They make it out of Asphodel and wonder through a vast, desert-like region. The three-headed dog has stopped chasing them, but before they can figure out why, the flying shoes Grover is wearing activate and start pulling him over a ridge. Percy runs after him as the shoes drag Grover towards a gargantuan chasm. Percy grabs onto the satyr and jams his sword into the ground to hold on, as the shoes finally pull themselves off of Grover's hooves and plummet themselves into the pit. As the two recover, Percy feels something heavy appear in his backpack. they they open it up, and are astonished to find the Master Bolt. Percy remembers it was Ares who gave him the backpack, and must have had the Master Bolt the whole time, tricking them into taking it to the Underworld. Grover points out that Zeus would be expecting them to return immediately with the bolt. However, they need to find Sally first.

Sally takes Young Percy to a cafe, having secured him a place at boarding school. Percy mopes as his mom tells him to give it a chance, saying it's for the best. He asks her why she is trying so hard to get rid of him. Sally goes to the counter to pay, and tries to keep her emotions together as Percy waits silently back at the table. In the present, Percy and Grover approach Hades' palace, and are granted entry. They arrive in Hades' throne room and are greeted by the god of the dead, who casually invites them to join him when Percy demands to see his mom. He shows them to a makeshift drawing room, with Sally suspended as a golden statue on display. Hades tells Percy he saved Sally from the Minotaur, and kept her in the Underworld so that Percy would come to see him and hand over what he stole. He offers a simple trade, but after considering, Percy refuses his offer. He says he understands how Hades and Ares manages to get the Master Bolt and tricked him into delivering it to Hades, but he can't hand over the bolt, and pleads with Hades to let Sally go. Hades is confused, as he has not been conspiring with Ares, and in fact has no interest in the Master Bolt. He was offering to trade Sally for his Helm of Darkness, his symbol of authority and a powerful magic item, which he presumes Percy stole and used its power to turn invisible and steal the Master Bolt from Zeus. Percy and Grover don't understand Hades' disinterest in the bolt, also assuming Hades wants a war out of a grudge against his brothers, but the Lord of the Dead is perfectly comfortable in the Underworld and doesn't want to get involved in his siblings' squabbles. Whoever stole the bolt, it wasn't him. Percy finally puts the pieces together, and realizes that the defeated Titan lord Kronos is behind the theft. He is shattered but still alive in the depths of Tartarus, the entrance of which the flying shoes tried to pull him and Grover into just before the bolt appeared in their bag. The voice he's been hearing in his dreams was not Hades, but was in fact Kronos himself, wanting his help to destroy Olympus. Hades takes the revelation somberly, and after a moment offers Percy a new deal. He will provide sanctuary for Percy, Grover, and Sally if Percy gives him the bolt. If Kronos is coming back, Percy will need someone to protect him, and Hades will need to bolt as a weapon or bargaining chip. This time the offer is non-negotiable, as Hades won't let them leave with the Master Bolt. Percy rejects this offer but promises to honor his first one. He will find Hades' helm, and will return for his mother. He gives the signal, and he and Grover use the pearls to escape the Underworld before Hades can stop them.

Sally stands at the counter of the cafe, trying to stay calm. She lights a match from the counter and drops it into the remnants of a discarded sundae, making it a burnt offering. Instantly, a rainstorm begins outside, and a man walks in completely dry to stand beside her. Poseidon, Percy's father. Sally expresses her distress at seemingly failing to protect her son, but Poseidon tries to reassure her. She says she is going to take him to Camp Half-Blood, and tells the god of the sea about the Pegasus that followed him to school. If he stays with her in the middle of the city, eventually the more dangerous things will find him. However, she doesn't want to send him to camp. Poseidon asks her why, and she says that she wants him to have a chance to find his own way before the Olympians try to change him, and use him for their own gain. Poseidon listens intently, and encourages Sally to follow her instincts and send Percy to school instead of to camp. It will be difficult for them both, but he will become a stronger and better person for it. Sally asks him if he wants to speak to his son, to finally got to know him, but Poseidon says one day, when Percy has found out who he is and what he must do, when he needs him, Poseidon will be there. In the present, Percy and Grover wake up on the seashore and find Annabeth. As they rise, Ares approaches them, sword drawn. Percy uncaps his own sword, and prepares for battle."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28324381/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,Mount Olympus beckons... and Percy must face his greatest battle yet.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Jet Wilkinson'],"['', '', '']",[],"['greek mythology', 'demi god', 'male protagonist', 'supernatural fantasy', '21st century', 'father son relationship', 'sword fight', 'child in jeopardy', 'half human', 'training camp', 'supernatural power', 'teen adventure', 'twist villain', 'teen fantasy', 'lightning', 'zeus the greek deity', 'epic fantasy', 'lightning bolt', 'brother brother relationship', 'satyr', 'betrayal', 'mount olympus', 'live action fantasy', 'based on novel', 'based on book']",[],"At Camp Half-Blood, before going on the quest for the Master Bolt, Luke trains Percy in sword fighting. Percy has trouble picking it up, and doesn't understand why form would be important in a fight against opponents that don't fight fair. Luke pushes Percy to try harder, and tells him he needs to know the rules of combat so he can use them to his advantage. Percy asks Luke to show him an example.

On the shore of the sea, Percy challenges Ares to single combat in exchange for their lives and Hades' Helm of Darkness, first blood wins. The god of war is incredulous, but humorously accepts the challenge, warning Percy there cannot be any trace of him left to tell of Ares' plan to steal the bolt. Percy tells him he knows it was Kronos' plan, not Ares', asking if the Titan Lord spoke to him in his dreams like he did to Percy. Ares angerly insists that gods do not dream, and the two clash. Percy holds his own at first, narrowly avoiding being impaled on Ares' sword, but the war god's strength proves too much for the young half-blood. When Percy is kicked to the edge of the surf, the sea grows restless. As he rises, Percy summons the water into a massive tidal wave that smashes down upon Ares, washing him away. Before Ares can fully recover, Percy is able to deflect his sword and draw first blood, winning the challenge. Annabeth and Grover celebrate Percy's victory, but Ares warns Percy that he has made a permanent enemy of the god of war, before transforming into his true divine form and disappearing, leaving the helm behind. As they gather it, Percy hears a woman's voice from along the shore, turning to see his and his mother's cabin, realizing they are on the beach at Montauk. They go to the cabin, and find Alecto inside. Percy hands over the Helm of Darkness, understanding it, not the bolt, was what she had been sent to recover. He asks her to remind Hades of their deal, and release his mother. Alecto takes the helm and leaves, wishing Percy luck on Olympus. Grover and Annabeth try to talk Percy out of going to Zeus' palace to return the bolt. They have already missed their deadline, and Zeus will certainly kill him, either because he thinks he is the lightning thief, or merely because he is a forbidden child. Percy tells them he has to try and get Zeus to call off the war, as the last full-scale conflict between the gods began World War 2 on earth. Aside from that, Kronos wants the gods to fight as part of his plan to return from Tartartus. If they are to have any chance of stopping him, Percy must make an appeal to Zeus. Annabeth gives him her camp necklace for good luck, and Percy heads to the Empire State Building. He shows the guard the Master Bolt, and is let onto the elevator to the 600th floor. Percy exits the elevator onto Mount Olympus, a vast and beautiful city in the sky.

Before the quest, Luke continues teaching Percy about the gods and demigods. Percy realizes that the gods are all powerful, but must adhere to rules and laws that govern the use of their powers. Their children however, are not beholden to such rules. Percy asks if that means the half-bloods should deserve as much fear and respect as the gods themselves. Luke is proud of Percy for learning so quickly, but warns him to be careful of such ways of thinking. He likens the situation to Annabeth's intense fear of spiders; despite being so much bigger than them, she still fears them, though she still has the power to easily kill one when she runs into it. He tells Percy not to be both small and scary at the same time. In the present, Percy goes to Zeus' throne on the peak of the mountain, and presents the Master Bolt. He tells the king of the gods that he didn't steal it, and tried to return it on time, but Zeus points out his failure to do so before the deadline. He takes the bolt from Percy, who tells him about Kronos's attempt to rise from the Underworld. Zeus dismisses him, and seems unsurprised to hear his titan father is gathering strength, saying that's simple what immortals do, try to overthrow eachother. Nevertheless, he still intends to pursue his war with Poseidon. For returning the bolt, Percy will be allowed to leave alive. Percy demands he stop the war, but Zeus won't listen and will not negotiate, warning the young demigod to leave while he can. Percy is persistent, telling him Kronos wants the gods to weaken eachother and points out the easy betrayal of Ares, Zeus's own son. He tells him all the other gods follow him out of fear, not loyalty. If they fight, then once Kronos returns, the other gods will serve the more powerful being, and Zeus will cast down by his own family. Angered, Zeus moves to smite Percy where he stands, but is stopped by Poseidon. The sea god formally surrenders to his brother, asking only for his son's life in return. Zeus points out Percy should never have been born, but Poseidon reminds Zeus of his own child, Thalia, and the heroic deeds of her and other Half-Bloods like Percy. Satisfied enough with Poseidon's submission, they discuss the matter of their defeated father. Zeus leaves to call for a council of the gods, but warns Poseidon to make sure Percy never comes into his presence again. After he disappears, Poseidon finally comes face to face with his son. He recognizes Percy's stubborn nature, a trait inherent from the sea itself. Percy asks his dad if gods dream, and Poseidon tells him they do, no matter what Ares might say. Percy then asks if his father ever dreamt of Sally. The sea god does not answer, but becomes emotional at the question. Reluctantly, Poseidon tells Percy he should leave, and sends him back to Half-Blood Hill with another pearl.

Percy enters camp to a hero's welcome, and Annabeth is there waiting for him. He sees that Clarisse is still roaming free at camp, and Annabeth takes him to see Luke and explain. Luke tells him that while they were gone, the entire camp was on a knife's edge under the threat of their parents going to war. He couldn't risk accusing the head of the Ares cabin, Clarisse, without proof, or risk setting off their own war in camp. However, now that Percy has stopped the war, they can let Chiron know to bring her in. Annabeth volunteers to stay behind and watch Clarisse while Luke and Percy meet Chiron away from the main camp, and talk to him without Clarisse's cabin mates finding out. That night, as the celebrations commence, Luke takes Percy deep into the woods to wait for Chiron. Percy confides in Luke that he's still thinking about the prophecy, assuming that him ""failing to save what matters most in the end"" means Hades will never return his mother. Luke is empathetic, but tells him not to put too much stock in prophecies. Percy tells him that everything the Oracle told him has come true, but then remembers he forgot one line; ""You shall be betrayed by one who calls you friend"". He realizes that Chiron isn't coming to meet them, Luke never told him about Clarisse, because he knew she didn't steal the Master Bolt. Luke did. He helped Ares get the bolt into Percy's backpack, ready to appear as soon as the flying shoes Luke gave him pulled him into Tartarus, right down to Kronos. Luke tells him he was supposed to be wearing the shoes, not Grover, but says he never wanted to hurt Percy. He wanted to recruit him. He shows him his new sword, Backbiter, made of both Celestial Bronze and Steel, a magic item capable of tearing open secret doors in thin air. He starts to open one, and tells Percy they can escape through it and begin taking down the gods, with Kronos' help. The gods care only for themselves, demanding loyalty and great deeds and giving nothing in return, even to their own children. Percy doesn't want any part of Luke's plan to overthrow their parents, but Luke tells him the gods fear their offspring uniting against them. Kronos will bring back his golden age, without the selfish, petulant gods in charge. Percy says Kronos has gotten to him, but Luke tells him he finally knows the truth. He was able to steal the Helm and the Bolt all by himself, but for the next step, they will need help. Before he can finish cutting open the door, Percy draws his sword and stands in Luke's way. He tells him that despite their parents' flaws, they are trying their best, and still love them. He tells Luke he spoke to Hermes, but at the mention of his father, Luke attacks. Percy tries to hold him off, but Luke finishes opening the portal. He gives Percy one last chance to come with him, but Percy counter attacks, staggering Luke back. Thinking he's hurt his friend, Percy lowers his guard, and Luke takes advantage and disarms and injures Percy. He hesitates striking the killing blow, and suddenly deflects a dagger thrown by Annabeth, who used her invisibility cap and heard Luke's confession. Luke is stunned as she draws her own sword to defend Percy, and he bolts through the portal, which closes behind him.

On the last day of Summer, Percy packs to go home. Chiron comes to say goodbye. Percy reminds him he may be back if Hades hasn't held up his end of the bargain and returned his mother, but he needs to find out regardless. Chiron doesn't want Percy to go alone in case Luke comes looking for him, but Percy doesn't think Luke wants to kill him. Chiron is worried that Luke, and more importantly, Kronos, will want to sway Percy to their side as the son of Poseidon would make for a powerful ally. Percy assures him he won't be so easily persuaded to turn on them, and Chiron is proud of how far his student has come. Dionysus arrives to send away all the campers except those that will be staying year-round. Percy finds Annabeth at Thalia's tree on the border of camp. She is also packed to go home, having decided to give living with her dad and step-family another try. Percy is happy for her, and encourages he to just be a kid while she's gone. Grover meets them, and shows them his newly awarded Searcher's License. He will leave right away to begin his search for Pan, planning to skip the over-examined wildlands and try the seas instead. Percy tells him to let him know if he ever needs help. The three make a pact to meet eachother at Thalia's tree next year, no matter what, before saying goodbye.

Percy goes to the cabin at Montauk and finds Sally inside, and they tearfully reunite. After this, Percy finds himself once again in a dream, where he is greeted by the skeletal figure that's been haunting him; Kronos. He tells the titan lord to accept his defeat, but Kronos says they will meet again one day, in person, so long as the young demigod lives long enough. Percy warns him he won't be killed so easily, but Kronos is pleased. He needs Percy to survive, as he is an essential part of his return. Percy is woken up by his mom in their apartment, and he tells her he had another dream about Kronos, though he doesn't tell her what his titan grandfather said. Sally makes him blue pancakes, and the two leave to take Percy to his first day at a new school."

As the story unfolds, Brock and Reba reveal that they are separated due to Brock's midlife crisis and while in court the entire family Reba, Brock, Cheyenne, Jake and Kyra got into what the judge described as a brawl.

While in therapy Brock reveals that he won't be moving back home because he has to marry his dental hygienist/assistant Barbra Jean. Why? She's pregnant. And...Oops, little Jake lets it slip that Cheyenne, the Hart's 17-year-old daughter, is pregnant as well.

Cheyenne and Van, her all-star football-playing boyfriend decides that they're going to get married. Reba organizes a shotgun wedding while trying to keep terminally perky Barbra Jean at a safe distance.

Van's parents won't come to the wedding and have kicked him out of the house but, on the bright side, he managed to arrange a honeymoon at his uncle's beach house in Galveston. On the wedding day, Cheyenne is upset that her Dad hasn't arrived yet. Reba starts to lose it when she burns some of the food. Brock arrives with Barbra Jean. Cheyenne and Van get into an argument because Van plans to play football on their wedding night. Things are thrown, and Barbra Jean falls into the cake. Reba finally loses it, shouting at everyone.

When Reba insists that Cheyenne be allowed to stay, the principal suspends the pregnant teen for three weeks, enough time to ruin her grades. First, Brock brings Barbra Jean into the group, making Reba more than unhappy. Then they begin discussing Cheyenne's situation and Reba comes up with an idea. If they keep Van out of school as long as Cheyenne is out of school, the principal will have to give in and let them both back. Why? They'll lose their chance at a football championship without star cornerback Van. Cheyenne and Van have been staying at home in protest, but as the next big game approaches without any word from the Principal Hodge, everyone begins to get nervous and doubt Reba's plan. At the last minute the principal arrives (she was booed by the football crowd during pre-game warm-ups) and says that Cheyenne is welcome back to school. But suddenly Cheyenne says she won't go back. When Reba takes her aside to ask why, Cheyenne admits that before all this happened she was a role model to the younger girls and what kind of role model is she now that she's a married and pregnant 17-year-old?

While on a visit to the gynecologist, Reba also discovers that Cheyenne and Barbra Jean are sharing the same doctor... and Brock has brought little Jake to the appointment. When Cheyenne accuses Reba of being a control freak and running Brock out of the marriage, Reba goes to therapy by herself. The therapist agrees that Reba is too controlling and suggests that she just let go of a few things; do something for herself like go to a movie. Van and Cheyenne are fighting because she's finally told him that she doesn't like the things he's added to their room. Reba goes to a movie, leaving the kids to fend for themselves for dinner. In a panic, Cheyenne calls Brock for help. Cheyenne and Brock both complain about Reba's controlling behavior, but when Cheyenne says that she thinks it's the reason her parents marriage ended, Brock gets serious for a minute and corrects her.

When she shows him the picture he denies that he even knew BJ and insists that he didn't start seeing her until he moved out of the house and into his condo. Reba doesn't believe him and takes Lori Ann up on her offer of a night on the town. Reba is drowning her sorrows when BJ herself walks into the bar. She explains that she's not here to defend what she's done, but for Brock. BJ insists that Brock was telling the truth and that they weren't at the convention together. She then tells Reba that she was there with another married dentist. Apparently she has thing for dentists because she rattles off a list of former flames. Reba shows up at Brock's condo with his recovered set of golf clubs and apologizes for not believing him. She doesn't give up BJ's past, but tells Brock that what changed her mind doesn't matter.

When Reba gets home and calls the credit card company to report her card number stolen, she finds out that someone has been on a spree, spending $4000 on a diamond tiara and $175 at a religious gift shop. Who would do such a thing? Barbra Jean of course. Reba shows up at his door spitting fire because his mistress has run up the limit on her credit card. They had decided that during the divorce they would each get one card and Brock accidentally gave BJ the one for Reba's account. BJ tries to explain that the tiara was meant to dress up her simple wedding suit and lets it slip that they're planning on saying their vows in St. Thomas at dental convention in two weeks. Reba's shocked that they were going to sneak off and wonders how Brock thinks he can get married when their divorce isn't final. He tries to explain that all she has to do is sign a form and he can marry BJ before their divorce is final. Cheyenne answers a call from the principal pretending to be Reba. It's actually Kyra's school and they want to know why she didn't attend that day. Cheyenne covers for her, saying Kyra was sick and she (Reba) forgot to call in. Kyra says she went to the downtown library because Maya Angelou was there. Cheyenne and Van decide it's a great opportunity to test their parenting skills and force Kyra to do a number of chores as ""punishment."" After cleaning their room and doing their laundry Kyra decides that telling Reba is better than being under the thumb of Cheyenne and Van. Reba gets a call from a hysterical BJ who's been arrested by mall security for using Reba's stolen credit card. Reba visits her in mall jail and finds herself feeling sorry for BJ because Brock wants to get the wedding over with. Reba encourages her to ask for the wedding of her dreams. Brock stops by Reba's house and she tells him that she'll sign the form. Brock says it's not necessary since she was so nice to BJ, he decided that he'll give her the wedding of her dreams. Reba has talked her way into allowing Brock to have a wedding in town to his mistress with all their friends... he even asks her to sing. Oops. Kyra admits to skipping school and Reba says she'll let it slide this time. Cheyenne and Van are shocked at her lenience until she turns to them and asks how she should punish a big sister and brother-in-law who blackmailed Kyra to do their chores?"

They're taking a vacation and on the way they plan on stopping by Reba's to see the family. Reba's excited about her parents' visit until her mom starts making comments about what makes a good marriage. Thinking her mother is disappointed that she didn't keep her marriage together, Reba takes the comments to heart. Nevertheless, she plans a lunch to celebrate the anniversary and tells Brock that he should stop by and say hi, but not to bring Barbra Jean. Van's terrified of Cheyenne's grandparents because he's sure they disapprove of the marriage and Cheyenne's pregnancy, blaming him. Grandma assures him that she and her husband got married young as well. She gives Cheyenne a locket that her husband gave her a few years after they got married. It contained a real diamond ring, since they were too poor to have a real one when they first wed. Cheyenne admires the amount of memories her grandparents have, so she tries to create some of her own with Van by giving him a heart-shaped keychain with a poem she wrote herself. Van mocks the keychain, but when he hands her his own handmade gift she's equally as unimpressed. Brock stops by to say hi to Reba's parents and their reception is pretty cold at first. Just as they're starting to warm up to Brock again, Barbra Jean pops in the house with a pie she's made. They manage to get invited to the anniversary brunch where the conversation's tense at best. Barbra Jean doesn't seem to notice the cold disapproval around her, as usual. When Reba's mom discovers that BJ's an outlet mall bargain hunter they decide to go shopping together. Reba tags along, only to be shocked at how well BJ and her mom get along. When they return from the mall, Reba accuses her mom of liking BJ too much and insinuating that it's Reba's fault her marriage didn't last. Her mom explains that when she first saw BJ, she thought Reba was letting herself get made a fool of, that she wasn't standing up for herself. But now she realizes that Reba's stronger than she thought possible because she's allowing BJ into her life. Van and Cheyenne agree that their memories will get made, without forcing them to happen.

Cheyenne is mortified that her mother's going to be around, but Reba assures her that she put Brock through dental school by teaching and she's always intended to go back to it. Cheyenne won't even know she's there. Reba's first day was full of pranks and mishaps and she absolutely loved it. When she arrives home Brock is waiting. Kyra called him to say that they're turning into latchkey kids and he's concerned that Reba's not home. She assures him that it'll all work out fine.

Van and Cheyenne's friends Marisa and Eric are deeply in love. They're hanging out a Reba's house and announce that they've decided to get married. After a little questioning by Reba, she discovers that part of the reason they want to get married is to have sex and the other part is because Cheyenne and Van seem to be having so much fun. Reba convinces Van and Cheyenne to clue them into the realities of married life. She then explains how unlikely it is that a marriage would last and urges them to think about it some more.

When Van and Cheyenne try to explain to their friends how hard married life is, it's revealed that Cheyenne feels smothered by Van and Van wishes he'd shopped around a little more before settling down. They argue and start to question why they got married (other than the pregnancy of course).

Reba is pulled out of class by the principal and told that she's being fired. Apparently Marisa's mother called the school because she walked in on Marisa and Eric about to have sex. From what they understand, Reba told them they didn't have to be married to have sex. Reba tries to explain that they came to her for advice and she counseled them not to get married, but she never said they should have sex outside of marriage. Unfortunately, having Van and Cheyenne as married pregnant teenagers in her house isn't setting a good example and Reba is fired anyway.

Reba comes home, saddened by losing her job. Brock tells her that he supports her going back to teaching. Reba explains that she was fired and tells him why. She wonders if she's making it too easy for Van and Cheyenne. Brock tells her that by taking them in, she was making a very brave decision and thanks her for it. Out on the front porch, Van comes home to find Cheyenne sitting there. She asks him why he married her and he asks her the same question. They figure out that they still want to be married and repeat their own version of they vows to each other."

Having known John D. for over 20 years, Reba prepares a small funeral ceremony including a few friends and family. The arrangements are almost complete when Brock comes by with BJ (deep in mourning even though she never met John D). BJ puts together an elaborate funeral complete with white doves and a Baptist choir. Reba takes Brock aside and convinces him that this isn't what John D. would've wanted. She mentions that he'd have been happy to buried on a golf course. Brock thinks this is a great idea and immediately has John D. cremated. He begs Reba to help him spread the ashes on the 12th hole at the country club. Reba gives in, but the cops arrive and arrest them for illegally spreading ashes.

He assures her that he can take care of himself. He is accosted by four thugs, one of whom draws a revolver and shoots him.

Phoebe and Piper plan a surprise party for Prue. Phoebe goes to the Neptune Hotel to take a job as a psychic, in order to pay for a present for Prue. She gets a vision from the manager and lands the job.

Piper meets Phoebe at the hotel, worried about Phoebe's use of her powers. Mark's ghost shows up and only Piper and Phoebe can see him. Piper leaves and Mark pursues her; she doesn't believe him until a bicyclist rides right through him.

Mark tells Piper that his body must be found before Yama catches him and takes him to Hell. As soon as they find his body, Yama appears. Piper freezes Yama and she and Mark flee. Yama unfreezes and lowers his lance, but Mark and Piper are gone.

At the hotel, a man named Mr. Correy leaves his wallet behind. Phoebe picks it up and sees the man being hit by a car. She tries to warn him, but he is suspicious.

Prue finds flowers on her desk and Andy waiting in her office. He apologizes for not telling Prue about his ex-wife.

She joins her sisters and a waitress, Skye, brings Prue a glass of wine bought by a strange man across the room. The man, Whitaker Berman, waves to Prue from his wheelchair. Prue is flattered, but turns it down; she's dating Andy. Skye brings the wine back to Berman. He asks her to join him, but she is not allowed to be involved with the customers. Late that night, Berman appears in Skye's dream. They go to a surreal building-top landscape. He twirls her around and then throws her off the building, killing Skye for real. Andy and Darryl find her body. Although she is still in bed and the door is locked, nearly every bone in her body is broken, as if she jumped off a building. Berman attacks Skye in her dreams Piper and Phoebe cast a love spell. Wind blows through the attic, but nothing else seems to happen. The telephone rings, but the caller is Berman and he is looking for Prue. She refuses him again. Phoebe leaves for Quake to see if the spell worked.

Prue is enjoying a bubble bath and falls asleep. Berman appears; Prue denies that he is real. Berman is able to read Prue's thoughts, memories, etc. He grabs a sponge and rubs Prue's back with it so hard that she bleeds. He then tries to drown her, but Piper knocks and wakes Prue up. Prue sees the scratches on her back. Piper suspects that Prue is merely overworked.

Prue attacked while taking a bath A large, muscular man walks into the kitchen, where Prue and Piper are talking, followed by a very happy Phoebe. The man's name is Hans and had come into Quake to use a pay phone, and bumped into Phoebe there and they hooked up. At Quake, a regular customer, Jack, asks Piper to have dinner with him. Another asks her to fly to Paris with him. Andy and Darryl have found several other young women dead in the same way as Skye. They visit a ""dream lab"" where Berman works. The first woman had been Berman's girlfriend. Berman had been in the lab when Skye died.

Piper has dinner with Jack and tries to turn him off, but he is insistent, and kisses her. Several other men try to get her attention. Piper now thinks the spell wasn't such a good idea.

Hans and Phoebe kiss Berman enters the dream lab and asks for an extra dose of the drug that sends him into dreaming sleep. Prue has fallen asleep at her desk and Berman enters her dream. He tells her she's powerless against him; he knows that she's a witch because he can get inside her mind. Prue stabs Berman with a letter opener and he is about to throw her off the building when the telephone rings--it's Andy, calling to check up on her. Prue hears someone coming and whirls around with the letter opener--but it's Rex. Prue looks down and sees Berman's blood on the tip of the letter opener.

Andy has learned what Berman is researching: ""dream leaping"". He says the girlfriend had died just after breaking up with Berman.

Prue using her power on the Dream Sorcerer Phoebe comes home to find flowers everywhere, from men whom Piper has never met. Hans was all over Phoebe and she ditched him. Even Kit has tomcats after her. The two decide to reverse the spell.

Prue drives home and falls asleep at the wheel. Hans appears at the door, angry, and Piper freezes him. Piper and Phoebe leave in search of Prue, who has driven into a pole. Prue is taken to a hospital. She is only semi-conscious and Berman appears to her again. Andy and Darryl visit Berman again and order the techs to wake him up.

Elliot's mother, Grace Spencer, joins them and asks if they've gotten a marriage license yet. Just then, a mysterious blonde appears in the driveway. The woman, Jade, reminds Mrs. Spencer that 20 years earlier, they made a pact in which Mrs. Spencer would receive great wealth and power in return for her eldest son's hand in marriageand Jade is now here to collect. Jade gestures and Elliot collapses.

Phoebe's premonition of the demon child being born. Piper takes a pregnancy test. She fears she may be carrying the child of Jeremy Burns (""Something Wicca This Way Comes""), her ex-boyfriend who proved to be a warlock. Phoebe finds the box in the trash and has a vision of a demon child being born. Piper prepares to cater the Spencer wedding. She is stretched thin, especially since Chef Moore, who was originally supposed to cater the wedding, is in Europe. Piper asks Phoebe for help. As Piper enters the Spencer estate, a priest, Father Trask, appears. He tries to warn Piper of Hecate, as security guards throw him out.

Prue is in the midst of cataloging a fertility icon. It's mere presence is supposed to ensure a woman conceives. Rex walks in and says the goddess is no longer available, and reminds Hannah that it was acquired for someone else. Phoebe drops into Prue's office, and tells Prue about her premonition.

Allison demands an explanation for why Elliot is suddenly due to marry Jade, but Grace only says that Jade is an old family friend and gives Allison the brushoff.

Phoebe and Piper learn of the change of bride. They go to meet her and Grace. The two are alarmed that Chef Moore won't be handling the wedding, but Piper and Phoebe reassure them. A seamstress is altering Jade's dress and sticks her with a pin, but Jade doesn't even flinch.

Allison manages to sneak into Elliot's room. Just as they start to talk, Grace, Jade and Kirsten, one of the bridesmaids, walk in and hustle her back out. Elliot begs Kirsten not to harm Allison, and a visibly, angry Jade pulls him back into the room.

Father Trask sneaks back into the estate in a delivery truck. He puts on a deliveryman's uniform and takes a large dagger with him. He finds Jade and raises the dagger, calling her Hecate. However, Jade doesn't seem to be at all alarmed. Kirsten fades in behind Father Trask. She morphs into a demon and breaks his neck. Jade has him thrown from her window.

Phoebe and Piper discover the priests body. Piper and Phoebe run into Allison, who tells them of her plight. Piper wants to help; she thinks this is something they're supposed to do as good witches.

Jade tells Andy and Darryl that Trask had lunged at her with the knife, but she ducked out of the way and he flew out the window. The two cops are skeptical, as Trask had landed too far from the window.

Prue wants to know if the fertility icon's male counterpart can still be catalogued, and Rex approves. He mentions the female icon was a gift for Elliot's bride. Prue says that Piper is catering that wedding, but she won't be going. Rex runs into Hannah, and confirms that Prue won't be there. However, he thinks it's too risky for them to go.

Prue is pulling an inventory tag off the male icon's ""artifact"", when Andy walks in with the dagger. She reads an inscription on its blade: ""Nec prius absistit quoad protero prodigium"", which she translates as ""I shall not rest until the demon is vanquished"" (though more adequate translation would be: ""The demon will not rest until I have vanquished him.""). She searches the Web on her laptop, and finds out about Hecate.

Prue draws Hecate into the dagger with her power. The dagger is actually a poingnard, which is the only thing that can destroy her. Piper notes that the napkins and the catering contract both mention Allison, not Jade. Phoebe tells Piper of her vision, and Piper assures her that she's not pregnant. Phoebe realizes that she had not in fact seen Piper in her vision. Prue tells what she has found out about Hecate -- and that based on her research, Jade is really Hecate in human form. Hecate comes to Earth every 200 years so she can marry the first-born son of a prominent family and use him to have a child. The child may look human, but will be pure demon.

The sisters spy on Jade's bachelorette party. A ""pizza deliveryman"" comes in, and starts taking off his clothes. Jade and the bridesmaids approach -- and then Jade sinks her claws into the stripper, killing him.

The next day, the sisters make plans to crash the wedding. Allison can break Hecate's spell with a declaration of true love, sealed with a kiss.

Prue and Andy leave to talk Prue calls Allison to the manor and convinces her to crash the wedding. Phoebe and Piper talk to Mrs. Spencer, who seems to agree to stop the wedding. She tells Piper and Phoebe to meet her in the wine cellar. Piper and Phoebe slip into the cellar, but two of the bridesmaids follow them. Piper tries, unsuccessfully, to freeze the bridesmaids, but she's too far away. Piper and Phoebe run and hide. Prue and Allison reach the Spencer estate; Prue calls Piper's cell phone and Piper tells her where she is. Piper, at last, freezes the bridesmaids as Prue enters the cellar and flings them into a wall. The sisters and Allison interrupt the wedding. Jade raises a windstorm and grabs Elliot, while the guests scatter.

The sisters find Jade and Elliot in an upstairs room, just as Jade is morphing into her demon form and about to impregnate Elliot. The bridesmaids, also in demon form, rush in after them. Prue cannot find the dagger it's on the floor next to Elliot. Elliot raises the dagger, and Prue draws Jade and the bridesmaids into it. The wedding proceeds with Allison. Andy stops by and Prue gives him the dagger."

She chants and Kali appears in a mirror. Aviva has been studying the Charmed Ones at Kali's instruction. Aviva reaches for the mirror and Kali grants her a power.

Aviva conjures Kali Kali tells Aviva to go to the sisters. As Aviva leaves, flames shoot up behind Kali, and her eyes turn fiery red. Kit has gone missing for several days. Leo looks up the fireplace for her while Piper checks him out. Phoebe walks into the living room and also eyeballs Leo. Piper offers Leo a snack, but Leo wants to puts out flyers the sisters have printed up for Kit. Aviva sees one of the flyers and sets it on fire just by looking at it.

Piper brings Leo a snack just as Prue and Phoebe come downstairs. Leo is painting a wall. Phoebe tries to hit on Leo. Prue notices, and pulls Phoebe into the kitchen. Prue knows that Piper is falling in love with Leo, and suspects Phoebe is trying to steal him away like she believes Phoebe tried to steal Roger.

The girls check out Leo's ""Bottom"". Piper comes in, and Phoebe asks if she thinks she steals their boyfriends. Piper accuses Phoebe of stealing one of hers back in high school. Prue heads out to get ready for a night with Andy and reminds Piper and Phoebe that she wants the manor to herself tonight. Piper and Phoebe agree to a friendly competition of sorts for Leo's affection. Aviva is writing in her diary when her Aunt Jackie walks in. Aviva is staying at Aunt Jackie's place while her mother is in rehab, and Aviva is upset that Aunt Jackie won't call or visit her. Aunt Jackie, in turn, doesn't understand why Aviva is so hostile to her.

Prue and Andy look through a video store for a movie. Andy is increasingly frustrated that they can never have any time with each other before something comes up that calls Prue away.

Aviva brings Kit back. Aviva summons Kali again. Kali tells Aviva she must get the sisters to accept her into their coven. The closet door opens and Kit is there. Kali tells Aviva to take Kit back to the manor.

Piper walks in on Leo finishing up and asks him if he wants to go see a movie. Aviva arrives with Kit; she claims to have found her two hours ago and fed her before coming over. Piper offers a reward, but Aviva declines. Prue and Andy walk in. Prue offers to pay Aviva, but instead Aviva blurts out that she wants to talk about magical stuff. The sisters try to shoo Aviva out, but Aviva instead makes Andy's popcorn tray start popping. Piper freezes the room but Aviva doesn't freeze.

Aviva wants to try a spell with Phoebe. Aviva wants to explain, but the sisters aren't interested. Prue brusquely orders her out. Aviva sets the tape Prue is holding ablaze and walks out just as the room unfreezes and popcorn blasts out all over Andy and Leo. Kali doesn't seem surprised that Prue shooed Aviva out. She thinks that Phoebe will be more understanding, however. Aviva is a bit nervous, but Kali reminds her that she was the one who wanted a family. In return, Kali wants to be able to tap into the magic of the Halliwell line.

The next morning, Prue tries to patch things up with Andy, and talks him into coming over that night.

Prue visits Aunt Jackie. Prue is still very angry at Aviva, but Phoebe points out that Aviva did bring Kit back. Prue suspects Aviva might be a warlock, but Piper points out that Aviva didn't freeze, which means she may very well be a good witch like them. Prue is still suspicious, and points out she might very well be evil. She talks Piper and Phoebe into keeping their distance from Aviva until they can find out more about her. As Prue and Piper head for work, Aviva calls Phoebe. Later that day, Phoebe and Aviva meet at Aviva's school. Aviva cuts the rest of the day and offers to tell Phoebe about herself.

Phoebe having the premonition of Prue being attacked by Aviva Leo comes to Quake to show Piper some samples of the stain originally used on the manor doors. Piper pays for the meal. Leo wonders if Phoebe works there, but Piper scoffs, suggesting that Phoebe is a lesbian. Later that night, Phoebe is showing Aviva around the manor. Phoebe tells Aviva that she and Piper are fighting over Leo. Aviva suggests that Phoebe tilt the odds by casting a spell on Leo. Phoebe wonders how Aviva knows that the sisters are witches. Aviva tells Phoebe that she's being trained by a high priestess. Phoebe wants to meet her, and they go up to Phoebe's room. Kali briefly appears in the mirror. Aviva has Phoebe touch a dead plant, and it comes back to life. Prue walks in on them and is angry to see Aviva there. Aviva tries to drive a wedge between Prue and Phoebe. As Phoebe tries to calm Prue down, Andy arrives; another night is ruined.

Phoebe taking the attack meant for Prue They agree to try again at Quake the next day. Aviva walks out.

Kali thinks that they'd have lured Phoebe to their side if Prue hadn't been around. Aviva is angry at Prue. Just then, Aunt Jackie barges in; she found out Aviva cut school and wants some answers. They argue, and Kali gestures, causing several candles to flare up. One of them sets Aunt Jackie's dress on fire. Aunt Jackie tries frantically to smother the flames, but falls down the stairs and is knocked out.

While the paramedics tend to Aunt Jackie, Kali tells Aviva to go back to the sisters. She's convinced that Phoebe is already on their side, and Piper will easily be won over. She wants Aviva to kill Prue and take her place in the Power of Three. Aviva goes to the manor and convinces the sisters to let her stay the night, promising not to use any magic.

Kali possesses Aviva Aviva is sleeping with Phoebe in Phoebe's room. Kali appears late at night and tells Aviva to go after Prue. Aviva tries to slip into Prue's room, but Piper finds her just as she raises a fireball. Aviva says she's looking for the bathroom and walks away.

The next morning, Prue visits Aunt Jackie in the hospital. Aunt Jackie tells of the strange chants and rituals that Aviva indulges in. At Quake, Piper can't raise Prue, even though Andy is there waiting for her. At that moment, Prue is in Aviva's room and finds Aviva's diary, and reads about her and Kali's plans to take over the sisters' coven.

The Charmed Ones vanquish Kali Prue calls Phoebe and tells her to call Piper, and to not let Aviva out of her sight. Aviva feigns exhaustion and goes up to Prue's room. Leo is sanding down a corner in the foyer, and wonders if Phoebe and Aviva are in a relationship. Phoebe scoffs, and suggests that Piper is on medication. She picks up Aviva's jacket and gets a premonition of Aviva throwing a fireball at Prue. She rushes upstairs, and Aviva throws a fireball. It hits Aviva's jacket and sets it ablaze. Horrified at she has done Aviva runs out the door. Phoebe is slightly burned on the arm. Prue, Piper and Leo are tending to her. Phoebe says that her sweater got too close to one of Aviva's candles. Leo heads out to get an estimate on his work. Phoebe tells Prue and Piper what really happened. Prue tells them that she thinks Kali is an evil spirit that is using Aviva. The sisters head for the attic.

Aviva is packing her witch stuff in a backpack; she doesn't want to use her powers anymore. Kali offers to leave if Aviva touches the mirror; instead, she possesses Aviva.

As a friendly gesture, they give Aviva a dress The sisters find Kali in the Book of Shadows. She is an evil sorceress who appears in reflections, like mirrors. She uses innocents as pawns to kill witches and take their powers. The only way to vanquish her is to ""shatter her reflection."" At that moment, Kali, in Aviva's body, enters the attic and throws fireballs all over the place. Aviva momentarily gains control only long enough to shout for help before Kali takes control again. Phoebe suggests that Piper freeze Kali. Piper is skeptical, since Aviva can't freeze. However, Phoebe thinks that Kali will freeze. Piper freezes Kali, ejecting her from Aviva. Prue flings Kali into a mirror, and Phoebe smashes it, destroying Kali.

The sisters give Aviva one of Prue's old dresses. Aviva admits she's going to miss her powers. Phoebe swears Aviva to secrecy.

The man, Gavin, speaks fulsomely about Dr. Mitchell's work and then opens a third eye on his forehead. A ray comes from the third eye and burns through Dr. Mitchell's skull, killing him. The sisters are getting ready to see a movie when Piper's boss at Quake, Martin, calls her inon her day off. A convention is in town and Quake is short-staffed. Prue and Phoebe are worried; Piper's been working a crazy schedule of late.

The sisters head to the movies, but Phoebe gets a premonition of Tanya being killed. She was supposed to talk to Martin about it weeks ago, but never got around to it. Phoebe happens to bump into Gavin and gets a premonition of a woman being killed. The police arrive and the sisters find Dr. Mitchell's dead body. Phoebe thinks her vision was of the next murder. Piper and Phoebe continue to argue over Leo. Prue thinks Phoebe only likes Leo because Piper does. Prue is unwilling to talk to Andy, feeling it's too soon after they broke up. Phoebe goes in her place to ask about Dr. Mitchell's murder. Prue looks through the Book of Shadows, but can't find anything. As she leaves, the Book flips on its own to a truth spell. Prue is skeptical and closes it back, only to see it reopen to the spell.

The Book of Shadows opens to the Truth Spell page Martin overworks Piper, and she doesn't complain.

Phoebe has talked to Darryl about the case. She passed Andy in the parking lot and tells Prue that he still cares about her. Phoebe also suggests that Prue tell Andy that she's a witch, if only to see how he handles it.

Prue casts the truth spell, not knowing that Phoebe and Piper are in the house and will also be affected. She calls Andy, but only reaches his answering machine. Piper asks if Phoebe can see a pimple on her chin. Phoebe is initially reluctant to answer, but just then the spell takes effect and to her shock says she can see it after all. Piper admits she didn't tell off Martin.

Prue recites the Truth Spell Gavin walks into a laboratory and finds Alex Pearson working there. He kills Alex with the third eye, but not before Alex rips a button off of Gavin's coat. Phoebe and Piper notice that they are unable to lie. Phoebe admits that she only likes Leo because Piper does. Prue admits to casting the truth spell, to determine if Andy is okay with her being a witch. For the next 24 hours, anyone who comes in contact with them will have no choice but to tell the truth.

Phoebe goes to Andy and asks him about the murders. Andy tells what he knows. Both of the victims had the same burn mark on their forehead, and it looked like all the life had been sucked out of them. He mentions the button, and says it's made of a strange alloy never seen before. She leaves, and Andy calls Prue. He offers to meet after interviewing a witness.

Phoebe and Piper are also affected by the Truth Spell. Just as Prue gets off the phone with Andy, Tanya Parker, the sandwich girl, stops by her office. Hannah follows, and snatches a sandwich Tanya was saving for Prue. Under the influence of the spell, Hannah admits that her mission in life is to destroy Prue. Rex pulls her aside and warns her to keep quiet. Hannah lights Rex's cigar, apparently with a magical power, by blowing on it.

Piper is called into Quake yet again. Leo comes in, asking to use the washing machine. Piper asks if Leo thinks of her; he does, and thinks Piper has beautiful eyes. She asks, ""What do you think about women who make the first move?"" Leo says, ""Im still waiting for it to happen."" and Piper kisses him.

Rex stops by the elevator to check on Prue. Under the influence of the spell, Prue nearly blurts out that she's a witch, but Phoebe cuts her off. Just as Phoebe despairs of finding the woman in her premonition, she sees Tanya walking by and recognizes her as the woman.

Piper makes the first move Phoebe rushes down to stop Gavin while Prue calls security. Phoebe finds Gavin and Tanya struggling, with Gavin getting the better of it. Just as Gavin starts to blast Tanya, Phoebe smashes a bottle over his head. They drive off to the manor. Phoebe explains that the man who attacked her was a demon. Tanya tries to run, but Phoebe convinces her to stay. Piper is overworked. Martin, under the spell, admits to overworking her to keep from spending money on more employees. Piper angrily quits.

Andy goes to Prue at Buckland. Prue demonstrates her power and explains that she is a witch. Andy becomes uncomfortable.

Prue shows Andy she is Telekinetic A biogenetics professor at Stanford has been killed. Three of the victims work in the biotech field, Piper and Phoebe don't see how they're connected to Tanya, a sandwich girl. Phoebe touches Tanya and gets a premonition of Tanya holding a newborn baby. Phoebe realizes that Tanya is pregnant, and also remembers the button the police found wasn't made of anything the cops had seen before. Phoebe suspects Gavin is from the future--and isn't after Tanya, but her baby.

Gavin comes into Prue's office. Under the influence of the truth spell, Gavin admits that he is from the future. He was sent to kill Tanya to keep her baby from being born, since he will someday create a vaccine.

Prue and Piper spear Gavin His other victims will help with the research that creates the vaccine. Gavin realizes something's up and charges at Prue, but she pins him against the wall with her desk and escapes. Piper can't reach Prue at work, and heads to Buckland's to check on her. Prue flees into a warehouse and hides from Gavin. Piper finds Prue's office empty. Prue asks Gavin what the vaccine is for and he admits that the vaccine will destroy warlocks like him. Gavin finds Prue and grabs her by the neck. He's about to blast her when Piper rushes in and freezes him, freeing Prue. Gavin unfreezes and the two shove a crowbar into his third eye, killing him.

Prue goes to Andy and asks how he feels about her being a witch. He is still uncomfortable. The truth spell expires in that moment and Andy doesn't remember what they were talking about, nor that Prue is a witch.

Andy and Prue break up Prue walks away. Martin, likewise, doesn't remember that Piper quit her job and orders her into the kitchen while she is having dinner with Prue. She demands that Martin hire some more people or she will quit. He agrees, to Piper's surprise, and she walks out of the kitchen. As she leaves, she smacks the door into Leo, who apparently does not remember the kiss. Piper offers to buy Leo a drink. Prue enters Quake and tells Phoebe about the rejection from Andy. Phoebe hugs Prue to comfort her."

(In the real Salem witch trials, no one was burned; all convicted ""witches"" were hanged.) Matthew Tate, her former lover, visits her in her cell. He seduced her, copied her powers and then outed her as a witch to keep from being exposed as a warlock. Melinda pulls off the locket Matthew gave her as a gift and gives it back to him. Matthew says he plans to copy other witches' powers as well. He opens the locket and pulls out a piece of paper. Suddenly, the paper disintegrates. Before Matthew can figure out what is happening, Melinda recites a curse, and Matthew disappears into the locket.

Prue frees Matthew In the present, at Buckland's Auction House, Rex Buckland presents the locket to Prue, telling her it's part of a large estate from the east. She opens it and Matthew appears. Realizing that Prue couldn't have opened it unless she was a descendant of Melinda, Matthew tries to attack her, but Prue sends him flying across the room. Matthew thanks Prue, because he now has her power of telekinesis. He pins her against the wall with a chair, then disappears and reappears behind her to finish her off. Believing that Prue inherited all of Melinda's powers, he grabs her again and tries to goad her into freezing him. Prue tells him she doesn't have that ability. Matthew releases her, blows out a window, and jumps, landing safely on his own two feet. The cops arrive, including Darryl and Andy; Andy knows that the blown-out window is Prue's.

Leo is repairing the kitchen sink. Phoebe urges Piper to ask him out, but she is reluctant.

It turns out that Rex and Hannah provided Prue with the locket. The warlock-couple is after the Charmed Ones' powers, and plan to use Matthew to get them.

Prue goes to Phoebe and Piper and tells them of Matthew Tate. Phoebe takes the locket and has a vision of Melinda putting Matthew in the locket.

Phoebe's premonition A lawyer named Arnold Halliwell is on the phone when the door to his office suddenly swings open. Before Arnold Halliwell can figure out what is happening, Matthew blinks in and telekinetically pins him up against the wall and demands to know where Arnold's ""sisters"" are -- but Arnold Halliwell shares only a name with the Charmed Ones. Matthew telekinetically breaks Arnold Halliwell's neck and walks away. The sisters consult the Book of Shadows and find Matthew. They find out that he was never supposed to be let out of the locket, since he would likely be hellbent on destroying the Warren line.

Andy appears at the manor to question Prue. Phoebe answers the door and won't let him in. He tells her of the murdered lawyer and wants to know where Prue is. She demands a warrant and he leaves. The sisters are at a loss as to how to handle Matthew. Phoebe tells them that she found a spell to summon Melinda so they can ask her for help. They cast the spell, and Melinda appears in 17th century dress. They redress her so she can blend in. Leo shows up and the sisters introduce Melinda as their cousin.

Matthew runs into Rex and Hannah at a ""Halliwell Hardware and Appliance"", where Matthew has murdered the proprietor. Rex and Hannah offer to find the Charmed Ones for him.

Melinda tells the sisters of her arrest and burning. She had not used her powers to escape so that her daughter, Prudence, would not be found out as a witch as well. She tells them of Matthew's ability to copy a good witch's power and become immune to it. When Prue asks her about Matthew's ""wild power,"" Melinda tells him that it's called blinking--the ability to think of a location and literally be there ""in the blink of an eye."" She mentions that Matthew copied that power from another witch. Melinda proposes to curse Matthew back into the locket.

Matthew changes into more modern clothes to blend in, and is amazed at how ""closed"" things are in the 20th century. He appears to be making a pass at Hannah when Rex comes in and snaps them all back to task. He tells Melinda that Matthew goes back in the locket as soon as the sisters are dead.

The four witches consult the Book of Shadows and find the curse. Melinda is amazed at how big the Book has gotten since she started it. Phoebe finds it hard to believe that they'll be able to add to it eventually. Piper thinks she can get most of the ingredients at Quake. However, one ingredient they can't get is a spotted owl feather; Prue offers to get it.

Rex shows Matthew pictures of the sisters and the address of Quake, and has Hannah take him to Quake.

Prue knows there's a stuffed spotted owl at the Museum of Natural History, where she used to work. She offers to get the feather there. Unknown to Prue, Andy is following her.

Matthew is after Piper, but finds Phoebe instead. He grabs her and she has a vision of him attacking Melinda. Matthew now has her power, and knows the sisters summoned Melinda. Phoebe calls the manor trying to find Prue. Only Melinda is there, and she does not know how telephones work. Matthew comes to the manor and confronts Melinda. He tries to goad Melinda into freezing him, but Melinda won't go along. Matthew grabs Melinda by the neck, and has a vision of the four witches cursing him back in the locket.

Melinda cursing Matthew back into the locket He demands to know where Prue is, and Melinda sends him to the zoo. Matthew vows to break Melinda's spirit by killing the sisters, then killing her last. He blinks out. Rex knows Hannah lost track of Matthew; he magically followed her.

Piper and Phoebe arrive at the manor to find Melinda badly shaken. Melinda says Prue is taking care of the feather.

Prue is heading out of the museum when Andy nabs her and takes her to his car.

Matthew flings Hannah through the door of Rex's office. Matthew is hellbent on killing Prue. Rex tries to get him to focus on Piper and Phoebe, but Matthew tells him that the sisters summoned Melinda and are trying to curse him back into the locket. Rex suspects they'll have to speak the curse in the manor--and if he goes there, he can copy Piper's freezing power and kill them all. He hands Matthew a pistol.

Andy grills Prue about the feather. Just as he's about to take her to the station, Prue sets off the airbag in his car and escapes. Matthew comes to the manor and confronts Piper, Phoebe and Melinda. He draws Piper toward him and points the pistol at her, trying to goad her into freezing him. Just in time, Prue comes in and flings the pistol from Matthew's hand. She then pins him to the ground with a chair. Prue adds the feather to the potion. Piper freezes Matthew just as he gets up. Melinda speaks the curse and sends Matthew back into the locket.

Matthew has failed to steal the Charmed Ones' powers, but Rex and Hannah now know that they are the Charmed Ones. Hannah says that they should have gone after the Charmed Ones directly, and Rex admits they should have.

Andy wants to arrest Prue, but Darryl talks him out of it.

Piper asks Leo out. The sisters speak a spell and send Melinda back to among the dead, but not she grants Phoebe a vision of her many future descendants -- ""daughters"", she says, though that will turn out not to be entirely true. Melinda takes the locket with her--likely trapping Matthew for eternity."

The sisters must prove Prue's innocence and vanquish Rex before its too late.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Mel Damski'],"['', '', '']",[],"['hypnotized woman', 'mind control', 'witch', 'warlock', 'wiccan']",[],"Prue and Phoebe come home from a shopping spree just as Piper and Leo are heading upstairs. Piper freezes the room so they can talk in private. Phoebe notices that Piper is wearing a front-clasp bra (an indication that she and Leo are about to have sex). Piper looks at all the clothes Prue bought and wonders if she's simply drowning her sorrows over losing Andy, but Phoebe pulls out a naughty-looking piece of lingerie that suggests Prue's over that loss. Piper shoos them away; she never knows how long her freezes hold. Piper runs back to Leo just as he unfreezes, and they run upstairs.

Prue and Phoebe bust Leo and Piper As Prue is undressing in her room, a ghostly Rex Buckland appears behind her. He tells her to pull a tiara out of her briefcase, and that she believes it's her date book. Kit sees Rex and hisses at him, but Prue doesn't know why. Back at Buckland's, Rex tells Hannah that their plan to frame Prue is well underway, and that this is the second time he's used his new power of astral projection to help it along; he used it earlier to trick Prue into taking the tiara from the vault. Hannah still doesn't understand how it works, so Rex uses it to get her to take off her dress.

The next morning, Piper gets up late and is on her way to work when Prue and Phoebe make her spill the beans about the night with Leo. Piper says it's been a while since she had sex, so she ended up freezing Leo several times, much to Prue and Phoebe's amusement.

Prue and Phoebe bump into Jaime, a security guard at Buckland's. He tells them of the missing tiara. Rex offers to take Phoebe to see The Verve. Darryl and Andy ask to see the security tapes.

Andy questions Prue about the theft of the tiara. She remembers nothing of stealing a tiara. Darryl is suspicious, in no small part because the security tape from the vault is missing.

Andy and Darryl appear at the manor with a search warrant. They search a bedroom and Piper spots the tiara as Andy opens a drawer. She freezes the room and moves the tiara to under a pillow.

Rex in astral form with Prue Rex projects in and tells Andy to look under the pillow. Darryl looks under the pillow and Piper freezes the room again. Piper moves the tiara into a dresser, but Rex suggests to Andy that he check there. Piper freezes the room again and Phoebe moves the tiara to the attic, without saying where she took it. Rex is thwarted at last and the two cops finally give up and leave. Rex returns to his body, and tells Hannah they'll have to up the ante. The sisters can't figure out how the tiara got in the manor, though Phoebe suspects a warlock. Leo arrives, ostensibly to fix the bathroom sink. Instead, he heads to the attic and uses telekinesis; this is the first hint that he is not just a handyman. Piper walks in and Leo tells her that he might have to leave.

Phoebe goes to Rex's apartment and his astral form insists that she will see it as ""spectacular"".

The girls have to keep moving the tiara He offers her wine and tells her that ""Zeitgeist Magazine"" wants to interview her. He offers her sushi and walks out. He projects, and gives her a premonition of Prue at Buckland's, being pursued by a warlock. She walks out in a panic. Rex calls 911. Manipulating his voice to sound like Jaime's, he claims he is at Buckland's and someone is trying to kill him. Prue is working late at Buckland's. She sneaks into Hannah's office and uses her computer; she looks for Hannah's name on the database, and there's no record of it. She looks for Rex's name as well; there's no record of it either. Rex projects and tells her that a warlock is after her. He projects again and tells her that an innocent is in danger, and that she is to grab an artifact. Hannah cracks Jaime over the head with the artifact, killing him, and leaves the missing security tape on his body. Andy and Darryl find Prue over the dead security guard, with the murder weapon in her hand. The security tape shows Prue taking the tiara. The police arrest Prue for murder.

Rex dates Phoebe Piper and Phoebe go to Rex's apartment to seek his help, but find it empty except for Phoebe's lipstick. They realize that Rex is a warlock. Back at the manor, they try to figure out how to free Prue. They conclude that if Rex is a warlock, Hannah almost certainly is one as well.

Phoebe hides the tiara in an armoire, not knowing that Rex is projecting into the room. They go to the jail and Piper freezes the guards. Piper unlocks Prue's cell; the two flee, and join Phoebe outside. Rex, however, is waiting outside with a Polaroid camera and takes a picture. He says he has known all along they were witches, but saw he wasn't powerful enough to attack them directly so he opted for blackmail; he demands their powers in return for the picture, and also promises to clear Prue of the tiara theft as well. He hands them a lantern that will catch their powers when they cast the relevant spell.

Prue in jail Andy doesn't want to believe Prue is guilty of murder; the evidence tying her to the guard's death is piling up too neatly.

The sisters discuss Rex's demand, not knowing that Rex and Leo overhear them, and decide to give up their powers in hopes that they can somehow reverse it. The sisters say the Relinquishment Spell, each one in turn, and their powers go into the lantern. The Book of Shadows is now entirely blank.

Rex comes to and tells Hannah that the sisters are on their way. Hannah shapeshifts into a panther.

The sisters are stopped by Rex as they flee the jail Andy searches for the names Rex Buckland and Hannah Webster, and discovers that the real ones were murdered on the same day. The real Hannah was African American; the woman using her name is white. The real Rex was balding, short and stocky, unlike the follically-enhanced, strapping man using his name. He tells Darryl that he thinks the faux Rex and Hannah are framing Prue. The sisters go back to Buckland's. They hand over the lantern to Rex. Hannah, in her panther form, rushes out from the office. Unknown to the sisters, Leo walks into the attic and finds the Book of Shadows blank. He raises his hands over it and restores the spells to its pages, and with it the sisters' powers. As Hannah leaps, Piper throws out her hands in fright.

Leo orbs away from the manor Suddenly, both Hannah and Rex freeze. The sisters realize that their powers are restored and Prue moves Rex to where the sisters were. Hannah knocks Rex to the ground, mauls him and returns to human form. The two go up in flames. Hannah protests that Rex had failed, not her as they disappear into the flames, leaving only ash behind. The sisters return Prue to jail, where Andy and Darryl set her free. They tell her that they found the tiara in Rex' office, and also have evidence Rex and Hannah were skimming off auction proceeds. The sisters find the Book of Shadows restored. Leo comes in for his toolbox and says goodbye, saying he's fixed everything he was supposed to fix. The sisters tear out the relinquishment spell and burn the page.

Leo walks out the front door, and is seen orbing as he leaves."

One picks the urn up and a symbol on it glows. Clay, one of the thieves, takes possession of the urn and the three plan to meet in San Francisco. The Guardian of the Urn appears to another of the thieves, Wesley, and places a spider on his chest. The spider delivers a fatal bite as Clay and Palmer escape. Clay appears at the manor; he turns out to be an ex-boyfriend of Phoebe. The sisters are talking at Quake when a waiter, Doug, spills some glasses. Piper freezes him and saves the glasses. Doug's girlfriend, Shelley, also works at Quake. She has dumped him, he's a wreck and he's constantly dropping dishes.

Clay tells Phoebe about the urn and he wants Prue to sell it via Buckland's. Rex Buckland and Hannah Webster had skimmed off so much in auction proceeds that a bank forced Buckland's into bankruptcy and sent Claire Pryce to run it. Claire wants to move $1.2 million of merchandise the next day, or she will close Buckland's. Clay brings the urn in, but Prue suspects the urn might be stolen. Clay bumps into Palmer, who mentions the urn in front of Phoebe.

At the auction, Claire comes to Prue and tells her that the urn is stolen. Prue uses her power to switch the tags on the urn and a picture, and takes the urn away. She meets Palmer, who tells her of the curse on the urn. Prue uses telekinesis to move the urn, making Palmer believe that the curse is real, and he runs out.

Piper has cast a spell to boost Doug's confidence. She and Phoebe walk into Quake and find Doug shaking a cocktail and with a half dozen girls fawning over him. Shelley looks on, jealous.

The Guardian catches Palmer as he is about to skip town. She places a scorpion on his neck, which gives him a fatal sting. Prue tells Phoebe that the urn is stolen and cursed. Phoebe is reconnecting with Clay, though, and has a hard time believing Prue.

Buckland's has raised $1.28 million and Claire agrees to leave it open. Andy walks into Prue's office and tells her about Palmer. He had found Prue's business card on Palmer's body.

Phoebe confronts Clay about the urn and he admits that he stole it. He knows that Wesley and Palmer are dead, but had not known about the curse. Phoebe believes that Clay had brought the curse among the sisters. Later, Clay meets Phoebe at the manor and offers to take the urn and turn himself in to the police. Phoebe gets a vision and sees Clay confronting a giant cobra. At Buckland's, the Guardian appears to Clay, Phoebe and Prue. Clay flees, Prue's telekinesis barely affects the Guardian, and the two sisters also run.

The three sisters consult the Book of Shadows, and find nothing about the urn--but that a curse for greed can be reversed by a selfless act. They come back down and find Clay gone. Clay has returned to Buckland's and offers himself to the Guardian. The Guardian throws down a glowing cord, which turns into a huge cobra. The sisters run in and Clay blocks the cobra from Phoebe. This selfless act redeems him. The Guardian disappears, and then so does the urn.

Piper has reversed the confidence spell and Doug is back to dropping dishes. He spills a tray in front of Shelley. Piper freezes him and pulls an engagement ring out of his apron. Shelley finds the ring and Doug asks Shelley to marry him. She had given up on waiting for him to ask, but now they are reconciled. Clay walks in and asks if there is any chance Phoebe will return with him to New York. She tells him San Francisco is her home now"

Piper decides to call the auto club instead, but her cell phone quits. She spots a telephone booth. While walking to the telephone booth, she hears someone in the woods. She runs for the booth and shuts herself inside. A hairy beast attacks and breaks in. A man appears and fires a flare gun at the beast, which then flees. Piper is scratched on her left arm. Phoebe talks Prue into hiring her at Buckland's.

Piper reveals her wounds to her sisters and Andy Piper is in the hospital being bandaged. The man with the flare gun identifies himself as Billy Waters. Andy introduces FBI agent Ashley Fallon, who tells him about the creature. Billy tells the sisters about the creature; it had killed his fiancee, Laura, by ripping her heart out. Andy wonders why Billy had a flare gun; Billy mentions that it appears to be afraid of fire. Piper consults the Book of Shadows and finds out it is called a Wendigo. Phoebe and Prue find a gold charm bracelet among goods to be auctioned. Phoebe picks up the bracelet and has a vision of a car accident. The bracelet bears the initials TL.

Piper tells Billy of the first known Wendigo. The first Wendigo had been betrayed by his lover, and cut her heart out. Piper stands up, has a dizzy spell, and begins to feel tired.

Andy has found more information on the Wendigo. It kills before, on or after a full moon; and chooses only AB-negative blood type victims. He thinks the creature is merely a serial killer.

Phoebe produces some handcuffs to secure Wendigo Piper with Billy goes to Fallon and they talk in a parking garage. He tells her what Piper told him. He lights a cigarette and Fallon freaks. Billy recoils, realizing that Fallon might well be the Wendigo. Fallon snaps his neck, killing him.

Phoebe has tracks down the car from the accident and finds the owner of the bracelet, Teri Lane. Phoebe is unwilling to let the bracelet be sold.

A health inspector, Laurence Beck, appears at Quake. Piper is evidently ill and sweating. The inspector orders Piper to go home or he will close Quake.

The bracelet comes up for auction. Several bidders raise their paddles, but Prue uses her power to fling them away. The bracelet goes unsold.

Piper dreams of meeting Andy at the manor, turning into a Wendigo, and attacking him. She awakens and finds Andy at the door. She states she feels ill and tries to wave him off. He tells her what happened to Billy, and Fallon also appears at the manor. Fallon suggests that Piper might have been infected from the attack on her. Piper pulls the bandage off her arm and finds that her arm has become hairy.

Phoebe visits Harriet Lane and presents the bracelet. Harriet does not recognize the bracelet. Phoebe asks Harriet what her daughter's name is. Prue is in the hall with Teri, and mother and daughter have a tearful reunion.

Andy and Fallon meet in a park near where Piper was attacked. She flirts with him, and tells him of her fiance who had walked out on her, saying she took steps to make sure she could never be hurt like that again. Andy blows her off, saying that they're only partners on the case.

Piper transforming into the Wendigo Prue and Phoebe return to the manor and find Piper sweating, frightened and occasionally snapping at them. Phoebe picks up Fallon's business card and has a vision: Fallon is the Wendigo. The sisters consult the Book of Shadows. They find nothing direct, but determine that they must kill Fallon to save Piper. They need to restrain Piper, however. Phoebe produces a pair of handcuffs, to a bit of embarrassment, and she and Prue cuff Piper to a pipe. Prue and Phoebe go to an Army surplus store to get a flare gun. Night falls, and Piper transforms into a Wendigo with the transformation ripping off her clothes. She pulls free of the pipe and the handcuffs. Fallon also transforms and attacks Andy. She scratches his chest, but just as she's about to cut his heart out, Prue and Phoebe arrive. Prue fires the flare gun. She misses twice. They find Andy, and Prue misses again. Piper arrives, and Prue and Phoebe don't know which Wendigo to shoot. Phoebe shoots this time, aiming at the Wendigo on the left. Suddenly, the flare freezes in flight--and so does the Wendigo on the right, proving that she's Fallon. Prue then moves the flare toward Fallon, killing her. Piper is restored to normal leaving her naked and freezing. Andy's chest wound then heals as Prue checks up on him.

Phoebe quits her job, because working around so much old stuff at Buckland's will give her premonitions everywhere and she can't handle it, and she needs to find a world of her own."

Phoebe has an upcoming job interview and wants a good luck charm. Tanjella, the proprietor, is anxious to close before midnight. The next day is Friday the 13th and Tanjella tells skeptical Prue and Phoebe of a convergence of negative energy. At midnight, the clock strikes 13 and the sisters leave. A massive cloud of smoke covers the area around the store. The demon Barbas appears out of the cloud as they drive away and slides through the closed door. Barbas gestures and names Tanjella's greatest fear: being buried in an earthquake. The shop shakes, and things fall down everywhere. Tanjella tries to move, but can't; Barbas tells her she's paralyzed by her fear. Tanjella falls down dead, her hair turned entirely white. Phoebe talks to Piper and notes that Prue never says ""I love you."" Piper is planning a superstition-themed fund raiser at Quake. Piper is adhering to lots of superstitions, but Prue is typically skeptical.

Andy shows up and asks after Prue as Phoebe and Piper leave the manor. He notes the death of Tanjella and two others who died like her. Prue had been Tanjella's last customer. The three victims were all single young women involved with the occult. After he leaves, Prue consults the Book of Shadows and finds the page on the Demon of Fear. The page is in her mother's handwriting. Prue meets Piper at Quake and tells what she found: Barbas must kill 13 single female witches to free himself, and can only do this on one Friday the 13th every 1300 years. He kills by exploiting a witch's greatest fear. Prue remembers Piper is wary of flying, and that Phoebe is afraid of being stuck in an elevator. Piper tells Prue to stay away from pools; ever since their mother drowned she's been afraid of drowning as well.

Phoebe interviews at SWA Properties, a real estate firm, and easily lands the job. Her boss, however, wants her to cover if her husband calls. The boss leaves with her lover.

Barbas visits a witch named Zoe. However, Zoe has been expecting Barbas, and claims to have no fear. However, she still fears fire; she merely suppressed it over the years. Barbas causes flame to shoot out of one of Zoe's candles and turn into a ring of fire. Prue had found her name on a flyer that Tanjella had given her and enters Zoe's apartment, but she is a moment too late. Fearing that she might be suspected of involvement in the murders, Prue calls 911 and heads for home. Andy notes that Zoe is the fifth woman to die this way, implying one other besides Tanjella. Darryl has found Prue's name on the doorman's log.

The sisters are dining at Quake and Prue is trying to discourage Piper from relying on superstition. Phoebe finds a ladybug on a leaf and notes something Grams once told her: that a ladybug can lead you to your ideal mate. The ladybug lands on a young man on a nearby table, Lucas. After Prue and Phoebe leave, Lucas comes over and asks Piper out.

Phoebe is conflicted about lying to her boss's husband. She flips the good luck charm, but it lands standing on its side. She has a vision of Prue drowning in the shower. She calls the manor, but Prue doesn't answer. Prue is in the shower and sees Barbas as he appears. The shower begins to fill with water. Her powers don't work because of her fear. At last her head is underwater. Andy and Darryl appear at the manor to ask Prue about Zoe. They hear her scream and kick the door in. They enter the bathroom, but Barbas disappears. The water recedes and Prue is saved. Prue is reticent and tells the cops that she had soap in her eyes. Andy thinks that Prue might have been the next victim. Phoebe reaches the manor and the cops leave. Phoebe notices that a lock of Prue's hair has turned white indicating just how close Barbas came to killing her.

Prue and Phoebe consult the Book of Shadows. Prue notices the attic smells of sandalwood, a scent that their mother had worn, and finds a new line on Barbas's page: ""To let go of your fear, trust in the greatest of all powers"". Prue says this line wasn't present before, and that she feels their mother's presence. Phoebe says ""I love you"" and Prue only says ""me too."" It turns out ""I love you"" was the last thing Prue said to her mother before she died.

Patty appears to help Prue Piper is having a run of bad luck. In the kitchen at Quake, she tries to cast a spell, but the burning sage stick only sets off a smoke alarm. She ends up scalding her hand when she attempts to neutralize the sage stick.

The husband of Phoebe's boss appears at her desk. He asks where his wife is and Phoebe is unwilling to lie. She says nothing definite and instead tries to quit her job. The husband knew about the affair but had been in denial. As he leaves, a client calls, wanting to bring Phoebe out to a large estate. Phoebe goes, only to find that the ""client"" is, in fact, Barbas. There is a pool on the grounds. Phoebe's greatest fear is losing a sister, not elevators as she thinks. Barbas ties Phoebe up. Barbas calls Prue using Phoebe's voice.

Piper has dinner with Lucas. After a while, she thinks Lucas is too good to be true. He mentions pictures of his nieces, and she freezes him. She checks out his wallet and finds that he is telling the truth, but feels wrong about choosing him based on superstitions. She unfreezes him and claims to be superstitious, immediately turning him off.

The thugs take Max away at gunpoint, and tell Gordan not to tell anyone if he wants Max back safe the next day. In the attic, the sisters are doing spring cleaning, and Prue helps move things along telekinetically. Prue mentions that Phoebe, inadvertently, told her about a planned surprise party. Piper and Phoebe want to keep their toys to give to their kids, but Prue wants hers thrown away; she doesn't think she's cut out to be a mother.

The thugs have Max tied up and gagged in an auto shop and tell him to do as he's told if he wants to live. One of them mentions that his brother told him Max helped them break into an arcade.

Prue cleans the Attic The Spirit Board starts moving, and Prue records its message: ""Help Max"". The sisters don't know what to make of it.

Piper argues on the phone with Harry, a new chef at Quake. Harry has replaced all of her knives. As she leaves, she bumps into Leo. She's happy to see him and tells him of a flickering chandelier.

Prue goes to Andy and tells him of Max. He wants to know how she knows and all she can think of is to tell him of the spirit board. Andy has no record of any missing persons named Max.

Phoebe finds Leo hovering to fix a chandelier Piper arrives at Quake and argues with Harry. He has disrespected her, changed all the menus, and is wearing shorts instead of the proper chef's uniform. Piper tries to fire him, but Harry curtly says she can't. She freezes him and throws his crab ravioli into the trash. The thugs force Max to disable the security system at a microchip plant. Max concentrates and a panel shorts out. One of the thugs enters the front door and walks out -- they are not out to steal anything, only to test Max. As the thug leaves, a security guard confronts him. The thug pulls a gun and fires, wounding the guard.

Phoebe surprises Leo, while he is levitating to fix the chandelier. Leo explains that he is a Whitelighter, a guardian angel for good witches. He he was sent out by the Elders to watch over the Charmed Ones when they first got their powers. He demonstrates his powers by warming Phoebe's tea. Leo admits that he came back to help Max, who is a young witch new to the Craft. He got word that someone was trying to make Max use his powers for evil purposes, and that he manipulated the Spirit Board so Prue would get Max's cry for help. Leo asks Phoebe to keep his secret. He tells Phoebe that he fell in love with Piper, and that witches and Whitelighters aren't allowed to fall in love.

Andy visits Prue at her office. She hides the spirit board in her drawer. He's found out about Max, who was seen at the break-in at the microchip plant. He also said that he went to see his father, and it was obvious he knew what was going on, but was afraid to tell. Meanwhile, the spirit board starts moving and Prue records it's message ""Kidnapped auto shop"". Prue calls Piper and lets her know what's going on, but Harry breaks in.

Leo agonizes over how to break it off with Piper.

Prue goes to see Gordan. He refuses to talk to her, until she reveals that she is a witch. Gordan tells her that his wife, Paulette, was also a witch, but that she didn't reveal that both she and Max were witches, until shortly before her death three months ago. Not long after that, Max started manifesting his powers, and Gordan couldn't handle it. Prue mentions the auto shop clue, and Gordan mentions Max's friend Danny. As it turns out, Danny's brother; David, one of the thugs, works there.

Prue gets some information from Danny, and heads to the auto shop with Gordan. She finds Max and unties him, but one of the thugs shows up just as she's about to head out. Prue throws him out the door. The other thug shows up, and Prue throws him as well. Just as they're about to leave, one of the thugs comes to and knocks her out. Prue comes to, and Max has been wired with plastic explosives. One of the thugs has a remote control, and threatens to blow Max up if Prue tries anything funny.

Max is ashamed of his powers, but Prue tells him they're a gift. Max tells Prue that his dad hates him for these new powers, but Prue tells him he's just as new to them as he is. She promises to protect him.

Leo tries to break up with Piper, but can't find the right words. Phoebe shows up at the wrong moment as Harry yells at Piper again.

Darryl shows Andy a picture of Mickey Jackson, one of the thugs. Mickey had robbed a bank and the two think he's planning another bank robbery. They don't know where Max fits in. Phoebe calls, asking after Prue, and Andy asks after Max. Phoebe makes an excuse and hangs up. Leo is unable to sense either Prue or Max. Piper walks into the manor, Phoebe leaves, and now Piper is alone with Leo. Leo tries again to break up with Piper; she freezes him and confronts Phoebe. Phoebe offers no answers. Leo says that he is ""involved"" and he has to leave again. Piper admits that Leo is ""geographically undesirable"", kisses him and walks out. Leo gets a ""jingle"" and suddenly walks out the door.

The thugs load up a van with guns. Prue discusses witchcraft with Max. Prue says she feels his pain; her mother died when she was about Max's age. She also says that she didn't expect to come into her powers either, but had to figure it out for herself and thinks Max can too, with his father's help. Prue attempts to rescue Max, but gets caught in the process. Prue talks to Max about his power of psychokinesis. The thugs order Max and Prue into the van. Gordan appears and begs the thugs to let Max go. The thugs shove Max and Prue into the van, and Mickey shoots the father. It's night now and the thugs order Max to disable an alarm system of a bank and open a vault. The four enter the bank and the thugs start stealing money. Prue encourages Max to use his power, giving a knowing glance at the bomb. He defuses the bomb strapped to him and activates the alarm. The guards show up, but Prue sees the thugs readying machine guns, and throws the guards out of the way, just before the thugs open fire. Mickey angrily hits the button, and is surprised when nothing happens. Prue yanks the guns out of the thugs' hands. Before they can figure out what is happening, she throws the thugs into the vault and locks them in.

Gordan is near death, when a white light appears. He thinks it's Paulette, but it's really Leo. He heals Gordan's gunshot wound, encourages him to continue to raise Max well, and orbs away. Prue and Max return in the van and find Gordan unharmed. Gordan invites Prue to visit Paulette's grave with him.

Leo has left and Piper thinks he has a secret. Phoebe tells her and Prue that Leo is a Whitelighter and that he wasn't supposed to fall in love with Piper. Neither Piper nor Prue believes her."

A mysterious third man meets with one of the boxers, Luther Stubbs. Luther had killed a man in the ring three years ago. Without warning, the mysterious man draws a sword and kills Luther, saying he is after his killer instinct. Prue and Piper come home from shopping. Piper is dreading having to do yearly inventory at Quake. Prue is surprised to discover an old marble statue of Grams in the living room. They'd planned to put it in storage, but Piper found out that the storage facility they wanted had unexpectedly jacked up their prices. She and Phoebe voted to keep it at the manor--unless Prue can move it. Prue tries to pick it up, but it's too heavy--it's solid marble. She does, however, remind Piper that eventually she'll be powerful enough to move it to the basement.

Phoebe is sparring with a dummy in the sunroom. She has been taking self-defense classes to hone her fighting skills as she wants to make up for only having a passive power. Phoebe manages to grab Prue by the arm. She has a vision of Prue dying at the hand of a man with a sword. The next morning, Phoebe draws the sword she saw, but cannot find it in the Book of Shadows. Prue comes downstairs, about to head to work -- she's due to meet a major client at Buckland's. Piper and Phoebe don't want Prue to leave the house, but this is the first time Prue has dealt with a major client in some time, and she doesn't want to lose Claire's trust in her. Piper and Phoebe finally get Prue to promise to come straight home after work. Helena Statler meets with Prue and Claire at Buckland's. She says that she and her brother have amassed a large collection of antiquities, and are thinking about having Buckland's sell them. Prue is apprehensive when Helena says the collection is located in the Warehouse Flats, but with Claire glowering over her she agrees to go.

Phoebe at last finds the sword; it belongs to the Lords of War. The sword renders its bearer invulnerable to the weapons of man and steals power. Phoebe and Piper read in the Book of Shadows that when a Lord of War is disgraced, he must steal his powers back-- including the power of a firstborn witch, since they are always the most powerful. They fear that one of them might be after Prue.

Prue meets Helena at the Warehouse Flats with her collection. One of the items is a pillory; Prue puts her arms in it, and it suddenly closes. The mysterious man seen at the beginning of the show appears, and Helena introduces him as her brother, Gabriel-- a Lord of War. The Statlers know that Prue is a witch, and trapped her arms because they suspected she channeled her power through them, as did one of her ancestors, Brianna Warren. However, Prue opens the pillory with her power, much to the Statlers' surprise; they didn't know she channeled her power through her eyes. She throws Helena against a wall, then swings a halberd at Gabriel. The halberd doesn't even scratch him, and Prue makes a break for the door. Gabriel throws his sword at her and misses, allowing Prue to make good her escape.

Phoebe finds Gabriel in the Book of Shadows. Brianna Warren had taken Gabriel's sword during the Crimean War, disgracing him, and now he must steal his powers back. Trying to find a solution, Phoebe finds an incantation to triple a witch's strength. Piper doesn't like this idea, but Prue doesn't want to chance Gabriel getting to them before they can get to him. Prue chants the spell in the attic, and it summons two more Prues. The next morning, Phoebe provides the Prues with sweaters in order to tell them apart: one pink, one blue, and one black for the real Prue. Pink-Prue says that the clones are only there as long as they're needed-- presumably until they find a way to defeat Gabriel. Real-Prue had her assistant at Buckland's track down the ownership records for one of the Statlers' pieces, in hopes of finding their address. Piper isn't sure that the three Prues will have enough power to fight Gabriel, but they reassure her by easily lifting the statue. Andy comes to the manor, claiming a social call. Pink-Prue answers and he gives her tickets to the Bay Area Musical Awards. Claire calls and wants Prue at Buckland's immediately if she wants to keep her job. Piper doesn't think the five of them should split up, but the Prues think two of them can go to Buckland's while one of them goes to Quake with Piper. They take a vote; Piper and Phoebe don't want to split up, but are outvoted by the Prues. Real-Prue and pink-Prue go to Buckland's. Pink-Prue gets Gabriel's address. Claire confronts pink-Prue about the incident at the warehouse. Claire takes the sheet with Gabriel's address. Real-Prue calls the manor to talk to Phoebe, but has to hang up when pink-Prue tries to butt in. Claire arrives, and real-Prue leaves with her.

Pink-Prue calls Piper at Quake to touch base. Piper goes into the kitchen to find blue-Prue sampling spaghetti and flirting with the cooks. Piper is mystified at blue-Prue's behavior, but blue-Prue says she's a side of Prue that doesn't come out very often.

Pink-Prue runs into Gabriel. Gabriel throws a flash canister. Pink-Prue is temporarily blinded, but uses her power to nick Gabriel in the face with his own sword. Enraged, Gabriel runs pink-Prue through with the sword. He expects Prue's power to flow into him via his sword, and is surprised when nothing happens. He realizes that he's been tricked. Real-Prue feels the pain.

Andy finds pink-Prue in the morgue and goes to Phoebe. Phoebe asks what color sweater was ""Prue"" wearing; it was pink. Blue-Prue walks in, followed by real-Prue, and Piper freezes the room while real-Prue hides. Andy doesn't know what to think. Blue-Prue doesn't know about the concert.

Piper, Phoebe and the two remaining Prues plan to confront Gabriel at his house. Helena and Gabriel, meanwhile, plan to face the Halliwells at the manor. The three sisters make further plans, excluding blue-Prue from of the conversation. Piper and Phoebe eventually talk real-Prue out of attacking the Statlers at their house. They come out to discover blue-Prue has headed for the Statlers' house.

Phoebe kicks The Lord Of War Blue-Prue takes Helena hostage in a torture device and demands the sword in exchange for Helena's life. However, Gabriel realizes this Prue is a clone as well, and instead kills Helena, then comes after clone Prue. Real Prue and Phoebe are heading for Gabriel's house when real-Prue feels Gabriel killing the clone.

The sisters hatch a new plan--get the sword away from Gabriel and kill him with it. Phoebe has a vision and knows that Gabriel is coming.

Andy asks the medical examiner about pink clone Prue. The ME says that as far as he can tell, the woman is Prue Halliwell.

Gabriel breaks through a window of the darkened manor. He throws his sword, but it strikes only Phoebe's sparring dummy. He is now vulnerable, and the sisters attack. Piper freezes him, and Phoebe kicks him, knocking him against a wall. Prue flings his sword into his chest, vanquishing him.

Andy takes Prue to the morgue to show her the clone, but finds only the clothes that pink clone Prue was wearing. Later he opens a folder marked HALLIWELL, PRUE and removes a sheet mentioning black magic and witchcraft"

He comes from generations of warlocks and wants to change, but feels weak. The priest tries to reassure him. His brothers, warlocks named Greg and Paul, confront him in the church; they want him to join them. Piper, Prue and Phoebe are unloading food from a Quake van for a benefit the church is holding. Phoebe grabs a pen that Brendan had, and has a vision of him being attacked by warlocks in the church. The sisters split up to find him.

Greg and Paul tell Brendan that he must join them to fulfill the destiny of the Rowe Coven. Brendan refuses. Greg morphs into a demonic form and knocks Brendan across the room. Greg grabs Brendan and tells him he can't run away from his destiny. Just then, Prue arrives and flings Greg into a table. Greg gets up and runs out, with Paul close behind. She offers to help Brendan, but he flees.

In a loft Greg and Paul share, Paul is admiring his pet chameleon, but Greg is obsessed with turning Brendan evil. Greg is fed up with the chameleon and is about to flip the cage over. Paul raises his hand and a force field surrounds the cage. Greg calms down, and Paul drops the force field. Paul wants to let Brendan go, but Greg insists on turning him and is even willing to kill him if he won't turn. Brendan is to be ordained as a priest within two days; once this is done, he will never be a warlock.

Josh calls the manor. Piper tries to stall, but Phoebe won't go along. Josh wants to take Piper out on Friday night, but Piper awkwardly declines. They then talk about Brendan. Prue wants to try to find him; she sensed that he wouldn't be scared about her being a witch.

Prue talks to Father Austin and warns him of Greg and Paul. Father Austin had expected them to come sooner or later, but is reticent with further details. He does, however, tell Prue where he can find Brendan.

Phoebe plays matchmaker between Piper and Josh. Piper finally agrees to go out with him, and Phoebe agrees to cover for her at Quake.

Prue finds Brendan at a ranch, and overhears him telling a girl he can't kill a spider he found on her. She asks who attacked him, and he initially isn't willing to talk about it. She goes horseback riding with him, and gets him to open up more; now he says it doesn't matter, as tomorrow he will be a priest and safe from them.

Piper goes rock climbing with Josh. She takes a fall, and Josh catches her. They exchange ""the look"" and Piper starts to panic. She freezes the scene and calls Phoebe. The sink is overflowing in the Quake kitchen and when Piper realizes the emergency, she unfreezes the scene, makes an excuse to Josh about the phone and leaves for Quake.

At the church, Brendan is standing over a badly injured Father Austin. He shows a demonic face. Prue walks in and he resumes his human face and flees. Prue catches up with him and flings him to the ground. Brendan insists that his brothers hurt Father Austin, and it was rage over what happened that turned him into a warlock. Unlike earlier, he begs for Prue's help. Prue is skeptical; there's no such thing as a good warlock. Father Austin is rushed to the hospital and a nun identifies Brendan to Andy and Darryl. Andy takes it very personally; Father Austin has been his priest since he was a boy.

Back at Quake, Piper tells Phoebe she should have called her. She also admits she's afraid that Josh will turn out to be either a ghost, a warlock or will live too far away for their relationship to work but thanks Phoebe for trying to set her up with someone.

Brendan tells Prue that he comes from a long line of powerful warlocks. However, he is only half warlock; his mother is human. His brothers want him to join them so they can create the most powerful evil force that the world has ever known, an evil counterpart to the Charmed Ones. However, he wants no part of it, and has been fighting his evil side all of his life. He has been on the run for many years to keep Greg and Paul from finding him. He wants to become a priest not only to completely suppress his warlock side, but to make up for all the evil his family has done over the centuries. He tells Prue that he is going to end it by killing Greg and Paul but that she and her sisters may have to kill him as well.

That night, Brendan confronts his brothers. Greg seems to be overjoyed that Brendan is willing to kill him and Paul. Brendan shoves Greg into another room. Suddenly, Greg gestures, lighting several candles and revealing a young woman spread on an altar. Greg and Paul urge Brendan to stab her, but the sisters arrive and free her. Before they can go after Greg and Paul, Paul repels them with a stream of electricity. Paul yells to Greg that they need Brendan on their side to defeat the sisters. Greg and Paul escape, while the sisters take Brendan home with them. Andy talks to the young woman and she gives the names of Brendan and Prue.

Prue shelters Brendan at the manor. He admits that he almost gave in to evil and is again unsure of himself. Prue believes in him, saying that she knows his good side is stronger. Her sisters, however, aren't as sure. However, Prue reminds them that both of them had encounters with evil and successfully fought them off (Piper with the Wendigo and Phoebe with the Woogyman). Andy shows up and demands to know where Brendan is. The sisters give no answers. Andy tells them that Father Austin is in critical condition. If Father Austin dies, Andy warns, he won't be able to look the other way if Prue is involved.

In Brendan's cell at the rectory, Greg and Paul chant, giving Brendan disturbed sleep and stirring up his warlock side. He joins them in the chant, then gets up and smashes a spider in a web. The next morning, Brendan returns to his cell and offers to join his brothers. Paul says that he needs merely to kill a mortal in order to be fully initiated as a warlock. However, Greg thinks that isn't enough, and demands that Brendan prove himself by sacrificing Prue and taking her powers.

The next morning, Prue and Piper find Brendan missing. Phoebe joins them and tells them that Rowe warlocks have been around since the tenth century, and no one has been able to figure out how to vanquish them. She also says that what she's read in the Book of Shadows, they won't have stand a chance if Greg and Paul have managed to turn Brendan. Prue meets Brendan at the rectory, and he pulls a knife out of the door. He says that his brothers cast a spell on him to make him see her as just another mortal. Just as Brendan goes after Prue, she flings him into a closet, and he assumes his demon face. Piper and Phoebe join them and Prue talks Brendan out of giving in to evil. He resumes his human face, and doesn't appear to remember anything.

Brendan and the sisters head downstairs, with Brendan in his vestments. Greg and Paul are waiting for them. Piper tries to freeze Paul, but he raises a force field around him. Phoebe throws Brendan's knife at Greg, but he raises a force field around him as well. Prue tries to fling them into the wall, but they still have their force fields up. Greg grabs the knife and is ready to throw it at Brendan, but Paul talks him into offering Brendan one more chance to turn. Brendan refuses. Enraged that Brendan has chosen good over evil, Greg throws the knife, but Paul jumps in front of it, proving his affection for his younger brother. Mortally wounded, Paul uses his last ounce of strength to throw the knife back at Greg, killing him as well. Brendan proceeds to his ordination.

Father Austin has identified Greg and Paul as his attackers; Brendan and Prue are off the hook. The sisters are together at Quake when Josh appears; it was Piper who called him and they seek another table."

The sisters learn of an abduction the prior day, and two more twenty years earlier, from the same spot. The demon shoots lightning upon David's eyes and he can no longer see.

Phoebe learns the name one of the kidnapping victims from twenty years ago, Brent Miller.

Eric Lohman appears at Prue's office. He claims to have seen her use magic and wants a story. Prue refuses to talk to him. He threatens to make her look bad in his story if she doesn't cooperate.

Phoebe tracks down Brent Miller. He is a successful software developer. He is unwilling to talk about his kidnapping, until Phoebe tells him about the recent ones. She believes his story about ""monsters"" abducting him. He mentions that the monsters said something about auras.

The demons peek out from the storm drain and see a glowing aura around a man. One gestures, and the man is strangled to death.

Piper and Phoebe consult the Book of Shadows about auras and identify the demons as grimlocks. The man is identified as Jerry Cartwright, a wealthy philanthropist.

Eric Lohman goes to Andy and asks after Prue. Lohman claims that Prue has powers and keeps popping up in unsolved murder cases. Andy refuses to comment.

Josh shows Piper a map of the storm drain system. Josh tells Piper that he has a new job in Beverly Hills, but he'll stay in San Francisco if Piper wants. Piper freezes him and rants out loud, deciding she needs more time to decide.

Brent recounts his kidnapping to Phoebe. Phoebe takes his hand and has a vision. Phoebe asks of anything he might have heard that could locate the grimlocks. Brent has a map of the public works; it has raised lines so he can feel it. Between his memories and Phoebe's vision, they are able to locate where he was held. Andy appears at Prue's office and wants to talk about the kidnapping, and what Lohman had told him of Prue's powers. He believes Prue is keeping a secret, but Prue is unsure of whether to reveal it.

Phoebe locates an entrance to the storm drain and goes to the manor. Piper meets Prue at the manor and a baby carriage rolls into the street. Piper freezes the scene. The neighbor doesn't have a baby, though, and there are only towels in the carriage.

The two sisters find Lohman there and return to their former location before unfreezing. Piper's purse is on the opposite shoulder, and Lohman got this on tape. Phoebe comes in, followed by Lohman. He confronts them about the tape and Prue throws him out.

Phoebe and Piper gather maps and go to the storm drain instance, while Prue distracts Lohman. When Phoebe and Piper drive off, Lohman tries to follow, but Prue flings a screwdriver into his tire. Andy goes to Brent and he tells her about Phoebe; Andy follows Piper and Phoebe to the storm drain. Piper falls into a deep hole, alerting the grimlocks. Phoebe calls Prue, who is mixing potions. She comes out and finds that Lohman has disabled her car. She, at last, agrees to talk and the two go to the storm drain.

Lohman follows Prue into the storm drain. A grimlock finds Piper and starts to strangle her; Prue flings a metal bar into it's head. A grimlock kills Lohman. Prue uses her power to get Piper out of the hole, but she is injured and the others lead her up toward the street. Andy arrives and shoots a grimlock, but the bullets do no harm. Prue flings it off of him and now Andy knows that Prue has powers. The sisters hand Piper off to Andy, who returns to the street. Phoebe's aura A grimlock confronts Phoebe and Prue. Prue throws a potion, melting it. Phoebe finds the children. The other grimlock appears and Prue drops her remaining potion. The grimlock tries to strangle Prue. Phoebe hits it in the head. It turns on Phoebe and now Prue flings the potion off the ground onto the grimlock, killing it. The boys' vision is restored, and so is Brent's.

The guard collapses and Jackson enters his body, his ride off the island. Claire threatens to fire Prue if she continues to have so many emergencies. Right after this, Phoebe calls and tells what she's found out about the ""Ghost of Alcatraz"". Some ghosts, according to Phoebe, need a dead body to transport them across water and Phoebe fears that Jackson might be at large on the mainland.

Darryl and Andy receive evidence about a murder; he is stabbed thirteen times in a circular pattern. A fingerprint on the weapon matches Jackson Ward, but he was executed 36 years earlier. Andy goes to the Charmed Ones and Phoebe tells him of the ghost. The murder victim was the son of the D.A. who had prosecuted Jackson Ward.

Jackson appears in the office of Judge Renault, who had presided over his trial. He picks up objects of the judge's desk, spooking him. Jackson chokes and then stabs the judge.

Prue shows up late for a meeting with some Japanese investors. Andy pulls her aside and tells of the latest murder. Prue wants to keep her job and so goes back to the investors. Afterwards, she and Andy go to the Book of Shadows. Phoebe has found a spell, but only a ghost can say it. The Book flips to the truth spell and Prue admits having cast it on Andy (""The Truth Is Out There... and It Hurts""). He is upset with her.

Andy checks out the weapon from one the murder of Judge Renault. Darryl confronts Andy about his secretive ways. Inspector Rodriguez from Internal Affairs wants to ask Darryl about Andy.

Jackson stabs at Andy, distracting him, and Prue is able to finish the spell. Andy finishes reviving Prue. Claire is firing Prue, when Andy walks in and covers for her. Claire changes her mind about firing Prue. Andy decides that life with a witch is not for him.

At the end of the episode, Prue burns all the files that Andy had collected about them and Piper flies home early, as she worries that something is up with her sisters, but they deny it together."

Leo appears behind her. Daisy is relieved to see him; she thought he was Alec, a Darklighter who has been chasing her for some time. Leo heals her hand, much to Daisy's amazement. Leo tells Daisy that he brought her to San Francisco, because he has ""powerful friends"" who can help protect her. He also tells her that he's made her invisible to Alec. At that moment, Alec appears. Daisy flees. Alec conjures a crossbow and shoots Leo in the shoulder. Leo orbs to the manor. Prue and Phoebe are planning a vacation in Cabo San Lucas. Piper calls from the attic; she has found Leo with an arrow in his shoulder. Leo admits that he is really their Whitelighter. Leo warns Phoebe and Piper that the arrow is poison-tipped. Prue returns to the attic with several bandages, and uses her power to remove the arrow. Leo tells the sisters about Alec and Daisy. He was protecting Daisy, because she has been identified as a future Whitelighter. Alec was originally after Daisy to seduce her and produce Darklighter spawn. However,

they fell in love, until she found out what he was. Alec, like most Darklighters, has the touch of death. Andy and Darryl are together at their desk, when Prue calls Andy. Andy can't talk now, as Darryl knows he's hiding something, so Prue offers to meet at Quake. Andy tells Prue to be careful, as Internal Affairs is after him. Prue tells Andy about Daisy; he offers to review security cameras to find her. Leo is bandaged up, but the arrow's poison is slowly killing him, and he can't use his healing power on himself. With his powers fading, he is losing his ability to cloak Daisy.

Alec orbs into Daisy's hotel room and won't leave her alone. The motel manager knocks, and then unlocks the door. Alec kills the manager as Daisy flees through the fire escape. Andy and Prue arrive, and Prue flings Alec across the room. Alec orbs out but, unlike Leo, his orbs are black.

Piper has found a power-switching spell in the Book of Shadows, and thinks she can use it to switch her powers with Leo, so she can heal him. With Prue and Phoebe all present, Piper casts the spell. Kit walks in and Piper tries to freeze her, but can't. Suddenly, Prue touches Phoebe and has a premonition of Kit apparently knocking over a lamp. Kit walks up to the lamp and Phoebe tries to shoo her away, and in the process, flings the lamp into the wall, shattering it. Piper must have Leo's healing power, but she doesn't know how to use it. Prue tells Piper that she has to figure out how to trigger Leo's power, just like they had to find their triggers when their own powers were unbound.

Andy calls and says that Daisy has bought a bus ticket.

Inspectors Rodriguez and Anderson grill Andy about the scene in the hotel. Rather than answer, Andy turns in his badge and his gun.

Daisy reaches the bus station and finds Alec everywhere she turns. Prue and Phoebe walk in. Prue tries to goad Phoebe into getting angry; she knows that her telekinesis was originally triggered by anger. Finally, Prue remembers that during high school, several guys called Phoebe ""Freebie"", after they caught her making out under the bleachers; the insult causes Phoebe to knock some magazines off a rack. Prue has a vision of Daisy cowering in the ladies' room. Prue and Phoebe confront Alec in the ladies' room. Alec conjures his crossbow. Phoebe tries to fling it out of his hand, but only causes all of the taps to come on and all of the soap to squirt out of the dispensers. Prue admits that she hit Grams' car several years ago an accident for which Phoebe took the heat. Phoebe flings Alec into a stall. Alec drops the crossbow. Prue picks it up, takes aim and shoots, but Alec black-orbs away. The two sisters bring Daisy to the manor.

Andy has sent flowers to Prue and the card says he needs to see her. Prue leaves to meet with Andy, while Daisy and Phoebe go to the attic. They find Leo almost dead and Piper crying. Daisy tries to leave, but Piper convinces her to stay.

Phoebe tries using telekinesis on Alec but she hits the chandelier instead Andy tells Prue that he has turned in his badge and is suspended. He warns her to be careful, and that it's best that they not be seen together, lest Rodriguez find out that Prue is his source. Andy adds that Prue and her sisters are doing the very thing that made him want to become a cop. Piper, upset, cries over Leo's body. She has tried to heal him several times, but can't figure out his trigger. She collapses on his body and tells him that she loves him.

Suddenly, her hands start to glow, and Leo is healed. He tells her that love triggers his healing power, but she had to find that out for herself. They come downstairs and prepare to call Prue, when Alec black-orbs in. Phoebe tries to blow him out the door, but knocks the chandelier down instead. Alec grabs Piper and offers to spare her life, if the sisters let him have Daisy. Prue comes in behind him. Alec tosses Piper aside, grabs Daisy and black-orbs out. Leo feels too weak to use his powers, so the four leave their powers switched. Leo coaches Piper on how to sense a charge. Piper finds Daisy and Phoebe and Prue go after her while Piper stays with Leo. They find Daisy and Alec in a cemetery, where Alec is about to sacrifice Daisy. Phoebe flings Alec aside. Prue casts the power-switching spell, just as Alec is about to use his touch of death on Daisy. Suddenly, Prue's hand starts glowing red-hot; she has Alec's touch of death and realizes hate is the trigger for it. Phoebe draws Alec towardsPrue. Prue incinerates Alec with his own power and switches their powers back just before he dies. Prue says that she never had to feel so much hate before and doesn't want to ever feel it again.

The sisters and Leo switch their powers back. Leo, himself, had been an Army medic in World War II. He died in the war and was offered the chance to become a Whitelighter. He accepted, but would give it all up for life with Piper. However, Piper thinks that would be too much of a loss for him.

Andy and Darryl meet at a noisy construction site. Rodriguez and Anderson are watching and using a long-range microphone, but the noise makes the microphone useless. Rodriguez, however, hears Andy mention Prue. Anderson wonders how that's possible. Suddenly, Rodriguez' eyes turn fiery red and he sonic screams. The sound penetrates Anderson's earphones, and he falls dead on the steering column.

Piper puts on Leo's dogtags, while Prue and Phoebe mix tropical drinks to make up for not making it to Cabo."

He is really a demon who was sent by The Source to find out why the ranks of evildoers have been decimated over the past few months. The demon Tempus appears to him. Tempus says he was sent by The Source to help kill the Charmed Ones, and offers to help Rodriguez.

Piper is at Quake planning a segment for the Food Network. She spilled marinara sauce on her dress, and asks Phoebe to bring her a new one. Across the street from the manor, a neighbor's car is hit. Prue has a newspaper announcing that Andy is suspected in Anderson's death. Phoebe takes the newspaper and has a premonition of herself and Piper bending over Andy's lifeless body. He looked as if he'd been hurled across the room by a demon or warlock.

Rodriguez calls in Andy and tells him that a supernatural being killed Anderson. He also knows Prue is a witch and wants to meet her. He will drop all charges against Andy, if Prue can help him find Anderson's killer. Andy pretends to scoff at the notion of Prue being a witch. Darryl enters; Andy says he needs to talk to Prue right away. Darryl reveals that Prue just called and wants to talk to him as well.

Rodriguez meets Tempus near a clock shop. He fully expects Andy to warn Prue, and is also certain Piper and Phoebe will be with her when they meet. Tempus doesn't think Rodriguez is powerful enough to kill the sisters, but Rodriguez is confident he'll succeed.

Phoebe goes to Quake and tells Piper of her premonition. The producer from the Food Network comes in -- an old classmate of Piper's, Joanne Hertz. Joanne brags about her life, humiliating Piper.

Prue goes to Andy and warns him of Phoebe's premonition. Andy suspects that the demon that killed Anderson is Rodriguez; it's the only feasible explanation for how he knows Prue's secret. Prue decides to meet Rodriguez at the manor, together with her sisters. Prue asks Andy not to come to the manor.

Rodriguez goes to the manor as Andy watches him enter. Kit is outside, and yowls at Rodriguez. Rodriguez rings the bell and Phoebe answers the door. Rodriguez shows his badge. Phoebe calls for her sisters. Suddenly, Rodriguez' eyes turn fiery red, and he throws an energy ball at Phoebe, killing her instantly. He throws another at Piper, but she freezes it, and then Prue deflects it back at Rodriguez, killing him. Tempus resets time and summons Rodriguez, still convulsing from the energy ball. Tempus tells Rodriguez he will remember what happened the previous times and to learn from his previous mistake.

Phoebe has a déjà vu experience. She believes the day is repeating, but Prue doesn't believe her. She hears the neighbor's car being hit again. Prue shows Phoebe the newspaper and Phoebe recognizes it, and the premonition.

Rodriguez cuts his deal with Andy again. He is in a much fouler mood than before. Back at the clock shop, Rodriguez remembers that he killed Phoebe before she could even react, but Piper froze the energy ball he threw at her. Tempus suggests anticipating where Piper will be and kill her first, before she has a chance to freeze him.

Phoebe goes to Quake and tells Piper of her déjà vu. When Joanne shows up, Phoebe knows her name and her bragging. Piper freezes Joanne and Phoebe tells Piper what Joanne said the last time. She thinks the only reason she knows what's happening is that her power allows her to see the past and the future.

Prue, again, goes to Andy. Again, she plans to meet Rodriguez and warns Andy to stay away.

Rodriguez, again, goes to the manor, with Andy watching. Kit yowls at Rodriguez. Phoebe has been searching the Book of Shadows for information on time loops; all she's found is a spell to accelerate time. Rodriguez bursts through the door and kills Phoebe with an energy ball. Before Piper can make a move, Rodriguez throws another energy ball at her, killing her. He hurls a third at Prue, but she deflects it back, killing him again. Tempus resets time and, again, summons Rodriguez. Rodriguez says he succeeded in part by killing two of the sisters, but Tempus tells him to learn where he erred so he can get them all.

Phoebe, again, has her déjà vu experience. She leads Prue to the window and shows her the neighbor's car being hit. She also tells Prue of her premonition, without having touched the newspaper. She's now convinced that they're caught in some sort of time loop and that she's the only one who recognizes this.

Rodriguez, now in a very foul mood, meets Tempus at the clock shop. He plans to kill Prue first this time.

Prue meets with Andy and tells him of the time loop. Andy suspects that the demon is after the Charmed Ones, not him. Prue still insists that he stay away from the manor.

Rodriguez, again, goes to the manor and, again, Kit yowls. Rodriguez glares demonically at Kit. Andy notices his reaction and realizes his hunch was right; Rodriguez is the demon. He pulls his gun out of the glove compartment and rushes out of his car.

The sisters find Tempus in the Book and see they must remove him from his time to send him away. At that moment, Rodriguez bursts into the manor and throws an energy ball at Prue, but Piper pushes Prue out of the way just in time. They both land hard on the floor; Prue is knocked out. Andy charges into the manor and shoots at Rodriguez, who kills him with an energy ball. However, Rodriguez is distracted and Piper freezes him. Piper and Phoebe tie Rodriguez to a chair. Phoebe wants to kill Rodriguez to restart the day and save Andy. Rodriguez is surprised that Phoebe knows about the time loop, and Phoebe reveals she knows about Tempus as well. Rodriguez dares Phoebe to kill him. Piper doesn't agree; she thinks that Rodriguez will kill them all, if the day is restarted again.

Prue meets Andy in a ghostly place. He knows he is dead, but thinks they weren't supposed to save him after all. He tells Prue to go back and continue the fight. Andy vanishes, and Prue hears Phoebe calling for her. Prue comes to and sees Andy dead.

The sisters find the time-acceleration spell in the Book. Piper and Phoebe think they should roll back time, but Prue thinks they have to accelerate time to break the time loop and get rid of Tempus. Prue casts the spell and time rolls forward to midnight, breaking the time loop. Tempus cries out and bursts into flames. Prue unties Rodriguez; she realizes he wouldn't have needed Tempus if he was powerful enough to kill them. Prue orders him to leave. Rodriguez walks to the door, but then, whirls around and throws an energy ball. Prue deflects it back at him and he is finally vanquished for good. Prue breaks down crying over Andy's body.

Andy is cleared of Anderson's murder and is buried with full honors.

Piper quits her job at Quake. She wants to be a chef and own a restaurant. Piper and Phoebe find Prue sitting outside. She tells them that Rodriguez is now the prime suspect in Anderson's murder, but they'll never find him. Prue thinks about all that's happened since they became witches; their lives have been thrown off a lot, but they've done a lot of good. The sisters head back inside, and Prue telekinetically swings the door closed behind them."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0543930/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,The team is searching for a suspected serial killer. The murders started with a young man who was hitchhiking home from the casino after winning $3000. They have little to go on other than a boot print.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Marita Grabiak'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"The episode opens with the Delaware State Police sending a ""teletype"" request for Philly to check all recent cases, open or closed, that involve young male hitchhikers being shot in isolated woods off major roads. The squad members remember such a case which turned out to be that of Matt Mills. He was a very good-looking boy who had won $3000 gambling in Atlantic City, but missed his bus, was seen hitchhiking home, and then found shot execution-style in woods; the body positions and 38 caliber gun matching two other cases in NJ and DE. Other evidence available for the three cases included shoe prints, and a few fibers.

Looking into the records of the victim, he and a friend, Blaine Robbins, had tried to rob a convenience store in Philly a few years before his murder when they were juveniles. They had been caught by the Russian-immigrant owner who was angered that they were released with probation. The robbery plan had been to raise capital for a legitimate vending machine business planned by Blaine. After that, Matt reformed, stayed out of trouble, and got a good entry-level brokerage-firm job.

Looking into Matt's last day in Atlantic City, Blaine said that he met Matt there by accident but couldn't give him a ride home because he had no car.

Other evidence linked the three crimes to a truck driver whose route matched all three locations. Locating a long-time girlfriend who had originally met him while working as a whore at truck stops, she described violent sexually abusive behavior which could just as easily be directed to boys. Fibers from her carpet were consistent with but not unique enough to match the crime scenes. When bought in for questioning, he was arrogant and denied any connection, and agreed to take a lie-detector test, which was useless as he could lie on the control questions without detection. In his arrogance, he had put his feet on their table in front of the officers. Lilly noted that one shoe was worn in a distinctive clutch-pedal pattern, which turned out to match the other two cases but not Matt's. The Delaware police were very thankful for Lilly solving their case.

One of the squad members had formally been at the precinct where the convenience store robbery had occurred. Asking there, he found that the Russian had recently been reported shooting at other robbers. The Russian admitted it, and told from whom he had both got and later returned the gun after using it. But the gun had been sold again and was unavailable. After finding that the Russian's wife had won an Atlantic City excursion, the Russian admitted that he had lied about working at his store the day of the murder, and had in fact seen both boys in Atlantic City but that Blaine had driven off from the hotel before he met up with them. With further extremely intensive questioning by Scotty, the Russian then admitted that yes, he had killed Matt in the manner they said, but please don't hurt his family.

Although Scotty was proud of eliciting a confession, the captain who had been observing wasn't so sure, as it looked like the Russian would have confessed to anything at that point. He held off arresting the Russian and suggested another trip to New Jersey, as further investigation of Blaine's database records had found an employment address at a car-rental company.

The car-rental manager said that shortly after that time, he had turned over a gun, which turned out to be a 38, to his local police after confiscating it from Blaine and firing him for bringing it into work. They then looked at rental records and found that there was one car with unexplained mileage on it that Blaine could have used that day. With more inquiries, they found that Blaine had paid $3000 a few months after Matt's death for flying lessons in a scheme to make money in aerial advertising.

Finally, Blaine confessed, saying that they had been best friends but that Matt had ridiculed and ignored him. In the flashback, they met accidently in the casino, and discussed Blaine's tip from a casino worker about an IPO that needed an investment in a few days; Matt was not enthusiastic, and said he would check with analysts at his firm, and besides, where would they get capital? Then Blaine showed him a gun and told him his plan to rob the casino. Matt treated him like a child, and said he would warn the casino security if he acted like he was going to do anything like that. Later when Matt was hitchhiking, Blaine stops and says he wants to apologize and give him a ride home. After Matt gets in, the next thing we see is Blaine leading Matt at gunpoint into the woods.

In the follow up, Scotty is seen apologizing to the Russian and his family at their store.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7182550/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,New recruit Ben Warren has to get used to the fact that emergencies at the fire department are different than in the hospital; events at an apartment fire leave the future of the station's leadership in jeopardy.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Paris Barclay'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"A woman is on her laptop in bed, cyber stalking her ex-boyfriend. She calls her friend who convinces her to log off the computer. She puts the lid down, while keeping the laptop on her pillow, and goes into her bathroom. Sparks begin to fly from the power cord ... and the pillow ignites.

A voice-over begins in a woman's voice. This is the first clue that we have entered Shonda-Land! Fire engines are racing to the scene in all their fire-engine glory. They arrive at a home with smoke billowing out while the voice over continues, talking about the legendary file pole that we all imagine fire fighters slide down with every call. The crew rushes to put the fire out, while Captain Obvious orders, ""Contain the flames and get the hell out!"" I could have called that play, and I don't even have any fire training. He barks some other orders and assignments for his team to pair up. The crew enter a smoky house looking for the victim and the source of the flames. Quite naturally, they find the cyber stalker on her bathroom floor, coughing from smoke inhalation. I have questions: Why didn't she open the window? Or put a towel under the door to keep smoke from seeping into the bathroom she is trapped in? Didn't she smell the smoke? They remove her from the bathroom. Another eye-rolling sentence is now delivered by the ones who are not on rescue: ""The wet stuff on the red stuff!"" In case we weren't sure what methods they would use to extinguish the fire. The victim is pulled from the home and tells the team that ""Charlie is still in the house. The men inside think it's a child. However, they find a dog hiding under a chair. Two female fire fighters complain that even though they were the ones to rescue the cyber stalker, that she only thanked the one male fire fighter who put her dog in her arms. They declare that next time, they will be the ones who save the puppy. In true Shonda fashion, feminism will be a major plot theme.

The team heads back to the station while opening credits begin to flash across the screen. We begin to get a good look at all of the members at Station 19 now. Ben Warren, being offended that he's referred to as a ""probie"" - he's been there a full two weeks now, y'all! Because being a surgeon in his past automatically should exempt him from probie-ship. He is our cross over from Grey's Anatomy character. Next is Victoria ""Vic"" Hughes - who ruthlessly mocks him. Next is Jack Gibson, the McSteamy of Station 19. Maybe we should call him McSmoky. In fact, he looks and acts very much like Mark Sloan of Grey's ... I wonder if the casting call specifically stated that the role required that the actor must resemble Eric Dane? Jack is talking to Captain Obvious, otherwise known as Captain Pruitt Herrera. Jack thinks that their successful fire extinguishing and cyber stalker dog owner rescuing today should make today a pole day. Pruitt shuts that down quick and puts the cocky Jack in his place. I like him already. Next up is Travis Montgomery, Maya Bishop, and Andrea ""Andy"" Herrera, who is Pruitt's daughter. They, along with Vic, look longingly at the pole. There may be something Freudian about that. Andy fusses over her father and he resents it. It's clear that she acts as her father's Administrative Assistant at the firehouse, along with her normal fire-fighting duties, and keeps the place running smoothly for him. And now, if you haven't put the clues together yet, this is a Grey's Anatomy Spin Off, as it states clearly across the bottom of the screen at just six minutes in: ""Based on Grey's Anatomy created by Shonda Rimes."" Thanks. The Eric Dane doppelganger didn't completely make that clear.

The scene changes to the crew eating dinner together. The last fire-fighter we meet is Dean, who is complaining about the quality of the meal being cooked by Travis. His complaint is that the meal is made up entirely of vegetables. It's revealed that Maya, the token blonde goddess, is an Olympic Gold Medal winner. Pruitt tells an embarrassing story about Andy from when she was a child. This is meant to relay to the audience that Andy is fiercely independent. As the conversation turns away from Andy, she gets up and leaves the table in her embarrassed angst. Jack follows her and here we are, at eight and a half minutes in, and Jack and Andy are getting ready to hook up. However, Andy finds a small jewelry box in Jack's pocket, pulls it out, and opens it to reveal an engagement ring. She is decidedly displeased and Jack back-pedals from an actual proposal. Before she can explain her lack of enthusiasm, the fire alarms go off and the team needs to respond to a fire.

En route to the fire, Maya questions Andy about what's wrong, just from the look on Andy's face. Without Andy saying anything, Maya figures out there was some sort of marriage proposal and that it didn't go well. They are such good friends, that they can have a conversation just with Andy's facial expressions. Arriving at the scene of the fire, they see a police car is blocking the fire hydrant. The police car, we learn, belongs to Andy's high school sweetheart, Ryan Tanner. Andy pushes his car out of the way with her firetruck, and has a shouting match with Ryan, taking her frustrations with Jack out on him. Yeah, we get it: Andy's a badass. The team enters the building in pairs. Jack goes into a child's bedroom away from Pruitt and loses him (against protocols). Jack calls for help and the team finds Pruitt collapsed and unconscious. They pull him out just before part of the fire explodes. They get Pruitt out just in time by jumping out a window since the fire has blocked them off from an escape. They land on landing airbags that have been deployed. Andy starts to hyperventilate, and Jack asks if she is all right. She pushes him away, so he walks off. Ryan comes up and calms her down a bit.

Pruitt is rushed off to Grey Sloan Memorial and of course Miranda Bailey (Ben's wife) is his doctor. Because this is a Grey's Anatomy Spin Off. Cue Meredith Grey cameo. Because this is a Grey's Anatomy Spin Off. Meredith takes Andy to a supply closet and lets her cry for a few moments before telling her to put on her game face and be brave for her team.

Pruitt awakes in a hospital bed with Andy hovering over him. She reads off from a note that he has stage 2 cancer. He never told her about it. He says he needs to step down as Captain. He says Jack will be in charge. Andy is clearly annoyed about that.

Cut to Andy at home. She is doing laundry and getting buzzed on beer. Ryan stops by. He announces he moved back in with his parents next door. He wants to know how she is. She is annoyed, she says everyone is making decisions about her life without her and lists all the ways her life is messed up. I am really not liking her, she's a narcissistic brat. Ryan, though, thinks she is being taken advantage of and encourages her to take over instead of Jack. She says she can't bury another parent (her mother has died before the series), and Ryan tries to offer comforting words. She throws herself at him, and here we are, at 27 minutes in, and she's hooking up with him. Earlier in the day she's screaming at him about his parking, now she's jumping on him. So much for that engagement!

Miranda shows up at the Station to check the place out. Ben's kicking himself over nothing and Miranda tells him to stop showing off. Jack finds Maya in the locker room and tries to talk to her about Andy and her unenthusiastic reaction to his non-proposal. Andy shows up behind Jack and hides but is eavesdropping. He says to Maya that if Andy doesn't love him then she should just tell him. I agree. Jack's too good for her. I can tell this already. Maya and Andy go running together and Andy tells her she slept with Ryan. Maya encourages her to be a strong independent woman and to forget about the boys for now.

Another fire rescue call, and Ryan is there. There is awkwardness all around between Ryan, Jack and Andy. Andy tells Ryan they have nothing to talk about, and Ryan says they are all good. Andy wants to know what that means. A college co-ed has gotten herself stuck between two building walls. She thought it was a shortcut. Andy is trying to free her. Jack asks how its going and Andy is short with him, causing the co-ed to start panicking. Andy gets her to calm down. Its unclear how they get her out, and Jack tells Andy how great she is. If he only knew. He tells her he thinks she is being taken advantage of by her Pruitt. He says he won't overlook her if he is put in charge of the Station.

She tells Pruitt that she wants to be considered for the Captain position. There's a problem: she's not a lieutenant like Jack is. She tells him to promote her. She says she is putting her hat in the ring.

Back at the Station, Ben is still trying to fit in with Vic and Travis. Vic starts calling him Warren, showing that she really does know his name. Back at the hospital, Pruitt tells Jack that he's stepping down, that he is promoting Andy to lieutenant, and that he is depending on the two of them to run the Station.

Back at the station, Dean reveals that he is in a relationship with the girl who's puppy he saved in the beginning of the show. Jack and Andy tell the team that they will both be running the Station for now. Andy tells everyone to go down the pole. Jack is not looking as on board with things as Andy is."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7182534/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"With the absence of Captain Pruitt, Andy and Jack try to navigate how to work together, and a car accident puts the crew's lives at risk.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Paris Barclay'],"['', '']",[],['car'],[],"The episode opens with a couple in bed and a periodically chirping smoke alarm. The lady says she changed the battery only yesterday, but it keeps chirping, and she can't ""get into it."" When it chirps again, her partner knocks it off the ceiling.

Pruitt is giving Andy instructions on how to manage the team from his hospital bed while Andy is ordering him a healthy meal from the cafeteria. Ben is dropping his stepson Tuck off at school, and Tuck is having hard time adjusting to Ben's new shift schedule and not being there all the time for him. Dean is woken up by Charlie, the dog he rescued in Episode 1. He says the only reason why the dog is there is because his owner's new place doesn't allow pets. What kind of anti-pet place does she live in, for Pete's sake? How can you not like dogs? Back to Pruitt and Andy bickering. He wants to be released today, not tomorrow. Back to Ben and Tuck bickering. Ben suggests Tuck come to the Station after school. Tuck, being a typical kid not being told what he wants to hear, gives Ben a look of disdain as he gets out of the car. Dean realizes Charlie used his alarm clock as a chew toy. Pruitt gives Andy advice on how to handle Battalion Chief Frankel, who seems to be the person who will be making the decision of who will become Captain of Station 19. Andy, in her usual over-confident self, says she knows how to handle Frankel.

Andy and Maya are in the Station, and Maya is giving Andy a pep talk of how to handle Frankel and how to view McSmokey as her opponent, not ex-boyfriend. Frankel walks in and informs them that they are the least exciting thing on her schedule, she wants to get these interviews over quickly. They head into a conference room, and Jack pulls the chair out for her. She says she hope she isn't trying to win favor with her. He assures her he was just being respectful. She congratulates Andy on her promotion. She talks about how tough it was to earn her rank and had nobody helping her. Andy is knocked down a peg by that, feeling the unseen slap. Frankel informs them that for now, one of them will be supervising the team for each shift and that they will be switching off. It will take months to fill the permanent Captain position. They have to take written exams, their peers need to be interviewed, as well as interviews with all levels of the Fire Department hierarchy. Frankel herself will be evaluating them. She says Andy is up first. McSmokey looks like smoke is coming out of his ears.

Andy, McSmokey and Frankel head downstairs and Andy calls the team to order. The only one who looks up is Maya, hahaha! McSmokey gets the rest of the team's attention and tells them to listen up. Andy says she wants the team to work on some basics. She instructs them to pair off, but with new partners, not the folks they are used to pairing off with. Ben and Vic are paired up. Vic displays her enthusiasm at this prospect rather unvigorously. She tells Ben not to screw up while the Battalion Chief is watching. McSmokey is timing them on some drills. Ben doesn't do well.

Frankel takes her leave and assures Andy that she will be popping in and out unscheduled. Just before Frankel hits the door, Dean rushes in late. Andy, feeling the need to assert her authority in front of Frankel, puts Dean on reception duty. Dean laughs, and Andy stares him down. She says that rules are rules. Dean argues that those are Pruitt's rules, and that Pruitt isn't even there. Andy tells him to take a seat. She's going all in since Frankel is watching her. The fire alarms go off and the team heads out, minus Dean.

Maya is pumped that she is driving the fire engine. Maya is giving Andy a pep talk again. Seems to be Maya's thing. Ben says, from the back, that he's not that excited - they've been called to Tuck's school. They meet the principal in the parking lot, who says it is probably a false alarm, while scolding some kids around her who are being little hoodlums, doing things they know they shouldn't be doing. The principal addresses McSmokey, asking if they can disable the alarm and get the kids back inside quickly. Andy bristles at that and brings the principal's attention on her. Looks like Andy is having difficulty with what they call ""presence.""

Andy barks assignments to the team and they all scatter. Right when she says she will check in with law enforcement, her ex shows up. Uncanny timing, Ryan.

Ben and Vic enter the school and disarm the pulled fire alarm. The alarm, when pulled, ejects some sort of colored gel so that they know who will have pulled the alarm. They are continuing to sweep the school and Tuck shows up and says, ""Hey, Dad."" He has his back turned to them, his hands shoved in his pockets, and acting super sus. When Ben asks him why he's not outside, Tuck walks off. Ben follows him, and grabs his arm. Tuck's hands are blue. Ben asks why Tuck pulled the alarm and Tuck says it was the quickest way he could get him there, no questions asked. Ben's like, what the whaty-what? And Tuck leads him into a bathroom. There, on the floor, is a student in labor. Tuck asks his father if he can help.

The girl's name is Ava. Her contractions are two minutes apart and her mother is the school principal. Who somehow hasn't noticed that her daughter is pregnant. Ava confirms that her mother pays attention to every kid except for her. Ben is having a heart attack, wondering how he's going to explain to Miranda that her son knocked someone up at their age, which looks to be about 12. Tuck assures him that he's not the father, he and Ava are just friends. The boyfriend/father isn't in school today because he is at the orthodontist getting his braces off. Dayum, Shonda! Ava's contractions seem pretty painful, even for a 12-year-old. Vic tells Ben that Ava is fully dilated, and she pushes him out of the way. Apparently, she has forgotten that he was a surgeon who went through medical school. They prepare for delivery.

Back at the Station, Dean is bored at the reception desk and is sharpening pencils. Lots of pencils. Apparently, the computer in front of him is not equipped with Solitaire or the Internet, or surely he'd be on social media to pass the time. The young lady from the first scene appears with her battered smoke detector. She asks if Dean can fix it. Dean and the girl, J.J., are flirting. She tells Dean that the smoke detector keeps going off, even though she keeps changing the batteries. Hmmm, a smoke detector that goes off, usually indicates, I don't know, smoke of some sort, right? I have questions. Dean tells her to get a new one, but she says she likes this one. I like many things in my house, but I've never had a preference of the smoke detectors. I like any that work. I'm just saying, is all. They continue to flirt.

At the school, Andy confirms it was a false alarm to Ryan. They are awkward. McSmokey comes back and confirms an all-clear to her, and she walks off to double check his work. Ryan tells Jack that he has his work cut out to win the Captain position, because Andy doesn't lose at anything.

Andy is griping to Maya about how Jack had to get the team's attention and that the principal assumed Jack was in charge. Maya tells her that she has to take the power. Girl power! Andy wants to get the kids back to class because Frankel will be checking how long they were at a false alarm.

Back in the labor and delivery room - I mean, lavatory, Ben tells Andy that they need some medical supplies from the Aid Car. Andy has already dismissed the Aid Car. Hmm, this looks like it may have been a big no-no.

Back at the Station, Dean is fixing the beaten smoke detector, and continuing to flirt with J.J. Travis walks in on them. He wants to know how long J.J. has been there since she is in her stocking feet. Since Travis is needling him, Dean finishes fixing the smoke detector and sends J.J. on her way. The Aid Car is called out. Travis takes Dean with him.

Back at the school, Andy is trying to get the Aid Car back, and the principal overhears her and demands to know why they need an Aid Car. She knows Andy isn't telling her everything.

Back in the labor and delivery lavatory, Ava has to start pushing. She is terrified. Vic tries to calm her a bit by getting everyone to sing ""I'm A Little Teapot."" The baby is born still in the amniotic sac. Dayum, Shonda! The baby isn't moving. Andy is requesting a status report. Ben and Vic aren't sure what to do. The baby moves and they decide to break the amniotic sac instead of waiting for the Aid Car. The baby, of course, is okay.

The principal comes into the lavatory, and tends to her daughter and grandchild. Andy defensively tells Ben that she made the right call by dismissing the Aid Car when she did. He never even brought it up and is taken aback by her reaction. He tells Tuck to scrub his hands, take his sweatshirt off, and not tell Miranda that he was the one who pulled the fire alarm.

Is it just me, or was pulling that alarm a little, I don't know, extreme, to get his father there? I have questions.

Travis and Dean arrive at a retirement home. Their patient is a Mr. Paige, who can't get up off his shower stool. Because he is caught in it. If you need me to spell out how, watch the episode. They get him free, help him dress, and talk to him about his family, who don't visit often. Travis reveals that he is lonely. He lost his husband the year before in a fire. They tell Mr. Paige that some of the women at the retirement home were asking after him. This cheers him up. I am not sure if Shonda is suggesting to us that Mr. Paige purposely caught himself in the shower stool to get some company? If so, extreme. Shonda is certainly extreme.

Back at the Station, Vic asks Andy why she sent the Aid Car away. Andy says it was protocol. Vic says she jumped the gun. Andy doesn't take that very well. Back in her father's office, McSmokey comes in to chat. He overheard the Vic comments. At first, he bucks her up a little, but when she gets condescending with him, he tells her that he is a shoo-in for Captain. Andy clearly annoyed.

The team is called out to a motor vehicle accident. There is an overturned tanker, but no fire. They split up to look for and assist victims. Dean, who is supposed to be on desk duty and Andy knows it, and Travis try to help a man, Shawn, out of his car. The truck driver is laying in the middle of the road, and Vic and Ben are helping him. They notice and remark that it is unusually hot. They assume it is from the truck. Vic is spooked. A firefighter who is not with their station starts yelling for them to put him out. He looks like he is battling flames but there are none. Andy orders that all the headlights on the vehicles be shut off, revealing the fire fighter is indeed on fire with pale blue flames. They are able to rescue him and put him out, but there is blue fire all over the road, closing off Vic, Ben and their victim. The tanker is leaking ethanol and the water from the hose will make it spread. They have no more foam and need to have some brought to them. Vic and Ben look for ways to escape but they can't, and won't leave the victim. As their options narrow and the flames grow closer, Vic becomes rattled. Without speaking, so as not to burn their lungs, Ben and Vic silently ""sing"" ""I'm A Little Teapot."" He is trying to keep her from panicking. The team decide to back one of the fire trucks over the flames and pull Vic, Ben and the victim onto the back of the truck. They rescue them and somehow, the truck doesn't catch on fire.

Back at the Station, Vic and Ben are being cared for by the team. Andy is invigorated. Pruitt has been released and Ryan had picked him up. He had heard about the tanker fire and figured Andy was busy. Pruitt congratulates the group. The team excitedly tells Pruitt about it, but Vic walks away. Ben comes and finds her. Vic says she has never gotten that close to death before. She is still rattled.

Tuck comes into the Station and says he thought he would stop by. But the alarm goes off. However, Tuck has renewed respect for him, and encourages him to go, he will be back later. Andy and McSmokey exchange some sexually charged comments. Dean and Ben arrive at an apartment where the landlord says a neighbor heard some screams. They hear a woman in obvious pain, and it is J.J. on the floor. Her smoke detector is chirping again, and she fell off a ladder trying to get to it. Dean says he definitely fixed the smoke detector, but its still chirping. Hmm ... smoke detectors usually go off when they detect smoke, right? Dean is examining the ceiling, and J.J. tells him there is a crawl space up there. He punches through her ceiling with his ax and smoke comes billowing out. Didn't she smell the smoke? Would you not smell the smoke even if it was enclosed? How long was it enclosed? I have questions, Shonda!"

Once again Waits taunts Bosch saying they are dogs from the same kennel and both kill people. Waits tosses his burner cell out his van window and drives off. Harry quickly gets the call traced as an exigent emergency. Arriving at the location a couple of other squad cars are there with a street kid who had picked up the phone.

Bosch shows Jerry Edgar the French skull book; another detective, Kiz Ryder, says there is no passport record on Waits.

Wait's mother notices she is out of Prednisone, she panics, whistling for David, sends him out to refill the prescription.

Harry meets Eleanor at a hotel; she is in LA for a card game. Wish gives him a gift from Maddie, a pocket notebook with a leather cover and her photo inside. Harry likes the gift. He then shows Wish the French book. Elisabeth figures Waits may be building his own catacomb. Also, she suggests the LAPD profilers come up with a script for Harry to follow next time Waits calls him.

Waits goes to the drug store wearing a hoodie, sunglasses, and cowboy hat. Standing in line, he sees a TV monitor show the bulletin and his photo; he decides to leave the pharmacy without the meds.

Edgar watches the video from the Waits factory visit; when Raynard mentions being put in a trunk, Harry in the next cubicle perks up. Harry then drives with Jerry to an orphan boys home, McLaren Youth Hall. The ""trunk"" is a punishment room. They request the files of every boy who came through from 1970 to 1990; there are 8000 files.

Waits returns home and observes his mother sleeping fitfully with an oxygen mask. He is deep in thought while cleaning up soiled tissues.

While others are loading a van with file boxes, Harry walks around the facility; this was where he lived as a youth. He has brief flashbacks and sees a solitary confinement room. The Headmaster claims they don't use it anymore, but Bosch had noticed a mattress and his anger flares. By the curb, Harry acknowledges a sad boy sitting at a window. He grabs a file from the 1978 box and puts it in his trunk; it is his own.

Waits' mother wakes up, Raynard is sitting beside her. He appears sad and says he hopes he wasn't a disappointment; she replies he wasn't and she has always appreciated when he came to them as a foster child. Raynard is gentle but then smothers her to death with a pillow."

He arranges her dead body in bed into a sleeping position, lights a candle, then has a coffee. He is deep in thought.

Harry reviews his old file while listening to jazz. In the morning he goes to Norm's for breakfast with Eleanor Wish. She is going back to Las Vegas, Maddie was in a minor car accident the previous night but is alright. Harry is upset, the two argue, Eleanor storms off.

Waits calls Harry again and tells the cop his mother died yesterday.

Irvine Irving has breakfast with his wife, they discuss his plans to see an activist clergyman and the political manoeuvring with Rick O'Shea.

Detectives Johnson and Ryder are going through the McLaren files. Harry tells them to look for the code A102, these are the boys sent into the solitary cell. Brasher comes in to work and reports to Capt Pound. He tells her outright her story on Stokes is bogus but urges her to file a sexual harassment complaint on Bosch, then the 3rd Unsat will be forgotten. Brasher is hesitant as the relationship with Bosch was consensual.

Irving meets a Minister in his church, he asks the Reverend to support O'Shea for Mayor. In return the black man asks for an easing up in racial profiling and to avoid 'Ferguson' type policing.

CSI Jessop shows Bosch and Edgar his new findings. He checked a skateboard found in Nicholas Trent's house, under the wheel assembly there are written initials AD 1993, a year before Arthur Delacroix disappeared. Then the CSI talks to Bosch in private. He admits an error in revealing the contents of Arthur's backpack to a telephone caller claiming to be an Assistant DA. This was how Raynard Waits knew about the starfish. In the parking lot, Jerry says they had the right guy all along, Nicholas Trent, Harry reluctantly agrees and says write it up.

Waits closes up a cell phone backplate, then goes cruising in his van. He pulls up by a dumpster in an alley, but it is locked.

At a gym Julia works out with George Irving and discuss her options. He urges her to file against Bosch, but she seems to realize she will be stigmatized either way.

The next day Bosch sees Brasher at work in uniform. He is surprised and says she should take a leave and be truthful about the garage incident. The two argue in front of other cops.

O'Shea and Irving walk together in park beside City Hall. The DA says the Reverend will support him for Mayor if he gets a seat on the Police Commission. Irving is upset with this development and O'Shea points out the Deputy Chief started this ball rolling.

Bosch goes back to Nicolas Trent's house and sees Dr. Guyot walking his dog. Harry asks him about kids in the neighbourhood, there are few now but 20 years ago there were many. The Blalocks who lived up the street may know names but they moved to Tonopah. Harry checks out the old Blalocks house and notices it is the house in the old photo of the kid skateboarders. Jerry then calls to say he had called the Blalocks earlier but the Mrs. had denied having foster kids. Guyot gives Harry an envelope, he still exchanges Christmas cards with the Blalocks.

Harry makes the 6 hour drive to Tonopah at night, and parks in front of the Blalock house at 4 am. At daybreak he goes to the front door and is greeted by a friendly Mr. Blalock. Blalock is a retired Fire Dept Captain from the Hollywood area, he makes Harry coffee. Audrey Blalock is suspicious but they admit they cared for 38 foster kids. Harry shows the old photo and they pick out Johnny Stokes, one of their wards. They also recognize a photo of Arthur Delacroix's skateboard, recalling Johnny had won it in a contest. They later sold it to Nicolas Trent. In the car Harry calls Jerry, now realizing that Stokes probably killed Arthur over the skateboard.

Back in LA Harry gets a call, the police have detected Waits' cell phone signal, Harry rushes to the location. There, Edgar updates Bosch, a hooker has been found dead in an alley dumpster. Bosch has a look at the scene and recoils. He says it is a staging of his own mother's death. Waits must have done it as a message, knowing how to set it up from the online newspaper links about Bosch during the Flores trial. Then Waits calls Bosch and says his mother was a saint while Harry's was a whore, then hangs up and tosses the phone.

Harry goes to Police Archives and gets his mother's case file. Marjorie Phillips Lowe murdered in 1979. He reads the file at home and recalls the last time he saw her. He drinks whisky and reflects."

Inside , Ryder and Johnson give an update on the Monica Reynolds murder. Capt Pounds comes by with sarcastic comments aimed at Bosch. In the patrol shift briefing, Jerry Edgar gives out photos of Johnny Stokes, some of the cops make negative comments about Bosch.

Bosch reads a file at his cubicle, Julia Brasher comes around passing out folders, she has been assigned to clerical duties. Bosch is terse and tells her to leave it on the desk. He goes to see Lt Billets, she snaps it's his own fault for sleeping with Brasher.

After work Bosch meets Billets at a bar, he has a beer while she drinks rye. Grace apologizes for the morning. She asks why Capt Pounds is after him, he alludes to an incident years earlier. Grace then mentions she is in a relationship with a colleague.

Waits calls Bosch and hints he is getting tired and it is time to go away. Harry then reveals he knows Raynard is a phony name, about McLarens, the starfish, the dungeon. Waits hangs up.

The next day the cops see more video stills of Waits van. Johnson and Ryder are still going through the McLaren files.

Waits approaches a young mother with a baby in stroller. He makes friendly small talk.

Maddie sets Bosch up on Skype and they start a video call. Maddie is frustrated with her mother's over protection. They talk about the accident. Maddie is anxious to come to LA.

A jogger hears a baby crying, he finds the tot alone in a stroller, and a Happy New Year note signed by Waits.

The cops have a New Years' Eve house party at Billets'. George Irving tells Pierce he is going Command and off the streets, he seems happy.

Waits brings the bound and gagged mother into his garage.

Jerry introduces his girlfriend to his co-workers. Billets goes to the toilet with drinks, Ryder is there and the two women kiss.

Waits drags the woman to the centre of his tunnel. He acts pleasant and apologetic and gives her water.

Bosch talks shop at the party. Suddenly everyone's phones start ringing. They switch on the TV to see the breaking news bulletin on the kidnapping. Bosch takes off to the Station and calls Eleanor Wish for her opinion.

Eleanor says the woman is bait for Harry and this is the end-game.

Irving and his aide watch the Chief announce a full police search, no time off for any cops until the woman is found.

Raynard apologizes for the wet tunnel and rats. He phones the reporter Tyler at the LA Times. Waits wants him to write his story. Tyler lets him talk and records the monologue. Later, Tyler arranges a meet with Bosch, Harry takes the phone to transcribe the conversation, he says he will return it in one hour. Tyler feels bad about the Trent suicide and the Hooker murder.

Harry reads out the turgid monologue to the other cops. The speech has a reference to a statue in Echo Park. And all the incident locations on the map make a circle around Echo Park. They start looking in the 22 remaining orphan files and Harry finds one quickly, a David Harris at McLarens from 79-88 with a French Teacher foster mother Irene Saxon.

Edgar and Bosch drive to the address. Jerry does more research on the car computer, more details fit Waits. At the house they climb the stairs to the home, Bosch detects a dead body smell and breaks a window to enter. They find the dead Mrs. Saxon in her bedroom. They go back downstairs and go into the garage and finds the van and workshop. Jerry has to go out to the car to call for backup.

Harry notices a garden hose dripping water, he pulls aside a flag and enters a dark tunnel. With gun at the ready he creeps down the passageway. Then, he confronts Harris/Waits holding the woman and a gun. After some back and forth, Harris pushes the woman aside, Bosch with a clear shot puts two into David's chest, killing him.

Everyone mobilizes, even the Chief shows up to view the scene. They congratulate Harry, even Brasher smiles slightly. The SID cops want a quick interview later. Harry calls Eleanor to let her know. Irving tells Bosch that Harris' gun was empty, it was Suicide by Cop."

Harry makes an analogy of two inner dogs, good and bad fighting inside a person. He shows little remorse and feels he just did his job.

Arthur Delacroix is laid to rest, his father Sam, mother Christine Waters and sister Sheila attend but don't talk to each other. Bosch waits by the cars, once more he asks if Sheila is ready to file charges, she tells him to leave her alone. Christine comes up next and is friendly to Bosch but saddened. Harry gives her the box of information on the orphans Nicolas Trent was supporting with cash, she will continue. Sam Delacroix staggers by, when Bosch goes to kneel by the coffin he returns, angry, and asks for justice for his boy.

Sgt Washington tells Deputy Chief Irving he heard from a friend that the DA has convened a Grand Jury to look into the Waits case.

Billets asks to speak with Bosch to update on Stokes and urges him to close the case.

In the evening Rick O'Shea tells Irving the Grand Jury is there to keep Irving true to his word since the DA can control it and what is investigated, this is to neutralize the video taken when Raynard Waits had escaped.

Bosch revisits Dr. Guyot and he updates the retiree on the Delacroix case. Back at his own house he spreads out files and listens to jazz. In the morning his living room is still covered in paper. He notices a name and calls Jerry Edgar to check out a Property Manager named Joe Olivas. Eleanor Wish calls to say Maddie has run away and is headed to LA on a bus, he heads to the bus station.

At 7:30am the bus arrives, Maddie is there. Harry is upset as she is only 15, but decides to spend some time together, they go to Du-Pars for pancakes.

Edgar talks to Olivas and with some pressure, gets Stokes' address.

Eleanor will be coming on a evening flight. Maddie says her mother is even more restrictive than before, Harry says Eleanor loves her as a mother. They go to his house, Maddie is impressed by the fantastic view. He explains movie money, for The Black Echo, bought the place. Harry goes to shave and cleanup, Maddie snoops around the files. She finds his childhood McLarens file while Art Pepper sounds fill the house.

At an old apartment building Edgar spots Stokes and opens his phone.

Harry takes Maddie to the La Brea Tarpits and introduces her to Dr. Golliher the Medical Examiner, and his archaeo dig. She is interested, when Jerry calls, Harry leaves Maddie there and says he has to go for awhile.

At the apartment several patrol cars are outside. George Irving has led a team inside. Bosch and Edgar enter cautiously and make their way to the third floor. They hear sounds of a struggle and a gunshot. Going forward they see Stokes on the floor, Irving had shot him with a beanbag round. Bosch says nice work and takes Stokes away. In the interrogation room Bosch goes over what he knows. Stokes makes a story about it being an accident, but Harry flatly states Stokes killed Arthur for the skateboard.

Then Harry retrieves Maddie, she is a little upset but he takes her to the beach. Maddie admits she read his file and asks some questions, she is sorry for what happened, Harry is moved. At the airport Eleanor has just arrived but they have to return right away. Harry hugs Maddie farewell and Eleanor thanks him and leaves.

The next day he drives back in to work. As he enters the building Irving's EA calls and summons him to HQ in 30 minutes. Julia Brasher is just leaving the office. Irving explains about the Grand Jury, Bosch is puzzled, Irving says it is pure politics. Irving has also heard Stokes has been arrested and is pleased. He has also re-instated Brasher but is sending her to Pacific Division, and she will not charge Harry with sexual harassment. Bosch is surprised this was even being considered. Outside HQ, Julia tries to talk to Harry and settle things. She doesn't want to quit her job but Harry won't forgive her for lying and says good-bye.

Harry and Jerry see a DA. Stokes will have to be released because he was a juvenile when the crime was committed. As Stokes is being led out of the Station, Capt Pounds angrily taunts Bosch and the two men begin to fight, Harry pushes the superior through a glass wall. Suspended pending an investigation, Harry turns in his gun, ID and badge to Lt Billets. He empties his desk of his personal effects. Jerry is sad, Johnson asks for his car. Harry says he is going to see his daughter. The next morning at home he starts to pack a bag.

Jerry calls and Harry drives downtown. At a crime scene, Johnny Stokes is dead, Sam Delacroix is under arrest. Lt. Billets tells Bosch to go away and he walks off. He grabs his bag and leaves his house."

Matt saved an old man from being hit by the truck by pushing him out of the way, but in the process his eyes were splashed with chemicals that blind him, and Jack is left to comfort his now-disabled son.

In 2014, Matt Murdock (now played by Charlie Cox) visits the Hell's Kitchen church his father attended and takes confession. He tells the priest, Father Lantom (Peter McRobbie), about his father's record as a ""tough as oak"" boxer, and how sometimes Jack would ""let the devil out"" on his opponents. Matt didn't understand what that meant at the time, but he does now. When Lantom asks what Matt has done that he wants to confess, Matt admits that he doesn't want forgiveness for what he's done, but rather what he's going to do.

That night, at the docks, a gang of human traffickers, lead by Turk Barrett (Rob Morgan), are loading captive young women into a shipping container. Matt, wearing a black suit and mask that hides his identity, carries out a surprise attack on the traffickers, using his heightened senses and advanced martial arts to dispatch each one of them with ease, and frees their captives.

The next morning, Matt is aroused from his sleep by a wakeup call from Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), his best friend, fellow lawyer and new business partner. Foggy is calling to remind him that they're scheduled to meet with a realtor to scout out potential office space for their new firm, Nelson & Murdock. After Foggy hangs up, he goes to a subway entrance, where he meets with Sgt. Brett Mahoney (Royce Johnson) of the New York City Police Department's 15th Precinct. After a bit of casual banter about how they're technically enemies (despite having been friends since they were kids), Foggy bribes Brett with a bag of cigars for his mother in exchange for information on any hot cases.

Matt and Foggy meet up at the office space, and their realtor, Susan Harris, guides them around. The space is relatively modest - a reception area, a conference room, and two offices, and a view of the Hudson from the corner suite. It's on the market right now because it's one of the few buildings in this part of Hell's Kitchen that wasn't touched by ""the Incident"" (apparently, that name is a lot better than ""death and destruction raining from the sky nearly wiping Hell's Kitchen off the map""). Matt decides to settle on the space, and Foggy reluctantly agrees, despite his reservations about the location. Now they only need clients, but that's been difficult due to Matt's insistence they only defend the innocent; at this point, they'd settle for a single client.

That first client comes in the form of Karen Page, a woman found in her apartment by police, standing over a dead body and holding a bloody knife, and arrested despite her tearful pleas of innocence. That night, Brett calls Matt and Foggy to tip them off. Matt and Foggy go to the precinct, where they are escorted to an interrogation room by the investigating detectives Christian Blake (Chris Tardio) and Carl Hoffman (Daryl Edwards). They are able to convince Karen to hire the firm and be their first client. In tears, Karen explains that she and the victim, Daniel Fisher, worked for a construction firm called Union Allied, and after meeting up for drinks the night before, she blacked out and woke up in her apartment a moment before the police arrived. Matt's super-senses let him know she's telling the truth.

The next day, a middle-aged corrections guard named Clyde Farnum is eating lunch in Abe Lebewohl Park when another man in a suit and tie walks up and sits down next to him. This is James Wesley (Toby Leonard Moore), the right-hand to a mysterious mob boss. Wesley explains that his organization has acquired the $30,000 debt that Farnum owes to Rigoletto, a mobster who has recently ""retired"". He then shows Farnum a live tablet image of his daughter Tracy in a park, with an assassin stationed not ten yards away from her, who they are going to give a kill order to if Farnum doesn't use his position to do a job.

Meanwhile, at the Nelson & Murdock office, Matt is beginning to think something's amiss: if the case against Karen is so open-and-shut, why haven't the police formally charged her or publicized the arrest? Foggy suspects Matt's reluctance is because Karen is just his type (a beautiful woman of ""questionable character""), but he agrees to dig deeper into the matter.

In the middle of the night, Farnum attacks Karen in her cell and tries to strangle her using a bedsheet tied into a noose. Karen fights back, clawing at Farnum's face until she draws blood from one of his eyes. With Farnum overpowered, she screams for help. The next morning, Matt and Foggy sit down with Detectives Blake and Hoffman to demand Karen's immediate release. They know full well that something's going up, as the cameras in Karen's detention area were disabled right before the assault, and the detectives have failed to charge her within the legal time limit. Matt suspects the attempted murder was part of an attempt to cover up evidence that would exonerate Karen. Blake and Hoffman take offense at the lawyers' attitude, but reluctantly agree.

Matt and Foggy take Karen back to their office. They remind her that just because she's been released doesn't mean she's off the hook yet. While she drinks some tea to calm her nerves, Karen admits to knowing why someone would want her dead, although she doesn't know who. She explains that Union Allied has profited from securing the majority of the federal government's contracts to rebuild much of Hell's Kitchen. Karen worked as a secretary in charge of overseeing the pension funds. One day, she had accidentally been copied into the email of a ""pension file"", which was actually a ledger for what Karen suspected was criminal activity. Her boss laughed off her concerns, so Karen asked Daniel Fisher from the legal department, to advise her on what to do next. When they met up to discuss it, someone drugged their drinks, moved the two back to Karen's apartment, then stabbed Fisher to death and planted the bloody knife in Karen's hand. Karen blames herself for Fisher's death, and tearfully insists on leaving, not wanting Matt or Foggy to suffer because of her, but the pair resolve to keep her safe, and Matt offers to let her stay at his apartment.

Matt takes Karen back to his apartment. It's large, but it's also sparse and very cheap, in part due to a bright and gaudy electronic billboard on the building across the street (Matt has to dissuade Karen from taking the couch as a result). Over coffee, they talk about his blindness, and Matt admits that he misses his sight. Their talk turns to the Union Allied business, and Matt proposes his theory: the reason Karen wasn't killed right away, but just framed, was because she has something the conspirators want. Stabbing a fellow coworker to death in her apartment was just to scare her and discredit her. However, something went wrong - either something going wrong while staging the crime scene, or two lawyers showing up before the conspirators' representatives could get to Karen - and that's when they resorted to attempting to kill her. Matt thinks that the conspirators believe Karen kept a copy of the pension file. Karen denies it, but Matt senses the lie.

A disparate group of organized criminals meet on the roof of a partially-constructed building: elderly financial expert Leland Owlsley (Bob Gunton), Russian mobsters Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov (Gideon Emery and Nikolai Nikoleff), Yakuza enforcer Nobu Yoshioka (Peter Shinkoda), and elderly Chinese drug manufacturer Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho). Wesley is the last to arrive as a representative of his employer, though he refuses to allow his boss's name to be spoken aloud. When Wesley asks why the Russians are short on their payments, they explain that a shipment was stopped by a masked vigilante in black. Owlsley is dismissive, more concerned with the Union Allied situation, but Wesley assures them the matter is well in hand and is more interested in the lone vigilante.

In the middle of the night, Karen sneaks out to her apartment to retrieve a flash drive containing a copy of the pension file. Rance is waiting and attempts to kill Karen after taking the drive, but Matt has followed her in his vigilante outfit, and fights Rance. Bolstered by memories of his father, Matt defeats the assassin and retrieves the flash drive with Karen looking on, though she doesn't recognize him. He promises to get the drive into the right hands, bypassing the cops, and telling ""everyone"" by delivering the assassin and the flash drive to the offices of the New York Bulletin.

A few days later, the Union Allied story is front page news in the Bulletin. While reading the story in the paper, Wesley talks on the phone with his employer, Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio), and assures him that the scandal won't be linked to their operation, since Owlsley has cleared out the dirty money and the key people with evidence, such as Clyde, Rance, and Karen's boss, have been or will be dealt with. Farnum is shot in his basement and his death staged as a suicide, Rance is hanged in his jail cell with a bedsheet, and Karen's boss is force fed a lethal dosage of pills. Fisk is curious about how Rance was subdued, but tells Wesley to leave Karen alone, since she doesn't know anything beyond what has already been exposed, and to keep an eye on Nelson & Murdock in case they'll be useful in the future.

Karen cooks Matt and Foggy a celebratory meal to celebrate her acquittal, and offers to repay them by becoming their new secretary. Despite the firm's victory, the criminal enterprise is continuing unabated. That night, Matt waits on the rooftops of Hell's Kitchen in his vigilante suit and listens for trouble; hearing the sound of a child being abducted from his father by the Russians, Matt pulls on his mask and goes to work."

In the dumpster outside an apartment building, a young man named Santino finds Matt beaten to within an inch of his life. He fetches Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), a nurse who lives in the building, and together they carry Matt up to Claire's apartment so she can tend to his wounds. Matt comes to long enough to stop Claire from calling an ambulance, claiming his attackers will kill innocent people in order to get to him.

A young pre-accident Matt watches his father fight on TV, and despite being the favorite, Battlin' Jack is TKO'd by his opponent. Matt waits up for his father and helps patch up his wounds, even having his first drink of whiskey to keep his hands steady while he works. Jack produces an envelope full of cash to cover the rent, but when Matt asks where it came from, he simply says ""sometimes, even when you get knocked down you can still win.""

At Nelson & Murdock, Foggy and Karen are working late to get the office organized, with Karen trying and failing to hide her amusement at Foggy's terrible singing. Foggy wonders why Karen is staying at the office rather than having a life, and when she reluctantly admits that she doesn't want to return to her apartment, Foggy suggests they go out drinking instead, and they call Matt to see if he wants to join them.

Matt wakes up in the hospital after his accident, and promptly freaks over about the fact that he is both blind and all of his other senses are going into overload, but Jack is there to help him. Simultaneously, in the present day, Matt wakes, he avoids questions about who he is and how he ended up in the dumpster. Claire christens him ""Mike"" and explains that she's patched a stab wound, but there are still broken ribs and a concussion that need tending to. Minutes later, one of the broken ribs collapses a lung, but Claire is able to help him. When pressed for answers, Matt explains that while tracking the boy that the Russians kidnapped, he walked into a trap and barely escaped with his life. As they talk, Matt's senses tip him off to a Russian searching the building.

Matt is learning braille at Fogwell's Gym while Jack trains. They converse about his ability to learn the alphabet so easily. The bonding is interrupted when two gangsters, Silke (Peter Gerety) and Roscoe Sweeney (Kevin Nagle), show up. They tell Jack that he'll get a chance to fight Carl ""the Crusher"" Creel. But there's a catch: Jack must have his ass go down in the fifth round. Jack initially turns the fight down, but Roscoe reminds him that he's got a blind son to take care of, an obvious death threat, and eventually Jack agrees to throw the fight.

The Russian comes to Claire's door claiming to be ""Detective Foster"" of the 55th Precinct. He sees through her lies and leaves to inform his superiors, but Matt knocks him out with a fire extinguisher.

Foggy and Karen wind up at Josie's, a Hell's Kitchen bar where the customers look a lot meaner than they really are. After some good-natured banter, Karen admits that between Daniel Fisher's bloodstains and memories of almost being murdered, she can't return to her apartment, and fears for her life wherever she is. Foggy resolves to stay up all night with her. As they walk home, they're within a few blocks of Claire's building, where Matt has tied up the Russian, Semyon, and prepares to interrogate him, though Claire is still skeptical about the whole situation. When asked why she helped Matt, Claire admits that during her shifts in the ER, she's heard stories about a vigilante in a black mask who's been running around Hell's Kitchen saving people from gangs and violence, and while she wants to believe Matt is a force for good, his treatment of ""Foster"" suggests otherwise.

Matt's braille reading is coming along, and Jack has new gear for his fight against Creel, including a red robe inscribed with ""Battlin' Jack Murdock."" Matt's comments about how Murdocks ""always get back up"" inspire Jack to contact his bookie. He asks the bookie to change the bet he made on the fight to a knockout win instead of a loss, and he orders that as soon as the fight's over, all the winnings should be placed in a trust for Matt. After, Jack calls his wife and leaves her a voicemail message, asking her to take care of Matt if something happens to him.

In the present, Foggy and Karen's drunken night continues, including a stop at Matt's apartment to try and drag him along, and Karen wholeheartedly thanks Foggy for his efforts.

On Claire's rooftop, Semyon wakes and is interrogated. Claire's disapproval evaporates when he admits the Russians only kidnapped the boy to lure out the masked vigilante. When Matt dangles him off the edge of the roof supposedly because he ""enjoys it"" Semyon cracks and gives the boy's location, but Matt drops him off the rooftop anyway ... right into the dumpster. Claire freaks about this, but after a quick listen, Matt ensures her that Semyon is still alive, albeit heavily injured. After encouraging Claire to leave her apartment for a while in case the Russians come for her, and finding out how to get in touch in case he needs medical help in the future, Matt sets off.

Jack gives his all in the fight against Creel and, with Matt listening on the TV at their apartment, wins by knockout. Afterwards, Jack hurriedly tries to escape the boxing arena, pausing only to listen as the crowd cheers his name, but later Matt hears a gunshot with his super-senses and races to a nearby alley, cordoned off by the cops, in which lies Jack's body, shot in the head.

Matt finds the Russian hideout and, despite his injuries, defeats all ten of the Russian gangsters present in a protracted fight. Barely able to stand, he takes off his mask before freeing the boy and carrying him out."

An innocuous man named John Healy walks up to the desk and asks the girl on duty for a pair of bowling shoes. She shrugs him off, informing him that the alley is closed. Prohaska's playing because he's worked out a special arrangement with the owner. Healy approaches Prohaska about joining his game, but what no one knows is that Healy has been sent here on Wilson Fisk's orders to assassinate Prohaska. He suddenly takes out both of Prohaska's bodyguards, knocking them out, then draws a gun and aims it at Prohaska's head.

As Healy prepares to fire, the scene suddenly cuts back to 36 hours earlier. Healy is meeting with Turk Barrett, his arms dealer, who sells him the pistol, freshly smuggled into town and which has never been fired. Healy says he'd like a revolver as they don't jam up, but Turk insists that his pistols don't jam. Despite his promise, Healy's gun DOES jam as he prepares to shoot Prohaska. Prohaska gets the drop on Healy, forcing him to take on his target hands-on. After a bout of fisticuffs, Healy manages to break Prohaska's arms, then finishes him off by crushing his head with a bowling ball.

Healy catches his breath, just in time to hear that the on-duty attendant has called 911 to summon the police. She hastily flees when he looks up at her. Healy calmly stashes the useless gun in a pinball machine, then gets on his knees and puts his hands on the back of his head as police officers enter the alley and point their guns at him. He only responds to their commands saying he wants a lawyer.

The next morning. on a bench outside the church, Matt Murdock is recognized by Father Lantom, who has deduced that Matt is Jack Murdock's son. Lantom invites Matt to take confession, or even a latte, but Matt declines the chance to talk.

Meanwhile, at the docks, New York Bulletin reporter Ben Urich (Vondie Curtis-Hall) meets with Silvio, an Italian mobster and long-time source. Silvio is planning on retiring to Florida to avoid being killed like so many other New York gangsters. Ben has heard talk of someone hitting the Russians, and that there's a new player on the criminal scene, but Silvio warns Ben that pursuing the story is dangerous.

Karen is in early at Nelson & Murdock, and finds that she's received a summons in the mail from Union Allied's lawyers. Foggy shows up first, clearly hung over from their night of drinking. They briefly banter about Karen's salary, and whether or not to get a permanent sign on the front door (to replace the temporary piece of paper they're currently using) before Matt comes in, sporting a visible bruise over his eye from his fight with the Russians, which he claims is from tripping and hitting something. Foggy and Karen suggest he get a seeing-eye dog. This is interrupted by a knock at the door from what they take to be a prospective client. After exchanging glances, Karen goes to answer the door, and their client is revealed to be James Wesley.

Matt, Foggy and Karen sit down with Wesley in the conference room. Wesley refuses to give his name or talk about Confederated Global, the multinational corporation he works for, but he seems to know a lot about Matt, Foggy, and Karen's histories. Wesley says he wants to put the firm on a generous retainer in exchange for their services and discretion, but first they must take on a case: defending Healy. Foggy is eager to accept Wesley's money, but Matt is suspicious (especially after Wesley recognizes Karen), and decides to follow Wesley. He's only able to make it partway down the block before Wesley gets into the middle vehicle in a convoy of three Cadillac Escalades, and disappears. He briefly clutches his chest, feeling the cut he sustained from the night before opening up again from stress, then walks off.

Foggy goes to the precinct and meets Healy, who claims self-defense and is clearly lying through his teeth about the circumstances of the attack. Just as Foggy is ready to drop the case, Matt arrives and agrees to represent Healy, believing it's the best way to learn more about Wesley. However, Healy deflects all questions about Wesley or why Confederated Global is paying his legal bills, and insists on going to trial rather than taking a plea.

Meanwhile, Ben Urich is in his office, finishing up a call with the hospital trying to deal with the insurance for his wife Doris, who is afflicted with Alzheimer's. His editor Mitchell Ellison (Geoffrey Cantor) walks in and asks to talk about the next edition. Urich is intent on continuing the organized crime story, briefly arguing with Ellison over its newsworthiness, with Urich interested in writing about something the cops show no interest in, while Ellison doesn't see it as propping up their ailing circulation numbers. Urich eventually concedes and agrees to write a piece about whether or not Hell's Kitchen will get a subway line, despite the fact that they run it every year and both of them know it's bad even by fluff piece standards.

Wesley goes to the bowling alley and retrieves Healy's gun from the machine.

At Nelson & Murdock, the pair settles their disagreement over the case and come up with a strategy for the defense. Matt suggests that Karen investigate Confederated Global, but Karen has left the office to answer the summons from Union Allied's lawyers. Union Allied which is in the process of being dissolved argues that Karen breached her non-disclosure agreements by releasing the pension file to the media and could be sued. Instead, they agree to pay her a severance of six months' salary in exchange for her silence, as long as she signs a contract to that effect.

Ben's wife Doris is in the hospital, and though the Bulletin's health insurance doesn't cover her continued treatment, he manages to buy a few more days of care to file appeals. Later, he visits her at the hospital, though she's not awake.

At Nelson & Murdock, Foggy gripes about their poor office equipment as the team puts together Healy's defense. Karen is only able to find Confederated Global is a subsidiary of a string of shell companies. When Matt reminds her to not take any long lunch breaks, she doesn't mention the Union Allied payoff.

Some time later, Healy's case goes to trial. While Foggy gives the opening statement, Matt observes that one of the jurors becomes agitated when Wesley enters the courtroom. Suspicious, Matt follows the juror that night in his vigilante outfit and learns that she's being blackmailed by one of Wesley's henchmen over a sex tape she did in her teens. Matt beats up the thug to learn more and demands a name, but the thug tells him that he has never been given one: All he knows is to watch out for a window in a certain building, and if the light is on he has a job. Matt then the settles for telling the thug to leave the juror alone and skip town. By the trial's end, the juror is excused from duty before Matt gives his final summation.

Leland Owlsley is becoming desperate to meet with Fisk, believing the Healy situation is spinning out of control and he should simply be killed, but Wesley says they can't afford to leave any more bodies in light of everyone they killed to silence the Union Allied matter, so using a couple of clean lawyers is the most effective way of clearing things up.

Karen meets with Jennifer Fisher, the widow of Daniel Fisher, who is moving out of New York with her children. Jennifer feels guilty for pushing her husband to do the right thing, and though Karen begs for help in exposing the conspiracy around Union Allied, Jennifer has already signed the payoff contract. Not knowing where else to go for help, Karen visits Ben Urich at his office, claiming to have more on the Union Allied story.

In court, the jury returns from deliberation, but Matt's super senses alert him in advance that the jury is hung, and though multiple hung juries would normally result in a retrial, Matt is confident that Wesley and his people will make sure the case goes away. Sure enough, Healy goes free a few nights later, but Matt confronts him in his vigilante outfit, beats him into submission and tortures him until Healy gives up the name of Wesley's employer: Wilson Fisk. But then the professional killer starts shaking in fear, as he tells Matt that Fisk kills individuals who give up his name, as well as everyone they ever cared about. Despairingly, Healy calls Matt a coward, and tells him he should just have killed him instead of making him talk, and then, without hesitating, he commits suicide by impaling his head on a spike, much to Matt's shock.

We cut to an art gallery, where Wilson Fisk is transfixed by a painting that seems to be nothing but gradations of white. The art gallery's owner, Vanessa Marianna (Aylet Zurer), approaches Fisk and asks him how the painting makes him feel. Fisk answers that it makes him feel alone."

The pair doubt odds at their survival, no better than the corpse they share the cell with, but those doubts are short-lived; Vladimir has used his time in the cell to tear a rib out of the corpse to use as a weapon in a bid for freedom. Anatoly asks if their fate will see them return to Moscow, but Vladimir talks him out of it, saying that the future lies in America.

In 2014, Vladimir rushes out of a building, claiming that someone has infiltrated it and demanding to know where Anatoly is; he can barely enter a taxi before a lifeless body is hurled out a window crashes onto the hood of the car, tumbling onto the pavement as Vladimir makes his escape. With the car peeling out into the streets, the intruder, Matt Murdock, clad in his vigilante outfit and standing in front of the broken window, listens to the taxi getting away from him.

As Claire, currently hiding out in a co-worker's apartment, later patches up Matt's wounds, they trade dialogue about Matt's actions and the role it plays in both lives; Matt insists Claire stay hidden until the Russians aren't out for her while rebuking her requests of getting body armor, claiming it to be a hindrance to his movement. The conversation continues as the pair exchange phone numbers and Matt sheds a bit more light about the organized crime ring, searching for someone who may be able to give him a lead on Wilson Fisk before carrying it out.

Wesley pays a visit to the garage of Veles Taxi, where taxis much like Anatoly's getaway vehicle are being repurposed with new logos. Wesley informs Vladimir and Anatoly that, although Fisk is willing to give the brothers' cover organization of a taxi service the assets taken from Prohazska after his death, he's also unhappy about the Ranskahovs continuing to fall short on their payments due to the masked vigilante; even Nobu and Madame Gao's patience with the Ranskahovs is starting to grow thin. Though Vladimir is quick to turn down Fisk's offer of assistance, Wesley leaves it on the table for he and Anatoly to discuss; the brothers instead choose to reach out to contacts of their own for help.

Meanwhile, at the Square Diner in Tribeca, Karen sits down with Ben Urich to talk about the Union Allied case. While initially skeptical at the facts Karen provides him with, Ben takes her word, but addresses another angle of the question: with the exception of Karen, everyone involved in the case has been killed, like someone is covering their tracks. He advises Karen to stop trying to look deeper into the case, lest she want to be next. When Karen calls him out on what she considers his lack of courage, citing his past exposures of everyone from corrupt companies to teacher's unions, she asks what happened to the Ben Urich she looked up to. He responds that he's become older since then, older and less stupid, leaving the diner without giving her a chance to respond.

Anatoly and Vladimir go to the hospital under the guise of visitors to find one of their contacts in critical condition; Semyon, the Russian that Matt threw off the roof of Claire's apartment. As they prepare to wake Semyon from his coma, the brothers reflect on their past in Utkin. Anatoly in particular remembers promising never to lose what they once had in Moscow, but states that he and Vladimir had lost sight of that goal and lost touch with each other. Vladimir replies by assuring Anatoly that they'll reclaim that prestige together, waking Semyon afterward by injecting a spike of adrenaline into his heart. After removing Semyon's breathing tube, he tells the Ranskahovs of Claire, and in turn, they call in another one of their contacts, a henchman named Sergei. Sergei goes Claire's apartment, accompanied by another henchman. Though they find nothing, Santino soon appears in front of the doorway, attracting the mobsters' attention.

Wesley is filling Wilson Fisk in on the situation with the Ranskahovs. Wesley addresses that Anatoly is more willing to cooperate with the rest of the crime ring than Vladimir. Fisk is certain the Russians will be handled, as will the masked man, before the car stops at its destination. Fisk requests Wesley stay in the car and, after thanking him for his help, leaves to enter the art gallery.

Fisk's glancing at the paintings is cut short when he meets Vanessa again; the pair trade some banter over the rabbit in a snowstorm painting before Fisk, though stumbling over his words, offers to take Vanessa to dinner. Though Vanessa turns him down, Fisk accepts her rejection, and upon seeing this, Vanessa comments about her surprise on how well Fisk is handling the subject. Fisk replies that he remains uninterested in a woman that can be bought; Vanessa decides to take him up on his offer, the pair delighting in their mutual fondness for Italian afterward.

Claire's night of tending to her co-worker's pet cat is disturbed by nearby noises; after checking, she spots a woman going past the hallway, and pays it no mind as she carries on with her night, unaware of a figure glancing at her from outside her curtained windows. Meanwhile, Foggy and Matt are leaving the precinct, Foggy regaling Matt with stories of how his mother wanted him to be a butcher and not a lawyer, when the ensuing conversation about their former law firm is cut short by Matt answering his phone to the sound of Claire screaming as she's kidnapped from her apartment. As Foggy hails a taxi to go back to the office, Matt races back to Claire's temporary abode, but finds it empty.

Karen goes to an auction house where Union Allied assets such as phones, computers and fax machines are being auctioned off. She sketches the outlines of some potentially suspicious bidders, like the individual who buys up a Union Allied lot. She runs in to Ben, who advises her to bid on some of the smaller lots to keep her cover intact.

Claire is loaded into a Veles taxi and taken by Sergei to the taxi company's garage. During this time, Matt has found a distraught Santino, but after calming him down, he learns that the Russians took Claire and left in a Veles taxi.

Fisk and Vanessa's date takes place at a new upscale restaurant. Fisk pours his heart out to Vanessa, how Hell's Kitchen is a part of him, his dreams of making it a better place; a scene contrasted by the Russians attempting to extract information on the masked man from Claire, but to her aid comes the vigilante himself. With Matt cutting the power, the Russians find themselves being taken down one at a time before Sergei takes Claire hostage in a move that ends poorly for him, as he finds himself at the mercy of Claire and the masked man afterward.

Ben and Karen regroup at the Square Diner, where Ben advises Karen that, if she still wishes to look into the Union Allied case, she should plan her actions with much more care from now on, starting with signing the Union Allied contract.

Meanwhile, the Ranskahovs return to the garage and, seeing their men laying on the ground, Anatoly decides to make good on Wesley's offer and ask Fisk for help; albeit begrudgingly, Vladimir lets him go. Fisk, in the midst of his date, has the chance to share his favorite dessert - zuppa inglese - with Vanessa. The dinner is interrupted by Anatoly who, despite Wesley's warnings, has stormed through Fisk's guards in an attempt to accept the offer.

As it turns out, Karen bid on and did win some office equipment at the auction. She charges it and has it delivered to Nelson & Murdock, inventing a cover story to explain to Foggy.

Matt now tends to Claire's injuries at his apartment, and, during the ensuing conversation, Matt begins to express his doubts that he's actually making a difference in the city. Claire assures him that despite how scared she is about the predicament, Matt can quell those fears and truly make New York City a better place, and in turn, Claire learns his real name.

In the aftermath of Anatoly disturbing the date, Vanessa seems to have her perception of Fisk shattered, unsure of if she can trust him, unsure of how she feels towards him. In the car, meanwhile, Wesley shares a talk with Anatoly, wherein he expresses he wanted to make amends with Fisk despite the Russians' past mistakes. When they come to a stop in a deserted lot by the eastern landing of the Queensboro Bridge, Wesley shares some parting words with Anatoly before he gets a phone call. He hangs up, and Anatoly asks if that was Fisk. Wesley confirms that it was, and he wants to have a word with Anatoly. A split second later, Fisk suddenly yanks open the door and pulls Anatoly from the car, the two getting involved in fisticuffs. Anatoly is repeatedly pummeled by Fisk, and even with a switchblade can Anatoly do no harm to his armor-clad superior, who promptly pins Anatoly to the car and stabs him with his own knife.

Now with the upper hand, Fisk viciously beats Anatoly into the pavement, Wesley quietly listening to the commotion. Desperately, Anatoly tries to crawl back into the car, but can only utter defiantly to Wesley before Fisk knocks him out, plants his head in the door frame and begins bashing it in with the door. Wesley barely flinches, as Fisk smashes Anatoly's skull in, his brain falling to the pavement, until he finally destroys Anatoly's skull, and the rest of the body goes limp. Seething with fury, Fisk catches his breath. Wesley notices the gash in Fisk's suit from Anatoly's knife, revealing the body armor underneath. As Fisk wipes Anatoly's blood off his face, he asks Wesley to contact his tailor and request a new suit and also send Anatoly's remains to Vladimir as a message. Wesley warns Fisk that Vladimir will likely go to war with him for this, but Fisk is counting on it."

Next to the bed, Barry removes the silencer from his gun and leaves. A montage shows Barry: on a plane; entering his apartment; in the shower; and, playing a video game. A plaque in the room shows he is a combat veteran.

Sleeping, Barry is awakened by Fuches, who congratulates Barry on finishing the hit job. Barry says he is burnt out. Fuches suggests he travel to Los Angeles for a new assignment.

Barry flies to Los Angeles and meets Chechen mob members. He is told by Goran and NoHo Hank, that Barry must kill Ryan Madison , a personal trainer with whom Goran's wife is cheating.

Next, Barry follows Ryan to a community center. After some time, Barry approaches the building and hears a woman yelling. After he approaches, she chastises him and runs into the building. Barry follows her into a theater where a man and the woman he just interrupted are on stage performing. The theater teacher, Gene M. Cousineau insults Sally, the female student, then encourages her to finish the scene, which she does with fervor.

Approaching him from behind, Ryan Madison asks Barry to be his scene partner. The two are next shown on-stage reciting lines. After Barry blankly reads his lines from a script, Cousineau tells Barry he must pay to attend class.

As Barry leaves the building, Sally invites him to join the students at a bar. At the bar, she and the acting students (Nick, Jermaine, Antonio, Sasha, Natalie, Lydia, and Ryan), brainstorm a monologue Barry can prepare for class. Ryan Madison suggests that Barry use a stage name and recommends Barry Block. Barry drives an inebriated Ryan home. Across the street, NoHo Hank and a Chechen associate watch from a car as Ryan hugs Barry.

The next morning, Fuches tells Barry what NoHo Hank saw. Barry explains that he wants to pursue acting. Fuches says that Barry must complete the job and forget acting.

Now nighttime, Barry approaches Cousineau outside the community center. Barry confesses he is a hitman and tells Cousineau that he is depressed. Cousineau assumes this monologue was from a written work and tells Barry he can be in the class. Barry tells him his last name is Block.

Later, Barry watches Ryan pull up outside Ryan's apartment. Barry opens Ryan's car door to shoot him, and sees he's already been shot in the head. He turns around to see a Chechen reloading a weapon from a car where NoHo Hank instructs him to shoot Barry. Barry shoots all the men. He throws away the gun and his car keys as he walks away. He walks into a nearby restaurant as police sirens fill the air."

He gets hit by a car and is transported to a hospital. Madison Clark, her daughter Alicia and her husband Travis visit Nick, her son, at the hospital.

At the school where Madison works, Madison confiscates a knife from a student who is worried about news reports of a virus spreading around the country.

Nick tells Travis about the gruesome scene at the church. Travis checks out Nick's story at the church and finds maggot-infested guts on the floor. When Nick escapes the hospital, Madison and Travis ask his high school friend, Calvin, for help finding Nick.

While driving home, Madison and Travis hear screams and gunshots on a highway off-ramp. The next day at school, teachers and students watch footage of the incident: A victim ravages an EMT worker then attacks police, resistant to gunfire. Amid reports of city-wide violence, school adjourns early.

Nick meets with Calvin, who is his dealer. Calvin tries to kill Nick for becoming a liability to his drug business, but Nick fights back and kills Calvin. Nick brings Madison and Travis to Calvin's body. They're attacked by undead Calvin and escape. They pick up Alicia at her boyfriend Matt's house and discover that Matt is sick from a bite mark.

Nick goes into heroin withdrawal. Unable to reach a doctor, Madison retrieves confiscated OxyContin from her high school. The principal, who has turned, attacks her. She bashes his head in.

Travis goes to his ex-wife Liza's house to look for their son, Chris. They find Chris at a mob protest against cops who shot an infected homeless man. As a riot breaks out, they take shelter in a barber shop owned by Daniel Salazar and his wife, Griselda, and daughter, Ofelia. As they flee the riots, a scaffolding topples onto Griselda, mangling her foot.

Madison, Nick and Alicia see an infected neighbor, Mr. Dawson, attack his wife then make his way toward their house. They run to the home of their neighbors, Susan and Patrick Tran, to get a shotgun. Travis and his group arrive home, where he's attacked by Mr. Dawson. Daniel shoots Mr. Dawson with the shotgun that Madison brings back. Meanwhile Alicia narrowly escapes an infected Mrs. Tran.

Madison asks Liza to kill her if she ever becomes infected. ""Don't make Travis do it,"" she says. ""It would break him."" She tries to kill Mrs. Tran but is stopped by Travis, who argues that Mrs. Tran might still be saved. Mr. Tran arrives home from a trip and is nearly killed by Mrs. Tran before newly arrived soldiers swarm into the yard and kill her.

The military secures the neighborhood with a perimeter fence and implements a strict curfew. The commanding officer, Officer Moyers, tells residents that they are in one of 12 safe zones south of the San Gabriel Mountains. Travis befriends Moyers, who informally makes Travis his community liaison. After a neighbor, Doug, goes missing, Travis learns that Moyers took Doug into custody for having an emotional breakdown.

Chris discovers a distress signal emitting from a house outside the Safe Zone and relays the information to Travis and Madison. At Madison's insistence, Travis tells Moyers about the distress signal. He later sees gunfire erupt at the house, putting an end to the signal. Meanwhile Madison sneaks outside the Safe Zone and finds that soldiers have been killing non-infected people.

Liza provides medical assistance to residents in the neighborhood. Dr. Exner, a government doctor, praises her nursing skills and asks for help treating residents in the community. Dr. Exner recommends Griselda undergo surgery at a nearby hospital. She also examines Nick after learning about his addiction from Liza.

Nick siphons morphine from a sick neighbor's morphine drip. Madison furiously beats him after she realizes he has been lying to her.

Ofelia flirts with a soldier, Corporal Adams, who unsuccessfully tries to procure medicine for Griselda.

Soldiers arrive to take Griselda to the local command post for surgery. They also take Nick against his will and detain him in a cell with a prisoner named Strand.

Liza accompanies Dr. Exner to the command post to help treat patients. Dr. Exner explains that they euthanize anyone with bite marks as a precaution. When Griselda dies from septic shock, Liza shoots her through the head to prevent reanimation.

Daniel and Ofelia capture Adams and interrogate him about Griselda and Nick's whereabouts. Daniel secretly tortures Adams into revealing that Griselda and Nick are at a command post two miles away and that the military is planning to evacuate the area at 9 a.m., at which point all detainees at the command post will be terminated. He also reveals that the military locked 2,000 civilians in a local arena after the people began turning.

Travis warns Moyers that the community will revolt if Nick, Liza and Griselda aren't returned soon. Moyers capitulates and takes Travis to the command center with a team of soldiers. They abort the mission and return to the Safe Zone after losing soldiers to an infected attack.

Madison and Travis inform Alicia and Chris that they're leaving immediately for the desert. Adams convinces Travis to let him go after telling Travis where to find his family at the command post.

Daniel leads the herd of infected from the arena straight into the command post. As mayhem breaks out, Travis and his group infiltrate the command post. An evacuation helicopter for Dr. Exner and her ward abandons the besieged post.

Nick and Strand escape their holding cell but become cornered by infected. Travis' group rescues Nick and Strand with help from Liza. As they make their getaway, Adams tries to kill Daniel but accidentally shoots Ofelia. Travis brutally beats Adams.

The group takes refuge at Strand's oceanside estate. Strand tells Nick he is planning to flee to a large boat moored in the ocean.

On the beach, Liza shows Madison a bite mark on her torso and asks Madison to shoot her. Travis discovers them and, after coming to terms with Liza's fate, shoots Liza himself."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2312764/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Sherlock Holmes, fresh out of rehab, is teamed with a sobriety partner, a former surgeon named Watson. They have to learn to work together even as they tackle their first case, the mysterious death of a doctor's wife.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Michael Cuesta'],"['', '']",[],"['one word title', 'pacifier behaviour', 'non haptic communication', 'serial killer', 'therapy']",[],"""Elementary"" - ""Pilot"" - Sept. 27, 2012

In slow motion, a glass drops and shatters, a red haired woman is pursued through a house, up a staircase, and into a bedroom. On the bed she struggles to reach for something behind the lamp.

Sherlock Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) is fresh out of rehab and all tatted up. He has been given an ultimatum by his wealthy father: stay sober and he can stay in the rundown--but still fabulous-- brownstone in NYC that his father owns. (It is one of many and not the best but still, a fabulous brownstone.)

His father has hired Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) as his sober companion. She is a whipsmart former surgeon, who, we learn through Holmes' deductions and Google skills, lost a patient and subsequently her medical license.

Holmes, quirky to say the least, wants no part of this sober companionship. When she first arrives he is watching a whole bunch of televisions in his house. He stops Watson dead in her tracks with a serious, eye-to-eye declaration about true love at first sight. He then clicks one of the paused TVs and reveals he has just repeated verbatim a schmaltzy monologue from a soap. She's so flustered she drops her purse, which will be important later.

She says his dad hired her and where he goes, she goes, but he can introduce her however he wants to protect his sobriety anonymity. So off they go, naturally, to a crime scene where he introduces her to police captain Gregson (Aidan Quinn) as his ""valet."" Gregson explains to Watson that when he was in London doing some post-9/11 stuff, Holmes was helping Scotland Yard as a consultant and his sleuthing skills blew Gregson away. Now that Holmes is in NYC they plan to use his services.

The case is a missing woman reported by her husband. It looks like the door was kicked in, there are glass shards in the kitchen, and there was a struggle in the bedroom. This is the home of the red-haired woman. Holmes deduces she knew her attacker because there were two broken glasses-- something overlooked by the police-- and the blood in the footprint on the door shows it was left afterward by someone who wanted it to look like it was busted down. Holmes also figures out that there was a panic room in the house. He finds the button behind the lamp and it reveals the red-haired woman lying in a pool of blood, dead on the floor. The husband, apparently, didn't know about the panic room.

The husband, of course, is questioned at first but his feet are too small for the footprint and his hand too small to have left the choking marks around his wife's neck. (A fact confirmed by former doctor Watson in a show of observation that Holmes clearly appreciates.)

Together the pair chase down more leads and come upon a flower delivery man who they think might be a serial killer attracted to red-haired women. Once it looks like they've got it all sewn up, the flower guy turns up dead of an apparent suicide and his cell phone is missing. At his house, a washing machine is turned over with clothes spilling out of it, and a glance at his pantry includes a bag of rice on the door.

The cops still think they have their guy but it's not sitting right with Holmes. The flower guy had been going to see a psychiatrist and recording his sessions. Then his shrink died and there is no record of seeing another doctor even though it was clear the flower guy was very disturbed. Holmes begins to suspect the husband again because he is also a psychiatrist and the flower guy was obsessed with redheads. He notices that the wife had once been a pretty blonde with a mole but when she died she was a flaming redhead who had undergone extensive plastic surgery.

Meanwhile, Holmes is trying to put off Watson by dimestore psychoanalyzing her past, unplugging her alarm clocks, and basically saying he will pay her to go away. He pisses her off so much at one point that she leaves to go to an opera she had planned for them to attend together. Full of new revelations, Holmes shows up, is generally a loud pain in the ass, and convinces her to leave to continue work on the case.

Holmes and Watson confront the husband again and Holmes lays out his theory that he wanted to off his very wealthy wife but couldn't do it himself. He had been treating flower guy who was obsessed with redheads and violent. So he started making his wife get plastic surgery and dye her hair. He started ordering flowers for her every week so the flower guy would see her and become obsessed. Instead of prescribing sedatives, he gave him steroids to agitate him. He basically made the guy into a loaded weapon aimed at his wife. The smug doctor basically admits this is true but knows Holmes has no evidence so he blows him off. Holmes promptly gets into Watson's car and rams the doctor's fancy sports car and is arrested.

When Watson comes to see him in jail he apologizes for wrecking her car and generally being an ass. She asks him what happened in London that sent him to rehab. He answers that it's a false premise that if she knows something personal about him that they will be closer. She notes that he has very few mirrors in his house, she thinks this is because he knows a lost cause when he sees one.

The next day they confront the doctor in Gregson's office. Holmes breaks it down: when he saw the overturned washer and noticed the missing cell phone he realized what happened. When Watson noticed the bag of rice in his pantry, even though she saw in his medical records that he was allergic to rice, she helped put two and two together. The flower guy accidentally washed his cell phone, ruining it. In a rage he overturned the washer. He then went to the store and bought some rice, which can act as a dessicant and save waterlogged electronics. Holmes produces the phone and hits a button: out comes the sound of a therapy session that flower guy recorded with the smug doctor as his shrink. Bullseye.

Later, back at the brownstone Holmes and Watson are planning to go to dinner but Watson wants to finish watching the Mets game. Holmes succinctly predicts how the last three at bats are going to go and how the game will end with a double play and says he'll wait for her downstairs. The game then ends precisely this way much to Watson's aggravation. They head out to dinner."

Holmes and Watson are at an AA-type meeting with a man sharing. When Watson notices Holmes zoned out she touches his shoulder and he jumps up shouting ""Amygdala!""

Turns out he's not into the whole 12 step thing, or really anything crowding his brain he doesn't deem ""necessary"" information so he puts himself in a trance when confronted with the unnecessary. He does this by internally chanting a mantra: amygdala.

They get a call from Gregson and head to the crime scene. A man has been shot in the head in an apartment building. He's a cop's brother so they have their best people on it including a young detective named Bell. They believe it was a robbery homicide. But with a few quick glances Holmes deduces it was a robbery AND a homicide committed by two different people.

He figures the robbery was done by a strong man because he notices a piece of furniture missing. He pins it quickly on the neighbor who called 911. The shooter on the other hand is still unknown but Holmes, after sniffing the chair where the shot originated, realizes it was a woman based on the remnant fragrances of her deodorant.

Back at the precinct house Bell is trying to get the neighbor to cop to the murder but he won't. And of course it's because he isn't the shooter as Holmes points out again to Gregson. He gets heated and Watson sends him to get some chips. She asks Gregson if he was like this before in London. Gregson says he was a pain in the ass but really good. He also notes that Holmes called him recently to get back to work, saying he was calling from Heathrow. Watson notes this.

Bell joins them and Holmes argues that a sketch artist should be brought in since the neighbor says he passed a woman on the stairs. Bell protests saying the neighbor overheard ""Harry Potter"" (Holmes) mention a woman and made it up. Gregson asks for one anyway saying Holmes might be wrong but he wants to check it out.

On their way out Watson says she's meeting a friend and Holmes deduces it's a male friend that is probably an ex that she might sleep with. He tells her she should since it will improve her mood.

Turns out Holmes was right as Watson meets with her ex, Ty, an assistant district attorney. He misses her and worries about her babysitting drug addicts and says if she's doing it as penance for losing a patient, she shouldn't. She says she does it because she's good at it. He notes her parents have reached out said she isn't returning their calls. She says she doesn't want to be lectured all the time.

The next morning Holmes notices on the autopsy that the dead guy had a special genetic condition that clouded his cornea. Watson wonders why it's relevant and Holmes says why not?

Bell calls them to a hospital. He has found the woman from the sketch. Unfortunately, she's been in a coma for three days having tried to commit suicide so she couldn't have killed the dead guy. Bell thanks Holmes for his help and says he'll take it from here.

Watson and Holmes stay behind to make sure the woman isn't faking. She isn't. But Holmes deduces that she has a twin thanks to the inscription on a book by her bed. They track down the twin but it's a dead end because she's fraternal.

Later at home, as Holmes practices lock picking, Watson unearths an old violin and encourages him to play as a form of therapy. He doesn't want to. She gets a call from Ty. As she answers, Holmes puts the violin in a trash can and sets it on fire. Watson, alarmed, throws a blanket over it but her ex is confused.

Holmes gets a call from Gregson and they head to another scene. A woman shot in the head with the same gun, by a seated shooter wearing the same deodorant. They also notice she has the same genetic corneal issue. Through DNA they figure out the first dead guy and the woman were half siblings with the same father. They didn't know each other and their families didn't know about them. Their mothers are dead and the families aren't helping.

Holmes, Watson, Bell and Gregson run down an investigator who was following the girl. Turns out Gregson knows him from their old days in the department. He says he can't tell them anything because it's to do with a case. Holmes pulls the guy out of the room and says he can tell he's been taking methamphetamines to stay awake and that his stash is nearby so unless he wants to get busted by the police he better help. The guy decides to simple ""leave this file"" on his desk and go to the bathroom.

Holmes and the gang head back to the fraternal twin who hired the detectives to investigate the victims. Turns out the victims were sired out of wedlock by the twins' dad and stood to inherit a fortune. Holmes theorizes the sisters had them investigated to figure out how to kill them. The woman says they only wanted to find out what kind of people they were, but before she and her sister could decide what to do her sister tried to commit suicide. Holmes implies that she tried to kill her sister to get even more of the inheritance. She slaps him and says she'd never hurt her sister. Bell and Gregson take her away but Holmes asks one more question: why go to all the trouble of dressing up like her sister, wig, deodorant, make-up to commit the crimes? She says he's insane.

They return to the brownstone and find Ty waiting for them with a bottle of wine in hand. He says Watson emailed him to come to the house for a dinner party. She shoos him off. Holmes hacked her email. He throws back in her face what she said about opening up to each other. He tells her smirkingly they don't have to be friends, they just have to get through the next five weeks and go their separate ways.

Watson drags Holmes to another meeting. But this time he listens, and as a woman shares about having an affair with a married doctor and using him to get drugs, Holmes has an epiphany. He charges out and Watson wants to know what's up. He says there isn't time. She says maybe they won't be friends but they need to trust each other so he has to let her in a bit.

They go to coma twin's hospital room and the other twin is reading to her. Holmes calls the awake twin a murderer and claims there is a third half sibling she didn't know about but that he will be protecting her himself at the address that he gives with her name. He then shoves Bell, who arrests him.

At the address Holmes gave, a woman is returning home. Someone else follows behind her into the house. As she's about to attack the police swoop in. It was all a trap of course. But the twist is that

it's coma sister holding the gun.

At the precinct Holmes explains that he realized coma sister enlisted her doctor for help. When they learned of the other heirs and her sister wanted to share, the doctor and coma sister came up with this elaborate plan: suicide attempt, coma to cover their tracks. He kept her in a medically induced coma when he wasn't around to fool everyone and woke her up to commit the murders. Awake sister wants to help coma sister even though she's a murderer. Holmes points out an important detail: why was coma sister still in a coma? She had killed all the heirs they knew about. Ah; that's right, she was going to kill her own sister. Oh, snap.

Case closed, Bell offers sincere thanks and Gregson invites Holmes and Watson for a drink. He takes a raincheck.

Back at the brownstone, over take out, Watson points out that Holmes listening in the meeting actually helped crack the case. He grudgingly thanks her. She asks if he ever thinks what he's doing is a form of penance without even knowing it. He says you have to know it, otherwise it isn't penance.

Later that night, while Watson is in bed upstairs, Holmes unearths another violin and begins to play."

A man who knows him pulls up beside him and offers him a ride. Adam gets in. The man leaves a bunch of balloons that say ""thank you"" for the boy's parents.

Present Watson finds Holmes has been up all night going through his old serial killer case files, he's called ""Balloon man."" Holmes heard about another abduction on his police scanner last night and is waiting to be called in. His phone rings.

On the scene, he learns the perp forced the lock on the girl's bedroom window and took her, leaving balloons. Her dad was at a bodega getting wine and her mom was at an art gallery opening. Holmes notices freshly broken ivy, presumably by the girl, Marianna Castillo.

""That's good, she's a fighter,"" says Detective Bell. ""If little girls could actually win fights against grown men then, yea, it would be cause for great optimism,"" Holmes says.

Inside, Holmes is aghast to find her parents are about to do a live TV plea for their daughter. He paints the camera to stop it then explains that the children the killer kept alive the longest were directly correlated to their parents' media exposure. ""The more interviews, the faster the children died,"" he says.

If they want their daughter back, they just have to listen to him, Holmes says.

Holmes goes through the parents' fridge and finds a bottle of wine. He confronts Mr. Castillo, knowing it wasn't labeled as bodegas do. There are two of many kitchen items and forwarded mail, so he thinks they split and got back together. There was also an incoming call from a Long Island number right before he left the house last night.

He confesses the coworker he had an affair with called, saying she was in the neighborhood. He went to the street to talk to her.

Holmes wants to talk to her, thinking she might have seen the suspect.

At the station, Captain Gregson talks to the mistress, Lori Thompson. Holmes informs Watson that in situations such as these that require his total concentration, she shouldn't talk to him unless he talks to her. Lori remembers a car running a stop sign and nearly hitting her.

Holmes deduces that the suspect got sloppy this time, usually he chloroforms his victims and Marianna was awake to break the ivy. He thinks it was because of the sirens. On the scanner, he heard a call right before the kidnapping of a domestic dispute two blocks away. Balloon Man must have thought the sirens were for him and sped off.

Lori saw the van, it was dark brown.

Holmes, Watson and Bell head to the neighborhood to look for more clues. As she worries that he hasn't eaten all day, he explains that talking about the case as she listens helps him draw connections he might not have otherwise.

He sees a car with multiple parking tickets, meaning it's been there for days. It's been sideswiped by a brown vehicle that was previously painted blue and white. He thinks it's a decommissioned NYPD van.

At the station, Holmes assures Watson her listening is a valuable service. For a while in London he talked only to a phrenology bust he kept in his study. He named him ""Angus.""

They get a hit on the BOLO for the van and find and follow it. The driver takes off and they give chase. The driver gets out and runs and Bell easily catches him. The van is empty.

The person Bell tackled is too young to be Balloon Man. Holmes recognizes a birthmark on his neck and realizes it's Balloon Man's first victim, Adam.

Back at the station, Adam isn't talking. They think he might have begun to sympathize with his captor. They wonder how much he might have helped Balloon Man with his killings.

Holmes asks for permission to talk to Adam.

He tells Adam he understands the man who took him also took care of him, taught him to drive and loved him. Sherlock tells him about being bulled in boarding school and how eventually he came to feel gratitude to his bully for paying attention to him, ""in tormenting me, he was attempting to correct what I knew to be wrong with myself."" He even covered for him.

He asks how Adam got a cut on his hand, he says it was from trying to open a window in his room.

Adam finally starts talking about how the man cares for him, evening bringing him donuts every morning. Gregson interrupts the interview, Adam's parents called a lawyer for him.

Adam's parents know the police suspect him. They're trying to get him immunity with the DA.

Holmes pulls Gregson aside and suggests that from what Adam said he now knows Balloon Man works nights. Holmes goes home with his old case files, determined to stay up all night. Waston offers to help. She shows him a squat exercise to help him stay awake.

In the morning, Holmes wakes Watson up. The early victims had all had their houses fumigated, but when the FBI checked into the employees, none were suspicious. Holmes thinks Balloon Man changed jobs. Recent victims' families or neighbors all had subscriptions to the same business newspaper.

He gets the delivery man's name from the company. Samuel Abbott.

Holmes and Watson wait in the van as teams bust into Abbott's apartment. It's totally empty, without furniture. But there's a bunch of balloons for the police that say ""Congrats!"" There's a flash drive attached. It has a recorded message from Abbott, confessing to killing six people and saying if he doesn't get his ""son"" Adam back by tomorrow, he'll kill Marianna.

Gregson catches the Castillos up on things. Mrs. Castillo asks Adam, who is 19, what he wants. Holmes points out that abuse victims are sometimes protective of their abusers, but it doesn't mean they should be reunited with them.

Gregson tells Holmes that no one with the NYPD can talk to Adam. Holmes asks where he is.

Waiting for Adam, Holmes thanks Watson for being willing to put up with a ""difficult person with a difficult process for the greater good."" He says he may even listen to her again in the future.

Holmes talks to Adam again. Adam calls Abbott his ""dad."" Holmes knows Adam loved him, but he didn't love what he did. Adam is confused and doesn't know what to do.

He asks Holmes if he signs the deal, will it make up for the things he's did. Holmes says no, he can never get their blood off his hands. ""But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try,"" he says.

Adam agrees to sign the paper and tell them where they live.

They bust in on Abbott at the table making a sandwich for Mariana. He grabs her when they bust in, threatening to shoot her. Instead, he tells them to tell Adam he's sorry. Then he shoots himself in the head.

Later, Holmes stands over his dead body. He's more feeble than Holmes expected, and wearing a back brace after multiple surgeries. He would have needed Adam to help him get around.

There's a dingy twin mattress on the floor and a real bed in the bedroom. Holmes hears a whistling noise and finds a broken window in the bedroom. He snaps a picture of a hair on the bed.

Then he announces Samuel Abbott is not the Balloon Man.

Holmes waits for Adam in his bedroom, he snuck in through the window. He reminds Adam that he said he cut himself on the window in his bedroom. He knows the bedroom with the lamps, mattress and TV was Adam's room, Samuel slept on the dingy twin mattress. He confirmed it by matching the hairs on each.

""You occupied the master bedroom because you were the master,"" Holmes says. ""You tricked me, Adam, which doesn't happen very often. I thought you were a dullard. You're actually quite brilliant. It must take a huge intellect for a boy to turn the tables on the man who abducted him,"" Holmes says. ""You have no idea,"" Adam says smugly. Holmes asks whose idea it was to take more children. ""I'd just turned 14, I was lonely,"" Adam says. ""No, what you wanted was to make someone else the victim, hurt them like you'd been hurt,"" Holmes says.

Adam remembers seeing his parents on TV at least once a day after he was abducted. He enjoyed it. Turning the tables on Abbott was easy, given his low IQ. The trade for Marianna was Adam's contingency plan in case he got caught. He knew the police would offer him immunity.

""Are you here to kill me, Mr. Holmes? Because I have to admit I find the possibility very exciting,"" Adam says. He announces he's going to brush his teeth and doesn't expect to see Holmes when he returns. He's thinking of leaving town soon.

Back at his house, Holmes throws knives at Adam's immunity deal, which spares him from prosecution for any crimes committed ""in consort"" with Samuel Abbott. ""I handed a psychopath a get-out-of-jail free card,"" he says.

Watson suggests Holmes try more squats instead of throwing knives, but he did too many and his back hurts. He has a back pain epiphany.

Holmes goes to find Adam in a park, watching a family with a young child. He asks about his fifth victim, Billy. They just ran the DNA under Billy's fingernails and it wasn't Abbott's. Holmes mentions the date of the abduction, the same time Abbott was in traction in the hospital for his back surgery. The deal only covers murders committed with Abbott.

""It was only one murder, and Samuel abused me. I'll be out soon,"" Adam says as police cars pull up for him.

Back home, Watson closes the blinds saying it's time for Holmes to sleep. He thinks he'll see everything with a new light on his solving high. ""I'm going to solve three cases by nightfall,"" he boasts. Watson steeps tea. When she turns around, Holmes is asleep on the floor."

We open on Watson frantically telling Capt. Gregson that she hasn't heard from Holmes in three hours. As a cop, he is not alarmed by this of course. She finally spills and tells him that she's not his assistant/valet/lover, she's his sober companion and they're supposed to check in at least every three hours and she's afraid he's relapsed.

We cut to a tight shot of Sherlock, looking like he's nodding off in a drug haze. The camera pulls back and reveals, however, he is waking up in a daze after being abducted since his hands and feet are bound.

We flash back to two days earlier. Watson is out for coffee with a friend when her buddy unleashes an ambush blind date on her. The guy Watson's friend told to meet her is also surprised it's a blind date but they both gamely try to go along with it. While he goes to get his drink Watson puts her hair up in a ponytail and gets a text from Holmes. He needs her.

She heads back to the house and he deduces she met a dude she liked because she put her hair up, which he knows she thinks looks prettier.(He thinks she's wrong.) But no time for that. Gregson has recommended him as a private investigator to a big deal Wall Street financial firm. The firm has a missing employee. The guy hasn't been missing long enough for the police to get involved but they want help.

Holmes throws on a dingy sweater, not kowtowing to the Wall St. lie of fine suits making the man in them any more fine inside, and they head out to meet the board.

The CEO is unimpressed with the look of Sherlock and is dubious about hiring him. After Holmes embarrrassing members of the board with naughty deductions about them, the CEO finally gives in.

First stop is the missing employee's office. Holmes notices lots of fancy books whose spines have never been cracked on his shelves. One has. He pulls the book out and inside finds a fancy brochure for fancy prostitutes. They track down the ""executive private accountant"" who helps the employee handle said prostitutes who gives up the secret apartment the guy used.

Watson and Holmes head to the apartment and discover the man, needle in his arm, dead of an apparent heroin overdose. Holmes, familiar with heroin addiction, isn't buying that this incredibly tidy, functional man died this way. He notices a half eaten salad nearby and deduces that a person who knew him dosed him with enough heroin in his salad dressing to incapacitate him and then dragged him to the chair, shot him up, and made it look like an overdose.

Watson pulls Holmes aside and checks in with him being around all of this drug stuff. He does not want to talk about it or go to a meeting.

Gregson and the other cops are skeptical about Holmes's theory but Holmes convinces them to send the salad to the lab anyway.

He also sits in on a meeting with the dead guy's wife in which he is, typically rude and insensitive, but discovers an important fact: the man who did this job before him also died under murky circumstances. After a little digging Holmes discovers that a handful of people from the company have died in the last couple of years and starts looking for suspects, starting with the powerful CEO.

Meanwhile Watson has gone on a dinner date with the set up guy and she really liked him but she's put off by the fact that she could tell he lied to her about never being married. Holmes says it's easy to figure out via the Internet. Watson doesn't want to cyber stalk but before she can get the sentence out Holmes has already clicked his way to learning that the guy is CURRENTLY married. Watson doesn't believe her friend would set her up with a married man.

Holmes also hears from the NYPD lab that there was heroin in the salad dressing.

Holmes calls a meeting with the board of directors and lays out the weird evidence of the dead employees. All of the board members scoff at the idea of someone in the company killing their way up the ladder. The CEO says the only person whose career path matches what Holmes is laying out is him. Holmes agrees he's a good suspect.

Later that day the CEO shows up at Sherlock's place saying he's going to ""end this."" Mad that Sherlock accused him in front of his employees. He says he's completely innocent and runs down his alibi for the first murder including surgery for a facelift. He says all of the employees are sociopaths and gives him a file of an intern who might have been responsible. Holmes can't work it out.

Watson gets another invite from the married guy who wants to explain himself. Holmes tells her to go. The guy says he did lie, and he married a woman from Kosovo to help her get a green card for political asylum and they can get a divorce in a year. He apologizes. Watson calls him compassionate. He wonders how she found out.

Holmes goes to see the dead guy's secretary, whose name popped up in the intern's file. She has followed the CEO during his meteoric rise in the company. He says every time her boss got promoted she got perks too, pay raises, stock options. She wonders if her boss knew about her killing people or if she worked alone. She blows him off with some of her own deductions and a taser.

We then cut to him in the scene waking up bound from the top of the episode. She has him in the back of his car. He claims he emailed a bunch of people about her and his whereabouts. She knows he didn't. She tells him that they will soon be arriving at the CEO's country home and in a week or two they will find his body buried on the property and Fowkes will go down for it. Holmes points out that when that former intern gets a promotion he'll need a seasoned secretary for help. She appreciates his smarts. He grabs a paper clip off some paper in the backseat and begins working on his handcuffs. She sees a text from Watson and texts back that everything is ""okay."" She tries to get Sherlock to dig his own grave but he refuses.

We cut to Watson spilling to Gregson. She says she believes the heroin from the crime scene affected him. But she looks at the text and knows, since it is written out completely instead of in his wacky text abbreviations that it's not from him.

The secretary puts the gun to his head. He's still working on the cuffs so to stall he invites her to monologue about her ingenius plans. Because she is a TV villain she takes this opportunity and is about to tell when cops show up. He wheels on her, unbound, grabs her gun and tazes her.

Watson explains about the text message giving the secretary away. He thanks her sort of, after a long way down the road of thanking himself. She tells him that she told Captain Gregson about their arrangement and apologizes saying he might want to have a talk with him.

Later Holmes goes to see Gregson. He tries to explain and apologize about how he was embarrassed about his history since Gregson holds him in such high esteem. He says he deserved to know. Gregson said he did know and he did his research before allowing him to consult with the NYPD. Holmes wonders why he didn't say anything. He said he did, sort of. He remnds him he asked him out for a drink recently and Holmes declined. Gregson says he figured Holmes would tell him when he was ready. He wasn't happy that Holmes didn't tell him but his work hasn't slipped one bit since Scotland Yard. He says not everyone is going to see it his way so he's going to keep a lid on Sherlock's secret.

Later Sherlock practices freeing himself from cuffs while Watson fields what she thinks is a blow off message from green card marriage guy. She says she isn't actually interested but is still annoyed that he doesn't seem interested, likely because he was freaked that she snooped online about him. Sherlock says seeing puzzles everywhere has it's own price to pay since deceits and illusions inform the things that people do.

Dejected, she goes for a run. Sherlock frees himself."

Holmes is choking a man. The twist of course is that he's already dead. As is his wont Holmes is hanging out in the morgue in a hospital doing research on dead people who donated their bodies to science. Watson is also hanging out but not so comfortable. Holmes surmises that it's not the dead people per se but being back in the hospital setting. She says she's fine but they better motor if they want to get to an exhibit at the Met that they're attending.

Holmes is good to go until he notices something on one of the bodies. A small mark on the thumb leads him to conclude that the man died of murder, not cardiac arrest. He posits that someone gave him epinephrine which mimicked a heart attack. Watson tries to protest but puts the clues together herself with her doctor brain and concurs. The man died that day so they head to his room to check out any evidence that might be there. A janitor is inside cleaning up. Holmes unceremoniously kicks him out and bars the door so he can look for clues. He finds an important one. Lipstick on one of the two coffee cups in the room, which means the dead man had a visitor.

Before they can follow up they're hauled into the hospital administrator's office with Gregson who wants Holmes to apologize. If he does the hospital will cooperate with the investigation. They meet the head of surgery Dr. Baldwin during this exchange-- a big, handsome dude-- who clearly doesn't like the puny little cranky admin guy. They also run into an old colleague of Watson's, a doctor named Carrie who wonders if Watson is applying for a position at the hospital. Watson explains she's out of medicine. Carrie says she thought her suspension was only a few months. Watson says it was but she's pursuing other stuff now.

Free of the hospital Holmes and Watson trace the cup back to the coffee shop where the pervy barista remembers the hot blonde-- and also hits on Watson. They track the blonde down at her job in a fancy cosmetics store and she explains the dead man was a neighbor who was terminally ill that she was kind to in the final months of his life, talking to him and reading to him since he'd lost his sight. She has an alibi but says she did once hear a doctor tallking to him late at night.

They leave and Holmes posits the theory that the hospital has an ""angel of mercy,"" someone killing terminally ill patients.

They go to Dr. Baldwin who says he will help pressure the administrator into giving Holmes the records he needs to continue to investigate this theory.

Holmes and Watson narrow it down to 9 victims out of 73 cardiac arrests. They have 23 suspects who had access to the patients.

Watson goes to talk to her friend Carrie for help while Holmes does the interviews.

At the hospital Holmes apologizes to the janitor in the elevator for kicking him out of the room. The janitor says no problem but then hits every button on the elevator before he gets out.

Sherlock goes to talk to Dr. Baldwin as his first suspect because 3 of the 9 patients were his. Holmes has also uncovered that Baldwin is on probation and one strike away from getting canned because even though he is brilliant and good he takes on risky maneuvers and patients. In addition to an alibi for the most recent murder Baldwin also points out that his favorite kind of patient is the unconscious kind and he's not really interested in whether they're suffering or not. In other word he's too indifferent to be the angel of death.

Watson's friend gets an emergency call while she's with her and asks her to come along for the ride. The patient is a 12 year old soccer player with a torn ACL. Watson notices funky markings on her toes and thinks it's endocarditis and asks Carrie to run some tests before surgery because if she's right, surgery could be dangerous.

Holmes and Detective Bell conduct interviews including one with a jumpy surgical resident. Bell tries the soft touch but Holmes undermines him and lets the guy go, deducing he's not their killer.

Holmes and Watson debrief and he admits he has no leads. Holmes also points out that Watson let him believe that she was no longer a doctor and she clearly had some issue with her friend. Watson says she let her license expire and she lost touch with hospital friends when she lost her patient. Carrie texts that the soccer patient is fine but Watson is still unsure. Holmes tells her not to accept this, and to go with her gut. He then notices the car of the jumpy surgical resident still in the parking lot after he'd complained in his interview that he'd been working round the clock and just wanted to go home.

In the hospital, the jumpy resident grabs a syringe and enters a patient's room. He's not their guy though. Turns out he's been stealing morphine. Even still, they catch him in the act which is good. But Holmes is mad that he didn't realize the guy was an addict.

As they go over more hospital records Watson notices that one victim wasn't terminal, a young female patient. Gregson calls and says the druggie doctor is talking and offering to help. At the precinct he explains that one night when he was stealing drugs from a patient a doctor came and he hid in the bathroom. He overheard the doctor talking to a terminal patient. Holmes goes to investigate again.

Watson goes to her friend Carrie again to ask for more tests for soccer girl. Carrie says she's overstepping and she and Watson fight about it.

They notice one of the victims was not a native English speaker and was in fact Ukrainian and likely needed to be spoken to in that language. No doctors at the hospital speak it but someone does: the janitor. It turns out he was a doctor in the Ukraine. After being confronted with the evidence, he confesses saying ""I freed them."" He maintains, however, that the woman that Holmes is saying wasn't terminal in fact was, that she had cancer. They walk out and Gregson congratulates him on his good work. Holmes is bothered though, he thinks the janitor is telling the truth about the woman.

At home Holmes looks over the janitor's very meticulous notes.

Watson's friend Carrie shows up. It turns out Watson was right, the girl had endocarditis. And how did they find this out? It turns out that SOMEONE ordered a test on the girl's chart. That someone was not Carrie. Watson feebly points out that one of their old professors said it was better to be lucky than good and that Carrie was lucky. Still, Carrie is mad. Watson says she knows what it's like not to be lucky. Carrie says that Watson was a good friend but a better doctor and leaves. Holmes compliments Watson on her catch.

The next day they bring Dr. Baldwin back to the station. They say they've discovered that someone else knew about the angel of mercy and that someone is him. They lay out the evidence: Baldwin left a clamp in the dead woman's chest. This would've been his third strike. So he conspired to make her a target for the angel by falsely claiming she had cancer on her chart and turning down her pain medication to make her feel the pain that the angel was attracted to stopping. After she died, he took the cancer results out of her charts. The only problem is the janitor, in order to take his meticulous notes, took pictures of the charts and they have Baldwin's signature on the doctored charts. Busted.

At home Holmes tells Watson that he liked seeing her in her former element and that Carrie was right, she was a good doctor. Watson concedes that she had her moments. He wonders if she thinks she might give it a go again. Unlikely. She heads up to her bedroom and looks at photos of her friends and colleagues in the hospital during her doctor days... and deletes them from her computer."

Watson awakes to Holmes' blaring police scanners. He laments that it's been a slow week.

Watson lets him know that his dad is coming into town and wants the two of them to meet him for dinner. He feels like this is very unlikely.

He hears a juicy ""incident"" on the scanner: a plane crash. They head off to the scene on the beach. Gregson is already there and tells Holmes they don't need him. Of course, he still asks the woman in charge what's going on. She thanks him for his offer of help and tells him she's all set. Gregson offers to give him cold cases to work on but Holmes instead goes to look at the crash victims and deduces they were all attorneys. He also deduces that one of the victims was already dead before the plane crashed. He also deduces he was killed by a wrench.

The NTSB official recounts an eyewitness account of the plane suddenly climbing, then shuddering, then crashing. Holmes spins his theories: 3 passengers, two men, one woman, all attorneys. One pilot. All dead. He wonders about air rage and notes the differences in granules of sand. Watson points out that since the killer died in the crash and thus isn't roving around why Holmes cares. She says he seems a bit off. He wants to ID the killer and learn the story. And, Watson points out, to forestall his father.

They go to speak to the last people who saw the victims alive. A friend of the pilot, who owns the company, knew the victims a little bit since they flew them a lot. He tells them there's a security camera in the parking lot the footage of which he can get them. The guy says the pilot is not their guy since he was a good guy.

Watson tells Holmes that his dad wants to meet for dinner at 6 and points out that he must have cared enough to put Holmes in rehab. Holmes says that his father doesn't care about him or Watson and he only did what he did out of familial obligation. He says his father is a serial absentee.

Detective Bell calls Watson and Holmes into Gregson's office. The three attorneys were headed to Martha's Vineyard to work on a class action case against a company called Carmanto Foods, whose sugar subsitute might cause cancer, there was a potential 100 million dollar payday for the victims. It turns out the murder victim Hank Girard was butting heads with his boss and fellow passenger Walter Devlin about how to proceed with the case. Devlin wanted to settle, Girard wanted to go to court and they had loud arguments.

The NTSB woman calls and says they've found the black box. Holmes translates the pilot talk but also hears the passengers fighting, including Ellie Wilson. There is a tussle and the woman yells, the pilot and plane go into distress and then the transmission ends. The NTSB woman thinks Holmes was right. He realizes he was wrong. After hearing only Devlin yelling in the ""fight"" he theorizes anew: Girard was killed elsewhere, earlier in the day and stuck in the cargo hold. Devlin though Girard missed the fight and called to yell at him which is why we didn't hear Girard's voice. The plane hit the kind of turbulence the NTSB woman thought it did originally and crashed. Girard's body was uncovered in the crash. The wrench was nowhere to be found even though almost everything else was recovered, thus the murder scene and the crash site are two different places. They find Girard's damaged phone and hear the voicemail that Devlin left. They realize they have a murderer to find after all since everyone who died in the crash was innocent.

Back at the precinct Holmes tries to work it out. Watson theorizes that Holmes is frightened of flying. He bristles at this. She asks how he got from London to New York, he doesn't answer. Bell comes in and says the charter company owner has video for them. It shows Girard alive, arguing with some fat dude. They ask the owner and another employee to clear out so they can analyze the scene.

Back at Holmes' place he determines that the man Girard argued with worked at Carmanto Foods, any employee of which would've had motive. Unfortunately, they have a lot of fat white guy employees. He does however, have an identifying, ancient pager. Watson says she's getting ready to meet the elder Mr. Holmes. Holmes scoffs and says he won't show that ""He's Lucy with the football, you're Charlie Brown."" She points out that it's not a pager, it's an insulin pump, there fat guy is a diabetic.

Bell and Holmes go to see the guy. He tries to claim he doesn't know the victim. They connect the dots for him. He shuts his office door and admits he was helping him as a whistleblower. He says Hank was angry because he refused to testify after Carmanto offered what he thought was a reasonable settlement. Holmes gets nervous when he watches him open his pill bottle. They leave. Holmes points out to Bell that he's no longer a suspect since his diabetes clearly makes it difficult for him to grip things-- like opening a pill bottle-- so there's no way he could've swung the wrench.

Watson meets Holmes' dad (who is played Roger Rees). He seems nice enough. He knows his son isn't coming. He admits to having laid as many bricks in the wall between them as his son has. He asks after him. Watson reports that he's mostly well with his sobriety but not so good on going to support groups. Daddy Holmes says he's always been stubborn since childhood. Watson says she's happy to be meeting with him and wants to know much more. Daddy Holmes says he wants to ask her one first: how's the sex? He says he figured part of the deal was sex giving how high her rates are. She realizes this is not Mr. Holmes. Sherlock hired an actor to mess with her since he knew his dad wouldn't show.

Back at the hangar, Holmes drags Bell along to talk to the NTSB woman about a new theory about the wacky sand he found. He realized that someone put sand in the gas tank, which would've stalled the plane. Someone wanted it to crash. Whoever sabotaged the flight also probably killed Girard. The person who sabotaged it was probably counting on it to crash in the water on the way to Martha's Vineyard and wash away the evidence of the sand. But it crashed prematurely on the beach and revealed them and that Girard was already dead.

Watson returns from her faux dinner. She isn't speaking to him. He says it was a good prank and she should appreciate the fact that he knew his dad wasn't coming. He informs her about the sabotage and says he's got a suspect and would like to go and confront him and wants her to come. She stalks off to bed. He tells her that she should've trusted him when he said his dad wouldn't show. She says she doesn't trust him because despite knowing him for weeks he's shared virtually nothing so they're still practically strangers and if he wants to pound on a criminal's door he should call the police.

So he does. Dragging Bell to the house of the other charter company employee who showed them the video and mentioned the camera that shot the other angle was broken. He's also a pilot. Holmes tells him that he knows that he and the dead pilot had a big fight. He says the pilot was mad at him for poaching one of his clients who was a big tipper. Holmes isn't buying this and thinks maybe the saboteur was mad at the charter airline itself and dug into some of the logs to follow up. He discovered that every time this guy flew back from Miami he recorded a weight of exactly 66 pounds over the weight of the passengers. Only Miami and why 66 pounds? It's exactly 30 kilos, which is good for cocaine smuggling. Holmes theorizes the dead pilot threatened him. Hank Girard caught him in the act of sabotage so he killed him and threw him in the cargo hold since he knew the plane was going to crash anyway. The guy thinks it's an impressive theory. The guy says he wasn't near the hangar this morning because he was with his boss whose car had stalled.

Watson awakes to Holmes in her room and says she was right that he is drawn to weird plane things because he sees so much,deduces so much when he gets onto a plane. He asks if she's still cross. He says he was attempting to demonstrate his trust. She wonders how since he was sharing something he already knew.

The owner of the charter company, who reeks of airplane glue much to Holmes' dismay, says the other guy called him and confessed about the drugs and how the dead pilot threatened to go to the police. The owner is all clammy and pale. He says he asked him to confirm his alibi that they were together but the owner says he wasn't with him. Gregson and the others step out, Bell goes after the guy but he's ankled. They find the wrench in his garage, which seems weird. Holmes determines the wrench was in the water recently. He thinks someone disposed of it and reclaimed it and planted it here after killing the guy. They find his money from his smuggling operation though and determine it must've been the charter company owner-- who could've benefitted from the smuggling operation as well and told them that the other guy confessed to do it all-- who actually did it all.

They go back to the precinct and the guy sticks to the story. Holmes thinks he's clammy and nervous because he's the murderer. Watson thinks the guy is actually dying of some medical condition he looks so unwell. Watson notices a scar on his wrist that lines up with a story that the actor told her about Sherlock's childhood. She tells him she has an errand to run and excuses herself. Gregson and Bell come out and say they can't get him to cop to it. Holmes looks at Bell filling up the guy's water glass. Gregson wants to cut him off, Holmes says to bring him a whole pitcher, noticing the smell of plane glue has transferred from the guy to Bell it's so strong.

Watson seeks out Alistair, the actor who played Faux Daddy Holmes. She says she knows he's not just some actor Sherlock hired, she knows he knows him or else Sherlock wouldn't have shared the story of his childhood scar with him. Alistair really is an actor but he also works at a bookstore where Watson tracks him down. He says Sherlock wrote him a fan letter from a radio show he was doing when Sherlock was 10. He says that they became a kind of friends. Meaning Sherlock would arrive with outlandish requests for help. She says it doesn't sound like much of a friendship. He tells her to revise her definition because if she expects Sherlock to relate to her like others he will migrate out of her life and she will be the poorer for it. Sherlock told him about Watson and Alistair says he's glad Watson has him. Alistair knew him when he was using but he thought he would grow out of it. He showed up at Alistair's house 9 months earlier high out of his mind. He flushed his drugs and looked after him for a day. Sherlock kept repeating a name but insisted the next day it meant nothing. Watson says she wants to help Holmes and needs Alistair's help to do it. She thanks him for his time and apologizes for bothering him. He tells her the name. (We don't hear it though.)

Sherlock goes in to see the charter company owner in the interrogation room. Holmes theorizes that he's drinking so much water due to blood loss. He figures that during the fight with the other guy he was injured and used model plane glue to seal the wound, an old military trick that would've kept him from going to the hospital and having the injury on record. The guy balks and Sherlock offers to let him go after he takes off his shirt and pants. The guy admits that he cut his side open on a sharp piece of metal and it's coincidental. Gregson moves in and tries to intimidate him. The guy continues to deny. Then they point out the wrench issue and how he framed the other guy. They realize he probably threw the guy's body in the same water he threw the wrench in. They tell him to tell everything he knows to get life in prison instead of the death penalty.

Watson comes home to a tidying Holmes. She says she has a question to ask him about his past. She says she knows about Irene and says she wants Holmes to tell her about Irene. He turns and stares at her, unhappy and surprised."

We see a masked intruder shoot two people whose faces are covered with pillows.

We cut to a tense Holmes-Watson househould. Holmes apparently has taken to be speaking only when spoken to. Watson says she knows she touched a nerve by asking about Irene but as his sober companion that's her job.He changes his tune and says he understands where she's coming from and says he respects that she must do what she must do. To toast this detente he says he wants to get a cup of coffee and then he runs out the door, having lied to simply get away.

Holmes goes to the crime scene, sees the double murder and immediately connects to a series of three murders that happened in 1999, right down to a missing high heel shoe taken as a souvenir. Gregson, then a detective, put away the guy Wade Crews, and thus advanced his career. So they figure they either have a copycat, someone working with Wade from prison, or that Wade was innocent in the first place. Holmes wants to talk to Wade but Gregson gets his back way up about this saying that is not a lead and that they should follow other evidence first. Holmes notes how agitated Gregson gets about this.

Watson shows up at the precinct. Holmes says that unless and until she stops pushing they will revert to how things were originally with him just being civil to her until such time as her father stopped paying her. Until then he will check in every two hours and she can drug test him but that's all, she will have lost all the good will she has accrued.

A task force is started to catch the guy before he kills again and it includes Gregson's old partner, D'Amico (played by Callie Thorne). Holmes also notes that there seems to be little love lost between them and it must've ended badly.

They run down a lead on a contractor who sent threatening emails to the dead couple. He turns out to have an alibi and it's twisted indeed. He's been keeping a sex slave in his basement-- discovered by Holmes-- and she admits he was with her the night of the murder.

Meanwhile, Watson goes to visit Holmes' rehab to find out more info about her charge and who Irene might be. Both of this therapists reveal they learned nothing from the very difficult patient. Watson notices a groundskeeper using beekeeping equipment on a hive and knows she's on to something. She goes to talk to him and indeed the man, Edison, knew Holmes and of his beekeeping interests. Holmes opened up a bit to him and when Watson asks about Irene he produces a pile of letters Holmes left behind: return address Irene Adler.

Holmes and Gregson finally go to speak to Crews who protests his innocence saying Gregson framed him with a mug that had his fingerprints on it. He also notes how his arrest helped further Gregson's career and then he quotes Tolstoy and talks about how he has learned to control his anger. Gregson not so much. They leave thinking they don't really have anything, but of course they do. And Holmes again brings up his possible innocence much to Gregson's chagrin and he tells Holmes to watch Gregson's police interrogations to see what a bad guy he is.

They go to visit the woman who was Wade's alibi. She recanted because she was having an affair with him and didn't want to ruin her marriage. When they arrive they are informed by her son that she died four years earlier of leukemia.

There is another murder and this time a third person is killed, which is different from the M.O. of the original killings.

At home Holmes watches the interview tape and sees something. He goes to Watson and asks for a truce so she can help work something out. They look and see that the mug that Wade drank out of during his interviews was the same one found at the crime scene.

Holmes goes to Gregson with this. In turn,Gregson, rattled goes to D'amico and asks if she planted the mug. She admits she did and says she figured he knew. He says even though his career would be over he has to tell the truth if Wade is innocent.

Watson brings the letters to Holmes who asks if she now knows all about him. She says of course she was tempted to read them but didn't. He promptly tosses them in Watson's smoothie blender. They put this aside and do more digging on the case. Holmes discovers a recently released ex-con who was a free man during the murders but imprisoned ever since. They think he may be a likely accomplice/copycat of Wade's. They break into his place-- which is sticky and dirty-- and find the murder weapon.

They bring the guy in but it turns out that he's blind in one eye and couldn't have possibly shot the third person and it seems all a little too convenient, as if he was framed.

While watching a news interview with Wade again protesting his innocence, Holmes notes that Wade quoted Oscar Wilde. When he went to prison he was an illiterate. So they deduce whoever taught him to read may have been his accomplice. They run down the folks from a prison library and discover that one of the people working there was the son of the woman with which Wade had an affair. It turns out that Wade is his daddy. They put two and two together and realized that the apple didn't fall too far from the tree. The son did the new killings to make it seem like his father had indeed been framed and would be set free. They go to see Wade and inform him that the jig is up. Wade is dragged away still protesting his innoncence.

Back at home, Watson says good night. Holmes cracks and gives up that Irene was a friend, they were quite close, and he did not take her passing well. He says good night."

We open on Sherlock watching several TVs as he likes to do to sharpen his mind. Watson enters and wants to talk about him getting a sponsor since her stint is almost up. He says he doesn't need one. She essentially forces him to meet with a guy that she has picked out.

We then switch to a hipster web design firm where young people bustle around complaining about the olds. We hear a beeping that one young guy tracks to a vent but figures someone just left their cellphone in there.The camera zooms into the vent. It's not a phone, it's a bomb and it goes off.

As the cops investigate they report the bomb killed two people and injured eleven others. Holmes and Watson survey the wreckage. He notes she probably won't miss this when she gets a new client. She says she won't but doesn't have a new client. Holmes picks up some pieces of newspaper and deduces it was packing material for the bomb. He then finds a motherboard from a pager which was likely the detonator.

While they wait for intel on the motherboard they go to meet the sponsor Adrian. Holmes essentially dismisses him out of hand and stalks off after giving him an impossible hypothesis to solve. Watson accuses him of there being no right answer to the question and that they will look for other sponsor candidates at a meeting tonight.

The motherboard gives them the number of the call that set off the bomb. It traces to a guy who essentially dialed the wrong number.

Looking at the bomb parts Sherlock notices it has a four year old battery and that the newspaper bits were also from 2008, so he deduces they found the man who set it off accidentally in 2012 and must find the person who meant to set it off intentionally in 2008.

Holmes and Watson go to investigate at a high-powered PR company that used to occupy the same office space in 2008. They meet with the well-heeled owners, including the company boss Helen, a crossword puzzle enthusiast like Sherlock who solves a few clues on the puzzle on her computer while talking to her. They put Holmes on to an eco-terrorist group that sent them threatening letters in 2008.

At an AA meeting Sherlock reads about the organization and ignores a woman sharing. He discovers it wasn't really an organization but one man. Watson presses him to look around for a sponsor. He says they're not his kind of addicts and the search will take longer. Then a reformed addict and carjacker named Alfredo begins to share and Sherlock says he wants him.

Back at home he fixates on a repeated phrase in the emails and knows that he's heard it recently. He realizes it was on television and he stands in front of his 7 TVs and jogs his memory. He recalls he heard it on a talk show. He finds the clip of the man using the phrase on the show and they track him down, Edgar Knowles.

They call him in to the precinct. Of course at first he denies being a bomber or eco-terrorist but then Sherlock gets his fingerprint from the elevator button and matches it to a bomb that went off in Utica. Knowles admits to the Utica bomb and the threatening letters but he promises he didn't set off this bomb, the one that, you know, killed people.

Sherlock sets off several mini-tennis-ball-bombs on his roof to do research. Knowles admitted using nitrate based bombs and Sherlock says this would be consistent with an eco-terrorist using organic materials but the bomb at the PR firm was petroleum, gas, and bleach-based so he knows Knowles is telling the truth.

Gregson is annoyed that Sherlock first served this guy up on a platter but now doesn't think he did it. But, Sherlock has also pieced together the newspaper page and discovered handwriting imprinted on it, the word ""novocaine."" He now believes a disgruntled employee-- with the cover of the eco-terrorist threat-- framed Knowles.

Watson waits with Alfredo but Sherlock cancels. She apologizes and chats with him a little and finds that she likes him; he talks about needing to be patient. He's never been a sponsor but says he had a great one and is looking forward to it.

Sherlock goes to the PR firm and begins his search in the personnel files. Helen, the boss, IDs him as a fellow addict... of crosswords. She starts hitting on him. He realizes that she wants to sleep with him and, while he's totally amenable since he finds her tantalizing, he's busy now and suggests they schedule an appointment and then she should not expect a relationship because that's not how he rolls. Watson arrives just then and Helen vamooses. Holmes has found a suspect, one Pradeep Singh, an upwardly mobile creative director. Although Singh was good he was also arrogant and after a fight with the male boss he just disappeared.

They go to his wife who says he's dead because he wouldn't have run away and disappeared because he loved her so much. She thinks he was murdered but the police cleared a man at the office. Sherlock asks about renovating the room they're sitting in. She says she hasn't. He asks to look in the back yard. But this is a feint, Watson and the wife go outside and he goes to look at a moldy wall. He takes the pictures off of it, runs his hands over it and listens. He meets them outside and tells Watson that he believes Pradeep was murdered and then buried in his own wall: hence the mold. He could tell because the pictures on the wall were in slightly different places then they were in a picture on a nearby table. She asks if he's sure. He says fairly sure. We cut to where Sherlock has ripped the wall open and revealed the decomposing body.

Back at the precinct they realize the bomb probably wasn't set by Pradeep because it was right near his office and he never missed a day of work. He was the target. In the dead man's pockets they find a safety deposit box key. Inside the box they find a Cheech and Chong video. They take the video to Sherlock's house because he has a VCR. While Det. Bell takes a call in the other room Watson presses Sherlock on bailing on Alfredo. She theorizes that he has separation anxiety about her leaving and once she said she liked Alfredo he turned him down to extend her stay. He scoffs at this. Bell returns and they watch the tape. It's a recording of a very young Pradeep meeting a prostitute. When she turns toward the camera we see it's his boss at the PR firm, Helen, also much younger.

They bring her in and show her the video. At first she tries to pretend it isn't her as Sherlock monologues about what happened-- he recognized her, threatened her. She planted the bomb but didn't realize there wasn't a signal tower close enough to the office to set it off. Since she came from modest means with a laborer dad she killed Pradeep, rehung the drywall while his wife was in Mumbai, moved office and voila, problem solved. She was ho-ing to help put herself through business school and then seed her company. She thinks he has no evidence. Then he plays the trump card: ""novocaine,"" which was imprinted on one of the newpaper pages. It was the answer to a clue to a crossword puzzle in the paper in 2008. They matched her handwriting sample. Boom, they arrest her.

Later, Alfredo shows up unbidden at Sherlock's home. He has parked out front an incredibly fancy car. As a reformed car jacker, dealers and manufactures hire him to try and break their car security systems. He says he knows Sherlock likes to pick locks. In an aside to Watson, Sherlock says he knows this was her idea. She says that whether he is dreading her leaving or counting the seconds to when he is free of her, she wants him to be taken care of. It was a smart move daring him to beat the new security system and he can't resist. He tells her it doesn't mean he's assenting to Alfredo's sponsorship. Sherlock starts to work it out and asks Alfredo for clues. He won't give any. Sherlock says that it's quite alright, he'll work it out and says, ""I'm entirely self-sufficient you know."""

A man stares into a masked man's face. The masked man is holding a gun. He shoots the first man.

Sherlock has a nasty cold this week and is thus also making Watson miserable. Luckily, Bell sends a text that they've got a dead body and invites Holmes to come check out the scene. They head down and the dead body is the man we saw getting shot. Turns out he was shot in both eyes. Gruesome.

Sherlock quickly deduces that this is not the crime scene and that the man is a professor of Asian studies.

They head off to the college the next day to check out his office with the help of his TA Brendan and determine that he had a thing for the number 13 and that means he was fond of gambling in Asian underground parlors.

They visit said underground parlors to find their perp. Their final destination is the crime scene-- which Holmes deduces by recently spackled walls and a janitor bleaching part of the floor. They determine the man is not the janitor but the owner-- thanks to his fancy shoes belying his janitor apron-- and discover the parlor had video surveillance. This surveillance leads them to one Raul who says he was hired to off the man by an unseen third party who contacted him only by a burner cellphone.

When they discover that Brendan had recently gotten a scathing refusal of recommendation for a job from the dead man they figure he did it. They also deduce that Brendan was having an affair with the dead man's wife- he made her awesome mix cds of sappy love songs like ""My Heart Will Go On""-- on whom their suspicion now falls figuring she framed Brendan by leaving the phone in his house.

When they go to her with this theory she admits to the affair with Brendan-- who has now confessed-- but that she did not kill her husband even though she had motive-- it turns out that he was an abusive sex maniac who brought her back from Asia promising to marry her but never did and instead made her his sex slave. She wants to prove this with videos he made of his evil conquests but his computer has been wiped clean.

Holmes not believing Brendan's confession but also believing the (not)wife didn't do it is perplexed-- and now worried since the wife is about to be deported-- until Watson clues him in to an anomaly in the dead man's eyes. It turns out that the professor had a painful, terminal eye condition and only had months to live. They deduce that he discovered his wife's affair with Brendan, wrote the damaging letter to make it appear that Brendan had motive to kill him, and then paid Raul-- who lived in Brendan's neighborhood-- to kill him, asking him to shoot him in the eyes as a symbolic gesture of relieving him of his pain, and then plant the phone at Brendan's house.

This, however, is hard to prove until Watson, again, notices something. Raul lived in Brendan's neighborhood yes but a few blocks away. Why didn't the dead man find someone even closer to do the deed to help cast suspicion, like say, the registered sex offender who lived in Brendan's building. They go to said sex offender and hit the jackpot. It turns out that the dead man did approach him but the sex offender was suspicious and installed surveillance equipment and lured him back to his apartment. Armed with video showing that the dead man showed up with hit money, they are able to solve the case; as the episode title says ""You do it to yourself."" Brendan and the (not)wife decide to marry that day to avoid her deportation.

In the B story, Watson is called by an ex named Liam to help him out of a jam. He is in Riker's, arrested for a hit-and-run. Unfortunately, he is a former addict who started using again and blacked out the night of the accident and believes he left the keys in the ignition and someone went for a joyride. He still swears he didn't do it. Watson is skeptical. Holmes, thinking Liam is a former client, prods her gently to look at Liam's arrest report. In it she sees how badly the car was smashed and notes he didn't have a scratch on him. She also notes that a silver keychain pendant that she gave him is missing and thinks perhaps, even though it wasn't worth anything, thieves might've thought it valuable. Holmes then deduces Watson was sleeping with him and wonders how long into their relationship she waited to do this. Watson finds the pendant in a pawn shop and goes to the police. It turns out that there has been a rash of joyriders in the area and Liam is cleared. He promises Watson he will now try rehab again and asks for her help. She is understandably wary but offers to get him into a clinic but says this is all she will do, they will not reconcile, and she will not be waiting when he is done. Later, she waits at the clinic for him to show and Holmes joins her. She admits that Liam was simply an ex, not an ex client. She guesses that he isn't going to show. Holmes says he will wait with her."

We see four masked thieves break into a high tech vault and steal lots and lots of shiny jewelry.

This leads directly to Sherlock getting a visit-- just as he's saying goodbye to two comely sisters-- from the head of the company that made the vault-- called the Leviathan. He is desperate to figure out how it was cracked. Not only is the diamond company that was robbed down $40 million but if word gets out that the safe company's most famous safe has been cracked, again, then their reputation will go down the toilet. He's heard Sherlock might be able to help.

While Sherlock heads down to check out the vault, Watson goes to meet her mom or brunch. Sherlock notes that she looks like she's heading off to a job interview not meet someone she loves. We soon learn that, although Joan probably loves her mother, that mom is maybe not super psyched that her daughter stopped being a doctor and started being a ""babysitter"" to drug addicts. We learn that Joan's brother Oren will be in town the next night for dinner and that they should all get together because he's finally going to introduce them to his girlfriend.

Sherlock is at the vault running through a million ideas, noting all the safety gizmos, cameras, and redundancies and it's driving him mad as he talks to the vault guy and meets the diamond company lackey, a man whose surname means ""green stick"" in French. Sherlock is so mad with deduction that Watson comes down to get him pointing out he's been there all day and that this kind of obsessive behavior is very much like a dry drunk. He stays a little longer, until she actually falls asleep. He's stuck on the idea that the computer programmed passcode was updated every two minutes randomly and the person who had the fob with the passcode was unreachable in Gstaad. He eventually gets so frustrated he just grabs an axe and smashes the glass displaying the code above the keypad.

They decide to try to speak to one of the original crew who cracked the Leviathan under the reasoning that the only way it could be cracked was by this crew selling their secret. The mastermind behind the plan died in prison but one member of the crew says he heard he did sell the secret to a man called Le Chevalier. Apparently, he was a wily master thief who stole priceless things that would be unsellable on the black market. Sherlock makes short work of finding the man. Unfortunately, he's not their guy since he recently had a stroke and can't walk. They do find his booty, however, and return it to Capt. Gregson. (All but one famous Van Gogh painting that Sherlock wants to keep for just a little while.)

Joan heads off to dinner with her family to discover Sherlock is already there. He charms the pants off everyone and explains how instrumental Joan has been in not only helping with his sobriety but solving crime and saving his life and Joan's mother sees that her new job is important. Later when Joan thanks Sherlock he waves it off saying Joan's family is conventional and he knew what to do to impress them on her behalf and that she is unconventional. It's the closest he's gotten to saying how much he appreciates her.

Sherlock realizes that one of the original thieves didn't settle so there was a court case. He reads the transcripts and sets his sights on the jury. Four members of the jury match up with the skills of the original four man robbery crew. One of them is related to the Green Stick man from the diamond company. When one of the new quartet turns up dead, Sherlock deduces the diamonds were at his house in a decorative glass container and that one of his crew mates killed him out of greed. Another turns up dead.

They call in the whole jury from the original case to get DNA. The two living members of the crew who do one seems reluctant at first to give them the swab but does eventually. But then there is no DNA match and they're perplexed. Until they find out he was a bone marrow recipient, which can change the recipients DNA make-up vis a vis a saliva sample but not a blood sample. When he balks at giving a blood sample, Sherlock lays it out and gets his man.

Later Joan's mom shows up to apologize and be nice to Joan and say she saw a spark in her eyes when she talked about working with Sherlock and hints that she should stay with him and help him.

Sherlock returns the painting."

A woman's dead body is found clunking around in an industrial washing machine in a large hotel. It turns out she was the manager, Teri Purcell, and was universally loved by her employees and a fine humanitarian.

Sherlock, Watson and Bell go to have a chat with her husband (Mark Moses), which turns up nothing more than the fact that there was obviously some marital discord since Sherlock notes that he was sleeping on the couch. Watson also deduces that the dead woman's daughter, Carly, although now a promising athlete and scholar once had a drug problem. She gives Carly her number and tells her to call if she needs her.

A nosy neighbor points them in the direction of a man who dropped by to visit Teri all the time, Jeffrey Silver (Jake Weber). He is a businessman who runs an international charity dedicated to the eradication of land mines. Nothing untoward was going on it turns out, she was just helping with his chartiy. He also has an alibi. So the husband and potential lover are out as suspects.

When they learn that Teri had run afoul of some call girls who frequented the hotel Watson and Holmes go ""whore-fishing"" in the lobby and get one escort to talk. It turns out, however, that instead of running them off Teri was helping them hook up with high rolling hotel guests and monkeying with security cameras to cover for them. (Thus there was no security footage of who killed her.)

They wonder why she would do this out of the goodness of her heart and go to investigate her office for secret compartments. They find one and in it evidence that leads to a secret cache of videos of hotel rooms. At first they think she was allowing the hookers to meet with patrons in order to blackmail them but then when Sherlock overhears two French men he realizes that Teri wasn't a madam or a blackmailer: she was a deep cover Russian spy who used the hooker to lure in international diplomats and then record their conversations, not their sex lives.

It turns out her husband was also a spy so they pick him up. He rolls over fairly quickly and says the international land mine guy was their handler. It turns out that he and Teri only conceived because they were told to and were not in love, but they did love their daughter. Unfortunately, Teri wanted Carly to follow into the spy life, which Carly confessed to Watson when she called for help. But since this whole ""you're actually a Russian spy"" thing was news to Carly they fought about it. Carly pushed her mom and believed she killed her. But it turns out that when Jeffrey showed up to clean up the mess, Teri was still alive, so he finished her off thinking it would be better to be rid of her and mold Carly-- a U.S. citizen-- into a model spy. Carly and her dad go into the witness protection program and Jeffrey is on the hook for the murder so he won't, as he thought, be getting traded back to mother Russia. . Throughout the episode Sherlock ribbed Watson about her staying on, first saying that she clearly enjoys his work and that they should engage in a weekly salon where she helps him in exchange for light housework. Then he talks about fooling his dad into continuing to pay her. But in the end, even though she does enjoy working with him, she informs him she has gotten another job."

Holmes and Watson talk about the fact the end of her work with him is at and end. She is working on a final assessment for his father.

Gregson brings Holmes and Watson to a crime scene. It is the home of a CPA named Vickers. There is no body, just an enormous pool of the man's blood. Holmes analyzes the scene with typical precision, then tells Watson he's followed this particular madman in London.

Holmes tells the police department the person they are looking for is called ""M."" He says M is the most ""sinister taker of lives"" he's chased. M has killed almost 40 people in the past decade. He has not been photographed and has no profile. He drains his victims and dumps their bodies in the ocean. M kills in bunches.

Watson asks Holmes why he seems to be so chipper. He tells her this is a second chance for him to bring a ruthless killer to justice. Holmes tells Gregson that M has referenced him in a letter or two, so a protection detail is provided. Holmes tells Watson he needs to get used to working by himself and will keep her updated via email.

Watson assures her therapist she has no interest in becoming an investigator.

We see M unemotionally part ways with a hooker. Afterwards he gets a text in some sort of code and begins working on a letter.

Holmes and Watson analyze Vickers' body, which has finally washed up. Based on the oil in his hair Watson guesses he was dumped near the navy yard. She tells Holmes she going to miss ""this. Working with you.""

Holmes and Watson return home to find a letter from M on the table. It is M's usual rambling nonsense, telling Holmes he is a ""mouse chasing a lion."" M got by the police by picking the lock on the back door. Watson isn't worried about M trying to hurt him. Holmes says she's going to stay there. Holmes is looking at one of his father's properties online, telling Watson he's thinking of moving. After Watson goes upstairs Holmes grabs a hidden camera and pulls up an image of M leaving the note.

We see M watching a woman going into her apartment building. A young kid tries to sell him some things by M pushes him away, eventually breaking the kid's phone.

While Watson works on her final assessment there is a knock on the door. It's an officer with the kid from the previous scene. The kid, Teddy, is a friend of Holmes and was instructed along with some of his friends to hang out near certain hotels looking for M. If he found him, Holmes was going to pay him several hundred bucks. Teddy shows her a copy of the picture of M from the surveillance camera.

Holmes arrives home later to find a very angry Watson. She's pissed about all the hidden cameras in the home. He explains to her how he figured out M would be at a certain chain of high-end expensive hotels. It has to do with his footwear and the shampoo he smelled on the letter, among other things. Holmes then teller her has no intention of going to police. M killed Irene Adler, the only woman Holmes ever loved. This led to Holmes slipping into drug addiction. Holmes plans to catch M, torture him and kill him. Holmes wants revenge and has been dreaming of this moment for quite some time.

Holmes meets Teddy and gets more information about M.

M grabs the woman he'd been watching earlier.

Watson goes to Gregson and tells him and tells him about Holmes' plan. She thinks it's possible Holmes may already have M.

We see Holmes sneak up on M and knock him out with a baton. Holmes takes M to a remote location and ties him up. Holmes makes it very clear what he's going to do. Holmes tells him about Irene and M initially doesn't seems to remember. M then recalls that there were a few copycat murders which took place while he was in prison for a fight. M, who served in the military, doesn't seem scared. Holmes doesn't believe his story and starts working on M.

Gregson and Watson interview M's recent near-victim. Holmes let her go as long as she didn't turn around. Based on the fact she saw powder on Holmes' shoes Watson thinks she knows which of Holmes' father's properties he may have taken M.

A bloodied M tells Holmes he's not a serial killer. He's an assassin who has been paid by an employer for all of his murders. He's never met his employer and occasionally receives coded messages. He says his name is Sebastian and tells Holmes to look up his case. He couldn't have killed Irene. Sebastian is furious that his employer played him for a fool.

Watson and Gregson close in on Holmes' location.

Sebastian wants to get even with his employer, someone called Moriarty. Sebastian assures Holmes he couldn't have killed his girlfriend. He tells Holmes that if he kills him he'll lose the best clue to find Moriarty. Holmes assures him that his is not an average man and sticks a knife in his stomach.

Police arrive and find the place empty. Holmes apparently walked into the station with a very much alive Sebastian

In questioning Sebastian tells police that he led Holmes to where they were and that his injuries were committed by Holmes in self-defense.

Watson tells Holmes Sebastian has confessed to all of the murders but wouldn't give him up. Holmes tells her Sebastian didn't kill Irene. He apologizes for lying to her. Holmes tells her ""I'm going to miss this"" and apologizes their last few days went so poorly. After he leaves she places a call to Holmes father, saying she'd like to stay on a little bit longer.

Later we see her get an email from Holmes' father. He doesn't wish to keep her on any longer. But Watson lies to Holmes, telling him his father agreed to have her continue the work.

The episode ends with Holmes staring at a wall. In the middle is a piece of paper with one word: ""MORIARTY."""

We are back and looking at Sherlock's corkboard dedicated to the mysterious ""Moriarty,"" the true murderer of Irene, which Watson calls his ""wall of crazy."" He has slept for two days straight. So he's hungry and excited to go play with some conspiracy theorists. He loves them like one would love a ""barmy uncle."" He claims to have ""started"" the ""CIA created crack cocaine.""

Watson goes to see her therapist who points out that Watson's contract with Holmes expired a week ago and if he finds out, it could destroy their trust and cause him to relapse. Also, even if she doesn't ""need"" the money she is not obligated to spend her savings on saving him, points out her therapist. She says she's just going to stay long enough to re-establish Sherlock's relationship with Captain Gregson, who suspended him after the Moran business.

Unfortunately, one of the conspiracy theorists turns up dead, hanged, with his pants down in his very stylish home.

Det. Bell arrives and calls it auto-erotic asphyxiation. Sherlock thinks he was hanged by a larger person and lays out his case: larger belt than the man, broken finger, which would interfere with um the ""auto"" part. Bell tries to oust Sherlock but Sherlock won't let him, bullying his way back into a consultancy by grabbing evidence so the police will come to him.

In the turtle habitat he finds a bug, someone was bugging the conspiracy nut. It was government issue. There was also spyware on his laptop. Sherlock says most of his ideas were insane but in one case he might have been on to something: ""The Red Team,"" relating to war games run by the government. The results are usually published but in 2009 they were classified. No one knows why. That year's game was designed to simulate a response to the activation of a sleeper cell in NYC. The goal of the Red Team (the ""bad guys"") was maximum destruction with minimum resources. The dead theorist believed the government found a flaw in our homeland security and that they killed a member of the Red Team. Sherlock figures if he can find other members of the Red Team he can test his theory that the theorist was on to something.

Watson goes to plead on Sherlock's behalf with Gregson, who is unsympathetic. Gregson calls him broken and that is unrelated to his old addiction.

Sherlock tracks down another Team member, a man now in long term care who can't remember anything but was once a brilliant man. His mind oddly deteriorated in a matter of weeks, with no family history of Alzheimer's. They talk to him. Sherlock thinks he's been poisoned to mimic Alzheimer's saying murder is just one way to stop someone from talking. They want to test him.

But when he calls Bell, he reports they arrested someone, another conspiracy theorist who turned himself in.

Sherlock goes to talk to the theorist, who is clearly nutty. Gregson is mad that Sherlock is there. He doesn't want to listen to his theory and blows him off and tells him if he talks his way again, he'll arrest him for trespassing. He, of course, wants to keep investigating.

They trace the bug back to the source by waiting for the source to show up and take his bugs back from the dead theorist's house. As they stakeout Watson tells him he should apologize to Gregson. He says Gregson would know he was faking. He points out, again, how he's smarter than everyone and it makes no sense to suspend him since his help is for the greater good.

They follow the bugger back to a highly secure building. Holmes gets them in by waving the bugs from the dead theorist's house in front of one of the cameras. The man who greets them claims they do market research. Sherlock explains, honestly, who they are to ""Bill."" He tries to be explicit about the Red Team and Bill feigns his ignorance. He also asks if someone wanted to take those people out from 2009 why wouldn't they kill them all at once? Sherlock was testing him by saying the names and he got clues about which ones were actually on the team.

Bell calls and tells him that the man in long-term care was in fact poisoned.

Sherlock brings in another member named Walter McClennan, who seems a little shaky. He brings him into a room with other members of the Red Team. He explains about the other members of the team who are dead and incapacitated and says he thinks they are in danger. They seem nervous. He asks if he knows might be after them. They argue that if any of them talk it will be treason. They all leave but the female member of the team throws a piece of paper in the trash. Sherlock retrieves it, she has written a code name ""Yossarian.""

Sherlock does some digging and thinks that maybe ""Bill"" is Yossarian, an Army Intelligence liaison during the war games.

His doorbell rings and some Feds are asking about ""Bill,"" who was shot and killed earlier that evening. They take him away for interrogation. He lays out his theory about Yossarian. They want to take him away for more questioning but he points out he has an alibi provided by the surveillance cameras in his house, the footage of which Watson brings to them. He wanted them to interrogate him so he could counter-interrogate them. He figures now it's not Army Intelligence killing the Red Team members. Holmes calls the police to take the other members into protective custody.

The police arrive at one place where the door is rigged with a booby trap gun. (Only filled with rock salt.) Gregson and Bell investigate the home and it's full of weapons.

Sherlock goes to see one of the members, an older man, resistant to leave his home where he is caring for his wife who has ALS. They report that Walter is now a suspect in the Red Team murders. The man was friendly with Walter and isn't surprised that Walter might be a suspect. He says the plan they came up with in dealing with what happened in '09 was disturbing and it changed them all. Walter was convinced someone was going to sell their secret. He joked he might do it. If he killed the Red Team members the price for their secret would go up.

Then, McLenahan turns up dead. Shot in the head in an alley.

Sherlock is worried that another Red Team member might be the murderer and... it's revealed that it's the older man they were just talking to. He takes out their NYPD minder at a motel and goes to shoot yet another member of the team and the cops stop him. He runs back into his room and holds a cop hostage. Sherlock wants to talk to him and promises he'll get Gregson's man out safely.

Sherlock talks his way in. He goes to the minibar first to get a drink before he starts talking to the man. He figures the man is not interested in profit he just wants to off the other members to keep their secret safe so NYC is safe. He wonders why he waited until two years after the war games to start killing people. It was two years ago his wife was diagnosed with ALS. He realized when he was approached by someone who claimed to be able to help his wife and he actually considered it, that each team member must have a price or Achilles heel. The man congratulates Sherlock on figuring out his plan. Now he plans to shoot Sherlock to gain leverage. Sherlock says he worked out the plan and he told a colleague and wrote it down. The man says if Sherlock's telling the truth, that's ""checkmate."" He asks him what the plan is and levels the gun at him.

The next thing we see is Sherlock and the man walking out of the room. Gregson asks how he did it. He says he told him he knew the Red Team's plan. He guessed saying that with a gun to his head it was motivating.

He says he and Gregson need to talk. Gregson says to meet him at a bar. Sherlock meets him and says he regrets that circumstances endangered their relationship. Gregson asks who the hell he is and that he doesn't let anyone in his life that isn't always concerned about him. He says most of the time he's worth it because he is special but if he wants to work cases he's right, Gregson can't say no, but he shouldn't ever forget that he knows Sherlock was going to murder someone on his watch and he will never really trust him again. Sherlock says he doesn't need to trust him to benefit from his intellect. Gregson agrees but says he does have to get something out of his system and then he slugs him in the stomach.

At home, Holmes tells Watson he's been reinstated. He's morose about it. He doesn't tell her what happened."

Sherlock is enjoying a floor show in his house by two scantily clad chicks who are enjoying each other and then him, as they handcuff him to a chair and kiss on him. And then they stop kissing him and start robbing him. It was a set up for the cops who bust the women. Sherlock asks to keep the handcuffs.

The next day he practices whacking a dummy with a ""single stick.""

Watson announces she needs to go to her apartment to check on her subletters. He is confused by this. She calls it her sanctum sanctorum, which she sublets when she has a job. She chats with her landlord about her whistling radiator when she comes home. He tells her he saw a porno film that was shot in her apartment. It turns out that her subletters were in fact making a porno movie in her apartment. Her landlord says he's evicting her because of it. Watson confronts her subletter and he says he needed the money to pay the rent since his serious ""documentary filmmaking"" wasn't drawing any interest.

We see a patient arrive at a hospital, Mr. Ennis. He is there to donate a kidney to his sister, whom he won't be allowed to see. He is anesthetized for the surgery and then the police remove his cuffs. But he was just faking and he grabs a scalpel and attacks everyone in the OR, kills the guards, doctors, and nurse and skedaddles before the surgery is performed.

Turns out he was a serial killer, who flayed his victims. Capt. Gregson, Sherlock, and Watson go to see the carnage in the OR. Sherlock figures out what he did with the anesthesia and the fake out. He wrote a message in blood on the door: Shedir. It's a name for the star Cassiopeia.

Since Ennis was a serial killer, the profiler who helped put him away, Katherine Drummond, returns to run point for the case. She wrote a book about Ennis in which she theorized that he was sexually abused by his parents. She was sued for libel but it was thrown out of court. Sherlock worked with her in London when a U.S. serial killer crossed the pond. He calls her a buffoon and a snake oil salesman like all profilers. Katherine comes over to say hello and gloat about Sherlock's ""troubles.""

His sick sister, who needed the kidney transplant, feels terrible that it was she that sprung him. She says they were not in touch otherwise. She says she's glad that Katherine is helping since she helped catch Ennis the first time.

Sherlock looks at a model of Cassieopeia and it seems like Ennis' victims are chosen based on a pattern in it. Watson thinks it's great he discerned this but Sherlock thinks it's a red herring on Ennis' part to watch the cops scramble. He also confesses to Watson that he slept with Katherine Drummond as an FWB, which Watson now thinks explains the frostiness between them.Turns out she agrees with him about the red herring.

Ennis grabs another young woman, as well as killing several people in a convenience store. He has her take his picture as he is holding up a newspaper with his face on the front page. He then leaves the woman alive and leaves the store. Sherlock can't figure out the message that Ennis is leaving by these actions.

Watson finds out why Sherlock really hates Katherine. She profiled him. She never used his name but in a pyschiatric journal she referred to him as ""the deductionist."" She betrayed him. Even worse she predicted his struggles with addiction and also predicted that he would come to a bad end.

Gregson expresses his frustration with Katherine about her not being of much help as a profiler. Watson says maybe the confusion is the point. Ennis then calls the station. Gregson chats with him and he addresses Katherine. Sherlock deduces that Ennis hates her because she ""solved"" him and ""demystified"" him and now he's going to violate her profile of him. Ennis is impressed by this and knows that he's ""the Deductionist."" (He says he read everything Katherine wrote.) He says he wants to ruin her because she ruined his family and he says his father was a good man who didn't abuse him. His father killed himself and his mother died shortly thereafter. He tells Gregson that it would be easy to stop, he just wants Katherine. Sherlock thinks this is reasonable.

Sherlock confronts Katherine about her claims of sexual abuse in the Ennis family. He wonders if she truly cut corners and just made it up. He chats with Watson about it, who reassures him that Katherine's profile of him didn't all come true. She then notices that he's watching the porn made in her house. He of course isn't trying to get off he's just obsessed with the continuity errors in it. Watson then notices one of her own.

Watson and Holmes meet with Gregson on a false tip that Ennis broke into his sister's house. Watson and Holmes discover that her house is ripe with things that are the exact opposite of what a person with kidney problems should be consuming. She was sabotaging herself. It turns out that she was in cahoots with her brother. She was also angry about the death of her parents in the wake of Katherine's book. He convinced her to poision herself so he could go free during the kidney transplant and take Katherine down. Katherine goes to her and apologizes for making the abuse allegations in her book and the sister attacks her with scissors. She survives and the sister is arrested.

But then Ennis calls Gregson again. He tries to cover his tracks by fidding with a radio dial while he talks to Gregson. But Holmes tracks him down thanks to discerning the overlap between two stations that Ennis dialed by while he called Gregson. Ennis recognizes him as ""The Deductionist."" Holmes has laid out a gun and a set of handcuffs. He says if he goes for the handcuffs he'll be the coward profiled by Katherine. But if he goes for the gun he'll go against the profile. He warns that if he goes for the gun, Sherlock will go for him. Ennis goes for the gun and Sherlock beats him down with his ""single stick,"" disarming him. The cops take him in.

After watching the porn and seeing a continuity error: in some scenes her radiator had electrical tape on it, in some it didn't. So Watson deduces that her landlord was there the whole time so he knew what was going on and he used as an opportunity to claim she violated her lease and so he can evict her from her rent-controlled apartment and charge market price for the rent. She points out that he participated in filming of an unlicensed production.

It's a ""delivery guy"" who wants to charge his phone. It's clearly a scam and she tries to blow him off. Coincidentally, as that guy walks away, another guy in a hoodie emerges from hiding, drugs her and drags her body into the kitchen. He then apparently puts her in a suitcase and wheels her away. We see the first guy thanking a cab driver for letting him charge his phone with his charger in the cab.

Sherlock shares in a group about a crime, going on and on at length about a mongoose, and the group is clearly not amused. Watson points out that it was first share and it had nothing to do with addiction. He claims as a people person he wanted to cheer up the group.

A man walks out of their shower, naked. He's Rhys (John Hannah). He let himself in. He informs Sherlock that Emily has been kidnapped. Turns out Rhys is Sherlock's former drug dealer -- he's British or from his accent Scottish-- and Emily is his daughter who lives in New York. He has been sent a video ransom note and wants Sherlock to help. Watson would like him to put clothes on.

Watson worries Rhys is a trigger. Sherlock says he is but points out that Rhys is no longer a drug dealer and he needs his help.

Rhys shows Sherlock the video of his daughter bound and gagged. The kidnapper wants 2.2 million dollars and he has four days to get it to him or she dies, no police. Rhys had stolen that amount from Dominican drug dealers and went into hiding. He didn't know anyone knew about his daughter. And she didn't know about the thievery. He only has two thousand dollars left. He's a gambler. Sherlock says they have 44 hours left and that's twice what he needs so they should be good.

They go to his daughter's house. A picture shows the girl's mother, who died a few years back. Watson is impressed with Rhys' sense of calm. He says he believes in Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock deduces how the kidnapping went down. He finds a trace of a hand stamp from a Dominican nightclub.

They go there to find clues. Rhys looks for any familiar faces. He spots a guy in the VIP section who is one of the U.K. suppliers. Sherlock follows a guy into the bathroom. He compliments his tats and then asks about the kidnapping. He makes him as an undercover DEA agent and asks for his help and threatens to out him to the legitimate cartel members. The guy slugs him and claims the guy tried to steal his wallet. As he beats him up he explains that the cartel isn't behind the kidnapping. He apologizes for having to do it this way and drops him to the floor.

The next day Sherlock reads Emily's Twitter feed. He's given up on the cartel but still thinks the abductor was in the club. Watson says he has to go to another meeting.

She goes upstairs and finds Rhys having smoked pot in the bathroom and admonishes him sternly and makes him hand over his weed. He does so reluctantly. Watson flushes it down the toilet.

Sherlock finds a tweet regarding her stepdad Derek, who asked her for money. He's broke and working as a parking attendant thanks to the crash, intel courtesy of Det. Bell, whom Sherlock tells nothing. They stake out the guy at his valet job. Rhys commends Sherlock on his sobriety and how well he's doing his job without it. He wonders if maybe the drugs helped him.

They follow Derek after he gets off work. He goes to one of the buildings he owned, with groceries. Sherlock thinks maybe Derek kidnapped his own stepdaughter. They go in and look for her. It turns out Derek is just squatting; he didn't know about Emily's kidnapping. He says he raised her and would never hurt her and she only helped him out in a pinch. They leave him alone since Sherlock said he reeked of innocence.

The kidnapper calls Rhys and wants to know whom he's working with. Sherlock assures him he's not a cop. Regardless the kidnapper has left them a package, Emily's finger. He says he has also shortened the deadline by six hours. Sherlock examines it and confirms it was hers. And thinks it holds clues to her location. It has a distinctive burn from a radiator in a pre-war building. He also finds remnants of food under the fingernail and thinks he can deduce where it came from and cross-reference the building.

Watson brings Rhys some tea (and sympathy.) He is, understandably, freaked out at seeing his daughter's severed finger. She thinks Sherlock needs a little more time. You can tell he wishes Sherlock would shoot up and have an epiphany.

Sherlock rewatches the ransom video since the restaurant idea didn't work out, too many of them. Rhys advances his theory that cocaine helped with a case in the past, intimating that could work now. He went and got some cocaine. And gives it to him and asks him to do it ""for Emily."" Sherlock throws him to the ground and screams in his face. Rhys says he needs his ""meds"" and says he's begging him. Watson comes down and Sherlock flees.

Later, sitting on a park bench Sherlock calls his father.

Later still, he returns home and says Rhys will be reunited with Emily within the hour. He reached out to his father for a loan. His father wants him to perform 'errands' in return. He tells Rhys he got the money less to save Emily than to rid himself of Rhys and they are never to speak again after this.

Sherlock goes to meet the kidnapper.

Meanwhile the DEA agent who beat him down comes ot Sherlock's house and says he has information about hte girl.

Sherlock runs from a group of people dressed as painters. It was an ambush. He breaks into a house to escape and calls Watson and says there is only one person who knew he was investigating the case. Watson turns and we see the DEA agent has pulled a gun on her and Rhys. He ties them up. He tells Sherlock his friends are safe.

They chat while Sherlock hotwires a car. Sherlock figured out that the DEA agent heard about Rhys when he went undercover and how the Dominican cartel couldn't find him or the money he stole. With the help of old Uncle Sam, he tracked down Rhys and planned the kidnapping to get the money. Basically: dirty cop.

Rhys manages to get himself and Watson loose from their cuffs with a pocket knife. They try to run but the agent shoots him. As they struggle Watson knocks him out.

At the police station the agent claims he has no idea who Emily is and that he became aware of Rhys while undercover and claimed he followed him to Sherlock's house and he attacked him and had to restrain Watson who he assumed was working with Rhys. Gregson says he talked to Sherlock, and if Rhys pulls through he wonders whom they should believe; the agent says he doesn't care what a known drug dealer has to say. They tell him if he tells where the girl is the DA will make sure he gets protective custody. He says he can't help. They bust him on the take out food/pre-war building connection. They are searching the buildings and say he better give it up before they find her on their own. He finally gives it up.

Sherlock goes to the hospital and leaves an envelope for Rhys. He wakes up. Sherlock tells him that Emily is safe. The envelope is full of cash so Rhys can leave. Sherlock's own, not his dad's, which he returned. Rhys again says he believes in Sherlock and always will. Emily comes in and hugs him.

Sherlock sets about gluing together the bust Watson used to brain the DEA agent. He tells her she did a remarkable thing. He admits Rhys offered him cocaine and explains the drugs/epiphany theory. He didn't use it. He thinks he wants to share the story at a group meeting, they go. She is impressed and unsettled by this and they go to the meeting."

On his way home, Bell calls Gregson and then is suddenly shot at and run off the road. He believes it was a drug dealer he put away named Bradshaw who just got out of prison. Although he was very hands off when working the streets he promised Bell he would come after personally and it was Bradshaw's car that contained the shooter.

Simultaneously, Bell is looking after his brother Andre who was also just released from prison. They have a rocky relationship and have since they were young and Bell went the straight and narrow route and Andre chose the thug life. But now he's out and eager to help his brother find out who shot at him even if it means violating his parole and consorting with criminals.

But then Bradshaw turns up dead and Bell is worried his brother did it for him. But when the murder weapon turns up in his house-- uncovered by Sherlock and concealed from Gregson-- it's clear he's being framed. Then Bell is worried his brother did it to frame him out of resentment. His brother is offended him and clocks him right in the middle of the precinct.

But later when Andre himself is shot-- and manages to write ""was not Marcus"" in blood before he passes out--they know it wasn't he.

It is at this point that Sherlock realizes they have been barking up the wrong tree all along, looking for criminals when they should've been looking a little closer to home.

Bell, it turns out, informed on a superior who planted evidence to take Bradshaw down. No one likes an Internal Affairs snitch-- even when they're doing the right thing as Bell did-- and when one of the people who worked with that superior and also had an affair with Bell, found out that he was the one, she went on a one woman mission to take him down. Sherlock gets her to confess. Andre and Marcus make up in the hospital.

Meanwhile, this whole time Sherlock keeps testing Watson with out-of-nowhere attacks to prove that she needs to take self defense courses in light of her recent violent encounter.

While her therapist thinks it's time to move on from this ""grand adventure,"" it's clear that Watson doesn't want to.

Watson talks to him about boundaries. He then blurts out that he knows that she lied to him about renewing her contract with his father. He's not angry, but grateful she stayed to see him through his rough patch. But then he realized she wasn't staying for him but herself. So he asks her to consider a proposal: stay on permanently as his companion and he will continue to teach her and she will continue to assist him and she will receive a stipend that is equal what his father was paying and she can live at brownstone, relieved of the confidentiality agreement about his sobriety. He asks her, essentially, to be his partner. He admits that he is better with her: sharper, more focused, and it's difficult to say why exactly but perhaps in time he'll solve that as well.

Watson agrees, telling him she likes to be paid on Thursdays, she will stay at the Brownstone, and that they will still go to group support meetings."

Since Sherlock has been mentoring Watson about detective work he gives her a crack at it. She does the best she can but is wrong and Sherlock explains how. He tells her not to let failure discourage her since deduction is not just a skill it's a point of view.

They are approached by a limo driver named Crabtree. He works for Gerald Lydon, a muckety muck rich dude who owns 18 patents. They go for a ride with him and his assistant/nurse. He explains that he has dementia due to a rare genetic disorder, CAA, that will eventually kill him. He strongly believes he was given the disease by someone and therefore it's murder. He asks Sherlock to take his case. Sherlock expresses his condolences about his condition but since it's hereditary Sherlock refuses.

Later Crabtree delivers a bee in a box. It is a rare, nearly extinct variety and meant as a bribe from Lydon. While Sherlock is intrigued he declines convincing Crabtree Sherlock is a man of conviction. Not that this conviction helps much since Lydon then shoots Crabtree. When Gregson and Bell arrive, Lydon calls for Sherlock and again asks for help. This time Sherlock agrees...and takes the bee.

Sherlock and Watson go to a genetics lab to confirm his diagnosis and meet Natasha Kadmon, who wrote her dissertation on ""warrior gene"" i.e. the ""sociopath gene."" She knows Lydon thinks he was given the disease. She says that maybe there are seven people who might be able to crack the ability to give it to someone.

Sherlock and Watson set some ground rules on chores and he sends her to a dry cleaners and agrees to clean the fridge.

While they research geneticists crafty enough to give someone a hereditary disease, they get a text from a blocked number with a picture of a molecule and a note saying they are onto something. They realize it's Natasha and set up a meeting. When they arrive, she is dead. Stabbed to death.

Sherlock thinks it's related to Lydon but Natasha's fiance, also a geneticist, arrives and points a finger at a recently released convict named Benny Cordero, a man who claims she used his blood without permission in a study. He thought signing up would win him brownie points with the parole board but when she discovered he had the sociopath gene it wasn't really useful. Sherlock insists that Benny is innocent.

Watson finally goes to the dry cleaners and is served by an angry Polish woman working there who doesn't know what to charge and doesn't want to give her a receipt.

Sherlock and Watson go see Lydon's sons, people who stand to gain from their father's death and each give a DNA sample.

Cordero's blood is a match to Natasha's crime scene but he says it's not possible because he was busy taking blackmail pictures of his neighbor and his nanny.

Watson goes back to the dry cleaners and starts picking up weird clues that something is amiss, including very expensive security cameras. She realizes Sherlock wanted her to notice these things and solve the puzzle.

After they run a DNA test on Cordero and it matches, Watson and Holmes realize that someone, likely a very skilled geneticist, was able to fake a DNA sample. Turns out that her fiance killed her. After they were engaged she discovered that he himself had the sociopath gene and started pulling away from him so he killed her and faked the DNA sample. (Thereby sort of proving the point about the gene.)

He thought she was cheating on him with someone named Lincoln Dunwoody but it turns out that she wasn't. Lincoln and Dunwoody were two separate people, wealthy philanthropists who also mysteriously came down with the same rare disease Lydon had even though they had no family history of the disease either. It turns out Natasha was a whistle blower. She realized someone was poisoning wealthy people with the disease so they would give money to research for its cure. The culprit? Her boss at the genetics lab who, no surprise has the disease himself.

Watson goes back to the dry cleaner with Bell, having figured out that they were fronting a money laundering scheme, and has the angry woman and her enforcer arrested. Sherlock congratulates her on a detective job well done."

An onscreen title card informs us that it's six months ago.

We see a woman spontaneously receive roses on a subway platform from a man who claims his girlfriend canceled their date. Then he pushes her in front of a train.

That night we see Joan out with friends saying she loves her new job as a sober companion and then she gets a call for a new client and she wonders what kind of name is Sherlock.

We cut to today and Joan is busting into a fancy car. When she can't shut off the alarm we see she's in the car with Sherlock's sponsor the former car thief turned security man. He's teaching her tools of the trade to help out Sherlock.

She heads home and learns Sherlock's dad is asking for his investigative help in return for the money he loaned him recently to pay off his old friend's kidnapper.

They head off to an office, with bulletproof glass, to meet with a ""shyster"" attorney that his father wants him to help. It turns out it's the shyster's assistant Rebecca who wants help. Her sister Kelly is missing.

She shows them a video of Kelly breaking up with her husband via video and saying she's going to go away for a little while. She was inspired by the woman pushed in front of the train, saying life was too short to spend it with someone she didn't love. Kelly went missing a lot as she was a fragile soul so her sister wasn't concerned at first. But then after weeks in which Kelly didn't use her credit cards they got nervous, thinking her husband forced her into making the video in order to kill her since they had a troubled relationship. There's also a missing trunk, one that would fit a body, thinks Rebecca.

Sherlock disagrees that the video is fake and that Kelly wasn't under duress. Sherlock wants Joan to take this one solo and would be a good case since she clearly wanted to leave her husband. Sherlock decides he wants to go after the subway pusher instead. Sherlock leaves it to her to tell her father's friend that she's taking the case, not Sherlock.

Sherlock looks at video of the subway pusher and starts to investigate. As does Watson. Neither have much to begin with.

Joan gets a call from one of her old friends who she accidentally blew off for drinks. They make a new date.

Joan goes to speak to Kelly's husband. He says she was a complicated person. She had left him briefly before and that time she called him and she came back. Joan asks about their problems. He isn't sure, he was blindsided the first time. The second time she seemed distant and depressed over the subway murder. He swears again that Kelly took the trunk. He says he wants her to come back, not because they can be together since he knows they can't, but just to know that she's okay and to let her know that he wants her to be happy. Afterwards, Joan calls Sherlock and agrees that the husband might have killed her. Later she plays audio of an interview from the police in which he said the same thing verbatim. She thinks it feels rehearsed. She also just didn't like something about him. Sherlock asks if she wants him to tag in and she says not yet. She does ask what his next step would be. He asks for the man's phone number and thinks they should gaslight him. Sherlock texts from an anonymous burner phone that he knows he killed his wife and what he did with the body. He tells Joan to watch him now.

He goes to the police station to interview a suspect in his case. A man who worked in the same office as the woman pushed in front of the train. A janitor. Sherlock watched footage of that subway platform in earlier days and saw this man following the woman and taking surreptitious video of her. He has previous stalking priors. Capt. Gregson tags in and they pressure him. The guy admits her was there and was in disguise but swears he didn't kill her. He said he wore a hat and a scarf not the hoodie of the killer. It turns out he was recording that night and has proof he didn't push her.

Watson calls Sherlock from her stakeout and the husband hasn't reacted to the text at all. Alfredo comes to take over the stakeout because he remembered she made plans with her friend. She forgot again.

Sherlock notices a busker on the platform who stops midsong and takes off. He theorizes the busker knew the pusher.

Joan meets her friend and her other friends are there and they're a little surprised that she's working as a detective and were worried since she has fallen out of touch. They wanted to express a concern intervention-style. They say she seems lost. They're surprised that she quit her job, moved in with a recovering drug addict former client, and are worried about her. It's kind of insulting actually but she doesn't really explain it either and she takes off because Alfredo texts her that the husband is on the move.

They follow him and Joan sees him taking the infamous trunk out of storage. Joan goes to investigate his car and the trunk while the man goes back inside. She gets busted by the security guard. She blurts out that the man killed his wife and she could be in the trunk. The guard asks him to open it up saying if he has nothing to hide it doesn't matter. The cops arrive. He opens the trunk. It's empty.

Joan ends up in jail. Sherlock bails her out. He says the husband told the cops that he sold the trunk out of spite and he needed the money. So he bought it back to give it to Kelly's sister. He commends her instincts and although she was wrong about the trunk it doesn't mean she was wrong about the man being a murderer. Sherlock proposes they team up on both their cases.

Sherlock and Bell go to see the busker. He claims he knows nothing about the subway pusher. Sherlock leans on him. He says he just knew the guy's face, they had a previous altercation and he was afraid the guy would retaliate. Sherlock asks about a patch on the pusher's jacket. He IDs it and they want to show it to the public.

Gregson tells Joan that the husband will drop the charges if Joan will apologize and pay for the damages. Sherlock tells her not to apologize. She says she's not like him and admits the confrontation with her friends. She goes to apologize to the husband. And then she goes to see Rebecca, Kelly's sister to say she's going off the case. But then notices a picture of Kelly in a jacket with the pusher's patch on it. It turns out the jacket was her husband's.

Sherlock and Joan go over the the links between the cases including that Drew was the subway pusher. They wonder why? And why it affected his wife so much that she would leave him if she didn't know it was him? He prods Joan to stay with the case and not wallow in self-doubt.

They bring the husband back in, now on the subway pushing charge. He claims he gave the jacket to Goodwill. Watson worked it out: the video was 18 months old, it was from the first time his wife had left him. It turns out that another woman with flowers had been pushed in front of a train around that time. So he gave a woman flowers and pushed her in front of train and then killed his wife and used the old video to explain her disappearance. He calls her insane and says Joan wants him to be guilty.

They look through Kelly's emails and find the original one with the video archived. Watson is right.

Later she gets a call from her friend Emily who says she's not going to apologize for worrying about her, but she will apologize for doubting her since she's a reporter and was just assigned a story to write about the subway pusher guy.

Sherlock asks her to come downstairs and check out some files sent to him by a friend. He says he figured out who the murderer was in a matter of seconds and he wants to see how long it takes Joan. He says that although she enjoyed a modicum of success today she shouldn't let it go to her head.

She changes her job on her dating profile from ""sobriety counselor"" to ""consulting detective."""

A security guard reads a book as he listens to a report of a Nor'easter bearing down. A woman outside on the ground cries for help. He helps her and she pulls a gun on him and shoots him. Two male cohorts join her and drag the body behind the counter. But he was only playing dead and gets another shot off at the thieves.

Watson comes home from stocking up for the storm. She sees a woman at the Holmes house. Her names is Ms. Hudson and she's in tears. She asks for tea. According to Sherlock she's an auto-didact who has helped him with jobs in the past. He explains she has worked as a ""muse"" to several creative types. She is also a transvestite. She has recently been the kept ""woman"" of a Davis Renkin and his wife didn't care for that so for now she is their new roommate. Watson points out it would've been polite to ask her first.

They get a call from Capt. Gregson and head over to the scene of the robbery/homicide. The guard, Mr. Dempster, ended up dying. Sherlock and Watson work out what happened, which is what we saw. The thieves stole a number of hot new phones about to go on sale. Sherlock is unimpressed by the case. And then the lights go out --all over the city--and he's intrigued by having to solve the case without the benefit of electricity.

Gregson and a FEMA employee coordinate the emergency response. The electricity being out is hampering the phone/murder investigation but Sherlock finds a tweet that gives the thieves' location away. They track down a homeless man who says he ""found"" the phones at a bakery, in the dumpster. He says a couple of big white dudes dropped them. Sherlock gives him money to get himself a room. He leaves the phones since he deduces the robbery was a distraction from whatever the killers were really after.

They head back to the scene of the crime and realize they must've gone upstairs. They head up to the 12th floor and an architectural firm. An employee of the firm is standing his ground in the office in case of looting. It turns out that they stole blueprints, and the phone theft was a feint. They grab some corresponding schematics to help figure out what blueprints were stolen.

Back at the homestead Ms. Hudson is bemoaning her lost relationship and Davis comes banging on the door to find her. He promises this time he will leave his wife.

Upstairs Sherlock is working on the electrical schematics and can't figure out what the thieves are after since there aren't many interesting clients.

The next morning Sherlock wakes Watson and says it's time to get going even though there's a blizzard on. Sherlock realized the real prize the thieves were after, the blueprints for the New York Federal Reserve, they were waiting for a storm like this one to use as a cover. They have no way to contact the police and Sherlock says they have to stop the robbery, in East Rutherford, themselves.

They bump into a plow truck which is on standby and ask to come in to warm up. He asks the lady driver - Pam - to raise the police in the 11th precinct. He sends Gregson a message about the robbery but he doesn't know if Gregson will get the message so he decides they must get there themselves and they try to commandeer Pam's plow truck to make it happen. And then when that doesn't work he bribes her.

Bell goes to a hospital to check on a gunshot victim from the robbery. He finds a woman who claims she was stabbed. She's checking out against medical advice claiming she doesn't have insurance. She asks if Bell found the mugger who stabbed her. He says no, he's here on a different matter. He asks her what happened. She starts telling her story and he notices the blond hair from her wig on her coat. He busts her. He tries to convince her to confess and then Gregson enters and asks about East Rutherford.

Pam drives Joan and Sherlock and she asks them questions but Sherlock doesn't want to do small talk. Joan gets a bar on her phone and calls home to check on Ms. Hudson and Davis but Sherlock forgot to pay the bill so the phone is out, not because of the storm. They arrive at the Federal Reserve building and an imperious man says there's no way they're getting in since they can't raise the police to confirm who they are and there's no chance to get into their vaults directly anyway. But then the imperious guy notices a strange sort of information on the computer screen. They discover that the thieves got in, looped the security footage, and shredded fake paper to cover their theft of $30 million.

Sherlock finds the point of entry/exit, a faraway door that leads to a tunnel. Sherlock notices a trail in the snow into the woods and says they haven't been gone for more than an hour. They think it's not too late to catch them.

Bell and Gregson continue to investigate the woman who has worked many larcenies with her Russian husband. They ask her to give him up or else she'll face a murder charge alone. Sherlock finally gets in touch with them via Pam's radio. Sherlock deduces that even though they were planning to go to non-extradition countries they had to clean the money, they think they decided to do it through a race track.

Watson, Holmes, and Bell stake out the house of the race track employee. The ambulance they're carrying the money in arrives. They descend on the house and ambulance and... they're wrong. Sherlock realizes they've been duped yet again, like with the phones.

Pam drops them off and says it was fun and to call them if they need a plow for hire ever again. At home the house has been cleaned to spotlessness by Ms. Hudson. She has even arranged Sherlock's books to his liking. She reports that she and Davis did break up and she has to take another look at that ""kept woman"" thing.

Sherlock tries to work out how the thieves got by them in their ambulance while the city was locked down. Sherlock figures it out and takes his theory to Gregson, how they created a hole in the checkpoints which means they have a high level player on the inside, like perhaps the new FEMA official.

Bell goes back to the female thief and says they are putting her away for life for murder. The lights start flickering and they stage what looks like jailbreak because of the power flicker. They make the woman believe that she might be able to escape with the help of her high level accomplice, and wait to see who that person is. It turns out they were right, it is the FEMA woman.

Ms. Hudson takes off but has agreed to clean their house weekly and Sherlock forces Watson to split the cost with him 50/50. Pam arrives to give her a ride to her new place."

Holmes agrees to find the blackmailer and his accomplice and destroy all evidence of the tape because, as he says ""I have a particular disdain for blackmailers.""

(We will learn later this man's name is Daniel Gottlieb.) With the laptop Gottlieb has the power to hack the pacemaker in the man's chest. He wants the man to ""revoke"" his vote on a committee he sits on. The man grabs his iPad, revokes his vote and... Gottlieb kills him anyway.

Sebastian Moran summons Sherlock to talk to him in prison and he gives him the dead man's obituary. He says Moriarty did it and Sherlock should follow up. He knows this because he was contracted to kill this man himself before Sherlock landed him in the clink. Moran then kills one of his prison guards, apparently for sport.

Sherlock lies to Gregson and says Moran told him nothing so he can investigate the claims on his own first. He and Watson go and perform an autopsy on the dead man and discover that his blood was literally boiled and he had marks on his hand consistent with being shocked and deduce that someone hacked his pacemaker.

After some other digging the discover the ""revoke"" vote he made right before he died. It appears his vote was the deciding one to knock an old prohibition era speakeasy off a historic register list meaning that a real estate/contractor could renovate the site now. All of the others who voted to revoke had contracting work done by the same man so they figure he must be behind it.

Until that man too is killed by an air conditioner falling out of a window. We see that that AC was pushed onto him by Daniel Gottlieb in an act of perfect timing.

After a bit of more digging they realize that a woman who was a vocal opponent to preserving the speakeasy status as a historic site will be the next target. They begin following her, basically using her as bait. They see she's wearing a medic alert bracelet that shows she's allergic to bees. They also discover that in the park that she runs through every single day now has a hive of rare Africanized honey bees, that if they stung her, would kill her almost instantly. Like the ""natural"" heart attack and the air conditioner ""accident"" it would look like the woman died of ""natural"" causes. Watson calls it a ""baroque"" plan but Sherlock admires it as quite tidy. They figure the man funding the bees will have to come back soon so they stakeout the beehive.

Watson wants to know what the plan is if they catch this man who works for Moriarty. Sherlock promises that he just wants to know who killed Irene and when they catch the guy he won't kill him. Watson doesn't believe him since nothing has changed since he almost killed Moran. Sherlock says he only made a real connection with one person, Irene. And now, in a roundabout way that makes it seem like he's talking solely about their teacher/student relationship, he says he's made another connection with her, which has changed him, or at least makes him want to see how his ""project"" turns out. She says it's one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to her. He says he'd like to promise her that he won't hurt the person responsible for Irene's death, just as he would that he'll never do drugs again but he's an addict and can't make promises but he asks her to trust his intent.

The ""beekeeper"" arrives it is Gottlieb. Sherlock claims they need to look at his notebook and then he tazes him.

They bring him back to the brownstone, tie him up in Sherlock's straitjacket and question him about the murders and Moriarty. Gottlieb has an encrypted message on his phone from Moriarty. They give him two options. Sherlock is going to send a message back saying things have gone wrong and they need to meet face to face and if by the time they get a response Gottlieb has told them everything he knows about Moriarty Sherlock will impose upon the police to give him special treatment. Or they'll just hand him over to the cops.

Gottlieb says he has killed 31 people, unclear if they were all for Moriarty, but doesn't know who he is. He does tell them what he knows: 8 years ago he was doing an environmental impact study in the U.K. and a tall British guy sat down next to him and asked him to dinner since he wanted to pick the brain of a serial killer who was passing in society. He had figured Gottlieb out and said he'd be in touch. He says it was all on the phone after that. He says he mentioned he spent time in reform school as a kid. He also says he knows Sherlock, and had an ""accidental overdose"" lined up for him but then another text canceled the job. He says it was the only time he got a cancellation.

After receiving a return message for a meet-up, Sherlock and Watson stake out the diner where it's supposed to go down. They don't expect Moriarty himself to show. Gottlieb, of course, doesn't show and they follow the man who looks like he was waiting for someone and takes off in a fancy car. He crosses some train tracks just as a train is coming effectively cutting off Sherlock and Watson. He meets someone on the other side. By using a superfast setting on his camera and opening the aperture wide Sherlock takes a series of fast photos, between the train trucks, slices up the images and pastes them together coming up with a man's face. Gottlieb confirms that is the man who recruited him.

Sherlock studies the photo. He worked his contacts in the U.K. and narrowed down those who did time in reform schools and prisons and found him. John Douglas. Turns out he was also brilliant and lethal as a boy. While in reform school his best friend was beaten to death by older boys and a few months later a few of his assailants were dead. He was released on his 18th birthday and he has no rap sheet. Sherlock thinks he's been using the Moriarty alias for 45 years. Watson wonders what they'll do next. Sherlock says he doesn't know.

The next morning Watson awakes to an apology from Sherlock. He says he knew more than he let on and he's sorry for abandoning her at the climax of their drama and he's of to see what he'd do with a loaded syringe.

He confronts Douglas in his hotel-- registered under his childhood friend's name-- and he's impressed he found him. He asks if he's Moriarty. He says he's not him, he could never be him, but he does know why he's looking for him: Irene. He says he didn't kill her but knows why she had to die: it was because of Holmes. And then Douglas gets shot in the back, right through the window.

The police arrive and Gregson wants to know what the hell is going on with Sherlock. He half-admits the stuff about Moran and this guy working for someone else and Sherlock is looking for him. He gives his word he won't repeat his Moran tactics. Gregson says he wishes his word meant more to him. Watson arrives and looks in her medical bag that Sherlock brought to intimidate Douglas. It's full of Lego. Sherlock offers this as proof that he's a changed man.

Watching the interrogation on the opposite side of the glass, Gottlieb is confessing, 18 murders so far says Gregson to Watson and Holmes. He has no interest in an attorney, he just wants to talk. He gets a text and they have him read it. Gottlieb can't translate it. Holmes brings it to Moran. He can't read it either, agreeing with Gottlieb that it's not a code they used. Moran does seem to know though and all he says is, ""leave it"" in a very menacing fashion.

Holmes works on decrypting the code. Watson offhandedly notes the time and Holmes realizes that is the decryption key: when the message was sent.

As he works it out we cut to Moran in his cell singing on old football drinking song. Sherlock cracks the code: it's a note to Moran. ""You never told me you had a sister, either you die or she does- M."" We cut to Moran bashing his head against the wall.

Sherlock tries to call Gregson to have him warn the warden but it's too late. Moran bashed himself into a coma and has terrible brain swelling. They realize Moriarty played him into bringing the text to Moran.

Sherlock says Moriarty had him in his sights twice and left him alive so he doesn't know what the game is. Watson points out that he may be the game. Gottlieb's phone rings. It's Moriarty, he says they're overdue for a chat."

Holmes gets a call from Moriarty. He taunts him about how he is like a spider with a large web of people working for him. He tells Holmes if he can solve the cold case murder of a man named Wallace Rourke he will tell him all about Irene Adler.

Holmes gets to work, Rourke appears to have been robbed and killed. Watson wants to talk about the fact that he's doing it all. Holmes says that doing this will get him closer to Moriarty, who if he wanted Holmes dead could've made that happen already.

They go to the precinct to do research. There Gregson asks Watson, as a favor to him, to be a sober companion to the daughter of a friend after she gets out of rehab. Watson demurs saying she no longer does it but says she'll give him names.

They go to see Rourke's widow who knows nothing of Moriarty. But she says Wallace did think he was being followed but since he was just a mechanic she doesn't think he could've been involved in anything really nefarious. They collect his things and discover an old cell phone.

Holmes and Watson deduce that Rourke's murder was very specifically carried out - stunned, immobilized, and then stabbed in each lung.

Watson asks Holmes about what Irene was like. He says she was American, difficult to explain, a great painter who worked as a restoration artist, highly intelligent, well-traveled and optimistic about the human condition. She was to him ""the"" woman.

They discover something hinky about his new cell phone, which was stolen when he died. They think he was being followed via GPS on it. They visit a private security firm run by Darren Sutter and his wife Peg. They notice in passing that Sutter is a martial artist. Sutter claims he doesn't know Rourke but his company was tracking his phone. They ask who hired them to send the phone and track him. They admit they only watched him for a few days. They say their client said he made threats but they found the claims were unfounded. They won't tell. Holmes thinks Sutter made it up.

Sutter's sister was murdered as a young woman 22 years ago-- he wrote about it in his book-- and Holmes believes that Rourke committed the murder, Sutter found him and killed him, employing his martial arts skills. Holmes thinks Moriarty wants them to bring Sutter down, which will make his private security clients more vulnerable.

Holmes meets privately with Sutter in a park and lays out his theory and asks him about Moriarty, who he says he thinks would profit from Sutter's incarceration. Sutter isn't quick to trust him and that he won't go to the police. Holmes tells him to check for bugs in his office.

Gregson asks Watson about helping his friend again. She worries he's unhappy with her work. He says she's doing a great job but worries that she's letting her life be subsumed by Holmes and her safety around him. While she's in the precinct, Sutter comes in to confess to Rourke's murder. Holmes watches the interrogation and thinks Sutter found the bugs and that Moriarty was listening. Holmes wishes Sutter had come to him and now all they can do is wait for Moriarty's call since they found Rourke's murderer as he asked themhim to.

As they wait for the call at the apartment he asks about why she was seeing Gregson but then the phone rings and it's Moriarty. Holmes wants his answers. Moriarty says he only did half the job. It turns out that Sutter killed the wrong man --Rourke didn't kill Sutter's sister and had an alibi-- and Holmes has to finish the job.

Holmes stays up all night and discovers that Moriarty was at least possibly correct about Rourke not being the man who killed Leah and then indeed Sutter killed the wrong man so they have to find Leah Sutter's killer.

Watson wonders aloud why Moriarty is making Holmes jump through these hoops. He says he's not afraid she points out that there are ways of hurting him that don't involve hurting him physically. Holmes promises no harm will come to her.

They split up to investigate. Holmes goes to see Sutter in prison and lays out the evidence that Sutter was misled in killing the wrong man. Sutter thinks Holmes is being played.

Watson goes to see Sutter's wife and plays tape of Moriarty but she doesn't recognize the voice and won't let Watson look at her client list. She also refuses to believe that her husband was tricked into killing the wrong man. She met him at a candlelight vigil for his sister all those years ago. She's grateful that he's found some peace even if it means jail time.

They try to piece together information about Sutter's clients through people he's helped put away. Holmes freaks out in frustration at being so close to answers and says he refuses to come up empty-handed and he knocks over his corkboard with all the info pinned to it. Watson cleans up and notices a photo of Sutter and his wife.

Watson theorizes his wife tricked into killing Rourke to make himself feel better: to give him peace.

They go to see her with Gregson and Bell. They say her prints match those found at Leah Sutter's house the night she died. She admits she and Darren were having an affair. That night she saw the killer's face, not her husband so it was her that told him that Wallace Rourke was the killer. To cover their affair Darren claimed he saw the man. She insists that he was the man. They relay to her that Rourke was out of the country and she was wrong. She confesses after she found him in a suicide attempt on the 20th anniversary of his sister's death that she pinned it on Rourke and she doesn't regret it. So now Holmes and Watson have found the person who really killed Rourke.

Holmes goes to tell Sutter in jail. He promises to try and find Leah's killer. Sutter says there won't be justice until he can strangle the man who did it.

Moriarty calls Holmes again and texts him an address. He lies to Watson that he hasn't heard from him and goes to the address, a palatial mansion behind gates. Watson tracks Holmes to the house, busting him in a lie. He says he lied to protect her. She says she doesn't want it. She says she deserves answers as well since she's worked with him every step of the way. They enter the house. It is mostly empty. They wander around. Out on a patio they hear music and see dozens of paintings of cityscapes on easels. And a painter. Holmes collapses in tears and points at a blond woman, the painter, on a stool and calls ""Irene."" The woman turns around."

Irene Adler is alive!

He grabs her, she resists and then they embrace.

We flash back to London, two years ago.

He met her while working on an art forgery case. She confirms they're fakes. Upon meeting him she calls him beautiful, noting the symmetry of his face. She is doing restoration in her apartment when they meet and he admires her work on the paintings. He notes that she has an original painting on her wall, which means she returned to the museum a forgery she had made, as she had with the other paintings on her wall. He strikes a bargain: if he can spot which ones are real and which ones are fake she will go on a date with him. She accepts but wonders why they would need to leave the apartment to enjoy each other's company.

We then sprint to the present, Irene is in the hospital, disoriented, apparently unaware that it's 2013. Holmes waits outside and Watson offers to talk if need be. Gregson arrives with no info from investigating the house. The doctor tells them that she's fine physically and is suffering PTSD. She was abducted and moved from place to place and then subjected to deep psychological torture, destroying her personality and making her dependent. The abductor calls himself Stapleton and wears a clown mask. Sherlock blames himself for this happening. Moriarty wanted him to think her dead, mourn her, get addicted to drugs, come back to life and then send her back to him a completely different person. He wonders aloud where all the blood from the scene came from and how he couldn't know she was still alive. Watson tells Holmes that they can help Irene. Holmes doesn't want to consult on the case. He wants to look after her and says he wouldn't be of much use since Moriarty is so much smarter than him.

They bring Irene home three days later. She has no family to speak of so Holmes doesn't expect to hear from anyone. Watson wants to help Holmes but doesn't want to be in the way and offers to leave. He says this is her home and they can work it out as they go but mostly he wants her to work on Irene's case. She's nervous to do it alone but Holmes has confidence in her.

Watson goes with Gregson to the scene. She finds a clue in some rare paint and Bell and Gregson say it's just like having Holmes there.

We flashback to London and Holmes asking Irene why she's been rebuffing him since their first, marathon-of-sex date. She says it was too unique and memorable to try and repeat. She says people don't treasure things anymore and he should try it. He offers to give her another totally unique experience. He takes her to tunnels underneath Camden Market. They skedaddle into an undocumented portion of the tunnels and check out an ancient canal. He says they are the only two people who know about it.

Back in the present, Irene is freaking out in her bed that Stapleton ""changed the rules"" without telling her. She asks him to sit with her and catch her up and tell the story of the last year and a half and his move to New York. Watson returns just then and Gregson calls with a tip on the rare paint, only one person bought some recently: a known felon named Duane Proctor. They go to see him, but his brother Isaac tells them he isn't there. When Duane returns home, he tells the police that he bought the paint for his brother. Gunshots ring out from inside. Isaac has shot one of the detectives and escaped.

Later, as he cuts his hair and shaves his beard to change his appearance, Isaac gets a call from a Moriarty minion saying he needs to do them a favor involving Sherlock Holmes.

We flashback to London and Holmes and Irene post-coital, with Holmes working the case that was related to Sebastian Moran with the tripod and the blood-draining. Romantic. He then compliments her on enigmatic nature. They then talk about her current restoration work and he asks after her original work. He wants to see it. She says he'll see it when it's ready.

Back in the present she watches TV. She says it must be difficult having her there and can only imagine what he's picking up from her right now, clues, pain. He catches her up on his life. He comes clean about becoming an addict in the wake of her death because he was broken. His dismissal by Scotland Yard. His dad forcing him into rehab. He apologizes that what happened to her was his fault. She says he fixed himself and that gives her hope. She then goes to her room and shrieks. She sees a white flower on her bed and says this means Stapleton was there.

Back in the past in London, Irene leaves a message to tell Sherlock it's time to see her original work. He enters her apartment to see a pool of blood and a note from Moriarty.

In the present he takes Irene to a safe house he has. He explains the flower was a message from Moriarty to him, that as long as Irene is in his life he will be in danger. So he says he has to let her go, send her far away and when he is ""finished"" with Moriarty he will find her. He doesn't know how else to protect her. She says she has an idea.

Gregson, Bell, and Watson find the footage of Isaac infiltrating Holmes's house. Watson meets with Holmes in secret at the precinct and catches him up. He catches her up: he's leaving with Irene, this was her idea. Holmes hopes that Watson can figure it out in his absence but he feels he owes Irene this. Watson thinks this is what Moriarty wants and therefore is wrong.

Isaac meets up with another of Moriarty's minions. One tries to double cross the other and that the ""hands off"" policy on Sherlock is now over and he plans to kill him, no matter what Moriarty wants.

Irene and Sherlock plan to hit the road. But, when she disrobes to change her clothes Sherlock notices that a tell-tale birthmark on her back is not there any more. He realizes that she had it removed. And then deduces that she is working for Moriarty. He wants to know when she started, if their whole relationship was a lie. She says for him not to overthink it and that he's inventing a reason not to go away with her. She says when he realizes the mistake he's made to not seek her out because she never wants to see him again.

Sherlock goes home and is confronted by Isaac, who shoots him. Sherlock manages to get the gun away from him. Isaac says that he and Sherlock have met once before, he was looking at him through the sniper scope in when John Douglas was killed. They fight, Sherlock runs upstairs, barricades the room and attempts to escape. He asks Isaac why he didn't kill him before with the sniper rifle. Isaac tells him that he used to be under orders not to kill Sherlock, but now that ""she"" had tried to have him killed, he was going to kill him. When Sherlock asks ""She?"", Isaac is shot from behind, and Irene walks in, gun drawn. Now speaking with an English accent, she says, ""I bet you wish you'd run away with me when you had the chance."" Lightbulb. Irene is Moriarty."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2767598/?ref_=ttep_ep24,,"While recovering from his gun shot wounds, Holmes eschews painkillers while working on a case of a Greek shipping magnate - involving an assassination and currency manipulation - before his final showdown with Moriarty.",[],TV-14,Release date,['John Polson'],"['', '', '']",[],"['one word title', 'villainess']",[],"""Elementary""- ""Heroine"" - May 16, 2013

So, there you have it, Irene Adler is actually Moriarty and she's got a gun pointed at Sherlock.

As he lies on the ground writhing from the gunshot wound to his shoulder she monologues about how she seduced him, toyed with him, studied him, was annoyed by him because his work with Scotland Yard was messing up several of her assassination plans, fascinated by him because he was so brilliant, but not as brilliant as she is. She won't kill him because she considers him a work of art and she loves art and says he's not the threat she expected him to be, proved by his drug addiction. He believes that she thinks he's close to undermining one of her plots again. She tells him simply to let her win. And if he doesn't he will hurt him, worse than she has before. She leaves.

Watson returns home and he fills her in as she removes the bullet and stitches him up. She says he needs painkillers, the non-addictive kind. He thinks the pain gives him clarity. He also says the truth has been liberating.

Through a series of clues they deduce that Irene/Moriarty is in town to make sure a Greek national named Theophilus kills the ruler of Macedonia's son. If she achieves this goal she will make a billion dollars thanks to an investment in Macedonian currency. (Macedonia is set to join the EU and begin using the Euro. But if a famous Greek national commits this murder than there will be an uproar that will likely mean they won't join the EU.)

Gregson is worried that an injured, devastated Holmes should be benched from the investigation. Watson says to give him some slack and she'll let him know when he needs to be stopped.

Irene/Moriarty tricks Watson into thinking her mother is in the hospital and strong arms her into a meeting. She's curious to know why Holmes is interested in Watson, how she fits in his life. Watson gives her nothing but awesome attitude.

They trail the Greek national, discover that Irene/Moriarty has kidnapped his daughter and this is how she is going to get him to commit the murder. They figure this all out as Theophilus is heading to kill the Macedonian ruler. They are too late, the ruler's bodyguard is working for Irene/Moriarty. He kills the leader and his wife and the bodyguard kills Theophilus.

When they interrogate the bodyguard he refuses to cop to anything regarding Irene/Moriarty. Sherlock freaks out they fight and Watson talks him off the ledge. She tells him to ""let her win.""

Sherlock ditches his security and finally arrives home. He tells Bell that he's going to take a shower. Bell gets a call that a drug dealer was beaten and robbed by a British man near Sherlock's home. Worried that he's relapsed Bell busts the door down. Sherlock is lying on the floor, passed out, a syringe lying nearby. He has overdosed.

Irene/Moriarty comes to visit him in the hospital and gloat and then offers him a chance to run away with her and live a life he could never have dreamed of. He said they both made the same mistake, they fell in love and it made them stupid. And then he lowers the boom. Watson ""solved"" Moriarty. The whole overdose was a charade. They knew she would come to the hospital. They set the trap and she fell into it. Watson and Gregson enter the room and bust her. Her billion dollar windfall has been frozen.

Back on the roof of the apartment Holmes shows Watson something incredible. The bee in the box he received early in the year that was totally unique was not supposed to be able to breed with other kinds of bees. But Holmes added the bee to his bee colony on the roof and, lo and behold, it bred. He shows her the birth of the first offspring with a magnifying glass. It has to be classified as an entirely new species and he gets to name it and he's calling it ""Euglassia Watsonia."" Awww, he named the bee after her. She sits and watches as more bees are born."

Tonight, he must attend the opening of his latest movie ""Head On,"" (co-starring Jessica Alba) but first he and his three best friends from back home (Queens, NY) have lunch and discuss their upcoming 10-year high school reunion. Vince is reluctant to go but his buddies urge him to go with them. Vince is always a favorite with the hot girls, while the girls will always ignore Drama.

E has been going out with a girl named Kristen whom both Drama & Turtle think is a bad influence. It seemed like E and Kristen had broken up, but E fell off the wagon and has been calling Kristen again. Ali Larter is angry with Vince for some reason, and E, Drama & Turtle go to considerable lengths to keep her away from Vince at the Premiere & the post premiere party. At the post-premiere party, Vince's agent, Ari, hassles Eric about getting Vince to read the script for a possible new project ""Matterhorn"". Ari wants an answer from Vince on whether he wants to do the film. At night E sleeps with a girl whom Drama & Turtle have introduced to E, as she looks like Kirsten (a revenge fuck). Over breakfast, Vince decides he's not going to do ""Matterhorn"" on Eric's advice. Eric read the script and didn't like it at all. E lives in the guest house. Drama is Vince's half-brother, but Turtle, E and Vince stayed with Drama for 2 years when they moved to Hollywood from Queens NYC.

The foursome goes to meet with the Matterhorn director (Vince wanted to cancel the meeting but then decided against it as it is rude to cancel at the last moment) where Vince impresses him so much that Ari calls later to tell him that they've offered Vince $4 million for the part (Vince only got paid $ 2 million for his last movie, so this is a big bump up). While Turtle and Drama celebrate, Vince lets Ari know that Eric is not too enthused about the script.

The guys adopt a guard dog for their house (suggested by Turtle), but the mutt is ferocious & the guys are afraid to get him out of his pen. Vince puts Turtle in a hockey goal-keeper suit & lets the dog rip at him, in exchange for a pass for Turtle to attend a party at the Playboy mansion.

Later, Ari and Eric share a rather confrontational dinner while discussing the future of their star's career. Ari tells E that he has been in business for 15 yrs, while E has been here only 14 months, & was running an Italian dinner joint (a pizzeria - E was the night manager at Sbarros) back on the East coast. He further insults E by saying that he never talks to the help.

Turtle and Drama tell E that they saw Kristen with Vince Vaughan. She had both her hands down his pants. They were kidding. After Vince decides to take Eric's advice not to do the movie, the boys leave for their reunion. Vince is ready to fire Ari, based on what E tells him. But E tells Vince to act more responsibly & Vince asks E to pick his projects for him. Before they can drive off, though, they get a call from Ari with some bad news: Colin Farrell has taken the part in Matterhorn. Vince makes Ari speak to E, which Ari hates.

While paying Ari an office visit to discuss it, Eric meets Ari's new assistant, Emily. Drama and Turtle sit outside, while Vince and E go for the meeting with Ari. Ari berates E for passing on Matterhorn, which could have been Vince's next job. E is worried that the bad review might hurt Vince's prospects, but Ari plays it down in front of Vince. Ari tells Vince to get a full-time manager, but Vince sticks with E (why pay a manager 10%, when E does the job for $4000 a month). Ari gives Vince a bunch of scripts to read.

Ari tells E, when Vince has left, that bad reviews always impact chances & that's why you book your next project before the movie is released. He says on Friday, when the movie releases, 200 reviews are going to be out & if they are all as bad as today's then Vince is in deep shit.

Following Ari's advice to show Vince a good time to get his mind off the review, Eric okays Vince's poor decision to buy a new Rolls Royce. But he convinces Vince to lease it, instead of buying it. Buying the Rolls would have cost $320,000. Marvin, Vince's business Manager tells E that Vince is out of money and buying a Rolls Royce was the stupidest idea that they all collectively had. Leasing it was even worse, as if they bought it, they could have sold it as well. Fortunately, E had gone to meet Marvin alone. Marvin tells E to tell Drama to ease up on his 2500$/month supplements and Turtle's 1500 $/month mobile bills (you can get an unlimited plan for $200/month) When E goes back to lunch with the guys, they are busy checking out houses, as the new car doesn't fit with their existing house. But the new ones cost $10 million.

Jessica Alba bumps into the boys during their luncheon and invites them to her party for Justine Chapin, her virginal pop-singer friend. The party proves to be a good time for everybody: Justine hits on Vince, Turtle shows off the Rolls to some girls, Eric gets some much-needed assurance (Ari berates E for letting Vince buy a RR, but then Vince reposes his faith in E by refusing to hire a full time manager saying that he trusts E's instincts and that Vince trusts E). Drama finds that he isn't the only one skipping his acting class. Vince decides to return the Rolls (as he thinks it makes them looks like ass), but E reminds him that he has signed a 3 year lease.

In the morning, Eric reads Vince a review from the New York Times proclaiming him to be ""the next Johnny Depp."" The guys head out to look for a new house, in celebration."

Vince agrees to appear on Jimmy's show the next day itself.

In the morning, the foursome discuss their past relationships with women, and the consensus (all but Eric) seems to be that it's better to leave a girl dangling than break up with her. Drama also fills Vince in on his old grudge against Jimmy Kimmel (Drama & Jimmy were friends, till Drama got kicked off his show (Melrose Place), ran out of money & had to move into a motel. He never heard from Jimmy again)

Shauna (Debi Mazar) is Vince's publicist, who is angry with Vince for not telling her that he was doing the Tonight Show with Jimmy. She is worried that Vince with Jimmy might put off Letterman or Leno. Later on, Eric tries his best to do a pre-interview for Vince's appearance while they all enjoy a game of golf. Afterwards, he breaks it to Vince that one of his one-night stands (Sara Foster) will be appearing on the show as well. Vince is not taking the Kimmel interview seriously and has decided to wing it. He has no stories to tell on the show.

E is picked on by Drama & Turtle as they know Kristen (Monica Keena) is coming by later to pick her stuff up. They beg E not to start with Kristen again. Every time E engages with Kristen he is out of commission for 2 weeks. Vince even offered to box her stuff and ship it, but E wont have that.

The day of the show, Kristen stops by the guest house to pick up some things from Eric where the visit quickly turns into ""break-up sex."" Kristen tells Eric that she believes that Vince has to stop seeing a girl before it gets serious, so that it never gets real for Vince & he never gets hurt. Meanwhile, Drama and Turtle visit Rufus, who tells them that if Vince plugs his company on the show (& wears their hat), they'll get their home theatre system for free. The Luke Wilson system was $190 K.

At the show, the boys go to the Green Room (which is supposedly stacked with girls like a trout pond), while Vince finds Sarah's room for a pre-show apology/visit. Vince & Sarah end up having sex right before the show. Emily (Ari's new assistant) shows up and shares a cigarette with Eric.

On the show Vince refuses to talk about his movie with Jimmy & instead brings up Jimmy's feud with Drama. Jimmy tells Vince that it was Drama who could not be found & Jimmy never bailed on him. He asks Drama to come on stage to clear it out. Drama come out and puts the Rufus hat over Jimmy on live TV, & they end up getting the free home video system."

Vince's major work for the day is a stop at Big Boy's Neighbourhood, a local radio show. As a result of the appearance, Vince secures a date for himself with Justine Chapin. Basically, Vince announces on radio that since E got asked out on a date, he needs to find one as well. The radio host allows listeners to call in for a date with Vince and the first caller is Justine.

While everybody gets ready for the night's activities (Turtle has booked them 2 lanes at the Lucky Strike bowling alley), Ari video conferences with Eric to tell him that matinee numbers for Vince's movie have been ""less than stellar"" because it is in direct competition with the latest Pixar feature. Kristen also calls to confess to Eric that she might still harbor feelings for him. She also found out by radio that E got asked out on a date. Turtle resorts to desperate measures to get a date. Turtle picks a girl, Joanne, from Vince's fan mail, who had mailed Vince a naked picture of herself (she was hot). E takes Turtle aside and yells at him from bringing Joanne as she is psychotic. Drama decides to get Tanya.

After bowling (where E reveals to Turtle that he is stressed as the movie is not doing very well), the large group makes a stop at a night club where, one by one, the boys find themselves alone. Joanne bails when she sees that she doesn't have a chance with Vince. Tanya bails when she spies Drama staring at Joanne's behind. Justine Chapin bails when Vince comes onto her too hard (she has taken has chastity vow very seriously). The night does not end on a bad note, however, and Ari arrives with some good news that Vince's movies grossed $18.6 M on opening night, beating all projections.

Ari is also not happy that Fiona seems to be controlling Vince. She is reading the script and calling the shots on which movies are good for Vince's career. She even picks the restaurant where they had met for lunch (it was a vegetarian Chinese place). He advises E to get Fiona under control.

Fiona overhears Turtle's weed dilemma and offers to take the guys to her Sherpa.

Ari calls and informs E that he got them a dinner with the producer of Queens Boulevard, Scott Wick.

Eric and Vince have dinner with Scott Wick, the movie's producer, thanks to Ari. Vince doesn't want to go (as he is not interested to work with a guy who doesn't like him), but Fiona convinces Vince that he would be able to charm Scott.

It's not going very well until Vince offers to hook Scott up after admitting to being high during the meeting. The three share a joint in Scott's car when a cop stops by to check up on them but Vince's charm and movie-star status saves them all.

Josh invites Vince & co to his party. Emily is pissed & tells E that he should speak to Ari, before attending Josh's party. E refuses, but tells Emily she can tell Ari, if she wants to.

Turtle confronts Gary Busey with some interesting results. Gary says he can destroy Turtle physically and that all art is the journey and not the destination. Turtle is speechless. Josh tells E that Scott Wick made an offer to Ari. He says that E needs to step in else the movie goes away. When Eric lets Ari know about their disapproval (he threatens Ari that they will go with Josh as their new agent), Ari leaves his kid's birthday party to have an honest conversation with the pair.

The outcome of the meeting is hazy: Billy Walsh has rented out an entire suite and is having a haze party in it with many friends. The guys find that Billy is considered to be a genius director and everybody in town wants to work with him. Billy takes Vince and E for coffee. Billy hates studio movies and says that he is not in the business for money.

Vince likes Billy Walsh (Rhys Coiro), but Eric is getting a bad feeling, and they walk away with a script that he has made revisions to. Billy doesn't like E and calls him ""Suit"", he reference to the fact that he feels E wants Vince to do a studio movie.

The revision that causes the most uproar begins to cause some tension among the ranks. Billy has written a scene where a guy gives a blow job to Vince. Vince is open to doing the scene, but he doesn't understand why this scene is in the movie. The gang arrange for a meeting with Billy (who is at a strip club). Billy again convinces Vince that the blow job scene will not make him look gay. E doesn't trust Billy and says he is an egomaniac. Vince likes Billy and trusts him.

E gets a call from Kristen. Apparently, the night before, when E thought he drunk dialed Emily, he actually dialed Kristen. Shauna lets Eric know that Vince's sex symbol status could be on the line if he chooses to go forward with this movie. Eric makes a secret phone call to Ari to express his concern.

Ari says that the meeting was set up for Vince to approve Billy Walsh. All Vince has to do is to call the producer and Walsh is done. Ari tells E to watch some of Billy's old movies. Maybe Vince will hate the movie.

After hearing some reassuring wisdom, the boys screen Billy's previous film, which was a huge hit at Sundance. Amazingly, they all like it. The only problem now is that one gay scene. The next day, E is prepared to walk away if Billy doesn't cut the gay scene. Billy sticks to his guns & knows that he will be removed from the movie as Scott will never lose Vince. Vince is amazed by Billy's passion for the movie and agrees. E agrees as well, seeing that Vince has agreed. That's when Billy reveals that there is no gay scene in the movie and that it was a test for Vince, that he trusted Billy completely.

Read all",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Julian Farino'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Now Vince is about to return to New York for months to shoot, Turtle decides to make some money for a change- by charging entry for Vince's go away-party. Vince cant afford to throw a going-away party as he is getting only $60 K for the Billy Walsh movie and is angry at E for not getting him more money. Vince has decided to say good-bye to all the girls he has been seeing & asks E to help. He also asks E to hook him up with Scarlett Johansson. E is angry at the way Vince has been treating him. E meets Kristen & tells her that he is the one putting the entire thing together for Vince, & is not getting any respect. Kristen tells E to stand up for himself.

Drama finds Adam Davies is a great agent, as he gets him a well-paid audition ($10K plus first class flights and accommodations) for a promising pilot, CSI Minneapolis to be shot in Vancouver starring Don Johnson whom Johnny already knows. But the timing of the shoot is clashing with the timing for Queens Boulevard and his temper flares up again. Vince makes E wait in the car for 45 minutes, while he ""says goodbye"" to his flame. E is angry & again Kristen pumps E to dump Vince & ask for his fair share of respect. E leaves, dumping Vince. Then Shauna calls E about the $10 gate entry price that Turtle has printed on thousands on invites for Vince's party & that he is distributing them all over town.

In retaliation for dumping him, Vince makes E go to the meeting with Ari alone. E is again angry. E insists he wants his work as Vince's manager recognized, with a formal contract, and plays it hard despite skepticism from Ari. He asks Ari for his support.

Meanwhile Drama auditions for the role & is angry when he finds a person in the audition team, texting on his phone in the middle of his audition. Drama is kicked off the project when he looses it. E fights with Vince & asks him to go to dinner with him, before Turtle's party to talk about a formal management deal. Vince shows up to dinner but doesn't take the meeting seriously & even brings Drama & Turtle along with him. Vince says he likes the way things are, but E says that he won't come to NY, unless he is Vince's manager. E gets angry with Vince's attitude and leaves.

Drama counsels Vince that it's not easy to find a person whom you can trust and you can work with. Vince is so bummed that he doesn't go to Turtle's party (but Turtles collects the gate receipts nevertheless). Vince asks E to come to the airport. Vince pretends to leave E, but then stops the plane and tells E that he can't fire a friend, but can fire his manager. E is willing to take that chance for a 10% cut and health insurance. That's when E gives Vince a call with Scarlett Johansson, who is in New York and wants to meet Vince for a late dinner. The gang takes off in a private plane"

At the Avengers Tower, the Avengers minus the hulk tale Loki and the Tesseract down the elevator to the lobby The future Ant-Man and Tony Stark try to steal the Tesseract, and it ends up knocked over by Loki. Loki grabs it and teleports away.

In the Gobi Desert, Loki ends up falling into the sand after materializing in mid-air and falling. Several local tribesmen approach him, and Loki gets up on a rock outcropping and declares who he is. A portal opens and three Time Variance Authority police--Minutemen--come through it. They find the nearby tesseract, and Loki goes over and tells them not to touch it. Another officer, Hunter B-15, comes through and declares Loki a ""variant"". B-15 arrests Loki on behalf of the TVA for crime against the sacred timeline.

Loki isn't impressed, and tells them it's their last chance. B-15 hits him in the mouth with her baton, slowing him down to 1/16th speed, and puts a collar on him. When Loki collapses, the officers pick him up and B-15 tells the other officer to reset the timeline. As he plants a reset charge and activates it, B-15 picks up the Tesseract and takes Loki to the TVA base. Loki tries to run, but B-15 uses a remote and the collar it controls to reset Loki back to where he was. He tries to run again, and B-15 brings him back again.

B-15 has a clerk, Casey, enter the Tesseract into evidence. Loki tells Casey to be careful with the Tesseract as B-15 leads him off and shoves him into a cell with a robot. The robot disintegrates Loki's Asgardian clothing and then a trapdoor drops him into an office below. Loki is clothed in a gray prison jumpsuit, and another clerk at a desk shoves a pile of paper at Loki and tells him to verify it's everything Loki has ever said.

Loki finally signs and falls through another trapdoor, and a clerk has Loki testify that he's an organic being and possesses a soul. Once Loki does, the clerk tells him to move through an archway that will melt him from the inside if he is a robot. The archway takes a picture of Loki's temporal aura and a guard tells Loki to take a ticket. There's one other prisoner there who arrived when Loki did, and Loki takes a ticket on the guard's orders.

As Loki moves through the barriers, an animated presentation with Miss Minutes tells him that he's at the TVA and it's her job to catch Loki up before he stands trial for his crimes. She explains that there was a multiversal war and hundreds of warring timelines, and then three Timekeepers reorganized the universe into a single timeline, the sacred timeline. Now the Timekeepers preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything, but ""variants"" veer off the created path, people like Loki. They create a nexus event, which could lead to another multiversal war.

The Timekeepers created the TVA to deal with variants, setting time back on its proper path. Since the variant doesn't have a place in the timeline anymore, they have to stand trial for their offenses.

The other prisoner protests and a guard disintegrates him because he doesn't have his ticket. Loki quickly produces his.

In a church in Aix-En Province, France, in 1549, TVA Agent Mobius examines several dead Minutemen. Another Minuteman informs Mobius that when they arrive to investigate a nexus event, someone killed them. Mobius notes that the stab wounds appear consistent with the others on dead Minutemen, and the reset charge is gone. A Minuteman notes that it's the sixth attack in the last week, and a young local boy comes in.

Mobius approaches the boy and asks him if he saw who killed the Minutemen. The boy points at a nearby painted window showing the Devil, and Mobius says that the devil is afraid of them and they'll put the boy back where he belongs. The boy smiles, revealing blue tainted teeth, and Mobius asks what caused it. In response, the boy takes out a stick of blue gum and Mobius realizes the ""devil"" gave it to the boy.

The Minuteman warns Mobius that the timeline is near redline and they have to go. Mobius has the boy go outside, and as the Minutemen set a reset charge, a clerk portals in and shows Mobius the file on Loki, saying Mobius will want to see it.

B-15 brings Loki into a courtroom, and Judge Ravonna Renslayer says that he's charged with numerous sequence violations. Loki says that a god doesn't plead, and says that the Avengers are the ones who traveled through time. Mobius comes in and takes a seat, as Loki tell Ravonna that she should give him a taskforce to go after the Avengers. Ravonna says what the Avengers did what was supposed to happen, and Loki escaping was not, according to the Timekeepers.

Loki says that he should talk to the Timekeepers, but Ravonna says that they're busy dictating the proper flow of time. When he tries to teleport away, Loki discovers that his powers don't work. Ravonna tells him that magic powers don't work in the TVA, finds him guilty, and sentences him to be reset.

As Minutemen take Loki away, Mobius approaches the bench. Ravonna warns Mobius that what he's thinking is a bad idea, and if anything goes sideways it's on him. Mobius takes Loki to his office via a balcony overlooking the majestic TVA base. They then take an elevator down, and Mobius introduces himself. Mobius explains that he's taking Loki somewhere they can talk, and they both know that Loki loves to talk.

Mobius gets a baton from a guard and leads Loki into Mobius' office. Loki tries to attack Mobius, and Mobius uses a remote to move Loki back to where he started. Mobius has Loki sit down and then explains that he specialized in the pursuit of dangerous variants, and Loki isn't one of them. If Loki answers his questions honestly, then maybe Mobius can give Loki something he wants.

Starting with his first questions, Mobius asks Loki what he'll do if he returns. Loki says that he'll reclaim his throne, and Mobius wonders why someone with so much range just wants to rule.

Mobius then plays a film of some of Loki's ""greatest hits"". The agent points out that for someone ""born to rule"", Loki loses a lot. It might even be in his nature. When Loki notes that he killed Coulson, Mobius remind him that the Avengers united to avenge Coulson's death at Loki's hands. Mobius asks Loki if he enjoys hurting people, and Loki insists that he's a liberator.

The agent says that Loki is good at doing awful things and getting away, and plays a film of Loki posing as ""Mr. Cooper"", a passenger on a jetliner, hijacking the plane, jumping out with a bag of money. Heimdall teleports Loki away as he falls. Loki tries leave, disgusted with the conversation, and Mobius rewinds Loki back to his chair.

Loki asks Mobius what he wants, and Mobius says that he wants Loki to be honest about why he does what he does. Unimpressed, Loki says that the TVA is an illusion conjured by the weak to inspire fear. He insists that his choices are his own, and Mobius shows Loki a clip of him dominating a crowd in Berlin. Loki insists that when he has ultimate power, it will be cause of what he did, not because it was supposed to happen or because the TVA allowed it to happen. He dismisses the TVA as a footnote in his ascent.

Mobius explains that if Loki hadn't reacquired the Tesseract, he would have been taken to a cell on Asgard. The agent explains that the TVA can see Loki's future, and in the film it shows Loki's mother Frigga confronting Loki and then Loki sending the Dark Elves to kill Frigga. Loki insists that Mobius is lying, and Mobius tells Loki that it's the proper flow of time, and it happens again and again. He asks again if Loki enjoys hurting people, and Loki throws his chair at him in fury.

Mobius rewind Loki back to where he was sitting, but the chair isn't there so Loki falls on the floor. He then tells Loki that he was born to cause pain and suffering and death, and that's how it will always be... so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves. Mobius helps Loki up, and B-15 comes in and asks Mobius what he's doing. Mobius says that he's doing his job, and she says that they have a situation. The agent tells Loki to stay put and leaves with B-15.

Outside, B-15 tells Mobius that talking to the variant is a mistake. She says that they've lost another Minuteman unit, and Mobius goes back in to discover that Loki has escaped... and stole the time rewinder remote from him.

Loki returns to where he was, and spots Casey wheeling a card.

Mobius, B-15, and a squad of Minutemen search for Loki.

Loki slips into the room with Casey's desk, grabs the worker, and shoves him down. The Asgardian tells Casey to give him the Tesseract, and Casey opens his desk drawer and gives Loki the Tesseract. There are dozens of Infinity Stones in the drawer as well, and when Loki sees them, Casey tells him that they get a lot of them and some of the clerks use them as paperweights. Shocked, Loki wonders if the TVA is the greatest power in the universe.

B-15 comes in and Loki uses the twister to twist himself away. B-15 and her men continue their search for Loki.

Loki rewinds back to the office, and rewinds the film of his life to the point where Frigga is dead. He then finds his future where he and Thor meet Odin, and then further to where he and Thor join forces. Loki then plays the moment of his death, when Thanos kills him.

The film ends and Loki chuckles, and B-15 comes in and asks him what's so funny. He attacks B-15, and she easily gets him in arm hold. Loki uses the remote to remove the collar, put in on B-15, and rewind her repeatedly so she never touches him. Loki finally rewinds her out of the room.

Casey tells two Minutemen about his encounter with Loki. B-15 appears in front of them and storm off, disgusted.

Mobius returns to his office and tells Loki that there's nowhere left for Loki to run. Loki figures that he can't go back to his timeline, and says that he doesn't enjoy hurting people but he does it because he has had to. It's part of the illusion, a desperate play for control. Mobius figures that Loki does know himself and says that he doesn't see Loki as a villain.

Loki notes that the Tesseract is useless in the TVA, and Mobius says that he can offer Loki something better than salvation. He explains that a variant has been killing their Minutemen, and he needs Loki to help stop the variant. When Loki wonders why him, Mobius tells him that the variant they're hunting is Loki.

In Salina, OK, in 1858, a squad of Minutemen appear in a field. There's a sword driven into the ground, and the Minutemen confirm that it's anachronistic. There's oil on the ground, and they set a reset charge to ""prune"" the timeline. One of them spots the hooded Variant a few hundred feet away. He drops a lamp on the ground, and it bursts igniting the oil.

The Minutemen are set on fire and die, and the Variant picks up the reset charge."

The four Minutemen go inside, and music booms out of the loudspeakers. The commander, C-20, removes her helmet and attacks the other three, and the Variant--mind-controlling her--aids her.

The commander drops unconscious while fighting one Minuteman, and the Variant comes up behind him and stabs him to death with a sword. The Variant then uses the Minutemen's own equipment to open a portal, and leaves with the unconscious C-20.

Loki is at his new desk reviewing time rules with a projection of Miss Minutes. He asks if Miss Minutes is alive or a recording, and then swats at her with a magazine. The hologram jumps away and jumps back into her computer. Mobius comes up and tells Loki that there's been an attack. Loki puts on the suit that Mobius gives him They meet with Hunter B-15, who tells Mobius that C-20's team went dark just after they jumped into the 1985 branch. They don't know which variant attacked the team, and Loki insists that it's the lesser kind.

B-15 points out that ""Variant"" is printed on the back of Loki's jacket, and says that she doesn't want people to forget who he is. Mobius tells the team that they're looking for a variant Loki, and projects holograms of all the Lokis they've pruned. Loki lectures them on the difference in his powers, and Mobius says that they're going to take Loki along as an ""expert"". Mobius tells Loki that he knows Loki won't betray them, because Loki knows they can capture him and it won't get him any closer to the Time Keepers.

The team goes to 1985 and locates the time nexus, and Mobius explains that they have to show up in real time because of the unstable nature of the nexus. They go into the tent, find C-20's helmet, and figure the Variant has taken her hostage even though the Variant never has before. Loki tells the team that if they leave the tent, they'll end up like the dead Minutemen. He says that he can sense his own schemes, and tells them that the Variant wants them to look for C-20, and it's a trap.

Time is approaching the redline, and Loki says that the Variant wants him. He offers to deliver them the Variant, but he tells Mobius that he needs assurances that he won't be disintegrated when the job is done. Loki says that he needs to speak to the Time Keepers at once. Mobius figures that Loki is playing games and there is no trap, and tells the team to set the reset charges. Once they're done, they depart and the charge eradicates the timeline.

Back at the TVA, Mobius goes to Ravonna's office to meet with her. She points out that Loki is stubborn, subordinate, and unpredictable. Mobius figures that understanding ""their"" Loki helps them understand the Variant and get closer to him. He suggests that Loki might have changed, and Ravonna says that the Time Keepers are monitoring every aspect of the case, and they want the Variant caught.

Ravonna tells Mobius that it will be his last chance with Loki. As Mobius leaves, he tells Ravonna that if it doesn't work, he'll delete Loki himself. The agent goes out into the waiting room where Loki is, and they leave together. Loki claims that he was running a triple bluff, but Mobius doesn't want to hear it. Mobius tells Loki that Loki is there to help him capture the Variant, and figured Loki would help because he can't take that his variant is better.

Mobius figures that Loki is trying to get to the Time Keepers and take control of the TVA. Loki wonders why Mobius is stick his neck out for him, and Mobius tells Loki that either he feels sorry for Loki, or wants to catch the Variant.

Mobius wants Loki to go over the Variant's case files and then give Mobius his unique perspective, in case there's something they missed. The agent leaves Loki at a desk with the case files and goes to get a snack, and Loki reads the files. He talks to himself loudly about what he's found, and a nearby clerk shushes him. Loki turns and shushes her back

Loki approaches the head clerk and asks for files pertaining to the creation of the TVA, and she tells him that they're classified. All the other relevant files he asks for are classified as well, and she takes him to the only files that he can read; the one about the Variant.

Going back to his desk to study the files, Loki finds a reference to the destruction of Asgard. He reads the file about his civilization's destruction , takes the files to Mobius in the cafeteria, and tells the agent that he found something. Loki points out that he could go to Asgard right before its destruction and do anything he wanted to do, because the apocalypse is coming. It can be any apocalypse and it won't matter what Loki does, because the timeline won't branch because it gets destroyed anyway. Loki figures the Variant is hiding in an apocalypse and the TVA wouldn't notice.

Mobius concedes that it's a good theory, but refuses to take Loki out to test his theory. Loki assures Mobius that he wouldn't stab him in the back because it got old, and says that he loves to be right.

The agent takes Mobius to Pompeii in 79 AD, and Mobius scans for variance energy. He warns that if Loki is wrong, anything they could do would create a huge branch in the timeline, and says that they should start small by making bird noises.

Loki runs to a wagon, gets on it, and shoos the goats inside out. He introduces himself as the God Loki, and that he and Mobius are TVA agents. He yells that all of the residents are about to die when Vesuvius erupts in a short time, and that he's from the future. Vesuvius erupts, and the residents run while Loki yells that nothing matters. Mobius confirms that there's zero variance energy, and the ash cloud from the volcano approaches

Mobius and Loki return to the TVA, and they look for a disaster with no survivors. Loki falls asleep, and Mobius wakes him up so they can go for a walk. They go back to the cafeteria, and Mobius talks about the beauty of jet skis like the one advertised in the magazine on his desk. He admits that he doesn't have one, but it'd be fun. Mobius reads it to remind him of what they're fighting before.

The agent says that he accepts what is, and they discuss the chaos of creation. and he's lucky that chaos he emerged into gave him a purpose, and it's real because Mobius believe it's real. Loki insists that they're the only ones at the TVA who have free will, and wonders how it all ends. Mobius says that it's a work in progress, and the Time Keepers are untangling the epilogue that is to come. Loki says that is order, and sounds boring, and says that he knows that no one bad is truly bad... and no one good is ever truly good. Mobius tells Loki that he's very clever and walks off.

Mobius goes back to the files and checks the one about the candy box the Variant left at the cathedral. The candy, Kablooie, was only sold on Earth in in 2047 and 2051. If they cross-reference those years with apocalyptic events, they'll figure out where the Variant is hiding. Loki finds a reference to a hurricane in Alabama in 2050, and Mobius asks Ravonna to deploy a task force there. She tells Mobius that trusting Loki isn't a good idea, and Mobius insists that he can handle Loki. Ravonna is finally convinced but warns him that there's not much she can do him if it doesn't work out.

As they go the departure room, Mobius tells Loki that he did good work. He gives Loki his knives, and B-15 passing by takes them from Loki. She calls the task force together and briefs them on Roxxcart, the superstore where they'll be arriving, in Haven Hills. It has a large warehouse that civilians are using to ride out the storm. She tells the Minutemen to stay alert and figures the Variant is planning something by stealing the reset charges, but they don't know what. Loki points out if they see a Loki, they shouldn't kill him.

The hurricane rips through Haven Hills of 2050, and the task force appears outside of the superstore. They go in and Loki uses magic to dry his clothes. The lights flicker, and the Minutemen split up to search the shelters. B-15 insists that Loki stays with her, and Mobius objects. Loki tells Mobius that it's fine and he understands that he has to understand the TVA's trust. Mobius reluctantly leaves with the others.

The Variant watches the task force on the superstore's security monitors, sets a 20-minute timer on one of the consoles, and leaves.

Loki and B-15 move through the store, and Loki tries to chat with her. She tells him to shut up and they find a teenager examining a shelf with plants on it. The teenager says that there's a hurricane sale, and Loki tells B-15 that the teenager could be him. B-15 goes over to the boy, who grabs her wrist and a green glow spreads from him to her, and then he collapses. The Variant, speaking through B-15's body, identifies Loki.

Mobius and the others find the refugees, and one local says that if they're National Guard then they should be transporting the refuges out. They find C-20 sitting in an office, chanting to herself.

Loki tells the Variant that her possessing B-15 is cowardly, and she says that it's almost as cowardly as Loki working for the TVA. He insists that he's working for himself, and a clerk find them. The Variant touches him and jumps into his body, and B-15 collapses. Loki continues taunting the variant, asking if she's too scared to meet him face to face, and says that he has an offer for the Variant. Loki says that he's going to overthrow the Time Keepers and could use a qualified lieutenant.

The Variant checks the clerk's name badge, and tells Loki to call him ""Randy"". Loki says that he's been trying to help the Variant, but the Variant refuses Loki's offer and walks off. Loki follows him, while the real Variant lurks in the shadows and prepares a reset charge.

C-20 mutters about it being real, and Mobius asks her what she means. She says that she gave away how the Variant could find the Time Keepers.

B-15 wakes up when one of the Minutemen with Mobius calls her.

Loki asks Randy what he wants, and Randy says that it doesn't matter because Loki is too late. Loki notices a reset charge planted and figures the Variant lured them there so he could blow up the superstore and team along with it. The Variant possesses the body of a burly man and attacks Loki, and thanks Loki for helping him stall for time.

Loki stands up and dodges the Variant's next punch, and they fight hand-to-hand. The Variant throws Loki down.

B-15 finds Mobius and tells him that she lost Loki.

The possessed man plants another charge, and Loki recovers and walks toward the man and asks what it's about. The man laughs, tells Loki to brace himself, and collapses. The real and hooded Variant is standing behind Loki, who turns to face her. She removes her hood to reveal that she's a woman, and tells Loki that her plot isn't about him.

The timer counts down to zero and the lights go out. It initializes the charges scattered throughout the store and drop through small portals, and Mobius and the others see them.

At the TVA, the clerks detect dozens of branches shooting off of the Sacred Timeline.

Ravonna and her men get word of the fracture and head out into the timeline.

Lady Loki removes a monitor from the timer, and leaves via a portal, waving goodbye to Loki as she leaves. Mobius and the others arrive, and Loki sees them and goes through the portal after the Variant."

Sylvie isn't impressed, but C-20 says that the drinks seem fine. Sylvie talks about ""brain freeze"" freezing someone's memories in place, and C-20 take the challenge. She takes a drink from her ice-cold margarita, and doesn't remember when Sylvie asks her how many people are guarding the Time Keepers.

C-20 suddenly realizes that it's now night time instead of daytime, and Sylvie tells C-20 that they're best friends and asks C-20 again how many people are guarding the Time Keepers. C-20 starts to answer, but then remembers the bar and doesn't know Sylvie. Sylvie tells C-20 that she's probably just tired.

In the real world in the superstore security room, Sylvia enchants C-20 mind with an illusion, and Sylvie asks how she finds the elevator leading to the Time Keepers. As C-20 describes it, Sylvie sees a TVA squad approaching on the monitors.

Sylvie enters the TVA via a portal, walks down the hallway, and uses her enchanted touch on a Minuteman that she comes up to. Her touch has no effect, and the Minuteman attacks her. Sylvie fights back and disintegrates him with his own baton, and a group of three Minutemen come running. She takes them out in hand-to-hand.

Loki arrives through the portal and realizes where he is. He gets his daggers and goes looking for Sylvie, finds the unconscious Minutemen that she attacked.

Sylvie finds the elevator and knocks out the two Minutemen guarding it. Loki arrives and they prepare to fight as Sylvie draws her sword. He says that he has a few questions, and asks if she's sure she's a Loki. They fight and Loki tells Sylvie that he thought they could work together. He tells her that now he sees that she lacks vision, and when he grabs her Sylvia fights back.

Loki and Sylvie stop when Ravonna and two more Minutemen arrive. Sylvie puts her sword to Loki's throat and tells Ravonna that she'll kill him if Ravonna comes any closer. Ravonna tells Sylvie to go for it and runs forward to attack. Sylvie uses her tempad to create a portal beneath her and Loki, dropping them into a tent. The pad unit they used is damaged, and Sylvie grabs it first. Loki teleports behind her, knocks it out, and grabs the pad, then uses his magic to make it disappear.

Sylvie recovers and tells Loki that he doesn't know how to use the pad, and takes offense when he calls her a Loki. As they prepare to fight, a piece of rock comes through the ceiling and hits the floor between them. They go out and the planet they're on, Lamentis-1 in 20777, is being hit by falling meteor. Sylvie says that Lamentis the moon is about to crash into the planet overhead and destroy itself. As they dodge the meteors, Sylvie says that it's the worse apocalypse that had its coordinates stored on the pad, and they take cover beneath a truck. They run to a mining shack and take shelter inside, and Sylvie touches Loki's neck and uses her power.

Loki wonders what she's doing, then realizes that she's trying to enchant him. He says that it won't work because his mind is too strong, and they both draw their blades. Loki asks if they're going to fight again, and suggests that they call a truce to get the tempad working. Sylvie says that Loki needs her to recharge the pad, and figures that's why Loki helped her avoid the meteors. Loki agrees, and Sylvie says that as soon as she gets the pad on, she's going back to the TVA to finish what she started.

Sylvie says that there's power for the pad somewhere on the moon, and once they have it they can travel through time and space. She goes outside and Loki goes after her. He asks her what the plan is, and she says that there's a town nearby. Loki calls Sylvie ""Variant"", and she takes offense and tells him not to do it. She points out that Loki went to work for the ""boring"" TVA, and Loki insists that he's just a consultant.

Loki points out that Sylvie's plan was to create the ultimate power vacuum, and then walk away, and Sylvie doesn't respond to his barb. They arrive in the town, which appears uninhabited. Sylvie tells Loki that they have about twelve hours until the moon is destroyed, and things on Lamentis are only going to get worse.

The pair find a lit sign on a building, and Sylvie tells Loki to hand over the pad. He tells her that he's not giving it to her, and she'll have to try harder. Sylvie tells him that they'll need a large power source. They leave the town and come to a house, and Sylvie draws her sword and kicks in the front door. The woman inside shoots Sylvia with a blaster, knocking Sylvie back and on the ground.

Loki yells an apology, and the woman says that she enjoyed shooting Sylvie. He says that he did as well, and insists that they meant the woman no harm. The woman doesn't believe him, and Loki looks in, sees a photo of the woman and her husband Patrice, and uses his magic to take on the husband's appearance. Loki steps out and tells the woman that she's as beautiful as ever, and the woman shoots him back with the blaster.

The woman yells that Patrice never said that nice in 30 years, comes out, and asks what they want with her. Sylvie asks where everyone is, and the woman homesteader says that they're at the evacuation vessel. The female Loki figures the vessel would have enough energy to power the pad, and tells them that it's at the train station on the edge of town, but they'll never get a ticket. Sylvie heads there and Loki follows her.

At the station, people are lined up waiting for a ticket to evacuate on the train. Loki and Sylvie arrive, and Sylvie tells Loki that she's going to enchant a guard, have him lead them through the crowd, and have him shoot anyone that interferes. Loki says that he's doing it his way, and uses his illusion to don himself in a guard's uniform.

Loki takes Sylvie to the guard post, treating her like his prisoner. The guards let them through, but the next guard stops them and asks for their ticket. When Loki's attempt to bluff fails, Sylvie touches the guard and enchants him, and under his control he tells his superior coming over that headquarters radioed over a request for Loki and Sylvie that morning. The two guards let Loki and Sylvie through, and they sit down in a booth in a dining car.

Sylvie argues that Loki didn't have a plan, and when she yawns she says that she can't sleep around untrustworthy people. They talk about Loki's mother, Frigga, and he says that she taught him magic. Sylvie asks what Frigga was like, and Loki says that she was good, decent, and a queen of Asgard. Loki admits that he was adopted, and asks about Loki's mother. Sylvie says that she barely remembers her, and Loki reminiscences about his childhood with Frigga.

Loki demonstrates some of his magic for Sylvie, conjuring miniature fireworks. He says that Frigga was the kind of person he wanted someone to believe in him, and finally says that Frigga is dead. Loki asks where Sylvie learned to enchant people, and she says that she taught herself. He refuses to let her demonstrate on him, and a waitress comes over and offers them champagne.

After taking both glasses, Loki offers a toast to the end of the world and drinks. Sylvie brings up the subject of love, and Loki asks if Sylvie has someone, and they both admit that they ever had anything real. Loki says that love is something... he might have to have another drink to think about. Sylvie warns him that hijacking a civilization's power source isn't going to be easy, and they should rest. Loki tells her that he'll rest his way.

The train leaves, and Sylvie dozes off. She wakes up to find Loki leading a song, and he switches to a slower song and looks pensive. Loki switches back to the livelier song, then offers a toast to Sylvie. Sylvie goes over, figures Loki is drunk, and asks where his illusory uniform is. She reminds him that they're supposed to be laying low, and says that she saw some people looking weirdly at Loki. Loki says that he as an answer to her earlier question, conjures an illusion of a dagger, and says that love is like it.

Sylvie tells him that it's a horrible metaphor, and Loki makes the illusion disappear. A man who left comes back with guards, and the man points out Loki. One of the guards from the gate demands to see the couple's tickets, and Loki conjures fireworks. The guards aren't impresses, and Loki fights back when they try to lead him away. Sylvie joins the fight, and Loki throws his dagger at a guard who grabs Sylvie... and misses the guard and almost hits her.

Another guard attacks Loki, who kicks the guard out a window. Sylvie breaks free as two more guards grabs Loki and throw him out the window. She jumps out the window to get the tempad,

Loki gets up and finds Sylvie where she jumped off the train. She gets up, draws her sword, and tells Loki to give her the tempad. He conjures it to his hand but they discover that it's broken, and figures that they can fix it. Loki drops the pieces on the ground, and Sylvie tells him that he's a clown. She says that she's hedonistic, more than Loki, but never at the expense of the mission. Loki tells her that her mission is doomed and she can't beat the TVA.

Sylvie storms off and screams in rage, then sit down. Loki comes over and sits down next to Sylvie, and asks if her scream made her feel better. Sylvie says that did and Loki should try it sometime, and he asks what they do. She points out that Loki broke the tempad and the planet is about to crash into Lamentis. Sylvie explains that the evacuation ark is destroyed because it never leaves, and Loki points out that it never had them on it. They agree to hijack it and get off Lamentis before it's destroyed.

Loki and Sylvie walk along the train tracks, and Loki tries to get Sylvie to explain her powers. She refuses, and Loki tries to find out more about her. Sylvie says that she wants to use her secrets as a tactical advantage, and Loki says that he just needs to know that he can trust her. Convinced, Sylvie explains that she needs to make physical contact, and has problems with stronger minds. She creates a connection by creating a fantasy illusion from their memories.

Sylvie says that C-20's mind was so strong that she had to pull a memory from before C-20 joined the TVA. When Loki wonders what she means, Sylvie explains that C-20 used to be a regular person on Earth. Loki points out that he was told all the TVA workers were created, and Sylvie explains that all of the workers are Variants.

Before Loki can pursue the matter, the duo arrive at the city. They spot the ark ahead of the crowd, and Sylvie figures that they'll get to the ark by going around. Rioters fill the street, and meteors rain down. They go into a bar, fighting off rioters, and then continue on into the street. They approach the ark, and it's destroyed by debris."

A young Sylvie is playing in Asgard when Ravonna and three Minutemen portal in. Ravonna confirms that Sylvie is the variant they're looking for, and the Minutemen grab the girl while Ravonna says that they're arresting Sylvie for crimes against the Sacred Timeline. As they haul Sylvie away, the Minutemen activate a reset charge.

In the TVA, Ravonna takes Sylvie into the processing room. Another prisoner is hauled away, and Sylvie is processed and brought to the judge. Sylvie steals Ravonna's tempad, creates a portal, and escapes.

The Present

Ravonna meets with the three Time Keepers. Afterward, she leaves the chamber and Mobius asks Ravonna if she's okay. Ravonna says that she's not okay, and they blame her for the Lokis escaping. She says that the Time Keepers are all that stand between them and a temporal calamity, and Mobius says that if the Time Keepers want him to find the escapees, he needs access to C-20.

After Ravonna insists that it's impossible, Mobius says that he needs to find out what C-20 meant when she said repeatedly, ""It's real,"" and what else she saw when she was with Sylvie. Ravonna tells him that Sylvie enchanted C-20 and scrambled her mind, and doesn't want people to panic. She warns that they're all in danger and tells Mobius to find the Lokis, and then leaves.

On Lamentis, meteors from the planet crash down on the moon. Loki finds Sylvie sitting alone outside the city and sits down with her. Loki apologizes, and Sylvie says that she remembers a little of her life in Asgard before she was taken, and she was born the Goddess of Mischief. As soon as that created a big enough detour from the Sacred Timeline, the TVA took her prisoner and erased her reality. Sylvie stole a tempad, escaped, and ran for a long time. Everywhere she went created a nexus event and drew the attention of the TVA, and she learned to hide in the ends of a thousand worlds. Sylvie figures that she'll die on Lamentis.

At the TVA, the analysts are unable to locate the Lokis. B-15 asks Mobius if there's news on C-20, and he says that there isn't. The Hunter insists that they to find the Lokis, and Mobius tells her that they will.

Meteors continue raining down on Lamentis, and Loki and Sylvie watch. Loki figures that what makes a Loki a Loki is that they survive no matter what, and points out that Sylvie survived and almost took down the TVA. He says that she's amazing and takes Sylvie's hand.

The Analysts get a temporal lock.

A meteor crashes on the horizon, and the blast wave heads toward the Lokis. Loki and Sylvie brace themselves and smile at each other.

The TVA determine that the new nexus they locked onto is a major upheaval.

Minutemen arrive via portal and take Loki and Sylvie to the TVA, putting collars on them. The Minutemen take Sylvie away, and Mobius and Loki argue about who betrayed who. They take Loki to Mobius' theater and Mobius tells Loki that he's an asshole and a bad friend. A portal opens, and Loki tells Mobius that the TVA is lying to him. Mobius ignores Loki's accusation and has the Minutemen shove Loki through the portal

Loki finds himself in a plaza in Asgard. Sif comes out with part of her hair cut off from one of Loki's pranks, says that Loki did what happened, and slaps him. She tells him that he deserved to be alone and always will be, and beats Loki, and then walks away. Loki figures that he's in a ""bad memory prison"", and he was just having fun. The sequence repeats itself and Sif beats Loki again. Irritated, Loki figures that he's in a time loop. The sequence repeats itself, and Loki tells Sif that she's a recreation of a past event created by the TVA. He asks her to help him escape, and Sif beats him again.

Mobius visits Ravonna in her office and says that he wanted to meet with Sylvie while Loki is in the time cell. Ravonna refuses and tells Mobius to stick with Loki. He says that he thinks he can figure out what caused the spike if he works them against each other, but Ravonna refuses, saying that Sylvie is too dangerous.

Mobius leaves and goes to the theater where B-15 and her men are standing guard over Sylvie. B-15 asks Mobius if Loki said anything to him, and Mobius repeats Loki's accusation that the TVA is lying to him. He wonders why B-15 asked, and she claims that she's just doing her job.

When the sequence repeats itself again, Loki asks Sif to stop and says that he's a horrible person. Sif hesitates, and Loki tells her that he craves attention because he's a narcissist. Loki admits that he's scared of being alone, and Sif repeats her phrase of how he's alone and always will be. She walks off, and Mobius comes in and asks Loki if he's ready to talk.

Mobius portals Loki back to the theater, and tells him to expand on what Loki said earlier. Loki asks for his freedom before saying anything further, and Mobius figures that Loki was lying to him to barter for his freedom. Mobius asks how long Loki has been working for Sylvie, and Loki says that Sylvie is irritating and difficult and tries to hit him all the time.

Loki insists that he and Sylvie aren't partners, and Mobius continues questioning Loki about what caused the nexus event. When Loki refuses to talk, Mobius figures that they've reached a dead-end and prepares to send Loki back into the time loop. To avoid that, Loki lies and says that he was masterminding the entire operation. Loki says that Sylvie came to him on Asgard a long time ago, took her to one of her apocalypses, and they hatched their plan together.

When Mobius wonders what the plan is, Loki says that it's coming along nicely and Sylvie is a pawn. Loki tells Mobius that something big is going to happen and he'll dispose of Sylvie when it does, and Mobius tells him that Sylvie has already been pruned. When Loki asks what happened, Mobius says that Sylvie broke free, tried to escape, and B-15 had to prune her to stop her.

Loki says, ""Good riddance"", and Mobius chuckles and then points out that Loki likes Sylvie. He figures that Loki forming a romantic entanglement to a variant of himself is pure chaos, and Loki is an incredible narcissist. Loki angrily asks if Sylvie is alive, and Mobius says that she is... for now. The god says that his interests and Sylvie's are aligned, and finally tells Mobius that all of the TVA Hunters and Analysts are variants, and the Time Keepers erased their memories.

Explaining, Loki says that the variants can access their memories through enchantment. Mobius doesn't believe Loki, and tells Loki that he's closing the case because he doesn't need Loki anymore. As Minutemen come in and take Loki away, Loki tells Mobius that the latter is the biggest liar because he lies to himself. The Minutemen shove Loki through the portal into the time loop.

B-15 looks at a TVA poster on the wall. It says ""Verify Through Deletion"", and B-15 preps her pruning rod and then goes into Theater 47 where Sylvie is imprisoned. The Hunter puts away her rod and takes out a tempad, and creates a portal, and tells Sylvie to come with her. They go through the portal, Sylvie following B-15.

In Ravonna's office, Ravonna has Mobius sign paperwork and asks if he's good. Mobius says that he is and signs, closing the Loki case. They toast to the end of the case and Ravonna asks Mobius where he would go if he could go anywhere in any time. Mobius asks why she wouldn't let him interrogate Sylvie, and Ravonna points out that Loki got away during Mobius' first interrogation. Ravonna repeats her question, and Mobius dodges answering.

Ravonna tells Mobius that the Time Keepers want to oversee Sylvie's pruning, and want Mobius there. He asks her when she first noticed that C-20 died, and Ravonna insists that it's over and the Time Keepers are happy. Mobius points out that C-20 was fine when he saw her last, and Ravonna wonders what Mobius is getting at.

Mobius says that something seems off, and Ravonna tells him that she's trying to protect him. She didn't want to see Sylvie do anything to him, and she couldn't deal with the same thing happening to Mobius that happened to C-20. Ravonna says that Mobius has been spending too much time with Lokis, and insists that what they're doing matters because they're fighting for their friendship. She tells Mobius that friendship like theirs is uncommon, and they're fighting for it.

Her friend jokingly tells her she gave a good speech. As he asks where Ravonna is going to put her newest trophy, he swaps her tempad for another when she isn't looking. Mobius then excuses himself, saying that he's exhausted from dealing with all the Lokis. He says that he'll see Ravonna later up in the Time Keeper's chamber, and leaves.

B-15 and Sylvie arrive at the Roxxgate Superstore during the hurricane, and B-15 asks what Sylvie showed her when she was in her head earlier. Sylvie says that B-15's life is a lie created by TVA, and that she can only use memories already there. She tells B-15 that the Time Keepers took the Hunter's life from her and the others, and they're variants. Sylvie says that she and B-15 are the same, and B-15 tells Sylvie to show her and holds out her hand.

Sylvie takes B-15's hand and uses her powers. B-15 smiles as she remembers her original life, and remembers that she looked happy. When Sylvie stops, B-15 breaks into tears and asks what now.

Mobius goes to the library stacks for privacy, takes out Ravonna's tempad, and finds a file on C-20. There's also a video of her last interrogation, talking about her memories that Sylvie tapped into of the bar from C-20's previous life and how she had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline, and that she and Ravonna are both variants, and everyone in the TVA. Mobius confirms that Ravonna is there, and pockets the tempad.

Mobius enters Loki's time loop cell and tells Loki that the next nexus event that Loki and Sylvie cause will bring the TVA down. Loki swears that he believes Sylvie didn't put the memories in C-20, and asks if Mobius will trust the word of a friend. Mobius tells Loki that he was right about the TVA from the beginning, and he wants to save Sylvie then he has to trust Mobius. Loki agrees, and Mobius tells Loki that he can be good if he wants to be.

The two men leave the cell via portal into Mobius' theater, and find Ravonna and four Minutemen waiting for them. Ravonna asks for her tempad back from Mobius, and he claims he accidentally picked it up. He asks what the problem is, and then says that if could go to wherever he had a life before the TVA came along, he'd ride on his jet ski. Ravonna tells one of the Minutemen to prune Mobius, and the Minuteman does so.

The Minutemen take Loki to the gold elevator, while Ravonna goes to Sylvie's theater and confirms that B-15 was with the prisoner. B-15 has gone, and Ravonna tells the Minutemen to put an alert out on the Hunter because she's been compromised by Sylvie.

Minutemen take Sylvie to the gold elevator, and Ravonna joins them and Loki. Ravonna tells Loki and Sylvie up in the elevator to the Time Keepers' chamber, and Sylvie asks Ravonna if she remembers her. Ravonna says that she did, and Sylvie asks her why the arrested her. The judge asks why it matters, and Sylvie tells her that it was enough to take her life from her, and figures it was important. Ravonna tells Sylvie that she doesn't remember.

The trio emerge into the chamber where the seated Time Keepers are waiting. Loki dares them to kill him, and Sylvie says that the Keepers are scared of them. As Ravonna uses her rewind device and the collar on Sylvie to keep Sylvie from going forward, B-15 arrives, uses her remote to open the collars, and tosses Sylvie her sword.

The Minutemen on guard knock down B-15 and surround Loki and Sylvie. They fight, and Sylvie tosses Loki her sword to defend himself. She kills one Minuteman with his own rod and then fights Ravonna, who uses her own rod. Sylvie knocks out Ravonna, while Loki kills his opponents. He gives Sylvie her sword back, and she throws it and decapitates one of the Time Keepers. His head comes off, revealing that he's an android.

The remaining two Keepers shut down, and Loki wonders who created the TVA. Loki starts to tell Sylvie something, and says that they'll figure it out. She wonders why, and he says that it's new for him. Before Loki can say anything else, Ravonna recovers and prunes him with her rod. Ravonna lunges at Sylvie, who disarms Ravonna, takes her rod and threatens her with it. Ravonna tells Sylvie to do it, and Sylvie says that she isn't and that Ravonna is going to tell her everything.

Loki wakes up in the ruins of New York City, Avengers Tower in the background. He wonders if he's in Hel and if he's dead, and four Lokis--Boastful, Classic, Kid, and Alligator--are there. Boastful says that Loki will be dead if he doesn't come with them."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10161338/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"Loki tries to escape The Void, a desolate purgatory where he meets variant versions of himself.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Kate Herron'],"['', '', '']",[],"['throg the marvel comics character', 'miss minutes character', 'end of time']",[],"Loki wakes up from being pruned and finds himself facing four variants of himself: Classic, Boastful, Kid, and Alligator Loki. Getting to his feet, Loki asks where he is. A giant smoke-like being is approaching them, and Classic tells Loki that they have to go. The five Lokis run away as the creature roars at them.

In the Time Keeper's chamber, Sylvie tells Ravonna to give her her tempad. Ravonna does so, and says that she has no idea who is behind the TVA. Sylvie points out that Ravonna's reality has been destroyed, just like Sylvie's was, and Ravonna tells Sylvie that Loki isn't dead. She says that she's telling Sylvie willingly because she wants to know who is at the top of the TVA as well, and who lied to her.

Sylvie lowers her rod, and Ravonna explains that when the TVA prunes a branches reality, it's impossible to destroy all of its matter. They transfer it to the Void at the end of time, where reality collides and everything stops. Beyond, the Time Keepers are transforming reality into utopia, or so the dogma has it. Ravonna says that nothing ever comes back from the Void, and tells Sylvie that she can help her if Sylvie trusts her. Sylvie considers and then gives Ravonna her tempad back.

In the Void, the five Lokis head away from the being, and Loki yells at them to explain what is going on. Kid conjures a sword on Loki, getting his attention, and then explains that the Void is where TVA dumps everything that they prune. Alioth, the smoke being, makes sure that nothing returns. Classic explains that there are so many of them together because Lokis survive. The variants explain that there's nothing to do in the Void but survive.

The variants move on, and Loki asks why Kid gives the orders and what his nexus event was. Kid says that he killed Thor, leaving Loki speechless. The variant reach a hidden bunker and all six Lokis go inside. Classic asks Loki why he wants to return to the TVA so badly, and Loki says that he wants to live his glorious purpose there.

Ravonna has Miss Minutes access restricted files from the archives, on the beginning of time and the founding of the TVA. Sylvie suggests that there's something at the end of time, beyond the Void, and that it would be impossible to create a nexus event when time is being written. Ravonna warns that it's impossible to get past the void because there's nothing for the tempad to lock onto, and Sylvie says that they go through the Void.

When Ravonna warns that it's impossible, Miss Minutes suggests the prototype Void spacecraft. The AI brings up the file on the spacecraft, and Ravonna tells Sylvie that the spacecraft was designed to withstand the Void. Ravonna suggests that they find the person responsible for TVA and kill him. She offers her hand to Sylvie, who reluctantly takes it.

Miss Minutes says that the spacecraft files are buried deep, and Ravonna admits that she might not have clearance. Sylvie isn't convinced, and Minutemen break in. Sylvie takes cover and Ravonna calls to Sylvie that they know where she hides so she can't run. Ravonna suggests that Sylvie come out and they can talk about where the person behind the TVA betrayed Ravonna.

Ravonna motions the Minutemen forward and offers to put Sylvie in a time loop with good memories. Sylvie says that she has just one good memory, pockets Ravonna's tempad, then prunes herself with the rod. Ravonna tells the Minutemen that Sylvie is dead as well and walks away.

In the bunker, the Lokis drink and Boastful talks about how he vanquished Iron Man and Captain America, claimed the Infinity Stones. Alligator doesn't believe him, and attacks Boastful when Boastful says that Alligator's nexus event was eating the wrong neighbor's cat. Loki wonders how Classic survived Thanos, and Classic explains that he cast a projection of himself that Thanos thought he was killing Thanos. Then Classic hid as debris, drifted in space away from everything, and removed himself from the universe because he realized only pain followed him. He stayed on a remote planet in solitude for a long time, but when he got lonely he left. That was when the TVA found and captured him.

Classic says that their role is as the God of Outcasts, and Loki says that he's going back to the TVA, figuring that the Lokis are good at escaping as well as surviving. When Classic tells Loki that he'll just be brutally murdered, Loki says that if that was his destiny, that will be what happens. He tells the variant Lokis that he's the same as all of them. Loki confirms that none of them have met a female Loki, and Sylvie is different because she's trying to take the TVA down instead of taking it over, and she needs Loki. He figures that if Alioth lives, he can kill it, and could use their help. The other Lokis laugh, and Loki walks out in disgust. He opens the bunker hatch, and finds President Loki and his supporters waiting.

Sylvie wakes up in the Void in an abandoned bus, and makes her way out. Alioth crashes down nearby and Sylvie runs. When it tries to grab her, she uses her enchantment powers on her and gets a brief vision of the end of time beyond the Void. She continues running and a pizza delivery truck drives up ahead of her. It pulls up and Sylvie gets in, and discovers that Mobius is driving. Mobius drives away from the pursuing Alioth.

President and his men enter the bunker, and Boastful admits that he betrayed the other locals and now he's king. When President's men draw their weapons, Boastful is shocked that President would betray him, and President's men turn on him. Alligator leaps on President's hand and bites it off, and the President's men attack. Boastful fights back, while Classic teleports himself, Kid, Loki, and Alligator out.

Outside, Classic complains about the betrayal, and figures that every version of Loki is broken. Loki insists that nothing can change until the TVA is stopped, and Sylvie is the only one he trusts. Kid and Classic finally agree to help Loki, but Classic says that all they'll do is get Loki to Alioth and that's as far as they go.

Mobius escapes Alioth, and tells Sylvie that he thought the TVA were the good guys. Sylvie insists that she did what she had to do, and Mobius apologizes for ""hunting her like a dog"": She figures that Alioth already got Loki, and the only thing that matters is escaping the Void and finding out who is behind the TVA. Mobius wonders how they do that, and Sylvie tells him to turn around because it might hold the key to escaping. Sighing wearily, Mobius turns the truck around.

The four Lokis walk toward Alioth, and Loki figures that they get inside it and do it in. The USS Eldridge crashes down in front of them, and Alioth goes for it. Loki figures that they can sneak around Alioth while it's occupied with the ""big meal"". Alioth destroys the ship and its crew with its touch, and Loki, watching, figures they'd better think about their plan.

The truck approaches them, and Mobius parks it and Sylvie gets out and approaches the Lokis. Loki runs over to Mobius and Sylvie and asks what happened, and Loki introduces the other three Lokis. He says that they plan to kill Alioth, and Sylvie tells him that Alioth is protecting the only way out of the Void. She explains that she's going to enchant Alioth.

At the TVA, Ravonna visits the imprisoned B-15. B-15 asks why she's locked up, and Ravonna tells the Hunter that she was disloyal to the TVA. The prisoner insists that the people need to know the truth, and Ravonna insists that the TVA needs stability. Ravonna says that since B-15 had a link with Sylvia, B-15 needs to tell Ravonna what drives Sylvie. B-15 tells Ravonna that Sylvie will be searching for whoever created the fake Time Keepers, and figures that Ravonna wants to find whoever is behind the TVA's creation .The hunter says that Ravonna will never find the creator before Sylvie does, because Ravonna only wants it by Sylvie needs it.

Ravonna leaves and summons Miss Minutes to get her all the files on the founding of the TVA from the beginning of time. Miss Minutes agrees when Ravonna says that whoever created the TVA is in danger, and she needs to find them.

In the Void, the group stops in a ruin for shelter, and Mobius admits that he doesn't remember the TVA ever capturing Alligator. Mobius says that he's turning on the thing he devoted his life to, and Kid hopes that Loki and Sylvie know what they're doing.

Loki and Sylvie sit outside and Loki conjures a blanket to keep himself warm. He offers to conjure one for Sylvie, and they both agree that Mobius' theory about Sylvie's nexus event of the two of them becoming romantically involves is rubbish and another TVA lie. Sylvie admits that she doesn't have anyone close, but she has more important things like bringing down the TVA and saving the universe.

With a gesture, Loki conjures his blanket around Sylvie. She accepts it, and then thanks Loki. He tells her that it's his pleasure. Sylvie asks how she knows that Loki won't betray her, and Loki tells her that he betrayed everyone who ever loved him, and that's not who he is anymore. He tells Sylvie that he won't let her down, and Sylvie says that if the TVA is gone, there might be a timeline for Loki to rule. Loki says that then he'd finally be happy, and they both smile.

Loki asks Sylvie what she'll do when it's all over, and she admits that she doesn't know. He says that he doesn't know, either, and suggests that they figure it out together. Sylvie only says ""maybe"".

The five Lokis and Mobius seek out Alioth, and Sylvie says that Alioth knows where the creator of the TVA is. She thinks if she can get close enough to it, she can link to Alioth, and it will take her to whoever is responsible. Sylvie gives Loki the tempad she stole so that he can escape, and Loki says that he's staying and he's going with Sylvie. Loki gives the tempad to Mobius, and Classic and Kid tell Mobius that they're staying there in their home.

Kid gives Loki his flaming sword, and Classic wishes Loki luck. The three variant Lokis leave, and Mobius summons a portal. He tells Loki that he'll burn the TVA to the ground, and thanks Loki for the ""spark"". Loki hugs Mobius and thanks his friend, and then Mobius goes through the portal.

Loki and Sylvie approach Alioth, waiting for a branch. When one doesn't happen, Sylvie tells Loki that they'll have to create a distraction. Loki puts a hand on her shoulder, nods, and runs off swinging the sword to get Alioth's attention. As it moves toward him, Sylvie grabs a smoke tendril and tries to enchant the creature. Alioth continues moving toward Sylvie, and Loki yells at it to follow him

Classic returns and creates a projection of Asgard's buildings, drawing Alioth's attention. It consumes the building, and Classic uses all of his magic to maintain it as long as he can. Loki joins Sylvie and figures that they're stronger than they realize. Sylvie and Loki join hands and enchant Alioth, which consumes Asgard, and then the weakened Classic as he yells ""Glorious purpose!"" and laughs triumphantly.

Alioth turns to Loki and Sylvie, and they manage to disperse it and create a gate out of the Void. They then walk through... together."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10161342/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,The clock is ticking in the season finale which finds Loki and Sylvie on a date with destiny.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Kate Herron'],"['', '', '']",[],"['kang the conqueror character', 'end of time', 'miss minutes character']",[],"Loki and Sylvie stand at a castle on a planetoid, beyond the Void. They approach the main doors, and Sylvie asks Loki if he thinks it's a bad idea if she kicks them in. He says that he doesn't think that, and he asks if Sylvie is okay when she hesitates. Sylvie tells him that she needs a moment, and says that she's been waiting for the moment her entire life and just needs a minute to get her head straight.

The doors open and Loki and Sylvie go in. There is a vast hallway, and as they start to go down it, Miss Minutes appears before them. She welcomes them to the Citadel at the End of Time, and says that He Who Remains is impressed. The AI explains that He created all and controls all... at the end of time. He wants to offer Loki and Sylvie a deal, and has worked it out so he can insert them back into the timeline in a way that won't disrupt things. Miss Minutes says that the TVA can keep doing its vital work, and Loki and Sylvie can live the lives they always wanted.

Loki will be allowed to win against the Avengers, kill Thanos, and gain the Infinity Gauntlet and Asgard. Sylvie will have a lifetime of happy memories and the two Lokis together. Miss Manners assures them that He can make it work and they can have it all together. Sylvie says that it's a fiction, and Loki insists that they write their own destinies. Miss Manners wishes them good luck and disappears, and Loki and Sylvie continue on.

At the TVA, Ravonna is in her office collecting her files. Miss Manners appears and says that she's downloading the files Ravonna needs. Ravonna confirms that the files aren't what she asked for, and Miss Manners says that He thinks the files Ravonna got will be more useful. With that, the AI disappears.

Loki and Sylvie reach a chamber covered in dust, and a door opposite where they came in opens and reveals He. He's amused and impressed that there are two Lokis there, and says that the name Miss Manners gave him is creepy but he likes it. They take the elevator up to He's office, and He assures them that he's flesh and blood. Sylvie swings at He with her sword, and he disappears before she can hit him. He reappears and then disappears, chuckling, before Sylvie can hit him.

The elevator arrives at He's office, and the Lokis find He waiting for them. He pours coffee and invites them to take a seat, and they hesitantly sit down.

Mobius enters Ravonna's office, and she figures that if anyone could make it back from the Void, it would be Mobius. She says that the pruned Mobius because she couldn't let him get in the way of their mission, and says that it can't be for nothing. Ravonna calls in a Hunter, and Mobius tells her that it won't work now that they know her secret. Mobius' former friend wonders what he's done.

In Fremont, Ohio, 2018, Hunters pursue B-15 through a school. B-15 goes into an office and a Hunter corners her. She tells him that he has to listen to her, but he refuses. The principal whose office it is comes in and wonders what's going on. She looks just like Ravonna, and B-15 tells the Hunter that the principal isn't Ravonna, and they have a lot to talk about.

Loki tells He that he's lost, and Sylvie comes at He. He teleports out of reach of Sylvie, and takes out a script of what they've said and done, and will do. After assuring them that he knows they don't kill him and He has programmed his tempad with that knowledge, He says that he knows everything they've done, and that he ""paved the road"" so that they would get where they are.

He shows them more pages, saying that there's only one way it can go. When Sylvie wonders why they're there, He says that it's about the journey. Loki figures that it's a manipulation, and He finds it interesting that Loki would consider it manipulation. He asks Sylvie if she trusts Loki, or thinks she can trust anyone at all.

Ravonna insists to Mobius that the TVA is a necessary lie, and she believes whoever created the TVA had a reason. She insists that they have to prune the timeline to prevent chaos, and that only the person in charge has free will. Mobius accuses Ravonna of betraying him, and Ravonna tells him that he betrayed her. He turned to the Variants, throwing away their friendships. Ravonna creates a portal and says she's doing what she has to. Mobius turns on his pruning rod, and Ravonna tells him that he's no danger to her. He stabs at her, and Ravonna blocks his blow, disarms him, and kicks him to the floor.

Mobius tells Ravonna to prune him. She deactivates the rod instead, grabs her bag, tells Mobius she's going to go in search of free will, and leaves through the portal.

He admits that his methods are deceptive, but without the TVA, everything burns. Loki asks what He is afraid of, and he says that he's afraid of himself. Sylvie wonders who He is, and He tells them that it's not as simple as a name. He explains that a Variant of himself once lived on the 31st century, and he discovered that there were other versions. Other He's learned the same thing, made contact, and for a while there was peace as they shared technology and knowledge.

Some He's weren't so pure of heart, and became conquerors. Each Variant fought to preserve his universe and annihilate the others. The first Variant encountered a creature capable of consuming time and space: Alioth. He weaponized Alioth and ended the multiversal war, isolated their timeline, and prevented any other branches by creating the TVA.

He says that he keeps them safe, and if they want to see evil then they should meet his Variants. He tells them that something worse will replace him if they depose him, and the TVA is the only scenario that works. Sylvie suggests that He is a liar, and He tells them that if they kill him then they'll have to deal with an infinite number of Variants... or they run the place.

Loki wonders why He would give up being in control, and He says that he's tired and older than he looks. He says that the ""game"" is for the young and the hungry, and the persons best-suited to take his place are Loki and Sylvie. They can take over and return to the TVA as its benevolent rulers. Sylvie accuses him of treating people as pawns, and He says that it was practical, not personal. When she tells him that it was personal to her, He calls her a murderer and a hypocrite, and they're all villains.

He says that now they can do horrific things for a good reason. Thunder rumbles and the lights dim, and He says that they just crossed the threshold. He says that he doesn't know how everything is going to go, and they've reached the point where his knowledge of the future ends. Outside, the timeline starts branching.

Loki wonders if that's it, and wonders if He is going to let them decide his fate. He tells them that he is, and either they let him live or they kill him and another Variant of him takes his place. Sylvie thinks He is lying to them, and He says that it's no lie.

Sylvie lunges at He, and Loki stops her and says that they should talk about it. Loki pulls her back with his magic, and parries her blow when she swings at him. Loki says that he's a liar, and doesn't think He is lying. Sylvie figures that Loki wants He's throne, and Loki wonders if they will unleash something worse by killing He. Loki insists that it's not about a throne, but Sylvie calls herself a fool for ever trusting Loki. Loki figures that Sylvie never trusted him, and what's going on is bigger than their experience.

When Sylvie wonders why they're seeing it the same way, Loki tells her that she can't trust and he can't be trusted. Loki wants to wait, and Sylvie attacks him with her sword and he defends himself. Sylvie tells Loki to kill her and take his throne, then kicks him when he refuses. They continue fighting, and Loki teleports in front of her blade and drops his own sword as she prepares to kill He.

Loki asks Sylvie to stop, and says that he feels what she feels and has been where she has been. All he knows is that he just wants Sylvie to be okay. Sylvie drops her sword and they kiss, and then Sylvie tells Loki that she's not him, opens a portal, and shoves Loki through it back to a theater in the TVA.

Sylvie closes the portal before Loki can come back through, and she asks He if he's going to beg for his life. He doesn't, and Sylvie runs him through the chest. He dies and nothing happens, and Sylvie collapses to the floor in exhaustion and despair. Outside, the timeline continues branching.

At the TVA, Mobius and B-15 monitor the branching timeline. They recite the TVA's oath.

Loki sits in the theater and mourns. He then gets up and goes out, and finds the Hunters mobilizing. Loki finds Mobius and B-15 discussing the branching, and Loki yells that they can't stop it. He explains what happened to Mobius, and different Variants of a dangerous person are coming. Mobius has no idea who Loki is because of the alterations in the timeline, and Loki looks at the statue of He that has replaced the statues of the Time Keepers."

We first see Frank chasing down a pair of Dogs of Hell bikers on an Alabama backroad, then running them over with a van. Some weeks later, he snipes a cartel member who was there that day in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico...from across the border in El Paso. Lastly, he takes out the last surviving member of the Kitchen Irish by strangling him in a toilet stall at John F. Kennedy International Airport as he's preparing to leave for Dublin. His revenge complete, Frank tosses his skull vest in a trash can and burns it.

Six months later, Frank is laying low in New York City, working on a construction site in Brooklyn under the assumed name 'Pete Castiglione'. He spends his days continuously hacking away at walls with a sledgehammer to vent his built-up rage, and also puts up with the bullying of his colleagues. Nevertheless, Frank manages to make a friend in the form of a new recruit, Donny Chavez, who lives in Queens with his grandmother after his parents were killed in a car accident.

Frank doesn't completely separate himself from his past life. On a regular basis, he travels into Manhattan to pay visits to his friend Curtis Hoyle, a former Navy Corpsman and insurance salesman who runs a support group for veterans. Curtis, who lost the lower part of his left leg to a suicide bomber and now sports a prosthetic, is the only person from the old days that Frank has maintained contact with since faking his death. Curtis seeks to provide Frank with some words of wisdom and also passes him literature to read from time to time. He is also in the midst of trying to assist Lewis Wilson, a discharged Army veteran who feels rejected by the country and is visibly suffering from PTSD.

Over in Manhattan, Special Agent Dinah Madani reports to work at the Department of Homeland Security's New York field office. She has returned to New York City after a posting in Afghanistan. Her top case is the murder of her partner Ahmed Zubair, an Afghan National Police officer who was kidnapped by US soldiers he caught trafficking heroin, tortured on video, shot in the head execution-style, and buried in an unmarked grave. When she tries to convince the Special Agent in Charge Carson Wolf that this case has merits, he shoots her down citing the case as off-limits. Nevertheless, Dinah turns to her newly assigned partner Sam Stein for help. She asks him to dig up everything on file concerning Colonel Schoonover, last year's explosion and drug bust at the docks, and everything they have on Frank. It can't be a coincidence that Frank and Schoonover died one day and twenty miles from each other within New York City limits, and believes both had something to do with Ahmed's death. It's clear that Ahmed's murder is weighing heavily on Madani, as shown later when she opens up to her mom, a psychiatrist on the Upper West Side, about her lack of faith in the legal system.

Meanwhile, Frank finds Donny trying to make friends with Lance, the leader of the workers who regularly harass Frank. Lance, it turns out, owes money to a loan shark from the Gnucci crime family, who is threatening to break his legs and seize his car. His buddy Paulie manages to get patched in from his cousin about a poker game being held by one of the Gnucci capos. It should be a simple job with a jackpot of $70,000. None of the players will be armed as no guns are allowed at the table. The only gun is held by the single guard at the door. Lance and his crew are able to persuade Donny to join along with them for the robbery.

The robbery doesn't go smoothly, as in the midst of frantically scooping cash up from the poker table, Donny accidentally drops his wallet, revealing his driver's license to the capo in charge of the game. With the gangsters now knowing Donny's real name, Lance and his buddies take Donny back to the construction site and decide to drown him in the cement mixer. They are stopped by Frank, who proceeds to kill Lance and his friends with his sledgehammer, after getting Lance to give up the location of the poker game. After dropping a rope to Donny, Frank heads to the poker game and guns down all of the gangsters in attendance just as they're getting ready to hunt Donny and torture him for the names of his accomplices. He doesn't notice that his departure from the scene afterwards has been caught on a surveillance camera, which is being monitored by David ""Micro"" Lieberman. Confirming that he is indeed seeing Frank by comparing the footage from the Gnucci shootout to footage from Frank's attack on Karen Page and Grotto at Metro-General Hospital last year, David smiles and says, ""Welcome back, Frank..."""

He tosses in the dead body of a man wrapped in a sheet.

In the town jail, Deputy Linda checks on Sheriff Duke, napping in a cell. He goes out on a call.

In the Sweetbriar Rose diner, owner Rose Twitchell pours Councilman James ""Big Jim"" Rennie a cup of coffee, he pays with a hundred, joking that he's buying her next vote.

In a house, in bed, a teenager named Angie finishes having sex with Junior. He says he loves her. ""Yea, it's been a fun summer,"" she says. Ouch.

He tells she's the only one who knows the real him and he's not returning to college, she says that's why she can't be with him. She tries to leave and he grabs her a little too hard. She leaves for work.

Elsewhere, Julia Shumway, the new editor of ""The Independent,"" responds to a call from a busybody. An oil tanker is making its fourth trip today, yesterday it made six. She thinks it's terrorism. She says Sheriff Duke said it was the town hall restocking. But, when he told her, he sounded nervous, which isn't like him.

The fire trucks leave town for a parade.

Barbie speeds out of the woods and calls someone, saying there's a problem, their guy tried to renegotiate ""aggressively."" Sheriff Duke and Deputy Linda pass him and run his plate.

He's watching them drive away when he fails to notice the cows in the road. He crashes into a ditch in their pasture. He's standing there, angry about not having a spare tire, when birds fly off into the air and the ground starts to shake.

In town, car alarms go off, church bells ring, the wind blows and objects crash to the floor. Duke stops his car, gripping his chest.

Suddenly, there's a loud thump out in the cow pasture. Barbie watches with shock as a cow is sliced in two, seemingly by nothing, and dirt flies in the air. He sees a nearby barn is sliced in two, and the land in front of him is blurry.

A young teen named Joe, who lives in the house by the pasture, goes to inspect the dome. It's some sort of invisible fence. He's discovered it only zaps the first time.

Duke's pacemaker gives him trouble, he says it must have skipped a beat. He and Linda start getting calls from all over town.

Joe and Barbie watch as a plane inside the dome crashes into it. Plane parts and body parts rain down around them, Barbie tackles Joe out of the way of the debris.

They check the victim's ID, Joe recognizes it as the woman from the bank.

Barbie sees a fire truck from outside the dome speeding toward them. They can't hear the sirens. He flags it down to stop before it crashes into the dome. A fireman gets out and runs smack into it, cracking his nose. Barbie holds up a sign telling him to call the FAA.

At the radio station, Dodee realizes DJ Phil Bushey is the only one on the air.

Duke and Linda reach the dome. Linda's fiancé Rusty, a firefighter, is on the other side. They can't hear each other.

Big Jim arrives, recognizing Chuck Dodson's plane. Duke gets more calls. They realize it cut off all the roads into town. ""We're trapped,"" Big Jim says.

They take out a map and start assessing the situation. Jim tries to order Julia to leave, Linda commandeers her car.

In town, Carolyn tries to pump gas, but the power's out. She and her wife Alice are taking their teenage daughter Norrie to camp and were just passing through.

In the woods, Barbie shows Julia the boundaries of the dome. He thinks they might be stuck in there awhile. He thinks even if they get out, the army will quarantine Chester's Mill. He's ex-military. They come up to a house and see a woman stumbling outside -- the dome sliced her arm off.

Big Jim commandeers the radio station and tells everyone driving to stop their car.

Driving down the road, Carolyn turns the radio on. They think it's a stunt until they see a truck on the other side of the dome crash into it. Carolyn slams on the brakes. Norrie collapses on the ground and has a seizure, saying something about the stars falling.

Back home, Angie and Joe meet up. Their dad is a trucker still out on the road, their mom left a note. She's having brunch in Westlake, on the other side of the dome. They're on their own.

Julia takes the injured woman to the hospital, expecting her husband Peter, a doctor, to be working there. She's told he hasn't work Sundays in months.

Linda watches as the army arrives on the other side in hazmat suits.

From a distance, Junior watches Angie bum a cigarette off Barbie and seethes with rage, flipping his folding knife.

Alice and Carolyn drive up to the medical center with Norrie and yell for help.

Back at town hall, Jim notes he's the only elected official inside the dome. He suggests that as a councilman he has the power to authorize additional policemen. Duke thinks it's a terrible idea. Jim asks if they're going to tell people why they have all the gas.

""So should we tell them the truth?"" Jim says. ""That's your business, I have no idea what the hell you wanted with all that crap,"" Duke says.

Duke says he only did what he needed to keep the town safe. Jim cautions him not to stress his bad heart, a veiled threat.

Dodee scans radio frequencies and hears snippets of all sorts of things, including someone calling it a dome.

Out in the pasture late at night, Junior approaches Barbie, wanting to start something. Barbie warns him it's a bad idea. Julie interrupts them. She still hasn't found her husband.

When Barbie says the hotels are booked and he's going to rough it, she insists he stay with her.

On a bridge leading out of town, there's a rager late at night. Kids have already heard Joe's all alone. While others are partying, Joe is inspecting the dome with a flash light. He thinks it must have it's own power source.

Suddenly Joe collapses and has a seizure, just like Norrie, he starts saying ""stars are falling in lines"" over and over again.

Angie comes home to a dark house. She's lighting a candle when Junior grabs her. ""If you do everything I say, I promise you won't get hurt,"" he says, holding a knife to her throat.

She runs and he grabs her, accidentally knocking her out.

The town gathers at the Sweetbriar Rose for information. Duke announces 12 people died. He tells people to check on their neighbors.

Angie wakes up in a basement with a puddle on the floor. When Junior comes in the metal room, she starts screaming. He tells her they're in his dad's old fallout shelter and she's ""safe.""

He assures she'll thank him someday since he's the only person who understands what's going on. She tries to run, but he locks her in. He puts a bolt on the shelter from above ground. Her screams don't make it out.

Junior's dad comes to check on him -- Big Jim. Junior tells him the shelter is totally flooded.

Julia brings Barbie home to her house. Her power is running on a back-up generator.

Julia points out a photo of her husband Peter on the mantle. It's the man Barbie buried. She thinks her husband isn't there because he's having an affair. She's sure he'll turn up.

Out on the street, Duke and Linda survey the damage. Duke wonders if they're being punished. He tells Linda there's a lot he's tried to protect her from about Chester's Mill. He puts his hand on the dome and starts to tell her: ""A little over a year ago, I was approached about..."" Then his chest sparks and he collapses.

Outside the dome, news reports call it an ""unparalleled"" event. The camera pulls back and shows the dome covering the entire town."

Then Peter pulls a gun. Barbie talks him down enough to get close to him and disarm him. They grapple again and Barbie's dog tags get yanked off in the struggle. Barbie draws his gun, as they're wrestling the gun goes off. Peter gets shot, dead.

Barbie wakes up from his nightmare in Julia Shumway's guest room. With her husband Peter missing, she's happy for his company. Barbie wonders where his dog tags went.

At the edge of the dome, Linda cries over Duke's body and quickly starts giving orders, including to her deputy Paul, who seems unhinged.

A few people try digging down to get under the edge of the dome. Joe decides to use his trig skills to figure out what he can about it.

At the radio station, Dodee scans the frequencies and again hears it called a ""dome."" Phil wants to tell people, but she thinks it'll just freak them out.

At SweetBriar Café, Jim Rennie hooks up a generator for Rose. Alice and Carolyn come downstairs in the middle of the night and mention their daughter's seizure. Alice has seen them before, she's a psychiatrist. Linda comes by with the news that Duke is dead.

Outside her house, Julia tries to get the attention of the military on the other side, throwing a ball off the dome. Barbie is sure they're under orders to ignore people inside. Julia decides to head to the radio station.

Down in Junior's scary bomb shelter tomb, Angie waits for Junior to come down and pushes past him. She gets up to the shelter door, but he has it locked. He carries her back downstairs and chains her to the bed. He explains he just wants her to go back to being the Angie he knew yesterday. He lays out his jealousy over Barbie and promises her she'll love him again.

Then she changes tactics, telling her Barbie ""screwed her brains out"" and Junior will never be the man he is. Junior leaves, fully wound up.

Over Duke's body, Linda mentions to Big Jim what Duke said about there being things about Chester's Mill he needed to protect her from. Reverend Lester Coggins is also the undertaker.

When Linda leaves, Big Jim throws Lester against the wall and accuses him of being high as a kite on their stuff. Lester says he might as well, it's judgment day. He says Duke only went along to save Chester's Mill, but at least they don't have to worry about him talking now.

Joe explains to Barbie that he has calculated that the dome is about 10 miles across.

Linda finds Jim going through Duke's files. He shows her Duke's will. He left her everything, including his house.

Jim joins Lester back in his car and tells him he had a close call but couldn't find anything about propane in Duke's files, it must be at his house. Lester leaves to try to get there before Linda.

At the radio station, Dodee shows Julia the harmonic microwave frequency converter she made that lets her pick up signals. Julie hears the word ""dome"" and immediately goes on the radio to announce it.

At the café after the broadcast, Linda tries to calm people down, including her increasingly paranoid deputy Paul. She worries about her fiancé Rusty on the other side of the Dome. His brother Freddie, another deputy, tells her Rusty is taking her to Hawaii for their honeymoon.

Rev. Coggins comes by to offer his prayers to Linda, and lift her keys.

Driving down the road, Jim blocks a man in a front loader, stopping him from getting zapped by the dome.

Joe finds scientists blasting the dome with water. Joe touches the dome on the other side and pulls his hand away wet. It lets water through like a sieve.

Barbie stocks up on cigarettes, telling Norrie they'll be good for trade later. Junior stalks him as he leaves.

Dodee picks up the military saying they don't know the origin of the dome. So if not the military, who's responsible?

Barbie goes back to the cabin where he fought with Peter. He finds a gun, but it's empty. He finds his dog tags on the floor.

Junior finds him there and accuses him of sleeping with Angie. He decks Barbie, who tries to simply run him off, but ends up tackling him and punching him several times when Junior won't quit.

Rev. Coggins rifles through Duke's things at his house and finds the papers he was looking for. He takes Duke's cigar and burns the papers in a trash can. But the fire quickly leaps from the can to nearby drapes and soon the whole house is going up.

Paul stops Linda and gives her bigger guns. He's getting more paranoid and pulls his gun when he sees Barbie nearby in the woods. They hear a call about a fire at Duke's house.

Jim hears it over the radio and knows Rev. Coggins is involved. He gets to the house first and hears Coggins crying for help inside. He does nothing. Barbie directs people to grab their garden hoses and anything that can hold water. If it spreads, the whole town is at risk.

Linda hears someone inside and busts down the door. She finds Rev. Coggins passed out inside and drives him off.

Jim drives off.

The propane tank next to the house blows.

People make a chain passing buckets to put out the fire. Joe films it with his phone.

The fire spreads to the fence and then a nearby car.

Jim drives up on the front loader and starts to tear down Duke's house to keep the fire from spreading more.

Down in the fallout shelter, Junior shows up bruised and bloodied and tells Angie he killed Barbie. She doesn't believe him, saying even he couldn't do something that terrible.

He leaves her with a filmstrip of them together.

Back at fire, Julie notes that Barbie has his dog tags back.

Jim checks on Rev. Coggins, who says he was cleaning up their mess. When Linda comes over, he says he was looking for a suit to bury Duke in. He says there was a short that sparked.

The gathered town applauds Jim and Linda. Jim commends them for banding together.

Linda's pessimistic deputy Paul goes off on a rant, saying they're trapped. Paul draws his gun, Joe keeps filming as Paul says the dome is never going to go away and they're all going to die.

Paul shoots the dome, the bullet ricochets and hits Freddie, killing him. Barbie disarms Paul. The remains of the house smolder."

Other kids are skating off the dome, but Joe is watching the footage of Deputy Paul shooting Freddy.

Julia drives Barbie to the police station, where Deputy Linda is marching Phil into lock-up. Julia asks Linda if she can handle things. Someone throws a bottle in Phil's direction. Big Jim addresses the crowd, telling everyone to cool off.

Norrie shows up, having followed some kids to the skate park. She asks Joe if she can recharge her phone at his house, then asks if she can stay there too. She claims not to know the two women (her mothers) that Joe saw her with.

Linda brings Paul back to a holding cell. He starts gasping for air and she goes to check on him. He wheels around and knocks her over, taking her gun. He says the dome is making people crazy and he has to get out of there before people get him.

At home, Big Jim asks his son Junior where he was when the town banded together to battle the fire. He tells Junior that his not being around reflected poorly on him. He notices Junior's shiner. Junior tells him Barbie did it and he's crazy. ""Nine years since your mother died and still it's like you're hiding behind her skirt,"" Jim says.

Down in the bunker, Angie listens to DJ Phil mention the fire on the radio. Junior brings her eggs, telling her it's the dome that's making her act like this. She asks if anyone has tried going under the dome through the cement factory tunnels. She cozies up to him, reminding him of when they used to go down there. She suggests they could start over if he could find a way out.

Jim visits Rev. Coggins in the hospital, telling him the only files that can implicate them ""on this drug business"" is in their head.

Julie explains her husband Peter grew up in Chester's Mill and ""circumstances shift and it just made sense"" for them to come and start over.

Julia offers to introduce him to DJ Phil, but Barbie bugs out.

Jim lets Linda out of the lock up and starts to lecture her. She notices Paul took a rifle and goes to look for him, letting Jim know he can't control her.

In the Sweetbriar Café, two good old boys give Carolyn a hard time about being gay and Rose Twitchell intervenes. Carolyn is worried and looking for Norrie.

Julia finishes a radio broadcast with Phil and sees Junior going by with a helmet. He won't tell her where he's going.

Jim comes into Sweetbriar Café and announces that Paul is on the loose. He asks for volunteers for the search party. The good old boys, Roger and Ollie raise their hands. Jim introduces himself to Barbie and mentions his takedown of Paul the other day, and asks him to join them.

The search party heads to the woods. Barbie warns them off following a dummy rail Paul laid and points them in the right direction.

Elsewhere, Junior sneaks into the abandoned cement factory and heads for the tunnels. Julia follows him.

Linda heads out to another part of the woods on her own.

Joe feeds Norrie breakfast. She tells him she was on the way to visit her dad, who's a musician. Benny brings two girls by to charge their phones on Joe's generator, which he might have mentioned to a few other people.

Out looking for Paul, Jim gets Barbie to admit he was in the army. They sneak up on Paul, but he hears them and shoots Roger in the leg. He keeps firing and runs. Ollie takes Roger back into town and Jim tells Barbie they're going after Paul. ""What is your objective, huh? Are we trying to bring him in or take him out?"" Barbie asks. ""I don't see how it makes a difference to a guy like you,"" Jim says.

Down in the tunnels, Junior runs into the dome deep below ground. It zaps him and he's about to pick up his flashlight, when Julia warns him not to. Junior turns on the dome and yells and pounds on it, Julia watches him rage. Then he stops and starts freaking out about how unsafe the tunnels are and that they could get trapped. She takes out a match and follows the direction of the flame.

Joe's house is totally overrun by teens drinking and charging their devices. Benny urges him to go for Norrie, but warns him not to mention his seizure.

Down in the tunnel, Junior laments being a screw up. Julia tells him how she ended up in Chester's Mill: she was covering the mayor's race in Chicago when she got leaked info about one of the candidates being bribed. She thought it might be forged but ran the story anyway and when it was exposed as fake she got fired.

A jock bully named Carter brushes his way into Joe's house and is soon charging people to use Joe's generator. Norrie tells him to leave and when Carter gets in her face, Joe steps in. The situation is diffused when the generator blows, but Carter tells him it's not over.

Down in the tunnel, Junior tells Julia that Barbie is a psychopath who attacked him for no reason. They find their way back up top.

In the woods, Barbie suggests they call things off, suggesting Jim only wants to keep going to prove what a big man he is. Big Jim tells him his nick name came from a loudmouth receiver who meant it as a taunt and he tackled him and shattered his pelvis. Jim finishes his story and Barbie notices Paul sneak up behind him. He and Barbie stare each other down with rifles.

A shot rings out. Linda shoots Paul from behind, killing him.

Back in town, Jim apologizes to Linda for doubting her. He calls her sheriff.

Julia drives Junior home. He asks her to keep what happened between them, she says they all have secrets.

Julia drives up with him to find Jim bringing Barbie over for a drink. Barbie excuses himself.

In the station, pukes on Duke's hat and takes a nap in one of the cells, just like Duke used to.

At home, Jim won't tell Junior what he was doing with Barbie, telling him to let the grown ups handle it.

At his house, Joe tries to repair his generator, making a Death Star reference. Norrie likes nerds. They hear a noise. Her mom Carolyn has tracked her down. Norrie takes Joe's hand and suddenly they both collapse on the floor having simultaneous seizures and both saying ""stars are falling."" Benny and Carolyn are shocked.

Junior goes back to Angie with his bloodied knuckles from beating the dome. She takes his first aid kit and cleans up his hands, but swipes the scissors.

Back at her house, Julia notices Barbie's busted knuckles. ""You really were just passing through Chester's Mill? No connection to anyone here in town?"" she asks. When Barbie hits the shower, she looks in his bag and finds a house marked on it."

She's out of pills for her migraines. She's hiding the map she took from Barbie's bag and doesn't like it when he says he'll hitch a ride with her to the radio station.

Outside, on the other side of the dome, the military is pulling up and leaving and a crowd inside the dome is angry. Linda tries to calm the group down and pulls her gun as she orders them to disperse. Rev. Coggins starts loudly preaching that the dome is supposed to be a new Eden. Jim intervenes and addresses the crowd as Barbie takes in the whole scene.

Jim successfully gets the crowd to go home. Someone has painted "" Don't Leave Us"" on the inside of the dome. Jim checks on Linda and notices she's faint. He and Barbie get her to a car.

Down in the fallout shelter, Junior brings Angie a change of clothes and the dress she wore to junior prom. She puts her arms around him and plays along with his fantasy, and he says she's starting to act like the old Angie. When he turns his back, she grabs the pair of scissors she stole from the first aid kit. He grabs her hand, getting hurt only slightly as he fends off the attack. And chains her more tightly.

She cries, begging him to let her go. ""You can leave whenever you're ready, but not before,"" he says.

Julia follows Barbie's map to a trailer park. She sees her husband's car parked outside DJ Phil's trailer. He tells her Peter sold him the car. Then he collapses.

Alice and Carolyn bring their daughter Norrie and Joe to the hospital after her latest seizures. Alice asks the nurse to run tests, but the nurse explains they don't have any doctors. One's outside the dome, one crashed into it and Peter Shumway is missing. Alice, a psychiatrist who did her internship in medicine, resolves to run the tests herself.

Joe sees Junior getting his hand stitched up and asks if he's seen Angie. Junior only says he saw her a few nights ago ""around.""

Jim shows up with Linda, who's unconscious. Nurses start bringing more people in with fever and flu. Julia brings in Phil.

Down in the fallout shelter, Angie tries to figure out her next move. She opens the airvent and screams into it. While she's climbing up onto the top bunk, she grabs onto a rusty water pipe. It breaks, gushing water everywhere and she slips and knocks her head on the concrete floor.

At the hospital, Alice draws her daughter's blood, while she hooks Joe up to an EEG, which looks completely normal. Jim comes to get Alice. There are dozens of sick people. They're out of masks and gloves.

Julia confronts Barbie about Phil, thinking they know each other. She shows him the map, saying she went through his stuff because he lied about fighting with Junior. She's demanding answers when she starts to feel faint.

Lying on a cot, Linda recognizes Mrs. Moore, her third grade teacher, who wonders if the dome is making them sick.

Alice announces she thinks it's a meningitis outbreak. Junior got vaccinated when he went to college, Alice's family did too, as did Barbie in the military. The sick people need antibiotics in the next 12 hours, but they don't have enough. She says the sick people can't be allowed to leave the hospital.

Jim gets shotgun from his car and gives it to Junior, telling him to keep everyone inside.

Angie wakes up with water rushing in around her, it's already six inches deep. She struggles to plug the leak.

Julia finds Phil and asks him about the car. ""Peter man, I'm sorry, I can't make it to the cabin today,"" Phil says. Julia asks what cabin, but Alice sends her back to bed.

Jim and Barbie reach the only pharmacy in town and find it ransacked.

There are 30 people with advanced symptoms and two dozen with early signs. Carolyn notices Alice is out of sorts, she took her insulin without eating.

Both Mrs. Moore and Linda have spiking fevers, but there's only one dose of antibiotics left. Mrs. Moore insists they give it to Linda, saying the town needs her.

Julia goes to Junior and asks to be let out, she thinks Peter is in trouble. She mentions what Phil said about a cabin. ""Like the one I found Barbie at?"" Junior says. He tells her about it, but won't let her go.

Julia goes around testing exits. She takes her husband's key card from his office and leaves.

Barbie suggests whoever took the drugs would have a big vehicle. Like a hearse, Jim suggests. They drive to Rev. Coggins' place and find him dumping pills into the fire. He says people dying is part of God's plan.

Linda wakes up, feeling better. She's talking to Mrs. Moore when the teacher codes. Alice races in but can't revive her.

Julia drives to the cabin where Barbie accidentally killed Peter.

At the hospital, people are challenging Junior to try to leave. He fires a warning shot, then regroups and addresses everyone calmly, telling them they're all in it together. He puts down his shotgun and walks away.

Ollie contemplates leaving, but doesn't.

Julia rifles through the cabin and finds legal papers. Then she passes out.

Joe brings Norrie a sandwich. She wonders if maybe they triggered the seizure and decide to try again. They set up a phone to film it. They grip hands, but nothing happens. Then they grab both hands and each collapse in seizures again.

Jim and Barbie show up with the antibiotics.

Down in the flooding fall-out shelter, Angie screams for help but no one can hear her.

Barbie asks Phil what he told Julia. Phil thinks Peter is ""gone."" A month ago Peter asked Phil if he knew any hitmen, then he sold him his car for a steal. ""I don't know how much he owed you, you ain't getting that cash back,"" Phil says.

Julia hallucinates seeing Peter and asks him ""why didn't you tell me?""

Joe and Norrie wake up from their shared seizure. They watch the video, including them saying ""pink stars are falling in lines."" Then Joe sits up mid-seizure and shushes the camera.

""Maybe we're not supposed to tell anyone, because the dome doesn't want us to,"" Joe says.

Barbie keeps looking for Julia. Junior tells him what he told her. Barbie demands his keys and drives to go get her.

He finds her.

The water in the fallout shelter is up to Angie's cot and she's shivering with cold.

At the hospital, people are improving. Linda tells Jim that Junior stopped what could have been a ""full blown riot"" by talking people down.

""Ever consider a career in law enforcement?"" Jim asks his son.

Julia wakes up. She knows Barbie saved her life. She learned that her house is in foreclosure and their bank accounts are empty. She asks what they were into.

Barbie tells her in a roundabout way that he's an enforcer for a bookie. She doesn't believe Peter gambled. Barbie plays her a voice mail from Peter, saying he has the cash. Julia asks where Peter is. ""He must have taken off,"" Barbie says. Julia kicks him out of her house.

With the outbreak over, Joe invites Alice, Carolyn and Norrie to stay at his house. He and Norrie don't mention their latest seizure.

Leaving the hospital, Alice finds Carolyn taking insulin supplies. Carolyn is worried the dome will last forever, but Alice isn't concerned and puts it back.

Junior gives Linda a ride back to the station. She's feeling guilty about Mrs. Moore dying. She commends Junior again for calming everyone down. She hands him a deputy's badge.

Jim comes home and finds Rev. Coggins on his front porch, with a duffel bag full of cash. ""My share of the profits. Keep all the propane, I'm going to wash my hands of this dirty little business,"" he says.

Down in the shelter, Angie tries screaming into the flowing water pipes. Jim hears a noise from beside his kitchen sink. He goes outside to investigate and sees the shelter flooded. He opens the door and sees Angie chained up and scared inside."

He thinks they're human receivers for the dome, but when they get too close together they get feedback.

He takes her to see a giant swarm of Monarch butterflies flocking to the dome, even though they're not in season.

Jim Rennie finally comes back to check on Angie, after leaving her in the fallout shelter all night. He says he'll let her out, as soon as she tells him what she's doing down there.

She tells him Junior has been keeping her prisoner. She begs him to let her out.

Jim hears a horn outside his house. He shuts Angie back in, telling her he needs to think about it.

Rev. Coggins is outside Jim's house, claiming he's hearing a message from God: Moab, a wicked place. Jim blows him off. He turns up his hearing aid and hears ""Moab"" again.

Barbie wakes up in his car near Joe's place and sees the butterflies lingering near the dome. The army man on the other side acknowledges them, which Barbie finds odd. They watch as busloads of Chester's Mill residents are bused in.

Over the radio, Julia announces visits will be allowed with family on the outside.

Junior comes home in his new deputy uniform and makes an excuse to go down to the shelter. Jim doesn't mention Angie, but instead orders Junior to go recruit Carter, the fullback from Junior's team, as another deputy.

On the bridge, the designated meeting spot, Linda recruits Barbie to string up police caution tape on their side of the dome so nobody touches it and gets zapped, like Duke did. Then she sees her fiancé Rusty and immediately breaks her own order, putting her hand on the dome against his and kissing him.

Julia checks the radio and hears an odd broadcast: ""Zone One is painted, Green for 1315.""

At the meeting spot, Joe looks for Angie. A man holds up a sign for Norrie. Then another saying he's Michael, her dad. Norrie's mom told her she came from an anonymous donor. He holds up baby pictures of her and one of him with her mom, Alice.

Rev. Coggins, starts shouting and addressing the crowd, relaying his ""Moab"" message. Jim shuts him up, but Coggins is more concerned with confessing his sins to God.

They let drug dealers make their product in town, but didn't let them sell it there. Jim says they saved the town.

Coggins threatens to expose him if he doesn't come clean in front of the town within one day.

Julia waits, hoping to see Peter. Linda feels bad for not telling Rusty about his brother Freddie's death.

Alice and Carolyn find Norrie and see Michael on the other side. Norrie yells at her moms for keeping the truth from her, then she says she hates them and runs off. Alice yells at Michael for never being anything to Norrie and only showing up when the cameras are there.

Julia sees a woman named Mary waiting for her on the other side. She holds up a letter for Julia to read. Mary's her sister in law. The letter was from Peter and it said: ""I know this is confusing but all I can say is sorry. Tell Julia she deserves better.""

""The guy didn't even have the balls to send his own dear John letter,"" Julia says.

Barbie sees a woman about to touch the dome because her son, who she hasn't seen in five years, is on the other side. He stops her, but Junior swoops in and says he'll handle it. Barbie can't believe somebody made him a cop.

Julia tells Rusty about the death of his brother, Freddie.

Joe follows an upset Norrie. She calls her dad ""some creep who wants to be on TV."" Ben joins them, saying China threatened to attack the US after the dome showed up.

As visitor's day wraps up, Barbie sees Dodee signing with her mom. He asks if she can read lips, then takes her over to a soldier on the other side. He shows the solder a coin, identifying his old unit, which Barbie says is ""kinda famous.""

The soldier immediately recognizes him as one of the Jackrabbits. Barbie asks for answers.

""Something big is going down, they told us to pull out after this, all of us. They said once we leave, don't plan on coming back,"" he says.

They got their orders last night, after the butterflies showed up.

Dodee knows a lot of animals use magnetic fields to navigate. He knows what Moab means: Mother of All Bombs, the largest non-nuclear missile in their arsenal.

""Visitor's Day was not about saying hello to your families, it was about saying good bye,"" he says.

Dodee and Barbie relay the news and Julia relays the transmission she heard: painted green means the target is set for 1:15 p.m.

They make quick plans to evacuate everyone to the old cement factory. Julia makes a broadcast.

Jim checks on Angie again and cuts her free. He apologizes for what Junior did and tells her to go.

""If we're all going to die today, you might as well die a free woman,"" he says. Angie runs.

Everyone moves down to the cement tunnels.

Julia asks Barbie about his coin. He explains his unit rescued a captured soldier whose unit had been killed by insurgents -- except it wasn't insurgents, it was Barbie's unit, mistaking them for the enemy.

Junior comes back to the shelter and Jim tells him he let Angie go. Junior races off in his police car.

At the radio station, Phil sets up a final play list. He thinks this is the end.

Angie comes home looking for Joe, but no one's there -- except Junior waiting for her in her bedroom with a gun. ""I knew you'd come here, we're not finished yet,"" he says.

Down in the tunnels, Phil plays Beethoven over speakers. Barbie gives him his grandfather's watch back. Barbie doesn't really expect the tunnels to protect them.

In Angie's house, Junior tells her they're all going to die. He apologizes, saying he just wanted to help her get better. She hugs him and puts his head in her lap.

In the tunnel, Julia drinks vintage wine out of a paper cup. She shares with Barbie. She says she's made peace with Peter leaving.

Barbie tells Julia there's something she needs to know, but they're interrupted by Alice and Carolyn looking for Norrie.

Julia goes for the backway out, to look for Joe and Norrie.

Above ground, Joe and Norrie look for Angie.

Phil's final song is Skeeter Davis, ""The End of the World."" He dances with Dodee.

Everyone takes in what they think are their last moments.

Above ground, Joe and Norrie see the bomb coming in. They kiss as it explodes. Their neither die, nor have a seizure. There's a big blast mark on the dome wall, but there's no damage inside.

But the dome is still there, intact.

Julia takes Barbie's hand. The land outside the dome is scorched earth.

Coggins tells Jim that the Lord saved Chester's Mill because he repented, and now it's Jim's turn.

Jim agrees it's a new day, then he calmly takes Coggins' head and presses it, and his hearing aid, against the dome. The dome fries his hearing aid, his ear begins bleeding, and he slumps to the ground, seemingly dead."

At Angie's house, Junior is back to menacing Angie, promising he'll take care of her. She bashes him over the head with a snow globe and runs.

Driving back to the house, Alice gets overheated and delirious. She wanders into traffic and is nearly run over by a truck. It veers to avoid her and crashes into the water tower. Water starts pouring out of it. Joe and Norrie help the driver, but it keeps draining.

Barbie and Linda arrive and assess. The town gets its water from a lake.

Alice admits she ran out of insulin.

At the radio station, Phil is getting only feedback. He says for the interference to be so strong, it has to be coming from inside the dome. Dodee has rigged a machine to find the source of it, thinking the dome is generating it to preserve itself from the missile. She thinks if they can find the source, maybe they can turn it off.

Barbie and Linda reach the lake and find dead fish floating in it.

At the clinic, they're out of insulin.

Barbie and Linda bring some of the water back to Jim and explain it's polluted with methane, released from the earth after the missile hit. It's undrinkable until they figure out how to filter it.

Jim just happens to know there are artisian wells under Chester's Mill, right under Ollie's place. Jim volunteers to go talk to him.

Angie makes a run for it in the woods.

Junior tells his dad he can't find Angie and Jim tells him he'd better.

In town, Terry the store owner is only accepting propane or batteries. People in line are getting scared.

Jim visits Ollie on his farm, making a plea to his civic pride. Ollie is still angry over losing 7 acres of his farm 15 years ago in a council vote when Jim sided against him. He wants Jim to pay for it. Jim mentions he has plenty of propane. Ollie agrees to trade for water.

Linda flags down Junior, who is looking for Angie. Junior, Barbie, Linda and Carter try to control people stealing in the town store.

Norrie decides to track down the other diabetics in town by going through the hospital's files and steal their insulin to help her mom.

Julia and Dodee drive around tracking the power source, but it's moving.

Angie makes it into town. Junior sees her and she runs to Rose's café to hide. Angie tells Rose everything.

Norrie and Joe reach the house of a diabetic listed in the hospital's files, Ray Garcia. Norrie smashes in a window and then hears a shotgun cock. Ray holds it on them and says he took his last dose yesterday.

The crowd outside the store is getting rowdy. Someone throws a trash can through a window and pandemonium breaks out. People start stealing and fighting. One guy hits Barbie so he tracks him down and pummels him. Barbie's close to suffocating him when Linda shows up and intervenes.

At the Sweetwater Café, two boys break in, planning to steal what's left in Rose's freezer. They beat her with a bat. Angie jumps the guy attacking her, but gets knocks out.

The streets are turning to chaos as people loot everything. Linda releases tear gas to drive people away, but it has no impact.

Driving around town, Dodee thinks they're close to the signal.

Norrie and Joe reach another diabetic's house. It's unlocked. Norrie takes the insulin but a young boy finds them. It's his insulin. Joe puts most of the insulin back, but takes one vial. They leave.

Dodee and Julia pull up beside Norrie and Joe and Dodee's signal gets stronger. She thinks the interference is coming from them.

Linda prepares to take more extreme measures and pulls her gun. Suddenly it starts raining. People are so excited they stop fighting.

Jim is upset to hear about Rose's death.

Norrie, Joe, Julia and Dodee reach the dome. When Norrie and Joe touch the dome together, Dodee's radio starts working again -- the signal is unjammed. Julia thinks the dome is using them.

Julia points out the dome protected them from the missile strike and just when they needed water, it rained.

Julia points out to Dodee they can't tell anyone about Joe and Norrie or they'll be in danger.

In town, people collect the rain water in buckets. Water from the lake is evaporating and being filtered as it accumulates as rain so it's safe to drink.

Norrie brings her mom the vial of insulin she stole.

Julia finds Barbie walking alone in the rain. He hugs her and she takes his hand. They start kissing in the rain.

Angie wakes up on Jim's couch. He breaks the news about Rose and tells her she's free to leave, but he's hoping they can come to an arrangement about Junior.

""I've always known something was off about him, ever since his mom died,"" he says.

Jim promises her that Junior will never touch her again and if she needs anything -- propane, food, water, a gun -- he'll give it to her, if she keeps quiet. She checks that Joe will be taken care of, too.

Angie says she has to think about it.

At the Rennie house, Big Jim physically throws Junior out of the house, slapping him around. He tells him not to touch Angie again and also to find somewhere else to live.

Angie watches it all and checks that Jim knows his son is crazy. Jim offers to let her stay, so he can keep an eye on her, but she wants to get home to Joe. First, she wants to pay her respects to Rose, whose body is being kept in the Sweetbriar Café kitchen. She learns that Jim owns it -- he bought the place after Rose kept borrowing money.

Back at Julia's, Harriet leaves with her yogurt and sees her husband across the street. She goes to greet him, but instead of touching him, she touches the dome. Her water breaks. She cries for help.

Jim drives up to his shipping container and finds Ollie's man, Boomer, a giant dude, guarding it with a shotgun. He's taken the lock off and won't let Jim near it. When Jim tries to get passed him, Boomer whacks him in the gut and the face with the shotgun.

Linda and Junior look for Waylon and Clint Dundee. She mentions they tried to rape Angie, which of course hits a special kind of crazy place in Junior.

Meanwhile, Julia and Harriet get stopped at a junk roadblock and the Dundee brothers come out with guns drawn and start to siphon their gas.

Barbie finds them and disarms one, but gets distracted by Harriet in labor. He radios Linda to report which way they ran and then heads to get Harriet to Alice, the only doctor in town.

Norrie and Joe trek toward the center of the dome. He finds their connection to it cool. Joe's dog Truman is bothered by something and runs off, but they forge on.

Back at the café, Angie and Benny finish burying Rose. She wants to clean the café up. Jim comes by and goes for a bottle of liquor.

At Joe's house, Carolyn tries to take care of Alice, who insists she doesn't feel sick. Carolyn blames herself that they ended up in town and trapped.

Barbie arrives carrying Harriet.

As Norrie and Joe reach the center of the dome, the hair stands up on Norrie's arms. They find a pile of leaves. It shocks them. They move the leaves and find another dome covered in dirt. They wash it off and see a small black egg shaped object.

Alice guides Harriet through labor and her dome freak out.

Ollie drops by Jim's office to gloat over his theft of the propane, giving him all the water, crops and propane. ""It's my turn to have my sweaty little hand wrapped around this town's neck,"" he says.

From now on he expects Jim to do what he says.

The Dundee brothers hide out at the junkyard. Junior and Linda get the drop on them and disarm them. Linda is putting cuffs on one when he knocks her down and runs. The other brother gets away from Junior and he chases him down.

The Dundee brother near Linda starts shooting at her and she has no choice but to fire at him. Meanwhile, Junior stalks down the other, unarmed brother, who is on the ground and says he'll go quietly. Junior shoots him in the chest while he's down.

In the woods, Norrie and Joe talk to the mini-dome to try to get it to respond. They both put their hands on it and try to talk to it. Alice appears in the woods. She disappears when Norrie removes her hands. Norrie suddenly wants to find her mother.

As Alice is delivering the baby, she starts to feel something is wrong.

At the propane, Boomer puts two tanks in his truck and gets in. Big Jim fires at him from nearby and watches, chugging from a whiskey bottle, as Boomer and his truck go up in a fireball.

Alice is weak but talks Barbie through cutting the cord because it's wrapped around the baby's neck. Harriet gives one final push and delivers a healthy baby girl. Harriet decides to call her Alice.

After holding the baby, adult Alice gets weaker and weaker.

Junior comes by the café, saying he wants to talk to Angie. Benny refuses to leave. Junior apologizes to her for everything and tells her the Dundees won't bother her again.

Norrie and Joe come back to his house. Alice had a heart attack and is really weak.

Joe waits outside and is there when Angie finally comes home.

Norrie explains that she knew something was wrong when she saw her mom in the woods, like the dome wanted her to know. Norrie says a tearful good-bye to her mom then runs outside. Joe follows her in the dark.

Norrie puts her hand on the dome and tells it to bring her mom back.

Harriet holds her new baby, Alice.

Carolyn kisses her wife good-bye.

When Norrie gets nothing from the dome she yells at it to tell her what it wants.

In the forest, the black egg streaks purple."

He goes downstairs with a gun to investigate and finds Junior coming home. Jim knows his son killed Clint Dundee.

""You're not in your right mind, Junior. You sound just like your mother did in the end,"" he says. ""You're no son of mine, not anymore.""

He kicks Junior out again. Before he goes, Junior warns his father not to talk about his mother like that again.

At the McAlister house, Barbie digs a grave for Alice. Julia finds it weird that one Alice died and another was born, all in the same house. She can't imagine losing a spouse like that (because she doesn't know she already did when Barbie killed Peter).

Inside, per agreement with Jim, Angie won't tell Joe where she was all week. They're low on food and head to the diner to get some. Joe checks on Norrie, but she's still in the depths of anger over her mom dying and won't talk to him.

Julia joins them for coffee. When Jim comes by, Angie tells him his ""insane son"" dropped in last night. He promises Junior won't bother her again and agrees to get food for the diner from Ollie.

Joe doodles the mini dome on a placemat, when Julia sees it, he wads it up and tosses it and in the woods, the black egg in the mini dome streaks purple.

Jim approaches Ollie about the food shortage, offering to trade his reclaimed propane in exchange for water to grow crops. But Ollie isn't interested. He'll do without propane just to show the town that it doesn't need Jim.

Barbie drops by the station and agrees to continue working as a ""freelance deputy."" They hear noises and find Junior getting a shotgun out of the safe. Linda says after yesterday, he's on probation and doesn't get a gun.

Jim comes by, he wants their help taking Ollie's land through eminent domain.

Joe and Angie come back to their house with food. Norrie is still upset and tells Joe she thinks they caused her mom's heart attack when they touched the mini dome. ""Bad things happen when we're together,"" she says, and announces she and Carolyn are moving out.

Jim, Junior, Barbie, Connor and Linda arrive at Ollie's farm and don't see anyone. But within moments, they're surrounded by men in trucks with shotguns. They're outnumbered. Ollie tells Linda that anyone who sides with Jim doesn't get use of his water. When Connor doesn't move away from the well, Ollie has one of his goons shoot him in the kneecap. Linda draws her gun but Barbie realizes they're outgunned.

Ollie says again that it's private property and anyone who attempts to take it will be met with ""most serious consequences.""

Junior assesses the situation and asks Ollie if he needs any help. Ollie has him disarm Jim, which Junior enjoys doing. Junior stands with Ollie.

Joe is upset about Norrie. ""Women say a lot of things they don't mean, especially at that age,"" Julia tells him. He tells her about the egg.

Back at town hall, Jim wants to go back to the well with more force. Barbie has another way. He goes to the town map, which shows dried out wells. Ollie's well siphoned from them. Barbie suggests blowing Ollie's to divert the water back to the others.

Meanwhile, at the diner, Jim is talking to several dozen armed volunteers, including DJ Phil. Barbie tells Jim his plan, but Jim is worried it'll contaminate their only water supply. Jim wants to make an example of Ollie.

Barbie heads off to blow up the well ahead of Jim's attack.

At Ollie's farm, Ollie tries to understand how Junior decided to become a free agent. Junior explains his dad kicked him out. Ollie mentions Junior's mom. He thought his mom died in a car crash. Ollie says it was suicide.

Ollie is looking forward to taking out Jim. ""Ollie, promise me you won't kill him,"" Junior says. ""'Cause I want to do it.""

Joe takes Julia to the mini dome. It's uncovered and the egg is glowing pink. Julia puts her hands on the mini dome and sees a vision of Joe saying: ""The monarch will be crowned.""

She's freaked out. When she tells Joe, he worries something bad will happen to him, just like it did to Alice after they saw her.

Barbie sneaks around Ollie's farm to get his fertilizer and blasting caps to blow the well. He puts together a bomb in one of his barns as armed men patrol outside.

At the McAlister house, Norrie is hanging out in Angie's room. Angie knows the girls ""reprogramming"" camp that Norrie's moms were taking her to, she went there many times. Norrie says if her mom hadn't insisted on taking her there, she'd still be alive, so it's her own fault she's dead. Angie can tell she doesn't mean it.

Angie has snow globes from cities around the world that ""someone she used to know"" brought her. She used to feel Chester's Mill was a prison, now it literally is. She has an idea for what will make her feel better.

She and Norrie head to the dome and throw the globes against it.

""Good-bye, Paris, France. I got Cs in your lame language anyway, so you can suck it. Au revoir, la bibliotech,"" Norrie says, chucking Paris.

Norrie's enjoying herself until she gets to Los Angeles, her home. She crumples and starts crying that it's her fault her mom died.

Later that night, Jim's volunteer army sneaks onto Ollie's farm. Linda tries to delay him, but he's itching to attack.

Barbie sets his bomb. Jim realizes he's missing and sends his guys in.

Barbie gets his bombs set and is about to back away to arm them when one of Ollie's guys finds him. Barbie jumps on him. A gunfight breaks out between Ollie's and Jim's men. Several men are hit, including Phil.

Barbie gets the better of the guy who jumped him and blows the well.

Jim's volunteers see the well go up and run off.

Junior sneaks up on his dad and knocks him out cold. They drag Jim in the house, where Ollie blames him for blowing up the well. With the well gone, Ollie's men leave him.

Ollie stands back as Junior takes aim at his dad.

Joe and Julia see Linda taking Phil to the clinic.

Junior asks his dad about his mom's death. Jim tells him they fought, she ran out and got in the car. A witness saw her aim right at a tree and drive into it at 80 mph. Sheriff Duke helped him cover it up and they paid the witness off. Junior cocks the shotgun and his dad cries as he says he didn't want Junior to know that she chose to leave them. Jim apologizes and Junior seems to forgive him.

Ollie has had enough of Junior stalling. He takes aim at Jim. Junior turns the shotgun on Ollie and blasts him through the gut.

Julia and Joe return to his house and she encourages him to go talk to Norrie. Norrie hugs him and apologizes for what she said.

Jim pours himself a drink in his office. Barbie visits him. Three of Ollie's people died, two of Jim's died. Barbie's plan worked, the town has a reservoir again. But five people died for nothing.

Barbie thinks it's bad news for Jim because he wanted to control the well so he could control the town.

""You don't want to make an enemy of me, Barbie,"" Jim says. ""There's two sides to that coin, Jim.""

Linda finds Junior sitting alone in a cell at the station. He tells her that he killed Ollie when he was about to fire on his dad.

Barbie joins Julia in her bedroom. She tells him about ""The monarch will be crowned."" They have no idea what it means.

Except when they get there, there's nothing but an empty hole.

Linda radios Barbie to report shots were fired in town.

Big Jim stops by the diner, jazzed over having negotiated a food deal for goods and services with the farmers. Angie wants to keep the diner open and asks him for the deed. He'll think about it.

Barbie and Linda respond to the shooting, which was an accident as Ted Utleywas trying to get a crazy person off his porch. The crazy person turns out to be Larry, the town junkie, who's hearing voices on a drug called Rapture that Rev. Coggins sold him. It's every drug combined.

Junior comes by the diner, and Angie tries to throw him out. He insists he only locked her up because the dome was making her sick. She's saying the dome has nothing to do with her when she collapses, having a seizure. She says: ""The pink stars are falling in lines."" The same thing Joe and Norrie said.

Jim comes home to find a woman in his house waiting for him.

Angie freaks out when she wakes up in the back of Junior's cruiser, but he's only bringing her home. Inside, Norrie tells her she and Joe have had the same seizure.

Norrie notices Angie's tattoo, but Joe says monarchs are orange and her tattoo is blue and yellow.

Joe suggests borrowing Dodee's device to try to track down the mini-dome.

Jim talks to Max, the woman who was making Rapture with Jim's secret ingredient. She got trapped in town when she came to see him about it. He assures her Duke and Rev. Coggins aren't problems anymore.

Linda and Barbie find Coggins' stash in one of the caskets, along with a formula that calls for liquid propane, which they notice the town has a lot of.

Julia asks Dodee to borrow her device to find a power source, but Dodee tells her it stopped working after Norrie and Joe touched the dome. Dodee is still sketched out by the kids.

Back at the station, Jim suggests they confiscate people's guns. He argues the dome means they're not part of America anymore, so the second amendment doesn't apply. He suggests going on the radio and proposing it as a voluntary program. Barbie agrees, but thinks Jim's up to something.

Later, Jim goes on the radio with his proposal, emphasizing that it's totally voluntary and anyone who participates will get extra food and propane.

When Julia comes back to Joe's house to report she doesn't have Dodee's device, Norrie suggests they use the dog to try to find it, since he growled when he was near it last time.

Angie goes to see Junior at the station, wondering if him saying the dome is making her sick isn't just crazy ranting.

At the diner, dozens of people turn in their guns, but Jim is disappointed that Ted Utley isn't among them. His wife and kid were killed when the dome came down and Jim says he's worried about him. He arms up and goes to see him, with Barbie following, suspicious.

In the woods, Joe, Norrie and Julia follow Truman the dog.

Linda goes to check on the town's propane supply. The local busybody comes over and tells Linda about all the suspicious trucks coming and going, like she mentioned to Duke. Linda wonders why he didn't say anything to her. Linda shoots the lock off and goes inside to see all the tanks.

Jim and Barbie pull up to Ted's house and are formulating a plan when he shoots out their windshield.

Angie follows Junior to his mom's art studio, which has been unused since she died nine years ago. He tells her a few months before she died, she had a dream about Junior and started painting frantically. In the dream, he was on a hill, looking up at pink stars.

At Ted's house, Jim goes in the front door cautiously while Barbie creeps around back. Jim finds Ted in his bedroom, sitting on the bed, surrounded by rifles. Jim sits down to talk to him, with Barbie taking aim through a scope behind him. Jim blocks Barbie's shot intentionally as he tries to talk him down, but he sees Ted is holding a grenade.

Ted is despondent over the loss of his family and ignores Jim's attempts to reason with him. He pulls the pin on the grenade. Jim throws himself on him and grabs the grenade and gets the pin back in before it goes off. With the situation diffused, Jim takes Ted to the clinic and asks Barbie to pack up his guns. He also thanks Barbie for not accidentally blowing his head off.

At the propane storage, Linda scans through the surveillance footage and finds Duke taking an envelope of cash from Max.

At his mother's studio, Junior is starting to sound less crazy. He thinks his mom knew something was coming. The painting shows him standing outside a house with pink stars in the sky. He thinks it's great that they're in it together.

Jim and Barbie are packing up the guns at the diner when Max comes in, congratulating him on a job well done. Jim starts to introduce Max to Barbie when she strolls over and plants one on him. They know each other.

Joe and Norrie return to the house after dark and Truman takes off for the barn barking. The mini-dome is inside.

Barbie isn't happy isn't see Max. Max tells both men they're working for her now or she'll reveal their secrets. Rounding up the guns was the first part, spreading drugs is the second.

When Jim leaves, Barbie tells Max he won't go along with her plan. She threatens to tell Julia he killed her husband; Max was the one he called and said Peter fought back.

Angie joins Norrie and Joe in the barn. Norrie and Joe are wondering how it got there, when Angie says Joe brought it there. She saw him in the kitchen at 3 a.m. last night acting like a zombie and saying he was going out for a walk.

Back at Julia's she's trying to convince herself to stop worrying about the mini-dome and be grateful for what she has, including Barbie. He's distracted listening to her, thinking about her dead husband.

Junior sees the door to his dad's fall-out shelter open and goes to investigate. He sees his dad stockpiling the weapons the town turned in.

Back in the barn, Norrie wonders if Joe brought the dome there because they're the only ones who are supposed to know about it. They decide not to tell Julia again.

Angie touches it and it glows blue. When all three of them touch it, a fourth handprint appears on the dome. They need to find the fourth hand."

They leave the dome covered with a blanket in the barn. Hiding outside the barn, Dodee sneaks in to check it out.

Julia wakes up to find Barbie gone. He's visiting Jim Rennie to talk about Max. Barbie wants to figure out what the insurance policy Max mentioned having on both of them to expose their secrets if something happens to her. Jim volunteers to look into the properties Max owns in town.

Barbie won't let him go along to the town clerk's office. They find one in the middle of Lake Eastpoint that's still inside the dome.

Max interrupts them. She wants Jim to get her espresso, dark chocolate and fancy shampoo. She has another errand for Barbie.

Back in the barn, Dodee touches the mini-dome, but it doesn't like it. It shocks her and knocks her out. The kids find her, she's unconscious and her hand is burned.

They take her to the clinic. She doesn't remember what happened, so when she guesses it was the generator outside of the radio station, they go with it.

Angie asks the nurse if she knows anyone else who's had seizures. ""Not since your tenth grade dance, Angie,"" the nurse says.

Julia visits Linda at the station looking for Barbie. She's looking into what Andrea the busybody said about the trucks. She tells Julia about Duke and Coggins' involvement in the drug Rapture. Linda looks in Duke's old hat and finds a key. Julia recognizes it as a safe deposit box.

Junior sees a man walking down the street, acting suspicious. He stops him and finds he just stole some salt. The man says it's better than cash at the cement factory.

Max takes Barbie to the cement factory, which she has turned into a house of vice. There's a bar set up and bare knuckle boxing.

Jim takes a boat to Max's island house. He's armed. He finds a woman gardening, she's Agatha, the caretaker. She says the owner is a man named Oliver, but he's on the other side of the island. She invites Jim in for tea.

In the bar, Max explains how she let her problem gamblers barter wagers to build up her vice empire.

Angie finally explains to Norrie and Joe that she thinks Junior is the fourth hand -- he had a seizure at their tenth grade dance. She tells Joe about Junior keeping her locked up after the dome fell.

Julia and Linda check out the abandoned bank.

At the cement factory, Junior tries to get in using the salt, but the bouncer Duncan knows he's a cop now and won't let him in. He decks Junior and takes the salt.

Inside, the gathered hordes are enjoying the bare knuckle fights. Max explains that he's the main event, fighting Victor Rollings, someone he collected from. He fights, or she tells Julia he killed her husband.

Back on the island house, Jim is trying to figure out Agatha's connection to Max when he sees an old photo. He turns around and sees Agatha has a rifle trained on him. She's Max's mom.

Max introduces the fight. There are no rules and no time limits. She expects Barbie to win.

Agatha reminds Jim they went to high school together. She was Claire back then and got pregnant at 16. She supported Maxine by turning tricks. She explains how Max told her everything about him, Duke and Coggins. He acts like he knows Barbie's secret and she mentions him killing Peter. Then Jim starts to intimidate her and walk closer, daring her to shoot.

He quickly disarms her.

Angie takes Norrie and Joe to Junior's mother's studio and shows them the painting with pink stars falling. It doesn't matter if they think he's crazy, it only matters what the dome wants. Junior shows up in the studio. Joe rushes him, but the bigger Junior easily gets him in a headlock.

Angie diffuses the situation and asks Junior to come to the barn.

Downstairs at the cement factory, Barbie and Victor are wailing on each other. Victor is bigger, but Barbie seems to be better trained. Victor nearly pile drives him, but Barbie finishes him off with a few sharp crosses. Victor is down, but Barbie sees how pleased Max is and eggs him on. He gets up and goes after Barbie. Barbie whispers at Victor to hit him and with the next hit, Barbie goes down hard and stays down.

Barbie thinks he got Max, but she knew he'd throw the fight just to hurt her. Everyone bet on him, she bet on Victor, she cleaned up.

Linda and Julia find a letter in Duke's safe deposit box. It's a confession. His son died of a drug addiction 19 years ago and he promised to keep drugs out of Chester's Mill, so he made a deal with Maxine. The town bought the liquid propane and Maxine lined the town coffers and promised to keep all drgus out of Chester's Mill. The letter explains Coggins and Big Jim's role in the scheme.

Julia checks her own deposit box and finds a life insurance policy on Peter for $1 million. ""I need to talk to Barbie,"" she says.

Jim drives Agatha back to the mainland, but she stands up at one point and falls off the moving boat. He circles back to get her, but thinks better of it and drives off, leaving her to flounder in the water with her hands tied.

After his fight, Barbie's body and ego are bruised. Max climbs into his lap and kisses him. She thinks they can live large while the dome is down. He shoves her off his lap. She threatens again to tell about Peter's death but he's had enough and leaves.

Jim comes home to find Linda waiting for him in the dark on his porch. She asks him to come to the station, but gives him til the morning when he asks.

Barbie comes home to Julia. ""I need to say something,"" he says. He tells her he found Peter at the cabin. She guesses he pulled a gun on him. She found his gun missing, but all the bullets were there.

""He needed you to kill him,"" Julia says and shows him the life insurance policy. She thinks Peter did it to protect her. Barbie apologizes. She tells him ""in the future"" there can be no more lies.

The kids visit the mini-dome in the barn with Junior. The caterpillar is in a chrysalis now. The three touch the mini-dome and the egg glows purple. They wait for Junior.

He places his hand on the mini-dome, it fits the handprint perfectly. The power goes off in the barn. A thousand points of light like stars appear in the barn all around them. It's the pink stars making constellations. ""It's beautiful,"" Angie says. ""But what does it mean?"" Junior asks."

At the station, Linda questions Big Jim about the propane deal he had with Duke and Maxine. He presents himself as a savior since the propane has become so vital since the dome came down. He suggests Linda go after a ""real criminal"" who's new to town.

Cut to Barbie, sleeping on Julia's couch. Julia admits she was lonely in the bed alone and asks him to take her to Peter's grave for closure.

Jim tells Linda that Barbie was working for Max as her enforcer. He mentions Peter's disappearance since he was seen with Barbie.

Max rings Julia's doorbell. ""Can I help you?"" Julia asks. ""Right now, you can't even help yourself,"" Max says. Then she shoots Julia in the chest and walks away.

Barbie comes downstairs and sees Julia, then radios Linda for help. Jim hears the call and implies Barbie's lying.

Back in the barn, Junior gets all starry eyed with Angie about them being linked by fate. She angrily reminds him how he kept her prisoner and says if they ever get the dome down she's leaving town and getting away from him.

He leaves angrily, telling Angie he won't help with the mini dome anymore and he'd rather die in the dome than ever be apart from her. A storm begins to rage.

Linda doesn't get very far driving to Barbie because her gas was siphoned. She stops Phil for a ride.

At Julia's, Barbie sees Joe outside and calls for him. They get Julia in the car. Barbie keeps pressure on her wound while Joe drives to the clinic.

The storm swirls at the top of the dome, angry clouds.

Max shows up at town hall and tells him Barbie said no to her. When Junior shows up, she levels veiled threats at Junior to unnerve Jim.

The storm continues getting worse as Joe races to the clinic, dodging falling trees. Julia is not doing well in the back. Joe thinks the dome is angry.

At the clinic, the bullet went through Julia's chest but Barbie works to relieve the pressure on Julia's chest, using a pen and plastic bag.

Jim takes Junior down to the storm cellar, where he's stockpiling guns. He tells Junior that Max is out to destroy him and hurt him by hurting Junior.

Jim arms Junior and tells him not to open the door for anyone but him.

Outside, lighting starts.

Dodee tries the radio waves again and finds she can pick up outside transmissions, including one that says Barbie is the one they've been looking for and he's inside the dome.

Angie pounds on Junior's door and points to the raging funnel cloud coming from the dome, telling him he has to come back to the group.

At the clinic, a tree branch crashes through the window into Barbie. Julia's heart stops. He sticks a tube in and sucks the air out of her chest.

Junior won't go with Angie until she says she needs him. The storm begins to calm down.

In the clinic, Barbie can't get Julia's heart started again. He thinks she's gone, but her hearts starts again. Joe thinks the fact Barbie saved Julia means he's the ""monarch.""

Max heads back to her island home but notices a body floating in the water. It's her mother, who drowned with her arms tied.

Barbie leaves Julia with the nurse at the clinic to go take care of something. Jim meets him outside, ready to stop Max. First they argue over who wants what for the town. Barbie agrees to work with him to take down Max, but warns Jim he's knocking him off his throne next.

Angie, Junior and Joe come back to the barn. He tells them his theory about Barbie, but Junior takes credit for the storm resolving.

The want to go to the big dome for answers, and decide to go to the same spot in the dome that lines up with their four ""stars"" in relation to the constellations.

Barbie and Jim go to the cement factory, but first Barbie rigs an alarm set to ten minutes.

Phil and Linda check out the shooting scene at Julia's and Phil tells her about Barbie. Linda starts to believe that Barbie killed Peter and Julia found out so he shot her.

Barbie leads Jim through the cement factory in the dark, but Max and her goon get the drop on them with guns to their heads.

Max tells Barbie that Jim killed her mother. Max gives Barbie another chance if he agrees to be with her. He rejects her.

The time reaches zero. He shouts at Jim to get down. The lights go out, Barbie disarms Max and says they're leaving.

After coming up empty at the clinic, Phil tells Linda to check for Barbie at the cement factory.

Barbie starts to walk to his car, but Jim shoots Max and her goon dead.

Jim turns his gun on Barbie and is about to fire, but Barbie disarms him. He has his gun on Jim when Linda pulls up and sees a scene that confirms the suspicions Jim has been stoking all day. Jim thanks Linda for saving him.

Barbie kneels to surrender but decks Linda and runs. She shoots at him, but misses.

Jim goes to the radio station, where Dodee tells him about the military talking about Barbie. Jim makes an emergency broadcast about Max, a ""reputable businesswoman"" being shot and killed and Julia being shot. He announces that Barbie is being charged with their deaths and that of Max's mother. Jim is declaring a state of emergency and says when Barbie is caught, they'll try him and seek the death penalty.

The four kids reach the spot on the dome marked by their stars in the barn. They all touch it. They see Jim on the other side. A wound appears in his chest where Julia was shot, then another in his stomach. His nose starts bleeding. The four kids look down and see they're all holding bloody knives.

When they take their hands off the dome, the vision disappears. Junior runs off in search of his dad.

""Maybe the dome is coming down,"" Norrie says. ""But first, Big Jim has to die,"" Angie says. ""And I think we're supposed to do it,"" Norrie says."

At the café, Jim addresses the worried townspeople. They want houses checked. Jim appears to be swayed by their concerns and declares the state of emergency he's been dying for. Linda doesn't like the idea, but people cheer. Jim gives a rousing speech about the town surviving.

Dodee listens in to military broadcasts from outside and hears mention of the egg and that Barbie is the only one with the expertise to deal with it.

In the barn, Joe is sure that when the caterpillar comes out of the chrysalis everything will change. Angie still thinks the dome wants Jim dead. Carolyn comes in the barn and finds the teens and the dome. Norrie explains what's going on and rather than being mad, Carolyn warns them to hide it so Jim doesn't find it. They decide to take it to Ben's.

Junior finds his dad at the café and is relieved he's alive. Junior warns him he's in danger, but won't say why he knows. Jim tells Junior to ""guard"" Julia Shumway at the hospital and if she wakes up, let only him know.

Dodee tells Jim what she heard on the radio.

Angie locks the barn and gets grabbed from behind -- it's Barbie. He doesn't need to waste any time convincing her he's innocent, she has plenty of reason not to trust Big Jim. Barbie worries that if Julia wakes up, Jim will kill her since she'll exonerate him. He wants to use Angie's candy striper card to get into the hospital.

At the hospital, Junior stands guard over Julia. Outside, Barbie plans to hotwire the ambulance, use the card to get inside and drive away with her. Angie and Barbie share a cigarette in the bushes before activating their half-baked plan.

Jim comes with Dodee to the station. She tells him she's seen the egg the military is looking for. Jim hears the military talking about what's going on inside and mentioning his name as someone in charge. They say he can't be trusted and that surveillance caught him murdering the reverend. Jim scrambles to unplug the radio, but Dodee hears it.

Norrie and Joe bring the mini-dome to Ben's house to hide it.

At the hospital, Angie and Barbie sneak inside and see Junior is the guard for Julia. Angie has an idea.

Big Jim tries to talk his way out of what Dodee heard, saying there's more to the story. She realizes Barbie didn't kill the people Jim said he did. Jim walks closer to her as he says those people were threats to the town. She seems to believe him and goes back to talking about the mini-egg, saying it might be the generator for the dome and he might be able to use it to get the dome down.

Jim pulls his gun, saying the dome can't ever come down.

""You're a sick bastard and one day everyone's going to know it, and they're going to smile when you die,"" Dodee says.

He shoots her dead then blasts the radio and lights the station on fire.

Outside, he radios Linda with the news. Phil is with her and thinks Barbie did it.

Joe and Norrie leave the dome with Ben with instructions not to touch it.

Angie puts on her candy striper outfit and talks to Junior. She asks if he trusts his dad and asks what he's supposed to do if Julia wakes up. When Junior chafes, Angie bats her eyes at him and asks to talk somewhere private. ""I need you,"" she says.

She leads him away and Barbie sneaks in.

Phil reels by the wreckage of the radio station over the news that Dodee is dead. Linda assures him Barbie won't get away with it.

Angie stalls Junior with a hug, trying not to get creeped out by him. She fully sells it, kissing him. He notices she tastes like cigarettes and takes off running. Julia is gone.

At the barn, Carolyn stalls Big Jim and his search party, calling his search unlawful. Finally, his goons physically move her aside. Joe and Norrie come back and the volunteer goons grab them, too. When Jim sees the egg is gone, he has Norrie and Joe taken to the station.

Angie runs out of the hospital warning Barbie that Junior's coming. He gets Julia into the ambulance, tells her loves her and then tells Angie to take off. Barbie gives himself up to Linda. Once he's in cuffs, Phil kicks Barbie in the face.

At the station, Norrie thinks Angie was right about them killing Big Jim. Jim comes to talk to them, telling Joe that Angie is aiding and abetting Barbie, but if he tells Jim where the mini-dome is, he'll let them go.

Norrie laughs at him, calling him ""just some loser trying to scare kids.""

He comes into her cell and she stares him down, saying he doesn't scare her. He threatens her. She lashes at him with a small knife she was hiding, but he pins her easily and walks away unharmed.

Angie hears Linda broadcasting about her. In the back, Julia starts to wake up. Linda brings Barbie in. He tells her he'd never hurt Julia. ""Yea, what about her husband?"" Linda asks.

Upstairs, Carolyn waits in the station, refusing to leave until she sees her daughter. Big Jim asks about the status of Julia.

Ben hears a loud piercing squeal coming from the mini-dome. He tries to cover it with blankets to muffle the noise.

Two of Jim's goons take Joe and Norrie from their cells. They tell Barbie not to talk. After he takes them away, Jim tells Barbie to confess to the charges in public or they'll charge Angie as an accessory, charge Joe and Norrie will Dodee's death and charge Julia with hiring Barbie to kill Peter. Barbie agrees to say whatever Jim wants if he leaves everyone else out of it.

Upstairs, Jim releases Norrie and Joe to Carolyn. Jim tells Linda to put a tail on them, saying they're hiding something that could be their way out.

Jim tells Junior to find Angie and Julia and bring them back. Junior asks why he wants to find Julia now that Barbie's locked up. Junior warns his dad not to lie to him. Jim tells him Barbie confessed and is about to confess to the town. Jim asks if Julia was conscious.

Carolyn, Joe and Norrie pull up to Ben's house with Linda on their trail.

Julia wakes up and remembers a woman she'd never seen before shot her. They're in the storage room at the clinic. Angie dumped the ambulance and got Julia down there in a service elevator. Angie catches her up on Jim's moves.

Jim brings Barbie out in front of town hall to address the gathered townspeople. He makes a speech about there still being rules, justice and punishment inside the dome. He recites the murder charges.

Back at Ben's, he unveils the loud and angry dome. Junior goes back to the spot on the big dome where the four had their vision of his father dying. He puts his hands on it.

Big Jim asks Barbie how he pleads.

Back in Ben's room, Linda joins them and stares at the shrieking mini-dome and egg, which is now glowing red.

Jim asks him again how he pleads. He says ""not guilty."""

The kids try to explain their theory to Linda that it's the power source for the dome.

Back at the station, Jim is angry at Barbie for daring to say in front of everyone that he's not guilty of the murders Jim is trying to pin on him.

Junior waits for a sign at the edge of the dome. ""Tell me why you want me to kill my father!""

Wounded Julia tries to get up from her hospital bed to try to exonerate Barbie.

Back at Ben's, Linda wants to take possession of the mini-dome, but they've noticed the monarch is bouncing off the dome walls and leaving black splotches. It flutters to the ground. Ben looks out the window and notices the same thing happening to the big dome.

Jim takes a break from threatening Barbie to go look at what's happening outside. The splotches are slowly blacking out the dome, turning it to night inside. The whole dome turns black, blocking out the outside world.

It's the middle of the day, but looks like it's midnight.

Linda radios her deputies and tells the kids she's impounding it. The mini-dome starts screeching. Norrie and Joe suggest they touch it and make it stop, but Linda insists she's the only one who can touch it. She does and it zaps her across the room, knocking her out, just like Joe and Norrie expected.

Junior arrives and they have just a few seconds to convince him to help before his father gets there.

Julia and Angie head to the police station to get Barbie.

Jim arrives at Ben's and finds Linda knocked out. She wants to find the mini-dome as a way to get free of the dome, exactly what he doesn't want.

Joe and Norrie worry how to find Angie, the fourth person they need for the mini-dome. Junior knows she has a police radio.

At the station, Barbie is stopped by Phil and a deputy, he fights them off, but Angie has to knock one out with a fire extinguisher.

Joe broadcasts a message that only his sister will understand, telling her to go where they went to hide when they broke their mom's old mirror.

She finds them at the cement factory. Junior draws on Barbie when he sees them, but Julia explains Maxine shot her, not Barbie.

Phil radios Linda about Barbie's escape.

The four kids put their hands on the mini-dome. It glows pink then emits a blinding white light. Then it totally disintegrates, leaving just the egg. But the monarch is dead.

Or at least it appears that way until Norrie touches it. It flutters back to life and flirts around, circling Barbie. ""I knew it, you're the monarch,"" Joe says.

Jim drives through town and sees freaked out people pouring into the church. They think it's the end times.

Jim goes in and finds the pews packed with scared, praying people. He strolls up to the front of the church and fields questions from people worried about running out of food or freezing with no sunlight. He preaches faith.

Back in the cement factory, the egg glows hot white and starts quaking. Around them, the walls start shaking. Everyone starts to run, but Julia reaches for it.

The shaking stops and the butterfly lands on the egg in Julia's hands. ""She's your monarch,"" Barbie says.

At the station, Jim asks Phil to put together a work detail of carpenters. He wants to build a gallows.

Linda checks out the McAlister's barn and sees the phrase ""The pink stars are falling in lines."" She reads it to Jim over the walkie. He's stunned. He hasn't heard it in a long time.

Back in the cement factory, they look to Julia for answers. When she doesn't have any, Junior gets angry. He wants to take the egg to his dad, even after Barbie tells him Jim executed Maxine. Junior doesn't believe her and pulls his gun on Julia, demanding the egg. She tosses it to Angie and tells her to run.

Barbie, who is still handcuffed, tries to tackle Junior so Julia can get away.

Jim takes Linda to his wife's studio, explaining that towards the end, she kept saying ""the pink stars are falling in lines"" over and over again. He shows her a painting of the egg surrounded by pink stars.

Angie, Norrie, Joe and Julia meet up in the dark forest. Norrie asks the egg what they should do. She sees an image of her dead mother, Alice.

""Sweetheart, I don't think that's your mother,"" Julia says.

""Forgive us, we're still learning how to speak with you. We've taken on a familiar appearance to help bridge the divide,"" not-Alice says. She says the dome was sent to protect them, and they'll see from what in time.

""If you want to darkness to abate, you must earn the light by protecting the egg,"" Alice says.

""And if we fail, it's the end, isn't it? For all of us,"" Julia realizes.

When Julia asks who they're protecting it from, not-Alice disappears.

Junior brings Barbie back to the station. Jim questions him about the egg.

Jim radios a broadcast for Julia's ears, telling her to bring the egg or Barbie will pay the ultimate price.

Junior goes to his dad, wanting to believe he's not a murderer. They talk about Pauline's connection to the dome. Jim admits he's killed people, but only people who needed to be killed for the good of the town. Jim now thinks the Rennies are important to the town and the dome and his late wife's paintings were a message. He promises no more secrets between them and hugs his son.

Meanwhile, Julia and the kids worry about how to protect Chester's Mill and save Barbie. Julia says they shouldn't do anything. She tells Angie and Joe to get somewhere safe.

The town gathers at the gallows. Jim announces that Barbie is sentenced to death. Junior puts the noose around his neck as, out on a boat on the lake, Julia takes the egg and, holding Barbie's dog tags in her other hand, drops the egg over the side into the dark water.

It glows a bright purple from the bottom of the lake and suddenly pink stars start rising from the lake, in lines. From around the gallows, the town sees the stars shoot up into the sky. Jim announces it as a sign from god that they're doing the right thing and prepares to carry on with his execution.

The stars coalesce at the top of the dome and shine brightly, the black falls away from the dome. Jim shouts at Junior to pull the lever."

A woman jogs over a bridge in daylight.

This is intercut with a girl running from an attacker at night through the woods. She tries to hide. She is found.

The jogging woman comes upon the dead body of an animal on the beach. Her phone rings, her name is Linden, Sarah Linden, she is a police detective.

We get a title telling us it is Day One

Through the rain Linden goes to a crime scene, Jane Doe found in an old warehouse. It's her last day on the job. She heads into the darkened warehouse with her flashlight. There is blood spatter on the walls and bloody clothing on the floor. The body is hanging as if it's a piece of meat. She goes to uncover it and it's a blow-up doll. It's all a big hoax, it's a surprise going away party from her fellow cops.

She heads home with the blow-up doll. Her house is in the middle of being packed up and her fiance Rick kisses her sweetly. The movers are on the way. Her son Jack is with a friend. He asks if she's ready to do this: sell her condo, quit her job, move her kid away, and marry him. She kisses him and shows him she is. He takes off, he has an earlier flight. As he leaves she says she does want to marry him. He leaves. She looks around a little less sure perhaps. She grabs some of her son's art and photos from the fridge.

Back at her office, Linden is interrupted by the new detective moving into her office, Holder. She's just finishing up packing. She tells him she's moving to Sonoma. They make small talk. Her boss comes in and gives her a case and tells her to take Holder and show him how to work a scene. He says he knows how. The boss says she can hand off the case at the end of her shift and still make her flight.

They drive to the crime scene in the rain and talk about the angst of the homicide beat and his previous work as a narc. They arrive. It's no longer raining. No body yet, but bloody clothes found in a field where meth heads hang out. There's also an ATM card belonging to a Stanley Larsen. Linden surveys the field. She tells the beat cop to hold down the fort and tells Holder he can take it if he wants, she has packing to do. He tells her to keep on it and he won't let her miss her flight. He says they should go talk to Stanley Larsen.

We meet Larsen, he arrives to pick up some meat from a meat locker at a market. He gets a call from his wife saying he needs to get home right now.

In an establishing flashback: A woman mops the floor as Stan fixes some plumbing with duct tape. It's Stan's wife, Mitch. He has not fixed anything. They banter and bicker and he drops her on the wet kitchen floor and kisses her. She sends him off with a kiss. Mitch tells Stan that their daughter Rosie has applied for college. The wife says it's good even though it's out of state. She says they need to let her grow up sometime since she's almost 18. They start making out again and he walks off with a smile towards a moving and storage truck with his name on the side.

He drives by posters for a political campaign for a Darren Richmond, a suave, hot politician. We move to a shot of him in a graveyard paying respects to someone. He gets a call and tells someone he is on his way. We cut to him meeting with his campaign staff, he's a councilman with an election for mayor nearing and they're all nervous. It's implied that he's sleeping with his female campaign manager/aide Gwen. In a meeting they feel confident that they're going to win with several chits on their side including an endorsement from a councilwoman Yitanes.

Linden and Holder interview Mrs. Larsen who says she's sure Stan stayed in last night after getting in late from a camping trip. Linden notices a pink bike in the Larsen garage and asks if Mrs. Larsen has a daughter. She has, Rosie, who she hasn't heard from her since Friday night, she was supposedly staying with friends.

One of those friends is at school furiously texting Rosie asking where she is. Her name is Sterling and she tells school officials that Rosie stayed with her but didn't come to school with her. Sterling gets a nosebleed. (Apparently, the council candidates are coming to the school to do a Q&A with the kids). Her teacher knows she was lying and asks for the truth.

Back at the Larsen house, Mitch is going over her last encounters with Rosie and her knowledge of her plans. She says she was wearing a pink sweater, like the kind they found. She says her daughter doesn't have a history of running away but she wasn't worried when she didn't hear from her since they were camping out of cell phone range. She said it's not like they left a little kid home alone. Linden looks at Rosie's room, the happy pictures and collages and pink bedspread. They get a call from the school, Sterling admitted Rosie wasn't with her and the last time anyone saw Rosie was Friday at a Halloween dance.

Richmond preps for his school appearance. He asks his Gwen to move in with him. She says he can break hearts after he gets the single female vote. She says she knows where he was this morning and he wishes that he would talk to her about ""her."" (I'm guessing his dead wife?) He is informed the police have arrived. They cancel the candidates' appearance because they have to investigate Rosie's disappearance. His opponent, the current mayor, Adams tells him to not count on the councilwoman's endorsement.

The kids are sent back to their home rooms. Sterling sees the police in the distance and heads the other way. The cops can't find her. The teacher tells them that Rosie was with Sterling at the party, where she was dressed as a witch. The cop tries to bait the teacher into saying Rosie was a ""hot piece."" He doesn't take the bait. Linden tells Holder to keep up with the case, she got a call from her son's school asking to come pick him up.

Sterling rides her bike to an alley to find a bunch of teen boys hanging out. She's looking for someone named Jasper. She finds another skate kid, he tells her Jasper scored some X and took Rosie to an island to ""bone"" her.

We cut to this Jasper playing video games in some swanky pad. A woman writhes and moans upstairs on a bed, it's hard to tell if it's from pain or pleasure. Jasper seems unconcerned either way.

Linden picked up Jack who got caught smoking at school. She drops him off at someone named Regi's house. Jack seems disgruntled about the move and Rick, his future stepdad. She says Rick is trying his best and that they're going to be happy in California. She gets a call from Holder who's sweeping the field. She says she has to go.

Mitch is calling Stan leaving messages. Her other two kids, two little boys. come home calling out to Rosie. She tells the babysitter, her sister Terry, she doesn't know anything about Rosie. The boys are looking for Rosie and Terry says she'll take them out and Mitch apologizes to her saying she's crazy right now and Rosie's going to get the ass-kicking of her life when she gets home.

Stan comes home and he and Mitch worry about Rosie and the cops asking about birthmarks and scars. Stan worries that it's that ""rich jack-off"" she's dating and that she's 17 and just being a teenager. He says he'll find her and leaves and tells Mitch to stay home and wait for her.

The field search turns up a trail through the woods thanks to the K-9 unit. Holder says the dad's alibi checked out. Linden says they still need to talk to him. She seems very invested in the scene now and less interested in her flight. She gets a call for a possible murder site.

At Richmond's headquarters, his aides try to convince him to jump on the Larsen thing as a way to say ""campaign be damned."" Richmond dismisses this saying he won't use a family tragedy as a soundbite. He says his opponent Adams, who released a press release while they were supposed to be at the school meeting, knew about the endorsement from the councilwoman Yitanes, that's what they need to worry about. He gets a call from someone who is worried about a reporter calling her and asking about his ""trips."" Trips only they and Gwen, and his other aide Jamie, know about.

Stan finds Sterling and asks where Rosie is. She says she's at Jasper's house.

Stan calls Mitch and tells her and that's he going to the island to pick her up. Mitch is relieved.

Linden gets a call from her boss saying they found Rosie. He doesn't confirm that he actually spoke with her. Linden tells the other cops to wrap it up, they're done.

Stan arrives at Jasper's swanky island pad. (It's his parents, they're out of town.) Stan manhandles him even though Jasper says she's not there. He uncovers the woman in the bed, it's not Rosie.

Back in the field Linden gets a call from Rick who proposes pizza after he picks them up at the airport. He proposes a barbecue to let Jack get to know the neigborhood kids. All the while Holder is honking the horn and yelling at her it's time to go. She notices some kids walking down a road with fishing poles and wonders where it leads. Puget Sound. There's also a lake on the other side. A search of the lake turns up a car. A search of the car turns up Rosie in the trunk.

Stan calls Mitch to tell her he's at the park because he heard they found her sweater there. She tells the boys to go watch videos. He says he doesn't know where else to go. As he approaches he sees the police roadblock. He leaves Mitch hanging on the phone. The police try to hold him back. He arrives just as, in the distance, they find her body. Linden goes to break the news, without really breaking it. The cops hold him back in his grief, which Mitch hears over the phone in the kitchen, freaking out in front of the now freaked out boys yelling ""Stan!!""

The plates of the car say it belongs to Richmond.

We cut to Richmond chatting at an evening fundraiser, then cut back to the scene with photos being taken of the body and Stan Larsen crumpling to his knees. Linden is clearly going to miss her flight.

Mitch arrives at the morgue. She meets Stan. They embrace and cry as Linden and Holder watch. They ID the body.

Linden interrogates Stan. He remembers seeing her Friday before school and says she didn't seem any different than normal, he was on the phone taking an order and she waved. Holder interrogates Mitch who can't think of anyone who might've done this to Rosie. She's still in shock talking about her daughters broken fingernails.

Stan says his daughter wasn't involved in politics, she mostly hung with her brothers and Sterling. Jasper was a short-term boyfriend.

The boss says the coroner has no cause of death yet. He tells Linden to call the campaign and to dot her i's on this. She says she's done and has a wedding to plan. He says she's on the clock until he says she isn't. Rick calls and she tells him that she's being told to stay. He's very understanding and says to get home soon.

Linden tells Stan and Mitch to go home, get rest, and keep it within the family for now. He asks why she asked if Rosie was into politics. She says they're looking at every angle. Stan asks if they'll find who did this. She says they'll do their best. He asks Holder. Holder says yeah.

Richmond is on his way home with Gwen. He took in $24k at the fundraiser and they're on their way home to a nice Pinot. Gwen gets a call from the police. She tells Richmond about Rosie being found in a campaign car. He tells Linden and Holder he will totally cooperate. He says he doesn't understand how his campaign could be involved. They ask about his alibi. He's got one, he was in Tacoma at an inn. They ask if there's anyone else can vouch for him Friday night. Gwen can, of course. They want to issue a press release. Linden wants until midnight at least since the killer probably doesn't know they found her. The police leave. Gwen and Jamie tell him to call a press conference immediately and ignore the police, the election is a month away and this could sink it. Jamie says to make a play to get close to the family saying he knows what they're going through. Richmond declines saying they will send out a press release at noon the next day and hire a PI and find out what happened with the car. He says he's not using his dead wife for his campaign. Gwen convinces him to tell Yitanes before the police news blindsides her so as not to lose her endorsement. He tells her that the reporter called him yesterday with a tip from inside their office. He tells her to follow it up and find out who's leaking.

Linden checks in with her son. She and Holder find out that the last driver of the car was a female volunteer and then it was carjacked. The keys were in the ignition to begin with.

The Larsens awake the next morning. It is raining. Terry offers to cook and then breaks down crying thinking Rosie is still just missing. She says she didn't tell the boys anything. Stan tells Mitch to get some sleep. Instead she looks into Rosie's room and then shuts the door.

Stan goes to work, a zombie. His work buddy asks what's up, says the police called and asked some of the guys to come to the station.

Sterling arrives at school and Jasper accosts her. He says he's not ""sticking it"" to Rosie anymore and is mad Sterling said they were together. The teacher comes out and says the police want to talk to them both.

Sterling tells Holder they went to the dance and then couldn't find her after and figured she went to Jasper's. She says she doesn't know where she went. Sterling is very upset. Holder tells her it's not her fault.

Jasper says he picked up some ""old lady"" Friday night at a bar and offers her phone number as an alibi. He says he and Rosie didn't date, but hooked up for like two seconds. Jasper's dad arrives in a huff since he can't be talked to without an attorney. He asks the cops and the principal to leave him alone with his son. He promptly slaps him and asks what he did this time.

Holder and Linden go over the video from the dance, while Jack sits in the corner. Holder likes Jasper for the perp. Linden wonders why him, how would he have access to a Richmond campaign car? Linden wonders what a good girl like Rosie was doing with a boy like Jasper. Turns out he has a previous auto theft, a joy ride in a Ferrari, no charges pressed since his dad's a big wig property owner on Mercer Island. Most other potential perps are cleared which makes Jasper their best bet. They get word that Richmond is releasing his press release in an hour.

At Richmond's campaign they hear the staff is in the clear and the car was carjacked. Councilman Ruth Yitanes arrives and Richmond's going to spill but then Linden arrives to tell him to hold off on the release and she promises to tell the press how cooperative he was in putting this family's tragedy ahead of his campaign. She makes herself forcefully clear. He tells her she has until midnight. Linden gets a call and thanks him for his help. Richmond tells Gwen to call a reporter and tell him he'll get the scoop.

He goes back and tells Yitanes that he smoked pot in college in case it comes out. She laughs it off and says not to get caught with some intern's face in his crotch. She can't believe that's all he needed to tell her. He says ""scout's honor.""

Mitch and Stan go to pick up their boys. Stan gets a call saying the cops are at the house. They go to take the boys to fly a kite. One of them can tell something is up.

Linden meets Holder at a dumpster where he found Rosie's wig from the dance.

Linden addresses some kids at the school. She asks if any of them saw her at the dance or after. She gets nothing from any of them. Apparently, she's addressing several groups of kids.

Richmond is going door to door canvassing for the vote.

Jamie tries to get Richmond to tell Yitanes the truth. Richmond says she will have already given her endorsement by the time the news come out. They're waiting.

The boys ask about Rosie. Stan tells them, he tries to tell them as gently as possible, saying Rosie went to heaven like grandma. One of them, Tommy, gets very upset. Stan reassures the other one that they're going to be okay, he doesn't look so sure.

Richmond checks in with another campaign aide, Nathan, about checking the campaign email accounts for leaks. He says they all checked out but he didn't check Gwen and Jamie. Richmond tells him to do it and get back to him.

Linden uses the restroom at the school and sees ""Rosie"" scrawled in a mirror. She has to go pick up Jack and Holder says he's going to stay and do some more digging. He says it's not her case anymore and he'll take care of it. She goes to leave.

The Larsens arrive home and Terry is cleaning up after the cops. Terry asks Mitch why she didn't call Rosie to check in all weekend.

Holder hangs at the soccer field smoking pot and talks with two girls. They're surprised since he's a cop. He offers them a hit and promises not to arrest them. It's weird he makes sure that one of them inhales. One of them claims to be high immediately. He asks if they're going to party. The ""high"" one says yes. He asks how old she is, she says old enough. He says he's going to leave since there's no place to party. They suggest ""the cage"" in the basement. He goes to investigate.

Linden looks at the video again from the party as Jack waits. He wants to stay through the weekend to go to a friend's party. She says Rick is waiting and he has to go to school. She reiterates that she knows the move is hard but it's going to be great and they're leaving in five minutes. Her boss arrives with COD, drowning, Rosie was alive when the car went in the water, ripped off her own fingernails trying to get out of the trunk. They couldn't tell if she was raped. Linden says she's not staying. Her boss says he'll have someone drive her and Jack to the airport.

Stan is working late in his office. He turns off the news just as something about Richmond comes on. He notices a yellowed child's drawing on his file cabinet made by Rosie. He heads home. The boys are watching TV and don't know where their mother is.

Richmond is on his way to the union meeting where Yitanes is going to give her endorsement. Gwen and Jamie pump him up. Richmond gets a call and gives a no comment. It was a reporter calling for confirmation that Rosie was found in his campaign car.

Linden arrives at ""the cage."" Holder says it's where the ""real"" Halloween party went down. There appears to be a mattress, maybe covered in blood, with Rosie's witch hat on the floor next to it. Linden has missed her flight.

Richmond and his aides ride in silence.

Stan opens his bedroom door to see Mitch lying on the bed, curled up, catatonic.

Linden watches as the crime scene guys take pictures of bloody handprints on the wall."

Cutting between her run we see flashes of a young brunette being chased by someone with a flashlight through the woods. She seems terrified. Linden arrives on a beach and finds a dead seal. She gets a call.

Linden arrives at the call and tells the officer it's her last day. But it turns out to be Linden's co-workers giving her a surprise party for her last day.

Linden goes home and spends a few minutes with fiancé Rick. We learn they are moving to California and she and son Jack will fly out that night to meet Rick, who is taking an earlier flight. We learn teenager Jack doesn't love the idea of the move.

At the office the guy who is going to replace Linden, Stephen Holder, shows up earlier than expected. She tells him she's moving to the San Francisco area. Lieutenant Oakes shows up and gives her a call to check out.

Linden takes Holder along to the call. On the way he tells Linden he's coming to homicide from working undercover narcotics with the county.

Holder says the scene is a park known to be frequented by drug addicts. They are shown a bloody, dry-cleaned pink sweater and an ATM card with the name Stanley Larsen on it. With no body, Linden wants to hand it off to the sex crimes unit. Holder wants them to look into it.

We cut to Stan Holder (a mover) at a job. His wife Mitch calls him home with a plumbing emergency. Before he heads back out for work Mitch tells him 17-year old daughter Rosie has finally said she'll apply for colleges, provided they are out-of-state.

We see city councilman and mayoral candidate Darren Richmond by himself at a cemetery. He's called away by Jamie, his campaign manager. At headquarters he is greeted by Jamie and Gwen Eaton, his top advisor. It sounds like Richmond and Gwen are lovers. During a campaign meeting Richmond tells his staff that he's been told he's getting an endorsement from Ruth Yitanes an influential councilwoman. We're less than a month from the election and the sense is that Richmond has a good chance to win.

Linden and Holder show up at the Larsen's looking for Stan. Mitch tells them her husband was home all weekend. On the way out Linden notices a pink bike and asks if they have a daughter. Mitch said Rosie was at a friend's house all weekend but hasn't spoken with her since Friday.

At school Rosie's friend Sterling is panicking trying to find out of if anyone knows where Rosie is. In the hall the principal and Bennett, her teacher, ask her about Rosie. She says Rose was with her but Bennett immediately knows she is lying.

Mitch tells Holder Rosie may have been wearing a pink sweater. Mitch gets a call with confirmation that Rosie did not stay at Sterling's house like she told her parents. Linden glances into Rosie's room and sees a huge butterfly collage on the wall. No one has seen Rosie since a Halloween dance Friday night.

Just before going on stage for a debate at Rosie's school with the mayor, Richmond asks Gwen to move in with him. She won't, using the single female vote as part of the reason. She adds that she knows where he was that morning and ""I wish you'd talk to me about her.""

When Richmond and the mayor find out about the police investigation they decide to cancel a scheduled assembly. The mayor takes Richmond aside and mentions Yitanes' endorsement which Richmond had told his staff to keep hush-hush.

Bennett tells Linden and Holder that Rosie was dressed as a witch for the dance. Linden gets a call from Jack's school.

Sterling asks a kid about someone named Jasper. She asks if Rosie was with him. The friend says Jasper's parents were out of town and thinks she might have been over there.

We cut to a shirtless kid on the couch of a nice house playing video games and ignoring his phone. He looks back and we see a girl with dark hair tossing and turning up in the bedroom.

Jack was caught smoking cigarettes. She drops him off with friend before getting a call from Holder. Jack's doesn't want to move and hasn't fully accepted Rick.

Mitch's sister Terry and the Larsen's two young sons come home from school. Mitch finally tracks down Stan to tell him about Rosie.

Mitch tells Stan she though Rosie was no longer dating Jasper.

The K-9 unit found a scent in the wooded area from the opening chase scene but nothing has been found. Holder thinks the area is a dead-end but Linden isn't so sure.

Richmond tells Jamie and Gwen about the endorsement information getting out. Jamie want them to take advantage of missing girl was He gets a call from an old girlfriend and staffer who says a reporter is asking about ""trips"" he took that nobody besides she, Gwen and Jamie know about. And she hasn't told anyone.

Stan tracks down Sterling, who tells him she thinks Rosie is at Jasper's house. Stan calls Mitch to say he's on his way to pick her up. She's relieved.

Linden gets a call from Oakes about Rosie apparently being with an old boyfriend. He wants to shut down the investigation. The still aren't finding anything near where the scent was located.

Stan bursts into Jasper's home (the video game kid) looking for Rosie. He barges upstairs and sees the girl Jasper has in his bed is not Rosie.

Rick gives Linden a call to talk about that night. While she listens she seems to notice something on the map. She then spots kids headed somewhere with fishing poles. There is a nearby lake. We cut to the police pulling a car out of the lake.

Stan calls Mitch with news about Rosie not being at Jasper's. He's headed to the place they found Rosie's sweater and happens upon a police road block. With Mitch still listening on his phone he runs up the check point and is stopped by officers. Up the road an officer tells Linden the car was registered to the Richmond campaign. The trunk of the car is popped and Linden looks down at a girl's body. She tells Stan only that he can't be there, but he (and Mitch via the phone) clearly knows what has happened.

Stan and Mitch identify Rosie's body at the morgue. Afterwards they are questioned by Linden and Holder. Stan says Rosie was a quite girl who liked spending time with her brothers and was usually home on the weekends. Rosie has no political connections they were aware of.

Oakes tells the detectives there is no cause of death and asks Linden if she will stick around another day because of the delicacy of the political component. Linden tells Rick she have to miss her flight and he's good-natured about the change.

Linden and Holder ask the Larsen's not tell anyone about Rosie's death for at least another day or so. Stan asks if they will find who killed Rosie. Much to Linden's dismay Holder promises ""yes.""

Richmond and Gwen are called to his office to meet with Linden and Holder. They learn about the car and about Rosie, who after a check has no connection with Richmond whatsoever. Richmond agrees to help the investigation by not announcing anything related until the next night. Once the police leave Jamie and Gwen want Richmond to ignore his promise, in part because they don't want Yitanes to hear the news from someone else. He agrees to a press conference the next day at noon just after a short meeting with the councilwoman. When the room has cleared Richmond tells Gwen a reporter told him he was tipped off about the Yitanes endorsement. Someone sent an email from the office but the reporter wouldn't say whom.

It turn out the campaign vehicle had been reported stolen on Saturday morning. The workers were known to leave the keys inside the cars.

Mitch and Stan have a sleepless night. They tell Terry (who doesn't yet know Rosie is dead) they will try and keep the boys away from the police investigation as much as possible.

Jasper grabs Sterling outside the school, pissed that she told Stan Rosie was with him. Bennett tells them the police are at school to question some of the kids.

Sterling tells Holder she doesn't have any idea where Rosie went and Jasper did not go the dance. Jasper tells Linden he picked up an older woman at a bar on Friday night. During questioning Jasper's important-looking father shows up and shuts down the process. After clearing the room he slaps Jasper violently across the face, asking ""what did you do this time?""

Linden and Holder watch video the school took of the dance. Rosie was dressed as a witch, having lied to her parents about the costume which featured $2,000 shoes. Rosie was a good girl ""with no secrets"" and Linden can't figure out why she was with Jasper. Jasper's only criminal background is a stolen car/joy ride, but because his father is incredibly wealthy no charges were pressed. Oakes says the Richmond campaign is about to issue a press release.

While the leaks have turned up empty, Jamie has learned the campaing car was stolen. Councilwoman Yitanes arrives, but before Richmond call tell her about Rosie's murder Gwen pulls him out into the hall to speak with Linden. She convinced him that if he issues the release he'll be ""the candidate who obstructed a child's murder investigation."" He agrees to wait until midnight. After Linden leaves Richmond suggests they tell a reporter about him helping the investigation with the condition being the story doesn't come out until after midnight. He tells Yitanes a bogus story.

Holder finds Rosie's wig in a dumpster outside the school. Inside the detectives get no help from the students, none of whom say they even saw Rosie at the dance.

Mitch and Stan tell their sons that Rosie has died.

Richmond meets privately with the investigator who looked at the campaign e-mail accounts. The investigator initially never checked Jamie or Gwen's account and Richmond instructs him to do so.

Holder tells Linden he's going to stay at the school and do some more digging. It's technically now his case. Linden leaves to pick-up Jack, essentially resigned from the case.

The Larsen's arrive home to Terry cleaning up after the cops. When they're alone Terry asks Mitch ""Why didn't you call her? All weekend?""

Holder lingers after the girls team's soccer practice, smoking what appears to be weed off the side. Two girls approach him and he offers them a few hits. He starts talking about wanting to find a play to ""party."" The second they mention something ""in the basement, the cage,"" he walks away.

We see Holder walking through the basement with a flashlight. He comes to a chain link fence and starts straight ahead.

Linden and Jack sit in her office while she watches footage of Rosie. After Jack leaves Oakes walks in and tells Linden Rosie was still alive when the car was run into the lake, and that the drowning girl ripped off her fingernails trying to get out of the trunk. Linden repeats that she's not going to stay, but then is intrigued after walking into the hallway and seeing the crime scene unit head out.

At work Stan stares at a picture Rosie made for him as a child. When he returns home Mitch is nowhere to be found and the boys haven't been fed.

On the way to a political appearance Richmond gets a call from a reporter asking him to confirm that Rosie's body was found in one of his campaign cars. He says ""No comment"" and hangs up.

Linden shows up in the school basement and asks Holder what is going on: ""This is where the real Halloween party went down,"" he says, pointing to a corner. She looks over and sees a filthy mattress lying on the floor. Next to it appears to be Rosie's witch hat.

Councilman Richmond is confronted by the press about his car's connection to the Rosie Larsen murder. He talks about cooperating with the police about this senseless and brutal crime and he offers condolences to the Larsen family.

Holder and Sarah investigate the weird crime scene in the cage. There is drug paraphernalia. Sarah wonders if it's an OD that went wrong, then notices a peephole in the wall and looks through it. Her boss tells her it's still her problem at least until the end of the week even though she's already resigned. The principal comes down to the basement and surveys the scene with horror.

Richmond is pissed when he arrives at his event. Then Yitanes marches in, also pissed that he didn't tell her. He says the police told him not to. She pulls her endorsement saying ""We are over!""

The principal brings Sarah and Holder further into ""the cage"" in the basement. The peephole goes into a storage area that looks out onto the bed where Rosie was presumably killed. The custodian had keys to the area.

At the Larsen house Stan is struggling to take care of the boys in the wake of the murder. They want chocolate chip pancakes for dinner. Stan is game and says not to wake Mitch. One of the boys asks how Rosie died. The other assures Stan it's okay, that he doesn't have to talk about it.

Holder asks how long Sarah is staying. She says a week and tells him to chill out. They go to look for the custodian, Linden Johnson Rosales, from the school at a rundown apartment. They talk to a woman who speaks Spanish and says he is not there and doesn't live there. Sarah looks around.and finds copies of ""Nasty Cheerleaders"" magazine. The suspect is there, however, and attacks Sarah with an edged weapon, then leaps out the three story window and fractures his skull.

At the hospital Sarah sees Richmond on the evening news. She gets stitched up from the attack. Holder discovers Linden's got warrants but he's not their guy because he spent the weekend in the drunk tank. Sarah says to keep an eye on him and call her when he wakes up.

She calls Rick and tells him she's staying through the weekend and has been asked to see it through. He's annoyed. She says they'll be there Sunday for the party and that she still wants to get married. He hangs up without responding to her ""I love you."" She goes to pick up Jack from Reggie's. He's out cold. Reggie is a female friend of Sarah's who owns a boat. She talks about hoping for a fresh start for Jack in California. Sarah thanks her for letting her and Jack stay. Reggie calls them her two favorite people in the world and is happy to do it. Sarah gets in bed with Jack and falls asleep, even though she said she had to get back to work. Reggie lets her sleep.

Day Three

Mitch wakes to the sound of Rosie's voice on the outgoing answering machine message. Meanwhile Stan is staring at the rain and despairing. He picks up the morning paper and Rosie's murder is the lead story. He sees that Councilman Richmond has been questioned. Mitch plays the message again. Stan finds her kneeling over the machine and listening. He kneels down with her hugs her.

Richmond goes to see the mayor, his opponent, who tells him the race is clearly over now and so he should bow out and in four years get his endorsement. Richmond declines saying Adams will just get on his knees for the developers for four more years. Adams taunts Richmond, musing if his opponent really thought the police would keep it secret for him.

Richmond goes to Sarah, livid. She says the leak didn't come from them. She asks what she can do. He says ""make an arrest.""

Back at the high school the teacher gets the class under control -- by confiscating a 'phone from a student -- and starts talking about Rosie and grief counselors. Sterling runs from the class. So does Jasper.

Sarah meets up with Holder at the hospital. Rosales is out of surgery but hazy from drugs. Holder distracts the guard and Sarah goes to talk to Rosales. She apologizes and tells him the real reason she needs to talk to him. She shows him a picture of Rosie and asks if he saw her in the basement Friday night. He nods. Sarah shows him a page from Rosie's yearbook and asks which boy she was with. He points to Jasper and another boy, Kris Echols. The nurse comes in and freaks that Rosales is in critical condition and they're bothering him and demanding that leave. As Sarah departs, Rosales whispers to her ""El Diablo.""

Richmond tells his staff that they're doing everything to cooperate with the police and they need to take a deep breath and stay the course. He tells them to commit to winning this campaign. Gwen and Jamie have got stuff worked up for Richmond to address the press. First he goes to talk to his guy Nathan investigating the leaked E-mails. There's nothing on Rosie Larsen but there is a leak on the Yitanes endorsement.

Holder learns that Kris Echols is a meth-dealing skater boy, kicked out of school, reported as a runaway by his mom. He and Sarah and the lieutenant talk about the case. Holder goes to talk to Echols' family while Sarah plans to talk to the Larsens' about the cause of death. Going over the party video one more time they realize how Echols got into the party, he wore a devil's mask: ""El Diablo.""

Echols skates up to a dumpster and pulls out a newspaper with the news about Rosie's body being found.

On a TV, the mayor crows about his new 44.6 million dollar waterfront renewal project.

Gwen switches it off saying she can't believe he didn't throw in a jab about Rosie's murder. Richmond says he didn't have to, the damage is done. Gwen says Yitanes hasn't endorsed him yet and they need to stay on message. He says to spare him the soundbite, he's found their leak, the person who went to the press about Yitanes. It was Jamie. Gwen can't understand. They wonder if he's playing both sides, if Richmond doesn't win than maybe Adams will give him an appointment. At the moment Jamie enters and asks about the rest of the day's agenda. He suggests sending flowers to the Larsen's. Richmond says no, since flowers die.

Sarah goes to speak to the Larsens. She explains that Rosie drowned. That she was alive in the trunk of the car when it went in the water. Sarah says she thought they should know. They are understandably upset, about that and finding out about Richmond in the paper. She says they are working on an arrest. She asks about Kris Echols. They had been friends. She asks if Rosie drank or used drugs. They say no and are wondering why she's asking. She says they're casting a wide net. Stan says Kris seemed like a good kid. Mitch asks if she suffered. Sarah says they think she was unconscious when the car went in, not disclosing the information about her shredded findertips from trying to claw her way out of the truck.

Richmond has a photo op playing basketball against a young black kid. He loses. It's part of an ""all-stars"" program that is supposed to be part of Richmond's anti-gang campaign. The press asks again about Rosie. They offer little. Jamie tells him to stop giving them anything. Richmond mentions the leak. Jamie says it was the cops, that everyone is playing both sides. Richmond doesn't tip his hand.

Holder interviews Kris' heart-broken mom who says he started using drugs at 13. She hasn't seen him in awhile, most recently at a horrible area near a bridge where the lost boys hang out.

Holder goes down there and smokes some ""pot,"" mingling with the kids. He asks around about Kris as if he's looking for drugs. A girl asks if he's a cop. He asks if he looks like a cop, countering by asking if she's a cop. She says Kris isn't around but will be later.

He heads back to Sarah in the car, who smells the pot. He tells her it's ""narc scent,"" smells and tastes like weed but isn't. They note the skate park is walking distance from the campaign parking lot and Kris could've stolen the car. They decide to wait it out.

Jamie suggests a way to get Yitanes' endorsement back, hire her husband, a plumber, for a job that she can't hire him for. Bribery, essentially. Gwen shows him the incriminating E-mail. He sputters his account must have been hacked. They aren't having it. Jamie says Richmond is letting sex -- i.e. his relationship with Gwen -- cloud his judgement. Richmond isn't having that either. Jamie says ""screw both of you"" and angrily leaves.

Sarah calls Jack with the news she won't be home for dinner, as she and Holder still wait in the car. Echols arrives at the skate park. Holder and Sarah go to talk to him. He tries to take off, they try to question him. Holder puts the grab on him and Sarah says to let him go. As Kris takes off, Holder tells him that his mom is worried about him.

Yitanes goes to Richmond mad that he said in the papers she's still considering endorsing him. She says she thought she made herself clear. He offers his proposition, for her and her husband. She is shocked by his flagrant attempt at bribery. He says he needs her sway with the union and her husband needs a job. She says he must think she's easy. He says nothing's easy with her.

The 'phone that the teacher confiscated earlier rings in his desk. He looks at it, concerned.

Kris goes and finds Jasper at the school and punches him out, thinking he ratted him out to the police about being at the dance. Jasper says he didn't tell them anything. Kris says ""they know"" and takes off. Sarah and Holder watch this. Sarah notes that Rosie wouldn't have gone in the basement alone with Kris, but she would've gone with someone she trusted like Jasper. Holder wants to grab him but Sarah says they have nothing. Her 'phone rings -- it's news from the teacher.

Stan is working on the chocolate chip pancakes, when Mitch comes out and offers to help. He says he's got it and tells her to take a bath and relax before they eat. Stan keeps making the pancakes. The older boy Tommy sets a place for Rosie and then apologizes, saying he forgot. Stan says it's okay and tells him to leave it. Mitch runs her bath and looks in the mirror. Stan and the boys sit down to eat. Mitch gets in the bath and lets herself sink under, she comes up gasping for air and begins to cry.

At the police station the cops watch video from the confiscated phone. It is Jasper and Kris having rough sex with Rosie on the bed in ""the cage,"" it does not appear to be consensual. At the very least it is very rough and cruel. The Lieutenant tells them to pick the boys up. That's called RAPE.

At a photo op, Yitanes gives her endorsement to Richmond, just as Jamie's walking out in the background, his personal effects in a cardboard box.

Stan and the boys eat pancakes. Mitch cries in the bathroom.

He says he had nothing to do with Rosie's death and Linden puts on a video of Rosie talking about the future. ""Tell her you didn't kill her,"" Linden says.

Jasper is brought in with his attorney. The plan is for Linden to question Jasper and Holder to stick with Echols.

Jasper's lawyer tells Linden to direct questions to him. Jasper responds ""What video?"" when Linden says they have a video with him and Rose taken the night of her murder.

We see Stan and Mitch shopping for Rosie's coffin. Mitch takes a liking to one of the more expensive ones.

Richmond and Gwen meet with a pollster who tells them he's getting killed by Mayor Adams in the latest polls despite getting the Yitanes endorsement. He suggests a large ad buy. After he leaves Gwen thinks they should help their financially struggling campaign by visiting Tom Drexler, a man Richmond calls a ""rich lunatic."" Richmond doesn't want to go to him but Gwen reminds him how much Drexler hates Adams. Richmond asks only for her to get his donors list.

After the video plays Jasper says ""It's not what you think.""

Holder works on ""breaking"" Echols, who has good things to say about Rosie. Linden pops in to tell him something but Holder sends her away before putting on the video. Echols says ""That's what you got?""

We see Adams meet with Jamie in a bar. He asks Jamie to join his campaign and get with ""a winning team for once.""

Richmond is having no luck with donors. We see in another Gwen make a call to a ""Senator Eaton.""

Linden sits down with Sterling and asks why she didn't tell them it was her on the video in the cage with Jasper and Echols. The blood was from one of her nose bleeds and she put on Rosie's costume from that night because Jasper ""thought it would be funny."" Rosie had already left the dance when they went downstairs. Sterling didn't know where she went and says Rosie changed dramatically after breaking up with Jasper. She saw her get on the 108 bus a number of times and thinks Rosie met someone ""she couldn't tell anyone about.""

As Linden and Holder leave the school they wonder about places Rosie might have hid love letters. Linden is supposed to meet the Larsens later and Holder will check the bus route -- which doesn't go near the Larsens' home.

Gwen meets with Senator Eaton, her father. She has him work on a meeting with Drexler.

The Larsens tell Linden they don't recognize the key or expensive shoes Rose had with her and they don't think she would date an adult -- ""she's not like that."" When Linden leaves to take a call the Larsens accidentally see some of Rosie's crime scene photos.

Richmond brings Gwen to a function attended by both Drexler (who appears to own the city's basketball team) and Adams. The obnoxious Drexler throws a basketball to Richmond and suggests he play the mayor for the office. Richmond isn't happy.

The bus driver doesn't recognize the picture of Rosie but Linden convinces him to keep looking.

Linden goes to Regi's boat looking for Jack and is surprised by Rick. He apologizes for how he acted on the phone and they fool around.

Stan and Mitch meet with the priest who will be conducting Rosie's funeral service. After the priest assures Mitch that Rosie is with God, Mitch responds ""My daughter, she was out there alone. She was hurt and she was alone. Tell me: Where was God then?""

Out on the patio Drexler tells Richmond he likes him. He hands him a check for $50,000 despite the fact Richmond says he can't offer him anything. Drexler doesn't seem to mind as long as he can play a part in the defeat of Adams.

Stan takes his employee Belko to a home. Stan says he recently bought the house as a surprise for the family but realizes now he must sell it. Belko offers to help him ""take care of"" Richmond like they did back in the old days. Stan curtly says ""I don't do that anymore.""

In school we see that Sterling is having a rough time of it. She runs into Mitch in the hallway and the two embrace. Sterling says Rosie looked happy the night of the dance and thinks ""maybe"" Rosie could have been seeing someone secretly. Stan goes to see a man who appears to be a higher-up in some type of organized crime. Stan mentions his debts and asks for help. Despite reminding him that for 17 years Stan ignored him on the street, he peels off a bunch of cash. The man tells Stan ""family comes first,"" but Stan tells him they were never family before taking the money.

The bus changes drivers and the new guy tells Holder he does recognize Rosie, as few white people ever traveled to the end of his route, where she would get off.

Linden notices a pack of cigarettes Jack hid in his pillow case.

As Mitch sits across from Rosie's locker she is approached by her teacher Ahmed. He has overwhelmingly positive things to say about Rosie. Kids like her were ""why I got into teaching in the first place.""

Stan goes into Rosie's room and looks around. He smells some of Rosie's clothes but is disturbed by Linden who let herself in the home when she found the front door open. She needs to search Rosie's room. On his way out Stan tells Linden she never should have lied to them about Rosie not suffering. Linden goes right for Rosie's pillow but finds nothing.

In Ahmed's classroom he tells Mitch about a favorite author of Rosie's and gives her Rosie's favorite book.

Rick comes home to find Jack alone on the boat. The two appear to be bonding.

At the end of the line Holder follows a kid in a letterman's jacket down a flight of stairs.

In a remote parking lot Richmond meets with Jamie. Jamie is ""in"" with the Adams but we see he's clearly still with Richmond. Richmond is sure Adams planted the leak within his campaign, but the mayor hasn't admitted it to Jamie yet.

Holder walks into an after school program covered with signs for the Richmond campaign. A man recognizes Rosie's picture and says she would come in with a certain guy. He points Holder to a picture in a trophy case.

A dejected Linden absent-mindedly turns on a globe and sees that it is filled with letters. She starts reading what seem to be love letters.

Richmond is using Drexler's money for advertising.

We see Stan stash the new cash in a drawer at his office.

Holder looks at the picture of a youth basketball team. The coach has hair just like Rosie's teacher Ahmed.

He sent his wife out of town because a flooring company was supposed to come to the house and do work. Ahmed says the company cancelled on him. He had access to Richmond campaign cars but never used them. He gives them an envelope which contains evidence of her talent as a student.

Linden and Holder watch the video Ahmed gave them. It is something Rosie made. Linden wonders if during her filming she might have ""seen something she shouldn't have seen.""

Mitch tells Terry she'll go the store for some groceries.

A roof issue has come up with the home Stan purchased. Clients are cancelling on Stan because they've worried about the awkwardness of dealing with him. Belko says he has a friend who works at Rosie's school and offers to see if he can get some info about who the cops are looking into. Stan isn't interested.

Rick is heading back to California. He asks whether she'll take an interest in Rosie the same way he did the kid with drawings. He doesn't expect her to drop the case in time for a barbecue with his family.

Mitch runs into Richmond at the grocery store. He references his wife, but can't bring himself to ask her about appearing with him.

Richmond gets into a car in the parking lot and lies to Gwen, telling her Mitch wasn't there.

Jamie sits with the mayor and one of his top aides at a lodge significant to the mayor's family. The drinks are poured and the mayor tells Jamie he'd be the last person he'd tell if he had someone inside Richmond's campaign.

Linden orders non-refundable plane tickets to California for her and Jack.

Holder (who is counting cash he says he won at blackjack) tells Linden that Ahmed lied about the flooring company canceled on him. It was the other way around.

A drunk Jamie tells he left because he got tired of Richmond's ethics. Jamie goes to the bathroom to puke. The mayor joins him in there and references Yitanes having a background with planting people inside his campaign. The mayor doesn't seem to suspect Jamie.

Belko helps Tommy cover-up his bed-wetting and tells him he won't tell his parents.

Mitch and Stan drop off the dress Rosie will be buried in. The funeral director tells them they can see her in it if they wait.

Jaime tells Richmond the plant came from Yitanes. Richmond thinks her goal was to make sure her husband got the contact. Jaime points out that Gwen used to work for Yitanes. Richmond asks Jamie to cross-check his staff E-mails with Yitanes.

After seeing Rosie in her dress Mitch and Stan stop at a gas station. Stan says he needs to get oil, but goes to the bathroom and weeps. He returns to the car and tells Mitch they were out of oil.

Gwen meets with the hotshot director. He makes reference to their having a sexual history together and wonders if that's why he's there.

Holder suggests to Linden a scenario where Ahmed has Rosie over that night and something happened.

Principal Meyers tells Linden and Holder that Ahmed and Rosie's relationship was professional, but references his having an incident with a student at his last school. She also says that Ahmed's wife was one of his former students.

Linden and Holder visit Amber Ahmed at her home. She is very pregnant. Amber says that Ahmed wrote her notes when she was an 18-year old senior. Amber is due in a week and tells Holder the night of the dance Ahmed called her at 10pm on his cell phone. Linden excuses herself to use the bathroom and find chemicals in the nursery. One of them is ammonium hydroxide.

Holder wants to pick-up Ahmed. Linden says they need to link Rosie's apartment first. She asks the lab to check Rosie's file for ammonium hydroxide.

Jamie sends Richmond a file with Yitanes' plant. It turns out to be Nathan, the same staffer he earlier had looking into everybody's E-mails.

Later than day Yitanes comes to see Richmond. He confronts her about Nathan and says she will continue to endorse him or he'll turn her in for what is a felony. On her way out she tells Gwen that Richmond had Nathan look into her E-mails as well. Gwen is pissed.

Mitch returns home when Denny is in the bath. She walks into the show and yells at him to get out of the tub. Denny looks terrified.

Richmond arrives at his commercial shoot. Gwen has replaced the director.

Linden learns that Rosie had ammonium hydroxide on her hands, nails and even in her lungs. The stuff is used for flooring, but could also be used to cover-up sexual assault and other evidence. Whoever used the stuff is probably experienced.

He says she was there returning a book but when Linden asks to look for the book he says no unless they have a search warrant.

A conflicted Holder meets with what seems to be a former partner. The guy tells him Stan used to be a hit man for a mob and had a serious gambling problem.

Linden gets a call confirming the time Ahmed stayed at the dance that night.

Rosie's body is brought into the church and one of her brother's asks to help as a pall bearer. Linden is not allowed in.

Linden calls Holder and tells him video from the dance proves Ahmed couldn't have let Rosie in at 10pm. They think it must have been Amber. Richmond pulls up and asks Linden whether she thinks Ahmed is guilty. She doesn't answer him.

In bed Mitch asks Stan if the police think Ahmed did it. He ignores the question and confesses he feels as if he failed as a father by not keeping Rosie safe. Mitch comforts him as one of their sons climbs into bed with them after having a nightmare.

Following the debate fiasco Jamie tells Richmond he must distance himself from Ahmed. Richmond resists, saying he put pressure on the superintendent to have Ahmed removed from the All Stars program without being charged with anything. Jamie thinks that by protecting Ahmed Richmond may be costing himself the chance to win the election and help many more people. After Jamie leaves Gwen promises Richmond that she supports his decision. They begin to have sex and look over at the mayor's newest TV spot that rips Richmond for supporting Ahmed.

Mitch's parents come to visit. They are worried about the boys and are critical of Terry for not doing enough to help. Ahmed comes up and Mitch's mother says she isn't fond of the fact that so much ""mixing"" happens in public school.

Jamie and Gwen don't know where their candidate is. Jamie says Drexler is unhappy he's donated to a campaign that doesn't seem to be trying to win. Jaime and Gwen don't seem to be getting along. Gwen noticed an open envelope addressed to Richmond from a Washington women's prison.

Linden tells Regi that Rick isn't taking her calls. Regi's worried about Jack. She says she's done with being a cop and just wants to finish the case. Regi points out that she's acting the same way she did during another case during which time she nearly lost custody of Jack.

Linden drops Jack off at a paintball outing with some friends. She sits in the car and calls Holder. He tells her they were unable to get a warrant for the Ahmeds' apartment because of a witness issue. Oakes is mad that Ahmed was leaked as a suspect. Linden watches Jack have a tough time with the paintball experience and hops out to give him a quick tutorial about aiming.

Linden goes into the office. Oakes says the neighbor who said he witnessed the body being moved has a history of mental illness. Linden says Amber could not have carried a body and tells Oakes about Muhammad. She also tells him about Stan's past. Holder (who had no idea Linden missed her flight) walks in.

Richmond visits the home of his deceased wife's mother. They talk about the fact the drunk driver who killed her daughter is about to be up for parole. He's not sure if he'll attend the hearing. Richmond is struggling to forgive the woman and she wonders if, based on his campaign, perhaps he also unable to forgive himself.

Mitch's mother answer the phone when yet another member of the media calls about Ahmed. Mitch says the police have told them nothing about Ahmed. Her mother makes a crack about Stan.

Stan takes the boys out to fly a kite. They want to know how Rosie died. Stan tells them a bad man killed her. They ask if the bad man will kill them and he promises them he won't let anything happen.

Mitch asks Royce about his information regarding Ahmed. Royce says his friend told him Ahmed took Rosie to a special room at the school. He tells her about the offer he made to Stan regarding ""taking care of"" Ahmed.

In the car Holder ribs Linden about Rick and how he must feel about being stood up so many times. He thinks she doesn't really want to get on the plane.

Linden and Holder visit the Green Lake mosque. They remove their shoes and are greeted by an Imam named Gelabi. He says Ahmed is new to the mosque. Gelabi is irritated that a girls from his community went missing a week ago and there doesn't seem to be anything being done. He doesn't give them much help, saying there are about 40 men named Muhammad who worship at the mosque. On their way out Linden sees that someone has placed an address in her shoe.

Gwen and Jamie tells them the mayor has called an emergency meeting of the city council to freeze funds to Seattle All Stars. Jamie says the way to save the program is to ask for Ahmed's resignation. Instead Richmond addresses the council and tells them that the kids in the program do not deserve the punishment they are about to levy.

Mitch rebuffs Stan's attempt at intimacy. On her way out he door she turns and says ""I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can.""

Linden and Holder follow-up on the address they were given at the mosque. Linden leaves Rick yet another voicemail while looking for the entrance. She says she's sorry and wants to talk to him so she can schedule another flight. They spot the door in a dark alley. Linden references probable cause before Holder invents hearing something and kicks in the door. They are walking into the back entrance of what appears to be a old butcher shop of some sort. They come upon another locked door and Holder manages to break the padlock. They walk inside a pitch-black room and stare intently at something.

We see Mitch watching the Ahmeds from the street. The council approves revoking the All Stars' funding as the mayor watches with a smile.

As Linden and Holder explore the room we spot someone with an assault rifle. All of a sudden the room is flooded with FBI agents who force the cops to the ground."

While Holder yells at the agents for detaining homicide Linden looks around and notices the room has been setup for a girl to live there. She spots a pink sweater. One of the agents tells them they may have compromised a terrorism investigation.

In the street outside Oakes rips them a new one for breaking into the room without a warrant. Linden thinks the room may be where Rosie was held but Oakes says the feds have taken over and they'll get a briefing from a joint terrorism taskforce the following morning.

Linden goes to Regi's. She calls one of the techs and asks them to send to Rosie's computer, which she sees that Jack has been using. She calls Rick and one of his female co-workers answers. She tells him he's tied-up and can't come to the phone. Regi pops her head out and make a crack about Rick figuring out ""you don't really want to go."" Linden starts to look at Rosie's crime scene pictures on the laptop.

Stan is struggling to keep the business going while taking care of the boys. He asks Mitch where she was the night before. She lies and says she was at the market.

With the news about Ahmed and the mosque continuing to hurt his poll numbers, Richmond tells Gwen and Jamie he wants to fight the All Star's having its funding cut and hit Adams on some of his old weaknesses. Jamie likes that Richmond is going to play dirty, but since Ahmed is being liked to terrorism they need more. He's going to have a P.I. look into Adams, but Richmond warns him he doesn't want to go for personal stuff.

Linden finds the fed raiding her office and all of her files. Oakes shows her the front page of the paper. Someone has leaked Rosie's crime scene photos and he's furious. Linden clearly suspects Holder was behind the leak and he's not allowed into the briefing.

Principal Meyers calls Ahmed and tell him to stay home for a few days.

The fed tells Linden and Oakes they've been investigating a suspect named ""Mohammed H."" who has made border crossings and may be connected to radical elements within the mosque. They've connected Mohammed to that room they were in, as well as to maps of border areas and falsified passports with multiple young females. Usually the girls are not Caucasian. They won't tell Linden anything about Mohammed.

Mitch is going to take the boys to school. She starts the car with the garage still closed and runs back inside to grab something. While there she hears a news report that shows pictures of Rosie's body. She sits down, seeming to forget the boys are in a closed garage with a running car. Terry comes home and opens the garage. The boys are fine and totally oblivious.

Jamie goes to see Drexler about getting some more money for the campaign. When Drexler figures out they don't really have anything on Adams he says he's got some dirty on the mayor that even he had been too principled to share.

Linden brushes Holder off in the office, not revealing anything about the meeting with the feds. Outside she runs into Mitch who is upset about the photos being leaked. Mitch doesn't think the department is doing anything.

Richmond is initially shot down by a judge (a buddy of Adams) in his challenge of the council yanking the All Star's funding. Gwen points out that early on Richmond didn't want to go negative. Jamie walks in with a file on Adam he's gotten from Drexler. Gwen immediately says they can't use it, Richmond says he's going to think about it.

Linden goes to the feds' staging area pretending to be someone official needing to look at the evidence. The guy doesn't buy it, but when she walks away she goes into one of the files and takes a picture of the pink sweater.

Ahmed tells Amber about being given time off from work. When she asks why he hasn't given the cops any information about Mohammed he snaps at her.

Mitch confirms for Linden that the sweater was Rosie's. She getting angry that Ahmed is walking free.

Oakes tells Linden that the case has basically been shutdown. The federal case takes priority and Mitch's ID of the shirt doesn't matter. She's convinced Rosie has nothing to do with the terrorism case but Oakes points out there is no proof of that. He criticizes her treatment of Holder and she tells him she has reservations about his abilities. Oakes thinks maybe she should finally head to California.

In the car an angry Linden calls Rick. Once again she gets voicemail. She sees Holder walk out of the station with his old narcotics buddy and decides to follow.

Terry tells Stan about Mitch leaving the boys in the garage with a running car.

Linden follows Holder to an out of the way building. Inside she sees that it is a narcotics anonymous meeting of some kind and Holder is getting recognition for six months of sobriety. He tells a sad story of rock bottom as Linden listens. Her phone rings and Holder looks over as she ducks upstairs.

The phone call for Linden is from a parent of one of Jack's classmates. Apparently Jack emailed the Rosie crime scene photos to a bunch of his friends.

Richmond listens to the parole hearing for the woman who killed his wife while drunk driving. The woman talks about forgiveness as he silently watches. Afterwards Richmond walks into a bathroom at the courthouse. He punches a mirror violently.

Back at the office there is more bad news concerning Richmond losing potential voters. Jamie hopes they will use the dirt on Adams but Gwen doesn't think Richmond will go for. Jamie hints at leaking it himself and Gwen threatens to ruin his career if he does. To Gwen's surprise Richmond calls and instructs them to leak the Adam dirt.

Linden confronts Jack about what he did. Her son is obviously angry at their situation and asks to be sent to live with his father, who Linden says left they years ago. ""I'm all you've got,"" she tells him.

Mitch comes home to find Stan has taken down some of the things in Rosie's room. He says they need to look to the future and she points out its only been a week. He makes reference to what could have happened to the boys.

We see that the dirt on Adams was that he had paid for a woman's apartment. The speculation is that the former intern was his mistress. Richmond and his staff watch the woman accosted by press at her home.

Holder meet Linden at Regi's place. The seem to come to an understanding, with Linden saying she no longer has concern about him. He tells her he's put a tap on Ahmed's phone and says a judge friend of his will help make it stick legally if they find anything.

We see Mitch putting Rosie's things back where they were.

Richmond seems torn at the latest developments.

Amber overhears Ahmed speaking in a heated tone to someone. He tells the person ""passports will be arriving tomorrow"" and assures the person the police know nothing.

The episode ends with Holder getting a call that they've got something on the Ahmed wire."

They are talking about ""the room"" and that the fact the police know about ""the girl."" Muhammed is asking Ahmed for help. He says they just need to stay calm and mentions in English that the passports will be arriving soon and everything will be over. Holder thinks this is the smoking gun. All he has to do is get his buddy judge to give them after-the-fact approval.

Linden gets a call from Mitch. She wants to know whether Ahmed's been arrested yet. Linden tells her everything will be wrapped-up that night.

Stan comes home and finds Mitch waiting for him. She tells him that Ahmed is about to be arrested and the couple embraces.

Mayor Adams holds a press conference to address the story about the woman. Not only does he say he is physically unable to father a child -- having had a ""procedure"" years earlier -- but that he believes the story is a smear attempt by Richmond.

Damage control is in full effect at the Richmond campaign. Jamie is telling a reporter it wasn't them. Richmond is upset the story has now come down to his word against Adams'. Linden shows up asking for more records about Richmond's campaign vehicles.

We see a conversation between Adams and his aide that lets us know the woman is absolutely a former mistress. He's paying her to keep quiet and paying a doctor friend to falsify records saying he had a vasectomy. Adams is told the machinists' union is about to abandon Richmond.

Holder's judge buddy refuses to sign the warrant when he says one of the pages has been ""redacted."" He thinks shoddy police work is happening.

Holder calls Linden with the bad news about the warrant.

The next day Oakes rips Linden and Holder after being told Holder sought out an illegal tap. Linden takes the heat but it doesn't matter -- the investigation seems in deep trouble.

With Ahmed in the other room Amber looks at his cell phone and writes down Muhammed's phone number.

With the poll numbers not going in the right directions, the Somalis continuing to be vandalized and the machinists on their way out, the Richmond's camp is in trouble. But Richmond tells his aides ""the mud slinging is over.""

Terry finds some of Rosie's textbooks in her car. She brings them to Mitch, who plans to return them to school.

Amber calls the police station looking for Linden, but hangs up before Linden can get to the phone.

During a move Stan has a tender moment with a young girl. Belko notices.

At school Mitch is stunned to see Ahmed walking into the building.

Holder is convinced his career is in danger. Going through a book of Rosie's Linden finds a note that says ""Adela, Friday 11:45.""

Amber, having reconsidered, comes to the station and speaks with Linden and Holder. She gives them Muhammed's phone number and tells them that based on the conversation she overheard she thinks her husband is up to something.

The faculty are also shocked that Ahmed is at work. Principal Meyers reminds Ahmed she told him to stay away until the investigation was over. He says unless she is going to fire him he's going to do his job.

Ahmed's first class proceeds to walk out on him before he can start his lecture. The camera pans and we see that someone has written ""KILLER"" on the board behind him.

Richmond goes to see Gelabi at the mosque. He's upset at what is happening to his community and Richmond promises to help. Gelabi says he heard the same promises from Adams and he's worried the two men are similar.

Linden and Holder learn the GPS from Muhammed's cell phone hasn't moved from a downtown market. On their way out of the station they run into Mitch. She furious that Ahmed is at school ""like nothing ever happened. Free.""

After a brief foot chase in the market, Linden and Hold manage to catch and handcuff Muhammed.

Gwen finds Richmond drinking at a bar, listening to his late wife's favorite song. He tells the story of the night she died after leaving a party. Gwen thinks the race is only over if Richmond isn't willing to tell the public who he really is. She wants him to talk to the voters about his wife, but he doesn't seem ready.

Stan comes home to find Mitch sobbing in Rosie's room. She tells him that Ahmed wasn't arrested and yells at him for saying they should trust the police. She then says ""that man killed our child and you let him go."" Stan fills with wage and leaves the room.

Oakes isn't all that excited about Muhammed unless they can get a confession. Prior to the interview Holder tells Linden that Muhammed has no record whatsoever. There is no reason for him to talk.

Richmond goes to see Drexler (who is shooting hoops in his home) and asks for $5 million. Drexler calls Richmond a loser and Richmond responds that he's at least willing to pick a legitimate fight. Drexler then says that if Richmond can make one basket he'll give him the money, but that if he misses he has to drop out of the race. A confidence Richmond tells Drexler he wants to keep the ball after he makes the shot. As he puts the shot up, the scene ends.

After threatening the possibility his wife could be deported and his kids sent to foster care, Muhammed finally starts to talk. He said that ""she came to (Ahmed's) place"" that night and he let her in. Eventually we realize that Muhammed is talking about Aisha, the Muslim girl who recently went missing. Muhammed says Rosie came by to drop off books that night but left. The two men are trying to move this adolescent girl to Canada to get her away from parents who want to perform ritual female circumcision on her before marriage.

Muhammed takes Holder and Linden to where Aisha is being held. He knocks on the door as Linden's phone rings. She is told that Ahmed never came home that day.

We cut to a van pulling up in a remote location. Stan and Belko get out of the front and open the back of the truck. They yank out a terrified Ahmed, who is pleading with them that he didn't hurt Rosie. He tries to run but Belko catches him.

While looking through Rosie's stuff Mitch finds the pink shirt she thought had been found in the room at the butcher's shop. She immediately calls. He doesn't answer and leaves a voicemail for him to call her.

Aisha answers the door. She seems fine, meaning Muhammed's story checks out.

Stan begins to pummel Ahmed savagely.

Richmond sits at his desk with a basketball in front of him he made the all-or-nothing shot.

Mitch still can't get Stan on the phone.

The beating gets worse. Stan sits on top of Ahmed, punching until he's exhausted and Ahmed is no longer moving. Belko gives Ahmed unconscious body several kicks but Stan pulls him off. Stan stands over Ahmed, seemingly trying to decide what to do next as the episode ends."

Holder and Linden tell Oakes about Ahmed and Muhammed hiding the girl, who they think may now be in Canada. Basically Ahmed is no longer a suspect. Oakes responds that Ahmed is in the hospital and on life support, the result of a horrific beating.

There's a quick shot of Stan at home.

Linden is upset and tells Holder she never should have told the Larsens anything about Ahmed. Holder tries to reassure by saying that if Ahmed had been honest with them the situation would have been different. They get a call that Stan has turned himself in.

Stan is processed. His fingerprints are taken and he has his mug shot taken. He's placed in a cell.

Linden pays Richmond a visit at his home. She tells him Ahmed is no longer a suspect and he responds that ""I never believed he was capable of such a thing."" She then tells him Ahmed is fighting for his life in the hospital. She admits she made a mistake.

Regi tells Linden she came home to find Jack and some friends smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. Jack then called her a ""stupid lesbo"" when she asked them to get lost. Regi blames Linden for not being available for her son. Regi says ""I'm not the babysitter."" An angry Linden wakes up Jack and they check-in to a motel.

There's a quick image of Ahmed in the hospital.

Richmond holds a press conference. He makes a point to reference Ahmed's vindication, current situation and calls out the council for shutting down the after school program.

Gwen and Jamie are tickled at what this means for his image. Richmond tells them he wants to call for a 10% city council pay-cut as a type of ""austerity"" move.

The next morning Holder arrives to find Linden re-evaluating all of the evidence. The big question is where Rosie went after leaving Ahmed's place at 10pm that night. Holder brings up the mob angle and Stan's history of gambling issues. She leaves to talk to Stan, while Holder plans to find Royce.

Linden asks Stan about his association with Janek Kovarsky. Stan says ""that was a long time ago."" Apparently Stan was the one who called 911 for Ahmed to be picked up. She tells him that Ahmed is ""barely"" alive.

Royce initially tells Holder he doesn't know anything about Ahmed. He also says he never worked for Kovarsky. He says Stan helped him get straight and Stan would never do anything to jeopardize his relationship with his family. Holder references the Ahmed beating on his way out and Royce looks stunned.

Stan is arraigned. He's being charged with two counts of kidnapping and attempted murder. He tries to plead guilty. ""I did it,"" he says, but his lawyer changes that to not guilty and whispers that unless he wants to spend the rest of his life in prison ""we're going to need to do some work here."" The judge lets his attorney make the call. Linden's phone one again goes off in appropriately in the back of the court room - it's called vibrate mode, Sarah.

In the hall Linden is told a cabbie is saying he picked up Rosie at Ahmed's.

After consulting his log the cabbie tells Linden he dropped Rosie off at her home.

Mitch pops into the office to check on Royce. She advises him on how to handle an upcoming move.

The cabbie's security camera shows Linden and Holder that Rosie was dropped off at home at 10:37pm. On the video Holder notices that despite the Larsen's being out of town that weekend a front light was on as Rosie is dropped off. But just before she gets out of the cab the light is turned off. It seems somebody was laying in wait for Rosie.

The Larsen boys ask Terry why Stan is in jail instead of ""the bad guy."" She says that sometimes ""you do what you think is right but it ends up being wrong."" Linden and Holder arrive at the house. Terry tells them that other than her and the Larsens, Royce also has keys to the home. She's told Mitch in the past that she doesn't like how much Royce hangs around with the kids.

Royce tells Holder that the night of Rosie's murder he was with his mother, ""Bev."" He says he needs keys because he sometimes needs to do work in the garage when Stan's not around. He says he never goes into the home when the Larsens aren't there.

Holder notices Royce's hands are beat-up and tells Linden he thinks Royce is lying.

Royce's mother tells the detectives Royce was there with her that night. She shows them his room and Holder notices the ceiling is covered with pictures of the Larsen family.

Holder questions Royce at the station. He explains his hands as just part of the job. They tell him Ahmed is innocent and probably is going to die. He starts to change his story about his hands and Holder says all they care about is the truth. He admits to being with Stan and Linden changes the subject to Rosie.

A Richmond staffer finds video of Richmond with Rosie. Jamie and Gwen subtly ask her to leave the disk with them and suggest she doesn't mention it to anyone else. Jamie thinks they should bury the video and doesn't think Richmond needs to know anything.

Linden asks Royce about his mother and the promiscuous past she admitted to when the detectives were at the house. She starts to imply that Royce had a thing for Rosie and the night of her murder he saw an opportunity to have her for himself. Royce freaks out and calls Linden a ""dirty bitch."" Royce begins to cry uncontrollably. He says he enjoys sitting in the Larsens' house when nobody is there. That night Rosie came home when he was home alone. He says he hid when Rosie got there. He heard her on the phone with someone named ""Adela."" Rosie then left and he never saw her again. His biggest worry is the family will find out they were there.

Mitch comes home and answers the work phone. It is the bank telling her that their account is overdrawn and their savings account is empty. She thinks there should have been $16,000 in the account.

Linden tells Holder she believes Royce's story. There is nobody connected to Rosie with the name Adela. The next step is to go through the phonebook and interview the people with that first name. Linden wants to start right away but Holder hasn't slept in two days and leaves to get some rest.

At the motel Linden finds Rick sitting outside the door. She says what's happened is because of Rosie and not their relationship. He thinks there will always be some reason for her not to move them forward. He has three tickets for Oakland on a flight leaving in a few hours. He asks if she'll be on the flight and she stutters. Rick leaves.

Jack is awake inside the room. She tells him ""it's going to be okay."" He lies down in bed without saying a word.

Linden goes for a run the next morning. She stops by a large ferry with the name ""Adela"" (gasp!). She notices a sign listing its daily departure times.

Linden gets on the ship and we see that it provides rides to the Wapi Eagle Casino. The symbol for the casino is identical to the key chain found on Rosie the night she died."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861179/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,"When Linden gets a call from her son's school saying he hasn't been there for three days, she and Holder travel across the city to find him.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Nicole Kassell'],[''],[],['title directed by female'],[],"Linden is looking around inside the Wapi Eagle casino. Casino manager Nicole Jackson mentions minors aren't allowed in her business and security chief Roberta Drays is strangely adamant that Rosie wasn't there, to the point of mentioning the specific night before Linden does. Jackson tells Linden the casino's security tapes are deleted every 24 hours. When Linden suggests that she needs to talk to some of the guests, Jackson is no longer cooperative and tells her that short of a federal warrant she is not welcome on tribal property.

Outside Linden calls an assistant district attorney and is told it would take at least a week to get onto Native American property. The then requests a warrant for the ATMs that are placed around the casino, as they are owned by the bank, not the tribe.

Holder pulls up and she tells him of her plan to catch Rosie on one of the ATM cameras. Rosie took the last ferry of the day that night, so she couldn't have returned via boat until the next day. Linden mentions that Jackson heads the Kalimish tribe, which owns all of the property. She thinks the bank warrant could take 24 hours, perhaps less. Holder seems unhappy about having to wait.

Linden leaves with her phone, while Holder places a call from inside his phone. He's calling his sister and nephews. He references an upcoming parade where he's going to meet them and talks about a gift he has for the one nephew.

Linden returns to the car, having got word that Jack didn't show up for school that morning and has skipped the last three days.

Linden dials Jack's cell from the motel room hall and hears it ring inside their room. But inside she finds only his phone.

Holder ended up waiting for Linden outside the motel and offers to give her a ride to the marina. On the way she leaves a message for Regi. Jack's phone is password-protected. Linden tells Holder that Regi is a woman. He assumes Regi is Linden's mother and starts talking about his family. Linden leaves a message at the home of Jack's best friend.

Regi's boat is gone -- she's away for a week visiting friends. The mother of Jack's friend calls back and references a place called The Tunnel by the waterfront. The woman doesn't want her son hanging around with Jack, who she thinks is a bad influence. Holder says he knows The Tunnel, a middle school skip hangout.

In the car Holder talks about running away during his youth and compares it to how Linden is handling her relationship with Rick. They find a bunch of kids at The Tunnel, but Jack is not there. Linden references a balloon in the backseat of Holder's car and he says he has a date.

Linden and Holder are showing Jack's picture around in various parts of town. Jack is supposed to call by 3:15 pm, so during the wait Linden and Holder grab some food. Holder talks about getting addicted to meth while working undercover. A former lieutenant helped him to get clean.

Holder manages to guess Jack's password and unlock his cell phone. She finds texts from somebody who is meeting up with Jack near his school. The number is restricted. One of them was sent that morning.

The phone company won't unblock the number for Linden. She is now bumming smokes from Holder. They haven't been able to reach any of Jack's friends. Linden leaves the car and calls in a formal APB, giving Jack's description.

They return to the motel at 3:30 pm, the time Jack is supposed to return each day. Linden is devastated to find the room empty. She goes back to the car and says she wants to stay. Holder leaves the car and calls his sister, saying he won't be attending the event after all. He says he has a friend who is in need and assures her this isn't like the other times he hasn't shown up. Back inside the car Linden thanks Holder for ""being my ride.""

At 5:00 pm Jack still hasn't returned to the motel. They go to where Linden used to live and she discusses her background in foster care. Linden thinks this is the reason why she is having trouble being a mother. He tells her about Jack calling him for hot dog cooking advice and this leads to a fight. She gets out of the car and Holder has to beg her to get back in.

Later in the evening they pull up to a playground that holds a special place in Linden's heart. She tells Holder about spending time there with him, back when Jack used to be happy. On the radio they hear a report that a child fitting Jack's description almost exactly has been found dead. Linden demands they go to the scene.

Holder tries to stop Linden from running to the covered body. Before she gets there we hear the radio confirming that the dead child is not Jack. She breaks down.

They return to the motel and see Jack is there at the end of the hallway. Holder tells her to ""kick his ass."" Linden first gives him a hug.

Outside in the car Holder gets a call that the ATM footage is on its way to their office.

Inside the motel room Jack tells Linden: ""I was with dad.""

Holder views the tapes and spots a clear image of Rosie in front of an ATM inside the casino."

In the office Holder has uncovered numerous pictures of Rosie at the casino, including one from the night of her murder where she's wearing the pink sweater. She's been making somewhat large deposits into an account under some else's name that had swelled to $7,000.

We see Jackson giving a press conference the next morning where she states construction workers found a human skull.

Cut to Adams' top aid having trouble getting the governor on the phone. Adams tells him he's wasting his breath, pointing out the tribe finding a bone basically means the end of the project on which his entire campaign was based.

By contrast Richmond's campaign couldn't be going better. The governor is coming for lunch and he's about to meet with the Seattle Record. A decision is made to send Jamie to a last-minute party Drexler has put together for Richmond. Senator Eaton calls to congratulate Richmond.

While Mitch is searching the office she hears a voicemail from Yanek where he references seeing Stan. She asks Royce about it and ends up firing him when she doesn't like his answer.

Stan leaves Mitch a voicemail asking about the boys and mentions he has a meeting with a psychiatrist to determine if he's safe to release on bond.

Rosie's bank account was under Terry's name. She initially tells Linden and Holder she knows nothing about it, she eventually fesses up that she let Rosie borrow her ID so she could get into a few clubs. Terry says she has no idea what Rosie was up to.

Adams meets with Gwen to give him an envelope somebody ""slipped under my door."" It's some kind of dirt on Richmond that he wants her to have out of respect for her father.

Holder takes Linden to meet an old undercover partner of his who had worked as a prostitute in the casino. She says the picture of Rosie looks like girls from the Beau Soleil online ""social introduction service,"" primarily used by rich men. Last summer one of the girls got roughed-up.

Jamie shows up at Drexler's house. There are young girls in bikinis swimming in the pool. Drexler says they are Beau Soleil girls. He says he didn't give Richmond all that money just because he made a basket.

Mitch visits Stan at the jail. She confronts him about their savings being gone and the call from Yanek. She yells at him, thinking he's returned to his old ways. Eventually Stan cuts her off and points out that the only reason he's there is because she pushed him to take care of things.

Holder finds the description of the John who roughed up the Beau Soleil girl. It sounds just like Drexler, who has two priors for solicitation. Linden says they need more to bring him in.

Jack's father' is waiting for Linden in her office. He apologizes for being out of Jack's life for the past decade but says he has a new family and wants Jack to be a part of it. He is heading home in a few days and wants to see Jack one more time. Linden doesn't seem interested.

One of the department's IT guys is able to find that somebody accessed the Beau Soleil website a number of times. One of the photos has a man wearing Rosie's expensive shoes, but the jacket clearly belongs to Terry.

Terry tells Linden and Holder it was just ""a way to meet nice men"" and admits to giving the shoes to Rosie. She tells them she recalls reading on the site's message board a recent warning from someone named Celine to avoid a John named Orpheus because he had driven her to the water and asked her if she wondered what it was like to drown.

Richmond meets with the Seattle Record. They grill him with a number of contentious questions, but Richmond ends up giving them a quality answer about how important his deceased wife has been in his campaign.

Stan tells the psychiatrist about a dream where his family was sitting around the table but another guy was sitting at the head table. It didn't make him feel anything and he doesn't say who the new guy is.

Linden and Holder track the Beau Soleil site to the warehouse of an online sneaker company. They guy claims he was hosting the site for a friend and takes them to the server. He pulls up the warning about Orpheus, whom she calls a ""Sick John."" The girls real name was Aleena, but Orpheus disconnected his account the night Rosie died. They do have the email that was connected to the account.

Terry and Mitch end up getting into a heated argument about Rosie and how protective Mitch was with her.

Linden sends a blank email to the Orpheus account. The subject reads ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID."" She gets a call from Holder, who is waiting on a ""date"" with Aleena. Linden notices that Drexler is big donor of Richmond's.

Aleena shows up. Holder tells him he's a cop and pulls out pictures of Rosie. She says Orpheus seemed like a sweet guy at first. She's clearly scared to talk, and doesn't admit anything with Holder asks whether it was Drexler.

Stan makes bail. In the parking lot he sees Terry waiting for him.

Still waiting on a response from Orpheus, Linden calls the IT guy Ray and asks him to wait at her desk.

We see that Gwen has opened the envelope from Adams.

Aleena calls Holder from a pay phone and says ""you don't know what you're getting yourself into."" She tells him if he wants to know who Orpheus is to come to a specific intersection.

Linden pays a visit to Richmond. She starts to ask him about Drexler and he has to leave the room to take a call. Ray calls to say that while Orpheus hasn't responded, he's opened her email. She tells him to re-send the email, and at that exact moment she hears a computer notification sound from a nearby room. She tells him to send the message again, and again hears the noise. She walks into Richmond's office and sees a computer screen open to an email account with her ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID"" emails in the inbox.

Aleena has left the scene, but at the intersection she mentioned Holder fins a wall filled with campaign posters of Richmond.

Richmond walks into his office and asks Linden ""what are you doing?""

Gwen is looking through the photos which depict him with young women."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861181/?ref_=ttep_ep13,,"The police and media have their spotlight trained on Troels, who might still be holding something back. Meanwhile, there are strange goings-on at the Town Hall. Things come to a head between Pernille and Theis, while Sarah receives some troubling news.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Brad Anderson'],"['', '']",[],['electric company'],[],"Open with Linden confronting Richmond in his office about being Orpheus. Richmond tells about the story of Orpheus, a Greek poet who tried to retrieve his wife from the underworld. Holder calls Linden to say the prostitute fingered Richmond for being Orpheus. Linden says her partner is on the way and awkwardly leaves.

Outside Richmond's place Linden tells Holder about the email. She says they need more evidence before they can bring him and plan to take a closer look at the campaign car.

Linden thinks Richmond switched to the traceable campaign car that night because the tinted windows provide anonymity. Linden notices the gas tank is nearly full.

Terry drops off Stan at home. He's not excited about seeing Mitch. He thanks her for bailing him out and she leaves. Stan makes eye contact with Mitch in the window, then gets in a car and leaves without ever going inside.

Linden found out the tank was half-full when Richmond grabbed I that night. This means at some point Richmond purchased gas and could end up giving them evidence.

Stan sleeps in his car at the cemetery.

We see Mitch going through an old scrapbook. Her father comes in and tells her Rosie asked for it.

Holder is confused that the odometer tells them Richmond put 120 miles on the car that night. It means that he couldn't have taken the ferry to the casino and must have taken the long route to the casino, over the Desolation Bridge. The bridge has a tollbooth and they plan to request the camera records.

During a public appearance Richmond is asked about a recent report exposing past affairs. He dismisses the report as bogus. Gwen wakes up and he says that he was hurting after his wife died but that he stopped all that stuff once they got together: ""Look at me,"" he says. ""You know I'm telling you the truth.""

Oakes tells Linden to be careful with how she goes after Richmond. Jack is spending time with his father. Holder stops by and tells Linden about the affairs, pointing out they all resemble Rosie in appearance.

Linden and Holder meet with one of the women Richmond supposedly had an affair with, a former campaign advisor named Meg. She thinks Richmond is a good man with deep-seated sadness. She said she left him because it ""hurt too much to stay.""

Stan stops by to see Ahmed in the hospital. Ahmed is still unconscious. On his way out he runs into Amber at the soda machine. She doesn't realize who he is and begins sobbing. He assures that a baby is the best thing that happens to your life. She asks how many kids he has and he says ""three."" She says she bets he's a great dad and he walks away.

Mitch watches Terry and the boys flying kites from a distance. She walks away.

Linden and Holder are having no luck with gas stations along Richmond's probable route. They are also still waiting to hear back from the tollbooth about the security footage. Holder figures out based on the gas mileage math that just south of the bridge he would have been on fumes. There is a gas station close to Battery Park where he could have stopped.

Gwen comes to the office and finds Meg waiting for her. She's there to see Richmond. Meg tells Gwen about being questioned by Linden. Meg implies that her relationship with Richmond overlapped his relationship with Gwen.

A guy at the station tells Linden and Holder that the night of Rosie's death he remembers a dark car leaving quickly after paying. He thinks the reason what that there was a girl screaming. Linden goes behind the station and stares out at the woods. Holder comes out and says they are just three mile from Battery Park. They speculate Rosie must have run the three miles, which explains her cut foot. Linden thinks the chase could have taken all night: ""He hunted her.""

Jamie tells Gwen he didn't know anything about the affairs that have now made in the papers. Jamie calls Richmond ""complicated."" It doesn't sound like the recent revelation about Meg will keep her from working.

Terry tells Belko not to leave. She doesn't think Mitch meant what she said and that the family needs him.

Jamie and Richmond share a glass of scotch. Jamie thinks tonight's rally is ""just icing."" Jamie asks Richmond if he has any additional skeletons ""Relax, you've got nothing to worry about,"" Richmond says.

Linden tells Holder to bring out the K-9 units to search the wooded area where Rosie was likely hunted.

Stan goes to the house he had secretly purchased for the family. He stares at the swing set.

Later that night one of Rosie's shoes is found. Linden starts getting emotional as she realizes that if Rosie had run in a slightly different direction she would have lived.

Linden goes to see Richmond. She begins shouting allegations about how he killed Rosie and he starts yelling back. He tells her ""I did nothing"" and says ""look at me, you know I'm telling the truth."" We see that Gwen is in a nearby room and heard this conversation.

Linden runs into Gwen outside. She tells Linden that on the night in question Richmond told her he ""needed to get away"" for a night. Richmond didn't return until dawn and when he did he was soaking wet. She hands Linden a disc.

While Richmond conducts his rally, Linden tells Oakes what she knows so far. Oakes still isn't sure they have enough to arrest him. Holder walks in with the evidence they need: Security camera footage from 3am caught Richmond in the campaign car crossing the bridge.

Cut to the police showing up at the rally. Richmond beats a hasty retreat but is placed under arrest by Linden. Surrounded by flag-waving supporters Richmond is placed in cuffs.

Linden tells Holder she thinks he'll be able to handle the paperwork to finish up the case. They both smile and Holder tells her to ""get out of here.""

Mitch tells Stan she doesn't think she's good for the boys in her current state. She doesn't think they need her. ""But I do,"" Stan replies. He tells her their life has been better than he could have hoped for. Mitch says ""Every piece of this place hurts me."" She cries and he consoles her.

Belko watches the news report that Richmond has been arrested for Rosie's murder. He is cleaning his gun.

Linden walks out of the office as the camera focuses on a photo of Rosie.

Linden brings Jack to the airport. He wants to make sure they don't forget about his father but seems okay with them leaving town.

Terry asks Stan if he's heard the news. She asks where Mitch is. Stan says ""She left.""

Sitting on the airplane Linden gets a call from highway patrol. They tell her they will be unable to fill her request for camera footage from the tollbooth. When Linden tells the woman they already have the photos she tells her that the cameras on the bridge haven't worked for a month.

We see Holder getting into a car with an unknown driver. He says: ""Photo worked. He's going down.""

Linden is sitting on the plane, clearly disturbed by this latest development.

Richmond is escorted to a police vehicle. We see that Belko is watching from the crowd. Belko walks towards him with the gun drawn. He points the gun at Richmond from point blank range as the season comes to an end."
