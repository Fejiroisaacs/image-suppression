Home life isn't going any better for Kenny. His sister-in-law Cassie (Jennifer Irwin ) is tired of his foul language and verbal abuse (and her damned kids won't stay off his jet ski). Some bro-time spent with Clegg( Ben Best), the coked-out bartender at Sha-BOOM's, helps ease Kenny's sorrows. But when Dustin ( John Hawks) later finds his brother belting frustrated pitches at the side of the house, he tells Kenny it's time to leave the past behind him which the ballplayer hears as a mandate to focus fully on rebuilding his career. Inspired, Kenny sashays into school the next morning, hijacks the morning announcements and formally accepts a full-time position as the gym teacher... until the majors call him back up.

This episode was based on the first half of the first book in the series: 'A Bad Beginning' which is broken into parts 1 and 2. As the opening credits roll, the singer tells the premise of the series. When this episode opens Lemony Snicket (played deadpan by Patrick Warburton - Elaine's on-again-off-again date Puddy on the 'Seinfeld' TV show) goes into detail explaining those events. A fire orphaned the three Baudelaire children who are turned over to Count Olaf (Jim Carey in the movie and Neil Patrick Harris here). The reason why Count Olaf wants to be guardian of them is to get the fortune left to them by their deceased parents. This surreal series tells of the Baudelaire children foiling Count Olaf's evil intentions. When asked about his motives Count Olaf shrugs ""You haven't the faintest idea!"" in the same manner as Jeremy Irons when questioned in 'Reversal of Fortune': ""You have no idea!"" Throughout this episode Lemony Snicket appears giving a running narrative of the events. The episode ends with the children still in the clutches of Count Olaf who sees their fortune as his. After all, it is only half of the first book."

'A Bad Beginning' was written by David Handler under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket in 1999. Handler also wrote the teleplay for this series and served as Executive Producer along with Barry Sonnenfeld who directed the first two episodes. The opening of this episode is a flashback recapping the events of episode one. Count Olaf, acting 'in loco parentis' (Latin for 'in place of a parent') devises a method to get their inheritance. He stages a play with himself as groom and Violet Baudelaire as bride. The play was written by Al Funcoot (anagram of Count Olaf), is an actual marriage ceremony and will allow Count Olaf to get control of the fortune. The sinister plot is discovered and prevented with quick thinking on the part of Violet. Count Olaf escapes but vows to continue scheming in order to get the fortune left by the parents. The parents are revealed as still alive and realize that their children are in continuing peril. Again the action is narrated on-screen by Lemony Snicket (Patrick Warburton)."

We didn't use nuclear bombs because we thought they might be friendly, but they weren't. They used something that stopped all the machines. They wiped out the army. Moms and dads fought.

The aliens kill grown-ups and catch kids and put devices on them to control them. Matt, the young boy, thinks the aliens might have gotten his brother Ben. His dad is out fighting.

Tom Mason (Noah Wylie) runs in bombed out streets, going after a cart of food. Laser shots take out the cart and they're forced to leave it. He and his son Hal run between burning cars, trying to avoid the hail of gunfire. There are live aliens, called ""skitters"", and mechanical ones called ""mechs"". Other resistance fighters put down cover fire.

Tom and Hal hide under a car, they're helpless to aid a woman who gets shot and is wounded, then preyed upon by aliens.

Tom meets up with more fighters, who tell him the aliens are on the verge of taking a key part of the city. They watch as a cloud of something envelopes the city behind them.

Back at camp, they report their casualties and walk through throngs of hungry people warming themselves by burning oil drums. Tom checks on his son, Matt.

Anne (Moon Bloodgood) tells Tom about her talk with Matt and the pictures he drew. She's encouraged that he's drawing his whole family.

Tom is summoned by the commander, Porter, who tells him it's time to leave the city because they've picked it clean. Tom doesn't want to leave the kids that the aliens have taken hostage. The commander says they'll travel in packs of 300, with 100 fighters and 200 civilians each. He's already sent out 9 units. He tells Sam he'll have Jeffries as his second in command.

Weaver (Will Patton) will have the Second Massachusetts, replacing Jameson. He's giving him Tom as his second in command. Weaver wants to stay and fight, but Porter points out they don't know how to fight them, so they have to run and hide instead.

He tells them they're trying to figure out the ""harness situation"" -- the vertebrae braces the aliens put on children.

When Weaver leaves, Porter tells Tom to use his degree in military history to defend the civilians.

Around the campfire later, they tell stories of impressive alien kills. Hal looks at the alien ship parked on the horizon and muses about infiltrating it and blowing it up.

Tom suggests a few historical approaches, including tunneling under it with TNT, and earns the name ""Professor Kicka---.""

Hal asks his dad to ease up on the history lessons when his friends are around. Even post-alien invasion, he's embarrassed by dad.

Anne treats the wounded. She's a pediatrician. She asks Tom what the plan is. ""Retreat, regroup, return, revenge,"" he tells her.

Weaver barks orders at Tom like they're in the military.

Matt wonders if he'll still get a birthday party when they're on the move.

Everyone packs up to head out. Tom looks over stacks of books. He weighs Tale of Two Cities and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and takes the lighter one -- Dickens.

They head out.

They walk through a neighborhood and Anne remembers visiting one of the houses once with her husband. He was a painter.

They stop to pick over the food supplies. Weaver laments that they're moving slowly with all the civilians. Tom suggests he take a small group of fighters and go back for food since Weaver won't detour with the whole group. Weaver agrees. Tom rounds up six people, including Dai, who comes with a stick of C4.

Matt tells his dad about his birthday wish. He wants everything back the way it was.

Tom looks at maps, with Hal and Karen set to scout the food locations out.

Waiting for Hal to return, Tom finds a boy's body lying nearby. He had a harness on. Someone tried to take it off him and it killed him. He's about the same age as Tom's son Ben.

Hal surveys the food location and hears aliens coming. He ducks for cover by a stream. He sees a dozen children walk by like zombies. They have harnesses on. One is his brother.

Back with his dad, Hal wants to get his brother, despite the odds. Tom has to tell him they can't. Hal tries to leave, but Tom wrestles him to the ground and tells him they have get the food first and plan better.

Tom draws up a plan. He'll go in at dark with Dai and Hal and if the coast is clear the rest should follow. If they hear shots, he tells them, they should leave.

He tells them they don't have to kill them all, just enough to make trouble. ""We can make it too painful and too costly for them to stay,"" he says.

Tom tells them history is full of invading forces leaving because inferior forces made too much trouble. When his historical examples don't work, he cites Red Sox-Yankees in 2004. ""We can beat 'em,"" he says.

After night has fallen, the three sneak into the warehouse. They creep along the aisles. It seems empty. They signal for the Jeep. They start loading it up quietly. As they're packing, an alien hand appears. It leaps out at Hal as he's unloading food. Tom comes and shoots at it, but he's soon taking fire. He runs for cover and arms the C-4. One of the mechs stalks them.

Tom wheels a cart toward it with the C4 and blasts it to bits. Now he has to contend with the skitter. It has him down on the ground and cornered, but Dai saves him by shooting it. It dies slowly, making burbling noises.

Tom and the group meet the others at the designated bridge, bringing a Jeep full of food.

Tom brings some in to Weaver, who asks ""What took you so long?""

Tom tells Weaver about Ben. After they accomplish their next mission of taking the armory, Tom wants to go back to get Ben. Weaver says as his commanding officer, they're not allowed. But Tom asks what he would do if he had a chance to get his kids back.

Tom says it's possible to kill them, you just have to get close.

Matt enjoys a birthday cupcake from Anne. Hal brings him a present, saying it's from Tom. It's a fancy skateboard like he used to have, a Ripstik. He straps on a helmet and wheels around as everyone watches. He lets the other kids try it out until Weaver signals it's time to go.

At night, Tom and Dai scope out the armory. There are fresh alien tracks.

Hal throws a ball for a dog to chase. But the dog doesn't retreat when a mech comes at it. Jimmy, who is 13, runs after the dog and Tom narrowly saves him from alien fire.

Matt wakes up in a real bed in a kid's room. Tom comes to get him. They're moving out from the houses they've been staying in. Tom's planning to go look for Ben later.

He checks in with Weaver, who thinks they failed in their mission because they had to retreat. Weaver says that means Tom can't go look for Ben like they agreed.

Anne asks Weaver why the fighters are getting to sleep in houses while the civilians are in tents. He makes the case that it's because his fighters need rest and the civilians would be too hard to mobilize out of houses.

Weaver tells her the civilians are welcome to leave if they don't like his rules. She tells him they're not just ""eaters"" like some soldiers call them. They cook, clean and haul trash. Weaver says the civilians concerns don't matter until the fight is over.

Tom gets oatmeal and walks around the civilian camp with Anne. He thinks civilians are ""a liability and a hindrance."" But they're the best reason they have to fight.

Uncle Scott leads school for the kids, telling them about biology. Later, he talks with Tom about the fact the skitters have six legs and the mecs have two and wonders what this means about the aliens.

Hal talks to a dad who's looking for his son who was also taken. He wants to tag along when they look for the kids.

Lourdes follows Hal around, irritating Karen.

Karen and Hal go into one of the houses and wonder about the girl who's room they're in. Karen teases Hal about Lourdes, but he assures Karen she's the only one. They're about to kiss when Tom comes in to tell them they're going back to the armory tonight on Weaver's orders. Karen thinks it's a waste of time.

Tom rounds up the fighters to go out, but tells Jimmy to stay. They tell him it's because they need someone bigger in case they find weapons.

Weaver tells him reassuringly that he's a good soldier.

Back at the armory, Tom and his people go in. One of them gets hit by two arrows. They exchange fire with a person, who tells them to put down their guns and turn over their weapons. He shows Tom they have Karen and Hal.

Tom puts his guns down just in time for a mech to drop through the ceiling.

One of the scavengers is hit in the leg, so his people carry him and march Tom and his people with hoods on like prisoners.

They remove their hoods so they can see they're in a school auditorium. Tom says they're just a group of people trying to survive, not part of a resistance.

The leader, Pope, wants to talk the girl (Karen) and the boy (Hal), but no one else. He holds a sword on Tom, then pulls a gun. Hal speaks up to save his dad, saying they can get them more guns and are part of the Second Massachusetts resistance.

The marauders know all about them. They've been watching them for two days. Pope's brother was wounded and lies unconscious on the stage.

Pope guesses that Tom is Hal's dad. He says they're not going to kill anybody because they're way too valuable. He wants to make a deal for the .50 caliber gun back at camp. He calls for a girl named Maggie in his group to take Hal and the terms of their deal back to camp.

With everyone else taken away, Pope tells Tom the invasion is the best thing that ever happened to him. Tom eyes the gun strapped to Pope's brother's leg on the stage nearby. Pope says they've been having a blast.

Maggie marches a hooded Hal back toward camp. He makes a move on her, but she knocks him down and pulls a knife on him. She warns him if he pulls anything again, she'll shoot.

Pope continues talking at Tom, who seems to be trying to get free of his bindings. Pope tells Tom the way to kill the aliens, whom he calls ""Cooties"", is by taking out a few legs to slow them down, then going for the head.

He tells Tom the ships are drawn to heat, so they lit an engine block on fire to draw one. They fired at it with their bazooka, but the ship dodged it.

Tom asks for a beer and Pope goes to get it.

Maggie releases Hal outside their camp and tells him he has an hour to return.

In a house, Anne tries again to talk to Weaver about housing. Hal arrives.

Pope releases Tom and gives him a beer -- it's cold. They've been running a fridge on a generator.

Tom tells Pope about his son being harnessed. Pope says Maggie saw a group of harnessed kids down by the hospital. Tom makes his way over to Pope's brother, but Pope busts him by asking him. He pulls out a gun. He knows Tom's been eyeing the gun the whole time. Tom backs down.

Tom suggests Pope join the resistance, but Pope essentially thinks the resistance is futile.

Weaver calls for Mike and tells him what's going on. Mike asks how they make the trade, but Weaver says they can't or the marauders will just bleed them dry with demands. He orders Anne to get the civilians ready to move. He points out to Hal that they can't go fight them because they don't know where they are.

Weaver orders Mike to watch Hal. Once they're in another room, Mike gives Hal his gun and lets him go. Hal leaves the gun, knowing Maggie might be watching.

He runs into Anne, who says she can help. She goes with Hal to meet Maggie and tells her she's a doctor.

Maggie comes back. Pope doesn't feel like dealing and tells Anne to fix his brother Billy or he'll kill her. She stitches up his leg.

Pope takes his guys to go rob the Second Massachusetts. He leaves Maggie and two other people behind to watch Hal and Tom.

Pope summons Weaver with a flare gun. He wants the .50 caliber gun, the GTO and all their food. He says the aliens will see the flare soon and they'll all be dead.

Weaver orders them to leave the food and promises Pope he'll find him.

Back in the auditorium, Billy leers at Karen and demands she stand up and turn around for him. He promises Karen they're going to have a good time. His intentions are not honorable.

Maggie grits her teeth and asks Anne if Billy is going to live. When Anne says yes, Maggie shoots Billy and then Cue Ball, Pope's only men there. She tells them they each deserved to die.

Back at the field, Weaver is leading people away when he hears gunfire. Tom's people are firing on Pope. Anne tells Weaver to get everyone to follow them.

One of Pope's guys tries to shoot the .50 caliber, but Tom and his guys shred him. Tom reminds Pope the ships are going to target the flares and he's sitting in the middle of them. Tom tells him to join or die.

Instead, Pope hops in the GTO with the .50 caliber mounted on top and drives away, leaving his men to get incinerated by the alien ships. He doesn't get far before Weaver stops him and disarms him.

They make camp at a school.

Tom checks in with Weaver, who is not happy with how things went down. He reminds Tom about the chain of the command and reminds him to follow it when he gets back. Weaver is sticking to his word that they can go for Ben. He gives them three days.

Tom takes Pope to his cell. Maggie has chosen to stay and earn her citizenship as a fighter.

""I'll take a rest for a while,"" Pope says. ""Being the leader of a post-apocalyptic gang of outlaws has been exhausting.""

Tom and Hal prepare to go look for Ben with Dai and Karen. Maggie shows them the way."

There are a dozen of them and they're scavenging scrap metal. Mechs and skitters stand guard out front.

Tom and his group conduct surveillance from a rooftop across the street. There are 6 aliens and five of them. They're talking about coming back later when Karen knocks a brick off the roof and the aliens hear and open fire. They have to retreat.

Back at the high school HQ, Tom is immediately swarmed by parents of missing children asking if he saw them. Anne suggests the parents post their pictures on a bulletin board.

Porter is back and delivers a briefing in the command post. He reports a scout ran into resistance fighters outside of Chicago who know about groups in Texas, Oklahoma and California.

The bad news is alien structures are going up over other cities, like Boston. Porter orders them to collect intel and war material. Weaver tells them he'll be breaking them down into teams of four and six fighters.

Tom tells Porter what he knows about the harnessed kids. He tells them the science team removed harnesses from three kids, but they died hours later. He says now the chief surgeon thinks he has a solution, but he needs to test it. Tom knows he means Ben.

Weaver doesn't want to bother with rescuing a dozen kids, but Tom tells him it's important to keep hope alive by bringing parents their kids back. He tells Tom to just bring Ben back for now.

The civilians have set up school in the gym. Tom finds Matt sitting by himself. He's worried about his brother. He heard the kids die when the harnesses are removed. His dad tells him a doctor figured out how to take them off safely.

Uncle Scott brings Pope food in his cell. He objects to the preparation and rants about the technique. Turns out Pope was a chef.

Uncle Scott suggests to Weaver that they let him cook. Weaver checks with Maggie, who vouches that Pope can cook. He learned in prison.

When Pope comes in, he complains about their cooking equipment but says he'll take the job.

Tom checks with Anne about the doctor. She describes him as very smart and competent and sure he's the best for the job. His name's Michael Harris (Steven Weber). Tom knows him.

Later, Michael tells Tom about getting separated from Rebecca, Tom's wife. He tells Tom he's sorry.

The next day, Tom and usual group watch the harnessed kids, looking for Ben. Mike sees his son Ricky and immediately jumps up yelling and runs for him. Tom tries to cover him and throws a bomb at a mech. Mike gets his son in the truck. Tom wants to go back for Ben but a mech shoots at him and knocks him out. Dai grabs Tom and throws him in the truck.

Karen and Hal run but soon find a mech in their path.

Cut to Tom waking up with Dai, Mike and Ricky. He doesn't want to go re-arm and wants to get Karen and Hal.

He takes Dai's shotgun and walks down a dark hallway. He hears a noise and is soon face to face with a skitter.

He runs but it races after him on the ceiling and knocks him down. It gets on top of him, but Tom scoots for his sawed off and blows off one of its legs. That slows it down so he can shoot it in the head. He beats it with his gun until it stops moving.

Back at camp, Anthony reports to Weaver that they didn't get Ben.

Weaver hears a hubhub and goes to investigate in the hallway. He finds Tom dragging the still kicking alien down the hallway. ""I brought you a prisoner of war,"" he tells Weaver.

Weaver is impressed.

Tom gets a fresh gun and heads out.

Hal wakes up in the rubble to see his zombified brother dragging Karen away. A mech shines a light on him and five hardnessed kids line up to face him. A skitter inspects him then the mech opens fire on the harnessed kids.

Dr. Harris prepares to do surgery on Ricky, who also has cystic fibrosis.

Weaver stops in and Dr. Harris essentially tells him to get out of his way. He says they have to cut the harness out instead of removing it entirely.

He lights a small torch and starts cutting the harness needles. He thinks the harness supplies the kids with a drug and they were dying when they were suddenly cut off. So he's pumped Ricky full of morphine in preparation for slowly lowering the dosage. They have to leave the probes in the kid.

Harris explains that the harnesses are partially organic, so over time they fuse into the kid.

Tom runs down a dark street and sees Hal stumbling toward him. Hal tells him the skitters took Karen. He doesn't understand why his dad left, but Tom says he was knocked out.

Hal tells him the mech killed the kids and let him go. Tom recognizes it as an old Nazi trick, leaving one alive as the messenger.

So if they go back, they have to get all the kids.

At the high school, Porter is excited to have a live skitter to study. He's going to have Dr. Harris stick around for three weeks.

Pope feeds people and Weaver says he'll give him a week tryout, but he still has to get locked up when he's not working.

Tom visits Ricky, who is still knocked out after the harness removal. Anne says he's stable and it seems like the procedure worked.

Tom finds Dr. Harris drinking Scotch outside the skitter's cell.

Harris says there are people who think that those surviving the first wave of the invasion are the best of mankind, but he doesn't think there's anything noble about running away.

Tom asks if that's how Harris survived. He blames him for abandoning Rebecca. Harris says he wasn't with her when the second wave attack started, but Tom says he found her with a bag that was too heavy for her to carry alone.

Harris says it was a split second decision and ""I thought the community needed my medical skills...""

Tom decks him.

Harris then says it's actually Tom who's responsible for her death because that morning Tom was supposed to go with her looking for provisions. Harris says that because he's now alive, Ben has a chance to live.

Tom says the people who survived owe it to those that didn't to become the best of mankind.

He visits the wall of missing children and puts up Ben's picture. He finds Hal wrapped around Matt, sound asleep.

In its cell, the skitter wakes up. Ricky opens his eyes."

They wonder what it's thinking and study it. It gets agitated and they zap it. Tom promises it he'll remember it, too.

Mike waits for his son Ricky to wake up after having his harness removed. Dr. Harris gives Ricky more morphine to wean him off the alien drugs.

Weaver calls Tom to a meeting. Pope has told him about a place with motorcycles, he wants to send Tom after them. Tom wants to go get Ben first, but Weaver explains that they need the bikes to get more drugs so that when they get Ben they can wean him, too.

Tom reluctantly agrees. Pope wants to go along because he's been there and can't give directions. Tom says yes, as long as he is unarmed.

Anne checks on Ricky. It appears his cystic fibrosis has gone into complete remission as a result of the harness.

Tom asks her about Rick's recovery. Anne says as long as they have enough drugs to wean him, he should be OK. She asks why he's having issues with Harris and he tells her that Harris saw his wife Rebecca die.

Maggie comes back late from recon on foot. She reports seeing harnessed kids being led into a hospital. One of the fighters thought they saw Tom's kid. There's no sign of Hal's girlfriend Karen.

Maggie asks Weaver why she had his guys keeping tabs on her. He says she's under suspicion because she was with Pope. She protests that it was not her choice, but he says she had a gun that whole time and could have used it.

As they're leaving, Matt runs out and asks his dad if he can go along. He wants to learn how to shoot guns. Pope hears Tom tell him no and then says Tom isn't doing Matt any favors. Tom thinks Matt deserves a childhood.

Out on their expedition to get the bikes, Tom leads a group of four including Dai, Hal and Pope. Pope enjoys the fresh hair and needles Anthony, a former police officer.

Tom tries to check on Hal, but he doesn't want to talk. Tom wishes Rebecca was there to talk to him.

Jimmy finds Lourdes looking at the wall of children. She was premed before the attack. She's praying for the missing.

Dr. Harris mocks Anne for showing the captured skitter pictures of earth and the galaxy. She thinks it's terrified.

Uncle Scott shows Weaver a radio he got up and running. He wants Matt to wind the radio and monitor it, since he's looking for something to do. ""Guess what? He just made you the communications officer,"" Scott tells Matt.

As they're walking through a field, Pope notices skitters -- they're asleep, hanging upside down from a freeway overpass like bats.

Dai reports mechs nearby in sleep mode. Pope wants to hose them, but Tom worries the mechs will come. Pope is upset at having to leave them alive.

Anne offers the skitter water. She's gently puts it through a small gate in its cage, but is interrupted by Dr. Harris. He wants to provoke a response from it so he's brought a dead one in. He uncovers it and the caged skitter goes nuts.

Listening to the radio in another room, Matt hears a sudden burst of static.

Harris and Anne struggle to shut the cage on the skitter. The radio static stops when it calms down.

Maggie finds Weaver and warns him that letting Pope go with Tom was a mistake.

Meanwhile, Tom and his group reach the bike store. Dai and Pope head to the repair bay for gas.

Tom finds Hal looking at a pink motorcycle keychain. He thinks Karen would have loved it. Hal is upset Karen was along on the mission. Tom tries to give the advice he thinks his wife would have, and Hal gently mocks him for his ineptitude.

Back with the alien, Dr. Harris is ready to cut into it. Anne tries to talk him out of it, saying they need to study it and attempt to communicate with it. Harris brushes her off, saying it's his call. The skitter appears to pay attention.

Mike sits by Ricky as he starts to wait up.

""Who are you?"" Ricky asks. He doesn't recognize his dad. They're in the same room with the skitter. Ricky looks at it then puts his head down.

Mike goes over to the caged skitter. He tells it Ricky his son and is healthy, probably because of the skitter. ""That's why you get this chance to live -- or not,"" he says.

Anne visits Uncle Scott, bothered about something.

Mike asks the skitter to talk to him, to explain itself. He shows it a picture of earth and a piece of paper and asks it to point to a picture and make a sound. He asks why they attacked. When the skitter does nothing, Mike picks up his gun.

He aims it at the skitter.

Back with the radio, Matt gets static again. Scott tells Anne they heard it a minute ago, too. They don't know what's causing it.

Mike keeps aiming his gun at the skitter and demands it make a sound. He jams the gun into its mouth and commands it to speak. The radio makes more noise in the other room. Mike jabs again and the skitter collapses.

After examining it, Harris explains that there seems to be a pressure point in the skitter's mouth and Mike probably gave it a concussion and knocked it out. Anne has Scott bring the radio. She connects the dots about the timing of the radio noise.

Harris is skeptical and mocks her idea as he prepares to examine a dead skitter's brain for signs of radio.

Back in the shop, Pope knocks Dai unconscious and takes off. They're happy to see him go and don't follow.

Pope goes back to the sleeping skitters. He throws a grenade hooked to a gas can at the hanging bunch and they explode in a ball of fire.

Back at the bike shop they hear the noise and see a giant cloud of smoke. They know it'll attract attention.

In the school, the caged skitter makes soft noises and Rick wakes up again. The removed harness is laying near him. He picks it up and places it on his back. It reattaches quickly. He walks over to the skitter.

Mike checks on Anne and Harris. They got nothing from the dead one, its brain was too mushy. They hear the radio static again. Harris says that's proof Anne is wrong since the skitter is alone, but Mike realizes Ricky is with it.

They run back to the room and find Ricky at the skitters cage. Harris talks to Ricky, who answers for the skitter. He wants to go and says this child is one of ""ours"" and he'll be punished for losing him. He says they can help him by killing him.

Mike runs to his son and takes the harness off him. Ricky collapses. He doesn't understand how Ricky could do that to himself.

Hal runs back from checking on Pope's destruction. He saw harnessed kids nearby. The kids walk into the clearing in front of the shop holding automatic weapons. The kids open fire, but Tom won't shoot back. Dai is hit in the leg.

Tom thinks if they find the skitter controlling them they can kill it. He realizes the kids only shoot when there's a target.

They throw out a gas can as a decoy and Hal and Anthony make it out on bikes. Tom puts Dai on his bike in the shop and they prepare to make a run for it, when they see a skitter in the shop. They fire on it and speed off. Tom has to leave the kids, but says they'll get them next time.

Back at the school, Tom and Weaver discuss the tactic of using the harnessed kids as soldiers. Tom thinks it shows the skitters think like humans, which means they might be able to find a way to beat them.

""You know, your optimism is starting to get a little annoying,"" Weaver says. Tom tells Weaver that tomorrow he's going for more drugs and then the harnessed kids. Weaver agrees.

Tom finds Hal with the last ""Harry Potter"" book, which Tom was reading to Ben before he was captured. Hal thinks Ben will be different when they find him. He says when Ben took Karen, he was staring at him and he didn't seem like Ben. Tom thinks he'll be fine.

Anne catches Tom up on the radio signals. She says they're not strong, or the skitter could have summoned help. She tells him about Matt's job. Anne has patched up Dai, and goes to get him a crutch.

The dinner bell rings.

Maggie has heard about Tom's planned drug run and suggests she has an idea. In the cafeteria, Tom finds that Pope's farewell gift to everyone was fresh baked bread.

Lourdes prays over her dinner, giving thanks. Weaver thinks it's a little silly, but Hal says he's thankful for the motorcycles and Anne is thankful for friends. Tom literally breaks bread with Weaver.

Anne suggests Lourdes say another prayer after she has everyone's attention. They all hold hands and pray."

The next day Tom relays news from a recon team that the second group of harnessed kids didn't come back last night. He shows Weaver his plan. Hal suggests just one person go in at night while the other skitters are sleeping. Weaver likes the plan more than confronting them.

Anne brings the captive skitter water. Dr. Harris (Steven Weber) mocks her for taking care of it.

In the chow line, a pregnant citizen named Sarah tells Maggie she's uneasy having a captive skitter nearby.

Uncle Scott shows Tom the radios that they picked up the skitter frequency on. Scott says they only work when the skitters are transmitting, so he can't use it as an early warning system.

Weaver listens to Scott transmit an old Jimmy Cliff song. It gets to him and Weaver goes and grabs the record.

Tom and Hal work on skitter target practice with crossbows. Maggie offers a few pointers. She's also familiar with the hospital where Ben is being kept and suggests a new access door.

Scott pulls Anne aside to talk about something.

The skitter makes weird noises in captivity. Harris notices a new one and goes over to investigate. He sees that it's blinking rapidly and opens the access door. He shines a light in its eyes.

Scott reminds Anne of a camping trip to the lake they went on years ago. He wants to put up something of Sam. They're interrupted by ferocious skitter noise.

They race to the room to find skitter throttling Harris through the cage. Anne shocks it and it releases Harris. But it's too late. Harris is dead.

Weaver tells someone to send word to Porter. He wants to kill the skitter, but Anne tells him she was making progress. He gives her 24 hours and says he's going to kill it.

Hal finds Rick sitting alone in the courtyard. He asks him about being with the skitters. Rick says they always stuck together, but says they were allowed to go to the bathroom alone if they had to. Rick says if they try to get Ben the skitters will kill them all.

Lourdes invites Maggie to Sara's baby shower. Maggie wants nothing to do with it and scoffs at the idea.

Tom contemplates the missing children bulletin board. He tells Anne he's confident she can remove Ben's harness herself. Tom asks if her son is on the board. Tom knows that her son is dead, but suggest she put a photo up anyway.

Tom finds Hal briefing Weaver on a new plan. He wants to strap Rick's harness to his back and walk right in. Tom thinks it's crazy. ""I don't know what's crazy any more, we're fighting aliens from outer space,"" Weaver says.

Tom tries to convince Hal not to go. Hal isn't sure it'll work, but says it's the best plan. Weaver pops pills as they debate. Weaver leaves it up to Tom. He says that until they figure out how to kill them without making any noise it's moot.

Tom brings the problem to Anne, who tells them about the spot in the soft palette. She tells them she doesn't want Hal going on a theory. So she picks up a scalpel, opens the skitter crate door and jabs the scalpel down it's throat until it stops moving. Dead.

She removes her bloody arm and walks to the bulletin board of children. She tells Tom that he shouldn't think it was hard for her to kill it because all she had to do was think about her family.

But she tells Tom the truth is she has no photos or mementos of them. She says ""all I have is this"" and slams her bloody hand on the wall, leaving her mark.

Later that night, Tom, Maggie and Hal sneak up to the hospital. Hal has the harness strapped to his back. Tom asks him what the distress signal is. ""I yell 'Help!' as loud as I can,"" Hal jokes.

Tom tells his son he has total confidence in him and reminds him he has 15 minutes. Hal runs off and the others hide as a mech walks by.

Hal creeps down an empty hallway, making the turns he memorized. He hides as a skitter leads a line of harnessed children, including Ben, down a hallway and falls in line behind them, walking trancelike. He follows them into a room.

They all like down in unison. The skitter crouches over them and pets them. He's stroking Hal's head as Hal lies there.

Outside, Tom gets impatient after 20 minutes have gone by. He wants to go check on him. They creep closer as a mech patrols outside. Maggie suggest another way in.

Inside, the skitter has gone to sleep literally standing over his harnessed kids.

Hal slowly takes out a knife.

In the hallway, Maggie and Tom creep silently.

Hal is raising his knife when Ben sees him. The skitter wakes up. Hal jabs his knife in but the skitter doesn't go quietly. Tom appears in the doorway and helps shoot it with a crossbow.

Tom announces they're taking all the kids. He gives Anthony and Dai the signal and they lift the kids out the window.

Back at the high school HQ, Anne prepares to do all the surgeries in a row. Lourdes serves as nurse since she was in med-school.

Tom helps remove the harness. They notice Ben's pulse is dropping but it picks back up when they get the harness off.

Scott reports another of the kid's pulses is getting weaker and weaker, going into withdrawal. They race to get the harness removed and the kid hooked up to IV drugs. They get it removed but the kid fades quickly. They can't revive him.

Anne doesn't know what went wrong. They saved five kids, but she's upset they lost one.

Hal examines his chewed up arm in the hallway. Maggie walks by and he thanks her. He remarks that she knew the hospital really well and knew all the drug dealers. She confesses that she had cancer when she was 16 and a doctor told her to smoke pot. She says the doctors gave her a 50/50 chance.

Tom tells Hal that Ben is still unconscious. He tells Hal he was incredibly brave and he's proud of him.

Later, at Sarah's baby shower, they've set up candles and a hung a sign. Anne hangs back for a while and joins in. The women all their wishes for the baby.

Anne listens with her stethoscope and lets Sarah listen.

Tom, Matt and Hal stand watch over Ben, reunited.

Weaver sees the happy family and then goes and puts on the Jimmy Cliff song. ""Many rivers to cross, but I can't seem to find my way over....""

His mom and dad hover. When Anne turns her back on the dad, he pulls a gun on her. He demands their antibiotics and pain killers. He's freaked out about the unharnessed kids walking around the school and the fact a skitter was in the building and killed someone. They want the medicine to trade after they leave. Anne resists and he whacks her. He and his wife and kid run off.

Tom, Weaver and Mike go after them. Weaver says it's Tom's fault because citizens are his responsibility. The family hunkers down in a driveway and the dad trades shots with Weaver. Suddenly a man in fatigues is behind the family and has them cornered. He identifies himself to Weaver that he's Terry Clayton of the 7th Mass.

The wife hands over the meds and the family runs off.

Terry tells the men that the 7th Mass got wiped out by skitters and they're coming in this direction. His remaining people are holed up in a farm nearby in a valley. Porter, the commander, thinks the aliens are looking for slave labor for their structures. They're seeing one mech and one skitter patrols.

Porter has ordered the 2nd Mass to stay put about 72 hours until the 3rd Mass shows up. But they're supposed to send anyone under 20 ahead with Terry. Tom's not a fan of the idea and Weaver understands, but says they might have to push for it if an attack is imminent. Weaver orders Tom to broach the idea with the citizens.

Dai heads off on motorcycle recon. Tom tells everyone to prepare to be able to leave quickly. People have heard about the potential order to send the kids ahead. Anthony suggests they might be safer if the kids weren't around, since they know the aliens are interested in them.

Sporting a busted lip, Anne gives Maggie prenatal vitamins to give to Sarah. She didn't want Sarah to see Anne banged up. Maggie commends her for fighting back and gives her a gun for protection.

Ben does push-ups. His spikes are still protruding from his back. His little brother Matt asks to touch one. He asks what it was like with the skitters. Ben to tries to explain how their telepathy works. He says it wasn't so bad after he was harnessed. He says the skitters cared about them in some way, like family. He says he missed it sometimes. Hal hears the conversation and is disturbed.

Anne treats a kid, but yells at her dad when he goes near the door. She's on edge. Hal stops by. He's worried about Ben. He tells her Ben just did 100 push-ups with little effort. He doesn't seem like himself.

Anne finds Tom setting up barricades around the school, including an over-turned car. They're just designed to slow the skitters down to buy the people time to escape through the tunnels. Tom can't decide how he feels about the possible order to send the kids first.

Jimmy stops by Weaver, looking for a job. He tells him he can help on watch, even though he's junior high-aged.

Anne thinks about the gun again. Cut to Maggie giving her shooting lessons.

Tom finds civilians confronting Terry about the order to send the kids ahead. They're in the gym surrounded by people. One man goes for his gun saying he'll react if anyone tries to take his little girl. Tom tells him to remember who the enemy is. Tom says he'll be the one to decide what they do if the skitters attack.

Jimmy heads out to join Parker on watch in an old school bus. Jimmy joins the existing chess game. They're looking at the board when they hear a noise and a light shines on them. It opens fire on them directly before they have time to react.

Everyone hears the shots and Tom tells them to get ready to move.

In the school bus, Parker is dead but Jimmy is unharmed. He ducks and covers as the mech claws at the school bus. He makes a run for it when his people start firing on it. Weaver realizes where it's coming from and that Jimmy's out there. Jimmy comes back in the school to find it's already been cleared out. We see the shadow of a skitter on the wall behind him.

He goes through a chain linked door, squeezing between the doors, but when he's on the other side, the skitter reaches through and grabs him around the neck.

Tom and Weaver are out to the school bus and Jimmy is left to defend himself inside. He draws his gun and shoots at it, but is soon out of bullets. The skitter is bearing down on him in the hallway and he's unarmed when a blast rings out. It's Weaver. He smoked the skitter. Weaver finds Jimmy near tears. He hugs him and tells him everything will be OK.

Later, with Anne and Weaver, Jimmy excitedly tells his story. He thinks he's in shock. ""If you were a little older, we'd give you some whiskey,"" Weaver says.

Terry tells Weaver and Tom the 7th Mass was originally tracked by one skitter and one mech. The others come when they realize their recon isn't coming back. Weaver says it's time for them to seriously consider sending the kids away.

In the chow line, one of the citizens gives Ben a hard time, calling him a ""razor back"" and refusing to get in line with him. The man announces that kids like Ben are the reason the skitters are attacking them. Hal and Maggie intervene.

Ben goes to talk to his dad. He tells Tom he wants to go on ahead, so that Tom is free to fight when the skitters come. Tom asks his son if he's happy he's back. Ben says of course.

In the gym, Tom addresses the citizens. He tells them he's sending Matt and Ben ahead with Lt. Clayton. He says if everyone goes as planned, they reunite next night.

Tom assigns a security detachment, including Mike. Tom wants all the kids to go because they're the future and they have to come first. He gives them an hour to pack.

Hal finds Ben looking at a picture of their family from Six Flags. He wants Hal to hold onto it until he comes back for them.

Hal finds his dad and tells him he wants to go with Matt and Ben. He tells Tom about the morning his mom went to get food with Dr. Harris, that he and Ben got in a fight. He remembers his mom telling them they had to start looking out for each other. He feels like he needs to go with them.

The kids all say good bye to their parents. Jimmy thanks Weaver.

Terry gives tom directions on where to find the 7th Mass and the kids. Hal tells Ben he's going with them. Tom says good bye to his kids. Anne takes his hand.

Terry leads the kids through a forest. Hal checks the map and questions a turn Terry makes. He says it's a shortcut. They reach the ranch near nightfall. Terry suggests everyone go to sleep and they'll do a tour in the morning.

Late at night, Terry comes to get Eli, the kid who ran away in the beginning. He says he's taking him to his family. Terry takes Eli outside where a young girl meets them. She tries to take Eli but he sees that she's harnessed and protests. A skitter comes out from the woods and zaps Eli with something that knocks him out. Terry remains calm and has a conversation with the skitter through the girl. She complains that he's late, but checks that he'll bring more in two days. ""That's the deal,"" he says and walks away calmly as the skitter carries off Eli.

Terry heads back to the ranch lodge. He unlocks a padlocked door and goes down to visit someone handcuffed and chained to a table. He tells whoever it is that he was right, there were a lot of kids in that school. ""I knew it was a good idea to keep you alive, Pope,"" Terry says."

Jimmy sees Ben is wide open but won't pass to him. A girl named Tessa chats up Hal and Lourdes intervenes.

Lt. Clayton leaves to lead the adult military escort back to the rendezvous point. Hal assures Ben that they'll see their dad when the 2nd Mass meets up with the 3rd in about two days.

Tessa's dad calls her over and reminds her that she knows why the kids are there. He tells her not to like him (Hal) too much.

Back at the 2nd Mass high school HQ, Weaver hopes that Sarah doesn't go into labor until after they move out even though she's overdue. Maggie assures Weaver that Sarah will keep up.

At the ranch, Hal makes food from the garden. Clayton tells Mike he saw his friends on their way. He brought back apples. He tells them he didn't see any skitters nearby.

Lt. Clayton and Tessa's dad make up an excuse to go to the barn and check on Pope. Clayton thanks Pope again for the intel. He explains that he knew Weaver wouldn't question orders if he thought they came from Porter. Pope questions Clayton's decision to trust the skitters.

They caught Pope breaking into their supply shed, where he killed Tessa's uncle to get in. Clayton leaves Tessa's dad alone with Pope. He takes out knife and Pope shows him he's broken free of his restraints. They fight and Pope gets the knife and the upper hand. He thinks about stabbing him, but leaves him unconscious instead.

Pope makes his way free with a rifle. He finds the 2nd Mass military men Clayton ""escorted"" home lying dead in a field.

Back at the high school HQ, Dai and Tom prep the motorbikes. Tom wants to go on patrol. He's anxious that the escort isn't back yet. Tom wants to do the half day walk to check on the kids. Weaver lets him and Dai go check, but orders them to come back.

Tessa's dad is back up on his feet and Clayton tells him not to worry about Pope. They plan to pretend like everything's normal until the next exchange tomorrow.

Clayton notices Rick's not eating. He remembers how he was sick all the time before the skitters took him. He looks at Ben and asks him how he can eat ""their"" food.

Lourdes notices a backpack in the other room -- it belongs to Eli, the kid whose parents tried to steal medical supplies and who Clayton turned over to the skitters.

Hal and Tessa check out the night sky. He's nervous there aren't even patrols. He says it's the first time he's been apart from his dad since the attack.

Lourdes interrupts. She shows Hal and Mike the backpack. Hal notices where the sentries are posted and says it looks more like they're watching the ranch than for signs of attack. Mike says he's known Clayton for a long time and thinks there's nothing to it.

Later that night, Mike goes to check out the locked up barn. He breaks inside and sees where they were holding Pope. He finds other backpacks and kids things, including Eli Russell's jacket. He turns around to find Clayton holding a gun on him.

Clayton tells him Eli was there.

Then he tells Mike about the 7th Mass getting wiped out by skitters. They retreated and lost track of a girl named Megan. The skitters stopped attacking for a week and they realized they only wanted the kids. Megan came and talked to them later, harnessed and speaking for a skitter.

Clayton tells him they're trading kids for immunity for his men and their families.

Mike realizes the story about the 3rd Mass was all a ruse. Clayton asks him to make a choice and think about Rick.

Anne wheels Sarah on a gurney. She's in labor. The dad was a sperm donor. Maggie holds her hand.

Mike tells Hal what Rick was like before he was taken. He says he hated when Rick was taken, but he hates what they did to him even more. He grabs his gun and tells Hal about Clayton's deal. They get everyone up and start to leave, but run into Tessa. Hal asks her if she knew. She says she was going to talk to her dad to make an exception for him. She calls for her dad.

Mike and the kids run off into the woods around the ranch, with Clayton and the men behind. Clayton shouts that they need the little ones alive. They trade gunfire. Mike hunkers behind a truck with Rick and calls for Hal. He asks him to promise to take care of Rick.

Mike tells his son he loves him and tells him to run. Rick is stone faced and unemotional, but leaves. Mike stays behind to hold them off, but doesn't notice when Clayton sneaks up behind him.

The kids are running through the woods as a shot rings out.

Tom comes back from patrol, reporting to Weaver that Clayton's map is wrong. The escorts still aren't back. Tom is questioning Clayton's ""orders"". He goes back out to search.

Hal and Lourdes lead nine kids through the woods. They stop at a house to rest. Lourdes plays the piano. Ben looks at Rick's harness implants and feels his own.

He goes to talk to Hal, offering to go on ahead because he has better endurance than everyone else. Jimmy questions whether Ben will go to the school. Hal OKs the plan.

Ben runs to the school. He stops at a stream to get water and hears voices. He sees Clayton and his men on patrol.

Sarah's still in labor but Anne determines that the baby is breech. Weaver comes to check. He hears the baby is breech and offers that one of his daughters was as well and was born at home. He turned her around from the outside. He offers to help.

Tom and Dai stop on the road and see Ben. He tells them Clayton's coming and he thinks Mike's dead.

At the house with the kids, Rick stands and stares out a window. He says he's waiting.

They hear voices outside. It's Clayton and his men, heavily armed. They shout at the kids to come out. Hal shouts that he knows about his deal and opens fire. Clayton tells his man to take out Hal, but before he can fire, the man is hit. Pope is shooting from behind a tree.

""How's that skitter deal working now?"" he shouts. They trade fire and Pope gets hit in the leg.

Pope looks up to see Tom opposite him. Pope catches him up on the situation. Tom says they can't get into a firefight because they'll lose. He takes Pope's magazine and tosses it and shouts that Pope is dead.

Tom comes out with his arms raised, saying he knows Clayton lied because he talked to Porter. He surrenders, shouting for Hal to come out. Hal listens, but asks his dad what he's done. Tom tells him he would have ended up dead. ""First rule of combat is survive,"" Tom says.

Clayton marches the kids and Tom back to the ranch. Clayton orders the kids in the stable. When Matt protests, one of Clayton's guys turns on him with a gun and a shot rings out.

We see Weaver just fired. Another of Clayton's men turns his gun and Weaver takes him out too. He asks who's next. Weaver is there with dozens of men. Clayton drops his automatic weapon and asks if Weaver's going to shoot him.

""Only if I have to,"" Weaver says.

Clayton takes a few steps and asks Tom what comes next. Then he suddenly reaches for a gun he had tucked in his shirt and wheels on Tom. Tom shoots him dead.

Hal asks his dad if he knew they'd be waiting. Tom hoped so. Ben runs out. Tom sent him to Weaver.

Jimmy thanks Ben.

Weaver tells the traitors they can stay or go but if he finds them dealing with the skitters, he'll kill them all.

Back at high school HQ, Pope is surly to be on a bed next to the crying baby. Tom points out he could have kept running. Pope acknowledges that he probably will if given the chance. There's a spot in the kitchen for him until then.

Hal leads a service for Mike, saying he chose to fight for his friends. Maggie takes his hand. Tom tells his friend to rest easy. ""We'll take it from here,"" he says.

Weaver says Clayton told his skitter friends he'd secure their kids, so they should have a couple of days.

Rick says he doesn't understand how people can kill each other. ""We would never kill one of our own,"" he says to Ben. ""You should understand that."""

He hears a noise and thinks it might be his wife, Linda. He turns around to see a skitter lunging at him. Tom wakes him up. Colonel Porter has arrived.

Outside, Hal finds Ben doing never-ending jumping jacks. Hal checks Ben's stop watch and finds he's been doing them for two hours and 45 minutes. Ben acts like maybe he set the time wrong so he doesn't alarm Hal. He assures his older brother he's fine.

Porter commends Tom and Weaver for the job they're doing. Tom suggests they move on to get ahead of the skitters. Weaver is lost in thought. Porter asks Weaver when the last time he slept was.

Porter tells them recon says the skitters are pulling back to the structure over Boston. Tom thinks it could be clearing the field before a new attack. Porter has heard the same thing is happening over L.A. and Chicago. The resistance wants to launch a coordinated attack on the structures in four days.

Porter tells Tom to do recon on the structure. He tells them Clayton wasn't completely lying, the 7th Mass was wiped out, and they've lost contact with the 4th and 5th. The plan is for each remaining unit to attack one leg of the structure, bomb it so it'll collapse. They have the materials, but didn't have the expertise until recently.

They take Porter to Pope, who's still convalescing from his leg wound with Anne. ""Isn't he the ex-con who fired on your unit?"" Porter asks. ""That is so three weeks ago,"" Pope says.

Weaver sees Ricky sitting nearby and goes to check on him. He's drawing pictures of the skitters and Weaver is particularly interested in a series of row houses Rick drew.

Weaver checks out Pope and decides he knows what he's talking about, but he doesn't want him on the mission, just prep.

Rick gives Weaver his drawing.

In the middle of the night, Weaver tries to sleep, but pops pills instead. He looks at Rick's picture.

Pope checks out Uncle Scott's demolition plans and collection of mech hardware. He mocks the bomb plans. Scott shows him a piece of a mech they salvaged, but as soon as he touches it, it blasts a hole through the wall. Matt runs off.

Tom finds him hunkered down in the hall. Tom tells him to stay away from Pope. Matt's eager to fight, but Tom says not yet.

Hal, Dai and Tom prep for their scouting mission. Tom asks them if they've noticed anything off about Weaver. He walks in as Tom's talking and announces he's going with them. He had a construction business and says knowing where to hit the structure is key.

Ben visits Anne for a follow-up. Some of the harnessed kids implants have gone away, but not his. She notices the skin around the implants looks weird. She prods at it with a scalpel, but Ben can't feel it. She really jabs, but he doesn't bleed or react at all. It's turning brown and crusty. Anne tells Ben she's worried about Rick, who doesn't seem to be reacting to his dad's death. Ben offers to talk to him.

Tom, Hal and Weaver look at the structure over Boston. It's made out of general contracting materials, steel and rebar. He says it's constructed simply.

Hal points out a group of skitters on a bridge. Something approaches them -- another alien entirely that's much taller and lankier than the skitters, almost humanoid. The skitters bow down to it.

Tom worries that it's the first time they've seen them, that maybe they were hanging back until they thought it was safe.

They see someone running nearby and follow. They start getting shot at. A woman shouts at them and they tell her they want to talk. Sonia (Blair Brown) introduces herself. She's been living in Boston and invites them to talk.

Tom wants to see what she knows, but Hal and Weaver think they have to get going. Tom points out the fact she's survived this long means she knows what she's doing.

Weaver tells them to go inside and he'll stand watch. He looks at Rick's drawing again.

Matt wanders into the bomb making classroom where Pope is. He's nervous about some of the mech parts, but Pope assures him they're dead. He tells Pope he has nightmares and is afraid all the time, but he wants to be brave. Pope tries to demystify the mechs for him, telling him they're just parts and gears. He explains that their bullets are reconstituted from our military bullets.

""I wish we could use these on them,"" Matt says. ""From the mouths of babes,"" says Pope, inspired.

Ben sits down with Rick, trying to make nice. Rick is bothered by how people look at them. He says they don't understand, but they will. Rick isn't upset about his dad's death, he says that was part of his life before. He tells Ben they're the lucky ones and the skitters love them and will come back for them.

Sonia pours Hal and Tom tea from fine china in her unscathed apartment. She's scavenged everything herself, but seems a little off mentally. She tells them aliens took her to a camp for a while, but the aliens let her go because they don't care about people like her.

""After what happened to us in the camp, I know that they don't want us here, not any of us,"" she says.

They hear a noise and rush out to find Weaver racing off on his bike. He pulled the sparkplugs on their bikes. They fix the bikes, and discuss how to get to Weaver's old house. They assure Sonia they're coming back.

Anne gets Lourdes for a secret project. She's cutting open the dead skitter in the basement. Anne cuts deep inside and finds a harness. It's what she was afraid of. It means they were harnessed and the thing might have been something else before.

Tom and Hal pull up to Weaver's old house, which looks like the row house Rick drew. Tom tells Hal to report their recon back to Porter.

Tom goes inside and finds old dried blood on the floor. He finds Weaver drinking straight from the bottle outside. He tells Tom he and his wife split a year before the attack. He shows Tom Rick's picture. He thinks it's his house and maybe the skitters planted it to get in his head.

Tom says it looks like most of the houses on the block. Tom doesn't think they can read our minds. He asks about the blood.

Weaver came to the house after the bombs and found his wife's fiancé badly hurt. His daughter Sophia was grabbed. He went after her and found her. He brought her home and tried to take the harness off himself. She bled out. Tom wishes he'd told him.

Weaver tells Tom he's been fighting for revenge this whole time, but it's not enough. He wants to sleep in his own bed. Tom tells him he can't quit days before the attack.

They hear a mech outside. Hal runs and hides. Weaver tells Tom he'll draw it out, but Tom respectfully declines that terrible idea.

Weaver notices his wife's glasses and regroups. He draws the mech out while Tom lobs a grenade at it. Tom runs and it homes in on Weaver, drawing a bead on his forehead. It explodes.

Hal says it came straight for the house. They realize Sonia is the only one who knew where they were.

Cut to Sonia talking to someone through her key hole. The men are inside her apartment, with guns drawn. Sonia reports that she hasn't seen anyone since the men who were there earlier. Hal recognizes the voice on the other side -- it's his girlfriend Karen. She's harnessed. Tom holds him back. Sonia says Karen has been bringing her food. Tom looks through the peep hole and see one of the humanoid aliens with her.

Sonia says the aliens promised they wouldn't hurt her. They realize she's been informing to them, that's why they let her go. Tom invites her to come with them, but she's delusional and wants to wait for her family to return. Tom then tells her they're heading to Gloucester. They're going in the opposite direction.

Anne looks at Rick's picture of a skitter cradling him. Lourdes wants to tell people about their discovery, but Anne is worried how people will treat Ben and Rick. She knows she has to tell Tom. ""After everything he went through to get him, he could still lose Ben,"" Anne says.

Back at the high school, Tom tells Weaver he sees no reason to tell Porter about their side trip. He asks what changed his mind about coming back. Weaver shows Tom his wife's glasses. They were her only pair and they weren't in the house a week after the attack. He thinks that means there's a chance his wife and oldest daughter are alive.

They hear Pope yelling in the courtyard. He's leading a demonstration. Matt comes out and hugs his dad and tells him he's been working with Pope. He knows how to kill the mechs.

Pope explains the problem is it takes an entire magazine to dent a mech. He takes an assault rifle and demonstrates. The bullets bounce off. Then he shows them the mech metal slug. He loads it into a revolver. It blasts a hole clean through it.

Ben notices Rick running off.

Pope tells Weaver with bullet making materials he can melt the mech parts down and make more mech bullets. Weaver tells him to get on it.

""We're taking this fight to them,"" he announces to cheers."

""Those needles in his back aren't going away, though,"" Tom says of his son. ""Not like those other kids."" Is Ben turning into an alien? Tom then pays a visit to Weaver, who insists he is ""fine."" Tom wonders if Weaver doth protest too much.

Suddenly, there is a ruckus. Dai returns, but he is injured. No one seems to hear his report before Weaver is telling his men that tomorrow's mission is still a go. Tom challenges Weaver in front of the other soldiers, angering Lt. Danner. ""The only way it can be successful is if the fighters have absolute confidence in their commanding officer,"" Weaver warns Tom, who is still thinking about Weaver's apparent mental break. Tom then vows allegiance to Weaver, who ""rewards"" the former professor with sentry duty. Later, Tom gets scary news from Lourdes and Anne: Weaver recently -- and quietly -- asked Lourdes to provide him uppers and downers. ""Classic addictive cycle,"" Anne explains. Not good with the all-important battle looming.

Pope, meanwhile, supervises the pouring of the new ""mech bullets"" with his usual tact. He calls Matt a ""prince"" and wonders what it's like to be a Mason. ""What's it like having hair like a girl?"" Matt spits back. Pope is clearly angry, then calms himself and offers a weak laugh. Tom then approaches Weaver. ""I know about the pills,"" Tom whispers. Weaver bristles -- and has Danner remove Tom from the room at gunpoint. ""You're making a mistake,"" Tom warns. ""These people are depending on you!"" Danner takes Tom to lock up in the boiler room lest he ""poison the ranks.""

Ben, meanwhile, visits Uncle Scott, who is working on a project to jam the radio frequencies used by the skitters. He turns on the radio ... and Ben immediately WINCES. The young man hears a screeching noise, but Uncle Scott doesn't hear a thing. Uh oh. Weaver then visits Pope with a ""change of plans:"" he know needs four bombs instead of one. Pope warns that the fuses will be awfully short if split four ways. Weaver tells Pope not to ask questions. Later, Ben tells Rick about Scott's radio plan. Rick wonders why Ben hasn't admitted to being connected to the aliens. ""You're not telling them because you're scared,"" Rick says. ""You can feel the change coming.""

Jimmy then tells Hal and Maggie that Weaver put Tom in the makeshift jail. Jimmy offers to help spring the captive and brings Tom a plate of dinner ... nodding conspiratorially at the prisoner. When Danner opens the cell door Tom bursts out. A scuffle between Tom and Danner ensues, but it's quickly broke up by the arrival of an armed Hal. Father and son hogtie Danner. ""We've got to find a way to stop Weaver,"" Tom says. Tom then pays a visit to Dai in the infirmary. Dai explains that Porter is ""probably dead"" due to a massive skitter attack -- and told Dai to abort the attack mission. Dai reported the same to Weaver, who promptly ignored the order. So Weaver is nuts.

Weaver, in the meantime, finds the hogtied Danner, who explains that Tom escaped with the help of Hal and Jimmy. Weaver is hurt that Jimmy would betray him. Later, Ben approaches Uncle Scott, asking the old man to turn back on the transistor radio. When Scott does, Ben doesn't hide the fact that he can hear something. ""I don't know what I am,"" Ben confesses. CUT to Tom, who finds out from Pope that Weaver wanted the bomb split into four pieces -- to make up for the other regiments who are clearly not coming. Tom aims a gun at Pope and ""requests"" that the munitions guy put the bomb back together. No dummy, Pope agrees. Tom then bursts in on Weaver, who defends himself by yelling, ""The aliens have to know that we're not going to lie down!""

Pope then enters the room caring a VERY BIG GUN. He announces that he did not disarm the bombs, after all -- and that he'd rather see the attack carried out. Tom lowers his own gun, giving Weaver control ... but not completely. ""I took the blasting fuses,"" says Tom, explaining that the bombs can't be detonated without them. Tom then implores Weaver to just be honest -- tell the people that Porter is dead and didn't want to attack. Tell the people that Weaver wants to go ahead with the mission anyway. Let the people decide. ""You can trust our people the way they trust you,"" Tom reasons. Adds Anne: ""We want to follow you ... all of us. You just have to let us.""

Weaver lowers his weapon -- and demands that Pope do the same. ""Gather everyone in the gym,"" Weaver says. ""By the way, I'll quit taking those pills as soon as we get back."" CUT to the gym, where Weaver informs the people that the other regiments can't be reached ... and that Porter is probably dead. He asks for 50 volunteers to go on the attack mission without knowing whether the other regiments will show up to support them. ""If you're with me, meet me in front,"" Weaver says. Turns out plenty of men and women answer the call. Outside, Margaret challenges Pope's murky intentions. Whose side is he on? Pope remains cagey -- and Margaret warns the rogue not to cross her.

He has recently learned that his son Ben can hear the alien communications via Scott's radio. Tom and Ben then leave the room to find a new battery for the radio, leaving Scott alone. Scott sees a shadow ... and hears something. He looks up and finds Rick climbing on the ceiling like Spider-Man. ""I won't let you hurt them,"" says Rick, who leaps toward Scott. Uh oh. CUT to a line of trucks and motorcycles rumbling down a leaves-strewn road. The caravan stops and Hal notices that Weaver's hands are shaking. ""How much did your father tell you?"" Weaver asks. Hal knows all about the pills, but explains that going to battle is the right thing to do.

Back at the high school, the gang learns that Rick is the traitor. Scott is OK, but the radio is destroyed. Ben soon seeks out Rick, who holds the stolen radio part in his hand. Rick wonders why Ben is upset considering that Ben can hear them too. ""I want them out of my head,"" Ben says. Asks Rick: ""Why? I think they're better than the humans."" Rick then leaps out of the window. He runs into a little girl in the woods, who clearly has a harness in her back. ""You need to tell us everything about the people you've been with,"" she says sweetly. Rick readily agrees.

Moments later, Tom finds a crying Rick sitting on the ground -- alone. ""She left me,"" he says. ""I wanted to be with them, but they didn't care."" Apparently, Rick was abandoned by the aliens. He apologizes to Tom for telling the aliens, well, everything. Not good. CUT to Weaver, who stops the caravan at the point where all the regiments were to rendezvous. Unfortunately, the other regiments haven't arrived, so the volunteers must choose whether to continue. Everyone still wants to fight, so Weaver splits the volunteers into four squads. ""Those bombs of your's better be good to go,"" Weaver tells Pope.

Back at the school, Tom gives the stolen transmitter to Scott and tells him to get to work. He then tells the Margaret, Annie and others that the aliens know where they are -- and will soon attack. Tom's plan: take the civilizations through a tunnel and head west. Tom then cites battles from the American Revolution as inspiration of small forces triumphing over large forces. ""So let's go do this,"" he says. In the meantime, Weaver has ordered Hal back to the school so he can tell the his father -- and all the civilians -- that the other regiments didn't show and that they need to evacuate the school. Hal resists. He wants to fight, but Weaver is adamant. ""You listen to me: there will be other battles after today,"" Weaver said. He obviously cares for the boy.

Back at the school, Tom tries to usher Ben out along with the rest of the evacuees. But Ben refuses, explaining that, because the skitters keep changing their radio frequencies, he needs to stay behind and help Scott try to jam their communications. ""If I can use what the skitters did to me to get back at them, then I have to,"" Ben pleads. Tom reluctantly agrees before hustling outside to join the front lines stationed outside the school. Just then, a mech marches into view. The defense team opens fire ... and the mech is taken down. The celebration is short lived, however, as a half dozen other mechs soon march into view. It looks bleak.

Inside, Ben helps Scott find the proper frequency, but the mechs still don't stop. The signal isn't strong enough -- they need a bigger antenna. Ben notices the flag pole outside, grabs some jumper cables and makes a run for it. The mechs open fire ... and then suddenly begin to scramble aimlessly. Confused, the mechs turn and retreat. The radio jamming worked. The humans celebrate -- and Tom embraces his heroic son.

Later, Hal returns with Weaver's news: the other regiments didn't show. The makeshift army is likely walking into a slaughter. Tom then has an idea. He tells Hal to retrieve the transmitter from Scott and pack it up. Tom then visits Anne, who is packing up and preparing to leave. ""I'm not going with you right away,"" says Tom, who explains that he is headed to Boston to help Weaver. Anne asks about his sons. ""If something should happen to me, you're the only person that I trust to watch out for them,"" Tom says. Then, suddenly, the two passionately kiss. Later, Tom says goodbye to his boys and gets into a car that has been rigged with Scott's radio. Time to head for the front.

CUT to the front. Tom arrives to find Pope cradling an injured Anthony. The professor orders Pope to drive Anthony back to Anne for help. Tom, meanwhile, will continue toward Weaver. Pope gives Tom a rocket launcher as a deadly peace offering. ""Tom, good luck to you,"" Pope says. Speaking of Weaver, the captain sits bleeding in the cab of a truck when Tom arrives. He notices that the alien ships are all returning to the mother station. ""We rattled their cage,"" Tom tells Weaver. In a last ditch effort that Weaver deems useless, Tom fires the rocket launcher at the one of the returning ships. It's a direct hit! The flaming ship SLAMS into the mother station, igniting a huge fire.

A chain reaction of blasts begin. ""Good shot,"" Weaver says with a deadpan. ""We got their attention."" Laughing, Tom and Weaver then get into a truck and drive away. They make it some miles down the road before Tom SLAMS on the breaks. Karen is standing in the middle of the road. ""They brought me here,"" she says in a monotone voice. ""Because they don't understand."" Just then, a HUGE alien ship lowers onto the ground. The hatch opens and one of the slimy leaders steps out. ""They didn't expect resistance on this level,"" Karen says. ""They find that ... interesting. They'd like to talk."" Tom then begins yelling at the extra terrestrial. ""You murder millions of people, you steal our children, and now you want to negotiate!?"" Tom screams.

Karen warns Tom not to shoot ... ""because of Ben."" ""They'll call him back unless you go with them,"" she says. Tom lowers his weapon and -- against Weaver's protests -- and walks into the belly of the alien ship. To be continued ..."

Storm must overcome her claustrophobia as the X-Men venture into the New York sewers to rescue Jean Grey and Cyclops from a deformed race of mutants called the Morlocks.,[],TV-Y7-FV,Release date,"['Richard Bowman', 'Larry Houston']","['', '', '']",[],"['callisto character', 'morlocks the marvel comics group', 'classic animation', 'claustrophobia', 'love triangle']",[],"As Wolverine recuperates, thanks to his mutant power of accelerated healing, Xavier pushes the remaining X-Men harder in their training sessions to prepare them for threats like Magneto and to spare them fates like Morph. Storm's claustrophobia is finally revealed to the others during a Danger Room exercise when the threat of enclosing walls sends the otherwise composed African mutant into an overwhelming panic, unleashing her raw power and greatly endangering her teammates. The usually gruff and grumpy Wolverine is revealed to indeed have a softer side when he is visited by Jean Grey who asks him to take it easy during his recovery. Wolverine attempts to show no weakness but his injuries are still serious enough to crumple him when exerted. Jean goes to his side and helps him up. They share a tender moment, revealing not only Wolverine's feelings for her but also her brief interest in them as well. This revelation helps to explain a lot about Wolverine's attitude towards Cyclops in general. Jean comes to her senses and breaks away from Logan, awkwardly explaining about being late for a date with Cyclops and leaving Wolverine full of heartache. Later, whilst out on said date, Cyclops and Jean encounter strange mutants in the subway that clash with a group of ordinary but bigoted humans. Forced to step in and help, the couple manage to contain the situation before they are placed under a trance and captured. Upon awakening, Cyclops is introduced to his captor, a mutant named Callisto, ruler of a subterranean tribe of mostly deformed and unsightly mutant outcasts called Morlocks. Callisto wants Cyclops to remain as her lover and provide her with an heir, even threatening to kill Jean Grey should he refuse. Jean manages to alert Xavier telepathically and he sends Storm, Rogue, Gambit and the (mostly) recovered Wolverine to rescue them. They must descend into the tightly spaced tunnels beneath New York which causes Storm some anxiety, though as any good leader, she presses on. The team manage to find Jean but Callisto refuses to part with Cyclops and the two groups clash. The Morlocks are no match for the highly-trained X-Men with Rogue knocking Sunder around the sewer, Jean knocks Masque and Erg down telekinetically, Wolverine briefly tangles with Callisto but she flees, Gambit fends off an attack from Glow Worm and Storm defeats both Tar-Baby and Scaleface. After an encounter with Plague, Gambit and Rogue are forced to retreat back to the mansion in order to save Gambit's life. Wolverine goes after Callisto but discovers an unconscious and captive Cyclops instead. His hesitance to rescue his team leader alerts Callisto and Annalee to his feelings for Jean and they use it against him, with Annalee using her powers to hypnotize Wolverine into attacking Cyclops. Jean subdues him and Analee, giving Callisto a chance to get her hands on Cyclops and she uses this leverage to order her remaining Morlocks to kill the X-Men one at a time until their leader, Storm, agrees to Callisto's terms. Storm counters that by cleverly challenging Callisto to a duel, not only for the lives of the X-Men but for the leadership of the Morlocks as well! Unable to decline lest she lose face, Callisto agrees but forbids Storm from using her powers. Instead they will battle it out both armed with laser staffs. Storm and Callisto clash with Callisto gaining the upper hand, until she accuses Storm of being ""soft"" thanks to her life on the surface world. Storm's younger years had been anything BUT easy and soft and this flagrant judgment infuriates the Wind Rider enough to turn the tables on Callisto, defeating the Morlock Queen in a quick and clean display of fighting prowess. Though Storm is the victor she allows Callisto to live, as killing is not the X-Men's way. As the new leader of the Morlocks, Storm offers them sanctuary at the X-Mansion but they refuse, stating they would only resurface if and when humanity accepts mutantkind. Storm understands and promises to return to them should that happen. In her absence, she places Callisto in charge once more. As the X-Men prepare to leave the sewers Cyclops and Jean shared a romantic kiss, witnessed by a heartbroken Wolverine. Back at the mansion, Xavier is greatly pleased with Storm's remarkable leadership. Jean and Scott sought to thank Wolverine but find his room empty and realize that he has left the team..."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0833652/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Rachel writes a short story with characters that resemble the Winslow family.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Joel Zwick'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"The episode begins with Laura giving Estelle a lot of mail from celebrites she knows and gives her father a water bill. Then he takes a letter addressed to Rachel from the SciFi magazine for a short story she wrote into the kitchen and complains about the skyrocketing water bill. At first she's excited about the news and that thinks they've accepted her story. Immediately, she feels dejected that the magazine rejected her short story. Minutes later, Eddie comes into the house and tells Carl that he's done washing the car. His father is upset that he's wasting water and he blames his father for doing something good. Harriette apologizes to Rachel that they rejected her story, but firmly tells her that she can't write about things she doesn't know. She needs to stick with what she knows about and heads to the sink to wash the lettuce but the water has been turned off. Carl comes back and announces that the water will be off, but they'll save a lot of money. Harriette tells him that she knows how they'll save even more money, no one in the house eats, causing him to turn the water back on.

The next day, Rachel has Writer's block since she has too many ideas, but couldn't put it on paper. Laura's suggesstion to her is interrupted by Carl's announcement to have everyone report to the living room at once. Then he asks who left the sprinkler system on all day and complains that the front yard looks like a rice patty. Most of the family denies any involvement in what happened. Eddie comes home and confesses that he left the sprinkler system on all day. Carl tells him that he forgot to turn it off and mentions that if they short on cash, he'll be the first one to go. Harriette tells her husband that he's go too far with the water bill and wants him to lighten up. Carl refuses and goes too far by telling them that no one uses the water without written permission from him. The family complains as all three members heads into the kitchen. Laura tells Rachel her suggestion to write a story about their family because people love stories about domestic violence.

Later on, Rachel recieves a letter from Tommorow's Woman Magazine and she's real excited that she sold her story and makes copies for the whole family to read. Harriette watches Little Richie and tells Laura to change his diaper. After dinner, she comes into the kitchen and asks the Winslow family how they liked her story. To Rachel's surprise, no one loved her story and Carl told her how upset they are that the characters resembled the family:

Estelle claims she isn't pushy and wants her to take her out of the story at once.


Carl claims he's not an overbearing cheapskate, which Mother Winslow whole heartedly disagrees with him.


Laura is totally upset that she was displayed as some smart alec who doesn't know when to shut up.


Judy was upset at Rachel because she made her look like she liked to complain a lot and tells her she has never complained a day in her life.


However, Eddie is the only one who really loved her story and was happy that she captured the real essence of him, a guy whose great with the girls. Laura tells him off that it's the only part it's fiction and he's not real good with the ladies. Eddie is insulted by her commernt, but the sibling rivalry is short lived compared to how their mother truly feels about the story.


Harriette tells Rachel that her story is about both them and how she sees her as an overbearing older sister who always loves pushing her around. She also mentions that it's nice to know how she really feels about her. Rachel tells Harriette that the story is fiction and she made it up. Harriette responds by telling her that her actions speak louder than her words.


After everyone has calmed down, Rachel explains herself to Estelle that it's how freelance writers express themselves. They may take someone they know and use them as inspiration for their fictional characters, like Ernest Hemmingway did. Estelle understands and forgives her. Next, Carl tells her that he has convinced Harriette to talk to her. They head into the living room and he tells them to straighten out the misunderstanding. However, all of his efforts leads to an all out screaming match between the sisters. Rachel threatens to write a novel about her sister and Harriette challenges her to do an intraction. Carl heads into the kitchen to drink some coffee and Mother Winslow asked if they made up yet. He said they were close, real close. However, Estelle didn't even believe him for a second and knows that he has escalated Harriette and Rachel's fight further.

The next day, Eddie is in the hallway dressed up in his best outfit and cheap cologne to ask Linda Fontana to go out on a date with him. Laura warns him to reconsider asking her out because all he'll get is rejection and it's not worth the embarrassment. As usual, he ignores her warning and heads off to Linda's house(a terrible mistake on his part). She heads into the kitchen and sits down on a stool.

Carl walks in the kitchen a few minutes later as Harriette is slowly grating carrots for salad. He asks her if she has reconciled with Rachel. All he got was her shreadding the carrots faster, which implied she still hadn't forgiven her at all. Rachel comes home a few minutes laters and tells Carl that she will be eating lunch in her room. Harriette tells him to imform her sister that if she eats in her room, that she better calls for pizza because there's no way her food is leaving the kitchen. Rachel tells him to inform Harriette that's just fine with her and leaves. Carl tells Harriette that she took the story too literally and tries to convince her to talk to her sister. She refuses to even budge, even after he kissed her. This action causes Laura to go to her aunt's room and convince her to talk to their mother.

In Rachel's rooom, she's about to eat a slice of pizza which she ordered, when Laura comes her room. Her aunt tells her this is the worst fight she and Harriete had for a long time. Laura tells her of her own experiences with Judy, who shows up for her doll and tosses a pillow as a reminder to knock first. Rachel tells her, she needs to apologize to her sister at once. Laura tells her she will and tells her despite what's going on between them, they can't their fighting sever their close knit bond with each other. She leaves her aunt's room and congratulates Judy for her help. She comments what their mother and aunt do without them helping out.

Rachel agrees and heads into the kitchen to talk to Harriette. She apologizes for the story she wrote about her, but she also tells her that sometimes she feels like she's too overprotective of her. Harriette tells her the real reason why she did what she had to do. She wanted Rachel to be safe and only wants the best for her. Rachel agrees, but she needs her sister, not another mother. Harriette agrees and promises to not be pushy towards her anymore. Carl is happy that they worked out their differences and Rachel's glad her story didn't do anymore damages.

The happiness is short lived when Eddie comes home black and blue and his best shirt torn on the shoulders. Carl asks him what happened to him today and he tells them that he went over to Linda Fontana's house to ask her out. His father asks him if she beat him up, which both Harriette and Rachel gave him a dirty look though. He asked whatever happened to girls just saying no for dates. Eddie tells him it wasn't her, but her boyfriend, Bubba that beat him up. He tells Rachel that the next time she writes a story, just leave him out of it. Carl decides it's time for another father/son talk with him about girls and boyfriends named Bubba. As they head into the living room, he smells Eddie and tells him that he stinks (due to his cheap cologne)."

He complains about the whole thing but she convinces him to wait it out because she has to get more pins. Eddie attempts to get the dress off him before someone sees him and gets the wrong idea about him being a transsexual. Later on, Carl walks in with Laura and Judy and he gets the wrong idea, while his sisters laugh at him.

The episode that ensured ""Family Matters'"" success. Harriette is adamantly refusing Laura to go to the dance until she learns some responsibilites in the way she treats her sister. Carl convinces her to let her go just for one night, but she refuses. She thinks if Laura starts dating at 13, she and the boy will get serious and it'll be a mess. She reluctantly agrees when Carl convinces her that he'll keep tabs on her.

At Leroy's a popular teen hangout, Laura is bemoaning her inability to get a date with cute classmate Mark for the school dance. However, her friend, Penny tells her that he's already going with another girl and the only one available is Steven Q. Urkel. Laura refuses the nerd and keeps looking towards Mark.

At the home, no one has called, despite Carl's optimism and Harriette's pessimistic and refusal in letting her daughter go to the dance proved true. That is until, he convinces Rachel to make the dress for Laura. Eddie and Carl make well-meaning attempts to set Laura up with someone. It is Carl who sets his daughter up with Steven Q. Urkel, as a favor to Dr.Urkel, a decision he'll live to regret. Laura eventually gets over her shyness and asks Mark out, per Eddie's reccomendation to put herself on the market. He encourages her if no one wants to go to the dance with her, they're not worth it.

On the night of the dance, Harriette is impresseed by Rachel's dress she made for Laura and is reminded about the time when she made it when they were kids. Her mistake in pulling on a loose thread, causes Rachel and her to frantically fix the dress, while Laura runs upstairs to change into a different dress. Carl opens the door to and allows Urkel in with his flowes from the cemetery. The quintessential nerd drives everyone batty just being himself. Eddie shows up with Tyrone, before Mark shows up and Laura reveals that he's her date to the dance. Soon after, she's humiliated by Eddie and Carl for what they've done.

She runs out of the house crying as Harriette talks to her. Laura thinks she's ugly, but her mother reminds her that she's not. Laura revealed that Mark and his girlfriend broke up and would've gone with anyone else had she not asked him. Harriette tells her that boys are shy like her and are scared of rejection. She could remember how many times Carl had to get over his fear to ask her out. Laura and Mark leave for the dance, after Rachel has fixed the dress. Urkel decides to stay until 10 p.m. - the earliest his folks want him home - and makes himself at home! Then he asks if anyone's got any cheese, which horrifies everyone.

After the dance, Laura told them how her date went and for three hours they didn't dance until Mark asked her to. Carl apologizes for what happened and was a fool for making her look like a charity case."

Eliot in a voice over. She's awake, but upset she's only got one pill left for her bad back.

Fancy graphics show the 16 grains of pill goodness bouncing out of the pill into a line. Just enough to get her bad back up and running, she says before she snorts a line.

Jackie attends to a man in the ER as Dr. Cooper hangs up his Bluetooth and shoves her aside. Jackie checks the patient's eyes and tells the doctor he needs a brain scan. She's sure he has a bleed on his brain, but the arrogant doctor brushes her off.

Cut to Jackie turning off his machines. Acute subdural hematoma. A 27-year-old bike messenger she tells the transplant team. Then she hangs up and forges his signature on his license for organ donation, telling him he should not have died but he won't die in vain.

She meets with his mother and oafish brothers, who are only worried about his $3,000 bike.

Jackie walks in to talk to Dr. Cooper, acting all excited and confident. She tells him to stay the f--- out of her way. She chews him out for not listening to her and letting the messenger die.

Then Cooper randomly grabs her boob. ""Is this happening, not happening? I can't tell,"" she says. He babbles something about having a problem with involuntary sexual touching when he's nervous, like groping Tourette's.

She leaves, in a daze and hides from the hospital administrator. She meets a new nursing student, Zoey, who is wearing bunny rabbit scrubs.

Mrs. Akaltuis catches up with her and harangues her about adhering to hospital guidelines about overtime before asking her to work a double on Monday.

Jackie gets to know Zoey, whose mouth has no off switch. She likes quiet people. ""Quiet and mean, those are my people,"" Jackie says.

Eddie, a pharmacist, gets Zoey to wheel a cart of chemo meds up to the fourth floor. This gives Jackie and the doctor a moment alone to go at it against the table. Halfway through she stops, screaming about pain in her back. They stop and go to a cot nearby where they can lay for the six minutes she has. He offers her something for her back. She turns him down, but then takes him up for some Oxycodone. They get a moment of silence before a code is called.

More grams of Oxy go up a straw.

Jackie attends to young woman who's bleeding severely. She's saying the guy looked nice and asking why he had to cut her so bad. Then she shows what she has in her hand - his ear. ""Good girl,"" Jackie says. She hands it to a stunned Zoey, telling her to put it on ice and also, puke away from the ear.

Jackie sits with her friend, Dr. Elenor O'Hara. Neither reacts when a screaming woman is wheeled by. They need food. They go to lunch. She tells Elenor about Cooper squeezing her boob. Elenor says Jackie is the only sane one there. As she goes on about Jackie's dedication to the job they both notice and ignore a woman choking at a nearby table. Then Jackie gets up calmly and helps the woman.

A guy who put a firecracker up his butt comes into the ER. He's totally loaded. Jackie guesses what he's on and says she doesn't drink. ""I like to have a clear head,"" she says. Zoey asks permission to snap a picture of the guy's blown bits as a cautionary tale to her little brother.

Mo-mo the nurse comes for Jackie. The bike messenger's girlfriend Beth wants to talk to her. She didn't know about him being an organ donor. She tells the girl, who is pregnant, that she's ""deeply sorry"" but his body will save lives. Beth pauses a minute then asks for his heart. Or a kidney. She wants to sell one. Doesn't he owe her that? She starts crying. She asks what she's supposed to do. She can't even pay for a cab home. Jackie hugs her and pats her head.

More grams fall and go up the straw into Jackie's nose.

Jackie sees a man holding his bandaged head in the lobby. A cop tells her he's the one who slashed the woman but he's with the Libyan Embassy and has immunity. He only came back for his ear. As she tends to him in an exam room, Jackie tells him the prostitute he cut needed 200 stitches and he says she liked it. Jackie hangs up his jacket and bank roll and leaves for a moment.

In the bathroom, she picks up his ear and clearly enunciates ""F--- you"" into it before flushing it.

Jackie and Mo Mo lounge on the hospital church pews. They try to figure out what would have gone with John the Baptist's head on a platter. Cole slaw. No, mac and cheese. She tells Mo mo she knew about the bike messenger's bleed and waits for him to say she did all she could. He asks if that's what she wants. Her silence implies it's not necessary.

Jackie sends Zoey home. Zoey thinks Jackie is a saint. As Zoey leaves, Jackie changes a patient's IV. When there's an urgent beeping noise she realizes she made a mistake. She tells the comatose person she almost killed them. She kisses their forehead.

Jackie walks the halls, seeing Beth sleeping in the waiting room. She takes the fat bankroll from the Libyan's jacket and leaves it in Beth's hands.

Outside, Eddie asks if she wants to come over. Not tonight, she says. He brought her something for her back. A Dr. Pepper, Moon Pie and a pill packet. They say ""I love yous"" and leave.

Standing at the corner, a guy on a bicycle pulls up next to Jackie. She tells him to be careful. He says ""F--- you."" So, while he's looking away, she slashes his tire before he can ride off.

Jackie walks home, musing about Augustine the Saint who knew there was good in him, but not all good. ""Make me good, God, but not yet,"" she says.

She comes home to two young daughters, happy to see her. She walks into the kitchen, slipping a ring from her pocket onto her ring finger. A man waits in the kitchen. He made pancakes for dinner.

""It bears repeating,"" says the voice over, ""make me good, God, but not yet."""

Yes, husband. Not the guy she was doing in the on-call room last episode (that's Eddie the pharmacist, if you're keeping score). Hubby owns a bar. A haircut in the kitchen turns into some floor sex. Later, she makes her kids lunches and then grinds up some Percocet against doctors orders. She puts it in some sweetener packets for later use.

Mom and Dad serve cereal to the two girls. When one knocks the box over he has occasion to note that Daddy likes Fruity Pebbles on the floor.

Jackie takes the train to work then watches her rich doctor friend Elenor O'Hara slink out of her cab and into her spendy heels. She hands over some clothes. She's giving them away rather than having them cleaned. As they walk in the hospital, Elenor signals Jackie to take off her wedding ring.

Inside, Zoey presents Mo Mo with some ""please like me"" muffins. An agitated man comes in wanting attention. Jackie asks him to calm down and when he doesn't, she calls over burly nurse Thor, who looks every bit a Thor, and is gay. When he compliments Zoey's skin she asks Jackie if he's married. Not one to save Zoey from herself, Jackie says no and go get 'em.

And then the agitated patient comes back and slaps Jackie hard across the face. And then security comes. Jackie says she's fine then adds some Percocet sweetener to her coffee. There, all better.

A kid comes in after a skate board accident. Dr. O'Hara tends to him with Cooper. He shushes her to listen to the kid's chest, then claims he can hear an aneurysm. Claiming that's not possible to hear, she sends him away.

Eddie explains a super-collider to Jackie, she listens as raptly as she can manage.

Zoey steps into the bathroom to call her mom, freaked out after seeing Jackie hit. She tells her mom she doesn't think she can do the job. Then, the toilet gurgles. The ear that Jackie flushed in the last episode bobs up. Zoey ralphs at the sight all over again. Zoey gives it to Mrs. Akalitus, the administrator, who shows it to Jackie, who points out, sorry, but Zoey was the last one who had it. Zoey tries to figure out what's happening as Jackie attempts to diffuse. But Mrs. A says she has to open an investigation. In response, Jackie takes a packet of her Percocet sweetener out of her pocket. And oh, what luck, Mrs. A has been looking for Sweet-N-All for three days. She takes the drugged sweetener and dumps it in her coffee then walks away as Jackie watches, frozen.

Cooper and Jackie inspect a patient who was on oxygen and lit up. It took Cooper 20 minutes after his page to get there.

In the hall, Jackie sees Thor hauling the man who slapped her down the hall. She checks in with the skateboarder's mom. She's worried that they had to cut his hair to relieve the pressure in his skull. He loves his hair.

Elenor tells Jackie that, irritatingly, Cooper was right. The boy had an aneurysm. Jackie says Cooper might just have good instincts. Elenor demands she take that back. Jackie asks her friend what she thinks, hypothetically, would happen to a nursing student who flushed a body part. After checking that it wasn't a penis, Elenor says she won't get fired.

The arrive at their swanky lunch destination to find it's closed for a private party. Jackie offers to buy her a hot dog instead. Elenor freezes in her tracks and starts only slightly mock-wailing. Jackie apologizes profusely for the street meat joke. She'd never make her eat one.

Back at work, Jackie tells Cooper that he was right. Choking out each word, she tells him that she thinks he thinks he's a bad doctor and that's why he acts like an over-confident jerk. Then she tells him that she'll deny it later, but she thinks he is a good doctor. He wraps her in a big hug. Mo Mo walks around the corner to see Jackie trapped in a twerp hug. Then a bleised-out Mrs. A comes by, enjoying life and her spiked sweetener.

A code is called. It's the man who slapped Jackie. He resists as Cooper tries to treat his hand. He grabbed a radiator. He's upset about them amputating his mom's legs and that no one will listen to him. Jackie tells security to uncuff him as he screams and writhes. The police try to talk her out of it, but give in. He calms down, having finally been listened to. He apologizes for hitting Jackie. He tells her about his obese, diabetic mom whom he can't take care of. She asks someone to call social services.

Zoey hovers over Jackie as she does paperwork. She tells Jackie she's not sure she can do it. Jackie asks if this is because no one ate her muffins. Then she gives her a pep talk that sounds more like a reaming. Mrs. A walks into a door behind her.

Jackie watches over the young skateboarder. She tells his mom he's critical, but stable. She gently reminds mom to make him wear a helmet. Then mom tells Jackie she asked the photographer to take his helmet off for a few shots for his portfolio, to show off his long hair. Jackie is stunned. It may have taken them a year to grow his hair out, but it's going to take him a year to learn how to walk again, she tells the mom. She tells her it was her job to protect him.

She goes outside to get some air. She finds the oxygen tank woman waiting for a cab. Jackie tracks one down for her and finds, naturally, that the driver is having chest pains. She hauls him out and starts chest compressions. She also gives him her last sweetener to ease the pain. An addict, but a giver.

Jackie meets her hubby at his bar where he's feeding their kids dessert. She puts her ring on before she goes in. A news report on the super-collider is on the TV. She repeats back some of what Eddie told her about it. Her husband asks how she knows about it. ""I get around,"" she says meaningfully, reaching for real sweetener for her coffee."

Jackie tends to an elderly patient. Zoey comes in, showing off her new stethoscope, which Elenor promptly borrows to listen to the patient. She walks off with it. After she leaves, the patient tells Jackie he doesn't want an angioplasty or any other treatment. He doesn't want his wife to lose one minute of sleep over this.

Eddie peers in and Jackie ducks out. She tells him her back is killing her. He says hell take care of her in 20 minutes.

The paramedics bring in a woman who's freezing cold, but drenched in sweat. They're visiting from Ohio for their first anniversary. She's cramping like crazy.

Zoey bothers Jackie again and Jackie notices her stethoscope is missing. She tells her to get it back from Elenor.

Jackie meets Eddie in an exam room where, instead of pills, he gives her a back massage. She tells him his hands feel sad. He tells her he's being replaced by a machine. She rants for a while about how that's going to add lots of time to patient treatment and how irritating it's going to be to have to enter a code for every Motrin. He waits a beat and tells her he'll miss her, too.

Jackie drops in on Dr. Cooper. She wants him to tell the board to vote against the pharmacy machine, but he thinks machines are cool. He enjoys that she wants a favor and asks if this is because she has a little crush on Eddie. Dryly, she says yea, she has a huge crush on Eddie and they do it every day at noon.

Cut to a clock reading 12:01 and Eddie and Jackie going at it. He asks her to check the time, and she confirms they're doing fine, just don't get fancy.

Jackie checks on her elderly patient, who is getting treatment from his wife: chicken soup. Jackie tries again to tell him to meet with a cardiologist, but he has faith in his Jewish penicillin.

As she leaves, Mrs. Akalitus gives her the stink eye.

Jackie and Cooper examine a man with a huge bump on his forehead and slices on his testicles. He blames Roy, his cat. He says he was cleaning his tub nude and his cat went for his junk and he slipped and bumped his head.

Jackie finds the Ohio husband at the news stand and helps him pick out a magazine for his wife. Jackie and Mo Mo watch Cooper head for the elevator and she catches him checking the doctor out.

Mrs. A checks on the elderly patient and his wife, wondering what they're still doing there. Jackie tells her she told them they could wait there, but Mrs. A wants them out. Jackie asks her to be a nurse again for a minute and look at the man. She sees he's dying and agrees they can stay til the end of Jackie's shift.

Zoey tries to work up the nerve to get her stethoscope back from Dr. O'Hara. She practices what she's going to say as she walks over. Dr. O'Hara defuses her will by calling her Angela. Zoey says thanks and runs off.

Jackie and Elenor go to lunch and talk about the elderly couple. Then Elenor posits a hypothetical, asking her who survives between Eddie and her husband on the sinking Titanic. Jackie changes the subject by saying she's worried about her daughter Grace. Elenor tells her if she needs anything, anything at all, to just ask or she'll kill her, as friends do. Then Jackie checks that she does know she took Zoey's stethoscope this morning. Oh yes, and she's been having the most marvelous time watching her try to ask for it back. They enjoy a good laugh over that.

Jackie gets the lab results on the Ohio woman. She's not pregnant. She's withdrawing from opiates. Jackie asks her what she's taking. She got Vicodin when she had her wisdom teeth out a few months ago, and it's so easy to get online. Jackie tells her she's on a slippery slope. She asks Jackie not to tell her husband.

Jackie Googles something.

Then she stands over the elderly man with his wife as she shuts off his machines. The wife knew he was dying, she's at peace. Mrs. A comes in for the bed. The wife says something to her in Yiddish. Mrs. A says you're welcome but when Jackie asks the wife what it meant she says ""Go s--- in the ocean.""

Zoey approaches Dr. O'Hara in the hall, identifying herself as Angela. Dr. O'hara is wearing huge dark shades and sitting on a bench. Zoey realizes she's asleep. Then she slowly pulls the stethoscope off her and slinks away. Dr. O'Hara smiles.

At home, Jackie finds her daughter worrying that the Bubonic plague might happen again. Jackie offers her some chicken soup. Grace won't tear her eyes away from the TV. Jackie feeds her soup."

Zoey tries to cover for his medical exuberance in the face of tragedy.

Jackie and Elenor treat the boy, inserting a chest tube to drain blood. Mo Mo holds the boy's hand, telling him to hang in there.

Dr. O'Hara tells the mom her son's lung collapsed. She rattles off other possible problems, including brain damage, spinal cord issues... Jackie winces at her bluntness. Zoey hugs the mom.

Jackie talks to her husband. They have some sort of parent-teacher conference they have to go to.

But first, Jackie stares at powder in the bathroom. But it's just face powder.

She runs into Eddie in the hallway. He offers her a ride. Thanks, but no thanks. She puts on her wedding ring as she walks away.

Zoey and Mo Mo watch the mom and her son, the twin of the victim. Mo Mo says he was a twin, but his brother died when they were one.

Jackie meets her husband at the school. She shows him the socks she bought him on the street. Her phone rings. She grimaces. It's Eddie. She tells her husband she just lost a patient. They meet with three people, the school nurse and psychologist along with the teacher. They think their daughter has an anxiety disorder. Their youngest walks by the open door and waves. She sees Grace in the hall and tells her their parents are there. Grace is concerned.

Dr. O'Hara tells the twins' mom that her son is doing very well. She goes to see him and her other son wraps O'Hara in an immobilizing tiny bear hug.

Jackie and her husband check out Grace's drawing. They're impressed with it, but the teacher points out it has no color. They ask if there are problems at home. The staff tells them Grace circles her desk three times before she sits down, so the planes don't fall out of the sky. They suggest she see a shrink and get on a low-dose anxiety medicine. Grace walks in, looking glum. Jackie follows the nurse into the hall. She apologizes, but asks if they're maybe going overboard. The counselor says it's a big deal.

Outside, Jackie and her husband try to figure out what to do. Jackie thinks she watches too much news. They discuss private school. They don't end up arguing. Jackie asks him to make tacos for dinner. Jackie's phone beeps. It's Eddie saying he's horny. She looks at the message over her husband's shoulder while hugging him. She buys a disposable cell phone and gives Eddie the number when she gets back. He gives her pills.

Zoey whines about being shut out of the interesting cases and Jackie leaves her with an old woman. Cooper drops by and smooth talks the patient. Jackie watches, impressed.

O'Hara gives Jackie grief over leaving her alone with the kid and his sticky fingered gratitude. He brings her a drawing and she does her best to seem appreciative. Jackie looks at it, it's full of bright colors and sunshine.

Jackie hears a beep and finds that Zoey's old woman has died. She tells her it's never easy, and when it is, it's time to quit. Both of Jackie's cell phones start ringing as she tries to have a somber moment at a dead patient's bedside. She answers both with a ""can't talk, love ya."" Cooper walks by, loudly celebrating his exciting gun shot wound victim. Zoey wants to put eyebrows on the elderly woman, who worried before about not being made up.

Mo Mo sings to the injured twin at his bedside.

Jackie looks at her daughter's gray drawing. She takes out a highlighter and draws in a bright sun. ""There, was that so hard?"" she says."

At work, Mo Mo stops by Jackie and tells her she hasn't seen him. This is the answer she gives Thor when he asks after Mo Mo. Then she gives Zoey the ropes on working night shift. Mrs. Akalitus is concerned about the level of socializing on the shift. Jackie makes the schedule.

She shooes a patients bickering family out of his room. He appears to have had a stroke and can't speak. She asks him to smile. He doesn't. She asks him to lift both arms. He manages one. She asks him to talk, but he can't. A hussy-looking woman comes in the ER for her third pregnancy test in four months. When she says she doesn't have the $15 for a test from a pharmacy, Jackie gives her a $20 and tells her not to clog up her waiting room.

A 10-year-old girl brings her wheezing mother in. Mom has Lupus. The daughter wants to go with her, but Mrs. Akalitis won't allow it because she's too young. Jackie calls her husband, worried about Grace. When he says I love you, Eddie walks around the corner and she answers ""Me too.""

Mrs. Akalitus leaves the girl at the nurse's station. She's studying for her spelling test. Jackie asks permission to look through her notebook. It's a careful log of her mom's blood pressure. She admits her grandmother isn't really coming, it's just her.

Jackie takes her to see her mom. When Cooper objects she starts in on him, telling him the 10-year-old is the caregiver. He reaches out a Tourette's hand to go for her chest but she fends him off and calls him a freak before leaving.

Cooper stops Eddie at the newsstand, trying to talk motorcycles with him. Then he informs Eddie he'll be having Quiznos with him later.

Jackie and Mo Mo share the coffee his stalker Thor brought him. He tells Jackie she needs love in her life and he's going to set her up.

Jackie tends to the stroke patient, whose family doesn't listen to her suggestions of how to deal with a stroke patient, shouting over each other.

O'Hara comes to get Jackie for dinner, but she says she can't. Zoey volunteers. O'Hara agrees. ""That's how easily you're replaced,"" she tells Jackie.

Zoey sits in her bunny scrubs in a very fancy restaurant, excited to be there. When a snooty diner looks at her funny, Elenor says ""Make-A-Wish foundation."" Out of nowhere, Zoey tells O'Hara she thinks it's interesting how she uses humor to mask her real emotions. O'Hara calls for the next subject. ""My dad's in prison for manslaughter,"" Zoey says. ""Fabulous!"" says Elenor, ""Go.""

Jackie visits Eddie for their scheduled sex time, but is surprised to see Cooper there with him. She turns and leaves. Cooper tells Eddie he grabbed her boob once and she was cool with it. He tells him about his physical stutter. When Eddie laughs and says Cooper is full of s---, Cooper just laughs.

Jackie walks by Thor and tells him Mo Mo wants a slice of pepperoni pizza and a donut.

Jackie visits the 10-year-old and her mom, who is doing much better.

Jackie drops back to see Eddie, loading up on pills for the young girl. She gives them to her and wishes her luck on her spelling test that she was using flash cards to study for.

Back at her station, Jackie makes some flash cards. The stroke victim's wife craps on the idea, but Jackie hands two to him. She reads them: ""Shut the f--- up. Seriously.""

Mrs. A finds a Taser lying in the hallway. She shouts at anyone listening about how dangerous it is. Then she walks into the elevator, hits a button and falls to the floor, zapped. Thor pushes the elevator button. When the doors open he takes one look at her and says: ""Taser? Been there, sister. Fifteen minutes, you're good as new.""

Jackie complains to Mo Mo that he ate her pizza and her donut. Jackie sees some shoes sticking out from under a sheet. She calls out Mrs. A, who reveals herself. As she tells Jackie these things wouldn't happen if they all took pride in their workplace, they watch Thor chasing a patient with his bootie hanging out the back of his open gown. Zoey drops him with a well-placed clothesline arm. Mrs. A tells Jackie she might be what Jackie thinks she is but she's been f---ing the system for 30 years. There isn't a move she hasn't seen. We'll see, Jackie says.

Out on the street, Jackie sees Eddie talking to Cooper. She stops walking. When her husband calls she answers and walks the other way.

At home, he tells Jackie that Grace had a breakdown. Jackie says OK, giving in. She looks at the stormy drawing of Florida. Her purse rings. It's the 10-year-old. Her mom can't really move her arm. She tells her to give her mom half a Percocet with a little bit of juice as she does the same for herself."

Grace has heard that the nuns whack knuckles there, she's not too thrilled.

Off to work, where Jackie is greeted by a hacking patient. Paula has lung cancer and is smoking. She knows she shouldn't. ""It'll kill me,"" she cacjles. She used to work there with Jackie. She was just told she's out of options and should check into hospice. But she wants to go out a little sooner rather than later, ""with a shred of dignity in tact...with a little help from my friends.""

She waits for Jackie to figure out what she means.

Jackie wheels Paula around where she harasses Mo Mo and asks if bed five is still doing its magic, killing people frequently.

She tells Mrs. Akalitis she wants her to know she doesn't hold her years of crappy treatment against her. Mrs. Akalitis offers to help expedite things in hospice, even if it means she has to pull someone else's plug.

Jackie looks at Paula's chest x-rays with O'Hara, explaining they worked together for 15 years. O'Hara asks if she's going to help Paula. Paula would do it for her, Jackie says. O'Hara offers to help but Jackie turns it down.

O'Hara leaves and Zoey comes in, lurking briefly. Then she excuses herself, realizing she's intruding on a private moment.

Jackie's cell rings. It's her youngest, Fiona. She's supposed to be asleep, but is wearing her sunflower costume as her pajamas. Pondering a dying woman's cancer, Jackie's happy to hear from her.

Jackie goes back to contemplating the x-ray.

Dr. Cooper greets a patient on a gurney. It's his mother (Blythe Danner). The paramedics think it could be her gallbladder. His mom tells him Lilly insisted they come to his hospital. He says he can't treat her as a matter of medical ethics, so O'Hara pokes her instead. Lilly (Swoozie Kurtz) comes in. O'Hara takes note as Cooper also calls her mom. He has two mommies.

Jackie tends to Paula on her floor. Zoey asks if she should be going up to hospice. Paula informs her she's not going there. ""Like I need more sad s--- in my life.""

A patient is wheeled in next to Paula. Jackie recognizes him as Cat Ball Guy, the dude whose cat clawed his scrotum. This time his fingers are bloody and bandaged. The cat flipped the switch on the garbage disposal while he was fishing for a fork.

Paula hears his nom de ER and guesses precisely what happened to him. When she worked there, she says, a guy came in with one ball in a baggie.

Jackie draws Paula's curtains.

In the bathroom she fills a syringe with morphine as O'Hara guards the door. Zoey scurries in, sees O'Hara and scurries back out.

O'Hara tends to Cooper's mom. She needs surgery and wants Cooper to assist in the ""opening of my abdominal wall."" O'Hara agrees, as long as he doesn't touch anything.

Cut to surgery, where they remove her gallbladder. Cooper asks if they can keep it. But then her machines start beeping -- her blood pressure is dropping. Cooper handles the crisis by grabbing ahold of O'Hara's boob. She pauses, waiting for him to unclench. When he does, she says ""that's a good boy"" and goes about saving his mother.

Out at the desk, Zoey approaches O'Hara with her best professional voice, asking for a moment of her time. She senses Jackie is going through something and she thinks as her protégé it's her duty to support her. O'Hara tells Zoey her instincts are spot on. O'Hara listens pseudo-receptively, enjoying Zoey, as Jackie listens behind her. Zoey goes on, saying that she thinks because they're both nurses ""in the trenches together"" Jackie should know she's there to support her.

O'Hara tells her what Jackie needs right now is mountains of hugs, even if she tries to run. Jackie smiles to herself behind her. Then Zoey turns and Jackie says ""Boo!""

Mo Mo rubs Paula's feet. She gives him her old subway tokens. Fishing through her purse she finds her apartment keys and wonders who to give them to.

Mrs. Akalitis walks up, wanting to know what Paula's still doing there. Paula fishes in her purse for something for her and comes up flipping Mrs. Akalitis the bird.

At his mom's bedside, Cooper chats with his other mom Lilly about how hard his Tourette's was for him as a kid. He changed his name from Shinehorn. He tells Lilly he loves her more because she taught him how to drive a stick-shift and took him to Duran Duran concerts. But she says that's because his other mom wanted them to bond. She wakes up, asking where the ""little f---er"" is. Her gallbladder is sitting in a jar by her bed.

""For all the pain, it sure as hell doesn't look like much,"" she says, then adding that's the exact same thing she said when they cut the cord and put Cooper in her arms.

Jackie preps her morphine syringe then waits as life in the ER goes by.

At Paula's bedside, O'Hara explains about Cooper's boob grab and two moms. Eddie comes to pay his respects. When he leaves, Paula tells them he was her pipeline for Percocet after she had her hysterectomy. Jackie tries to act as if this doesn't bother her at all and suggests going for ice. Instead, Paula tells her it's time. Jackie preps the morphine in the bathroom stall then lays out her 16 granules to snort.

Zoey visits Eddie in the pharmacy. She tells him she thinks the nurses are planning something for Paula. Eddie looks unconcerned. She says she's not sure she can participate in what they're planning. He tells her not to then. But she worries they won't respect her if she doesn't partake in the ""right of passage.""

He asks if she thinks this sort of thing happens all the time, because he's never seen it happen. He tells her it's a crap day for a lot of good people and no matter what she does, no one's going to judge her one way or the other.

Jackie squirts morphine into Paula's champagne. Mo Mo and other nurses gather around her bed, glasses raised. Zoey steps in, saying she wants to be there.

Paula raises a glass to herself. ""Here's to you and here's to me. And if we ever disagree f--- you. And here's to me.""

She chugs. Then she asks Jackie for a priest. She interrupts a priest doing last rites for a patient. Checking the patient's pulse she says he's got 10 minutes and she just needs the priest for five.

After the priest blesses Paula and leaves, Jackie repeats Paula's last words. The nurses all giggle. Then Mrs. Akalitis pulls back the curtain, telling them if there's anything funny with Paula's IV, she'll have their asses.

Jackie goes to Paula's apartment. It's filled with boxes, waiting for the end."

Jackie notices O'Hara has on two different shoes and wonders if everything's OK. Eddie pages Jackie.

In the ER, they work on a guy with multiple stab wounds and a knife sticking out of him.

Mo Mo works on Mrs. Akalitus to buy something to help them lift heavy patients. She says no, then wonders who the baby on the counter belongs to.

Cooper comes in to check out the stab wound guy. O'Hara lets him stay. Jackie has Zoey hold gauze over a wound. When Zoey says she's capable of doing more important things Jackie tells her to move her hand. Blood spurts. ""See? That's important,"" Jackie says.

With Cooper in place, O'Hara abruptly announces she has to leave.

Zoey really wants to take the knife out of the guy's chest. Jackie explains you never remove a foreign object, the surgeons do that. ""But it's so tempting,"" Zoey says.

Jackie finally goes to see Eddie. He texted her six times last night. He has something for her. ""I got you a little something extra today, above the standard fare,"" he says. He hands her a jewelry box.

He wishes her a happy anniversary. She's confused, it's not March.

Now he's confused (she's clearly citing the wrong anniversary). She covers by saying she's just tired. It's been a year.

She won't try on the bracelet. He says he gets it. ""It's a stupid f---- bracelet from the guy you're banging. Too bad it's not Vicodin.""

He mocks her repeated requests for pills and says everything's always on her terms. She gives back the bracelet, saying she doesn't need any of it. Neither does he.

Jackie walks down the hall to find Zoey with a police officer, outside the room of a sex offender who was messing with 3rd graders. His testicles were swollen so a doctor ordered a catheter. Zoey tried to get it out, but couldn't. Jackie checks with Zoey to ask if she deflated the balloon at the end. She didn't.

Jackie calmly walks over to the man, telling him he'll feel a little pressure. Then she promptly yanks the thing out sharply as the man howls in pain.

Mo Mo hauls her outside, saying he doesn't want her to get in trouble. She rationalizes that the man is a pedophile, then explains that she had a fight her man, uh, male, gentleman, uh, boyfriend. He didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

Outside, ""God"" yells down at everyone.

Cooper eats in Eddie's pharmacy, suggesting they go to Atlantic City. He opens the jewelry box. Cooper says it's unisex and tries it on. He says he bought a Cartier watch two days after graduating from med school but he was robbed at gunpoint. Eddie says he doesn't really feel like talking, and if Cooper likes the bracelet so much, he can have it.

O'Hara walks by Jackie in the hall. She's out of sorts and asks Jackie to check on steak knife's people. Jackie tells the woman he was on a date with whose ex-husband stabbed him that he's in the ICU with stitches. The woman says he was a great guy after a string of jerks and it was their first date. ""He's not going to call me, is he?"" she asks Jackie.

Mrs. Akalitis walks around with the baby in her arms, asking whose baby it is.

Jackie sees Mo Mo talking to an upset Zoey. ""God"" told her her hair is thinning. Jackie tells Zoey to stop going outside.

In her office, O'Hara tells someone on her cell phone to please never call her. Jackie knocks on the door and comes in. Jackie tells O'Hara about Eddie and the bracelet and Cooper now wearing it. Jackie asks if she wants to tell her what's up. O'Hara pops a Xanax and says it'd take a bucket of Scotch to get it out of her. She offers Jackie a pill. Jackie says she would like one, yea. ""Is that bad?"" But she's a lightweight, she says as she palms six or seven pills. O'Hara splits one for her as she shoves the rest in her pocket.

Out in the hallway, Jackie takes another. She walks by Eddie's window and says she's sorry. She goes inside. They make up. He asks if she still wants the bracelet. She says sure.

In the hallway, Eddie mock robs Cooper, telling him to put his hands up and give him all his jewelry. Cooper hands it over.

Mrs. Akalitis continues to walk around with the baby in her arms, asking who he belongs to. Finally, she decides to call social services.

Jackie checks on Zach the stabbing victim. She tells him his date is waiting for him. But he wants someone with a clean slate and no problems. Jackie ups his morphine then starts talking about his date again, saying maybe everything after this will be a piece of cake. She pulls out Eddie's Cartier love bracelet, saying she found it on the subway and she thinks his date will love it.

Jackie goes to get the date, giving her a wipe to get the junk food off her face.

O'Hara walks in and closes the door behind her. She's envious that Jackie's going home to a family and she'll be going home to nothing. Jackie invites her over, saying she could stay in Fiona's room. ""Actually,"" O'Hara says, ""I prefer Grace's.""

God shouts down at them as they head for O'Hara's town car. Jackie shouts up at him, telling him to leave her nurses alone, to pick on criminals and white guys. He asks who her friend in the heels is, now that's a woman. Jackie shouts at him to get back on his meds. He apologizes and shouts down the time.

At her kitchen table, Jackie and Kevin listen as O'Hara wraps up her tale of woe, which apparently involves her step-father, a criminal.

The next morning a very hungover O'Hara waits for her coffee as served by Fiona. She notices an electric bill on the counter and stuffs it in her purse.

Grace comes in showing off her new uniform. O'Hara says it lacks a French braid and sets about remedying the problem. Kevin doesn't seem to be a fan of fancy O'Hara. He notices the bill is missing. Grace worries because her dad bought the wrong color bike shorts and God (the Deity, not the mental patient) might see them.

The kids and Kevin say good bye across the subway platform as Jackie shoves a pill in her mouth.

Mrs. Akalitis introduces Jackie to a temp Sam, who's trying to take insurance information from a patient with three wallets who was hit by a car and has a head would. Sam doesn't appear too swift, so Jackie takes over.

Jackie tells Zoey she's going to be on her own today and she needs to do better than last time when she gave a pill seeker six percocet for a non-existent broken finger. Zoey doesn't think she can be fooled this time, she watched a show last night that taught her how to read drug use by flashing a light in someone's eyes.

Jackie assess the waiting room asking who there is in so much pain they can't raise their arm. Those that do go to the bottom of the list. For everybody else it's a three hour wait. A few people leave, Jackie figures they're drug seekers.

A guy comes in with a clearly busted hand, bleeding. As she takes him in back Zoey announces that this is the kind of thing they're talking about.

Cooper looks over the head wound woman. After he leaves, Jackie has her sit up and the woman's clearly in pain. She didn't tell Cooper because she didn't want to disturb him.

Mrs. Akalitis goes back to her office, where the unclaimed abandoned baby is still hanging out.

Mo Mo brings head wound woman's other daughter back to see her. She wants her daughter Melissa to meet Cooper when he comes back.

Jackie tries to decipher the temp's notes, which are vague at best. She sees him sitting nearby texting, not responding to a persistent beep. She takes him over to the nearby patient whose machine has been beeping for half an hour. Jackie asks the patient if Sam has checked on him recently. He hasn't. The patient asked for a glass of water for his pills, but got nothing. Mo Mo tells Jackie that CAT scan paged Cooper six times about Mrs. Greenfield, the head wound woman, but he hasn't responded. Jackie tells the ignored patient that if he doesn't get everything he needs in the next five minutes Sam will give him $50. She gives the patient a watch to time him.

Zoey examines an enormous man in pain, treating him as if he's not really hurt. She tries to get tough with him, asking him why he's really there, but Mo Mo comes in with his x-rays. He has a fractured fibula and needs some Vicodin.

Jackie sees Thor on his way out and forbids him from leaving. She convinces Mrs. A to take her paperwork so she can grab some food but immediately runs into Cooper. He wants to know why everyone's looking for him and she yells at him to try answering his pager. As she yells, he snaps a rubber band on his wrist, a new technique he's trying for the inappropriate sexual touching.

Jackie's cell phone rings. It's Grace, calling from her new school, saying she can't breathe, it's an emergency. Cooper comes back, indignant and fired up, and starts shouting at Jackie that she can't talk to him like that. Jackie tries to calm her freaked out child while fending off the freaked out childish doctor. She finally shouts at him to shut up, she's talking to her kid. That news shuts him up.

After she gets off the phone with Grace she tracks him down, making a limp plea to keep her private life private. He says he won't tell anyone but she doesn't believe him. In his defense he says that her life isn't that interesting, he's a doctor and he doesn't care.

Jackie calls her husband to tell him about their daughter's panic attack.

Zoey rolls the enormous man down the hallway and accidentally goes over incompetent Sam's foot. She apologizes profusely, but he didn't notice. Zoey is suspicious. She tries her new light-in-the-eyes technique to check for drug use. He's glassy eyed.

Jackie grabs lunch with O'Hara, there on her day off. O'Hara lights up. She's not allowed to smoke in there, but they're too afraid to tell her not to. Jackie tells her about Grace's panicked call. O'Hara thinks Jackie sounds a bit angry at her as well. And then Cooper found out she has a kid.

Cut to Cooper telling Eddie that Grace has a kid.

Then back to Jackie smoking profusely in the restaurant. A waiter comes over to tell her not to, but sees O'Hara and tells her to smoke away.

Eddie tells Cooper to keep Jackie's news to himself and not be one of those doctors who spreads rumors about nurses.

Cut to slow-mo pill granules bouncing on a counter and Jackie going in for a snort in the bathroom. Then Zoey busts, but doesn't seem to see anything.

As they wash their hands later, Zoey tells Jackie she thinks the temp is on something. Jackie tells her you never rat on a fellow nurse unless you're sure. She lays out the evidence. Jackie says OK, nice catch.

Cut to Jackie watching the temp make a bed but enjoying the feel of the sheets way too much. She's on it.

Jackie and Cooper check on Mrs. Greenfield, who is more interested in introducing her younger daughter to Cooper than whatever is going on with her. The older daughter Amy interrupts the flirting to ask what's going on with her mom. She needs exploratory surgery for a mass.

Mrs. Greenfield tells Amy to chill out and the frustrated daughter steps outside the curtain. Jackie goes to talk to her, giving her advice on who to see in oncology and how to fill out the insurance forms to save haggling.

Then later in the hallway Cooper stops Amy, telling her she seems like a no nonsense kind of girl and asking if she thinks her sister would go out with him.

Jackie tells Sam the stoned temp he has two choices. He can leave now or go up to employee services and pee in a cup. Either way, she doesn't want to see him again. As she's walking away he says ""it takes one to know one."" She asks him to repeat what he said but he walks away.

Jackie drops by Eddie, exhausted. He asks how her kid is. She apologizes and asks if he wants to get coffee. He says it's fine, she can explain when she's ready. He asks if there's anything else he should know about, was she a cat burglar by night? She responds ""My life's not that interesting.""

At his bar, Jackie and her husband look over their daughter and think she looks fine now. Jackie's name is called to the open mike. She resists, but relents when Kevin tells her Grace put her name in. She sings James Taylor's ""Up on the Roof"" and watches as her daughter smiles. Then the smile fades and she recedes back into her world of worry."

They think she's doing better.

They sit and eat lunch. Grace worries about the germs. Jackie gives them both money to buy candy. Grace offers her mom the money back if she doesn't go to work. She wants the hospital to burn down. Jackie goes to the bathroom and snorts her pills. When she comes back she tells Kevin she's not going to work. He tells her the world won't fall apart every time Grace gets upset. He'll be with her, it'll be fine.

Jackie kisses her good bye and leaves.

Walking into the hospital, she waves at a homeless man she knows. She watches as he collapses on the street. She goes to help him and notices blood. It's coming from her nose.

Thor and Mo Mo read the obits. Thor reads a name and Mo Mo tries to guess their age based on their name. It's fun til they get to a 10-year-old boy named Quentin. Jackie comes in and briefs them on Mr. Everett, the homeless diabetic.

Jackie supervises as Zoey checks his head for signs of a stroke. His toes are gangrenous. O'Hara checks his toes and says he's going to lose one. Mrs. A drops by to say All Saints is a hospital, not a shelter.

Back in her office, Mrs. A hangs with the unclaimed baby and grooves to Billie Holiday.

Back downstairs, Cooper accepts a bag lunch from Melissa Greenfield, the hot daughter from last week. Jackie walks around the corner and he calls her over. Jackie remembers Melissa and her mom but it's pretty clear Cooper's iffy on the details of her mom, his patient.

In the ER, paramedics bring in a stoned kid who's brain dead from a car accident. Jackie wonders where Cooper is as they prepare to call for a transplant team. Jackie goes through the kid's pockets, announcing she found the organ donation card when she finds a PETA membership.

Mrs. A comes for Mo Mo, very serious and businesslike. In her office, Mrs. A peppers him with questions, the purpose of which isn't entirely clear. She checks that he's gay, notes that she's not and asks if he has friends with kids. She wants to know how his friends adopted. He says he'll find out. She would appreciate that. She shoos him away.

Jackie asks Mo Mo where Cooper is. He's nowhere to be found and is ignoring his pager. In the waiting room, a snooty looking woman calls Jackie ""nurse"" and asks her when someone will see her kids. Her two young boys have lice. Jackie checks her address and asks why she's not at her neighborhood hospital, or pediatrician's. She could deal with it at home, Jackie points out. But her pediatrician is a family friend.

Mo Mo tells Jackie the brain dead pot kids' parents oppose organ donation.

As Jackie scrubs the kids heads their mom harangues them for sharing helmets with kids at school. Jackie tells them she thinks it's nice they share. She tells them they'll have to wash their head again tomorrow. Their mom asks if they can't just do it all here. She really doesn't want to touch them, she explains.

Jackie calls a pharmacy to get the lice shampoo, half a dozen boxes sent to the woman in no bag.

A man from children's services tells Mrs. A they found the parents. They stepped forward. She doesn't want to hand him over, not just because they named him Dalton.

Jackie and Eddie lay on his cot and he closes by suggesting he meet her kid.

Zoey tells Jackie if Mr. Everett had had his foot looked at last time, he wouldn't have lost it. Jackie insists she told her to have a doctor look at it. Zoey consults her notebook of things Jackie has said, including a quote in which she dismisses Mr. Everett. Jackie is unmoved. She asks where Cooper is. The transplant people need him to sign something. He's in exam room 3, with the door locked.

Cut to Cooper making out with Melissa the lunch bringer. Jackie knocks on the door, then shoves the door open to find Cooper with his pants down and shirt unbuttoned. He says no one told him. She picks up his pager and then tells him he's useless.

Jackie walks out and tells the transplant team that she saw Cooper certify brain death, she's not sure of the time, but that's good enough.

Jackie sits in church, then snorts half a pill. Her nostril starts to bleed.

She goes to see O'Hara. O'Hara is worried about her, amazed she can juggle a husband and a boyfriend. Her sister in Paris is doing the same thing, but wracked with guilt. Jackie isn't pleased O'Hara talked to her sister about her. O'Hara says she didn't use her name and, by the way, she's in Paris. Plus, she thinks of Jackie as a sister. ""Think again,"" Jackie says to a stunned O'Hara.

A policeman leads the parents who abandoned their son into Mrs. Akalitis' office. He's staying, he's the grandfather. The father says they made a mistake. The mom says they haven't any fun in a year. Mrs. A says she has some bad news: their baby is dead. They start to cry and Mrs. A relents. He's not dead. She pulls him in his baby seat out from behind her desk.

She tells them not to be stupid with him. Mrs. A holds him and is reluctant to let go when the mom reaches for him.

Jackie sits at the intake desk. She sees Zoey's notebook of quotes nearby. She thumbs through it and sees the page that says Jackie told her not to call a doctor for Mr. Everett. She tears it out.

Jackie stops by the lounge and sees people dancing on TV. She calls Grace and suggests they do something, just the two of them, like a cooking or dance class. Grace thinks it's a great idea."

Jackie introduces her daughter to her old high school friend Mrs. Flynn. Her daughter whispers something to Grace. Mom invites them to donuts, but Jackie has to go to work.

Walking home, Grace asks her daughter if she feels like telling her what the kid whispered. She said her mom was her dad's girlfriend before Jackie. Jackie laughs it off.

At work, Mo-Mo and Jackie try to figure out what day it is. She says mother-daughter tap is Saturday. He thinks she means she takes tap with her mom.

O'Hara walks by and ignores them both.

Jackie quietly rags on her, but follows when O'Hara asks for a minute.

O'Hara apologizes to Jackie with chocolate and magazines, telling her she's there when Jackie's done freezing her out. Jackie melts, and O'Hara reminds her to take off her wedding ring. Jackie tucks her arms in her pits just in time for Eddie to walk by. Zoey tells her a cardiac arrest is on the way.

In the bathroom, Jackie fights with her ring but can't get it off.

Paramedics bring in the heart attack. He's been down for 30 minutes. They perform CPR as his cell phone rings. Jackie quietly asks Mo-Mo if he saw a ring on her finger earlier. He says no and asks if she lost one.

The patient's cell phone keeps ringing. They can't revive him. Jackie goes through his bag. He rented ""Marley & Me"" and bought razors. He has a to do list and things to be mailed. Jackie checks his texts. Someone getting increasingly worried, then ending with a ""you suck."" She dials the number and leaves a message, telling whoever it is to come to the ER, where Chris is in a critical situation.

Jackie snorts two lines of pill powder in the bathroom and tries again, unsuccessfully, to get her ring off her finger.

Jackie sees Melissa, Cooper's girlfriend in the hall. She has flowers not for her sick mom, but for Cooper. Cooper strolls in and asks to talk to Jackie. Medical records is hassling him about a donor he didn't certify (the one she lied about him certifying last week).

She tells him not to worry about it. Cooper's worried that if the family makes a fuss he could be in serious trouble. He tells Jackie he'll turn on her so fast it'll make her head spin.

She calmly tells him to cool down, he doesn't want to scare his girlfriend.

She walks away and picks up a hammer that's lying around. She takes it into a bathroom stall where she uses it to crush a pill. She walks down the hall, super bright-eyed. She's wearing latex gloves when she walks by Eddie.

She goes to O'Hara for a favor. Cut to O'Hara holding a surgical saw and questioning Jackie's judgment as she prepares to cut off her wedding ring. She'll figure out what to tell her husband later.

But O'Hara can't cut because hopped up Jackie is shaking too much.

Jackie tells her about angry Cooper and that she cut some corners on a transplant. O'Hara asks if she did anything illegal and Jackie freely confesses. She's not worried that she could be fired. What she can't live with is Cooper holding it over her head.

O'Hara is sure Jackie knows how to mess with him.

O'Hara goes through with the ring procedure.

Cooper brings his flowers from Melissa to Eddie, citing allergies. Jackie comes in, asking for a moment with Cooper. As Eddie leaves them alone, Cooper tells Eddie she'll keep him away from the good stuff.

Jackie tells him he wasn't there for the donor. He says he's qualified, she's not, New York law says that. Either way, that's insulting, she says. And for him to threaten her was unconscionable. She gets most of the way through chewing him out when he grabs her boob. She very calmly tells him not to panic, that she needs to be able to trust him and vice versa. It's been a crappy day and he handled the cardiac arrest that morning very well. With her hand over his on her boob Jackie leans in and kisses him reassuringly.

Cut to Jackie furiously brushing her teeth. Zoey tells her no one has come yet for the cardiac arrest. She hopes he didn't have kids. It's always worse when kids are involved, she tells Jackie.

Jackie visits the pharmacy, to find it under construction. Eddie's in the back, stoned on Valium. She climbs on top of him. Zoey goes looking for Jackie. Apparently she left the door unlocked. She walks in on Jackie on top of Eddie. She screams and runs out. Then Jackie calls her back in and she shields her eyes. Finally Jackie runs her off.

After she leaves, Jackie asks Eddie whether she should laugh or cry. Laugh, he decides.

At the bedside of a Hispanic priest, Zoey tells Jackie she thinks she and Eddie are a cute couple. Jackie tells Zoey that she will have no problem killing her in front of the priest.

Later, Jackie tells her not to share what she saw with anyone. Zoey says she has no judgment, she went to second base with her manager at Burger King.

Jackie tells O'Hara what Zoey saw and that she kissed Cooper. O'Hara responds by horse laughing.

Mo-Mo and Jackie lay in the chapel. He asks if she ever found her ring. He wants to find it, so he will have done one good thing today. She says no as she holds it in her hands.

Jackie takes the hammer into the bathroom. She sits on the floor and puts her hand down. Then she whacks her ring finger with the hammer.

O'Hara is gone, so Cooper splints it for her. She apologizes for being mean that morning. She says he's not a bad guy. That's what he's been trying to tell her.

Jackie goes through the cardiac arrest guy's things. She takes out the letters and bills, then goes into her own purse for stamps and mails them. Outside the hospital, she leans against the building and practices her tap moves.

Jackie goes to tap class with Grace. Another mom mentions how much she loves babies, but Jackie doesn't at all. Jackie gets protective of Grace as other mom's daughter keeps bumping into her doing the steps. Her mom defends her, saying that if Grace isn't doing the steps right, she's going to get run into.

At the jewelers, a guy examines Jackie's sawed ring. Kevin's thinking of adding a diamond. Fiona likes the two-carat one, but Kevin's looking for less than one-carat. He says Jackie's not that fancy. Fiona picks out a sparkly one.

Back in tap class, Jackie and the mom continue to get into it, especially after the daughter says it looks like Grace didn't practice. A mortified Grace tries to shush her mother as Jackie gets more upset, but it doesn't work. Jackie ends up shouting f--- you to the other mom as she takes Grace and storms out of the class.

At the hospital, the staff gets a tutorial on the Pill-o-Matix which is half the price of the previously announced Pyxis.

Zoey asks Jackie what she did to her finger. Jackie says she smashed it with a hammer. Zoey says that's okay, she doesn't have to tell her.

Zoey says she thinks it's inappropriate to have the tutorial in front of Eddie, who's being replaced by the machine.

Mo Mo asks Mrs. Akalitis how she sleeps at night putting him out of a job. She replies that she employed Eddie 10 years earlier.

Later, Jackie talks to Eddie in the hall. He kisses her broken finger and says he's going to miss seeing her every day. He has a going away present for her, 80 milligram tabs of oxy. He says he loves her. ""Love you more,"" she replies, perfunctorily.

As he stitches a patient's finger, Cooper asks Zoey about Jackie. He wants to know what she likes. Zoey says gum and coffee. Eddie drops by to return Cooper's pager, which he left on his desk.

After Eddie leaves, Cooper asks if Jackie has a boyfriend. Zoey says she thinks so.

Cooper's girl Melissa drops by.

Jackie tells O'Hara about leaving tap class. She says O'Hara doesn't want to know what happened to her finger.

Outside, Cooper breaks up with Melissa, saying it's not her, she's even his type. ""I've dated like 100 of you,"" he says. He tells her he kissed someone else and felt something he never felt.

Melissa says he can see other people. He says it's a focus thing.

She says if she walks away she's not coming back. He lets her walk away.

Smoking nearby, Jackie and O'Hara have a good view of the break up. Cooper turns and sees Jackie. He grins like an idiot and waves at her. O'Hara busts up laughing.

Later, Cooper brings Jackie flowers.

""No,"" she says.

""Yes,"" he says.

A patient is brought in with a broken arm. It's a local TV film critic (Victor Garber). O'Hara looks him over. Jackie asks how he got hurt. He was working on his laptop and tried to cross 2nd Avenue at the same time.

She asks him how he could call Hotel for Dogs the worst movie of the year, and why he insinuates that people are stupid for liking what they like.

He reminds her she just insinuated he was stupid for walking and typing at the same time. Jackie offers him to Zoey. She'll take him.

Jackie returns Cooper's flowers and his gum, with another ""no."" He mentions the kiss. She tells him not to ever buy her anything again.

Mrs. Akalitis tells Eddie she's trying to find him another pharmacy and to hang in there.

The critic asks for more pain medication. Zoey offers him water instead. He hates water.

Mrs. Akalitis drops by his bed, thanking him for recommending Bicycle Thief. They relate, ""bad guy"" to bad guy. She gently tells him to give Babette's Feast another chance. He says he was in a bad place when he screened that, going through his divorce. Mrs. Akalitis takes note.

Mo Mo talks to a a patient who's pretty sure he has something alive in his ear. He asks if the guy has any cockroaches where he lives.

Mo Mo takes a look and lets out an ""oh my God!"" He says it's because he's relieved that there's no cockroach, and then he runs for help.

He goes in the hall, totally freaked out and whispers ""spider.""

Jackie watches O'Hara shop. Jackie brings up the tap class and O'Hara accuses her of dwelling. She says she should beware any class that touts the mother-daughter relationship as ""carefree.""

Jackie calls her bitter, saying it's not like her mother ran off with her boyfriend and married him on her 25th birthday. Ouch. Sore subject for O'Hara, who this apparently happened to.

O'Hara talks about her wicked step-mother as she finds a shirt on the rack that she likes. She takes her shirt off in the middle of the store to try it on as an embarrassed Jackie attempts to cover O'Hara's immodesty who is then distracted by nearby spring knits.

Mo Mo revists spider-ear guy with two nurses as back-up. They're planning to flush the sucker out. And know spider-ear guy knows he's got a spider in his ear. Mo Mo squirts liquid in and the patient tips his head. A very large spider falls into the bedpan Mo Mo's holding.

""Down came the rain and washed the spider out,"" Thor announces.

Mo Mo flings down the bedpan. The patient says ""uh oh."" He thinks he feels something in the other ear.

Jackie finds Cooper's flowers have returned. She puts them in the trash.

Zoey asks Jackie if she can give the critic something more for the pain. Jackie checks that he last had something five hours ago and tells Zoey to give him 50 micrograms of something.

At his bedside, Jackie argues Kevin Costner's value as Zoey injects his pain meds. Almost immediately, he's not able to talk and then he can't breathe.

O'Hara comes over and asks what they gave him. She checks that it wasn't codine, which he's allergic to. It wasn't. Then she checks the dosage. Zoey says 50, but Jackie checks the vial and it was 250. O'Hara's ready to yell at her, but Jackie tells Zoey to leave.

Jackie finds Zoey sobbing in the bathroom. She tells her she's off the floor. She can answer phones, but that's about it. Mrs. Akalitis storms in, angry, and orders Zoey to her office. Alone in the bathroom, Jackie takes some pills out of her pocket and chews them.

At a diner, Zoey laments putting the film critic in a coma. She says every morning when she wakes up, she hopes that she won't kill someone that day.

Thor agrees it's good to have goals.

""The only thing I want to do besides help people is not kill them,"" Zoey says.

Mo Mo says they all make mistakes.

Thor offers that he shaved a woman's pubic hair before she got her tonsils out.

Mo Mo missed an aneurysm on his 14th day.

They counsel Zoey that she gets through this, she'll be a better nurse.

She worries no one will trust her again. And then she suddenly realizes Thor (who she has had a mild crush on) is gay. ""I just got that,"" she says, thanking Mo Mo for the heads up.

Jackie finds Eddie in the pharmacy. He found something on line he wants to show her. He unplugs the machine and shows her that it resets. And that includes the memory, so if you unplug it, you can get anything you want without whatever it dispenses being logged against the operator the new system can be beaten.

Jackie tells him it's killing her to see him go. He says it'll be fine. He can meet her kid, she can meet his mom they start making out.

Back at her desk, Jackie takes a few of Cooper's flowers out of the trash.

She finds Grace and Fiona at the bar and gives them each a rose. Grace isn't speaking to her. Her husband tells her Grace will come around. She hugs him and gives him a big kiss.

He reassures her that she hasn't damaged their daughter by getting her kicked out of tap class, then announces that he's got a surprise for her when she gets off work. His sister is taking the girls and she has to meet him at the bar.

Jackie says, Who is luckier than me? She leaves.

Eddie waits outside. He walks in when she leaves. Kevin's not open yet, but he invites the stranger to sit down.

Mrs. Akalitus talks to the movie critic Nutterman (Victor Garber) in a coma, saying she hates movies where idiots talk to people in comas. She says they'll talk more when he wakes up.

Zoey, who put him in the coma with the wrong dose of pain meds, watches.

Jackie gets some Tylenol from the faux Pill-o-Matix, and lets it know how she feels about it.

Mrs. Akalitus tells Jackie she's initiating an investigation into the Nutterman coma, and needs an official statement. She wants Jackie and Zoey in her office in five minutes.

Mrs. Akalitus steps into the elevator, which promptly goes on the fritz, trapping her in it.

""Thank you, Jesus!"" Jackie murmurs.

Zoey stands at the comatose critic's bedside and apologizes to him. Jackie answers phones, and calls her over.

From inside the elevator, Mrs. Akalitus tries to get some attention. She calls the nurses station where Zoey promptly puts her on hold.

Zoey is wearing drab scrubs instead of her usual bunnies. Jackie asks about it. She says she's wearing them as a sign of remorse.

Mrs. Akalitus calls again. Zoey listens for several seconds, then hangs up on the increasingly frustrated administrator.

Jackie asks who it was. Mrs. Akalitus or not.

Jackie tells her not to bother with the elevator repair.

Zoey hangs up on Mrs. Akalitus a few more times. She yells from inside the elevator.

Dr. Eleanor reports from Nutterman's neuro consult that it went well.

Dr. Cooper stops by, telling Jackie they need to talk. She disagrees.

He leans in and says she broke her own finger. She leaves to talk to him privately.

He thinks she did it so he'd feel sorry for her and let her off the hook about the brain damage test. But, he says as he steps in closer, she didn't count on them having amazing chemistry.

She recaps his version to make sure she understood correctly. Then she calls him a moron, and just to really confuse him, kisses him.

Thor and Mo Mo tell Zoey her new blah scrubs are unflattering. She thinks if Nutterman wakes up and sees her in kiddie scrubs he won't take her seriously. A skinny model-type walks in and they vie to help her. The model-type opens by ranting about an off-the-boat Dominican hairdresser. Then she pulls back her sweatshirt hood to reveal orange hair with a streak of badly singed scalp.

Zoey figures that she had her hair straightened. But she can't tend to her since she's been stripped of her patient-treating powers.

At Kevin's bar, Eddie knocks 'em back. He sees the photo of Jackie and Kevin behind the bar and asks about her.

Eddie says he's seeing someone, but she's married with two kids.

That's a rough road, Kevin says.

Brother, you don't know the half of it, Eddie says to the man whose wife he's sleeping with.

As she performs a reflex test on Nutterman, Eleanor tells Jackie that she's doing something illegal that night around 10 p.m. She's having her comatose mother shipped in from England and she'll need Jackie's help. Legally Eleanor can't admit her, so she needs Jackie to enter her as a ""Jane Doe"" found in a park.

I'm already on the hook for one coma, what's one more? Jackie says.

Nutterman, though, seems to be doing better.

Mo Mo tells Jackie that Mrs. Akalitus called from the elevator again. He asks if he should tell her the repairs guys are there. ""Yep,"" says Jackie.

""Are they?"" He asks.

""Nope,"" says Jackie.

Jackie tells Mo Mo to get the breathing tube out of Nutterman since he seems to be waking up. They hope they'll dodge a lawsuit.

In the elevator, a resigned Mrs. Akalitus passes the time by narrating her own appearance on Letterman, and tales of Nutterman.

In the pharmacy, Jackie tries the unplug-the-machine trick Eddie showed her. She waits for it to reboot. It goes nowhere. She calls Eddie and leaves a message asking him to call. She closes with, ""Love you.""

The paramedics wheel in a guy whose intestines are literally coming out his stomach. One of the paramedics asks Zoey about her coma. He tells her not to worry and not to mea culpa too much with the nuns. He asks her out to get some pizza, but she emphatically says no, like that wouldn't be proper given the coma situation.

Jackie tells her Nutterman will be fine and to go put her happy scrubs on. Zoey tells Jackie she wants to tell Nutterman what she did. Telling him might make her feel better, but it won't make him feel better. It's selfish, she says.

Meanwhile, back in the elevator, Mrs. Akalitus passes more time by slowly unraveling her suit skirt.

Eddie continues to chat up Kevin about Jackie. Eddie says that Jackie working nights must suck. Kevin innocently tells him that no matter how tired Jackie is, when she comes home she rubs his back and makes him eggs for breakfast. Eddie looks like he wants to cry and maybe punch someone.

Cooper treats intestines guy, telling Mo Mo how much he likes someone and is messed up about the situation. Mo Mo laments his own love troubles. Despite the fact several coils of his digestive tract are resting on his belly like links of sausage, intestines guy says he's not in pain.

""You know, my ex-wife used to bitch that I never talked,"" the patient says. ""Look at me now, I'm spilling my guts.""

Cooper and the patient urge Mo Mo to call his guy and make him jealous. Cooper takes Mo Mo's phone.

In the bar, Eddie ignores Jackie calling on his cell. He orders a shot of Jack. Kevin joins in. They toast.

Kevin asks if he can show Eddie something. He takes out Jackie's new diamond ring, telling Eddie he's going to surprise her with it tonight. Kevin lines them up another round.

Eddie again ignores Jackie's call.

At the hospital, Jackie wonders what's up.

Mrs. Akalitus finally gets out of the elevator.

Jackie again tries the fauxPill-o-Matix. She unplugs it as Eddie showed her, but when she plugs it back in an alarm goes off. Jackie flees in panic.

Jackie finds O'Hara waiting for her mother downstairs. She asks if O'Hara has Xanax. Or anything else.

Zoey sulks by and Jackie hounds her again to change her scrubs.

Cooper holds up Mo Mo's phone and kisses him on the lips to snap a picture. Jackie walks by.

Nice rebound, Coop, she says as she keeps walking. Cooper protests, flustered.

Mo Mo guesses she's who Cooper was talking about.

Nutterman wakes up. He sees Zoey standing there in her bright pink and blue scrubs.

""Are those rabbits?""

She tells him she's sorry.

He says he heard her the first time. He repeats back to her the apology she offered while he was in the coma.

Then she says she's not so crazy about Kevin Costner either.

""Do I know him?"" Nutterman says.

She immediately devines that he might be suffering memory loss, asks what won the Oscar for Best Picture last year.

""When was Showgirls? That was a good (!) movie,"" he says.

Zoey rushes out, saying ""Oh my god! I broke him.""

Jackie hears a shouting coming from outside. It's a super drunk Eddie. As everyone's watching, he makes a ruckus until Mrs. Akalitus threatens to call security. He says he's leaving, but first he leans in close to Jackie and hisses that he's met Kevin. ""That's a very nice boy you got.""

He leaves as a frozen Jackie looks stricken.

Mo Mo watches her as she tries to keep it together.

She heads for the bathroom, where she paces in a panic. She checks her pockets for pills and finds none, then leaves.

O'Hara picks up her mother, with no Jackie there. Looking her over, O'Hara starts sobbing silently.

Jackie goes into the pharmacy. She kicks the machine. Then she punches in her code and orders three vials of injectable morphine sulfate. She takes them and goes looking for a private place.

She finds an empty room and shuts the door, taking a deep breath. She sits on the floor, pops the cap off a vial and drinks it down. Then another. Then the third.

She starts to cry a little as the powerful analgesic washes over her.

She relaxes. She lies back on the floor. The voices of Kevin, Eddie, daughter Grace, Gloria Akalitus and everyone run through her head.

She thinks back to the opening scenes, which also found her on the floor. She sings, ""Have you Ever Seen the Rain?"" in her head and sees her picture perfect Grace tapping and Kevin waving like a cardboard husband. She imagines her husband and eldest daughter in front of an obvious '50s house-in-the-suburbs theatrical set.

She sees the shape of a rodent run across the top of the light panel in the ceiling.

""Did anyone else see that?"" she says with lucidity, and the season ends to the powerful voice of John Fogerty and Creedence Clearwater Revival surging over the end credits."

At the start, German Sergeant Schultz, the head guard at the camp, gets the men out of the barracks and starts counting them. When he gets to British Corporal Newkirk, number 4, Newkirk faints and falls into Schultz. While this is going on, American Sergeant Olson runs to the fence, lifts up a portion of the inner fence which acts as a gate, goes to the outer fence, lifts up a portion of the outer fence, and leaves camp. Schultz keeps talking at the prisoners. At one point, Schultz loses his helmet; one of the prisoners grabs it and passes it down the line of prisoners without Schultz seeing it. Schultz eventually gets his helmet back.

Olson, now outside the camp, finds American Lieutenant Carter, who dug his way out of another camp. Olson tells Carter that he will get him into camp.

Schultz, after getting his helmet back, finished the count of the prisoners; there is 1 prisoner missing. Colonel Klink goes to Hogan, talking with him about distracting Schultz for an escape. The 5 dogs in the kennel get let out.

Outside the fence, Olson is with Carter, talks to the dogs like they are friends. He tells the dogs 'Not Yet', and the dogs walk off. The dogs then find Carter, and Carter puts his hands up.

Later, in the barracks, Hogan asks Carter about an individual named McNair, who supposedly was with Carter's old outfit; Carter does not know him. Hogan asks Carter some other questions, to be sure that he is not a spy. While they are talking, Russian prisoner Vladimir, the local tailor, is putting civilian clothes on Carter in preparation for his escape. Hogan tells Newkirk that the football game is off; Vladmir is disappointed as he was going to play fullback. Newkirk then pulls some magic tricks on Carter while he is standing there. Hogan then says that he is short of tenors in the camp glee club. Carter asks Hogan about Olson, what does he do when he is outside; Hogan says that he doesn't know. American Staff Sergeant Kinchloe comes in and says that Klink wants to see Hogan.

Hogan goes to Klink's office. In the outer office, Klink's secretary Helga thanks Hogan for the nylons, giving him a sly smile. Hogan goes into Klink's office, and tosses his hat onto the spike of Klink's pickelhelb, a WW-I type spiked helmet that Klink has on his desk. Klink gets mad and gives Hogan his hat back. Hogan tries to get a cigar from Klink's cigar box on his desk, but Klink objects and locks the box. Klink talks to Hogan about the 'escape' last night. Klink gives Hogan his speech about 'no one escapes from Camp 13'. Hogan asks Klink how many men would he need to guard the prisoners if they stopped trying to escape? He tells Klink that a captain could run the place. Klink asks Hogan which one of his men he has been talking to - Karl, Fritz, Schultz? When Hogan winces at the name 'Schultz', Klink knows he is the one. Klink says that he is from the old Prussian school. Because of the attempted escape, the entire camp will be punished. Hogan asks Klink to look out the window. As he does this, Hogan slips the hinge out of the cigar box, takes come cigars, puts them in his inside pocket, and slips the hinge back. Klink says that there will be no football game today. Hogan puts one of the cigars in his mouth and asks Klink for a light; Klink lights the cigar, and Hogan leaves.

There is another new prisoner, Technical Sergeant Wagner. Hogan asks him about McNair and Ellingsworth; Wagner does not know them. He then asks about Major Campbell; Wagner 'knows' Campbell. Hogan and Wagner laugh about a story regarding Campbell. This marks him as a phony as Campbell is not a real man in his outfit, Hogan was just testing him. Hogan tells Newkirk to pass the word that nobody talks to Wagner.

Kinch sets up the coffee pot in Hogan's office, which is actually a listening device for a bug that has been planted in Klink's office. He says that they have to stop making coffee in that coffee pot. French Corporal LeBeau brings in some food. Hogan, Kinch, Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau are listening in to the conversation in Klink's office. They hear Wagner talking on the phone; he identifies himself as Lieutenant Wagner to German Colonel Burkhalter on the other end of the phone. Wagner says that this is an embarkation point for escapees. Listening in, Hogan asks the others who talked? Carter says it was him; he was asleep and didn't get the word not to talk to Wagner. Hogan wants to eat.

Wagner tells Klink about the operation. Kinch says that Wagner will tell Burkhalter about the whole operation. Hogan smiles, and wants to tell Wagner about everything; and he says that the Germans somehow will not believe him.

Later, Hogan blindfolds Wagner, takes him to the doghouse entrance to the tunnel in the dog kennel; LeBeau says that this is under the water tower. Hogan has Wagner pull a chain, handing him the links as he pulls, thinking he is opening up a tunnel entrance under the water tower. Hogan, LeBeau, and Wagner go below. Hogan shows Wagner the 'mint', some printing presses where they print phony German money. Wagner asks if he has problems passing the counterfeit money off, Hogan says that in the real stuff, the ink tends to run. Wagner then quietly grabs a handful of money and stuffs it in his picket; he thinks that nobody sees him, but Hogan does. Hogan then shows Wagner the production line where they make souvenir cigar lighters in the shape of German Luger pistols. Wagner then quietly takes one of these lighters; again, Hogan sees him. Hogan tells Wagner about Oscar Schnitzer, the dog man. He says that there are no dogs in the truck, but it is a phonograph record playing barking dogs. Hogan shows Wagner the steam room with several prisoners taking a steam bath; then the barber shop, where they give escapees haircuts and manicures, with Helga as the manicurist. Hogan then says that he has to call the submarine. Kinch, on the radio, pumps a cylinder that raises the radio antenna that is built into the flagpole. The submarine 'Mama Bear' calls Hogan 'Goldilocks'. Hogan tells them to pick up the packages 3 hours earlier than scheduled.

The next day, at roll call, Hogan meets with Colonel Burkhalter. Wagner comes out and accuses Hogan about the operation he is running under Klink's nose. Wagner says that he has a sample of money that they printed; he can't find it. Newkirk winks at Hogan, implying that Newkirk quietly picked his pocket of the money, and did other things while Wagner didn't know it. Wagner talks about the souvenir lighters. Burkhalter asks for a cigar; Klink does not have one, but Hogan gives him one (one of Klink's that he stole earlier). Wagner goes to give him a light, but the pistol fires a shot instead, blowing the end off of the cigar. Burkhalter is agitated. He asks Wagner to show him the entrance to the tunnel; Wagner says that it is under the water tower. They go to the water tower, Wagner pulls the chain, and water falls onto Burkhalter. The dog truck comes in; Wagner says that there are no dogs, just a record, so he opens the back door of the truck. The dogs jump out and start running around. During the commotion, Hogan puts Carter in the truck and closes the door. Burkhalter says to arrest Wagner, and give him some time on the eastern front.

As all this is ending, Schultz finishes counting the prisoners; 15, all present. Klink looks at Schultz and says 'Did I ask you?' Schultz takes the men tack into the barracks. Hogan is last; he waits for Schultz to go in, then stays outside and closes the door behind Schultz. After a couple of seconds, Schultz comes out and shoos Hogan back in the barracks."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0602338/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"Learning that the German army is manufacturing an improved Tiger tank, Hogan and his men are determined to steal one, so they can disassemble it and make blueprints for the Allies.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Robert Butler'],"['', '', '']",[],"['tank', 'first kiss', 'underground agent', ""woman wears a man's uniform"", 'ropes', 'secret panel', 'roll call', 'speech', 'staff car', 'motorcycle', 'dog', 'disassembly', 'throwing orders on the ground', 'assembly bell', 'riot', 'phony prison camp escape', 'tiger tank', 'goodbye kiss', 'romantic kiss', 'efficiency', 'wolf whistle', 'tailor', 'character says heil hitler', 'impersonating an enemy soldier']",[],"At the start, Klink is in front of the assembled prisoners in front of their barracks, giving them a speech. He tells them that things go well for the Third Reich. New weapons pour out of the factories. He just came back from visiting a Panzer division in the area. They have a new Tiger tank that will crush the resistance. Soon the war will be over. Hogan asks Klink where the Panzer division is; Klink does not say.

After the assembly, back in the barracks, Hogan tells the men of an idea. They are going to steal a German tank, take it apart, and send the blueprints to England. Some of the men think this is a crazy idea. Hogan says that he came up with the idea, the rest is detail.

Later, in another building (the recreation hall), some of the prisoners are pulling ropes attached to the ceiling. They are attached to a side wall which will open when the ropes are pulled a certain way. A lookout at the door says that a guard is coming; then says that it is only Schultz. Schultz comes in and asks what is happening. Hogan tells Schultz that they are doing some remodeling; Hogan wants to have a view of the delousing station. How else can you get the tank in? Newkirk is dressed up as a Gestapo Lieutenant. At first, he fools Schultz, then Schultz recognizes him. Schultz asks Hogan what if the Gestapo would uncover what is going on here? Hogan tells Schultz that Newkirk is going to steal a tank. Schultz does not believe him.

Hogan goes to Klink's office; Klink says he is busy with paperwork. Hogan protests the interrogation by a Gestapo officer. Corporal Langenscheidt comes in and says that a Gestapo lieutenant is there. Klink says to let the Gestapo out.

Later, back in the barracks, Hogan tells the men the plans to grab the tank. LeBeau will escape after Newkirk brings the tank in. He will make contact with French Underground agent Tiger, change clothes, and bring him into camp. Just then, the assembly bell rings; Hogan says that it is 31 seconds early.

At roll call in front of the barracks, there are 14 present, 1 missing. Klink does not have time to ask about the missing prisoner when a tank comes in the gate. Newkirk, in a German uniform, is in the top ring of the tank; (the driver compartment is separate from the gunnery area; it does not show who is driving the tank). Newkirk, in a German accent, asks about rebellions prisoners; he sees none. He asks Klink why he requested a tank. Newkirk throws 'orders' down, Schultz picks them up, and gives them to Klink. As Klink starts to read the papers, Hogan tells Klink that 1 prisoner has escaped. Klink says to sound the alarm and let out the dogs. Schultz sends everybody back into the barracks; Hogan signals the men to go. Newkirk drives the tank around the area. Some of the prisoners open the side of a building, the tank goes in, and the men close the side of the building back up. Schultz sees this happen, but he just stands there with his mouth open and does nothing. When the tank gets inside, the men start swarming around the tank. Newkirk says that he just wanted an oil change.

Later, back in the barracks, there is a knock on the tunnel entrance to the barracks. LeBeau comes up the tunnel. Hogan asks LeBeau where is Tiger? LeBeau says that it just would not work out, changing clothes. Tiger is below, waiting to come up. He signals Tiger up. Tiger, a beautiful blonde, comes up from the tunnel; the men give her wolf whistles. Hogan did not realize that Tiger was a woman. Hogan asks where to put her up; Newkirk volunteers to share his cubicle.

Later, Newkirk is measuring Tiger for new clothes. Tiger talks to Hogan about a diversion. Tiger says that the tank is in pieces; Hogan says that it will be put back together. Schultz comes in. He says that Klink is boiling mad over the escape that is not an escape. After talking to Hogan for a few seconds, Schultz sees Tiger. He tells Hogan that this time, they went too far; then he says that he sees nothing.

Hogan goes to Klink's office. He sits down, but Klink says 'On your feet'. Klink says that his men were out all night looking for the prisoner that did not escape. There will be punishment for all prisoners: The recreation hall will be padlocked for 2 weeks. Klink says that a Tiger tank came in, and wants to know where it is; Hogan asks which gate it went out of. Just then, Klink gets a call from General Hofstader of the Panzer division that the tank came from. Hofstader wants to know where the tank is. Klink says that the tank will be found. The tank did not leave the camp; he will search the prisoners. Hogan says that it will show up.

In the barracks, Klink tells Hogan that Hofstader will be coming for the tank. Hogan says to give the tank back.

In Hogan's office, Tiger is in an American uniform. LeBeau and Tiger kiss twice on the cheek, French style. Tiger then apologizes to Hogan if she made his plans difficult. Tiger says that she volunteered, after hearing about the operation. She was curious about the man in charge. Just then, a bell rings - roll call. Hogan tells Tiger that it is roll call. They pause for a moment. Kinch comes in and says 'Roll call'. Hogan and Tiger seem to ignore Kinch for a few seconds, and Hogan leaves.

General Hofstader and two officers come into camp in a staff car led by a motorcycle. Hofstader tells Klink that he released a tank because of a prisoner riot. He sees no riot, and he sees no tank. All he sees is a colonel (Klink) about to become a corporal. Klink says that he will search the prisoners. Hofstader is mad, and says that they are talking about a tank, not a toy dump truck. Schultz goes down the line, counting the prisoners. When he gets to Newkirk's spot, Tiger is there. Schultz wants to know what she is doing there, and where is Newkirk. Hogan says that Newkirk will be there any time now.

At that moment, Newkirk is in the recreation hall on top of the tank. He reaches in the top of the tank, turns it on, and the tank rolls off. The tank breaks through the side of the building and starts going through the camp. The Germans give chase after the tank. Tiger grabs Hogan and kisses him. The tank breaks through the closed front gate, and Hofstader's staff car and a motorcycle go after it.

At the end, in Klink's office, Hogan is seen using Klink's pickelhelb helmet to break nuts, picking the helmet up by the point and smashing the nuts on Klink's desk. Klink says that strange occurrences have been happening. He asks Hogan for an explanation. Hogan says that Gestapo is doing it. Klink's efficiency is showing them up, and they are getting jealous. Hogan suggests setting up an escape, nothing big, just 15 to 20 men. Klink says that doing that is treason."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0602361/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Hogan concocts a Kommandant of the Year award to distract Klink so a new Nazi rocket being stored protectively at Stalag 13 can be sabotaged.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Robert Butler'],"['', '', '']",[],"['grape', 'scroll', 'impersonating a german officer', 'military aide', 'tattered uniform', 'sabotage', 'rocket', 'diversion', 'award', 'disguise', 'explosion', 'makeshift periscope', 'motorcycle', 'rocket launching', 'speech', 'thompson sub machine gun', 'scientist', 'commando', 'german shepherd', 'alarm', 'walkie talkie', 'schnapps', 'medal', 'antenna', 'submarine', 'coffee pot', 'hidden microphone', 'periscope', 'motorcycle with a sidecar', 'secret weapon']",[],"With his new German rocket housed at Stalag 13, Major Hauser and his staff arrive and get out of the staff car.

Schultz, having caught Carter outside after final roll call, returns him to Barracks 2. Carter says he was only out to buy some beer from town, promising to be back by June, July at the latest.

A motorcycle with a sidecar leading a truck with something on it comes into camp. Hogan comes along, Carter reports that something big has been brought into camp, and Schultz, having been called a goon, exits.

Hogan pulls up the makeshift sink periscope (made from plumbing pipes and a food can that emerges from the rain barrel outside) to have a look. Schultz is nearby, so Hogan has to be careful looking. It's a big item, bigger than a breadbox and bigger than a piano, and Hogan figures it's in camp as Allied bombers would never attack a STALAG housed with their fellow soldiers.

Carter suggests they find out what the big item is and, if important enough, have the Allies bomb their camp anyway. Hogan takes him over to the front door, opens it, and orders Carter out. Carter says he might get shot. ""That's right,"" says Hogan. Socially clueless Carter considers following these orders, but his mates pull him in and close the door.

Klink and Hauser are in Klink's office. Klink reads orders from General Burkhalter putting the camp at Major Hauser's disposal. Hauser wants Klink's assurance of absolute security at the camp. Klink says that the secret will not go beyond these walls, unaware that the microphone in the picture of Adolf Hitler on the wall that he stands next to is real, and the conversation is being listened to.

Hogan and his men stand around the coffee pot / listening device in Hogan's quarters, hearing every word from Klink's office. Hogan asks for more volume, but Kinch can't comply as the men have been using the coffee pot for making coffee, clogging the amplifier.

Hauser reveals that the big item is a new type of V-bomb with a volatile explosive to be taken to the coast for launching against England, keeping it safe at STALAG 13 for two days till its new launchpad is ready. Hauser's report to Burkhalter will speak favorably of Klink's cooperation; Klink reminds him that his name is spelled with a K.

Hogan takes Kinch down to the tunnel to contact their submarine. Kinch pumps the antenna handle, which raises their antenna from inside the flagpole flying the Nazi flag atop Klink's office.

Hogan (as Goldilocks) calls for the sub (Mama Bear). Hogan says that 'Miss Muffet' has a 'tuffet', and asks permission to destroy the rocket, to make the 'tuffet' go boom; but Mama Bear orders him to sit tight and call back in twelve hours.

LeBeau and Newkirk report they can't get near the heavily guarded rocket to check it out. Carter suggests tunneling under it through their wine cellar. LeBeau strongly objects, as this action would disturb their stored Chateau LaFite from its rest, chiding Americans for their low brow preference for hot dogs and beer.

Kinch delivers a message from the sub, telling them to expect a four-man team's arrival (Dr. Schneider, a scientist, with three commandos) to inspect the V-bomb, dropping in at 9:00PM. Newkirk asks how they get the men in. The men believe it'll be tough with Klink's raised security measures, for which Klink, jokingly, should receive a medal. This gives Hogan an idea: give Klink a medal and a scroll as Kommandant of the Year. Hogan asks what the metal shop is working on. Kinch replies that they are producing hand grenade paperweights (every third one live to give Gestapo men a real bang in their mail). Hogan has them stop these for a while to fashion an ornate medal with a German eagle clutching the throat of an Allied prisoner - ""but friendly"" - accompanied by a big, fancy, baroque scroll with cupids.

Kinch leaves to confirm the drop point. Carter leaves to order up the medal and scroll. Hogan instructs LeBeau to work up fake orders from General Burkhalter. LeBeau wonders how they can deliver these orders to Klink, to which Hogan points out Newkirk's reliably nimble pickpocket fingers (capable even if wearing boxing gloves). To demonstrate, Newkirk relieves LeBeau of a coin.

Later, a soldier arrives with the camp mail. LeBeau collides against him with a full trash barrel. Newkirk helps the soldier up and chides LeBeau for his clumsiness. (Unseen, the faux-Burkhalter document is passed.)

Schultz announces Hogan's request to see Klink. Klink blows off the request; Schultz says it's ""urgent."" Klink asks which colonel actually runs the camp, he or Hogan, adding that he sometimes wonders. Schultz merrily concurs, which rouses Klink's anger and prompts him to threaten sending Schultz to the Russian front. ""Boy, are YOU running the camp,"" says Schultz. Sourly, Klink agrees to see Hogan.

Hogan says he's come with a complaint. Klink, presuming all prisoner complaints are trivial, sarcastically asks if the prisoners aren't sufficiently entertained or want more wine and caviar with the food they take from German mouths; to which Hogan replies that the commandant is funny enough and that he's particularly fond of caviar, which the commandant might send from the Russian front. Klink, now alarmed, thinks Hogan might have heard something, but it's just a lead-in to ask about the big thing in the yard.

Hogan takes out a copy of the Geneva Convention from his pocket. Reading from the Geneva Convention, Hogan reminds Klink of the illegality of subjecting POWs to unusual danger, tearing out and spiking that page onto Klink's Prussian helmet. Klink says he'll decide what constitutes danger and dismisses Hogan. While this discussion is going on, Hogan quietly puts the phone orders and letter on Klink's desk.

Before Hogan leaves, Klink finds the phony Burkhalter dispatch. STALAG 13 is one of the top 10 prison camps, and Klink is getting an award for Kommandant of the Year. He calls Hogan back. He reads that Colonel Schneider will arrive with his staff to present a medal and a scroll. Klink does not recall there being a Colonel Schneider on Burkhalter's staff. Hogan reminds Klink that Schneider is a very common German name and asks if his men can be allowed to parade. Granted.

Hogan talks Klink into preparing an acceptance speech, which Klink has given no thought to and wants to keep short, but Hogan talks him into preparing something of some length, such as 10 minutes, advising to leave out the ugly incident with the Munich Police.

Hogan's flattery has Klink feeling so good that Klink offers to share his schnapps in celebration. What does the Geneva book say to that?, he asks; to which Hogan looks in his Geneva convention book and replies ""Only the good stuff,"" whereby Klink switches to his best bottle.

Hogan preps LeBeau for meeting the drop team. LeBeau deplores the unimaginative use of Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood as identification codes. Hogan says if he wanted to be a writer he should have joined Special Services.

Outside the fence, LeBeau's walkie-talkie can't reach the drop team. From his own walkie-talkie, Goldilocks (Hogan) asks Big Bad Wolf (LeBeau) what's wrong. LeBeau can't find the recently-dropped men, and requests help, so Hogan sends Carter to tell Schultz that one of the men has gone over the wire.

Carter exits the barracks and calls for Shultz. He says that a man is missing. The tower guard swings a light on him and Schultz runs in, catching up his rifle in Carter's jacket. Schultz wants Carter to quiet down before he wakes everybody up. Carter asks why Schulz doesn't want the credit for discovering there's a missing man. Thinking about it, Schultz happily shouts that a prisoner has gone over the wire.

Alarm rings. German shepherds are released that quickly find LeBeau, who asks the friendly canines what took them so long. LeBeau tells them to track down the drop team. The dogs sit reluctantly. LeBeau says he's ashamed of them. Guilt-ridden, they turn and find the drop team.

The commandos wonder what to do about their damaged walkie-talkie, to which Doctor Schneider points out he had little to do with them at Caltech.

The commandos hear the dogs. The dogs and LeBeau arrive. Passwords are exchanged. LeBeau hears of their problems, that the wind blew them away from point M-14. LeBeau gives a notebook to a commando, and promptly begins taking their measurements, saying they'll be entering the camp in German uniforms tomorrow.

Mission accomplished, LeBeau returns with the dogs to the fence where he shouts his surrender and shames the amiable dogs into appropriate aggressive barking by calling them pussycats.

Next day. A staff car drives in carrying the drop team, now in German uniforms. Klink greets them warmly and invites them inside. Colonel Schneider introduces the commandos and Captain Hackenburg, Lieutenant Bauer, and Lieutenant Schmittburg. Hogan looks on, and LeBeau says Schneider's collar could do with a little more work.

Klink, Schneider, and other assemble on the platform for the award presentation. Later at the award ceremony, Hogan is in complete control of crowd reactions (which swing abruptly from enthusiastic applause and wild cheering to complete silence). He is standing behind Klink so Klink can not see his hand signals. Klink receives his medal and scroll, and starts his acceptance speech.

While Klink is speaking, Schneider sneaks unnoticed beneath the rocket canopy. Hogan means to join him but Schultz catches him. Hogan admits his aim, to sneak in and see the rocket, to which Schultz, exasperated, replies that he sees nothing, nothing.

Under the canopy, Hogan's arrival startles Schneider, busily photographing the controls. Hogan has the bomb, set to go off in a few minutes; Schneider shows where to place it to trigger the rocket's blast off. Hogan exits.

Catching Klink at the end of his speech, Hogan encourages him to say more and milk the moment.

As Schneider exits, his coat catches under the canopy. This gives Major Hauser time to notice him and come forward. In finally freeing his coat, Schneider strikes Hauser in the face. It would seem the jig is up, but Schneider keeps talking, admiring the major's rocket and deflecting the awkward moment by saying that Klink is a lousy speech-maker. Schneider tells Hauser that he worked on an original model. Hauser agrees about Klink and, proud of his rocket, invites Schneider back under the canopy for a personal tour. Schneider dares not refuse, even with the bomb set to explode any minute.

Klink launches into another personal story that feels right for the occasion.

As Schneider fears for his life, Hauser points out some of his many implemented safeguards against accidental firing. Schneider slips out as Hauser begins to demonstrate how the rocket can not be fired. He even puts the switch in the 'remote' position and pushes 'fire', the rocket should not fire. Just as Hauser presses the firing button ""in complete safety,"" the bomb explodes and the rocket launches.

Klink, having dropped to the ground, asks what happened. Hogan says one of his rockets is missing. Hauser, soot-faced and in torn clothes, staggers from the rocket transport and declares a catastrophe. Klink agrees - his medal has disappeared. Hogan says that they will make him a new one.

Back in his office with Hogan, Klink, his camp's reputation destroyed, frets over the direness of Hauser's report to Burkhalter in Berlin. Schultz enters with news, but Klink is entirely taken up by the rocket's loss. Klink is afraid of being sent to the Russian front. Hogan suggests they claim Hauser was drunk and eager to fire his rocket at England. Though far-fetched, Klink agrees that it could pass.

Finally paying attention to Schultz, Klink takes the Berlin report from his hand. Terrible news. The rocket landed in the Hamburg Airfield, destroying half of it. Klink leaves to see if Major Hauser has a better lie than Hogan's to explain it.

Left alone together, Schultz pronounces Hogan's destruction of the airport as naughty-naughty. Hogan's glibly replies that his aim is terrible when in a hurry."

Olsen escapes in the dog truck with the dogs sent out to look for Olsen. Olsen will blow up the train with dynamite stored near the tracks. All events to begin by Hogan tipping his cap.

Hogan further admonishes his men against making things too complicated by ad libbing their parts. Keep it simple. A simple, diversion, a simple escape, and a simple explosion.

Kinchloe enters, announcing a guard coming. Hogan rolls up the map hanging from the bunk bed and rolls down the drawing of a girl. Schultz enters as if walking in upon Hogan lecturing his men on women, which he explains as a once-every-six-months army regulation. Schultz disbelieves this. Hogan asks if he wants to know what's really going on, and Schultz says no.

Schultz rousts everyone out for roll call - all but Hogan, whom the Kommandant wants to see. To Kinch and Carter, Hogan changes his signal from tipping his cap to merely coming out if Klink's office.

Klink tells Hogan of the immanent visit to the camp of Inspector General von Platzen, the Inspector General of the Armies of the Third Reich. Hogan wonders why he wasn't previously informed. Klink speculates that Hogan would like to see him replaced by a less strict, less vigilant, less efficient kommandant, disbelieving Hogan's statement that he would do anything to keep Klink around.

Klink warns that, during the inspection visit, he will keep his eyes on Hogan. Klink tells Hogan not to try anything.

Cpl. Langenscheidt enters to announce the arrival of General von Platzen. The news shatters the fragile confidence of Kommandant Klink, who begins to worry deeply of the visit's outcome.

Klink (with Hogan nearby) greets von Platzen in the outer office. Von Platzen's eye is immediately drawn to secretary Helga's beauty. Klink introduces Hogan, to whom von Platzen eventually turns his attention.

Hogan complains about the food, which pleases Von Platzen. If POW ""Bogan"" didn't complain about the food, he'd immediately know something was wrong with the camp.

With his eye straying back to Helga, von Platzen suggests they go outside and inspect the staff later. ""Grogan,"" knowing his exit will set off his team's plans, tries unsuccessfully to remain indoors.

Stepping outside, Hogan tries warning off his men from the plan, but none catch his meaning and set off the arranged events. As Schultz counts off the men, Carter sets off his bombs, and Olsen heads for the dog truck. All drop to the ground, and von Platzen declares they're under attack from barbaric B-17s now bombing prison camps. Klink declares it the fault of German leaders claiming German soil sacred. Hogan declares it a thunderstorm.

As Olsen hides in the dog truck, Newkirk asks Carter about any more of his ""firecrackers,"" to which Carter says just one more. Newkirk declares you'd think there was a war on. He then gets to Schultz to say he thinks there's a man missing. Schultz, flat on the ground for protection, says ""Who cares?!""

Schultz finally announces a prisoner missing. Klink calls for an alarm and the release of the dogs, chiding soldiers laying on the ground behind him (as he was) for being cowards.

As the dog truck begins to leave camp, Hogan opens the back and pulls Olsen out. Olsen doesn't understand, and Hogan merely says it's a complicated war before a German shepherd guard dog comes up and licks his face.

Back in Klink's office, von Platzen reviews the facts while also noticing Klink's cigars. Hogan strikes a match against Klink's Prussian helmet and lights von Platzen's cigar.

Ready for dictation, Helga asks if she should take down everything. Von Platzen says she can mainly just sit there looking pretty, to which Hogan responds ""Thanks, I will.""

Von Platzen asks for an explanation from Klink, then from Hogan. Klink declares the events a plot to discredit him, calling Hogan a man who'd like to see Klink removed. Olsen has been locked up for thirty days and the entire camp punished for three weeks without exercise privileges. Barracks are being torn apart and searched for further explosives. ""Doogan"" says that this was a legitimate escape attempt, and declares Klink an inhuman beast and the events perpetrated by men tortured beyond their limits of endurance.

Von Platzen finds it a strange coincidence that all this should have occurred during his visit, to which Hogan admits it was due to a slip up in their intelligence (a rare touch of honesty before the Germans). Von Platzen commends Hogan for his grandstand gesture in foiling the escape, though it would make him a fink to his own men.

In review of STALAG 13's history, von Platzen finds it had been a miserable camp until Klink's arrival. Other camps have suffered wholesale escapes while STALAG 13 went escape-free. Von Platzen tells Klink that his record is under review in Berlin. Klink has 20 years in grade, longer than anyone; his efficiency is one degree above miserable - until he came to STALAG 13. Klink, suspecting he'll be fired from his post, asks if he will be retained. ""No,"" says von Platzen. He is to be promoted and moved to Berlin where he will be put in charge of all prison camps, having finally found his niche. He wants Klink to bring along his 'personal staff', meaning Helga. Hogan is floored. Von Platzen admits it was Hogan's hostility and fear that finally convinced the Inspector General of this as the right move. Hogan says that sometimes he talks too much.

Returning to the barrack humbled, Hogan admits his own guilt in over-embellishment, for which he earlier chided the men. He says that he is sorry, and made Klink look too good. The new plan: make Klink look bad but keep it small. He sends LeBeau (who'd like to either explode or set fire to Klink's office) down tunnel #4 to put Plan Alpha into action. To the rest, wing it.

With Schultz, von Platzen and two guards, Klink attends one last inspection of the barracks. The prisoners line up in front of some bunks. Nimble-fingered Newkirk moves first, laying hands upon the inspector over a loose button in order to lift his monocle and set it in Klink's hand, leaving von Platzen aghast at Klink's petty thievery. As Hogan begins an explanation, he signals Kinch to turn on a radio, which relays a British news broadcast. Klinch quietly flips a switch under a bunk.

Klink turns on Schultz about the radio's location. In abject fear, Schultz stammers that no one told him about it. Klink tells Schultz to find the radio. As guards begin a search, Klink, trying to intimidate, asks Hogan where the voice comes from. Presenting a thoughtful look, Hogan says, ""From the accent, I'd say England.""

At a signal, Kinch clicks off the radio.

Displeased, von Platzen confronts Klink about the explosions on arrival, a funny kommandant, and prisoners tuned into the BBC. Hogan brightens to Klink's sarcastic suggestion that he begin giving the prisoners weekend passes to London. Klink promises that Schultz will find the radio if he has to tear apart the barracks with his teeth. In suggesting they leave before he finds his wallet missing, von Platzen finds his wallet missing, which Klink discovers in his own breast pocket. Angered, von Platzen declares that the Nazis don't need pickpockets running their prison camps.

As von Platzen exits, Hogan takes the opportunity to finally congratulate Klink on his promotion.

All exit.

As Klink, von Platzen, and three of von Platzen's aides cross the yard, the prisoners enjoy LeBeau's efforts in carrying out Plan Alpha, watching von Platzen himself walk right into a collapsing hole. ""A tunnel!"" he shouts.

Hogan joins them to admit it's his tunnel. Klink declares he'll trace it to its origin and lock up the men he finds for at least six months, to which Hogan says it comes from Klink's headquarters where it just seemed easier.

Von Platzen gets mad at Klink and promises to write up this ""black page"" of a camp when he returns to Berlin. As the inspector retreats to Klink's headquarters, Hogan tells Klink he certainly hopes this won't stand in the way of his promotion.

Soon thereafter, Hogan is astonished to learn that Carter, going too far, took the engine from von Platzen's car. What made Carter think about taking the motor? Because it was there. Fearing for Klink and thinking fast, Hogan orders Carter and LeBeau into German uniforms and sends Kinch to requisition another staff car.

Klink begs von Platzen to stay another day, to which von Platzen admits if he did he'd have Klink shot. Apparently there is nothing Klink can do to assuage the inspector's anger.

Engaging the inspector's staff car sets off an explosion and a smoke bomb, sending the Germans to hit the ground. Von Platzen thinks Klink is trying to kill him, to which Klink says he couldn't be more fond of the inspector even if he was Klink's own brother. He orders the fearful Schultz to investigate the motor immediately. Relieved, Schultz finds only a smoke bomb but also reports the motor missing; he says 'What motor?'

Von Platzen asks Klink if he's competent enough to arrest himself before professional men can be reached to do it. He calls for another staff car and will hear nothing further from Klink. A staff car arrives. To further distance himself from his STALAG 13 experiences, the Inspector only wants to be taken to the railroad station where he can return to Berlin by train. Peering into the car, Schultz spots Carter and LeBeau in the front seat, Carter driving, both dressed as German soldiers. He winces and looks away.

As the inspector is driven off to the depot, Hogan approaches Klink and merrily says, ""Looks like you're one of us now.""

In Klink's office, Hogan pilfers a few cigars from Klink's cigar box, as Klink, at the window, finds himself beyond hating him and sadly accepts the end of his career. Hogan cites Napoleon facing times when all seemed lost while hanging onto a star of destiny, encouraging Klink to do the same and think of a miracle where his ""star"" might carry him through. What miracle should Klink concentrate upon? Hogan suggests believing in a train blowing up. Klink says he believes. Hogan checks his watch and recommends he say it again. Klink ""believes"" again, then finds it ridiculous right before an explosion rocks the area. Klink's confidence returns now that no negative report on him will reach Berlin.

Scene fades with Klink's hand tucked into the front of his coat, Bonaparte fashion.

At the end, the men are in the barracks, Schultz comes in and tells Hogan that Klink wants him to find the radio. Hogan tells Kinch to help. Kinch opens a footlocker and shows some radios and a bunch of watches. Schultz picks a radio. Hogan asks Schultz for $26 dollars, just $10 above cost. He asks Schultz 'Do you want us to make money?' Schultz starts counting out the money."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0602409/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,"Hogan's efforts to help a German baroness to escape are thwarted by Klink, who has arranged for the transfer of a British prisoner who is senior to Colonel Hogan.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Gene Reynolds'],"['', '', '']",[],"['outranked', 'escape', 'baroness', 'airplane', 'wire cutter', 'single engine airplane', 'playing timpani', 'head bandage', 'digging a tunnel', 'hit on the head', 'music episode', 'diversion', 'wagner ride of the valkyries']",[],"This is the first appearance of Colonel (Group Captain) Crittenden in the series. Col. Klink has Crittenden transferred from STALAG 18; Crittenden supposedly outranks Hogan by date of rank.

At the start, the dog truck comes into camp at night. A woman gets out of the truck. This is Baroness Lily von Schlichter (played by Louise Troy, a future Mrs. Werner Klemperer) who wants to defect. LeBeau has to get the dog out of the dog house so he can lift it up; he takes the baroness down into the tunnel. Lily says that she will never get out, as her picture is all over Germany. Hogan says that he will get her out by plane, they are building one. Lily asks if she is safe here; LeBeau smiles at her and says not if he can help it.

In Klink's office, Hogan and Klink are talking. Klink wants to tell a joke, about being at a racetrack and betting on 8 in a row. Klink then says that since Hogan came to STALAG 13, strange things have been happening. Recently, a plane was shot down but the pilot was not found. There is a German defector in the area that has not been found, and trains are blowing up. Klink suggests that Hogan is bad luck. Klink tells Corporal Langenscheidt to being in Colonel Crittenden. Crittenden has been in STALAG 18, and Klink had him transferred here. He says that Crittenden has 12 years seniority by date of rank on Hogan, so Hogan is no longer the senior prisoner of war officer in this camp. Crittenden comes in and talks with Hogan and Klink. He asks about morning calisthenics and parade; Hogan says that there are no morning exercises or parades. Crittenden is disappointed.

Hogan goes back to the barracks. In his office, Hogan is packing up his things and tells the men about what is going on. Crittenden has arrived, and Hogan is no longer the senior officer there. Carter says that they can ignore Crittenden; Hogan says that that is wrong. Just then, Crittenden comes in. Hogan tries to introduce the men, but Crittenden stops him. Crittenden says that there are no calisthenics or parades, so the men are getting flabby. Crittenden says that he made 11 escape attempts, and was caught every time. Hogan gives Crittenden a hypothetical situation, briefly describing what is going on at the camp. Crittenden says that he would hand over information to the Germans. After some more discussion, Crittenden leave, Carter and Newkirk go with him.

In another building, Hogan talks to Lily in the plane. He tells her that he found Lieutenant Harris and plane parts, and are putting the plane back together. Lily says that this is a fantastic operation. Hogan tells her that Crittenden is now in charge. Just then, they hear digging. Hogan hears it and says that it might be one of us. Crittenden breaks through the wall, sees the plane and Lily. Hogan then drops a wrench on Crittenden's head, and Crittenden gets knocked out.

Shortly later, outside, Newkirk is putting bandages on Crittenden's head. Newkirk says that the whole tunnel caved in. Crittenden, now awake, says that he saw some things; Hogan says that it was a mirage. Hogan says that Crittenden saw a plane and a woman; Crittenden surprisingly says yes. Crittenden says that we need a diversion; musical instruments.

Hogan convinces Klink to have a Camp Orchestra. Schultz comes to Hogan's office; Hogan is shown two playing kettle drums. Schultz says that a female spy is walking around the camp. Schultz caught Lily. Lily tells Hogan that the Gestapo put her in a cell underground and she did not like where she was. Hogan wants to put her in a tunnel. Hogan then looks out the office door, and sees Crittenden coming. Hogan tries to hide lily; he turns her around and puts his cap on her. Crittenden comes in and starts talking to Hogan. Crittenden sees Lily and take her cap off. Crittenden says that they could be shot; he says that prisoners must try to escape, but in all other manners cooperate with the Germans. Lily tells Crittenden that she is fighting for the same cause. Crittenden wants to turn her in; after some convincing from Hogan, he gives her 24 hours.

In a tent in camp, the men are finishing up work on the plane. The construction noise is covered up by an 'orchestra practicing', actually a record player turned up loud playing ""Flight of the Valkyrie"". Klink is in his office listening, and pretending to 'direct' the orchestra. He says that he will be carried off to Valhalla. Helga asks Klink if he is volunteering for active duty. Sgt. Schultz, while standing guard, acts out the music. He goes inside the tent, sees the phonograph next to Kinchloe, sees the plane, and sees Lily. Hogan tells Schultz that Crittenden is in charge. Where is he? Hogan does not know.

The music stops; Crittenden, Newkirk, and Carter are at the fence, about to break out.

In the tent, Baroness Lily kisses Hogan good-bye and gets in the plane. The plane starts up.

At the fence, Crittenden cuts some fence wire, and the fence section falls down. The plane revs its engine, the tent opens, and Crittenden goes outside the camp. Crittenden wants Newkirk and Carter to escape with him, but now that Crittenden is outside the fence, Hogan is now senior officer again, and they would rather stay. Newkirk tells Crittenden to get out of the way, as this is now a landing strip. Crittenden sees the plane coming and gets out of the way. Then the plane, with Baroness Lily and the pilot (a shot-down pilot Hogan is sending back to England) fly off. Hogan waves. The plane that flies out looks superficially like a single-engined B-25 with 2 tail fins.

In Klink's office, Klink says that he hears a motor, looks out the window, goes outside, and tells Schultz to start shooting. The plane gets away.

At the end, Hogan and Klink are in Klink's office. Klink asks for an explanation. Hogan says to ask Crittenden. Klink put Crittenden in the cooler. Hogan says that there have been no escapes; he and Klink make quite a team. Klink transfers Crittenden back to STALAG 18. He asks Hogan if Crittenden was responsible. Hogan says that they both had to lose him, he was bad luck."

Klink asks Hogan how many prisoners there are supposed to be. Hogan says 15. Klink says correction, 16. There is a new prisoner. There was a commando raid on a nearby ammunition depot, and the commandos were captured; one of the seven was sent to STALAG 13. While Klink walks down the line of prisoners talking about escaping from STALAG 13, Hogan slaps Klink on the back with a dirty hand, leaving an oil mark on Klink's uniform. Schultz says that he shouldn't do that to the Kommandant. Hogan responds that the Germans won't give them a roller towel.

Shortly later, Hogan and the new prisoner, RAF Sergeant Walters with an arm in a sling, are walking in the compound talking about the raid. They were raiding the headquarters of General Schmidt. There is going to be an offensive someplace, but they don't know where. Walters tells Hogan that they set the timers, put the other charges in place; but they were not able to finish the job. Just connect the wires. Walters talks about German General Schmidt, the commander of the ammunition depot. Walters also tells Hogan that the other commandos were sent to Kleinfeldt prison camp.

Hogan goes to Klink's office, and leads Klink on to something he knows. He tries to leave, but Klink stops him. mentions a rumor that they are closing the camp. Klink denies the rumor. They why did they only send him one commando (and one with a broken wing), and sent the others to another camp. Hogan convinces Klink to make a phone call to get the other commandos. Klink calls headquarters, wants the other 6, he will send a truck. Hogan gives Klink a scarf as a gift. Klink says that he has one just like it; it actually is his scarf that Hogan took from the coat rack, and is giving it back to him.

That night, Hogan and Carter in black commando garb go to the ammo depot in a side tarpaulin of a truck that is rolled up. Hogan finds the timer in a wine storage room, turns it on, and sets it to 20 minutes. They hear General Schmidt and a fraulein (not named in the show but appears in the credits as 'Fraulein') talking in the next room. They run out of wine, so Schmidt goes to the back room to get some more wine. Hogan sees him coming and gives a full wine bottle to Carter, telling him to do the honors. The General comes in the room, and after some near misses, Carter knocks out Schmidt. The fraulein hears a noise, and goes to the back room. Hogan grabs her and gives her a big kiss, saying auf weidersehn, making her think he is Schmidt. She can not see well as the lights in the room are off. She then picks her coat up and leaves through the front door. Before they leave, Hogan wants to take Schmidt prisoner, and take him with them while he is still unconscious. If the Germans have an American prisoner, why can't the American prisoners have a German prisoner?

The next day, a truck comes into STALAG 13 with the 6 commandos that Klink requested. Hogan and Newkirk are also in the truck, unbeknownst to the driver. Hogan comes out of the truck in a formal smoking jacket. Hogan asks Schultz how many prisoners; Schultz says 6. Hogan tells Schultz that there should be 7 prisoners, not 6. He tells Schultz at first that he is missing a prisoner; then he 'finds' the prisoner in the back of the truck. He quickly writes down the name 'Finnegan' on the prisoner list and changes the number from 6 to 7.

Hogan goes to Klink's office, Klink has the sheet of hew prisoners. Hogan looks at the list and gasps. He says that there is an escape artist on the list. At first, he does not want to say who he is, leading Klink on. Then he points to the name 'Finnegan' on the list. Just then, General Schmidt, in a prisoner's uniform, comes to Klink's office, angry that they think he is a prisoner. Hogan says that he recognizes him. Hogan silently suggests to Klink, by pointing, that Schmidt is the escape artist. Schmidt insists that he is indeed General Schmidt. Klink says that Schmidt was blown up with the ammo depot. Hogan then says that he really is General Schmidt. After some discussion, Klink calls the guard, and has him hauled out of the room. The guard pushes Schmidt out of the room backwards with his sub-machine gun.

Later, Hogan talks to Schmidt while walking in the compound. Hogan says that he believes that he is Schmidt, and insults Klink for not believing it. Hogan wants to get a message out to Schmidt's staff; Schmidt is puzzled on how he can do that. How? Bribe a guard. Schmidt, thinking that something is going on, says that he can not get a message out for 5 days. Schmidt walks off, and Newkirk comes by to talk to Hogan. Hogan says that Schmidt will not tell him anything and that Schmidt will not talk to save his life; or will he? Hogan tells Newkirk that we have a job for the Mighty Hogan Art Players.

Later, In the barracks, Hogan tells Schmidt that he recognized him from his picture; but his neck is fuller. Schmidt is playing a chess game with himself; he plays a black move, then turns the board around and plays white. Hogan asks Schmidt if his neck is always that thick. Hogan is giving him a set up for a disease he is trying to convince Schmidt that he has. Hogan says that two prisoners, Kelly and Johnson, went just like that last week, snapping his fingers. Schmidt asks Hogan what he wants. Hogan says that Germany is winning the war, and that he wants to be the burgermeister of Cleveland after the war. Schmidt says no Cleveland. Hogan says that Schmidt has symptoms, fever, burning up. As he says this, he kicks the wall, and a board with lit candles slides under the bunk that Schmidt is in. Newkirk dresses in cold weather gear and offers Schmidt hot soup. Newkirk calls for Hogan saying that Schmidt is perspiring. Hogan asks for more blankets, as Schmidt may have 'shackelitis'. Newkirk gets a blanket, and while putting it on Schmidt, other prisoners put chains on Schmidt's legs under the blanket, hiding them so Schmidt can not see them. LeBeau comes in acting fearfully, talking about the two prisoners that were lost last week, and now him. Hogan talks about chills and shakes, and hooks up the bunk to rods in the other room. Newkirk and Kinchloe move the bunk back and forth slowly with the rods, making Schmidt think he is shaking. The candles put the bedding on fire; Hogan says that Schmidt's fever is so hot it set the bedding on fire. LeBeau brings in a large box, implying that it is a coffin. Hogan says not yet, and LeBeau wheels it back out. Hogan wants Schmidt for a name to notify; Schmidt says not yet.

Hogan and Kinch are in the tunnel, with Kinch talking on the radio to London. They are preparing for the attack, but need to know where it is going to be. Hogan says that Schmidt is about to crack, and prepare for 'Operation Reindeer'. Kinch calls London, as Goldilocks calling Papa Bear.

Then, with Schmidt still in bed sweating, the men come in singing Jingles Bells like it is Christmas. Schmidt says that Christmas is 3 months away. Hogan implies that Schmidt will not last that long. Schultz comes in dressed as Santa Claus. Newkirk gives Schmidt a magazine, but Hogan says that there is no point in starting serials. Hogan and the men then sing 'Good King Wenceslas'. Schmidt then breaks, and says to send a message to Major Umbly in Heidelheim. The men start singing 'Heidelheim' to the tune of 'Frere Jacques'. Schmidt asks if the message will get through; Hogan says that the message will get through. Schmidt asks Hogan how he can thank him; Hogan says to throw in Cincinnati (referring to when he asked Schmidt to be burgermeister of Cleveland).

At the end, two prisoners to escape come up through the tunnel; they are to take the place of Walters and 'Finnegan'. Walters and Schmidt are dressed up in civilian clothes, waiting to go down the tunnel. Walters is to take Schmidt with him. They are to go to London, where Schmidt will wait out the war in a prison camp. As they go down the tunnel under the bunk, Hogan tells Schmidt to look more German and not to talk. Hogan tells Schmidt to act like a real German, which for him should be easy."

Klink thanks Hogan for requesting a special roll call to deter a few ""hot heads"" from enacting an escape. Hogan walks around to the other side of Klink, forcing Klink to turn so that he does not see the ranks of prisoners. Hogan gives his men an ""at ease."" While talking further with Klink, Hogan checks his watch and tells his men to ""Smoke 'em if you have 'em."" The men spread out and light up with their lighters.

From the air, two Allied bomber pilots spot the lighters of the smoking men, who form a perfect arrow for them to follow and bomb the Adolf Hitler Bridge.

At next morning's roll call, Klink announces the Allied airplanes' latest yet mostly unsuccessful attempt to bomb the Adolf Hitler Bridge. The men cheer the attempt and boo its failure.

As Klink gloats over the superiority of German defenses, Carter heckles back ""We'll get the bridge next time, Fritz, baby!"" Klink puts a halt to the ""American insolence"" and orders the heckler to take two steps forward. All of Hogan's men take two steps forward. Schultz says not all should have stepped forward and says to step back. They all step back. Schultz says that's wrong, and the men step forward again. Hogan wishes Schultz would make up his mind, Newkirk calls it a lovely day for a walk anyway, and Carter says they should've packed a lunch.

Unamused, Klink punishes everyone by closing the recreation hall for a week. Hogan calls depriving his men access to their Tommy Dorsey records a cruel, inhuman, sadistic punishment. In response, Klink orders the hall closed for two weeks, instead.

In Hogan's private quarters, the men discuss the failure of the bombers, which should have worked. Since the incident has made Klink ""nasty happy,"" Hogan decides they should make him ""nasty unhappy"" and knock out the bridge themselves.

Disregarding the problem of delivery for now, Hogan looks into the problem of explosives. Carter reports they only have a can of lighter fluid and three firecrackers left over from when they celebrated Chinese New Year (claiming LeBeau was part Chinese). LeBeau recalls making a pot of chow mein from sauerkraut. Hogan recoils at the memory.

According to Carter, the easiest bomb to make would be from gas, maybe chlorine gas from ammonia and bleach. Kinch says the Germans keep those chemicals in their kitchen for cleaning. Hogan sends Newkirk to volunteer for kitchen duty, and sends Kinch to help Carter setup a bomb factory in tunnel Number 3. LeBeau asks what he can do, and Hogan say he's holding him in reserve. If all else fails, LeBeau can try poisoning the bridge with another batch of sauerkraut chow mein.

As Carter begins the delicate mix of chemicals in the tunnel, Hogan exits with Kinch, but just as they turn a corner, the chemicals explode. Coming 'round the corner, Carter, dirtied, declares that the chemical mix is pretty unstable. Kinch worries about Klink rushing in to investigate the source of their noise, but Hogan thinks he can cover it and tells Carter to keep working.

At roadside, LeBeau hangs a freshly made sign over an existing one, saying ""Danger, Blasting Area, New construction, Proceed cautiously.""

In the tunnel, Carter's chemicals begin to hiss. He backs away quickly. The batch explodes. At roadside, LeBeau steadies himself against the sign post before rushing back to camp.

Helga has Klink sign several papers. Klink declares there'd be no war without requisitions.

Schultz enters and, upon confronting Helga, flirtatiously greets her with ""Wie gehts, baby."" His face quickly drops its smile when he sees Klink in the room. Helga exits.

Klink wants to hear about the prisoners' reaction to his closing the recreation hall, pleased when Schultz tells of their unhappiness at being separated from their Tommy Dorsey records. Among the usual name-calling against Colonel Klink, Schultz reports a new one spoken by Hogan about his parents being baboons. Schultz, amused by this newest slander and ready to relay the rest of Hogan's comments, fails to note Klink's sudden indignation. Klink is immediately disinterested in hearing more, to which Schultz, to protect himself, attests that he did not listen.

In the tunnel, Carter's latest mixture, handled with long tongs, bubbles and hisses. Klink and Schultz hear the blast as the office shakes.

Anticipating an increase in escape activity during this disciplinary period, Klink instructs Schultz to make spot checks on all barracks and look for signs of tunnel digging.

Another explosion shakes the office.

Klink, having earlier called Berlin about the explosions, believes they're connected to a top secret project, since Berlin claims no knowledge of them. Schultz decried being told of this as a secret, since he is such a blabbermouth, and chuckles at Berlin, saying ""Those devils - always up to something."" Klink reminds him that he's talking about headquarters, and Schultz apologizes.

Klink tells Schultz to claim ignorance if prisoners ask about the explosions. Schultz says he's very good at being ignorant, and Klink agrees.

Klink dismisses Schultz, another explosion rocks the office, and Hitler's picture falls from the wall.

Another explosion rocks the barracks and flattens LeBeau's soufflé into a cake. Kinch hears tapping and shushes the guys. Carter's in trouble. They rush to open a footlocker and pull Carter, dazed and shaken, up through it. ""Hello, Mom,"" he greets Hogan.

Hogan asks LeBeau for water, and LeBeau drinks it, claiming he's nervous. Kinch says to give it to Carter, and LeBeau splashes the remaining water into Carter's face. Carter says he's okay, but in trying to stand falls forward (caught by Kinch). He looks at LeBeau (thinking it's Hogan) to say he's fine and just needs a couple more shots to nail the bomb recipe. Another couple of shots and none of 'em will be around anymore, says Hogan. LeBeau asks if he should make some chow mein.

Newkirk announces guards coming. Carter is quickly lifted into bed and the footlocker put right. The men hustle into casual positions, with Kinch and Newkirk at the table playing cards.

Schultz enters and notices Carter looking terrible. Claiming he's sick, LeBeau feeds Carter from a bowl as another prisoner wipes at Carter's soiled face. Schultz says they'll take him to the hospital, at which Hogan signals Newkirk.

Newkirk quickly waltzes Schultz into a game of poker and they begin to play. Schultz' subordinate announces everything checks out. Displeased with his cards, Schultz throws them down and exits.

Hogan says they still have to figure how to make more ammunition. Carter says he's still willing to try, and Hogan asks him who's side he's on.

Newkirk says it's a pity they don't have five hundred of the few bullets he just proudly pinched from Schultz, saying they'd make a lovely bomb and that he needed to stay in practice or lose his nimble-fingered edge.

Hogan's new idea from looking at the bullets: Blow up the Adolf Hitler Bridge with the Nazi's own ammunition. He pulls down a map of the camp from a bunk to show where they can tunnel up from Tunnel #3 to get into the ammo shed. Carter, recovering his senses by now, delivers the bad news that the last explosion caved in fifty feet of that needed tunnel to get there, which Kinch projects will take them a month of digging to get through.

Undeterred, Hogan asks Newkirk if he can pick a lock (which Newkirk claims is an insulting question) and asks LeBeau for the rest of his sign-painting paint to ""paint Klink into a corner.""

Later (or the next day), Schultz, astonished, spots graffiti on the ammo shed: ""Hess is a mess, Himmler is a rat fink, Goering is a fat rat fink, Klink is bucking for rat fink."" He's amused at the last one but catches himself and runs to report it.

While the graffiti appalls Klink, Hogan blows it off as just a boyish prank brought on by men being denied their Tommy Dorsey records. Hogan chides Klink over getting upset over a small matter that won't take but a couple of hour for his guards to paint over. His men?? Klink orders Hogan's men to paint over those slogans at once (just what Hogan wanted).

Klink orders Schultz to get paint and brushes for Hogan's men right away. As Hogan protests against Klink ordering his men to paint the building, ignoring ""all the rules of civilized warfare,"" he simultaneously instructs Schultz to get a large tarp and long ladders. Klink finally cuts him off, demanding silence against having the men paint the building throughout the entire war - in chains.

With the tarp in place over the doorway and Schulz looking on, Hogan orders Newkirk to paint the door trim. Under the tarp, Newkirk quickly picks the lock and enters. As Newkirk starts draining the shells of their gunpowder, Hogan orders LeBeau to start work on the door.

Newkirk reports it'll take some time to complete the job. Hogan acknowledges. Newkirk asks Schultz' permission to visit the ""up"" for a minute. Granted. As LeBeau works on draining more bullets, Hogan tells Kinch to water down the paint as they need more time.

Schultz notes the ""heavy traffic"" involved with this painting project (prisoners to and froing with stolen gunpowder). Hogan blames it in on his men needing to clear their heads of paint fumes. As LeBeau passes by back to the ammo shed, Schultz wishes he had ""a drug store on THIS corner.""

Later, with graffiti still showing through, Klink sees that the building isn't finished and orders Hogan to do it right.

Later still, Klink returns to see that the POWs have now indeed covered up the slogans but with pink paint. Klink threatens to consider turning over the men to the Gestapo, while Hogan finds the war a bit drab and in need of some color. ""Paint it again!"" Klink shouts. Hogan summons Carter, who carries a board with color samples. Carter recommends Blue Lagoon, while Schultz says his wife prefers Shocking Burgundy. Hogan expresses his interest in Chartreuse, which Carter finds sadly typical of an officer. ""Just paint it as all the other buildings,"" shouts Klink and exits. Hogan says he has no imagination.

Carter has all of the powder in a box that he tapes up. Now Hogan has his bomb, which Carter says will go boom from the set timer. At LeBeau's inquiry, Hogan explains they'll deliver the bomb to the bridge via the division messenger, who drops by every day on his motorcycle to pick up mail. Tomorrow he'll have their ""extra package."" The timing can be determined by the distance to the bridge and Germany's strict orders against all rear echelon drivers exceeding a forty mph speed limit.

The courier arrives and enters the office building. LeBeau mounts his motorbike while Newkirk unbuttons the cover on its sidecar and walks off. The courier returns with a pouch and a large food can and asks what Louie is doing. He pulls LeBeau off his bike, and Louie keeps him distracted in an argument while Newkirk and Carter slip their box into his sidecar. Newkirk then buttons the tarp on the sidecar. With their task complete, LeBeau apologizes and the courier drives away.

The men are pleased until Schultz comes out of the office and complains about the man charging ten marks to make a special side trip to Dusseldorf to deliver a pound of coffee to his wife. Worried, the men return to barracks.

Kinch and Hogan are talking about the route the messenger takes. Newkirk says that he talked with Schultz, and he says that there are 3 checkpoints on the route, numbers 5, 7, and 9. They figure that they need to have checkpoint #9 contacted to dissuade the courier from any detour to Dusseldorf and keep him on schedule. Hogan orders them to start sweating about it and heads to Klink's office.

As the courier drives along his route, Klink reacts to Hogan's announcement of his men bribing the courier. Klink calls in Helga to write down their forthcoming conversation precisely. Schultz and Hogan both try to help Helga with her chair, and Klink clears his throat so that they'll get down to business.

Hogan's tale: His men gave the courier money to pick up some of Klink's favorite wine in Dusseldorf, figuring the bribe ... the ""gift"" would soften Klink's heart toward restoring access to their Tommy Dorsey records. ""They keep saying there's a lot of human being left in Colonel Klink."" Klink calls them fools, and Hogan says he told them they were wrong.

Klink threatens to throw them in the cooler for life - even after the war - and even if Germany loses.

Klink orders Schultz to arrest the courier the moment he next sets foot in camp. Hogan congratulates Klink for being the most secure officer he's ever met. If the courier lingers in Dusseldorf to drink a little and boast of his deal with the prisoners, risking being overheard by the Gestapo and getting Klink sent to the Russian front, Hogan admires Klink's nerve. Klink gets on the phone right away.

As he speaks, Hogan guides him toward contacting Sentry Post #9. Schultz says goodbye to his pound of coffee, then tells Helga not to bother writing that down. Klink tells Schultz to stop muttering and tells Hogan he'll personally smash the POWs' Tommy Dorsey records before their eyes - and Jimmy Dorsey's, and the Andrew Sisters' albums, too.

Having contacted Post #9 (and still guided by Hogan), Klink orders the sentry to tell the courier to keep to his regular route, then to call back and confirm it. He further threatens to have them both court marshaled, shot, and sent to the Russian front if his orders aren't carried out.

Hanging up, he recalls having heard someone (Hogan saying ""to Braunshardt across the bridge""). Hogan claims to have said nothing, so the Colonel blames Schultz for muttering again.

Now they wait to hear back from the sentry, to be followed by Klink throwing the guilty prisoners in the cooler with his own hands.

The messenger drives up to the sentry post, and the sentry flags him down with a 'Halt' sign. The messenger points one way, and the sentry points another way. The sentry succeeds at sending the courier away from Dusseldorf and phones back.

Klink emerges from his office with Hogan and Schultz and threatens to additionally smash any Bing Crosby records if he finds them, too.

The center span of the Adolf Hitler Bridge blows up.

Schultz declares it the worst of recent explosions. Klink wishes they'd finish with the construction work, as he's getting sick of it. Hogan declares it's probably the last one. Klink asks how he would know that, and Hogan calls it a wild guess.

Standing before another roll call, Klink reports the bridge destroyed and asks for volunteers in its reconstruction. The prisoners jeer at this but Hogan volunteers the services of his men, provided the recreation hall is reopened and all past offenses are excused. Request granted and men are dismissed.

The men angrily surround Hogan over being volunteered. Hogan calmly tells them they'll rebuild the bridge with a very special feature that'll make it unique in the world - its own built-in bomb. They all happily walk along."

An S.S. General, General von Kaplow, with a briefcase attached by handcuffs, goes to Klink's office.

British Flight Lieutenants Ritchie and Donner come up through the tunnel. They say that they were shot down and bailed out. Schultz chases the men who are in the compound back into the barracks. When asked why, Schultz knows nothing. Carter says that a colonel came into camp; Schultz says that it is not a colonel, it is General von Kaplow. Hogan wonders why a German general with a briefcase would stop here. The two Flight Lieutenants want to get back to England; they have a cricket match with another organization in a few days. Hogan goes to see Klink about what is going on. Hogan tells LeBeau to get out his best recipes' the best way to a big mouth is through his stomach.

In Klink's office, von Kaplow has a patch over his right eye. He tells Klink that he is staying here. He gives him little information about his mission.

While this conversation is going on, Hogan comes into Klink's outer office. Hogan kisses Helga; she says that Hogan just wants information, and Hogan seems to agree. Hogan then goes into Klink's office and asks for favors. He says that this is 'Repeal of Prohibition Day', and suggests a dinner in Klink's quarters. He sees von Kaplow and invites von Kaplow to dinner.

At the dinner in Klink's quarters, von Kaplow sits next to Helga, and makes some subtle, and not so subtle, passes at her. While serving the dinner, Newkirk breaks a glass. Hogan tells him to pick up the pieces. Newkirk needs to go under the table to do the clean-up. While he is there, he tries to get to the briefcase. Helga's leg is in the way, so he places his hand on her leg. She does not like it, and thinks that von Kaplow did it; she moves it out of the way. Hogan asks Klink for music; Helga suggests that Klink play the violin. Klink picks up his violin and starts playing, badly. Schultz, back in the kitchen, thinks somebody is teasing a cat. Meanwhile, Newkirk picks the lock on the briefcase and takes papers out of it. He takes the papers to the kitchen where LeBeau photographs them; Newkirk holds them up and takes them off one at a time while LeBeau takes the pictures. Klink starts playing a Russian dance song on the violin, again, not so well. Newkirk comes back in to do a 'final cleanup', and goes under the table again. He puts the papers back in the briefcase and closes it up.

Later in the barracks, Hogan looks at the film of the papers. He needs to get them to England. He has a plan to get the pictures to England and to get the two pilots out at the same time. Hogan asks for 2 German officer uniforms, special services, and a phony movie camera.

Later, Hogan is in the barracks teaching Russian language lessons to the prisoners. He starts with 'tovarich', written on a shade that he pulls down from a bunk, which means 'friend' in Russian. He has them repeat 'tovarich'. Schultz comes in during the session. Hogan convinces Schultz that the Russians are coming; no need to go to the Russian front as the Russian front is coming here. Schultz mentions a radio. Hogan says that Hamburg is a shambles and Berlin is in ruins. Hogan then pulls down another shade with 'da' and 'nyet', which mean 'yes' and 'no' in Russian. Hogan has the men practice 'da' and 'nyet'; Schultz, in the back, practices along with them.

Later, Hogan dictates a letter to Kinchloe regarding Schultz being a good guard, to be sent around for the prisoners to sign. Schultz is there watching and listening; he likes the letter.

Schultz goes to Klink outside his office and tells him Hamburg is a shambles, and Berlin is in ruins he then tells Klink about the letter, Klink says that Schultz is a traitor. Schultz asks for Klink's signature on the letter.

Later, Klink turns on his radio. Kinch, impersonating a German announcer, says to tune in at 2100 hours. Newkirk, impersonating Hitler over the radio, tries to convince Klink that Germany is losing the war. If he has heard rumors that Hamburg is a shambles and Berlin is in ruins, don't believe them even if they are true. He ends the broadcast with 'Keep smiling'. Klink turns the radio off, and asks Hogan how Hitler can tell them to keep smiling. After some discussion, Hogan refers to their rescue from the camp. He says that a Sherman tank will come through the gates, with its peashooter pointed right at Klink's monocle. Out jumps a second lieutenant, 19 years old, 6 foot 4, high-school senior from Wichita, Kansas, who says to Klink 'Sir, you are my prisoner'. Either Klink surrenders the camp, or he shoots. Hogan tells Klink that he won't be going to the Russian front, the Russian front is coming here.

Later, the two flight lieutenants are in German officer uniforms, 'taking pictures' of STALAG 13 with the fake movie camera. They say that they are taking pictures of all prisoner of war camps for the archives. Hogan talks Klink into doing it. Klink tells them to proceed. They start taking various pictures, starting with Hogan and Klink drinking beers with Helga as a waitress. Klink wants other shots. They take a scene where Hogan is reviewing German guards. Klink wants one more shot. Just then, von Kaplow comes back into camp, returning from Berlin. He tells Klink that Berlin is fine. Klink stops the men with the camera taking pictures, and wants to destroy the film. Klink tries to open the camera case, but Hogan stops him. Hogan grabs the camera by the stand, turns it upside down, and dunks it in a nearby barrel of water. He tells Klink to get rid of them. Klink tells Schultz to get them a car. Klink says that he has decided not to play in the camp orchestra but he will do a solo over the loudspeaker. Hogan says to wait until the general leaves, and he does not want a mass escape while he is here. Klink gets mad; Hogan walks off.

At the end Hogan goes to Klink's office, Klink and Schultz are there. Klink says that he is missing his violin. Hogan brings the violin, quickly puts it in its case, and slams the lid. Klink takes it away. Schultz asks Hogan why he had to find it, as Klink will play it. Hogan says that if he does, he will have to blow into it, and shows Schultz the violin strings that he kept."

A bombing raid happens, the truck stops, and the 2 people in the truck, Captain Mueller and Sergeant Steinfeld, get out. Mueller looks at a map trying to find a place to go to get out of the bombing area. STALAG 13 is nearby, so he decides to head there; the Allies would never bomb a prisoner of war camp.

Hogan and Helga are in Klink's outer office, just outside of Klink's door, kissing. Klink opens the door, and asks what is happening. Hogan says that Helga is guarding the door. Klink says that she is part of a highly-trained machine. Hogan says that he must have trouble getting parts for that machine. Hogan goes into Klink's office to talk. Just as he starts, Schultz is at the door. A Captain Mueller is here to see Klink on an urgent matter. Mueller comes in; Klink throws Hogan and Schultz out. After they leave, Mueller tells Klink that they are on an urgent mission with important cargo from Norway; he says he does not know what is in the truck. He says that it is 'water'; Klink and Mueller laugh.

Hogan, Newkirk, Carter, and Kinchloe are in the barracks looking out a window at the truck, wondering what it is carrying. They close the window; Schultz comes in asking for shave lotion. Hogan gets him a bottle; he will give it to Schultz if Schultz tells him what is in the truck. Schultz at first knows nothing; then he says that it is a barrel of water from Norway. How does he know? The driver told him. Schultz leaves. Hogan is asked if he believes him. Hogan says 'Schultz yes, the driver no'.

Hogan and Kinch go to the back of the truck to put up a 'No Smoking' sign. Hogan convinces the guard that there is nitroglycerin in the truck, and smoking will set it off. The guard lets them put up the sign. Just as they leave, Newkirk comes up and lights a cigarette. The guard tells him to put it out, pointing to the sign. Newkirk feigns that he can't read it. Newkirk and the guard get into an argument, which was the intent all along. While they are arguing, Carter sneaks in the front of the truck, lifts the tarpaulin cover, and goes into the back. He sees a wood barrel marked 'wasser'. He takes a sample of it and puts it into a canteen, and leaves. Klink comes up, wanting to know what the argument is about. Klink is smoking a cigarette at the end of a cigarette holder. The guard slaps it out of his mouth, and says 'no smoking'. Klink gets mad at this. Hogan says that if this place blows up, he will never talk to Klink again.

Shortly later in the barracks, the men are talking about what the stuff is. Carter looks at it in a glass, and says that it is odorless and colorless. He then tastes it, and says that it is water.

Just then, Kinch comes up from the tunnel and says that he is on the radio to a submarine. Hogan tells the sub that they have a barrel of 'water' at their place, a truck is taking it to 'Adolf's village' from 'Viking's village'. and asks what to do with it. The sub says that it is heavy water to be used for nuclear experiments. Hogan is to destroy the barrel of heavy water. After talking with the sub, Hogan says that either they destroy the barrel. or they will be over a barrel.

Hogan goes to Klink's office. Helga blocks the door and gives him a smile. Hogan kisses Helga. Klink opens the office door, and sees Helga 'blocking' Hogan from getting in again. Hogan goes into Klink's office and apologizes for the war. Hogan tells Klink that the water is from a fountain of youth spa in Norway. King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette went there. King Louis got his hair back - he had to add an extra barber to his staff.

Klink goes to the truck to supposedly check on the water. He goes into the back of the truck, sees the barrel, takes a drink, and leaves.

The next day, Hogan goes to Klink's office. He gives Klink a strange look, and tells Klink that he appears to have more hair and looks youthful. Klink says that this morning he has had dandruff, which he has not had in a long time. Hogan asks Klink if he got to the water barrel. Klink says that if it is supposed to go to Berlin, then it goes to Berlin.

That night, Klink goes to the truck; Schultz is guarding it, but he is sleeping. Klink wakes him up. Klink wants to take the barrel of water and replace it. Schultz does not like the idea. Klink talks to Schultz more, and suggests a promotion to Uber-sergeant. Klink and Schultz go into the back of the truck; Klink tells Schultz that it is from a Norway fountain of youth. Schultz refers to a Corporal Schneider. Just then, Mueller comes by, and does not see Schultz guarding the truck. He calls for Schultz. Klink and Schultz come out of the back of the truck. Klink tells Mueller that he knows about the special water; Mueller wants to know where he got the information from. Klink says from Hogan. Mueller is surprised. Klink then goes on and says that it is from a spa in Norway. Mueller tells Klink that somebody is making a fool out of him, and tells him that this is special water for use in nuclear experiments - it is heavy water.

In the barracks, Hogan is talking to the men. He says that the truck leaves tomorrow, and the barrel can't be on it. He has an idea. He tells the men to do some things, and he tells Scotty (LeBeau's replacement for this show) to make a new barrel.

Later, Carter and Newkirk are playing catch in the compound outside of Klink's office. For one throw, Carter throws a smoke bomb into the window at the far left of the building, which is supposedly Klink's office. The smoke bomb goes off, and Klink panics, thinking that there is a fire.

While this is going on, Hogan convinces the guard/driver of the truck to move the truck; if it catches fire, it could explode. He backs it up against the wall of a barracks. Kinch and Scotty pull down a rope, that opens up a part of the wall and turns it into a ramp. They take the barrel of heavy water out of the truck, and replace it with a barrel of regular water, and close the wall..

While this is going on, Newkirk and Carter grab a fire hose and start spraying water on the 'fire'. Klink is looking out the window, and he gets sprayed with the hose. Newkirk tells Klink to jump out the window (which is on the ground floor), and that he will catch him in a blanket that he and Carter are holding. Just as Klink jumps, Newkirk moves closer to Carter to talk with him, and Klink jumps on the ground and falls over.

Mueller comes over and asks what happened. After some discussion, Mueller pats Hogan on the back, and says that he may have shortened the war. Hogan says that he is not surprised.

At the end, Hogan and Helga are in Klink's office by Klink's office door, kissing again. Klink comes out, and Helga quickly puts Hogan in an arm lock with his right arm behind his back. Helga lets Hogan go, and Hogan goes into Klink's office. Klink says that he went along with Hogan. Klink tells Hogan about the water being 'heavy water'. Hogan says that he does not want to stand in the way of Klink gloating about his victories. Hogan then looks at Klink, and tells him that maybe heavy water DOES grow hair. He then leaves. After he leaves, Klink looks at himself in a hand mirror that was on his desk."

Schultz will come for a bed check; he tells LeBeau 'You know what to do'. LeBeau takes food outside to Schultz. While Schultz is eyeing the food, the message comes in. They have lost contact from Willie; get a message to stop the weapons drop. Hogan says that he will go himself, and asks Newkirk for civilian clothes.

Next day, Klink has an assembly of the prisoners. Hogan asks to have work on a project outside of camp, with a secret reason of sneaking off for a bit. Klink says that the wire will be electrified. Hogan says that they will be guarding equipment, they have to get out some other way.

As the men go back into the barracks, a guard comes out of the barracks, Hogan is suspicious. Hogan and the men look for bugs that he may have planted. Kinchloe finds 1, LeBeau finds 1, Newkirk finds 1, all in Hogan's office. Hogan wants to use them to their advantage.

Later, the men, each holding a script, comes to Hogan's office. In the script, the men have an idea for an escape. Hogan, as part of the script, says 'No'. Schultz comes in, returns some plates to LeBeau, and insults Klink. Hogan shows Schultz the microphone in the lamp. Schultz tries to backtrack what he just said, and butter Klink up a bit.

After this is done, Klink calls General Burkhalter regarding Hogan, he talks about a pro-German attitude Hogan has. Burkhalter tells Klink to make Hogan comfortable.

Klink orders Schultz to put things in the barracks that would make Hogan more comfortable and happy, fore Germany-related items. One of the things is a picture of Hitler; Hogan asks for it to be autographed.

Hogan tells Klink that his name is really Hoganmuller, and he is German. Hogan asks Klink to go to the Hauserhof Hotel in nearby Hammelburg for dinner, but Klink says no. Hogan leaves Klink's office, asking for crumpets for breakfast on the way out.

Later in Hogan's office, the men are talking through a script to the hidden microphone. They are singing 'Roll Out the Barrel', reading the script, and Hogan is talking about the Norden. Hogan gives possible details of the Norden; he says that as a captain he tested the Norden. Klink is listening, but he can not hear many of the details over the singing. He thinks that Hogan is talking about the Norden bomb-sight. Klink calls Burkhalter regarding the Norden bomb-sight and Hogan's supposed knowledge of it. He asks Burkhalter to come to STALAG 13, saying he has a surprise.

Burkhalter comes to STALAG 13. Just inside the gates, he stops Burkhalter's staff car to show him 'escape proof gates'. The gates then open and close on Burkhalter's staff car. Schultz can't operate the gates correctly. Burkhalter does not look kindly on this. Burkhalter says that he will have a Major Klopfer, an engineer, come to STALAG 13. He wants to have the major see Hogan's description of the Norden.

Burkhalter tells Klink to arrange a party at a hotel. He tells Klink to have Hogan wear a German uniform. This is actually what Hogan wanted all along.

At the hotel, Burkhalter, Klink, Hogan, and some women are at a table eating dinner. Burkhalter asks for more champagne. Hogan gives a code phrase to the waiter 'Do you know Lili Marlene?' He did not get the right response from the waiter, so he knows that this waiter is not his contact. Klink asks a girl at the table, Gretechen, for a dance; she says no. Hogan then asks her for a dance, and she does. After dancing for a minute, Klink cuts in, Hogan sits down. Klink supposedly steps on her foot; she just gives this as a excuse not to dance with Klink. Hogan dances with Gretchen, Klink with another girl. Gretchen would rather dance with Hogan than Klink. While dancing, Hogan and Gretchen dance up to the bar. He asks the bartender 'Do you know Lili Marlene?' He does not get the right answer. Hogan then sees another waiter who is stumbling around, thinking that he may be the contact. Hogan kisses Gretchen, and excuses himself to see an 'old friend'. Hogan asks this waiter 'Do you know Lili Marlene?' This waiter gives the correct answer, and drops the tray with glasses and other things on it. As Hogan helps pick them up, he gives the waiter a cigarette pack. The waiter takes it, and is still nervous.

The next day, Hogan, Klink, Burkhalter, and Major Klopfer are in Klink's office. Hogan is drawing the Norden on a blackboard with chalk. After every item that he draws, Klopfer takes some pictures of the drawing. Hogan draws, the top; then draws the power supply at the bottom. He then connects the two with a line and adds a dust-bag. Klopfer says that he is drawing a vacuum cleaner. Hogan says that he tested the Norden vacuum cleaner. Burkhalter is mad at Klink; a vacuum cleaner is not a bomb-sight.

At the end, Schultz has men take things out of Hogan's office that he put there previously. Schultz tells Klink it is all done. As Klink is leaving, Hogan tells Klink to take the microphone, and rips it from the lamp. He says that he might talk about Gretchen in his sleep. Klink gives him a frustrated look."

He gets a signal back. He makes contact with Captain Jeb Winslow of the 413th Fighter Squadron who has been shot down nearby. Winslow starts to describe his being shot down when LeBeau stops him to take him back to camp. LeBeau says ""C'est la guerre"" to one of Winslow's remarks; Winslow replies ""That's French""; LeBeau replies in a phony French-accented southern accent ""I reckon so, stranger"".

Later, Winslow comes up into the barracks through the entrance under the bunk. He is much taller than any of the others, including Hogan. He has the cowboy look, as well as attitude. Hogan asks him if he came on a horse. Winslow asks how soon he will be going home. Just then, Kinchloe comes up the tunnel and reports that the radio is broken and needs parts; he can not fix it right now. Hogan says that he needs one volunteer to go to town, to get parts from the Underground. Newkirk was volunteered by Hogan; Hogan tells him that he has a toothache, and puts come cotton balls in Newkirk's mouth.

Hogan goes to Klink's office with Newkirk, complaining that Newkirk has a bad tooth. It is because of the sawdust the Germans put in the prisoner's bread. Hogan wants to have Newkirk go to a dentist in town. Klink reluctantly agrees to write up a pass for Newkirk to see the dentist, with Schultz guarding him. Schultz remarks that he can't stand the sight of blood. Klink asks how Schultz got in the German Army; Hogan says that he lied about his weight.

Later, Newkirk and Schultz are at a bar, getting drinks. Newkirk gets Schultz are large beer. Newkirk points behind Schultz regarding something, and Schultz turns around and looks. While he is looking at something and sees nothing, Newkirk dumps some whiskey in Schultz's drink. Later, Schultz appears to be drunk, drinking out of his helmet. Newkirk says to Schultz that it is time to go, that Newkirk has been to the dentist (while Schultz was supposedly drunk), and the swelling is gone. Schultz is so drunk that Newkirk brings him back to camp in a wheelbarrow. Klink meets them as they are about to come in the gate. He asks them what took so long. Klink sees that Schultz is drunk. Klink tells Schultz to walk a post outside the wire as punishment, and he will keep walking the post until the sergeant from headquarters comes to replace him. Then Schultz will be transferred to another command; implying but not stating directly the Russian front. Hogan arrives and butts in on the conversation. Klink and two guards walk off, leaving Schultz with Newkirk and Hogan. Schultz says 'Ach du leiber' in a drunken manner.

The next day, Schultz is seen walking a post outside the wire. Newkirk asks Hogan if Klink will really transfer him out. Just then, someone comes in the gate. A sergeant gets out in front of Klink's office, comes to attention, salutes Klink, and says 'Sergeant Krebs reporting for duty, sir'. Klink returns the salute. Hogan and the men are watching this. Hogan tells Carter to try out this new guy. Carter goes up to Klink, and calls him 'buddy' and starts to walk off. Krebs then immediately tells him to halt, tells Carter to come to attention, and says that this is no way to talk to the Kommandant. Krebs has shown that he is a strong military type. Hogan does not like this; they will need to get rid of Krebs and have Schultz stay.

Later, Hogan comes up through the tunnel into the barracks and says that it will be 3 days before they can send any radio transmissions. Winslow is a bit disappointed. Hogan says that he wants to get rid of Krebs. Schultz comes to the barracks, tired, and asks LeBeau for some of his foot powder. Carter tells Schultz that if they transfer him someplace close, he may be able to see his wife more often. Schultz says that the Russian front sound good, compared to that. Winslow comes up behind Schultz and gives Schultz a light, without Schultz realizing who he is at first. Then Schultz realizes that he is not one of their prisoners. Schultz says that if he turns Winslow in, Klink might tear up his transfer papers. Hogan tells Schultz that he is up the creek. He says that the papers have been signed, but not left the camp. Hogan then shows him some papers that were taken from Klink's desk.

Later, outside, Carter is talking to Krebs. He tells Krebs about a radio in the barracks, and gives Krebs the radio. He tells Krebs that Klink will love him for this. Krebs takes the radio and smiles. Krebs takes the radio to Klink. Klink looks at it a bit and turns it on. The radio squirts Klink in the face with a small stream of water. Klink is not amused.

Later, in the compound, Kinch is standing by the barracks and sees Krebs coming. He then gets down on his hands and knees, and starts shouting into the ground, like there is a tunnel there. Krebs comes up behind Kinch, supposedly without Kinch seeing him. Kinch shouts, supposedly to Hogan in the tunnel below, and if he can hear him, the tunnel is too close to the surface. Krebs hears all of this and leaves, supposedly without Kinch seeing him.

Krebs then takes Klink to the supposed 'tunnel' location. He says that it is right about at this location, Klink steps on the location, and falls in.

In the barracks, Hogan says that Winslow goes out tonight. Hogan says that Krebs listens by the barracks to get information, and they will put on a show for him later.

That evening, in the barracks by an outer wall, Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau put on an act with the intention that Krebs overhear them. They keep saying 'Tomorrow night, from here'. Krebs hears them saying this several times.

The next day, Krebs approaches Carter. Carter apologizes for the radio; Krebs seems to accept the apology and brushes it off. He asks Carter if there is something on for tonight. Carter does not want to give him any information, but says if he doesn't seem him anymore, it has been nice knowing him, and they shake hands. Carter leaves, and Krebs walks off.

At the end, Hogan is in the barracks talking with the men about Winslow's escape. He tells Winslow to wait for the alarm to go off, then leave. Winslow goes down into the tunnel. Krebs comes into the barracks. Newkirk starts playing card tricks to distract Krebs and keep him there for a few minutes. Newkirk tells Krebs to take a card, any card, look at it, and put it back. While Krebs is being distracted, Hogan, Carter, and LeBeau go out a barrack's window and sneak to the wire. Carter cuts the wire. Schultz comes up and wants to know what is going on. Hogan tells Schultz that he wants to help Schultz. Schultz at first does not want to turn them in. So LeBeau starts shouting. The searchlights turn on him, and the alarm sounds. Krebs is in the barracks, hears the alarm, and says that there is an escape. He runs out of the barracks.

Klink rides up to the escape site by the wire in a motorcycle sidecar.

Newkirk shakes hands with Winslow, and Winslow says 'See you in Fort Worth'.

Krebs comes to the escape site after Klink arrives and the men have been captured. Krebs reports that there has been an escape. Klink sarcastically thanks Krebs, relieves him of duty, and transfers him out. He restores Schultz to duty as sergeant of the guard. Klink then says that Carter and LeBeau will get 2 weeks in the cooler, and Hogan is confined to barracks. Schultz tells Hogan, Newkirk, and LeBeau to get back into camp, point his rifle at them. Hogan says 'How quickly they forget'."

Schultz and another guard enter the barracks and Schultz says that Colonel Klink ordered that all prisoners are to stay away from the windows and doors. After Schultz leaves, Hogan looks outside through the sink periscope. He sees a civilian escorted by 2 officers, going to a building that they had been cleaning out for the last week. Hogan wants to know who it is. LeBeau offers to go out and find out. Hogan says that he has a better idea. He thinks that Schultz might know. He tells LeBeau to tell Schultz that there is a seat at the blackjack table; he then tells Newkirk to start the blackjack game.

Shortly later, Schultz is playing blackjack in the barracks with Newkirk, LeBeau, Kinchloe, and 3 un-named prisoners; and is not doing well. So far, he has lost 300 Marks. In a following hand, he wants to bet 25 Marks on the cuff as he is out of cash. Newkirk and the others object as he has lost so much so far. Schultz wants credit, but Hogan won't give it to him. Hogan says he will give him the credit if he tells him who the civilian is. Schultz refuses. Hogan tries to blackmail Schultz, saying that he will report him to Klink for gambling with the prisoners. Just then, Carter enters the barracks, and pretends to know who the civilian is. This gets Schultz to say that he is a captured French scientist, Henri DuBois, brought here for scientific experiments. After he provides the information, his blackjack hand mysteriously ends up at 21.

Later, Hogan gets a message from London with information on DuBois. He is a synthetic fuel expert and possible collaborator. Hogan's orders are to either turn him to the allies' side, or eliminate him and his work. Hogan goes to Klink's office complaining about the situation. He tells Klink that LeBeau refused to work for DuBois, and essentially convinces Klink to have LeBeau help in the laboratory that was set up earlier. Klink then calls LeBeau in the office. Hogan empties his pipe into Klink's helmet on the desk. LeBeau comes in and starts gives his name, rank, and serial number; he starts giving his serial number as H124978, but stutters and forgets the full number. Klink orders LeBeau to assist DuBois.

LeBeau then goes to the lab building, and tells DuBois that he is here to assist, on the orders of Col. Klink. DuBois says that he did not ask for an assistant, but reluctantly accepts because it is the Kommandant's orders. After some talking, LeBeau grabs DuBois and calls him a collaborator. DuBois says that he has no choice, as the Germans are holding his daughter hostage at a hotel in town. They were captured as France fell, and had no choice but to cooperate. DuBois says that he has been making useless experiments since then, and he has run out of ideas. LeBeau suggests they make crepe suzettes; DuBois laughs. LeBeau apparently tells Hogan about this.

Soon after, Hogan and Newkirk go to the hotel in town dressed as Gestapo officers, Hogan as General von Himmelburger, and Newkirk as his aide 'Putzi'. Hogan acts mad, and asks what is going on. He wants to have the girl Marie DuBois given to him, but the officers there refuse. One officer says that he needs written orders. He threatens to have one officer shot, one sent to the Russian front, and the man at the desk court-martialed, shot, and sent to the Russian front. Hogan then trashes the hotel lobby, clearing the counter with his riding crop, breaking glasses, kicking and smashing a ceramic vase, knocking over a row of rifles that were stacked, and hitting a corporal guard on the helmet with his riding crop. He then leaves the room. Newkirk pretends to be disturbed by it, and says so. Hogan demands that the girl be brought to him in 5 minutes, or everybody will be sent to the Russian front, including the hotel itself. He then leaves the hotel. He and Newkirk wait outside. Newkirk asks what happens if they don't bring her out; Hogan says THEY might end up at the Russian front. The German officers bring Marie DuBois out. They get in a motorcycle with a sidecar, with Hogan in the sidecar and Marie in his lap; he says he is taking her for questioning.

Later that night, back in camp, LeBeau and Professor DuBois come out of the barracks, dodging the searchlights, and run to the dog truck, which is parked right outside the gate of the dog pen. LeBeau tells DuBois that they change the dogs so they don't get friendly with the prisoners. DuBois gets in the truck with the dogs, LeBeau says they will not hurt him. DuBois kisses LeBeau French style, twice; LeBeau pushes him away the third time. LeBeau then goes down the doghouse tunnel entrance. The truck takes DuBois outside the fence, where he gets out and meets Marie in the woods. Newkirk is with them, still in Gestapo uniform. He tells them that they need to 'get cracking'; they do not understand what he means. They then leave for the rendezvous with the sub.

Kinchloe gets a message from the submarine that they will pick up 2 packages, 1 large and 1 small, in 24 hours at location Y-14. Hogan goes to Klink's quarters with LeBeau telling him that DuBois has escaped. Hogan helps Klink on with his bathrobe, and tells Klink 'Nice bathrobe'. Klink is worried, in that his no escape record has been broken. Klink, Hogan, and LeBeau go into Klink's office. A Dr. Altman, a German scientist, will be coming by tomorrow to see DuBois. Hogan convinces Klink to have LeBeau impersonate DuBois for the visit. Klink says that if anything goes wrong, Hogan will be held responsible, and will take the consequences. Hogan tells LeBeau that if anything goes wrong, Hogan will be held responsible, and LeBeau says that he will take the consequences. Back in the barracks, Hogan tells Carter to teach LeBeau some chemistry, as Carter owned a drugstore in Muncie, Indiana, before the war. Carter does not know anything about chemistry, but has a handbook of pharmacy that he has been carrying for 2 years; Carter wants to take a pharmacy exam after the war.

The next day, Professor Hans Altman and his escort Capt. Kurtz come to STALAG 13 to see DuBois. They go to the lab, where LeBeau introduces himself as DuBois, and Newkirk as Monsieur LeBeau, his assistant. Newkirk gives a 'bonjour' in a phony French accent, mixed with an English accent. LeBeau puts the pharmacy book in an open drawer where he can look at it, but it is hard for the others to see. Newkirk gives them drinks to relax; he gives Kurtz a heavy drink, with the intention of getting him drunk, which he eventually does. Altman asks how it is going, and LeBeau starts reading from a book. He refers to an emulsion, and Altman is astounded as he has not thought of that before. Altman thinks that is a good idea, and asks if he uses positive or negative ions. LeBeau deflects the question by asking if they teach anything in Berlin. Altman asks LeBeau/DuBois if he got chemicals to mix, and they have more discussions. LeBeau mentions that the concoction can also clear sinuses. LeBeau goes through steps: Make accurate measurements, select the proper vessel, and wash hands.

Meanwhile, down in the tunnel, Hogan calls the sub asking them to advise when packages have been picked up.

LeBeau says that he mixed two chemicals that cleared nasal congestion. The escorting officer is getting noticeably drunk by this time. Altman says that they have saved hundreds of hours, he thinks.

Hogan gets a message that the packages have been picked up by the sub. Carter then goes to the lab, and tells LeBeau/DuBois that the 2 packages have arrived. LeBeau says not a moment too soon. Altman and Kurtz leave, leaving the professor to his work; Kurtz staggering out. Newkirk congratulates LeBeau. Altman then comes back and opens the door, and asks for some leftover emulsion, as he has nasal congestion, then leaves. LeBeau says 'This is a crazy war.'

At the end, Carter leaves the laboratory building, and nods to LeBeau. Lebeau then walks to Kinch, and gives him a nod; Kinch then goes to Newkirk, and gives him a nod. Newkirk then walks on a bench by a window of Klink's office that Hogan is looking out of. Klink says that they got away with LeBeau impersonating DuBois for one day, but that Altman will be back tomorrow for further conversations with DuBois. Hogan says not to worry, as DuBois was killed in an explosion in the lab. Klink looks puzzled, as he has heard no explosion. Klink asks 'When?' Hogan looks at his watch and counts down from five. Just then, they hear an explosion. Klink looks at Hogan and seems to wonder how Hogan knew about it in advance. Hogan asks Klink 'Any questions?'"

Carter is in a guard tower, also looking at something with binoculars; the guard turns around and catches him, and takes the binoculars. LeBeau falls off the roof, and is caught by Schultz. Kinchloe has tapped Klink's phone line; a Captain Milheiser from the Adolf Hitler Division called. Newkirk sees a vehicle column; Carter sees a panzer column. Back in the barracks, they talk about what happened. Newkirk and Kinch re-enact Klink's phone call, Newkirk impersonating Klink.

In Klink's office, Schultz is reading an inventory of food. Klink tells Schultz to find 500 wooden plates. Helga comes in and says that two officers from the Adolf Hitler Division are here to see Klink. The two officers, Captain Milheiser and Lieutenant Schmidt, come in and sit down. Schmidt says that he is the chair of the charity organization 'Beautify Berchtesgarten'. He asks Klink for monetary help; he says that he got Klink's name from the artillery. Milheiser shows Klink two lists, one white and one black; those who have given and those who have not given. Schultz says a list of 5000 plates, he says '5000'; Klink says '5000?' Milheiser puts Klink down for 5000 Marks, by the first of the month.

Down in the tunnel, Hogan gets a message asking for information on the Adolf Hitler Division; where they are going and other information.

At Hilda's Hofbrau, by a crossroads, Hogan goes into the place as a Luftwaffe officer, Major Hoople. He asks to sit down with two officers; they happen to be Captain Milheiser and Lieutenant Schmidt. They ask Hogan about the Luftwaffe uniform, as there are not Luftwaffe units in the area. Hogan/Hoople refers to STALAG 13. They talk about Klink for a bit; Milheiser says that Klink is jelly, Hogan/Hoople agrees. Hogan tries to get information as to where they are going; he talks about conditions in a cold weather area and having to defrost toothpaste with a blowtorch. Milheiser does not say where they are going, but let us say they are not moving west. Hogan/Hoople gives a toast to long woolen underwear; the other 2 drink with him. Milheiser then talks about the 'Beautify Berchtesgarten' fund. Hogan/Hoople gives them some money. Schmidt asks where he got the new bills; Hogan/Hoople says that he has men make them up. They all laugh.

Back at camp, Hogan gives Kinch a message to send, that the Adolf Hitler Division may be heading to the Russian front; will confirm and provide more information.

Back at Hilda's Hofbrau, Newkirk and Carter are waiters and LeBeau is a cook. Hogan is there again as a major. Carter and Newkirk are getting information; Newkirk says that an officer mentioned big guns to his girlfriend, and Carter saw skis in a backpack. Hogan tells them to stay with it. Schultz comes in and sits down. Newkirk gets nervous, and sits with a soldier and a woman. Schultz asks for cheese and beer from the waiter, who is Carter. Carter tries to walk away, but Schultz stops him. Then Schultz see, Carter, then Newkirk and LeBeau. Hogan comes up to Schultz; Schultz asks why they are here. Hogan refers to Hilda, a widow with 8 children. She can't get much help, and he gives her a sob story. Schultz wants them to go back to camp. Hogan blackmails Schultz; he says that he will have to tell Klink that they escaped on his watch. Schultz tells him to being the beer and food outside; it is easier for him to know nothing. They apparently stay for a while.

It is now the first of the month, Milheiser and Schmidt come to Klink asking for the money for the fund. Milheiser tells Klink to be at Hilda's Hofbrau that evening with the money. When they leave, Klink asks Schultz to get 5000 marks. Klink is resigned to go to Hilda's and confess that he does not have the money.

Schultz tells Hogan about Klink going to Hilda's Hofbrau. Hogan is surprised and worried; the men left for Hilda's an hour ago. He tells Schultz to stall Klink, that he will think of something.

In Klink's quarters, Klink starts to leave, while Schultz tries to stall him. Klink says that he may not come back. They will get a new kommandant. Schultz asks what he can do to help; Klink tells Schultz he can help out to have himself transferred to another camp. Schultz puts a coat and scarf on Klink, and Klink leaves.

At Hilda's Hofbrau, Hogan and Hilda are sitting at a table, talking. Hogan wants to take the prisoners back to camp early. Klink comes in, not seen by Hogan. Carter picks up a phone, and says 'Phone call for Major Hoople'. Hogan is puzzled, but goes to the phone. Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau duck behind the bar, and point out Klink. Hogan thinks fast. He can't get them out the back door, as there is no back door; so he marches them out the front door. As he is doing that, Milheiser sees Hogan/Hoople, and calls him over. Klink sees him, and wants to know what is going on. Hogan/Hoople says that he is taking a work detail back to camp. Klink calls him 'Hogan'; Hogan says that that is his first name, 'Hogan Hoople'. When Klink mentions that he was not able to go to the bank to get the money, Hogan/Hoople says that Klink sent him to the bank. Hogan/Hoople gives Milheiser 5000 Marks; Klink looks surprised. Milheiser asks Hogan/Hoople to stay for a beer; Hogan/Hoople says that he has a prisoner of war camp to run. Klink looks disgusted at what he said.

At the end, Klink, Hogan, and Schultz are in Klink's office. Klink says that Hogan will get 30 days in the cooler for what he did. Schultz is to get court-martialled. Hogan says that they worked at Hilda's Hofbrau to get the 5000 Marks. Schultz was standing guard outside. Klink is somewhat placated by the excuse. Hogan and Schultz leave. Schultz asks Hogan how he got the money. Hogan says that it was made by native craftsmen. Schultz, thinking that the money may be counterfeit (which it was), says Milheiser and Schmidt could spend the rest of the war in chains. Hogan says that we can only hope, and walks off."

Bowman Industries. Hogan does not recognize him; he wants to know what is going on. Hogan tells LeBeau to get to listening post 3. LeBeau goes to Klink's office and starts a commotion with Carter, Newkirk, and Kinchloe. During the commotion, Newkirk opens the safe and puts LeBeau inside, then closes the door. Corporal Langenscheidt is guarding them and tells them to stop the commotion. Klink then comes back to the office and tells Helga that they are not to be disturbed. Burkhalter, Klink, and Bowman go inside Klink's office, this is a top secret matter. Burkhalter says that the allies will not bomb a POW camp. They are going to put a synthetic fuel plant at STALAG 13. Burkhalter tells Klink that the prisoners will be moved to other camps. Burkhalter, Klink, and Bowman leave the office. Newkirk, Carter, and Kinch come back in, open the safe, and let LeBeau out.

Later in the barracks, Hogan and the men are talking about the conversations. There is talk about moving to a new camp. Hogan tells Kinch to get a message to London. Schultz comes in, and tells Hogan that Klink wants to see him.

In Klink's office, Hogan is talking with Klink about a move to new camps. Hogan says that Bowman looked like a real estate salesman. Klink says that the men are to be moved in 3 days. Hogan has a picture of Klink, and asks for his autograph - something to remember him by. Hogan suggests that Klink will be going into combat. Hogan talks about the 'Iron Eagle' (referring to Klink) dropping his eggs in the snow. Hogan says that Moscow is not the Riviera. Klink says that he is not qualified to fly the new planes. Hogan says that he will pick it up soon enough. He asks Klink if Burkhalter told him the details of the new camp. Just then, Burkhalter comes in. Hogan asks him questions about the move. Hogan asks Burkhalter about the details of the new camp. Burkhalter says that he will find out soon enough. Which camp are they moving to? That has not yet been determined. How will the men be protected from the civilian populace? Not Hogan's concern. Burkhalter wants to know why Hogan is questioning him.

That night, Carter, Newkirk, and LeBeau come out of a tunnel under the water tower, They see Schultz and make a noise to get his attention. Schultz captures them trying to escape. They are taken to Klink's office. Hogan says that this try was not known by the escape committee. Klink tells Schultz to put them in solitary for 30 days. As they are about to leave, Klink looks at their faces and sees that they are grimy, not just dirty. He asks what is on their faces. Klink tells Carter to raise his hand; Carter holds his hand up, and Klink looks at it and sees oil. Carter says that there is plenty of oil down there; Hogan tells him to be quiet. Schultz takes Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau away; Hogan stays. Hogan tells Klink it is a broken pipeline; Klink does not believe him. Hogan then tells Klink that STALAG 13 was built over an oil field. Hogan tells Klink that an engineer looked at it before being transferred to STALAG 9; he was also a geologist. He tells Klink that there is enough oil down there for 10 millionaires. Klink smiles and talks about 'The Klink and Hogan Oil Company'. Hogan suggests adding Burkhalter's name. Klink asks why. Hogan says that we need to give him a piece of the pie, or else there won't be any.

Klink goes to his quarters, and tells Burkhalter about the oil. Burkhalter says that an oil discovery might upset the entire economy and wants to keep it quiet. Burkhalter says that they do not need Hogan.

The next day, Klink, Burkhalter, and Bowman are in Klink's office. They talk about not building the synthetic fuel plant here. Bowman is holding out; he wants the plant built here.

Hogan talks to London on the radio. He requests a fake bombing mission, Have the B-17s drop leaflets, not bombs, He tells London what the leaflets are to say.

Later, B-17 bombers are seen taking off, and make a bombing run over STALAG 13, dropping the leaflets. The leaflets say that this is a sample of what you will get if you build the synthetic fuel plant there. Burkhalter says that this finishes any plans for building the plant at STALAG 13, security has been broken. Klink suspects Hogan, but Hogan says that he only works here.

At the end, Kogan and Klink are outside of Klink's office. Klink says that Hogan deliberately poured oil to make them think that there was oil underground. Hogan says that he saved Klink, that he would be going east by now. Klink asks about Burkhalter, knowing about the oil. Hogan says that he will not do anything until after the war. Klink asks what happens if Germany wins the war? Hogan says 'Impossible. You can't win a war without oil'."

Hogan wakes up Newkirk and says that we need a diversion. Newkirk, still in his nightclothes, goes 'sleepwalking' in the compound, eyes closed and arms out front, 'sleepwalker' style. He is seen by Schultz, who follows him around a bit, and then sounds the alarm, and the guard dogs are let out. While this is going on, LeBeau sneaks out through the raising fence gate. Three of the dogs go to LeBeau; he chases two of them, Bismarck and Kaiser, away. He then goes out into the woods to dig mushrooms. Shortly later, he is caught by two Americans, Braden and Mills, who at first think that he is a German. He convinces them that he is French, and from STALAG 13. Mills whistles, and other prisoners appear, 18 more, 20 in total.

Later, they are in-processed in the barracks. Corporal Walter Cominski and Sergeant John Walter are two who come up into the barracks. Hogan did not expect 20 to show up at the same time; he tells Kinchloe to radio for a BIG submarine. Hogan wants to outfit them in civilian clothes, just like other escapees. Carter takes pictures of each individual for identity cards, and Newkirk measures them for clothes.

While this is going on, Klink gets a phone call in his office. Twenty prisoners had escaped from STALAG 9. Klink wants to call the Kommandant of STALAG 9, but it is a long distance call to Russia, implying that the kommandant had been transferred to the Russian front after the escape. Schultz brings Hogan into Klink's office for a chat. Klink tells Hogan about the STALAG 9 escape. Hogan puts cigar ashes in the spike of Klink's helmet; Klink does not like that. Klink says that he is watching Hogan, and things have been quiet recently; Klink is thinking that something is up.

That night in the barracks, Braden wakes up Mills; he has a plan to escape in the water truck.

Next day, Hogan asks Kinch about the submarine, Newkirk about the clothes, and LeBeau about the pictures. As they are working the plans, Braden and Mills go to the water truck; Hogan sees them, and wants to stop them. Hogan tells Schultz about two men in the water truck (without naming names). After some discussion, Schultz finally believes him; Schultz and another guard go to the water truck and pull them out. Other prisoners gather around to form a mob to get them out; Braden and Mills get away, and Hogan tells them to go to his office. Two other prisoners, who are not named, come in as Hogan requested, and Hogan pours water on them. Klink appears; he thinks that the two other prisoners are the ones who tried to escape, and gives them 30 days in the cooler. After Klink leaves, Hogan talks to Braden and Mills; After some discussion about their escape attempt, he says that they will move out tonight. LeBeau wants to punch Braden and Mills in the nose for what they tried.

Later, in the barracks, a prisoner is shaving at the sink. Hogan comes in, Newkirk and Carter are playing cards at the table. Hogan asks about the new tunnel entrance. Newkirk wants Hogan to try to find it; if he can't find it, the Germans probably can't. Hogan looks around for the entrance, gives up and asks them where it is. The entrance is under the sink. The prisoner shaving moves aside, and the sink stand hinges over to reveal the new tunnel entrance.

Later, the men to escape are in civilian clothes. Hogan tells LeBeau to get them through the new hole. The men go down the hole, and wait at the other end for clearance to leave. LeBeau opens up the hatch in the tree stump entrance, and sees 2 guards with 2 guard dogs close outside; he quickly closes the hatch and passes the word to Hogan. Hogan says that they will trade the Germans one end of the tunnel for the other. Hogan tells Newkirk and Carter to go out the tunnel, and give themselves up. Hogan tells Braden to wait for two stomps on the floor, and then leave. Carter, Newkirk, and LeBeau go out through the tunnel, and give up to the guards. One guard fires a shot, and searchlights move to the area. The camp goes on alert. Klink goes to a motorcycle sidecar, still getting dressed, putting his uniform coat over his white undershirt, having trouble with his boots. The dogs are let out. Klink goes out the gate on the motorcycle, still trying to put his boots on. Klink arrives at where Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau were caught. Newkirk says that the tunnel started in Hut 3.

Klink gets back on the motorcycle and goes to Hut 3, still having trouble with his boots. He wants to know what is going on, and stomps his foot twice, trying to get a boot on; that is the signal for Braden to leave. Hogan wants to cancel that order; but the men go out the tunnel without attracting attention of the guards, who are busy with the three 'escapees'. Klink refers to a helicopter; Hogan says that they are waiting for spare parts. Klink says that the prisoners will fill the tunnel that night. Their punishment is hard labor, and then the next day more measures will be taken. Hogan says 'You can't win them all, but you can try'. While this was going on, the escapees got away.

At the end, Hogan is in Klink's outer office with Helga. Newkirk comes in dirty and grimy, says that the tunnel is filled in. Schultz comes in, wants to talk to Klink. Klink comes out, Schultz says that the tunnel is filled in. Klink gives all men 30 days in the cooler. Klink wants Hogan to parade the men and join them in the cooler. Hogan tell him that somebody has to warm up the helicopter."

They are caught by Schultz; LeBeau runs off and comes back. LeBeau says that a truck is coming. The truck comes to a certain location and stops. Captain Michaels comes up, and says that supplies are in back. Hogan, LeBeau, and Michaels go back to camp; Hogan tells Schultz to hide the truck.

In Klink's office, Klink talks to Hogan with Schultz there. Klink refers to 'Captain Michaels', a prisoner at STALAG 5. Klink wants to keep the prisoners busy. Hogan says that the men are kept busy, Schultz agrees. Klink says that Michaels vanished, truck and all. He says that Michaels is in this vicinity, and puts Schultz in charge of finding the truck.

Back in the barracks, Hogan gets a radio message from London. They are to pick up Michaels and 'item'. They can't use the submarine, as there are too many guards outside searching for Michaels. Hogan has an idea.

Hogan goes to Klink's office; he talks to Helga in the outer office. Helga knocks on Klink's door and lets Hogan in. Hogan goes to a standing cabinet with a decanter on top, and gives Klink some schnapps, telling Klink that he looks tired. Klink has been supervising the search for Michaels around the clock. Hogan tells Klink that he has combat fatigue. He tells Klink that they have an officers' club at STALAG 5, and convinces Klink to have one at STALAG 13. Hogan has a design in mind, his decor man is LeBeau.

A few days later, outside, LeBeau is telling the Germans what to do regarding building the 'officers club', which is actually a boat. Schultz asks why they are building a boat, and asks Hogan how to get it out of camp. Klink comes up and starts talking; he orders an officers' club, and gets a boat; he says that they are 60 miles from the North Sea. Hogan butters up Klink regarding the boat.

Kinchloe gets a message on the radio saying that the weather for the week will be bad. The boat has to leave tonight. Klink wants to give a party tomorrow.

Klink goes into his office wearing a yacht club smoking jacket and a captain's hat. He asks Helga how she likes it, and she has 'no words' for it. Klink sings to Helga, but she does not like it. Klink kisses her hand; she tells him that he is really dreaming.

Klink talks to Hogan about the party. Hogan needs Klink's approval to load the boat with caviar and champagne. Klink says it is hard to think of Hogan as the enemy. Hogan gives a reference to General Burkhalter; Klink says that he did not invite Burkhalter. Hogan talks him into inviting Burkhalter. Klink has Helga make a phone call.

Later, Carter goes to Klink's office. He was at STALAG 5 with Kommandant Vogel. He said that Vogel had an officers' club, but Burkhalter said that it was too fancy. Carter has a hard time pronouncing 'Burhhalter', and stumbles 3 times. Klink's officers' club is fancier than Vogel's. Klink decides that he does not want the boat as an officers' club. Klink leaves the office, leaving Carter alone in the office; Carter tries on Klink's pickelhelb helmet. It fits.

Klink goes outside to the boat and talks with Hogan; he wants the ship demolished. LeBeau suggests a fire, but Klink says no. Klink tells Hogan to get rid of the boat. Newkirk asks some questions; Hogan asks Newkirk if someone told him that he makes great officer material; Newkirk is insulted. Klink asks if the boat is seaworthy; Hogan says that it had better be. Klink says to move the boat to water.

Klink brings 10 guards and Sergeant Kristman to get Hogan to move the boat. Hogan wants to get a life raft in there first. Two men of the German squad try to lift it, but can't. Then the whole squad lifts the raft into the boat. Michaels is in the life raft, which makes it so heavy; but the Germans do not know that. Hogan hooks the trailer that the boat is on to a truck. Hogan gets in the truck and starts it. Klink does not want Hogan driving the truck, as he thinks this is an escape attempt, so he orders Hogan out of the truck. He orders Kristman to take the boat to water. One guard gets in the truck and starts towing the boat away at a walking pace; other guards are walking beside the boat, similar to an honor guard escort. They take the boat out the gate.

At the end, coming out of Klink's office, Burkhalter thanks Klink for a dinner of stale sauerbrauten. Burkhalter gets in his car and leaves. Hogan comes into camp driving a truck; he says that this is the one that Michaels stole. Klink tells Schultz to get the dogs to the special detail; he says that Michaels is out there waiting for Klink to capture him."

Carter comes out, taps Schultz on the shoulder; this scares Schultz. Carter asks Schultz for a light for his cigarette; Schultz looks for a light, gives Carter his rifle, then gives him a light. Schultz does not worry about giving Carter his rifle as it is not loaded. Carter goes back in the barracks; as he closes the door, a pile of snow from the roof falls on Schultz.

Back in the barracks, Hogan gets a message from London. There will be a probing raid, not a full-scale invasion. They need information on troop movements. This is a reconnaissance job. Hogan needs someone with guts, who can move fast. Hogan volunteers LeBeau. LeBeau says that that is how he got married.

Later, LeBeau is dressed up as an old woman, looking at a nearby German camp from the woods. He takes notes of what he sees. He then comes back to camp. Hogan tries to call the submarine with the information, but Kinchloe says that their radio may be shut down because of the impending operation. At Schmeckhausen, 15 miles away, there are 12 guns, all German 88-mm guns. Hogan gets an idea how to get the information out. Hogan says that LeBeau mentioned Adolf Hitler's birthday. Hogan tells Kinch to get a motorcycle with a sidecar, and tells Carter to get two German uniforms.

Hogan, dressed as German Captain Hoganburg, and LeBeau, dressed as his assistant Corporal Hooplemann, go to see artillery Major Keitel in charge of the guns at Schmeckhausen. There is some discussion as to what will be done for Hitler's birthday. Keitel makes a phone call; Kinch and Newkirk intercept the call. Newkirk, impersonating a German officer, asks to speak to Hoganburg; he tells him to bring a case of wine. Hoganburg/Hogan tells Keitel of STALAG 13 nearby. He suggests that they borrow prisoners to do work for the party. On leaving, Hogan tells Keitel that 'Hooplemann' is his wife's brother.

Later, in Klink's outer office, Klink is kissing Helga. He invites Helga to a party. Helga asks where; Hogan says Schmeckhausen. Helga says that there is nothing in Schmeckhausen. Hogan says that there will be a party there. Helga asks who for; Hogan says it is for Hitler's birthday. Helga acts disappointed, and gives a half-hearted salute with her right hand. Hogan convinces her to invite some of her girlfriends to go to Schmeckhausen for the party.

Keitel calls Klink about using prisoners for the party. Hogan is listening in to a part of the conversation at Klink's closed office door. Klink comes out and asks Helga to call Hogan. Hogan is right there, which surprises Klink. Hogan goes into Klink's office and asks for additional hours of light, as it is Hitler's birthday. Hogan asks for 2 hours extra light in the evening; Klink says no, that the prisoners will use the light to build a tunnel. Hogan says that the tunnel is done, but they are building an elevator now. During the discussion, he puts Klink's pickelhelb helmet on Klink's chair while he is not looking. Klink talks about a party in Schmeckhausen, and asks for prisoners to help at the party. After some discussion Hogan deals with Klink for 1 hour of extra light and 2 ball games. Klink says that he will find the tunnel. Hogan leaves. On the way out, he reminds Helga to not forget the girls for the party. They hear Klink scream, apparently as he sits on his spiked helmet.

Later, at the party site, Newkirk tells Schultz that they are finished. There is a Nazi flag draped on the wall. Schultz counts the prisoners going into the truck. As they go into the back of the truck, Carter and others go out the front and come around to be counted again; this messes up Schultz's count.

Hogan, LeBeau, and 6 other prisoners are in German uniform. They go to the party area where Keitel is. Hogan says that he has orders to relieve Keitel, and Keitel is to go to the party. Keitel wants to still be in command at the guns. Helga and another woman in party dresses walk by; Keitel, after watching the girls, changes his mind and goes to the party with the girls. After Keitel leaves, Hogan and the men work on the guns.

Later, back at camp, LeBeau pours Hogan some wine. Hogan, Klink, and Schultz are in Klink's office drinking. LeBeau tells Hogan that the wine is almost vinegar. Klink asks Hogan where prisoners of war get wine. Hogan responds 'Does Macy tell Gimbel?' Hogan, at that time pretending to be partially drunk, tells a joke about a farmer and a farmer's daughter, which falls flat. There will be a roll call in the morning.

Early the next morning, while the party is still going on, there are scenes of planes passing by, landing craft landing troops, and paratroops dropping from planes. An air raid warning is sounded at the party; the men go to the guns. Keitel is taking ranges on the airplanes. He gives a gunner the range of 1500 yards and deflection information, the gunner answers. When they are supposedly on target, Keitel gives the 'fire' command. When six of the guns are fired, a flag pops out of the end of each with 'Happy Birthday Adolph'. Keitel doesn't believe what is happening, bangs a gun with his fist, and says 'schweinhund' several times.

At the end, Keitel and Klink are in Klink's office talking. Hogan and Helga are in the outer office, listening. Klink is arguing with Keitel about the prisoners' involvement with the sabotage of the guns. Klink insists that they did not do it. Keitel tells Klink that the prisoners did a good job at the party, and leaves. Klink goes to the outer office, and tells Hogan that the working party did a good job at the party. Klink then tells Hogan about camp buildings needing cleaning. Hogan denies the requests, and asks for 2 extra hours of light and some bread. He bargains with Klink as Helga watches the back and forth discussion."

Out of the back jumps a new prisoner, Captain Martin, who was recently shot down. Klink comes out, and berates Schultz for being 2 hours late. Hogan and the men see this, and then go into the barracks. They want to listen in on the conversation. Klink takes Martin into his office.

In Klink's office, it is mentioned that Martin was captured by a farmer, turned over to the Gestapo, and assigned to STALAG 13. Schultz says that he was late because he was held up because of gold bars being shipped to Dusseldorf. There was a brief discussion of the bars being 'stolen' vs. being 'confiscated'.

Hogan and the men are listening on the coffee pot to the conversation. Hogan has heard enough and pulls the plug on the coffee pot; the men know what Klink is going to be saying next. Kinchloe impersonates Klink saying 'No one has ever escaped from STALAG 13' and a few other things. Hogan tells the men that he wants to take the gold out of circulation. Kinch pulls down a map from the side of a bunk, and Hogan looks at it. He has Kinch write up a message to send to London: Approach from the north, avoid anti-aircraft batteries, target the bank. Hogan then says that Klink will be calling for him shortly.

In Klink's office, Klink is dictating a letter to Helga, Schultz comes in and says that Hogan wants to see Klink. Hogan comes in, and asks Martin how he likes it. Before he can answer, Klink interrupts; he talks about the cooler. Hogan then picks up Martins packet, and drops it on the floor. As he picks it up, he puts a paper in it, the message that he had Kinch write up. He also takes out a one-eye kaleidoscope viewer and looks in it. Klink asks what it is. Hogan responds 'You know that picture of Washington crossing the Delaware, well this ain't it'. As he is looking in the viewer, Klink picks up Martin's packet, and reads a message (the one that Hogan put in it). Klink says that the bombing is a diversion, and there was going to be a commando drop to steal the gold. Hogan convinces Klink to call the Gestapo to offer to keep the gold at STALAG 13. Klink dismisses Hogan and Martin.

Later, Hogan and the men are cleaning the porch of Klink's office. Schultz comes by and asks what they are doing. Hogan tells Schultz that they volunteered, they want to tidy up the camp. Klink comes out and asks what is going on. Schultz tries to explain. Klink tells the men to carry on, and goes back into his office. The men keep cleaning, while whistling the Hogan's Heroes theme song. While this is going on, LeBeau is quietly sawing a cut in the brace of one of the steps.

Shortly later, the men are watching Klink's porch from in front of the barracks. Schultz walks down the steps; they do not collapse. LeBeau says that he thought he sawed it through enough. Then Klink comes out of his office, steps on a step, and they collapse. Hogan and the men go to Klink to help him up. Hogan says that termites have eaten through the steps. Carter starts telling a story about an uncle with a wooden leg, and what the termites did to that leg. Hogan interrupts him; he tells Klink that they will re-build the steps. But not with wood; the termites would just eat that through also. Hogan convinces Klink to rebuild the steps with bricks.

A van led by a motorcycle with a sidecar comes into STALAG 13.

Major Krieger, Gestapo, gets out of the sidecar. He thanks Klink for offering STALAG 13 as a site to keep the gold temporarily. Klink tells Schultz to guide the truck behind barracks 5. As it is going back there, LeBeau and Carter start stringing a clothesline, and Schultz backs into it. This stops Schultz and the truck. Newkirk throws a dart from inside the barracks into the truck tire, and the tire pops and goes flat. Krieger wants the flat repaired, but the guards say that with the weight of the gold, they can not jack up the truck. Krieger tells Klink to post a guard while they are fixing the flat. Krieger opens the side door of the truck to get some papers, and closes it. As it is closing, Newkirk puts a plastic marker in front of the latch to keep the door from locking.

That evening, Schultz is taking a coffee pot past the barracks. He is going to give it to the two Gestapo guards guarding the truck. Newkirk and LeBeau stop him and start talking to him. When a spotlight goes by, Schultz covers Newkirk and LeBeau. Newkirk and LeBeau suggest to Schultz that he grab a few gold bars. Schultz says that the gold was 'confiscated' from the Bank of France, it was not 'stolen'. As they are talking, Newkirk puts some pills in the spout of the coffee pot. These turn out to be sleeping pills. After the conversation, Schultz continues on, and goes to the truck with the coffee pot. He talks to the guards in German, and pours them some coffee; they thank him for it. After a few minutes, the sleeping pills take effect, and the guards fall asleep.

Newkirk and Carter take the guards in through the barrack's window, take their uniforms, and put them in bunks, still asleep. Hogan tells Newkirk to remember to open the door of the truck. Newkirk and Carter then stand guard on the truck in Gestapo uniforms. LeBeau goes in the truck, and starts passing boxes of the gold to other prisoners, who form a chain to pass the boxes down into the tunnel. Krieger comes by and asks how things are going. This is night, and Krieger can not see their faces. Newkirk says a few words, supposedly in German, and Krieger leaves. Carter says that he didn't know that Newkirk spoke German; Newkirk says that neither did he, until now.

Down in the tunnel, the gold bricks are taken out of the boxes, and dipped in brick-colored paint, while bricks are dipped in gold-colored paint. LeBeau holds one of each up in front of Hogan and asks him which is real. Hogan says 'Eenig, meeney, miney, .... money' and points to one brick; LeBeau says no, it is the other one. When the work is done, the gold-painted bricks are put in the boxes, and they are passed up through the tunnel, where a chain again passes them out to the truck. When they are all put back, Newkirk and Carter come back in, put the Gestapo uniforms back on the guards, and take the guards out to the truck, where they put them lying against the truck, sleeping, Hogan comes by and wakes one of the guards; Hogan says that he was sleeping on duty, and is lucky an officer didn't catch him. This guard then wakes the other guard, and says that he is lucky an officer didn't catch him.

The next day, the men are re-building the steps with bricks; actually the gold bricks that were dipped in the brick-colored paint. LeBeau says that they are running out of bricks; Hogan tells him to go to the 'bank' and get more 'bricks'. As they are doing this, Krieger, the Gestapo guards, and the truck leave camp.

Klink thanks the men for building the steps. Hogan says that the steps are as good as gold, and the men cheer.

At the end, Klink and Krieger are in Klink's office. Krieger says that the gold is missing and may be at STALAG 13. Klink tells Krieger to search. He says 'If you find any gold, use this rifle to shoot me', and he takes Schultz's rifle. Klink then hands the rifle to Hogan, and Krieger goes to search. Hogan says that he would like to sit this one out."

They want to know what is going on. LeBeau looks out through the sink periscope. A German general with a bunch of medals has arrived. He seems to be an old friend of Klink's, and they hug. Kinchloe tells Hogan that a German general has arrived. The general, General Stoffle of the Africa Korps, and Klink go into Klink's office. Stoffle drinks a toast to Klink, who was two grades ahead of him in school, and now is two grades behind him. Stoffle calls Klink 'Putzi'. Klink says that he arranged a luncheon at the Officers' Club. Stoffle says that the allies would give anything to know where he is. Hogan and the men are listening in on the coffee pot. Hogan tells Kinchloe to radio London on the general's location.

They get a radio message from London back. London wants Hogan to keep the general at STALAG 13 for a while; no suggestions on how.

LeBeau looks out the sink periscope again, and sees Stoffle in the back of his staff car, supposedly sleeping. Hogan wants to bring Stoffle to the barracks, then take him down the tunnel, and take him to England for the duration. Hogan says that they need a diversion; he has Newkirk and Carter to call Schultz to the barracks. Schultz comes into the barracks. Newkirk and Carter have a guessing game with Schultz trying to guess his weight. He ultimately says 295 pounds. While they are doing this, Hogan and LeBeau go to the staff car to get the general. They open the back door, and see a fraulein in the back seat; this is the general's girlfriend. Just then, a Gestapo major comes in through the front gate in his staff car. The fraulein goes to Klink's office; Stoffle wants private quarters for them.

The Gestapo major starts to unload equipment from a truck. He shows Klink a listening device; then a large flashlight which can blind anybody at a certain range, and use the back of it to crack skulls. Hogan comes to Klink's office; he tells the Gestapo that they won't find what they are looking for - the general's girlfriend. Hogan says that the girl has been seen constantly with Himmler. Hogan tells Klink to not let the Gestapo leave early; Klink would surely be implicated. Hogan offers LeBeau to supply food and drink, and entertain them in Klink's quarters. Hogan says that they have to keep the Gestapo busy.

The Gestapo major, Major Zolle, tells two of his men to go to the warehouse. He asks Schultz about a wireless radio; Schultz has a shovel and wires. Klink is nervous; Schultz follows Zolle. Zolle uses the device to find tunnels; he thinks he finds one, and tells Schultz to dig. Schultz digs, and hits something. Zolle leans over it to take a look. Kinch and Carter are watching from beside the barracks. Kinch tells Carter to 'Fire when ready, Gridley;. Carter turns a valve, and water gushes up the 'tunnel' opening, spraying Zolle in the face and all over.

In Klink's quarters, Stoffle and his girlfriend are having a meal, with LeBeau serving. LeBeau puts pills in the general's drink, and gives the two drinks to the general and his girlfriend. Stoffle switches glasses with the girlfriend, and they drink up. She falls asleep; the intention was to have Stoffle fall asleep.

The two Gestapo guards go to a warehouse with Newkirk and Carter. The Gestapo climb up on boxes to inspect a vent, with Carter holding a light. When they get up to the vent, Carter puts the light out, walks out, and pulls a rope which is attached to the boxes. The Gestapo fall, and Newkirk and Carter take some of their equipment.

In the mean time, Zolle finds something with his device, something on the other side of the ceiling. He breaks through the wood ceiling, into the floor of the warehouse above. The Gestapo guards think that someone is escaping, so one of them hits Zolle on the head and knocks him out and down. The guard realizes that it was Zolle after he has done it.

In Klink's quarters, the girlfriend is knocked out on the sofa while the general is pacing. Hogan comes in and silently asks LeBeau what happened. LeBeau tries to explain with gestures that the glasses were switched, and she got knocked out instead of him. Hogan then comes in the room, and asks Stoffle if he is ready for lunch. Stoffle says to bring cars. Hogan tells Stoffle that Himmler is crazy about the girlfriend. Hogan convinces Stoffle to put on a prisoner uniform in order to get out of camp with the Gestapo there. LeBeau says that Stoffle is a size 44 regular.

Zolle and the other Gestapo guards go to the barracks, and he says that the holiday is over. Zolle and another Gestapo approach a prisoner and start talking to him. While he is talking to a prisoner, Hogan tells Schultz about a 'defector', in the back of Klink's car. Klink comes up and asks what is going on. Schultz opens the door, and sees Stoffle in a prisoner uniform. Zille catches the 'defector'; Stoffle insists that he is General Stoffle. Zolle takes Stoffle away. Klink turns to hogan and says that there is something diabolical about Hogan; Hogan says that he knows.

At the end, in Klink's office, Klink says that Hogan will get 30 days in the cooler. Klink says that there was a big offensive in the desert. The allies got through with Stoffle not being there. Hogan says that Klink was lucky; Stoffle would have talked Klink into being a tank commander. Hogan then tells Klink that Klink was brilliant at the way he got rid of the Gestapo. Klink gives Hogan a cigar. and a light; Hogan says 'Danke'."

LeBeau is watching while the rest play poker. Schultz says that he is temporarily out of funds, and asks for forbearance based on his integrity. Hogan hesitates, and asks for information. Schultz tells the men that yesterday, a small bridge was blown up. They continue play; the camera shows Schultz holding a full house. He wants to bet more, but he does not have the money. Hogan asks for some more information. The night before, a barn was set on fire. At the end of the hand, Schultz thinks that won with his full house; Hogan says that he got lucky, and drew two more kings; he has 4 kings, which beats Schultz's full house. Hogan tells Schultz that he is lousy at poker, but a wonderful traitor.

That night, Hogan and LeBeau meet 4 supposedly Underground agents in a barn, 3 men and 1 woman. After talking for a minute, bombs are heard dropping. B-24 bombers are dropping bombs in the area. Hogan says that they are better outside, and takes the woman outside, and they get cozy in a nearby trench.

The next day in Klink's office, a Gestapo captain in a gray uniform visits Klink. This is the same man that was one of the Underground agents that met with Hogan the day before. The captain points out on a map the sabotage that has been happening in the area. He asks Klink what is in the center of the area? STALAG 13. There are partisans operating in the area. He says that he was impersonating an Underground agent and met with some of them last night.. He tells Klink that he will lead the band into a trap. Hogan and the men are listening in on the coffee pot. Hogan recognizes the voice of the Gestapo man as the Underground agent that he met the night before. The Gestapo captain says that the only strategic target in the area that has not been hit yet is a railroad tunnel. Hogan, listening in, asks why they haven't hit it yet. Carter says that they have not gotten to it yet. Hogan says that they are going to blow it up now.

That night, at the barn, Hogan meets the 'Underground agents' again. He says that they will hit STALAG 13. There will be many prisoners running around and tying up troops trying to find them. He asks the Underground leader for dynamite. Hogan and LeBeau leave the barn, the female agent follows them, then talks to Hogan. She talks about the operation; Hogan, knowing that she is in cahoots with the Gestapo, plays hard to get. She suggests that they get out of Germany. She suggests getting close, but Hogan says no, he doesn't want to get close to anybody in the war. She leaves, and goes back into the barn. LeBeau then talks to Hogan a bit.

The next day, in camp, Schultz is guarding a warehouse, but is sleeping by the door. The Gestapo captain comes by and wakes him up. He gives Schultz a requisition for some dynamite and leaves. Hogan comes up to Schultz; Hogan thinks that the Gestapo captain may have recognized him. Schultz wonders about the dynamite, and goes into the warehouse. There he sees LeBeau, Carter, and 4 other unnamed prisoners taking dynamite out of the building through a tunnel. Hogan tells Schultz that some of the dynamite is bad and they are replacing it with some that is underneath. Schultz sees this and says that in war he does not want to take sides, but he wants to report this. Hogan reminds Schultz about the poker game.

In Klink's office, the Gestapo captain tells Klink that the Underground will be attacking STALAG 13 tonight. They will dynamite the guard towers, but the dynamite is not real. He shows Klink a shortwave radio, and tells Klink to listen to the radio; it is to be manned at all times. He then leaves. Hogan comes into Klink's office, and protests the usage of prisoners to load munitions. Klink does not care. He orders all prisoners confined to the barracks tonight. Hogan sees the short wave set, and asks Klink if he is setting up a command post. Klink says that Hogan will see the other side of Klink tonight. Klink coyly gives Hogan permission to peek even though he is confined to barracks. Hogan says that he can't stand the sight of blood, and leaves.

That night, Hogan, Carter, and LeBeau go to the barn where they meet the 'Underground' agents. Hogan talks about a change in plans, they will hit the railroad tunnel instead. The lead 'agent' says that he wants to check the munitions, giving an excuse to leave and call Klink about the change in plans. Hogan leaves the barn, the woman and the other two 'agents' follow. The lead 'agent' calls Klink on the radio, but can't get him. Kinch and Newkirk are on a radio, with Kinch impersonating Klink. They talk with the lead 'agent' about the change in plans.

In Klink's office, Schultz keeps trying to get somebody on the radio but can't. He finally finds what the problem is: wires on the radio have been cut. Klink says that this means that the attackers are already in camp.

In the railroad tunnel, Hogan, Carter, and 3 'agents' are setting charges. Hogan leaves the tunnel and talks to the lead 'agent'. The woman agent goes to Hogan and tells him that he is Gestapo. He pulls a pistol on Hogan, and tells that the charges are fake. He presses the plunger, and blows up the tunnel. He then gets in the truck to leave. At first, it can't start; Carter suggests that he use some choke. The truck starts, and he leaves.

At STALAG 13, Klink, Schultz and 8 guards are waiting by the front gate. They hear a truck approaching. Klink says that they are the attackers, and orders open fire, and they start shooting. After several seconds, the truck crashes. Schultz says that the Gestapo captain is attacking.

Back at the tunnel, Hogan is with the woman 'agent'. He tells her that he will get her out of Germany. Hogan and the woman then kiss.

At the end, in Klink's office, Hogan and Klink are talking. Klink says that a railroad tunnel was blown up last night, and if the prisoners were not confined to barracks, he would suspect Hogan. He says that the Gestapo captain was attacking, and got shot. Hogan convinces Klink that the Gestapo was shot by the saboteurs; Klink eventually agrees. Hogan leaves the office."

Kinch is watching, and says '1, 2, 3'; when he gets to 3, Carter pushed the plunger, and there is a big explosion; the train is destroyed. After some cheering, Newkirk, Kinch, and LeBeau ask Carter which way back to camp. Carter does not know; he is lost. Kinch leaves and says that he will climb a tree to see where they are. Just after he leaves, a German patrol of 4 soldiers (1 a corporal) come up behind the others and take them away. Kinch sees this as he comes back.

Back at camp, Kinch comes up the tunnel alone, looking sad. He says nothing to Hogan and shakes his head. Hogan seems to understand.

In the basement of the Gestapo office in town, Newkirk, LeBeau, and Carter are questioned by a Gestapo officer. Carter has the papers for 'Antonio Cavelli', LeBeau the papers for 'Jock MacPherson', and Newkirk the papers for 'Heinrich Hilgenbecker'. The Gestapo officer does not believe them. He tells them that they could be shot. Newkirk says that they can't do that because they were in uniform. The Gestapo officer says that they will be taken to STALAG 4 before being taken to Berlin for further questioning.

In Klink's office, Hogan is talking to Klink and asks for movies in return for the prisoners performing Work. Klink does not know what to do and wants to call Berlin for further information. Klink then looks out the window and sees the men working; Hogan says that it is a mark of 'good faith'. Klink tries to get Berlin on the phone, but he hears a General Kinchmeyer (actually Kinchloe) on the line. He thinks that the phone lines have been crossed, so he hangs up. After hearing the attempted phone call, Hogan does not look well; he says that it is 'the old ticker'.

The next day at roll call, Schultz counts the prisoners, and there are 3 missing. Schultz wishes that there were 4 missing; him being the fourth. Hogan tells Schultz to report all present; he does so, reluctantly.

Shortly later in the barracks, Hogan explains to Schultz that Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau were out for a walk and were grabbed by the Gestapo. Hogan says that if Schultz reports it, he could by shot, or sent to the Russian front. Kinch says 'Or both'. Schultz thinks aloud how they could do that, and then says that they could do it. Hogan convinces Schultz to go to STALAG 4 as an officer to get them back. Schultz says no, leaves the barracks, and 10 seconds later, comes back in, saying he will do it. Kinch measures Schultz for a uniform; neck 19, waist 52. Schultz says the other measurements are the same as his waist. Schultz then says that he does not have the courage, and leaves. Hogan asks Kinch how much material is needed for the uniform for Schultz. Kinch says 'How may inches are in an acre?'

Later, outside Klink's office, Klink leaves the office and the guard comes to attention. Schultz is standing out front; Hogan comes up and gives him a cigarette. Kinch then gives Schultz some chocolate bars. Klink sees them give Schultz these things, and comes up to him, asking why he took those things. Klink tells Schultz to put himself on report, takes them from Schultz, and puts them in his coat and leaves. Hogan comes up to Schultz and says that if he gets on report, it becomes a part of his record. When the Gestapo adds information from the boys who were captured, Schultz goes to the Russian front. Essentially, Hogan is blackmailing Schultz.

In the barracks, Hogan is collecting money for a 'widow'. After hearing some of the conversation, Schultz thinks that it is his widow that they are collecting for, so he tries to give the money back.

Shortly later, Schultz comes out of Hogan's office in an officer's uniform. Hogan shows him what to say and how to act, using Kinch acting as the other 'kommandant'. Schultz practices, but gets it wrong. He has more practice, and he drops the monocle, and it shatters. More practice, and Schultz gets meaner. Hogan thinks he comes close.

In the compound, Hogan and Kinch make final plans for the operation. Schultz and Hogan take a truck to STALAG 4 to get the men out. Schultz is dressed as a Colonel, and Hogan as his aide, a captain.

When they get there, they go into Major Bernsdorf's office, the Kommandant of STALAG 4. Bernsdorf says that it is an honor to meet the famous Colonel Klink, and offers refreshments; Schultz drinks some schnapps, but Hogan tells him that time is limited. Schultz has Hogan give Bernsdorf the names of the prisoners he wants. Bernsdorf says that he has no authority to release those prisoners; they are there by orders of the Gestapo. Schultz demands to release the prisoners at once; Bernsdorf denies the request. Just then, there is a phone call from 'General Kinchmeyer' from the Gestapo (actually Kinchloe impersonating a general, sitting at Klink's desk making the phone call). He tells Bernsdorf to release the 3 prisoners. Bernsdorf says that he has no written authorization. 'Kinchmeyer' says release them or suffer the consequences, and hangs up. Bernsdorf has the 3 men brought to outside his office. Schultz says to put them in the truck. Carter says 'Isn't that that terrible Colonel Schultz from STALAG 13?' Hogan says 'No, that is the terrible Colonel Klink from STALAG 13'. Schultz wants to have somebody shot and sent to the Russian front. While Schultz is talking, Hogan says that Sergeant Schultz is waiting; Schultz gets the subtle message that he has to leave. All of them go into the truck. When they get into the truck, LeBeau says that Schultz did a good job at the impersonation. Schultz did not hear him; he has fainted. Hogan drives off back to STALAG 13.

At the end, back at camp, the Gestapo officer is there, inspecting the men at roll call. He says that an officer stating he was Klink came to STALAG 4 and took the prisoners. Klink says that no one in the camp left last night. The Gestapo says that the investigation will continue. After he leaves, Hogan says to Klink that the description he gave fits Schultz. Klink laughs 'Schultz an officer?' and walks off. Hogan suggests that Schultz go on a diet, just in case, Hogan then tells the men to fall out."

Carter sounds an alarm that Klink is coming. The men quickly stash the food and the preparation equipment. Klink tells Hogan and the men that they are going to have a visitor, a Major Bonacelli, who runs an Italian POW camp near Capezio, Italy. He is going to study Klink's methods of running a camp.

Later, Hogan, using the call sign 'Goldilocks' calls 'Mama Bear', a submarine, asking for information. The submarine officer says that their G-2 says that their is friction between the Germans and the Italians. There is going to be a landing near Capezio, and they want information on the German dispositions in the area.

Major Bonacelli is in a staff car with a Corporal driver going to STALAG 13. Bonacellil wants to go to Switzerland instead; the driver objects. Bonacelli pulls a pistol to try to get the driver to drive. Just then, there is a bombing raid. Several bombs drop nearby. The driver runs off into the woods. Just then, a motorcycle with a sidecar appears, Corporal Langenscheidt is in the side car. Langenscheidt says that he is the escort to STALAG 13, and asks where the driver is. Bonacelli gives an excuse that the driver ran away.

Back at the camp, some of the prisoners are playing volleyball. They coax Schultz to participate; Schultz hands his rifle to Newkirk, and starts hitting the ball. Just then Klink brings Bonacelli to meet Hogan. Bonacelli sees Newkirk with Schultz's rifle, and asks if it is policy to let prisoners carry guns. Schultz says that the rifle is not loaded; Bonacellil says that their rifles are always loaded. Langenscheidt then comes to Klink asking what to have for dinner. Bonacelli mentions some Italian foods; Klink says potato soup, names some other potato dishes, and sauerkraut. After Langenscheidt, Klink, and Bonacelli leave, Hogan says that there is a way to get to Bonacelli: food. He asks the men there if any of them knows a recipe for pizza. When they say no, Hogan asks them to ask other prisoners in the camp if they have a recipe for pizza. The men come back, not finding any. A prisoner, Garlotti, says that his father runs a pizza parlor in Newark, New Jersey, and has a recipe for pizza.

Hogan gets back on the radio, calling the submarine. He asks to put a phone call through to Garlotti's Pizzeria in Newark. The submarine officer questions this. He then calls London on the submarine radio, and makes the same request. The sergeant handling the radio talks to the supervisor, Captain Henderson, about this. Captain Henderson in London questions what is going on. When the submarine officer says that it is for 'Goldilocks', Henderson says that he should have known. Henderson then calls Garlotti's Pizzeria in Newark, He tells the owner that his son is fine, and asks for the recipe for pizza; the elder Garlotti gives it to him. Henderson relays the ingredients and instructions to the sergeant, who relays it to the submarine over the radio, who then relays it to Hogan on the other radio, who has Kinchloe write it down. Hogan then asks for the words to the song Santa Lucia. The submarine officer, sergeant, and Henderson in turn say 'Santa Lucia?' The elder Garlotti then starts singing Santa Lucia. Hogan apparently writes the words down.

Later, Bonacelli and Schultz are walking in the camp at night, Schultz asks Bonacelli if he enjoyed dinner. Bonacelli says that he couldn't eat it. They then hear prisoners singing Santa Lucia in the barracks. Bonacelli says that he wants to 'inspect the barracks, alone'. He enters the barracks and smells pizza. After some talking, Hogan has LeBeau bring out a pizza. Hogan asks Bonacelli how many pizzas might be made for the Germans, at two pizzas per soldier. Bonacelli says 106,000. A place is then rolled out on a table, and Bonacelli starts eating the pizza with wine. He asks where they got the recipe from, and is told a pizzeria in Newark. He says that he is going to go to Newark. Hogan says that that would be after the war; Bonacelli says no, during the war. He says that he does not want to go back to Italy and fight for the Germans, he wants to go to Switzerland. Hogan then asks Bonacelli to be an agent for them in Capezia. Bonacelli agrees, but he has to have the recipe for the pizza.

After he is finished with the pizza, Bonacelli and Hogan go out into the yard. Just then a motorcycle with a sidecar brings the wounded driver that ran away in the bombing raid in as a passenger. The driver confronts Bonacelli in front of Klink's office, and says he is a traitor. Klink puts Bonacelli in the cooler.

Hogan tunnels into the cooler to get Bonacelli, Bonacelli is surprised as Hogan lifts up the hatch through the hay covering the floor. He tells Bonacelli that some prisoners will 'escape' and Bonacelli will recapture them; that will get him out of the cooler. Bonacelli does not know what is happening, but follows Hogan down the tunnel.

Klink calls Berlin regarding Bonacelli being a traitor, talking to an un-named general on the phone. While he is talking, Schultz comes in and tells Klink that 10 prisoners have escaped, 11 if the Italian is included. Klink sends out an alarm, and has the guards out looking for them. After looking, Langenscheidt comes back and tells Klink that he saw no sign of the prisoners. The dog that was with him found nothing; Klink asks the dog 'You call yourself a German Shepherd?' and tells the dog that he couldn't find a can of dog food. The dog objects to the insult, and starts snarling at Klink.

Hogan and the other 'escaped' prisoners are waiting outside the camp; they can't find Bonacelli. Bonacelli finally appears, and Hogan tells him that he will march the prisoners back to camp. The prisoners then march through the gate in a column of twos whistling the Hogan's Heroes theme song. Hogan is leading the left column, Kinchloe the right column, with Carter, Newkirk, LeBeau, and 5 un-named 'extras'. Bonacelli says that he has found the prisoners. Hogan says that they had no chance, as Bonacelli is Klink's star pupil. Klink tells the prisoners that they will all get the cooler; Hogan marches the prisoners away, whistling.

At the end, Klink sends for Hogan. Klink got a letter from Bonaceili from Italy, stating that the prisoners there are working 16 hours a day making pizzas. The are currently working on 110,000, and can expect to get to 120,000. Hogan does some fast calculations in the air (divide by 2 to get the numbers of troops). Hogan then tells Klink 'Don't say the Italians aren't with you all the way.'"

They signal a plane. A parachute comes out of the middle of 3 C-119 aircraft flying over. They go get who jumped out.

Shortly later, in the tunnel, Hogan is talking, with Kinchloe on the radio talking to a submarine. Kinch is getting news, as well as mission information. The St. Louis Browns are in first place, and the bank is going to foreclose on Mary Noble. Hogan says don't tell Carter about Mary Noble. Kinch also says that the German 43rd Mobile anti-aircraft battery is at Kaiserhof. Planes are going to raid factories at that city, and they want the 43rd knocked off. Explosives are on the way. The man who jumped from the plane, Lynch, brought the explosives. When asked about the detonators, Lynch says that the explosives and detonators are always kept separate. Hogan takes Lynch's jacket, puts it on a table, rips it open, and takes out the detonators. Lynch is surprised that he was also carrying the detonators as well as the explosives.

Later, in the barracks, Hogan is talking with the men about the mission. Carter and Newkirk are in German uniforms. Carter is complaining that his does not fit. Newkirk is wearing one chevron pointing down, a Gefreiter, or Lance Corporal; Carter is a private. Hogan says to plant the explosives in the recoil mechanism. Kinchloe is watching the door; he says that Schultz is coming. Carter hides underneath blankets in a bunk, Newkirk hides behind a clothes rack, Hogan and LeBeau pretend to play a board game, with the back of the map as the game board. Schultz sees Carter in bed; Hogan says that Carter is lazy. Schultz then finds Newkirk hiding behind a clothing rack; Newkirk says that he is in a German uniform. Schultz laughs and does not believe him. Schultz tells Hogan that Klink wants to see him.

In Klink's office, Major Kuehn has arrived; he is to be Klink's new executive officer. He is temporarily second in command. Hogan comes to Klink's office and meets Kuehn. Kuehn has doubled the guards and taken more security precautions. Hogan asks why, as there have been no escapes from camp. Kuehn says that there were 293 attempts; Hogan says 291, don't give him credit for the 2 guards. Kuehs says that his uncle is Field Marshall Karl von Streicher, which brings some fear to Klink. Klink at first objected to doubling the guard as Kuehn did not notify him, but after he hears who Kuehn's uncle is, Klink 'makes the decision' to double the guard around the perimeter. Kuehn leave Klink's office. Hogan does not like Kuehn, and he can see that Klink does not either. So he gives Klink 3 choices, none of them Klink likes.

That night, down in the tunnel, Newkirk and Carter come back down panting. They say that the woods are crawling with Germans and they are lucky to get back. Hogan has Kinch radio the sub. He wants to put off the party, but the radio says 'No'. Hogan then tells Lynch to fall out in roll call; he has an idea of what he is going to do.

At roll call the next morning, Schultz counts 15, as there should be. Hogan quietly points out to Schultz that someone is going into Klink's car. Schultz goes to the car and catches Lynch. Lynch says that he was shot down and got in the car, he did not know where it was going. Klink wants to interrogate Lynch; Kuehn says that it is up to the executive officer to interrogate prisoners. Schultz takes Lynch away. Hogan tells the men that that was the first step. Newkirk asks what is the next step. Hogan says that he will have to think about it.

In the barracks, Lynch is back. Hogan asks him about the interrogation; Lynch says that he just gave name, rank, and serial number.

In Klink's office, Klink and Kuehn are talking about the interrogation. Hogan comes in and wants to keep the light on late, because of the celebration. Hogan talks about Kaiserhof and the 43rd Group. Hogan opens the door, and tells Helga that if she is going out, to stay out of Hammelburg. Hogan leaves.

Klink wants to call the 43rd to tell them to move to Hammelburg. Kuehn says that Hogan wanted Klink to believe it. Klink says that he was just testing Kuehn.

As the next step in the plan, Hogan has the men assemble out front of the barracks, by the side so Kuehn can overhear them. First Hogan says that whoever stole Newkirk's watch, forget it. He stole it back. Then he says that tomorrow, the day our Red Cross packages arrive, the packages may be detained. He does not give details. Kuehn is around the corner of the building, listening.

Later, Klink talks with Kuehn about his uncle, and what he is going to be saying to his uncle. Kuehn comes to attention and says that his loyalty rests with Klink, his commanding officer. Kuehn asks Klink about the route that the truck carrying the packages takes to STALAG 13. Klink says that it starts from the southwest, goes through 3 cities, and then comes to Hammelburg. Kuehn is up to something. He suggests that Klink check gate security; the commanding officer is required to check the gate security daily. Klink tells Kuehn to his face that he has confidence in him. After Klink leaves the office, he says that he does not trust that man.

Kuehn calls General Burkhalter on the phone; he has some information to give him. He suggests moving the 43rd to Hammelburg because of an impending raid.

Hogan overhears this on the coffee pot. He tells Kinch to radio the submarine that it is OK for Kaiserhof.

The next day, outside of Klink's office, Hogan talks to Kuehn about the upcoming visit of General Burkhalter. Klink wants to know why he was not informed of the visit; as the kommandant he needs to be informed of all general officer visits. Kuehn hints that Burkhalter may be bringing a visitor with him, hinting that it may be his uncle, the field marshall.

Burkhalter comes to camp; Klink greets him. He just tells Klink that he has some here to see Kuehn. Kuehn asks if the operation was a success. Burkhalter says that it was a success - for the allies. They bombed Kaiserhof instead of Hammelburg. Kuehn is shocked. Hogan says that the prisoners voted to make him an honorary prisoner; Burkhalter wants to make that official. Burkhalter then says that his uncle the field marshall was on an inspection tour, which took him to the chemical works as Kaiserhof.

At the end, Hogan is in Klink's office looking through files. He is apparently looking for Lynch's file. Lynch is gone; Klink says that his record is ruined. Hogan says that he came in in the back of a staff car, he went out in the back of a staff car. Klink looks for Lynch's file, but can't find it. Klink says that he admires Hogan's spirit. Hogan pours a glass of schnapps and drinks it, while Klink looks miffed at him."

Schultz tries to keep in step with Hogan, but Hogan purposely changes stride to throw Schultz off. In Klink's office, Klink tells Hogan that it is up to Hogan to maintain discipline. He tells Hogan that he was disrespected by the men at roll call this morning.- he gives a 'Bronx cheer'. Hogan convinces Klink that the Bronx cheer is a sign of respect, Klink says that a new prisoner, Corporal Walter Tillman, serial number 3634422, will be arriving tomorrow. Hogan gives Klink a Bronx Cheer as he leaves the office. Klink seems pleased, and he smiles.

A truck then pulls into camp. A new prisoner, Corporal Walter Tillman, gets out of the back with two guards. He tells Hogan that he was with the 602nd Engineers, 82nd Airborne Division, captured at Normandy. In the barracks, there is a 'discussion' between Tillman, Newkirk, and others, specifically Tillman will not let Newkirk have his pack of cigarettes. Hogan tells Tillman to go take a shower. Hogan does not like Tillman's attitude, so he wants to get Klink to transfer him to STALAG 18.

Hogan needs to convince Klink to transfer Tillman. Newkirk, LeBeau, and Kinchloe toss some papers into a trans barrel outside of Klink's office Hogan lights a cigarette and tosses it into the trash barrel, setting it on fire. The men scream about the fire, and then put it out. Klink wants to know what is going on, so he calls Hogan into his office. Klink questions Hogan about the incident. Hogan pretends to not give information, while actually giving information. Hogan convinces Klink that it was Tillman who did it; Tillman is a fire bug and needs to go. Klink refers to STALAG 18, and says that the Kommandant of STALAG 18 is Himmler's barber's brother-in-law.

Back in the barracks, Hogan catches Tillman going through stuff in Hogan's office. Hogan is slightly angry and wants to know what is going on. He was apparently looking for listening devices. Tillman then tells Hogan that he actually General Tillman Walters, Signal Corps. There is a message that will be coming in from the BBC in 3 minutes that should explain everything. Hogan leaves to go below and get the message.

Kinchloe copies a message from the BBC, and decodes it: 'General with you; has vital mission. Give full and complete support.' Walters then tells Hogan of his mission. They will let the Germans build a plant, then bomb it just before it starts operating. He tells Hogan that he has to put a radar homing device in the camp. He takes out his packet of cigarettes (the ones that he would not let Newkirk have), dumps out the cigarettes that have been cut down to butts at the top, and removes the device that was hidden in the bottom. This is a radar homing device. Hogan goes along with the plan. Then he realizes that Tillman is being transferred, so he tells Tillman that he is being transferred to STALAG 18 because he is supposedly an arsonist. Hogan now needs to temporarily stall the transfer.

Outside the barracks, Tillman and Hogan, covered by some other prisoners, make measurements on where to put the device. Newkirk brings in a telescope and 50 foot piece of wire. Tillman takes reading on periscope on Newkirk's back. Carter has a 50 foot line attached to his leg, LeBeau has the reel for the line. He walks off in a certain direction, dragging the line behind him. Hogan tells him which direction to move until he gets the correct bearing. LeBeau has the reel for the line; he starts to reel the line in. He pulls too hard, and pulls on Carter's leg; Carter tries to walk back with the line tugging on his leg. Schultz comes to the group of prisoners to take Tillman to STALAG 18, For some reason, the truck will not start. (Apparently, one of the prisoners did something to the truck.) They will have to use a motorcycle to get Tillman to STALAG 18; Schultz has to go check out a motorcycle. While he is doing that, Tillman makes the final plot on where the transmitter has to go: It has to go on top of a guard tower just outside the front gate, on the extreme left edge. Hogan thinks of a plan to get it there.

Hogan tells LeBeau to get a camera; it does not matter if it has film or not. Hogan then goes to Klink's office and talks to Helga. He flatters her and tells her that she is 'star' material, she need to be a movie star. He says that Hollywood producers want pictures, so he wants to have pictures taken of her. He also asks her to wear a swim suit because Hollywood producers want more than 'bones'. Helga smiles, with big hopes.

She goes out front onto the porch of the office and LeBeau starts taking pictures. She opens up the shawl over her shoulders and reveals a nice swimsuit. This gets the attention of the guard in the guard tower. While this has the guard's attention, Hogan quietly climbs the guard tower and plants the device on a corner; he looks back at Tillman, who motions him to move it a few inches one way, so he does so. He climbs back down quietly. The guard thinks that he hears something, but he sees nothing, and goes back to looking at Helga.

Back in the barracks, Hogan toasts to mission success, just before Tillman has to leave for STALAG 18. While the men are talking, Hogan finds a knot in the line. LeBeau says that the line broke, so he tied a knot in it. This is important because that means that the line is 6 inches short. They need to move the device 6 inches to the left to be in the correct location. Tillman calculates that this could be vital as the distance from the previous transmitter is far enough away so that the desired bombing point will be 2000 yards (over a mile) off. Hogan has to think quick on how to move the device; he can't climb the tower again, so he will have to do it some other way.

Out in the compound, Hogan asks Newkirk if he has his 'pencil sharpener'; Newkirk takes out a large knife. Hogan tells him to flatten a tire on a staff car that is parked just outside the gate. Newkirk throws the knife into the tire, and the tire goes flat. Hogan the yells at Newkirk for doing that. Hogan convinces Klink to have Newkirk change the tire. Hogan and Newkirk go outside the gate with Schultz to change the tire. Schultz tells a guard to let them do it. Instead of putting the tire jack under the car, Hogan puts it under a leg of the guard tower, and starts jacking it up. The guard feels some movement, but Carter, LeBeau, Kinch, and five other prisoners are standing in the compound and tilt one way to make the guard think that he is not seeing things.

Just then, many planes are heard flying overhead. Seconds later, big explosions are heard in the distance. Hogan has successfully moved the device by 6 inches, and the proposed target has been successfully hit."

They are talking about a top secret project. Burkhalter wants to be sure that no one overhears them, so Klink opens the door to his office, looks out, and sees only Helga sitting at her desk. Hogan and Kinchloe are listening to the conversation in Hogan's office on the coffee pot. Suddenly, there seem to be loose connections and they can not hear what is being said.

Just then, Schultz comes to the barracks for an inspection. Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau are playing a shell game at the table, with 4 other un-named prisoners watching. After watching two games, Schultz decides to play. He bets, Newkirk shuffles the shells, and Schultz picks the wrong shell.

Klink comes to the barracks, sees the game, and wants to know what is going on. While this is going on, Kinch is trying to fix the wires to the listening device in Klink's office; Hogan comes out of his office to see what is happening. Klink wants the men to be punished for gambling. Klink picks up one of the shells and says that this is gambling; Hogan says that this is not gambling. Hogan says that they were conducting experiments in ESP, extra-sensory perception. A German named von Tillerman wrote a book on it; Klink did not recognize the name or have the book. Hogan says that all of the great German leaders had ESP: Bismarck, Frederick the Great, and stumbled on a third name. Klink said Hitler? Hogan replied, yes, that was it. Hogan asks Klink to do a shell game. Newkirk shuffles the shells, and Klink picks right the first time. He then picks right the second time. Hogan then asks Klink to guess what number he has written on a pad of paper. Hogan picks up a pad of paper, and when Klink was not looking, gave it to Kinch. Klink puts his fingers to his forehead, concentrating; he guesses 8, no 9. Hogan shows the paper (that Kinch wrote after Klink spoke) that has an 8 crossed off and a 9 written.

Later, in Klink's office, Klink tells Hogan that all men are confined to barracks. This has nothing to do with the gambling. There are security concerns, top secret. Hogan goes into the outer office and talks to Helga. He tries to get information from her on the top secret project; she does not know anything. He sees a book from a von Tillerman on ESP sitting on her desk, one that Klink ordered.

Back in the barracks, Kinch says that the wires to the bug are burned out and need to be replaced. He can't fix it unless he runs another line. They can't do that at this time, so Hogan has another idea. He wants to plant a walkie-talkie where they can hear the conversation in Klink's office.

General Burkhalter comes to Klink's office. Klink offers cigars and brandy. Burkhalter says that this is official business, not a social visit. So Klink offers him some official cigars and official brandy. Burkhalter accepts.

Back in the barracks, Newkirk is finishing painting Klink's name on a satchel. Hogan puts the walkie-talkie in the satchel, and puts it underneath the mattress of an upper bunk. Schultz comes in and announces a barracks inspection. Newkirk is drawing a picture of Carter, with his hair parted on the wrong side. Schultz looks in several bunks and finds nothing. He looks under the mattress in one bunk, and finds a briefcase with Klink's name on it. Schultz wants to report this, the prisoners having stolen the briefcase. Hogan starts telling Schultz a sob story; LeBeau gets behind Schultz and starts playing a sad song on the harmonica. Hogan tells about his poor upbringing, and needing money for a relative's surgery. Schultz starts crying, and says that he is not going to report this. Schultz asked where they finally got the money from; Hogan says 'the bank'.

In Klink's office, Klink is talking with Burkhalter. Schultz opens the door with the briefcase and interrupts. Klink tells him to leave and he puts the briefcase down, and leaves without saying much. The conversation continues. This is a top secret project; a new airplane is arriving that will change the course of the war and may even win the war. Then Klink gets a phone call - there is a plane circling. They don't hear anything, as this is a 'silent plane'. Hogan and the men are listening in on the walkie-talkie. Hogan and the men look out the barracks door; they see a plane flying nearby. What is so special about it? It's what you don't hear; there is no noise coming from the plane. Hogan pauses, then comes up with a plan; they can wait until dark.

That night, Hogan and the men come up the outside tunnel, which happens to be near where the plane is parked outside the gate. They sneak around a bit, and then take the engine out of the plane. They take it down into the tunnel, take pictures and measurements of it, and take it apart. When looking at it, Hogan sees that the 'secret' is that gas is vaporized in a series of baffle chambers, like putting cotton in your ears.

The pilot of the plane and inventor of the engine, Herr Kinzler, is talking in Klink's office with Klink and Burkhalter. Burkhalter asks about security. Klink and Burkhalter go outside and walk towards the plane. Klink says that he has given the guards orders to shoot anyone who goes near the plane. Anyone? Yes, anyone. Burkhalter stops, and then runs back behind a small guard shack. Burkhalter asks Klink to rescind that order before they get any closer.

Down in the tunnel, the motor is being put back together. One pipe does not fit right; Hogan hits it with a hammer, and the pipe goes into a hole. Hogan says that force is the only things that Germans understand.

At the plane, Burkhalter and Klink are discussing security. Klink says that nothing will happen. Then he looks into an opening in the side of the plane, and does not see an engine. He tries to cover for this with Burkhalter.

Klink goes to Hogan, and talks with him about the missing engine. Hogan tells Klink to use his ESP to try to find the engine. Klink puts his fingers to his forehead and concentrates. He sees Burkhalter testing him.

Klink and Hogan go outside to where the plane is. Klink uses his ESP again to find the engine. It is black, no white. He pulls a bush back saying it is right here. There is nothing under the bush. Hogan then looks in the opening in the side of the plane, and says that it would be crowded with two engines in there. Klink looks, and sees the engine back in its place. He is puzzled as to what is going on.

The next day, just inside the compound, Burkhalter is talking with 3 other generals and an aide in a staff car. The other generals are here to see the demonstration of the silent engine. The engine starts, and makes a lot of grumbling noises, pops, and bangs. This is not the silent engine that was to be demonstrated. One of the generals gives a sign to the aide to drive off, and the staff car leaves, without any of them saying anything. Hogan says, in a British accent 'By jove, I don't think he's got it'.

At the end, at roll call, Klink is talking to the prisoners 'so you call yourselves soldiers'. Newkirk says no, we are prisoners. Klink says that the confinement to barracks is over. Klink shows Hogan von Tillerman's book on ESP. Hogan says that the book must be scarce, maybe the only one left. The Nazis are burning von Tillerman's books in Berlin. Klink turns around, tosses the book into a burning trash barrel, and walks off."

These men are putting on civilian clothes and getting pictures. There is one delay: money. The old money, which the team has been counterfeiting, has been called in, and new money has been issued. They need the new money before the men can be sent off. Carter is watching the door; he sees Schultz and announces that Schultz is coming. Hogan has the escaping men go down into the tunnel, fast. Carter steps outside the barracks to try to stall Schultz while the men go down. He can't quite stall long enough; Schultz forces his way in just in time to see the last go down the tunnel, and the entrance close. He is astounded by what is going on, and sees nothing. Hogan wants to change new money for old. Schultz asks how much. Hogan tells LeBeau to show him the money. LeBeau opens up a suitcase that is completely full of old money in baled bills. Just then, they hear planes passing nearby. Allied fighters shoot down a German plane. Schultz lost a bet with Newkirk, so he starts to give him money; Newkirk notices that these are all old bills.

Later, in Klink's office, Klink is talking to an African Prince, Prince Makabana. It was his plane that was shot down and he had to bail out. The Prince states that this was an undignified way of coming to Germany. Klink offers his staff car to continue his trip to Berlin. The prince does not like that. A train perhaps? The prince dismisses the idea. Then Hogan comes in, and protests things that are being done. Klink introduces Hogan to Prince Makabana. The Prince says that the Allies will do anything to get the prince to abort his mission. Hogan is trying to get information out of the Prince. He first says that the Germans want to have an air base in his country. No. Air base, I meant submarine base. The Prince gets mad at Klink for betraying the mission; Klink knows nothing about the mission. Hogan leaves. Hogan seems to recognize that the prince looks similar to Kinchloe.

In the barracks, the men are dressing Kinch up as the prince. Kinch says that he was from Detroit and worked with the phone company; he knows nothing about being a prince. Hogan says that Kinch can pose as the prince, but he has to get rid of the mustache. Kinch objects; Newkirk and Carter try to hold him down while LeBeau tries to shave it off.

Outside of Klink's office, Klink takes the prince to his staff car. Newkirk and Carter are dressed up as German soldiers, in the front seat of the car. Kinch is hidden in the back seat. The prince gets in the back; he sees Kinch dressed as him and is surprised at what is going on. Klink tells the driver to drive on. But the car doesn't move. Kinch, as the prince, gets out and says that he changed his mind. Instead of Prince Makabana going to Berlin, let Berlin come to Prince Makabana. He tells Klink to tell them to bring negotiating papers, in other-words, money. Hogan comes up; Prince/Kinch says that he recognizes Hogan, that they went to school together. Hogan 'recognizes' him, and says that back then he had a mustache; Prince/Kinch says 'Don't remind me'. Prince/Kinch says that Hogan will stay with him. He says that Klink is to move his things out of his quarters and move Hogan's in. Prince/Kinch and Hogan walk into the building talking like old friends, such as what they did at the Notre Dame game.

In Klink's quarters, Hogan, LeBeau, and Kinch are talking. Kinch and LeBeau argue about wine, LeBeau pours some for the 'prince'. Klink comes in, and sees that his best wine is being used. He says that he talked to Berlin, and Count von Sickle will be coming tomorrow. And he has a surprise: the Prince's wife will be coming along with von Sickle. Klink leaves. Kinch is worried. He asks Hogan what to do now. Hogan says 'You're the Prince'.

The next day, in Klink's quarters, Klink, Hogan, and von Sickle are there with Kinch/Prince. The Princess comes in and gets close to Kinch/Prince. She recognized that this is not her husband, and takes his hand to lead him into the next room. When the door is closed, she asks him who he is. Kinch says that he is trying to make a deal with the Allies. He asks her what side she is on. She replies 'My own'. Kinch tells her to go ahead and blow the whistle. She may or may not do so.

Meanwhile in Klink's office, von Sickle says that they are wasting time. Kinch/Prince, Klink, Hogan, and Princess Yawanda are also in the room. The submarines are waiting to get into port, and aircraft are waiting to take off with supplies. Hogan asks about job security if Germany loses; von Sickle says that Germany will not lose. Von Sickle offers 400,000 Marks; Hogan asks for 600,000. Von Sickle says 500,000 as that is all he brought with him. All new money. The deal is made. Von Sickle asks the Prince to make the phone call. Hogan asks if he knows the Prince's native language' and suggests the Princess make the call instead. She picks up the phone and makes the call.

Later, back in the barracks, the men are in civilian clothes waiting for the money so they can escape. Hogan says that when they get the message that the submarines were clobbered, to call the main gate to open it up. The real Prince protests what is going on, and demands to be released; LeBeau pushes him back down the tunnel.

Schultz is walking guard outside Klink's quarters where the Prince and Princess are staying. The Prince/Kinch and Princess come out. Schultz says that he has orders that the Prince and Princess do not leave without orders from Klink. Kinch/Prince gets mad at Schultz. The staff car comes up, again with Newkirk and Carter in German uniforms in the front seat. Kinch/Prince and Princess Yawanda get in the back seat. They talk while Kinch takes his outfit off. She says that she originally was from Cleveland; Kinch says that he is from Detroit. He will meet her halfway, in Toledo, after the war. Kinch presses his mustache back on.

In Klink's office, Klink and von Sickle are waiting for a phone call. The phone rings, Helga answers, and gives it to von Sickle. Von Sickle is waiting for the message that the subs are in port. Instead, the message is that the subs were met by destroyers and sunk, and the planes were shot down. Von Sickle is to be shot.

At the car, Kinch and the Princess are kissing in the back seat; Hogan interrupts. Kinch leaves through the opposite side door and sneaks around. He tells Schultz that he saw the Prince walking 'over there', and points in one direction. Schultz looks in the car and sees just the Princess. The car leaves, with Carter (in the German uniform) driving. Klink comes out saying 'Stop that car'. The car is out the gate before it can be stopped. Hogan asks Kinch about Toldeo. Kinch says that after the war, it could be quite a spot.

At the end, in the barracks, von Sickle is also dressed up like the others trying to escape, in civilian clothes. He says that this is not enough money to get to Switzerland. The real Prince is also there, and says that his subjects will take revenge. Hogan says he doesn't think so, the way he double-crossed the Germans.

Outside, Klink asks Hogan what she saw in him. Hogan says that she just has a particular taste in men."

While they are discussing this, Major Kronman appears, and asks Schultz where to find Klink. He asks Schultz to hide the car out of site, and Schultz suggests behind the barracks. Kronman says that he is on a special mission, and Schultz says that he says nothing.

In Klink's office, Schultz tells Klink that a Major Kronman has arrived, and Klink has trouble remembering him. Then Major Hans Kronman, an old classmate of Klink, enters Klink's office. They took military training together in Potsdam, and were in the same class. Kronman is amazed that Klink made colonel, and Klink is amazed that Kronman is still a major, two ranks below Klink. While they are having small talk with Hogan listening in, Gestapo Captain Gunther and two Gestapo guards come into Klink's office and arrest Kronman, Gunther says that Kronman is part of the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. As he is being taken away, Kronman gives Hogan a key to a safe deposit box. Klink feigns that he does not know Kronman.

Back in the barracks, Hogan tells the men what has happened. He shows them the key, marked 'Hammelburg Hof number 9'. When asked why Kronman did not give Klink the key, Hogan says that at this point, one person a German does not trust is another German. They guess that this is to a safety deposit box in a hotel by that name. While they are discussing this, Kinch comes up from the tunnel with a message from London stating that Kronman's identity was confirmed, and Hogan is to give him what help he needs. Hogan suggests that they raid the hotel box, and make it look like a burglary. Newkirk says that the safe deposit boxes at hotels are usually in a safe, and he suggests blowing the safe, but nitro makes a mess; they need a safe-cracker. Hogan asks Kinch if there are any safe-crackers among the prisoners. Kinch says that there are mechanics, pool hustlers, and used car salesmen, but no safe-crackers (they do not say that Newkirk is a safe-cracker). Newkirk suggests someone named Alfie the Artiste, a famous safe-cracker from England, be called in to do the job. Hogan has Kinch call London about Alfie. They get a message back saying that they found him, in prison, which does not surprise Newkirk.

Hogan sees Klink in the compound, and asks for favors again, and again Klink denies them. Hogan then shows Klink the key to the box. They go to Klink's office to discuss matters. Hogan gives Klink the key without him realizing it. They talk about Kronman and what Kronman wanted to talk to Klink about, referring to the conspiracy that the Gestapo arrested Kronman for. Hogan convinces Klink that the Gestapo may think that he may be involved. Klink asks Hogan for help with the problem. Hogan offers help, but Klink thinks that this is a pretense to escape. Hogan gives him his word that there will be no escape. Hogan butters Klink up when Klink asks why he wants to help; he calls Klink the 'Iron Colonel'. He says that if we get a new Kommandant, the men may try to escape, and may get hurt, and he does not want that. Hogan somehow gets the key back, and tells Klink that he may have to ignore some happenings around there. Klink lights a cigarette for Hogan, and they discuss it some more. Hogan ends up pouring a glass of schnapps from Klink's decanter and drinks it.

Later, a man jumps out of a C-119 which is partially painted in international orange. Alfred Burke, also known as Alfie the Artiste, is brought in to the barracks through the tunnel; he asks for some tea. He is then introduced to Hogan, and asks about the mission. Hogan tells Alfie about the key, and the possible safe that the box is in. Alfie starts thinking: Hammelburg, the nearest large city is Dusseldorf; a major safe manufacturer in Dusseldorf is the Sscleswig-Offenbach Safe Company. He sites some specifications of their safe from memory. Newkirk tells the others how good he is. Hogan asks if he needs anything, and Alfie says that like a surgeon, he brought what he needed. He also asks for some tea. Then, Schultz comes in and says that the guards said that they say Newkirk outside the wire. Newkirk says that he was there the whole time. After discussing this, Schultz sees Alfie, and asks his name. He gives it as Burke, Alfred, Private First Class. Schultz says that he is not on the roster, and needs to report this to Klink. Just then, Klink comes to the barracks, and wants to know why Schultz has left his post. Schultz says that he was doing an inspection and has made a discovery. Hogan dangles the key; Klink says that he wants to know nothing, and leaves. Schultz is disappointed that Klink did not want to hear him, and he leaves. Hogan then starts telling the men the plan, where Klink will give a party at the hotel, which will be used as a diversion.

At the party, Klink and Hogan discuss what will happen. Hogan tells Klink to yell 'air raid' at the right time; Klink tries it now, and Hogan has to quiet him down. The Burgermeister comes by and thanks Klink for the party. There are at least 4 other officers, 4 women, and 6 other men at the party. Meanwhile, Kinch and Alfie are outside waiting Hogan to open a window. After he does, Alfie goes in and starts to work on the safe. Carter is a waiter, bringing drinks. Klink takes two. Hogan tells Klink to lay off the juice just in case anything goes wrong. Klink asks what could go wrong. Just then, Captain Gunther and the two Gestapo guards come in. Gunther tells Klink that Kronman was shot. He asks what Hogan is doing there, and Klink responds that this is a reward for providing vital information. Gunther then starts looking around. As he pulls back the curtain to the back room (where Alfie is working), LeBeau, Newkirk, and Carter (all dressed as waiters) start singing a song by Irving Berlin 'This is the Army, Mister Jones'. Not very good singing, but it serves as a distraction. Gunther looks around in the room and sees nothing out of the ordinary; Alfie is hiding on a shelf over the safe where Gunther does not look. As Gunther leaves, Carter suggests another number, and is pulled back behind the curtain. Alfie comes down off the shelf, goes back to work, lights the explosive, and blows the safe. Klink tries to scream 'air raid', but the words barely come out. Newkirk opens the box, gets an envelope, and tosses it to Hogan. When Klink wants to know why he did not get the envelope, Hogan mentions Tinkers to Evers to Chance; Klink is Evers, Hogan is Chance.

At the end, Hogan comes to Klink's office. Klink says that the Gestapo is convinced of his innocence in the conspiracy, and that the bombing was an attempt on his life. Hogan 'sells' the list to Klink, where Klink agrees to have packages delivered on time and extra showers for the men, among other things. Klink then opens the envelope and sees his name at the top of the list, with General Burkhalter, Admiral Metzger, and others on the list. Klink then revokes the extra privileges that he just granted. Hogan suggests that he may have made a copy. Klink is worried that Hogan may try to blackmail him and restores the revoked extra privileges, and tells Hogan to make sure that the men don't use too much water for their showers."

He announces that by order of Kommandant Klink all men from Barracks 3 are to be moved to Barracks 5, which is the barracks where Hogan and the men live. Schultz says that Klink wants room for 3 more prisoners, three Americans on the way to maximum security in Berlin. Gestapo wants to keep them separate.

Hogan goes to Klink's office, and says that he wants to register a complaint of overcrowding. Schultz comes in and says that Captain Heinrich of the Gestapo has arrived with 3 Americans. He also says that the 3 prisoners are women. Klink tells Schultz to show them to Barracks 3. While Klink is talking to Schultz, Hogan takes food off of Klink's plate. Klink does not know how it disappeared.

Back in the barracks, Hogan pulls down a map of the camp compound from the side of a bunk. Hogan tells the men to dig out the tunnel to Barracks 3. Hogan asks for volunteers, and no one volunteers. Hogan then says that he needs another way to see the girls. He says that the new prisoners are women. All of a sudden, all of them volunteer to dig. Hogan asks how long to dig the tunnel, and Newkirk says about an hour and a half. Hogan says that to prevent put-communication, he will talk to the girls.

Apparently, the tunnel is dug quickly. Hogan goes to Barracks 3 through the tunnel, and opens up the hatch in the floor. He almost gets hit on the head by one of the girls by a high-heel shoe as he comes out. They introduce themselves as Charlene Helmsley, Cathy Pruitt, and Ginger Wilson. Hogan asks why the Germans are interested in them. They don't know. They said that they were doing their performance routine for some American infantry when they were attacked; they jumped in a jeep, left, and were surrounded by Germans. They were taken to a shelter where they saw some long thin shells with wings, like torpedoes. Hogan asks how long it took them to get here from there, and they said about 4 hours, on a bumpy road and passing a cathedral. Hogan thinks that they might be rockets. Just then, Newkirk and LeBeau come out of the tunnel, and Hogan tells them to get back in, and they have a short discussion. Schultz then comes into the barracks to do a head count, and brings a bottle of wine. Hogan, Newkirk, LeBeau, and one of the women are hiding behind a curtain. Hogan tosses women's underwear and nylon stockings over the curtain to try to convince Schultz not to look behind the curtain. One of the stockings falls to the floor and Schultz picks it up. While down there, he counts 4 pairs of feet under the curtains. He open up the curtains and sees Hogan, Newkirk, LeBeau, and the girl; he tells the men to get back to the barracks. Then, Klink knocks on the door; Hogan; Schultz, Newkirk, and LeBeau hide behind the curtains. Klink wants to know if the women are doing well; they seem to have a distrust of him, and move away from him. The curtain falls, and Klink sees the others who have been hiding, and wants to know what they are doing there and takes the wine from Schultz. Just then, Capt. Heinrich comes in, and sees Klink holding the wine bottle. He gets angry, and says that he will take the women out tomorrow. He will have an one-flattering report on Klink.

Back in the barracks, Hogan is discussing how to get them out. Kinch gets a radio message stating that they will bomb the rockets tomorrow. Just then, there is an explosion and a tunnel cave in. Newkirk says that the tunnel to Barracks 3 has collapsed, not enough supports holding it up. When thinking about how to get them out. Hogan says that if all else fails, there is always Colonel Klink.

In Klink's office, Klink gives Schultz a list of punishments for the prisoners Newkirk and LeBeau. Hogan says that he should check with Heinrich. Klink says that he is running the place, not Heinrich. After some discussion, Hogan convinces Klink to ship them out tonight, not tomorrow.

That evening, Newkirk walks past Barracks 3 trailing a fuse out of his pants leg, gets stares from the Gestapo guard, and walks to Barracks 5. Carter lights the fuse and lets it run. The guards sees the lit fuse, and sounds an alarm, calls to get a fire hose and extinguisher. Hogan, Newkirk, Carter, and LeBeau go to Barracks 3, and says that they will change places with the girls. He pulls out some wigs, and says that Private Ninowski, the wig-maker, does beautiful work. LeBeau and Newkirk do not want to dress up as women. After some discussion, Hogan, Newkirk, and LeBeau dress as the women in their clothes. The women then put on prisoners' uniforms. Hogan tells Newkirk that he looks good in basic black.

A truck comes to Barracks 3. Newkirk, LeBeau, and finally Hogan get into the back of the truck, assisted by Schultz who recognizes them. Hogan calls Schultz 'Fresh'. Schulotz is dumbfounded and surprised. The truck leaves. On the road, Hogan fakes an illness, Newkirk tells the driver to stop the truck. The truck stops, and the driver gets out and asks what is going on. Hogan hits the driver in the head with a purse, and the other guard is also knocked out. They escape, and make their way back to camp.

Theu come up through the tunnel, to the men and the girls dressed as men, saying that they can go. Kathy, one of the girls, says 'How can we thank you?' and kisses Hogan. Hogan says to leave their names and addresses for after the war.

At the end, Hogan comes to Klink's office and asks for extra rations; it is a holiday, Armistice day, the day when the Americans beat the Germans in World War I. Oops, bad taste. Hogan asks about Heinrich. Klink says that he met with disgrace; he was overpowered by a handbag and the 3 women prisoners escaped. He says that an experimental station with rockets was bombed."

Burkhalter tells Klink that 'no one must have any idea' that Vanetti is there. Dr. Vanetti just wants quiet. Burkhalter says that it is quiet here, like a church. He tells Klink that Vanetti is to get quiet. Vanetti has brought along almost everything that he needs; he just needs paper, pencils, and quiet. He knew Fermi, Hatermann, and Szilard. Burkhalter says that Vanetti will be completely safe here.

Back in the barracks, Hogan and the men are listening in to the conversation on the coffee pot. Hogan says that we need to kill him. Vanetti is an atomic scientist. The other three names that were mentioned were also atomic scientists.

Schultz comes in saying that it is garbage day. He tells the men that an assassin, Garreau, was dropped, captured, and taken to STALAG 16. Hogan tells Carter and LeBeau that they are going out tonight. Schultz hears nothing.

That night, Carter and LeBeau bring back the assassin and Crittenden, who was also at STALAG 16. As they near the camp, Crittenden goes the wrong way and is seen by camp guards. The guards start shooting; LeBeau and Carter get back while this is going on. They come in through the outside tunnel, which has a hatch lid and is not a tree stump.

Later in the tunnel, Crittenden offers to do the assassination job. He wants Carter and explosives to help. This is not a good idea. Crittenden then wants to use a crossbow. Hogan reluctantly goes along with it. Hogan will be having dinner with Klink and Vanetti tonight; Crittenden will have one shot. Crittenden asks how he will know Vanetti. Hogan tells him that he knows Klink, he knows Hogan; Vanetti will be the one that he does not know.

Hogan goes to Klink's quarters; Vanetti is having dinner. Klink tries to get rid of Hogan. Carter starts a diversion of firecrackers outside. Klink sounds the alarm and leaves. After Klink leaves, Vanetti wants to talk to Hogan alone. He wants to get to England. He says that all information is in his head, and he can not trust atomic secrets to Hitler. Vanetti got wind of Hogan's operation through the Underground. Vanetti is standing in front of the window; Crittenden is taking aim with the crossbow from the barracks. Hogan tackles Vanetti just as Klink comes back in. A crossbow arrow goes through the open window, through Klink's cap, left of the eagle decoration, and lodges in the office door. Klink is very surprised. Hogan asks Klink if he has angered Robin Hood.

Klink calls Schultz. Klink has the hat in his hand, with the arrow still in the door. Klink asks Hogan how they knew Vanetti was here. Hogan says that they didn't, but everybody knows that Klink is here. He suggests to Klink that it may be the Gestapo. Klink starts to get worried.

Back in the barracks. Hogan tells Crittenden that Vanetti is on our side. Just then, there is an explosion in the tunnel. Carter comes up in a dirty uniform. There is some discussion as to who is in charge and what to do with Crittenden's ideas. Hogan asks what Crittenden would do if he gives Crittenden a direct order; Crittenden says that he would ignore it - he outranks Hogan by date of rank. Crittenden still wants to eliminate Vanetti. Hogan has to do some thinking.

Hogan goes to Klink's office. There are more explosions. Klink says that he discounts the Gestapo theory. Klink wants to know about the explosions; Hogan says that he discounted it.

Back in the barracks, Hogan dresses up Crittenden as a German; he tells him that he will take Vanetti on a ride, and 'let him have it'. Essentially, Hogan is making Crittenden think that he will be going for a ride with Vanetti, and he can eliminate him on the road. Hogan goes out to check the staff car to see if Vanetti is in it, knowing that it will be Klink in the car. Hogan sees Klink in the car, and tells him that Vanetti is in the compound. Hogan puts Crittenden in the staff car with Klink, making Crittenden and Klink think that the other is Vanetti.

Schultz suddenly screams that Vanetti is gone. Hogan starts to tell him why, but Schultz says that he knows nothing.

On the road, the staff car pulls over. Klink thinks that Crittenden is Vanetti, Crittenden thinks that Klink is Vanetti. They are both surprised when neither is the case. Crittenden gets out of the car and runs. Klink tells the guards to go after him, and they start shooting.

Back in the barracks, Hogan tells Vanetti that the guards had blanks. Vanetti starts to leave through the tunnel in the barracks under the bunk. Carter asks Vanetti if our side will ever come up with an atomic bomb. Vanetti says that he hopes not, because it would be too noisy. Vanetti then goes down the tunnel. Hogan says that Crittenden does not have the knack for escaping, that he probably did not get away.

At the end, Hogan, Klink, Burkhalter, and Schultz are looking down into the hole where Vanetti's laboratory used to be. Burkhalter wants to know why Vanetti can be so brainy and yet so dummkoff enough to blow himself up. Hogan wants to talk with Klink and Burkhalter about it."

He says that lights go out in 25 seconds. Newkir says 'You woke us up for that?' Newkirk takes Schultz's rifle while he is not looking. Newkirk gives it to LeBeau, and Schultz finds LeBeau hugging it in his bunk. LeBeau says he does not have a teddy bear. Carter is in his bunk, and asks Schultz for a drink of water. Schultz leaves. Then the men go down into the tunnel.

Capt. Ferguson is a shot-down pilot waiting to go to England. He is in the tunnel, in a recliner reading a book and listening to a record player. He needs to go on a mission. The land periscope is near the ladder to the outside exit, the top of the periscope as seen from the outside is covered in plants. Kinch and Hogan look through the periscope, and see Klink patrolling the wire, keeping guards awake so Capt. Ferguson can't escape. Then Hogan sees Klink heading to the barracks, so he hurries the men back to the barracks; they should be asleep in their bunks.

Klink goes to the barracks, turns the lights on. Klink wants to talk to Hogan alone; Hogan invites Klink to Hogan's office. Klink tells Hogan that he (Klink) is a failure, and he can't sleep. Klink has been a colonel longer than anyone in his graduating class; others are generals and field marshals. They talk a bit. General Burkhalter will be coming tomorrow to talk about the future.

General Burkhalter comes to visit STALAG 13, and tells Klink that he disapproves of him, and wants Klink to get a wife. General Burkhalter refers to a Captan Haldman who just made General; he says that Haldman was the idiot of his graduating class. Burkhalter tells Klink to see what marrying into the right family will do. Burkhalter's sister and niece will be visiting. Hogan tells Klink to get some sleep.

Burkhalter, his sister Frau Linkmeyer, and her daughter Lottie come to STALAG 13. Klink says that quarters are prepared, and wants to show them around the camp. Burkhalter says that they just got there, and need to freshen up. Frau Linkmeyer is a homely brunette, and Lottie is a beautiful blonde. Burkhalter asks them what they think of Klink, and Lottie says he looks like a dead fish. After Lottie responds, Burkhalter says that he was asking her mother. Frau Linkmeyer says that she is not a widow; her husband, Otto, is 'missing in action at the Russian front'. Burkhalter says 'Missing in action at the Russian front' means 'widow'.

In Klink's office, Klink tells Hogan that General Burkhalter wants Klink to marry his niece, not knowing that General Burkhalter really wants Klink to marry his sister. Klink asks advice from Hogan on what to do, how to romance Lottie. Hogan tells him that the most important thing is to whisper lies in her ear. Klink won't do it; he has a code of honor.

Frau Linkmeyer comes to Klink's office and wants to talk to Klink alone, but Klink wants Hogan to stay. Burkhalter and Lottie are going around the camp. Frau Linkmeyer asks Klink some questions related to marriage. She asks Klink 'Do you drink or gamble?' Klink answers 'Never'. Who should handle the finances, the husband or the wife? After Klink stumbles, Hogan answers the questions for Klink, and Klink agrees with the answers. Schultz comes in and says that Burkhalter and Lottie are here. Frau Linkmeyer says that they will talk more later, and tells Klink that Lottie does not like Klink. There can not be a marriage without her approval. She leaves the office.

Klink still thinks that it is Lottie he is being fixed up with. Klink wants Lottie to fall in live with Klink, not an 'image'. Hogan gives Klink things to say, still thinking that Lottie is the one that Klink is being set up with. Klink is alone with Gertrude (Frau Linkmeyer), but never alone with Lottie without Gertrude. Klink asks Hogan what to do. Hogan dictates words to Klink. Give her an invitation to dinner.

Hogan delivers a letter from Klink to Lottie. Klink has invited Lottie for dinner, but Lottie thinks that he has invited 'Mama'. Hogan tries to build up Klink by telling Lottie that Klink is a Baron, and talks about his decorations. Lottie is impressed. Hogan tells her not to tell her mother. Lottie then tells Hogan that it is her mother that is going to marry Klink, and that Lottie now approves. Hogan wants the note back.

In Klink's quarters, Hogan is there talking with LeBeau (as the cook) about the dinner set-up. Hogan tells LeBeau that he feels sorry for Klink. Gertrude arrives for dinner, calling him 'Wilhelm'. She tells him to call her 'Gertrude'. She is thinking that Klink wants to marry her. She tells Klink that she was mad about General Burkhalter's matchmaking, but now she got to know him better. She wants to set up 'our own little love nest'. LeBeau gets champagne. Klink asks Schultz to set another place (for Hogan).

At the end, Gertrude asks Klink about a spring wedding. Hogan suggests the wedding be 'tomorrow'. as Klink has volunteered for service at the Russian front. Gertrude gets mad and tells Klink that the engagement is off, and storms out of the room. Klink tells Hogan that he has done him a favor, and what can he do in return. Hogan says 'Just get a good night's sleep'."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0602408/?ref_=ttep_ep31,,There seems to be a traitor in the escaped prisoner pipeline and Hogan has to find him by following the escape route.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Howard Morris'],"['', '', '']",[],"['smoke bomb', 'forest', 'recognition code', 'telephone call', 'barmaid', 'farmhouse', '.45 calibre pistol', 'bar', 'truck', 'leather belt', 'fire fighting', 'closet']",[],"At the start, a truck comes in carrying Captain Warren. Warren escaped from STALAG 5, came to STALAG 13 to get to England; Hogan and the men sent him through the normal escape route, and he was caught and brought back to STALAG 13. Klink sentences Warren to 30 days in the cooler, solitary confinement. Hogan tells Schultz that he sounds like Klink; Schultz that insults will get you nowhere. Newkirk offers Schultz a cigarette to distract attention, while he takes a key from Schultz's belt. As Warren is being led away, he tells Hogan that he was knocked out and captured. Hogan says that something is rotten in Denmark.

Back in the barracks, Hogan is talking to the men. He says that he briefly talked to Warren about the escape. Warren made it to the first station, the bar Hauserhof. Then he made it to the second station, a farmhouse. When he got to the third station, he got caught. Hogan says that something is wrong, that there may be a traitor someplace in the pipeline, someone is selling us out. Hogan wants some of the men to travel the route themselves; Hogan says that LeBeau and Newkirk will go with him as bait. Newkirk wants to stay behind, but after some discussion Newkirk and LeBeau 'volunteer'. Hogan has an idea where the men can 'disappear' for some time without much suspicion.

Hogan tells Kinchloe and Carter to make smoke bombs and start a fire in the nearby forest, high up where it can be seen from camp. The next day, after the fire is started in the woods, Hogan goes to Klink's office, and shows Klink the 'forest fire'. Klink panics and calls the officer of the day; Klink wants to send guards to fight the fire. Hogan gets him to hang up and talks him out of sending the guards. After some discussion, Hogan convinces Klink to have some of the prisoners fight the fire. Klink agrees, and he will have Schultz guard them.

Hogan, Carter, Newkirk, LeBeau, Kinch, and Schultz go to the fire site in a truck. Schultz starts thinking that something is fishy. Hogan wants to establish a fire line; Kinch throws more smoke bombs. The smoke and excuse of fighting the fire gives Hogan, Newkirk, and LeBeau the chance to get away for a short time. They go to the first station, the bar, and find 2 girls there, Eva and Margit; one pulls a gun as she is not sure who they are. Hogan says that they are going to Dusseldorf, and Eva responds that they are on the wrong road. Hogan says that this was the correct recognition code. Hogan tells Newkirk to watch the door; Newkirk would rather watch a girl. Hogan asks Eva if she remembers Captain Warren from a short time ago. She says that she does; he tells her that he got captured, and wants to know what happened. Just then, Eva gets a phone call; she asks them to call back. Seems suspicious. Hogan noticed that they used her first name. She tells Hogan that the call was 'Winter Relief', asking for donations, that they call every week. Hogan and Eva talk for a while, and Hogan kisses Eva. She tells Hogan to go to a farmhouse, the second station; no recognition code. LeBeau comes out of the back room, having spent some time with Margit. Newkirk says that he fell in love with a door; Hogan says 'If you have seen one door, you have seen them all'. LeBeau kisses Margit; and Hogan, Newkirk, and LeBeau leave.

The three of them come back to the truck, which is still there. Schultz calls Klink on the 'walkie talkie' to report what is going on. While he is talking, Hogan drives off in the truck. Schultz screams for them to come back.

Hogan, Newkirk, and LeBeau go to the farmhouse. They look at it from a distance, and Hogan tells the others that if he is not back in 10 minutes, go back to camp. Hogan enters the farmhouse with his pistol drawn. He sees an old man, Willy, and his wife inside; they are surprised that he barged in. Willy says that they get instructions from the Hauserhof. Hogan asks about Warren; they remember him, says that they helped him to escape. Willy says that they are Swedish, and the Germans seem to be paying no attention to them. Hogan opens a closet, and finds Gestapo uniforms hanging there. Hogan gets hit over the head with a chair by Willy and is knocked out.

Newkirk and LeBeau storm in to the farmhouse with guns drawn, and find Hogan recovering from the knockout. Willy says that he has to be sure that he is not a spy. Willy says that Eva at the Hauserhof tells them where to send them. Willy gets a phone call, says that there are 'change in plans', to take the south road. Hogan tells Newkirk to call Gestapo headquarters and tell them to go to the Hauserhof, that it a waste of time on the South Road. Newkirk makes the call.

Hogan, Newkirk, and LeBeau go back to the Hauserhof. Hogan and the others are drinking with Eva and Margit, and Hogan toasts 'to the defeat of Germany'. Schultz comes in and sees them; he wants to know what they are doing there. Just then, two Gestapo men, one officer and one enlisted, come in. One asks Schultz his name, and he gives 'Schultz, Hans, STALAG 13, 23789 '. Newkirk tells the Gestapo that the girls tried to divert the Gestapo from the south road. Margit says that they are reporting escaping prisoners. The Gestapo thinks that they might be double agents, and put the girls in their car. Hogan convinces the Gestapo that Schultz captured them trying to escape. They buy the story and leave. As they are leaving, Schultz tells the Gestapo that his serial number is 23781. Hogan, Newkirk, LeBeau, and Schultz drink to Sergeant Schultz, Hero. Hogan asks Schultz 'Have you been to a good fire lately?' They all laugh.

At the end, Hogan and Schultz are in Klink's office. Klink reads them a special communication from General Burkhalter. It is from the Gestapo and commends Schultz for the job that he did, and asks whether Schultz shouldn't be transferred to a combat unit. Hogan mentions about Panzer units at the Russian front; the term 'combat unit' usually means the Russian front. The memo gives Klink discretion to the transfer. Klink says that Schultz is needed here and can't be transferred. Hogan and Schultz leave. When they get outside, Schultz thanks Hogan, and says 'If you ever escape, be a good fellow and take me with you.'"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0602382/?ref_=ttep_ep32,,Carter receives a Dear John letter and wants to join the rest of the prisoners that escape and go home.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Edward H. Feldman'],"['', '', '']",[],"['dear john letter', 'harmonica', 'microfilm', 'mention of draft board', 'cigarette lighter', 'mail call', 'barmaid', 'bartender', 'identity papers', 'season finale']",[],"At the start, a message from London comes in. There is a cigarette lighter stashed in Klink's car, with microfilm that they want to get to the Germans as a ruse. Hogan tells the men to start a car wash. The next day, Newkirk, Carter, Kinchloe, and LeBeau are washing a car, with Hogan watching. LeBeau is inside the car looking; Kinch says he didn't find it, LeBeau didn't find it, Newkirk didn't find it. Hogan tells them to keep looking. Kinch finally finds it taped under the distributor. The men leave with the car half washed; Klink arrives and asks what is going on. Schultz is taken by surprise and, seeing that the prisoners have left, says that he is washing the car.

Later in the tunnel, Hogan is looking at the microfilm. It has pictures of Endhoven and Schweinfurt; these are close together. If the bombers want to bomb Schweinfurt, they act like they are going to Endhoven, and then make a turn a little way out. Hogan wants the microfilm to get to the Germans. Just then, Schultz come in with a mail call. He calls some names, including Abraham, Adams, Barker, Bartoli, Beauchamp. Kinchloe gets a letter from his draft board; it says that his draft classification is 4F. He says 'Now they tell me'. Carter gets a Dear John letter from his girlfriend, Mary Jane; she is going around with an air raid warden at home. Carter is not happy.

Later, Carter comes to Hogan's office, addresses him and acts formally, salutes, and requests to escape. LeBeau, Kinch, and Newkirk are in the office with him. Hogan says that their orders are to assist prisoners to escape and do sabotage. Hogan asks Carter if he has to be so serious.

Outside later, Carter is washing clothes in a bucket. LeBeau invites Carter to Paris after the war, where they will meet girls. Carter asks LeBeau if he is sure that they are girls that Mary Jane will approve. LeBeau walks away disgusted.

In Klink's office, Hogan tells Helga 'You know what to do'. Carter comes in, Helga comes on to him. Carter politely brushes her off.

In the compound, Hogan is talking to Klink. Klink wants the prisoners to fall in; he wants to talk to the prisoners. Klink says that if any man tries to escape, the whole barracks will be punished. Carter asks if that applies to hardship cases. Klink walks away disgusted.

Later, Carter is talking to Schultz. He tells Schultz that he was going to marry Mary Jane when he gets back. Schultz tells him that women are like war: there is always another one coming around. Schultz asks Carter if he wants to escape. He begs Carter not to escape, because if he does they might send him to the Russian Front. If Carter is caught, Schultz might get a 10 day pass, which he will have to spend with his wife, and he does not want that either.

Hogan has a subtle plan to get Carter to stay. In Hogan's office, Hogan tells Carter that he can go home. Carter then starts planning to leave, he gives LeBeau his harmonica. Carter is in the process of giving away other things when Hogan comes in. Hogan says that London wants the Germans to get the microfilm in 48 hours. He asks for volunteers; at first, nobody volunteers. Hogan finally gets Carter to volunteer; Carter asks if he can go home after, and Hogan gives him his word that he can.

Hogan looks out through the land periscope, and the area is clear. Carter leaves through the tunnel, and goes to a bar in town. He looks around and sits with a soldier, an artillery private (played by William Christopher). Carter says that he is an escaped prisoner, and the soldier might get a promotion. The soldier says that he is on his first leave in a long time, and he doesn't want any complications, and leaves. Carter then goes to another table, where a German army captain, another officer, and 2 women are seated. He tells the captain that he is an escaped prisoner. The officers think that he is a Gestapo agent in disguise. Just then, a Gestapo man in civilian clothes comes in. He asks the two officers for their papers. After looking, he says that the papers are in order. The captain tells the Gestapo officer not to look at Carter's papers, and he may catch one of their own. The Gestapo officer does go to Carter and asks for his papers. Carter gives him his papers, and tells him that he is an escaped prisoner. The Gestapo officer looks at the papers, and says 'Section 9 in Berlin makes excellent fakes'. They then walk away. Mady, the barmaid, comes and talks to Carter. She says that she is Norwegian; she wants to help Carter escape. She tells Carter to go back to camp and get some rest, then she kisses Carter. Carter starts to leave the bar, and the Gestapo officer offers him a ride; Carter accepts.

Later, in camp, Hogan is in Klink's office, with the Gestapo, Carter, and Schultz. The Gestapo says that 'the truth' came out on the way to camp, that Carter is really an escaped prisoner. Klink wants to put him in the cooler. Carter asks for his cigarette lighter; the Gestapo officer thinks something is funny, and looks at it. He finds the microfilm, and says that he has to get it to Berlin. Klink says that Carter has made a fool of him in front of his own command and asks him if he is satisfied. Hogan, says he is satisfied, and asks Carter if he is satisfied. Carter says he is satisfied, and asks Schultz if he is satisfied. Schultz says he is satisfied, and asks Klink if he is satisfied. Klink starts saying 'Yes, I'm ....' then stops mid-sentence.

At the end, in the barracks, Carter thanks Hogan for getting him out of the cooler. Hogan says that the raid was a success. As Carter starts to leave through the tunnel, Hogan says to say hello to Mary Jane. Carter says that he is not going home, he is going to town to see Mady. He quotes what Schultz told him earlier, that women are like wars, there is always another one coming around."

Freddie (Nathan Kress) buys a pie-shaped spy camera with an obvious lens on the side and a giant fork, much to Carly and Sam's (Jennette McCurdy) amusement. Freddie tries it out on Spencer (Jerry Trainor) and his new girlfriend Connie (Samantha Aisling), but doesn't fool either of them.

Carly and Freddie sneak off to Ms. Briggs' house with the pie-cam to shoot a video of what she is doing in her free time, at first is nothing but vacuuming. When a bee appears, and apparently is interested in the fake pie, Freddie panics because he is allergic to bees, and runs inside Ms. Briggs' house. Carly follows him, and they have to hide in a closet that turns out to be a shrine dedicated to Randy Jackson. They call Sam for help to distract Ms. Briggs, but are caught when Freddie steps on her bagpipes. Ms. Briggs threatens to suspend them and call the police unless she may appear on iCarly and play her bagpipes, so Carly, Sam, and Freddie reluctantly agree.

When Ms. Briggs appears on iCarly, the show starts losing viewers. Even worse is that it was their biggest audience yet by far (over 500,000 viewers), but Freddie manages to save it by playing funny videos on the green screen behind her back. The next day at school, students applaud Ms. Briggs and she thinks she's getting credit for her ""true musical artistry.""

He starts to let himself in when his cell phone rings. The caller says that Rendell Locke is dead, and they both know what happened. Mark goes in, says that he knows what he needs to know, and hangs up. Inside, Mark takes out plans of a manor and photos of a family, tosses them on the dining table, opens up a wall safe, and takes out a key in a case. After studying the key for a moment, Mark jams it into his chest and moans in pain. The key is absorbed into his chest, and tendrils of red energy spread through Mark's body before he bursts into flame. The flame spreads through the house, consuming it.

Three Months Later: Massachusetts

Nina Locke drives her family SUV down the highway. Her daughter Kinsey sketches, son Bode snaps a photo of the landscape, and older son Tyler dozes. Bode wants to play a game to pass the time, either I Saw a Monster, Whack-A-Bode or Serious Question, but Nina tells him not Whack-A-Bode. The boy settles on ""Serious Questions"" and asks which sense they would choose to lose. Tyler and Kinsey aren't interested in playing, and Tyler asks Bode instead what he would be doing if they were still in Seattle. Bode says he'd be playing Fortnite with friends. Tyler says he'd be on a French Club ski trip with an attractive girl, and Nina, responding to Bode's question, talks about how she and her husband Rendell would grind up lemons and put them in the garbage disposals of the houses they sold to cover up the smell of fresh paint.

The Lockes arrive on the coast. Bode admires the view while Tyler and Kinsey ignore it. Driving into the town of Matheson, Nina wants to stop and check it out. They stop at an ice cream shop. As they go in, Bode waves to an older boy, Rufus Whedon, also carrying a G.I. Joe action figure as he gets in his car with his mother (Jackie).

In the shop, the clerk (Scot Cavendish) chats with Kinsey and compliments her on her bracelet. He reads Nina's credit card and (clearly knowing who they are) welcomes them as newcomers with ice cream on the house. Kinsey insists that they don't need charity, but Scot tells her it's hospitality and welcomes them to Matheson. As the Lockes leave, Bode wonders how Scot knows them.

The Lockes press on through the forest and pass through the gates to pull up at Key House (a mansion), which belonged to Rendell. Bode is impressed, but Tyler and Kinsey aren't and wonder why Dad (Rendell) never brought them here. The children's Uncle Duncan comes out and greets them, welcoming them to their ancestral home. He hands out party hats and party horns to celebrate the occasion and leads them inside to show them around the ground floor. Tyler isn't impressed, and Duncan points out the steps to the basement.

Finally Duncan shows them the Great Room, complete with portraits of various Locke ancestors. They reach the kitchen and Nina tells her children to unpack and explore. Once apart, Duncan looks at Kinsey's sketches and she talks about how she'll be going to community college in the summer. Meanwhile, Tyler walks out into the forest to smoke, and finds a cliff overlooking the ocean. Kinsey comes up and says that he wouldn't smoke if their father was still there; Tyler points out that if their father was still around they'd be in Seattle. Kinsey asks Tyler if he's okay, noting that Tyler and Rendell fought a lot before Rendell died. Tyler asks if Kinsey is okay, and she says that she's fine, but it doesn't seem true.

Kinsey talks about how, when she first saw Key House, she wanted to text a picture to Rendell because he would have really liked it. She takes a selfie of herself and Tyler, and they look out at the ocean as they text the picture to their late father.

That night, Nina puts an urn with Rendell's ashes on the mantle. Kinsey sends the selfie, which Nina receives. ----- The Past: As Nina paints a stained glass window, Rendell comes in and jokingly asks her to check his work. Kinsey comes in looking for Bode, and Rendell suggests that she look in the basement. Sam Lesser arrives and says that he's there to see Mr. Locke. Rendell and Nina invite Sam in, but Rendell tells Sam to come by his school office on Monday and they'll talk then. Sam insists that it can't wait, draws a gun on Rendell, and tells him that he's going to tell him everything he needs to know. Rendell refuses to talk to the boy when he has a gun, so Sam shoots Nina in the leg (sending her crashing through her stained glass window) and demands to be told what he needs to know about Key House. When Tyler arrives at the front door, Rendell jumps Sam and is shot dead. ----- Bode goes outside and takes pictures of the forest for his collection. He finds the well house and takes a photo of it, and slips through the locked gate bars to get inside. Bode leans over the well opening and takes a photo, but the photo slips out of his Kodak and falls into the well. Bode turns to go, but when he looks back, the photo is sitting on the edge of the well. The boy picks it up and calls down into the well, asking if the person he assumes is inside is his echo. A woman says that she is, and tells Bode to believe. Scared, Body runs outside.

In the house, Nina asks Duncan if there have been any updates to the house. Duncan admits that he's been avoiding the place, and says that it's not a happy place. Nina wonders why they didn't sell it, and Duncan says that he wanted to but Rendell wouldn't allow it. He figures they can sell the house, but Nina says she needs a project and the kids need a home. Tyler comes in and tells them what Bode said about a girl in the well house. They go to where Bode stands outside the well house with Kinsey, and Duncan says that he doesn't have a key to the gate because the well is contaminated with seawater and there's no reason to go in. Bode insists that he heard a voice, and says that the woman said she was his echo. The others don't believe him and Nina takes him inside Key House.

The next day, Nina makes breakfast. Tyler finds an eggshell in his scrambled eggs and Nina apologizes. Kinsey comes in and says she's not hungry, and Nina turns on the garbage disposal. It jams on a tree root, and Kinsey complains that they're going to a boarding school. Her mother tells her and Tyler that going to a new school sucks - but then might not. They aren't convinced. Duncan comes in and says that he's heading back to work in Boston, and he'll be back the next day. The children leave, and Duncan gives Nina the house keys.

As Duncan packs up his car, he gives Key House the finger then notices Bode watching him from the porch. Duncan claims that there's more than one meaning to the middle finger - like saying aloha - and Bode happily gives Duncan the finger, thinking that it means ""goodbye.""

Kinsey and Tyler arrive at the boarding school in Matheson, brace themselves, then enter. Inside, they split up. At her locker, Kinsey overhears two girls talking about an upcoming party. One girl suggests to the other that they invite Kinsey, but the other (Jackie Veda) figures Kinsey to be a killjoy because of her late father. They refer to how Rendell died, but Jackie isn't convinced Kinsey deserves any special sympathy because of it.

Later, as Kinsey eats lunch alone on the stairs, she reads ""Your invitation To Hogwarts ISN'T COMING"" high on the wall. Scot, saying he's been looking for her everywhere, comes by with his lunch and asks Kinsey if he can join her. He tries to joke with her, saying that she's not boring, and introduces himself. He invites her to a thing that he and his friends, the ""Savini Squad,"" are having later. He tries to explain about Tom Savini when Kinsey feigns ignorance and realizes that she's messing with him. Kinsey declines, but Scot pings her the address and says that they'll be there when she's ready.

Tyler goes to hockey practice after school to try out and flashbacks to returning home and seeing Sam shoot Rendell. Players Javi and Brinker congratulate him on his playing and say that they can use him. They know about Rendell's death and, as trauma's a chick turn-on, tell him he should come to their party that night.

Bode skates through Key House. Nina invites him to come to the hardware store with her, but Bode declines and, giving her an aloha middle finger, goes to the kitchen to eat cereal and watch cartoons. Bode hears a voice whispering and dismisses it as nothing. Afterward he goes to the well house, slips through the gate bars, and calls down the well. The woman, ""Echo,"" says that he woke her up. She tells Bode that echoes can come to life at Key House and that she's his echo, and asks if he's found any keys yet. Echo says that there are lots of keys in the house, including one that can let him step out of his body and become a ghost, and another that can change the way you look. The best is the key that can take the user anywhere in the world if they know how to use it, Echo explains that it's made of gold and has six interlinked circles, and Bode should listen for them because they whisper. Bode confirms that he's heard whispering in Key House, and Echo says that only people who are special can hear them... like Bode. Nina calls to Bode, and Echo tells him not to tell anyone about her. Bode agrees and leaves.

In Kinsey's bedroom, Bode starts to tell Kinsey about what happened, but she isn't interested and, freezing, goes to take a hot shower. Bode notices that Kinsey's gold bracelet, left on the table, matches Echo's description and, hearing it whisper, removes the key hidden in it. He says that he wants to get some ice cream, concentrates on the ice cream parlor in town, and closes an open door. He uses the Anywhere Key to unlock it, and when he reopens the door he finds the ice cream parlor on the other side.

Bode takes the key, goes through the door, and closes it behind him. Scot, working, recognizes Bode, and Bode orders an ice cream cone. The boy realizes that he's really there, and Bode uses the Anywhere Key to go back through the door to Key House. Kinsey comes back from the shower and complains that Bode broke the bracelet which Rendell gave to her. Bode explains the key's power, but she figures he's just playing games and tells him to prove it by taking her to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The Key doesn't work, so Kinsey furiously shoves him out of her room.

Nina opens a box of Rendell's things from the attic and saddens as she finds his jacket. She also finds a photo of Rendell and other similar high school students. Kinsey comes in and asks Nina to tell Bode to stay out of her bedroom. Kinsey notices the photo and Nina explains that she found the box in the attic. Nina figures the box is of Rendell's high school friends. Scot texts Kinsey about the party, and Kinsey tells Nina that Tyler is with his new teammates. Kinsey wonders why they're at Key House when Rendell didn't want them to come there. Nina says that they needed a new start.

Bode hears whispering coming from the kitchen sink and reaches down the drain. He pulls out another key with two faces and a mirror on it. He goes to the well house and tells Echo that he found the Anywhere Key but it didn't work for Kinsey. Echo explains the Key didn't work because he's never seen a door at the Eiffel Tower, but since they're friends she can tell him anything he wants to know. She says that she lives in the well because of magic, and she gets so hungry sometimes. Bode says he could bring her some Doritos and that he found another key with two faces and a mirror on it. He asks what it does, and Echo asks what would be his one wish in the entire world. The boy says he wishes he could talk to his dad again, and Echo tells him that the Mirror Key will let him and his family see people who have died, and to show the Mirror Key to Nina.

At the hockey team's party, Tyler approaches Jackie and chats her up. Another girl, Eden, intrudes and Jackie leaves. Eden tells Tyler that, after what happened to his dad, everyone at school is there for him, including her, and they drink shots together. Soon after, they're in a bedroom making out, where Sam (a ghost? a memory?) appears bedside, telling Tyler that it's his fault Rendell is dead. Tyler utters ""No,"" and Eden, unable to see Sam, assumes he's talking to her. Tyler says he wants to continue fooling around with her but now's not the right time. He apologizes and quickly exits, leaving her confused.

Kinsey goes to Scot's house, where he introduces her to the other two members of the Savini Squad: Zadie Wells and Doug Brazelle. Kinsey isn't impressed, and Scot tells her that she's just in time. They watch 'Day of the Dead' and Zadie and Doug discuss it. Scot says that ""final girls"" only survive by fighting the monster. It triggers a traumatizing memory where Kinsey hid with Bode as a man approached them tauntingly saying he just wants to talk. Overcome, Kinsey runs from the room. Scot follows. Upset, she tells him that NOT all final girls win by fighting the monster, some of them hide, and some final girls are cowards. Scot says that they'll watch something else, but the damage is done; Kinsey leaves and walks home.

Spotting his sister while driving home, Tyler stops to pick her up. After a moment to register that it isn't Scot, Kinsey gets in.

Back at the house, Bode puts the Mirror Key into a door lock with a mirror hanging on the door. He proclaims that he wants to see his father and opens the door, but there's nothing on the other side. A keyhole appears on the mirror itself, and Bode tries the Mirror Key again. His smiling reflection beckons him into the mirror. Bode finds he can put his hand through the mirror but, scared, withdraws it and calls for Nina. Nina comes and, seeing the reflection of herself smiling and beckoning to her, enters the mirror despite Bode's misgivings. Once inside, she finds herself in a room filled with mirrors, but in reaching for her independently moving reflection, she touches a mirror surface. All the mirrors crack, and she calls to Bode for help.

In the real world, Bode's reflection approaches the mirror surface again, grinning. Seeking help, Bode runs to the well house and calls for Echo. Echo, appearing in full outside the well, tells Bode that she'll help him but needs him to give her the Anywhere Key. Once Bode gives it to her, Echo explains that the Mirror Key leads to the prison of the self, where many people have died, unable to get out - a fine place to trap your enemies. Echo, her true nature revealed, opens a door with the Anywhere Key and leaves. When Bode opens the door immediately afterward, there's nothing there except a storage closet with a coil of rope.

As Bode grabs the rope, Tyler and Kinsey return home. Bode gets back into Key House, tells his siblings what happened, and takes them to the mirror. Tyler's reflection motions to him to enter before walking off. Tyler calls to Nina, who can hear him. Kinsey ties the rope around Tyler's waist so he can find his way back, and then Tyler enters the mirror.

Inside the mirror world, Tyler touches the mirror surface. As it did for Nina, it cracks along with all the mirrors around him. The real Nina calls to him for help. Tyler closes his eyes and tells her to do the same and to follow his voice. They find each other and hold on tight as Tyler calls for Kinsey and Bode to pull them out. Success. The family hugs, and Bode, after taking the Mirror Key out of the lock, tells them that Key House is full of magical keys. Nina suddenly loses the memory of what just happened. She says she's fine, then leaves to put away laundry. Left alone in the room, the children wonder what Key House is.

In a prison, a guard tells Sam he has a visitor and takes him to the interview room, where he finds Echo waiting for him. She greets him by name and reminds him that she said she'd come see him."

Nina serves breakfast, says Duncan is coming in from Boston, and wonders why everyone is so quiet. Kinsey asks Nina if she remembers anything unusual, and Nina says that she's going to polish the mirror eventually. The hardware store makes a delivery and Nina goes to answer the doorbell. Kinsey tells Bode that maybe what happened didn't happen like they think it happened. She suggests mold made them hallucinate what happened. Bode figures that Nina doesn't remember because it's magic and because she's an adult. Bode uses the Mirror Key on a nearby mirror to prove that it was no hallucination.

Tyler comes down and, alarmed, sees Kinsey's reflection walk off. He asks Bode if the Mirror Key is the only one he found. Bode admits it is and that he lost the Anywhere Key. Tyler takes the Mirror Key figuring that they can't trust Bode to lose it as well. As Tyler and Kinsey meet up with the waiting Javi to ride to the academy, Kinsey wonders if Rendell knew about the keys. Tyler tells her to shut up about it so people don't think them any weirder. Javi says he's heard stories about Key House, including how a woman wandered in and went insane.

Bode turns on a toy light sword and explores Key House, holding his soldier action figure for companionship. A toilet flushes loudly and Duncan comes out of the bathroom, startling Bode, then walks off. Bode figures he needs a more powerful weapon and heads for one of the swords hanging over the mantle; however, he hears whispering coming from a vacuum cleaner and in it finds a key with a woman's face.

Javi drives Tyler and Kinsey to the academy, and Kinsey silently goes inside alone. The boys walk in, Brinker joins them, and Javi points out that he's been cool not asking yet about Tyler's previous evening with Eden. So, how was it? It was... good, says Tyler. As they reach the library, Tyler sees Jackie, who avoids him coldly.

As Nina cleans the house, Ellie Whedon enters and says her son Rufus has been taking care of the grounds. She offers locally made artisanal gin as a housewarming gift, which Nina accepts. Ellie says that she teaches Phys Ed at the academy part time and went there herself with Rendell. Nina recognizes Ellie from the photo she found and mentions it. When she shows it to Ellie, Ellie says that Lucas was her boyfriend and Rendell's best friend. Nina doesn't recall Rendell ever mentioning Lucas, and Ellie looks at her. Bernadette at the academy phones to say that they haven't yet received Nina' tuition payment plan. Nina says that the form must have gotten lost, and Ellie looks pensively at the photo. As Nina gets off the phone, Ellie says that she has to go and leaves.

Bode tries the new key on the basement door but it doesn't open. He takes a walk outside through the forest and finds an old cabin, where he tries the key again, unsuccessfully. Rufus comes up and apologizes for startling Bode. Rufus says that he lives in the cabin and is an excellent employee, and they talk about their G.I. Joe action figures. Since Rufus seems like a weapons expert, Bode asks what weapon to use against an unidentified enemy, and Rufus leads Bode into his cabin. He hands Bode a bear trap. Asked if he needs help, Bode says he has to handle the situation on his own. Rufus advises Bode that has to ask himself what his enemy wants, forcing Bode to wonder what Echo does want.

Echo sits in a diner, ponders the Anywhere Key, and eats ravenously. Once she's done, she dips two fingers in her hot coffee then goes to the restroom. She uses the Anywhere Key on the door and transports herself to a high-end dress shop, puts on a dress, then transports herself to a jewelry store. She steals an expensive necklace then transports herself through a door to a French dance club, where she hits on a young man. They end up in bed, and Echo tells him to choke her. Echo then flips it around and chokes him to death before leaving the bed.

In the academy lunchroom, Kinsey sits at a table by herself. Tyler comes in, deliberately avoids his sister, and sits with his teammates. Scot sits down with Kinsey and apologizes. Kinsey glares at him. Eden comes over and tells Scot that she's going to have her hair blown out because that's how she sees her movie character. Once she leaves, Scot explains that he and the other Squad members are making a horror movie. He invites Kinsey to join them on the set and assures her there won't be anything scary there.

Nina visits the school to pay the tuition, and the dean of 11th grade, Joe Ridgeway, talks to her in the hallway. He has Tyler as a student in his English class and figures Tyler is a bright kid but quiet. Joe assures Nina that he's going to look out for Tyler, who reminds him of Rendell. He explains that he was also Rendell's teacher, along with Ellie, Lucas, and the others. Joe mentions that they were a tight-knit group, and Rendell and his friends were always together. Joe says that it was a tragedy what happened to them, then realizes that Rendell never talked about it. The secretary calls Nina in to get one more signature, and Joe heads off to his class.

Tyler finds Jackie manning a table at the student activities fair. He tells her that nothing happened between him and Eden. Jackie says that Eden told her everything and suggests he tell Javi and Brinker what really happened.

-----

The Past:

Rendell calls Tyler into his office and suggests he make friends with freaky Sam. Tyler says that his friends always give him shit that he's already the guidance counselor's son, but Rendell isn't impressed and orders Tyler to do it.

-----

As Tyler leaves the activities group fair, Nina sees him and calls to him. They go outside and Tyler says it's only been two days and he barely knows his way to class. His mother says that she just wants Tyler and Kinsey to find happiness and asks Tyler to watch out for Kinsey, who doesn't make friends as easily as he. As Nina drives off, Tyler sees a boy with artificial legs (Logan) key Javi's car parked in the handicap spot. Logan notices Tyler watching him but just walks off.

Bode goes to a locksmith shop and shows him the key he found. The locksmith notes how light it is and asks where it comes from, and when he turns around to check his stock, Bode notices a keyhole on the back of the locksmiths' neck. He starts to put the key in the hole, but the man turns around with a jar full of old keys and invites Bode to take them because they're not worth anything.

Nina shops for hardware supplies and notices a hammer with blood on it.

-----

Flashback: After shooting Nina in the leg, Sam seeks where Kinsey and Bode are hiding. Kinsey crawls across the floor as Tyler pounds on the front door. Nina finally gets up and hits Sam in the head with a hammer.

-----

Nina looks at the hammer again, and there's no blood.

Kinsey gets to her locker and finds a copy of the script for Scot's movie, ""The Splattering,"" stuck in the door. She reads a little of the first page and chuckles, then Tyler comes up, his locker right next to hers. Kinsey doesn't like that he ignored her at lunch and starts to walk off, but Tyler grabs her backpack, pulls her back and apologizes, saying he's just trying to make it through the day without going crazy. Javi texts Tyler to join him, and Tyler quickly excuses himself, showing that his new friends mean more to him than his sister.

Ellie arrives at Key House to pick up Rufus; Nina invites her in. Over tea, Nina asks about the tragedy Joe mentioned. Ellie finally says that at the end of their senior year, there was an accident and three of their friends drowned in the nearby sea cave. They were partying after graduation and weren't thinking about the tides. Since she never talks about it, it's not surprising Rendell never did either.

Bode puts the bear trap on his bed and pries the rusty spiked jaws open. He loses his grip and the jaws snap shut, but he finishes prying the trap open into position, sets the lever, and covers it over with a blanket. Bode then puts one of the non-magical keys from the jar on top of the blanket over the bear trap.

Tyler, Javi and Brinker go to the liquor store, where Tyler sees Logan. Javi mentions that someone keyed his car; Tyler says nothing. Despite the fact they're underage, Brinker sneaks some alcohol with Javi, and they tell Tyler to follow their lead. When the elderly clerk stops them, Javi and Brinker shove past and run out, knocking him down. Tyler stays, helps the clerk up and asks the clerk to take back the beer he holds. By requirement, the clerk starts to call the police, but Logan comes over, claims the beer as his, shows the clerk his ID, claims he knows Tyler - Tyler Locke no less (which impresses the clerk) - then leaves.

Back at Key House, Bode checks the back of his own neck with a hand mirror, and watches as a key hole appears as he holds the key - the Head Key - near. He's curious what it does but decides against experimenting. Later, Echo cheerfully walks into his room using the Anywhere Key, saying she's had a fun day because of him (carnival music plays and she holds a stuffed bear prize). She notices the key on the bed and bends over to pick it up. The trap snaps shut, only biting off half of the stuffed bears's head. Echo asks Bode if he thought he could trick his ""friend,"" and Bode insists that, after trying to kill his mom, they're not friends. She tells him to try harder to find more Keys and to give them to her when he does. When Bode defiantly asks why he would do that, she grabs him by the throat and says that she otherwise won't be as nice next time. After a moment she lets Bode go, leaves him the damaged bear, and transports away using the Anywhere Key.

Kinsey watches the Squad set up for their movie, and Gabe comes in wearing the suit of a local legend monster, Amphropeta. He introduces himself. Scot explains that Gabe is new to Matheson as well. Eden hasn't read the script and is shocked that she's going to be drenched in ""blood,"" saying that it's either her or the blood. Voting, the Squad figures they'd rather have the blood, and Eden quits and leaves. Zadie suggests that Kinsey play the part, and Kinsey agrees despite Scot suggesting otherwise.

Once Scot serves a smoothie to Kinsey, he talks Kinsey through the role. They start shooting and Kinsey sits down next to the dummy filling in for her ""boyfriend."" Gabe comes in and slices off the dummy's head, at which point, in trying to scream, Kinsey has flashbacks to when Sam came after her and Bode. Kinsey hyperventilates but doesn't scream, then apologizes. Scot assures her that it's okay and they had to reshoot anyway.

Nina and Duncan share takeout, and Nina apologizes for Kinsey's and Tyler's absence. She finally asks why Rendell never mentioned the drowning incident, and Duncan says he doesn't remember any such incident. Nina wonders why Duncan doesn't remember it happening, and Duncan claims that Rendell was older than he and kept to himself. He finally says that the entire time period was rubbed out of his memories, and he doesn't understand it. Nina asks if Rendell ever mentioned Sam to him. Before Duncan can respond, Kinsey comes in, upset and covered in fake blood. She tells Nina that she's fine and goes to clean up.

In her room, Kinsey sits on her bed and remembers the past.

-----

Rendell gives Kinsey a present for graduating middle school. It's the bracelet, and Rendell said that he's had it for a long time. Rendell puts it on Kinsey's wrist and says that it's kind of a family heirloom and has always been special to him. When Kinsey notes that Rendell never talks about his family, her father says that they went in different directions, and his wife and children are all the family he needs and more than he ever deserved. He tells Kinsey to stick together with her brothers and hugs her.

-----

Kinsey holds the bracelet and breaks into tears.

Bode paces around his room and finally inserts the Head Key into the back of his neck. He turns it and then finds himself standing outside of his unmoving body. A large chest lies nearby that wasn't there before. After a moment, Bode opens its lid. Flashing lights shine out, and Bode looks at them in surprise and pleasure.

When Tyler comes home (seeming a little drunk), Kinsey tells him that she covered for him with Nina. He thanks her and asks what she wants from him. ""Nothing,"" she says, when he's in this state. Kinsey points out that Tyler used to talk to her but now never does when real shit is going on. Tyler insists that he's the same as always, but Kinsey tells him otherwise.

Tyler and Kinsey both spot Bode through the open door of his bedroom. They enter and find Bode standing still and staring off into space. The other Bode opens the chest lid from the inside and tells his siblings that they have to come see, making Tyler and Kinsey stare at each other incredulously."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8518204/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Locating a powerful new key sends Bode's spirit soaring. Tyler's simmering rage boils over.

A younger version of Bode jumps on a trampoline, and the real Bode explains that it's his glee, which has become a living thing here. He knows this because it's his head.

Bode turns the crank on one of a number of jack-in-the-boxes, and a light shines out into his face. All three Locke kids find themselves in Bode's memory of Rendell mounting glowing paper stars on the walls of Bode's bedroom (accurate to constellation patterns). Kinsey reaches for Rendell, desperate for connection, but her hand passes through him. Bode explains that it's a Memory-Rendell who can't hear them. Memory-Rendell tells Memory-Bode an original story about a sea monster, sailors and gold treasure. Midway through the tale, Memory-Bode falls asleep and the three siblings find themselves back in the arcade. Kinsey remembers that the story had a happy ending, but Tyler remembers it ending on a dark note.

The children emerge from the chest and Bode removes the key from his real body's neck. The trunk disappears and the real Bode emerges from his trance, saying the Head Key made it possible. He reveals that he hears Keys whispering in words he can't understand, but the whispering leads him to them. Bode wants to use the Head Key on his siblings, Tyler first, but they refuse. Tyler decides, since he's the oldest, that he'll hold onto the Mirror Key and the Head Key until they understand everything they do. Bode and Kinsey object, with Kinsey pointing out that Tyler's the least responsible, so Tyler reminds Bode that he already lost the Anywhere Key. Bode finally explains about Echo and says that he needs to protect the Keys. Kinsey decides that she'll take the Head Key while Tyler takes the Mirror Key. If Echo comes back, Bode should tell them right away.

At a café, Echo uses a customer's laptop to do a web search on Mark in Ohio. The customer comes over and protests. Echo ignores him and finds a picture of Mark's house. She gets up, rewards the customer with a kiss, then uses the Anywhere Key to transport herself to the house, now burned from the fire. Echo finds Mark's safe and opens it but doesn't find what she's looking for inside, figuring Mark knew she was coming.

Three neighborhood kids standing outside notice Echo. She sees that one of them has a key on a chain around his neck and comes out to ask where he got it. Echo offers to show him her Key if he shows her his. The boy comes over and says that his Key is like a lighter. At his insistence, Echo shows him the Anywhere Key and demonstrates how it works on the house's front door. It opens to a subway station. Echo grabs the boy's key and shoves him onto the tracks of an on-coming train. The train runs him over, and the other two boys run off.

The next day at the academy, Kinsey finds Scot waiting for her. He thanks her for her work on his film and gives her Band of Horses tickets as a gesture of thanks. He explains that they're for a Band of Horses local cover band and adds that the outing is just for him and Kinsey. She wonders if it's a date, and Scot assures her it isn't. He suggests they call it a hang, but Kinsey explains that she has things to do. Scot takes the tickets back to hold, in case, and Kinsey leaves her attendance as a ""maybe.""

Later on, Nina, Bode and Kinsey visit the hockey rink to watch Tyler play with his new team. Ellie arrives and greets Nina. Nina introduces Bode to Ellie then sends Bode to find them some seats. Ellie invites Nina to have dinner with her sometimes at an in-town restaurant.

As Kinsey finds a seat, she hears Jackie and Eden talk about Tyler. Eden notices Kinsey listening, and Jackie invites her to sit with them.

Tyler sits in the box, complaining that the coach hasn't brought him in yet. Javi explains that Tyler's good but new, and the coach is pretty loyal to his (regular) guys. Two players slam into the railing before them whereby a teammate must shake it off. Javi points out the other player as Chad Garland, an All-star dickwad.

After the game, Nina congratulates Tyler for his team's good effort. Tyler, dour, points out that the team lost by six points and that HIS efforts came entirely from the bench. He loads his gear in Nina's car and says he's going to Javi's. Jackie and her friends walk nearby, and Tyler asks her if she's going to the thing at Javi's. She is, so he offers her a ride, and she accepts. Jackie spots Chad, a ""douchey"" guy who hit on her and Eden shortly before. As Chad hits on Kinsey, trying to get her to go to a party with him, Tyler intercedes to ask Kinsey if she's okay. She is but wants to go home. Chad tells Tyler to relax, that they were just having a conversation, and advises Tyler to sit this one out - like he did most of the game.

Already simmering for a while, Tyler approaches Chad, and Chad shoves him away. Tyler shoves back, they fight, and Tyler, boiling over, knocks Chad to the sidewalk, beating him repeatedly. Kinsey tries to pull Tyler away but he shoves her back, knocking her down as he keeps beating Chad. For a moment, Tyler imagines Chad as Sam saying ""Feels good, doesn't it?"" Joe pulls Tyler off and tells him to walk away.

Later in the locker room, Joe tells Nina that Chad swung first but Tyler went too far. He warns that Tyler will probably be suspended from the team for a few weeks. Nina explains that Tyler has been defensive lately, which Joe understands, after what Tyler's been through.

Tyler waits outside the office to be taken home.

-----

Flashback: Tyler waits outside of Rendell's office at school. Sam comes over, and Tyler explains that he broke curfew last night by fifteen minutes, so Rendell is going to give him a lecture, the kind where everything he does wrong becomes, not just a mistake but, a moral lesson. Sam can relate and says he rises every morning thinking he must kill his own dad. Tyler laughs and jokingly asks him that, after killing his dad, to do him a favor and kill Rendell as well. Sam regards Tyler.

-----

Logan comes over to Tyler and warns him that anger will destroy him if he lets it, so don't. Tyler looks at Logan's artificial legs and asks about him wearing shorts. Logan laughs. ""My legs look cold to you?""

The next day at Key House, Kinsey sketches in the study. She gets a text from Scot reminding her about the cover band. She starts to text back that she'll go with him but reconsiders and avoids responding. She walks over to Tyler, mopping the foyer as punishment. He apologizes for pushing her the night before. Kinsey says that he was somewhere else, and it was scary, but doesn't want to talk about it. She then shares her decision to go inside her head using the Head Key. Tyler insists on going with her.

Now in Kinsey's bedroom, bracing for her head trip, Kinsey tells Tyler not to wander, touch anything or take anything. Once he agrees, Kinsey puts the key into her neck. Her ""real"" body goes rigid, and another Kinsey appears in front of a revolving door. She goes through it with Tyler following and they find themselves in a shopping mall representing Kinsey's head. There are no people, and the mall floors go up to the sky.

Kinsey realizes that each store represents some of her memories, and she finds a store representing her memories of Rendell. They go there and Kinsey takes out one of many color-coded cubes (green) with a memory of the first time Rendell took her to the top of the Space Needle. Tyler doesn't want to share it but comes over when Kinsey finds the memory of Rendell telling her an original story about a sea monster. In the story, the sea monster coughs up all of the sailors it swallowed and everyone is reunited. Tyler says his memory of the story doesn't have this light ending. In hindsight, Kinsey figures that, at the time, she should have asked for one more story. Young Memory-Tyler comes in and gives Memory-Kinsey Sally, the stuffed dolphin toy she left in his room.

Abruptly, Kinsey and Tyler find themselves out of the mall and in front of the boarding school's sports arena, watching a more savage Memory-Tyler beating Memory-Chad. A feral Kinsey walks toward them and disappears, leaving disembodied snarls around them. Feeling endangered, Tyler asks to get out of there, and the scene changes, accessing the memory of Seattle when Kinsey hid herself and Bode from Sam after he attacked their parents. The growing shadow of Memory-Sam approaches them, and Kinsey says she could have grabbed a poker (visually nearby) and hit Sam but, paralyzed by fear, she couldn't act.

Suddenly, Feral-Kinsey enters and attacks Tyler. Kinsey grabs the poker and stabs her feral self in the chest. It staggers back out of sight, and they go back through the revolving door. Kinsey removes the key, returns to her real body, and says that her feral self is her fear. Tyler's injury (a bruise on his waist) still exists in the real world. Kinsey insists that she didn't make her counterpart attack him, but Tyler's dubious. He tells Kinsey to let the matter go and leaves.

Tyler, later in his room listening to music, looks at photos of Jackie on her web page. When he reaches the last photo, he sets his phone aside and remembers Rendell's telling of the sea monster story. In Tyler's version, the sea monster left the fisherman alive and alone so he could remember all that happened, all the pain he had caused, for the rest of his days. Render, obviously troubled, tells Tyler that the past is always with them no matter how much they try to run away.

Nina and Ellie order at a restaurant, where Nina tells Ellie that she's a recovering alcoholic, on the wagon for six years. The worst part is the time she missed with her kids. They talk about Nina's children, and Nina says they're coping in their own ways - Kinsey anxious and overthinking, Tyler hiding out in his headphones, and Bode a tornado of energy. When Nina mentions Bode's scary ""imaginary"" friend in the well house, Ellie perks up but doesn't say anything further about it.

At Key House, Bode fetches a cookie and hears whispering. He follows the sound to a painting and, in it, finds a key with a skull on it (the Ghost Key). Using it on the basement door, it opens to the outside. When Bode steps through, his body collapses and his essence becomes a floating spirit. Bode flies around Key House and sees Tyler on an outdoor balcony. Tyler can't perceive Bode, so Bode flies off across the countryside.

He discovers a cave near the ocean and spots a cemetery. It's the family cemetery, where he finds another ghost - great-great-grandfather Chamberlin Locke - who explains that he passed away many years ago. He introduces himself and is happy to learn that Key House has new residents. Chamberlin hasn't seen Rendell in a long time, and explains that only those who've died on the property can roam there. Some have crossed over but Chamberlin preferred to stay. He, Rendell and Duncan used the Ghost Key to fly around and explore.

Bode hears Nina's car pulling up and says that he'll visit Chamberlin again. Flying back to Key House, Bode spots Ellie. She uses a key to let herself into the well house and calls down the well to Lucas. There's no answer, so Bode moves on.

While looking for food in Key House, Tyler seeks Bode and finds his body comatose on the floor. Bode returns to his body as Tyler, alarmed, tries to wake him up. Bode explains about the Ghost Key, but Tyler is furious that Bode screwed around with it. Bode says he just thought he could find their father's ghost.

Nina comes into Kinsey's room and finds her going through her art samples, trying to select one to send along with her application. Her mother suggests that Kinsey get out of the house and clear her mind. Kinsey references her date offer from Scot but says she doesn't want to go and possibly screw things up. She worries that Scot will get hurt eventually or hurt her. Nina tells her to go, promising her daughter she'll have fun and could never disappoint.

Scot waits outside the venue where the cover band is playing. Kinsey arrives and sees Scot, but he doesn't see her. She looks at the Head Key and then walks away.

Tyler helps put up the glowing star stickers on Bode's bedroom wall. Tyler wonders why Rendell wouldn't have told them if he used the Keys, figuring that Rendell didn't want his kids to use them. Bode supposes he forgot, like Mom did with the mirror, and suggests that, if Rendell hated Key House, it could be that he was scared of Echo. Tyler tells Bode that he and Kinsey are there for him.

In the forest, Kinsey uses the Head Key to enter her own head.

Nina lies on her bed and wistfully looks through Rendell's high school yearbook. She finds an omega symbol that Rendell drew on many of the pages and remembers seeing the same symbol tattooed on Sam's wrist when Sam demanded answers about Key House from Rendell.

Kinsey drags a body in a bag out of the revolving door. Feral-Kinsey, inside, tries to claw its way out, so Kinsey punches it unconscious. She tosses it in a hole along with a bloodied knife. As KInsey begins to bury them, Echo watches from the shadows then walks away, seemingly satisfied."

Nina compliments her daughter on her look, and Kinsey says she's starting to feel more like herself. She explains that she's decided to make some changes. Tyler enters and is surprised to see Kinsey cooking. Bode joins them and they start eating. Nina realizes that Kinsey finally picked a drawing for her application, but when she offers to mail it, Kinsey snatches it from her hand and says she'll do it herself, off-handedly commenting that organizational things aren't Nina's forte and that Rendell always took care of things while Nina was busy with her art and fixing up houses. At being told she doesn't have to do everything, Nina leaves, offended.

Tyler asks Kinsey what her attitude towards their mother was about. Kinsey insists she was just being honest, but Tyler insists that she's not being normal.

Outside the academy, Kinsey tells Tyler that she took the fear monster out of her head and buried it. She insists that she's now better than fine while Tyler, alarmed, warns her that it isn't a game. Kinsey says she feels good for the first time since Rendell died, and insists that Tyler not kill her buzz.

Kinsey meets with the Savini Squad and shows them a poster she made for their movie. They love it. She says she's back in their movie if they'll have her. They all look over at Scot, sitting alone, so Kinsey goes over to him and apologies for standing him up at the cover band performance. She offers to make it up to him, and Scot tells her that he's fine with their just being friends. Kinsey tells him that she likes him and they should hang out, and a surprised Scot agrees. She invites him to Key House and Scot says that he'll see her later. Once Kinsey leaves, the Squad comments on how Kinsey has changed. Scot figures that she looked brighter.

Ellie meets Nina at Key House and they have coffee. Nina asks her for help getting in touch with some of Rendell's old friends and learning more about them. Using the old photo, she points out Erin Voss and Mark Cho, and Ellie says that Erin still lives around there but is in a psychiatric hospital. She explains that Erin had a stroke and hasn't spoken in twenty years. Mark died in a house fire a few months back, and Ellie admits that she's the only one left. She talks about how it's therapeutic to be back at Key House. Rendell's parents were never around, making it an adult-free zone. She mentions a ping-pong room down in the basement.

The two women descend to the basement and discover that the old ping-pong room has been walled over. Nina breaks through with a crowbar and they enter. Ellie finds a case and removes something from it, but dismisses it as nothing when Nina notices. Nina asks if Ellie remembers Rendell drawing the omega symbol, and Ellie says she doesn't. When Nina tries the door of an old wardrobe, she discovers that it's locked and Ellie says she doesn't know where the key is. Nina wishes she had known Rendell when he was in high school.

At the McClellan Psychiatric Hospital, Erin sits in a wheelchair in the common room. An orderly brings in a visitor - Echo, who is using the name ""Chastity."" Once they're alone, Echo tells Erin that it's been a while and asks what happened to her. Erin doesn't respond. As Echo trims Erin's nails, she says that Rendell is dead but it wasn't her fault. (Erin shuts her eyes in reaction.) Echo says that Mark is dead as well, also not her fault. Echo comments that Erin's inability to communicate isn't making this easy. Undeterred, Echo says she just needs to figure out a way to get into Erin's head and whispers that she'll be back soon, distressing Erin.

At the academy, Tyler attends the activities fair and notices the sign for the 5k run. Joe asks if he can help him, and Tyler says he's looking for Jackie. Joe says Jackie asked him to fill in while at choir practice and leads Tyler off, talking about boxing. Joe talks about how he signed up as a sparring partner for a top-ranked boxer, took a swing at him, and missed. The boxer took Joe down, and that's when Joe decided that he would be an English teacher. Joe asks where Tyler's ""shadows"" are - Javi and Brinker. Tyler is on his own, and Joe tells Tyler that new can be very good.

Bode walks back to Key House and finds Rufus cleaning up the porch. ""Afternoon, soldier."" He asks if Rufus's mom ever mentioned Lucas. Rufus says Lucas was Ellie's first love. Lucas died and Ellie still mourns him. Bode asks Rufus about the well house, and Rufus says that bad stuff happened there and he's not allowed to go near it. The British used Key House as a base during the Revolutionary War, and defectors were hanged in the well house.

Bode goes to his bedroom and takes out a book he got on the history of Matheson, which talks about how Key House is one of the oldest remaining structures in Matheson. Echo appears in the photo of the well house, calling to Bode. She says that Bode can't protect ""them."" Bode slams the book shut and throws it to the floor.

Jackie and Eden approach Tyler at his locker. Jackie asks Tyler when he wanted to meet up to sign up sponsors for the 5k, saying Mr. Ridgeway (Joe) told her Tyler wanted to volunteer. Though surprised, he assures Jackie that he wants to volunteer; Eden makes a snarky remark and leaves for Jackie's car. Jackie apologizes for Eden and has Tyler enter his number on her cell phone. He compliments her British flag phone case, and she declares herself an Anglophile.

Tyler finds Joe watering planets in his classroom and asks why he volunteered him for the 5k. High school, says Joe, is the perfect time to try on different hats, to find out who you are, and with whom you surround yourself. Tyler says it feels like people have already made their minds up about him - new kid, dead dad, weird house. Joe advises him to get over his grief for Rendell's death by letting people in. Joe talks about how he used plants to find something in common with his future wife. Tyler warmly asks if Joe plays Cupid with all his students, and Joe admits to a soft spot for underdogs.

At Key House, Bode plugs numerous keyholes with gum to keep Echo from coming in. He spots Tyler in Kinsey's room and tells him that she keeps the Head Key he's searching for in her sock drawer. When Bode wonders what's in it for him not to tell Kinsey anything, Tyler takes Bode to his room and notices the gum. Bode explains that the well lady might come back. Tyler asks if she came back, and Bode says not exactly but Tyler would have to see her for herself. Moving on, Tyler explains that he thought he could put something into his head (the history of Matheson book) since Kinsey took something out. He puts the Head Key into his own neck, and a door appears in the middle of the room. Another Tyler appears, and Bode recognizes the door as the front door of their house in Seattle.

As a precaution, Bode rips out the page with the photo of the well house (where Echo recently appeared) then hands it back to Tyler. Tyler opens the door, tosses the book inside, and closes the door without entering. He asks Bode to ask him something about Matheson, and now knows everything from the book. He then asks if they have a book on England.

Nina, sanding furniture, stops to drink some soda from a mug as she remembers the past.

-----

Rendell finds Nina refinishing a chair cushion and admires her work. He gives her the mug as a one-year anniversary present (for remaining sober) and says that it's a big deal. Nina thanks him and they share a toast with soda. He says that when he left home, he wanted different places and different faces... and he found the best one.

Nina breaks into tears at the memory.

Jackie and Tyler walk through Matheson, gathering sponsors for the run. Tyler drops tidbits of knowledge about England that he picked up from the book, and she explains that she calls herself an Anglophile because she's a huge Jane Austen fan, favoring little-known ""Sanditon"" over popular fan favorite 'Pride and Prejudice.' He admits that he hasn't read 'Sanditon,' and Jackie talks about Austen at some length, and how it probably isn't Tyler's thing

Scot drives Kinsey to Key House in his rickety car and mentions the three kids that drowned at the sea caves near the cliffs. Inside, Kinsey explains that her family is away and they have the whole place to themselves. She asks what they should do, and then (to Scot's relief) suggests a tour. Kinsey shows Scot the drawing room and the winter study before taking him to her room. (Nervously, Scot wipes his hands and checks his breath as he ascends the stairs.) While Kinsey sits on the bed, Scot awkwardly looks at the things on her dresser. She finally invites him to sit next to her and then says she wants to show him something but swears him to secrecy.

Once Scot agrees, Kinsey demonstrates the Head Key. The revolving door and the other Kinsey appear, assuring Scot that he's neither dead nor hallucinating. She leads him into her head and through her mental interior shopping mall, explaining about the Keys and how magic is real for them. Scot figures that she's joking with him and insists that it's crazy. Kinsey shows her the candy shop filled with her Dad memories, and shares a memory of when Rendell took her to an aquarium for her eighth birthday. Memory-Nina comes over and points out another exhibit to Memory-Kinsey, and Head-Kinsey scowls.

The memory ends and Scot is happy to know that magic exists. As she looks sad, Scot asks if she's okay, and Kinsey says she always thought it was just her and Rendell that day, no Nina. Nina was always there, and Kinsey can't believe she blocked out the memory of her mother. When Scot assures her that it's okay, Kinsey kisses him, and after a moment he kisses her back, right on the mouth.

At the library, Tyler picks out a book on Jane Austen, where Jackie finds him. He hides the book behind his back and says that it's research, but finally shows it to her. He suggests that it was sexist for her to think he might not enjoy Austen, then invites Jackie to have clam chowder with him at Phil's (a diner). Jackie agrees on having chowder but says they should go to Bill's, a better eatery. They argue about best restaurants before Jackie leads Tyler out to rock his taste buds at Bill's.

That night, Tyler visits Kinsey in her room and brings her oyster crackers. She realizes that he went out with Jackie and says that she's happy for him. He compliments her new hair and figures that the Head Key can't be so terrible if it made her better. He explains that he used the Head Key himself and it worked out. A door slams in Key House and they wonder if it's Bode.

Bode hears the same noise and goes to investigate, gripping a sharp wooden stake for protection. More doors slam, and when Tyler and Kinsey come out, Bode tells them Echo is back. More doors slam, and Bode tells his siblings that Echo wants the Keys. Light bulbs explode, and the Lockes see Echo down the hallway.

In the kitchen, Nina goes through the mail. Echo touches the oven with the Lighter Key and the burners burst into flames. Nina turns to see the flames, but Echo is gone.

The Locke siblings hear the smoke detector and head downstairs to check on Nina. Echo grabs Bode at the rear and pulls him into a room, closing the door behind them. She grabs his stake, casually tossing it away, then tells the boy to give her what she wants. When Bode refuses, Echo uses the Anywhere Key to transport them both away.

Kinsey and Tyler reach the kitchen and help put out the fire. Asking Nina if she saw anyone, they realize that Bode is gone. Tyler searches for Bode upstairs but doesn't find him, but coming downstairs he sees an intense ring of fire burning outside of Key House.

Walled by flames from the ring, Echo has Bode and demands the Head Key so she can ""find something."" Tyler sees their shapes inside the ring but can't get through the fire. Bode holds up the Head Key but realizes that Echo can't take it from him; she needs him to give it to her. Smart boy. Echo says she can be clever as well, tells him to stay tuned, walks out of the ring, and uses the Anywhere Key to teleport away.

With her departure the flames disappear, and Tyler runs to Bode, hugging him. Inside Key House, Kinsey cleans up the kitchen and Nina wonders how the fire started. She wishes Rendell was there, and Kinsey tells her that she was wrong about what she said earlier, saying she realizes Nina was always there for her. Nina assures her that it's fine.

Echo visits the prison and Sam's cell. She tells him that he's there because of his own mistakes, but she's back like she promised and always keeps her promises. She asks if he can keep his promises, and Sam replies that he'll do anything she wants. She warns that he can't stray from the path and she needs to know if she can trust him. Sam says that she always can, and Echo slips the Lighter Key to him through the mesh. He takes it, looks at it, then looks at Echo."

While she waits to meet with Detective Daniel Matuku, she calls Ellie but gets no answer. Matuku finally meets with her and they talk in his office. She insists it wasn't a suicide as the police think. Matuku asks if she has any evidence, and Nina can only play back the voice message of Joe saying there was something she needed to see. Nina had seen Joe earlier and between the two, SHE was the one upset. Matuku asks what Nina was upset about, and Nina says Joe was helping her make sense of Rendell's death.

Matuku says he has to go with the evidence, and the evidence points to suicide. He refuses to give Nina any more details, including whether or not he's spoken to Ellie. As Nina goes, she sees a box of Joe's things on Matuku's desk, including a photo of Joe. Matuku refuses to let her go through the contents.

At Matheson Academy, Tyler looks at a high school photo of Rendell running track in a trophy case and remembers the memory he saw of Rendell attacking one of his friends. Jackie comes along and Tyler hides the Memory Key he was examining. She points out the memorial to Joe, calls his death crazy, and asks Tyler if he still wants to come over later. He says he does, and Jackie walks off.

Scot and Kinsey meet with the Savini Squad. Scot suggests that the footage they've shot wasn't very good. He's written a few extra scenes to improve the film, of which he and Kinsey already shot one. Doug gets a text from the owner of the Matheson docks denying them permission to film there for liability reasons. Scot says they should think about where else to shoot their pivotal scene and to regroup the next day.

Kinsey goes home, lays on her bed, and looks at a photo of her and Rendell. She gets an idea, takes out a bag of memory jars from beneath her bed and looks at the one of a young Rendell in the sea cave with his friends.

Kinsey goes down to where Duncan is working and asks if it bothers him that he doesn't remember pieces of his childhood. Duncan says it doesn't. Kinsey opens the bag to reveal the memory jars. She suggests that someone took them out of Duncan's head, and Duncan stares at one. After a moment, Duncan sets the jar aside and clutches at his head, saying he feels queasy. Kinsey says it was a bad idea, closes the bag, and Duncan immediately and entirely forgets what just happened. Nina calls for Duncan to help with dinner and he goes, leaving Kinsey to ponder.

Working on homework at Jackie's house, Jackie asks Tyler if he's good, because he keeps staring at a photo. They kiss but he quickly withdraws when she brushes the Key on a chain beneath his shirt. Tyler says he should start going. Jackie asks if she did something wrong, and Tyler assures her she didn't. He confirms that he'll be there to help set up the 5k run fundraiser and leaves.

Tyler returns to Key House and barely gets inside before Kinsey insists on showing him something. She takes him to her room and explains what happened with Duncan. Tyler remarks that they already know adults can't remember magic, but Kinsey points out that Duncan fixated on the memory of Rendell and his friends going to the sea caves. There's a blue light in the cave, and Kinsey figures that something happened to their father and his friends there. She wants to go there and asks Tyler to come with her, but he refuses. Kinsey insists, and Tyler, pushed too far, angrily tells her that he's done with everything. He tosses her the Head Key, says that all of the Keys are now hers, and walks out.

The next day, everyone in town gathers for Joe's service. Tyler avoids sitting with Jackie. Nina sits next to Ellie and asks why she's avoiding her. Ellie tells Nina to come out with her and walks out. Nina goes after her.

Outside, Nina asks how Ellie and Rendell got the same scar. Ellie says that they did it to themselves along with Mark and Erin. They pressed a hot poker to their chests as a way to remember their dead friends. Ellie says it's none of Nina's business and that's why she didn't tell her when she asked earlier. Nina asks where Ellie was the night Joe died. Ellie says home, but Nina knows it's a lie and says so. Having known Joe for twenty-five years, Ellie angrily insists that Nina, knowing him only a few months, didn't care about Joe like she did. Ellie says that she tried really hard to be Nina's friend, then goes back inside.

Scot shows the Squad footage he shot of Kinsey walking through the woods and the off-screen sea monster grabbing her, which Gabe jokingly (but knowingly) calls ""magical."" Scot points out that they still need to find a location for their final showdown. After Doug and Gabe spit out a couple unworkable ideas, Kinsey suggests the sea caves, which Scot points out are nicknamed ""The Drowning Caves"" for a reason. She says she's been down there and it'll be safe if they're careful. Doug and Zadie object, but Gabe loves the idea and calls them killjoys. Kinsey says the resulting footage won't look like some cheap, hacky, home-made film, and Gabe puts it to a vote - unless there's a better idea (which there isn't). Scot gives in.

Early morning at Key House, Bode hears whispering and follows it to an old sewing room. He finds and removes a Key, inserted in a sewing machine, and takes it to a cabinet in the kitchen (the very cabinet Nina found in the sealed ping pong room weeks before). He puts on a biking helmet and unlocks the cabinet but finds nothing inside. Thinking it might be a ""Narnia"" situation, he steps in and closes the door, but still nothing happens. He opens the door and steps out; nothing has changed.

Nina comes in, greets Bode, notices the Key in his hand, and congratulates him for finding it. Kinsey comes in and asks if they have flashlights but won't say why she needs them. Kinsey exits and Matuku calls Nina.

In his office, Matuku tells Nina they found no signs at Joe's to indicate anything other than suicide. He says that the only thing in the box were photographs from when Joe was a yearbook advisor and that Nina is welcome to have them now that they're no longer evidence.

Bode finds Duncan sleeping on the couch, wakes him, and asks if he wants to go out exploring with him. Duncan says that he's still fighting a migraine from earlier, so Bode goes.

Finding Bode alone in the cemetery, Echo approaches and gives him one last chance to give her the Keys. Bode refuses, and Echo tells him that he has no idea what is coming. She says it will destroy Bode's family and he'll be the one responsible. She walks off.

In prison, Sam uses the Fire Key Echo gave him to burn through his cell door and escape. He walks out, setting the place on fire as he goes. When a guard arrives, Sam sets him on fire with the Key and walks out of the burning prison.

Tyler prepares for the day and gets a photo invite to a drinking party celebrating Joe's life. Tyler looks over at the box of 5k donations and then texts that he'll be at the party.

Nina looks at her framed photo of Rendell and his high school friends then dives into photos from Joe's box, finding a photo of Rendell with Ellie. Duncan comes in to say he's leaving and notices the photos. Nina explains that she's looking for something but doesn't know what, and insists that she's not crazy. She says she thinks she messed things up with Ellie, and mentions the scar. Duncan doesn't remember the scar on Rendell - another lost memory of his younger days. Nina only knows something feels off. Duncan offers to take everyone to Boston, where he and Bryan will take the kids out so Nina can rest, but Nina says she's okay to stay and hugs her brother-in-law.

The Squad enters a sea cave (a.k.a. the Drowning Cave) and admires the atmosphere. Kinsey privately seeks the spot where she saw blue light in Duncan's memory and leads the group further into the cave. The others balk, but Kinsey insists it's safe and that the footage will be worth it. Gabe sides with Kinsey, and Kinsey drops into a lower tunnel. First Gabe then the others follow.

Kinsey climbs into a side tunnel, with Gabe following, and hears the same whispering as from the Keys. Gabe and the others arrive and admire the setting. Kinsey continues on to another chamber where she finds a round wooden door with a blue light glowing around its edges. There's a door knob with an omega symbol and a keyhole on it. Kinsey peers through the keyhole.

Meanwhile, Zadie discovers the cavern filling with seawater, cutting off their route, and the Squad realizes the tide is coming in. Scot orders them to pack up everything because they're leaving and realizes that Kinsey isn't there. Gabe tells the others to leave and he'll find her.

Gabe finds Kinsey at the wooden door.

Scot swims down and confirms the seawater has already come in to the previous cavern. They must abandon their equipment and swim for it. Zadie and Scot help Doug out.

Gabe tells Kinsey they have to go, but she refuses.

Scot, Doug, and Zadie swim to the first cavern

Kinsey reluctantly goes with Gabe, and goes first into the seawater.

The trio reach the first cavern in the air and wonder about Gabe and Kinsey.

Gabe and Kinsey swim through the cave and emerge into an air pocket between caverns. They catch their breath and continue swimming, reaching the first chamber where Scot helps Kinsey out (leaving Gabe on his own). Scot berates Kinsey that they could have died, and Kinsey apologizes. Zadie points out that they lost all of their gear, which Kinsey says she'll replace. Scot accuses Kinsey of abandoning them and doesn't buy her excuse of only finding them a good location. Did she even care about the film at all? She snaps at him, saying that she has more to worry about than his stupid movie, and Scot, stunned by the word ""stupid,"" says he never should have trusted her and walks away. Zadie and Doug go with him, and Gabe looks at Kinsey.

Reaching a basement to dry off, Kinsey acknowledges that Gabe saved her life. He wonders what that door was, and Kinsey figures it has something to do with the Keys. She says she doesn't have anything, including the Squad, and Gabe tells her to give the group some time to get over it. Kinsey admits she knew nothing about the cave. Gabe says he's glad they went there and assures her that she's a bad-ass with energy that makes people want to follow her. He admits he likes the fearless Kinsey, and Kinsey, feeling low, kisses him. After a moment, he kisses her back.

As Tyler attends the party, Jackie texts him to ask where he is. He ignores her, and Logan, spotting him, asks why he's there when the 5k is happening at the same time. Jackie was expecting him. Tyler says he figures Jackie probably has it under control and excuses himself to get another drink. Javi and Brinker greet him, saying they miss having Tyler on the team. Echo comes in, approaches Tyler, and asks where she can get a drink. Tyler offers her his drink, but then, at her making a face, offers to get her something better than the ""vodka and Kool-Aid"" he was having.

As Tyler and Echo hit it off, drinking and talking, Javi tells Brinker that Tyler is a lucky bastard... until he spots Jackie storming in. Javi quickly warns Tyler, and Echo tells Tyler she'll see him around but was sorry they couldn't spend more time together.

Jackie confronts Tyler saying she can't believe he blew her off. Tyler tells her he's doing her a favor by not showing, better sooner than later. Jackie wishes he'd tell her what he's going through, but Tyler says she really can't understand. In response, she starts angrily gulping down vodka and asks if she can understand him now. He tells her to go home but she insists that she's having fun and tells Tyler to go home. Tyler tells her she deserves better, and Jackie says that they at least agree on something. Tyler nods and leaves.

Walking home, Tyler visits a Quick-Stop where he sees Echo, lingering outside and asking how it went with ""what's-her-name"" (Jackie). Echo holds up a bottle of whiskey and invites Tyler to not let her drink alone. After a moment he follows her off.

Bode finds Kinsey unpacking in her room and asks if she has all of the Keys. He explains that Echo came back and said something bad was going to happen to the family and that it would be Bode's fault. Kinsey says Echo is just trying to scare him and reminds him that Echo can't take the keys. Bode refuses to leave Kinsey's side and reluctantly agrees to help her carry boxes up from the basement.

At her home, Echo drinks with Tyler outside by her truck, but she figures that he's mentally somewhere else. Tyler says it's been a weird night, and Echo tells him he deserves a night off from his self-loathing. As Tyler drinks, Echo points out it can be freeing when one gets out of one's own head and invites him into her truck. Should she be driving? Who said anything about driving? When Tyler says he should get home, Echo leaves it up to him. Tyler asks her name and she says it's Dodge, then gets into her truck. After a pause, Tyler gets in with her.

Duncan heads back to Boston. After he drives through the automated Key House gates, Sam slips through and onto the grounds before they close, ominously approaching the house."

A biology teacher presents a film on dissecting a pig. The teacher leaves to get some pins, whereby Sam starts playing with his dissection pig, ""oinking"" to the tune of Jingle Bells. The other students laugh, and Sam gets up and makes the pig ""dance."" He walks to the front and slams the pig down, shocking the students. The teacher returns, stopping Sam's performance.

Guidance counselor Rendell Locke calls Sam into his office and tells him the principal wants to give Sam three weeks of detention - and it hasn't even been a week since Sam's last incident. Sam says people were laughing and he just got carried away, but it lately seems that Sam has been getting carried away a lot. Rendell asks what's going on with Sam, and Sam says he doesn't know. The teenager admits that things aren't the best at home but okay. Rendell tells him that he's been in Sam's shoes, has screwed up a lot, and wants to help him. As Rendell speaks of vocational school, Sam ""hears"" the painting of Key House on the wall calling to him in Dodge's voice. Dodge says she sees him, and Sam nods in blind agreement when Rendell asks how his vocational school plan sounds.

Sam asks Rendell about the house in the painting, and Rendell says it's his family's home in Massachusetts. The counselor says that it reminds him of where he came from and makes him appreciate where he is. Sam looks at it thoughtfully.

-----

Now.

An armed Sam walks toward Key House.

Sam breaks in and walks through its hallways, wincing briefly at the bloody wound on his hand where he broke a window. He grabs a dishrag to stop the bleeding and continues searching.

In the basement with Bode, Kinsey finds her old stuffed dolphin doll, Sally, and remembers. Bode worries about what Dodge said and thinks they should call Tyler, but Kinsey lost her phone in the sea caves.

Stopping to eat a banana, Sam finds Nina's phone on the kitchen table and pockets it, then walks upstairs.

In her bedroom, Nina looks through Rendell's high school photos from Joe's box. Sam peers in through the doorway then continues on his way. He confirms that Kinsey's bedroom is empty, then goes into Tyler's bedroom, closing the door behind him, which Nina hears creak shut.

Sam finds Tyler's clothing in the closet, changes into them, and examines a healed scar on his forehead. Nina comes down the hall, calling to her children. No one responds.

Kinsey and Bode come upstairs with the last of Kinsey's things from the boxes. Bode wants to use Nina's phone to call Tyler and see if he's safe. Kinsey sees the broken window and blood. Since Dodge can enter through any doorway, it can't be her. They see the blood trail lead upstairs and wonder who it is.

Nina enters Tyler's room and finds Sam waiting for her, aiming his stolen gun at her. He asks her not to scream, and Kinsey, hearing him, tells Bode to hide while she helps Nina. Instead, Bode takes out the Ghost Key and asks Kinsey to guard his body and keep the door open. He unlocks the door and passes through it, and his spirit leaves his body.

Bode's spirit flies aloft and passes through a wall into Tyler's room, finding Sam and Nina. Neither of them can see Bode's spirit form. Sam asks after the Head Key, but Nina doesn't know anything about it. Sam doesn't believe her but figures the kids will know and asks where they are, at which point Bode returns to his body and reports to Kinsey that Sam has a gun, and Nina, and wants the Head Key (about which neither Bode nor Kinsey can figure how he knows).

Kinsey hides the Head Key inside Sally, sets it down, then runs off with Bode. They come to an abrupt stop meeting Sam and Nina downstairs, where Sam calmly demands the Head Key. When Kinsey claims she doesn't know what it is, Sam puts his gun to Nina's head and asks if she knows how much he doesn't like being disrespected. He knows Kinsey knows what he's talking about. Bode presents the Ghost Key, figuring Sam won't recognize it and can't take...

Sam easily snatches the Key before Bode can say ""it,"" but says it's not how ""she"" said it's supposed to look. Bode realizes that he's talking about Echo, and says that Sam should try the Key. Sam refuses, pockets the Ghost Key, and searches Bode for other Keys but finds nothing. He asks Kinsey what she has. She takes out the Music Box Key, but Sam realizes it's not the Head Key. After he pats Kinsey down and doesn't find it, he demands to know where it is. Kinsey says Tyler has it, so Sam says that they'll wait for Tyler and eat while they wait.

In Dodge's truck, Tyler and Dodge drink (a game where he drinks then she), and then they kiss and start undressing.

Sam has tied Nina, Kinsey and Bode to kitchen chairs and serves them all turkey tetrazzini from the microwave - with spoons, no sharp forks. He invites ""catch up"" conversation, whereby he mentions he escaped from prison (obvious to all). Kinsey asks him about his brain swelling after Nina fractured Sam's skull with a hammer - a shame she didn't finish. Sam tells her to shut up and eat.

-----

The Past.

At home, Sam makes burned toast for his sister Lindsey. Their father Randy comes in and says that they didn't ask permission to make breakfast. And why'd he serve Lindsey his cola when there's plenty of water in the tap? Sam tells Randy to leave Lindsey alone, and Randy orders Sam to hit him, calling him a ""wimp"" when he doesn't. When he mock-throws a punch at Sam, Sam flinches but doesn't block it, and Randy sternly reminds him what he taught him about blocking punches - expect a right punch, raise your left to block, and throw a right of your own. Randy mock-throws another punch and Sam blocks it but doesn't throw a right.

Someone knocks at the door, and Sam, saying it's his friend (""Who??!"" chuckles Randy), goes to the door. Randy goes with him, and invites Tyler in, who's come early after hockey practice. Sam says that they should go and starts to walk away, and Randy (all friendly now) tells Tyler that he'll see him around.

-----

Now.

Sam drinks cola from the bottle, and Nina recalls the omega symbol tattooed on his arm. She asks him about it, and he immediately talks about Rendell. He asks what they think Rendell would say if he was there, and Kinsey says that she would have told him to have Sam committed before he destroyed their family. Sam says that he'd tell Rendell it was all his fault and always has been. Nina asks why it's Rendell's fault, and asks who sent him to their house in Seattle. Sam insists that Dodge cares about him and needs the Keys, and Bode realizes he's talking about the well lady, Echo, who has been stalking them. He asks why Dodge wants the Head Key, and Sam explains that it will let her get into people's heads, as someone knows how to open the Black Door. Nina wonders if Dodge told Sam to kill Rendell, and Sam sarcastically asks them to remind him why he has to answer any of their questions.

After sex, Dodge asks Tyler what they do now because the night is still young. Tyler figures he should go, and Dodge sees him pick up the Anywhere Key from among her clothing. She suggests that they drive to the lighthouse for a second round and asks for the Key back, then makes it a demand. Tyler, with awareness dawning, invites her to take it from him, and when Dodge screams in frustration, he gets out of the truck quickly and runs off. Dodge chases him and Tyler uses the Anywhere Key to escape through the Quick-Stop door back to his bedroom.

Heading downstairs, Tyler hears Sam talking to the others. He tackles Sam, knocking the gun out of his hand, and beats him. Sam manages to pull out the Fire Key and set the kitchen floor on fire. When Tyler loses his grip, Sam grabs his gun and aims it at Nina. Sam demands the Head Key and doesn't believe Tyler when he says he doesn't have it.

Bode tells Kinsey to say where she hid the Head Key, and Kinsey yells that Tyler doesn't have it. She claims she buried it in the woods because it was dangerous, and Sam should believe her because she doesn't want him to hurt her family. Sam says that he, Kinsey and Bode are going to go dig it up.

After Sam ties Tyler to a chair, Tyler and Nina beg to be taken instead of Bode and Kinsey, but Sam doesn't need Tyler or Nina and insists Bode go with him as ""collateral."" Nina threatens Sam if he hurts her children, and an impressed Sam says that's why he's taking them and not her. Before going, Kinsey tells Tyler that, if anything happens to her, he should take care of Sally.

As they go out into the forest, Kinsey asks Sam what's going to happen when Dodge opens the Black Door. He tells her to shut up, and Kinsey surmises that he doesn't know. Bode warns that Dodge lies to people, and Sam calls him the son of a liar.

-----

The Past.

Rendell asks Sam how the last few weeks have gone, and Sam says that they've been good and that he's been hanging out with Tyler. Before Sam can describe his home life, Rendell gets a phone call and leaves. Sam looks at a photo of Rendell with his family and hears (and sees) Dodge talking to him from the well house of the etching. She says that she's his friend, or wants to be, and tells Sam to look on the desk. He sees Rendell's file on him and Dodge tells him to open it. Inside is a report with Rendell wondering if Sam has a borderline personality disorder, with some observations provided by Tyler.

Dodge insists that Rendell and Tyler aren't Sam's real friends, and he's nothing more than a virus to them. She tells Sam that she would never lie to him because she knows how special he is. Sam yells that it isn't real, but Dodge says that she is real and knows how to get Sam what he wants. Once he listens to Dodge, Sam runs out. Rendell returns, sees Sam running and calls to him, but Sam keeps going.

-----

Now.

Kinsey leads Sam to the spot where she buried her fear. Sam tells Bode to sit and Kinsey to dig (using the shovel she once left there).

In Key House, Tyler knocks his chair over, breaking it and freeing himself. He cuts Nina free and goes to the study to get Sally while Nina, using Tyler's phone, calls 911.

Kinsey keeps digging, and Sam says that if there's no Head Key there he'll kill them both. She finds the discarded knife she used to kill her fear and picks it up, but Sam disarms her. Sam tells her that he now has to kill her, but Kinsey's fear digs itself out of its grave and attacks Sam. Kinsey grabs Bode and runs, while Sam tries to get his gun while defending himself.

Tyler finds Sally and removes the Head Key from it. Nina comes in to say the police will be there in five to ten minutes and wonders what the Key is that Tyler holds.

Sam grabs his gun and shoots Kinsey's Fear in its head. He shoots again, and Kinsey's Fear Monster runs off with a squeal.

Tyler and Nina hear the two gunshots and fear the worst.

Sam runs to Key House, passing Kinsey's and Bode's hiding place. He enters the kitchen and sees that Tyler and Nina have escaped. As Sam seeks Tyler, Nina stabs him in the shoulder. They fight and Sam gets the better of her and aims his gun at her, yelling that she made him do it and that he can't let Dodge down.

Tyler comes up behind Sam and inserts the Head Key into his neck. Sam's body goes rigid, and Tyler grabs the projected Sam that appears while Nina grabs Sam's gun. Projected Sam, being more forthright, says that Bode and Kinsey ran off while some creature attacked him, and he recognizes his front door that now stands next to him. Nina is shocked. Tyler tells her she's seen magic before but just can't remember it. Sam says that he screwed everything up and hugs Tyler, sobbing. He tells Tyler that he didn't want to kill Rendell but just find the keys for Dodge.

-----

Flashback: Back in Seattle, Tyler tells Sam, that after killing his own father, to kill Tyler's father while he's at it.

-----

Sam doesn't remember when Tyler joked to him about killing Rendell, and Tyler is relieved to know he isn't to blame. Tyler tells Sam that what he said doesn't matter, and Sam says that he thought Tyler was his friend but that Tyler and Rendell both lied to him. Shocked, Tyler admits that Rendell did tell him to be friends with Sam, but he really liked him and they were friends until he showed up at their house with a gun. Sam says Dodge said she cares about him, that Tyler doesn't understand, but Tyler says he understands why Sam followed Dodge's instructions.

Dodge drives up to Key House and enters.

Tyler explains that Sam's head is on the other side of the door, and stops Nina when she goes to the door to open it. With Tyler distracted, Sam takes the Head Key out of his body and, returning to his regular body, grabs the Head Key. Dodge enters and slams Tyler to the floor, punches Nina unconscious, and kicks the gun away. She thanks Sam for finding the Head Key. Tyler tells Sam that Dodge can only take the key if given to her willingly. Angry, Dodge says that it all could have been avoided if Rendell told Sam what she needed to know.

Sam asks Dodge if she really thinks he's special, and she says she does. He makes her promise that she's not lying, and Dodge asks if he thinks she's lying to him. She doesn't make the promise, and when Sam asks her again, Dodge stabs him with a letter opener and takes the Head Key, saying that while she can't take Keys from the Lockes, anyone else is fair game.

Nina recovers and leads Tyler out, and Dodge, collecting all the Keys, tells Sam that the reason no one loved him is because he isn't special at all. She leaves with the Keys, using the Anywhere Key, as Sam collapses to his knees.

Nina and Tyler emerge from the house as police arrive and tell the officers that Sam is within. With police closing in, Sam goes through the nearest door, and his spirit leaves his body because the Ghost Key is still in its lock. The officers arrive and close the door, unable to hear Ghost Sam when he begs them to stop. They then confirm that Sam's body has no vitals.

The officers, having found Kinsey and Bode, bring them to Key House. As the Lockes hug, Sam's spirit drifts above them, watching but unseen. After a moment, he disappears.

Later after the officers leave, Kinsey confirms for Nina that Bode and Tyler are upstairs but none of them are going to sleep. Nina hugs her daughter then Kinsey goes to her bedroom. Nina takes out the hidden bottle of Ellie's housewarming wine, pours herself a cup and, after a moment, consumes it in one gulp. She sighs with relief."

They hear someone move, and Rufus wonders how much longer ""he"" is going to stay there. Ellie assures him that it won't be much longer. He notes that his mother said THAT two week ago, and Ellie asks her son to hang in there and reminds him of the ""rule"" that they can't let anyone know he's there.

Lucas Caravaggio, ""he,"" comes in and asks about breakfast. Ellie tells him what they're doing, and Lucas asks if the kid who showed up was the same one who murdered Rendell. Ellie sends Rufus down to the cellar to see if they have another can of tomatoes, and then asks Lucas where he was the previous night and if he was involved with what happened at Key House. Lucas says that if anyone was involved, it was Ellie.

As Tyler and Kinsey clean up the kitchen, Tyler calls the situation messed up: Dodge got the Head Key. Kinsey mentions the Black Door in the sea caves. She explains how she and the Squad went down there, but doesn't know what's behind the Door. Kinsey figures that one of Rendell's friends has information about the Door in their head, and that's why Dodge wants the Head Key. Tyler asks to see the Black Door and Kinsey warns against it because of the tide, but her brother has already confirmed when low tide is.

Nina comes in, looks at all the food brought by the townspeople, and thanks Tyler and Kinsey for cleaning. She cheerfully goes to clean the study, and Kinsey and Tyler both note their mother's weird behavior.

Tyler and Kinsey go to the study where Nina vacuums the rug Sam collapsed on. When Tyler tries to help her roll it up, Nina does it on her own and then, supposing Tyler might be traumatized by last night's events in the room, assures him that he did what he had to with Sam because it was self-defense and that she's there for him if he ever wants to talk about it. Tyler asks if SHE wants to talk about what happened, but Nina insists she's okay and, smiling, tells her children they should feel whatever feels right to them, picks up her mug, points out having moved the old cabinet into the room, and declares she might make more changes in the room as well.

Tyler takes Kinsey to Nina's room and searches for her ""stash,"" sure that their mother is drinking again. He reminds Kinsey of how Nina acts when she drinks - happy and carefree, then weird and emotional, then shut down and bedridden - and says her breath reeks of Spearmint (which she uses to cover liquor breath) and just wants to find and throw out the booze. Kinsey, while looking at Nina's photo collection of Rendell's friends, points out that they've been lying to Nina and it might be their fault that she's drinking again. On a photo of Erin, Nina has a Post-it saying she's at McClellan Psychiatric Hospital.

Bode comes by and sees Tyler and Kinsey in Nina's room. He enters and asks what they're doing, and they claim they're helping Nina find her phone. Bode wonders what they're going to do about Dodge now that she has all the Keys, and Tyler tells his little brother to let them handle it. Kinsey takes Bode out to make him chocolate chip pancakes.

Nina greets Det. Matuku at the front door. He dropped by to check in on her, not officially but as a neighbor, and Nina invites him in. They sit in the main room and Nina offers him some of the food the neighbors gave them. Matuku notices her drinking from the mug and suggests that Nina could go anywhere. Why stay? Brother-in-law Duncan did offer his place in Boston, but Nina figures that they're better off at Key Horse and insists that her family is fine. She notices him eyeing her mug, and when Matuku offers to listen if she ever wants to talk, she quickly cuts him off. Understanding, Matuku tells her to take care and lets himself out.

Nina goes to her bedroom, takes out a hidden bottle of vodka, and pours some into her mug. She takes a drink and hides the bottle, then takes some more Spearmint and checks herself in the mirror to make sure she looks normal.

Back downstairs, Nina sees her reflection beckoning to her from the Mirror Keyed mirror, and vaguely remembers being trapped on the other side. She drops her mug in shock and kneels to pick up one of the shattered pieces. When she hears someone coming, she picks up the pieces and hides (and locks) them in the old cabinet. Tyler comes in, asks if everything's fine, and Nina says that she's just moving things around.

As Tyler washes dishes in the kitchen, Jackie texts him that she's outside. The doorbell suddenly rings and Kinsey goes to answer it, but Tyler follows her, saying it's Jackie.

Both Jackie and Gabe stand at the front door, together, and Gabe nervously says that they got there randomly at the same time... with both weirdly bringing chowder. They all go to the kitchen, where Nina comes in and greets the newcomers. Nina jokes about Jackie and Gabe being the possible reasons she rarely sees Tyler and Kinsey, then says she's thrilled with her children forming relationships. Laughing, Nina says that she's not talking about romantic relationships and over-enthusiastically says she believes in friendships.

The doorbell rings again and Nina, saying this is as close as it gets to attending their own funerals, goes to answer it. Kinsey takes Gabe up to her room, and Tyler suggests to Jackie that they go somewhere and talk.

Nina finds Ellie and Rufus at the front door with soup, and Rufus quickly goes to find Bode. Ellie offers Nina the soup and says that she felt sick. Nina apologizes for questioning Ellie at Joe's funeral and says that she was just angry with how things are. She invites Ellie in and Ellie accepts.

Tyler finds a quiet corner and apologizes to Jackie for bailing on the 5K. He admits he was a dick and shouldn't have left, and Jackie says he really hurt her, smiles, and says not to do it again.

Kinsey comes down and finds Ellie by herself. She asks if everything is okay with Ellie, and Ellie hesitantly says it is. Kinsey asks if she's been approached by anyone strange and describes Dodge. Relieved (that Kinsey isn't talking about Lucas), Ellie says she hasn't seen anyone like that. Nina comes back in and asks Ellie to take some of the townsfolk food (four casseroles). Kinsey excuses herself to return to Gabe, and Bode and Rufus come in. Bode talks about Rufus's model airplane and how he wants to go over and work on it with Rufus. Ellie reluctantly agrees and the two boys leave.

When Kinsey returns to her room, Gabe congratulates her on getting into one of the schools that she applied for. He notes her lack of excitement about it, and Kinsey wonders if she should be. Gabe admits that he wouldn't be thrilled if Kinsey left Matheson for the summer, and Kinsey says that he's the only one who is. She figures the other Squad members are still mad at her and she deserves it, and Gabe says they're just freaked out by Sam's visitation. Gabe wonders why Sam came there, and Kinsey tells him he came for the Keys. He assures her that her secret is safe with him, and Kinsey thanks him.

The doorbell rings, and Kinsey hugs Gabe. Nina announces that someone is at the door for her, and Kinsey goes down to find Scot there (checking his breath). Scot admits he was pissed at her but when Sam attacked it put everything else into perspective. Kinsey says she's glad Scot is there but looks nervously up the stairs; Scot gives her a container of ice cream as a gift. Gabe comes down, and Kinsey (gauging Scot at seeing Gabe as a new and unexpected rival) tells Scot that Gabe just came by to see how she was. Scot, seeing himself as a third wheel, quickly excuses himself to return to work, says he's glad Kinsey is okay, and leaves. Gabe says that he should probably go as well but tactfully waits for Scot to drive away first.

As Bode and Rufus work on Rufus' models, Bode complains that Tyler and Kinsey have been keeping secrets from him again to protect him. When Bode says that just because they're older doesn't mean they're right, Rufus asks him what he would do if his ""direct commander"" wanted him to keep ""sensitive intel"" on an enemy ""classified."" Would he under any circumstances disobey that order? Bode asks if Rufus has an enemy too or if he's talking about Bode's.

Before Rufus can answer, Lucas comes in and asks who Bode is. Rufus introduces Lucas as his cousin, and Bode, picking up on the sudden tension, asks Lucas where he's from. Lucas says he moves around a lot but likes it with Ellie, adding he's sorry about what happened with Sam. Bode tries to shy Lucas away by saying he and Rufus are really busy right now, when Ellie comes in with cookies and sees Lucas with the two boys. She reminds Lucas that he said he'd be out all afternoon; Lucas says he just got back. When Ellie offers ice cream, Bode and Rufus eagerly go downstairs and Ellie glares at Lucas for a moment before following them.

Nina finds a new mug to drink from, then unlocks the cabinet to retrieve the broken pieces of her favorite mug - and finds the mug whole and sitting on a shelf. As she stares at it, Kinsey comes in and realizes something is wrong. Nina explains what happened and calls it insane. She puts the torn up stuffed Sally in the cabinet, closes the door, then opens it to find the stuffed animal is whole. Nina also talks about the mirror and what she saw there, and tells Kinsey that she thinks she did step into that mirror once and got lost on the other side. She wonders if it's about the Keys Sam talked about, including the one in the cabinet door. Kinsey assures Nina that she doesn't think she's crazy, and goes to talk to Tyler.

Kinsey finds Tyler in his room listening to music and tells him about the cabinet and how Nina made it work. She says that Nina is remembering things from way back, including getting lost in the mirror.

Nina tests the cabinet with a book she tears up and, to her delight, figures she's not crazy. She goes up to the kids and hears Tyler suggest that things are different for Nina because she's drinking. Kinsey wonders what they're supposed to do, and a shocked Nina walks away without her children seeing her. Meanwhile, Kinsey figures that if Nina keeps drinking, they'll all be on the same page and can tell her the truth about everything. Tyler says they can't let her, and Kinsey figures that they lose Nina either way.

Tyler's alarm for low tide goes off, and he says they should go. He puts on Rendell's jacket as the caves will be cold, saying he left his at Javi's party.

Dodge visits the hospital, signs in, and Nurse Ruth tells her that Erin is with Gustave. Gustave performs competent magic for the patients, so Dodge joins the audience and watches for a bit. She then sits near Erin and shows her the Head Key, telling her to show where Rendell hid the Omega Key and no weird stuff.

Tyler and Kinsey visit the sea caves at low tide, where Kinsey finds a lighting stand the Squad left behind. She stares at it for a moment then admits she made reckless decisions because she was obsessed with following the whispers. Kinsey says that removing her fear didn't matter when it counted, and that she should have grabbed Sam's gun just like she should have grabbed the poker back in Seattle. Tyler assures her that she didn't do it either time because she was protecting Bode, and that she'll make it right with her friends eventually.

Tyler and Kinsey reach the Black Door, where Tyler finds a list of Rendell and his friends' names scratched onto a nearby rock. There's a title on it calling themselves the ""Keepers of the Keys,"" and Kinsey points out that there are only two of them still alive: Ellie and Erin. Tyler suggests that Erin is the woman Javi said came to Key House and went insane, and Kinsey figures Rendell may have told Erin, his girlfriend at the time, where the Omega Key is, information which Dodge plans to use the Head Key to extract. Kinsey suggests they go see Erin, and Tyler tells her to go while he stays with Nina.

Dodge wheels Erin to her room, notes Erin's photo of The Keepers of the Keys, and inserts the Head Key into Erin's neck. The door of Matheson Academy appears, but there's no sign of the other Erin. Dodge goes through the door and finds herself in a ruined academy representing the inside of Erin's head.

Kinsey drives to the hospital and runs inside.

Dodge finds a room filled with VHS tape containers. She opens one and views a memory of a young Rendell and Lucas sharing a toast to the Keepers. Dodge continues searching and soon finds a memory of Erin giving the Omega Key to Rendell. Young Rendell holds up the Omega Key, and Dodge smiles. Young Erin herself comes in and asks Dodge what she's doing there. Dodge figures that Erin is trapped in her own mind, and says that she knows where the Omega Key is hidden.

As Kinsey signs in, Ruth mentions that Erin has another visitor and describes Dodge.

Dodge exits through the mind door, leaving Young Erin behind pounding on the door and demanding to be let out. Dodge removes the Head Key and uses the Anywhere Key to leave just as Kinsey comes in the same door from the other side. Kinsey doesn't see Dodge. Dodge teleports to the Whedon house, finds Rufus' action figure on the kitchen table, and breaks it in two.

Kinsey tells Erin that she's Rendell daughter and, noticing the framed photograph, says that she has the bracelet Erin wears in the group photo of her friends. When Kinsey says they're worried someone will try to get in her head, Erin stares at her. Getting nowhere, Kinsey apologizes for bothering her, and Erin mutters the name ""Dodge."" When Kinsey points at the figures in the photo, Erin calls Lucas ""Dodge"" and Kinsey realizes what she means.

Dodge inserts the Identity Key into her own chin, transforming her appearance into Lucas.

Gleefully, Nina puts the urn with Rendell's ashes in the cabinet, then closes the door. She runs off to the bathroom and vomits then hears a door open and close. Nina looks out and sees a male figure wearing Rendell's jacket returning home. Assuming it's Rendell, she runs out only to discover that it's Tyler wearing Rendell's jacket. Nina stares at Tyler in shock, then glances over at the cabinet. She opens it, finds the urn inside, and, just as Kinsey enters, throws it on the floor where it breaks, scattering Rendell's ashes.

Tyler and Kinsey stare at Nina, and Tyler finally tells Nina that he'll clean up. Nina walks out, and Kinsey goes after her to Nina's bedroom. Nina says she's sorry, and Kinsey says she knows what she tried to do and would have done the same thing. When Nina wonders why it didn't work when it's magic, Kinsey says it IS magic and they tried to tell her before but she wouldn't remember. Nina says she thought she could bring Rendell back and it's her fault for not protecting them from Sam. Kinsey tells Nina she's not to blame for Sam and she doesn't have to fix them, adding that her mother can't go back to drinking, because they need her. Nina stares at her, and Kinsey lies next to her and hugs her.

Ellie finds Rufus' broken action figure on the kitchen floor. Lucas emerges from the shadows and happily says he saw Erin and Rendell hide the Omega Key inside Rendell's head.

Kinsey returns to Tyler and tells him what Erin said about Dodge. As she wonders if Lucas and Dodge are the same person, Tyler hears whispers and finds the Omega Key among Rendell's ashes."

Ellie gets her sports team off of the bus from an away meet when a text from a woman asks if she went to school with Rendell, accompanied by an article about his murder in Seattle. A photo of Sam shows the Omega symbol tattooed on his wrist. Ellie makes a call to Mark, saying that Rendell has been murdered and blaming herself. She wonders what they're going to do, and Mark says that he knows what he has to do. Mark then kills himself with the Matchstick Key.

Three Months Ago

Ellie and Rufus have dinner and talk about the Lockes moving into Key House. ""Lucas"" arrives at the door and Ellie stares at him in shock. He takes her hand and says that he needs her help.

The next day, Ellie lets herself into Key House and confirms that no one is there. She goes to Rendell's old basement room and searches till she finds a metal crown hidden above a heating duct. Nina and Bode return home. Ellie hears them and puts the crown in her bag, bumping into a chandelier as she puts everything back in place. Nina hears the noise from the basement and closes and locks the open door. Ellie knocks at the door and identifies herself. Nina lets her out, and Ellie claims she came just to get Rufus' action figure that he left behind.

When she returns to her home, Ellie gives Lucas the Crown but not the Shadow Key, which she didn't find. Lucas tells her she has to go back and get it or the Crown is useless. Ellie wonders why he wants it and where he keeps disappearing to. Hearing a camera taking a picture, they turn. Joe, at the door, has seen them and taken a picture on his cell phone. Joe walks away. Ellie will go talk to him, but Lucas says he has a better idea.

Joe returns home and calls Nina, leaving a voice mail saying he has something he needs to show her because he can't explain it. He finds Lucas and Ellie waiting for him inside. Ellie tells him to hand over his cell phone and they'll leave; Joe stares at Lucas in shock, stating that he died twenty-five years ago. Ellie begs for his phone and finally gets it, but Joe demands answers. Lucas says that he can't go because he recalls Joe as a talker. Despite Ellie's protests, Lucas smothers Joe with a plastic garbage bag.

Afterward, Lucas props Joe up at his desk to make his death look like a suicide. Ellie sees Nina pull up outside, and Lucas calmly leaves using the Anywhere Key, cruelly leaving Ellie behind on her own. Ellie hides as Nina comes in through the open front door. Nina phones Joe, and his phone rings in Ellie's hand. She quickly turns it off, but it's rung twice; Nina hears it and enters. She finds Joe's body and calls 911. In tears, Ellie leaves and runs home.

At home, Ellie takes a gun from a box in her bedroom then finds Lucas calmly reading a magazine. As he remarks about her taking so long, she shoots him until all cylinders are empty. He comes back to life, chuckles, then tells her she knows she can't kill an echo - he's already dead - and advances on her, saying he'll rip off Rufus' head if she doesn't help him. Lucas says she should be happy that they're together again - and so close to having everything that they need.

Present Day

Tyler looks at Duncan's memory of Rendell killing Lucas and asks Kinsey how it's possible that Lucas and Dodge are the same person. Kinsey only figures that Dodge will now come for the Omega Key, and Tyler assures her that it's hidden in the safest place in the house.

Bode comes in with the Matchstick Key, figuring Sam dropped it outside, and notices the memory jar. Kinsey and Tyler shove Bode out of the room, and he reminds them that they only know about the Keys because he shared the Keys with them. He tells them that they don't need to protect him and asks them to let him help - even Rendell had called him ""discerning for his age.""

Point taken, Tyler and Kinsey have Bode back in and show him the memory, where Bode, recognizing Lucas, says he's staying at the Whedon house as Rufus' cousin, and figures that Rufus is scared of Lucas. Tyler wonders why Dodge would use the Identity Key to make herself look like Lucas.

At the Whedon house, Lucas eats breakfast and confirms with Ellie that Rendell's body was cremated. Lucas figures that the Omega Key is in the ashes if it was in Rendell's head, and Ellie is shocked that Lucas is going to go digging around in Rendell's ashes. The demon calmly tells Ellie that she's the one that's going to do the digging.

Kinsey comes down to the foyer and finds Nina staring at the urn with Rendell's ashes. Now off the sauce, Nina says she's feeling more like herself but feels like something happened to Rendell's urn. Nope, claims Kinsey, nothing happened, and her mother apologizes for drinking. Her daughter assures her that she doesn't have to apologize anymore and says that they're moving forward. Tyler comes down and asks if Kinsey is ready to ride with him to the academy. Kinsey leaves with her brother and Nina turns back to smile at the urn.

Bode rides his bike to the Whedon house and tells Rufus that he's skipped school. Once he confirms that Ellie and Lucas aren't there, he informs Rufus that Lucas is their mutual enemy and explains how Lucas used to be Echo. Bode figures that Lucas is something bad and the reason Sam killed Rendell.

Rufus gets out the Crown and tells Bode that Lucas made Ellie steal it from Key House. He explains that there's a Key needed to use it but Ellie couldn't find it, and Bode vaguely remembers seeing the design of the keyhole on the Crown somewhere. Rufus refuses to let Bode touch the Crown, warning that Lucas could return at any time. He puts the Crown back and tells Bode he should leave, but Bode tells him that they're fellow soldiers and will fight Lucas together. Since Bode sometimes hears the Keys whisper, he'll find the Key and then use the Crown against Lucas/Dodge.

Eden looks out the window of her dorm room to find Kinsey's fear monster glaring back. When Jackie rushes in to check on her friend, the monster has slipped away.

Eden finds Kinsey at school and angrily accuses her of being pathetic, figuring that Kinsey and her ""Santorini"" Squad tried to frighten her. As Eden storms away, Kinsey spots Ellie exiting the building and follows after.

Outside, she tells Ellie that she knows about the Keys and Lucas, explaining that Bode saw Lucas when he was at the Whedon house. Ellie pronounces this encounter inappropriate and tries to walk away, but Kinsey insists she won't let Ellie lie to her anymore and asks why Ellie is helping Lucas. The older woman explains that she doesn't have a choice, insisting she's doing what she has to for her family, telling Kinsey she should do the same, then walks off.

Nina gets out her hidden bottle of Wheeler Sisters gin and pours the contents down the sink.

Eden has told Jackie and Logan that she's sure the frightening figure at her window was Kinsey, at least a 4:00AM after an all-night kegger version with bloodshot eyes and gross hair.

Kinsey tells Tyler that Ellie confirmed keeping Lucas in her home, and Tyler suggests that they should bring their friends into the secret since Dodge and his otherworldly shit is too powerful for the two of them. Backed by Jackie and Logan, Eden approaches angrily and pronounces Kinsey as not so scary without her makeup and claws. Kinsey realizes what scared Eden, and the fear monster itself appears and attacks Eden. Logan and Kinsey, backed by Tyler and Jackie, grab lacrosse poles and drive the monster off into the woods.

Ellie drives to Key House and peers through the window, spotting the urn, then returns home and starts to pack. Rufus asks what she's doing, and Ellie says that they're leaving town because it isn't safe: Lucas wants her to do something she won't do and the Locke kids are asking questions. Rufus tells her about Bode's visit and how he's going to find the Key to the Crown. Rufus insists that he broke his promise because he and Ellie need reinforcements. Ellie assures him that it's okay and hugs her son. Rufus shows her the Keys under a loose floorboard where Dodge stashes them and assures Ellie that he hasn't shown anyone else.

At the academy, Tyler has informed Jackie and Logan about the Keys, about Dodge, about Ellie's involvement, and about the Black Door. Logan dubiously asks Tyler for proof, and Tyler uses the Matchstick Key to set a book's pages on fire. Shocked, Logan's convinced, and Jackie goes to check on Eden.

Eden is with the school nurse, claiming a feral cat attacked her. Kinsey is there too, and as the nurse steps out for more gauze, Eden demands an explanation. When Kinsey won't explain, Eden says it was like a monster but insane. Kinsey explains that the monster is her fear that got outside of her head, attacking anything she's afraid of. She admits that Eden intimidates her, but owns that it's entirely her fault. Despite that, Eden is flattered.

Tyler catches up with Jackie and asks if she's okay. She's not. She says it's a lot to take in and tells Tyler that she needs a minute. She walks off. Kinsey sees her and figures Tyler told her. Kinsey reports that Eden took the news surprisingly well. Scot and Gabe approach, and Tyler quickly excuses himself. Kinsey reports that Eden is okay, then dispels the feral cat explanation by saying she used one of the Keys to take the fear out of her head. Everything was great for a while, then things got messed up and she didn't worry about the consequences of getting close to Gabe while she already had a thing going with Scot. She assures them that they're both amazing and doesn't want to choose one of them over the other. Considering this, Kinsey suggests she dates them both. Before Scot and Gabe can respond to this awkward idea, she gets a call from Ellie who asks to meet Kinsey at Key House after considering what Kinsey said earlier.

Nina drives to the church for the 6:00PM meeting of Friends of Bill W. and runs into Matuku outside. She says she considered going to the meeting but figured she wasn't in the right place, and Matuku invites her to have coffee with him instead. After a moment, Nina accepts.

That night at Key House, Ellie meets with the Locke kids and Rufus and tells them she was doing what she thought was best for her son. She says she's done being afraid of Lucas. ""Dodge"" was Ellie's nickname for Lucas when they were together in high school and he was on the fencing team. Now that name has a completely different meaning. Ellie explains that the night after graduation they had a sleepover in the basement. Rendell wanted to go down to the caves and check out the Black Door he had found.

Ellie explains that they found a way to remember the magic even when they became adults (but doesn't give details). Rendell opened the Black Door and things like glowing bullets shot out from the other side. One of them hit Lucas, and he and Rendell managed to close the door. Lucas said he was fine, and seemed fine, but... Ellie decides to use the Head Key to show them her memory of what happened.

Head Key Ellie takes Tyler and Kinsey into her head and leads them to memories of the basement. Ellie explains that the group returned from the sea caves and tried to get some sleep. Before them, young Lucas tells young Mark to give him the Omega Key, and the others wake up. When Lucas grabs Mark, the others attack him and Lucas kills Kimi (accidentally) and Jeff (deliberately). Before Lucas can kill Erin, Rendell knocks Lucas down and beats him to death. Young Duncan saw what happened, so they removed his memories and hid them in the tree. Ellie figures a demon from the other side attached itself to Lucas.

The surviving group members came up with a story of Lucas, Kimi and Jeff dying in the sea caves, since it was easier than explaining the truth. They claimed the bodies were washed out to sea, after tossing the bodies into the ocean themselves. The survivors then divvied up the Keys and made a pact to protect them and never use them again. Rendell took the Anywhere and Omega Keys, Erin the Head Key, and Mark the Matchstick Key while hiding the rest in Key House as he was the most trustworthy. Mark killed himself so no one could get inside his head and find where he hid the Keys. Ellie took the Identity Key and the Echo Key. The Echo Key can bring people back, but not the way she originally thought.

As Bode and Rufus watch over Ellie's body, Rufus suggests they set traps in case Lucas shows up. Bode figures they should use the Key ring, and gets it from a kitchen drawer. It has the same design on it as the Crown, and he realizes it's the Shadow Key.

Ellie tells Tyler and Kinsey that she couldn't let go of the memory of Lucas.

A Year Ago

Ellie goes to the well house and uses the Echo Key to resurrect Lucas. She missed him so much she had to bring him back. Lucas appears behind her and asks for any other Keys; Ellie gives him the Identity Key. Ellie knows Lucas can't leave the well house. He tells her to get the Anywhere Key from Rendell so that he can leave. When Lucas snaps at her to get it, Ellie stares at him in shock, whereby Lucas controls his anger and claims he's merely frustrated at wanting to get out and be with her.

Now

Ellie tells Kinsey and Tyler that the thing was an echo of Dodge, not Lucas, because Dodge was possessing Lucas when he died. She says that it's all her fault for breaking the pact. They leave Ellie's head and she removes the Head Key from her neck. As Rufus picks up the Head Key, Ellie explains that Dodge can use the Identity Key to transform into any form s/he thinks will be most useful. She says that the demon can be trapped in the well house but not killed, but the trick is getting it in there.

Bode tells them they have a way and shows them the key ring that is also the Key for the Crown of Shadows. Ellie explains that whoever wears the Crown can control powerful shadows that obey the wearer's commands... like force Dodge into the well house. Ellie and Rufus head for their house to fetch the Crown.

When Ellie and Rufus arrive at their home, Ellie gets the bag with the Crown. Lucas, waiting for them in the shadows, asks what Ellie has and knows someone's touched his hidden Keys. Ellie, unintentionally revealing it was Rufus, says that she took the Head Key and tried to find the Omega Key in the ashes, but it wasn't there. While Ellie claims that the Locke children must have found the Omega Key, Rufus picks up a screwdriver from his workbench.

Ellie claims that the children weren't home but she can try again tomorrow, and Lucas angrily tells her to stop lying. Rufus attacks Lucas, who easily knocks him down. Lucas grabs Ellie and finds the Shadow Key in her pocket, then releases her. She goes to Rufus. Lucas takes the Crown from the bag, attaches the Shadow Key to it, and puts the Crown on.

Matuku assures Nina that slips don't erase the progress that she had. The detective talks about his own recovery and how it's all about the next day. Nina says that Matheson was supposed to be a fresh start but admits it hasn't worked out as she hoped. She wonders if it's healthy for her family to live there.

Kinsey, Tyler and Bode wait for Ellie and Rufus to return with the Crown. Bode sees a robed Dodge approach. She dons the Crown and commands the shadows to throw the family car across the yard, proving to Tyler that the shadows are not just scare tactics. The Lockes head downstairs and barricade the front door, and Bode grabs his toy light saber. The shadows slip into Key House and Tyler and Bode decide to check the upstairs. Kinsey sees the shadows grab the urn with Rendell's ashes and calls her brothers back.

The shadows dump the ashes out, searching for the Omega Key. When Tyler advances to stop them, the shadow form of Dodge grabs him and slams him into the wall, lifting him up by his throat. Bode turns on the lights, dissipating the shadows, and they turn on all the lights before the shadows can attack again. More shadows search the darkened kitchen, which disappear when Tyler turns on the lights.

Finding tape on the floor, Bode tapes the Matchstick Key to the end of his light saber. He then steps out into the darkness and taunts the shadow monsters. As they move in on him, the power - and the lights - goes out. Kinsey grabs a flashlight and heads for the basement fuse box, leaving her brothers to distract Dodge.

Dodge demands the Omega Key, and Tyler and Bode hold the shadows at bay with the light saber and a flashlight. They run upstairs to get more flashlights while Kinsey descends to the basement. A shadow reaches through the stairs, grabs her leg, and trips her. She falls to the bottom, dropping her flashlight. As she crawls toward it, shadows grab and drag her into the darkness. Kinsey manages to light a match, driving enough of them away so she can reach her flashlight and dispel the rest.

Dodge's shadow confronts Bode in the hallway, which he stabs in the chest with his light saber and Matchstick Key. It bursts into flames and falls over the balcony as Tyler joins Bode, but they never hear a thump of the body landing.

Kinsey turns the fuses on and the lights come up. She comes upstairs and finds the unconscious form of Dodge in the foyer. Tyler and Bode arrive, and Kinsey confirms that the demon is still breathing, but the Crown is gone. Bode confirms the Omega Key is still safe in the cabinet, and Kinsey reminds them that Ellie said Dodge is unable to be killed. Kinsey suggests they send Dodge back through the Black Door. Tyler reluctantly agrees and tells Bode that he's not going, so Bode goes to check on Rufus while Kinsey takes the Omega Key from him.

Kinsey calls for help to carry Dodge to the sea caves, greeting Scot, Gabe, Jackie and Eden at the door. Gabe apologizes for the rest of the Savini Squad, still suffering PTSD from their previous cave experience, and Jackie apologizes to Tyler for freaking out earlier but assures him she's not scared and not going anywhere, which is one up on Tyler.

Scot interrupts their tender moment to suggest that they need to deal with Dodge. Kinsey leads them to the unconscious Dodge, and Scot figures that she looks appealingly human to lull them into a false sense of security. Eden takes a photo and Jackie tells her not to post it. The group wraps Dodge up in a canvas and hauls her out to the cave before the tide comes in. Scot chatters nervously from a sense of foreboding while Eden asks what they should do if Dodge wakes up. Tyler brought a knife. It can't kill a demon but may give them time to run. The group reaches the cliff and hesitates before gathering their courage and determination and proceeding.

Bode bicycles to the Whedon house and finds Rufus unconscious on the floor. When Rufus doesn't awaken, Bode calls out for help.

Entering the cave, Eden asks how they found it, and Kinsey explains they were going to shoot Scot's movie in it. Eden laughs and says she'd've quit the movie if she hadn't already. The group takes Dodge to the Black Door, where they hear a rumbling sound. They set the body down and approach the Black Door, where Kinsey says that opening it doesn't feel right to her. Tyler says it was her idea, but Kinsey asks if this feels right to them and that a best-available idea doesn't make it a good one. Tyler warns that the tide will come in soon, and Dodge stirs. Kinsey warns that the deed, once done, can't be taken back, but Tyler figures they can end it... for Rendell. Kinsey decides to agree and warns the others about the ""glowing bullets"" that Ellie described, and not to let any hit them.

Kinsey unlocks the Black Door and everyone helps pull it open. A glowing piece of rock shoots out and hits the opposite wall. Tyler and Kinsey drag Dodge to the Door. She awakens fully and grabs Tyler, asking what he thinks he's doing, screaming ""No!"" as they throw her in. Kinsey holds onto Tyler and Tyler breaks Dodge's grip. More glowing rocks shoot through, but the group manages to shut the door and lock it. It's done.

The group returns to Key House, and Gabe tells Kinsey and Tyler that they were awesome. Tyler goes to get some food, and the others go with him. Scot hangs back and tells Kinsey that he doesn't want to split his time with Kinsey between himself and Gabe. Kinsey says that she understands and they both agree that they can be friends.

As Nina and Matuku leave a restaurant, Matuku gets a call on police business. He excuses himself and they agree that they enjoyed getting together.

Matuku goes to the Whedon house and tells Bode that the EMTs are going to take Rufus to the hospital to check him out, but he's all right. Bode goes out to the ambulance and asks Rufus what happened, and Rufus describes Dodge. He gives Bode one of the Keys and salutes him, and Bode returns his salute and leaves.

When Bode returns to Key House, Tyler and Kinsey tell him that Dodge is gone for good. He asks if they're sure it was Dodge, and explains that Ellie wasn't at her house when he got there. Tyler and Kinsey begin to wonder, but Tyler insists that Dodge is gone for good and Kinsey agrees. They're safe now.

The next morning, Nina makes pancakes for her children. Duncan arrives and joins them for breakfast, and Nina wonders if they know what happened to the car. It doesn't work right. The children feign ignorance, and Nina says that no one has seen Ellie. Rufus' aunt and uncle are coming to take him in, and Nina tells everyone that she made a mistake moving them there. She wanted to learn more about Rendell's past, but it was a mistake and they're going back to Seattle. Nina did not expect silence as a response. Kinsey says they all like it in Matheson; Tyler and Bode agree. Duncan tells them they're the best thing to happen to Key House - at least since the 1890s. Nina needs to process this, and they assure her that she didn't make a mistake and hug her.

Later, Bode writes a letter to Rufus (heard in a voice-over), who now lives in Nebraska at his uncle's place. Bode figures something weird happened the night that Ellie disappeared and promises to figure it out.

Nina drives around with a pile of missing posters of Ellie.

Bode (still heard in voice-over) says that the Keys are part of their family and they need to protect them. (Tyler is seen getting ready for a new day while Kinsey is seen with four Keys kept in the Music Box - Ghost, Head, Omega and Matchstick - along with pieces of Dad's disassembled heirloom bracelet.) The Lockes are the new Keepers of the Keys. Bode also asks Rufus to mail him a photo of his uncle's front door so he, Rufus' fellow soldier, can visit if he gets the Anywhere Key.

At sunset, the Lockes go to the cliff and scatter Rendell's ashes over the ocean. Nina says that they're all home. They go back to Key House and Kinsey calls Gabe. Tyler is going fishing with Jackie on her parents' boat, and Gabe tells Kinsey - who won't be going to summer art school - that he'll meet her later.

As Gabe bicycles through Matheson, he flashbacks through a montage of past events.

Past

(1) Gabe arrives in costume for the Savini movie, and (2) he and Kinsey talk about the Black Door after escaping the Drowning Cave. He says that Kinsey has an energy that people all follow. After a moment, they kiss and then Gabe leaves. As he ascends steps, he uses the Identity Key to revert to ""his"" real appearance as Dodge. She then uses the Anywhere Key to meet Tyler at the party. (3) She goes hot and heavy with Tyler in her truck.

After activating the Crown of Shadows, Dodge uses the Identity Key to change from Lucas to Dodge, then uses the Identity Key to make Ellie look like her. Ellie stares at her new face in horror. Dodge punches her unconscious then drags Ellie to the Key House and leaves her on the floor of the foyer for the Locke children to find. The Lockes unwittingly throw the shape-changed Ellie through the Black Door, thinking it's Dodge. One of the glowing rocks comes through and strikes Eden in the arm, but only Gabe/Dodge sees it. He smiles.

Now

Gabe/Dodge rides through Matheson on his bicycle, smiling in triumph. He arrives at the restaurant (Fisherman's Catch) where he meets Eden eating several meals. The demon inside of her says that it's so hungry and continues eating. Gabe/Dodge smiles and joins her.

The camera pans back from an exterior shot of the restaurant. In the skies above Matheson, lightning streaked storm clouds gather."

Up in the penthouse, Rosco tries to connect with his teenage son, Parker Rosco, who behaves aloof but placating. Rosco becomes worried about something, and decides to leave immediately for London, calling an old friend to try and explain his concerns. Before he can, he steps through a projected illusion of his elevator, and falls down the shaft to his death. The scarred man downstairs removes his equipment, and leaves without a trace.

In London, teenage schoolboy Alex Rider and his best friend, filming enthusiast Tom Harris, discuss going to a big party that Alex's crush Aisha will be attending that evening. Later Tom brags about having the address to the event on his phone, but the teacher confiscates it for having it out during class. After school, Tom coerces Alex into using his skills to get the phone back so they can go to the party and meet Aisha and Alex gives in, using parkour to climb the building and reenter the school through the roof access. He makes it down to the classroom and successfully picks the lock on the desk drawer with a paperclip, but is caught escaping by the returning teachers. Alex is driven home by his uncle and guardian, Ian Rider, who chastises him for his rule-breaking, and forbids him from going anywhere for the weekend. Alex complains to the Riders' housekeeper and Alex's former nanny, American immigrant Jack Starbright, saying that his uncle is too strict and rigid. Jack reminds him of the adventures and exotic trips Ian has taken him on throughout his life, and suggests he cut him some slack. During dinner, Ian watches news coverage of Michael Rosco's death, saying that he was a client of the bank Ian works for. Alex recognizes Rosco's some Parker from a prank video he made the previous year, remarking he looks very different since Rosco sent his troublemaker son a to remote boarding school to straighten him out, which fascinates Ian. Later, Ian searches through Parker's social media and finds the name of the school: Point Blanc. Jack comes to see him and tells him she has passed her exams and gotten her university degree, after six years of part time classes while working for the Riders. They start to discuss the possibility that she might move on now that Alex is nearly grown, but Ian gets an urgent call.

Tom calls Alex on his laptop about the party, but Alex tells Tom that Ian has grounded him. Ian comes in and tells Alex he has to go to the office for the evening, and asks him if Point Blanc was the name of the school Parker Rosco was sent to. Alex is confused, but confirms the name sounds familiar, and Ian leaves. Alex takes advantage of his absence to sneak out of the house and go to the party. Ian picks up his partner, Martin Wilby, who informs Ian that he ran down the lead Ian gave him, and has arranged a rendezvous with an informant. They arrive at an empty industrial building, and Ian retrieves a gun from a secret compartment in his car. Alex meets Tom at the party, finding it packed with schoolmates. They mingle with their fellow teenagers, drink, and enjoy themselves, though Alex's attempts to connect with Aisha fall somewhat flat. Meanwhile at the warehouse, Ian and Wilby become suspicious of the strangely quiet meeting place, and are confronted by the scarred man who assassinated Rosco, Yassin Gregorovitch. Yassin and Ian seem to know eachother, and Yassin admits killing Rosco. Before Ian can act, Wilby turns his gun on him. Ian is shocked by Martin's betrayal, telling him he doesn't even know who he is working for, and won't live long enough to enjoy the money. Yassin apologizes to Ian for what he must do, and shoots him dead. The job complete, Yassin shoots Wilby in the arm and instructs him to call in the murder to his superiors. Alex returns home from the party to find a police car outside his house. The officer tells him and Jack that Ian was in a deadly car crash, and has been killed. A shocked Alex asks to see the body, but the officer tells him that Ian was driving over the speed limit, and his body is too damaged for viewing. Alex and Jack are left to grieve.

The next morning, Alex goes to Ian's study and finds a scribbled note on Ian's desk, 'Point Blanc'. Across town, a male and female agent and a group of forensic workers are at the scene of the murder, taking Ian's body away. The agents are joined by their leader, who is informed that Ian and Martin were attacked by an unknown assailant who left little to no trace. Martin is hurt, but alive. The leader goes to speak to Wilby, and asks the agents to talk to Alex. The female agent remarks sadly that first the boy's parents are killed, and now his uncle. They go to the Rider home, and introduce themselves as colleagues of Ian's from the 'bank'. The woman, Mrs. Jones, offers their condolences for Ian's passing. Alex tells them he was told his uncle was driving over the speed limit when he was killed, which Ian never did. The man, Crawley, says sometimes people make mistakes, but Alex insists Ian never did. Mrs. Jones gives Alex her number on a business card for the bank, and tells him to call if he needs anything. On their way out, Alex mentions Point Blanc, and asks what it means. Neither of them recognize the name, but they promise to look into it. Their leader, Alan Blunt, debriefs Wilby about the attack. Martin claims that Ian called him with a lead about a cyber-attack they've been investigating. Blunt doesn't understand how someone behind a cyber-attack could possibly get the drop on people like them, and throws the idea of the attack being connected to that case out. He asks Wilby if Ian mentioned anything else, but Wilby insists that was all Ian told him.

Tom comes to visit Alex, and finds him frustratedly hanging up with a hospital. Alex frantically tells Tom that he has called every hospital and mortuary in the city and no one has records of Ian's body ever being entered. He starts to wonder if the story behind Ian's death was completely fabricated, returning to the fact that Ian would never, ever drive over the speed limit. Tom thinks he is just in shock over his loss, but Alex is determined to find out the truth. Realizing that Tom's phone is still in Ian's car, he asks Tom if his phone tracker app is activated, and has him access it's location. Mrs. Jones goes to see Blunt, and shows him evidence collected from Michael Rosco's death, as well as from the death of a Russian billionaire who also had a troubled teenage son. Both men sent their children away to a school called Point Blanc. Jones credits Alex with unwittingly making the connection. Alex and Tom follow the GPS towards Tom's phone and make it to the industrial complex. Alex sneaks in and see Crawley overseeing a group of people cleaning up the scene and towing away Ian's car, ordering everyone to use a cover story if they are asked about the activity. Alex records this as evidence, but is confronted by an agent. Alex easily incapacitates the man, and he and Tom spot Crawley leaving the scene. Alex asks Tom to go home and cover for him while he bikes after the car. The vehicle drives downtown and into a building apparently under renovation. Alex is able to slip in through the gates right after the car, and finds himself in an underground parking garage. Crawley finds him following him, and brings him in for a talk. Alan Blunt observes Alex, who has been brought to an interview room and is being held for breaking in. Blunt remarks that Alex has shown incredible skill and intelligence in figuring out who they are, let alone finding them. He says he is exactly what they need. Blunt has Alex brought to them and shows him the truth about his uncle. Ian never worked at a bank, but was in fact a decorated war veteran, and an agent with the Department, a subdivision of the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. Blunt runs the operation, and Ian was one of their best field agents. He tells Alex that Ian was shot and killed while doing his job, and they never was a car crash, which Alex already knows. Blunt says that Alex is his uncles nephew, which is good, because they have a job they'd like him to do. Alex is furious that he has been lied to his whole life, and angry the Department let Ian get killed. He refuses Alan's offer, and storms out. Blunt tells him to call them if he changes his mind. Mrs. Jones expresses her disgust at the idea of using a juvenile as an agent, but Blunt tells her they have to adapt, or they will lose the fight.

The next day, Alex tells Jack that someone killed Ian, but doesn't get a chance to tell her what he found as the doorbell rings. Immigration Officers arrive at the Rider house and demand to see Jack's visa. They proclaim the document void and order her to accompany them for deportation back to the United States. A social worker arrives at the same time with more officers to take Alex away to foster care. Alex tells them all to wait and without even dialing, picks up the phone and tells whoever is listening that he will do the job. The officers and the social worker all get a call, and leave without a word. Jack is shocked and confused, and Alex leaves the house without explanation and gets into a waiting car with Alan Blunt."

Michael Rosco was one of two recent high-profile accidental deaths, the other being Russian gas and oil tycoon Gregoriy Serenkov, who's troublesome teenage son Stepan was also sent to Point Blanc. Ian was building a friendship with Serenkov before he died, as the Department thought he could be a useful asset. The connection to the deaths and the school is too big of a coincidence for them to ignore, but the Department cannot step in without cause for investigation, and the only ones who can get into Point Blanc are troubled ultra-rich teens. Mrs. Jones tells Alex his mission will be to blend in with the other students and simply observe and report any strange findings. Alex is resolved to help find whoever is responsible for his uncle's murder. The next day Alex prepares for school, but Jack wants an explanation for the dramatics of the previous day. Alex tells her it was just a misunderstanding and Mr. Blunt sorted it. Jack does not believe him, nor does she understand how a man from the bank could have such influence, but allows Alex to go to school with a promise to talk about it later. As he leaves, Alex is observed by someone in a parked car. He arrives at school and is met by Tom, who asks what happened when he followed the car. Alex tells him it was nothing, but Tom starts spouting his own theories. Alex tells him he got it wrong, it was just a crash, but he is approached by Aisha, who expresses her condolences and support. Tom agrees it was brave of Alex to come to school, and they separate for class, but Tom still does not believe Ian's death was accidental.

Crawley comes to see Mrs. Jones with the ballistics report from Ian's murder, showing a match to a Korean standard-issue pistol. Ian was in charge of helping a North Korean defector make it out safely, and theorizes they must have found out who was responsible and used a military gun to send a message. Jones wonders if perhaps the evidence is too perfect. Meanwhile, Alex is pulled from class to meet with a grief counselor, Geoffery Daniels, who is permitted to speak with him alone. As soon as the headmistress leaves, Daniels tells Alex he is actually from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and is aware of the truth behind his uncle's death. Alex is wary of the strange man, who provides identification to prove his credentials, and tells Alex that the Department is an outdated branch of operations, that Alan Blunt is an unscrupulous man that has turned the Department into an all but a private agency for his own purposes, and Daniels has been waiting for an opportunity to bring him down. He suspects Alex may be the key to Blunt's undoing, and asks Alex if the Department have asked him to work for them, a highly illegal and unethical action. Alex doesn't say anything, and they two are interrupted by Tom walking in on them. Daniels quietly warns Alex to be careful of anything Blunt asks him to do, and to watch out for others that might be interested in his activities. During lunch, Tom invites Alex to come around that evening and wind down with a movie marathon, which Alex agrees to. When Tom leaves, Alex calls the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and briefly reaches Daniels, confirming his identity.

Alan Blunt has returned from meeting with Sir David Friend, a British billionaire who runs a food and farming empire, and suggests to Mrs. Jones that the family would make a good cover story for Alex. They Friends have a daughter, but Alan has learned that she will be away while Alex would be there. Mrs. Jones is still disgusted at the thought of using a grieving teenager in dangerous field work, but Blunt orders her to be Alex's handler, and asks for continuous updates. Alex and Tom bike home from school, and go their separate ways after planning to meet up later. Before Alex reaches home, he is run into by a van, which stops as two masked and black uniformed men get out and drug him. Alex is abducted as the van speeds away. That night, Alex awakens, handcuffed and blindfolded, as the van arrives at its destination. He is dragged to an underground complex and brought to an interrogation room, and his blindfold removed. A man enters, Wolf, and tells Alex that there is no hope of anyone finding him, and tells him to answer one simple question in exchange for his freedom. He asks Alex what his uncle Ian's real job was. When Alex tells him he worked at a bank, Wolf warns him that lying will come with consequences.

At the Rider residence, Jack answers the phone to Tom, who is calling to see if Alex is doing okay, since he never showed up to movie night. Immediately worried, Jack hangs up and tries to call Alex's cell phone, but he does not pick up. In the compound, Wolf asks Alex a new question, and demands to know about Point Blanc. Alex tells him it just means a close range gunshot, but Wolf gives him a last warning not to make things worse by trying to deceive them. Alex is groggy from the drugs and from hitting his head on the van, so Wolf gives him some water. He asks again about Point Blanc. When Alex denies any knowledge, he is dragged away to a large empty room and chained to a chair. When the guards leave, bright lights are switched on, and extremely loud rock music is played from the speakers. Alex composes himself from the initial shock, and begins to sing while staring at the CCTV camera. In the monitor room, Wolf watches along with three other soldiers. His lieutenant, Snake, remarks on Alex's resilience, and Wolf reminds her that the boy is nothing but a subject. Meanwhile, Jack has tried over and over to get in touch with Alex, and has even called the Police in an attempt to report him missing, but the cops assume he is just a teenager staying out late, and refuse to take any action for the night. Jack calls Tom and demands the password to Alex's laptop. She finds a finished upload of the video Alex took at Ian's murder scene, and recognizes Crawley from his and Mrs. Jones' visit to the house, and finds the business card with Jones' phone number.

Back in the interrogation room, Wolf shows Alex he has files on both Jack and Tom, and threatens to make them give up the information Alex is hiding. Alex asks to see the file, and becomes distraught at the sight of his friend's photos. Wolf promises to send him home if he cooperates, and asks again about Point Blanc. Alex gives a glib answer and throws the file in Wolf's face, and is put back into the torture room with more loud music. Jack has called Mrs. Jones to the house, and tells her she knows that she and the others are spies. She has made copies of the video and the information and sent it to law firms across the world, and warns Mrs. Jones that if anything happens to her, they will blow their operation wide open. Impressed, Jones asks what Jack wants, and the housekeeper demands to know where Alex is, but Mrs. Jones does not know.

After Alex resists another round of ear-splitting music, it is finally turned off. Pipes in the ceiling are activated, and begin dousing him in freezing cold water. Wolf, Snake, and the others watch from the monitor room as he is forced the sit through the deluge. Snake speaks up against their treatment of the boy, despite Wolf's claims that they are only doing their job. She does not back down, and her concerns are shared by the other two members of their squad, Fox and Eagle. Snake asks Wolf to turn off the water, and Wolf allows it. However, as the water subsides, they see that Alex has escaped, using the paperclip from the file to pick open the cuffs. They sound the alarm and run out after him. They are unable to find him on the thermal cameras, as the cold water has lowered his body temperature. Alex just barely manages to hide as the squad begins a systematic search of the grounds, and slips past two of them in the darkness. He runs for it, but is lost in the compound. He finds what seems to be the road leading out, and spots a car approaching. He runs to it and yells for help, but to his surprise, Geoffery Daniels steps out. He tells Alex to get in to his car so he can take him to safety, but Alex doesn't understand what he's doing there and is extremely suspicious, refusing to go with him. Daniels pulls a gun on Alex as his captors find and surround him. Alex, having realized the truth of the situation, dares Daniels to shoot. When Daniels hesitates, Alex asks if he has passed the test. Mrs. Jones arrives and orders everyone to stand down. Daniels is actually a Department agent called Smithers, as are Wolf and the others. She aborts their mission, and Wolf tells her they need to talk. Jones orders him to put it in his report, and tells Alex to come back with her so she can take him home. Alex is angry, but goes with her.

Alan Blunt reviews the footage of Alex's questioning with Smithers and Crawley, who tells him Wolf reported that the boy seems to have been conditioned against interrogation and torture. They surmise that Ian must have taken the precaution, along with teaching him self defense and other physical skills. Mrs. Jones enters and demands to know why she was not informed about the operation, and Blunt tells her they had to be sure Alex was up for the task ahead of him. Jones tells him never to go behind her back with her agent again if he wants her to be his handler. Blunt tells the group that the operation at Point Blanc must stay a close secret between the four of them only. Jack cleans up Alex's cut, and tells him to walk away from whatever they are asking him to do for them. Alex tries to convince her that he won't be in any danger, but she doesn't trust the Department. Alex says he has to find out who was responsible for his uncle's murder, and bring them to justice no matter what. Jones meets with Wolf, who wants to know who Alex is and why they were asking about Point Blanc. Jones can't tell him anything, and Wolf tells her that Alex was genuinely scared during the interrogation, but was using it to hold back the information, a technique that suggests he's been training for something like this his entire life. Even so, Wolf can tell that he does not want to be a spy, and thinks she and Blunt are forcing him. Alex has no idea what he's being trained for, and Wolf warns Jones that if Alex dies during this mission, she is responsible.

Smithers shows Blunt and Crawley the security footage from Michael Rosco's death, just outside the elevator, showing him seemingly step right out into the empty lift shaft. However, Smithers has worked out what really happened, and demonstrates a life-like hologram technology. He tells them that only a few agencies in the world could be capable of setting up something so advanced. Meanwhile, Martin Wilby returns to his apartment to find Yassin waiting for him. Wilby tells him the Department have bought their evidence of a North Korean hit team, there has been no talk of Yassin or Point Blanc. Yassin is pleased with Wilby, and reminds him to get in contact immediately if anything changes. Across the city, Alex enters the Department Headquarters to begin briefing for his mission. Blunt congratulates the boy on his performance during the 'training exercise', but Alex is only interested in getting on with the mission, finding out out who killed Ian, and never seeing Blunt again. Mrs. Jones and Smithers fill Alex in on the details of his cover. He will pose as Alex Friend, the troubled son of Sir David and his wife, Lady Caroline. Their daughter is also a juvenile delinquent, so Alex should fit right in. They have created a cover story for why the Friends want him in Point Blanc, and to help sell the illusion, Alex will live with the billionaire couple at their estate for several days before being brought to the school. All the pieces are already in place, and Alex will begin his mission immediately.

At Point Blanc, high in the French Alps, the headmaster of the school, Dr. Greif, listens to his right hand woman, Eva Stellenbosch's concerns that they might be moving too quickly, and their activities may be noticed. Greif tells her they had always planned for one last student, and Alex Friend will be perfect for their plan."

Stellenbosch has just contacted Sir David about possibly bringing Alex into the school, but she has requested a meeting with the teenager first.

Alex goes to school, but the cut on his head worries Tom, who offers to find a way to get revenge on whoever beat him up. Alex tells him it was just some random troublemakers, and brushes him off on his way to class. After school, he returns home to find Mrs. Jones waiting for him. She checks on his progress with learning his cover identity, though Alex has thoroughly memorized every detail. The Department have also circulated a fake news story of the billionaire's heir pulling a dangerous prank at a private school, which has already gotten the attention of the administration at Point Blanc. Alex demands the Department return Tom's phone, since it has nothing to do with Ian's murder or their mission, and Mrs. Jones agrees. She addresses Alex's distrust of her and the Department, and possibly even of Ian, but tells him that despite all the lies, one thing that was clear was Ian's love for Alex. She tells him Ian really was their friend. Alex isn't convinced of her motivations for telling him this, but she simple says she is sorry for what happened to his uncle. She tells him the operation will be starting soon, gives him and Jack a credit card, and instructs them to make Alex look the part. Jack takes to the task with vigor, and soon Alex has a new haircut and clothes to help him sell his role. He goes to school, and his new look attracts the attention of several female students, including Aisha, who invites him and Tom to meet her and her friends for a movie. Tom is less impressed with Alex's transformation, but he and Alex readily accept Aisha's invitation. They walk home together, but on the way Alex is called in to the Department. He makes an excuse to leave Tom, who calls him out for lying to him for days, and asks to see the text. Alex says its private, and Tom assumes he plans to meet with Aisha alone. Alex insists its nothing like that, but can't tell Tom where he is going. Tom drops the matter and lets him leave, and Alex sadly parts ways with his friend.

At Department HQ, Alex is given a final briefing about Point Blanc and its few students. Smithers gives Alex a special device to take with him; an MP3 player that secretly functions as a communication device for texting messages to the Department. This way, he can keep them updated on his progress, as the school will likely confiscate the phone they are giving him. He is informed him that Stellenbosch will be coming to meet him soon, and he is being sent to the Friend mansion immediately to blend in for a couple days before she does. Alex is frustrated at having to blow off his friends yet again, but has no choice in the matter. He is brought to the Friend Estate in Surrey, and introduced to Sir David, and the overly sedated Lady Caroline. Sir David gives Mrs. Jones a message to bring to Alan Blunt, that after this service to the Department, they are even. Alex is shown to his room, as well as an entire private wing in the massive manorhouse, and is told that the Friend's daughter, Fiona, will be gone while he is there. Back at the Department, Martin Wilby is back at work. Crawley tells Blunt that he has conducted a thorough investigation, and Wilby''s story regarding Ian's murder checks out. Blunt is still skeptical that an outside force could have identified the ever-careful Ian and targeted him, and concludes that either Wilby is telling the truth, or he set Ian up. Crawley redoubles his efforts to investigate.

The Friends and Alex share an awkward dinner, and Lady Caroline shows concern over the young man's involvement in the Department's dealings. That night, Alex texts Tom with another excuse for missing the movie, and asks him to send Aisha his apologies, which only frustrates Tom further. The next morning, Sir David takes Alex to shoot clay pigeons, and teaches him how to shoot. He privately tells him that he cannot trust Alan Blunt, who will always see him as merely a tool for his use. Alex picks up the gun technique very quickly, and tells David that he is well aware for Blunt's machinations. That afternoon, the Friend's petulant and spoiled teenage daughter, Fiona, comes home early from her week away, having apparently had a nasty break up with her boyfriend. Sir David and Lady Caroline quickly speak with her about Alex. Fiona is annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with Alex because of Blunt's blackmailing Sir David, but reluctantly agrees. Tom storms into the Rider house to try and find Alex, who claimed he was ill. Finding him gone, Jack tries to tell him that he has gone away for a while with some friends, but won't tell Tom who. Tom knows she is lying, and angerly rants to Jack about Alex's behavior towards him, and him blowing off Aisha after so long trying to get her to notice him. He thinks that the same people who were involved in Ian's sudden death have gotten to Alex. Jack tells him she believes him.

Alex wanders the mansion, memorizing every room and detail. He comes across Fiona in the pool, who is impressed by his instant recognition of her. At dinner, She tells Alex all about the family's illegal activities, mockingly in the name of him bettering his cover by knowing their secrets. Later that evening, Alex is informed his pizza delivery has arrived. Confused, Alex goes to find Tom at the door in disguise, and they go to Alex's room to talk. Tom confronts Alex about all that has happened since Ian's murder, and Alex admits everything. Tom tells him that Jack is incredibly worried about him, and Alex tries to convince him that his mission is nothing nearly as dangerous as what Ian was doing, only looking around a school and coming back. Tom asks why they had to threaten him and Jack to force Alex's compliance if the mission would be so easy, and Alex has to admit how he got his previous injury. Tom tells him that the Department are not really on Alex's side, but he and Jack are, and makes Alex promise never to lie to them again. Alex agrees, and on the way out Tom tells him to be careful, and to come home quickly, reminding him that Aisha won't wait around forever. While biking out, Tom is nearly run over by several teenage boys on their way into the estate. The boys enter the estate and are greeted by Fiona, who happily reunites with her boyfriend, Rafe. Alex finds the group and Fiona introduces him as a 'charity case' the family has taken in for a few days. Rafe and his two friends are polite, but all four clearly look down on Alex. Nevertheless, they invite Alex to go walking with them in the morning. Alex is tense, but accepts.

Crawley tells Wilby to go home and rest, but Wilby refuses, wanting to continue investigating Ian's murder. Crawley tells him that the Department know who killed Ian, and since they cannot do anything to retaliate, they are dropping the case, to Wilby's shock. The next morning, Alex meets the Friends, as well as Rafe and his companions, for breakfast, and the other teens tell him they plan to go shooting while on their walk. Alex is nervous about the change of plans, but Rafe offers to lend Alex his father's antique shotgun, and they give him a location in the woods to meet them later. Alex goes to the woods and waits, but no one else shows up. Suddenly, bullets start to get fired at him, but Alex cannot see the shooter. He makes a run for it, narrowly avoiding getting shot as he takes cover behind the trees. He looks to see Rafe and his friends calling out and taunting him while reloading, with Fiona trailing behind. Alex buries himself in the underbrush and hides as the group walk over him, intent on hunting him down. Once they have passed by, Alex sneaks up behind and attacks and disarms Rafe, forcing the others to drop their guns. Fiona and Rafe try to claim it was only a prank, and they weren't really aiming for him, but Alex is livid at their callousness. He lowers the gun from them, but hurls Rafe's antique shotgun deep into the underbrush when he has the audacity to ask for it back, and heads back to the manor. He makes it back just ahead of Eva Stellenbosch, who has arrived for her meeting with Alex and his ""parents"". Mrs. Jones tells Alex to relax and focus, and sends him in to wait for Stellenbosch while she and other agents monitor him from another room. Sir David and Lady Caroline meet her at the door and thank her for her prompt response to their message, and take her in to see Alex. He plays the part of the extremely belligerent and spoiled son of the billionaire couple, the Friends convincingly portraying his concerned parents. Stellenbosch psychoanalyzes Alex, and the team is worried she may have seen through his cover, but Alex has successfully fooled her, and she concludes he is in dire need of rehabilitation at Point Blanc. Stellenbosch informs him and the Friends that he will have zero contact with them while he is at the academy, which requires total isolation in order to enact their radical teaching methods, and tells him they will leave immediately. From the monitoring room, Mrs. Jones and Smithers spot Fiona marching back to the house, furious, and making a beeline for the room where Alex and Stellenbosch are meeting. The Friend's housekeeper, secretly a Department asset, tranquilizes her and hides her out of sight just before she can reach Alex and blow his cover. Stellenbosch and Alex get into a car and are driven away. At home, Jack waits alone for any word of Alex's status, and Tom begins working on a video documentary of Alex's spywork. Far away in the French Alps, Alex and Stellenbosch arrive by helicopter at Point Blanc academy."

Nikki assures Jen that she's got it in the bag, and suggests that if the case doesn't go her way, she can ""hulk out"". Once Nikki leaves, Jen tells the camera that she's a Hulk, and figures she'd better tell the viewers about that.

A Few Months Ago

Jen and her cousin Bruce Banner are on a road trip. He shows Jen the device strapped to his arm that keeps him in human form, and she talks about her theory that Captain America is a virgin. A Sakaaraan courier craft appears in front of them, and the cousins' car goes out of control and off the road. Jen climbs out and goes around to Bruce's side, and manages to get the unconscious man out. Some of his blood falls into the gash on her arm, and she turns green and grows. She runs off into the woods while Bruce turns into the Hulk.

That night, Jen wakes up near a country bar. She goes in via the back, goes to the women's restroom, and tries to wash the blood off her clothes. Four women come in and help her, figuring a man beat her up. As she goes out and waits for Bruce after calling him, three men come out and hit on Jen. She turns into a ""She Hulk"" and snarls at them, and they fall back in terror.

Jen wakes up on a bed in a cottage on a beach. She makes her way to the basement and finds a bunker there, and ""Smart Hulk"" working in a lab. Smart Hulk says that they're in Mexico and he talked to her parents, and they know she's okay. He says that the cottage is where he went during the Blip, integrating himself and Hulk's identities. Smart Hulk explains that Tony Stark built the lab for him, and that they almost hit a Sakaaran courier craft that were apparently delivering a message to him. Jen asks what happened to her, and she remembers that he changed. Bruce says that his irradiated blood got into her body after the crash, and the two of them share a rare combination of genetic factors that let them synthesize gamma radiation. He used a sample of blood to fully heal his injured arm, letting him turn into Hulk, incinerates the sample of Jen's blood because it's too dangerous to get out into the world, and tells her that her condition isn't ""going away"".

Bruce warns that he can't make a cure for her, and Jen insists that she doesn't want to be a Hulk. She needs food, and Bruce makes her pancakes. He tells his cousin that she can't go back to her job because it's too stressful, and she can't be confronted with stress anymore. Bruce tells Jen that she'll have to stay there until she can control her alter ego, and it could take years.

In his lab, Bruce puts Jen in a sealed chamber and has to learn when stress will trigger her transformation. He activates a wall of spinning buzz saws that advance on Jen. She panics, turns into She Hulk, and shoves the wall back, breaking it, then breaks out of the chamber. Jen speaks in her normal voice and has her normal personality, much to Bruce's surprise. He's jealous that she doesn't have another personality to wrestle with, and tells her that she still can't be emotional and it will never stop that people see her as a monster. Jen agrees to let Bruce to teach her how to "" Hulk"".

Bruce takes Jen out of the veranda and teacher her yoga techniques to control her emotions. Jen isn't into it, and Bruce tells her to get some rest and they'll try in the morning. The next morning, Bruce sets off an airhorn in the sleeping Jen's ear, startling her awake. She turns into She Hulk and breaks the bed, and Bruce goes to work reinforcing all of her furniture. Bruce walks his cousin through exercises in being a Hulk, and Jen wonders when she's going to use any of it as a lawyer. He tells her that by being a Hulk she's putting a target on herself and all of her loved ones, and shows her the upsides of being a Hulk. They can get buzzed on alcohol but never get drunk, but Jen has to still deal with the hangover in the morning. She insists that she's not going to be a superhero, and is going to return to her career as a lawyer. Jen says that she deals with anger and stress all the time, because she's a woman.

Jen goes to Bruce's jeep, and Bruce goes after her and says that she's now a superhero and people like them have to protect the world. She doesn't want to be a superhero and chooses to help people as a lawyer, and drives off. Bruce stops her and says that he spent a lifetime denying who he really was, and Jen drives off and throws him off the hood of the jeep. When she knocks him into a pile of boulders, Jen stops the jeep and walks back to check on him. Bruce is fine and tells Jen that she has to learn to calm down. She loses her temper, Hulks out, and punches Bruce. They fight and smash the cottage, and Jen sheepishly apologizes. Bruce says that he'll respect it if she wants to back to her life as a lawyer, but Jen figures he doesn't mean it. Bruce helps Jen get her things into the jeep, and tells her that she can call him anytime.

The Present

Jen finishes her flashback and says that her family knows and Nikki knows, and there hasn't been any crazy stuff ever since. She goes to the courtroom and she gives her closing argument. The supervillainess Titania smashes in as Jen starts, and Nikki tells Jen to Hulk out and deal with Titania. Jen does so and they fight, and She Hulk knocks Titania out with one punch. Jen reverts back to her human form and prepares to give her closing argument.

The Past

That night, Jen and Nikki go to a bar where the patrons are all cheering about She-Hulk. Jen doesn't want to go in but Nikki insists, saying Jen should give them what they want. Jen goes in as She-Hulk and everyone cheers, Dennis comes over and complains that Jen debuted She-Hulk to drum up publicity for herself, and Nikki comes over and says that a guy gave her free drinks because Jen is a superhero. Jen insists that she isn't a superhero.

Her DA boss comes over and asks her to turn into Jen. Once Jen does, her boss tells her that the opposing counsel GLK&H had a mistrial declared because she transformed and saved the jury, potentially biasing them in her favor. He fires her because she's a liability for the DA's office.

Jen applies at other law firms, but none of them want to hire her because she's a potential liability. She eventually meets with Nikki, who helps her find jobs. A reminder of a family dinner comes up on her phone, and she goes to her parents' home and her father Morris assures her that he told the family so no one will bring it up. Her cousin Ched immediately brings it up, while her mother Elaine says that a young barista wants to talk to her about becoming a superhero. Morris asks Jen about Hawkeye's arrows, and then asks her for help before she goes.

Morris takes Jen to the garage and asks her how she's doing. Jen says that she's being okay about not being okay, and hated how her alter identity was revealed to the whole world. Morris tells her that they'll deal with it, and he says that she gets to keep moving on.

Jen goes to the bar to drink, and Holden Holloway from GLK&H approaches her. He offers her a job as head of a new division, and she immediately if she can bring in Nikki as a paralegal. Holden doesn't care and leaves.

On Monday, Jen arrives at GLK&H and Holden says that they started a Superhuman Law Division and he wants She-Hulk to be the face of it. He has her transform and then takes her around, and she's not happy they hired her because of her powers. Holden takes her to her new office, and leaves her to settle in. Nikki is already there, and She-Hulk tells Nikki that they only hired her because she has superpowers. Nikki doesn't care since they've got a corner office with windows, a minifridge, and a desk.

Augustus ""Pug"" Pugiliese comes in with a welcome basket and says that he's in the Superhuman Law Division as well, Later, She-Hulk meets with Holden and he tells her that her first case is the parole of Emil Blonsky, the former Abomination. Blonsky has been serving time in an ultra-high security prison, and there's a lot of publicity about his possible release. GLK&H is taking on the case pro bono for the publicity, and She-Hulk points out that Blonsky tried to kill Bruce so she has a conflict of interest. Blonsky has signed a conflict waiver and wants to retain Jen specifically as his attorney. When She-Hulk says that she'd rather take any other case, Holden tells her that if she doesn't take the case, she doesn't have a job at the firm. He says that at the least she should meet with Blonsky before she decides.

She-Hulk goes to the prison and the guard tells her that no super-powers are allowed inside. Jen transforms and is taken to Blonsky, and her escort has her sign a waiver that they can't guarantee her safety. The guards let her into the visitor area around Blonsky's cell. He's in his human form, and Jen sets off the alarms as she steps on the pressure plates around Blonsky's Plexiglas cell. Blonsky explains that he's transformed himself spiritually, and he chooses not to turn into Abomination anymore.

Blonsky admits that he tried to kill Hulk, but it was nothing personal and was under direct orders from the US Government. He says that the Super Serum the government gave him drove him berserk and that's why he went on his rampage in Harlem, Now Hulk is a hero and Blonsky is locked up. Jen tells Blonsky that he's going to need to show he feels remorse for his actions, and Blonsky says that he does, and he's written haikus to each of his victims. He insists he's speaking from the heart and wants to move on with his life, and Jen says that she'll think about helping him.

Holden leaves a message on Jen's phone saying that he wants her answer by the end of the day. Jen calls Bruce and tells him that she has a new job, but she has to take on Blonsky as a client. Bruce says that Blonsky wrote him a nice letter and a haiku, and they've put their grievances behind them and Bruce is sure he's okay with Jen defending Blonsky. He warns her that it's not easy going public, and laughs when she says the public named her ""She-Hulk"". Bruce assures her that she's got it but should be careful, and he's busy. Before he can finish, the Sklaar courier he's on takes off into warp.

Jen calls Holden and tells him that she's taking the case. She assures Holden that she has a winning strategy and the case is in the bag, and her new boss tells her to take a look at the news. The news is running footage of Abomination in an underground fight club in Macao.

Earlier after the family dinner, She-Hulk helps Morris and Ched around the house."

She points out that he didn't tell her about his escaping from prison and fighting in Macao. He says that he was forced to leave his cell but returned of his own free. Emil explains that the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong, broke him out.

Jen calls Nikki at her office, and tells Emil's story. Nikki says that she can track down Wong, and Jen complains that Wong may have ruined her case. She then informs the audience that the show isn't a cameo a week despite the cameos, and it's mostly about her.

The news and Internet are filled with reports about how She-Hulk is representing Abomination at his upcoming parole hearing. Nina is in Jen's office watching it, and Jen comes in. Her paralegal tells her that she has to respond to it, but Jen refuses. Jen is called to Holden's office, and the two of them go there and Nina warns Jen that the gossip won't go away once the case does. In Holden's office, Dennis is already there as is Pug and Dennis isn't happy Jen is there as well. He says that he has too much history with Jen to be comfortable on the case, and Mallory Book comes in and Holden tells Jen that Mallory is also in the Superhuman Law Division. When Dennis hits on her, she leaves in disgust.

Holden tells Jen that Dennis has been defrauded by an ex-girlfriend and wants their help filing a suit against her to get their money back. The girlfriend is a shapeshifting Light Elf from New Asgard, although Dennis thought he was dating Megan Thee Stallion. Wong teleports in, in response to Jen's message, and Holden lets Jen go to talk to Wong privately.

Back in Jen's office, Wong readily tells her that he extracted Emil from the prison against his wishes because Wong needed a worthy opponent as part of his training to become Sorcerer Supreme. He asks that Emil not be punished for his transactions, and Jen points out that the parole board will be the one punishing Emil. Wong refuses to erase everyone memories through magic, and she asks Wong to show up at the hearing and explain everything. Wong agrees.

Pug interviews Dennis about how much money he lost and confirms he spent $175,000 on her in gifts. Once Dennis confirms that Pug will take his case, he leaves. However, he then comes back in and tells Pug that he's going to drop the suit. Pug realizes that ""Dennis"" is the Light Elf, Ruun, shapeshifted into Dennis' form. She leaves before security can arrive.

Jen goes into the prison for the hearing past the reporters, and Emil's soulmates are there. The hearing comes to order and Jen says that they have a witness who will clear Emil of any wrongdoing. She says Emil will give his statement since Wong hasn't arrived, much to Emil's surprise. He says that he feels rehabilitated and when he rambles on, Jen interrupts and says Emil's not the man he was. She says that Emil's soulmates have pledged to support him. The prison staff testify about how Emil has redeemed himself at the prison, while Jen waits desperately for Wong to appear.

When one of the board members plays the video of Abomination in the fight ring, Jen says that there were extenuating circumstances. Wong teleports in and he starts testifies.

In Dennis' pre-trial hearing, Runn's lawyer moves for the dismissal of all charges on the grounds that Ruun is the daughter of a New Asgard diplomat and thus has diplomatic immunity. The judge rules that Ruun doesn't because they're not in New Asgard. The defense lawyer says that no rational human would have believed Ruun was Megan Thee Stallion, and it was just a relationship gone bad. The judge points out that Pug has to prove Dennis was truly fooled, but he lets them go to trial.

Ruun then shapeshifts into the judge's form, takes the bench after he leaves, and says that he's changing his ruling. Pug notices that Ruun is gone and calls her on it, and she changes back to her normal fun and runs out of the courtroom with a bailiff chasing her.

Wong says that it was Emil's choice to return to his cell. When one of the board members points out that Emil is Abomination, Emil turns into Abomination against Jen's wishes and demonstrates that he's in full control of himself. He then changes back to human and Jen says that the whole thing proves that Emil could break free if he wanted, but has chosen not to. The board adjourns to consider all that they've heard. When the board points out that Wong facilitated a crime, Wong quickly teleports away.

Jen rushes out past the reports, ignoring their questions. Shew goes to the bar with Nikki, and still tells her paralegal that she's not doing interviews. Pug joins them and wonders how they worked with Dennis, and Jen points out that Dennis almost terminally deluded. Getting an idea, the next day Peg has Jen testify under oath that she knows Dennis well and he shared his dating life with her. Jen says that Dennis is self-absorbed and chauvinistic, and would believe he could attract Megan Thee Stallion. The judge awards full damages to Dennis, and sentences Ruun to 60 days for impersonating a judge. Megan is the gallery, and says that there's only one Megan.

As Jen, Pug, and Dennis leaves, Dennis asks them if he thinks he has a shot with the real Megan. Pug tells him not to try and thanks Jen for her testimony. Jen gets an idea when Dennis wishes there was a way to take away Ruun's shapeshifting powers permanently.

The parole board reconvenes, and they grant Emil release on parole. Emil is prohibited from turning into Abomination indefinitely, and has to wear an inhibitor. Jen thanks them, and Emil thanks Jen. He gives her the same advice Nikki did about being part of the story by interviewing.

Later, Jen goes on a news show as She-Hulk and says that he didn't come up with the name. The interviewer focuses on her diet and exercise secrets.

That night, Jen returns home and two men dressed as wreckers attack her. She turns into She-Hulk and easily tosses them off of her, and two more wreckers join them, wielding Asgardian tools they stole from a construction site. She easily defeats them, and one of them tries to take a blood sample but the needle breaks on her skin. They run off and one of them, Thunderball, says that he couldn't get the sample for her blood.

Later, Jen returns to her office and signs Megan on as her newest client. Holden comes by and sees them twerking together."

Jen puts Madisynn on the stand, and she explains that she can't go into detail about how she escaped, or the demon who helped her would reap her soul and the soul of everyone she loves.

Donny's lawyer moves to dismiss, insisting magic can't be copyright. Jen says that the mystic arts is real magic, not stage illusions. Donny and his lawyers demonstrate stage magician, and Wong gets up to say a few words against Jen's advice. Wong talks about how Donny is seeking to wield the power of gods, putting the entire multiverse at risk,. The judge says that she'll review the evidence and have her decision in a few weeks. She also rules that Donny can practice his livelihood in the interim. Madilynn gets Wong to take her for froyo, spoiler 'Sopranos' as they go.

Later when she's at home, her cousin Ched barges in and tells her that he's making a killing selling Titania's She-Hulk products, and wants Jen to autograph them. Jen refuses, and his cousin tells him the line has nothing to do with her. She explains that Titania trademarked her name, and she didn't ""let her"" do it. Ched points out that if Jen had trademarked ""She-Hulk"" first, Titania wouldn't have been able to.

Later, Jen and Nikki go to one of Titania's store, so Jen can talk to Titania. Jen find Titania and tells her to stop, and Jen insists that the name is hers. Jen goes to her office with Nikki, and complains that Titania stole her name. Once Nikki goes back to her desk, Pug comes in and asks for a favor: that she'll stand in line waiting for a sneaker drop and help him get a second pair when they're limited to one per customer. Nikki agrees if Pug will put her in contact with his drop broker, so the broker Alonso can get clothing for Jen's size.

Pug agrees and later takes Nikki to the place Alonso says is a front for the business, a boba café. the clerk claims to have no idea what Pug is talking about, but Nikki assures him they're not cops and takes them to the back. The clerk has bootleg superhero stuff in the back, and tells them that the real tailor won't meet with them and he's very exclusive. He takes them to a security door, and they talk over the intercom to the tailor, who says that he'll do a 15-minute consultation with them.

She-Hulk meets with Holden in his office, and he finally asks about the Titania products he saw ads for. Jen assures him that isn't her, and points out now the firm is in the middle of a frivolous lawsuit. No one will hire the firm if it can't handle their own messes, and tells Jen that someone will handle it rather than her.

Jen meets with lawyer Mallory Book at the firm, who says that she's taking the case a professional courtesy but moving forward, they're not colleague. Mallory says that they need to show strength and countersue, and She-Hulk was using the name in a professional capacity before the trademark date, and Titania is profiting off of name recognition. She tells Jen to dress professionally if she's going to be Mallory's client, and calls in Nikki to help Jen with her loo. Nikki says that she has made Jen an appointment with the guy who makes clothing for superheroes. Jen figures she doesn't need it, and Mallory and Nikki tell her that she does.

Later, Jen and Mallory go to court for the preliminary with Titania. Titania's lawyer moves to dismiss the frivolous countersuit, and Mallory responds by saying that Titania didn't file trademark on the name until She-Hulk went public, and present evidence says that Titania is using the name to sell her sham products. She asks the court to grant a summary judgment. Titania insists that her products aren't sham, and her lawyer says that Jen wasn't interested in the name until it became associated with Titania's products. He runs tape of Jen telling the press that she won't answer to the name She-Hulk, and Mallory runs the tape of Jen telling a newscaster that someone else made up the name ""She-Hulk"" and it stuck. The lawyer tells Mallory that she needs to present more instances, and Mallory says that she can.

Once the judge recesses, Nikki takes She-Hulk to the tailor, Luke Jacobson. He's never heard of She-Hulk, and says that his client list is exclusive because his work is impeccable. Nikki says that She-Hulk is Hulk's cousin by blood, and is being considered to be an Avenger. When She-Hulk says that she's just a lawyer, Luke figures it's a waste of his time and talents to make a non-superhero suit. Nikki has Jen demonstrate how she can lose mass by turning into her human form, and then she turns into She-Hulk again. Inspired, Luke has an assistant order extra bolts of stretch wool.

Later, She-Hulk and Nikki go back to the firm. One of She-Hulk's dates, Todd, is with Mallory and recognizes She-Hulk, who recognizes him. He says that he's one of the firm's biggest clients, and Mallory is his lawyer. Todd suggests that they should reconnect and She-Hulk vaguely agrees, and Mallory takes Todd to her office.

Later, Jen and Nikki sit on a bench in front of the firm for lunch. Jen talks about her date with Todd, and Jen figures her dates show a clear pattern of her using the name. All she has to do is call all of her dates as witnesses.

Later in court, Mallory shows the judge Jen's dating profile and calls the four men Jen dated. She-Hulk slumps down as the men describe their dates, and Derek says that he wouldn't have gone on the date if Jen had presented as herself. The judge finds in Jen's favor, and has Titania recall all of her products. Afterward, Titania tells She-Hulk that it isn't over and leaves. Derek suggests to Titania that they link up later.

As She-Hulk and Mallory go, Mallory tells She-Hulk that she can do better. Jen takes Mallory to the bar and buys her a drink as thanks, and Mallory tells Jen that she doesn't know any other lawyer who would humiliate herself to win a case. They talk about what they have to put up with as women, and Jen says that she's glad they're friends. They're both taken aback by her statement, and Mallory thanks Jen for the drink and goes.

Nikki negotiates a division of the shares between the spouses, Immortal insists that he loved each of them, and they laugh. Mallory says that they're done and congratulates Nikki, and the spouses applaud Nikki.

A drunken Jen calls Bruce, and leaves a message on his answering machine to call her. Once she hangs up, Josh joins Jen and she says that she doesn't hate love. She just wants to come to one wedding and show that she's doing pretty good. Jen tells Josh that she's doing super and is She-Hulk. Josh says that he'd like to see her as She-Hulk, and Jen tells him that she can't transform there, and just wants to be amazing as Jen. Josh tells Jen that he thinks she's pretty great, and Jen goes out and throws up.

As Jen is throwing up in the flowers outside, Titania comes over and sucker-punches her. She tells Jen that she doesn't get over anything and shoves Jen around, and a drunken Jen says that she can take Titania as herself. She throws a punch at Titania, misses, and falls on the ground. Jen points out that Titania is obsessed with her. Titania insists that she isn't, and says that she's forced to prove she's worth the attention that Jen is getting, even though Jen doesn't want it. Jen agrees to turn into She-Hulk just the one time, tries, fails, and tells Titania to give her a second. She concentrates, turns into She-Hulk, and knocks Titania into the venue. She-Hulk goes in and she and Titania fight. Titania charges at She-Hulk and trips on ice, while the guests take photos on their phones. Furious, Titania takes back her gift and leaves.

She-Hulk tries to explain to Lulu that Titania sucker-punched her, but a drunken Lulu doesn't care and is thrilled that She-Hulk is at her wedding. Ched restarts the music and everyone dances.

That night at the firm, Mallory and Nikki drinks and watch the YouTube video of Immortal dying. Mallory says that she's married and has a son, and then finds a site dedicated to haters of She-Hulk. Mallory tells Nikki not to Jen, and not to give the trolls any attention.

Late, driving on her way home, Nikki calls Jen and leaves a message telling her all about the site.

Jen and Josh sit on the patio at the venue and eat French fries.

Chuck is going to go up to Emil's ranch, and since they don't have the budget for soldiers, he wants She-Hulk to meet him at the ranch.

Once they learn the tow truck won't be there until later that day, Emil figures Jen can spend some time there, and explains that he offers life-coaching. Jen tells Emil that she has to get some work done, and he tells her that she should enjoy the relaxation. He figures she's not in a teachable mood and walks away.

The retreat doesn't have wifi service, and Jen tries to find someplace that has it. She comes into a building where Emil is meeting with his clients: Man Bull, El Aguila, Porcupine, and Saracen. He invites Jen to join, but she passes because she managed to get one bar. Emil continues with his session, Emil suggests that Porcupine take off his porcupine suit and open up.

He explains how he activated his jet boots and they shot him into the sky, but then they cut off and Leap-Frog fell back down to the parking lot. The boots set his costume on fire, giving him third-degree burns on his legs, and he wants compensation from the tailor who designed the suit. She-Hulk agrees and Eugene says that the tailor is Luke Jacobson, a super-suit designer. She realizes Luke is her tailor, and goes to Holden and tells him about the potential conflict of interest, because Luke also designs her clothing. Holden points out that the Patilios are valuable clients and Eugene has signed a conflict waiver, and tells She-Hulk to get Luke to agree to a settlement so the case doesn't go to court.

She-Hulk goes to see Luke, who tells her that he's still working on the gala dress for the upcoming lawyer award. Luke insists that his suits are impeccable, and refuses to settle for any amount. He tells She-Hulk that She-Hulk will never get another suit from him, and rips her new dress in pieces. Furious, She-Hulk tells Luke that she'll see him in court and storms out.

Later in court, Luke tells the judge that he's not representing himself, and his lawyer Matt Murdoch comes in. He calls for the judge to reject She-Hulk's motion for Luke to produce his client list, and She-Hulk counter-argues. They argue back and forth, and the judge rules in Matt's favor. Eugene says that he used jet fuel in the boots, as Matt can tell with his heightened sense of smell, and Eugene did it against Luke's instructions, and then denies it, and everyone can tell he's lying. When the judge dismisses the suit, She-Hulk tries to apologize to Luke, who doesn't accept her apology.

That night, Jen goes to the bar. Matt is there and buys her an appletini, then joins her. Matt explains that Luke made him a couple of new suits and Matt owed him. He claims that he had a ""hunch"" that Eugene used jet fuel, and explains that he usually does pro bono work but occasionally takes on a rich client when the bills pile up. Matt says that Jen as a lawyer can use the law to help people, and become She-Hulk when it fails. He steps aside to take a call, and Todd texts Jen to ask to see her about a legal issue. Matt comes back and says that something has come up at work so he has to go, they both say it was nice meeting each other, and he leaves.

Todd persists in texting Jen to meeting, threatening to go to Holden. She-Hulk finally meets with him and Todd tries to impress She-Hulk with the Wakandan war spear he bought at auction for a million dollars. She isn't impressed. When Todd tries to hit on She-Hulk, she storms off.

Jen goes home and collapses on the couch, and gets a call from Eugene saying he's driving to his secret lair and someone is ramming his car. She says that she'll meet him, then puts on her new She-Hulk costume and goes to the parking garage where Eugene is. As she drops in front of the car, Daredevil drops off the car that he was attacking and tells She-Hulk to back off. She-Hulk refuses to waste her new costume and tells Eugene to drive off. As he does so, Daredevil tries to get by She-Hulk, using his acrobatic agility to avoid her blows. He drops down in front of Eugene as the latter drives out of the garage, and She-Hulk drops in front of Daredevil. She-Hulk manages to stun Daredevil, grabs him, and pulls off his mask to discover that he's Matt. Matt puts his mask back on and explains that he's really blind, and has a special method to ""see"". Jen reverts to her human form, and Matt explains that Eugene abducted Luke and is holding him hostage, and she insists on going with Daredevil to save Luke.

The two of them drive to the warehouse that Eugene is using as his ""secret"" lair, the ""Lily Pad"". Eugene is having Luke design a new improved costume for him, and Jen and Daredevil sneak up to the window to check out Eugene and his goons. Daredevil locates all the goons by hearing their heartbeats, and tells Jen to stay there while he picks them off one by one. They argue about whether to use stealth or super-strength, and Daredevil finally tells her to follow his lead.

Inside, Daredevil takes out the first group of goons. When the reinforcements arrive, She-Hulk drops in through the roof and takes them out. She-Hulk smashes into the main room and the rest of the goons arrive. Eugene suits up while Jen frees Luke, tell him to go and call the police, and tells Eugene to stoop before he racks up more legal charges. Daredevil takes out the goons and argues legal points with She-Hulk, and Leap-Frog leaps out a window. He lands on a car below and breaks his leg.

Later, the police and paramedics arrive, and the latter take Eugene away on a stretcher. Luke tells She-Hulk that they're even and he'll make her dress. Daredevil is on the roof, and Jen joins him and thanks him for his help. He thanks her for her help, and they argue over who was the lead superhero. He offers to take out to dinner the next time he's in town, and Jen suggests that they skip all that. They go to Jen's apartment, kissing, and end up in bed.

The next morning, Daredevil walks back to his hotel. Jen is wondering if the episode is over, when Nikki comes in with her own dress for the gala. She works out that Jen had sex with Daredevil, and Jen wonders if they're doing the gala in this episode when the next episode is the finale.

That night, She-Hulk and Nikki go to the gala. Jen's parents are inside, and She-Hulk realizes that Todd is there. The Walters, Nikki, and Pug go to their table, and the presenter gives the Lawyer of the Year award to She-Hulk, Mallory, and several other lawyers. Intelligencia starts playing Josh's photos of Jen after sex on the screens in the back, and Intelligencia says that she's a slut. She-Hulk goes berserk and pounds the screens. Alarms go off and everyone runs, and She-Hulk sees Intelligencia in the back taking video of her rampage. They run out when She-Hulk comes for them, and She-Hulk bursts through the outer wall and grabs them. Armed DODC soldiers arrive and tell her to stand down, and she puts up her hands and surrenders."

Outside the DODC prison, Jen's parents greet her, Jen goes to her office and is fired, and Nikki and Pug help her box her things. She goes home and finds reporters camped outside her house. Jen has dinner with her parents, and her father says that she's welcome to move in with them if she can't get a job. She's eventually forced to move back in, and goes to her old room.

Later, Nikki comes to see Jen, who is trying to locate Intelligencia. Nikki has also been trying to track them down, and tells Jen that their server security is airtight. She figures that one of them will eventually slip up, and then Jen plans to sue them for defamation and invasion of privacy. Dennis gives an interview that is less than flattering about Jen. Jen complains to herself about how it feels like she's getting screwed over. The narrator cuts in, but Jen cuts him off, saying they're not doing narration. Jen tries to contact her cousin, but Bruce doesn't respond. She figures Emil would understand and texts him to ask if she can stay with him at his retreat. When Jen gets no response, she goes anyway.

At her office, Nikki manages to get an invitation to an Intelligencia meeting from HulkKing.

Jen drives to the retreat and Wrecker greets her. He sets her up with a guest room.

Pug and Nikki drive to the Intelligencia meeting place, and Nikki sends Pug in. He reluctantly goes in and blends with the other all-male members, and Todd is there and recognizes Pug. Todd accepts Pug as one of them and hugs him, and then complains that Jen didn't earn her powers. Nikki talks Pug through acting convincing, over his earbud, and Todd says that he is HulkKing. The signal gets cut off due to bad reception. Todd calls the meeting to order, and says that they're just getting started.

Jen goes to the compound's kitchen to get a snack, and runs into Wrecker. Wrecker says that Emil is at the lodge holding a private event, and Jen goes there.

Todd introduces the special guest speaker: Emil as Abomination. Jen comes in and Emil turns back to his human form when she calls his name. Nikki comes in and Pug joins her, and he tells Jen that everyone is Intelligencia and Todd is HulkKing. Todd tells Jen that he hired Josh to seduce her and steal her blood, and his team has synthesized her blood to give him the powers she never should have. He injects himself with the serum and becomes Bio Hulk. Titania bursts in, and then Hulk, while Jen complains to the camera about how messy the season has become. He fights Abomination, while Jen complains that none of the storylines makes any sense.

Jen breaks the inhibitor, transforms, and breaks out through the Disney+ menu, and enters the Marvel: Assembled show. She finds herself in the TV studio, and finds the She-Hulk production office. She complains to the writers about the stupid season finale, and they tell her that they thought it would be a cool twist. They say that it's the story that Kevin wants, and She-Hulk says that she wants to talk to Kevin. The writers tell her that no one talks to Kevin, and She-Hulk goes to talk to Kevin.

The receptionist has She-Hulk sign the NDA and calls the guard. She fights past him and the other guards, and finds a room filled with screen showing Marvel shows. A robot, KEVIN, drops down from the ceiling and greets She-Hulk. It explains that its name stands for ""Knowledge Enhanced Visual Interconnectivity Nexus, and tells her to transform back to Jen before it answers her question, and she should transform once the camera is off her because the visual effects team has moved on to another project.

Once Jen transforms back to her human form, KEVIN tells her that it makes the decisions, and it possesses the most advanced entertainment algorithm in the world. It tells her that it's not her show, and Jen asks for her closing argument. KEVIN grants her request, and Jen says that they shouldn't go for a big spectacle but focus on her travails. She convinced KEVIN to get rid of the Todd-gets-powers storyline, have Hulk reveal where he was in one of the movies, hold Emil accountable, have the climax in daytime, and bring back Daredevil.

KEVIN agrees, but tells Jen she'll never be able to enter real-life again. Jen makes an off-screen transformation and returns to the show, turns back to her human form, and says that she'll see him in court. The police take Todd arrive, and Daredevil arrives to help. Jen tells him that he missed it. Emil goes back to prison for ten years, and she goes home with Matt and has an outdoor meal with him and her family. Matt tells everyone that he's only in LA for a week.

Later, She-Hulk goes to court, telling a reporter that she's going to hold people responsible for their actions, as Jen and as She-Hulk.

The end credits show Emil going to a chicken house, KEVIN reading a She-Hulk comic, and Todd being hauled away in court as She-Hulk looks on.

Morning at the station, and a fae prostitute calls Dombey into the fae holding cell to show him Vignette's hanging body. When Dombey gets close enough, the ""dead"" Vignette kicks him, runs out past the other constable, and tries to flee the station as the other fae cheer her. The constables grab Vignette and Dombey beats her with his nightstick, and then they throw her back in the cell. When she yells for Philo, Dombey tells her that Philo is dead.

At the abandoned manor, Absalom sits, drinks, and holds a gun. Philo asks what he's waiting for, and Absalom says that he wants to look him in the eyes and sees a sign of his true nature. He finally accuses Philo of killing Querelle, slapping him, and puts his gun to Philo's head and dares him to say Querelle's name. Philo tells him to put the gun down, and insists that he didn't kill the singer. Absalom pulls the trigger but the gun jams. When Absalom pounds on it, it goes off, the bullet hitting the ceiling.

Philo tells Absalom that he didn't know Querelle was his mother, and says that he thought Absalom murdered her until now. After freeing Philo, Absalom says that he met Querelle when she was a singer and he was a young student. Querelle sent the elites flirting with her away, and eventually Absalom brought her to the manor: his family's summer house. Absalom's father discovered their secret and threatened to kill Querelle unless Absalom called it off. Querelle asked to see Absalom one last time, but he never went. He realizes that it was about Philo, and admits that he was a coward. Philo tells him about his relationship with Vignette.

Agreus is reading the paper and Fergus asks if Imogen found her way home. The human servant asks if Agreus will be sending her again, and Agreus tells him that it's no concern of his. The fae asks Fergus if he disapproves of his behavior, and flies into a sudden rage demanding an answer. Fergus warns that someone could find out, and Agreus asks if he can rely on his discretion. The servant says that people are already talking and it's dangerous what Agreus is doing.

Imogen is going up to her room and Ezra passes her on the stairs, greeting her. He tells her that something came up and he knocked on her door but got no response. Imogen claims that she was there and fell asleep, and her brother says that the Swan is ready with a shipment of tobacco. She suggests that they invite Agreus to dinner when Ezra comes back so that they can celebrate as friends, and then corrects herself to say ""business partners"". Ezra tells Imogen says that people will make unflattering assumptions if she continues on her current course. Imogen irritably says that she doesn't care, and Ezra tells her that she talks as if Agreus has become a friend to her. She denies it, and Ezra asks what he is to her. Imogen says that he's a Puck and goes to her room.

As they go Absalom tells Philo that he'll have Vignette released but warns that Philo can't return to the Burgue because he's the next target. He advises Philo to stay dead while he settles the ugliness, and tells his illegitimate son to turn his chances to Vignette before it's too late. Absalom says that he wishes he knew Philo better and wishes him godspeed, and Philo leaves in Absalom's carriage.

Piety calls Jonah into the dining room and tells him that she knows he was with Sophie. She advises her son to stay away from Sophie, warning that she's twice as dangerous as anything on the Row. Piety reminds Jonah that Ritter kidnapped him, and Jonah tells her not to take him for a fool. She slaps her son and he walks away, and Piety hastily apologizes, saying that it was for his own good and it always has been. Jonah demands that she show him the big picture, and Piety finally says that Sophie is his sister.

In her shop, Aioffe cuts open an animal and studies its entrails. She realizes that the scene is like her earlier version and mixes a substance in a beaker. The darkasher comes in behind her, and Aioffe drinks the substance and turns to face the creature, saying that she knows who its controller is. The creature guts her.

Tourmaline passes the hat among her brothel workers to raise money for the imprisoned fae. Philo comes in and tells Tourmaline that he's there for Vignette. He says that Vignette is being released.

Absalom tells Winetrout to contact the magister of police on an urgent matter. He goes to his office and a Puck, his back to Absalom, pours tea. Absalom assumes that he's his servant Crick and says that big changes are coming to the city. As the man signs an order for Vignette's release, Quill serves him his tea and Absalom realizes who he is. The Puck stabs Absalom repeatedly in the stomach and after a brief struggle, Absalom falls to the floor. Quill runs out, yelling ""Death to the tyrants"", and the guards soon subdue him. Winetrout goes to Absalom and confirms that he's still alive.

Jonah visits Sophie at her home in broad daylight, and tells her that they can't keep meeting. She figures that Piety told him about her affair with Ritter. She says that their relationship didn't give her pause, and she grew up alone with no family apart from her bitter father. Then she felt a shred of a connection with Jonah, and saw no reason for pause. Jonah tells her that the world has boundaries, and Sophie insists that they don't belong to the world but it belongs to them. She tells him that's how power is born, says that he could be a force to be reckoned with, and gives him a note. When Jonah asks what it is, Sophie says that it's an offer to be considered. Jenila comes in and announces that a message has come summoning Jonah to Balefire. Jonah takes Sophie's note and goes.

Winetrout tells Piety that Quill is being questioned at the keep. Jonah arrives and says that he needs to see Absalom, and Piety tells him that he needs to rest. Her son insists on seeing Absalom, and Piety tells him not to upset the wounded man. Absalom tells Jonah that they say he's likely to survive, and Jonah says that Absalom never considered him a true successor. He points out that he carries Absalom and little else, and says that Piety told him the truth. Jonah figures that Absalom suspected, and his father admits that he did. Absalom says that Jonah is his son, but Jonah says that he doesn't care about the prophecy, bids him goodbye and leaves.

As night falls, Philo explains his heritage to Tourmaline. She asks him to take care of Vignette, and Philo says that he will. Tourmaline assures Philo that Vignette needs him the way that he needs her, and shows him the drawer containing the copy of Kingdoms of the Moon that Philo gave Vignette. Vignette kept it despite Tourmaline advising her to burn it, and Tourmaline knew that Vignette still loved Philo.

Imogen paces nervously and then goes to Agreus' home via the servants' entrance. Agreus opens the door and finally invites her in. She says that she thought they might have sex, and Agreus plays ignorant. He asks if Ezra will wonder where she is, and then tells Imogen that she shouldn't be there. Agreus says that he expects her to pretend it never happened, and Imogen asks if he can forget so easily. She demands the truth, and Agreus says she is a poor lover. Imogen figures that he's lying and Agreus admits that' he's obsessed with her. He says that he's can't forget what happened between them, and Imogen asks if he wants to. Agreus tells her that he can't risk it, and Imogen asks why he bothers with the charade of pretending to be a human if there's a part of the life that he can't have. Agreus accuses her and all humans of being entitled, and she says that they take what they want. The Puck slams her against the wall and asks her what she wants, and Imogen tells him that he knows what she wants. The two of them kiss and start undressing.

Outside, Ezra watches through the window. After a moment he turns and goes back to his house, gets his gun, and breaks into Argeus' house. He finds Imogen's discarded boot on the stairs, goes up, and follows the trail of his sister's clothing to the bedroom. Agreus and Imogen are sleeping in the bed, and Ezra throws Imogen's dress at her and tells her to put it on and go home, aiming his gun at Agreus. Ezra orders Agreus out of the bed, and when Imogen tries to stop her brother, he yells at her to stay away. He tells Agreus to face the wall, and Imogen knocks the gun out of his hand. Ezra grabs her by the hair and calls her a whore, consorting with an animal. Agreus knocks Ezra to the floor, and Ezra laughs and says that now Agreus has done it and everything he has will be taken from him.

Imogen grabs the gun and aims it at Ezra, and tells Agreus that he has to go because the police won't see it as self-defense. Ezra tells her that she can't leave, but Imogen leads Agreus out and locks the door behind them. Her brother yells that he'll find them wherever they go.

Vignette returns and Philo figures that something isn't right. Word arrives that Aioffe is dead, and Philo and Tourmaline go to the shop. They find the disemboweled fae laid out on a table, and Philo figures that she was killed because she knew or saw something. He realizes Aioffe's liver is still there, and Aioffe gasps in breath. She says that she's been waiting for Philo.

Winetrout tells Absalom that the magistrate is still on his way. Piety arrives in response to Absalom's summons, and he tells her that he spoke to Jonah earlier and he helped her solve a riddle he's been mulling over.

Aioffe says that she's suspended in the gloaming between day and night, life and death, and can see everything.

Absalom tells Piety that he always doubted that Jonah was his son and destined for greatness. Then Piety discovered a secret that he didn't know: he had her, and Aioffe world.

Philo asks who killed her, and Aioffe says that she should have seen it because ""she"" always took interest in her work.

Absalom figures that Piety never knew if the future promised her son belonged to another.

Aioffe says that Piety was always a curious child, and Philo finds a photo of Piety with Aioffe.

Piety asks where Philo is, and Absalom insists that he's no threat to them as a half-blood. His wife insists that she can't take the chance Philo will take Jonah's destiny, and demands to know where Philo is. He insists that the prophecy isn't real, and Piety smothers him with a pillow, yelling at him to tell her where her other son is. As Absalom dies, Piety says that he'll tell her one way or another.

Aioffe warns that Piety's rage makes her powerful.

Piety cuts open Absalom's chest and takes out his liver, then cuts it open to learn his secrets.

Aioffe warns Philo that Piety knows his weakness: his love for Vignette.

Piety takes the release order from Absalom's robe pocket and learns Vignette's name.

Dombey soon brings the release order to Vignette and tells her that she has friends in high places. They sent a coach to pick her up.

Aioffe tells Philo that time is running out and he should go. Philo and Tourmaline leave as the substance wears off and Aioffe dies. They go to Balefire and Philo breaks down a sewer gate, and tells Tourmaline that he'll find Vignette.

Jonah contemplates Sophie's note. The guards find Absalom dead and Jonah goes to see his father. They realize that Piety was the last person to see Absalom alive, and now she's gone. Jonah orders them to find her, and the magistrate acknowledges that he's the new Chancellor and begins the search. Winetrout tells Jonah that he's the Chancellor until the next election.

Piety straps Vignette to a chair and prepares to her cut her open. Piety says that she doesn't want to do it but she will if Vignette forces her to. She asks where Philo is and then he'll never need to know.

Philo makes his way through the sewers to Balefire and finds the darkasher standing in the darkness. He has a hatchet in hand and prepares to fight it.

Vignette realizes that Piety controls the darkasher, and says that she doesn't know where Philo is. She admits that she wouldn't tell Piety if she did know, and Piety prepares to disembowel her.

The immobile darkasher doesn't respond to Philo as he passes, unconscious when Piety doesn't control it. Philo bumps into a pipe and the noise alerts Piety through the darkasher's senses. Piety realizes that Philo is coming for Vignette and tells her.

The darkasher follows Philo, and Philo runs. He cuts the holding mechanism on a portcullis, dropping it on the darkasher as it passes beneath. Philo then decapitates it, severing its link with Piety. She goes to face Philo, and Vignette tries to reach the knife Piety left behind.

Philo continues through the sewers and enters Piety's ""workshop"" where she assembled the darkasher. Piety comes in and says that Vignette is fine, and explains that it's always been about Philo. She says that Quirelle sent her a blackmail note, and Piety couldn't take any chances after all she's sacrificed. Piety tells Philo that the time has come to finish it, and the darkasher arrives and throws Philo across the room. It puts its head back on its neck, and throws Philo across the chamber again.

Vignette manages to touch the knife.

Piety sends the darkasher after Philo as he tries to grab a bottle of acid. She has it lift Philo up, but Vignette arrives and stabs Piety through the skull, killing her. The darkasher, bonded to her, dies as well. Vignette flies down to Philo and holds him.

The next morning, Jonah tells his staff to put emergency measures in place. He summons Runyon and explains that the note from Querelle was found among Piety's things. Runyon says that he knew Querelle a long time ago, and Jonah has him read the blackmail letter out loud. He says that he was Querelle's dear friend and she wouldn't write such a letter. Jonah tells him that he's no longer in need of a tutor but he is need of an honest man. He offers Runyon a drink and a position as special advisor to the Chancellor. Jonah says that he will need a steadying influence in the hard days to come. When Runyon wonders what he means, Jonah says that Quill was part of a radical fae organization, and things are going to get worse before they get better.

Vignette goes to the train station with Tourmaline and says that she's going somewhere where the presence of fae won't attract attention. Tourmaline tells Vignette that she's her friend and all she wants is for Vignette to be happy. Vignette glances over at the waiting Philo and wishes Tourmaline happiness and they hug. She then goes to Philo and the two get on the train. Soldiers are ushering fae off the train, and a guard refuses to let Vignette board. He explains that Absalom was assassinated by fae cultists and all of the fae are to be segregated to the Row.

The Swan's captain tells Agreus that they're being signaled back into port. Agreus tells the captain to ignore the signals and they can chase them if they like. Imogen arrives and Agreus asks her where they should go. Imogen says that they should go somewhere new and far away, and tells the captain to surprise them.

As he prepares for his first speech as Chancellor, Jonah looks at the letter and notices that the handwriting is the same as on the note Sophie gave him. Sophie comes in and tells Sophie that he's considering her offer of marriage. He points out that her handwriting on the two notes matches, and Sophie readily admits it. Jonah realizes that she's responsible for everything, and Sophie says that Ritter has been collecting information on for Absalom for some time. Ritter refused to make use of the information because of his residual feelings for Piety. She asks if Jonah has wept over Absalom's death. When he doesn't respond, Sophie says that chaos creates opportunity for them. Winetrout announces that Parliament is ready for them, and Sophie tells Jonah that it's time for him to decide if they're to be friends or enemies.

Jonah and Sophie go into Parliament, and Jonah gives his speech. He tells them that the Burgue is under siege from threats within and without. He vows that they will win the war.

The city guards go through the Row, putting up warning signs and barbed wire. Cabal and his cultists watch, as do the prostitutes.

Jonah vows that they won't negotiate or compromise.

Afissa is herded into the Row with the other fae.

Ezra stands on the dock, looking out at the departing Swan.

Imogen stands on the deck of the Swan, looking back at the Burgue.

Jonah says that they cannot be divided or weak, and now they have a common enemy and they must stand as one. He asks Sophie if she will stand with her, and Sophie agrees, speaking for the opposition. Everyone applauds, and Jonah takes Sophie's hand when she offers it.

As the guards take Vignette to the Row, Philo goes after her. She tells him not to make trouble and she'll find a way out. Fleury tries to fly out, and a guard shoots her down. Vignette goes to Fleury, and Philo tells the head guard that he's fae and goes into the Row. Vignette, crying, runs to him and they hug.

Sophie tells Parliament that a new day is coming to the city, and they can never go back."

During his walk he bumps into two other pedestrians and changes his appearance each time, matching to the persons whom he bumped into. The three young people follow their target in a club called ""Pandemonium"" and one of them (a blonde man) is startled when a young redhead woman is able to see him.

Flashback to eight hours earlier when the same young redhead woman shows her portfolio to three persons in the ""Brookly Academy of Arts"". She introduces herself as ""Clary Fray"". While her regular work is rejected as ""Decorative"", she is admitted based on the quality of the drawings on the cover of her portfolio book. Clary now meets with her best friend Simon and it is revealed to be her 18th birthday. A friend named ""Maureen"" is mentioned.

The scene cuts to an African-American policeman investigating the death of a woman, naked except for a red drape, who has been drained of blood. Another person mentions this is the 7th of such deaths. The investigation is interrupted by a phone call from a woman named ""Jocelyn"", and it is implied that the policeman and Clary are familiar.

Clary walks into an antiques shop where a woman named ""Dot"" is laying out Tarot cards; one of the cards features a single cup. Dot is an employee for Clary's mother. Clary walks up and meets her mother whose picture we saw on the phone labeled ""Jocelyn"". Jocelyn's present looks like a small wand and one such wand was featured in the intro and used by one of the three young people. The wand is named ""Stellae"" by Jocelyn. Jocelyn also mentions an important conversation she and Clary need to have, but is rebuffed by Clary.

A flashback shows a ten-year old scene where young Clary is attacked by a water-borne monster; Jocelyn uses the Stellae to activate a rune and defeat the monster and then takes Clary to a man called Magnus (a warlock) to have her memory wiped.

Jocelyn and the policeman (whose name is Luke) discuss signs indicating that Clary's memory might be returning. Simon picks up Clary to visit a concert he will be giving.

That night (and therefore the same night as in the intro) Maureen, Simon and Clary discuss Clary's (lack of) family. As Clary claims her mother would be inable to hide anything from her, the scene cuts to Jocelyn fetching a large sword from an old chest in her house.

The next scene takes place in an old church as the same three young people featured in the intro prepare to fight ""demons"". They refer to the murder victims as ""Mundanes"" and being killed by demons. The inside of the old church is a high-tech facility featuring many computer screens but also runes. One one of the screens the elderly East-Asian man from the intro is shown, with the remark that's how he looks ""for now"". The three young people are named Jace, Alec and Isabelle.

Simon and Maureen perform as ""Champagne Enema"" in a small café/living-room like setting to about 30 people. Afterwards Clary draws the new band name ""Rock Solid Panda"" on the side of Simon's van, accompanied by a rune she can't explain. The part of the intro scene where Jace bumps into clary is now partially repeated. Jace says Clary ""has the sight"", which is interpreted by Clary as a cheap pickup-line. Meanwhile we see the scene from Simon's point of view, who sees Clary talk to nothing.

The demon (now in the guise of a purple-clad young woman) enters the Pandemonium club, followed by Jace, Alec and Isabelle. She hands a vial of red liquid to a man-in-a-suit wearing sunglasses, mentioning: ""more Mundane blood for your boss."" As Clary, Simon and Maureen enter the club the owner walks up to the man in the suit and tells them ""Circle"" members aren't welcome. He magically hurts one of them and tells them to leave.

Jace accuses the demon-woman of peddling Mundane blood and wants to know for who she's scoring. He threatens her with his sword but is seen (and interrupted) by Clary. In a fighting scene the purple-clad demon-woman and the other demons in the VIP-room of the Pandemonium are killed, including one (by accident) by Clary. Clary walks out in a panic and hails a cab, watched by a surprised Simon & Maureen.

At home, Clary tells Jocelyn in a panic what happened in the Pandemonium. To Clary's surprise, Jocelyn is mainly interested in the tattoos Jace was wearing and reveals using her stellae that she has the same. Clary panics some more and Jocelyn wants to explain, but Dot enters and tells Jocelyn ""they"" have found her. Jocelyn briefly explains she hid something from a very powerful person, that Luke is to be trusted. She now gives a pendant to Clary and a green liquid to Dot telling her to use it only when needed.

Outside, the same Circle member who was thrown out of the Pandemonium instructs his companions to find the Mortal Cup. Dot opens a portal and Jocelyn tells her that Luke can protect her. Clary is pushed through the portal and arrives in the police station (at 2 AM). The captain walks by and tells Clary luke is in an interview.

The Circle members enters Jocelyns house. One of them starts collecting random cups from the antiques shop; another throws Dot through the windows some 5 meters down, where she hits a fence and then the floor. Jocely burns Clary's room in order to hide Clary from the Circle. She then draws her sword (which is of the same type as the Circle members' swords) and a fight starts. The Circle member emphasizes them wanting the Mortal Cup ""for him"". ""Him"" is revealed to be called Valentine, whose continued existence surprises Jocelyn. Jocelyn and Valentine used to be on Sthe same side, but not anymore. Jocelyn then imbibes the green fluid and falls to the ground immediately.

The interview LUke is having turns out to be with two Circle members. Luke states that he doesn't care for either Jocelyn (whose last name he says is ""Fairchild"") nor Clary, but only for the Cup. Nevertheless, he is not working for the Circle. Clary overhears the conversation and runs off in the now pouring rain.

The next scene takes place in Chernobyl where a middle-aged man walks past a number of cages containing growling beings while carrying a syringe and needle. The three Circle members who assaulted Jocely teleport in and carry an unconscious Jocelyn with them in a stasis-like field. When one of the three Circle members disrespects Jocelyn, the middle-aged man injects him angrily ; he seemingly dies of whatever was injected.

Clary enter her house and finds it in disarray; she screams and cries. Wielding a battle-axe she searches and meets Dot, who tells her that ""rogue Shadowhunters searching for the Cup"" took her mother. When Clary says she doesn't understand, Dot asks her whether her mother never mentioned a large cup, almost a chalice, made of gold. Dot is then revealed to be also a demon and Clary is cornered by Dot in her true form, until Dot is suddenly stabbed in the back by Jace. Clary faints from the demon venom she received during the fight.

Clary has a nightmare about Valentine examining or hurting Jocelyn and suddenly wakes up, bumping Isabelle in the head. Alec and Jace enter the scene and argue about whether Clary is also a Mundane. Isabelle take Alec with her and discuss Clary; Alec is upset about Clary accidentally ruining their mission (finding out who wants the Mundane blood).

Jace now tells Clary (and the audience) the trio are ""Shadowhunters"", who protect humans from Demons. Warlocks are mentioned. Clary says she is not interested in anything except finding her mother.

Now Simon calls and says she's been missing for two days; he is outside of the old church where she is according to ""find my friend"". Clary asks ""five minutes to get dressed"", which surprises Simon, since the church is supposed to be abandoned. While getting dressed, Clary notices a large tattoo in her neck which Jace admits to having drawn because it is a healing rune (and lethal to Mundane humans). When he accuses her of knowing about runes because she drew some, he then discovers she doesn't (even though she drew some).

Clary walks outside in a skimpy outfit borrowed from Isabelle and Simon lends her his jacket. As he wants to take her to her home, Clary suspects no longer having one. A demon appears who names her ""Clary Fairchild"" and draws a sword on her, but is beaten and slain by Jace (who dedicates the kill to his father, who was apparently killed by a demon). The scene takes place unseen to Simon due to ""Glamour"" runes which make the Shadowhunters invisible. The dead demon seemingly apparates on the floor, now visible to Simon. Jace now reveals to Clary that she is a Shadowhunter too.

Back in Chernobyl, Valentine is mad at the remaining members of the Circle hunting party for not having found the Mortal Cup. Valentine is then informed about the existence of Jocelyn's daughter, to whom he desperately wants to speak."

While Simon wants to take Clary away, Jace insists on taking her into the abandoned church / Shadowhunters HQ. In the end all three of them enter and Jace casts a rune to reveal HQ to Simon.

Jace and Alec tell about the Circle revolt against the Shadowhunters, leading to the death of Jace's father amongst others. Jace then takes Clary to the training room while Simon is entertained by Isabelle.

A dark-skinned female Circle member walks in a parking garage, intent on attacking a Warlock. Luke intercepts and threatens to kill the woman. The camera then shifts away; a struggle and growling are heard.

Jace introduces Clary to Hodge Starkweather, former Circle member. Hodge knew Jocelyn (Clary's mother) from the Circle. He is cursed with a rune that tortures him every time he reveals a Circle secret. Hodge also tells about Valentine's plan which would kill many humans. According to Hodge Valentine Morgenstern has died in a fire, and the Mortal Cup can be used to create more Shadowhunters. Hodge states the mission to be to ""Stop Valentine.""

Jace and Clary conclude that her memory has been wiped by a Warlock, a being described as ""half-human, half-demon"" and identifiable by a sparkling glow between their fingers (like Dot had, for example).

Dot meets Luke in Clary's house and discusses the current whereabouts of Jocelyn and Clary. Dot mentions involving Magnus Bane, the warlock.

Isabelle and Simon discuss Runes and Isabelle mentions ""Forsaken"": humans who were given Runes and who did not die, but went crazy.

The captain mentions Clary's presence at the police station a few days earlier to Luke and he discusses the possible overhearing of him talking to Circle members with a co-worker.

Simon tries to persuade Clary to leave the Shadowhunter HQ, but Clary refuses. A little later she clutches her pendant and receives a vision that indicates Dot is at the Pandemonium club. The camera switches to Pandemonium (which is owned by Magnus Bane). Many warlocks are using a portal to get to safety while Dot tries to convince Magnus to help her. Magnus refuses and takes the portal. Outside Dot is captured by Circle members. Clary watches the capture in vision.

Jace mentions the ""Silent Brothers"", shadow-hunters who can restore memories. After some discussion the group (Jace, Alec, Isabelle, Clary and Simon) drive in Simon's van to the ""City of Bones"", a subterranean mausoleum for Shadowhuntrers.

Dot has been taken to Valentine Morgensterns headquarters in Chernobyl and locked in a cage. Valentines offers Dot her freedom in exchange for Dot reversing the sleep spell applied to Jocelyn and, when she refuses, injects her.

Jace tells Clary the Silent Brothers can use the Soulsword to carve the truth from someones mind. They then enter the City of Bones.

In the police station the captain shows Luke a picture of the demon killed by Jace outside Shadowhunters HQ and identifies him as one of the two ""witnesses"" who spoke with Luke a few days before at 2AM. The other ""witness"" (the dark-skinned woman who battled Luke in the parking garage) has been mauled and deep scratches are visible in a car bonnet. Luke then explains to his coworker that he acted in self-defense, implying he mauled the woman and created the scratches.

In the City of Bones Clary is shown an angelic being holding a cup and a sword; the Shadowhunters crest reads ""Nephilim Facilis Descensus Averni"" (for Shadowhunters, the descent into hell is easy). After a seemingly short walk in the City of Bones they arrive at a rune which stands for clairvoyance. The six Silent Brothers (whose eyes and mouths have been sown shut) arrive and communicate telepathically to Jace and Clary. They warn her of the Soulsword but Clary goes ahead anyway.

Back near the van, Isabelle and Simon talk and Isabelle offers to listen to some of Simons music. She hears a noise and leaves to investigate, instructing Simon not to leave the van. While listening to some of his music Simon is grabbed by a pair of hands from behind.

The Soulsword only grants Clary one fragment of her memory: a flashback in which Luke and Jocelyn discuss that Valentine Morgenstern is Clary's father.

In Chernobyl Dot uses her magic to break the locks on her hands and her cage. She talks to the sleeping Jocelyn and is then attacked by a Circle member. Dot injects the Circle member with a syringe she grabs from a table; the circle member is then killed by Valentine. He then moves to kill Dot.

Jace and Clary report to Alec. They then discover the disappearance of Simon. They then see Simon hanging upside-down; he has been kidnapped by vampires who want to exchange him for the Mortal Cup. According to Alec, attacking the vampires would violate the Accord. The vampires then disappear."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4807334/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Jace trains Clary so that she can join the rescue mission to free Simon from the Vampire Clan.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Andy Wolk'],"['', '', '']",[],['mission'],[],"The start of this episode takes place a little while after the end of the previous episode.

The Shadowhunters and Clary discuss their options. It is clear that both the Circle and the Vampires want the powerful artifact ""the Mortal Cup"" for their ends; both have captured a loved one of Clary as leverage. In the end the Shadowhunters decide to consult ""the Clave"".

Simon is shown as a captive of the Vampires.

Back in the Institute, the Shadowhunters and Clary are discussing the Vampires. Isabelle knows their location: the ""Hotel Dumort"" in New York. Clary would like to go there right away, but Alec insists on needing a Clave resolution: The Shadowhunters are ""not a slave to their instincts"" like ""the Seelies"" (half-angel, half-demon beings like Fairies and Pixies). In the end Jace is swayed by Clary and reasons that since the vampires broke the Accord by kidnapping a Mundane, their action is justified. Alec finally points out that they need weapons, but Jace has a solution for that issue.

In the Hotel Dumort Simon plays for time with one of his captors and then tries to stab him with an ancient knife. The vampire (Rafael) is not hurt at all. A second, female, vampire enters and tells Simon she's been wanting to meet him.

Clary and the three Shadowhunters arrive at a graveyard where weapons are stored in a grave. Isabelle leaves to visit a third person and find out how to get into the vampire lair. Jace and Clary take a weapon, but Alec's weapon of choice (the bow) is not present. He'll have to sneak into the Institute to fetch one. Alec names Jace as his ""Parabatai"". Jace then teaches Clary how to handle her Shadowhunter-blade properly and explains the concept of parabatai.

In the Hotel Dumort Raphael and the female vampire (Camille) discuss Simon, the accord and the rationale for breaking the acccord. Both have lived for centuries.

Isabelle visits her Seelie lover Meliorn and discusses recent events while making love. Meliorn has been to the Clave and is frustrated about the Shadowhunters' treatment of Seelies. Meliorn is also the lover of Camille the vampire. Isabelle tricks Meliorn into revealing how to get into the Hotel Dumort unseen.

Alec pilfers a bow and arrows from the stash in the institute. Hodge catches him in the act but doesn't stop him.

Jace and Isabelle visit a biker bar called Hardtail. Jace shows Clary how to look into the Shadowworld; most clients of the bar turn out to be vampires. Clary flirts with one of the vampires who recognizes her as a Shadowhunter. Jace uses this ruse to steal the vampires' motorbike; Clary and Jace ride off at great speed and end up flying.

In the hotel Dumort Camille charms Simon into revealing what he knows about Clary and her memory. The memory-wiping ability of Magnus Bane is known amongst the vampires. They make out for a long while while Alec and Isabelle enter the hotel Dumort via the service entrance. Camille feels the Shadowhunters intruding on the hotel and warns her minions while Simon pretends to be drunk.

Jace and Clary arrive at the hotel; Jace burns some runes in Clary's skin for protection and explains to her how the process of becoming a vampire works. They meet up with Alec and Isabelle who fought and slew some of the vampires. Simon tries to run but is intercepted by Raphael as the sounds of battle reach into his room. Isabelle escapes from hotel Dumort just before the Shadowhunters & Clary enter and a standoff occurs between Rafael and the Shadowhunters. Raphael finally lets Simon go.

Outside Clary and Simon hug while Clary declares Simon to be her best friend and kisses him on the cheek, clearly not what Simon would have hoped for.

In the final scene Simon is fixated on a pulsing vein in Clary's neck."

She wakes up to find Simon sitting on her bed and talks about the nightmare with him. Together they connect Magnus Bane to her memory loss. As Clary leaves, Simon has a vision about blood. He leaves frustrated, to the dismay of Clary who tries to stop him but confesses that the Shadowhunters' world is her world now.

The Shadowhunters, Clary and Hodge discuss Marcus Bane, the top-ranking warlock of Brooklyn. As payment for restoring Clary's memories they offer a large ruby enchanted with a spell and they plan to find him at a rave party.

In Chernobyl the viewer sees two hidden persons, of whom only the eyes can be seen. Valentine notices them and identifiers them as ""scouts from the Clave"". One of his minions (Pangorn) kills the scouts with a poison breath and dies in the same process.

At the police station Luke is interrogated by his co-worker who knows about the demons and the Shadowhunters.

Simon arrives home and falls on his bed and is then visited by both Maureen and his mother. Maureen wants to know if Simon and Clary are dating, which he's not. Maureen then says she'd like to. She cuts herself on a piece of glass and Simon is fascinated by the blood . When Maureen leaves frustrated he lucks the blood. At the rave the Shadowhunters meet Magnus. Jace hands the jewel to Magnus who confirms its authenticity but says he cannot return Clary's memories to her. Magnus says he knows that Dot is dead because he can not longer feel her magic. He then insists on her following him to his lair, which she refuses. He then takes off to his lair without her. Alec kills a Circle assassin and Magnus is very impressed by Alecs looks.

Outside, the Shadowhunters argue about the events until Jace sees a button which Clary took from Magnus Bane. Using his parabatai bond with Alec, he managers to track Magnus's location. They enter the hideout just in time to foil a raid by Valentine's troops. Clary discusses the issue of her memories again with Magnus and he agrees to summon the demon to which he has given her memories. Magnus hands the ruby back to Isabelle.

Simon calls Clary and leaves a message on her voicemail. He confesses not being able to think straight.

Magnus prepares for the summoning of the demon and urges Clary not to trust the Clave. Magnus is very interested in Alec. Clary draws an immaculate pentagram for the summoning of the demon. The five take their places on the pentagram and Magnus shares an intense look with Alec. During the summoning of the demon Valak the payments is a fond memory the person loves the most: Isabelle loses a memory of Alec, Clary loses a memory of her mother, Alec loses a memory of Jace and is in shock, breaking the bond. The demon is now free and threatens to take Jace with it; Clary slays the demon with her knife. Because of this her memories are now gone forever. Alec walks off and Magnus tells him there's nothing to be ashamed of, while Alec denies knowing anything.

Clary calls Simon and Simon denies the call. The shot pans to Simon standing in front of the hotel Dumort. Clary now touches her pendant and sees her mother and Valentine. However, Valentine knows he's watched and tells Clary he wants the Cup in exchange for her mother."

Jace names it a ""portal shard"" and Alec takes it and places it in a magical vault. During a conversation between Isabelle and Clary, Isabelle's mother enters. She knows about Clary (whom she, like most Shadowhunters, calls ""Fairchild"") and originates from Idris, the Shadowhunters' homeland.

Isabelle's mother acts in a cold manner to Isabelle. She explains to the group that the Seelies have stopped talking to the Shadowhunters because the latter requested the former to send scouts to Valentine (the ones which got killed in episode 4). She orders Jace and Isabelle to come with her, leaving Alec with Clary.

In the police station, Luke discusses the notion that all victims of the Demonic murders (see episode 1) where having hallucinations of werewolves, vampires and demons: Mundanes with the Sight. He deduces that Valentine is experimenting again, his end-goal being to get old of the Mortal Cup and destroy the Downworld.

Clary draws a picture of Valentine from her vision.

Jace and Alec discuss the events during the summoning of the demon. Jace misinterprets the kind of love Alec has for him as being parabatai love.

Raphael finds Simon in front of the Hotel Dumort, confronts him and chases him away.

Clary and Alec spar with quarterstaves. Clary mentions a hidden box bearing the initials ""J C"" which she opens once a year while crying. The box might have belonged to her father (Valentine Morgenstern), because Jocelyn always names ""Jonathan Clark"" as her father. The conversion is interrupted by Magnus Bane calling Alec and inviting him for a drink. Momentarily distracted, Alec fails to notice Clary leaving.

In the ""Jade Wolf"" restaurant a wolf enters the dining area through a giant cat flap (or wolf flap). The wolf behaves submissively to a man sitting at a table and disappears through a set of doors and transforms to Luke's unnamed coworker (thus being a werewolf).

The man sitting at a table holds a speech about werewolves being a family or pack to the guests at the diner, implying that all present are werewolves. He wants Clary too and shows a photograph of her.

Alec catches up with Clary who stands outside of the Academy, invisible. She speaks to Simon and the three of them agree to meet near the loft. Clary tells Alec she knows he loves Jace while he is straight; Alec is still in denial.

Isobel and Jace visit Meliorn and want answers.

In Chernobyl Valentine brands one of a group of volunteers then injects him with Seelie blood. The process is painful and it is uncertain whether he will survive.

Clary and Simon meet and hug. Simon easily jumps an 8 foot wall and climbs on a metal staircase making Clary wonder whether he took parkour lessons. The loft is covered in runes; this is the first time Clary can see them. Simon can also see the runes, which surprises Alec since it requires the Sight. When Clary can't open the door, Simon easily opens it (again, to everyone's surprise). In the burned-down loft Simon discovers the loose floorboard and Clary retrieves the box they were looking for. The box contains a few items seemingly belonging to a baby.

Outside, noise is heard and Alec sees something move large move quickly move amongst the trees; growling is heard and a large wolf is seen running away. A moment later Clary and Simon are kidnapped and taken away in a black sedan.

Isabelle and Meliorn discuss politics and Jace knows the fair folk are mourning for the death of their scouts. Meliorn more-or-less admits that the Seelie will side with whomever wins the struggle and will not take up arms.

Jace and Isabelle confront Alec in the loft. Jace and Alec form the parabatai bond again and use this to track Clary based on a picture, but fail. Jace and Alec argue about Clary.

Simon and Clary arrive at the Jade Wolf restaurant. Luke calls Alaric and the leader tells to ignore the call. In the restaurant the leader and Alaric sit down; Clary is angry at Alaric (whom she knows from the precinct). Simon is locked up and Clary plays for time by saying the Cup is in her loft. Simon hangs upside-down from the ceiling and uses his enhanced strength to break his bonds. He then calls Clary, whose phone is picked up by Jace. That evening Simon creates a diversion by activating gas-sprinklers and Clary is freed from a container by Luke. Luke carries her away but is stopped by the Shadowhunters and Simon is freed. The werewolves try to stop them but the alpha werewolf is attacked and killed by Luke (who is now the alpha werewolf by right of battle). Luke is severely wounded and will need the help of a Warlock, the only one who can cure the wounds.

The group drives off."
