""The place is here, the time is now, and the journey into the shadows that we're about to watch could be our journey.""

Mike Ferris (Earl Holliman), an amnesiac in an Air Force jumpsuit, finds himself in a town strangely devoid of people. But despite the emptiness, he has the odd feeling that he's being watched. As he inspects the town's cafe, phone booth, police station, drug store and movie theater, his desperation mounts. Finally he collapses, hysterically pushing the ""walk"" button of a stoplight again and again. In reality, the ""walk"" button is a panic button, and Ferris is an astronaut-trainee strapped into an isolation booth in simulation of a moon flight. After 484 hours in the booth, he has cracked from sheer lonliness. His wanderings in the vacant town have been nothing more than a hallucination.

""Up there, up there in the vastness of space, in the void that is sky, up there is an enemy known as isolation. It sits there in the stars waiting, waiting with the patience of eons, forever waiting...in the Twilight Zone."""

""Street scene: Summer. The present. Man on a sidewalk named Lew Bookman, age sixty-ish. Occupation: pitchman Lew Bookman, a fixture of the summer, a rather minor component to a hot July, a nondescript, commonplace little man whose life is a treadmill built out of sidewalks. And in just a moment, Lew Bookman will have to concern himself with survival--because as of three o' clock this hot July afternoon he'll be stalked by Mr. Death.""

Sidewalk salesman Lew Bookman (Ed Wynn) soon returns to his apartment, where he is confronted by a man in a dark suit. The man in question is Mr. Death (Murray Hamilton), but he does not reveal his name to Lew.

As they talk, a little girl who lives in the apartments named Maggie (Dana Dillaway) visits him. When Lew points out the man sitting in a nearby chair, she claims she doesn't see anyone, and assumes Lew is playing a game on her.

Death tells Lew that he is set to die at midnight, and is lucky, as he will go peacefully in his sleep. Of course, Lew does not want to die, and Death says that reprieves can be granted, if certain circumstances are met. Lew tries everything from saying he's wanted to ride in a helicopter, to traveling to see a tribal dance, but these are not valid enough reasons. Then, Lew plays the card that sticks, when he claims that he's always wanted to perform a masterpiece: the Big Pitch (""one for the angels,"" as he says). This allows Death to accept, but when he asks Lew when the Big Pitch will occur, Lew gives no definite details, figuring he's outsmarted Death.

However, Death informs Lew that he still must 'collect' at midnight, and since Lew seems unwilling to play by the rules, he must take someone else in Lew's place. Just then, a screech is heard outside the apartment building, and it appears that Maggie has been struck by a truck. Lew rushes to her side, where she appears to be conscious, but shaken. However, it is then that she asks Lew who the man with the suit behind him is.

Knowing that Death has now chosen to take Maggie, Lew begs Death to take him, but their deal is still in place: Lew must give his Big Pitch in order to be taken.

As evening settles in, and Maggie's condition seems to hold between Life and Death, Death prepares to collect Maggie, when Lew suddenly comes out of the building with his salescase. Lew claims he's going to make his biggest pitch now, but Death notes that it seems there's noone around. Even so, Lew begins to make his pitch...and soon grabs the attention of Death himself!

Lew charms Death with the amazing deals in his suitcase, soon causing him to want in on the amazing deals. Finally, Lew offers Death something so rare that, it's one-of-a-kind: himself (aka Lew). It is then that the clock strikes midnight, and Death grows upset that Lew has made him miss his appointment. However, Lew's big pitch has been completed, and even though it's past midnight, Death claims he will take Lew.

Before he goes, the Doctor attending to Maggie comes down the apartment stairs, and tells Lew that she'll be alright.

As they prepare to go, Lew packs up his salescase, and prepares to take it with him. Lew claims someone 'up there' might need something from him, before asking Death if he really is going 'upthere.'

""Up there, Mr. Bookman,"" replies Death. ""You made it.""

Somehow, Fate's glance gives Denton's hand a life of its own, and Denton gets off two miraculous shots, disarming his tormentor and regaining the respect of the town.

The moment his opponent enters the saloon, Denton downs the potion--and sees the other man doing exactly the same thing!

""You're about to meet a hypochondriac. Witness Mr. Walter Bedeker, age forty-four, afraid of the following: death, disease, other people, germs, drafts, and everything else. He has one interest in life, and that's Walter Bedeker. One preoccupation: the life and well-being of Walter Bedeker. One abiding concern about society: that if Walter Bedeker should die, how will it survive without him?""

Walter Bedeker (David Wayne) is a rather argumentative and egotistical man who feels that the world (from doctors to germs to his wife) wants him dead. However, in Walter's mind, he is too important a person to die (even though he seems to have very little to offer the world except in the way of snide criticism).

After a doctor visits him and finds nothing wrong with him, Walter dismisses the doctor as a 'quack,' and goes back to his train of thought that his death will come soon. Walter ponders why man has to die in such a short span compared to how long the Earth has existed, pondering why man can't live longer than 100 years, or even 1,000 years.

Walter's ponderings are soon interrupted when a man named Mr. Cadwallader (Thomas Gomez), an impeccably-dressed, jovial fat man who also happens to be the Devil, appears by his bedside. Cadwallader soon explains that he is willing to give Walter immortality in exchange for his soul. However, Walter isn't so eager to say yes, and agrees under certain conditions. Cadwallader agrees to give Walter immortality and indestructibility, as well as the inability to age. Cadwallader also promises Walter an escape clause to their deal: if at any time he tires of life, all he needs to do is summon Cadwallader. Walter smiles smugly at the jovial man as if he were crazy, and signs a contract for their deal.

Walter first tests his newfound indestructibility by placing his hands on a nearby heater. When his hands emerge unscathed, he eagerly leaves the apartment. Walter soon uses his newfound indestructibility as a way to claim accident claims by throwing himself in front of busses and trains. However, after surviving 14 incidents with only his suit showing wear and tear (and numerous checks paid out to him by the transit companies), Walter has now grown bored.

His wife has grown concerned, and when Walter attempts to poison himself (and lives), demands to know what is going on. Walter explains his deal with Cadwallader, but his wife refuses to believe it. Turning a deaf ear to his wife's plea to seek mental help, Walter rushes to the roof of their building, intent to get a thrill out of throwing himself off the top of it. His wife follows and tries to get him to stop, but ends up accidentally falling off the roof herself. Walter then casually strolls back to the apartment, and calls the Police, claiming he has murdered his wife.

Walter is taken away, and placed on trial. His defense attorney soon grows exasperated when it seems that Walter's actions in court will send him directly to the electric chair for his wife's murder. Unknown to the lawyer, Walter is savoring the thrill of being electrocuted and surviving.

However, when the sentencing is read, Walter's expectant glee turns to shock when the Judge delivers a sentence of life imprisonment instead. Walter is returned to his holding cell, awaiting transfer to prison. A guard delivers his meal, and snidely proclaims that Walter will probably last 20-50 years in prison before he dies.

Walter soon summons Cadwallader, and wishes to use his escape clause. Cadwallader then causes Walter to pitch over and die of a heart attack, claiming the egotistical man's soul.

Closing narration:

""There's a saying, 'Every man is put on Earth condemned to die, time and method of execution unknown.' Perhaps this is as it should be. Case in point: Walter Bedeker, lately deceased, a little man with such a yen to live. Beaten by the Devil, by his own boredom--and by the scheme of things in this, the Twilight Zone."""

Allenby tells Corry he's received a full pardon, and that they've come to get him. But there's a hitch: Corry can only take fifteen pounds of gear, and Alicia weighs more than that. Corry refuses to leave her behind, claiming that she's a woman. Reluctantly, Allenby draws his gun and shoots Alicia full in the face, revealing a mass of smolderingwires.

Hall (Richard Conte), a man with a cardiac condition, has sought out the aid of Dr. Rathmann (John Larch), a psychiatrist. He explains that he's been dreaming in chapters, as if in a movie serial. In his dream, Maya (Suzanne Lloyd), a carnival dancer, lures him into a funhouse and onto a roller coaster with the express intention of scaring him to death.

On board the Glasgow is a German named Carl Lanser (Nehemiah Persoff), with no memory of how he got there, yet with the feeling that he's met all the passengers somewhere before. Things are made even more mysterious by Lanser's certainty that an enemy sub is stalking the ship, and by his premonition that something is going to happen at 1:15 a.m. His fear provides correct: at one-fifteen a U-boat surfaces. Peering through binoculars, Lanser sees that its captain is...himself! The U-boat sinks the helpless freighter, then crew members machine-gun the survivors. Lanser sinks beneath the waters.

When a nurse approaches him Clegg asks her if Gart is still there and the nurse, surprised, says that he is. Clegg goes into Gart's room, and Gart says that he feels fine. Clegg looks around and says that the ship is fine and they put it under wraps. Gart says that Clegg doesn't look well, and Clegg lights a cigarette, his hand shaking.

Clegg shuts the door and says that he wants to asks some questions to get oriented. He asks Gart when he left there, and then says that he walked out with someone. Gart says that Clegg didn't leave with anyone, and Clegg shows him a newspaper with a headline of the two of them in the crash. The photo shows the two of them. Clegg goes over how that blacked out when the ship disappeared, then says that there three of them, and Colonel Ed Harrington was the three. They brought the three of them to the hospital, and only Gart had a broken leg while the other two only had scratches. The doctors discharged Clegg and Harrington. Gart says that he doesn't know anyone named Harrington, only two of them went up, and Harrington left alone.

When Gart says that he should have someone look at him, Clegg goes over everything that happened, repeating Gart's exact words to Harrington.

-----

The previous day, Harrington jokes with Gart and then leaves with Clegg. There's a newspaper there talking about three men and a photo of all three of them.

Harrington and Clegg to a bar, and the bartender recognizes them and says the drinks are on the house. A woman chats with Clegg, and Harrington looks at himself in the mirror over the bar. He stares and both Clegg and the bartender notices. Harrington drops his beer and clutches at his head, and tells Clegg that he feels like he doesn't belong there and he'd disappear if he let himself go. Harrington takes a drink that the bartender brings him and then goes to call his folks. He goes to a phone booth and makes the call.

A few minutes later, Harrington staggers out of the booth and calls Clegg over. He says that he called his parents and his mother told him that he didn't have a son. Harrington's father got on the phone, also said he didn't have a son, and told Harrington to get off the phone. Harrington feels like he isn't there, and it feels like they shouldn't have come back from the flight and something or someone let them come back when it shouldn't have.

Clegg goes to get Harrington a drink, picks up a newspaper from a table, and sees that it now says that only two men went up. He goes to the phone booth and discovered that Harrington is gone. Clegg goes back to the bar and notices that Harrington's glass is gone. The bartender and the woman have no memory of Harrington, and the bartender says that Clegg came in there alone. Clegg yells that the bartender is crazy and storms out.

A panicked Clegg goes home and calls the air force base. The commanding officer is out and he hangs up. His girlfriend Amy comes in, and Clegg says that he's in trouble. Amy complains that Clegg didn't pick her up at the bus station, and then realizes that Clegg is upset. He says that he wired her to come, takes out the wire, but it has no mention of Harrington like he remembers it. Amy doesn't know who Harrington is, even when Clegg says that they double-dated a hundred times.

Clegg's commanding office calls, and Clegg talks to him. When he says Harrington, the general says that he doesn't remember Harrington, then breaks into tears and hangs up. Then Clegg chuckles and figures that it's a gag, and Harrington is still at the bar. Clegg goes back there and calls through the doors to Harrington, then breaks in and plaintively calls to his crewmate, and begs him to show himself. He falls into the booth and begs Harrington to come back.

Clegg tells Gart that he ran down the street afterward, and doesn't know what happened to Amy. Gart says that he never heard of Harrington and he must be an illusion. Clegg insists that Harrington isn't an illusion and was yanked away by whatever made a mistake and let them go through when they shouldn't have gotten back. He figures that it feels like he doesn't belong, goes to the room's mirror, sees that his reflection isn't there, yells that he doesn't want it to happen, and runs out of the room. Gart goes out but there's no sign of Clegg, and the nurse has never heard of Clegg. Now there's only one bed in the room instead of three, and the nurse helps Gart to his bed. The newspaper says that Gart was the only astronaut who went up.

Major Henderson comes back, and the nurse tells him that the ward is empty. They check the room, and there's no beds there.

The X-20 disappears from the hangar, and no one remembers it or the crew."

The ship is soon found to have crashed on an unknown world. Of the crew, only three are in decent conditon: Donlin, Pierson, & Corey. Of the three, Corey is desperate for survival, and shuns Donlin's giving water to a 4th crew member, whose condition is critical. Eventually, the 4th member succumbs to his wounds.

During this time, Pierson surmises that given the height of the sun, they must be close to Earth. However, Donlin surmises that their chance of rescue is nil, as the space agency had only create the one craft they were in.

Donlin then has Pierson and Corey go off on a scouting mission, to find life, water, or anything. As night falls, Corey returns. He tells Donlin that He and Pierson parted ways to search, but when Donlin sees Corey taking a large swig from his canteen, he suspects foul play.

Donlin gets Corey to confess that he took Pierson's canteen, and left him to die. At gunpoint, Donlin has Crey lead them back to Pierson, only to find him having crawled a ways away.

Donlin puts down his weapon, and with his last strength, Pierson attempts to point out what he saw on an upper ridge some ways off. He draws two small horizontal lines, but expires as he draws a long vertical line through them.

Donlin attempts to climb up the ridge, when Corey grabs his gun, claiming that he wants Donlin's canteen. Donlin once again speaks out against Corey's actions, but is shot. However, the bullet not only kills Donlin, but punctured his canteen, leaving Corey with only his canteen.

He attempts to climb the ridge, whose path is filled with loose rocks. When he gets to the top, a look of pain and shock spreads across his face. Down below, he sees what Pierson was attempting to draw: telephone poles. Their ship had gone up, and crashed back to Earth, in the Southwestern desert of the United States."

In a fit of cowardice, one of the British pilots, Lt. Terrance Decker (Kenneth Haigh) flees, abandoning his comrade, Capt. Alexander Mackaye, (Robert Warwick) alone to a certain death at the hands of the enemy planes, with no possibility of help from their squadron. Decker flies through a strange white cloud, then he descends and lands at an American air force base with highly advanced planes and equipment. He is taken into custody and discovers that, somehow, he has travelled into the future, to 1959. Of course, the base commander believes this to be a prank or hoax, thinking that Decker is either deranged or on some secret mission. While under interrogation, Decker learns, incredibly, that his comrade not only survived 42 years before, but went on to save many lives during WWII. In fact, now Air Vice Marshall Mackaye is on his way to the base for inspection. Decker reveals that he had, long ago, secretly nicknamed Mackaye ""Old Leadbottom"" for embarrassing injuries sustained earlier. The base commander hopes that, once Mackaye sees Decker, that this mystery will be resolved. Decker, at first, doesn't want to see Mackaye for fear he'll be discredited as a coward. But then he realizes that perhaps the only way ""Mack"" could have survived is if he somehow got help while fighting those German planes. Decker suddenly realizes that maybe he was brought into the future for a purpose, to learn that Mackaye did, in fact, survive. The base commander scoffs at this idea but Decker seizes upon the opportunity to redeem himself and save Mackaye so all those other lives could be saved as well. He escapes in his plane and flies away seeking that same white cloud. In the meantime, Mackaye arrives at the base and is asked if he knows Lt. Decker. Mackaye recalls fondly how he and Terry Decker encountered enemy planes while flying together but then Decker appeared to fly away, leaving him alone. But then, suddenly out of nowhere, Decker reappeared with his guns blazing and destroyed several German planes before being killed while saving Mackaye's life. When shown Decker's personal effects kept at the base, Mackaye demands to know what the hell is going on. The base commander says ""You better sit down, Old Leadbottom!"""

Shortly thereafter, almost all the electronics and machines on the street stop working. A small group of neighbors is unsure what has caused this. One little boy suggests it's the work of aliens, but his assumption is excused as ridiculous.

As the neighbors continue to talking, one neighbor's car starts on it's own. The group instantly grow suspicious of the man and his family. The owner of the car denies any knowledge as to why this is happening, but few are seldom to believe him.

The blame keeps getting passed around, as someone reports of a neighbor who stares up at the sky on some nights, looking for something, as well as tinkering with something in his basement.

As night settles, a dark figure is seen coming towards the group. One man takes a rifle and shoots the figure, who crumples to the ground. Upon further inspection, it is revealed that the figure was another neighbor, who had supposedly left the street to see if anyone over in nearby streets was experiencing the same issues.

The shooter is soon looked on with suspicion: why was he so quick to fire that gun? The person who fired the gun is then further surprised when his house's lights turn on by themselves. Several people attempt to stone him, before he crazily yells that he believes the alien to be the boy from before, who talked of aliens.

As the panic rises, lights and machines all along the street begin turning on and off, sending the once simple people into a mad panic, placing blame on each other and causing chaos.

On a hilltop some distance away, two aliens observe the panic, explaining to the other that mankind is very easy panic, and that they can just as easily turn on the other, which will make domination over their species by the aliens rather easy."

Roger is so obsessed that he continues to dial her number until she picks up the phone. When she finally does, she tolerates his protestations, but does not return his affection. After she hangs up, a person waiting for the telephone forces Roger out so he can make an emergency call. As Roger tries to protest, the man gives Roger a business card, informing him that the person listed on it can help solve the problems that the man overheard through the phone booth.

Roger takes the card, and goes to the residence of a Professor Daemon. The Professor is an old man who has very little patience for quibbles, and wants to know why Roger is there. When the Professor asks Roger if he seeks wealth or power, Roger simply mentions that he just wants Leila to love him. The answer bores the Professor, but he assures Roger that he can make Leila love him with the use of a love potion. The Professor hints that this may be a bad idea, but Roger is too excited to listen to him. Roger eagerly buys the Professor's potion for $1, and hurries off.

Roger soon after arrives at Leila's apartment with some flowers and champagne. Even though she doesn't want to see him, she is willing to take him up on his offer for just having a glass of champagne. As she freshens up, Roger pours the potion into her glass. Soon after drinking it, Leila falls madly in love with Roger. The two are wed shortly thereafter.

6 months later, Roger has grown a bit exasperated over the potion's effects. Just as the Professor promised, Leila loves Roger passionately, and does everything she can to please him. Feeling at the end of his rope, Roger returns to the Professor's residence. Roger tries to act like everything is perfectly fine, but the Professor soon gets him to admit that he's going out of his mind with how stifling Leila's love for him is. Roger asks the Professor if Leila's love could be controlled or tempered, but the Professor says that the only way to end the desires is with a special potion of his, that he calls 'The Glove Cleaner.' The potion is an untraceable, painless, tasteless poison that Daemon offers to sell Roger for $1000. Roger is upset to lose all his savings, but finally relents. The Professor warns Roger that he must administer the potion without hesitation: if he loses his nerve, he'll never be able to administer 'The Glove Cleaner' again. As Roger leaves the Professor's house, the old man says sagely to himself: ""Always the same way. First the stimulant... then the chaser.""

Roger returns home with some champagne to administer 'The Glove Cleaner' with. Roger asks Leila to light some candles, which distracts her as he administers the potion to her glass. Just as he is about to give her the poisoned champagne, she coyly reveals to him that she's pregnant. The shock causes Roger to drop the glasses, spilling the potion. Roger mutters to himself that he couldn't have gone through with it anyway. As Roger's head falls back in a daze, Leila cuddles close, and lovingly reminds him that they'll be together for the rest of their lives."

The rider is wearing a Sons of Anarchy jacket.

Another gang wearing Mayan jackets break into a warehouse.

At a convenience store, the audience is introduced to show protagonist and club vice president Jackson Tellar (Charlie Hunman). Oddly he is looking at children's storybooks. He is very attractive and the checkout operator is interested but they are disturbed by a loud explosion.

It changes to morning and the Sons of Anarchy arrive at a burnt out warehouse. A police officer and fireman are paid to cover up the investigation. Bodies are found in the ruins and guns have been stolen. This is a problem as the guns have been sold to another gang (the One Niners) who need the weapons urgently. The opening credit roll and these don't change for at least six seasons. Images of bikes and tattoos roll as the names appear and then disappear.

At the garage (owned by the Sons of Anarchy) a prospect is charged with getting a moose out of the car. Jackson receives a phone call from his mother Gemma (Katey Segal). The rapport is cheeky but lovely and she clearly has a hand in the operation of a club. Jackson asks his mother to check in on his ex-wife Wendy. She is pregnant and is meant to be sending him the doctors bills. He hasn't been able to reach her nor has he received any bills.

The next scene is set to loud music as the audience watches a heavily pregnant woman (Drea de Matteo) shoot heroin.

Club president Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) meets with the One Niner leader Laroy (Tory Kittles). Laroy is not happy with the delay and he is not letting the history of the two clubs account for any leeway.

At the storage place, Jackson is looking for baby things when he discovers a manuscript written by his deceased father, club founder and president John Tellar. The scene switches to the clubhouse as prospect Half Sac (Johnny Lewis) reveals how he got his nick name.

At Jackson's ex-wifes house, Gemma arrives to find her passed out on the floor in a pool of blood. She phones Jackson who immediately goes to the hospital. There Tara Knowles (Maggie Siff) a paediatric surgeon is introduced. Wendy had tracks all over her and the baby, born ten weeks premature, is very ill with only small chance of survival. Jackson tells the surgeon that his son's name is Able. Jackson leaves the hospital enraged and Clay sends Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) and Chibs (Tommy Flanagan) to look after him. Jackson arrives at bar and beats a man he accuses of selling crank to his pregnant ex-wife.

At a logging venue, Jackson visits his best friend Opie (Ryan Hurst). Jackson needs him for a job to retrieve the guns. Opie is reluctant. He is recently out of prison and his wife Donna (Sprague Grayden) wants out of the life. Jackson tells him that the club needs him. Opie agrees to the job.

In the chapel (a room designed for club meetings) Piney, Opies father (William Lucking) tells Jackson that the club is there for him.

At a party that includes boxing and pole dancers Jackson suggests moving out of guns, given the heat it is causing. Clay shuts him down quickly reminding him of the money he will need with a baby and of the blood already spilt.

Wendy, who is in hospital, apologizes and cries. Jackson tells her that she needs help. Wendy reveals that there are drugs at the house. She needs him to get rid of them but when Jackson arrives his mother Gemma is there cleaning. Jackson feels cleaning the house is a waste of time and that his son will die. Gemma slaps him and tells him that he is the only person this baby has and he needs to believe in him. For the second time that night, Jackson is told to go see his son.

At Gemma's house the audience learns that Gemma is now married to club president Clay Morrow. Gemma tells Clay that Jackson has been thinking about his dead father. Gemma wants Clay to keep Jackson in line. Eventually Clay, who suffers from arthritis in the hands, wont be able to ride anymore which means he wont be able to be club president. When that happens Jackson will take over and Gemma wants him following in the right father's footsteps.

The club meets with white supremist and recently paroled Ernest Darby (Mitch Pileggi). Clay wants Darby to keep the meth dealing out of Charming. The meeting is hostile but Darby agrees.

At the hospital Tara tells Gemma that Able needs his second surgery. She also asks Gemma to look in on Wendy. When Gemma refuses, Tara asks Gemma if she has a problem with her assisting in the surgeries. Gemma denies this but ten years of Tara being away has not mended any bridges and their altercation borderlines on the physical side.

At Opie's house, his wife Donna (Sprague Grayden) is verging on hysteria when she guesses correctly that Opie may be doing another job for the club. He has only recently got out of prison. Jackson sees part of the altercation and tells Opie to take his child to the hospital as an alibi for Clay and for not doing the job.

Elvis impersonator and club member Bobby is upset to learn that he has lost his performance spot to an Asian Elvis impersonator. The problem is resolved after the prospect beats the man and Bobby takes his spot back.

The Sons retrieve their guns from the Mayans while Jacksons son is operated on. The heist does not go well. Jackson is shot (he has a vest on). Some Mayans are killed and the Sons learn that Darby is trying to gain control of Charming. The warehouse is ignited.

Gemma visits Wendy and has some harsh words. She hands Wendy a bible with a syringe inside telling her that Able will never call her Mummy.

When Jackson learns that his son made it through the second surgery. He embraces Tara. The hug almost becomes more but Tara realising that Jackson is bloody tells him to go clean up.

In the closing moments, Bobby sings Elvis song I Cant Help falling in Love with You. Jackson does clean himself up and looks long and hard in the mirror. The final embers of the explosion are seen. Wendy fights for survival after an apparent drug overdose. Jackson finally visits his son. Gemma and Clay look on. The skull appears signalling the first episode of Sons of Anarchy is over. It has been quite a beginning."

It appears he has a day job. Club president Clay (Ron Perlman) arrives and hands the club out money. The gun deal with the Niners is complete. Tig (Kim Coates) reveals the two dead bodies still at the warehouse may have his DNA on them (he was seeing both women). Clay is angry. Tig has been in prison before and his DNA will be on the data base. Tig isnt worried. He has some ideas about how to get rid of the evidence that disturb Clay. Like Clay, the rest of the club is concerned.

At the warehouse, Deputy Chief Hale (Taylor Sheridan) begins searching and finds the bodies. Clay meets with Chief Unser (Dayton Callie). It emerges that they have had a mutually beneficial ""business"" arrangement for many years. Unser can't help Clay. The Chief has cancer and will retire soon. He isn't in a position anymore to help the Sons.

Hale has a difficult conversation with Jackson (literally Jackson kept riding off and the deputy Chief had to yell at him from his car). The deputy reminds Jackson that he will be chief soon and unlike his predecessor he won't look the other way for the Sons.

Jackson visits his son at the hospital. There, he sees old girlfriend Tara Knowles (Maggie Siff). They talk about Able and he says he is glad to have her back in Charming.

Opie (Ryan Hurst) is having money worries now that he turned clean. He approaches his Dad Piney (William Lucking) for money but Piney cannot help, he has his own bills. Piney tells him about a protection run but Opie wants to stay clean.

At the chapel the club need to organise a murder to take attention away from the warehouse. Clay wants to kill someone but Jackson arranges to get two bodies from the cemetery. The cemetery worker Skeeter (Bob Rusch) agrees but only if they can get a crow eater Emily Duncan (Sherrie Rose) to go out with him. Emily agrees. It appears she is a fan of the club and fan of Jacksons. She will go out with Skeeter if Jackson will go out with her. That deal is made.

Darby (Mitch Pileggi) and Mayan leader Alvarez (Emilo Rivera) continue to work together to undo the Sons. Whilst Gemma (Katey Segal) is visiting Able in hospital she runs into Tara. The doctor suspects (correctly) that Gemma may have supplied the needle with the overdose that almost killed Wendy. The two exchange insults and it is very clear that there is no love lost between the pair.

Clay and Opie have a talk. Opie lets him in a little describing his problems with Donna. Organising the murder is problematic. They run into a police car and several other issues but the murder is created.

Clay makes it clear to Chief Unser that they are not friends. He blackmails him into staying on the job for another six months so the club can rebuild.

At the shops, Donna (Sprague Graydon) does not have enough money to pay for her groceries. In the parking lot, Gemma appears with the groceries that Donna put back. Gemma tells her that they are a family but Donna does not need any more family. She is invited to dinner regardless.

Unser gets straight to honouring the new deal with Clay. Hale is not happy but when he approaches Unser in the barber shop he is quickly put in his place. Unser takes the guard detail off the warehouse and Sons steal the bodies of the two women.

Jackson continues to read his fathers manuscript on the roof. But when Gemma arrives he fails to tell her about the book. Ever the loyal matriarch, she searches his place but only finds a wedding photograph that brings her to tears.

In the final moments the Sons burn the two women. Jackson looks in on a very ill Wendy (Drea De Matteo). Hale watches as a bike rides by. Opie and Donna eat dinner with their family (it looks like they will not be joining the Sons for dinner). Things are tense. At Gemmas house, the club has a lively dinner and Jackson smiles as his mother kisses his stepfather. The credits roll."

Jackson (Charlie Hunman) gives a young girl money (daughter of prominent Charming business man Elliot Oswald played by Patrick St. Espirit) but then harasses a clown. The boys are torn away to a meeting with the IRA. Contact Michael McKeavy (Kevin Chapman) is not happy about the current Sons problems and wont wait while they rebuild.

The young girl Tristen (played by Liana Liberato) becomes missing. She is found raped and beaten. Her father asks the Sons for help. Clay (Ron Perlman) agrees to deliver the rapist to him but only if Oswald promises to kill him.

Deputy Chief Hale (Taylor Sheridan) meets with his father Jacob (Walter Addison) and Leo Kessler (Steve Kramer). They are (correctly) worried the Sons might be helping Oswald with some vigilante justice. This is a problem because Leo wants some land that Oswald is selling and he is worried Oswald might sell it to Clay. Hale disagrees with the motive but agrees with the sentiment and visits the Sons.

In hospital Jacksons ex-wife Wendy (Drea De Matteo) is recovering and is visited by a doctor and Jackson's high school girlfriend Tara (played by Maggie Siff). Tara is convinced that Wendy did not have an overdose and wants the truth. She tries to reach out to her by saying they are alike but Wendy is no rat and says nothing.

Tara receives a phone call from a man who says ""she is hard to find"". She hangs up and is clearly distressed. Later, she asks Hale if a restraining order from Chicago would still be valid here. She says she dated a guy in Chicago and things got ""weird"".

The probationary (Johnny Lewis) is told by Juice (Theo Rossi) to follow Hale. Unfortunately the only bike available is a kid's dirt bike . Ever the dutiful club hopeful, he uses the small bike.

The club investigate the girl's rape. They are not bound by traditional laws and have a lot more success than the police. Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) says he has nothing on the case and is worried the Sons may interfere with the investigation.

The Sons catch up with Darby (Mitch Mileggi) but he denies he has anything to do with the rape. They follow up a false lead and end up at a bible study group. It is difficult to find a lead because the girl won't say much and the mother Karen Oswald (Judith Hoag) is not letting her see anyone, claiming her daughter doesn't remember anything.

Gemma (Katey Segal) visits Wendy but this time but Wendy is stronger and she fights back a little, trading insults with the club matriarch.

Gemma sneaks into see the girl at the hospital and convinces the mother to talk. It turns out the girl was raped by a fat man dressed as a clown. Hale sees the Sons chasing a lead but when he goes to his car, his tyre is flat.

SAMCRO head to the carnival and get into a fight with the carnies. They capture the clown and let Oswald kill him. He cannot do it so Clay does it for him, keeping the knife with Oswald's fingerprints on it so he can be blackmailed later. As vice president of the club, Jackson is angry that Clay is making decisions without consulting him.

It turns out the man stalking Tara is a federal agent.

John Tellar (Nicholas Guest) narrates as Jackson reads his manuscript.

Juice is found dressed on the ground like a baby. This is his punishment for getting stoned and not attending to club business.

Jackson visits Wendy and admits he was to blame. He wasn't ready for marriage or a child. He was to blame for Wendy's overdose. He takes her to see Able and is she is shocked at how small her baby is. She cries and apologizes. Jackson tells Wendy to get back to rehab.

Agent Kohn (Tara's stalker) arrives and makes contact with Hale."

Hale is giving Cohen a lot of information, unaware that the real reason he is here is to unsettle Tara (Maggie Siff). Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) sees the Federal agent meeting with Hale and is angry that this happening without his approval or even knowledge.

The Sons meet in their chapel, also very concerned that Kohnis here. They need to move the guns and, after some discussion, it is agreed that Jackson (Charlie Human) and Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) will go to Nevada to source a new spot to store the weapons. In Nevada, the Devil's motorcycle club is headed by Jury (Michael Shamus Wiles), a former friend of Jackson's Dad. They two were in Vietnam together.

Doctor Tara Knowles (Maggie Siff) sees flower petals on her windscreen and also becomes aware that Kohn is around. She searches for a gun but then realises she has a better source of protection and goes to see Jackson. Under the ruse that her Dad's car needs fixing, she asks for a lift home. Jackson cannot help; he is headed to Nevada but Gemma (Katey Segal) the club matriarch and Tara's old (now new) enemy is tasked. For some reason, Gemma obliges.

Prospect Half-Sack (Johnny Lewis) makes the mistake of saying he is attracted to Gemma (he uses different words) in ear shot of her old man Clay (Ron Perlman).

On road to Nevada, the Mayans spot Jackson and Bobby. When Clay hears he plans a patch over (turning the Devils into Sons) and is headed to Nevada with a few others to help ""persuade"" them.

Half way there Bobby and Jackson find a young man sitting on their bike. Thinking the Sons are on a similar level, the man confesses to hitting his girlfriend Susie (Mircea Monroe). The Sons help the young man learn that both sitting on bikes and hitting the fairer sex is not preferred behaviour. Susie rides off with Jackson. Gemma contacts her best friend and Porn Queen Luann Delaney (Dendrie Taylor) for help. Luann is married to one of the Sons who is currently in prison Otto (played by series creator Kurt Sutter). Luann has a friend who is an agent and Gemma asks her to do a check on Tara. They don't find much but they do discover the restraining order Tara had on Kohn.

In Nevada, Uncle Jury is thrilled to see Jackson and is in a position to help the Sons. He has a strip club where the weapons can be stored. Susie is taught how to be a crow-eater by Cherry (Taryn Manning). Cherry's life ambition is be an old lady. Bobby is given a $1200 gift in the form of the lovely Daytona. Jax is worried about the patch over and Bobby is worried about how much Jackson has started second guessing Clay.

Clay suggests to Jury's gang The Devils that they become the Nevada version of the Sons of Anarchy. The club sit open mouthed as it dawns on them that despite the fact they are voting on it they may not have a choice.

Juice (Theo Rossi) and Tig (Kim Coates) steal a truck in order to transport the guns to Nevada. It does not go to plan because Juice feeds the guard dog crank in order to subdue it. Not surprisingly, this does not work and the dog bites Tig on his bottom.

Jury and his club agree to the patch over. Somewhat arrogantly, Clay spray paints the words Sons on the wall whilst Jackson gives Jury a vest and they embrace. A patch-over party begins.

Cherry may just get her wish to become an old lady when she and Half-sac find common ground. This is ruined when Clay, still angry about the prospect's earlier remarks cuts in and takes Cherry with him. Cherry knows club rules and agrees. Susie and Jackson spend the night together.

Back in Charming, Tig is finding it hard to forgive Juice.

In the morning, Jackson takes a walk to read some words on a cave as his father John Teller (Nicholas Guest) narrates. When Tig and Juice arrive, they are disappointed to see the party is over. Susie is surprised to see that Cherry slept with Clay and Cherry fills her in the way of the world of clubs.

Gemma is very suspicious of why Tara is back in Charming. She turns up with the car but Tara sees it as an excuse. Gemma worries about what kind of influence Tara may have on Jackson especially since he is already becoming defiant. She does give Tara a more effective gun.

On way back from his bushwalk, Jackson runs into the Mayans and a chase begins. When he arrives at the clubhouse this turns into a gun battle. Kohn looks on in shock, he has been watching.

It is too much for Susie who leaves on the back of her boyfriend's bike. It appears they have reunited. Jackson does not seem to care.

Back in Charming Jackson is glad to see Able and Tara. When he goes to see Able, Tara opens an envelope and finds a picture of Jackson in bed with Susie.

There is only one person who could have put it there."

Otto saves Chuck from a prison beating and the audience cannot help notice that Chuck has a habit of putting his hands in a place ""that hands should really only be put on when the person is in private"".

Gemma (Katey Segal) is organising a fund raiser. While she and best friend Luan (Dendire Taylor) are setting up, a lady called April (Liiane Curtis) approaches her. She is asking for permission for her ex-husband Kyle to come to the fundraiser tomorrow to see their child's band play. Gemma is reluctant and asks husband and club president Clay.

Clay takes it to the table. It turns out Kyle is an ex-member of the Sons and is the reason Opie (Ryan Hurst) went to prison. The club is reluctant but surprisingly Opie thinks it is a good idea and the vote passes.

While reading to his baby Able who is in special care in the hospital, Jackson notices Special Agent Kohn (Jay Karnes) watching him.

As requested by Otto, the club picks up Chuck from prison.

The credits roll.

At the fund raiser Kyle (Brian Van Holt) does arrive but he has a very young girl with him (making his ex very angry) and an idea that he want to share with the club (making Jackson very angry).

It turns out that Chuck has $416 000 stashed away (making the reason the club is helping him a little more obvious). He also has ""compulsory masturbation disorder"" but it is temporarily cured after Clay threatens to throw him the closet if he sees him do it again.

A shocked Tara (Maggie Siff) sees Kohn at the hospital. He tries to explain his presence by saying it is work business and he is uncovering a big arms deal (proving that he has actually been watching the Sons very carefully). He also admits to sending the photos of Jackson (he wanted het to know what he was like) and putting the rose petals (she always liked them) on her car. She reminds him of the restraining order and he promises not to contact her again.

Jackson and Opie see that Kyle still has his Sons tattoo (a major sin given he was thrown out and is frankly lucky he was not killed). Jackson goes to approach but Opie wants to handle it.

Donna (Opies wife played by Sprague Grayden) and Jackson have a very frank talk. Donna wants Opie out of the club like Kyle. Jackson tells her that Kyle was thrown out because he deserted Opie on a heist. He tells her that Opie would never leave because the club it is in their DNA. Jackson finds Opie and Kyle exchanging blows. It is over and Kyle tells them how much he misses the club.

Chuck's ""tic"" loses the club some business at the garage. Clay loses his temper and wants the money now. The club are called away from the fund raiser.

At the fundraiser the club see Agent Kohn watching them. They still do not know what his real reason for his interest in the club is.

The club and Chuck arrive at a Chinese Restaurant. The manager protests but does very little as Jackson removes a bag of money from the ceiling especially after she is handed a fistful of money. The club are chased by the Chinese. During the heist the Club realise the money is counterfeit. They negotiate and agree to turn Chuck over. They also receive $60, 000. Jackson is uneasy.

Meanwhile Kyle is drinking with the club and misses his son play. He appears to be back in with them but these men never forget a grudge. Opie has already gone back to the fundraiser to set up the fireworks. The club take Kyle into the garage and force him to take his shirt off. The reaper is revealed and Kyle says (in plea for his life) that he tried to have the tattoos removed but could not do it. He is given a choice to have them removed by the club with fire or a knife. He chooses fire.

As the closing credit roll, Probationary Half-sac (Johnny Lewis) cleans up the mess. Kyle is dropped off at a hospital. Jackson reads a manuscript and then looks over at the club from a rooftop. He is still uneasy."

Not so for series one. This episode certainly begins with a bang as club members Jackson (Charlie Human) and Piney (William Lucking) showcase and (after some hard negotiations on price) sell some guns.

Meanwhile club president Clay (Ron Perlman) and Gemma (Katey Segal) are having sexual problems. He makes a comment that upsets her but she forgives him later.

Cherry (Taryn Manning) a crow eater from Nevada arrives. Neither Clay nor Half Sac (Johnny Lewis) are glad to see her. Gemma picks up on both reactions and deduces quickly that the crow eater had slept with Clay. It is not a good morning for her and she cries.

The next scene shows a heist that interrupts a prison transport. The prisoner is freed.

Two federal agents arrive investigating the prison transport heist. Agent Stahl (Ally Walker) is introduced to the show. Clay is taken for questioning. The credits roll.

It turns out that the guns that were sold earlier that day were used in the prison heist. Piney is angry at himself for not realising what the guns were for.

At the police station Agent Stahl and Clay disagree on what he is. Clay thinks he is a mechanic and a motorcycle enthusiast. Stahl thinks he is a criminal and a gun runner. (He is possibly all four but there are not a lot of shots of working on bikes).

Luann (Dendire Taylor) comforts Gemma. The club matriarch is angry not because Clay cheated but because what happened away was meant to stay away not slap her in the face. To make things worse, it appears Gemma is going through menopause.

Sheriff Vic Trammel (Glenn Plummer) and Jackson have a tense conversation. Trammel is angry some of his friends were killed and wants out. However, once you start doing business with the club there is no out. Meanwhile, thanks to help from Kohn, Stahl is able to get a warrant.

Angry after going to get menopause medication, Gemma sees Cherry outside in the street. She hits her with skateboard breaking her nose. Cherry is unaware of who Gemma is and confused at why she broke her nose. Upset at what she has done, Gemma sits down and waits for the police to arrive.

Tara (Maggie Siff) is disturbed to see Kohn in the special care unit with Able. Kohn says he is still hurt. He also says if she wants to see Ables future she can be at SAMCRO in forty-five minutes.

Jackson takes some time out to read more of his fathers manuscript on the roof (voice by Nicholas Guest). Both in prison, Gemma and Clay hurl insults at each other.

The warrant is executed. The Sons are mostly undisturbed. They may have been through this before. Alone in Jackson's room, Kohn becomes enraged and smashes it to pieces (unaware that Tara has actually never been there).

Stahl is happy. Thanks to finding several metal drums (which she thinks they use to transport guns) she may be able to put an end to the MC. She might also have a new romance with Hale (Taylor Sheridan).

Clay is allowed to go home but he chooses to sit outside Gemma's cell. He is sorry and she tells him about the menopause. He tells her that he will always love her but she sends him home.

In hospital, Cherry apologizes to Half-Sac. It is him that she is there for. He tells her it can't work but does let her kiss him.

Nate and his group are disposed in terms of a bomb. Piney is sad but agreeable. Trammel, also sad, is paid for his trouble.

When Gemma is released from prison two people are waiting for her; Clay and Cherry. Clay apologizes and Cherry makes it clear she is not after Clay. A truce is broken between all three parties (although a threesome is not on the cards. Gemma has made that clear).

Tara (afraid of Kohn) asks Jackson for a ride home. The two disappear on a bike together as the final credits roll."

They pass by some construction workers digging up human bones. Jackson notices that they are being followed. After some prodding, Tara tells him that Agent Kohn (Jay Karnes) is an ex who wont leave her alone. Jackson gets right on it stabbing 'tyre and warning him that next time it will be him. He then goes straight to Deputy Chief Hale (Taylor Sheridan) to let him know what Kohn's true agenda is.

Cherry (Taryn Manning) watches Half-Sack (Johnny Lewis) box. She is not the only one. The club looks on and sees an opportunity to make some money. Cherry is going to stay with Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) for a few days as Half-Sac is not to have any sex, drugs or alcohol until the big fight.

Hale finds Tara at the hospital to ask her why she did not let him know that the agent was her stalker. She said that nobody believed her in Chicago. Hale said that Kohn's boss did not know he was investigating in Charming. Kohn is being sent home and will not bother her again.

It turns out the bodies dug up by the construction workers are the handiwork of the club (Mayans in a drug deal gone bad).

One of the mechanics Lowell (Keir O'Donnell) asks for permission to have his child at work. Clay agrees and praises him for his good work.

The depth of Agent Kohn's mental instability becomes clear when he is seen breaking into Jackson's house, urinating in Able's room.

At Bobby's house, Cherry rejects his advances telling him that she is not going to be passed around anymore. Bobby eventually agrees.

At the hospital Clay (Ron Perlman), Tig (Kim Coates) and Jackson go to the morgue in search of the recently dug up bodies. They find that one of the bodies is Lowell's father. Clay admits to Jackson that although Lowell's father was not a patched member and just a mechanic he was actually a casualty of the gangland war. Lowell does not take the news well.

Jackson watches from above, on the roof. He continues to read his fathers manuscript (voiced by Nicholas Guest).

Agent Stahl (Ally Walker) and Deputy Chief Hale tell Lowell the bad news about his father but it quickly turns into an interview as Stahl sees an opportunity to get information from the inside.

Gemma (Katey Segal) sees the damage to Jackson's house and tells him. Both he and Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) go to find Kohn at the barber shop. Jackson throws him through a window but Stahl and Hale are on Jackson's side (this time). He is in breach of a whole bunch of laws and being sent home.

The prospect wins a fight while Gemma worries about Jackson's attachment to Tara. Lowell has gone missing. Clay worries he may have slipped back into old drug use.

He is right. Lowell is upset and tries to shoot Clay. Clay has been shot at many times before (and probably will be again). Lowell is no match for him. Lowell is quickly on the ground and Clay's sympathy has a limit. He tells Lowell that his father was a junkie who treated his family badly. Clay points out that Lowell is behaving in the same way. Lowell wants Clay to kill him and for a moment Clay considers it.

The prospect continues to win until he is told to take a dive for the club. Once he started winning, the club started betting against him.

Gemma wants to know where Jackson is headed with Tara. He tells her it is none of her business.

Clay talks to Cherry who reiterates that she is only there for Half-Sac. He says that is alright by him. When she hugs him, Half-sac (still fighting) sees, gets angry and wins the fight (thereby costing the club a lot of money). Clay agrees it is his fault but the Club must find the money by the end of the week. In the back of van lies Lowell, still very much alive and clearly detoxing. Clay says he kept him around because he is a good mechanic.

Jackson is waiting for Tara. He tells her Kohn has gone. Jackson is afraid that Tara came back because she knew that he would be the one person who could keep her safe. They sit on the step together and nothing is resolved.

Gemma asks Clay where Lowell is. He replies with ""SAMCRO rehab"". He also tells her that they he told both Jackson and Lowell parts of the truth.

It appears the two may know a little more than they are telling"

They have been left there by the ATF.

In the chapel, the club brainstorm ways to make money. It is suggested that they approach Porn Queen Luan Delaney (Dedrie Taylor). Jackson (Charlie Hunman) is excited; his child gets out of the humidity crib today.

Darby meets with Mayan leader Marcus Alvarez (Emilio Rivera). It is a hostile meeting with both sides hurling insults but they have common enemy SAMCRO. Darby suggests they could both benefit by killing SAMCRO. He suggest they take out the club leader first. It is a win win situation. Darby will get Charming to himself while Alvarez gets the gun trade. Unknown to Darby, Alvarez makes plan to kill him as well.

At the hospital Gemma (Katey Segal) and Jackson apologize to each other. Gemma is still uneasy about his relationship with Tara.

At Jackson's urging, Gemma approaches Luann for the money. She is reluctant, having paid her dues by working in the porn industry as an actress. Gemma reminds her that Luan's husband and club member Otto (Kurt Sutter) fronted the money to help her move out of the acting into the producing area. Initially, Luan wants 20% interest but is warned and agrees to 5%. SAMCRO is still short $15, 000. The prospect is told to help.

Jackson comes across a car accident. He helps the truck driver but finds drugs in the truck cabin. Darby has been selling drugs in Charming. Later in hospital the driver confides that his whole load of diesel was stolen. The boys find the truck transporting the load and stage a heist. They offer it to Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) who also owns a trucking business. ""Can you at least pretend I am a cop?"" Unser asks Jackson. He still makes the deal.

Meanwhile the prospect Half-Sac (Johnny Lewis) steals an ambulance in an effort to make money. The club is unimpressed. They have the money anyway thanks to the deal with Unser.

Jackson continues to read the manuscript of father (Nicholas Guest). This time his father writes about how it take courage to move things in the right direction.

Clay (Ron Perlman) meets with the IRA. Their usual contact McEavey is dead. Instead they meet with Cameron Hayes (Jamie McShane). Two gunman burst in and Cameron is injured in the gunfight. They suspect Alvarez. Cameron is taken to the clubhouse. Obviously, he cannot go to a hospital (he is wanted on four continents).

Tara (Maggie Siff) brings Able to Jackson who gets to hold his baby for the first time.

The club wants to take revenge against the Mayans but Jackson does not think they are ready. Clay and he clash and Clay questions his commitment to the club. Clay thinks that becoming a father has changed him. Tig (Kim Coates) is also worried that Jackson may not have courage to pull the trigger anymore.

Chibs (Tommy Flanagan) needs surgical equipment to save Cameron. Luckily they have an ambulance. Tara has equipment that can help the club. Jackson tells her that he is the same guy in the same trouble as he was 19 years ago. He thinks he is the same but that she is different now. Tara disagrees. She said that he loves his son and is willing to let people in; she thinks he is different. He has to leave.

Agent Kohn (Jay Karnes) is there. He throws Tara to the ground. Jackson is outside but cannot hear her scream over the bike. Kohn tries to talk to her but quickly turns into a fight. It is revealed that Tara had an abortion. Tara fights back and they struggle. Kohn is shot in the stomach and she calls Jackson.

Kohn is still alive and hurls insults at Jackson. Quickly realising that the only way to stop him doing this again, Jackson kills him. He then comforts Tara. This turns into something else. The rest of the club prepares for war. Able cries while Jackson and Tara make love. Kohn's dead body lies nearby."

The club try to help Cameron Hayes (Jamie McShane). Chief Unser (Dayoton Callie) arrives. Someone went after Darby (Mitch Pileggi) killing two women in the process. Unser also found two dead Mayans. Club president Clay (Ron Perlman) shows him the injured Cameron explains that the Mayans went after them. Unser, worried about ATF, takes Clay down to the station.

Much to Tig's (Kim Coates) dismay Gemma goes looking for Jackson. She is angry with him, thinking he was getting laid while the club was in trouble. Tig reminds Jackson to not forget his priorities. Jackson tells him that he hasn't. There is a tense moment as Tig refuses to move has foot from Jackson's bike.

Darby's questioning is not going well. He and Hale (Taylor Sheridan) get into a fight and then he makes a racist remark. Unser reminds him that he is married to a dark skinned woman.

Taking care of Cameron is not going well either. Jackson goes to get a doctor.

Donna (Sprague Grayden) approaches Opie (Ryan Hurst). She has been trying to call him and is worried that he will get fired from his job. She says she ca'nt live this way anymore. Opie has had enough. He wants back in to the club.

Clay confides in Unser that he his surprised at how bold the Mayans have come. Unser is worried this will all blow back on Charming. Clay tries to calm him but Unser is having none of it.

""I'm not an old friend. I am an old cop,"" he tells Clay. He also warns Clay that the deal always was that the outlaws lived in Charming but the bad things were kept out of the borders of the town. He then begins smoking a joint saying it was for his cancer. They are interrupted by other SAMCRO members (from other areas) arriving. Clay says that the only way he can stop the violence is if Unser arrests Alvarez so they can sit down with Darby and try and sort it out.

At the hospital, Tara is upset about what happened. Jackson tells her that the situation with Kohn only ended in one of two ways; her death or Kohns. Jackson tells her that it ended the right way. He also confides in her that he had never killed anyone like that before. She agrees that she probably came back knowing that he would help her. He asks her not to go anyway and she agrees. She also goes to the clubhouse to help Cameron.

In the lockup, Darby agrees (after a few punches) to let SAMCRO handle the retaliation.

Tara congratulates Juice on keeping Cameron alive. She tells Jackson that she thinks Cameron will probably make it.

Marcus Alavarez (Mayan leader) is thrown in a cell with Clay. He thinks Clay is there to kill him and is surprised to hear that it is a negotiation. Clay says they need each other. SAMCRO needs money and the Mayans need guns. Clay offers Alvarez the same hardware at the same price as what he gives the One Niners. He says the first bullet that hits a Son or friend of Son ends the arrangement. There is the problem of the revenge. The club will want vengeance for Alvarez wanting Clay dead. Marcus has an idea.

Jackson continues to read his father's journal (voiced by Nicholas Guest).

At the table, the club is shocked to hear Clay and Marcus Alvarez have sat down. However, they agree it make sense and the vote to sell guns to the Mayans goes unopposed.

Tara stays the night at the clubhouse. She wonders if they are crazy but Jackson thinks that question is best left until another time.

Opie and Jackson agree that they both need to prove to their loyalty to their club.

The next morning Tara wakes up and is shocked to see both the aftermath of the club party and Gemma waiting for her. Gemma tells her Tara that she is no old lady and that getting together with Jackson is a bad idea. Tara cries. Gemma tells her that Tara is smart and needs to be the one to break it off. The group carry off an IRA hit to help pay for the warehouse rebuild. During the hit, Opie hesitates and Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) has to finish it. As a result, Opie is seen.

Marcus meets his son (Kevin Aleajandro) in a park. He tells him he is proud of him but does nothing when Happy comes up behind and stabs him in the neck. The debt is now paid.

He hears sirens and looks over across the street. There, porn distributor Luann Delaney is being shut down by eager ATF agent Stahl (Ally Walker).

Club Vice President Jackson (Charlie Hunman) and best friend Opie (Ryan Hurst) talk about the club and how it is family.

At the police station Stahl is making enemies by taking over. Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) is not happy but his personal relationship with the Sons is called in to question. Stahl is smart and she has most pieces of the puzzles already in line. She knows how and from whom the Sons get their guns. She also knows their weak spots and is going to target the women who have the most to lose. When Deputy Chief Hale (Taylor Sheridan) protests that Tara is not one of them, she shows him surveillance pictures and says Tara (Maggie Siff) has spent the last four nights there at the club house. She also thinks that Agent Kohn was right and that Kohn pushed Tara straight back into the bikers arms.

Gemma (Katey Segal) is taking care of injured IRA henchman Cameron (James McShane). He tries to talk about religion but she dismisses him; to her family is religion.

Stahl goes straight after Opie's wife Donna (Sprague Graydon). Donna may be unhappy with Opie but she is no rat and Stahl makes very little headway with her.

Opie asks Club president Clay (Ron Perlman) for money and Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) the treasurer agrees. Both senior club members are worried about Opie. His heart is in it but his head is somewhere else, Bobby tells Clay. The President thinks there is too much of that going around.

The next stop for Stahl is the hospital. There, she surprises Tara with how much she knows about the young doctor's life. Tara isn't initially rattled but then Stahl mentions Kohn.

Stahl and Jackson pass each other in the hallway. It is a very powerful scene as the two adversaries smile each at each other.

Tara is worried about Stahl but Jackson promises her that it will never blow back on her and he would never let her get hurt.

Opie delivers some money to Donna. He thinks that she would happy to have the mortgage covered but Donna is angry especially after Stahls visit. Donna says she is moving out. Opie said that Donna knew he was SAMCRO when they got together and that is how he earns. He does it because he loves her. In a very powerful move he tells her that if she cannot accept it she should keep packing. (I am not meant to put my opinion here but this is the second highly compelling scene in less than five minutes).

Cherry approaches Gemma in the grocery store. She confides that the ATF are after her too. She also says that her real name is Rita and she is wanted for arson and grand theft. Apparently her ex was not that nice. ATF enters the store. Cherry tries to escape and injures one agent before she is captured.

IN the grocery store, Gemma and Stahl talk. Again it is another clash between two powerhouses. Stahl says has Luann in custody. Gemma says all that Luan can tell them is how to give a good hummer and that she thinks Stahl probably has that covered already. Stahl agrees that she does okay. The two flirt with each other but Stahl gets nothing off use.

Surprisingly, Unser is sitting at the table with the Sons. He too has a lot to lose. There is some panic and some members worry that each other's partner may rat. Clay suggests giving them something small but Unser says with a Rico case there is nothing small.

Stahl meets with Otto in prison (series creator Kurt Sutter). She says she just needs something small (Unser was right) to make her bosses go away. Otto says he can help if she can reduce his sentence and get Luann in to see him.

After Jackson drops her off at her own house, Tara is uneasy. Jackson promises her that she won't feel that way forever. She wants to know what they are doing where they are headed. She is worried about what his mother thinks. He asks her if she loves him. She can't answer and he kisses her and leaves.

Tig (Kim Coates) and Piney (William Lucking) start a fight in a bar and then watch with Bobby as it escalates. This is to distract the police. Jackson breaks in to the watch house to warn Luann to tell Otto that he can't mention anything. Cherry is there and she begs Jackson to break her out. She says she isn't strong and will rat. He agrees but as he is letting her go, Unser sees. He turns the other way. Cherry asks if he is the police chief. He admits that he doesn't know what he is anymore.

Jackson looks in on Stahl on the way out and sees her with Hale. The two are very close. Later Stahl is excited because they have witnesses for the IRA shooting. Otto gives Stahl a napkin with a huge amount of incriminating evidence. He tells her to type it up; clearly he wants to protect Luann.

Happy (David Labrava) is leaving to go nomad for a while. Unser comments that he seems nice unaware of the numerous circles on his chest that show the number of people he has killed. Clay tries not to choke. Luan delivers the message. Cherry has told Half-Sac everything. They say goodbye and she gives him a necklace. She leaves with Cameron. The club escorts them; as they leave Jackson and Gemma look on. Jackson gives Tara the peace sign.

In prison, Stahl makes her first mistake. As she and Otto are looking over the documents to sign, he head-butts her two times. She is badly injured and very shaken. Otto laughs and Stahl (not one to be crossed) promises to bury the club."

Downstairs, club president Clay (Ron Perlman) announces that their problems with ATF are over thanks to Otto's (series creator Kurt Sutter) attack on Agent Stahl (Ally Walker). Less than a minute later, the police break in and arrest Bobby (Mark Boone Junior). It appears the ATF have a witness to the IRA murder who can identify both Bobby and Opie (Ryan Hurst).

The club argue about what to do. Tig (Kim Coates) worries that Opie isn't there. He thinks Opie may have turned and is the witness. Jackson and Piney (Opies father played by William Lucking) resent the accusation. At the hospital Gemma (Katey Segal) tells Tara (Maggie Siff) that if she plans to be in Jackson's life, she also must be in the baby's.

Jackson goes to Opie's house and talks to a neighbour who said Opie left in the middle of the night under his own free will. Juice (Theo Rossi) checks Opies bank account and sees that a lot of Opie's debts have been paid off. It is fair to say that the club is worried. Unser (Dayton Callie) is in lock-up until he can be questioned. Stahl doesnt want the police chief interfering.

Wendy (Jacksons ex-wife played by Drea De Matteo) arrives back in Charming looking healthy. She visits Able in hospital and tells a very surprised Tara that she misses Jackson.

Mary (Opie's mother played by Julia Ariola) tells the club that ATF have called her asking her to pick up her grandchildren at a federal facility. This makes the clubs anxiety even worse. Jackson is having none of it. He thinks it is a set up.

Agent Stahl has Opie at a facility used to transition witnesses into protection. She knows what she is doing. Calmly she outlines exactly how she has made Opie look like a rat.

Despite the fact that they are involved, Deputy Chief Hale (Taylor Sheridan) does not agree with Stahl's methods. He thinks the club will kill Opie.

At the hospital Jackson and Wendy reunite for the first time. Wendy has been sober for 64 days and Jackson tells her she looks great. She holds the baby again and interestingly the child acts perfectly crying a little until she settles him in the chair. Jackson and Wendy hold hands while she feeds the baby, as Tara looks on in horror. Gemma also looks on but her expression is unreadable.

Later, Gemma agrees that Wendy can stay at Jackson's house.

Agent Stahl questions Donna (Sprague Graydon). She is strong at first but worries that her husband is going back to jail. Stahl points out that the club could kill him as well. Donna is allowed to see Opie. She initially introduces the idea of witness protection but he points out that most guys end up back in club life or dead (usually by their own hand).

Under questioning from Stahl, Bobby too starts strong but is rattled when he hear the exact details of the crime read to him.

At the ATF facility, Mary outlines to Donna how hard she tried to get Opie out of the club. Even at 16, he kept going back and Donna slowly realises that Opie will never leave SAMCRO.

At the house, Gemma apologizes for what she did to Wendy. She asks her if she still loves Jackson. Wendy says she does and under some duress admits that she wants the family back together. Gemma, clearly afraid of Tara, promises to help.

As they are leaving the ATF facility, Stahl reminds Opie that he could be charged. He is unconcerned telling her that he guess hell see her then. Stahl also questions Donnas ability to be a mother but Donna is strong (albeit scared as well). Her loyalty now clearly lies with Opie. As they leave, the audience learn that ATF has bugs and trackers on Opie.

The setup continues. The clubs lawyer thinks Opie might be back to get a confession on tape (unknown to Opie he is actually wired). At the table, Opie tries to defend himself whilst Tig finds the wires in his truck and his phone (traditionally the phones are left in a box outside the chapel whilst the club meets). Opie says that he is in with the club, no doubt and no mistakes. Clay promises that he is good with the MC.

Tig, as Sergeant of Arms, is positive that Opie has turned on them. He wants to kill him. Clay thinks that a vote on it would kill the club so the murder has look like it did not come from the club.

Jackson is suspicious of Clay and Tig. He has good reason."

Jackson (Charlie Hunman) wakes beside a sleeping Tara (Maggie Siff). He is clearly troubled. Clay (Ron Perlman) worries from bed, while watching Gemma (Katey Segal) looking at her bird, that she loves the bird more than him. She agrees that sometimes she does. Opie (Ryan Hurst) and Donna (Sprague Graydon) sleep with their children between them. Somehow they manage to hold hands. Tig (Kim Coates) kisses a beautiful girl but tells her to go. Juice (Theo Rossi) sleeps on a bar whilst Piney (William Lucking) aggressively (and thats putting it mildly) throws his bed partner out. In hospital a smiling and very beautiful baby Able is told he gets to go home.

At the garage, Tig and Clay agree that Opie's murder must happen today. Clay barges into ATF agent Stahl's (Ally Walker) office and tells her that she is desperate. He tells her that what Otto did to her (head-butting and badly injuring her nose) is just the beginning.

At the Chapel, the club have money worries. It takes a lot to pay Bobby's lawyer and they worry about how they're going to get the guns to the Mayans with ATF watching.

In hospital, Tara tells Jackson they need to work out their relationship for Able's sake. Jackson said that one upside of his ex Wendy was she was too wasted for relationship talks. Tara reminds him that she is sober (which is excellent considering she is currently at work in her job as a paediatric surgeon). Jackson tells her that they need to take a moment to consider what to do or he may lose himself in her because he feels so strongly. Wendy (Drea De Matteo) sees them kissing and realises they are together.

Gemma is hanging a banner when Wendy tells her that she knows that she is using her to get Tara out of Able's life. Gemma tells it doesnt matter what her motive is because they both get what they want. But Wendy is different now; she wants to be a good person. Gemma reminds Wendy not to put her down because in reality she wants to become exactly like her.

Agent Stahl delivers the real witness to witness protection.

Opie and Jackson worry about where the club is headed but Opie reminds Jackson that one day it will be those two leading the club.

Donna (Sprague Graydon) comes to see Opie. She seems better and happier. She even agrees to come to the club party for Jackson's babys homecoming. It looks like she is finally on board with Opie being in SAMCRO.

In the street, Gemma talks to a homeless woman (Olivia Burnette) who tells her about her struggle to raise two kids while having a mental illness. Gemma gives her some money and the homeless woman mumbles something about Able scaring Gemma. This woman appears frequently throughout the show, usually when something serious is about to happen.

Clay meets with One Niner leader Laroy (Tony Kittles). Clay wants the gang to kill as many of the Mayans as they can while Clay will kill the leader. Clay thinks this is the way to get things right between three two clubs. Laroy agrees unaware that he is being set up as the murderer of Opie and the Mayans. Clay tells Tig about the deal. Tig agrees that it is a good idea.

The police realise that the club has found the bugs and probably think Opie is a rat.

Wendy confronts Tara outside the hospital. Wendy is upset that Tara did not tell her that she was with Jackson. She also warns Tara that Gemma will never let her be with Jackson. Eerily, she says that Tara should quit while she is still alive.

The One Niners crash the Mayan club deal. Tig (who was meant to kill Opie in the carnage) is unable to go through with it after Opie saves his life. ATF look on but cannot do anything.

Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) finds an upset Deputy Chief Hale (Taylor Sheridan) sitting in a cell. Hale is torn between his loyalty to the badge and his worry that Stahl may get Opie killed. Initially Hale backed Stahl because he believed Unser was too close to the club. Now he is lost. He begins to tell Unser about how ATF made Opie look like a rat.

Able is brought home.

Stahl has been pulled out of Charming. Hale is worried for Opie but Stahl says it will be all be fine once the true witness is revealed tomorrow. Hale is angry; tomorrow may be too late. He hates the way Stahl moved in, upset anything and leaves. She says ""but we had some fun right,"". The disturbing message is not lost on Hale.

At the welcome home party, Tara feels insecure and sits on Jacksons lap kissing him. He knows it is a show and, worried for Wendys recovery, calls her on it. She leaves upset. Jackson asks Juice to follow her to make sure she gets home okay.

Opie, Donna and family go to leave. Tig is ordered to follow them. He starts off before them unaware that they switch cars. Donna is now driving Opie's truck.

And in one of the most frightening moments of the shows history, Tig follows Donna. Unser fresh with news from Hale about how Stahl has set up Opie, tells Clay the truth. He lets Clay know who the true witness is and how Opie is not a rat. Clay tries frantically to call Tig but Tig has left his bike and mobile phone in the bushes so he could drive an unidentified car.

At the lights, believing she is Opie, Tig shoots Donna killing her instantly.

Opie arrives at the scene and is hysterical as the club looks on and Clay reels in horror.

Unser (correctly) thinks that the shooting was meant for Opie.

Jackson tries to comfort Opie but throws a look to Clay. He knows.

Hale tells Stahl that this blood is on her. She, like Clay, is shocked at what she has done.

In the final moments, Jackson seeks comfort in his son. Mary (Julie Ariola) comforts her ex-husband (Opie's mother and father). Gemma tries to help Clay unaware of the horrible role he has played in all of this. Tig looks up from a mirror which he has just smashed his head against. . Chibs (Tommy Flanagan) and Juice drink wordlessly. Opie cries while his children sleep in a bed behind him. Wendy leads Jackson to bed. He resists initially but then kisses her. Tara lies restless in bed alone.

After, Wendy cuddles Jackson but his eyes tell us that he is knows he is with the wrong woman. He also knows what Clay has done."

In the early morning hours, Jackson (Charlie Hunman) rides. He arrives at Opie's house seeing Opie's mother Mary first (Julie Ariloa). The two embrace but not a lot is said. Outside, Opie (Ryan Hurst) watches his children on the swings.

Opie is guilt ridden. He tells Jackson that Donna knew the gang would bring on something like this.

Club President Clay (Ron Perlman) is sombre and his wife Gemma (Katey Segal) figures out that the club, not the One Niners, organised the hit on Donna. Clay cries and tells her it was meant for Opie. Gemma is sympathetic telling him to feel all of that now but when he goes back to the club he is to show nothing.

Chief Unser (Dayton Callie) and Deputy Chief Hale discuss Donnas death. They blame each other and eventually Hale agrees that he is at fault. He is caught between a rock and a hard place, unable to protect Donna because he could not betray his badge by warning the club. He wants Unser to help him catch whoever killed Donna but Unser himself is caught between the same rock but a different hard place. He wants to be retired but financial pressure keeps him there. He thinks they should let the outlaws serve their own justice.

The credits roll.

Jackson arrives home to an overwhelmed Wendy (Drea De Matteo). Baby Able won't settle but calms quickly in his father's arms. Wendy wants to talk about what happened the night before between them but Jackson tells her it was hard night. She wants more and a second chance but he thinks too much has happened. Wisely, he tells her to put together some time sober and he will see.

At the table, the devastated club meets. Piney Opie's father (William Lucking) is inconsolable. Clay takes responsibility (sort of) because he ordered the One Niner deal with the Mayans. Piney wants to know how the Niners will be dealt with. Clay tells him to wait. Piney is angry because the Niners are not being dealt with; he feels Clay would deal differently if he had that kind of hole in his family. He walks out. The prospect (Johnny Lewis) is ordered to follow him.

At the hospital, Jackson visits Tara (Maggie Siff). Before he can say what he came to tell her, she tells him she is leaving (a very smart move). He explodes and accuses her of running away all of the time, using him to get her stalker killed. In one of the most touching moments in the entire series, he says that he has slept with countless women (hundreds). He says that he married Wendy because he was lonely and that he loves only Tara. He kisses her and tells her to take care. Tara is stunned.

At Jackson's house, Gemma is unpacking Jackson's things. Wendy tells her that Jackson has his doubts about her. Gemma agrees that they all do.

When Wendy leaves, Gemma finds the manuscript.

The lawyer brings bad news, when the witness is revealed, Opie will be charged in the murder of the IRA henchmen, leaving his children without any parents. The club agree to kill the witness and decide to do it before the funeral.

The Prospect rings to announce that Piney is in Oakland in search of One Niner boss Laroy (Tory kittles). He bursts into the One Niner clubhouse holding a gun to a club member's head. Jackson and Laroy arrive at the same time. Piney is eventually talked into putting the gun down. Chatting at the table, Laroy denies killing Donna. Piney, still agitated, keeps interrupting until Jackson yells at him. Laroy points out that if he needed to go to Charming to kill woman, he would have killed both Piney and Jackson on sight. Piney and Jackson look at him in horror. They know he is right.

Meanwhile Clay talks to Sheriff Trummell (Glen Plummer) in hope of getting the name of the witness. The Sheriff needs a case number.

Clay turns to Elliot Oswald (Patrick St Espirit) to get the witness identity. He uses blackmail. Earlier, the club killed Oswald's daughter's rapist arranging for Oswalds fingerprints to be on the knife. Oswald promises to help, having no choice if he wants to stay a free man.

Jackson, now very worried about exactly who killed Donna, asks Unser if knows anything. Hale pulls him into a cell. Hale tells him that he thinks that Clay tried to have Opie killed. Jackson is surprised that Hale is telling him anything. The two went to high school together and dont like each other too much but Hale thinks that Donna's murder is too much for either of them.

Alone in Able's room, Gemma reads John Tellars manual script.

A remorseful Agent Stahl (Ally Walker) talks to Bobby (Mark Boone Junior) in prison. She tells him about Donna's murder and her part in it. She says the U.S. attorney will seek the death penalty for both of him and Bobby and feels guilty about making their kids an orphan.

Oswald provides Clay with the witness location but is not given the knife back. The club make arrangements to take out the witness.

An angry Jackson waits for Clay in the chapel whilst Piney drinks alone. Tara sits in a hospital chair. Opie also drinks alone looking at his MC jacket.

Gemma warns Clay that Jackson knows. She shows him the burnt manuscript and tells him that she cannot do this again, referring to the death of John Tellar. Clay points out the manuscript is half burned and that Jackson probably wasn't happy with it. He also tells her that this is more about her fears. As he walks off, Gemma whispers that he is losing control.

Jackson asks Clay brother to brother, father to son, to tell him the truth. Clay denies it all and says that he loves Opie and loved Donna. Jackson, aware that he is being lied to, goes to leave. Clay warns him that this kind of thing could fracture a charter. Jackson agrees.

Outside Juice (Theo Murphy Ross) tells Jax that the witness is a seventeen year old girl. Jackson leaves to stop the murder. Clay tries to stop him but fails.

Tara stops in at Jackson's house to see Able. Gemma is there also. She tells them that she misses Able and Wendy understands. There is an awkward silence between the three.

At the safe house, Happy (David Labrava), Tig (Kim Coates) and Chibs (Tommy Flanagan) hesitate when killing the girl. Happy offers to do it but Tig says it is on him. Just as he apologising to the girl, Jackson arrives. Holding a gun to Tig's head, Jackson tells him to put the gun down and that they don't kill women. Jackson then threatens the witness that they will kill her if she testifies and that she needs to get out of California tonight (thereby saving her life).

Tig tells Jackson that he crossed the line. Jackson tells him that he hasn't yet and a fight breaks out between the two.

Like Jackson, Piney is doing it tough. He is looking at a gun and then pulls out another copy manuscript. Nicholas Guest narrates as the voice of John Tellar. In a note he tells Piney that he loves him but is afraid for the club and his own life. Alone in a graveyard, Jackson drinks.

The next morning Jackson wakes in the cemetery. He is surprised to see a blanket over him. Clay and Gemma are dressing for the funeral. He has trouble with the cuffs and Gemma who clearly loves him despite everything, helps him. Tara sits in front of open but empty suitcases. Opie is dressing when his mother brings his children in. They too are dressed for the funeral. Opie helps his boys finish his tie. He grabs his MC jacket (cut) before he leaves.

At the cemetery, Jackson thanks the homeless woman (Olivia Burnette) for the blanket. She gives him back his sweat shirt and points him in the direction of cold water.

THE MC club, joined by several charters, arrives at the cemetery. Since he is already at the cemetery, Jackson simply walks over. The funeral has begun. Tara walks over to him. She has his cut and has clearly decided to stay. As a distressed Wendy and Gemma look on, they kiss. He nods to Tara and she smiles. Then, he walks to the coffin places arose, kisses it and leaves. The club is stunned.

Piney finds Jackson at John Tellars grave. He hands him the manuscript and tells him it is time for a change. Series 1 finishes with Jackson looking at his father's grave with Gemma and Clay looking very distressed in the background. Despite the fact that Piney has left Jackson tells him yes."

It turns out the body of a missing girl has been found. While her parents are giving a press conference outside, Patrick wanders into their house, looks around and makes himself at home (he makes a sandwich and some tea). When Mrs. Tolliver comes back into her house, Patrick sits down and talks with her about her daughter's death. He asks her for her opinion on what could have happened and whether she thinks her husband might be guilty. When her husband comes in, Patrick confronts him directly with the question, ""I'm the police, did you kill your daughter?"" Mr. Tolliver is startled and angry from this questioning and starts going on about making Patrick's life ""miserable"". Mrs Tolliver becomes agitated as she realises that her husband is guilty. She gets up, fetches a gun and shoots him several times through the chest. Teresa and the cops come rushing in to find the dead husband, the distraught wife, and Patrick, who puts up his hands and says ""Honestly, it's not as bad as it looks.""

Two weeks later, Lisbon, Rigsby, Cho and Van Pelt (who has just joined the team) arrive in LA to deal with a double homicide which looks like it may have been committed by the serial killer Red John. Patrick turns up as well, even though he's still on suspension for what happened with the Tollivers, and tries to persuade Teresa to let him work the case, because Red John ""belongs"" to him. When Teresa won't listen, he goes over her head and manages to get his suspension lifted. He tells Teresa he will redeem himself.

The victims are the wife of a golf pro and a doctor who was a family friend. The doctor had been hit with a golf-club, and the wife had been cut open on her bed and left to bleed to death, Red John style. A trademark Red John smiley face was drawn on the wall in her blood. Patrick takes one look around the room and says that the murderer is not Red John, because the smiley face is drawn on the wrong wall - Red John always draws it where it's the first thing you see as you come into the room. He says they don't need him, and he leaves. Lisbon and the team look back through past cases and realise that Patrick is right, and this murder doesn't fit the pattern. Teresa swallows her pride and calls Patrick to ask him to come back, but in fact he'd never left and walks in a moment later and meets Van Pelt for the first time.

Cho and Rigsby go and interview the husband, Price, (and his brother, Tag) who had been away playing golf the weekend of the murders. Patrick and Teresa go to the offices of the doctor who was killed (Tannin) and speak with his partner, Dr. Wagner. Patrick asks if Tannin kept a diary, but Dr Wagner says he doesn't think so. As they're leaving, Patrick asks if Dr Wagner will prescribe him some sleeping pills, but when the doctor says he has to have an appointment first, Patrick tells him not to worry.

At dinner that evening, Grace asks Patrick about his past as a fake psychic. We discover that Patrick doesn't believe in psychics or the afterlife, and Grace does. Patrick embarrasses Rigsby by telling Grace that Rigsby intends to ask her to go back to his room with him. Later that evening a note is slipped under Patrick's hotel room door. It says ""Greetings, old friend, it's been a while. I hope you are keeping well. I am thriving and happy. I have 12 wives now and will soon begin courting number 13. Why can't you catch me? You must feel so powerless and stupid and sad. Oh well. All the best. Red John."" Patrick says that Red John would never risk capture just to taunt him, and this isn't Red John. Teresa tells him to get some sleep, but he stays up all night writing in a diary.

Next morning, when Teresa sees Patrick hasn't slept, she makes an appointment for him with Dr Wagner. The ""Red John"" note has been analysed, and some of the victim's blood was on it, as well as one of Tag's hairs. When Tag is questioned, they discover that he was having an affair with his brother's wife, and therefore Price had motive.

Patrick goes to his appointment with Dr. Wagner. In a flashback, we find out about Patrick's past. Five years earlier, he had been on a TV show, where he did his fake psychic thing and was then interviewed about how he was helping the police with their attempts to find Red John. He claimed he could get a ""psychic fix"" on Red John and that Red John was ""an ugly, tormented little man, a lonely soul, sad, very sad"". When he came home that night, he found a note on his door that read, ""Dear Mr Jane, I do not like to be slandered in the media, especially by a dirty, money-grubbing fraud. If you were a real psychic, instead of a dishonest little worm, you wouldn't need to open the door to see what I've done to your lovely wife and child."" When he opened the door, he saw the smiley face on the wall and his dead wife and child.

Patrick doesn't talk about any of this with Dr Wagner. He makes up a whole lot of stuff instead. As the doctor gives him his prescription, he says that he knows everything Patrick said was fiction and asks why he didn't tell the truth when he's clearly in real pain. Patrick says, ""The truth is mine."" Patrick asks the doctor again about Tannin's diary, claiming that someone had definitely said there was a diary and that the cops would come and search for it the next day. He hugs the doctor and leaves. Dr Wagner goes to Tannin's office and starts to search it. Patrick (who took the doctor's key as he hugged him) suddenly shows up in the doorway and proceeds to pull a diary out from under a bookcase. As he's about to leave, the doctor pulls a gun on him and demands the diary. It turns out that it's the one that Patrick was writing the night before. Patrick asks the doctor why he killed his partner (the girl was killed as a decoy), and it turns out it was because his partner was going to expose his financial fraud. Patrick pretends that he's taken the bullets out of the gun, distracts Dr Wagner, and runs. Rigsby arrives in time to arrest the doctor.

The next day when Patrick turns up at work, he find that team is not happy with him for not letting them in on his suspicions, and for allowing them to tear apart the victim's family when he knew they weren't involved. He does manage to make Teresa smile, though, by putting a paper frog on her desk, which suddenly jumps at her and makes her gasp.

The episode ends with Patrick coming home at night to the same house we saw in the flashback, only this time it has no furniture or pictures. He goes upstairs to the same room where his family was killed, and the smiley face in their blood is still on the wall. He lies down, fully clothed, on a mattress on the floor underneath the smiley face."

Patrick and McAllister watch as Teresa and Cho examine the body. They find a stab wound that doesn't appear fatal, no signs of ligature marks, and that the victim's gums are livid and eyes hemorrhaged. They believe she's been suffocated. Patrick informs them that the girl was a local and her death was an accident. He explains that the killer didn't intend for her to die that way. Since the victim was still clothed, Patrick speculates that the killer was taking her somewhere to sexually assault her. She made too much noise at the wrong moment, the killer tried to keep her quiet and smothered her by mistake. After that, she was no good to the killer, so the body was dumped in a place only a local would know. McAllister asks Teresa about Patrick and is told that he was a consultant with the California Bureau of Investigation. McAllister asks Patrick if he's clairvoyant or psychic and Patrick replies that he has no powers but pretended to have them once. A slightly confused McAllister asks him what he actually does for the CBI and Patrick invites him to play a game of rock, paper, scissors. Patrick proceeds to beat McAllister six times in a row. Sheriff McAllister is baffled and somewhat frustrated that Patrick easily selected the winning choice each time.

The team drives down a dirt road to the house where the victim lived. The O'Keefes, the girl's parents, are waiting outside, and Teresa informs them of the bad news. Their daughter Melanie had been found dead. Patrick enters the home and finds Melanie's younger brother Frankie sitting in his sister's bedroom. After Patrick introduces himself, Frankie inquires if someone has killed his sister. Patrick says yes. The O'Keefes talk to Teresa outside and inform her that Melanie waitressed at the Shand Creek Winery Restaurant and that she didn't come home two nights ago. She was scheduled to work until 11:00 pm and they said her car was still in the restaurant parking lot. Teresa inquires whether Melanie had any boyfriends, but is told that she was shy of boys and took the purity pledge in the ninth grade.

While Patrick studies the bedroom, he notices rectangular areas on the faded bedroom walls and asks Frankie when Melanie took the posters down. Frankie tells him after Christmas and that the posters were of boys on TV. Patrick continues to examine the bedroom. He lies down on the bed and notices photos pinned to the ceiling in the shape of an ""H"". One of them shows Melanie with another girl but appears to have someone torn out of the picture. Frankie asks Patrick if he is going to find the killer and would he tell him when he does. Patrick says yes and asks Frankie why he needed to know. He says he doesn't have a reason.

At CBI headquarters in Sacramento, Rigsby and Van Pelt work at their desks when a call comes in from Teresa. She tells Van Pelt that she's faxed over the sheriff's report and asks her to run it through the crime databases to see if there are any matches. Patrick exits the O'Keefe home and walks over to tell Teresa and Cho that Melanie had a lover who she met around Christmas. He says that the person was either too old, too closely related or too villainous for Melanie to tell her parents about and that his name started with the letter ""H"". Teresa says that would explain why Melanie wasn't wearing her purity ring. McAllister joins the discussion and says that he was at the Shand Creek Winery around the time Melanie was taken and that he saw a full-, black truck speeding out of the lot around 11:45 pm.

The team heads to the Shand Creek Winery and McAllister points out Melanie's car in the parking lot. Teresa asks Cho to take it for examination and then joins Patrick sitting at a table with Malcolm Boatwright and Sandra Boatwright, the owners of the restaurant. Teresa begins questioning them, while Patrick samples the food Malcolm has prepared for them. Patrick mentions that one of the dishes has a lot of butter and Malcolm laughs. He explains to Patrick that he looks at food as indulgence and necessity rolled into one. The Boatwrights escort Teresa and Patrick into the restaurant through the kitchen, and Patrick observes a chef accidentally burning himself while cooking at the range. Malcolm stops to scold the chef, and Sandra leads them to the office where she shows them Melanie's timecard. It shows that Melanie punched out and left at 11:25 pm.

A waitress named Raquel enters the office and denies being Melanie's good friend. Patrick tells her that he recognizes her from the photo in Melanie's room. The team questions Raquel, and she tells them that Melanie didn't have a boyfriend. Patrick asks her who Melanie cut out of the photo, but she says that she didn't remember. Teresa tells Cho to let her go and leaves the room to check the credit card receipts. Patrick asks Cho if he could talk to Raquel for a minute and Cho informs him that what he plans to do is illegal and unprofessional. Cho reluctantly agrees and gives him a minute with her. Patrick sits down and talks to Raquel in a hypnotist-like voice, saying that she should think of him before going to sleep and that he would make her feel safe, calm and serene. All of her worries, fears and burdens would be left behind her. He gently touches her knee and tells her that the next time she sees him and he says ""hello"", she will remember that good feeling and will tell him the truth, so that a heavy weight could be lifted from her shoulders. Raquel blows off his comments and leaves.

The team searches Melanie's locker at work and finds a hand-written note that says ""sorry"". Patrick borrows the note, and all the restaurant employees are gathered for a meeting. Patrick announces to everyone that the note was found in Melanie's locker and whoever wrote it was the killer. He goes on to say that Cho was a handwriting expert and that everyone needed to submit samples for examination. Patrick then says that when Cho determines who wrote the note, they will have also caught the killer. Randall, the cook that burned himself in the kitchen, faints.

Back at the sheriff's department, Randall is questioned about the note. Cho informs him that his timecard and boss said he left 10 minutes before Melanie. Randall confesses that he waited around to talk to her. He thought that things were going okay because she wasn't leaving. He felt that since she was still a virgin, he needed to make the first move. He goes on to say that Melanie got upset, rejected his advances and walked away. Randall said he apologized but thought she might still be mad and complain to the manager, so the following morning, he wrote the note and slipped it into her locker. Teresa asked him how long he was in the parking lot with Melanie and Randall said around five or six minutes. This meant that Melanie was still there slightly after 11:30 pm.

Teresa and Patrick agree that Randall thought Melanie didn't leave because of him, when in fact, she was actually waiting for someone else. Van Pelt calls Teresa and tells her that there was one hit in a database. A woman in Fairfield was abducted at a bus stop and woke up in a motel room unharmed, bound with duct tape. Van Pelt also says that the woman was a redhead like Melanie O'Keefe. Patrick speculates that the two incidents are related. He explains that the person kidnaps the first redheaded girl, ties her up, takes her to a motel but does nothing. A month later he kidnaps another redheaded girl, but his planning wasn't good enough and kills her in a panic to keep her quiet. Patrick concludes that the person is new at this and feels conflicted. The person is hungry to do terrible things, but his conscience and fear tell him not to. Patrick asks Van Pelt to check motels within 10 miles of Shand Creek Winery that had a no-show cash booking for the night in question, but Teresa tells her to check for any full- black trucks with known criminals in the Napa area instead.

Raquel enters the sheriff's department and sits down by Teresa. Patrick reaches over, taps Raquel on the shoulder, smiles and says ""hello"". Raquel then proceeds to tell them that Melanie had a relationship with her second cousin Hector Ramirez. Raquel said that Melanie was meeting Hector the night she died and that she didn't say anything before because she was afraid of him. Teresa calls to ask Rigsby and Van Pelt to join the rest of the team in Napa. The team along with the sheriff's department go to Hector's house to bring him in for questioning. Hector runs and Teresa chases him down the street. Patrick is waiting by their SUV parked on another street, as Hector comes running down the road with a machete in his hand. As Hector gets closer to Patrick, Teresa appears out of nowhere, tackling Hector to the ground and subdues him.

Back at the sheriff's department, Teresa and Patrick question Hector about his relationship with Melanie. He tells them that he was supposed to meet Melanie at the restaurant at 11:30 pm but showed up 10 minutes late and thought she hadn't come out yet. He waited a few minutes then drove off because he was impatient and got upset. Patrick feels that Hector is telling the truth. Teresa thinks Hector did it and points to a timeline drawn on a chalkboard illustrating that there wasn't enough time for anyone else to have entered the parking lot, abducted Melanie and driven away. Patrick stares at the timeline for a moment and agrees that there wasn't enough time. He notices Frankie O'Keefe looking around and waiting in the sheriff's department lobby. Patrick takes him to a diner for a snack and asks to see the gun hidden in Frankie's backpack. Frankie replies that he didn't have a gun. Patrick calls Van Pelt and tells her that Teresa has changed her mind about the motels and that she should check on them and call him back with any information. After he gets off the phone, he asks Frankie if he was going to kill Hector with a knife. Frankie opens the backpack and shows him a hatchet. Patrick tells Frankie the story of how he lost his wife and daughter and tries to explain that the hatchet is not the best solution. He then receives a call from Van Pelt about the motels.

Patrick goes to a motel and is shown the room in question by the manager. He is told that the man wore a disguise when checking in and paid cash. Patrick makes a comment about the maid not cleaning the room and learns that the maid only cleans every three days for monthly rentals. Patrick quickly searches all of the cabinets and finds one that has some gloves, a bottle of bleach and plastic sheeting. The manager says that the items are not the motel's property. Patrick realizes that the killer will be coming back to the motel room.

Patrick returns to the sheriff's department to find Teresa smiling at a desk. She informs him that quite a bit of Melanie's blood was found in Hector's truck. They question Hector again and he tells them that Melanie got out of line at one point and he gave her a bloody nose. After questioning Hector, Patrick tells Teresa that he needed to show her what he's found. He takes her to the motel room and turns on the TV. A live video feed from a camera hidden in Van Pelt's corsage appears and shows her putting make-up on in the bathroom of the Shand Creek Restaurant. Van Pelt goes outside to meet Rigsby at one of the tables. Patrick explains to Teresa that the killer plans to bring his next victim back to the room and that they'll catch him when he returns. He goes on to say that the killer is so close to obtaining what he desires, that if given the opportunity, he would not be able to stop himself. That's why Van Pelt and Rigsby are at the restaurant. They pretend to have an argument in front of the entire restaurant, and Rigsby storms off leaving Van Pelt by herself. She leaves the restaurant and begins walking alone on the side of the road. She runs into McAllister who tells her it's not safe and offers to give her a ride. When Van Pelt refuses, he becomes insistent that she go with him and Rigsby races over from the surveillance van and knocks McAllister to the ground. Patrick and Teresa sit in the room watching the video as Patrick's plan unravels.

Patrick tells Teresa he suspects Malcolm because he uses too much butter in his cooking. Patrick said that it shows Malcolm is a glutton and is self-indulgent. Basically, he wants what he wants and takes it. Teresa doesn't believe his theory and leaves to smooth things over between McAllister and her team. As she gets in her car to leave, she receives a phone call and is not paying attention when the Shand Creek Winery van pulls into the parking lot. Patrick is still in the room when Malcolm and Sandra carry in a girl bound with duct tape. They grab the plastic sheeting from the cabinet and begin to cover the bed. They finally notice Patrick in the room. Malcolm is armed with a knife and Sandra pulls out a gun. Patrick is cornered and tries to talk his way out of the situation, causing Malcolm and Sandra to argue with each other. Teresa kicks in the door, shoots Malcolm in the chest and then turns to shoot Sandra as she points her gun at her. Teresa unties the girl and looks at a very shaken Patrick.

Later, the team attends Melanie's funeral and tries to make sense of why the Boatwrights did it. Patrick and Teresa exchange a thoughtful look with the O'Keefes and quietly walk away, Patrick placing his hand on Teresa's shoulder."

Back at the California Bureau of Investigation, Lisbon tells Rigsby that the woman drowned, and the reason they have the case is that she had a head wound consistent with a surf board but her lungs were filled with non-ocean ditch water. Before the group leaves Jane discovers where Van Pelt hid the van keys by staring at her for a few seconds.

Rigsby, Jane and Kang arrive at the spot the body was discovered, having been told the body must have been dumped within a mile of where it was discovered. The fellas have just missed a small lei-centered memorial, and a number of the mourners are still in the area. (Methinks its Mentalism time!)

A couple named Hope and Win approach the guys, asking if it's true someone has killed their friend, Christine. They havent seen her for three days and that she had been dating a Danny. More importantly, Jane finds out from the two that if Christine had been a color she would have been orange and if she had been an animal she would have been a rabbit. (Ummm . . . .) Jane flops down on the beach and Rigsby and Kang decide to roll out.

Lisbon and Van Pelt visit Christine's father, finding out that Christine was very independent and would come and go. This Mr. Tanner is alone with two younger children (Christine's mother was killed by a drunk driver five years ago) and he hasn't seen her for two days, though he waited until the second of those to report her missing. It sounds as if Christine had been filling in for her dead mother, helping to raise the two younger kids. Mr. Tanner confirms that Christine had been arrested the previous year on a marijuana charge but thinks the more affluent surfer crowd she had been around recently had been a good influence.

Lisbon glared knowingly at some booze on the table, and Van Pelt makes reference to the fact Lisbon's mother was also killed by a drunk driver. While Lisbon has Kang look up a few of the names mentioned by Christines father, Jane is building sand castles on the beach with his dress shoes. Seriously.

Lisbon interviews Darlene, a girl Christine had been friends with around the time of her arrest who is now serving time in a juvenile facility. Darlene, who didnt know Christine was dead, tells them she had been hooking-up with an older guy she called ""Pops"" who liked 50's music, ""you know, like Elvis"".

Lisbon and Rigbsy go to a trailer owned by Philip Handler, a slightly older peer of Christine's with a criminal record whose name they got from her father. They find Handler in the back of the trailer, playing chess and drinking beer with none other than Jane himself. (Damn that's good Mentalism.) Jane tells Lisbon he discovered Handler because of the way his hair was braided (duh).

After admitting he nearly killed another woman for failing to recycle, Handler said he never had sex with Christine because she wasn't of legal age. After Jane says he doesn't think Handler did it, Handler tells them he last saw Christine that Monday three days earlier when they had ridden a few big waves with the group including Hope and Win. Having heard the police have obtained a ""person of interest,"" Mr. Tanner shows up at the station with his two kids and begins screaming at Handler, before breaking down into tears.

The coroner reports that Christine's body was put in the water Tuesday morning, so Lisbon thinks the Monday night party several of Christines friends have referenced is ""critical.""

Lisbon and Jane show up at Christine's school and interview Hope, Win, Danny and Andy. After the obligatory Jane question about which animal they would want to be, the kids tell them they hadn't admitted to the party because they had been drinking beer on a ""heinous"" private land on which Dannys father, the owner, is building condos. They group left Christine alone that night to clean-up, with Hope saying she thought Christine had been waiting for someone. It sounds like Danny and Christine were not a serious item, and none of them admit hearing of a Pops.

Jane and Lisbon arrive at the construction site where the kids held the party. The foreman tells them the project has been behind and that a night guard had simply walked off the job Monday night. While walking around the site Jane investigates a huge cement block, spotting on the surface what turns out to be the tip of the aforementioned night guards nose.

Danny's father Dane arrives, and after a few moments Jane accuses him of being the Pops who has been sleeping with Christine, in large part because the music playing in his care fits the profile. Jane continues to contentiously question Dane at the scene, even asking Lisbon to arrest him for statutory rape before Dane punches Jane in the face.

With local authorities scared by his influence in that area, Lisbon and Jane must bring Dane back to CBI. After some initial questioning, Dane informs the group that he plans to sue them for wrongful arrest. When its clear Dane isnt going to confess to anything, Jane gets Christine's friends on the phone and has them meet him at the construction/party site.

The four kids tell Jane they knew about Christine's affair with Dane, and Hope thinks Dane was who Christine was waiting to meet after the party. Jane takes the kids down to the spot where they surfed and gets them to agree to be hypnotized. Under hypnosis Hope says she saw Dane starring at Christine that night from a nearby bluff. Danny is adamant that it couldn't have been his father, but when the others ask how he can be so sure he storms off.

Hope walks into CBI, initially asking if Dane had confessed or been arrested. Jane confronts her with the fact that Dane has an iron-clad alibi for that night and says he believes Hope was making up her hypnosis story to get Dane arrested. Jane and Lisbon bring a tearful Hope into an interrogation room where she opens up about the evening, with help from black-and-white flashbacks.

When the night guard had tried to make them leave, Danny punched the man. This caused him to fall backwards and hit his head, the blow apparently killing him. The whole group agreed to cover it up, but Christine wanted to do the right thing, Hope tells them.. When Christine couldn't be talked out of turning him in, Danny hit her over the head and drowned her in a nearby trough. Hope goes on to say she didn't come forward out of fear.

When Jane and Lisbon walk out of the room, they find Danny waiting for them. He claims he won't let his father go down for something he didn't do, but does not admit to the murders himself. They put Danny and Hope back in the room together, whereupon Danny accuses Hope of killing Christine, in part out of jealousy. Hope admits as much, but says she did it to save Danny. By this point Win and Andy have come into the station and are blaming the murder on Handler. This, of course, leads to Jane and Lisbon putting all four in the room together.

Jane accuses all four of Christine's murder, adding that Hope (the smart one) had made all four take an equal part in the drowning so they would be equally responsible and would not rat each other out. Busted! Lisbon immediately slaps the cuffs on them.

Lisbon tells Mr. Tanner that Dane probably won't serve any time for statutory rape without Christine's testimony. The show ends with her advising Mr. Tanner to get help for his drinking problem, a situation she knows from her own childhood."

Sands's wife and daughter returned home the night before to find the home empty and the office in disarray.

The indignant local inspector assumes there will be a ransom demand made soon and doesn't think that CBI should be there.

Immediately Jane gets a handle on the scene: He tells her Sands is still there, that he was tortured in one of the overturned chairs and made to punch in numbers on a remote password device. Looking at a painting of several yachts, he enters numbers from their sails and the grandfather clock slides back and the body of Sands is found on the floor.

The entire team attends Sands' funeral, paying close attention to the widow, Jennifer, and her conversations with her husbands lawyer, Michael Bennett. They learn that Sands bled to death trapped in his panic room, the result of wounds caused by pliers and lit cigars. Jennifer and her daughter's alibi is that they attended a performance of ""Peter and the Wolf"" that night for which they have stubs. Watching their conversation, Jane thinks either Jennifer is scared of Bennett or is being reassured by him about something which worries her. He's not sure which.

Jane and Cho discuss with Rigsby his obvious feelings for Van Pelt, and Jane thinks all one needs to do to seduce a woman is show her ""love and affection."" Jane bets Rigsby $100 that he can seduce any woman at the funeral and Rigsby of course picks Jennifer. Jane immediately goes to Jennifer, first telling her how beautiful she is, which she tells him is ""inappropriate."" When the lawyer steps over, Jane snaps for Bennett to back off, turning back to Jennifer to say he's not sure what kind of ""hold"" Bennett has over her or what type of trouble she's in, but if she calls him he will help. Several men walk over and Cho and Rigsby have to pull Jane away. Jane, of course, likes how this has gone.

Back at the CBI office, Lisbon and Jane are chewed out by Minelli, who tells them Jennifer has filed a complaint with the attorney general. After saying that he only puts up with Jane because he closes so many cases, Minelli's cell rings with word from the AG's office that Jennifer will drop the charges if Jane apologizes in person at her house.

At the Sands' house, Jane starts by playing dolls with Julie, the young daughter. Jane and Jennifer sit together and she tells him that she does need help, that Bennett had told her at the service that her husband's business was ""a sham"" and that Sands had left them broke. Jennifer tells Jane she will have to sell the house and her husband is being investigated by the IRS and SEC. But Jennifer is convinced Sands would have left her a nest egg, and wants Jane to help find it.

Lisbon and Cho brief the rest of the group that Sands' business had gone under in the past five years, complete with indictments on the horizon. But over the last year he had moved $10 million in cash, stocks and bonds into his personal accounts, and just a few weeks earlier the money went missing.

Lisbon meets with Bennett, who tells her he only handled Sands' personal affairs and had no idea his businesses were in such bad shape. A few week back Sands' accountants told Bennett he had converted the $10 million into cash, and all Sands would tell him was that he has a surprise for Jennifer. Bennett said he now thinks Sands was preparing to flee his legal troubles.

At the office Van Pelt informs Lisbon that Sands money over the past few years came from selling $55+ million of copy paper to a company called ""Happy Landings Entertainment"" in Oakland. The company Sands used to sell paper to Happy Landings is based in Sausalito Bay, the only business he kept under a separate corporate address but Van Pelt doesn't know who owns Happy Landings.

The gang (sans Van Pelt) goes to the address for Sands' paper supply company, and find themselves at the Sausalito Marino docks. They board a luxury boat called 'Princess,' finding it in total disarray. Armed only with his mentalism, Jane backs right into a revolver-wielding young woman. She lowers the gun when shown badges by the others, and proceeds to tell them she is Jason Sands' fiancé.

The Eastern European-accented woman, Adrianna, tells Lisbon and Jane she is a ""dancer and model"" who had been with Sands for two years. Adrianna says they were engaged to be married and that Jennifer knew Sands was leaving her. She adds that she had been searching the boat for the $10 million in diamonds Sands had bought a month ago for the two of them to run away with. She adds that if Sands hadn't been killed she, Julie and Sands would have already be gone. In exchange for dropping the burglary charge Adrianna gives the name of the guys she thinks killed Sands, two nightclub owners, Dieter and Carter, from Oakland who had been having Sands launder their drug and prostitution money.

Cho pulls the men's sheets, telling Lisbon they began as legitimate nightclub and hotel owners but eventually drugs and prostitution became their core business. The two have no known assets and are not attached to an address. Jane corners Adrianna before she leaves, asking about her relationship with Julie. Adrianna tell him she loves Julie and that Jennifer is a cold mother who doesn't really care for her daughter. Adrianna asks Jane if he thinks Julie might have the diamonds.

As Jane goes to speak with Jennifer, Cho finds out that Dieter has put a care and house in his grandmother's name. Jane asks an matter-of-fact question about ""Peter and the World"" and proceeds to tell Jennifer about both the $10 million and Adrianna. An upset Jennifer tells Jane ""I need someone to hold me, please"" but Jane balks at the suggestion.

Rigsby and Van Pelt grab Carter and Dieter and bring them in for questioning. Dieter tells Cho said that if Sands had owned them money they would have it and he would not be dead: ""Somebody got there before us."" Dieter suggests they look into Adrianna, a former employee he calls a ""mercenary bitch"" that made Sands' life hell. Lisbon tells Minelli that Carter has already given them a similar story.

Lisbon tells Minelli they can't hold the two much longer and that she doesn't like Adrianna for the murder. Just then Jane gets a call from Jennifer, distraught that Julie is gone. We cut to her end of the line and a note propped up against a pillow: ""You know what we want. Tell the police and she dies. Wait for our call.""

We're next at the Sands' residence. With Jane quietly studying, Jennifer pleads for Lisbon and the local inspector from the opening scene to bring back her child. Jennifer tells them she assumes the kidnappers are looking for the diamonds but doesn't know why they would think she has it.

Back at CBI the consensus is that Dieter and Carter don't have the kind of muscle to pull off such a caper while incarcerated. Van Pelt has logged into Jennifer's cell phone and when the kidnapper IMs ""I have your daughter, do you have what I want?"" Jane tells them to say yes and that he will bring it to them, claiming ""I know where the money is.""

We see Jane sitting along in a SUV; the idea for him to acquire the phone number of the kidnappers. While Jane is still discussing the game plan, Adrianna hops into the car and sticks a gun in his face. She says she is not the kidnapper, but that she has to do this because ""I don't want Julie to die."" Adrianna tells Jane she is supposed to get the diamonds and call a number so Julie will be released. Using a bag of fake diamonds and his intellect, Jane gets both the gun and phone from Adrianna and forwards the number to CBI, where they trace it to an apartment. Adrianna goes on to tell Jane that she was sent pictures of a bound Julie on her phone and was told if she didn't get ""Jason's money"" Julie would die.

Van Pelt, Rigbsby and Cho bust into the apartment to find Bennett with a gun drawn and a very not-tied-up Julie coming down the stairs outside the building shots are heard.

At the hospital, Minelli arrives as Lisbon tells him Bennett ""is our man,"" that he killed Sands for the money and when he didn't get it kidnapped Julie for the same purpose. Whether Jennifer or Adrianna is the accomplice is still up for grabs. Lisbon tells Minelli that there is little chance Bennett will make it and that Jane has a plan worked out to get a confession.

Jennifer and Adrianna are both in the hospital waiting room, and we hear that Julie is fine. After to two exchange unpleasantries, Cho asks if either woman knows a Wendy who, in his words, would be worth knowing. Adrianna asks if this person has the diamonds, two which Jennifer responds ""diamonds?"" Van Pelt then says Bennett is expected to regain consciousness soon, in case either had anything to pass along to him.

Cho and Van Pelt leave the area, low-fiving each other in celebration of their awesome acting job. Jane had recommended they wait a moment to let scene play out, but when Rigsby walks back to the room they find neither woman in sight. Lisbon and Cho sprint to Julie's room, finding Adrianna kneeling bedside and comforting the little girl.

At the Sands' home, Jennifer runs up the stairs and begins frantically rummaging through Julie's stuff. Jane walks right behind her tell her the jig is up, that Bennett has told them everything. Jennifer is impressed that the police played her and Adrianna against one another, and asked whether the diamonds exist. After Jennifer makes one more failed attempt to seduce Jane, he tells her that he knew she killed her husband when she didn't answer his question about ""Peter and the Wolf"" correctly. The maid took Julie to the play while she stayed home with Bennett and tortured Sands into giving them his ""running-away"" money.

Jennifer becomes irate and tells Jane that she wasn't about to allow Sands to run away with her daughter and that ""dirty whore."" Jennifer couldn't deal with her daughter preferring Adrianna to her. Since Jennifer can't take it anymore, Jane tell her the diamonds are in the chandelier above them, and we flash back to Julie telling Jane earlier that her father had made the room for her.

The show ends with Jane telling the gang he suspected Jennifer from the beginning, based on how good she looked at the funeral: ""No widow should glow at her husbands funeral."" Rigsby blows yet another chance to talk to Van Pelt and the closing credits role."

The car, dead and out of gas, belonged to two local young women who left an engagement party at a bar the previous evening and haven't been seen since. Almost immediately Jane and a bloodhound help the local sheriffs department discover that one of the women, has been underneath the car the entire time and she has been stabbed to death.

The other woman, newly engaged Nicole Gilbert, is nowhere to be found and the CBI team helps the locals begin the search. We find out that unlike her friend Kara, Nicole has had some run-ins with the law involving drugs. Nicole's mother died when she was young and her father had issues with meth. Some park rangers show up to help with the search, and Lisbon has to scold one of them for assuming Nicole has murdered her friend.

Rigsby and Van Pelt meet with Kara's parents, who loved Nicole and don't seem to think she could have killed their daughter. They mention that the two had conflicted over Nicole's fiancé, Jason, who Kara didn't find trustworthy.

After several miles of search, Jane suggests a trick to see if a member of the search party is the guilty party. Cho and Rigbsy interview Jason, who tells them the two did not have a fight, but that Kara had driven Nicole home the previous night because he was wasted. The entire party was videotaped and Paul spent the night on the bar floor.

Jane's trick fails, and almost immediately afterwards the Sheriff gets a call that a crazed-looking Nicole has been found on her hands and knees in the middle of convenience store isle. She is scarfing down chips and drinking a Gatorade while covered in blood and holding a knife.

At the hospital the doctor tells Jane and Lisbon that Nicole has scratches and mild hypothermia, but is worse-off mentally than she is physically. She is in a psychotic state and has no memory. Given that the blood on her shirt turns out to be Kara's, the Sheriff wants to prosecute immediately but Lisbon holds him back, allowing Jane to interview a drugged up Nicole.

After some prodding Nicole remembers they stopped the car because she had to puke, and at that point a man showed up in a car coming the other way. Nicole remembers a rushing sound like water. The Sheriff still likes Nicole for the murder, but Jane points out that since it was raining the previous night the only way she would still have had blood on her was if she had been under cover. Lisbon decides to look in cabins and sheds near the river and a guard is posted at Nicole's room.

Viewing the bar video, the group decides videographer Jason was pointing the camera at Kara a little too much. They also spot a trucker leering at Kara from the background in a hat which matches make-up found in Kara's car.

Jane again interviews Nicole, who admits she has no idea whether she killed Kara or not. Jason tries to come to the room and is hauled away by officers. This scares Nicole. Later while Nicole is sleeping, a nearby piano sends Jane to a flashback, of a mother and daughter at the piano.

Though he fights being brought into custody, the trucker turns out only to be guilty only of creepiness. He had given Kara free make-up from the company he drove for in an attempt to acquire sexual favors which never came. Jane, who takes Kara's MP3 player out of evidence and listens to it during the interview, doesn't think it makes sense that the guy would kill the girl he liked and take the other one hostage. Lisbon isn't sure, but without evidence they agree just to put surveillance on the trucker.

Jane goes back to the hospital and sneaks Nicole out of her room by tricking the guard.

During surveillance of the trucker, Lisbon somehow realizes that the rushing noise Nicole remembered hearing might have been the highway rather than the river. She calls for ranger to pick her up so they can investigate other cabins and leaves Rigsby with the trucker.

Jane takes Nicole to the exact location of the murder and, using the same song they were listening to that night (MP3 players keep records on when song were played), helps jog her memory. Nicole remembers she had to throw-up because Kara had just told her she had been sneaking around with Jason behind her back. When Nicole got out of the car the man pulled up, knocking her unconscious. When Kara leaves the car to help Nicole he stabs Kara several times in the chest. ""Kara died trying to save me,"" Nicole says, ignoring the fact she was unconscious and should not know this.

She was taken away in a truck with a diesel. At this point the Sheriff realizes Nicole is gone and places an angry call to Lisbon, who is investigating possible cabin/shed locations with the Park Ranger from the beginning of the episode.

More memories of Nicole's abduction are spliced with Lisbon trying to get Jane on the phone. We finally see that Nicole prevented a rape attempt with a well-timed groin kick, grabbing the knife and fleeing. Nicole is unable to identify the trucker but remembers his physical description.

Jane passes along the description to Lisbon, but nothing clicks until Nicole remembers that her attacker ""smelled like pineapples."" Jane calls back with that info, and Lisbon flashes back to the Ranger's pineapple shaped car freshener.

Lisbon and the killer draw on each other, both missing and both ending up behind furniture in the dark room. Lisbon has kept Jane on speaker the entire time, so when he asks if she's okay Lisbon has to shush him because his voice is audible in the room. Jane has Lisbon slide her phone into the corner of that room, where he purposely speaks loudly. The ranger fires the last of his bullets in that direction and while he reloads Lisbon is able to move position and ambush him, eventually with the help of the late-arriving Rigbsy.

Using his intellect Jane figures out that the hand, which had the number '43' written on it, belonged to someone in the gaming industry. The ID from Lisbon confirms it is a Jim Myers, manager of a local casino.

Forensics tells us the hand was severed post-mortem, so Jane and Lisbon visit with the victim's family as part of a murder investigation. They learn that that Jim was a workaholic, wore a $100,000 casino chip around his neck and that his son-in-law worked for him at the casino. Rigsby calls Lisbon to say most severed hand cases in the data base involve old school organized crime and punishment for stealing.

Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt arrive at Jim's casino and are greeted by Matt, the head of security. Jane spots a high-roller surrounded by women and chips. Matt tells him the man is Cal, a local whale. Not surprisingly, Jane borrows $100 from Lisbon to go hit the tables.

Lisbon and Van Pelt find out Jim's last appointment of the previous day had a '43' written next to it. Matt tells them it is unlikely organized crime had anything to do with Jim's death, as the casino is owned by share holders.

Jane absolutely destroys the blackjack tables, Turning Lisbons $100 into $250,000 before Matt comes over and asks him to stop since he's been counting cards. As he's asked to leave, Jane tells Matt his second dealer, Alexandra at Table 43, is stealing from the casino using an accomplice at the table.

They bring Alexandra in for questioning, and Cho finds out she's been stealing to help pay for a liver for a dying mother. Alexandra was going to get fired by Jim the day after he was killed, hence the 43 on his hand, but when she came in for the meeting and realized he wasn't there, she decided to go to work. Jane spends his winnings on expensive gifts for the department, buying Lisbon and Van Pelt diamond necklace/earring combos and getting watches for Rigsby and Cho.

The group goes out for drinks that night, where Jane explains his pneumonic device for memorizing cards and schools Cho and Rigsby in poker. Lisbon and Van Pelt give back their jewelry, which Jane sticks (along with most of the cash) in a clothing donation drop-box.

Jim's widow, Ann, calls Lisbon to tell them she's been having a two-year affair with Matt but had nothing to do with the murder. After the confession, Jane asks Daniel, Jim's son-in-law, to get him into a high stakes poker game with Cal. Jane and Lisbon follow Matt home and confront him about the affair. Matt tells them he didn't mention it earlier because he didn't think it was relevant. Moments later Matt follows Jane and Lisbon into his garage where they find Jim's body in the freezer, cause of death being blunt force trauma.

Matt tells Cho in the interrogation room that Jim and Ann were in a loveless relationship, and that Jim didn't care what Ann did. He also mentions that Jim was obsessed with the casino, spending most of him time watching surveillance video of high-rollers. It's also discovered that Jim's poker chip which he wore around his neck, has been stolen.

Jane begins his poker game at a table of gambling stereotypes, while Cho and Rigsby find a high-roller DVD Jim had been watching in the victim's library. While watching the video they spot Jim's daughter, Jessica, arrive late-night at Cal's door dressed in a risqué outfit. Lisbon talks to Jessica, who admits that she and Daniel, a ""professional gambler,"" have been in dire financial straits. Lisbon tells Jessica her father was watching the video the night he died.

Jane and Daniel (who also played in the game) clean up in the poker game, eventually deciding to go head-to-head when Cal loses his chips. Cho and Rigsby talk to Cal after he leaves the game. Cal tells them Daniel lost $50,000 to him in a poker game and had used his wife as collateral. The night Jessica showed up in his room and they had sex as Daniel's payment for the gambling loss.

Back at the poker match between Jane and Daniel, Daniel is almost out of chips. On the last hand, Jane uses a distraction to cut the deck a certain way. The result is that Daniel is dealt four kings, a seemingly unbeatable hand. Realizing he only has the few grand left in front of him, Daniel pulls from his pocket a $100,000 chip (with a necklace hole in it, no less). Jane wins the hand with the straight flush and Cho and Rigsby are outside the door to grab Daniel.

At the station Daniel tells Lisbon that Jim confronted Daniel after watching the tape of Jessica at Cal's room. Jim called Daniel a degenerate low-life and fired him, at which point Daniel got a baseball bat out of his car and killed him. Jane gives Ann the $100,000 poker chip, which she promptly hands to her daughter.

Rigsby and Cho asks Jane what he did with his $300,000 in poker winnings. The final scene is Alexandra, the dealer with the sick mother, receiving a briefcase full of cash."

As the woman walks through town a car pulls out and follows her, chasing her along the sidewalk before running her over in the street.

The woman is next seen in the street with the C.B.I. crew now on the scene. Lisbon discovers that the victim, Rosemary Tennant, was a local VIP (widow of the Lieutenant governor's buddy) and a local investigator tells us they have witnesses who saw the sedan deliberately run her over, adding that she was likely waking home. A few days earlier Rosemary had filed a missing person's report on her teenage son, Travis.

At this point the ""warning"" woman from earlier, Kristina, arrives on the scene, claiming to be the victim's spiritual advisor. Kristina says they had been channeling her deceased husband and that he ""knew this was going to happen to her,"" though he didn't know who did it. Jane is dismissive of the woman's claims to be in contact with the dead.

Kristina comes in for questioning; telling the investigators she had known Rosemary for three years and was charging about $3,000 per week to help work through the impact her dead husband was having on her life. She says even in death Rosemary's husband was impacting the relationship with her two children, Travis and Clara, but cites client confidentiality concerns when pressed for details. Kristina and Jane go at it again, and she tells him she thinks Jane is deeply troubled and is compensating with a ""self-assured"" exterior.

Lisbon, Jane and Rigsby go to Rosemary's home and speak with her boyfriend of six months, portrait photographer Jeremy Hale. Jeremy thought Travis' drug problems were related to the death of his father and tells them he hadn't seen him in about a week. They learn that Jeremy had recently been added to Rosemary's will and that she had scheduled an appointment with her estate planner for a few days after she was killed. Jeremy guesses Rosemary was going to cut Travis out of her will. The boyfriend seems to have benefited financially from the relationship, and Jane suspects the presence of Jeremy pushed Travis away.

20-something Clara, who we were told had already moved away from home, shows up at C.B.I. Clara thinks her mother lost control after her husband died, the time at which Travis began acting out and Rosemary started investing her money unwisely. Clara called Jeremy ""dangerous,"" adding that he had a temper and that she had worried for her mother's safety.

Jane is able to help the group meet up with Travis at a local carousel by listening to a voicemail. Brought in for questioning, an emotional Travis is adamant that he had nothing to do with his mother's death and that the ""dirtbag"" Jeremy had made living at home difficult for him. They learn that Kristina had recently been added to Rosemary's will, a revelations which leads to Jane and Van Pelt arguing over the legitimacy of psychics.

Kristina calls Van Pelt to say she was ""picking up on something."" At her home, Jane and Kristina argue again about clairvoyance, and she mentions both Jane's past as a medium and the fact his family was murdered. Kristina tells Van Pelt she has had a vision of the car which killed Rosemary, which leads to them pulling one out of the reservoir. The car belonged to Rosemary and was frequently used by Travis, though Jeremy would also have had access. A glove used in photo development is found in the trunk.

Back at Rosemary's home they learn that Jeremy has disappeared after a fight with Clara, and that some of her jewelry is missing as well. Travis still claims he had nothing to do with the murder, but Lisbon tells him that his alibi of being at a party does not eliminate him as a suspect. Jane discovers one of Jeremy's portraits, of the daughter of one of Rosemary's friends, a Connie Adams, has what appears to a woman's shoe imprint on it.

Rigsby and Van Pelt visit Connie's home and find her and Jeremy half-clothed and with a can of whipped cream and Connie wearing one of Rosemary's necklaces.

At the station Jeremy tells Lisbon he never drove the car which killed Rosemary. Lisbon points out that Jeremy has a track record of befriending wealthy widows and asks whether he knows Kristina. When confronted with the fact both he and Kristina were recently added to Rosemary's will, Jeremy asks for a lawyer.

After learning Kristina had been added to five people's wills over the past few years, Lisbon wonders whether Kristina and Jeremy were involved in a scheme together. Cho and Jane visit Kristina, who admits to having had sex with Jeremy several times.

Jane tells Clara and Travis he thinks Kristina was responsible for Rosemary's death and asks them to request a séance in conjunction with the reading of their mother's will. Jane says it will provide the opportunity for him to expose her as a fraud. Van Pelt again challenges Jane and his disbelief that Kristina can communicate with the dead, even wondering whether Jane's family could be trying to speak with him from the beyond.

During the séance a ghostly voice asks ""Why, Clara? Why did you do it?"" This causes Clara to leave the room and run upstairs. Jane follows, and a tearful Clara admits she was responsible. We see that Jane and the department were in on the voice trick, using a truck parked outside.

In the interrogation room Clara tells Lisbon her mother was going to change the will again and disinherit Travis. Clara came home unannounced and took the car, wanting to talk to her mother after she met with Kristina. When Rosemary deliberately wouldn't answer her phone call Clara snapped and ran her over. Jane tells Clara he guessed it was her based on an earlier comment she made about the specifics of her mother's death.

In the final scene Kristina shows up at the station and takes Jane into an empty room. Kristina tells him she has spoken with his wife, and that she wanted Jane to know that the night of his family's murder his daughter never woke up and was never scared. After Kristina leaves the room Jane starts to break down as Van Pelt look on from the hallway."

A police officer responds to a report of screaming and gun shots at a seedy motel. He's young and doesn't seem particularly confident. He opens the door and sees two bodies and hyperventilates.

The next day, the CBI folk arrive. The man, Joe Purcell, was a state's witness who went AWOL. Jane sees keys in the dead woman's hand, a gun on a bureau, a baby bottle and what seems like a small baggie of coke. Jane says it's not cocaine. It's powdered milk. He picks up her keys and beeps her car in the lot. She was only planning on stopping by. Jane pulls a baby out of the car. She's alive and adorable.

Social Services comes for the kid and Jane is sorry to see her go. The Davis PD detectives arrive. Detective Blakely is the father of the young cop who found the bodies. He clarifies that the case still belongs to his department.

They think it was Rick Karras, the drug dealer Joe Purcells was going to testify against.

Jane finds a bridal magazine addressed to a Lacey Wells in Patrice's car. They go to the address. Lacey says Patrice lived there. Joe called Patrice, her baby daddy, last night, begging her to bring him food because he was hiding from Karras' boys. Jane wonders why she'd take Kaley. Lacey had been drinking and couldn't babysit.

Patrice always has money when she needs it, Lacey says. They got busted a while ago with Lacey's drugs and Patrice made the case disappear.

Rigsby calls, saying a snitch has a location on Rick Karras.

At the location, the Davis PD guys want to bust in and make the arrest before Lisbon arrives. Rigsby tries to tell them to be smart but Detective Presaido puffs up and charges in. Lisbon arrives in time to cover the PD as Jane, naturally, waits by the car, observing. Of course, the suspect runs out the back. Jane stops him by blocking shut a gate with a cement block. The PD guys come out after BCI have Karras in cuffs and, over their protestations, Lisbon takes Karras for herself.

In the interview, Karras denies involvement. The trafficking case would be his third strike. Cho plays Purcell's answering machine tape of Karras threatening to cut his heart out. He admits he was looking for him, but he hadn't found him. He was with a waitress named Sasha at his bar last night. Lisbon says she'll just hand him over to the Davis PD and he asks for a lawyer.

Lunch arrives, giving Jane an opportunity to talk to Van Pelt about her ratio of ""nice"" to necessary ""bitch.""

Sasha gave Karras an alibi. They were having sex with the TV on. ""And she's confident of the time because it was that Scottish guy interviewing that actress who married the country singer,"" Cho reports.

Jane says Karras isn't responsible for the murders. It's not his style to wait and follow Patrice to Joe. Jane suggests Patrice was the target. She had, as Lacey said, a skinny boyfriend with dark hair that drives a blue car. And she had a supply of money and was able to make a serious drug charge disappear. The description fits Detective Presaido.

Cho wants to talk to him, but Lisbon suggests they go cautiously.

They find Presiado and Blakely. Rigsby notices he carries a .38. Lisbon tells him Lacey ID'd him, they can put him with Patrice. He goes with them.

Jane joins Lisbon, super friendly and eating his lunch. Lisbon lays out their evidence: he gave Patrice money and drugs disappeared from lock-up following her bust.

He says she was a confidential informant. But she wasn't on file and he didn't put in for the expense so that line doesn't work.

He says he was sleeping with her, but paying her for it. He says he didn't know Joe Purcell was the father of her child. Jane offers him the rest of of his sandwich and touches Presaido's wrist. Presaido offers his partner Dale and his partner's wife as alibi witnesses.

Lisbon asks if they can examine his gun. When he hands it over, Jane grabs his wrist again, which makes him angry.

Outside Jane describes Presaido's pulse as ""dishonest.""

They go to the Blakelys. Sam, the young officer, answers the door. He says it's not convenient but his mom comes to the door. Inside she goes on about how proud she is of her two cop men. Jane asks Sam to leave. He objects but his mom runs him off.

When they're alone, mom talks about how upset Sam was when he found the bodies.

Mrs. Blakely calls Presaido ""a straight arrow"" and giggles when Jane tells her he confessed to having an affair with Patrice. She tells him that Dale says Steve has a problem ""down there"" and that pills won't help. She says that Steve was probably lying to protect his ""machismo"" or someone else... She realizes who that someone else was and knocks over her glass. Sam comes in, angry at Jane for upsetting his mom. He asks what Jane told her. She realizes that her son knew. He says that she's got it all wrong, that his dad wasn't having an affair.

Dale drives up and his wife confronts him, saying he promised never to cheat on her again. He tries to hustle her in the house because that is what one does when accused of adultery on one's front lawn. Lisbon drives up behind him in time to see Jane try to talk to Dale and get socked in the nose in response.

At the office, Minelli tells Lisbon she'd better be sure. She arrested Dale Blakely for assault and thinks he might be good for the murders.

He tells Cho he was helping Patrice out. Blakely says his service revolver was stolen out of his car. It's the same kind as the murder weapon. Watching from behind the glass, Jane thinks Dale won't talk.

Sam Blakely stops by. Jane shuts him up by agreeing that his dad is innocent. Lisbon tells Sam the security camera from the liquor store shows a man driving up, it's a guy named ""Q-Tip"" who works for Karras. Lisbon tells Sam that Q-Tip claims he got there after they'd been killed, but saw who did it. Sam can't believe they're buying that. Lisbon says in fact they're not, but they're going to play along. They're going to get Karras to set up a meet with Q-Tip, pick him up and work him for the real story.

She wants him to have a ""quiet word"" with the chief to let him know what's coming, but not to tell anyone else. Sam says knowing the chief he'll want to know where the meet will happen and who they've got undercover. Jane watches like a spider observing an insect stepping onto its web, if the spider were very handsome.

From the office, Lisbon radios Van Pelt and Rigsby in one car and Cho in another and Sam, telling them Q-Tip is on the way to a warehouse in the same struck from the surveillance. Both BCI teams report they can't get there fast enough as they stay put, not attempting to get there. Jane radios Sam, asking if he's nearby, but Sam doesn't respond.

Instead, at the warehouse, he approaches the truck from the surveillance video, pulls out his gun and unloads into the driver - which turns out to be a dummy. The BCI team swarms.

Back at the office, Sam has figured out he was set up. They staged the footage. Sam says he has nothing to say and there's no use explaining. Cho brings in Sam's dad, who urges him to tell the truth. Sam seems to take offense to that. But his dad says it's time for a ""reckoning."" Sam talks: He heard his dad was cheating and checked into it, finding Patrice. He was upset his dad, who preached honor and integrity, is such a hypocrite. His dad lied to his face about her.

So Sunday night he followed Patrice, thinking she was meeting his dad. He thought he was going to catch his dad in the act and busted down the door at the motel. Purcell must have thought Karras had sent him and reached for his gun. Sam had no choice. He had to respond to the call to check it out because he was the closest in the area.

But Patrice wasn't his dad's mistress. She was his daughter, as Jane now says he suspected. He believed Sam when he told his mom his dad wasn't cheating.

Dad explains he learned about her four years ago when and old mistress got in touch. He wanted to tell his wife, but couldn't. She knows now.

Jane visits the Blakelys. She's mindlessly polishing silver as her husband watches TV on the couch. She's slow to answer the door. When she hears it's Jane she doesn't want to open the door, but he says he has something he needs to give her. Reluctantly, he opens it. He's holding the baby, Kaley. Their granddaughter. He hands her over like she's a package.

He tells them she likes Cheerios, napping at two and they should feel free to change her name. Social Services will be by later with the paperwork.

Jane leaves the stunned but happy Blakleys, his good deed of child-gifting accomplished."

He guesses and she says he's wrong. But she's lying. He says that's just the gateway to really reading her mind. She blushes when she's glad he can't.

They get a call about a suspected arson. A burned out barn near a corn field. Jane guesses the victim, Rich Garcia, saved the police chief's life once. He's been crying and he doesn't seem like a man to weep over nothing and he's wearing a National Guard ring. Rigsby, with two years in an arson squad, says it's arson and murder because he finds part of the barn door, locked from the outside.

Jane finds where the killer watched from - a scarecrow.

Inside the house, they meet the widow Susan Garcia and Ben Machado, a real estate agent who was also in the national guard. Jane notices the police chef, Trey Piller, reaching for the widow's hand and her pulling away.

Jane finds the victim's teenage daughter Maddy in the kitchen. She's dark and angry but he tells her she'll get used to it. He wants to know why there are no pictures of her dad and his buddies around the house. She says he took them all down. He asks why she's angry with her mom, which she must be or she'd be with her right now. She says she thinks her mom will get over the death.

A young man named Tommy comes in with corn chips and Susan Garcia explains that he's ""challenged."" Maddy corrects that he's ""retarded"" and asks why everything is a lie with her mother. When Maddy leaves, Jane asks Susan if she knows why her daughter is so angry. He says it's because she suspects her mother's lover killed her father. Susan sputters denials, but Jane doesn't buy it. He goes on to suggest she might have killed her husband with her lover, Trey Piller. She denies it. He suggests that maybe Piller did it on his own. She says they were best friends. Jane notes one best friend had an affair with the other's wife.

Susan says her husband was different when he came back. But she doesn't think Piller did it.

Rigsby and Van Pelt interview Rich's friend Mitchell Reece, the last man to see him alive. He says the fact he was murdered by arson is ""weird."" Three years ago, David Martin, also from same Guard regiment, was killed in a fire.

They race to a scene. Chief Piller's house is on fire. The fire department is on its way. Piller is inside. Rigsby rushes in and seconds later something comes crashing through the bay window, followed by Rigsby, slightly aflame and hauling Piller. Van Pelt puts him out.

In the hotel, Van Pelt rewraps Rigsby's arm. Piller is touch and go at the hospital. Rigsby is feeling OK, on some pretty sweet pain killers. Piller had sedatives in his system and the fire was set with sophistication.

Cho visits Susan, asking why she didn't mention David Martin's death. She said it was an accident, started by a cigarette, they had to bury his ashes. David was in business with Rich. They bought some land. Tommy Olds lives up there now as a caretaker. Ben Machado is the only partner still standing.

Jane and Lisbon visit Tommy in his trailer. He says he keeps an eye out. He has a picture of David Martin on his wall. He says he's the only one who never made fun of him. Jane finds a copy of Moby-Dick in the trailer. Tommy had a burst appendix when Martin died.

Jane explores the land and finds an area fenced off with a Mar Verde sign out front. There are lots of lush plants in the middle of an arid field. It's an aquifer, a source of ground water. Worth millions.

Still hopped up on pain meds, Rigsby tells Van Pelt there's something he's been meaning to say. He confesses his love and she responds by sticking her fingers in her ears and humming. She tells him there are rules and one of them would have to leave the unit and she's junior agent and... she looks over and he's out cold.

Cho and Van Pelt check on Machado, who greets them by firing on them. He stops when they ID themselves. Cho finds six jugs of the accelerant used in the fires in his barn.

Cho and Rigsby talk to Machado, who thinks someone is trying to kill him since he's the last owner left. Jane interrupts as Cho is asking who would benefit from the other three being dead. Jane has a guess: Dave Martin. Ben says he's dead. He's sounds awfully sure, which makes Jane think Ben had something to do with it. Jane says Dave went to them with great news about the land, but they wanted what he had. Jane says someone smart and determined is after him. Jane tells the team to let Machado go.

Lisbon doesn't like Jane giving orders and doesn't want to use Machado as bait for the murderer. Jane says justice dictates that Machado suffer, so bait seems about right. She lets Machado go, but says if he gets hurt, it's on Jane.

He pauses and then tells Lisbon that when he catches Red John he's going to cut him up into tiny pieces and make him suffer like he did to Jane's wife and child. Lisbon tells him if he tries to do harm to John when they catch him, she'll try to stop him. Jane is as easy and polite as always but unconcerned by the warning, calling her bourgeois in her law enforcement applications.

Cho and Rigsby watch Machado. Rigsby suggests maybe Mitchell Reece is Dave Martin. He had burn scars and might have been wearing a wig. He's the one who first mentioned David Martin and he owns a gas station. They leave Machado's.

As they yank on Mitchell's hair (it's real) at his station, Machado creeps out of his house with his rifle and inspects his barn. Once he's inside, the door is thrown shut behind him. He sees someone pouring liquid on him from above. He looks up and a man with a mask on holds a lighter over him and holds up the firing pin from Machado's rifle. He says he's the man Machado tried to kill. Machado guesses Dave Martin. The man sounds suspiciously like Patrick Jane.

He asks Machado why he didn't just ask for money if he needed it so badly. Machado says they begged him to leave, but he refused. The masked man reveals himself. It's Jane. With a tape recorder. He has about two seconds to be pleased with himself when Machado spies a nearby machete, explaining that he'll say he killed an intruder in his barn. Jane makes him pause by flicking his lighter and reminding him he's presumably doused in a highly flammable liquid when another growling voice comes from outside, calling for Machado and asking if he's ready to die. Jane has nothing to do with it. He peers through the barn slats in time to see the flaming object being thrown at the door.

The barn goes up quickly as Jane climbs up to safety, helping Machado.

Rigsby and Cho return to see them running around the back of the barn, safe. He asks where they were and Cho says they called it in, but Lisbon didn't know Jane was about to pull an idiotic stunt. No hard feelings. They re-arrest Machado and Rigsby sees someone lurking in the distance. He races after him as Jane catches his breath.

Cut to interrogation, where Cho is talking to Tommy. He would like some of his ""super favorite"" soda root beer. He says he doesn't like to burn things.

Observing him, Lisbon says all the evidence points to him but the fires were to sophisticated to be him. He's wearing velcro sneakers. She thinks he might have had a partner.

Jane wants a minute with him. He tells Tommy that being a fool gives him power, like a wizard's cloak of invisibility. He doesn't know what Jane's talking about but he likes wizards. Jane uses a Moby-Dick analogy, saying it's like when Ahab got the whale, but the ""Pea Pod"" went down anyway. Tommy corrects him: Pequod. Tommy pauses then tries to cover. He likes whales.

Jane says he should have known it was him. When he met Tommy at the wake, he was wearing a black t-shirt with a skull with devil horns. Something only an idiot or a brazen killer confident in his disguise would do. Jane tells Tommy to come out. He can see him.

Tommy settles back in his chair, his face relaxing and asks him, clearly, ""What do you want to know?""

He explains he did the Tommy act when he was 18 after he got caught jacking a car. It protects him. He figured out what they'd done to Dave, his friend who never made fun of him. He says they deserve what they got. It was ""redemptive.""

Before Jane leaves, Tommy asks him to tell Maddy Garcia he's sorry for hurting her.

They break the news to Maddy and she yells, saying she'll set Tommy on fire if she ever sees him. Jane notes that Tommy killed her father out of revenge because her father killed a man. ""Revenge is for fools and mad men,"" he tells her. She knows that, and it matters to her, Jane says. Then he asks mother and daughter to hug. They do so reluctantly. Scurrying out, he asks them to hold the pose. ""It'll make Lisbon and me feel like we actually made a difference.""

Outside, Lisbon says to Jane that it seems like the case made a difference to him, changing his mind about revenge. He says that was all nonsense and then he runs out into the rain."

A man introduces ""one of the nation's leading cosmonauts,"" Alex Nelson. A blonde glares from the audience as Alex kisses another blonde before taking the stage. Alex takes the stage and takes a drink of water. But then he gets woozy and collapses. The angry blonde walks out with a purpose.

At CBI, Jane gets a call from Sophie Miller. After some hesitation, he takes her call. He's intrigued by what he hears. He asks Lisbon for a favor.

Sophie, the angry blonde, is interviewed by police. Alex's water bottle had poison on it. She's being interviewed. She's his ex-wife. She's made death threats against him and was arrested for assaulting him. But they got past it for the sake of their work together.

Lisbon worries about Jane's personal interest, but he says she didn't do it - she told him so. (A mentalist always knows.)

Lisbon explains that CBI can be lead agency because Leyland is a state university. An officer brings in something that was posted around campus condemning Alex for having the blood of innocent animals on his hands.

Chancellor Stern visits Minelli, worried about the security of another scientist testing on animals, Prof. Stutzer, leader of the university's flagship institute.

Lisbon demands answers from Jane about Sophie. She was his doctor - his psychiatrist, a good one. In a locked room. He ""did a little time in a hospital."" It's not on his record.

Van Pelt looks into various animal rights groups. Security tapes show nothing. Lisbon and Jane visit Stutzen. His attractive young teaching assistant struggles to find words to describe Alex, calling him ""a good, good man.""

They asks Stutzen what he does. He says they're curing evil, banishing the devil. They've found the area of the brain that controls good and evil. He shows them his test chimps. They recalibrated one's ""morality center"" and now Suzy's cheery and nice. He's not intimidated by the animal rights groups. Also, he keeps a gun in his office, he shows them.

They've moved onto the first stage of testing on humans. He shows them a lab where a man answers a series of questions while monitored.

Sophie catches up with them outside. Lisbon excuses herself.

Jane says he's been doing well. She left clinical practice and went into research. She's drawn to ""controlling, but damaged and emotionally-unavailable men."" She saved his life, but she's innocent, so why does she need his help? Maybe she just wanted to see him again, she says coyly.

From the security camera footage, they get a van with a college sticker which they trace to a dude whose in an animal rights group. They're quickly swarming with place with SWAT.

They find a guy in a tank cop in the basement, surrounded by cats. A criminal mastermind, he's not.

He tells Cho all his plans. He's going to kill Stutzer, but first he needs to feed his cats so they don't pee on his computer keyboard. He explains that the world is ruled by insects, his tinfoil hat apparently at home for the day.

Lisbon and Jane talk to the widow, Emily. She's struggling over deciding funeral arrangements. They were newlyweds. She says work had been hard. Jane finds a picture of them on the beach that intrigues him. She didn't understand Alex's work at all. She heard him shouting in his office a few weeks ago. He was on the phone with someone and she thinks she heard the name ""Rosie."" Jane tells Emily to take a vacation when this is all over. He bosses her, then tells her to resist her impulse to fall for control freaks, to which she spinelessly agrees, proving his point.

Outside, neither think Emily has what it takes to kill anyone. Jane says they should talk to the lab assistant, Carrie. In the photo he was admiring of Emily, he noticed she had dark hair, but has since dyed it blonde to look like Sophie. Carrie also had dyed blonde hair, ergo, she was having an affair with Alex.

At Carrie's house they knock but get no answer. They find her slumped in a chair inside, a bottle of poison next to her. A note says ""Forgive Me.""

The coroner says her pink color indicates cyanide, the same poison that killed Alex. They find a ripped up photo of her with Alex, cuddling.

Lisbon doesn't think it's a suicide. The note was too brief, women like to explain themselves. But it couldn't be the widow. Which leaves Sophie.

Sophie observes a woman answering ethical test questions. She explains how she can run a current through the test subject's brains to get answers opposite to human instinct. Jane gets geeked about the experiment, chatting up Sophie, but Lisbon is all business, wanting to talk in private.

Sophie tells Lisbon that Carrie told her she was having an affair with a married man, but she didn't know it was Alex. Lisbon asks her who ""Rosie"" is. In the background of the office, the chimp goes a little nuts.

Flashback to Sophie counseling Jane in the metal hospital, tenderly.

He asks Lisbon to leave and he asks Sophie again about Rosie. It's not a person, it's a chimp. He guesses that Sophie switched Rosie for Suzy, because Suzy never did get docile. They've been fabricating their evidence for a year now. She didn't want to disappoint Stutzer. Alex was going to confess that morning. She begged him not to. He thinks she killed him and Carrie to cover it up and asked him to investigate because she thought she could manipulate him. He says if she had anything to do with the murders now is the time to get on a plane to Brazil and walk away. Flash to them saying a sweet (but kiss-free) good-bye in the hospital. She says again she had nothing to do with the murders.

Jane calls Minelli and, as Minelli says it's a crazy idea and no no, Jane tells the team that he says go for. Cut to Sophie racing to find Stutzer and telling him the morality experiment works. She brings him back to the lab, where Jane is hooked up to the machine and Sophie is saying she successfully recalibrated his brain. She fiddles with the computer, demonstrating a baseline answer. He responds accordingly. Then she makes him ""evil"" and he responds evilly. Stutzer is thrilled that it works and says they have to call the Chancellor. He arrives and they demonstrate again. They exalt as Jane gets up and walks away, but Sophie says she hasn't made him un-evil. They follow him, trying to tell him they need to fix him. He goes to Stutzer's office, followed by Sophie, Stutzer and the Chancellor. Jane locks it down and gets Stutzer's gun. He asks Stutzer a test quesiton: Who killed Alex and Carrie? Stutzer says he doesn't know.

Jane turns the gun on Sophie, winks, and shoots her. She slumps to the floor, bloody, as the CBI team calmly enjoys lunch in the other room.

Jane asks Stutzer again, threatening to kill the Chancellor if he doesn't answer. Stutzer sputters. Just then the Chancellor confesses. He was trying to protect Stutzer. They can find the poison in his basement. He did it to protect the university, whose finances are tied to the Stutzer Institute. Jane unlocks the room.

He welcomes in Lisbon telling her the poison can be found on the top shelf in the basement. And Sophie can get up now. She does. The Chancellor sputters that the ruse is inadmissable. True, but they have teams at his house with a search warrant at that moment. ""I'd hate to be a state's attorney, Jane's always pulling crap like this on them,"" Lisbon says. ""But they always win. In the meantime, you're under arrest.""

Jane seems to be having a blast, but Stutzer realizes the truth. The engine doesn't work.

Jane and Sophie chat. He asks her not to call him if another ex-lover turns up dead. They're even. She's ruined as a scientist, so she'll probably go back to helping people. He kisses her good-bye. On the cheek. Lisbon, waiting in the car, teases him when he comes over.

But she seems him looking glum and offers to let him drive. She hates when he drives. He drives too fast, but he's touched that she's willing to overcome her irrational fear to cheer him up. Seeing that her gesture has been picked apart, Lisbon starts the engine. ""Never mind."""

On the other side a man sits, naked on a bed, crying, next to a dead woman.

Cut to dapper Patrick entering a men's prison. He's visiting the man we just saw weeping on the bed. He says he has information about Red John, the man who killed Patrick's wife and children. He says if Patrick gets him out, he'll give him Red John. Weeping Man is accused of raping and killing his housekeeper's daughter. The door was locked from the inside, there were bars on the windows. His last appeal has run out. Patrick decides he won't help. Then the man says that Red John painted Patrick's wife's toenails with her own blood. The police never released that. He promises to tell Patrick more if he gets him out. Deal.

Minelli tells Patrick no. Unequivocally and several times. Patrick says he understands, lying through his teeth.

Lisbon reiterates the facts of the case. Patrick says he has to take the chance the guy isn't lying. Lisbon makes him a deal: he'll call when he gets in trouble. She tells him not to use his CBI card.

Patrick visits the mansion to speak with the brother of Weeping Man, aka Jared. He tells the brother, confusingly called Gardner, that he can prove Jared is innocent to get in the door, then admits he was lying. The brother thinks Jared is guilty.

Patrick strolls off to chat with the mother, who lives in the guest house. She tells Patrick her son was egotistical but fun, if a bit out of control in his youth. Mom shows Patrick where the murder happened. The housekeeper, mother of the dead girl, doesn't work for the family anymore. Patrick asks for her address. He notices a camera set up in the closet. He examines the locked door.

The police show up, telling Jane he's an intruder and asking him to leave. Mom returns with the housekeeper's address just in time to admonish Gardner for freaking out and to politely say good-bye to Jane.

Back at CBI, Minelli is upset Jane bothered the richies. He tells him to leave the case alone, which of course Jane won't do, despite not having any evidence that Jared is innocent. He has some pieces he's piecing together, mentalist-style.

Minelli tells Jane if he pursues it any further he'll have to throw him out of the CBI, which he very much doesn't want to have to do. Jane makes it easy for him. He quits.

The team looks at Lisbon all weepy-eyed. They want to to help him when he needs them. Lisbon thinks Jared's a conman. Van Pelt shows Lisbon Jared's possible connection to Red John. Jared shared a cell 10 years ago on a drug charge with a man who claimed to only be a murder accomplice. That man's dead now, conveniently. Lisbon says if she weren't ordered to stay away from the case, she'd tell them to look into the dead inmate.

Minelli strolls in suspicious. He asks Van Pelt what she's doing and she's incapable of lying and 'fesses up. They all cover for each other, saying one had no idea what the other was doing. He says he'll suspend them if they keep helping. Lisbon suggests he suspend them already because they're going to keep helping Jane. He grants their wish, in a snit.

She follows him into his office where he tells her he'll be visiting his sister in Hawai for a week, during which time the suspension paperwork will sit on his desk. Do they understand each other?

Jane sits alone, bumming in death memories. Lisbon calls him in. He reports that Jared said he would never hurt the girl, but her mother said Jared was stalking her. But Jane couldn't find housekeeper mom. Gardner the misnamed brother had motive, because of a morality clause in the family trust. But why not just kill Jared then? Van Pelt tracks Housekeeper Mom online. She changed her name and bought a condo, according to a secure IM Van Pelt received from a ""Dr. Joe, N.H."" or, letters rearranged, ""Red John."" Suddenly, Jane is IM'ing with the man who killed his family. He tells Jane to keep up the good work. He's tapping into the DOJ secure network. Jane figures that Red John wants him to succeed so he can get to Jared once he's out. Jane likes the idea of Jared-as-bait.

Jane and Lisbon visit renamed Housekeeper Mom, at her spiffy condo. Jane lies his way into the door, and then tells her her guilt and shame won't go away until she tells the truth.

Housekeeper Mom says she doesn't know who killed her daughter, but Jane says she got paid for her silence. He badgers her, saying that he knows Jared was her daughter's lover and she was paid to say that they weren't. She admits it, but says she doesn't know who paid her. A PI visited her. But he's dead, they find. Hit by a bus.

Jane has a Plan B, but Lisbon's not going to like it.

Back at the mansion, Jane lays out a demonstration in the hallway outside the crime scene. Rigsby goes inside and the locks the door, leaving the old timey key in it. Jane pokes something through the lock and the key pops onto newspaper below, which he uses to slide the key under the door from inside to outside. Fishing line gets it back in the other way. Gardner, his wife and Mom watch.

Then Lisbon suggests that for the right amount, they'll drop the whole thing. They are, she says, ex-state agents. Gardner objects, Mom appears to be deciding. They give a 4 p.m. deadline.

Back at the office, they stew, worrying their careers might be over.

Jane gets a call.

He goes to visit Mom. He tells her only a guilty person would respond this way to such naked extortion. Jane recaps the facts, including that her husband died a week after the murder, and the housekeeper left shortly thereafter. Jane guesses: She got rid of her because the victim was her husband's daughter. The victim was Jared's half-sister. (Pause for gross.) Mom tried to make him stop, but she didn't tell him why.

She takes out a vial of the girl's blood.

Flashback to that night, someone using Jane's key trick to get into the locked room. Mom. She took the vial of blood so that she could confess and free her son when the time was right, after he'd learned his lesson. Always listen to your mother. (And, as a side note: Don't sleep with your half-sister.)

Two Weeks Later Jane's excited to pick up Jared and get him in a safe house to draw Red John out. Jared says he'll tell him everything, as soon as they get out of the parking lot. They put a bullet proof vest on Jared. In the car, they're stopped by picketeers. Jared contemplates for a few moments and then throws his hot coffee in Cho's face and runs from the car. They chase him, but he's gone.

Back at the office, they try to figure out how to get to Jared before Red John does. Jane's cell phone rings. It's Jared, calling from a Mexican hotel room (where he's already gotten a hooker). Jared thinks he's safe and his friends will get word to Red John that he didn't rat. Jane thinks Jared has no idea what's coming. He hangs up, with a ""vaya con Dios."" Jane gets off the phone as they trace. He says Jared was calling from a hotel room in Tijuana with a hooker, to wit: He wouldn't call unless he thought he was out of their reach and the background music said Mexican city. Also, he wouldn't have a phone, so it had to belong to someone. Van Pelt traces the call. The phone belongs to a Mexican hooker.

They trace the phone to the hotel. They bust in hours later. They're too late. Jared and the hooker are dead. Red John's trademark smiley face adorns the wall.

Jane realizes that Red John is more powerful than he thought, that he's been ahead of him the whole time. They try to figure out a clue left on the wall in blood by Jared: ""He is Man"".

The hooker's phone rings. Jane answers and hears heavy breathing and then cackling, a murderer rubbing it in."

He's missing and his shoe was recently found. They're thinking murder.

Jane sees some young teens watching on a nearby curb. He waits outside, playing for the kids, tossing a rock in the air. He notices one of the boys rode a pink bike to the scene, meaning he was in a hurry to get there. He doesn't have to tell Jane where Cody is, just look in the general direction. The kid glances.

Jane grabs the CBI-ers and off they go into nearby woods. They find the body at the base of a tree with candles around him and a star made out of wood. Jane says it means black magic and sacrifice. There may be no such thing, but somebody disagrees.

Lisbon talks to the parents while Jane listens. They last saw him Friday night at his football game. As the dad is talking the brother, Brad, storms off. The dad says Cody made some ""mental errors"" during the game. When Cho mentions black magic the family immediately mentions a girl named Tamzin Dove who claims to be a witch. She thought Cody stole her cat and said she put a spell on him.

Van Pelt reports that Cody died Saturday morning and likely wasn't killed where he was found. She and Rigsby go talk to the football coach.

Lisbon, Cho and Jane visit Tamzin's house, where Cho is taking the witch thing very seriously.

The coach says Cody was a good good, but had a ""shameful"" game. Van Pelt cites the coach's record, which includes smacking kids who needed an ""attitude adjustment."" Van Pelt, the coach's kid, impresses with some on-field analysis. Rigsby only finds her hotter.

In Cody's locker they find bloody clothes.

With a warrant called in, Jane and co. break into Tamzin's house. Cho, the big 'fraidy cat, insists that Lisbon go first. They find Tamzin waiting calmly inside.

She was expecting them. Jane is delighted when she calls herself ""the only witch in town.""

She says her friends told her about the witchy items found with the body. Her friends the kids. They were in the woods picking herbs for her. She sells Wicca healing powders on the Internet.

She says Cody deserved to die; he stole and tortured and killed her cat. She admits putting a killing spell on him. She's done it several times before, but this is the first time it worked she says, pleased.

The coach explains to Rigsby and Van Pelt why his blood was on Cody's clothes, Cody went after him. He calls Cody ""a freaking nutbag.""

Coach tells them to talk to Cody's friend, Daniel Brown, who he supposedly beat to a pulp recently.

At night, in the darkness, Tamzin works a spell on Cho as Jane and Lisbon look on, tickled. She says Cho will kneel before the king of beasts. Nothing happens. She says the stuff the killer left with Cody's body was obvious misdirection. As they leave, Cho lingers, disturbed.

The next day, he tells Rigsby about it, and he agrees it's scary ""if you're a 12 year old girl at her first sleep away camp.""

They intercept Daniel Brown outside school and he runs. As they're handcuffing him, Cho sees a carpet cleaning company van with a lion (the king of beasts) trademark drive by. He's on his knees. Spooky.

At HQ, Rigsby asks Daniel about his fight with Cody. He says it was nothing. He trash talked Cody over some drinks and a game of cards. Jane interrupts. He feels Daniel's pulse while he tells Jane what it was he said to make Cody mad, trash talk about his parents. Jane asks him how much the Elkins paid him for his silence. Got him. $1,000.

Jane and Cho visit Cody's parents again to ask about Cody's anger issues. Jane asks to use the bathroom and ends up in the garage with the younger son. He endears himself to the kid by saying monkeys could play football better than jocks.

Mr. Elkins admits paying off Daniel. He wonders where Jane has gone off to.

In the garage, Jane asks Brad why Cody killed Tazmin's cat. Brad says he doesn't know that Cody did, but if he did, did he deserve to die?

Mr. Elkins interrupts, telling Jane he's not allowed to speak to his son without his permission. ""Well, that's a little weird and controlling, but OK. Do you mind if I speak to your son?"" Yes, he does.

Waiting outside the Elkins' house later that night, Rigsby and Van Pelt argue over stakeout food choices. Brad hops on his bike. They follow. He goes to Tamzin's house.

Jane suggests they wait 10 minutes and then go in, letting the plot inside develop.

Rigsby doesn't mind witchcraft. ""It's just a silly alternative lifestyle, like Star Trek or yoga.""

Inside, Tamzin leads some sort of ritual with kids. Brad is laid down on a table, blindfolded. She holds a knife over him, prepared to plunge. She raises it over her head but then dips it in her goblet and flicks some liquid over Brad while the kids chant. She raises it over her head again and VP and Rigs bust in. Brad doesn't seem like someone being rescued at all, asking why they're busting in. He likes it there, where he feels safe.

At HQ, Jane reads ""Tamzin Dove's"" file. Her name is Sara Jane and she's from Jersey.

Brad has been an apprentice in her coven since last August. Brad's mom threatened to kill her if she ever spoke to him again. They were conducting a cleansing ritual.

Rigsby tells Lisbon, watching from the viewing room, that Brad killed his brother. He's found hospital reports that cite ""rough housing"" as the cause of Brad's injuries.

Brad denies his brother hurt him. His parents arrive. Jane wants to talk to them first.

He thinks it's strange that neither of them told them about the connection with Tamzin. They were disturbed and a little embarrassed by his fascination, they say as Brad sits next to them. They're incredulous that they haven't charged Tamzin yet. She's being helpful they say. Jane tells them that Tamzin has put a spell of revelation on the murder weapon, which they still haven't found. It should turn up.

Jane warns Tamzin to stay away from Brad for a while.

Lisbon asks Jane, as is their custom, just what exactly is going on. They prepare for a stake out.

Mr. Elkin leaves his house, driving into the woods where Cody was found. He comes up with the murder weapon, a wrench. Lisbon and Jane interrupt him. Catching him red handed.

Back at HQ, Jane gloats that the murder weapon has been found, according to the spell. He knew it was Mr. Elkins when Brad said he felt safe at a witch's house. Safer at a witch's house than at home. He accuses Mr. Elkins of abusing his wife and sons for years. He guesses that Cody must have tried to protect Brad.

Flash to Cody trying to stop his dad and his dad totally losing it.

Mr. Elkins tells Jane that Cody hit him, he was defending himself. Jane walks out.

He sits with Brad and Mrs. Elkins.

Later, he burns something in the sink. He tells Van Pelt it's a favor for Cho. He gives it to Cho, telling him Tamzin Dove told him to give hium a jar filled with ashes and to keep it in a safe place. Cho smiles, safe."

He rips her blouse open (which looks hot, but seriously, what woman would want her cloths ruined?). They roll around on the floor of an apartment until the woman looks over and sees a dead man. Which totally kills the mood. CBI is on the scene. The making out dude (Frank) claims he got a call to check on the office where the victim was found. Only one thing was missing, but it's the most valuable thing in there: a painting. The victim wasn't supposed to be in the office, which wasn't his. Jane surmises the murderer was surprised and used whatever was nearby. He picks out a bust he thinks was used as a murder weapon.

The victim was dragged from somewhere. He guesses that Frank and the receptionist came up there to have sex (because she's hot) and then, because they weren't supposed to be there, dragged the body elsewhere because they couldn't explain why they were in there. Frank still doesn't admit anything. Jane further surmises the cameras in the room were off because, as the head of security, Frank could have turned them off. He folds.

At the office The Morrow portrait, owed by AP Caid, was extremely valuable. Caid is a wildcatter, out on his boat now. Lisbon tells the team (minus Jane, who's MIA) to look into Harry Lashley's death.

Lisbon and Jane talk to his wife, Stevie, who's in shock. She describes Harry as a jack-of-all trades for her father. Jane guesses that Harry was a jazz guitarist (he could tell from the calluses on Harry's hands). She doesn't know why Harry would be on that floor. Frank has since been fired, but the staff all knew what was going on. She says her husband was honest and gentle. She refers them to Katherine Hawkes, the woman who buys the art for her dad's collection.

Lisbon talks with Hawkes, who says there are probably 100 collectors worldwide who could pull off the hiest, but it's well-known Shirali Arlov - a Russian gangster - was outbid by Caid for the painting.

Lisbon sets the team on it.

Van Pelt finds that Harry has a record. She found evidence of a $20,000 payment to a mailbox in a small town. Jane suggests he and Van Pelt check it out. (She looks slightly aghast, but goes.)

Jane immediately homes in on the local gallery. He tells Lisbon to put the badge away. She tells him not to embarrass her.

In the studio, Jane starts in with telling a mom who's waiting for her daughter to get her portrait painted that he knows she thinks his fiancee is a lot younger than him. (See? That's exactly what Van Pelt meant.)

Jane hovers as the man paints, then excuses himself to go to the bathroom. But, as is his usual, he doesn't actually go to the bathroom. Instead, he looks around back as the artist chats up Van Pelt. Jane walks through rooms seemingly filled with knick knacks and junk. Up front, the artist tells Van Pelt her fiance kind of seems like a jerk. The ""jerk"" notices a secret room in back, turning a coat hook to find it. The painting is there.

Up front, the artist tells Van Pelt to turn her head to a certain angle, away from him, as he gets something from a cupboard. A rifle.

He leads her to the back where he finds Jane. Van Pelt takes out her badge. They have their hands up as she explains that if he kills them their office would know. He's surprised to hear that Lashley is dead. Jane says that the painting he has isn't an original. It's a good copy that Lashley commissioned. One of three he painted, two of which he gave to Lashley. They're looking at the third, which he kept because he liked it. He's a forger, but that isn't a crime. Lashley paid him $10,000 per painting. He explains that he puts a detail in every one so that it can be identified as a copy. Jane makes Van Pelt examine it closer until she finds the detail: a TV antenna in something from 600 years ago. Jane asks to borrow the painting, or Van Pelt will take him away and ask a million questions.

Jane and Lisbon meet with AP, who is tickled that someone stole his fake. He attempts to console his daughter over the loss of her husband, but is more focused on the painting. He keeps the real thing in his vault, which Hawkes isn't thrilled to learn. Jane asks to see it and immediately pronounces it fake. He asks AP to examine it. One of the riders in the background is carrying a machine gun. AP blames Hawkes, but she says she has the documents to prove he had the real one.

AP turns on his daughter, saying that her husband must have done it. Lisbon asks if they knew he spent six months in prison for theft year ago. AP lays into his daughter, saying he knew he shouldn't have trusted her husband. She just wants him to find her husband's killer.

At the office, they figure how and why Harry would have stolen the painting. Shirali Arlov is in the country, but traveling on a diplomatic passport. They can't talk to him. Jane asks where he's staying.

Cut to ladies in bikinis with drinks, frolicking around a posh house. A Russian-looking man watches someone snort some blow off a table and then looks at his wall, where the painting hangs.

Jane tries to goad Lisbon into giving him permission to visit Arlov. Jane sees that Rigsby wants to go after him and quickly talks him into sneaking off. They head to LA and Arlov.

Cho, Rigsby and Jane huddle in the car. The signal is ""she is beautiful."" Jane goes in, with a painting under his arm. Jane tells the goon at the door that he has the real Morrow portrait that was stolen a couple days ago and he'd like to sell it to Arlov.

They let him in.

He sits with Arlov, who generally acts intimidating. Rigsby and Cho listen in through Jane's cell phone.

At the office, Lisbon notices everyone's gone. Van Pelt tells her Jane called in sick, Rigsby has a hot date and Cho got Kings tickets. ""You know about that?"" Van Pelt says. Sure, Lisbon says, everybody knows the Kings are on the road tonight. No, the other thing. Yes, everybody knows Rigsby's in love with her.

Jane shows Arlov his Morrow. He unveils it - it looks like a child's drawing. He admits that it's a prop. He knows Arlov has the real thing, confirmed by a predatory smile on Arlov's face when Jane said he had it. Jane lays out the psychological profile of crime bosses. Sadistic, astute, methodical. Jane shows him his ID and explains he's trying to find out who killed Harry Lashley. He wants Arlov to tell him who he bought the painting from and stay protected with his diplomatic immunity. Arlov turns him down. Jane asks to see the Morrow.

He shows him. Jane asks to hold the 600 year old painting. Arlov hands it over. Jane says, ""she is beautiful"" and Rigsby pulls the smoke alarm. In the commotion, Jane swaps Arlov's for the forgery he brought in.

He runs out to Cho and Rigsby in the car, giggling over having ripped off the Russian mob. Lisbon and Jane go to see AP. She's peeved he directly went against orders.

They present AP with the painting as Hawkes and his daughter look on. Jane admits he stole it. There's nothing Arlov can do since he was in possession of stolen art. Stevie is upset that her dad is more excited to get the painting than he is concerned about her dead husband. He tells her again that Harry was no good and she could have had children with him. ""We dodged a bullet here.""

Jane watches the interaction happen, upset. He tells AP that he had a daughter once. That's how he knows anyone who treats his daughter like that is a fool. She's hurting and he doesn't care. ""You're a blind, vain, emotionally stunted fool,"" he says. AP tries to throw him out and Jane ramps up, trying to figure how he can make AP understand. He takes the Morrow from the wall and tosses it in the fire. Hawkes watches it burn. Jane turns to her and says you'd think that someone who dedicated their life to art would try to save a masterpiece, unless she knew it was another fake. She claims to be shocked.

Jane says it is a fake, which he only found out after he stole it. But Hawkes knew it was another fake because she has the real one in her safe.

Jane lays it out: Harry came to her for advice about the painting. She asked him to make a second painting so she could sell one to Arlov and keep the second one because, of course, she's the only one who deserves it.

All she had to do was come in after hours and take it off the wall. Flashback to Harry interrupting her and her hitting him over the head with the bust. Jane tells her people are going through her apartment right now - he looks at Lisbon who tries not to act surprised. She confesses. She never meant to kill him. Jane apologizes to AP for his pious rant earlier. He needed a pretext to burn the painting and their family dysfunction was it.

At the office, Cho and Rigsby puzzle over the idea that one painting is worth $10,000 and one is worth $50 million when they look so much alike. Jane looks at the panting he's just hung on the wall, does a double take and decides, eh, it's hard to say. Just to mess with them."

Gunshots erupt inside

The next day. Claire Wolcutt was found murdered. Her husband called the governor to call in CBI. He wants discretion. They arrive at the scene. Claire was cheating and found dead in bed. Rigsby and Van Pelt find shell casings on the other side of the room. So the lover didn't do it, Jane says. He would have been closer to the victim. A blood drop leads him to believe Mystery Lover was also shot, but slipped away.

Jane goes looking outside. He finds blood drops on the gravel path. They lead into the parking lot. He homes in on a car with the plate ""DOC LADY."" The front desk says it arrived about 7 minutes after the shooting. They open the guest's room. Lisbon walks in, gun drawn, on a couple in bed. They want to talk to the man, right after he puts some pants on.

The hotel staff watches them wheel the body away. The man from the bed, Paul Fricke, tells the story of the night before, just like Jane surmised. Fricke woke up shot then ran away. He ran into the ""DOC LADY"" in the parking lot and she not only treated his wound, but took him to bed. He says he met Claire a few weeks ago. He doesn't usually stay the night, but it was a long drive home, so he did. He's a ""pick up artist, a woman whisperer."" He doesn't know who killed Claire. But he has a full list of names and numbers of his conquests and a grading system. He's flattered by the idea that someone might have done it out of jealousy over him.

Later, Lisbon says they searched thoroughly for the gun and didn't find it on the property, so Fricke is in the clear. Claire's husband stops by, saying he expects their best.

Cho asks him a few questions. Wolcutt was out of town. He says no one would have any motive, but she did fire an assistant last month for stealing. He knows Claire was meeting a lover. Wolcutt says he wants to know the man's name, but Cho says he can't give it. ""Are you sure, agent Cho? Because I can make one call and your career is toast."" ""That's impressive, all I can get with one call is a pizza,"" Cho says, then continues questioning.

Jane watches video of Claire. Then he and Van Pelt go visit her former assistant, Natalie, who starts by calling Claire names and denying she stole anything. Natalie says she worked there for a year until Claire ""turned psycho.""

Jane looks around her messy apartment and tells her there's something on one side of the room she doesn't want them to find, what is it? Then he takes her wrist and uses her pulse as a ""hot-cold"" sensor, homing in on a camera. She doesn't want him to look. He finds a photo of Claire with Paul, time stamped two hours before the murder.

They take her in. Cho talks to Natalie. She says she took the pictures because she hoped threatening to expose her would get Claire to drop the theft charge. But she thinks it probably wouldn't have even worked. Mr. Wolcutt is controlling, especially about money. He probably knew all along she was sleeping around.

Cho believes her. Rigsby says Wolcutt's San Fran excuse checks out.

Jane wants to go back to the crime scene. Rigsby tags along. Jane steps outside onto the patio. The door locks behind him. He's done.

They go to the resort restaurant for lunch and find Fricke dining alone. The hotel manager, eager to re-open the room, asks how things are going. He sees Fricke talking with a waitress for too long and interrupts them. Fricke sees Jane and Rigsby and calls them over. He says he's upset someone he died, but the gunshot wound is a genius opener. He says he never falls in love. ""Love is for guys who can't get laid."". His basic system involves contempt, control, excitement. (The waitress hears this last bit.) He goes on as he ignore the waitress, Katy. Jane asks what's going on with them. When she walks away he says he ""used to let her"" sleep with him. And he admits he once had feelings for her. He says the patio door was closed the night he was with Claire.

Cho works his way through Fricke's list o' ladies. It involves young, old, married, single, black, white, prim, slutty. He keeps asking what attracted them to Paul Fricke. The lobby is full of just A through M.

Three days before she was killed, Claire withdrew $200,000 from an account her husband was monitoring. The cashier's check was made out to Paul Fricke.

Rigsby and Jane drop in on Wolcutt, who's in a tux, having a grand old time with the boys. He blows Rigsby off, saying he'll talk to him tomorrow. From across the room Jane says he wants to talk to him about his wife's lover and the money they know he knows she gave him. Wolcutt looms over, trying to be imposing, and Jane calls him a ""contemptible little buffoon."" Then he flicks him on the nose and leaves.

The next morning, Lisbon warns Jane that Wolcutt is on his way for a formal apology. For a formal apology he'll drop the whole thing. Jane says no. He guarantees Wolcutt will drop it because this whole thing makes him seem shallow and silly.

Back at the resort, Rigsby tries Fricke's rules on Van Pelt. She wonders why he's acting like a jerk. They find Fricke.

At the office, Lisbon tells Wolcutt that Jane won't apologize and because he won't apologize, they can't rule him out as a suspect. He asks what they want to know. He knew about Fricke and the money. He stopped the check but didn't confront his wife. He was happy, he's wanted to divorce her for ages. Infidelity cut her payout in half. He freely admits her death saved him a lot of money. He promises Lisbon she'll be hearing from the attorney general. She uses Jane's ""small and silly"" line on him and says he'll drop it.

Cho confronts Fricke about having accepted money from Claire. He says there are dozens of rich, needy women he could go to for help. Jane busts in, wanting to know about Katy the waitress. It used to be if he couldn't score, he'd ""call her off the bench."" Jane says it must be hard for her to watch him seduce women because she loves him. He says she'd never hurt anyone.

Jane tells Cho his little plan. It requires clothes with ""zing."" Jane says he's taking him shopping.

Cho shows up at the resort at night, looking super fly in a sharp suit, shades and exuding general hotness. He sits at the bar and takes tips from Jane through an earpiece. He focuses on two women. He asserts himself and joins them, taking charge. No help from Jane needed. Fricke walks in with two blondes. Katy is on shift. Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and Van Pelt watch from a nearby room. The manager tells Katy to clock out and have a drink on the house. Cho whispers something in one woman's ear that drives them both off. Jane declines to repeat it for Van Pelt but both he and Rigsby giggle. Alone now at the bar, Cho sweetly talks to Katy, who says Fricke was a ""sweet, caring, generous man"" when they were together. She screwed it up by saying mean things. Cho says she needs to make him jealous. She asks if he's hitting on her. He says yes. It works. They walk by, arm in arm, laughing and having a blast. Fricke notices.

In the room, Cho reverts to stone-Cho mode, ID'ing himself and apologizing. Katy says she's embarrassed and Cho says ""that's understandable."" She bursts into tears.

On their monitors the team sees a man walking down the hall to Cho's room.

It's the hotel manager, and he walks into the CBI room where Lisbon & Co. arrest him.

He asks how they knew it was him. Jane says the locked patio door means the killer must have entered through the main door. The staff has the keys. Flash to Jane noticing Fricke treat Katy like crap and the manager flinching. He had nothing against Claire, but hated Fricke for the way he used women. Jane gets him to say he's sorry. They realize Cho's not there.

Cut to Katy pouring her heart out to Cho. She finishes her story and says, ""love is crazy, I guess."" ""No it isn't,"" Cho deadpans, ""you should seek psychiatric help."" She cracks up.

Fricke joins Jane at the bar. Fricke looks longingly at Katy. He sees her with another waitress and calls them ""two tasty numbers."" Jane throws his drink in his face and tells him to stop being so stupid. He has a good woman who loves him. Fricke goes to talk to her.

A woman approaches Jane, and asks him to join her. But he can't. He's married."

Snooty women mingle downstairs while upstairs another one comes out of a room foaming at the mouth. She stumbles down the hallway and then off the balcony, providing the wrong kind of floor show for the function.

At CBI, Jane hypnotizes a murder suspect. Right as he's about to confess, Lisbon busts in saying they have an active case. Lisbon tells him the suspect's lawyer is on his way and Jane snaps him out just in time. Lisbon is anti-trance.

The CBI-ers visit the murder scene where Jane checks out the family photos and they talk poison. He looks at the victim's face and sees that one eye is heavily made up and the other isn't. He races upstairs where he finds mascara by the sink and ""Now we're even"" written on a cocktail napkin. A handy motive.

Villa Marsante Estates Jane and Lisbon drive through the gated community, with a luxury car in every driveway. The widower is saying good-bye to two neighbors, both women who seem awfully supportive and one who over-hugs.

Jane roots through the victim's purse as Lisbon tells the widower Victor that his wife Scarlett was killed with rat poison. Jane accuses him of having an affair with Asra, one of the women he was hugging out front, but he denies it, saying the woman's just his account's manager. Jane says that makes sense. Jane notices Scarlett's keys are missing from her purse.

Victor is a real estate developer. His wife made jewelry that he describes as ""trinkets."" Jane looks it over.

The party was Scarlett's idea, to let people know they're doing fine. Most of the guests were from the country club, where she was in charge of the womens committee.

Outside, Lisbon asks Jane what his deal is with Asra. He references the ""dinner theater way"" she hugged Victor out front, which means she's deceiving him. Jane thought it was an affair, but it's something else.

Jane and Rigsby go talk to the womens committee at the club. Rigsby thinks the murderer is a woman, given the lipstick and poisoning. Jane agrees. There's a tennis tournament and silent auction going on. Heather, the woman on the microphone, announces to Patience, Mandy and Jackie that the police want to talk to them. They were at the party because it's a rule that they have to attend the chair's parties. One accuses another of being jealous. Then they snipe.

Jackie says she saw Scarlett and Asra fighting at the party.

They head to the gossip queen Mandy to see if the affair rumor is true. She laughs it off. She thinks Victor killed his wife.

Patience says outright that Asra is having an affair with Victor and must have killed Scarlett. Even though she disliked Scarlett, she's wearing her earrings. And then she excuses herself to go bid on two nights at Cliffside Inn.

They get a look at the safe in the chairwoman's office. One more reason to find her keys. They start on a warrant.

Van Pelt reports Asra cleared out her bank accounts that morning. The estate calls, security reports her house is cleared out.

But Jane knows where she is. Cliffside Inn.

Rigsby and Van Pelt bust in on two people in bed. Two women: Asra and Mandy, the one who laughed at the idea Asra was having an affair with Victor. Turns out, she knew better.

Van Pelt asks to take lead on the interview. She interrogates Asra, tough Rigsby-style. She ran because she didn't want her affair to be exposed. And she didn't want to tell Victor she'd run his business into the ground. She borrowed from the company's reserve fund to cover her bad investments.

Outside, Rigsby makes Mandy wait. She insists she's done nothing wrong. She's worried about keeping the affair quiet. Cho walks over to tell Rigsby a judge says they won't have the warrant for the safe until tomorrow. Rigsby acts as if he's blown a secret and tells Mandy she has to keep that to herself. After she leaves, Rigsby compliments Cho on selling it.

Lisbon and Van Pelt talk to Victor about Asra skimming as his son plays sorcerer. He says his wife covered some debts with sales of her jewelry, she'd just made a deal with some boutiques. They ask about some calls to pre-paid cell phones and a regular appointment in her datebook in Marysville. Her husband says it's an antique jewelry market.

Cho calls Lisbon to say they ID'd the lipstick on the glass at the crime scene, sold only in high end stores. She tells him to meet them in Marysville.

Rigsby and Jane return to the country club, where Heater talks to Jane about losing her 16-year-old daughter in a car accident last year. They didn't move because they couldn't afford to.

Marysville At a dirt bike race, not exactly a jewelry market. Cho nabs a drug dealer in dramatic fashion.

At the club, Jane and Rigsby wait in the office in the dark for whoever took Scarlett's keys to show up.

They look through the things found on ""Digger,"" the man who was meeting Scarlett. His van is loaded with pills. He says Scarlett was one of is biggest customers, dealing prescription drugs. They met at a swap meet. Scarlett's been saying she was going to quit and he's been getting calls from another ""prissy sounding"" woman. Lisbon suggests he call her right now.

At the club, someone breaks into the safe. Her cell phone rings. It's Digger. Jane and Rigsby catch Patience red-handed with the safe open.

Rigsby interrogates Patience, who says she lifted the keys when she went to console Victor. She says she opened the safe out of curiosity. She says everyone knew Scarlett was dealing. She sums up what they have and it's not much. They let her go, with plans for discreet surveillance.

Rigsby discusses the bonuses of dating older women while he and Cho wait outside Patience's house. She spies them and brings out a panini to tied them over.

Lisbon and Jane tell Victor about his wife's dealing. Jane thinks he seems genuinely surprised, even though most people knew about it. (Their son is in a whole different costume, creeping around the balcony as a sort of Zorro-Batman.) Jane seeks him out.

Oscar doesn't mind that they can't find who did it, he just wants her back. But he's nine, he gets that he won't see her again. Jane tells him his make-believe could help him through it, just like Jane does, talking to his wife. They sword fight. The kid wins.

Cho and Rigsby wait outside the club while Patience gets her massage. Jackie, who is sweet on Rigsby, comes over to flirt. He notices her lipstick matches the one at the crime scene. She says she bought it that day after seeing Patience wearing it at the party. Somebody screams nearby and they run to investigate. They find Patience on the massage table with a knife through her middle. Turns out their surveillance was a little too discreet.

The team arrives and they try to figure out a motive for killing her. Jane agrees that Victor fits nicely.

He joins Jackie and Heather for a drink, ""accidentally"" saying too much by saying they're going after Victor. They both feel awful over the idea Oscar might be placed in foster care.

At Victor's house, there's a crowd and TV cameras assembled as they take Victor out in handcuffs. The women did their part blabbing. Oscar runs out, sobbing and crying for his dad. It's too much for Heather to bear. She rushes over to Jane and tells him to put a stop to it. She killed them both.

At CBI, Jane tells her he first suspected her because she was the only one who didn't wear Scarlett's jewelry. He says losing her daughter has ""unhinged"" her. She tells him that before her daughter drove that night she took some pills that she got from a friend, who got them from her mother, who got them from Scarlett.

Flashback to scenes of the party as Heather talks about how horrible it was to see her hosting parties and acting like everything was fine. And Patience told everyone at the club not to worry, she'd take over the business and keep the pills flowing. No lessons had been learned. She had to follow through.

Victor and Oscar come to thank Lisbon. Oscar enjoyed his make-believe role. They're moving out of the estate.

Jackie, Rigsby's crush, va-va-vooms into the office and Jane tries to prepare Rigsby for the impressive sight. Rigsby's not surprised she's there, he asked her out to dinner. Van Pelt smarts."

He notices Van Pelt chatting with a man at the pastry cart outside.

She comes in to work super cheery. Jane tells Rigsby about the guy who kissed Van Pelt outside. Jane gets a text on his phone and runs to show Lisbon: ""There's a very large bomb nearby, are you smart enough to find it?""

They evacuate. Lisbon thinks it could be a hoax. Jane's bothered by the personal nature of the text. He goes to inspect large cars nearby. Lisbon gets a call and stops following him. Jane finds a man tied up inside a van, gagged. The timer ticks down, but they can't get the door open. On the man's forehead it says ""U R Next.""

Lisbon drags him away from the van right as it explodes. Jane is thrown rump over tea kettle across a car hood. Still, he stands up, seemingly OK. But there's something in his eye, he says. He can't see.

He sits in a hospital bed with his eyes bandaged. He has a minor concussion and temporary blindness caused by blood clots. It might take 48 to 72 hours for his vision to come back. He's low on patience.

Cho visits. The victim is a stock broker named James Medina. He was reported missing recently. Jane says whoever did it wanted him to watch Medina die.

Lisbon reassures Jane that he'll be fine. She gives Cho a look when Jane pouts. He tells them not to look at each other like that. He can feel their pity.

At the Medina residence his wife sends their kids to stay with their aunt. She says her husband received hate mail, phone calls, email. An ex coworker named Terry Andrews came by the house a few times and was threatening.

Andrews was a statehouse employee, security. And he has a minor record. He's a bouncer at a club. Lisbon and Rigsby pay him a visit. He's not sorry Medina is dead. Rigsby puts a hand on him to take him downtown and he fights him off. Lisbon cuts corners, pulling out her Taser.

Jane comes in to HQ, eyes bandaged, following an officer and using a cane. Van Pelt and Lisbon try to tell him he's not supposed to be there. He claims his other senses are heightened as he stumbles through the office.

Rigsby interviews Andrews. He says he was alone when Medina was killed. Jane blunders into the interview and asks outright if Andrews killed Medina. He says he could have and he wanted to, but he didn't.

They got into it because an envelope fell off Medina's desk and Medina told him to pick it up and he wouldn't. Jane wants to hold his hand. He has artistic fingers.

Jane pronounces him innocent then he walks out.

In the office he takes the bandages off his eyes, but he still can't see. Jane says Andrews is filled with anger, but not guilty anger. Lisbon cracks up, saying she's going to make him a super hero outfit.

Jane is convinced there's a connection between Medina and him. He wants to visit with the widow.

At her house, Jane asks to hold some of James' things to get a ""sense of his being."" Lisbon thinks Jane's being a nut, but he's just pouring on the touchy feely.

From a horseshoe charm, he guesses they liked horses. He can tell a Rolex is expensive. He asks what the engraving is. It was a bull, from the brokerage.

Jane remembers meeting a woman and holding the same watch. He thinks years ago he did a psychic reading for someone else at the same firm. He can't remember who, but he thinks it'll be in his records.

Rigsby sees Van Pelt get a text from her boyfriend.

Rigsby wants Jane to find out about Van Pelt's boyfriend. So Jane calls her over, saying that they were wondering who the man she was kissing by the coffee cart was. She says it's none of their business and storms off. Rigsby isn't pleased with Jane.

Jane sits by Van Pelt. He says she and Rigsby need to talk. She looks through Jane's files. She asks why who she's seeing is anyone's business. Jane says he's just nosy, but Rigsby loves her. He's just scared of commitment. And she's attracted to him, but emotionally closed off because of a trauma in her past. By the way she listens quietly, it's clear he's right.

Van Pelt opens Jane's client list and runs it against the broker records. Carol Gentry is a match.

Flash back to the Jane residence 8 years ago, Jane telling Carol her mother truly forgives her. She doesn't understand. Her mother was a vicious, evil woman and Carol always took care of her, what could she forgive her for? Jane tries to recover, saying that it's complicated. Then they run out of time. Carol gives him a check and she leaves, dazed.

Remembering it, Jane looks like he feels like a turd. He stands up to walk away, but collapses.

Minelli, the director, allows Jane to stay once he's been checked out, if only to protect him from the bomber.

They start to discuss the possibility of Carol as a suspect, but it can't be her; she killed herself eight years ago and left no family, Jane says.

Van Pelt cross-checked client's spouses with the brokerage firm. Jill LaMott's husband worked there. Jane remembers her, too.

He flashes back to the same scene with the woman and the watch, but remembers her this time. She talks about a change she noticed in her husband. She gives Jane his watch to hold. Her husband seems preoccupied. She thinks he might be unfaithful. Jane holds the watch and breathes deeply, saying he's sensing something. He tells her that her husband hasn't been honest with her, or happy. He tells her she has to confront her husband.

At Lynch-Halstead brokerage firm. The boss vaguely remembers her husband Paul, who completely fell apart after his wife divorced him. Coincidentally, Medina was the one who fired him.

At the office, they look into his record as Jane listens. Paul ended up on the streets and his wife took their son.

Cho and Lisbon go to follow up leads and she forbids everyone from taking Jane anywhere.

As Van Pelt and Rigsby chat, her boyfriend Dan drops by. Van Pelt does not handle it smoothly, nor does Rigsby, who refuses to shake his hand. He asks if they have a problem. Rigsby says no, but after thinking about it, he changes his mind and takes Dan into the men's room, telling him if he ever causes Van Pelt pain, he'll hurt him. Dan assures him he's a nice guy.

And then, when Rigsby's back is turned, nice guy Dan kicks him in the back of the knee, whacks him over the head, knocks him down and out and cuffs him on the bathroom floor.

Rigsby lies bloody and cuffed in the bathroom to the stall.

Dan straightens his tie and goes to find Van Pelt, acting like everything is fine. He's dying to meet the psychic character she told him about.

She takes him over to Jane, asleep on the couch. They wake him up. He still can't see. He shakes Dan's hand. Jane asks where Rigsby, Cho and Lisbon are. They're all alone.

From feeling his hands, Jane figures that Dan builds things with them. He smells faint chemicals.

As Jane stands to get food, Van Pelt says she'll get it for him. When she's out of earshot, Dan leans in to Jane and asks if he thinks he's dumb. If he makes one move, he'll shoot her in the head. Jane understands.

On the other side of the room, Lisbon calls Van Pelt on her phone. They found Paul's homeless squat. They found out he has a son: Dan. Van Pelt tries to react, but Dan has a gun on her. She hangs up on Lisbon. He says he needed her to access the state lot. She tells him to give up, but he says he's in too deep. Jane tells her to do as he says. Dan confronts Jane for ruining his life, so what if his dad cheated on his mom?

Dan handcuffs her and takes them both outside.

The security guard is just locking up. Jane says good night to him and takes the pause to elbow Dan in the stomach, telling Grace to run. The security guard pulls his gun, but is too late. Dan shoots him (he lives) as Jane and Van Pelt run and hide behind cars. They're heading for her car. She can't drive handcuffed and he can't see. He says they'll manage.

Jane drives, poorly, as Van Pelt tells him where to go. Dan sees them and fires. Jane drives around the lot, hitting pretty much everything as Dan keeps firing. Jane backs into a car and they stall out. Dan approaches the now shot-out passenger side window and takes aim.

A gunshot rings out. Lisbon shoots Dan in the back. Just in time. ""What happened?"" Jane says. ""Did something good happen?""

Back inside, Van Pelt finds Rigbsy and hugs him, apologizing. She's thisclose to kissing him when the janitor comes in. The moment passes.

The next day, Lisbon watches as Jane takes off his bandages again. He pauses a moment before opening his eyes. He sees Lisbon, but tells her she has no idea how good it is to see her face, Rigsby. Ah, what a card."

They're on it because somebody leaked it and the governor wants them on it personally. Jane's pysched. The desert is beautiful this time of year. They take a picnic, but Van Pelt stays behind to answer phones.

Using the GPS, they reach the spot. 15 seconds to go. Time's up and Lisbon wants to go. Jane suggests they wait. He has sandwiches.

They hear a noise, a dull roar. And then a thud as a body falls from the sky.

The victim is David Whittaker, a VP of human resources for Carnelian Inc. They're on an outdoor adventure retreat. A parachute guy tells them the chute was messed with. He checked it himself last night and it was fine. But they were in the unlocked hangar overnight.

Randall Faulk, the CEO of the private equity firm rubs Lisbon the wrong way as he tries to leave without her permission. After asserting her authority, she lets him go.

Van Pelt calls Lisbon, giving her bad news about something on TV. They head to Faulk's.

The TV is reporting a message from the same person, ""Joe Q. Public"" claiming they've proved their strength and they'll do it again unless Carnelian makes a public apology. But Faulk doesn't want to cancel the company retreat. He says this is the moment to show resolve. Jane tells the assembled team that the killer didn't care which ""arrogant and greedy"" person among them was killed. They offer up their list of registered malcontents, anyone who ever complained or sued. Van Pelt checks it against the list of employees at the airfield.

Lee Skelling is on both lists. Rigsby and Cho pick him up and his young son pulls a shotgun on them. His dad talks him down as he's hauled away.

Cho reads a letter that Skelling sent to Carnelian two years ago, calling them names and accusing them of stealing. He made fan ducts for airliners and came up with an idea that saved his company money, but he didn't get his promised $50,000 bonus because Carnelian bought the company and denied it. He tried suing, but got nowhere.

Jane and Lisbon come for Skelling's wife, Jessie. Jane tells her they'll prove her husband is innocent if he is.

At the office, Cho asks for Skelling's alibi. He was at work last night and had access to the hanger, but he denies he did anything to the chute. He says he didn't know the Carnelian people were there. He was in the Army rangers and he'd sooner chop off a man's head and pee down his neck than kill a man by messing with his chute.

Jessie believes her husband is innocent because he told her so. Jane presses her on why she can be so sure. She removes her wig to reveal her mostly bald head. She's dying and he wouldn't lie to someone who's dying, or risk leaving their kids alone.

Jane talks to Lee, who says when he was at the aerospace company his wife had better health care. If he'd kept his mouth shut he'd still have his job and she'd be getting treatment. He says he'd kill them if he could get away with it. But everybody knows you can't kill rich people.

Lisbon jokes that she can read Jane's mind. He thinks Skelling is innocent. Lisbon orders him released.

Jane wants to go back and talk to the Carnelian executives. He wants to throw a cat among the pigeons. Except that he has no idea what he'll find, so it'll be a blind cat.

Off they go. Jane notices an old ranch hand with the executives, gathered in a barn. Jane starts asking questions, accusing a woman named Joyce of being a seething ball of angry resentment while another dude secretly thinks Faulk is a buffoon. He asks if anyone resents the sexual relationship between Faulk and Nadia Sobell. Faulk tells Sobell to keep quiet. Lisbon decides it's time to go.

Lisbon and Jane stop at a fruit stand and discuss the benefits of corporate retreats. She says he could benefit, maybe learn trust. For instance, she doesn't trust him. Think how often he's lied to her and mislead her. He suggests a trust fall. Then he reassures her until she agrees to flop. He catches her, as promised.

They make the three hour drive back.

At the office, Van Pelt gets another message from Joe Q Public, promising ""the king of the rats"" will meet his demise.

Jane turns around. He thinks someone's planted a bomb to kill Faulk. Cut to Faulk, dozing atop a bomb ticking down from 20 minutes.

Jane and Lisbon walk into Faulk's bedroom and wake him up. Jane finds it immediately and Lisbon has to warn him not to gloat. They get him out of bed safely. As the clock ticks down...nothing happens.

The next day a bomb guy tells them one wire was out of place, but it was serious stuff. It was made by an expert and made with army ordnance.

Lisbon and Jane visit the Skelling house, where Jessie tells them her husband took off because he knew how it'd look. Jane guesses he's in the mountains and his wife says he has a gun for hunting. Lisbon wishes she hadn't let him go but Jane still insists he's innocent.

Faulk makes a public statement saying Carnelian will weather the storm. Their stock is down 15 percent and falling. Jane wonders if anyone might have shorted the stock. Van Pelt checks the stock logs.

She finds an account that made trades mirroring the time line of the murders. It traces back to N.S. Holdings - Nadia Sobell.

Cho and Van Pelt check back in on the Carnelians. All but one are out playing paint ball war games.

Nadia nails De Shaun with paint and then is immediately hit herself: with real bullets.

The team reconvenes at the barn. Skelling was last sighted in the area. Lisbon still thinks it could be him. She thinks they look pretty dumb now that their main suspect was just killed.

Jane thinks they won't be hearing from ""Joe Q Public"" again. He notes that Whittaker's death was random, but Sobell's wasn't. He's not sure what that means yet, though.

Lisbon and Jane leave to talk to Faulk and De Shaun. Jane's carrying something in a bag. When Lisbon asks what it is, he first says a picnic, but then a bomb. No, really.

As they're all talking, the old ranch hand, Jake, tells them the cars are ready. Faulk decides he has to make a public apology, saying that staying was the wrong idea and that Carnelian is going to be reborn as an ethical company. Joyce thinks it's brilliant. Jane agrees.

Rigsby tells Jane and Lisbon that the bullet that killed Sobell matches back a shooting competition from years ago won by none other than Jake the ranch hand.

Jane is only mildly surprised and goes through the motions of insisting to Faulk that forensics doesn't lie and that this very specific bullet must mean he did it. Faulk insist Jake is ""salt of the earth"" and he's known him for six years.

Jane says maybe Faulk can help. He wants Faulk to talk to him. Lisbon isn't comfortable with the idea, but he suggests she wait outside with her gun drawn.

Jane talks to Jake, asking why he killed them all. Faulk asks Jake why? What'd he ever do to him? Jane continues insisting that Jake must have done it, even producing the bomb he accuses Jake of making. Jake doesn't recognize it, but Faulk gets twitchy. Then when Jane turns it on and it starts counting, Faulk swoops in to disarm it. ""Aha, as they say,"" says Jane. But Faulk insists he just guessed. So Jane arms it again and again Faulk shuts it down.

It's just armed with Play-doh now, Jane says. And Faulk made it to throw suspicion off himself.

Faulk says Jane has no legal proof. Jane doesn't necessarily disagree. He just likes to know that he's right.

At the station, Jane tells Faulk that he knew it was him the minute the bomb under the bed failed to go off. Whittaker's death was a camouflage to disguise Sobell's death. That's who he needed dead.

Cho produces an affidavit from Sobell's lawyer saying that she was negotiating to join their competitor, and filing and sexual harassment suit against him while shorting the stock.

Still, Jane compliments Faulk on the ""genius"" of Joe Q. Public and then rebranding the company. Everybody loves a comeback.

Jane suggests a deal. Manslaughter for Whittaker, no charges on the bomb, and they won't go after the death penalty. Faulk asks in exchange for what.

Cut to the Skellings opening a check from Faulk for $500,000."

A man in a suit drags an unwieldy something down the street, talking to himself.

The team waits in line to go through security at their office. The man enters the door. He was dragging a woman's body wrapped in a blanket.

Lisbon and Cho draw their guns and get him in handcuffs. Jane inspects. The man's pulse is slow and he's not on drugs. Mr. Resnick announces he just dragged the body three blocks. He says it's a gift: a bag of potatoes.

Jane peers at the man and announces that he's hypnotized.

Later, Rigsby doesn't buy it. He thinks the man was lying.

Cho talks to Carl Resnik, asking who told him to bring a bag of potatoes to the cops. Carl doesn't remember. Cho shows him the photo of the dead woman. Karl sees potatoes.

Rigsby thinks he's crazy. But Jane is sure he's hypnotized. He mentions that no one can be forced to do anything against their nature when hypnotized. So either Carl was talked into it, or the hypnotist killed the woman and framed Carl.

Lisbon asks if Jane can unhypnotize him, but he says it's nearly impossible without knowing the trigger. Easier to find the hypnotist and ask them. Carl has no record. He's a straight arrow, follows the law. Jane says that makes him the perfect candidate, soft and malleable.

The victim is a school teacher, Mary Beth, 26-years-old.

Lisbon and Rigsby talk to her sister, Lindsay. She just returned from a trip to San Francisco. Mary Beth was a teacher, but got her a job as an assistant. Lindsay's an event planner for Neuro Linguistic Programming. Jane pops up: ""'Sneaky Ways to Influence People' doesn't sound quite as catchy.""

Jane recognizes the name Dr. Royston Daniel, whom she works for.

Cho tells Carl that Mary Beth is dead. He knew her from the center, where he took classes.

Jane wants to take Carl to the Dr. as bait. They do. Rigsby thinks it's a scam, but Carl says it can better your life.

Lisbon and Jane walk in to hear an older man addressing the auditorium. A younger man walks out and taps him on the arm. The older man comes out of his trance. The younger man introduces himself as Daniel. Everyone, including Jane, cheers.

Jane walks down to the edge of the stage and interrupts Daniel saying that his boat is on fire. He doesn't have a boat. Well then, Jane says, your assistant is dead. He watches for a reaction.

Daniel leaves with them, turning the seminar over to his associate Rick, who is markedly less charismatic than Daniel.

Out in the hallway, Daniel doesn't recognize Carl.

Rigsby talks to Daniel and a few moments later, as is his wont, Jane interrupts. Rigsby tells Daniel about Carl's potato-believing trance. He recognizes it's a powerful trance.

He extols the virtues of his work and Lindsay interrupts with some paperwork for him. Daniel walks over to her, surprised she's at work, and tells her she doesn't need to be there. She should go home and ""take care of you."" She apologizes meekly and repeatedly, saying it was a bad idea to come in. She shuffles out.

Rick continues the seminar, building steam and getting the crowd into it. He walks to the back of the auditorium and sees Carl there, and is surprised. He asks him what he's doing there and Carl asks him what Rick wants him to do. And then Rick runs. Lisbon chases, catches and cuffs him.

Cho interrogates Rick, who denies hypnotizing Mary Beth or Carl. Cho tries to offer him the ""diminished capacity"" drunk defense. He says he asked Mary Beth out yesterday. She said no way in hell. He says he'd had a lot to drink and then blacked out at 1 a.m. He woke up at 5 a.m. in her living room over her body, holding a smoking gun.

Lisbon joins Carl and Rigsby. Lisbon sits and crosses her leg. Rigsby does the same. When she runs her hand through her hair, he does the same. She busts him. It's called ""modeling,"" some step in the NLP process. She laughs him off and leaves. Rigsby isn't buying it. Carl snaps, hits the table and says he will.

The team celebrates with pizza for a closed case. Jane isn't partaking. Something about Rick's story bugs him. Why would a drunk guy be standing over a dead body and not lilting?

Lindsay shows up for her sister's things. Jane asks if she believes Rick killed her sister. She actually doesn't. She asks if Rick said how he got to their apartment. Her sister really, really disliked him and wouldn't have let him in. Mary Beth was really security conscious since she and Daniel got mugged in Maui. She just now mentions that Mary Beth and Daniel were dating for six months.

""And, voila,"" says Jane.

They wonder why Daniel lied. Rigsby asks Lindsay more about her sister's relationship with Daniel.

Van Pelt goes to pick up Daniel. He pesters her for information, but she isn't talking. He thinks he has her figured out, a tough, pretty girl. He guesses that she's from a small town and ambitious but doesn't let anybody see it. Van Pelt stares at him. ""Mr. Daniel, no offense, but I've been working with Patrick Jane for nine months now. If you want to get under my skin, you're going to have to up your game.""

In the interrogation room, Daniel denies he and Mary Beth were dating. They went to Paris a while ago, but on business. Jane thinks he's lying because he doesn't break eye contact.

Rigbsy asks to give it a try. Then he goes in and bounces Daniel's face off the desk, breaking his nose.

Out in the hall, Lisbon demands his badge and gun, asking if he knows what he's done. Jane stares at him. Oh dear. He's hypnotized.

The team sits around Rigsby, who denies he's hypnotized. He says he was just questioned the guy. Jane tells Lisbon that Rigsby does have a brutal streak, so it's not entirely out of the question he could be hypnotized to hurt a suspect. He tells her that deeply hypnotized subjects are very susceptible to suggestion and have little inhibition. Jane tells him to close his eyes and think about what he most wants to be doing right now. Jane tells him to open his eyes and do it. Rigsby laughs. Van Pelt starts to walk away, but Rigsby grabs her and kisses her deeply. She lets him. Oh yea, he's hypnotized.

Then he says he has to leave. Rigsby won't listen to anyone who tells him to stay, except Van Pelt.

So Rick really was hypnotized. They try to figure out who could have done it. Why would Daniel order Rigsby to smack his face into the table? Jane thinks that was a side effect of a the deep hypnotic command.

Lisbon and Cho go to the courthouse. She's peeved Rick is out on bail on reduced charges, but she tries to get him to come with them to stay safe.

Rick gets in a cab. Cho reports that Rick didn't post his own bond. The center did.

Jane takes Rigsby and Van Pelt to the playground, where Rigsby should feel safe.

Jane's going to try to break the trance. He gets Rigsby to watch the motion of kids on a swing set. As Rigsby zonks out, Jane guesses hypnotic triggers. It could be a word, touch or sight. Rigsby starts to get upset and runs off. Jane says he's in too deep. If Van Pelt tries to stop him, he might hurt her. They let him go.

Rigsby walks into the center's empty auditorium. He finds Daniel - tied to his chair with Lindsay holding a gun on him.

Flashback to when Rigsby went to ask Lindsay about her sister and Dr. Daniel. She hypnotized him.

Back in Daniel's office, he tries to get Rigsby to listen but Lindsay tapes his mouth shut. She yells at him for having ignored her. She loved him and thought if she got Mary Beth out of the way, he might notice her. They drag Daniel, tied to the chair, up onto the roof. Rigsby asks if she was in S.F. when her sister was killed. Yes, but she took a rental car, drove down, killed her sister and hypnotized Rick and Carl. She tells Rigsby that Daniel hurt her. He punches Daniel. She says she needs his protection.

And then Jane joins them on the roof. He put a tracking device on Rigsby in the park and followed it. Lindsay points out she has the gun. Jane has Lisbon, who pops out, gun drawn. Then Lindsay calls for Rick, who also appears out of the shadows with a gun drawn.

Jane tells Lisbon to listen to Lindsay and put down her gun. He's impressed with her. She says she wasn't the sparkling, vivacious one, Mary Beth was. Until she met Dr. Daniel and she realized she was good at getting people to do things. Jane, with his hands up, talks to her calmly, pointing out all the people there have to die. That's not control, that's madness. She's having a nervous breakdown and needs help, he says.

She mentions the nice sound of the ocean and tells Rigsby to take Jane for a swim. There is no ocean. It's over the side of the building to concrete. Rigsby gets Jane to the edge and both Lindsay and Jane try to get him to listen to them. Jane distracts Rigsby by suggesting there's a shark below. He sees Lindsay start to tap Rigsby on the shoulder and realizes that's the trigger. He taps Rigsby first and he snaps out of it. Lisbon takes the distraction as an opportunity to disarm Rick. Rigsby cuffs Lindsay as Jane tells him he was in a trance state. He doesn't believe it.

Back at the office, they razz Rigsby. But Lisbon says he's cleared for assaulting Dr. Daniel. He doesn't remember anything from when he was hypnotized. Van Pelt assures him he was perfectly normal. She walks out and Cho and Lisbon think he remembers but is faking. Jane says it'll come to him. He touches him on the shoulder."

Cho interviews a Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Jane asks them to hand over the valet ticket they stole from the dead man. Charlie takes it out from under his hat. Jane runs them off.

They find his car. There are a ton of drugs in the trunk.

Lisbon and Jane visit Poseidon Studios in Burbank. They talk to the director, Gabriel Fanning. He had dinner with Felix Hanson, the victim, the night before. Hanson was financing Fanning's movie to the tune of $10 million. Hanson's wife Felicia Scott was starring it. Gabriel says everything went fine. Jane thinks he's lying because they split the bill and you don't do that with someone who gave you millions.

Van Pelt traced the last number on Hanson's phone, a convicted felon and commercial actor, Freddie Ross.

Jane and Lisbon meet with Felicia Scott and her teenage step-daughter, Sydney. She was at a spa weekend. Jane asks what first attracted her to her husband. Jane says he wasn't her type. She's attracted to bad boys, he says. She denies her husband did drugs. Sydney insists she knows nothing about the drugs. When she reaches for her ringing phone she drops a photo of a young man. Jane sees it. They get called to set. Felicia says she'll go, the insurance company insists. The daughter has a small speaking role. She says her dad thought Gabriel screwed up the script and wanted to back out. Felicia says he was only threatening.

Jane talks to Sydney, asking about the guy. It's Brandon Fulton, they're sort of dating.

Rigsby and Cho check out Ross at a seedy motel. He doesn't answer their knock but comes home and runs when he sees them. Cho gets the plate.

Back on set, Mitch Cavanaugh, Gabriel's agent, intercepts Lisbon and Jane. He's not inclined to let them talk to his client. Jane talks to Mitch, asking if he was bullied in school. He says it's the same thing with Gabriel, he needs to get a life. Mitch lets them through to his client. Lisbon busts Gabriel in his trailer with pills. Gabriel admits that last night Hanson said he was pulling his money. He admits Hanson's death was convenient. Lisbon wants to bust him for the pills but Mitch takes the rap. She arrests him.

They start filming. Felicia tries to film a scene in which she talks outside a flower shop on her cell phone. Sydney reads lines off camera. Felicia stops filming, telling Sydney to put some effort into it. Sydney watches, cringing, as her step mom kisses someone for the scene and then tries to suggest changes to the scene to Gabriel. They break for 10. Sydney takes off and Jane follows her. He tries to talk to her, but she takes off in a golf cart.

Cho talks to Mitch, telling him he's in line for actual prison time. He says he doesn't know who killed Hanson. But he can give them Freddie Ross, the drug dealer.

Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt find him at a house party. They also find Sydney Hanson. They talk to Ross, who says Hanson called him to tell him to stay away from his 16-year-old daughter. Ross knows her boyfriend, who buys from him.

Lisbon and Jane talk to Sydney. Lisbon thinks they were her drugs in her dad's car. Jane wonders why women like bad boys. They needed cash so she took some stuff from the house, pills and a gun. Brandon, 19, sold them. Lisbon says her phone records show he's been calling her house regularly, but she says she hasn't talked to him.

Felicia tells Lisbon and Jane the stolen gun was a .45. Lisbon tells her that her husband was murdered with a .45. She admits she knew the drugs in Felix's car were Sydney's. When Jane says Brandon has been calling the house regularly Felicia puts on a good show of being disappointed in her step-daughter. Lisbon says there won't be any charges against Sydney. Jane watches with amusement as she thanks Lisbon profusely.

Outside, Jane predicts that Brandon Fulton will pay a visit to the Hanson house that night.

Rigsby and Cho sit stakeout outside the house. Brandon Fulton arrives and lets himself in with keys.

They race in as Brandon walks down the hallway with a gun drawn.

They hear shots. Felicia shouts ""help me"" as she shoots Brandon in the dark. They call the paramedics. He's holding a .45.

As Felicia is fitted for a dress, Lisbon tells her she won't be charged right now, but he'll be fine. She puts on a good show of being relived. Jane tells her the gun Brandon was holding killed Felix. Jane watches her reaction to learning Sydney might be charged as an accessory for stealing the gun.

Cho and Rigsby ask Brandon what he was doing with the gun. He thinks they shot him. He says Felix was a monster who liked to hurt people. But he won't say anything else.

Back at the office, they recap that they need a confession since the gun isn't direct evidence. Jane talks to Sydney. She says she didn't ask Brandon to kill her dad. Jane suggests that maybe someone else made him do it.

Jane lurks near Lisbon. He thinks Felicia and Sydney should go back to work. He'd like to watch the theater.

Gabriel greets the women, telling them to rehearse from the top and not to worry too much about staying on script. He gives Jane a thumbs up. Sydney starts accusing her mother of seducing Brandon and lying to her. On camera, in front of the crew and extras, Felicia tries to deny it. Jane interrupts, saying Felicia is wooden and high pitched. He doesn't buy it. Then he recaps, saying she seduced then manipulated Brandon, telling him Felix was abusing her. Then she lured him to the house that night to kill him. He tells her her career hinges on her being able to convince the gathered crowd that she's telling the truth. ""My work is always truthful,"" she says. ""There's a little afternoon soap in there,"" Jane replies. ""That's a terrible thing to say,"" she says.

Jane tells her to give the truth and make it real. He backs away. She looks at Sydney. She apologizes. She was angry that Felix changed his mind over script issues. She thought he didn't want other men to look at her. He was suffocating her, it was a form of abuse. The crew doesn't buy it.

Flash back to Brandon coming in one night as Felicia reads a script at home with a drink. She says he forced himself on her as the flashback shows her seducing him. Brandon told Felix that Sydney was in trouble to get him to Hollywood Blvd.

Sydney watches her step-mother's confession. She says if only Felix could have respected her needs this wouldn't have happened. ""Men are beasts,"" Jane says. Felicia asks him to tell Sydney she's sorry. She wasn't the step-mother she might have been."

Jane says his is on the way.Lisbon says it is typical then Jane implies that she is grumpy because Daddy didn't buy her a pony, as a joke.

They get a call.

A man is dead in a pile of sticks, shot in the head. No ID, but Jane thinks he worked in an arcade because he had a token and cheap prize on him. He thinks he came from up river because the river flooded recently and he's on top of the sticks.

Lisbon swears grumpily that she's not grumpy that Jane didn't get her a gift.

They go to an arcade up river. The tokens match. A manager IDs the guy as Ed Diedricksen. He trips all over himself talking to Jane. He says his wife said Ed was away on a family emergency.

They talk to people in the arcade. Rigsby shares that he hates talking to teenagers, it's like talking to mud. Jane shows some whippersnappers how pinball is supposed to be played.

Cho, VP and Lisbon go to visit Ed's wife Jenny. They paid for the house in cash, no mortgage. It's big.

Rigbsy enjoys a lollipop as Jane goes Tommy on the pinball. The kids stand in awe. And then it turns out that Jane hypnotized one.

The kid says Ed would get them weed or loan them money, but would charge a high vig. He tells about a time Ed broke a kid's finger for flipping him off. He says Ed cussed in something foreign. Jane taps the kid twice on the shoulder and he blinks, looking totally confused.

Jenny watches the team from inside but won't let them in. Lisbon decides they have reason to believe someone's life is in danger. They bust down the door and are greeted with a shotgun-wielding Jenny. She says she has people coming.

Jane calls, telling Lisbon he thinks the Diedricksens were in witness protection. And then more armed men break down the door. Lisbon IDs her team. The US Marshals ID themselves. Jenny relaxes.

CBI breaks the news about dead Ed to Jenny, and the Marshals. They knew he was missing but that's all. Ed used to be in the mob when he was Ed Russo.

The US Marshal thinks they must have contacted someone from their old life. Jane tells the Marshals that Ed was selling drugs as a front for a biker named Tiny.

VP and Cho talk to Jenny/Gina. Jane picks up that Gina doesn't like it there. No good Italian food. She thinks Ed's old mob boss did it. She says they didn't talk to anyone from their old life, or anyone at all. She thinks somebody paid a marshal to rat them out. Jane promises her they'll catch them.

Lisbon hands out assignments. VP and Rigsby drop in on a biker garage. When they ask for Tiny he comes at them. They cuff him. He says Ed was a rat. He says a few weeks ago he and Ed got busted with ten pounds of weed and Ed got out right away. He assumed he was a snitch. But he says he didn't kill him.

At the office, Rigsby reports on Tiny's story and says the arrest report shows no trace of Ed.

VP says the old mob boss Sonny Battaglia retired and the new boss would have no reason to want Ed dead. As luck would have it, Sonny retired to a golf course nearby.

Jane interrupts his game. He says he's not a cop and he's alone. Sonny responds by telling his goon to shoot Jane. The goon draws a gun.

Jane starts talking, saying there are three reason he's not terrified. 1 - You don't get to be Sonny's age shooting people willy nilly on golf courses. 2 - He can significantly improve his golf game. 3 - He knows where to find Eddie Russo.

Sonny starts on golf first.

Lisbon welcomes the two US Marshals to her office. She asks them if they got Eddie off the hook for a drug bust. They say no. Exley says Russo was all out testimony and no use to them anymore. He thinks it was either the local cops or she's just as misinformed as she is disrespectful and dumb.

Lisbon notices Jane is gone. She decides not to send someone after him.

Back on the course, Sonny follows Jane's advice, singing as he swings. He's pleased. Now he's ready to talk Eddie Russo. Jane sees that Sonny didn't know. He breaks the news. Sonny doesn't know who did it. He says if he finds out, he'd like to send whoever did it some flowers and a thank you note. He gives Jane his number. He says it must have been an angry husband, Ed was a degenerate skirt hound.

Jane reports back to CBI, saying that Sonny didn't do it.

VP reports that Ed's car was just towed from outside the arcade, which means someone picked him up from work.

Cho and Rigsby talk to the manger to find out who picked Ed up. His wife, a pretty black lady about 5' 10"", which perfectly describes Marshal Knox.

Marshal Exley comes storming into CBI, angry they put in an official request to talk to his partner. Lisbon tells him the police department confirmed Knox sprung Ed the night he got arrested. They can't find her.

Police officers inspect a stopped car. Knox is at the wheel. She's barely breathing. They find pill bottles and a note saying ""I'm sorry.""

They take her to the hospital. Lisbon tells Exley his partner looks like she's going to be OK. Jane suggests Exley talk to Knox. He thinks Knox was having an affair with Ed and Exley was secretly in love with her. He says if Exley knew about their affair he'd be their prime suspect. Jane says Exley's best defense is a total lack of detective skills.

Cho and Lisbon go to the hospital. Jane dials VP's phone and tells her to ask for Mary. Sonny answers. He does the same thing with Rigsby's phone and asks Rigsby if he has shiny sweats.

Jane preps VP as they go talk to Jenny. She's supposed to stay until Gina's comfortable and then leave. Jane calls Sonny himself, asking if anyone has left any messages for Mary. Sonny curses him out.

Jane brought groceries. He plans to cook for her.

Later, he stirs the sauce and talks to Gina. VP gets her call and excuses herself. Jane shares wine with Gina after a good meal. He tells her they think her husband had an affair with Knox. She doesn't buy it, says that he changed. But Jane doesn't buy it. He asks her to confess to killing Eddie.

He tells her he talked to Sonny, and he thinks that she encouraged Eddie to rat in the first place. He tells her she can make him look good with the cops and confess or make him look good with Sonny and die. Jane dials and hangs up, saying Sonny's associate is on his way. Then he dials Sonny to ""prove"" how mad he is. Jane refers to the woman they spoke of earlier, saying he'll put her on. Sonny, irate about prank calls for Mary, lets loose a string of descriptive and vulgar death threats, which Gina believes are meant for her.

Jane asks her which it'll be, confess or die. Jane looks out the window, saying he's there. Gina sees Rigsby walking up in his sweats and shades, looking like a hired gun.

Jane takes out a tape recorder as she confesses, saying she followed Eddie and shot him then dumped him over the edge. Agent Rigsbys arrests her. She knows she's been played.

Exley tells Lisbon and Jane that Knox wanted to apologize personally. He apologizes, too, saying he was out of line. Jane hugs him.

Lisbon tells Jane that toying with mafia bosses is no way to close cases. He thinks Lisbon is still grumpy about the birthday present thing. He sticks a bow on her office door. She opens it. There's a pony inside."

Jim Gulbrand, CEO of a software company, was reported missing yesterday. They found blood on the deck of his yacht, but no body. Van Pelt hacks and wheezes and Lisbon forbids him from getting her sick.

On the boat they check out the very small spot of blood. He's worth around $100 million and recently divorced. His company was under investigation by the SEC. He was facing fines and prison time.

Jane checks out the outside of the boat. He and Lisbon see the anchor in the water at the same time. Inside, they bring it up. There's no need to be anchored when you're tied at the dock, Jane explains. They raise it and find a man chained to it, quite soggy and dead.

At the Gulbrand mansion his brother Keith, who seems to think he's Keith Richards, tells Lisbon and Jane about the company. Jim started the company with his childhood friend Rick. He's dating Brooke Harper, a psychiatrist. They met when Keith was in rehab, where she worked.

Keith doesn't have anything nice to say about Jim's ex.

A portion of the estate goes to Jim's charities and the rest goes to him, Keith says. He was with a woman he can't quite recall the night his brother was killed. Lisbon calls Cho to check out the alibi. He tries to rouse Rigsby from his desk, but decides to leave him and his snot behind.

Cho checks out Jim's company, Gaia Matrix. The head of security, a man named Stuart who's in a wheelchair, shows Cho and Van Pelt to Rick. He talks about how much Jim to the company as he leads them there.

Rick says Jim was the visionary and he handled the business side. He won't talk about the SEC investigation, but he says it didn't upset anything with Jim. Without him, he says, the company is in grave jeopardy.

Rigsby and Jane interview Jim's girlfriend, Brooke the shrink. Jane asks her why she's at work the same day her boyfriend died. She says it's the only way she knows how to cope. She notices Rigsby is sick and writes him a prescription for an antiviral.

At the office, Rigsby feels like hell. He hasn't filled the prescription. Jane finds it interesting because it's legible. He thinks she might not be a real doctor because she was warm and personable. Van Pelt looks her up. According to records, she's 64 years old, which the pretty young woman they met earlier clearly was not.

Brooke meets with a patient, telling him this will be their last session. She gives him her private number. The secretary interrupts, telling her the CBI are there. As the patient starts talking again Brooke takes back her private number and climbs out the window. She drives off before the team comes in.

Cho gives Jane the stuff they found at Brooke's apartment, including a wig. Jane thinks she's a professional con woman.

Van Pelt checked Gulbrand's bank records. He withdrew $10 million from his accounts and doesn't seem to have spent it.

Jane wants a copy of Brooke's last credit card statement.

Rigsby and Van Pelt go speak to Gulbrand's ex wife. They tell her Gulbrand might have hidden money during the divorce. She mentions that he was wearing a key under his shirt, saying it was for a gym locker. She tells them she was at a wine tasting when her ex was killed, but she won't say any more.

Lisbon reports that Gulbrand was cooperating with the SEC investigation.

Jane draws pictures of what Brooke bought with her credit card nine days ago and yesterday. Nine days ago she bought stuff to pose as a man. The other stuff, a gun, a cigar and a dress is a puzzle.

When Van Pelt tells them about Gulbrand's key, he thinks that's why Brooke bought stuff to dress like a man. And now she's trying to get inside somewhere else.

Jane and Cho check out the private Backgammon Club.

Van Pelt and Rigsby sit in the car staking out Gulbrand's ex. He's feeling much better since taking whatever Brooke gave him. They watch as Rick pulls up and gets into Jim's ex's car and proceeds to make out with her.

Jane plays backgammon with a member. He's up $20,000 when they see Brooke walk in. As the prince prepares to write him a check Jane admits that he cheated by controlling the dice.

Jane and Cho interrupt Brooke at the lockers.She has a cigar box filled with cigars, not cash. They arrest her.

Jane joins the interview. When she lies about her name Jane lies about how they found her.

She says Jim gave her the key. She says she loved him.She pretends to be surprised there's $10 million hidden somewhere.

Van Pelt talks to Jim's ex. She says she started seeing Rick after she got divorced.

Rick tells Rigsby he misled them to protect the company. It's news to him Jim was cooperating with the SEC.

Jane talks to Stuart, the head of security at Gaia. He thinks Jim asked him where to hide the money. They tell him about Brooke and the fact Jim's key didn't work at the club. Stuart told him to hide it off the grid. Not on his property and a place no one would think to look.

Jane drops back in with Brooke, laying out a story in which she took the key and made a duplicate, but then got frustrated when it didn't work. As Jane plays with the key he drops something into her purse.

Jane has figured out who she is. Lindsay Smith from San Deigo. Jane thinks there's more to her than just a love of money. He wishes her luck and leaves. Jane walks out, leaving the key behind.

Brooke picks up the key and talks her way out of the interview room. Jane watches her leave, pleased.

Van Pelt watches the Brooke tracker on her computer. Van Pelt says her dad calls trick plays like this ""chewing gum"" plays. Sometimes you fool the other guy and sometimes you just get gum in your hair.

They track her to a train station. They see her arrive. She wheels Stuart out of her van, holding a gun to his back. His chair doesn't fit through the gate at the storage lockers. She tells him not to move as she opens the locker. As she takes out the bag, Stuart gets up from his chair and walks easily toward her as her back is turned. He grabs her gun and takes the money but the team stops him shortly. Brooke tries to walk off as well, but is also stopped.

At HQ Lisbon recites Stewart's list of aliases. He says everybody trusts people in a wheelchair. Jane lays out how it happened. Stewart went to the yacht that night for the key and took it, tying Jim to the anchor. But he couldn't have known Brooke swapped the real key with a look alike.

He's angry he spent six months in that chair. He asks why Jane questioned that he was in it. Jane says whenever he meets someone in a wheelchair he checks the bottom of their shoes for scuff marks, which Stuart's had. He's been doing it for years and this is the first time it's ever paid off. He finds this very gratifying.

Jane visits Brooke. He wishes he could let her go, but she understands. An agent comes to transport her to the federal detention center. As she leaves, she leans in and whispers to Jane: ""See you around."" When the agent says she won't be seeing anyone Jane says he doubts that, she's very good at what she does."

Rigsby isn't happy about whatever he sees on the body. He thinks Jane is going to freak. Jane looks at the body. He freaks. It's a young woman, sliced up Red John style, with painted toe nails. Jane's sure it's Red John and he put her in a state park to make sure he was on the case.

There's a noise overhead. A plane draws Red John's signature smiley face in the sky.

Plaskett Residence Jane and Lisbon visit the victim's parents. The sheriff mentions the nicotine gum he's chewing tastes terrible. They're hoping to find her twin before it's too late. The dad asks if they think Maya's dead also and Jane instantly says yes. Lisbon tells him they keep hope and Jane blurts ""not much.""

Jane thinks it's Red John, but someone else is involved, otherwise why would he change his MO so much? He usually gets them at home and doesn't go for twins. The last time he broke a pattern, it was personal, to punish Jane. He thinks Red John either knows them or knows someone close to them.

Van Pelt interviews the pilot. She got an internet order from RJ Solutions.

Jane talks to the parents. Jane says that Emma, the victim, was darker, moodier and Maya was more cautious and conservative. He points this out so they'll know there's no point in lying to him. Then he accuses the wife of following her husband's lead and having a drinking problem. He succeeds in provoking the mom.

She says their 19-year-old girls have recently gotten into drugs and Maya was involved with a small time thief named Mace. The local sheriff Hardy knows him. They go to his house where a dog tries to scare them off.

Mace sneaks out the back and runs. Jane notes he has a very loyal dog.

Cho and Rigsby follow up the address of RJ Solutions, a post office box. The woman won't let them look in it without a warrant.

Back at Mace's house, they release his dog and follow him as he races with a purpose to a shed where Mace is hiding.

Jane talks to Mace at CBI HQ. Mace hadn't heard about the girls. He says he wasn't sleeping with either one. Jane says he can tell he's lying. He tells him he has a personal interest in the case, he'll do whatever it takes.

Boss man Minelli, watching from the other room, thinks Jane goes too far by threatening to kill him. Lisbon promises to control him.

But Mace starts talking. He was seeing Emma. But a few months ago he got a call from a man with a soft, quiet voice telling him to stay away or else. He ignored it. Then a few weeks later he woke up next to a pig's head. He says no one knew about him and Emma.

Jane and Lisbon go back to the parents. Their brother Drake is there. Mom is drinking. They ask how Drake knew about Mace to tell his mom. He says he heard the girls talking about him a month ago.

Jane goes back to the girls' room. He looks for hiding places and finds a camera, microphone and transmitter in the drapes. Jane asks Drake how his electronic skills are. Dad says there was a break-in eight months ago, they reported it to the police.

Rigsby and Cho prepare to open the mailbox. They get Jane on the line. There's an envelope inside addressed to Roy Tallifiero. It's a letter from a woman named Rosalind to Roy, hoping that he'll come back one day even though he treated her cruelly.

Jane reads it and thinks Roy is Red John.

They visit Rosalind (Alicia Witt). She's blind.

Jane tells her they think he's a serial killer and she runs away denying it. She shuts herself in her bedroom. Jane tells her about Emma and Maya and the fact that Red John killed his wife and child.

Rosalind opens her bedroom door. Jane comes in and looks around. The walls are bare - except for his trademark smiley face on the walls. Jane takes it in as Rosalind says she's sure Roy is a good man. He goes along with it, saying maybe Roy is just using Red John's identity.

She serves them tea and says he came to use her phone when his car broke down nearby. They started talking and he stayed for two days. They dated for five months. He never said what business he was in.

Jane asks what she meant in her letter. He left and never came back. That was six months ago. He's just under 6 feet tall, short straight hair, gentle voice. His favorite music was Bach. No one else saw him, but he brought a friend once for Thanksgiving. Dumar. He smoked a lot. He brought her a stuffed elephant.

Minelli tells Cho and Rigsby to follow up on the elephant. Van Pelt comes up with nothing on Roy Talliefero. Minelli tells her to try it in English. It means ""cut iron.""

Rosalind plays piano for Jane in the dark. He's near tears.

Van Pelt gets a hit on Cut Iron Properties.

The sheriff, chawing away on his nicotine gum, meets Jane and Lisbon. She tells him about the Cut Iron lead. Lisbon insists on a warrant and Jane says Red John's not going to trial, he's his. Lisbon says she's fed up with his egotistical trip, acting on his wounded pride. She's angry at him and storms off for the warrant. Jane gets the sheriff to take him to the property.

Cho and Rigsby check the 11th convenience store near Rosalind's house. It sold the elephant. They happen to still have the surveillance tape.

Jane and Sheriff Hardy reach the property.

Cho and Rigsby watch the tape. It shows Sheriff Hardy buying the elephant.

Meanwhile he follows Jane into a barn, carrying a very big shotgun. The sheriff finds a trap door and opens it to a room below.

Cho and Rigsby can't reach Lisbon or Jane.

Jane walks down into the cellar, followed by Hardy, who has the gun casually slung over his shoulder. Jane peers through a crack in the wall and sees Maya, alive and well. Then Hardy cocks and aims at Jane, who seems surprised.

Hardy asks him if he remembers the name Orville Tanner, Red John's first accomplice who was caught and jailed 10 years ago who has since died. He's Orville's son, Dumar. He's a close friend of Red John. He says Red John gave him Maya, the woman he loves. He says Red John got Emma in return. He wanted Jane, too, but Rosalind ruined it. They have plans for him. But before he can spell them out, Lisbon walks down the cellar stairs with a gun on him.

Hardy/Dumar realizes he's been had, that Lisbon never went for the warrant. Jane is mad that she came down before Red John got there. He knew it was him because Rosalind said Dumar was a heavy smoker. Jane checks the walls and finds a camera transmitting.

Someone watching has a good night vision scene of Dumar fighting with Lisbon and her getting him pinned on the ground just as the rest of the team arrives.

They free Maya.

Jane looks around the room, upset that Red John was there. He doesn't think Hardy will talk. He reminds Lisbon that they agreed she'd wait. He says if Hardy had killed him at least he'd have led him to Red John. She says his death wish is selfish, there are people who care about him and things worth living for.

Jane walks outside as Hardy wakes up on his stretcher. He surreptitiously takes a key out of his belt, uncuffs himself and steals a deputy's gun, killing him. He points the gun at Lisbon and has her dead to rights.

A shot rings out. Hardy falls. Jane looks at the smoking shotgun in his hand and throws it to the ground. He runs over to Hardy, who gets out the words ""Red John"" then ""shhh"" as he dies laughing.

Jane watches his only Red John lead die.

Maya is reunited with her parents. Jane watches the reunion he never got.

The season ends with Jane picking an orange and smelling it, finding something simple to love in life after all."

As he steps out the door he is reminded that he needs to bring home turkey. He heads to work and meets with many, many sick patients in a overcrowded clinic. One red headed woman in particular has very red, watery eyes, dripping nose and a slight but distinct twitching pinky finger. Dr. Singh goes home that evening; tired but to an obviously loving relationship with his wife. She doesn't mind that he forgot the turkey and he can just get it the next day. Fast forward: We are back in the hospital with the red headed woman from the day before but now her finger is twitching much faster. A day passes and she is much worse. More time passes and she is put into a containment room. Everyone around her is in a hazmat suits and Dr. Singh stands in the background unable to help as more and more people flood in with ""the sick"". It's a new plague; an epidemic. Newsfeed across every screen discuss how no one knows how to fix it and that everyone needs to stay in quarantine. Dr. Singh and his wife look out their window as helicopters, cars, people crying or screaming, and fires loudly play outside their home which is covered in plastic. A loud noise inside makes Dr. Singh look down the hall. He rushes to his wife who has fallen. He sees her finger is twitching. She has the sick! He rushes her past the fires, the people, and the barricades to the hospital where he worked. There are hoards of sick outside but they get in. We see Dr. Singh in a room alone looking scared with light tears in his eyes and on his face as he stares into nothing. A female medical staff member comes to the door looking confused and asks if he is a doctor because she needs one. Confused himself, he responds in a daze and follows her to the delivery area where at the baby viewing window a dozen parents are crying. We first see a small baby mixed with a Bald Eagle, then a porcupine, an ape, as the whole scene comes to view we realize that every infant is mixed with some animal. The Bald Eagle baby doesn't have arms but soft, fluffy wings protrude where arms should be. He has a beak like nose and mouth. All of them. Every baby in the world is born mixed with an animal.

Far away from the city a man holding a baby with deer like features (deer ears, soft fur on his nose and eyes) climbs high up a hill. He calls himself the boy's ""pubba"". Time passes quickly as the man builds a large fence around around an acre or two of land hidden in the woods. By the boy's 8th year, they have a beautiful farm and home where the father writes and illustrates famous books and gives them to the boy to read. He also knits him a toy dog and teaches him a mantra: What do you do if you hear a growl - I duck. What do you do if you see a person - I hide.

After a time it becomes clear that while the boy's father has taught him a lot, he also keeps a lot from him. When a plane flies over them releasing flyers saying there is a safe place for ""hybrids"", he hides it. When the boy asks about his mother after seeing a deer, he avoids the question. He instead tells him a tale in child storytelling fashion about how there was a ""sick"" that killed nearly everyone and that the outside world is filled with fires. If he leaves the fence, he will be hurt and caught by the bad people who want the world to keep burning."

She's covered with rose petals and has sunflowers over her eyes. We then cut to a party where a woman introduces the ""Master of the Macabre,"" Richard Castle, who has just released Storm Fall, the conclusion to his bestselling Derek Storm series. He laps up the attention, posing for pictures and signing autographs. Meanwhile, back at the dead woman's apartment, the police have arrived. The lead detective, Kate Beckett, is told that the victim is Allison Tisdale, a twenty-four-year old social worker. She was shot twice in the chest before being posed and Beckett realizes that she has seen this scene before; it's straight out of a Richard Castle novel, ""Flowers For Your Grave.""

Back at the party, Castle talks to his publisher (and ex-wife), the woman who introduced him before. She wants to know why he killed off Derek Storm. He says it's because writing Derek Storm isn't fun anymore but he can still write bestsellers. His publisher claims that she was told he hasn't written anything in months and that if she doesn't get a new manuscript within the next few weeks, the company will demand the return of his advance. Castle counters that he already returned it divorcing her. At the bar, his daughter, Alexis, is doing homework while his mother, Martha, orders a drink. Castle tells her to stop discussing his work with his publisher before she goes to flirt with an older gentleman. He then tells his daughter that he should be committed for allowing her to move in with them. When she complains that he shouldn't talk like that in front of her, Castle tells her she should go out and have some fun so she can have stories she can't tell her children. He goes on to talk about why he killed Derek, how bored he is with him and with the same old people and questions at the parties. He says that just once, he wants someone to come up and say something new. Detective Beckett then comes up and says she needs to ask him a few questions.

At the police station, Beckett interrogates Castle, citing his rap sheet (he once stole a police horse while nude). The charges were dropped because of his friendship with the Mayor. He tries to charm his way out, but Beckett doesn't respond. She shows him a picture of Allison Tisdale; Castle doesn't recognize her. She then shows him pictures of Martin Fisk, a lawyer who is also dead. Castle doesn't recognize him either. She then shows him pictures of the two crime scenes. Castle recognizes the scene as being from ""Flowers For Your Grave"" and Beckett says that Martin Fisk's body was found in a scene out of his book ""Hell Hath No Fury."" Castle says that Beckett must be a pretty big fan of his, commenting that only hard-core fans read those books. Beckett, flustered, asks if those fans ever write him any disturbing letters, saying that sometimes killers try to contact the object of their obsession. Castle mentions he already knows this as being familiar with psychopaths is an occupational hazard. He gives her permission to go through his fan mail before asking if he can have copies of the pictures, because having a copycat will make the other authors in his poker group jealous.

At home, Martha is singing and dancing to piano accompaniment while Alexis is in the kitchen doing homework wearing earplugs. Alexis asks him if he's in trouble, but Castle assures her that the police only want his help on a case. They discuss the two murders before they go to bed. In the morning, at the station, Beckett comes in with a box full of Castle's books. She gives them to two other detectives, Ryan and Esposito, to read so they will recognize any other copycat murder scenes. The books belong to Beckett and Ryan and Esposito tease for being such a fan. She later tells Esposito that she reads them because she's curious about how people can do these things to each other. Castle arrives, offering his help in the investigation. They go through his fan mail together in an interrogation room where Castle flirts a little with Beckett. She asks if he's there to annoy her. He says he wants to know why those people were murdered like that. That there is always a story that makes everything make sense. He points out that people like Bennett do not usually become cops. He reasons that something must have happened to someone she cared about and guesses that the case was never solved. Beckett, upset about how close his observations were, is silent and sad before finding a letter in which someone has drawn a picture that looks exactly like Allison Tisdale's murder.

Back at her desk, Beckett says that the lab got prints off of the letter but they don't know whose because the system is backlogged and it will take a week to find out. Castle promptly calls the Mayor and says that they will get their prints in an hour. As Beckett begins to chew him out for jumping the line, they get a call that there's been another murder. A girl, Kendra Pitney, is floating face-down in a pool in a prom dress with a knife in her back. They pull her out of the water and Castle, ignoring Beckett's orders to stay put, goes to talk to the Lanie, the Medical Examiner. She reveals that the girl was killed elsewhere and posed before Beckett drags Castle away to tell him that she expects him to obey her orders. He points out that if the killer was following his books, the dress should be blue. He asks if they've found a connection between the victims or a motive, but Beckett says that since they're dealing with a serial killer, it doesn't matter. She then gets a call that the fingerprints belong to a Kyle Cabot.

They pull up to his apartment and break down the door. Inside, they find newspaper articles about the killings along with drawings, letters, and Castle's books. In another room, the walls are covered with book covers, photos, and articles about Castle, which he finds to be creepy (he has once again ignored Beckett's order to stay put). Esposito finds Allison's blouse and the handgun that probably killed her. Kyle Cabot is found in a closet beating his head against the wall. In an interrogation room, he refuses to speak and Beckett says that he has Pervasive Developmental Disorder and that his caseworker was Allison Tisdale. Castle is not sure that Kyle is the killer as it makes for a poor story. Later that night, Beckett goes over the case while Castle plays poker with three author buddies. He is preoccupied thinking about the case, discussing it with the others as if it is a story he's working on. They, too, are dissatisfied with the ending, saying that the ""story"" needs a character that works to prove Kyle is innocent.

In the morning, Beckett catches Castle going through the files on her desk. He apologizes before giving her a gift and leaving. She starts to go about her day before becoming suspicious and realizing that he took the files related to the case. She finds him at the library and arrests him. As he's being led away, he calls back that the rose petals Allison was covered with were different than the ones in his book and that she should make a note of it since it means Kyle Cabot is innocent. Back at the station, Martha and Alexis are there to take him home. Captain Montgomery has agreed to drop the charges as long as Castle promises not to interfere in the case. Castle still insists that Kyle is innocent, though. This gets to Beckett and she goes back over the case, eventually coming to the same conclusion as Castle. He discusses the case with Martha and Alexis on the way home. He reasons that since Allison was the only one who knew anything about Kyle, she must have been the one the real killer wanted dead.

Castle goes to see Allison's father, arriving at the same time as Beckett. Allison's father says that she had no enemies, was not wealthy, but stood to inherit part of her father's estate when he died. Outside, Castle informs Beckett that Tisdale is dying; he was wearing make-up, was sickly thin, and was wearing a toupee. They go to interview Harrison Tisdale, Allison's brother. He says that she wanted to see the best in people and even tried to get Kyle Cabot a job at his company. Beckett gets him to admit that his father is dying and asks him where he was on the day of his sister's murder. He says he was out of the country for all three murders and shows them his passport. Back at the station, Ryan says that Harrison purchased three tickets out of the country that match up with the dates of the murders. Castle suggests that Harrison bought a second passport. Beckett orders Ryan and Esposito to keep an eye on Harrison and goes to get a search warrant for Harrison's home and office. Meanwhile, Harrison has gone home to shred the evidence.

When the police arrive, they tell Becket that Harrison's business is going under; that's his motive for murder. Before going in, she handcuffs Castle to the car to make sure he stays put this time. As soon as she's gone, he pulls a handcuff key out of his pocket only to drop it on the ground. Harrison puts the remaining evidence in a garbage bag and runs down the fire escape. Meanwhile, Castle sees Harrison coming down the fire escape, finally gets free, and calls Beckett to tell her about Harrison before running after him himself. Beckett runs after both of them, but by the time she catches up, Harrison has taken Castle hostage. Castle guesses that when Harrison asked his father for money, he refused, so he took revenge on his father by taking away Allison, the only thing he had ever loved. Castle then decks him and takes his gun. Beckett cuffs him and takes him away. When everything is over, Castle offers to take her out but she turns him down and walks away. He goes home and works on his new manuscript. The next day, Beckett gets called into Captain Montgomery's office. He tells her the Mayor called and that Castle has decided to base a character in a new series of books on her but needs to do research. She protests but the Mayor is okay with it and Montgomery agrees. How long the partnership lasts is up to Castle."

When Detective Beckett asks to see his research, Castle first tries to pass off reading to her from HOLY STORM as ""research"" - then introduces her to the Vodun practitioner friend who helped him with his research, a college-educated Nigerian Restaurant owner. When a second victim, a non-Black woman lawyer, is found dead by the same ritual, the case takes a more complicated turn. Beckett uncovers that the murder victim was a Nigerian student who had been working for a notorious Nigerian slumlord and businessman who has gone missing.

Meanwhile, Castle's first ex-wife, Meredith, a Hollywood actress described as ""Auntie Mame on Meth"", has blown back into New York City. After having wild sex with her ex-husband, she informs him she intends to move back permanently; and back into his and their daughter Alexis's lives. Nobody in the Castle household is happy about this development, including Alexis, who finds her mother to be a disruptive influence in her life, and Castle's mother, Martha, who sees in Meredith a younger and very unflattering mirror image. When Castle complains about Meredith to Beckett, she is highly unsympathetic when he describes her as his ""deep-fried Twinkie"" (something that's great once in a while, but you wouldn't want to have on a daily basis) and points out that he can't help but have sex with her because ""The thing with crazy people is, the sex is terrific!"""

Last winter, he came in late December and stayed ever since.

They go up to the cabin, and see the boat on the lake. Mike whistles to him, and the ""man"" turns around to reveal that he's an alien.

The alien pulls the boat ashore and when Mike asks if he's Harry, the alien takes on Harry's face, turns to the two officers, and says that's him. He asks why Mike wants him, and Mike says that there was a murder in town and since Harry is a doctor, they need him to look at the body. They don't have a town doctor because the town doctor is the victim. Harry drives into town, following the officers.

Four Months Ago

""Harry""'s ship crashes on Earth, struck by a lightning bolt. In order to survive and complete his mission, the alien went to the cabin. Inside, the real Dr. Harry Vanderspegle is reading a book, and looks up at the door blows open. He goes over and sees an alien footprint in the snow that blew in. Grabbing a poker, Harry looks around for whoever broke in, and the alien drops down behind him. Harry turns to see it and gasps, and the alien advances on him.

Harry hits the alien with the poker, and it shrugs off the blow and throws him out a window. It comes outside and they struggle, and it extends two tentacles from its chest, chokes Harry, and throws him into the lake below. The alien then goes back into the cabin and takes on Harry's form, moaning in pain as it does so.

Harry spends the next time watching TV and learning human mannerisms and language from ""Law and Order"". Harry then searches for the equipment on his crashed ship that he needs to complete his mission.

Now

Harry comes into Patience for the first time since he arrived on Earth, and prepares to face his first real test posing as a human. Inside the clinic, Mayor Ben Hawthorne introduces himself to Harry and thanks him for coming. He takes him to the office where the dead doctor is laying. Harry figures the doctor has been dead for at least six hours, going by the smell. The ""corpse"" comes to life, wonders what's going, and says that she was just sleeping.

Ben points out Dr. Sam Hodges' corpse, over to the side and covered by a sheet. He explains that the woman is Asta Twelvetrees, the nurse, and she found the body that morning. Harry introduces himself and says that Abigail was Sam's wife and she has been out of town. Liv tells him that she gave Abigail her number, so he could tell her that her father died. Asta says that she was the last person to see Sam alive, the previous night when she left. She covered Hodges with a sheet.

Harry examines the body and says that it's ""awesome"". He's fascinated by a mystery, like one on ""Law and Order"". He says that it was fun and tells everyone that he knows who killed Hodges: himself, judging from the blood and the angle of the wound. Harry doesn't know why Hodges killed himself.

Ben goes after Harry and tells him that they still need his help. Harry doesn't see why since Ben doesn't have any more dead bodies to show him. The mayor points out that they need to do an autopsy, and the state coroner has been cut off by the snowed-in roads. Ben knows that the real Harry used to run the pathology lab at Rutgers. Harry claims that he was making a job, and the mayor quickly walks off.

A mother is bringing her son Max down the street. Max sees Harry in his alien form, screams, and jumps in his mother's car.

In the morgue, Harry wonders how a human saw though his molecular reconstruction. Only one in a million human have the genetic mutation to do so, and the population of Patience is only 1,000. Asta comes in to assist Harry with the autopsy, and he wonders why she's there. Asta tells Harry that Hodges was her doctor since she was a kid, and she isn't going anywhere until she knows how he died.

Harry tells her to stand to the side and take notes. Asta doesn't trust Harry, and insists that everything indicates Hodges killed himself. She doesn't believe it, and says that she would have stabbed herself in the carotid artery. Harry wonders how he missed that, and performs the autopsy. He removes the organs and sniffs them, and afterward Asta thanks Harry for helping them and says that he did a job. When she compliments him, he says that she's a smarter than a panda and then says that he likes her brown skin.

Taken aback, Asta invites Harry to have a drink. He decides he has to fit in, so goes to have a drink with her. First he cuts Hodges' brain out of his hands and squishes it in his hands. Examining it, Harry thinks the brain is amazing. Abigail comes in and asks where Hodges is.

Later at the bar, Harry tells Asta what happened and that Abigail ran out. Asta says that Hodges' first wife was like a mother to her. Harry doesn't ask her about her childhood, and Asta explains that she married a biker when she was 16, and they split four months ago. Now she's buying Harry dinner because he has a pick-up truck, and she was hoping he'd help her move the rest of her stuff.

The bartender, D'arcy, comes over and says that she'll buy Harry dinner for less than that. Asta introduces her to Harry, and D'arcy is impressed that Harry is a doctor. She asks Asta if they found whoever killed Sam. When Harry asks about the mining equipment mounted on the walls, D'arcy says that it's concerning the 59, and offers a toast to the 59 and whoever killed Hodges. Harry joins in, having no idea what they're toasting. He gags on the local whiskey, and says that it's awful but he wants more. When he wonders why, D'arcy says that it's because he's bad and she likes bad boys.

They continue drinking, and they start dancing to the music in the bar. A surprised Harry joins in, and Asta and D'arcy cheer him on as the other bar patrons join in. Afterward, Asta asks Harry to meet her at the clinic at 10 the next morning, and rides off on her bike. Harry is happy that he managed to fit in perfectly as a human, then remembers Max seeing him as an alien. He figures that he'll break into Max's home and kill him.

Harry drives to Max's house, recognizing it by the car parked outside that he saw earlier. He takes on his alien form and climbs in through the window of Max's bedroom, and bumps into something. Max wakes up and looks around, but Harry hides and Max goes back to sleep. The alien grabs Max, muzzles him, and says that he's just going to kill him.

Max bites Harry's hand and screams. Harry hides under the bed, and Max's parents come in response to his screams. He says that there's an alien under his bed, and they figure that he's making things up and take him to their bedroom so he can sleep with them. Harry gives Max the finger as his mother takes Max out.

The next morning, the hungover Harry continues searching for his spaceship buried in the snow. He comes to the town mine, with a plaque saying that 59 died to save one.

In Patience, Mike and Liv sit in their car outside the clinic. They hum ""Amazing Grace"" together until Harry pulls up, and then Mike goes over and Liv says that Mike thinks Harry stole Hodges' body. Asta comes out, and Harry says that of course he took Hodges' body... and buried him in the snow behind the alley because he wouldn't fit in the freeze.

Jay arrives and says that she's done with the intake forms. Harry notes that she has a fly on her neck, and she irritably says that it's a birthmark, and he's a douchebag As Harry drives Asta to her house to help her move, she says that letting Jay help out at the clinic keeps her off the streets. Asta warns Harry that the town has an underbelly, and that's why she helps kids like Jay.

They arrive at Asta's house, and Harry stays in the truck. Once Asta goes in, Harry looks up what ""douchebag"" means and is shocked by the images. He then goes inside and notices a picture of a buck on the wall. Asta explains that Indians believe the buck protects people from everything. Once they're done, Asta thanks Harry for helping her move. Her ex-husband Jimmy is waiting, and figures that Harry is Asta's ""new man"". She insists that Harry isn't, and they just work at the clinic together. Jimmy tells Harry to go home while he and Asta catch up.

Harry says that isn't what Asta had in mind. Jimmy reveals the gun in his belt, and Asta tells Harry to go. He leaves, and she goes inside with Jimmy. Harry gets in his truck and drives off, figuring that Asta isn't his problem, and he should stay focused on his mission. Despite that, Harry goes back.

Parking in the house driveway, Harry goes up to the door and listens. Jimmy is complaining that she's making him look stupid. Harry smashes through the wall, pulls Jimmy out, and chokes him. Asta runs out and pulls Harry away, telling him that it's not worth it. Harry releases Jimmy and walks away, and Asta kicks Jimmy in the side, cursing him.

Harry drives into the woods with Asta, and stops the truck. She asks if he's going to tell him how he pulled Jimmy through a wall, and Harry claims ""yoga"". He asks why she wanted to come out there, and Asta removes her show and walks off in the snow to the edge of a cliff with a view of the mountains. Harry joins her, and Asta says that she's always been an outsider and figures Harry is as well because he's different. She knows what that feels like, and sometimes just feeling human is alien to her.

Harry agrees, and wonders why she would marry Jimmy. Asta admits that she doesn't know, and says that she got pregnant when she was 16. Jimmy convinced her to give the child up for adoption, and Jimmy always reminded her that she did the right thing. Asta felt like if she left Jimmy, she gave the baby up for nothing. Four months ago, Asta had enough, drove off, and never came back. She goes back to the truck, leaving Harry to look at the mountains.

Later, the townspeople gather for Hodges funeral. Harry arrives and approaches Ben, and asks why everyone is calling him and thinks he's the new town doctor. Ben says that it's the townspeople's right to have medical care, and he had therapy sessions with Hodges and wants to have the same therapy with Harry.

After Ben leaves, Asta comes over and tells Harry that he's a breath of fresh air. Harry gets an idea, goes to the coffin, and opens it. Asta tries to pull him away, and Harry sniffs the body and tells Asta that he has to check the body now.

Asta pulls him away, and Harry says that Hodges cut at his throat because he needed air. He tried to give himself a tracheotomy, but couldn't do it in time. Asta wonders why Hodges would have his throat close up, and Harry says that he was poisoned and one of the mourners is his killer.

Four Months Ago

The alien's mission was to drop the device on Earth and head back home. At the same time, Asta stormed out of her house, found her car keys in the snow, and saw the spaceship pass overhead. When Jimmy comes out over Asta, she gets in her car and drives off. Crying, she finally stops the car and sees a buck on the road behind her

Now

The next day, Harry learns that when the mine caved in, one man was trapped. Fifty-nine went back in and died trying to save him.

Harry finds part of his mission,, marked ""Full Extinction Event"", and figures that when he finds the rest of it, he can kill all of the humans.

Later, Harry goes to his clinic. Asta puts his new doctor's coat on him and tells him that he has a patient in the waiting room. Harry goes in and discovers that it's Max, who screams when he sees Harry as an alien."

A hiker is out in the wildness, and takes a selfie. He slips and almost falls over a cliff, but stops in mid-air just before he hits the ground. The hiker hovers in mid-air and yells for help.

Harry digs in the snow and finds a plate from his device while looking for it. He goes to work as the Patience clinic as the town's new doctor, and discovers Max is his first patient. He screams and runs out, and his father Max is on the street. Kate chases after Max and tells Ben that his son went out the window. Ben joins the pursuit,

In the clinic, Asta comes in and wonders what happened. Harry tells her that Max went berserk, leaped out the window, and ran away. He claims that he has no idea why, and remembers threatening to cut Max's head off with a bonesaw. Harry suggests that Max has emotional issues, and Asta reminds Harry that they need to get it cleaned up because there are patients coming in. Harry walks off.

Kate and Ben try to get Max out from a park bench, and he tells his parents that the alien from his bedroom is the town's new doctor. Kate points out that Harry didn't look like an alien to her, and Max figures that Harry got into her brain. The boy finally comes out and take Max back to Harry to look at his sore throat. Ben offers to take Max back after his exam, and Max figures that they're both going to die. Max walks off, and Kate jokingly tells her husband that if he keeps over-reacting to Harry, they're going to get rid of him.

In the town hall, Ben brings Max in and finds Mike and Liv moving boxes from the sheriff's office. Mike tells him that he has to make around for murder stuff so he has to make room. Max wants to file a murder complaint against Harry for killing Sam, and says that Harry is an alien. Ben says that Max is delusional, and Mike threatens to law Max up for lying to an officer of the law. He tells Max to watch season 1 of 'Oz' and consider whether he wants to go to prison.

Once Ben and Mike leave, Liv tells Max that Mike sometimes seems mean but he's just a teddy bear. She suggests that Harry is putting up some kind of mind shield that only Max can see through, and offers to use her abilities as a sketch artist to make a picture. Max eagerly gives her a description.

Harry figures that since he was a scientist on his planet, he can easily pretend to be a human doctor. He checks a pregnant woman, Judy, and Asta tells Harry that Judy needs pelvic exam. Harry is less than thrilled, and she irritably tells Harry to get done with the exam so she can put her pants back on. Harry finds an ""earring"", and Judy tells him that it's supposed to be there. He checks the Internet on his phone and accidentally takes a photo, then claims that it's a selfie of his first day. Asta comes back in as Harry takes a selfie, and continues examining patients. He's not very calming.

Laster, Asta takes Harry to the diner where her father Dan works. Dan immediately walks away, and Asta tells Harry that her father likes doctors. She talks to Dan privately, and he says that there's something wrong with Harry. Asta points out that he has a bad feeling about every man who gets within 10' of her, and Dan tells her that he doesn't feel anything at all from Harry.

Harry wonders if Dan can tell that he's different, and figures the day can't get any worse. He finds posters of his real face on telephone poles. That night, Harry collects the posters, goes home, and complains to himself that Max just won't give up. He can't leave and won't turn into someone else, given all the effort he put into making the Harry body work properly.

Calling the Hawthornes, Harry uses a fake kid's voice, pretend to be one of Max's classmates, and tells Max that he saw the alien leaving town so Max doesn't have to worry about him anymore. Max doesn't know any such kid, and Harry claims that he's a postman. He claims he has a kid's voice because of a tricycle answer, and soon figures out Harry is really Harry. Max tells Harry that his parents know he's seen an alien, and if Max dies they'll know something is up. Harry calls Max a ""little shit"", and Max hangs up.

The next day, Harry goes to the clinic and finds a young baby, Safe, sitting in the hall. He -pokes the baby with a crutch, and the baby laughs. Asta comes out with Sage's mother, her cousin Kayla. Kayla leaves with Sage, and Kay comes up and Asta makes her apologize for calling him a douchebag. He apologizes that her birthmark looks like a bug. Kay calls him a douchebag, and Asta has Kay set Harry him up in the nurse's office because she doesn't want anyone in Sam's office.

As they go, Asta tells Kay that she there if Kay wants someone to talk to, she's there for her and she knows it's hard to talk when she's sad. Kay says that she isn't sad and walks away. Harry overhears Asta and asks why she has trouble talking when she's sad. Asta explains that she moved out because she and Dan didn't get along very well, and she moved back because she missed home. She says that she doesn't know where Harry is from and asks him where he's from, and Harry says that he's hungry and leave.

Outside, Harry contemplates how he feels empty but the feeling doesn't go away when he eats. He goes over to the bar and remembers that D'arcy was the woman he danced with previously. She insults a client when he asks for a napkin, and then asks Harry if he wants anything. He says that he wanted to go there but doesn't, and D'arcy offers him some of the local whiskey. Harry talks about how he almost killed someone he drank, and says that he's killed before. He tries to pass it off as a joke, and D'arcy jokingly tells him that he should make murder look like an accident. Harry feels that's a great idea, and accidentally accepts D'arcy's invitation to take her bowling.

The next day at their home, Harry meets with Ben for psychotherapy and imagines ways to kill Max and make it look like an accident. Ben points out that Sam wasn't qualified, and the town is lucky that the real Harry started his life as a clinical therapist. The mayor talks about how he often considers wanting to be a child again, and mentions the pit in his stomach. Harry takes an interest, and Ben isn't very helpful.

Abigail comes in and wants to know if Harry thinks Sam was murdered. When she leaves, Harry returns to the topic of Ben's ""hole in his stomach"". Asta and Abigail argue as Abigail clears out Sam's office, and Harry goes in and tells them to be quiet. Asta discovers that Harry ate Sam's chicken from the refrigerator, and Harry is disgusted that humans let emotions override their actions... and wonders if he can get the discarded chicken while they're fighting.

Asta and Harry find Mike outside his office asks him what he's doing about Sam's murder. Mike says that he confirmed Abigail has an alibi for the night Sam died, and he has all the evidence from Sam's office. She tells Asta to stay in her line, while Harry reads their emotions on their faces.

Four Months Ago

Harry's ship crashes, and he goes to a nearby barn and feeds directly from a cow's teat.

Now

As Harry drives away, he wonders if he's infected with human emotions. He goes to the barn and drinks from the cow, and the wife there finds him and Harry quickly leaves.

That night, Harry goes bowling with D'arcy. He notices that she's dyed her hair, and they go to get some shoes. Judy is the clerk, and D'arcy and Judy throw insults at each other. When they go to an alley, Mike approaches them and says that he ""leagues it up"" with his boys on Tuesday and Thursdays. He shows them how it's done and bowls a strike.

D'arcy takes him up on her challenge and bowls a strike. Harry throws his ball into Mike's groin, much to D'arcy's amusement. Mike is not amused and hobbles off.

Harry and D'arcy go to get something to eat, and they talk about embarrassment while Harry tries to figure out how to eat a chili dog. He asks D'arcy how long it will take the snow on the mountain to meet, and she says that it could be a week. Harry tells her not to go skiing, and D'arcy talks about how she used to be an Olympic-level skier but broke her leg and almost died. Harry figures that's great and abruptly leaves. Judy comes by and exchange insults with D'arcy, and they go bowling. Meanwhile, Harry goes to the Hawthorne house and sabotages the brakes on Max's bike.

The next day, Harry meets with an elderly patient, Gerard, who complains that Sam used to tell him not to eat bad food. Harry casually says that Gerard has ten things that will kill him quicker than food. Asta motions to Harry to keep silent, and Harry tells Gerard that he can eat anything he wants because it won't make any difference. Gerard is happy that Harry is being honest with him. Afterward, Asta tells Harry that Gerard usually doesn't like anyone.

Kay comes in and says that Ben brought Max in, and there's been an accident. Ben comes in and Harry assumes that Max is dead. Max comes in with Ben, who says that Max will probably need stitches because he lost control of his bike in the driveway.

Ben isn't thrilled with the sight of blood and leaves, and Harry takes over. He inadvertently reveals that he knew the bike's brakes failed, and offers to give Max Novocain for ""good boys"". Max whispers that he won't be, and Harry tosses away the Novocain and does the stitching. Max insists that it's fine despite the pain, and Harry does more stitches. The boy dares him to do more, and doesn't break even when Harry digs his fingers into the wound. Max claims that he didn't feel anything, and tells Harry that he can take care of himself before leaving with his father.

That night at Dan's house, Dan makes Asta dinner and tells her that she could cut her hair to honor Sam. Asta says that she could handle it, and Dan should let her live her own life. He hopes that she's just upset when Sam dies. After dinner, Asta lies on her bed and looks at a photo of her and Sam together. She grabs a case and goes downstairs, gives Dan a pair of scissors from the case, and he cuts her hair shorter. Dan gives the hair to Asta and she holds it, then puts the hair in a bag in the case. Dan tells her that she should burn her scrubs to release Sam's spirit.

The next morning, Asta rides her bike to work. She gets to the clinic and looks at Sam's empty office, and sits in a chair and looks at Sam's empty chair. She remembers coming and giving Sam some files, and discussing a hypochondriac woman's crush on him. He invites her to play gin rummy, but Asta begs off.

In the present, Harry sees Asta sitting in Sam's office. Asta tells Harry that Dan isn't her real father, and her mother left when she was 1 and Dan took her in. She never felt like she could fit in, and Sam was the only one she could talk to about it. Asta says that she should have never left the night Sam died, and he was always there for her. Harry points out that Sam was poisoned and Asta couldn't have helped him, and she figures that Sam wouldn't have tied alone. Harry invites Asta to play cards, and she agrees.

Harry goes to put his stuff fin his office, and Asta says that it's his office. She deals the cards, and Harry sits down and realizes that he can feel Asta's emotions even though he shouldn't be able to feel it.

That night, Harry makes his way to the mine and goes inside. He finds a piece of tellurium, take it back to the real Harry's cabin, and considers how humans are bonded together by emotions of love and sadness. He wonders if he's more connected to humans as he melts the tellurium. Harry realizes that his ache went away when he found the tellurium, and figures the ache is loneliness. he forges the a disc from the tellurium, makes an anti-gravity disk from it, and figures that he can eventually fly home to his home planet and relive his loneliness.

The next day, two snowmobilers find the hiker's frozen body floating above the debris from Harry's spaceship."

Harry lies in his bed, not needing to sleep, and waits for 6 am. It's 3:26. He considers how much he has to do, finding the body, finding the device, finding the pieces of his ship that broke off, find Max, exterminate the human race, and get milk and cereal. Unable to sleep, Harry checks the Internet for information on how to become a better doctor. When 6 a.m. comes around, Harry gets up.

Two snow patrol members from Promise are out in the woods and gossiping. They stop and each toss dynamite .

Harry is busy digging in the snow, and finds the third piece of his ship. He hears the dynamite go off, sees snow cascading down the hills, and takes cover beneath a tree as the avalanche goes by. A helicopter flies overhead, and Harry realizes that he's not alone.

Back at the cabin, Harry works out on his map of the area that the avalanche covering his search area has set him back at least a week. Kate arrives at his door and introduces herself, and asks if she can come in. Harry eventually lets her in, and she says that Max told her that Harry is an alien, and broke into his bedroom and tried to kill him.

Harry secretly grabs a knife and moves toward Kate. She turns her back to Harry, and as he raises the knife, Kate wonders why Max is making things up. Harry hides the apple he's testing his anti-gravity device on, and Harry assures her that he's not an alien. Kate shows Harry the pictures of the alien that Max has drawn, and doesn't know what to do. She asks Harry that there's anything they can do, and Harry suggests that the Hawthornes move. Kate points out that she and Ben have jobs and they're not moving.

Dismissing his comment as a joke, Harry suggests that Max is just looking for attention. Kate agrees with Harry, and admits that she works during the day. Harry abruptly tells her that it's her fault and she can go, and pushes Kate out the door as she goes.

In Patience, Max discovers that his pictures of Harry have been torn down. Harry is waiting nearby and greets him, and tells Max that no one believes him. They exchange insults and Max goes to school.

At the clinic, Ellen asks Asta to get some prescription pads. Ellen finds them in Sam's desk, but realizes that one is missing and goes to see Harry. He's watching Jay sleep on a couch, and he tells Asta that he wants sleep so badly and explains that he's trying to learn how to sleep. Asta tells him to stop watching Jay sleep because it's creepy, wakes Jay up, and asks if the teenager has seen Sam's prescription pad that is missing. Jay hasn't seen it, and walks out. Harry has been listening in, and Asta asks why he can't sleep. He says that he can't find the on-off switch in his brain. Liv comes in and says that they need Harry at the town hall because they found a dead body in the lake.

Harry and Asta go to the town hall, where Mike is addressing the townspeople who have heard about the body. When Harry asks D'Arcy if they found his leg, D'Arcy tells him that it was a foot, not Harry's leg. She suggests that Harry be a little more sensitive about discussing bodies, and then asks if they can see the foot. Ben says that it's an ongoing investigation. Harry figures that the foot belongs to the real Harry.

Mike tells everyone that the recently lost Sam, and finding the foot means it's a good thing because they're dealing with a serial killer. It's a good thing because serial killers don't run away and hide, but wait to strike again. He figures the serial killer is in the room looking for his next victim. Mike says that they'll run DNA testing on the foot, and Harry figures that if they confirm the foot's DNA then they'll realize he isn't the real Harry. Ben asks Harry if he has anything to add, and Harry says that he's scared.

At school, a bully knocks Max's bag out of his hand. Max's tinfoil hat falls out, and the bully walks off knocking a bag out of Sahar's hands. Max picks up his things and goes over to Sahar, and helps her pick up her bag. She stares admiringly after him.

At the town hall, Harry looks at the severed foot on ice. Liv figures that a boat propeller hit the body and cut the foot off. She jokingly says that she'd think it was Harry's if he didn't have two feet, and says that the medical examiner will let them know if he gets a hit on the DNA. Liv talks about how she did a DNA test on herself, and discovered that her father's best friend is her father. She doesn't recommend the tests.

Once Liv leaves, Harry grabs the bucket with the iced foot in it and goes to the clinic. He matches the foot against ""his"" foot, trying to see if they're the same. Harry figures that it is his foot. Asta comes in to Harry's office, and he hastily tosses the foot aside. She tells Harry that the Briscoes are there for their appointment and leaves. Mike comes in and accuses Harry of stealing the foot and Liv's favorite bucket. Harry says that he can help because he's a pathologist, and Mike tells him to run the DNA sample. When mike refers to the serial killer as a ""he"", Harry suggests that the killer could be a woman and Mike is being sexist. Mike doesn't care and tells Harry that he'll wait until Harry gets him the sample.

Harry goes to an exam room where the Briscoes are waiting with their baby. He sees a poster about circumcision and gets an idea, and decides to cut the foreskin off the baby and give it to Mike as the supposed skin sample.

The baby has been sick for two days, and Harry checks its chest and then asks if it's circumcised. Asta tells Harry that he doesn't need to check the baby, and Harry talks about the virtues of circumcision. Later, Harry gives the foreskin to Mike and claims it's the foot sample. Mike takes the sample and the bucket, and leaves.

At the school, Mike is eating lunch by himself. Kate, a teacher at the school, sit down with her son and Max says that he can't be seen hanging out with his mother. She insists on sitting with him, even when Max offers to pay her to leave. Kate tells Max that she loves him, much to his disgust, and leaves after kissing him on the head. The other kids see the whole thing and laugh, and one of them throws one of the Max's alien posters at Max. Sahar comes in and sees what happens, and sits down with Max. She tells Max that she believes him.

Harry returns to the cabin, and finds Mike, Liv, ben, and divers on the beach. Mike says that they're searching for the body. Ben says that they don't have a budget to keep searching the lake, and Mike says that they're not going to stop searching the lake until they find the body.

At the clinic, D'Arcy comes in and tries to cheer Asta up after Sam's death. She tells Asta that maybe she needs to get her mind off of it by going out with her They go to the lake beach, start a fire, and have some beers while watching the search party look for the body. D'Arcy figures that they have a ""live show"" with a bloated corpse as a finale, and talks about the man she was dating ghosted her and she's hoping he's on the search party so she can get some closure.

D'Arcy points out that J.T. is having a party later, and Asta talks about how they got out of Promise and chased their dreams. Her friend points out that reality chased them back.

Ben is on Liv's search boat, and as she comes in for the night, Ben starts throwing up. He tells Mike over the radio that he's seasick, and Harry on-shore listens in. Mike tells Ben and Liv to continue the search, and Harry worries.

Four Months Ago: New Mexico

A rider, Roy, sees Harry in his alien form walking away from the crash site, and his horse rears up and throw him. Roy panics when Harry approaches him, and runs off abandoning his horse. Harry picks up Roy's dropped hat, mounts the horse, and rides off.

Now

As night falls, Asta and D'Arcy continue watching and D'Arcy notices Harry's cabin nearby. She says that Harry reminds her of Danny Oliver, the guy who took Asta to prom. The two women start dancing like they did at prom.

Liv tells Mike over the radio that the body may have already washed up. Mike figures Ben is still sick, and tells Liv to stay on mission. Harry, listening on the radio, figures Mike isn't going to give up and works out a cover story about the body being his twin brother, Frederico. The real Harry's body washes up on the shore, and Harry spots it and goes over to it. He drags the body into his cabin and inside, as Asta and D'Arcy come in and call out to Harry, asking if he's home.

Harry tosses the body behind the couch and asks why they're there. Asta asks if they can use his bathroom, and Harry directs them to it and says they have to leave because he's busy. Once the two women go to the bathroom, Harry drags the body to the cellar.

D'Arcy goes through Harry's medicine cabinet, and discovers that he sorts his vitamins alphabetically. Asta and D'Arcy come out as Harry returns, and D'Arcy tells him that they're going to a party and he's not invited that her ex J.T. is having. She tries to flirt with Harry, who has no idea what she's doing. Asta drags D'Arcy out, and outside D'Arcy tells Asta that Harry is jealous but hiding it.

At the party, Asta and D'Arcy meet up with their high school friend Lisa. High schoolers are there, and Lisa realizes that Asta invited her to a high-school party. Lisa isn't thrilled, and D'Arcy ends up dancing with a high schooler without initially seeing his face. When she does see his face, she sees his braces and realizes that it's a high-school party. Asta and Lisa come over and tell her that J.T. has a son named J.T.

A stoner offers them pills, and Asta realizes that they have Sam's name on the bottle. The prescription was written after Sam died, and Asta tells the stoner that she's taking them with her. The stoner backs off, and as the women leave Asta sees Jay passed out in a chair. Asta wakes Jay up and wakes her up. They drive Jay home, and Asta gives Jay cedar to burn to meditate, that Dan gave her.

Jay goes inside, and Asta remembers the past and Sam taking her and a baby to the same house. Sam takes the baby to the waiting couple, while a young Asta watches and breaks into tears. D'Arcy asks Asta if she's okay, and Asta only says that they should get out of there.

Mike and Liv come ashore and go to Harry's cabin. He answers the door when they knock, and Mike tells him that they will come back in the morning to continue the search. Mike's police dog Cletus runs into the house, barking, and runs to the cellar with the body in it when he picks up the scent. The others chase after Cletus, and finds him pawing at a freezer. Mike opens the top and finds packages of bison meat inside. The officers leave, unaware that the real Harry's body is beneath the packages of meat.

The next morning, Asta finds Dan in the kitchen. He's making breakfast for his daughter, and watches her as she eats. Asta finally tells him that her baby was a girl and breaks into tears, and she thought the baby would be better off without her. Dan tells her that the bond between a mother and daughter can never be broken. The connection between Asta and her daughter will eventually bring them back together, and Asta nods in agreement.

At the town diner, Asta goes to get some coffee and runs into Harry. He shows her that he's been buying padlocks and she admits that she's done the same, and Asta jokingly wonders who he is. Asta leaves and Harry sits down to eat. Max and Sahar come in, and Max points Harry out to Sahar. She says that she needs to get a closer look at him, goes over, and spills Harry's water in his lap. The two kids run out, and Harry looks out the window and sees them both.

At the clinic, Asta puts a lock on the desk drawer where the prescription pads are kept.

At the cabin, Harry locks the freezer lid shut and then puts another padlock on the cellar door. He then goes to his bedroom, puts on Roy's cowboy hat, and goes to sleep.

Somewhere in New Mexico

At a bar, Roy tells the two about how he stood up to the alien he met and kicked his alien ass. Roy admits that the alien got away with his horse and his hat, The couple say that they like going around talking to other alien experiencers, saw Roy's online videos, and knew they had to talk to Roy. The woman confirms where Roy saw the alien and where he was headed. Roy tells the couple that they can read all about it in the book he's writing.

Later, Roy goes out to his truck and the woman breaks his neck and takes the book. The man arrives and says that their orders say not to kill people. The woman tells him that she has different orders."

Going outside, Harry finds Mike, Liv, and the rest of the police still searching the nearby lake. Liv tells Harry that they switched their search to the shore based on the currents, and Mike can feel it in his balls. Henry inadvertently makes a joke about Mike's balls.

Later in town, Harry goes to the diner to eat and think about humans need companionship to eat. Ben joins Harry and tells him that they're getting closer to finding a town doctor. He invites Harry over to dinner with him and his wife Kate, hoping that it will their son Max a chance to see Harry in a more comfortable setting like their home. Ben takes Harry's silence as an answer and leaves.

Nearby, Asta is at a table, and D'Arcy sees her with a bottle of pills and sits down. Asta says that the she got the bottle at the party and they're dated after Sam died. She figures someone at the party is connected to Sam's stolen prescription pad. D'Arcy figures that it was obviously Jay, but Asta doesn't believe it. They argue about who was stupider when they did stupid things when they were 17, and Harry comes over asks Asta to come with him to the dinner date, so that he can sit alone while Asta talks to them.

Asta says that it's weird and she's busy, and D'Arcy kicks Asta until she suggests D'Arcy might go with Harry. She tells him that she'd be glad to go, and Harry accepts.

Later, Asta finds Jay sleeping in the break room. She wakes the teenager up and talks about the dumb things she did when she was a teenager. Asta finally tells Jay about the missing pad, and Harry comes in and asks what's going on. Jay tells him that Asta thinks she stole the pad, and even Harry figures it's obvious that Jay stole it. When Jay out, Harry pockets the food Asta bought Jay and leaves.

Later, Max returns home. Kate and Ben tell him that Harry is coming over to dinner. Before they say anything, he figures they're getting a divorce. His parents assure him they're not, and that Harry is coming to dinner. Max panics, wishes they were just getting a divorce, and goes up to his room.

In his room, Max packs to run away and calls Sahar on a walkie-talkie. She answers and Max says that he'll be dead soon. Sahar figures they can use the visit and her plan to break into Harry's cabin.

That night, Harry and D'Arcy arrive. Max is waiting and greets Harry cordially enough. As he hugs Harry, he secretly steals Harry's truck key.

Kate is surprised and apparently thrilled to see D'Arcy there. D'Arcy hugs Harry and says that he's very into he.

Sahar is outside, and Max calls her on the radio and tells her that he has the keys. Sahar checks Harry' truck and accidentally honks the horn, then finds the cabin's door keys. She rides off, and Max goes to the dining room. Harry wonders what Max is up to, and Ben asks about Harry's background. He claims that he's from New York City, and recites the opening dialogue from the show he's watched, 'Law & Order' and ""Sex and the City'.

D'Arcy tells Max that she's know Ben since they were younger than Max when they met. The two of them laugh over elementary school memories, and D'Arcy says that Ben was her first kiss. Kate has never heard the story, and D'Arcy jokingly points outs that they never broke up. Ben jokingly says that he's been cheating on D'Arcy with Kate, and Kate goes to the kitchen to get more salad. Meanwhile, Harry glares at Max and Max smiles innocently.

Sahar goes to a nearby store where Mike and Liv are buying ""evidence bags"". Mike is buying Hot Wheels cars, and Mike insists that he's keeping some kid from buying it, chasing it out into traffic, and getting killed. Sahar tells Liv that she's buying tampons, and looks at the long line to the key-making machine at the counter.

Ben joins Kate in the kitchen and tells her that dinner is a success. Kate thinks it's weird Ben never told him that he never made out with D'Arcy. Ben says that it was no big deal. D'Arcy comes in to get some wine, and Ben hugs Kate. After D'Arcy mentions talks about how they used to sit on the coach when they were in 10th grade, she grabs the wine and leaves.

Since they're alone, Harry asks Max why the boy is being so nice to him. Max says that Harry didn't mean it, and Harry insists that he did.

Sahar finally gets to the counter.

Max goes to the door but doesn't see Sahar outside. Ben calls him back for dessert, and D'Arcy discovers the wine is gone. Max says that Harry and D'Arcy can't leave, and he wants to show them his solar system. He shows it to everyone, and Harry laughs hysterically when he says that he made a joke earlier about Mike's balls. Max stalls for time until Sahar gets back, offering to read his book report.

Sahar finally gets the key copied and rides back to the house.

D'Arcy dozes off from boredom while Max reads his book report, and Kate thanks Harry for coming. She's not so enthused about D'Arcy coming back. As they go out, Max grabs Harry's leg and begs him not to go. Kate pries her son away, and D'Arcy hugs her ""sisterwed"" goodbye. Kate and Ben go back in the house, and Max peers out the window looking for Sahar. In the truck, Harry considers if Max really likes him. He finds his house keys where he hid them, and drives off.

Sahar comes out of hiding and holds up the duplicate keys so Max can see them.

Harry drives D'Arcy home and she asks if he's going to kiss her. The alien figures he can do it. He ends up licking her face, and D'Arcy says it's not the worst kiss she's had. As she goes, Harry wonders why his penis is having rigor mortis.

The next day, Dan comes into the clinic and tells Asta that her grandmother called. Dan asks if they can take her a steroid shot for her back, and wants Asta to go instead of Harry. Harry doesn't want to go, and Asta doesn't want either of them to go. She leaves, and Dan glares at Harry.

At the sheriff's office, Mike and Liv go over everything they've dredged from the lake. Liv points out the doorknob that the alien Harry ripped from the real Harry's door, but Mike doesn't think it's important and thinks it came from a sunken houseboat.

Dan drives Harry and Asta to the reservation, and Harry is surprised to learn that humans can be with each other and not talk. He's happy, and says that he has to pee. Dan stops at a gas station. David and Lisa are in a RV there, and Dave points out that Lisa killed the cowboy they were questioning. Lisa points out that the authorities ruled it a simple robbery, and reminds David that their orders are to deliver an alien to the General without anyone knowing about it.

David isn't convinced, and Lisa admits that things are going to get messy. She says that she's eliminating anything that gets in the way of their mission, and that could include David if he doesn't stop whining. David storms out and goes to the restroom, where Harry is reliving himself. Harry asks David if he shivers when he pees, and David admits that sometimes he does. Once Harry leaves, David wonders what the conversation was about.

Dan continue driving to the Ute Reservation, and Kayla greets Asta and Dan, and Harry when he comes over. Kayla introduces her husband Shane, and the guests greet Harry as well. Harry realizes that it's company that brings humans together, not food, and thinks the human feeling to belong feels good to him.

Harry, Dan, and Asta go to Asta's grandmother Ruth's bedroom. Asta introduces Harry and he prepares the steroid shot.

Max and Sahar are riding their bikes down the highway, and Mike comes up behind them in his jeep, turns on his lights, and tells them to pull over. The kids do so, and Mike tells them that they turned without their hand signals. Sahar claims that they saw Bigfoot, and Mike is happy that they're outside instead of staring at a TV. He tells them to go and be safe, gets in his jeep, and drives off.

Liv goes to the bar and D'Arcy serves her a drink. The deputy questions if she deserves to exist, and talks about how everyone was in the bar cheering D'Arcy on when she was in the Olympics. Liv assures D'Arcy that she put Patience on the map, and she just needs one person cheering for her when Mike makes her feel dumb. D'Arcy tells Liv that she's the best cop she's ever seen, and should stand up to Mike.

Harry gives Ruth the steroid injection, and she tells Harry that she can tell he's there to do good things. When Ruth sees Asta with her nephew, she says that Asta should have a child of her own. Harry mentions that Jay is Asta's daughter, much to Dan's surprise. Asta breaks into tears and runs out.

Kayla follows Asta as she goes to her old childhood lean-to, and tells her sister that Asta gave up her kid, never told Dan, and Jay has spent her time wondering who she is. Asta's sister tells her that her secret is going to hurt a lot of people when it comes out, and Asta tells Kayla that she was too young to take care of Jay when she had her. Kayla says that she admired Asta making a difficult decision, holds her, and says that Asta did what a mother does by putting Jay's needs ahead of her own.

The local kids are playing basketball, and Harry joins them. The ball lands near him, and he tosses it back to them, putting it through the hoop. They applaud and Harry plays with them. He's not very good.

Max and Sahar get to Harry's cabin and use the duplicate key to get in. After giving Sahar a tin-foil hat to wear, he puts on one of his own, and they search the place.

Asta finds Dan, and he asks her how she couldn't tell him that Jay was his granddaughter. She says that Dan wanted him out as soon as he learned she was pregnant. Dan tells her that no one ever told her to go, and he hated the way Jimmy treated Asta. Asta says that it wasn't any of Dan's business, and he insists that it was. He says that her family would have been there, especially for him, and Asta tells him that he raised one child that wasn't his own and didn't want him to have to raise another. When his daughter asks, Dan assures her that they'll always be okay, and they hug.

At the cabin, Max and Sahar go down to the basement and find the ship wreckage that Harry has recovered. Sahar tries to open the locked freezer, and Max finds the apple hovering over the tellurium. He calls Sahar over, and when she touches the apple the backlash knocks both kids unconscious.

The basketball game goes into the night, and Harry manages to make a shot... for the other team. Tired, Harry bows out and wonders if he's going to die from overheating. He collapses in a nearby field and looks up at the sky, and sees his home planet's sun 46 light years away. Harry feels closer to it, and Asta comes over and Harry says that the basketball players are incredible specimens.

Asta lies down next to Harry and tells him what Dan says about the Big Dipper. Harry apologizes for telling her secret about Jay, and Asta tells him that he did them a favor. He says that he misses home and has a wife there, but she died do he took a job that brought him to Patience. Harry tells Asta that he wants to go home, and says that it's sad... now.

Present Day

The alien Harry drives his truck and is offended that Max pretended to be his friend so he could steal his keys and break into his cabin.

Max wakes up in a dark closet. Kate finds him and complains that Ben didn't look for their missing son there. She figures Max went to sleep in there, because he camps out there sometimes. Max remembers what happened at the cabin and plays along.

Mike and Liv arrive in response to the parents' call, and Max's parents tell them that Max turned up in the closet. When Mike says that he caught Max riding his bike out on the hallway, Ben and Kate tells Max he's not allowed to ride that far from home. Max says that he had a good reason, and had to break into Harry's cabin while he was at work. The boy says that he has proof that Harry is an alien, that Harry has alien technology in his basement. Max says that Sahar everything.

When Sahar and her mother get called over, Sahar says that she didn't see anything. She claims that she doesn't remember going to the cabin, and apologizes to Max for not remembering.

Harry returns home and finds Isabelle still there, wearing nothing but his flannel shirt. He tells her that she can't wear that because it's a man's shirt. Isabelle tells Harry that she flew across the country to talk to him, and he left and drove away. She asks where Harry went, and he claims that he went to get milk. Isabelle points out that he doesn't have any milk, and Harry says that he drank it.

Isabelle looks Harry over and asks what's different about him. He says that it's his mustache that he grew and then shaved off, and Isabelle wonders if he's high. Harry says that he is, and Isabelle tells him that she's very cross with him. The alien points out that she sounds like James Bond, and Isabelle says that she was ready to sign the divorce papers and then he stalled the lawyers. Isabelle tells him to sign the papers and hands them to him, and Harry immediately agrees to do so. She says that she thought they could talk about it like humans, and storms off into Harrys' bedroom rather than get a motel room.

Later, Isabelle gets into the sleeping Harry's bed and holds him. He wakes up and wonders what happens, and plays dead. Harry figures that it's nice, and figures that he can sleep after all. Then, Isabelle starts snoring. A lot.

The next morning, Harry wakes up and finds Isabelle performing yoga in front of him. She says that she turned off the alarm, and Harry says that he has to go to his job. Harry explains that he's now the town doctor, and asks Isabelle to take out the trash before she goes home. Going out to his truck, Harry realizes that he's late to searching the mountain and dismisses Isabelle as a distraction.

At the diner, Mike eats with his father, Lewis. Mike gives the ailing Lewis his pills. When Lewis points out that they're not living in DC because of Mike, Mike says that the mountain air is good for his father. Lewis doesn't believe it, and says that Mike is blaming him on everything. He asks if Mike has solved Sam's murder. Mike doesn't say anything, and Lewis tells his son that Sam chose the wrong town to die in. When the sheriff starts to snap at Lewis, he knocks over his water glass and Lewis asks what's wrong with him. Mike apologizes and asks Lewis to take his pills.

Harry arrives in Patience and pounds his feet on the window as he gets dressed. D'Arcy notices and comes over, and Harry tells her that he's putting on his pants. He insists that he's not living in his truck, and D'Arcy tells him that they had fun on their date and kissed, but she doesn't want to date him. Harry is more interested in her coffee, and D'Arcy tells Harry that he's not her type. She thinks it's his ego, but can't describe it. Harry figures that she's not very smart, and D'Arcy takes offense.

Harry figures that human men don't say mean things to women, and he has to apologize. He does so, awkwardly, and assures D'Arcy that she's smart... relative to their species. Harry walks off, unaware that D'Arcy is still angry.

At the cabin, Isabelle notices the lock on the basement door. Curious, she chisels it open and goes downstairs. She finds Sahar's wrap on the floor and smells perfume on it, and figures that Harry is cheating on her.

Abigail brings a box with Sam's medical files into the clinic. She's surprised to see Harry there, and he tells her that Ben hasn't found a replacement for Sam yet ""because he's bad at his job"". Abigail figures Harry wanted Sam's files, and asks if he's finished Sam's autopsy report. Harry tells her that he can't until he gets the toxicology report back from Denver, and says that his insurance claim is null and void if he committed suicide. Abigail suggests that Harry do ""the right thing"", and invites Harry to her salon to cut his hair.

Jay comes out and Harry tells her that Abigail is ""pro-murder"". He has Jay take the files to where the other files go. Asta is in the break room, and Jay brings the box in and says that she doesn't know where to put it. Jay passes on her mother's thanks for Asta helping Jay out the other night, and wants to make Asta dinner. Asta says that they'll talk about it, and takes the box to Harry.

Asta tells Harry that she shouldn't have brought Jay there, since she doesn't know the truth that Asta is her mother. Harry says that Asta should tell Jay that she's her mother, and Asta figures that she can't drag Jay into her life after giving her up. The alien is intrigued that Asta is willing to send Jay away because she loves her, not because she hated her. Harry immediately advises Asta to fire Jay, and offers to do it himself when Asta says that she can't.

Isabelle comes in and asks who the scarf belongs to. She wonders if it is Asta, and Asta takes offense. Isabelle says that she's Harry's wife, and Asta points out that Harry told her his wife is dead. His wife throws the scarf at Harry in disgust, then throws the files and box at him. Isabelle says that she's going back to NYC and leaves.

Isabelle goes to the 59 and orders a drink from D'Arcy. D'Arcy sympathizes when Isabelle says that she's going through a divorce, saying that that she hasn't been divorced and is still working on the pre-divorce. Isabelle wonders how people can change so much, saying her husband used to be alive and present, but is now so blunt. D'Arcy says that the man she's dating is also blunt, unaware that they're both talking about Harry.

Harry finds the Hawthornes waiting in his office. Kate has Max tell Harry that he stole his keys and duplicated them so he could sneak into Harry's cabin. Harry feigns surprise and says that he doesn't accept Max's apology. Kate points out that Max hasn't apologized yet, and Harry admits that he's getting ahead of himself. Max apologizes, and Harry refuses to accept it. Ben says that he has to accept it because of the rules, but Harry figures that Max isn't really sorry so he's not accepting Max's apology.

Kate agrees and tells her son to say it like he means it. Max yells that he doesn't mean it, and Harry says that he's snowflaking. He shows Max several photos, including one of the real Harry, and asks Max to point out which one is him. Max says that he can't tell because he only sees the alien Harry as an alien. Kate tells him to stop fooling around, and Max points at a photo at random.

Harry tells them that Max got it wrong, and Kate shows him the photo of the human Harry. Harry tells Max that he forgives him for breaking into his house because he's sick. Max accuses Harry of setting him up and storms out, and Ben goes after him. Harry tells Kate that it's worse than he thought, and Max sees monsters and scary things. He warns that Max might suffer from ""face blindness"" and anxiety, and shows Kate a special school on the web... in Georgia.

In his office, Mike looks at photos of Sam and tells Liv that he's gone over all the evidence but hasn't come up with anything. Liv is busy playing with a yo-yo, because it calms her. Mike takes it so he can calm himself, and points out that they have nothing on Sam's apparent murder. He breaks the yo-yo and blames Liv, and she says that Sam was probably murdered and the foot in the lake has something to do with it.

Mike says it felt good when he thought they had a serial killer, and is angry that other towns in Colorado have serial killers. Liv suggests that her aunt might punch someone at Bingo night to cheer Mike up.

D'Arcy and Isabelle drink and talk about how they're strong, independent women who don't need men. Isabelle tells D'Arcy that any real man would be in love with her, and real women don't run away. D'Arcy agrees, and Judy comes over and asks where Danny the jukebox repairman is. Judy and D'Arcy exchange insults, and D'Arcy offers a toast to Isabelle for ""women supporting women"".

At the clinic, Jay goes through Sam's files. Asta suggests that the clinic isn't very busy. Jay has found the file saying that Asta had a baby, and the baby was born on Jay's birthday. Asta says that it's complicated, and Jay tells her that Asta gave her away and then lied to her. She wonders if Jimmy is her father, and realizes that he is from Asta's silence. Jay storms out past Harry, who tells Asta that he was going to fire Jay and leaves.

Later, Harry finds Asta sitting on a street bench. He sits down with her and talks about Buddhist monks. Harry says that Asta just lied to Jay and pretended to be a friend, and Asta points out that he lied about his wife being dead. The alien says that humans lie because that's what they do, because they don't want people to know who they really are.

Jimmy comes up despite Asta saying that he'd meet her at the diner. When Jimmy recognizes Harry as the man who attacked him at Asta's cabin, he gets in Harry's face until Asta takes him to the diner. They sit down and Asta tells Jimmy that Jay finds out they're her parents. Jimmy didn't know Jay was their daughter, and says it's messed up.

Harry is at a nearby table, listening, and Jimmy sees him. Jimmy wonders why Harry is there, and Harry says that he's a ""ninja"". Asta tells them to ignore each other, and Jimmy angrily says that Asta also wasn't ready to be a parent. Dan comes out when Jimmy yells at Asta, and Asta tells Jimmy that if Jay comes to find her, he shouldn't ""flip out"" on her. Jimmy accuses Asta of getting involved with Jay if she wanted to protect their daughter, and leaves.

Once Jimmy leaves, Dan sits down with Asta and tells his daughter that it's better that Jay knows. Asta tells her father that it isn't his problem, and Dan says that night when he realized his wife wasn't coming back, he promised that he wouldn't leave Asta to face things alone. Dan promises that Jay has a family that loves her as if she was their own, and Asta takes her father's hand. Harry has moved behind them and clears his throat, pointing out that he's a ""ninja"".

That night, Harry drives back to his cabin and sees the lights on. Isabelle's car is parked outside, and Harry goes in and discovers that Isabelle has made dinner. Harry points out that she said she was going away forever, and Isabelle tells him that she didn't handle things well and wants to make things up to him. She's making steaks, and says that she got them from the freezer downstairs.

Harry says that it's impossible and discovers Isabelle chiseled the door open. Isabelle offers to get some peas from the freezer, and Harry says that he'll do it. He goes downstairs and discovers Isabelle broke into the freezer. The real Harry's body is still there, and Isabelle apparently didn't see it. Harry gets the peas and covers the corpse over, then goes back upstairs.

Isabelle and Harry have dinner, and Isabelle says that Harry hasn't been himself since she got there. Harry insists that he's always been a man, and Isabell figures that Harry is afraid. She says that she's afraid as well, and men showed up at the apartment and said they needed to talk to Harry. Isabelle says that she'll be there for Harry no matter what, and she hugs him while he eats his steak.

D'Arcy drives to Harry's cabin to make another attempt at a romantic relationship with him.

Isabelle tells Harry that they should have a dance, and Harry dances with her. Awkwardly. D'Arcy comes up to the cabin and sees the couple dancing, and drives away. Meanwhile, Isabelle asks Harry what's next. He says that he can only think of one thing, and tells Isabelle to scrub the pans before she leaves. As he walks away, Isabelle sings ""their song"", and Harry goes to her and they kiss.

At the Hawthorne house, Max overhears his parents talking about sending him to Georgia. Kate figures that Max will get worst if they don't do something about it, and points out that Max doesn't seem like a normal boy. Max goes to his room and calls Sahar on the radio, and says that his parents are sending him away. Sahar assures Max that she still believes him about Harry, and she has an idea to keep Max's parents from sending him away. As they talk, Sahar looks at the copy of 'Communion' that she's reading.

On the bed, Isabelle tells Harry that she'll take care of him. She rips off their clothing and kisses him, and Harry tries to remove her bra. Harry finally says that he doesn't know what they're doing, and Isabelle tells him that they're ""reconnecting"", as Harry gurgles.

The next morning, Isabelle lies next to Harry and sees her painting hanging on the bedroom wall. She figures that Harry still loves her, because he didn't have the heart to take the painting down. Isabelle tells Harry that they're going to be together forever and hugs him.

Later, Harry goes to the diner to have coffee. Max and Sahar sit down across from him, and Sahar says that touching the floating apple might have wiped her memory but it didn't kill her. She tells Harry that Max isn't going to Georgia, and she'll teach him how to hold his breath until he gets his way. Sahar says that she snuck Max's ashes into Harry's pocket so he can't spit on them when Max dies. Max says that they win again, and Harry spits on him.

Sahar tells Harry that she and Max are holding their breath until Harry promises to leave Max alone. If he doesn't and they pass out, then everyone will think Harry was responsible. The kids hold their breath, and Harry finally cracks. Max tells him that if Harry stops trying to have him sent away, he'll stop accusing Harry of being an alien. Harry also can't kill Max, and Max and Harry shake on their truce.

Max asks why he can see Harry's true form, and Harry explains. They exchange questions about each other's races.

Asta and Jay pass in the street, and Jay glares angrily at her birth mother.

D'Arcy goes to the 59 and sleeps on a bench rather than go home. She wakes up, and drinks a whiskey with an egg.

Jay goes to the diner, and Dan asks if she's hungry. She says that she's not, but when Dan tells her that family doesn't pay, Jay orders a big meal. Liv comes in and finds Mike with Lewis, and shows him Sam's toxicology report that came in. they show that Sam was poisoned, and Mike is thrilled that they have a murder.

Harry figures that he didn't hate Max, but how he made Harry feel inside: exposed and vulnerable. After talking to Max and Sahar, he felt his hatred for himself going away. He figures that there's something out there stronger than hate.

That night, Harry sleeps with Isabelle and discovers that she snores. He feels close to her, but sometimes wants to be far away. Harry confirms that Isabelle only snores when he doesn't hold her nose, and admits that he doesn't hate her but just needs sleep. He decides to let Isabelle live another day and goes to bed."

Later, Harry wakes up and hears a steak sizzling. He goes to investigate and finds an imaginary human Harry cooking. Undead-Harry says that he's cooking one of the steaks Harry packed him in, refuses to make him a steak, and says that Harry is a loser. Harry insists that he's a loser, but Undead-Harry points out that he's human, and the human race has destroyed Harry. Undead-Harry stabs at Harry's throat with a knife, and Harry wakes up and Undead-Harry comes at him with a knife and tells him that he's still dreaming. Harry finally wakes up.

At their house, Ben and Kate show Max a video of the Donnelly Institute they want to send him to. When the video is done, he wonders why they hate him. Max asks if Harry called them, and Kate says that Ethan is the new doctor and he approved the paperwork. Kate says that their decision is final, and Max storms out.

Harry goes to the diner and laments being a human while looking for jobs in the newspaper. Max joins him and reminds Harry that they had a truce. Harry admits that he's not good at truces, and has a lot to do to be human. Max tells him not to have alien stuff in the back of his truck and leaves.

At the 59, Asta and D'Arcy play pool and D'Arcy wonders why Asta didn't tell the police that Jimmy stole the pad. She points out that she didn't have any proof, and D'Arcy tells her that Asta should trust her instincts. Judy calls from the bowling alley where Harry is playing a machine and refuses to leave. Judy says that Harry applied for a job but was overqualified.

Asta and D'Arcy come over, and Harry tells them that Isabelle left him and he's lost his job. He says that he's tried booze and pills, and D'Arcy suggests pot. They sit on the bowling alley, smoke pot, and then eat. A lot. Harry is still depressed but says that he doesn't care. Harry sees the octopus in the tank and goes over. The octopus calls Harry ""cousin"" and telepathically says that it's been waiting for him

The octopus alien says that things are getting bad for them. Harry tells it that he's failed at his mission. Asta and D'Arcy see him and figure that he's just high. Asta wonders if Harry is a sociopath.

The alien tells Harry that he has to complete his mission and help them. It realizes that Harry is high, then apologizes for putting pressure on Harry. Harry figures that Max can help him, and tells the alien not to tell any of their people that he crashed.

As Harry leaves, Asta and D'Arcy go over and study another octopus.

Max is in bed when Harry breaks in, sits on Max's bed, and steals some chips to eat. The boy wakes up, and Harry asks Max how he knew about the alien stuff in his truck since there was a blanket covering it. Max says that there was a green glow, and Harry figures that it's part of the same genetic mutation that lets Max see Harry's real form. He wants Max to help him find his device, and Max says that he's not helping Harry unless Harry gets him out of going to Donnelly. Harry agrees and asks Max to have Kate get some popcorn.

The next day at the sheriff's station, Mike sits with Cletus and tells the dog that they'll put them on 'Deadline' for solving Sam's murder. Asta comes in and tells them that Jimmy stole the pad, and Mike is thrilled that they have a lead.

Harry goes to the clinic, meets with Ethan, calls in Ben and Kate, and says that he misdiagnosed Max and the boy just has an over-active imagination. Ben is thrilled, but Kate not so much and accuses Harry of driving a wedge between her and Ben. Ben is surprised to learn that, and Ethan says that sometimes doctors--but not him--sometimes make mistakes. The couple leave and Harry goes as well.

Two Weeks Ago: New Mexico

Eleanor, Lisa, and David consider how to open the spaceship. Eleanor agrees to give David more time, but tells him not to make her regret it.

Now

Max finds Harry in the library and tells the alien that his parents aren't sending him away. Harry shows him a photo of his spaceship, but Max can't see the green glow in the photo. However, Max can see the glow on an actual piece of the spaceship, and Harry says that he'll construct something to assist Max's eyeballs. Max asks what the device does, and Harry tells him that it will kill him before correcting himself and claiming that it's a radio.

At the station, Mike interrogates Jimmy and accuses him of poisoning Sam when Sam caught Jimmy stealing the pad. Jimmy denies it, and Liv and Jimmy discuss bosses that don't listen to them. Mike interrupts and asks what Liv wants to say to him, and she tells him that someone who plans a delayed murder isn't an idiot that steals pad. She suggests that the Pharmacist only wanted to sell drugs to kids.

Mike is offended that the Pharmacist sold drugs to kids and didn't know he was doing it.

Max lets Harry into the school, and Harry wears a mustache disguise. They go to the science lab to get a radioscope, and Harry steals it, a radio, and a telescope. They start to leave but duck out of sight when Mike and Liv pass looking for the Pharmacist, a janitor named Richard Ferguson.

When they find Ferguson and Mike announces that they know his secret identity, Ferguson runs. Mike chases after him, and Liv calmly gets in front of Ferguson and trips him with a broom. She tells Mike that she used to go to the school and knows all the shortcuts, and Mike reads Ferguson his rights as he leads him off.

At the hangar, David studies an ancient races' amulet and spots a glowing green object. He tells Eleanor and Lisa that the race claimed that they got their technology from an ancient race, and then their civilization disappeared. He figures the alien who owns the spaceship came there to kill everyone.

At home, Ben makes Kate some tea as a peace offering and asks if she's feeling any better. Kate says nothing, and Ben assures her that she's a great mother. His wife doesn't believe it, and Ben lights the candled that he made to calm her. Kate asks him to tell her that she's wrong, and she needs a partner that challenges him. Ben tells Kate that she was wrong about sending Max away, and Kate smiles and kisses him. Ben says that at times Kate can be a little controlling and he continues on until she gets upset with him and walks away.

Mike goes to the diner to eat, and Liv sits down with him and tells him the paperwork is done. She's thrilled that they worked together to capture Ferguson. Mike finally tells her that her behavior was a little disrespectful because the Miranda rights are her things and she tried to take it for herself. He also doesn't think Liv has been nice to Cletus. The waitress brings Mike's to-go order over, and Liv takes it, pounds it flat, and tells Mike that he has never been respectful to. She finally tells Mike that she quits, takes the to-go with her, yells at Mike to shut up, and storms out.

Harry and Max go to the clock tower, and Harry hooks up the equipment to the telescope and centers it on the mountain. Max sees the metal that Harry showed him earlier, then looks into the telescope and looks for the device. The boy spots a green glow and Harry tracks its location. It's on the glacier, and Harry tells him to get his bag.

As they walk down the street, Asta tells D'Arcy that it doesn't feel good that she told the police about Jimmy. D'Arcy says that they stopped a high school drug ring. Harry goes out to his truck, and Max tries to stop him, saying it's too dangerous. Asta and D'Arcy overhear Max as he yells after Harry to stop, but Harry keeps driving. The two women go over to Max and Asta asks him what he was doing with Harry. Max finally tells them that Harry is going to the glacier, and then runs off.

On the glacier, Harry searches for his device and figures that when he returns to his home planet, they'll erect statues to him. He remembers that his race doesn't know how to sculpt, and figures that a true hero doesn't need statues but maybe just a plaque... and finds the device.

Max goes home, sits on his bed, and looks at the metal piece he took from Harry's bag.

Asta and D'Arcy take snowmobiles up to the glacier and spot Harry.

Harry pulls the key piece out of the device.

The piece of debris sparks and Max drops it.

At the army hangar, the lights go out and the ship activates, waves of green energy going across it. David figures that something initiated it, tracked the signal and he exclaims that he knows where the alien is.

Asta and D'Arcy pull up near Harry and tell him not to move. He says that he was just shopping for snow and they can go, just as the ice beneath him breaks and they all fall into a crevasse."

No blackboard joke or couch gag.

Act One:

The episode begins as Homer hastily drives Marge and Maggie, in the family car, through snow covered streets. They are late for Bart and Lisa's Christmas pageant at the school. Once at the school, Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats; everyone looks on stage at the pageant that has already begun. Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduces the second grade The does a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world, and Lisa steals the show as Towanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas. Cut to Skinner introducing the fourth grade singing a medley of Christmas carols. As they all sing Jingle Bells, Bart can be heard singing rude, alternate lyrics to the song(Jingle Bells, Batman Smells) and Principal Skinner quickly yanks him from the performance with intent for a vicious reprimand. Homer is upset that Bart has once again misbehaved at the Christmas pageant by embarrassing his family, although Marge took no notice of it. The pageant continues on, as a bored Homer wonders aloud how long the pageant will last.

Afterwards, at the Simpson home, Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards, as Homer gets out Christmas decorations, and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists. In the letter Marge describes how everyone is doing and as she reads the letter in her head the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names. Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists. However, Marge is upset when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas and hoped that Bart's letter would make more sense. However, she's dismayed and insulted when he proves to be just as unreasonable as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo. Both Homer and arge refuses to allow him to get one until he's old enough and making his own money. Just then Marges sister Patty calls; a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans for getting together on Christmas Eve.

Cut to Homer, who is outside putting the finishing touches on the Christmas lights on the roof, as the kids watch from the sidewalk. After Homer falls from the roof, he calls out to Marge plug the lights in. Only a few of the lights actually light up, and Homer admires his handy work, while the kids are less than impressed. Ned Flanders is also outside, and ready to plug in his lights for the first time, he calls out to Homer and tells him to check it out. As he plugs the lights in his entire house lights up, including a talking Santa Claus on the roof. The lights illuminate everyones face and much to Homers dismay; his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights.

At breakfast the next morning, Marge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the mall. As the excited kids run off to get their money, Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings. She makes him turn around and she pulls a big jar of money out of her hair. Homer is impressed at the amount of money they have for Christmas this year. Later at the mall, as Marge, Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together; Bart is off by himself, and comes across a tattoo parlor. In the window, he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word mother written across it. He daydreams that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo, so he runs inside the parlor, lies to the tattoo artist about his age, and hops into the chair.

Meanwhile, at the nuclear power plant, Mr. Burns announces over the loud speaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers; this includes Homer. Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents.

Back at the mall, Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo halfway finished on his arm. She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to a tattoo removal clinic. The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front. Marge has to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal, but she sighs when she remembers they still can use Homers Christmas bonus. Back at home, Marge tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out. She tells him to calm down, and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus a little further this year. Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus, he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk. Once outside he looks up at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece. A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair.

Act Two:

That night in bed, Marge senses something is amiss with Homer and she asks what is wrong. Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus, but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping, so she doesnt have to. Marge agrees and seems satisfied that there is nothing wrong and they both go to bed. The next day Homer does some Christmas shopping alone at a cheap thrift store. He purchases pantyhose for Marge, pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie. On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned who has an armful of fancily wrapped packages. All the presents are spilled onto the ground, and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought, he becomes sad and depressed and heads over to Moes. At Moes, Homer drinks a beer alone, when a cheerful Barney walks in wearing a Santa Claus suit. Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a part time job acting as Santa Claus at the mall. Homer suddenly has an idea. Cut to the personnel office in the mall, as Homer fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa. After reviewing Homers application, and interviewing him, the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training s. A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues.

Homer finally makes it home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been. Homer ignores her and heads upstairs, but Marge tells him that her sisters are here and that he needs to visit with them. As Homer talks with Patty and Selma, they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet. Homer tells them he was just on his way out to get one, and he angrily hurries out the door. In the car, Homer drives past several expensive Christmas tree lots and finally stops at a private tree farm and uses a chain saw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family. Back at home, Homer stands up the tree, and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma. On Christmas Eve at the mall, Homer works as Santa Claus, while children wait in line to sit on his lap. From a distance, Bart and Milhouse watch the kids line up to sit on Santas lap, they comment on how they cant believe that these kids are falling for the fake Santa bit. Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees. Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap. Not knowing that Santa is really Homer, Bart yanks off his beard. Bart is shocked at what he has uncovered, and an angry Homer escorts Bart inside Santas workshop to speak with him in private. Homer explains the situation to Bart, who understands and feels bad for yanking off Homers beard. At the end of the Homers shift, Bart goes with Homer as he picks up his check. Homer is surprised to learn that he has only made 13 dollars. When he questions the cashier, she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit, social security, and etc. While a depressed Homer sits down to figure out what to do with the 13 dollars, an excited Barney tells Homer that he is going to the dog track to place a bet with his 13 dollars. He invites Homer to come along with him, Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go, citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family Christmas.

Act Three:

Back at the Simpson home everyone including Patty, Selma and Grandpa Simpson, wait for Homer and Bart to come home. Cut to the dog track, where Barney gives Homer a tip on a dog named Whirlwind. After seeing what Whirlwind looks like, Homer is reluctant to bet on him. Just then an announcement plays over the P.A. system, announcing that a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing another dog in the fourth race. Homer senses that the announcement is an omen, and decides to bet on him even though Bart recommends not to, and despite the fact that the odds are 99 to 1. Homer puts down all 13 dollars on Santas Little Helper. Meanwhile at home, Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer, while everyone still waits for him and Bart. Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race. As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper, but Whirlwind, Barneys pick, is out to an early lead with Santas Little Helper bringing up the rear. Homer and Bart quickly realize their chances at winning any money are dashed, as Santas Little Helper doesnt even finish the race. Cut to Homer and Bart, out in the parking lot of the dog track, looking for discarded betting slips hoping to find that someone has thrown away a winner. Barney drives by in a convertible with a woman in the passenger seat, and gloats to Bart and Homer about his pick for the race: Whirlwind.

A dejected Bart and Homer head back to their car, when off in the distance they see a racing dog owner yelling and chasing off Santas Little Helper for losing once again. Santas Little Helper jumps up into Homers arms. Bart asks to keep Homer if they can keep the dog. Homer, reluctant at first, quickly warms up to the dog and decides to take him home. Cut back to the Simpson home, where everyone still awaits Bart and Homers return. Suddenly, a sad looking Homer enters in and starts to confess to everyone about the fact that he didn't receive his Christmas bonus, and apologizes for the lack of presents; when Bart bursts in, along with a barking Santas Little Helper. Everyone falls in love with the dog, and Homer realizes that in the end he has done a good job providing gifts at Christmas.

End Credits: The credits roll as the entire Simpson family including Patty, Selma, and Grandpa Simpson, sing Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Near the end of the song, Homer ends up strangling Bart for adding unofficial, rude alternate lyrics to Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer."

Act One:

The episode begins as the Simpson family plays Scrabble, in the living room, in an effort to build Bart's vocabulary for his aptitude test tomorrow at school. The game ends when Bart cheats and makes up an imaginary word, Kwyjibo, and defines it as, A big, dumb, balding, North American ape with no chin. Homer is instantly angered and chases Bart out of the room.

The next day before class, in the schoolyard, Martin Prince, the school genius aside from Lisa, tattles on Bart, for spray painting graffiti that defames Principal Skinner on the school building(Principal Skinner, ""I Am A Weiner"" even though he misspelled weiner with wiener). Skinner orders Bart to see him after school. As the children file into class, Mrs. Krabappel hands out aptitude tests to everyone. When she instructs the class on taking the timed intelligence test, Martin raises his hand, and reminds her that Bart is supposed to face the window during any test so he cant cheat. A grumbling, Bart turns his desk to face the window and the test begins. In an attempt to figure out a lengthy math word problem, Bart tries to visualize the problem so he can solve it. The visualization turns into a daydream and when Bart finally comes back to reality, Martin announces that he has finished his test already. Mrs. Krabappel sends Martin outside to read a book, during the remainder of the testing period. While Bart is still taking his test, he looks out the window to see a smug Martin sticking his tongue out at him. In retaliation, Bart makes faces back at Martin; Mrs. Krabappel spots Bart making faces and looks out the window to see what Bart is looking at. While her back is turned, Bart, who is seated at the front of the class, reaches over to Mrs. Krabappels desk and steals Martin's test, replaces his name with Bart's own own and then puts the test back on her desk. Bart then quickly fills out random answers on his own test and then writes Martin's name at the top and turns it in.

Later, after school, Marge and Homer are called to Principal Skinners office for a meeting about Barts behavior at school. Skinner informs Marge and Homer about Barts graffiti from earlier that morning. As he reaches for Barts rather extensive permanent record, and is about to suggest something along the lines of expulsion for Bart, his secretary buzzes in and says that Dr. J. Loren Pryor, the school psychiatrist is waiting to see him. Dr. Pryor walks in on the meeting, and surprises everyone when he tells them that Bart is a gifted child, and according to the aptitude test from earlier, Bart has an I.Q. of 216. Dr. Pryor suggests that Barts history of bad behavior stems from a lack of interest in his school work, due to the fact that it is too easy for him. Skinner wants Bart retested, but when Dr. Pryor suggests moving Bart to a school for gifted children Skinner jumps on board with the idea, and Bart quickly agrees when he hears that the school doesnt have much structure and that you get to make your own rules. Dr. Pryor hands Bart some paperwork for the gifted children school, and he, Homer and Marge leave the meeting stunned.

Act Two:

The next morning at the breakfast table, Marge and Homer hover around their new genius child and Homer tells Lisa to start eating what Bart eats for breakfast, so she can become a genius too. Unfortunately for him, she isn't fooled by Bart and knows that he is still just a dimwit. She mentions that no aptitude test can change the awful truth that he cheated by copying off of Martin Prince.

After breakfast, Homer takes Bart to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children. Once inside the school they find Barts class, and after peeking in, they see that all the boys are wearing ties. So Homer gives Bart the tie he is wearing, and he gives Bart a little pep talk about his first day at the new school and shoves him in the classroom door. Once inside the class, Ms.Melon, the teacher introduces herself and the new classmates to Bart and shows him around the classroom. She tells Bart about the independent learning and that the only rule is for him to make his own rules. Class begins with a debate on the topic of free will and the paradoxes that it creates; Bart struggles to understand the discussion. Later at lunch, his classmates realize that Bart isnt really that smart when he accepts their ridiculously uneven trade offers. (Ex: 1000 Pico liters of milk for 4 gills worth. A gill is much, much larger than a Pico liter.) He dejectedly walks away from the lunch table as the other kids laugh at him since he's the laughing stok of the school. Bart soon comes to regret cheating off of Martin during the aptitude test.

Act Three:

After school, Bart relaxes in his room, when Homer walks in to see about his first day at the new school. Homer suggests they all go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes and Bart agrees. Just then Marge walks by, and tells Homer and Bart that she bought tickets to the opera in an effort to try to help nurture his brain, even though Lisa has previously warned her not to because she still suspects Bart cheating off of Martin. Despite that, she went through with her mother's plan to see if he would crack under pressure and confess to the family. Later during the opera, a bored and impatient Homer and Bart goof off and cut each other up, even though they are continually shushed by an upset Marge.

Cut to the next day at school where Bart feels even more stupid and left out when he cant understand a calculus problem on the chalkboard. Later, as he sadly walks home from school, he passes by the playground of his old school, where Richard, Lewis, and Milhouse are shooting marbles. When Bart greets them and tries to talk to them, they treat him like a nerd, call him names and tell him to get lost. Cut to later at dinner, as a depressed Bart eats, Marge reminds everyone that they cant be late for the film festival that she bought tickets for, as another way to nurture Bart's brain. He is reluctant to go to the festival and Homer tells him they dont have to. Just as Bart is about to tell Homer what is on his mind and confess about the false I.Q. test, Homer insists on going outside to play catch. After playing catch, Bart sees how much being a genius means to Homer and decides not to confess about what he has done, out of fear of disappointing him.

The Final Act:

The next day at the gifted children school, while performing a chemistry experiment, Bart accidentally causes an explosion, which results in green goo everywhere. Cut to Dr. Pryors office, where a green stained Bart meets, with Dr. Pryor. They discuss the reasoning behind his recent failings at the new school, and Dr. Pryor thinks that once again Bart isnt being challenged enough, while Bart suggests that he just go back to Springfield Elementary again. When Dr. Pryor wants to know why, Bart makes up an excuse and tells him that he would like to go undercover and study regular kids and their school environment, to see what makes em tick. Dr. Pryor agrees and tells Bart to write up a proposal to present to Principal Skinner while he goes to talk to him. Bart struggles to write a proposal and instead changes his mind and writes his confession. When Dr. Pryor comes back in the office and reads Barts confession he suddenly realizes that he was never a genius to begin with and Martin was the genius all along.

Later at home, a still green stained Bart greets his parents and Homer offers to give him a turpentine bath to wash off the green. Out in the backyard, as his father gives him a bath, Bart confesses about cheating on the aptitude test and tells Homer that he loves him and that he has enjoyed the extra attention from being a genius. He tells Homer that he doesnt think something that has brought them closer than they ever were before could be bad. But, Homer doesnt see it his way, and he chases Bart out of the tub, trying to choke him. Bart is too quick for Homer and runs into his bedroom and locks the door. An angry Homer pounds on Barts door, and tries to coax him to come out, while Bart taunts him from inside his room. Everything is back to normal in the Simpson home."

During the trip, Bart sees Homer, and gets his attention. However, this causes Homer to crash the cart he's driving, causing a major mishap at the plant. Homer's Supervisor then has Homer fired for his negligence.

Homer attempts to find another job in the wake of his firing, but all his attempts lead to nothing. Feeling he's a failure, Homer attempts to throw himself off the Springfield bridge. However, his family finds out about his attempt, and rush to his aid...almost getting hit by a car! In the aftermath, Homer then declares that the intersection they were at is dangerous, and needs a stop sign.

Homer next appears before the city council, and gets his stop sign proposal passed. This then leads to Homer becoming safety-conscious, and eventually, leading a group to protest better safety conditions at the Nuclear Plant.

This catches the attention of the plant's owner, C Montgomery Burns, who requests an audience with Homer. Burns is willing to make Homer in charge of safety at the plant, if he will tell the crowd that the plant is actually safe. Homer considers this, but claims that to say that would violate his moral principles. This impresses Burns enough that he is willing to give Homer the position, and Homer tells his followers outside about his good fortune, as they cheer him on."

He tells them to get the bad behavior out of their system, because they are going to Mr. Burns' company picnic, and he doesn't want his family to embarrass him in front of Mr. Burns.

When the family arrives at Mr. Burns' mansion for the picnic, Homer once again reminds his family that they have to behave in a normal manner. Bart and Lisa quickly run off to play in the water fountain and Homer chases after them leaving Marge and Maggie behind. Another woman carrying a baby approaches Marge and suggests to place the babies in the nursery and grab a drink together. Marge is reluctant of drinking, but then after seeing Homer chase Bart and Lisa around the backyard, she chooses to have a glass of punch.

It's soon time for the father-son sack race, and Homer pressures Bart to not have them beating Mr. Burns. Meanwhile, Marge is conversing with all the wives of the workers; she becomes tipsy from the amount of punch she drank. Back to the sack race, where Smithers gives Mr. Burns a head start and then fires the starting gun. Mr. Burns is out in front of everyone, when suddenly Bart plans to make a break for the finish line. Homer quickly hops up ahead and tackles Bart just short of the finish line, allowing Mr. Burns to finish first. Meanwhile, Marge, intoxicated, leads all the women in a song and dance number, when Homer, runs by and is shocked at Marge's behavior. He quickly whisks her away from the punch and tells her to keep it together because Mr. Burns is about to give a toast.

Everyone at the picnic gathers as Mr. Burns gives a toast, he thanks everyone for coming, but tells them all to leave immediately as he threatens to release the hounds in ten minutes. Everyone heads out, and Homer notices the family ahead of them; the son gives the father a kiss and tells him he had a great time. Mr. Burns is impressed by this family, but is insulted by Homer's pathetic attempt to gain his favor. Later on, Homer confronts the man from the ""perfect"" family ahead of him and tells him he can stop the fake cornball routine. However, the man reveals his family are actually nice normal people in real life and don't act like this only at gatherings. When the man admits pitying him, Homer finally realizes the truth--that his own family has a problem (evident when Marge, Bart and Lisa misbehave and is embarrassed by it).

The next day, Marge and the kids eat TV dinners in the living room and watch TV together when Homer walks in and plans that tonight they are all going to eat at the dinner table like a normal family. At the dinner table, the rest of the Simpsons are not taking Homer's attempt to get them to eat like a normal family seriously and continue eating like cavemen. During his prayer, Homer expresses his dissatisfaction with his troubled family's behavior and ponders why he was cursed with those who disrespect him. When Marge and the kids claim there is nothing is wrong with the family, Homer chooses to prove that there is something wrong with them. He leads the family in a tour around the neighborhood, peeking into random houses to observe their neighbors' normal family life. However, the rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior in the tour. Marge tells him that she thinks the trip is unnecessary because she and the kids feel like stalkers in invading their entire neighborhood's privacies with their families. They quickly retreat to the safety of their own home to continue watching TV.

Depressed by this matter, Homer visits Moe's Tavern for a drink and to get away from his problems. Two patrolmen enter the bar, claiming they received reports of a neighborhood stalker. The dog suspects Homer and growls at them to pay attention. Luckily for him, the two cops are too dumb to notice anything and drag the dog away. After getting into a brief fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees ""family bliss or double your money back"". and he gets an idea to make his family normal.

Marge and the kids watch an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon when Homer walks in the living room and announces he has made an appointment at Dr. Monroe's Family Therapy Center. The family is reluctant to the idea, but Homer is on a mission to make his family better. Marge tries to claim that there's still nothing wrong with their family, but Homer doesn't listen.

The therapy treatment begins as Dr. Monroe brings them into another room and sits them down. He encourages them each to draw a picture that represents the source of their unhappiness. Most of the Simpsons vent their anger out by drawing Homer as they see him, while Homer gets lost in the exercise by drawing airplanes dropping bombs on his family. When Dr. Monroe sees this, he points out to Homer that had he been paying attention, he would've known his family sees him as an abusive and stern disciplinarian. Monroe also calls him an ogre, a word that Marge and Lisa disagree with, claiming ogre is too much. Bart agrees with Monroe, making Homer furious enough to attack him. Dr. Monroe calms Homer down and asks the family to try different exercises, ex. the foam padded aversion mallets that Bart turns into a hard weapon by removing the foam padding from his mallet and striking Dr. Monroe with it. Soon, Dr. Monroe sees that the Simpson family is not responding to conventional treatment, so his next exercise becomes different. He places each of the Simpsons in their own chair, hooked up to deliver an electric shock. Each chair has buttons that when pressed will deliver an electric shock to another corresponding chair. With all of the Simpsons strapped in, Dr. Monroe instructs them only to shock someone else if that person hurts them emotionally. However, the family members quickly start shocking each other over minor slights, and then things go totally off the rails when Maggie starts hitting all the buttons at random, leading to a power brownout across the entire city, much to Mr. Burns' joy as this increased use of electricity means more money for his company.

Dr. Monroe soon tires of the Simpsons and tries to remove them from his office, but Homer refuses to leave until he gets double his money back (it was $250 to attend a session, so it would be $500 that Homer is asking for). Dr. Monroe, at first refuses, but then, seeing as how the family acted as one, he gives Homer the money and tells them to leave and never tell anyone they were ever there. The family leaves, then uses the money to buy a new TV (the old one was cashed in to help pay for the session), seeing as how they reconnected with each other."

Opening Credits: No blackboard joke or couch gag.

Act One:

The episode begins with Bart and Lisa in the kitchen making Marge breakfast for her birthday. The kids bring it upstairs and surprise Marge with breakfast in bed. During the surprise, Homer thinks it is his birthday and then quickly realizes he has forgotten Marge's birthday. He quickly hurries downstairs and takes off in the car with tires squealing. Cut to Homer shopping at the mall for a present.

Back at the house Marge is on the phone with her sisters Patty and Selma talking about Homer's lousy gift giving history and deciding on where to go for her birthday dinner. At the mall, Homer eyes up a bowling ball and has an idea. Cut back to the house where Homer hides Marge's present and she informs Homer about dinner at The Singing Sirloin with the kids and her sisters which makes him shiver in disgust. Later at the restaurant, she receives a bottle of French perfume from Bart and a dried macaroni art piece from Lisa. She loves both and thanks her children for her gifts, Bart for buying her an expensive perfume that she wanted and Lisa for her home made art. When it comes time for Homer to give Marge, his present. His present is a thoughtless gift, a bowling ball complete with drilled holes and his name engraved on it drops onto her cake. Everyone in the restaurant are shocked with Homer's present, including Marge who is visibly upset and reminds him that she had never bowled in a day of her life. However, Patty and Selma aren't surprised by it and knew that he had been thoughtless again.

Act Two:

Back at the house, before going to bed, Homer tries to defend his reasoning for getting Marge the bowling ball. She doesn't buy it and decides to go ahead and use the bowling ball just to spite him for his insensitive gift. Homer is upset because his plan for a new bowling ball has now backfired. The next day at Barney's Bowlarama, Marge goes bowling by herself and clearly does not know what she is doing. A French accented man named Jacques, bowling in the lane next to her, comes over and offers bowling lessons to her and she accepts. It is clear that Jacques is to trying to seduce Marge and she is very flattered.

Back at the house Homer does his fatherly duties and provides pizza for dinner and puts the kids to bed. Later on with everyone asleep, Marge finally comes home. When she tells Homer she will be going bowling again the next night he becomes suspicious but doesn't say anything to her about it. The next night at the bowling alley Jacques gives Marge a wrist guard for bowling, with her name embroidered on it. The seduction continues and shee is clearly enjoying herself. Later on Jacques drops off Marge at home and invites Marge to brunch the next day, she reluctantly agrees. When she comes to bed late, once again Homer is suspicious but doesn't say anything.

Act Three:

The next morning, before school, Marge gives Bart and Lisa large sack lunches with extra goodies inside, and showers them with lots of love. Lisa asks her if she is going bowling later and Marge says yes. Later on the bus, while Bart comments on the cool lunches, Lisa explains to him that Marge is feeling guilty because her marriage with Homer is starting to crumble. Bart doesn't understand and denies the situation even exists.

At brunch with Jacques, Marge is visibly nervous about being seen with another man, and Helen Lovejoy, the Reverend's wife, and local gossip, stops by to chat. She starts feeling even more uncomfortable, and when Jacques asks her to meet with him at his apartment she faints. During her fainting spell, she dreams about the encounter with Jacques at his apartment. In the dream, Marge in a gown and Jacques in a tux dance together and just as Jacques leans in for a kiss, she wakes up from her dream. Marge sees Jacques staring her in the eyes and she agrees to meet him again, this time at his apartment.

Back at home in the bedroom Homer discovers Marge's wrist guard and fears the worst. Bart comes in asks him to play catch. When playing catch in the backyard Homer is too depressed and lost in thought to pay attention. Bart panics and realizes that Lisa is right about their parents' marriage and that Marge has been seeing someone else. When he admited to her she was right, Lisa does rub it in his face before advising Bart to talk to their father about his problems. He offers Homer some advice and tells him to keep his mouth shut to Marge about the situation and maybe it won't get any worse. The next morning while she is making the kids lunches for school, Homer tells her how much he likes her sandwiches and mentions he doesn't believe in keeping feelings bottled up inside. Marge is touched by his words as he heads out to go to work. Cut to Jacques at his apartment getting ready for his meeting with her, it is apparent that he plans on really putting the moves on her this time.

Back to Homer at work, who is to preoccupied to eat his lunch. Meanwhile, Marge is in the car headed for Jacques' apartment, on the way there she sees various couples together clearly in love. When she comes to a fork in the road with one way leading to his apartment and the other leading to Homer at the power plant she can't decide which way to go. Eventually, she decides to go to the Power Plant to see Homer instead of Jacques.

Cut back to Homer who is looking sad and depressed at work when Marge walks in and taps him on the shoulder surprising him and making him forget all his worries. She reaffirms her love for him and he's very happy. As Homer carries Marge in his arms off to the backseat of their car, he announces that, ""I won't be back for ten minutes!""

While doing so, he finds he has one cherry bomb left.

Taking it to school, he flushes it down a toilet in the boy's room. The explosion causes the toilet's to backflow in both the boy's and girl's rooms. It just so happens that Principal Skinner's mother (who is visiting her son) was in the girl's room at the time and is injured when a geyser of water launches her off the commode.

Principal Skinner takes Bart home where he has a talk with Homer and Marge. Feeling any normal form of punishment will not do, he suggests deportation, or to put it in other terms, making Bart part of a student exchange program for several months in France. Bart eagerly agrees to go, and is soon jetted off to France.

However, the family that is taking Bart in are actually a pair of French crooks. Bart is soon subjected to backbreaking and tedious work on their winery, as they starve him, make him sleep on the floor and sell off almost all of his things.

Meanwhile, the Simpsons have accepted an Albanian exchange student into their household, named Adil Hoxha. Adil proves to be a considerate boy, but secretly is an Albanian spy, who begins sending coded messages to his country regarding Springfield's Nuclear Plant, tricking Homer into taking him to the plant. Sensing that unlike Bart, Adil is interested in his work, Homer happily shows the boy restricted equipment and areas, which Adil photographs.

Back in France, Bart notices his exchange family adding anti-freeze in their wine to age it more rapidly. They force Bart to drink a small amount to prove that it won't hurt him before sending him out to buy more anti-freeze. Bart attempts to ask an officer for help, but gets nowhere when the Gendarme doesn't understand his English. As Bart wanders away, he suddenly begins to speak French, after having been immersed in the culture. Bart talks again to the Gendarme and explains about what the men have been doing. They are arrested, and Bart is considered a hero for his efforts.

In Springfield, Adil is soon caught by the authorities, and sent back to Albania...exchanged for a young American spy who was doing the same over there.

As Adil leaves, Bart returns, bearing gifts for his family. They all agree it's great to see Bart back, as Homer struggles with a bottle of French champagne, complaining ""that some wise guy stuck a cork in the thing.""

Bart then (in French) claims that his father is ""a buffoon,"" leading Homer to happily proclaim that Bart now speaks French (unaware of the insult that was just laid on him)."

Blackboard joke: They are laughing at me, not with me.

Couch gag: The family runs in and sits down on the couch, Maggie is squeezed in between Lisa and Bart and pops up into the air where Marge catches her.

Act One:

The episode begins with Bart, Lisa and Maggie watching Krusty the Clown on TV. During the show a reluctant and unhappy Sideshow Bob is launched from a cannon as requested by the birthday girl, also an episode of Itchy and Scratchy is aired (titled: Burning Love).

Marge calls Homer at work and asks him to stop on his way home to pick up some ice cream. When he asks what the occasion is, he instantly shudders when he learns that Patty and Selma are coming over later to show slides of their vacation in Mexico. Homer stops at the Kwik-E-Mart for ice cream on the way home, and talks to Apu while he's there. Homer relays why he's unhappy to buy ice cream is because he and his family has to watch a slide show starring none other than his sisters-in-law, whom he unlovingly dubs them the ""Gruesome Twosome"". He and Apu laugh for a bit unaware that Krusty is standing behind him with a mask covering his eyes. When he's about to leave, Homer accidentally steps on his clown shoes. This causes Krusty to curse at Homer for not watching where he was going in stepping on his foot. Just before he had a chance to apologize, he sees that Krusty is armed with a gun and quickly jumps in the pile of potato chips in terror as he witness the clown rob Apu at gunpoint.

Cut quickly to the Simpson house, as the rest of the family watches Patty and Selma's slides. Cut back to Homer, who gives a description of Krusty to the police. Meanwhile at Krusty's apartment, he's relaxing with a drink when a SWAT team busts down his door and take him into custody. At the police station, Homer identifies Krusty as the armed robber. He finally makes it home just as the news report about Krusty's arrest comes on the air. While watching the news, Marge is embarrased that he called her sisters that on National TV. However, it was Patty and Selma that were infuriated him for calling them that on the security cam of the Kwik-E-Mart. Bart is devastated that his idol Krusty could have done such a thing. Marge tries to tell him that it was a misunderstanding, but Homer is convinced that he guilty and wants his son to see it the same way. However, a devistated Bart refuses to believe that Krusty's guilty without proof.

Act Two:

On the news, Kent Brockman reports on the upcoming trial and history of Krusty the Clown including the fact that Krusty has a pacemaker. Reverend Lovejoy calls for a public burning of all Krusty merchandise. The next day, as Krusty walks up the steps to the courthouse Bart and Lisa watch in disbelief and they noticed that Krusty has small feet. Inside the courtroom during the trial, even after he begs his father not to, Homer points him out to the jury as the armed robber.

Later back at the house, Homer and a reluctant, Marge gather up all the Krusty merchandise in the house and head to the public burning. An irate and hurt, Bart watches as the pile of merchandise goes up in flames. Marge tries to sympathize with him, but Homer will have none of it and convinces him to join the winning team. Bart angrilly refuses his father's demand and tells him off he will prove Krusty's innocence even if it means going against his wishes. The next day at the trial, it is revealed after being asked to identify some evidence that Krusty is illiterate. Later, the jury reaches a guilty verdict.

At the Simpson house, Lisa and Maggie watch Sideshow Bob who has now taken over for Krusty on TV with a more scholastic affair. When Bart walks in and sees this, he is upset. Lisa tells him that he should be thankful that Sideshow Bob is keeping the Itchy and Scratchy show. Bart quickly snaps and tells her off that he knows that Krusty is innocent for a crime he didn't commit. He convinces Lisa to help him prove his innocence by going to the Kwik-E-Mart, which was the scene of the armed robbery the night Homer had to get some ice cream for Patty and Selma's slide show of their vacation, because she's smart and he needs her.

Bart and Lisa go to the Kwik-E-Mart to examine the crime scene after they convinced a reluctant Apu, they just need to look around. They immediately noticed that the microwave at the check-out counter that has a sign warning that people with pacemakers and clown shoes should keep away. Lisa recalls that in the security camera footage Krusty was reading a magazine, but that couldn't be true since he is illiterate, even remembering a ""Get Well Soon"" card she and Bart given him. She also recalls that while she watching the footage, she noticed that when Homer had previously stepped on the robber's clown shoes, he adamantly yelped in pain and he cursed at their father for his clumsiness in not watching where he was going. That was an indication that the robber had big feet, not small ones like Krusty has. Lisa finally realises Bart was right all along about Krusty the Clown in being framed for a crime he didn't commit and was innocent the whole time.

Cut to Sideshow Bob who after just finishing taping of his show enters his changing room and emits an evil diabolical laugh, knowing that Krusty is now in jail for the armed robbery he did.

Act Three:

At the television studio Bart, Lisa, and Maggie pay a visit to Sideshow Bob, he dismisses them because his show is about to start, but he offers them free tickets. While in Bob's room, they noticed his enormous feet. In the audience, a visibly saddened Bart watches the show. When Sideshow Bob notices his sadness he invites him on stage for a new psychological segment called Choices. While on stage, Bart reveals he is sad because he thinks that Krusty was framed and wrongfully jailed. However, Sideshow Bob tries to convince him otherwise and as he continues talking to Bart and the audience, he confesses that he has ""big shoes to fill."" as he replaced the Krusty the Clown Show.

The phrase ""Big shoes,"" echos through Bart's mind as he remembers that Homer stepped on the thief's foot and he yelped in pain, yet Krusty has small feet. On the other hand, Sideshow Bob has large feet and he realises the truth. His sidekick on the now cancelled ""Krusty The Clown Show"" show was truly responsible for the armed robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart that night.

Bart's emotions immediately changes from sadness into anger, embarrassment and irriation as he rightfully levels his accusation towards Sideshow Bob. Then, he jumps to his feet, snatches the microphone from Bob and faces the kids in the audince. Bart makes a truthful and heartfelt announcement to the audience that Krusty didn't rob the Kwik-E-Mart that night, his sidekick, Sideshow Bob, framed him and has evidence to show it. He proves it well by whomping Bob's feet with a comedy mallet causing him to fall down to the floor and grabbing his feet in pain. The kids are disgusted and horrified by the truth as Sideshow Bob angrilly continued cursing at him on the air, as indication to the words utter on the security cam footage. Bart honestly continued relaying that even though Krusty had worn clown shoes on his show all the time, he always has little feet like all good hearted people. He also mentions that Bob had the most to gain in framing him for the armed robbery by filling his hero's clown shoes with ""his big feet"". To prove his point, Bart removes Sideshow Bob's clown shoes to reveal his big, ugly feet on the air, angering him further.

At the Springfield Police Station, Chief Wiggim and the police officers are seen eating donuts and are watching the show. While they were watching Bart's announcement on Sideshow Bob's new show, they realized that he was right because they missed one key piece of evidence that could've kept Krusty out of jail. After watching the show to hear his heartfelt, truthful accusation and his proof of evidence, Chief Wiggim orders the officers to go down to the studio and arrest Sideshow Bob for the Kwik-E-Mart Armed Robbery.

The final act:

At the studio parking lot, Sideshow Bob is humilated and moritified beyond belief as he's arrested and handcuffed by the police. He immediately, although iratedly, confesses to his crime in committing the armed robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart on the night Homer witnessed it. He dramatically reveals that he framed Krusty for the armed robbery, because he couldn't stand being the constant victim to the clown's antics: including all of his pranks on the show, just to garner more ratings. Sideshow Bob felt his intelligence was being wasted away and wanted ""The Krusty The Clown Show"" gone because he wanted to make a more scholastic show where his intelligence can be appreciated, rather than laughed at and considered a joke. While he was being taken away to jail, Sideshow Bob swears a personal vendetta against Bart and warn those to treat children like equals because they're people who were smart to catch him and they'll be smart to catch them too.

Later at the Springfield Prison, Krusty's released from prison and he's in full clown make up as everyone cheered for him. Immediately, Homer and all the other residents of Springfield gave him a heartfelt apology for their poor judgment against him. He eventually forgives them for their misjudgment. However, Krusty thanks Bart for his help, since he was the only one who beleived in his innocence. He knew that his faith for him never waivered and kept supporting him thoughout the tough times he was in jail.

The handshake is captured in a photo, which Bart proudly tacks on his wall of his bedroom. The picture is inscribed in shaky handwriting, ``To my best pal Bart, Krusty''. That night, Bart goes to bed much happier in his newly refurnished bedroom, with all the Krusty the Clown merchandise(that his hero gave out for free)."

Couch Gag: The family runs in and sits on the couch, nothing happens.

Act One:

The episode begins with the family eating breakfast in the morning. Just as the school bus pulls up, Bart and Lisa run off to get on the bus. Marge asks them not to forget about the special lunches she made for them. Lisa tells her it's ok as she and Bart took money from their father's wallet for their lunch. Homer looks down at his watch and realizes he is late for work. When Marge leans in for a kiss, Homer is oblivious to her, and instead drinks the last of his coffee. He quickly hurries away, leaving her feeling depressed and with a mess in the kitchen. As she sits in the kitchen she hears an ad on the radio for a call-in therapy talk show hosted by Dr. Marvin Monroe. Marge decides to call, and she explains to him that she feels Homer doesn't appreciate her anymore and that he isnt romantic like he used to be. Dr. Monroe tells Marge to give him an ultimatum when he comes home from work: either he starts loving you or you leave him. Meanwhile, at the power plant, everyone laughs at Homer as they are all listening to the call on the radio.

After school, Bart plays a prank call on Moe's Tavern and asks him for Al Coholic. Once Moe calls for Al Coholic, the bar denizens quickly laugh at him and he threatens mayhem to whoever prank called him. Bart and Lisa both laugh as he hangs up the phone. Homer just happens to be there, because he is too afraid to come home to an angry Marge and eats a pickled egg. He asks Barney and Moe for their opinion, if he's a loveless dirtbag who likes taking his wife for granted and mistreats her. They both agree he is, since they heard Marge's call in radio to Dr.Monroe about her complaints towards him in not loving her. Homer asks Moe for advice on how to be more romantic towards her. Moe tells him to buy her some flowers, take her out to dinner and spend the evening at a motel with her. Homer takes his advice and heads to the flower shop. He purchases a rose and chcolates for her. Back at the house Marge gets madder by the minute waiting for Homer to come home. Bart, Lisa and Maggie wisely stays away from their irate mother as she waits for their father to come home

Act Two:

While an enraged Marge waits at the front door for Homer, he stands in the driveway, figuring out exactly what to say to her. Marge hears Homers keys rattle when opening the front door, so she opens the door for him, about to blow up in rage. But when he holds up some chocolates and the rose and tells her he loves her, Marge's rage melts away and she forgives him.

Bart once again prank calls Moe again, this time looking for Oliver Clozoff and laughs with Lisa when he's fooled again. Homer lays out his plan for the evening with Marge. She calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service, after she hung up the phone upon hearing Moe, thinking it was a crosswire. Unfortunately, the receptionist immediately refuses the services of their babysitters when she identified herself as Mrs.Simpson. This was because, her kids are on the ""No! No! No!"" poster due to their prevous misbehavior to their babysitters and as a result the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service has decided to refuse service of their babysitters to the Simpson family. However, Homer successfully call for a babysitter as Mr.Samson and the receptionist aks him if his wife called in earlier. Homer says no and tells her that it's Samson, not Simpson. The receptionist is relieved as she complains about the Simpson kids and their scary father, irritating him. Continuing to pretend to be Mr.Samson, Homer calmly convinces her that the Simpsons are their neighbors and they're just misunderstood, but highly respectful people. After getting a babysitter, Lisa watches Marge get ready, and Bart watches Homer get ready for their date. A 6-foot tall, frightening looking and intimidating lady named Ms.Botz, their baby sitter, arrives with her own suitcases. Marge tells her that Maggie needs to be put to bed right away, but Lisa and Bart can stay up for an extra hour watching ""The Happy Little Elves Meets The Curious Cub"" After that, they head out for their romantic night in the town while the kids are safe with their babysitter. In the living room, Bart tries to get Ms.Botz to agree to alternate TV show viewing other than the elves since they've seen it too many times. However, she quickly puts him in his place with her menacing threat because she has dealt with children like him before. Bart is forced to watch ""The Happy Little Elves"" with Lisa, while Ms.Botz puts Maggie to bed.

At the restaurant, Homer picks out his lobster for dinner. While at the house Bart can't stand The Happy Little Elves anymore and turns on the TV. Back at the restaurant Marge and Homer enjoy their dinner and Mambo dancing. At the house, Bart and Lisa watch a report about the Baby Sitter Bandit on Americas Most Armed and Dangerous. They start to get scared right away as the reporter tells of a baby sitter who ties up the children and then ransacks the house. Bart and Lisas fears come true when a picture of Ms. Botz as the Baby Sitter Bandit is shown as Lucille Botzcowski. Just then Ms.Botz walks in the living room with rope to tie up a screaming Bart and Lisa.

Act Three:

Bart runs downstairs to the basement while Lisa runs to the kitchen to call the toll free fugitive hotline, but the phone lines are busy. Meanwhile, Marge and Homer make their way to the motel. Back at the house, Bart is captured in the basement by Ms.Botz and Lisa finally makes it through the busy hotline. Just as she is about to report Ms. Botz, Lisa is also captured and tied up. Ms Botz places a tied up Bart and Lisa on the couch and goes to ransack the house.

Meanwhile, Marge and Homer have made it to the motel and are enjoying each others company. At the house, Maggie wakes up, while Ms.Botz ransacks Homer and Marges room, and heads downstairs. Once in the living room, Maggie unties Bart and Lisa. While Ms. Botz ransacks another room Maggie crawls by and Ms. Botz follows her to tie her up as well. Maggie leads Ms Botz into another room where Bart is waiting with a baseball bat, he knocks Ms.Botz out. The kids quickly escape from the house just as Marge calls from the motel. When no one answers the phone, Marge gets worried and she and Homer decide to head back home. The kids make their way to a pay phone and call the fugitive hotline to inform them of their capture of the Baby Sitter Bandit.

Meanwhile, Homer and Marge arrive back home to find Ms.Botz tied up in the living room. They unite her and Homer pays her triple her fee as she quickly drives away. Just as Ms.Botz drives off, the police arrive to arrest her. As Homer realizes what he has done, microphones and cameras are shoved in his face, and he makes a fool of himself as he quickly tries to lie and explain how the Baby Sitter Bandit got away from him. Marge consoles Homer, who feels stupid, as they watch his interview on the news before going to bed."

They stop to see if the person is injured, however both of them end up being killed by this person.

In the small, Virginia town of Mystic Falls, Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) and her brother Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) cannot come to grips with the fact that their parents had recently died in an crash involving their car driving off the edge of Wickery Bridge and that they are being looked after by their aunt, Jenna (Sara Canning), who acts more like their friend than a parent. Elena becomes emotionally withdrawn after recently breaking up with her boyfriend and former best friend, Matt, while Jeremy turns to drugs to avoid dealing with his own feelings. At school, Elena bumps into the mysterious new student, Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), after she had just walked out of the men's restroom. The mystery guy attracts Elena's and clearly Caroline's attention.

Elena goes to the cemetery to visit her parents' grave and write in her diary. While writing, a crow appears and refuses to move even when she attempts to scare it away. Suddenly, fog begins to cover everything and Elena starts running, dropping her journal. She trips, gets hurt, and upon standing up, finds Stefan there. While they talk, the smell of blood from Elena's leg seems to cause some changes in Stefan's face who vanishes as Elena lifts her pant leg up to check on the cut. He later goes to Elena's house to apologize for vanishing and returns her journal to her. He reassures her that he didn't read it, seeing as he wouldn't want anyone reading his. Moments later, Elena invites Stefan to The Mystic Grill with Matt, Caroline and Bonnie.

Matt seems upset about his break up with Elena so he talks to Bonnie about it. Caroline walks in so Bonnie goes to talk to her. They take a seat and wait for Stefan and Elena to arrive. Afterwards, Stefan is invited to a campfire party which he agreed to go to if Elena goes to. She agreed.

At the Salvatore house, Zach (Chris William Martin), after seeing the news about the two people who were attacked by an animal, asks Stefan why he came back and why he attacked these people despite his promise not to hurt anyone. Stefan denies that he had anything to do with the attack and leaves to attend the campfire party where Elena will be.

Elena's friend, Bonnie (Kat Graham), tries to make fun of her grandmother who told her that she is a psychic, but she gets a picture of fog, a crow and a cemetery when she touches Elena. Intuitively, she suspects something is strange about Stefan when they meet up at a campfire party after Bonnie touched Stefan. She felt blackness. Death.

Matt's sister Vicki (Kayla Ewell) is found by Jeremy in the woods, bitten by something they believe to be an animal. Stefan realizes that there is someone else in town who is like him and who is also responsible for the first two attacks and he runs back home; Matt watches him and thinks he is acting weird. As his sister is losing a lot of blood, Matt chooses to ignore the red flag. He informs Zach about it and then Stefan's brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder), appears.

Stefan confronts Damon why he is in Mystic Falls despite his dislike of the town. Damon answers that he is in town because of Elena, who looks similar to a girl named Katherine whom Stefan keeps a picture of from 1864. Damon tells Stefan to feed on Elena and the siblings get into a fight. Damon, who is much stronger than his brother because he is feeding on human blood, beats Stefan. Damon takes Stefan's ring which seems important for their survival though its features still seem mysterious, but he then gives it back.

In the meantime, Vicki wakes up at the hospital with Matt by her side. She whispers the words ""vampire"" and then drifts back to sleep. Matt is concerned but doesn't want to wake her."

We've seen Stefan when he's sober and we've also seen him when he's drunk, whether on alcohol or on human blood. But now it's time to really turn the tables on The Vampire Diaries and reveal Stefan for who he really is: a closet blood junkie!

Stefan's a Liar and a Thief

Stefan is still struggling with his human blood addiction and the disturbance he caused in the blood bank just confirms that he really is out of control. What's worse is that he's been lying about it to his girlfriend Elena and his brother Damon, who luckily can see right through him. Stefan isn't pleased about his brother's meddling, especially when Damon spills the beans to Elena and even takes his place as Elena's date at the Founder's Day Gala, where Stefan targets and feeds on his next victim, Amber. Now, he's locked up in the Salvatore basement thanks to Elena's shot of vervain, making room for more Damon-Elena moments.

Bonnie's Back

After skipping town to mourn the death of Grams, Bonnie returns to Mystic Falls and she's cooler than ever. She's warmed up to Caroline and has become cold as stone to Elena because she still blames Stefan and Damon for what happened to her grandmother. But that's not the best part. It looks like she's also been practicing her powers, which seem to work perfectly fine when she used it to stop Stefan from further ravishing Amber.

Uncle John and Pearl

The cloud surrounding Uncle John hasn't cleared up one bit but at least we know why he's not telling on Damon, at least for now. He wants Damon to track down one of Jonathan Gilbert's old inventions, which he suspects is in the possession of Pearl. But Damon doesn't want to help John because he can't really give him what he wants--which is to find Katherine. By the end of the episode, Pearl gives the compass to Damon as a truce while John gains some sort of leverage upon learning that Pearl is the one who wants to buy Elena's father's office and that Jeremy's friend, Anna, is Pearl's daughter.

And now we know the rest of the story--that is the story behind how Stefan and Damon came to be vampires on The Vampire Diaries.

Stefan and Damon's Turn

The Vampire Diaries takes a trip down memory lane, courtesy of Stefan's human blood addiction, and it's 1860s all over again. We specifically time travel to the time when the Salvatore brothers are trying to rescue Katherine from Jonathan Gilbert and his torch-wielding men, who are rounding up all the vampires to seal in the Tomb. In the process of saving Katherine, however, Damon and Stefan get shot by their own father, who already considered his sons dead the moment they sided with the vampires. Damon and Stefan survive, thanks to the blood of Katherine. Apparently, Katherine had been compelling Stefan to drink her blood weeks before she was captured, while Damon voluntarily took it.

Stefan's transition, though somewhat accidental, reveals the most disturbing yet interesting story about the death of his father. Stefan killed his own father as a form of self-defense after his father tried to stab him. And though Stefan wanted to die rather than to turn into a vampire, he wasn't strong enough to resist his father's bloody chest wound so he eventually drank his blood and then became a full-fledged vampire. Damon, on the other hand, doesn't want to go through the transition anymore since he believes Katherine already died when the villagers set fire to the church. But Stefan convinces his brother and even brings a woman he can feed on. Of course, Damon becomes a vampire but swears to make an eternity of misery for Stefan--not because he turned him into a vampire, but because Katherine chose to turn Stefan too.

The Unlikely Alliance

Back in the present, we see the most unlikely alliance: Damon and Alaric teaming up on yet another mission. This time, they head to a house in Grove Hill in hopes of finding Isobel. While the mission itself doesn't reveal much, except for John Gilbert helping the vampires from the Tomb, it makes them realize how much they have in common since both are searching for answers about the women in their lives none of them really want to know. Alaric eventually decides he's done looking for Isobel but life is full of ironies because it turns out Isobel has been looking for him too.

The Tragic End

Good things are finally happening between Jeremy and Anna, who even enrolled in high school so she could be with him. But a happy ending doesn't seem to be in the cards for this couple since Anna has to leave town with her mother Pearl, who decides to leave Mystic Falls after an ugly confrontation with John Gilbert. Anna quietly says goodbye to Jeremy only to discover later that Harper and her mother are dead.

As for Elena, who didn't really do much other than to convince Stefan not to commit suicide by sunlight, she'll deal with bigger and better things in next week's episode as she comes face to face with her birth mother Isobel.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636337/?ref_=ttep_ep21,,Isobel returns to town and stuns Alaric with her attitude and her demands that he arrange a meeting with Elena.,[],TV-14,Release date,['J. Miller Tobin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['witch', 'interracial friendship', 'bar', 'forbidden love', 'small town']",[],"Synopsis Submitted by: BuddyTV.com

There are a lot of things going on in this episode of The Vampire Diaries but the main focus is on Elena. On one hand, she's dealing with the fact her spiteful birthmother is in town. On the other, she's also dealing with an angry brother who doesn't want anything to do with her. Plus, there's a bunch of other stuff like tainted friendships, hidden romantic feelings and some daddy drama.

Meeting Isobel The much-awaited reunion between Alaric and his dead vampire wife Isobel finally happens but it doesn't really reveal much except for the fact Isobel is now a different, more wicked person, and the main reason she's in Mystic Falls is to get Jonathan Gilbert's device, now in Damon's possession. Knowing Damon deeply cares for Elena, Isobel orders Alaric to set up a meeting with her daughter, who then agrees to face her birth mother since she doesn't have a choice. Unfortunately, the meeting doesn't go well because instead of getting answers on who her birth father is, all Elena gets is the burden of knowing if she doesn't get the device from Damon, Isobel will be going on a killing spree of the people she cares about.

Isobel's Game Plan

There's no such thing as a coincidence on The Vampire Diaries, so assuming Isobel's arrival in Mystic Falls has something to do with John Gilbert is pretty easy. What most of us didn't know is they're actually working together to recover Jonathan Gilbert's device as part of Katherine's orders. And Isobel's game plan is just part of a bigger game plan Katherine cooked up--which is to use the device (a weapon against vampires) to kill all the vampires from the tomb, including Damon and Stefan.

Jonathan Gilbert's Device

It turns out Jonathan never really invented anything but Emily made it look like he did because, although she pledged her loyalty to Katherine, she still couldn't stand the fact a lot of people were suffering. Of course, we learn this through Bonnie, courtesy of Emily's spell book. After Elena gets the device from Damon, Bonnie tries to help Elena by casting a spell on the device to rid it of its power before giving it to Isobel. But apparently, Bonnie is one devious little witch because she just lied to Elena and didn't do what she promised.

History Repeats Itself

The Damon and Elena pairing, though nothing official has happened yet, is getting more screen time even now Stefan is well from his human blood addiction and back to his boring old self. Damon obviously enjoys the banter between him and Elena whenever they talk on the phone and has made it pretty clear to Isobel threatening the people he cares about, especially Elena, is not OK. If that's not enough, even Isobel points out to Elena that Damon's in love with her that's why he easily gave her the device. All the Damon-Elena closeness is finally sinking in on Stefan, so he threatens Damon not to go down that road again. But it looks like Damon isn't about to give up that easily. Wow, this episode really does make you feel sorry for Damon and wish he and Elena can be together instead of Stefan. But maybe that's just me.

Daddy Issues

Damon was right when he said that things are going into an interesting direction on The Vampire Diaries. We learn Isobel and John Gilbert dated way back then and their relationship resulted into a daughter, also known as Elena. It's too bad (or good) Stefan will have to break this big bombshell to Elena while Damon will once again shine as the ""friend"" who's always there to listen.

Other Developments:

-Matt and Tyler are still at odds but are on the road to patching things up.

-It turns out Isobel isn't completely dead inside because not only does she want what's best for Elena (by getting rid of the Salvatore vamps), she also cares enough to erase Alaric's memory so his heart will be Isobel free once and for all.

-Jeremy tells Elena he knows what Anna is and he has been reading her journal, which reveals his memory of Vicki has been erased. He also learns more about his family's history through Uncle John.

-Anna tells Jeremy about her mom's death and feels helpless than ever.

Jerry says that the button is too high and it looks like George lives with his mother. Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who's coming to New York, and they discuss whether her intentions are romantic. Laura teaches Political Science and he met her, when he did the show in Lansing. Jerry tells George that Laura is coming in for a seminar and said that maybe they will get together. George says that Jerry is a back-up, he a plan-B, a contingency. Jerry doesn't know what hotel she is staying at, so he cannot call her. She didn't make any firm plans, and its Saturday night.

The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. Kesser ruined the night for Jerry by revealing the outcome of the Mets game. Jerry had taped the game and had avoided human contact all night to watch it at night. Kessler hasn't been out of the building in 10 years. Kessler claims that he was almost a lawyer.

However, Jerry then receives a telephone call from Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment as she could not find a decent hotel room in NYC. Though Jerry agrees, he's still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George on the other hand, believes, this is the signal. Jerry and George continue to debate the issue, with the former determined to find the true nature of her visit. Jerry brings in an extra bed for Laura to sleep in. George says that this is the signal since it is not possible that Laura did not find a decent hotel room in the whole city.

While waiting at the airport for Laura to arrive, Jerry and George try to identify the possible signals Laura might give upon her arrival, with George explaining the meaning of various greetings (Luggage kept down before the hug is a good sign, anything in the lip area is good, the shoulder hugs, but with hips wide apart are bad, the hand sandwich (with one hand at the bottom and other hand on the top) is ambiguous as everything depends on the layering, and so on.

However, when Laura arrives, her greeting is ambiguous. She grabs Jerry from behind (the surprise blindfold) and never puts her bags down. Upon arriving at Jerry's apartment Laura removes her shoes and some excess clothes to get comfortable, asks for wine, turns down the light and asks if she can stay over a second night. As Jerry removes his shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone, she tells Jerry: ""Never get engaged."" Jerry then realizes that he has no chance with Laura but has already committed himself - and his one-bedroom apartment - to an entire weekend with her, including a 5-hour sightseeing boat ride around Manhattan."

Elaine invites him to a birthday party; he agrees to go on the condition that she accompanies him to a wedding to which he and his parents have been invited. Jerry's parents are coming into town for the wedding.

At the party, Jerry meets an attractive woman named Vanessa (Lynn Clark). During the party, Laney tries to tell Jerry about a dream she had, which featured him. Jerry tries to end the conversation. Jerry wants to flirt with her but is uncomfortable doing so in Laney's presence, as he thinks that Vanessa thinks that Laney is Jerry's date. Plus, Vanessa has also come to the party with a male escort, whom Jerry assumes to be Vanessa's date. The woman leaves with another man before Jerry finds out her name; however, he learns that she works at a law firm called ""Sagman, Bennett, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft"" and is a lawyer. Jerry cutting off Elaine in the middle of her ""dream"" discussion results in an argument after the party is over. Elaine says that Jerry needs to work on his manners as he couldn't wait to get back to his conversation with Vanessa.

Back at his apartment, Jerry's parents, Morty (Philip Burns) and Helen (Lix Sheridan), sleep over, with Jerry sleeping in Kramer's apartment. He talks about the party and claims that he can't get the phone number of the woman from Laney because he doesn't talk about other women with her; additionally, she's still angry with him. Jerry claims that he and Elaine broke up as they fought a lot for some reason. There was also a problem with their physical chemistry. Elaine was just not the one.

Morty suggests that Jerry ""stake out"" the woman by waiting outside her office, an idea which Jerry likes. Morty says that Jerry needs to stand by the elevator and wait for Vanessa to come down for lunch. When Jerry meets Vanessa he will pretend that he bumped into her. The following day, Jerry and George perform the stake out, pretending that they're coming to see someone else in the building named ""Art Corvelay"", but under pressure, George insists that they make it ""Art Vandelay"". Art is an importer exporter. George pretends to be an architect who designs railroads. They meet the woman, who says the man with whom she left the party was her cousin. They then decide to go out on a date.

Later that night, Jerry finds out from Helen that Laney knows about the stake out. She left a note for Jerry saying that she hoped his meeting went well with Art Vandelay. Jerry is nervous. On the day of the wedding, Laney tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was that it was the first time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able to talk more about their relationships if they wish to remain friends. Laney then reveals that she's recently met a man using a stake out."

Jerry tells Elaine about the issues with his apartment. The hot water takes a while to come on, the refrigerator doesn't work properly, and everything goes bad 2 days before its expiration date, the steam has been on in the radiator for the last 10 years and so on. Elaine is looking forward to spending the weekend at Jerry's. Laney is having trouble with an irritating roommate, Tina (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), who's a ""Waiter/Actor"" hoping to get a part, and asks George if he can find her some new accommodation. Elaine cannot kick Tina out as she is on the lease.

She then tries to persuade Jerry to give her his current apartment, with George offering Jerry a new apartment on W. 83rd St. by Central Park which he claims is great, but Jerry declines the offer. The rent is twice what Jerry pays now, and it has 2 bedrooms. When Jerry returns, he finds the apartment has been burglarized because Kramer left the front door open by mistake. Kramer was cooking in his apartment and came in to borrow the spatula, and never closed the front door. Jerry doesn't have insurance as he spent his money on a top-of-the-line lock. As a way of making up, Kramer promises to find the items that were stolen from Jerry. Jerry lost a TV, a VCR, Stereo, a computer, a leather jacket and his answering machine.

After the robbery, Laney still asks Jerry to give her the apartment. Jerry decides to have a look around the new apartment first. The apartment is great and Jerry takes it, letting Laney move into his old apartment. The apartment has a fireplace, a walk-in closet, great natural light and a garden. Jerry is about to sign the lease to the apartment, but George tells him that if he has second thoughts, he shouldn't take it. This results in him thinking that George may want the new apartment for himself. George says that he only wants the apartment if Jerry doesn't want it. They have an argument resulting in neither of them wanting to move, as they think that the other one wants the apartment. They gamble for the apartment and Jerry wins. Jerry flips a coin, and George calls, but then George claims that the coin hit the table, and calls interference. The coin cannot touch anything as that's a rule. Meanwhile, Kramer claims that he thinks he knows where Jerry's stolen objects are and suspects an Englishman along the hall who denies having any ""stuff"" on him. The Englishman swallowed when Kramer said that he knew about the stuff.

Later in Monk's Cafe, Jerry goes back on the deal and decides not to take the place because George wants it. They continue to argue about who should own it and decided that neither of them should take it. A waiter, Carolyn, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waiter invites them and Laney to her housewarming, but it's clear that Jerry, George and Laney aren't enjoying themselves. Elaine lost her deposit on the U-Haul and she sold her couch. They overhear 2 people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all 3 ask what the apartment's rent is."

They went to see a play, during which he put his hand in his pocket to get some money and accidentally got some dental floss stuck to his hand. George worries that his girlfriend is going to leave him because of it. Jerry says that it is more likely that the girl breaks up with George due to his fanny pack.

Jerry and George have tickets to an upcoming Knicks game. Jerry has problems with a childhood friend, Joel Horneck (Kevin Dunn), who persists in keeping in touch with him. Joel and Jerry lived 3 houses from each other back when they were kids. He had a ping pong table, and they were friends. Jerry has never answered a phone call from Joel in the last 7 years, but this time Kramer picked up the phone and handed it to Jerry. He doesn't like Joel, who pays attention to nothing that Jerry says. Jerry claims that he feels uncomfortable ""breaking up with"" Joel, so George suggests that he should pretend that Joel is a woman and break up normally. Jerry thus tries to break up with Joel at Monk's Cafe, but when he does, Joel bursts into tears. Joel says that Jerry is one of the few people he can talk to. Deeply uncomfortable, Jerry assures Joel, he didn't mean it, and agrees to take him to see the New York Knicks, although he was supposed to take George.

As George tells Jerry that his girlfriend no longer wants to see him, Jerry tells George that he gave away George's ticket to Joel. George gets very upset, so Jerry offers George his own ticket for the game. George doesn't go to the game because he doesn't know Joel, so Jerry decides to give Joel both tickets, claiming that he can't make the game because he's tutoring his nephew.

Later, when talking to his ex-girlfriend Laney, she tries to provide Jerry with a list of excuses to help him avoid Joel. He later discovers that Joel took Kramer to the game and that Joel is in the building. Turns out Kramer has sold Joel into his Pizza place idea and now both are like best friends. When Joel meets Jerry and Laney, Joel invites them out to another Knicks game. They come up with more unusual excuses in an effort to avoid going out. However, Joel then gets out a newspaper with the schedule for all Knicks games and tries to organize a time when they can all meet, weeks in advance. Jerry realizes that no matter what excuses he comes up with, he can't avoid Joel.

Kramer, working under the name ""Kramerica Industries"", conceptualizes building ""a pizza place where you make your own pizza pie."" Jerry and George try to talk Kramer out of the idea, but Kramer is determined to go on with it. This is a place where they give you the dough, you smash it, pound it, fling it in the air, put the sauce, the cheese and slide it into the oven. Kramer's pizza parlor idea reappears in later episodes like ""The Puffy Shirt"" in Season 5 and ""The Couch"" in Season 6."

He wont even consider going away for the weekend because of the cats. Jerry contemplates asking his girlfriend Vanessa to go away on a holiday together. George advises against that as Jerry has been going out with her for only a month, and he is not yet ready to spend 72 continuous hours with her. George reads the business section of the newspaper, where he learns that a stock to which a friend of a friend of his-Simon's friend Wilkinson-had tipped him off had gone up. Wilkinson is supposed to have made a fortune in the stock market. He has a big thing going on with some sort of a merger and it is real hush hush. The company is Centrax who has a new way of televising Opera. George decides to invest $5000 in the stock and persuades Jerry to invest $2,500.

Jerry is in a grocery store with Vanessa, after they visited the cinema. He manages to persuade Vanessa to go away with him to a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont. He says that this is a great way to accelerate their relationship. Meanwhile, he reads the newspaper in hope that his stock has gone up, but it's in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer tells Jerry that his stock has fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson (Benjamin Lum), who gave the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. Wilkinson has not been to his home or office in 3 days. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. While visiting the dry cleaner, Jerry tells George that he wants to sell his stock, but George insists that the tip is good and they should keep the stock. Eventually, George says he'll go and visit Wilkinson to find out what they should do, despite the fact that George doesn't know him personally.

At Jerry's apartment, Laney says that the only way that she can get rid of Robert's cats is if they should have some form of ""accident"" and offers Jerry the job, but he refuses. Kramer tells Jerry that his stock has fallen yet again. Jerry is down a total of $1500 by this point. George then returns from visiting Wilkinson but has no info because he was kicked out of the hospital when Wilkinson saw him. Jerry decides to sell his shares, while George decides to ""go down with the ship"". Jerry takes Vanessa to Vermont, but rainy weather keeps them stuck inside the bed-and-breakfast. He regrets going with her because boredom causes them to argue. Jerry reads the business section of the newspaper to see what happened to the stock since he sold it. The stock has risen dramatically (Jerry is out $4000 due to the stock rise). Vanessa then claims that Jerry only took her to a cheap place in Vermont because he lost so much money. Back in New York, George is celebrating the rising price of his stock, which has increased by $8,000. Laney says that she gave Robert an ultimatum, and he chose the cats. George then tells Jerry and Laney that Wilkinson has another stock tip involving some sort of ""robot butcher."""

Germany, present day. In a forested area, in an underground bunker, is a cache of weapons, grenades, gas masks, etc. Pinned to a wall are photographs of different people in groupings that show each in their youth, adulthood, and old age. A voice-over says that while we think time is linear, the distinction between past, present and future is nothing but an illusion; that yesterday, today and tomorrow are connected in a never-ending circle.

June 21, 2019

A man is at a workbench in the bunker, sealing an envelope. He places it on the workbench, steps under a noose and hangs himself. The envelope, which leans next to a photo of the man with who appears to be his wife, son, and an older woman, says, DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 PM.

A boy wakes up with a start and sits up in bed. He takes a prescription pill.

CREDITS

November 4, 2019

The boy comes downstairs to the living area. The lights don't turn on and the refrigerator light doesn't come on. He sniffs at the contents of a bottle, frowns, and calls upstairs to his mother, pointing out that the power is out again. His mom is in her bed, having sex with someone. She bemoans the fact that at 16, the boy should know how to make his own toast.

As they put on their clothes, the partner asks the mom if she will be attending tonight's meeting. She instead asks if Katharina will be there. The mom tells Ulrich (Oliver Masucci) that she loves him and kisses him. (He does not say it back; instead telling her she's beautiful.) On the dresser is the same photograph from earlier, with the older woman torn out of the picture. Ulrich sneaks out the second floor window and climbs down to ground level.

The boy bikes down a forest road. There are two nuclear power plant cooling towers in the near distance. On a light pole along the road is a ""missing"" poster for Erik Obendorf, a red-haired teen.

Ulrich jogs through a lightly forested area, passing a sign that says ""WINDEN CAVES 0.6 MILES.""

We see a dark cave under a rock formation.

The boy is walking with a man through a lightly forested area. The man asks how he's been these past two months. The man then says the boy doesn't have to talk about it, and that he's read the notes from his therapy sessions and group meetings and seems to be doing well. The boy says he still sees ""him"" (his dad). The man asks why the boy thinks he's still seeing him. The boy asks the man that as his therapist, shouldn't he be explaining this to the boy. The therapist asks if he's still taking his meds and the boy nods. The boy thinks the dad is just trying to tell him something, or maybe he wants the dad to tell him something. The therapist asks the boy what he thinks that might be. Angrily, the boy answers, ""Why; why he left; why did he hang himself; and, why he didn't leave a word, no explanation.""

Elsewhere, we see the same photo again, intact. The older woman is sitting with a wooden memory box. She opens it, and the envelope from earlier is inside. She listens to a radio report about the Winden Nuclear Power Plant, how it had been built in 1960's and is now scheduled for decommissioning in 2020.

Elsewhere, a mom rushes to get her son off to school. She notices a young boy, Mikkel (Daan Lennard Liebrenz), dressed in a skeleton costume and she tells him to go change. He replies that, as a magician, he has to dress the part. She then asks Mikkel's older sister (Lisa Vicari) to come eat something. The sister indignantly asks if the mom is sure her brother wasn't adopted. An older boy comes in, cuffs Mikkel on the head, and asks if the mom has seen his hoodie. Ulrich comes in, apologizing for his tardiness, because the line at the bakery was long. The mom takes a book from the sister's hand and gives her a croissant, but she says she's on a hunger strike - as long as a child is starving, she won't be eating. Mikkel grabs the croissant. The sister asks for her script back and the mom gives her another croissant instead, saying her starving won't help anyone. The older boy comes back in, cuffs Mikkel, and says he still can't find his hoodie. The mom notices Mikkel is still in his costume and says he will make them all late for school. Ulrich asks Mikkel to do one trick and then go change. The mom sighs in frustration.

The boy from before, Jonas (Louis Hofmann), is standing at the perimeter of the school grounds, watching as all the students are watching him. His friend comes up and cuffs him in the head. A group of kids pass by next to them and say, ""What a freak."" The friend tells Jonas that he told everyone that Jonas was on a two-month exchange in France, playing hide-the-baguette. Jonas is not amused and just keeps staring back at the other students. The friend sobers up and tells Jonas to relax and leads him inside. Jonas asks if anything happened while he was away, and the friend says, not much, except that thing with Erik.

Ulrich enters the police station as the parents of Erik Obendorf are demanding action and answers from the police chief. The chief assures them that the entire department is working on the case with interviews, searches, and combing the forest. She says that it would help if they calmed down. The mom spits in her face. Ulrich and other cops try to calm the situation. Ulrich says that this may not have been a crime, that Erik has run away before. The father agrees but Erik has always returned after two days; it has been 13. Ulrich promises they'll find Erik.

We see the silhouette of a man in a rain slicker as he stands at the mouth of the dark cave. There is an abandoned armchair a few feet from the cave.

Magnus (Moritz Jahn), the older son at Ulrich's house, is sneaking a smoke at school. He plays it cool when a girl walks by, but she comes back around. He asks if she should be hanging out with the geeks. Franziska (Gina Stiebitz) asks if the son of the principal should be sneaking a joint at school. She takes a drag, and says its shit weed.

Jonas and the friend are at a school assembly. Jonas smiles brightly when a girl, the Mikkel's sister, walks into the row they are seated at, but he frowns when she sits down next to his friend and kisses him. The friend admits that something DID happen when Jonas was a way. She asks Jonas how France was.

The mom at Ulrich's house is the school principal, Katharina (Jördis Triebel). She addresses the assembly about Erik Obendorf and says they can all feel comfortable about telling the school staff anything about the case.

Ulrich is with the police chief. Erik has left no trace, as if he didn't want to be found. There was still money under his bed, and his phone. All they have are scores of tire tracks on the forest road between the school and town. Ulrich still thinks it's a runaway case, not foul play. The police chief reminds him of what happened to his brother. Ulrich says this case has nothing to do with that and gets up. Before he can close the door, the chief says his mother called the emergency line again this morning, and that he's probably due for a visit. Ulrich asks the chief if she's ever wondered where her life took a wrong turn, and that her life turned out the opposite of what she wanted it to be, and closes the door behind him. The chief looks at a family photograph on her desk - herself, her husband (Stephan Kampwirth), the therapist from earlier, Franziska, and another girl.

At the Winden Forest Hotel. A manager behind the front desk, Regina Tideman (Deborah Kaufmann), has her head in her hands and seems annoyed when the phone rings. The caller speaks for a while before she makes pleading offers regarding a loan and payments on the loan. She becomes sarcastic, asking if he (the caller) would like to stay at a hotel in a town where a boy has just gone missing - that she has a family suite available - he can bring his kids. She starts swearing at the caller and he hangs up. She slams the phone back onto the cradle.

Franziska is giving a report on black holes. The friend wonders to Jonas if the darkest hole is in Franziska's ass. They laugh. The friend also wonders, seriously, that if Erik did not run away and instead met with foul play, if his stash of drugs is still at the cave. The friend says they can go get it.

Ulrich is at his mother's apartment. He asks where his dad is; she says he should come by more often. She says she saw a dark figure with a large head in the forest. She says there are things we can't understand. She reaches into a drawer and gives Ulrich a ""Raider"" candy bar wrapper that she found in the forest, saying that Mads loved those. She says Erik's disappearance matches Mads' disappearance 33 years ago. Ulrich looks on sadly.

At the Winden Rest Home. An old man with a bad cauliflower ear, keeps repeating, It's going to happen again.

Elsewhere, Erik, his hands covering his ears, is lying on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed in a room, sparsely decorated with books and toys and child-themed wallpaper, and the video for ""You Spin Me Round"" by Dead or Alive blaring on a small TV, and an electric chair situated in the middle. The room has a steel door, and there us an untouched tray of food in front of it.

After class, Jonas asks his friend what they would do with the drugs? The friend suggests they smoke half of it themselves, and if there is a market for the rest, that the can sell it. Magnus and his sister join them and Jonas tells them they're going to the caves tonight. Bartosz (Paul Lux), the friend, kisses the sister, much to Jonas' consternation. The sister thinks there is a lot of weird stuff happening in the forest, including a rumored five-legged squirrel resulting from the proximity to the nuclear plant. Magnus exchanges hellos with Franziska as she passes by. The sister chides Magnus for having a crush on Franziska.

Jonas' mom is parked outside the nuclear plant when she gets a cell call from Ulrich. She says she's still not sure if she'll be going to the meeting, because everyone will be there gawking at her. Ulrich says he has a weekend of training in Frankfort and will be staying at a hotel and hopes she can join him.

Katharina is back home and finds Magnus' hoodie. She notices a long strand of hair on it. She sniffs the hoodie and is put off. We see a family photo of herself, Ulrich, Magnus, the sister, and Mikkel.

Jonas' mom wheels a large case through a passageway at the nuclear plant. Set up in an office, she gives a therapeutic massage to a man, noticing a large discoloration near his shoulders. She says that stress could cause his muscles to tighten up, and he agrees that the current situation has been getting to him. He says it will all end within the year, that he first came to Winden 33 years ago, and never thought that it would end like this. He expresses his sympathy about, her late husband, Michael, and asks how Jonas is. She says they (she and Jonas) are good.

Jonas' mom, Hannah (Maja Schöne), has left a message for the older woman, letting her know the power at the house went out again, and that if she wants to run them out of the house to just say so. Hannah is angry that Jonas hasn't been able to see the older woman, his grandmother, for three months. The grandmother takes out the envelope from her memory box and looks at the clock; it's a quarter past 6 PM.

Hannah goes to the school (it's a little before 8 PM). Katharina sees her in the hallway and gives Hannah a hug. She says she'll meet Hannah inside at the meeting.

Jonas bikes to the cave. Mikkel's sister is already there, walking a stone fence top like a tightrope, holding a flashlight. She tries to explain what happened with her and Bartosz over the summer, but Jonas says it's alright. As she talks, she says she just had a déjà vu - as if all of this already happened before. Jonas smiles and calls it a glitch in the matrix. She also smiles and calls it a message from the other side.

Magnus shows up, but he has Mikkel in tow because the sitter had a stomach bug. Mikkel is in his skeleton costume. The sister says Mikkel can't stay, but Mikkel insists he's not a child anymore; Magnus says SHE would have to take Mikkel home. Bartosz shows up and cuffs Mikkel in the head. Magnus says only he can cuff Mikkel, and cuffs Mikkel. They head off.

The old man from the Rest Home is walking down the middle of the street, still mumbling, It's going to happen again.

At the parents' meeting, the police chief, Charlotte (Karoline Eichhorn), is reporting the status of the police investigation. She urges the parents to listen to what their children are talking about and report anything that is relevant to Erik's disappearance. Katharina says they have new security measures at the school. Regina reminds her that they do not know what happened with Erik, so how could they have any new security measures. Hannah is in the back of the auditorium, anxiously waiting for Ulrich; he instead texts her to say that he'll be outside in 5 minutes (just after 10 PM). She leaves.

Mikkel asks the group what they think happened to Erik. The kids at his school say that Erik was kidnapped and locked in a basement somewhere. Magnus tells him to shut up. The sister says that despite what adults tell them, that most people are nice, that there are some real creeps in the world. Jonas says that his father used to say, good and evil is a matter of perspective. Bartosz and the sister look at him sadly. Jonas asks, Dead dad, bad subject? Mikkel asks if Erik was dead somewhere, even then, he would still want to be found.

Katharina urges the parents to stick together. Regina says it's more important not to blow the situation out of proportion, and have the press invading their town. Katharina says Regina thinks that way because of the possible effect on her hotel. Regina counters that she is more concerned about their whole town. Katharina says it's not even that, that it's about a missing child. Then Regina says that Katharina should worry about her own personal problems. Katharina, looking puzzled, says she doesn't know what Regina is talking about.

The old man from the Rest Home, Helge (Hermann Beyer), walks into the auditorium and says and says It's going to happen again; but that it's already too late. Charlotte intercepts him and says she'll take him back to the Home.

Jonas' grandmother is clutching Michael's envelope while staring at the clock; it's just after 10 PM.

The group walks past the nuclear plant. Jonas stops to stare at the towers.

Ulrich meets Hannah outside the school and they start making out.

Jonas' grandmother opens the envelope.

Bartosz goes up to the armchair and looks under the cushion. There is nothing there. Franziska walks out from the cave holding a large zip-lock bag. She offers to sell it to Bartosz, that what's in the bag is easily worth 500, but she'll sell it to him for 200 since his dad has a lot of money. He shoves her to the ground and takes the bag. A deep roaring sound comes from the cave. The sounds of ground cover rustling come from all around them. Their flashlights flicker. They run; Jonas has Mikkel in tow.

Jonas' grandmother leafs through the folded sheets of paper with handwriting on widely spaced lines.

The group keeps running through the forest. Jonas falls and loses sight of Mikkel and the group. A voice calls his name. He turns around and sees his father, Michael, with blood dripping down his head and face. Jonas runs.

Jonas' grandmother folds the sheets back up.

It's raining heavily. The group stops back in town and notices Mikkel is not with them. Jonas says he thought Mikkel was with the group. The group, angry, runs back to the forest.

Charlotte walks Helge outside. He says It's too late. Her cell phone rings.

Ulrich steps back from Hannah when his cell phone rings.

At the meeting, Regina's phone, and then Katharina's phone ring.

Jonas' grandmother returns the envelope to the box and embraces it sadly.

The group watches as police cars pull up. Ulrich jumps out and grabs Magnus. Charlotte hugs Franziska. Regina grabs Bartosz. Hannah hugs Jonas. Ulrich runs into the forest, yelling for Mikkel. The roar sounds again. Ulrich heads into the cave.

It's the morning. Jonas is lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. Hannah is staring blankly from her kitchen table. Katharina is comforting her daughter on their sofa. Ulrich is staring blankly in his squad car on the forest road. Magnus is staring blankly from a bench at the police station; he notices Erik's missing poster.

The police are working the cave entrance with metal detectors. Charlotte asks the captain and he says they haven't found anything.

Charlotte gets a call from her husband, the therapist. He tells her Franziska is sleeping. He has to tell her something, but she is called away. He mumbles the Serenity Prayer to himself.

The police walk a grid. A call on the police radio confirms a child's body has been found at the edge of the forest. Ulrich runs to the site. Charlotte is there, and hugs Ulrich. Ulrich clears off the leaves covering the body and finds a boy wearing a jean jacket and jeans. It is not Mikkel. Next to the boy is a Walkman still playing a cassette tape.

Where Erik is being held, another music video is playing loudly. Erik, gagged, is being strapped into the electric chair. The man, cloaked in a rain slicker with a hood shielding his identity, places a necklace over Eric's head; it has a gold coin pendant. The man closes the chair's metal band around Erik's head.

In the pilot for this new NBC thriller we meet the main players in our story.

First up is Elizabeth Keen. She is a newly-minted FBI agent about to tackle her first day on the job. She is married to Tom Keen. They are in the midst of the adoption process and even though it's her first day on the job they had planned to have a meeting with the agency that day.

Next up is Raymond ""Red"" Reddington an ex-government agent turned mercenary-for-hire and one of the FBI's Most Wanted fugitives, He mysteriously returns and turns himself into the FBI and offers to give up everyone he has ever worked with including a long-thought-dead terrorist but under one condition, he'll only talk to Elizabeth Keen.

Reddington meets with the FBI assistant director Harold Cooper and case agent Donald Ressler. They have him locked in a box and outfitted with a tracking device. We learn that Reddington was a formidable cat who graduated top of his class at the Naval Academy and was being groomed for admiral. But in 1990, he was supposed to come home to see his wife and daughter for Christmas and disappeared. Suddenly, classified documents he had access to began showing up all over the world. He has no country or agenda, his only allegiance is to the highest bidder. He's known as the ""concierge of crime.

Reddington gives them information on the many events that one terrorist named Ranko Zamani was involved in. He's a Serbian national. Reddington says both he and the FBI want this man and so there interests are aligned and this is why he is here. He's listed as dead but Reddington knows he's alive and has entered the U.S. and has a plan. He says he will help them find Zamani but he will speak only with Elizabeth Keen.

As Keen is set to head in for her first day of work as a profiler, cars and copters and Ressler show up to take her to Reddington. (She has no idea what their connection is. But it seems pretty clear that Reddington must be her father.)

She meets with Cooper and he asks her to profile herself for them. She says she has been with the Bureau for 4 years and worked in New York. He doesn't want her resume, but her profile. She says her colleagues call her ""sir,"" and think she is a bitch. She says like most kids who raised themselves she can be narcissistic, withdrawn, and disconnected. She has a deep yearning to understand and relate to the criminal mind. She's board certified in forensic psychology but thinks she can rewrite her history by having kids of her own. She thinks Reddington was waiting for her becasue she's new and thinks she can be easily manipulated but clearly he doesn't know her.

They go to see Reddington at a black ops site known as the Post Office, thanks to its location--in an old post office.

She meets with Reddington, who smiles and laughs when he sees her. He makes note of her appearance and how she's changed it. She asks about Zamani. She asks why her since there's nothing special about her. He says he thinks she's very special. He explains Zamani's plot to abduct the daughter of a U.S. general and the elaborate plan of diversion and that he'll be out of the country quickly and they'll need to move fast to save the girl. He knows this because he's the one who got him into the country. She wonders if she should believe him. He says no since criminals are notorious liars but if anyone who can give him a second chance it's her, whose father a career criminal and her mother who died in weakness and shame. He says he's going to make her famous and calls her Lizzie.

She holds her own but later freaks out with Cooper and Ressler and wonders how he knows these things about her. Her professional opinion is the girl is going to get taken. She calls Tom and says she can't make the adoption appointment.

Her professional opinion is correct, the girl ends up being taken right under everyone's noses through a staged car accident and ambush. Elizabeth is in the car with the little girl Beth when it happens and as she's taken away she promises she will find her. They descend with Beth into boats below the bridge and take off.

Elizabeth goes back to Reddington who says he knows nothing more than about the plot. Reddington says he will trade information with her. He asks personal questions about her--like how she got a scar on her hand (from a fire)-- and then he tells her to look at the situation differently, that she need to look at it like a criminal would.

He goes with her and looks a the wall of evidence they've amassed on Zamani. They tell him to look for a different guy, a Russian chemist/mercenary and a German banker whose most likely moving the money. They deduce that another Zamani event/attack is imminent somewhere in D.C. for revenge against the general's family since the general bombed Zamani's village and killed his family. He tells them how to find the chemist and he wants something in return: freedom from restraint and a suite in a 4 star hotel. They give it to him.

They find the chemist and think they found him before he built the bomb. Elizabeth heads home to clear her head only to discover that her husband has been bound and gagged and tortured. Zamani is in her house with a gun. He says to do what he says or he'll shoot her husband. (Incidentally, they were approved for the adoption. It's a girl.) Zamani says he was done with the chemist so they saved him payment. Zamani asks what else she knows about his plan. She says they've speculated about a bomb but that is all. Zamani stabs Tom in the thigh. He tells her Reddington has been talking about her for years. He tells her she has a choice, to stop him now and save many Americans or save only her husband, who he stabs again. She calls 911 and chooses Tom.

She sits by Tom in the hospital and then heads back to Reddington and asks if he sent Zamani to her house. Reddington asks what he said. She tells him but is more upset that Tom is dying. Reddington says Tom doesn't matter. She stabs him in the neck, hitting his carotid, if she lets go he'll die so he better give her some info on Zamani. He says if he dies she'll never learn the truth about her husband. She says he knows nothing about her husband and pulls the pen out.

She goes to his hotel room the next day to question Red again. He's gone. He winds up at the Washington monument where he meets Zamani. They trace his tracker. Red asks how it went with the husband. Zamani said he did as he asked. Zamani justifies his actions about attaching a bomb to the general's daughter and how it will be his legacy.

Reddington calls Liz and she realizes that he's going to bomb the D.C.Zoo. Liz heads to the zoo while Ressler chases down Reddington, who turns out to be Zamani, he transferred the tracker. Zamani leaps to his death.

Liz spots the little girl Beth and uncovers the bomb on her body. She has two and a half minutes to defuse it. Reddington calls her and says his ""friend"" is on the way to defuse the bomb. He does and then he runs off with it. Reddington arrives and says to consider it a souvenir for the guy who saved her life, even though it's a chemical weapon. The FBI arrives and grabs Reddington. Red says to Liz, ""we're going to make a great team.""

They debrief Red and he says he has more names to give them from what he calls ""The Blacklist""-- full of politicians, mobsters, hackers, and spies-- and that they should keep working together to work through the list. He says Zamani was a small fish on his list and he's Ahab if they want his whales they follow his rules: he never sleeps in the same place for more than two nights, they give him a better embedded tracker, he wants a security detail, he says he gets immunity and he speaks only with Liz.

The FBI investigates Liz's house. After the CSU leave she tries to scrub the blood out of the carpet and discovers a secret cubbyhole under the floorboards. It is full of money, guns, and a half dozen fake passports. She realizes it may be her that knows nothing about her husband.

Liz goes to visit Red in custody. He says she discovered something curious about her husband. She simply stares at him."

Tonight's Red list item-- which we learn is #145-- is an assassin called ""The Freelancer,"" whose MO is to stage large scale catastrophes in order to disguise a single death of a high profile person.

Red warns them that the Freelancer is about to cause some mayhem at an industrial park.

While the Feds mobilize, Red and Liz are undergoing lie detector tests and Cooper is busy trying to convince the Justice Department to agree to Red's terms for immunity and security detail.

Lady Justice isn't having it though. She says they have no reason to trust him since he's been an international menace and they're simply going to lock him up and take credit for catching him.

Then a train derails in the industrial park and kills 60 people, including an Albany politician, and suddenly they're listening again.

Liz visits Tom in the hospital in his medically-induced coma and expresses out loud her hope that Reddington planted those things in their house. When she talks with Red about it this does not appear to be the case.

Red tells them he has a contact who knows the Freelancer and can get to him, but they have to go to Montreal to make it happen. Red and Liz go to Montreal while Ressler and a team shadows them.

While they wait to meet Red's contact he asks Liz to profile him. She says he's a loner, keeps his distance, is rootless, is very comfortable in an upscale setting as well as a cave. His closest friends are strangers and he has no tight bonds. He says he is conlficted about her because he needs her and he hates that about himself because it makes him vulnerable. She asks why she's so important to him but before he can it seems as if he meets his contact and passes a note. Red ducks out the back door and pulls the fire alarm. The Feds move in and Ressler is livid that Liz let Red get away.

Apparently, he didn't though. He's in the Feds van and claims he has the name of the next target a Floriana Campos.

Campos is a world-renowned human rights activist who fund raises to combat human and sex trafficking. It would appear the Freelancer plans to off her at her upcoming gala. She says the gala must go on but agrees to let the Feds be there which includes Red and his two person security detail-- a body guard who himself was a human slave and a hot jill of all mercenary trades-- and Mira, the CIA agent foisted on him by the FBI. (He also got his high tech tracker surgically embedded.)

They head to the party where Red seems more interested in hors d'ouevres than nabbing his man. And there's a reason for that. When he finally sees his ""contact"" Ressler chases him down. He and Mira interrogate him, leaning heavily on his broken leg, and he says Red hired him.

Liz wheels around and heads back to Floriana's room where she stashed her to be safe. Red is already there. Red uncovers that Floriana is a fraud: she has been masquerading as a savior to those who have been human trafficked but in fact she has been the one doing the trafficking herself and that she is the head of nefarious cartel. When they were in Montreal, Red actually hired the Freelancer himself to kill her. But instead of creating a catastrophe, he targeted Floriana directly, poisoning her champagne at the gala. Red claims he has an antidote but won't give it to her until she confesses to Liz. She confesses but it turns out it wasn't really an antidote, he just wanted her to confess and she dies.

Later Liz and Red chat, and she seems torn up that she had long admired Floriana for her human rights activism never knowing she was a monster. Red says you can never know anyone and asks what she's going to do about Tom saying she can either turn him in or confront him. He muses there might be a third option.

She goes back home, puts the box back in the hole, carpets back over it and brings the now awake Tom home. As he sleeps she goes through his bloody clothes and finds a USB drive that is labeled ""Elizabeth Keen background profile."" She thinks it's nefarious but then puts it in the computer and discovers that it is a video of him glowingly describing her to the adoption agency and gushing about how much he loves her."

This week's list item is a baddie named Wujing, he's number 84 on the Blacklist.

In the open we watch a man leave a Shanghai bank and head to a Range Rover with a briefcase. He's descended upon, shot, the thugs take the briefcase and his hand for good measure. It turns out they need it to scan a fingerprint to get into a computer. Unfortunately, the decryption fails and Wujing says to call Red.

While Tom sleeps, Liz looks through the box in the floor. She takes the gun, a bucket, and phone books out into the backyard. She fills it with water and shoots the gun in the bucket. She pockets the bullet and casings and asks ballistics to run a check against any crimes.

Liz and Tom talk about his experience and how it's weird for him to be home. She explains she can't tell him more about Zamani. He says it's over and he hates that there are things she has to hide. Their friend Ellie comes over to care for Tom while Liz goes back to work. They have a dinner party planned with other friends later that night. As Liz leaves, she catches Tom watching her.

She finds Red in a hat store and he explains about Wujing. He says he's trying to decode messages from the CIA for a hit on an agent. He thinks they should do it because someone else will given how much he's willing to pay. Red has told him she's an MIT decryption expert and they'll get inside posing as helpers and send out the info as they decrypt it and then it will be a race to protect the agent from Wujing.

She's hesitant to do it but Ressler points out that Wujing has already killed four agents and Liz doesn't want it to be five.

A surveillance team descends on Tom and Liz's house when Ellie takes Tom for a walk. The team is led by a man whose face we don't see fully, but enjoys apples.

Red and Liz, trailed by a special ops team go to a small radio station where Wujing is holed up. Liz gets a crash course in decryption from Meera and a specialist. Meera also gives her nicotine patch that is a transmitter.

Unfortunately, when they get to Wujing's front operation they descend to his HQ and it's so far underground they lose their connection to FBI and have to improvise. With a little distraction from Red, Liz is able to attach the mirroring device to decode the message and get the info to the FBI. But Wujing's high tech headquarters uncover the treachery. Fortunately for Liz, Wujing thinks it's one of his own men. When the accused man spies the flash drive that Liz used and is about to out her, Red shoots him, reasoning Wujing was going to kill him anyway.

They hustle on out of there and catch a ride with Wujing while Ressler and Meera head to save the target, a civilian architect working for the CIA. He's at a construction site with his son. Wujing's thugs get there first but Ressler and Meera make handy work of them and save Cho and his son.

As Wujing drops them off Liz has the wherewithal to put the fake nicotine patch on the car and the FBI nabs him.

Liz and Red argue about whether he had to kill the guy and he said he had to to keep her alive. She asks him why he picked her to be his conduit. He says because of her father. She asks if they met. He says he wishes the answer was as simple as the question seems. She tells him that they're not the same, that she has people who care about her and notes that this, his list, the FBI, is all he has. He says he has her. She leaves.

Ressler and Liz debrief. He apologizes for having doubts and praises her good work. He says she should feel good no matter what else happened.

She gets her ballistics report and the test results are completely redacted.

Ressler gets the report and brings it to Cooper, unredacted. Cooper says the gun was used in a homicide involving the secretary of Homeland Security. Cooper wonders who else knows.

Liz heads home to her friends and dinner. Tom tells her he loves her and understands she needs to keep secrets for her job and that they'll survive as always. She looks around her full house. Across the street the man with the apple watches the surveillance. . Red eats alone. He opens the envelope Wujing gave him. It's a code: 042983."

Tonight's list item: ""The Stewmaker"" #161

A man with a large dog checks into a motel. He unloads large cases from his car. Once inside he takes off false teeth and a wig. He disrobes, shaves his whole body, bathes in some weird brown liquid and then, naked, covers the room in plastic.

Liz goes to investigate in the evidence room. She doesn't have her badge but the guy lets her look anyway until he realizes she's not supposed to be in there. She looks at a box labeled Angel Station, with a June 2012 date. Cooper and Ressler know she's looking into the redacted homicide. Cooper says they need to keep an eye on her. Cooper notes she's testifying against a Mexican drug dealer Hector Lorca today and wants Ressler at the courthouse with her. Liz feels like he's watching her.

Red puts in a call to see Liz. She meets him on a park bench. He reads to her about her in the paper about the trial about Hector. He says her case is about to go sideways. Lorca's people have reached out to him. Normally he wouldn't help a drug dealer but since it concerns her he's interested. Lorca wants out of the country by tomorrow night and wants Red's help setting up elsewhere. Red doesn't think she's going to have a good day in court since Lorca thinks he's going to be free the next day.

The Stewmaker, now in a gas mask-- his body covered with various burns-- begins to cook up something in the motel.

In court the prosecutor reads off members of a long list of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement agents and potential witnesses who have died or disappeared, allegedly at the hands of Lorca. There are 109 names on the list. A man on the witness stand, the father of one of the victim, says he knows who killed his son. Suddenly a man on the jury has a seizure of some kind. Liz hustles the witness out of the courtroom with two FBI agents. They are impostors and abduct the witness, having already killed the actual FBI agents. Liz and Ressler race outside but they are gone.

In Haiti, Red is seems to be selling weapons of some kind to some folks with serious cash. Liz reaches him by phone. He claims he's keeping up appearances as a ""criminal."" She asks what Lorca's contacts said. He said he told her all he know. He notes he's not worried about a mediocre drug dealer but the bigger fish. She says it matters to her and to the families of the 109 dead people. He asks if the bodies have never been found. She says no, and wonders why he's asking. He tells her to go home and have a glass of wine because the witness is likely dead and she won't find him either.

Back at the motel, the Stewmaker takes a photo of the dead witness in a body bag. He drags the body into the tub. Dons the gas mask and pours some noxious liquid on him.

At home, Liz looks through some Lorca files. And then turns to the ballistics report and looks up ""Angel Station."" Tom enters and she hides the ballistics report and scratches out her notes. He asks how she is, she says fine and he knows she's lying. He says he knows all her tells. He reassures her that what happened today was not her fault, just a function of her job. He notes the scratched out notes and the date in June 2012 and asks what it is, besides ""the best day ever."" It turns out that day they were in Boston having fun and he pulls up photos from that day. He suggests packing up the car and going on a trip because they need that right now. She says it sounds good. Her phone rings and as he departs she asks if she really has tells. And he notes she's an open book and it's one of the things he loves about her because he always knows what she's thinking.

She answers her phone and it's Ressler. She meets him and they go to the motel. Unfortunately, because of the plastic sheeting there's no trace of anything in the motel room says Meera.

Red calls from a private plane for an update. He guesses about the tape residue on the wall. He tells her to go to the tub and stick her fingers in the drain. She reports she smells chemicals. He says ""The Stewamker is in town. You're going to need a plumber.'

Red returns and gives a rundown on the Stewmaker, a true ""Blacklister."" He turns his victims into ""chemical stew,"" leaving no trace of anything, DNA, etc. behind. As he explains we watch as he pours the liquid on the dead witness and his body turns into a disgusting mush. He collects ""trophies"" of his victims, bits and pictures. Red says Liz has lost her case but the Stewmaker knows where all the bodies are buried and has the answers to hundreds of unsolved cases the world over. Ressler asks how they get him. Red says he's notoriously cautious, Red doesn't know what he looks like. He says to put pressure on Lorca.

They bring Lorca in who professes no knowledge of the Stewmaker. Meera tries to talk them into a plea agreement. Lorca is not impressed with their ability to protect people. They say they're dropping the murder charges but are bringing up money laundering charges and siccing Homeland security on him...unless he gives them the Stewmaker. He then admits he does know him, sounds scared of him, they won't catch him and he likes his odds with Homeland since he knows the charges are trumped up.

Liz turns Lorca over to Homeland security. He says Liz disrupted his life and business and she doesn't know him just because she profiled him. Just as the helicopter picking him up is about to land it is blown up and the blast tosses Liz on the pavement. A van screeches up and Lorca's henchmen jump out and gun down the BI agents, put a bag over Liz's head and toss her in.

Back at HQ, Cooper, Ressler and Red see all this on the surveillance video. Red wants to go after her. Ressler wants to come. Red says he makes no assurances for Ressler's safety and they have to do it his way without FBI teams.

Red and Ressler arrive at an address and Red says Ressler has to trust him, which he says he can't. They make their way in and Red warns him to have good answers for Lorca's questions. They head into the restaurant. Red introduces Ressler as an FBI agent and they immediately throw him to his knees and put a knife to his throat. Lorca asks why he shouldn't kill him. Ressler claims to be corrupt, Red's ""inside man."" Red says he has everything Lorca needs to flee they just need to find the Stewmaker. Lorca claims he doesn't know where he is an Red and Ressler make for the door. Lorca relents and says he has a contact.

Back at HQ we learn the Stewmaker is a dentist from Maryland and Meera and Ressler head that way. Red notices the dog hair in an evidence bag, pockets it and sneaks out with Dembe.

We cut to the Stewmaker pulling Liz out of his trunk, blindfolded and hands bound. He pushes her up a driveway to a house in the woods. She tells him her name and notes she is a person with a husband and a life, presumably to make her seem more ""real' to him, and not just a piece of stew meat.

Red, Dembe and his fancy lady friend also hit the road. He has Dembe call Maryland animal control and pretends he's the Stewmaker and says he's lost his dog and has lost the code on his cell phone to track him. He wants her to send the code to his iPad and says it's an emotional support dog and his heart is pounding.

Liz tries to appeal to the Stewmaker's humanity. She asks him his name and tells him that he's called the Stewmaker, which is disrespectful and disaparaging. He didn't know this apparently. He starts babbling about nature and the transference of energy. He says nature ""transforms"" dead people. He says he does it faster and cleaner than nature.

Ressler and Meera bust into a suburban house and confront the Stewmaker's wife and son. She says he's not home.

Liz asks the Stewmaker if he has family, a son? He does. She asks how old he is. He's 11. When she says she's not a mother he says that's good. He tells her he was asked to make her suffer and he apologizes and says it's just his job. He jabs a needle into a cluster of nerves in her shoulder, she screams.

The Stewmaker's wife tells Meera and Ressler about their cabin in the woods.

Red and his gang are getting close. They stop for meat.

The Stewmaker, now naked, gives Liz a sedative that will eventually cause paralysis but will maintain her sensitivity for pain. She asks why he's doing this since he doesn't take life he cleans up the mess of death. He says he evolved. She finally wriggles out of her plastic cuffs and knocks him down and races through the woods. The sedative is taking hold though. The Stewmaker and his dog find her in the woods. He punches her and drags her back to the house. He takes a picture of her. Then Red punches him. (He quieted the dog with the meat.) He gently puts the paralyzed Liz's feet back in the wheelchair. He says the effects of the sedative will dissipate soon and she'll be fine. He then turns and confronts the Stewmaker and asks if they should get started.

Ressler, Meera and the gang descend on the woods.

The Stewmaker's brew is bubbling while Red monologues at him, telling us his tragic backstory of the loss of his family many years earlier and how that twisted his mind and turned him into what he is and that he knows in his heart that he must pay. Liz defends him and says he couldn't help it. He tosses the Stewmaker into his own pot of stew. Ressler and Meer bust in. She asks how he got there. He compliments her blouse. Red looks through the Stewmaker's despicable photo album of bodies he destroyed. He pulls out the picture of one young blonde woman marked December 1990.

Ressler helps a weakened Liz out and she collapses, crying onto his shoulder.

Later in the ambulance, Red gives Liz the photo album so she can give the families some comfort. She notes that Red is no better than the Stewmaker. He asks if she's going to tell on him. She calls him a monster. He agrees. She asks how he can live with that. He says by saving her life. The ambulance drives off. He tells Ressler about the photo album and it should put Lorca away. Ressler says Lorca got away. Red says he's on his jet.

Later in the park he pulls out the photo of the girl and looks at it.

Liz sits on her tub and Tom comes in and surprises her with by saying he booked three nights at an inn they liked in New England. She kisses him. he says they're going to get through it and he begins kissing her neck. She opens the pamphlet for the inn and notices that it's called the Angel Station Hotel."

He suddenly grabs her and says the man he's working for is very powerful and she has to tell him everything she knows. She says she doesn't know anything and he begins choking her. And then she wakes up.

He gets up full of joy and light and says today will be a great day because it's an ultrasound for their new baby. He's very excited. He tells her to call if she can't make it. we watch the apple man do his surveillance of the house.

We then see a video of a bound and gagged man dragged from a truck by a masked man. The masked man puts a gas mask on him and then staples a newspaper to his chest. The bound man, who is being videotaped, stabs his masked assailant but he doesn't appear to feel it. The man begs for his life and is then thrown into some kind of concrete box.

At his hideaway in Maryland-- of a great unsung author he loved-- a minion informs Reddington that his sources were correct. ""The Iranian"" is seeking a high level intelligence package. Red wants it intercepted but when he learns ""The Courier"" was hired to make the exchange he thinks they should bring in the FBI.

Ressler comes in and chats with Liz about a Red debrief. She says she prepared a profile. He says he doesn't place stock in profiles. She thinks he's jealous that Red wants to work with her and not him.

She goes to see Red at his hideaway and he tells her about the Courier. He says once he's hired to make a delivery he can't be bribed or stopped and if anyone tries to doublecross anyone else the Courier kills them both. Red says he's carrying a package worth $20 million. Red says he knows the Iranian spy the package is being delivered to in 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, the Courier is busy stitching up his wound.

They set up an op at the drop point, the Farmer's Market in Alexandria. Meera and Liz are on the ground following the target. The target makes contact with the produce guy. The man is shot right through the head in front of the women. They chase after the shooter in his SUV. After a high speed chase the shooter opens up on them and then drives off again. They continue to chase him.. They plow into him. He walks away from the accident and they chase him on foot. He hides behind a corner and sticks a small memory card in his open wound. Liz and Meera corner him.

They bring the courier in for questioning and ask after the package. He's not talking. Red is not helping. They try to use pain but notice it doesn't work on him. A doctor confirms he has a rare disorder that means he cannot feel pain. They have the doctor look in the knife wound. He finds the memory card.

On it is the video of the man being attacked at the beginning, his name is Seth Nelson and he is confused. With the newspaper on his chest they realize it's a ""proof of life"" video. The Iranian that the Courier killed was bringing the ransom for Seth. There is no ""package.""

We cut to Seth in his concrete box. He appears to have oxygen tanks attached to his chest that indicates he has less than 24 hours to live.

They look into Seth who appears to work in IT for a cable company, but is really an NSA agent. They need to make the Courier talk. Liz goes to Red. Before he helps, he asks about what she learned about her husband. She tells him about the Russian tourist that was killed while they were vacationing in Boston. Red opens up about the Courier. He thinks he has a friend who can help find the Courier's safe house. He thanks her for being honest with him.

They bust into the house and investigate. Apparently, his name is Tommy Phelps. They find works, weapon, and a single personal photo. They also find the woman who was behind the kidnapping.

They investigate the woman.

Meanwhile Tommy/the Courier is being examined. He has five objects inside his body. Harold wants them out. The Courier finally speaks and says he will tell them where the kid is in exchange for immunity. They say no. Liz shows him the picture saying she wonders if he cares about his little brother. They say they're bringing him in from prison to talk to him. He talks about their childhood and their abusive father, who hated that he couldn't hurt Tommy because of his disorder. So his father had dogfights: dog vs. Tommy. He invited people from all around to watch in the barn and drink and take bets. His brother says Tommy is broken, the switch in his head flipped. He says he can't help.

Red IDs the woman. She's French and sells secrets. She owns a nightclub and once tried to kill Red. Red doesn't think the woman will help. Liz wants to try and fake her out by pretending to be the Courier. Harold thinks it's risky since she may have met the Courier. Ressler offers to give it a try.

Tom calls Liz at work agitated saying he needs to talk right away. He canceled the ultrasound. She says she can't and they can talk later. Tom has found the box in the floor.

Ressler heads to the nightclub to meet the French woman. Liz and Meera standby. Ressler beats up the doorman and gets in. He gets shown to the French womans' office. She has not met the Courier judging by her reaction. He tells her the Iranian was working with the FBI and he killed him. He says he's leaving. She thinks he's bluffing and asks him to prove he can't feel pain. He drags a broken bottle up his arm. She realizes if he was the real Courier he would have killer her. Ressler fights his way out and they bring her in.

Liz tells them to offer the Courier a reduction in his brother's sentence for the whereabouts of Seth. But he is in a transport, bound. He works his way out his cuffs thanks to various things embedded in his body.

Tom texts Liz and asks her again to come home.

Seth is running out of air.

They learn of the Courier's escape. Police are searching for him. They go to his childhood home which was in the area. Red says to let the French woman go and he will make her talk.

Red goes to meet her at her club and asks about Seth. He notes she has a target on her back. He says he has a private jet to help her flee. She doesn't want him to swoop in and profit from her mistake to protect her from someone she hardly knows. Red reiterates she's in big trouble. She says she will help.

Meera and Ressler find the Courier in an old abandoned trailer. They exchange gunfire. They catch up to him. He's been shot in the head. He collapses, dead. They calculate Seth only has 40 minutes to live.

Red comes back with the info of where Seth was picked up. They work out a radius and begin their search. They find him and he's not breathing. They apply CPR and revive him. (Red notes he died once in Marrakesh.) Seth awakes and asks who they are. Red says ""The FBI and friends."" He asks how he can repay them. Red says he'll find a way.

Ressler congratulates Liz on saving the kid's life.

She heads back to the office and gets a delivery. It's a file from Red marked ""The answers you seek."" It's the classified case file on the Angel Station Hotel incident in Boston. The man killed was named VictorFokin he was a suspected mole (KGB?) who may have plans to defect. She notes a man in a surveillance picture who looks very much like Tom.

We learn that Red was repaid by Seth with a one time only dip into classified files to get the file for Liz. His minion notes he could've used that one time access to find their ""adversary"" and wonders why he wasted it on the girl. He says it wasn't wasted and the circumstances are complicated and he is betting on the long game and the future. His minion says Red's future is arriving now. Liz enters in tears. She says she doesn't even know why she's there.

She heads home and the surveillance camera picks her up. She calls out to Tom.

We cut to the surveillance team, watching them.

We cut back to Liz and Tom. She says they need to talk. He says that's funny, he was just going to say the same thing to her and shows her the box full of passports, money, and a gun."

In Germany a bombmaker creates and detonates a car bomb that's so ingenious that the bomb is the car. A woman tells him she will need one within 36 hours.

Tom confronts Liz about the box and goes on the offense. She is confused by this. But he swears he knows nothing of it or of the murder of any Russian double agent and that all bad things that have happened to them have been because of her job not his. He volunteers to go with her to the FBI with the box and have them figure out what's going on.

Of course they separate them when they're there and Tom is interrogated and Liz is put on leave.

That leave doesn't last long when Red says he needs to work with Liz to track own a corporate terrorist Gina Zanetakos, number 152 on the Blacklist. He threatens to uncover something, at the very least unflattering about Harold Cooper, to get him to let Liz on the case. It turns out that not only is the nefarious Ms. Zanetakos planning to set off a dirty bomb somewhere but, Red claims, she is Tom's lover.

So while the team heads off to figure out Gina, Meera interrogates Tom.

He explains that he was in Boston for a job interview at a prestigious school in Cambridge and met with the headmaster at the hotel where the agent was shot, which explains why he was photographed coming out of the hotel. Meera goes to speak to the headmaster but it turns out that who Tom met was not the headmaster of the school. And when Liz notices that Gina Zanetakos is in fact also in that picture she believes Tom is being set up.

Through a series of machinations, the team tracks down Gina under an alias at a hotel. She meets with a Turkish diplomat, pretends to be hot for him, gets some vital info from him and then kills him, making it look like a suicide. She leaves moments before Liz and Ressler arrive. Ressler tracks her down in the elevator and then fight. She gets the best of him and gets away.

They manage to determine Gina's address and bust into her house where they find a box similar to Tom's filled with passports, money, and a gun. They also find a picture of the Russian man Tom is accused of killing in the box along with many other pictures of now deceased people and realize she is an assassin and she killed the Russian. But, then they find a picture of Tom in a book in her bedroom.

Liz goes to Red in tears confused, saying she doesn't know what's real or who to trust. He says she can trust him and he holds her hand.

They trace a call that alerts them to the fact that the bomb is set to go off in the Central Time Zone. Red figures he knows the bomb maker and heads off to Germany,gets him drunk, and gets Gina's whereabouts out of him.

They track Gina to a park and chase her down, and Ressler shoots her. Liz is livid since she knows where the bomb is and can clear Tom's name but now she's in surgery.

They discover the bomb is set to go off at the port in Houston and potential spread radiations for a five mile radius. They head to Houston, discover the car in a container, and realize they have no time to figure out how to defuse it so Ressler drives it off the pier and it detonates underwater, which helps contain the contamination.

When Gina wakes up in the hospital they interrogate her. She admits to killing the Russian. She was told it was to keep him from spilling secrets about the route Chechen guerillas were using to move supplies. The guy who hired her was making millions providing those supplies. That guy? Red himself. She claims she does not know who Tom is and knows nothing of the picture they found in her apartment.

When Tom is finally freed at episode's end, he and Liz have a long hug. As he looks over his shoulder at the evidence wall he notices a photo of a man. This, he says, is the man who presented himself as the headmaster. It is a picture of Red's minion.

Liz goes to Red and tells him they are done. She has no idea why he is messing with her and her husband but that they're arrangement is over.

When Liz and Tom head home the surveillance guys are watching. A younger guy is spelled by the apple eater-- who we discover is British. They don't think he's innocent. They wonder who Tom is working for, since it's clear now that he's not working for Red."

Tonight's Blacklister: Frederick Barnes, #47

We open on the subway. A mild-mannered man enters with a metallic briefcase. A woman compliments him on his hat. He eyes other people on the subway. She notes she bought a similar one for her dad and he asks the last time she saw him. She says Sunday at church. He says that's good. He gets off at the next stop and leaves his briefcase. The woman tries to catch him and give it to him but he walks off. He hits a button and a smoke emits from the briefcase. Everyone begins coughing and pounding on the window as black veins show on their faces.

Liz and Tom are remodeling, she has sample colors on the dining room walls and they are picking. She wants to switch up the room because of the attack in the box in the floor. She apologizes for doubting him and them. He says their past it and are fine.

Ressler calls her and tells her to turn on the TV to the news of the subway chemical bombing. She heads down. 37 people died. Their tech guy shows surveillance of the man leaving the station. Meera reports there was zero chatter about the guy. Red shows up and tells them the man was Frederick Barnes, a former research scientist who developed chemical weapons. He's a savant of ""government sanctioned mass killing."" Several years back he went rogue as a free agent on the open market, and he has the tools and know-how to kills thousands of people at once. He was normally the designer, not the delivery agent so they need to figure out why since this makes him the most dangerous man in the world.

They go to the morgue and the doctor says they all died of a very rare disease that usually takes a decade to kill and the chemicals made it happen in two minutes. It turns out someone was intentionally spreading the disease. Barnes has access to strontium 90 which weaponized the disease and is radioactive toxic and highly regulated and Red says only a handful of people can get their hands on it. He happens to know a three of them. Two are dead. Cooper wants a name. Red doesn't give it but says he has a meeting with the guy and has to catch a plane. Red invites Liz along for the ride to Cuba and have a therapy session on the way. She demurs in order to talk to Barnes' old research partner. Red says he's sorry she's upset with him. He says it's easier to blame him for framing Tom than realize what he really is. She says Tom is a fourth grade teacher and that's the end of the story. Red says it is very much not but they need to find a way to make up because doing this isn't as much fun when she's mad at him. They head in their separate directions.

Liz and Ressler go to see the research partner, Mrs. Forrester in Bethesda. She says he was a brilliant and extremely obsessive and dedicated researcher. They hadn't spoken in five years. Her son Ethan enters and they notice prominent veins on the boys' body like the victims. Liz asks if he the boy has the rare disease that Barnes weaponized. Liz tells her to stop holding back if she is. She says Barnes is Ethan's father. When he found out the boy had the disease he worked hard to figure out how to help him but couldn't get research funding because the disease is too rare. Liz figures that's why Barnes is killing people: the more who die of it the more likely he won't be ignored for research. They figure he's just getting started.

Red goes to see his contact in Havana. He asks for 12 kilos of strontium 90. He needs it now but his buyer begs off and Red puts a bug on his table. He says he should reach out to his most recent client and offer him 10 million to buy some back with a hefty fee for him. He and Dembe take off and wait for his contact to call Barnes. He does and the bug picks it up and they trace the call to Arlington,VA.

He calls Liz with Barnes' location. We cut to Barnes walking into a courthouse with a similar briefcase to the subway bomb. He pretends he's showing up for jury duty. He drops the briefcase and leaves. Liz and Ressler rush in as Barnes is sealing the door shut. A fire alarm goes off. Barnes hits the button and takes off with the others leaving the building. The people in the courtroom start coughing and dying. The fireman show up and Ressler grabs an oxygen tank and gas marks and tells them to vamoose. He enters the room and the people are already dead. Except one woman who he brings out, somehow unscathed.

Liz chases down Barnes. He grabs a security guard as a hostage. They stand off she drops her gun. He shoots out the courthouse windows and gets away.

Red's right hand woman Lou goes and buys a house for Red. She offers the realtor double the asking price, in cash.

The woman who survived is in the hospital with a poor prognosis.

They all head back to HQ and Meera has figured out that Barnes wants to kill a large sample of types of people either for some sort of demonstration or experiment regarding the disease.

Cooper pulls Liz aside and gives her hard time for giving up her gun during the hostage situation. That's not protocol and Cooper says she'll be under review and may be sanctioned. She says it was a judgement call. Ressler ratted her out. He says she's unqualified to be in the field and says he would've taken the shot since letting one hostage die could've saved hundreds or thousands of lives.

The survivor from the courthouse is being reassured by the doctor, who takes her blood sample down the hall as Barnes, dresses as an order enters her room. He changes her IV bag. He smiles at her as she falls asleep. He opens a kit with some scary looking instruments in it.

Red is hiding back from Cuba and Liz tells him that Barnes got away. She asks for help and he hangs up on her. She calls him back. She asks for his help again and says please. He says that she should assume that Barnes knows there is a survivor as well and has probably visited her.

Liz and Meera go to her room and discover that he took her bone marrow since she was clearly immune to the disease. We see as he takes her marrow and blood to synthesize an antidote and go ""cure"" his son.

They call his old research partner and lover to warn her but it's too late, Barnes is there. She leaves the phone connection open so Liz can hear. He confesses about the subway. She tries to kick him out but he says he's doing what he has to do. Ethan comes in and Barnes says he's hear to help him and he needs him to trust him. Ethan takes off running to his room. Barnes gives chase. Liz and Meera pull up. Barnes ethers Ethan and sedates him. Liz and Meera bust in. Before he can give the shot, Liz draws down on him. She tells him that it's just an experiment. Barnes says he'll die anyway and that this is the only chance he'll ever have and he doesn't think Liz will stop him. He's wrong. She shoots him.

Red shows up in the aftermath at the house. She confirms Barnes is dead. Red says he understands that Barnes is evil but a man willing to burn down the world to protect the person he loves most is a man he can understand. She wonders if that's meant to be directed at her. He says ""aren't you presumptuous?"" She says she doesn't need his protection. He says maybe not. She says she does need him to do this job and that she does appreciate what he does for the bureau. She says at work they're partners but that's where the relationship ends, she doesn't want him in her personal life. He says the problem with lines in the sand is how quickly they can disappear. She may not like him or understand him but he's there to answer questions she doesn't even know she has yet. He says if that doesn't matter to her he can disappear. He says he won't beg her for the privilege of helping her. He says to tell him to go. She doesn't. He says he'll see her tomorrow.

Back at HQ he commends her for the difficult call she made with Barnes. She says he was right, letting one person die is worth saving thousands.

She heads home ot find Tom eating Chinese on the dining room floor. He asks if she's having a long day. She says he has no idea. He has set up the room just like their first night in the apartment, to help her realize that the two of them is all they need. They start making out and get it on on the dining room floor.

Red goes to visit the house he bought. He enters and says he remembers it being bigger. He says he raised his family in this house. Lou says it's lovely. He says it's not, but it used to be. He goes to a closet and looks at the marks of a child growing on the wall. He envisions a little girl playing in the backyard. He is pensive. Dembe comes up from the basement and says it's time to go. Red asks if he prepared everything the way he asked. Dembe nods. They leave. Lou says the place must hold a lot of memories for him. He says he spends everyday trying to forget what happened here and this should help. They drive away and the house blows up."

A man and his son are out playing football in a park when parts of a plane come hurtling out of the sky and kill them.

It turns out it was a cargo plane blown up by an anarchic, anti-capitalism terror group known as ""Ludd"" They are sorta kinda ""Luddites"" but with bombs. Each time ""the movement"" attacks a huge corporation that corporation takes a huge financial hit. And they've been attacking since 1997. They are educated and organized.

Their leader -- who always wears a mask and has eluded capture-- is planning another attack and Keen, Ressler, the FBI and Red are on the case. (General Ludd is number 109 on the Blacklist.) Red claims to know how to find the founder Nathaniel Wolf.

But first Red barters access to the FBI VICAP system. (Violent Crimes Apprehension Program.)

They trace the bomb on the plane to a worker in a fertilizer plant and soon deduce that worker is ""Ludd""/Wolf and he has had plastic surgery to change his appearance and has a longstanding grudge against the airlines because of the death of his father and the ruin of his family.

Red and Liz head to the best plastic surgeon in the world and work him to give up Ludd's new name/identity Bradley Holland. He tries to beg off saying he never gives up his clients. Liz then says she's an FBI agent and he immediately spills. They con him by saying that she isn't an FBI agent, never showed any ID or anything and that he just spilled and now can't trust him.

The new name is the name of a pilot of a cargo airline. They realize that Wolf is now going to try and destroy a plane at Reagan airport. They rush to the airport to stop him. In the VIP lounge Wolf-- who has gotten a first class seat on a flight on standby since he is a pilot-- encounters an arrogant fat cat. He asks the stewardess to throw his bag-- which has a bomb on it-- on the plane while he attends to some business. She says she'll put it in first class.

The FBI gang arrives just as the plane explodes. Everyone on the ground is okay but not so much on the plane. Liz and Ressler take off after Wolf who is headed to New York City and wants to mount an attack on Wall St and the corrupt corporate giants.

They track him down in New York where he has pulled off a heist on an armored car, which he blows up and causes $500 million dollars to float in the air to the amazement/disgust/glee of the protesting Ludds in the streets. He melts into the frenzied crowd and gets away. It turns out it was a distraction. What Wolf really wanted was a safe in the truck that had a software upgrade for U.S. currency.They think he didn't access it, but Red knows better.

He heads to the airstrip he knows Wolf we'll be using and poses as the private plane he's arranged for ""safe passage"" out of the country. But Red confronts him about the USB drive with the software because he knows Wolf replaced the blueprint in the safe, and that Wolf will ruin the economy by having the U.S. itself flood the world with counterfeit currency. Red says he believes Wolf believes in his cause but he himself does like capitalism and so he's robbing Wolf instead of capturing him and says to have a safe flight. He then sends the plane's tail number to the FBI and Ressler and Liz nab him.

Back at HQ, Red sits down at the Vicap System and looks up the name Lucy Brooks.

Unfortunately, at the same time this is happening, Liz's father Sam is dying at a hospital in Nebraska. He tries to downplay his condition but he's only been given six weeks to live. Liz, of course, can't go to see him. But someone who can go see him, is Red. He visits him and they share memories and laughs. Red rhapsodizes about her as wild, volatile, soft, and hard and stronger than she knows. He thanks Sam for taking Liz in as his how and giving her a great life. Sam says Liz should know the secret. Red says they need to keep the secret. He then suffocates Sam to death with his pillow.

Tom has shown up to be with Sam but arrived too late. Red, a stranger to him, sits down with him at the hospital outdoor café and they trade stories about the people they've ""lost."" Tom says he doesn't know what he's going to say to his wife since she will be devastated since her dad adopted her at 4 and raised her as a single parent. Red says he's sure she'll be fine and that he'll always be there with her in the shadows, keeping her safe, and watching over her. He gets kind of creepy about it and says ""she will be fine."" Tom says he hopes he's right. Red says he knows he is and leaves. It's weird.

Liz learns of her father's death by phone. She is devastated. She and Tom attend the funeral.

Later Liz confronts Red about nabbing the USB drive, which she knows he will use for a counterfeit operation. He doesn't answer her and instead gives his condolences for her father. He says the best way to keep him alive is to talk about him and asks her to tell him some stories. They sit on a nearby swingset and do just that."

We open on a bloodied Ressler biting down on a tie as Red tries to do something surgical to his leg.

We then skip back in time to 13 hours earlier in Munich.

This is where Red met with some nefarious peeps to ""make a deal"" but when Ressler shows up to say Liz has been ""detained"" they wing their way back to D.C.

We cut to Liz in her kitchen with Tom, crying over the program from her dad's funeral. She is bereft about her dad and also her own sketchy past before her adoption. We watch her go through a box of old pictures and mementoes including a stuffed white bear, that is burned on one side, we see her remembering a house fire as a child.

Turns out that the ""Liz has been detained"" thing was a lie. They are bringing him into protective custody because there's been a threat on his life between someone named Wells and the Egyptians. Red says there's always been a price on his head. They mention the name Anslo Garrick and Red gets serious and says if that name came up this was a set up and Garrick plans to attack this facility and they have a mole and from here on out he doesn't trust anybody. Red says they are playing into Garrick's hands. We cut to a garbage truck driver who gains entry to the area. An unseen man with a mask is holding a gun on the driver.

As Red explains how Garrick gains access to high level facilities-- working with a group of bloodless, countryless killers called the Wild Bunch-- we watch as they infiltrate the post office killing people along the way. Red announces the building is about to be breached and a few moments later it is as all power and communication is cut off, which just happens to trap Liz in an elevator. So now she actually is detained.

Anslo Garrick is #16 on the list.

Red says to abandon the building and to get him out of the cuffs but Ressler isn't hearing it. He wants to put Red in ""the box"" until the threat is over. Red says the threat won't be over until they get him. He tells Ressler to just let him be taken since he'll probably be tortured and killed anyway. Cooper, Meera and the others go to get more weapons.

A man happens upon Red and Ressler and Ressler is shot in the leg, badly injured. Red grabs the gunman's firearms and drags Ressler to safety.

Meanwhile Liz is climbing out of the elevator. Barefoot and scraping herself up along the way.

Red and Ressler seek refuge in ""the box"" which is impenetrable. Garrick arrives and says hello through the glass. Red gets to work on Ressler as Garrick taunts him through the box's comm. He says there's nowhere he can go where Garrick can't reach him. He natters on about how he heard Red had been working with the Feds but how they can't keep him safe from someone like him who sat in darkness for five years thinking about breaking Red's will, body, and finally his mind and now that day is here and it will end with Red's screams as God is his witness. Meanwhile, while Garrick is monologuing Red is tending to Ressler's wound.

Elsewhere, Cooper is trying to get some kind of comms and cameras working. He tells Aram the tech to make it happen and kill anything that isn't FBI as he and Meera and others gear up.

Liz tapes up her hand and grabs a radio and contacts Cooper who gives her an update.

Red continues to tend to Ressler. He wraps his tie on Ressler's leg and tells him to bite down on his own tie as he works on it since it will be hugely unpleasant. It certainly seems that way. Red tells him to keep pressure on the wound. Garrick leans on the glass and says he doesn't like Ressler's chances and all he has to do to save him is come out. He taunts Ressler and reveals that he, Garrick, gave away Red's location five years earlier to Ressler himself when the FBI was after Red.

Red wonders why Garrick hasn't done anything about his scarred face given the advances in plastic surgery. Garrick laughs. Red points out that the only Garrick only lives with that scar is because Red was testing out different ammo that week and if he had been using what he normally did Garrick would be dead. Garrick says they made a good team. Red says they were never a team and he betrayed his trust and Red beat him. Garrick shoots at the glass and it ricochets and kills one of his own men. Red says the box is impenetrable. Garrick decides to attach some explosives to it and test that theory.

Cooper and Meera are pinned down in the armory returning fire. And Liz is trying to steady herself. Aram is working on trying to bring comms up. Cooper and Meera are overrun by the mercenaries.

We hear Liz calling for help. But it turns out that it was a trap with her cell phone. She draws a mercenary to her and kills him. She takes his weapons.

Aram works feverishly and gets the internal cameras up and working and sees that Meera and Cooper have been taken prisoner, their hands bound behind them.

One of Garrick's men says they don't have enough explosives to blow up the box. Garrick sends his men to the armory to get more.

Red works on Ressler and asks what blood type he is and he says B negative. Red laughs noting they do have something in common. He prepares to do a transfusion. Ressler wonders why he's trying to save him since it's clear Ressler hates him and now Red knows he tried to kill him in Brussels. Red says he knew about Brussels and that he's saving him because that's what you do when someone is dying in front of you. He once saved a man one day and killed him the next month. The world is a complex place and you can be enemies today and allies tomorrow. He does the transfusion. Garrick talks to them through the glass about the road runner and the coyote. Garrick says he will get him with the explosives and then torture the hell out of whatever's left. Red is quiet. Garrick wants him to play with him. Red won't. So he turns his taunts to Ressler about his leg is a lost cause and how the sepsis will poison his blood and kill him.

Aram ponders his next move as he watches the mercenaries enter the amory. He checks his own weapon and heads down.

The mercenaries grab more C-4. They hear a noise. Liz gets one to shoot the other and has him radio Garrick that they're on their way back. She then punches him out cold.

Aram arrives and fills Liz in on Cooper and Meera being captured and shows her Red and Ressler in the box. He explains how he could get comms working by disabling the jammers. She says they're going to get it done. He says he thought they were waiting for the cavalry. She notes they are the cavalry. He says he's only ever shot at paper targets. She tells him to pretend the guys are paper.

Red tries to talk to Ressler and asks if he's feeling any wittier or craving Beluga caviar now that he has Red's blood in him. Ressler notes Red may not like him but you don't get assigned to a case like him if you don't pass muster. Red asks what happened to Audrey Bidwell. Ressler is given pause. He says ""she left me."" They were engaged but he says he was engaged for five years to catching Red and that made her leave.

A man comes and rescues the dude Liz put down so now Garrick knows that there's a ""monkey wrench"" running around the building and to find them.

Ressler wonders how Red abandoned his flag and country. Red says we become what we are and you can't judge a person by it's cover but maybe the first few chapter. Ressler asks if the Blacklist is just about revenge. Red says it's more than that. Ressler says he doesn't think they'll survive. Red says he does and it's mainly so he can sail across an ocean one more time and do other fancy stuff like eating in Paris and smoke Cuban cigars. He gets into a reverie about it talking about sleeping with hot chicks, walking walls, finding rivers, and sit in the garden and read a book and sleep like he did when he was a boy. Ressler appears moved, almost as if he's crying. Red says that's why he won't let Garrick get the best of him.

Garrick summons Cooper to the box. Cooper asks what he wants. Garrick says it's not about what he wants but what he needs and that's access to that box. Cooper says he needs all his people released right now. Garrick laughs and says he's not in charge. He says no but he's the one who can get him into the box. Garrick pulls his gun and says he bets someone else can.

Keen and Aram find one of the boxes they need and the comm system begins to reboot.

Red calls Garrick an idiot for pointing his gun at Cooper and notes that the longer he waits the closer the cavalry is. Then Ressler starts moaning and writhing. Garrick says he wonders how long Red is going to hold out and if he's just going to let Ressler die. Red goes to work on Ressler's leg again, this time planning to cauterize the wound, which includes cutting into his leg and basically setting it on fire. He says he has to do it or tell them how to open the door or he will die. He tells him to do it. He starts and Ressler screams, this is where we came in.

Liz and Aram continue to disable the jammers. They split up to work faster even though Aram is frightened.

Ressler finally passes out from the pain. Red cauterizes the wound to stop the bleeding.

Garrick finds Red's female friend Luli and puts her on her knees in front of the box, Red freaks out and tells Cooper to open the box. He won't. Red tries to reason with Garrick. Garrick shoots her right in front of him, splattering her blood on the box. Red walks away from the sight.

The guy that Liz disabled finds her and returns the favor and knocks her out.

Garrick now grabs Dembe and threatens to do the same thing to him. Red pleads with Cooper to open the box for Garrick. He then realizes Ressler knows the code and tries to rouse him. Dembe basically tells him not worry about it, that their friendship was forged in fire and will last forever and he bids Red adieu. Garrick likes this. Red tells Cooper he will give him anything if he opens the box. Dembe begins speaking in a foreign language and Red starts speaking it with him. Red slides down and looks Dembe in the eyes. There is a gun shot and a cut to black."

We pick up a little before we left off with Garrick holding a gun to Dembe's head as Red looks on in horror from inside the box. Red and Dembe speak to each other in a foreign tongue.

Aram continues to disable the jammers and gets a line to the outside. He goes to Liz to tell her but she's in the clutches of an Anslo mercenary.

There is a gunshot. But it's not Dembe. Aram has killed the mercenary. Anslo hears the shot and brings Liz to the box and puts her on her knees in front of it. Red rouses Ressler and asks for the code. Ressler sees Liz with Anslo's gun to her head. Cooper says not to give the code. Liz's phone rings, Anslo answers. It's Tom. Anslo says he's going to put a bullet in Liz's head. She yells for him to call the FBI.

Red puts a gun to Ressler's head for the code. He tells him ""Romeo."" Red tells Anslo who makes Cooper put it in. The box opens. Red comes out and says ""Anslo, what are you doing here?""

Red tells Anslo to let the Feds go. He pulls Red and Liz away and they leave.

The cavalry arrives and there is a shootout in the hall.

A mercenary tells the Feds to get down on their knees and Cooper remains standing and calls him a coward. He aims his gun at Cooper and Ressler shoots him from behind. Cooper springs into action.

As this is happening. Anslo and a few men push Liz and Red through a hole and make their escape through a tunnel. They take off in an ambulance. Dembe, now armed, chases after them on foot.

In the ambulance they work on Red's neck to get the chip out. Liz shocks one of the fake EMTs with a defibrillator and a fight ensues. Red tells Liz to call someone named Kaplan at the Emissary hotel. They toss Liz out and, although she is cuffed, she commandeers a car and has the driver follow the EMT. She calls in and says they're trying to take out Red's chip. They manage to get it out and Garrick hands it off to man on a motorcycle to lose Liz. She finds the chip in the middle of he street. Red is gone.

Anslo takes Red somewhere, puts a bag over his head and strings him up in shackles.

Cooper reports to his superior about what went wrong. She says the task force is decommissioned and was a bad idea to begin with since Red was a fugitive. She says they have to find him, the superior is having none of it. Liz goes to Aram and asks for his help. He says he's out but she convinces him to make a copy of the security feed from the building before Red entered. She calls the Emissary Hotel and is told Mr. Kaplan is unavailable.

Back in torture central, Anslo wants to know who Liz is since Red placed her life before his. He wants to know why she's so special. They argue about their history. Red says Anslo was greedy and went behind his back to make deals he didn't approve of. He asks what he expected. Anslo says more than a bullet in a face.

Liz goes home and Tom is freaked out. He says she needs to walk away from the job before it destroys her. He says they can go anywhere. She says she has to take the call. Mr. Kaplan is available and Aram is calling. Aram says he couldn't find anything on the tapes and he thinks he has a lead on the mole in the post office. He has an address on where calls were coming from right before Red entered the building. It's across the street from Liz's house. (Where the people are surveilling her but she doesn't know it.

Back in torture central, Anslo promises more evil to come but he says he was just the hired help to get him to the venue. He'd love to kill him but he answers to someone else. Some men arrive and give him an injection that will amplify his sensitivity to pain. He says Red will be begging him to kill him.

Liz breaks in across the street, gun drawn. She searches he house and finds the surveillance of her home. A man walks up behind her gun drawn. She disarms and shoots him. She calls Mr. Kaplan.

A small, elderly woman arrives at the house. She says she'll handle the body. Liz says she can't do that since she's a federal agent. ""Mr. Kaplan"" says she has two directives; to protect Liz and find her ""employer""--presumably Red-- and she says she intends to do both. She hands Liz the dead guy's keys and tells her to find his car.

Red is prepped for his torture. He seems to be resisting the pain amplifying medication. He's shaking but taking it, even over the limit. The doctor is worried if they keep giving him more he'll die. Anslo says to stick him again.

Liz finds and searches the car while Kaplan pulls out the bullets. Liz takes pictures of the GPS and license plates. Kaplan runs face recognition software and there are no matches. They go to one of the addresses in an industrial area. They take off as Tom looks out the window.

They arrive at the area and find Dembe as well as armed guards that he's assembled. The guards make a run on the warehouse. They make their way to an upper floor where the men they are shooting destroy a set of servers. Meanwhile, Red is not there, he's busy being prepped by Anslo. A man enters and Anslo tells him ""He's ready for you sir."" The grey-haired man walks up and says hello and notes it's been 20 years since they've seen each other.

Liz calls Cooper and Aram to the warehouse. He yells at her for riding shotgun on an unsanctioned massacre. But then Aram calls their attention to something they need to see.

Cooper goes back to his boss and says he thinks she'll reconsider. He shows her how this group that was targeting Red was actually watching the task force for months with next generation technology that they don't even have. She wonders how this is possible. He then shows her that they've ben watching her as well. She is unnerved.

The grey-haired man has Red brought down and put into a chair. He tells Red that none of this had to happen and that they had an arrangement. Red says they do. Grey-haired man says the people he works for are nervous and don't know what to think. He notes they could've killed him at any time in the last 20 years but they don't because they know what he has and know what will happen to it if he turns up dead so they let him live in exchange for the secrecy of their secret. Red says nothing has changed. Grey-haired man said it changed the day he turned himself into the FBI. He wonders if Red planned to expose them, he says he didn't. He asks Red what he's told them. Red says nothing. Grey-haired man wonders what he's doing there then. Red says his reasons having nothing to do with him and the secret he holds for grey-haired man's bosses. GHM (who is played by Alan Alda by the way) says he hopes not since he likes Ray even though he's a pain in the neck. GHM adds they could've taken him at any time and instead they dragged him from the bed he shares with his new friends and rhetorically asks why they'd do that. To make it clear that there's nowhere he can go or anyone he can trust to keep him safe from them. A bloodies and shaky Red simply looks at him.

Liz and Meera debrief about the attack and muse about who the mole might be. They note that Ressler is still in surgery. They look over files and think they've found where he's being kept, at a decommissioned black site. They figure if whoever took him knew about the post office they would know about other black sites.

GHM is leaving and Anslo asks him if he can kill him now. GHM is worried that whatever failsafe Red has in place will be triggered by his death. Anslo says that's not his problem. He says he lost a bunch of men today and he's had his talk with Red and now it's Anslo's turn. Anslo approaches and Red calls his bluff saying he knows that Fitch won't let him kill him (GHM henceforth known as Fitch.) Anslo says he can find Lizzy and torture and kill her. He says he'll just have to take what he can. Something Red taught him. Red manages to get the upper hand on Anslo and kills him and escapes. The cavalry arrives and finds only Anslo's body. Liz knows Red was there.

Later she chats with Tom in the car. He is freaking out about all that has happened: attacks, cameras in their house. He says they need to leave.

Audrey, Ressler's ex, goes to visit Ressler in the hospital. The FBI called her as his emergency contact. He apologizes for not taking her off that list. She holds his hand. He notices she's engaged. He asks if the guy is fat and unemployed. She sweetly says he is.

They confirm Red was in the warehouse and Cooper is told by his boss to track him down. They need him to find the mole. She says whoever is after Red is after them so now he has renewed value, so he is now the only target on the Blacklist.

Mrs. Kaplan calls Liz and says ""it's done."" Liz is standing in her living room surrounded by packing boxes.

Cooper debriefs the troops about how Red is now atop the most wanted list.

Audrey feeds Ressler jello and they laugh.

Liz grabs her favorite burned bunny rabbit. She notices blood on her hand. Her phone rings. It's Red. He says he's just gone for a short while. She says Dembe is looking for him and it's urgent. He says Dembe will have to wait. Red says he wants her to know that wherever he is, he will always be there if she needs him. She tells him the task force is searching for him. He says he has to go. She asks if Red is her father. He says no. He tells her to be careful of her husband. He hangs up. We see him put up a hoodie over a kit cap and walk into what look like New York City traffic."

A man introduces himself to her as uncle of one of the kids. He tries to make small talk, and offers her punch, which she accepts. She has to leave to pick up her other kid. She gets in her car, then gets out and passes out.

When she wakes up, the man is looming over her. He tells her she was drugged and she's not going to be OK. He has her strapped to an operating table with all sorts of surgical tools hanging from the wall. He examines a chart then cheerfully tells her that first he's going to collapse her lung, then break her clavicle. He gets started.

Later, he calls 911 and reports ""I've done it again."" He walks away, leaving Karen bleeding in her minivan by the phone.

At home, Tom is freaked out by all the surveillance put in place until the Post Office determines who the leak is. He tells Liz he has a job interview this afternoon -- in Lincoln, Nebraska. She knows they need to talk, but she gets called in to work.

The Good Samaritan is 106 on the Blacklist.

She makes a case to Cooper to work the Good Samaritan case, even though he wants Moblie Psych to handle it. But it's her old case and therefore personal, which she thinks means Red might reach out.

Liz is called for her interview. The whole team is questioned. Watching the interviews, Diane Fowler thinks it's a mistake to put Keen back on the street.

Later, Liz explains to Ressler that the Good Samaritan got his name because he never kills his victims, he always calls 911 and gives the paramedics a chance to save them. That's how he got his name. They never had any luck figuring out how he chooses his victims.

Liz and Ressler arrive at the hospital to meet with Karen's husband. Ressler keeps her son Michael company. Michael asks if his dad is in trouble -- he's a bookie. He asks about Ressler's leg and volunteers he broke his collarbone once. He doesn't ask about his mom.

Karen's husband IDs her body in the morgue.

Meanwhile, Red ensures Luli's ashes are transferred properly as he remembers watching her be killed in the attack on the Post Office. He tracks down a man and demands information about the man with the apple.

Red takes the man to his car to interrogate him. The man insists he never met his boss and they all had individual jobs.

Red goes to the next person, the EMT who pulled the chip from his neck. She says she was told she'd only have four minutes to remove it and was paid cash. She was picked up in an ambulance and didn't know where she was going.

Next, Red goes to the doctor who was hired to supply the injections and monitor his vital signs. They were paid in $5s and $10s.

Red finishes questioning them. Then we see each of their dead bodies.

Liz gets home to see a reassuring note from Tom. Red calls. He read about the Good Samaritan and wants to help. Liz tells him one of the Samaritan's first victims died in her arms and she's stumped by a lack of pattern.

Red suggests it's about the torture, and maybe it's tailored to each of his victims, suggesting the attacks are about the victims, not the Samaritan. He hangs up before she can ask more.

After going back to the office and reviewing the files, Liz calls in Ressler and Meera. She tells them that Karen's son Michael had a long history of injuries -- he was abused. And the killer gave every one of those injuries to Karen.

Cooper calls Meera aside and tells her she's been cleared. He asks her to look into bank accounts and she tells him Red called Liz.

Red goes into a club and shoots two goons to talk to Theodore, whom he shoots in the leg. He knows Theodore funnels money through his clubs and pays in $10s because he's too cheap to get clean cash. He wants to know about his banker. When Teddy won't talk, he douses him in vodka and lights a cigar.

Teddy tells him the money was wired to London office of the Gstaad bank. Having gotten the information he needs, Red pours more vodka and sticks the lit cigar in Teddy's mouth. Red waits. ""Oh my god, the suspense is killing me,"" Red says, then he picks up a gun and shoots him.

Ressler and Liz talk to Michael with his dad there. He tells them his mom hurt him.

They decide to look into relatives of past victims, thinking he's a vigilante killer targeting abusers.

At home with his wheelchair-bound mother, the Good Samaritan brushes her hair and leaves her facing the TV.

He heads to work as an ER nurse. He treats a woman named Melissa with a long history of injuries. He notices her husband lurking nearby and that she's scared of him.

Red drops in on Henry. ""There's been a nasty bit of business. Blood spilled, lives lost, a modicum of torture. Words don't fully describe. I know who's responsible, I know who carried it out. To finish the job, I'll need all of your wire and transfer records,"" Red says.

He doesn't entertain Henry's denials for a moment, and tells Henry that he'll be back tomorrow.

At the office, Meera reports that one of the accounts was used to wire funds from Gstaad to Manhattan. It's under an alias, but they have the passport of the account holder -- it's Aram Mojtabai.

Meera leads a team of agents to Aram's house, but he's not there.

Instead, Aram is taken somewhere with a bag over his head and when it's removed he finds he's face to face with Red. Red tells him to transfer $5 million from an account into Red's own and gives him two minutes, the time it takes Red to disassemble and reassemble a Colt .45, after which point he'll shoot Aram.

Aram types as Red finishes putting his gun back together. Aram finishes just in time then explains how he converted the money into Bitcoin and is sure the transaction is untraceable.

Red hands Aram a bullet as a souvenir and announces he's innocent. He tells Aram about the transfer and the account set up in Aram's name -- he's being framed as a mole. ""You're obviously far too clever to have accepted payment that was so easily traceable,"" Red says.

Aram realizes Red isn't going to kill him. ""No, I'm going to find somebody else, and kill them,"" Red says.

The Good Samaritan sits in a meeting for abusers and shares about his mother abusing him. Melissa's abuser is in the meeting. The Samaritan says he reconciled with his mother with a ""home remedy"" that allows them to be closer.

After the meeting, he introduces himself to Melissa's husband, George.

Henry comes home and sees Red's black hat on the hook. Red has introduced himself to Henry's wife as an old college pal and he's staying for dinner. He hugs Henry hello and whispers: ""I know what you've done.""

Henry goes to wash up and calls someone to tell them Red is in his house.

Back at the table, Janice serves dinner, but Red knows the police are coming. Red has accounted for everyone but one person involved and he asks Henry -- then calls him out for giving him the wire transfer leading to Aram, a patsy. He shoots Henry in the knee to make him talk. Janice freaks out. ""Janice, if you don't stop yelling, I'm going to put you in the closet,"" Red says, and then he does.

Henry talks: Newton Phillips.

Red apologizes for missing dinner and leaves.

Back home, the Samaritan gets his mother and announces they have another guest. He wheels her into his shed, where George is strapped to his table.

Back at the office, Liz has connected family members of victims as abuse victims. They find nurse Karl Hoffman treated all of them at different hospitals.

Liz and Ressler head to the hospital, where they learn Melissa was the only person Karl saw that day with a broken bone.

Back at home, Karl tells George that he realized his mother enjoyed hurting him. He believes the only way the abuser can know what his abuser goes through is to experience it himself. He forces his mother to watch.

Liz and Ressler interview Melissa, who defends George, and says he went to a group meeting just today. At the meeting, someone tells them about seeing George with a man -- he IDs Karl. He mentions that Karl talked about his mother abusing him.

They realize he's taking back control in the place where he was abused -- his childhood home.

Back in his shed, Karl has detached George's retina and is moving on to replicate the concussion he gave Melissa.

He's about to whack George with a hammer when Liz comes in. When he won't drop it and starts to swing, she shoots him.

At the hospital, Liz warns George that if he hurts his wife again, she'll do what she probably should have let Karl do.

At the office, a nervous Aram is brought in with a file from Red. He gives it to Cooper.

""Who the hell is Newton Phillips?"" Cooper says.

Red dumps out Luli's ashes while a man waits for him. Red calls to him, ""Newton.""

""If you had come to me I could have helped you. We could have avoided all of this,"" Red says.

Newton says they threatened his family. Red promises to take care of his family. Newton asks that Red make it look like an accident for his wife's sake. Red tells Newton to look out at the water, then he suffocates him with a plastic bag.

Diane Fowler meets with her superiors, including Fitch, and tells him they have identified the mole, but she still won't tell them who it is because it would compromise their asset.

Red drops in on Liz at home. ""Does this mean you're back?""

He tells her his house is clean, but he doesn't think hers is -- the incursion couldn't have taken place without help from someone on the inside. They're back where they started.

And he brought her the next name on the Blacklist."

They call him The Alchemist.

Cut to a man kissing a tipsy woman. She gets woozier and he lays her down on the bed. Red explains the Alchemist relies on science to transform one person into another.

The blond woman who was in bed with the man wakes up midair on a private plane with brown hair cut differently, different clothes and seated across from a man covered in tattoos. Except the man doesnt know what hes doing there either. His teeth hurt and he says he doesnt have tattoos. As they scramble to figure out whats going on, the Alchemist comes out of the cockpit wearing a parachute.

He opens the plane door and jumps out. The plane starts to nosedive, with the two pilots dead in the front seat. It races into the ground below.

The Alchemist, 101 on the Blacklist

Later, the news identifies the couple as Pytor and Catherine Madrczyk, mob informants who look a lot like the man and woman who just crashed.

Back at the post office, Cooper doesnt understand why Red would warn them the Madrczyks were going to disappear if they just crashed in a plane. Liz explains that Red doesnt think the real mole has been found, so he wont come in.

Red checks in on his team of nerds working to figure out who the mole is. They have trash bags of shredded second tier intelligence from inside the company, Red tells them to put it together.

Red sits in Synagogue with an obituary for Lucy Brooks, 28. He puts it away when Liz arrives. She tells Red he was wrong about the Alchemist protecting the Madrzycks, DNA and dental impressions confirm they were in the plane. But Red explains the Alchemist is so skilled with forensics he can change DNA. Madrzycks tried to hire Red first, so he knows where they are.

Budapest, Hungary

Waiting for Madrzycks to arrive at a restaurant, Ressler tells Liz about his ex Audrey visiting him in the hospital, and how he doesnt feel like pretending hes happy shes getting married.

Pytor walks in. They follow him and grab him when he tries to run.

Back home, Tom is back from Nebraska, where he didnt go to his job interview. He tells Liz he didnt want to make her choose between him and her work. But Jenny is due in six weeks and hes expecting theyll take her baby. Liz promises to be safer at work. He also wants her to have fewer secrets. She says shell do anything to make things easier, which hes happy to hear because Ms. Sutton is organizing a baby shower for all the teachers and theyre hosting.

Back at the office, they go back over the autopsy results from the plane crash. The teeth and DNA were altered.

Back at the synagogue, Red throws out some possible explanations for how the Alchemist achieves his results, something vaguely sciencey about red and white blood cells and synthetic DNA. Red tells her if they can catch the Alchemist they have a chance to catch some of the most dangerous people who ever lived, his clients.

At the office, Liz goes over a series of murders and crimes, in each case the suspect was found dead but Red says theyre not.

Aram identifies the female plane victim as Sarah Jenkins. They took DNA from the bone marrow to ID her. Her last internet visit was a dating website three days ago.

At a lab somewhere, the Alchemist talks to a very upset Mrs. Madrzyck, asking who she told about their disappearance. She insists no one knew. He asks the name of their attorney, then he shoots her.

Ressler talks to Pytor, who tells him everything with the Alchemist was done through couriers. He got their medical and dental records. Pytors attorney arrives, introducing himself as a fill in. Its the Alchemist.

Left alone with the Alchemist, Pytor wants to know where his regular attorney is. Hes agitated and wants a cigarette, and takes a piece of nicotine gum from the Alchemist. Pytor starts choking.

Out in the hall, Liz shows Ressler the picture of Sarah Jenkins date from the site the Alchemist. Ressler races back in the room, but Pytor is already dead on the floor and the Alchemist is gone.

Back at the office, they traced the Alchemist through surveillance camera to a rental car agency and got a name, Eric Trettel, to find his background. He flunked out of med school and faked a degree from Harvard to join the Human Genome Project. He testified as an expert witness, but was exposed for faking evidence. He has a wife and daughter.

Liz pays them a visit. Their eight year old daughter Annie was recently diagnosed as diabetic. His wife explains that Eric is dangerous and thinks theyre still together even though he hasnt lived there in six years. He comes by some times and says he wants to help. She mentions a lab.

Ressler and Meera are called to the scene of a car fire, where Catherine Madrzycks body has been found inside. Theres a scrap of paper with numbers on it.

At Reds nerd HQ, theyre using German software to piece together the shredded documents. Red welcomes Liz, who brings him the numbers. They were traced to stock business paper, which is used by a Swiss bank.

Red is more interested in the Alchemist as a person. Liz calls him a lab rat and gets an idea. Back at the office, she and Ressler start looking up the serial numbers of equipment used to sequence DNA.

Eric goes through a stack of head shots and homes in on a blond named Mandy. He calls her, posing as a casting director and asks her to come to an audition tonight. When she gets there, hes the only one there and pretends to be a fellow actor. Theres a sign moving the audition, so he offers to share a cab.

A different woman (who could be the woman in Reds obit) preps for her role as Jolene. She has a picture of Tom in a folder.

At the Keens house, they play baby games at the shower. A teacher asks Liz how much time shes taking off and Tom explains Liz isnt taking maternity leave. The teacher gets judgy and Tom and Liz go to their bedroom to argue when Jolene comes out the bathroom. Tom recognizes her as a substitute at his school.

Liz gets called in to work.

The Alchemist gets to work on a brunette.

At the party, Jolene tries to give Tom marital advice. She tells him he should check out a photography exhibit of a woman who seduces married men and then takes their photos. He calls that crazy then she says its her show. As Tom is busy backtracking, she says she kidding.

At the office, theyve IDd the number as belonging to a centrifuge belonging to a company that does DNA research.

Ressler, Liz and Meera head to the lab and find evidence of the Erics work on various people, including two extras. They realize hes killing anyone who could lead them to him. They race to his familys house, but theyre too late, his wife and daughter are dead.

Liz calls Tom to apologize. He suggests the photography exhibit, but she suggests dinner at home instead.

In the office, Aram is going through Erics victim files. She sees Mandy and a young girl and realizes theyre the stand ins for Erics wife and daughter, who are still alive.

At Reds nerd HQ, they find a memo to Meera. Liz calls for help finding Eric and his family. Red suggests following the mother and childs needs, not Erics.

They start tracking Annies insulin pump and get a signal.

Eric stops with his wife and child at a convenience store. When he offers Annie a candy bar, his wife is aghast and mentions shes diabetic. He finds the insulin pump and says they need to leave. Everyone in the store sees the Amber alert broadcast for Annie. Eric sees the clerk on the phone and draws a gun. Another customer draws his gun and they exchange shots.

Annie is hit in the crossfire.

The cops and FBI surround the store. Liz goes to talk to Eric. He offers hundreds of names of people they think are dead in exchange for a medic for his daughter. His wife gets frantic, thinking hes taking too long to negotiate as his daughter bleeds.

As Liz is talking to him, Erics wife picks up the other customers gun and shoots her husband in the back. The SWAT team runs in, but Eric is dead.

Later that night, Liz calls Tom, hoping he hasnt cooked. Hes sitting in front of an elaborate meal with candles and wine, but tells her he didnt make anything because he figured shed be late.

He pretends to be OK with her offer to pick up Chinese.

Ressler tells Liz hes decided to tell Audrey what he really thinks of her fiancé. Aram interrupts to announce he found Erics database of people he helped disappear.

Liz goes back to the synagogue to give Red the list. He says he has unfinished business and she realizes Red used them to get the Alchemists list, but he wont say why.

Ressler meets with Audrey for dinner. He starts to tell her she made the right choice with her fiancé, when she tells him that they put the engagement on hold. She tells Ressler she hasnt been able to stop thinking about him since she saw him at the hospital. They leave the restaurant together.

Tom calls Jolene to see about going to the art show.

Liz gets home to an empty house and cleared dishes and know shes in the doghouse.

Tom shares drinks and flirts with Jolene at the show. He ignores Lizs call.

Meera returns home to find Red waiting for her. I trust you know why Im here, he says, holding a gun on her. Yes, youre here to kill me because Im the mole, she says."

The Cyprus Agency, No. 64

At home, Liz and Tom look at a 3-D ultrasound of Julia's baby. She tells Tom she wants to stay home for a little while when the baby comes.

Later, Liz meets with Red in the church. He tells her the next name on the Blacklist: The Cyprus Adoption Agency. She doesn't think it's a coincidence he's choosing this target when she's about to adopt, but he assures her life is full of little ironies.

At the Agency, a couple is allowed to select all the genetic and hereditary traits of their child. Mr. Mallory, the CEO, introduce Ted Caldwell, their lawyer.

Red tells Liz the Agency doesn't adopt babies, they steal them. They use a forger, one of Red's best.

Liz meets with the soon-to-be parents of the most recently ""adopted"" boy, David and Wendy Rolland. Liz breaks the news that the baby they're expecting to bring home in the next two weeks won't be theirs. They offer to help.

Later, the Rollands meet with Ted Caldwell, as Liz and Ressler stake out the coffee shop. David Dolland nervously asks for more information about the child. Caldwell tells them to talk to an adoption consultant with the agency. Caldwell steps outside to make a call, saying he thinks something is wrong.

Liz and Ressler interrupt and identify themselves. Caldwell immediately gets spooked. When Liz mentions real parents, Caldwell says she has no idea. Caldwell backs into traffic, scared, and is quickly flattened by a bus.

Red checks in with Ted Grimley, who's been with Meera, trying to get answers. Grimley reports that Meera is telling the truth.

She tells him she was ordered by someone to open bidding for building improvements, leaking confidential building design info (the burned scrap of paper Red's nerds found), but she doesn't know by whom. She suggests he let her go so she can find out who gave the order, because they both want the same thing.

At the agency, Mallory assures Liz and Ressler that they've done nothing wrong and suggests if there was an issue it was by their overseas partners. He volunteers any help he can offer.

Back at the office, Liz reports Cyprus had 27 infant adoptions last year, which is a lot. But she can't find any records of the birth parents. They start DNA tests on the children and begin searching international missing children files.

Liz wants to talk to Cooper about maternity leave, but is interrupted when Meera shows up late. She says she was up all night with her daughter, which prompts Cooper to remind her the job is more important. Liz doesn't ask him for time off.

Liz, Ressler and Meera go get DNA swabs from the kids, many of whom are toddlers.

Liz meets with Red and tells him this is her last case for awhile. None of the DNA matched to missing children. ""You're so linear,"" Red says.

He asks her to think who wouldn't report a child missing -- criminals. He suggests she run the DNA again and match it against relatives of criminal. Red tells Liz she's reaching a ""point of no return"" with Tom if she goes through with the adoption and she should stop if she has any doubts. She doesn't.

Back at the office, they get five DNA hits and five mothers of 12 of the 27 children. The women themselves are missing. They were all in college when they disappeared, all are well educated.

At the others work the case, Meera looks through Cooper's briefcase and takes his badge.

They realize three of the women gave birth after they were abducted.

Meera takes Cooper's badge and uses it to access classified files.

Aram goes through Ted Caldwell's computer and finds a dossier on a woman named Charlotte Patterson, a sophomore at Georgetown.

In a parking garage, the killer from the opening flips through the file on Charlotte and closes in on her car.

Ressler and Liz race to the school to get to Charlotte before she leaves campus.

The killer pulls up alongside Charlotte's car and waits. He jumps out and grabs her, yanking her into his van just before Liz and Ressler arrive. He knocks over Ressler with his van and pulls away as Liz shoots at him.

The killer meets with Mallory, who is angry that he went ahead with the abduction. The kidnapper insists he had orders from Caldwell. Charlotte is sedated in the back of his van. Mallory shoots the kidnapper.

Back at the office, they have no paper trail linking Caldwell or Mallory to anything.

Back at the office, Mallory meets with a doctor, who assures him there's no link to his clinic.

Out in the woods, a man finds Kate Ellison's body. The coroner tells Liz and Ressler that Kate was in an induced coma for all the time she was missing. She has no muscle tone and was fed through a tube, and she's given birth several times. She was given prenatal care despite being sedated.

Aram calls Liz, he discovered that Owen Mallory was an alias. Liz and Ressler go talk to the Lassiters, he was posing as their son. But the Lassiters tell them Mallory was their son, by the name of Michael Shaw. They adopted him out of foster care when he was seven-years-old. He was with them for 16 months, but had severe attachment disorder. He began threatening to hurt himself and them and the doctors put him back in foster care.

Mrs. Lassiter tells Liz they blame themselves, their marriage was troubled and they weren't ""equipped for a child.""

Meera meets with Red covertly, bringing him files bearing someone's signature. He looks it over then tells her their business is done.

Red takes Liz to a nice mansion on a cul-de-sac. She wants help tracking the sedative used on the women. Red tells her the house isn't what it seems and she's about to meet one of the nicest drug dealers east of Cleveland.

Inside, there's a house party going on. Red introduces Liz to a college-aged kid named Russell, who knows all about the sedative hydroxapam, but says no one uses it anymore because it's too powerful.

He shows Red that only three pharmacies nearby carry it and of those, only eight doctors wrote prescriptions for it -- seven sleep therapists and one fertility doctor.

Liz and Ressler head to Dr. Hadley's Galatea Fertility Clinic. Mallory is there with him and cautions the receptionist to just get rid of them.

Instead, when Liz and Ressler don't leave, the man at the desk pulls a gun. Ressler disarms and cuffs him then goes looking for Hadley. He finds him in a lab reaching for a gun, and Ressler shoots him several times.

Liz enters a restricted area with plastic sheeting draped everywhere and finds women lying in beds, sedated and pregnant. There are more than a dozen of them.

Liz is taking in the disturbing scene with Mallory sneaks up behind her and knocks her over with a hospital bed. He knocks her down and knocks her gun away. He dumps one of the sedated women from her bed onto Liz and gets to her gun. He's about to fire when Ressler arrives and shoots Mallory in the arm.

Later, Cooper and a team are on the scene. There were 22 women, all unhurt. There is an in vitro clinic on site and the women's eggs were harvested.

In interrogation, Liz links Owen Mallory to Michael Shaw, his childhood name. Mallory says the Lassiters ""returned"" him as a child because they didn't want a child, they wanted an accessory. ""My legacy is complete, and there's nothing you can do to change that,"" he says.

Liz realizes he's the father of all the children. ""A part of me is thriving in every home that has my child,"" he says.

Liz comes home to see the ultrasound. She wipes away tears and takes Tom's hands. ""I can't do it,"" she tells him. ""It's us. I don't know what's wrong, I don't understand it, but something his not right,"" she says. She admits to having doubts that they might be ""broken.""

Red sneaks into Diane's house in the middle of the night and tells her he knows. ""You signed a directive ordering a mandatory security upgrade of the Post Office. That's how you got the blueprints into enemy hands. You're the dirty rat, Diane,"" he says.

She tells him she signed the directive for his protection. She tells him they came into the Post Office to make a point, but he'll never get away with hurting her.

She's threatening him when he shoots her in the stomach. ""You can't shoot me!"" she says. Red tells her he has an agreement with Fitch, but not with her. She tells him she knows the truth about that night, about what happened to his family. He desperately wants to know, but says if she knows the truth, then somebody else does, too. He shoots her several more times, killing her.

Liz sits alone at home and cries.

Tom goes out with Jolene, the substitute.

At the office, Cooper tells Meera he hates working with Red, but they never would have caught all these people without him. He tells her to go home.

At Diane's house, Red welcomes his cleaner to fix the scene."

We start in Turkey with a fancy lady in mourning wanting access to her husband's safe deposit box. A man calls her ""Mrs. Reddington."" She opens the box and smiles and leaves the bank happy. As she leaves the alarms go off but the guards can't place her in the crowd.

Dembe gives Ray an envelope the woman left in the box. It says to meet her at the Windsor at 8. He meets her and she says she got his key in Macau last winter. He says the stuff in box is worth 10 million. She said he stood her up in Florence and she needed to get his attention. He says in that case they should go to her room.

We cut to Tom on the phone. They talk about not taking the baby and she says she knows it's hard. Tom is resentful and sad. Tom informs her that a friend is pregnant. Liz says it's great and they should get them a gift and have them for dinner. He walks out angrily.

Red is looking at a particularly ""ugly"" Vermeer painting and telling Liz about it and how she's worth over $40 million. He claims it belongs to person who lives where he is staying, a hedge fund manager. He starts talking about the surveillance/intelligence state we now live in and bemoans that there is no longer human connection. He brings up Madeline Pratt and calls her a master of human connection and a thief and a woman of singular talents. Liz infers that he wants something of Madeline's and wants the FBI to help him get it. He tries to assuage her suffering about not taking the baby. She asks about Madeline. He says finding her is easy, catching her is harder. But she's asked Red to help her steal a famous effigy that was stolen and traded back to Syria. Apparently, there is a list of Soviet spies hidden in the statue.

Red meets with Harold. Harold is tense and wants to talk about Diane Fowler. Red claims he has no idea where she is and feigns innocence about her being missing. Harold says Red made it clear that he wouldn't come in until the mole had been caught and now he's here. Harold says if he had anything to do with Diane being missing Red will spend his life in a box.

They switch gears to Madeline Pratt. He runs down how she's been a master thief over the years, robbing powerful people and endangering national security. Red explains that Madeline wants his help to steal the effigy from the Syrian embassy. They assume the Syrians don't know about the list and that Madeline is working for the Russians. Harold doesn't want to okay the mission and Red says he's no thief but that Liz is a master at it. Harold gives it the okay but says she will be on foreign soil in the embassy and they can't help her.

Madeline basically forces Liz to audition for the job since it will be very high pressure with cameras and guards and such. Red gives her prompts and Liz spins a tale about robbing a store for its night deposits by seducing the store manager. She also steals Madeline's phone, all of which impresses Madeline who offers her the job and offers to pay her double. Liz says she'll do it.

They go over the plan to steal the effigy at a fancy ball at the Syrian embassy, breaking down the security measures and safe and stuff. She'll have 10 minutes at 9:20 to get in and out. (She steals an embassy employee's badge and clones it, cloning Madeline's phone's SIM card at the same time.)

Later, she's getting dressed in her fancy ball gown. Tom comes in and apologizes and likes her undercover look. So much he wants to get frisky before the mission. He also invites her to come to a teacher conference with him in Orlando this weekend, to get away. She says she would love to.

Before leaving Red informs Liz that he's discovered that Madeline is dating a Russian mobster -- unbeknownst to her-- and he is probably playing her so they really need to get that effigy. Liz is confused wondering why Madeline needs them to steal the effigy. Red comes down and compliments Liz's dress. He's all tux-ed up as well since he's going as her date. She reminds him of the danger of their mission and that she has no back-up. He tells her she has him.

Meera goes to see Harold in his office. He reiterates that he's going to get to the bottom of Diane Fowler's disappearance. He says he knows it's a murder investigation and Red is their chief suspect. He asks Meera to talk to Red and find out what evidence he had.

Everyone heads to the ball. Red dances Liz over to the security door. He tells her she's not a cop tonight, she's a criminal. She heads to the security door and gets in with the cloned ID while Red goes to dance with Madeline. While Liz tries to complete the mission getting by guard and busting open the safe, Red asks Madeline what they're doing there, trying to get to the bottom of what's going on. Madeline asks why Red stood her up in Florence.

Liz opens the safe and it's empty. Madeline's date grabs her hand and takes her to the ""safe room."" Red shoots off a gun and head off to save Liz. In the safe room they watch Red on video and Madeline fingers him as the man who set off the alarm. While everyone else is looking at the screens she grabs the effigy off a nearby shelf, double-crossing Red and Liz as suspected. She needed someone to set off the alarm so she would be taken into the safe room.

Red goes to save Liz who has been handcuffed by embassy guards. Red puts on a show, pretending to be her gay assistant, distracting the man guarding Liz. He finally knocks the guy out and undoes Liz.

Madeline calls someone and tells them they have what they want and she expects payment within the hour. She opens it and looks inside and smiles.

Liz goes back to the Post Office and Harold's not happy saying the Syrian's are blaming Red for the thievery. Thanks to the SIM card she stole from Madeline's phone they've got a lead on a potential terrorist who might be their guy. Tom calls about the trip and Liz can't go. He's angry and says her job has become their life. He says he's going to fly out tonight and the best thing for them might be some time apart. She says that's the last thing she wants. He says it's not always about what she wants. She says she hates this job.

They bring in their lead who explains his father stole the effigy from the British museum to bring it back to Syria where it belonged. The compound where and his father lived was raided by Americans in a CIA covert op to get the effigy, not because it led to Soviet spies but because inside it are directions to nuclear weapons hidden in America by the Russians in the Cold War. His father handed it to him, who was 7 at the time, to safeguard it. The Americans caught him with it, let him go, but kept the effigy. And that's why Pratt was hired to steal the effigy.

Red catches up with Madeline and asks her about the coordinates in the statue. She tells him to buzz off and that the reason she did this to him was because he stood her up in Florence, and that was their chance for a fresh start. She said if she was interested in an affair she'd find a man with hair. Suddenly, out of nowhere they are beset by two men, tased, and dragged away. Madeline wakes up in one dark cell and sees Red in another.

The gang at the Post Office goes over the specs of the suitcase nukes buried at the coordinates in the effigy.

Red wakes up and Madeline tells him that the Syrians aren't getting the effigy back because she sold it to the Russians. He responds by telling a story of something that happened long ago.

He explains he was on his way home one Christmas. He literally ran out of gas. He says he walked four or five miles and the whole time all he could think about was his family and the sound of his daughter at the piano. He was worried he had ruined Christmas for them by running out of gas and leaving gifts in the car. But then he realized it would be a funny story to be told again and again. He finally arrived home and walked through the door and there was just blood everywhere. He cries as he remembers the scene. He says he can still smell the nape of his daughter's neck and feel her little fingers on my cheek.

He says this is why he stood her up in Florence and why he has left true love all over the globe. (Presumably because he once knew real love and warmth and couldn't bear to be hurt like that again.)

The men return and drag Red away. Madeline says she'll tell them what they want to know. They offer her a yellow legal pad. She writes it out and tells the men they have what they need and demands to know where Red is. He then comes into view, perfectly dressed and the men hand him the note. It was all a set up. He had them fake kidnapped and told that story to get the location of the effigy from her. She freaks out and calls him a son of a bitch. She asks if the story about his family was true. He says she should've taken him up on his offer to run off somewhere warm and have a fling. She says he'll never get the effigy in time.

Liz and the gang go after it, and, of course, retrieve it after much derring do. But when they open it's just full of sand no list of coordinates. Harold sent men back to the warehouse where Red was keeping her and she was gone. Red says he got the coordinates from Madeline and he wants the effigy in return. They trade.

Liz tries to call Tom but he doesn't answer. She confesses to Ressler that she thinks Tom is going to leave her.

Red arrives home. The ugly Vermeer is gone and there is a note from Madeline. It says ""She's waiting for you in Florence.'' We see Madeline looking at the painting.

Tom checks into his hotel in Orlando and runs into that hottie substitute teacher who has been tasked to watch him.

Liz sits on the floor and looks at the sonogram.

Harold meets with an unctuous special agent Walter Gary Martin. He says the director values the work that Harold is doing. Martin says he wants to talk about Diane Fowler and how Harold has asked Meera to investigate. Martin says he has to stop and Fowler's disappearance is being handled by the D.C. bureau, period, and if the bureau has questions they'll call and he wants all of Harold's files."

A man with long hair and a beard walks along a snowy highway in a tattered suit carrying a paper bag. He seems dazed when a motorist stops and tries to help him. He drops his paper bag. In the bag is a badge identifying him as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. The police bring a woman to him who says he's been missing for 12 years. She greets him in the hospital as Mark and IDs herself as Donna. She hugs him and asks him where he's been.

Red meets a no-nonsense man in a black cowboy hat (later identified as Hastings) in a car with Texas plates. Red shows the man a picture of a woman named Lucy Brooks, who is supposed to be dead. Red says she's alive and going by the name Jolene. Red wants to give him more info but the man begs off, saying he doesn't tell Red how to do his job. The man says he'll find the girl. Red says he doesn't want him to find her since he knows where she is. He wants to know where she's been. He says she's already faked her death to elude him. She's the woman currently lining Tom up in her sights pretending to be a teacher.

At a teacher conference in Orlando, Jolene and Tom are debating ""Lolita"" as acceptable for kids to read with other disapproving teachers. Tom ignores a call from Liz. Jolene is flirty with him.

Red goes to see Liz at the Post Office and apprises her of the Mark Hastings case, the returned Assistant U.S. Attorney, which is now front page news. Hastings had worked on a drug cartel case and Red thinks he was held captive, but not by the cartel. Red thinks ""The Judge"" had him. He thought it was a ""justice myth"" until now, saying all cultures have a ""court of last resort"" for the hopeless. Prisoners can state their case and claim they were falsely imprisoned, and eventually their appeals letter reaches ""The Judge."" If freedom or life was taken unfairly, The Judge demands the same in return. The Judge is number 57 on the Blacklist.

Liz brings their theory to Ressler, Cooper and the gang, showing them a case from 12 years ago in which Hastings may have withheld evidence that sent a man to prison for...12 years. She shows other cases of missing law enforcement and judicial officials who have gone missing in similar cases of apparent miscarriages of justice.

The belief is the appeals letters are sent to a book depository in Virginia. The team tracks down a man named Frank Gordon who works there, who himself was incorrectly incarcerated. Gordon works for the literacy program that is apparently the front for ""The Judge."" The team finds the space he stays in in the depository. Ressler wades into the dark space alone. Gordon punches him in the face. Liz gets off a shot but Gordon gets away.

They find appeals letters from all over the country. One of the prisoners gets their attention, a man named Rifkin, scheduled for execution the next day due to a false account of killing Afghan civilians. The file leads back to Cooper who was there. Cooper scoffs and says the guy is definitely guilty.

Liz goes to see Rifkin, who is with a woman from the Amnesty Collective, Ruth Kipling. Kipling alludes to ""The Judge."" Rifkin says it's a myth, but he was beaten by Harold Cooper on the orders of Assistant US Attorney Thomas Connelly. (Ruth is played by Academy Award-winning actress Dianne Wiest, so, obviously, she's The Judge.)

Back in Orlando and the teacher conference, Jolene and Tom continue to flirt in a bar. She claims to have a fiancé. He talks about the job and keeping secrets. She asks if he's good at that. He doesn't answer. She asks where Liz is. He asks after her fiancé. Then they start kissing. A child walks in on them in the bathroom. Jolene laughs and Tom apologizes. She claims she is sorry too and walks out, but soon returns and gives him her room key.

Frank Gordon gets out of a car in front of a country home. He's talking into a cell phone about grabbing Connolly and Cooper if Rifkin is executed. Kipling meets him with a big pot and tells him it's ""feeding time"" and they head to the barn. The horse stalls are converted cells filled with prisoners. She hands the prisoners food. Gordon seems freaked out by the prisoners. Kipling reminds him he was innocent and these people are not since they put people like him-- and her father-- behind bars. Gordon is worried the FBI is now on to them. Kipling says until they're busted, they're still going, and if Rifkin dies for the others to carry out ""the sentence.""

Back at the Post Office, the team works on breaking down the Rifkin case. They find falsified documents and try to track people down. Liz tracks down one of the people involved who claims he tried to come forward to narc on Connolly who basically said they didn't have enough evidence on Rifkin and ordered Cooper to beat a confession out of him. Which, according to this man, Cooper did and then helped to falsify the documents. The guy is freaked out that Rifkin, it would appear, is really going to die.

Cooper goes to see Connolly and tells him they have a problem they need to contain.

Meanwhile, Hastings runs down Jolene's place, which is full of cash, a flash drive, and fake IDs. She's been many places Red has been. The man calls Red and tells him that she wants to cause trouble, and is either hitting a lot of little targets or is going to hit one big one.

Liz confronts Cooper, who is with US Attorney Connolly. She asks to speak privately. Connolly won't allow that and Cooper tells her to speak freely. She asks about beating a confession out of Rifkin. Cooper says he did not railroad an innocent man. He admits to beating him and says Rifkin is paying the price for his crime. Connolly scoffs at Liz's efforts to do anything about stopping the execution. Cooper tells her she should worry about her career.

Liz tries to reach the ""clemency advisor"" just as Rifkin is being strapped into the lethal injection table. Liz strikes out. Connolly and Cooper witness the execution. Rifkin looks at the witnesses and declares his innocence. Kipling looks at them and says ""Even God won't forgive you for this."" Rifkin says ""Goodnight mother."" After the execution, Connolly looks relieved. Cooper looks conflicted. As they walk out Connolly says they did the right thing. Cooper agrees but says they did it the wrong way. Connolly notes he's poked around and discovered that no one is exactly clear on what it is Cooper does and that they're managing to take down amazing people not on their radar and asks how. Cooper says nothing. Connolly promises to appoint him to Director of the FBI when he becomes Attorney General and Cooper will then tell him all about the secret weapon they both know he has. When they arrive at their car they are abducted by Gordon and brought to the stables. Kipling/The Judge confronts them. Cooper toes the party line and she slaps his face.

Liz tells Red that Cooper has been taken. Red tells her to talk to Hastings. Liz is worried that Cooper will die since ""The Judge"" is all about ""an eye for an eye.""

The Judge yells at Cooper and Connolly and says if they did their job right she wouldn't have to do hers. She asks them how they plead. Connolly pleads not guilty. She says I find you guilty.

Red goes to see a former Naval Academy classmate named Richard at a Navy outpost in VA. He tells Red he made a helluva mess when he left and destroyed some careers, but not Richard's apparently. Red asks about the Rifkin case. Richard says rooming with Red was the worst thing that ever happened to him. Red says the men who want this information can be very ""helpful"" and get him back on track.

Liz tries to talk to Hastings who appears too traumatized to respond. He does, however, say ""Goodnight Mother"" which Liz recognizes from the execution. They work it out and trace it back to Ruth Kipling and get her address in Pennsylvania. Gordon is about to kill Cooper and Connelly in a janky, homemade electric chair when the cavalry arrives in the form of the FBI and Red, who has the information that Cooper and Connolly need. He has a classified file from the Pentagon that proves that Rifkin had turned and become a terrorist, which had been covered up. Red convinces The Judge to surrender since he knew this was always about justice for her, not vengeance.

The men are released from the stables. Connolly asks Cooper what happened. Cooper says ""My secret weapon.""

Liz brings the pleas from the prison to Cooper who tells her to bring them to the Pentagon.

Cooper pulls her aside and says he'll understand if she feels the need to report him for admitting to beating Rifkin. Liz says they've had enough judgment for one day.

Cooper tells Red that saving his bacon doesn't earn him any leverage. Red says a war is coming and the break in to the Post Office and the disappearance of Diane Fowler is just the beginning. Cooper asks if Red wants his help. Red says not now, but he will when the time comes. Red also tells Cooper to reach out to his old Naval buddy Admiral Richard and pull a few strings to help him out.

Red goes to meet Hastings, who shows him the flash drive, it's full of pictures of Red, Dembe, Tom and Liz. Red says he thinks Jolene is ""finishing an operation"" and he wants to see how it plays out. We cut to Tom at the bar contemplating his wedding ring. He takes it off, finishes his drink, and heads upstairs to Jolene's room. But when she kisses him, he rebuffs her. He says he loves his wife. She says ""wrong answer."" She says ""Elizabeth Keen is not your wife - she's your target."" Tom says perhaps she was sent by ""them"" to test him, but he loves his wife because that is what is he is supposed to do, that is his job.

""The Judge"" heads to jail. The inmates tip their heads respectfully."

A man escapes from prison in Japan.

An FBI agent puts his kids to bed in Tokyo. They are all headed back to the States in a few weeks. Later, while he is sorting through a mountain of bills he is visited by the prison escapee. His name is Mako Tanida (#83) and apparently this agent and other members of a task force the agent was on were responsible for putting him in prison. He calls himself collateral damage in the FBI search for Red.

Tanida brings the agent up to the roof and gives him two options: He can commit sepukku and rip out his own innards or he will kill him himself and then kill his wife and kids. The agent makes him promise about his family and then guts himself.

Jolene drops by Tom and Liz's saying that she and her fiancé are looking for a place in their neighborhood. She drops the news that they went to an art exhibit and he didn't ask her to go because she was working. Liz gives Jolene her cell phone number so she can give her a realtor recommendation.

At the funeral, the other agents from the task force, including Ressler, toast Sam and can't believe that he committed suicide, it just doesn't feel right. Audrey shows up and the other agents are happy to see she and Ressler are back together. Before she and Ressler depart, one of the agents says he thinks Red is involved somehow. He goes to see Liz to get in touch with Red and she says oddly enough Red is looking for him too.

At the moment Red is at the ballet delivering a check to a ballerina and wondering if something will be ready in time on the 22nd. She says it will be. Dembe comes up and says he found Ressler.

Ressler and Red meet and he tells him about Mako Tanida. He explains he broke out of prison. Ressler figures Red wants something in this deal, like Tanida's head in a box. Red says the scalp he's worried about is Ressler's own since Tanida will be coming for the other members of the task force.

We see Tanida passing through homeland security with a fake passport. We cut to Tanida confronting another of the agents from the task force. We then cut to that agent face down in a pool of blood in the snow by a bridge.

Everyone gathers at the Post Office to debrief on Tanida, the killings, and their next move. While he was in prison Tanida's operation grew extensively somehow, including in the U.S. His younger brother has been running the show. They find out about the agent and Tanida entering the U.S. Ressler's distracted, he goes to get Audrey to keep her safe.

Jolene approaches Tom on the street and he is angry that she came to his house noting that she is not his handler. She tells him ""Berlin"" is having doubts. He says he doesn't care and that he's done everything they asked including marrying Liz and making her think his entire world revolves around her. He leads her into his safe house/HQ where he has a big evidence-style wall with pictures and documents and colored yarn strung across it. He explains about the attack and the situation with Red and Liz finding his bag so he said he had to go dark. He tells her about the cameras in his house which he knows weren't FBI. She says she can't help him unless he calms down. He explains his wall saying as far as he can tell their paths have crossed a few times over the years and that Red has been funneling money to Liz through the adoptive father. He explains the Post Office. He notes he sat right next to Red once and could've put a bullet in his head. Jolene says that wasn't his mission. As they leave, Red's guy snaps pics of them together.

Ressler gets Audrey from his place and they take off. He starts to explain about what's happening when an SUV pulls up next to them and shoots at them. They chase and crash. Ressler goes after Tanida, who shoots Audrey dead. Ressler is bereft. Tanida gets away.

Cooper tells Ressler they'll find Tanida but they have to follow procedure. Ressler isn't interested in procedure which Cooper understands but also tells him he's a good agent and a good man and he shouldn't compromise himself. He promises to bring Tanida to justice for him. Ressler isn't waiting. He calls the final living member of the task force, a retired agent. He doesn't have any leads for Ressler except Red. The guy says he wants to get Red alone for five minutes.

Red goes to visit his private eye who shows him the photos. Red says to bring her to him. The PI wants double the money in that case, mostly because he doesn't like Red or his hat. Red agrees.

Ressler goes to the bridge where his friend was found and meets with Red. He asks Red where Tanida is. Red tries to offer condolences and says there are few like him that truly understand about grief. Red says to go home and turn back from this quest for vengeance because once he goes dark he will never be able to come back. Ressler says all he feels his hate. Red says he's going to need it. Red tells him about an underground hospital where the survivors of the ambush might be getting stitched up.

Ressler and his agent buddy go there and coerce an injured guy into telling them where Tanida is by shooting him.

Jolene goes for a walk and just as the PI is about to grab her, Tom attacks him from behind and knocks him out. He and Jolene grab his body and take off.

Meera and Liz check out the scene of the underground hospital and work out it was Ressler and his buddy. Liz goes to see Red, who is still trying to work out details at the ballet. He admits that he helped Ressler. She is mad at him. She thinks they need to find Tanida before Ressler does something he can't come back from psychologically. Red tells her that the younger Tanida brother is dead not running his brother's business. They realize that Ressler's retired FBI buddy is the one actually running Tanida's business, he went bad.

But Ressler has found him.

Tom ties up the PI at his safe house and tries to get info out of him. Jolene is nervous. Tom says this is all her fault and Red tracked her and she is compromised and her trail will lead to him and she needs to disengage, call Liz and tell her she's leaving town. The PI thinks it's a double-cross and he will kill them both if she does that. She does it. Tom kills them.

Ressler and his buddy drive a handcuffed Tanida into the woods. Tanida taunts Ressler about Audrey and his other agent buddies. The dirty agent is driving and pretends to tell Tanida to shut up. But when he realizes Tanida is giving away important info about his brother Ressler starts to get confused and wants to hear him talk but his buddy shoots him and Ressler tries to wrestle away the gun and they get in an accident. When Ressler comes to his now injured buddy is running away into the woods. Ressler tracks him down and his buddy confesses and tries to make his case and says how could he kill his best friend. Ressler is disgusted by this. He points out that it's Red that brought Audrey back into his life and why he had 3 more months with her and it's this guy's fault now that she is dead. He hands his buddy a knife to commit seppuku or, Ressler says, he will kill him himself.

Back at the Post Office they figure out where Ressler went and they take off after him. They arrive and head into the woods and Liz tries to stop him from shooting him. Ressler asks her what if this guy killed Tom? The guy starts asking him to shoot him since he knows what will happen to him in prison. The guy keeps taunting him. Ressler shoots near him but not at him. The guy apologizes tearfully. Liz tries to comfort him. She shakes him off. Suddenly, the guy grabs the knife and guts himself.

Back at the car, Tom sees that Tanida is gone, slipped his cuffs in the crash.

Later he sits, bruised and battered at home, finally grieving about Audrey. He finds a home pregnancy test in her things and starts to cry.

Tom also heads to the woods, under the cover of darkness, and buries the bodies.

Red comes to the ballet, the dancers gossip about him backstage, saying he's one of their biggest donors and that his daughter used to dance ballet. Dembe meets him in the box and says the PI and Jolene are both gone. Red is the only person in the theatre, he watches the ballet and the dancers disappear and he sees his little daughter twirling onstage. We see he is clutching a weathered program, likely from his daughter's last dance recital.

Tom is in the shower scrubbing off the blood. Liz joins him and tells him she got a call from Jolene saying she was leaving town. She kisses him and we see his bloody hands smear on her back.

Dembe delivers a box to Ressler with a note from Red saying he knows nothing can take the pain away but eventually he'll learn to live with it. Ressler opens the box, inside: Tanida's head."

A man works alone in an office. Suddenly a printer starts spitting out pages that have the word ""Smile"" repeated on them. Suddenly all the office computers and phones go haywire. The man freaks out and starts unplugging wires and shutting things down. The screens read ""IVAN."" He has been hacked. He leaves and calls someone named Edmund, saying they have a serious problem and the hacker may have gotten the protect files. He says he's headed to protect the prototype now and dumps his cellphone. Camera eyes follow his movement. Suddenly the person watching on the computers sets off the guy's airbag. The man crashes. And a hooded figure steals something from the car.

Red and Dembe meet with ""Mr. Kaplan"" in the woods. They are at the scene where Tom buried the bodies. He tells her to put it back the way she found it. He calls to report Jolene as a missing person.

Liz give Tom a gift for his classroom. The police show up asking about Jolene. Liz and Tom say the last time they saw her was at their house asking about an apartment. He notes that she subbed for a specific teacher. They don't have much information but offer to call if they think of anything.

Liz goes to meet Red. He's working on a restoration project. He hands her the newspaper with the news of the car crash from the opening and he says it was engineered by a notorious criminal named Ivan. He knows Ivan because he stole from him and that he spent an evening with Ivan's brother sharing stories. Liz says it's not her job to settle his grudges so she needs more proof. Red says he took credit for the murder in a dark corner of the Internet. Ivan apparently has a long history of nefarious activity selling Russian secrets. Red says this is the first time Ivan has struck on U.S. soil and this is only beginning.

Back at the Post Office they start running down the background of the victim. As an aside, Liz asks Aram to pull Jolene's cell phone records.

Liz, Aram, and Ressler go to look at the car at the junkyard and she asks Ressler why he's working. He says working keeps his mind off Audrey. Aram figures out the car was tampered with and Ivan left a digital calling card. They find the empty case from which Ivan stole the prototype. Other government agents wheel up and order Liz, Aram, and Ressler away from the car.

The newly arrived agents are from the NSA. They think the agents took ""classified tech."" Cooper tells the guy they can share information or not but if they waste time dancing around more people could die. The NSA guy says the victim was one of theirs working on a specific operation, Project Skeleton Key. It's a kind of cyber warfare weapon, designed to wipe out an enemy's defense grid, weapons systems, communications. Ivan now has the prototype. The digital equivalent of a nuclear warhead.

Liz goes back to Red who says if she wants to smoke Ivan out she has to get him to want to, by creating a problem for him and then solving it. He heads to Minsk.

Red sits down with Ivan at a restaurant and reminds him that he stole 5 million dollars from him and he's come to collect with interest. Ivan says he has no interest. Red tells him he better not leave the restaurant because there's a warrant for his arrest in the murder of he NSA agent and the authorities are on the way. He offers him safe passage out of Minsk, for five million plus interest. Ivan blows him off, not believing him. Just then cops pull up outside and Ivan says he is now willing to accept Red's generous offer. They start to skedaddle but Red says he wants his payment first. Standing in the kitchen Ivan is flabbergasted by this request. He opens his iPad and makes it happen. They run out the back. Ressler pretends to run after them and Red ""shoots"" him. Meera walks up. Ressler sits up and asks if she thinks Ivan bought the charade. Meera says she did.

Back in D.C. Liz shows Tom the information that Jolene was really ""Lucy Brooks"" a wanted criminal and a convicted felon. He acts very confused. Liz is just freaked out that Jolene was in their house and it's her fault and gets sad that Jolene could've done something to him. He says he's a big boy who can take care of himself and she shouldn't beat herself up because there's no way to really know people. Liz swears she's going to find her and who she works for, whatever it takes.

Aram arrives with her phone records and gives her the last address she called. Tom's safe house.

On the plane ride back out of Minsk, Red asks Ivan why he took the Skeleton Key and what his price is. He offers to double the number saying Ivan could use the retirement money. He realizes Ivan doesn't know what he's talking about. Ivan says someone has been using his name for hacks and that his beef has always been with Russia not the U.S. He says he doesn't know who is impersonating him. He says whoever it is is very good at covering his tracks and Ivan hasn't been able to ID him. Red says he might be able to help with that.

Back at the Post Office they deduce the mystery hacker has only been operating for the last few months and has hacked other government stuff and hacked Social Security to raise someone's benefit payments. They go to see the woman who benefitted and she says she has no idea and feels confused. She scoffs at the idea of computer hacking and says she can't set the thermostat without her grandson's help.

We cut to a high school kid taking a test.

Liz calls Tom and says she's following up a Jolene lead. He realizes looking at his security camera that she is right outside his building. He quickly hangs up, pulls down his evidence wall-- filled with her pictures-- starts burning it and skedaddles. She walks around the space and sees guns, cameras, and computers. She draws her weapon, he eludes her and at one point finds him on the other side of the same door. He knocks her back with the door and then punches her to the ground and runs off, presumably before she can see who hit her. She runs to the street but he is gone.

Liz talks to the police in the space, noting the place was already ransacked. She gives him a description of her attacker and asks to be kept in the loop.

Tom goes to a pay phone and reports via code words that he's been compromised and that he's been forced to ""liquidate.""

Our high school student watches a girl he has a crush on in the cafeteria. He oddly has all the same food as her and mirrors her movements as she eats. Liz and the gang show up and he skedaddles. His name is Harrison Lee. Liz tracks him down in the hallway and even on the run with his iPad he triggers a fire alarm and loses them in the crowd of kids pouring out of classrooms.

Red is impressed with the kid's moves. Liz has come to ask him about Jolene and shows her picture to him. He wonders what she'd like him to do. He says he has no answers for her. She asks if he can't or he won't. He says it's a matter of interpretation. She asks, for once, for the whole truth. He says he doesn't have the whole truth. She says to forget it and she had no problems until he showed up and she thanks God she has Tom. She tells him to have fun with his project.

Back at the Post Office, they've uncovered that the girl that Harrison was watching is the daughter of the Project Skeleton Key project. They call him. And as they do, suddenly everything at the Post Office goes out. Harrison has hacked them. The entire D.C. metro area has gone dark. Harrison activated the Skeleton Key.

He sends a text to the girl, Abby, to meet him outside under the pretense that he is her friend Jackie. Liz and Ressler show up to her house and she's gone. She is outside, Harrison begins to illuminate street lamps and tells her to follow the trail of lights. Abby's father comes to the Post Office to try and track the Skeleton Key. They track him down to a Metro station.

Abby is headed down into the dark station. He meets her and she is confused why he's down there. He admits he was texting her as Jackie. She looks scared when he starts telling her things about herself. He says he would never hurt her. She says she just wants to go home. He shows her the Skeleton Key prototype. He says he stole it so her dad won't have to move to Colorado and thus, she wouldn't have to move either because he knows she doesn't want to. He says he loves her. She freaks and tries to run, he tries to grab her and she falls and hits her head and is knocked out. He runs and jumps on a train and gets it moving just as Liz and the gang arrive. Liz shoots out a window and jumps onto the moving train.

Liz tries to talk him down and into stopping the train. She says she knows this was all a romantic gesture. Liz says they can end this and everything will be okay. He says they can end it and speeds up the train so it will crash. Liz says this isn't his only option. He thinks he's out of options since he accidentally killed that guy. Liz says she knows it was an accident and that this isn't what Abby would want. He engages the emergency brake. The brakes slow the train right before the point of impact. Abby reunites with her dad. Ressler watches their tearful reunion. Liz invites Ressler over for dinner. He tells her to not feel bad for having someone waiting for her at home.

She heads home to a cooking Tom. She tells him that there was evidence of foul play at Jolene's apartment and that there is no suspect. She says there was a man at the apartment who knocked her down. She says she's fine and didn't get a good look at him. He claims he is upset by the idea of someone actively hurting her. She asks for wine. She opens the evidence file from the D.C. police. In it are pictures of the guns, cameras and other stuff. There is also a picture of the trash can. In the trash can is the toy that Liz gave to Tom that morning. In her head she sees flashes of Red telling her to beware of her husband, her finding his box of passports, money, and guns under the floorboards, of him being taken in for questioning. She is shocked. Tom asks if she's okay. She says she's fine.

She heads to see Red and says he was right. He pulls out an antique music box-- it was the restoration project Red was working on-- and plays the tune on it. She recognizes the song from. She flashes back to the fire from her childhood. She begins to cry remembering the scene saying she used to have nightmares and her dad would lay in bed with her while she was having nightmares and tell her she was safe and hum this song. She says he spent days working on the music box and that he knew. She cries and he holds her and he says everything is going to be okay."

A woman runs to catch a cab to get to LaGuardia. The cab begins driving crazily, swerving and weaving and driving in the wrong lanes. The driver apologizes to her, kisses a picture on his dashboard, and then crashes in a fireball against a truck.

A man appraises a picture of the woman, puts it in a shredder, and makes a call saying he'd like to make a wire transfer. He then tends to large patch of mushrooms he is growing in his crazy house. They hang from bags in the ceiling. he then takes his pulse, takes off his shirt-- revealing many scars on his body-- makes a mushroom smoothie and sits in a chair, plucks off his nose--revealing a serious disfigurement-- turns on a UV light, puts on goggles and sips his smoothie. He is Milton Bobbitt, number 135 on the list.

Tom makes pancakes for Liz, gluten free, and then proposes--literally-- that they renew their wedding vows. She says yes. He hugs her and he says how much he loves her. Twice. He leaves and she goes about destroying the kitchen and then rifling through their house looking for clues.

She then convenes with Red in a storage space to get to the bottom of the Tom situation. She will not take Red's business that he knows nothing. He says he doesn't know much more than she does. He says several years ago that someone began meddling in his business and to protect himself he inventoried his vulnerabilities including her. He's been monitoring Tom since he entered Liz's life. He discovered Tom bought several passports from a trusted forger about a year ago. He doesn't know the endgame of the people Tom works for but they both know he inserted himself into her life because of Red. She wants to know why and he says it doesn't matter. She freaks out and knocks some stuff off a table and says it's all that matters since this is her life. Red says the only thing that matters is the immediate threat, her husband and finding out who he is and who he works for. He gives her the surveillance tapes from the men who were watching Liz and Tom. She tells him about Tom wanting to renew her vows. He says he's unraveling and is trying to keep her close. He says this is an opportunity for her to get close to the people he's working for and he'll have to act normal in front of everyone, her colleagues and all.

He says she'll need a case and presents her with the file on the taxi crash in Brooklyn. He says it was no accident but a murder, the work of the Undertaker. He convinces ordinary people to kill on his behalf, usually murder suicides like the cab driver and the woman. We see the Undertaker chatting with a woman in the car. The woman approaches a man at a gas station, determines the man is her target, pours gas on him, and asks for forgiveness saying she has a brother and then drops a match, igniting them both.

Liz brings the cases to the Post Office and explains about the Undertaker and these assassinations by suicide, how he convinces regular people to become killers that can never be traced back to the person who put out the hit.

Liz and Ressler go to see the wife of the cab driver. The wife notes the driver recently came into an inheritance and had a brain tumor. The woman in the gas station had terminal cervical cancer. They both had mental illness and now both of their families are being taken care financially.

The undertaker goes to see an elderly man in what appears to be a nursing home. The man lost his health insurance because of his heart condition. The Undertaker says he offers something better than life insurance: his wife and daughter would be taken care of if he did what this guy was asking. The Undertaker shows him a figure on a piece of paper and the elderly man says ""keep talking.""

Liz surprises Tom with a surprise vow renewal, having invited all of their friends including his ""brother"" and best man Craig. He is indeed surprised saying they only just talked about it yesterday. Liz says they've put too many things on hold for her job so she wanted to get this done. They all share some champagne and she bags Craig's glass for fingerprint/DNA purposes.

Tom and ""Craig"" argue in the bathroom. He says Liz called this morning and was asking about her parents and their accident in Tucson. Craig thinks she is smart and is on to Tom. Tom says he ""knows"" Liz. Craig hopes his BS is exceptional since in less than five minutes he has to fall in love all over again.

They redo their vows, he says when he's with her he knows he doesn't have to pretend and that's a gift that he thanks God for everyday. Liz says at first she thought it was odd when he asked to renew their vows and she said she realized how much they've been through in such a short time and she realizes this is the beginning of something amazing, a new chapter and she wanted to stand in front of him and all of their friends to tell him how excited she is about what's coming next and she thinks it's going to be one hell of a ride. Craig, who is presiding, pronounces them husband and wife again. They kiss.

Liz watches the surveillance video of her and Tom in her storage space HQ hanging pictures on an evidence white board including pics of Tom and Jolene. She goes back to the video and sees Tom doing something odd on the tape, pulling a key out of a living room lamp stand. She goes to the lamp and retrieves the key. She also gives Dembe the champagne flute to run tests. He appreciates her paint color: Chicago Skyline.

Back at the Post Office Aram finds a common thread between the everyday assassins. They're both receiving funds from a bank in the Caymans and sees that they've been doing it for years all over the world. They get a bead on the elderly black man, Danny, that the Undertaker just approached. It turns out he has congestive heart failure, the Undertaker wanted him to shoot a politician in Boston. Liz and Ressler show up before he does it though and manage to talk him down before he shoots the guy with Liz asking him: ""is this really how you want to die?""

Red goes to a Bosnian professor in San Salvador to help him track down Craig Keen, Tom's ""brother,"" whose alias is quite good. The professor doesn't want to help him with a ""touch DNA"" process. Apparently, Red was involved in the demise of this guy's girlfriend/wife and convinces him to help him after agreeing to let him stay with this woman in a villa that Red owns.

Liz checks in with Red about where they are in the case. Red tells her to figure out how the Undertaker knows these people are dying. He says he's discovered Craig's real name and it's time for the three of them to have a chat. Liz tracks him down, pummels him, and knocks him down and draws her gun on him and asks if they can talk.

She handcuffs him to the sink and keeps banging him head against the sink and says she knows his real name and wants to know who he is and who he works for. He says she has no idea who she's dealing with. She says she never liked him. She gets called away and has Dembe and Red take her place. She tells them that Craig isn't cooperating. Red tells Dembe to get the hacksaw so they can take him out in pieces. He then laughs and says he's just kidding.

Ressler returns after talking to Danny. With clues from him they realize all of the assassins had canceled life insurance policies by the same company. Liz begs off the hunt saying it's Tom, Ressler tells her to take all the time she needs.

Red takes Craig to a museum and babbles on about art and puppet shows. Craig says he will die before he gives them anything. Dembe walks by, wheeling Craig's mother by them in the museum in a wheelchair. Red starts babbling about the awesome Bob Ross. Craig says they better not hurt her. Red says it's time to go back to the hotel.

Meera and Ressler go to the insurance company. The Undertaker overhears them talking to them. The guy they'e talking to says they need to talk to Milton, the creepy guy who oversees dead policies, aka the Undertaker. He jets. Ressler and Meera break into his crazy mushroom pleasure dome. He's not there but they find a file on the next victim.

The next victim is the doctor who worked on the mangled Milton. Milton is taking this job himself and he pulls a gun on the guy.

Liz returns to the hotel where Dembe and Red are watching a movie and Craig is again chained to the sink. He says he gets phone calls and he does what the people on the phone tell him to do. He says he knows no names including Tom's. He says he does have a brother in Chicago and talks about a woman named Nicky but they don't sit around and chat sharing life stories. He says there's a reason there are no people in his life because none of it is real. The phone rings and he says it's likely Tom with whom he was supposed to meet with.

Back at the Post Office, Cooper wonders where Keen is. Meera says personal time. Ressler returns and points out that the last three murders were a different MO than the Undertaker usually does: the last three were related to him personally and his diabetes diagnosis. He was part of a clinical trial and the last three -- the taxi, the gas station, this doctor-- were all people were related to that.

Craig takes Tom's call. He tries to stall him and says he has to be patient. Craig says that's easy for Tom to say since he's the one who has to deal with Berlin. Red asks what Berlin is. When he won't talk he tells Dembe to wipe down the room because they're taking the conversation elsewhere. Craig doesn't like this and hops up, handcuffs on and jumps out the window, plunging to his death. The Undertaker meanwhile has brought the doctor to a cemetery. He monologues about death and all the stuff he's done to stave off death both modern and alternative. He says he's come to accept that he's going to die and he unveils a bomb strapped to his chest. He says he's not angry at all and he wants to thank the doctor for this incredible journey he's been on and who would've thought anything good would've come from what this doctor did to him. He then pulls off his nose.

Back at the Post Office they deduce Milton must be doing the last job himself and he's likely at the cemetery.

Back there Milton is now monologuing about what he's done for the families of his assassins. Just then Meera and Ressler and Liz arrive. Ressler comes close enough to be in the blast zone. Everyone yells at him to stop. Ressler arrests the doctor, for all of the terrible things he did in his clinical trial and tampering and other nefarious stuff. The doctor is aghast and asks about Milton. Ressler notes that Milton doesn't seem like he wants to get arrested today. He pulls the doctor away and then Milton blows himself to literal pieces.

Liz goes back to work in her storage space. Hanging the key from the lamp on the evidence wall.

Red goes to meet with Cooper and look at some files, Bobbitt's client list. Cooper asks if he found what he was looking for. Red simply says goodnight.

In the storage space Liz continues to look at surveillance tape of Tom doing stuff in the house. She tells Red she can't look at him much less touch him anymore. Red tells her she needs to stay the course. She says she doesn't think she can. They put a charred piece of paper on the wall that says ""Berlin."" Red doesn't know what it means.

At home Liz puts the key back under the lamp. Tom comes home. Liz says she wanted to invite Craig to dinner before he left and she called and he didn't call back. Tom said Craig left without saying goodbye. She wonders if they could be less alike. He puts a hand on her shoulder and says ""we're newylweds."" She takes off her jacket and looks at him sexily. She is staying the course."

We open on a labor camp in China, in the middle of its vaccination program. One nurse surreptitiously switches needles and injects a woman who promptly falls over and seizes. The nurse insists they take her to a hospital. Again she does something funky with needles in the ambulance.

The authorities back at the labor camp discover the needle switch on surveillance and stop the ambulance at the gates. Authorities open the door and the ambulance is empty.

A different vehicle, a dry cleaning van speeds away. In that van they give the woman a shot of adrenaline and she comes back to life. They tell her she will be in Washington, D.C.by the morning.

Thuggish looking men in Serbia get a call to track the woman down and say they will take care of it. One man says Hezbollah will have to wait because they're going back to Washington.

Tom and Liz talk about the Jolene Parker case. Tom is confused that it's become an investigation. She says there was blood and they have a person of interest. He says she's used to this stuff but it scares him and he asks her to be as careful as she says she is at work. She plants a tracker in his keys and he says they should try the new thai place for dinner.

Liz tells Red that she can tell that Tom feels like something is up. Red says he's just nervous and he's behaving. Liz theorizes Tom killed Jolene. Red confirms this. He says he thinks they worked for the same organization and he was either ordered to kill her or is out of control, paranoid and reactionary and is scrambling for a foothold and this is their opportunity to wait and watch.

But he says he has come not to the Post Office to talk about Tom but the Pavlovich Brothers, number 119-122. They were the extraction team that kidnapped the general's daughter earlier in the season. They worked protective detail for Milosevic during the ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslav wars. Ressler remembers them from the bridge and that they killed six of their men. Liz says they are not politically affiliated, strictly mercenary snatch-and-grabs of political dissidents. They are after the woman from the Chinese labor camp, a Dr. Li who specializes in immunology. She was extracted by the agency because she had signaled a willingness to talk about a secret Chinese bio-weapons program and then was detained. She is landing in D.C. in an hour for a debriefing. Cooper say to re-route her to the Post Office.

She arrives. Liz and Ressler arrive just as she is being ambushed. The Pavlovich Brothers make off with Dr. Li in a helicopter while shooting at Liz and Ressler.

Meera, Ressler, and Liz go back to HQ and here the P Bros dumped the helicopter and Liz is worried they're going to sneak her back out. Meera tells Cooper it's such a big deal because if Dr. Li told the U.S. about their germ warfare program it would be a huge intelligence breach so they need her back but can't make a big deal about it publicly.

Red calls Liz and tells her Tom is not at school. Liz tells the gang she's going to talk to Red about the case but she's going to see him to stakeout Tom. They watch him read on a park bench. She says it's hard sitting there when all she really wants is to choke him. Tom leaves. A woman Red hired, follws him with a stroller as does a skate punk kid. And a guy on a cell phone. Liz notices them. Red says they all work for her. She jumps out of the car and runs across the street and follows as Tom goes into the National Archives. She shows her badge and keeps a tail on him. She sees him and he's about to exchange bags with a man but he notices video cameras and tells the guy, ""not now."" They get pics of the guy leaving.

The P Bros roughly handle Dr. Li into a dank basement space. The inject her wrist with something and she passes out on a dirty mattress but manages to write something on the wall first.

Liz comes home and Tom found her music box. She says her dad gave it to her. He wonders why he hasn't seen it before. She notices his pot is boiling over and thought they were going out for Thai. He says he thought it would be nice to stay home. He mentions stopping by the National Archives to book a field trip for the kids and says he could've sworn he saw her there. She says she was cooped up in the office all day. He says he loves her and leaves to walk the dog, but then doesn't take the dog.

He's out, he breaks his cell phone into pieces. He calls into the home office from a payphone saying ""Mockingbird knows, requesting immediate evac."" He stomps on his keys.

Liz goes to Red and tells him her husband is gone. He says her husband never existed. He says he knows this is emotional for her but for Tom it was just business. She notes they had sex the other night and she feels filthy. Red says she's chest deep in filth and she needs to get used to it. She can't believe that the man she was excited about sharing her life with was a lie and she can't believe she couldn't see it. Red tells her she needs time. She tells him not to tell her to be patient. The office calls, she sighs she needs a lead on the P Bros. She says it's time to go after the chopper they stole.

Red goes to talk to a limo driver who picked up the guy from the National Archives and asks where he dropped the guy.

Red goes to see the guy Jeff Seavers. The package he was going to give to Tom was a Calculus textbook. There is some kind of code written in the book. The man says he knows nothing, he's merely a messenger. He says this was his 4th drop. Red wants all the addresses of the drops. He tells him to return the package to whoever gave it to him and that's it, but they've photocopied all of his IDs. As well as the book.

Aram reports that the chopper did have a wealth of forensic information and find the P Bros staging site.

Red tracks down Tom to one of the drop sites. Dembe wonders how he's going to get him out since Red's normal extraction guy is out of the country.

Liz touches base on Dr. Li. He tries to tell her about Tom but she says they disagree on how to proceed and she's going to do it her way. He wants to talk her out of it, but he can't.

The P. Bros get Dr. Li ready for transport, hooked up to oxygen into a wooden shipping box. After they load he into the van, Red shows up and introduces himself. (He's decided to hire the best extraction team apparently.)

Liz, Ressler and the team arrive but the P. Bros and Dr. Li-- and Red-- are already gone. Ressler notices the writing on the wall. They're not sure what it says.

A man, posing as a vagrant busts open the door to where Tom is hiding and kills a bunch of people guarding where he and his extraction team are. They begin shooting up the building it is the P. Bros, doing a little side job for Red. Tom busts out in a car while the P Bros shoot at him. They try to run him off the road. Instead they box him in and capture him. He gets out with his hands up.

Back at the Post Office they try to decode Dr. Li's message and Liz can't get ahold of Red. Ressler doesn't think it's a coincidence. He thinks Red put them on to it to get to Dr. Li himself for financial gain.

Liz calls Red as she heads home. There she discovers: The P. Bros. They say they have a gift for her from Red. Tom is bound and gagged. They leave the couple alone.

She rails at him for the two wasted years of her life. She wonders if he cares what he's done to her life. She asks what it's done to him. He doesn't talk. She tells him that no prison sentence will make up to her what he did. He says he was doing his job. She yells at him to shut up about that and demands that he say something to his wife, who is dying in front of him, wracked with pain over how he used her. He tells her that it was on their fourth date he knew she was falling in love and from that moment on felt sorry for her. He says part of him didn't want it to work but it did. She's speechless.

Aram decodes the message. It's Archimedes' formula, which tells them that the P. Bros are taking her out of the country by boat.

Ressler calls Liz and tells her that Red used them and he wants her there when they take down the P. Bros.

Liz calls Red to find Dr. Li. He doesn't know where she is but says it's not a cargo operation it's smuggling and has a contact that should help them. Tom taunts her about her relationship with Red and asks if ""Daddy"" is going to make him talk. Nope, says Liz, she is.

Ressler and Meera go to Red's contact.

Liz tries to get Tom to talk. She threatens to cut off his thumb. He says she doesn't have it in her. She promptly breaks his thumb.

Ressler and Meera rescue Dr. Li and take out the P. Bros.

Tom points out t's a tactical error to break the thumb of a person in handcuffs. He slips his chains and they brawl. He forces her to cuff herself to the bannister at gunpoint. Tom says he's one of the good guys and that it is Red that she can't trust and that he is not who she thinks she is. She says she will find him. He tells her to take the key she found in the lamp to a bank and she will find out everything in a safety deposit box. He says goodbye. (Apparently, none of the neighbors called the police.)

Dembe and Red watch him leave and Red says not to stop him. Red has people tail them instead.

Cooper asks Ressler where Keen was today. He wonders if it's Reddington. Ressler says she's having troubles at home.

Red goes into her wrecked apartment, where Liz has busted free from the handcuffs. She tells him she lost him. She is sad that he's gone. Red says no. She realizes Red's people are still following him. She asks him how it's all going to end. Red says this is an end. And then something new will begin. He tells her she deserves the best in life. He says he knows that sounds odd coming from a man who has brought her the worst but he says that's why Tom had to work so hard to pretend to be the best because that's what she deserves and he says it will come.

She goes to the safety deposit box. There is a single orange envelope inside with a single piece of paper. She looks at it and raises her eyebrows."

We open in Prague. A man gets into a car with a driver and he mentions Reddington.The driver announces he's English, which the man in the back thinks is strange. He is offered water by the Englishman and then he promptly keels over. The driver removes his sunglasses and drives off with the man in the back seat.

We cut to that man waking up in a hotel room, half naked in a bed with a young man dead, with strangulation marks on his neck, on the floor next to the bed. The man, a Prague politician, is arrested for murder. The English driver watches the breaking news on the airport TV. The accused man, Emil Dusek,has withdrawn from the senate while he fights the charges.

Red goes to see a fabulously wealthy man in his indoor swimming pool. The rich man is worried about losing Dusek. Red is more concerned about how it happened and thinks it's a frame job by ""The Kingmaker"" to hurt him and this rich man. Red doesn't know who it is, the rich man notes that someone has spent a lot of time to depreciate Red's image. Red doesn't like this. The rich man says his friends are whispering and they might not remain loyal to Red forever. Red relays the message to those friends through this man: ""Shut the hell up.""

Liz looks through the photos she found in the envelope, photos of Red going into the hospital her dad was dying in. She shows them to Ressler and they puzzle it out. Red asks for a meeting.

She meets him and immediately asks where Tom is. Red says he's in New York and he's got his eye on him. In the new place he's staying he's working on a medical marijuana deal and all the types are on the table. A stoned Dembe greets Liz eating ice cream. Red tells her about the Kingmaker and how he's hurting Red's business and image. He explains this guy has been responsible for the rise and fall of major political players through scandal, manipulation, assassination etc. It's said he grooms them from an early age. He gives her the tip on Prague. Liz asks to know Tom's move, Red says to get cracking on the Kingmaker.

We cut to the man who is presumably the Kingmaker, the driver from Prague, he's insisting on a hotel staff clean his room meticulously. Apparently, he's a germaphobe. He looks out the window and his view is of the Chrysler building.

The Kingmaker meets with a middle-aged man named Patrick on a bridge. They are planning some kind of car accident off the bridge that will not kill him but will likely set him on the path to greatness he seeks. The man seems nervous so the Kingmaker hopes he's ready to make the plunge, so to speak or else the man will have an ordinary life.

At the Post Office they narrow down the suspect list and find the Kingmaker and discover he's in New York. They head to his hotel room. Ressler and Liz bust in but it's just a nice couple, he pawned his credit cards.

Alan Alda meets with Red in a nice restaurant. Alan, which is also his character's name, thinks Red is out of his mind. Red says someone is after him and he has to go after him. Alan wonders why Red thinks he'll help him. Red says they have a common enemy and mutually assured destruction thanks to info that Red knows about Alan and his collective. Alan says he doesn't respond well to threats. Red says he's not threatening him but seeing if they can work together.

Patrick kisses his wife and they head out towards the bridge, with their daughter. He claims he's taking this route for scenic purposes. The Kingmaker sets the action in motion and the car plunges off the bridge. He saves his daughter but not his wife.

Red and Liz watch the news and Red thinks the Kingmaker did this to help the Assemblyman get to a higher office. Red tells her to check out the bridge and he bets there are no skidmarks. At the Post Office they look into Patrick's life. They're confused that a politician who isn't even running for anything would murder his wife. Liz says husbands lie all the time and can believe it. Ressler notices her attitude.

Aram shows Liz surveillance of Red going into the hospital one hour before her father died.

As they head over, Ressler asks if she and Tom are having problems. She says they had a fight and he left the house and she doesn't know where he is.

They look at the bridge and Red is right, no skidmarks from either car, Patrick's or the oncoming car. Liz says the accident did work, the guy is everywhere on TV, he's a hero. They go and question the guy. He says he and his daughter are traumatized by his wife's death. They ask more questions and he says he's not ready to talk about all this and goes to be with his daughter.

Ressler gets a call about the van that ran Patrick off the road.

The Kingmaker comes to see the van driver and is mad he didn't stay, it was supposed to look like an accident and now the police are looking for him. The van driver says he lied, there wasn't supposed to be anyone else in the car. The Kingmaker kills the van driver.

Alan goes to speak with the members of his collective and they want to know what Red wants. He says he wants his help. He says Red's enemy seems not to want to kill him but ruin his life and eventually kill him, wherein lies the problem. Whatever he's holding over the heads of the collective will automatically go public if Red dies, he's got a protocol in place. The other members of the collective, which appears to number about 10 and have international membership, are worried. Alan says he might need to help him. There is division and they put it to a vote.

Ressler finds the van. And then he finds the man. The Kingmaker made it look like a suicide.

Patrick goes to see the Kingmaker. He's very sad his wife is dead. The Kingmaker says this just makes him seem heroic. He says he's sorry but Patrick needs to see it to his advantage because he's not only a hero but the public will mourn with him. Patrick tells him about the FBI and wants to stop. The Kingmaker says no they must capitalize on the moment.

The gang at the Post Office runs down calls the dead man got from a phone booth. Red and Liz go to the phone booth which is across from a pawn shop, which is a front for an elaborate, fancy private club, cigar club. Red points out people in the club who are bad men. He lights a cigar. She notes her father died of lung cancer. He apologizes. He admits he knew her father. She confronts him about being in Nebraska visiting her dad. She said he didn't mention it and is confused and says her father never mentioned Red. She asks how they knew each other and why he was there. Red says he went to say goodbye. The owner comes by their table. They show him in the Kingmaker's picture and he says he was there for dinner and gives the his hotel name.

Liz and Ressler busts into the hotel room. No one is there but they do find some elaborate computer machinery hidden in the walls. They pull the stuff out and there are photos and schematics and alarm codes on the computers. It is the house of a U.S. Senator Albert Mitchell, they deduce the Kingmaker is going to kill him and Patrick will run in the special election to replace him thus, launching his brilliant career. They've been planning it since 2007.

They go to protect the senator but someone's already broken in. The senator tells his wife to lock herself in the bathroom and heads downstairs with a gun. The Kingmaker easily overpowers him. The senator tries to plead with him and then Kingmaker starts supervillain monologuing about what the murder is going to look like in the press. The senator says he'll do whatever he wants. The Kingmaker says he wants him to resign his senate seat. The Senator says he will. The Kingmaker doesn't trust him and shoots him just as Ressler and Liz arrive. He and Liz tussle and he starts to choke her, and Ressler shoots him in the head.

Alan comes to see Red and says he was told not to come here but he did but he says they're out and they can do their own risk assessment. Alan says he was willing to go to bat for him but others who just wanted to kill Red outright and called his bluff about his evidence against them. Red says that would be a mistake and he will win this war with his enemy even without his and his collective's help. Red says this will ensure when the day finally comes when Red settles up with Alan's alliance, it will be Alan alone in the dark.

Liz calls Red with the news that the Kingmaker is dead. Red is mad he can't talk to him and find out about the situation in Prague which is why he brought her the case in the first place.

Liz and Ressler arrest Patrick Chandler for conspiracy.

Aram calls Liz and tells her that her father didn't die at 5:30 when she thought, but at 4:30 when Red was actually in the room. Liz goes to see Red. He's about to give her an update on Tom when she asks if he killed her father. Red admits he did. Liz says she was right, there was something her father wanted to tell her and Red didn't want her to know. She flips out, he tries to do more justifying saying he was friends with Sam for all of her and most of his own life and says that her father was in pain and suffering and asked to be disconnected from all of the machines. He says he wasn't thinking clearly because if he was he wouldn't have chosen to tell Liz anything because it wasn't his choice to make. He says they said goodbye and Red put him out of his misery. Liz is not having it saying they're done and he's a monster.

She goes home, which is still a mess from the throwdown with Tom. She cries as she surveys the wreckage and takes off her wedding ring.

Red drinks and plays solitaire.

Ressler drinks and reads the paper. Liz goes to see him. She says she didn't know where else to go."

A man coughs incessantly and sees blood come out. He puts off his wife who wants to kiss him goodbye. He says he doesn't want her to catch what he has.

He's an armored truck worker and as he heads to work continues coughing up blood. He looks at a syringe in his jacket. He enters a bank to do his rounds but collapses. He calls 911, asks if the call is being recorded, and sends a message to his wife. He then dies. The people in the bank are freaking. But when it's determined what he had may have been contagious everyone is put on quarantine lockdown.

We learn that we are after ""Berlin"" which/who is number 8.

Liz brings Ressler to her house and tells the story and she says she's going to find him and take him apart piece by piece and find out what happened. He says he'll help, but first she has to tell the FBI.

She does and is questioned, explaining everything she knows from the day she met him and saying she doesn't know where he is. They comb through her apartment and her storage facility HQ where Cooper looks at the charred paper reading ""Berlin."" She says she believes that he was inserted into her life to get to Red and his mission was gathering intelligence. She says two of his three known associates are dead and she discovers, during the questioning, that the third, a woman named Gina, busted out of prison two weeks ago.

Tom runs down the guy that Red has tailing him and has him phone Red telling him he lost the tail. The guy tries to bargain his way out of death by saying he could work for the people Tom works for but Tom says ""You don't choose Berlin, Berlin chooses you."" He kills the guy, and for good measure, cuts off the man's distinctive spider tattoo.

Liz tries to hand in her resignation to Cooper -- refusing to speak to Red who is in Cooper's office. Cooper tries to argue her out of it and says he trusts she had nothing to do with Tom but the Bureau might not but they do know how valuable she is because she's willing to speak to Red and that's no longer the case. Red keeps trying to tell her he has a case and it's related to Tom and an attack is imminent but she doesn't care and tells Cooper that Red killed her dad. Red asks if she will really put her own anger above the lives of innocent people in danger. She agrees to work this case but then wants a transfer.

The case basically is: there is a grand conspiracy to bring down Red and the task force. It starts with the armored car worker, who Red says is but a pawn in a biological attack and fear is a good weapon for control. The man died of a very rare and incredibly contagious virus that could cause a global pandemic. It's so bad that scientists have been ordered to no longer work on it and the only known research strains are under lock and key.

As Red explains the elaborate plan, we see a man in a lab don gloves and fill syringes with an amber liquid like the armored car guy had.

A CDC researcher at the scene of the bank quarantine tells Liz and Ressler that this strain of the virus was intentionally mutated to contain itself in its host, which is incredibly advanced science and anyone doing it is doing it in isolation and for no good purpose.

On the plane ride to see the foremost expert in this virus Red tries to convince Liz to stay on the task force. He also gives her a copy of Tom's codebook which doesn't have much about Red in it but plenty about Liz and their cases. She takes it from him and gets up and asks Dembe to trade seats with her so she doesn't have to sit with Red.

Ressler and the Post Office gang learn that the syringe had a heretofore unknown antidote to the virus in it and learn that the armored car guy was being blackmailed by someone to do a job on the 30th, which is the next day. They realize the guy chose to die instead of following orders so it must be big and they know Berlin will need a replacement. We cut to the other armored car truck driver who is now sick. He gets home and a note on his computer says to play a video. On it a man tells him he has been infected by the virus, he also has been given enough of the antidote in a syringe to stay upright to finish whatever the job is. Once he does that and if he's still alive he will get enough to cure him.

Red and Liz meet with Dr. Sanders an old acquaintance of Red's. It turns out that he's in the loony bin. But that doesn't mean he still isn't a genius. When he starts babbling about ""Space Agent UD-4126"" though Liz has heard enough and thinks that Red has wasted their time and he just wanted to get her alone to change her mind. She wonders if he's ever had a selfless moment in his life. She leaves and says she's flying home coach.

Cooper meets with the big boss and says if Liz walks Red's deal is off and Red will likely be thrown in a hole forever. As for Liz he thinks they've been overly indulgent. Cooper sticks up for Liz and the boss notes that Cooper's job is also in jeopardy.

Turns out there was information in that babble. Back at the Post Office Ressler and Meera ask about Liz's transfer. She apologizes but they both say they support her. They tell her about the antidote and it was Dr. Sanders who created and must be working with someone on the outside with a lab.

So Liz has to go ask Red for help. He shows her the ripped off neck tattoo that Tom sent him.

They go to see Dr. Sanders again and he gets agitated. But she notices the nurse's badge and gets a lightbulb: UD-4126 must be an ID badge number.

They run it through the system and turn up a Dr. from CDC, a Dr. Vogel. They bust into his house, find his lab, and nab him. They bring him in and he won't talk, until Liz infects him with his own virus in his drinking water and holds the antidote out as bait to get him to talk. They want the names of the people he infected and what the job is. She tells him to let her know when he's ready to talk.

While she waits, back at home, Liz looks over all the cases they've done with Red and Tom's code book and sees connections between them and realizes that they all somehow trace back to Berlin, who she realizes is not a place but a person and Red used them not to expand his empire but help protect him. She says that person is coming for him today.

As she says this we see a man in a hood escorted by some other men through a building to the outside.

The evil doctor gives them the names of the five people infected. The gang connects the dots to an airport.

Liz realizes the boss has already made a decision and runs off to warn Red and get him to safety before the FBI can grab him.

Onboard a plane, the hooded figure is about to touch down in D.C.-- thanks to the five infected people who smoothed his passage including a pilot and an air traffic controller-- when the gang roars up guns blazing and blows it. The plane is warned by people on the ground to abort and before it touches down flies off again, Berlin onboard.

Military jets are scrambled from an aircraft carrier and they shoot at the plane, hitting it.

The FBI is closing in on Red and Liz in the park but he refuses to make a run for it and instead calmly sits and asks her to explain her change of heart. She refuses to give him the satisfaction of telling him he's right but tries to convince him to go. He asks what they're going to do to him? Kill him? He says none of this is worse than losing her. He tells her to go. She says she won't be tricked into forgiving him for killing her dad and he has ruined her life and she wants to kill him but she needs answers from him. He says he needs things from her too. She says they are stuck with each other. He monologues about a near death experience and then he surrenders. The now smoking plane flies over their heads in the park on its way to crashing. Red says ""Now it begins."""

We pick up at the site of the plane crash. It is a burning wreckage but some passengers managed to survive and walk away. Others were not so lucky.

Matt Lauer reports on the plane crash on the Toda sho.

Some of the survivors are rounded up by the gang and explain how they saw ""a man"" shoot the pilot. They say the man then cut a man's hand off. Said man collapses in a hospital, sans one hand.

Red is escorted into a cell in a black site in New York City and is told there will be no trial, he will simply disappear. The main FBI guy asks if Liz was worth all this? Red answers yes.

Cooper arrives at the Post Office and Liz asks him to help with Red. He says there's nothing they can do. They brief Cooper on the crash, survivors, and that the flight was flying undetected. They ask the survivors about Berlin. They don't know anything about that. They say a man in a hood was cuffed to another guy, a guard, and the guy in the hood was telling the pilot what to do like he was in charge. They say there were several nationalities on board: a Chechen mobster and a Colombian drug dealer, a Serbian. They say there was definitely a Russian. They say they were all kidnapped.

We cut to a man doing pull-ups watching the news about the crash. Three prisoners from the crash are still at large. There is a knock on the door and it's Tom. He's wearing a hood. He asks the pull-ups guy what happened. The guy simply asks for ""the list."" Tom hands him a piece of paper with the name of the entire Blacklist team on it: Liz, Ressler, Cooper, Meera, Aram. Tom asks if they're still ""moving forward."" The guy smiles.

Liz asks the head FBI guy to see Red. He says no. She says he can help.

The head FBI goes to Red in his cage and says he has a visitor. It is not Liz, it is Alan.

Alan says he's concerned since he's in the intelligence business and they can't a bead on anything about that plane and wonders if it's connected to Red's ""adversary."" Red says if he had accepted his offer of alliance before then none of this would've happened. Alan says he folks decided and he disagreed. He says he can't let Red out but he has arranged for a transfer. Red says he'll take care of the rest. Alan says every time they talk he wonders if it will be the last but he usually squeaks out. This time he's not so sure, now that his task force are all targets.

Red gets in the guarded SUV with the head of the FBI who says he hopes he's killed in the attempt. Red knocks him out and strangles the driver. The car crashes. He escapes. He calls Liz and says everyone on the task force is a target and to pull everyone back because they are all in danger. Liz wants Meera and Ressler pulled back.

Alas, Meera and Ressler are at a dance club looking for one of the suspects. Ressler tries to talk to some Russian thugs. One of them runs. Ressler chases him down. Meera follows another potential suspect and has her throat slit for her troubles. She bleeds out on the floor of the club. Liz runs in and finds her.

Dembe and Red listen to the news. Liz bursts in with the news of Meera. She asks why they're targets. He says the work the task force has done has forced Berlin out of the shadows to stop their work. He says by association he got her killed. Liz says it was Tom who gave Berlin the list and that Sam's name was also on the list and wants to know why. Red says Sam's only role in this was as her father and she needs to focus on the task at hand. Whoever crashed that plane wanted the others on it as well and she needs to find out who would've wanted that.

We go back and talk to the prisoners including the one that Ressler caught at the club. He tries to threaten it out of the Russian. He says he was caught in Venezuela and there were others on the plane already when he got there and he doesn't know anything else. They think he was being stolen back by Russia. Cooper tells Ressler to get Red involved and see if he can help. Red goes to see the Russian ambassador. He brought peaches. The ambassador is angry. Red asks about the plane. The ambassador says he knows nothing about it. Red wants the manifest of the plane and throws a knife into the man's leg. The ambassador gives up the list.

The gang looks over the list. There were 10 prisoners. Three are in custody and four confirmed dead -- one is burned unrecognizably-- so there are three at large. They figure one of them is Berlin. They go to talk to the guard whose hand was cut off.

The guard gives them no information on three men and says they don't know who they're dealing with, even he doesn't know he says, all he knows is ""the story."" The story is: They say he started in the Red Army and then joined the KGB and sent his enemies to Siberian work camps. Near the end of the Cold War his daughter fell in love with a dissident and she was jailed and he arranged for her to escape, and when the Kremlin found out they sent him to Siberia to be dealt with by his enemies. He prayed in prison that his daughter was safe and one day in the mail he received a pocketwatch he had given her. Inside there was a picture. And then a few months later he received her ear in the mail. And then a finger and a rib. His enemies sent his daughter back to him piece by piece. It is said he fashioned a knife out of one of her bones and escaped from prison mad with vengeance for those responsible for his daughter's death. He says the man they're looking for, was never on the manifest.

Cooper meets with the head Fed in a public park and Cooper accuses him of letting Red get away and is now confused that he wants him back. The main guy says he doesn't want him free, ""people"" do and to just get him back. Cooper is confused. He heads back to his car and is promptly choked by a man in the back seat. Another man on a nearby park bench scratches Cooper's name off the list.

Back to chat with the prisoners who are all claiming they had nothing to do with it and to speak to the man in the hoodie. Ressler talks to one of them and is very threatening and says he's not a boy scout anymore and he's ready to break all the rules. He starts choking the Russian by his tie.

I guess the guy talked because Red meets with Alan and has a picture and name now for Berlin: Kinsky, a Russian national and former commando and Alan looks at his file and says he makes Putin look like a Christmas elf. Alan wonders now that they know who he is, how Red pissed him off. Red basically admits he doesn't know and he thinks Alan can find out with his special ""access"" to surveillance. He says if Alan finds him, Red will do the rest.

Liz gets into a car with Red and says they don't know if Cooper is going to make it through the night. She again asks how Sam was involved. Red says the way that Sam told the story was that one night an old friend showed up at his door scared. He had a little girl with him. He said he was in danger and had to leave town. He said the little girl's father died in a fire and asked Sam to take care of her and never tell her who her real father was. Liz says the only memory she has of her real dad is him pulling her from the flames the night of the fire. Red says Sam was his good friend and he didn't kill him because he's evil, he killed him because his friend was in pain and wanted to die and he had to protect her from the truth. Red says it was the hardest thing he's ever done. He says after all they went through to protect her from the identity of her real father, he's not going to tell her now because it would put her in danger. She asks why. He does not tell her. Red gets a call. Alan has found him and gives him an address. Red lies to Liz and says they have to keep looking.

He goes on his own to the address and mows down a series of armed guards with a gun with a silencer. He has Berlin in his sights.

We cut to Cooper unconscious in the hospital. Ressler says is on the phone saying there was an 11th prisoner on the plane and get people to go out and look. Liz sets at his bedside fretting that this is all her fault.

Red tapes up Berlin to a chair as he regales him with tales of being great at finding people. He monologues for awhile about how great his memory is for remembering people and then says he has no idea who he is and what he's done to him and none of the people who have come after him have like Berlin did. He clearly wants to know how he found him. Berlin says after years of searching, he finally found Red's weakness: ""her."" On ""her,"" Red twitches. He said it seems implausible that someone as precise as Red could be so careless so he exploited the weakness and here they are, thanks to Elizabeth Keen.

We cut to Liz in her car. She is snuck up on by Tom who gets in the car and pulls a gun on her and says ""Hi, babe.""

Red asks who this guy is exactly is and what Red did to him. The guy spits at hm. Red dabs his face and then shoots Berlin in the hand. Berlin screams and hisses. Red says to tell him his story because he's not leaving without one. Berlin gives him nothing. So Red shoots him in the hip. He asks him again what he did to him. He threatens to shoot him in the kneecap. Berlin says: ""Beirut, 2010."" Tom come in with gun trained on Liz. Tom tells Red to drop the gun and he says no. Red asks if she's hurt. She shakes her head no. Berlin yells at Tom to kill Liz and rants that Red stole his life for money, business. Red shoots Berlin dead and says that simplifies matters since it's now just the three of them. Red puts his gun down and says he is the one Tom wants, not Liz. Tom shoots Red who stumbles back. Tom and Liz fight for his gun. Liz shoots him. Red wants to make sure he's dead. Liz tells Red it's personal and she will finish it. She drops to her knees and holds his wound. He says ""I'm sorry."" He whispers something and dies. She looks stricken.

Matt Lauer reports all the prisoners have been captured.

We cut back to the prisoners in custody telling Ressler they know nothing and want to know how long they'll be held. Ressler says indefinitely.

Liz looks at a picture of Meera and her two kids: 8 and 5. Ressler asks for a Cooper update. She shakes her head. Aram enters and says the coroner ID'ed the John Doe and it was a guard. They say all the guards were accounted for. Aram has an epiphany. They all flash back to the prisoners saying: ""He cut his hand off."" He calls it a lexical ambiguity: Berlin cut his own hand off. They rush to the hospital, he is gone having killed someone along the way.

Liz goes to Red who says he knows that he didn't kill Berlin. The guy was talking about Beirut and he knows his problems with Berlin started much earlier so he just killed him. If Berlin thinks Red thinks he is dead, it gives them room to maneuver. Liz says she's sure Red will find him. Red says he wants her to understand something about her father. He says the night he took Liz in, he altered the course of his life. He says Liz is at a similar crossroads. If she turns from it, Red says he will go away or she can engage with the problem and maybe prevail and rise above it. (And work with him, goes unspoken.) She smiles a tight silent smile. He says he understands and will be on a plane tonight.

Back at her old apartment,now empty, Liz looks at old photos of her dad. She looks around the apartment one last time, bags in hand and walks out the front door.

Ressler sits by Cooper's side in the hospital. He sees Coopers hand move and gets the doctor.

Agents go into the room here fake Berlin was shot and see the place where Tom's body should be lying, based on the blood on the wall. There is no body there.

The real Berlin shaves his bushy beard. He looks at the pocket watch with his daughter's picture. His hand is bandaged.

Red and Dembe are putting his bags in the car. Liz drives up in a cab. They share a meaningful glance. She tells him that Tom told her something right before he died: your father is alive. Red says her father is dead, he died in the fire. She says Berlin is out there. Red says yes and they'll find him.

We cut to Berlin walking down a street, again looking at his pocket watch.

We see Red look at a picture, the same picture, it seems that is in Berlin's watch. He takes off his shirt and tends to his bullet wound. We see his back is covered in burn marks."

Danny, his brother, solves the kidnapping of a diabetic nine-year-old. The FBI wants Jamie to spy on the Blue Templar, a police secret society.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Michael Cuesta'],"['', '']",[],"['abducted child', 'police', 'police detective', 'police commissioner', 'family relationships', 'undercover', 'bully', 'abuse']",[],"After opening scenes of New York City, Police Commissioner Frank Reagan and retired Police Commissioner Henry Reagan are getting ready. Frank tells Henry, his father, to be ready in 10 minutes. Henry replies that he's never been late. Erin Reagan-Boyle and her daughter, Nicky, are also shown getting ready when Nicky announces that she can't find her iPod. Her mother tells her it's on the kitchen counter and that she needs to change the skirt she is wearing. Danny Reagan and his wife, Linda, are also shown getting ready with her reminding how busy traffic can be. Frank is shown again in his full police commissioner uniform and, as he puts on his watch, he looks at pictures of himself and his family. He looks at a picture of his son, Joe, and a picture of his son, Jamie, at his college graduation. Jamie is shown marching out with his fellow graduates from police academy with a big smile on his face as his family looks on. Commissoner Reagan makes a speech to the graduates about keeping the city safe from crime and terrorism. As he is giving his speech, a young girl is kidnapped as she leaves school and taken away in a white van. Commissoner Reagan finishes his speech and declares the class has graduated among cheers from the crowd.

The family gathers outside Madison Square Garden along with Jamie's girlfriend, Sydney Davenport, to congratulate Jamie on his graduation which includes Danny giving him a playful jab as he decided to become a cop rather than finish law school. Jamie introduces Frank to Officer Maria Romano who was the first female recruit to earn a sharpshooter medal in the academy. Frank suggests that everyone should head over to lunch, but Sydney excuses herself as she has to return to work and Danny excuses himself as he gets a phone call about a missing girl. Danny and his partner, Demarcus King, arrive at the scene where they are briefed on the case. Teresa Campos, a 9 year old girl, did not return home from school and a building superintendent had told the police that he saw two boys find a pink backpack which belonged to Teresa. The only piece of evidence found at the scene of the crime was a doll. Teresa's mother claimed that she had never seen the doll before. Danny issues an Amber alert and has surveillance cameras around the area checked, but to do it discreetly. Danny interviews Teresa's parents. Teresa's father declares that her daughter is a good girl, that she would always come home and not worry her mother. Danny asks if Teresa may have run away, if a fight had happened, or an ex-husband may have taken Teresa. The parents deny this. An officer tells Danny about an eyewitness who saw a white van drive away from the scene and that it had a cracked rear window. Danny alerts the bridges and tunnel security. Danny and Demarcus rule out a custody dispute and a ransom case when Demarcus lets Danny know that Teresa is also a diabetic and she needs insulin shots every 24 hours. Teresa's mother begs Danny to find her daughter.

At a press conference, Frank assures the press that the NYPD that they will be doing all they can to find Teresa. The press changes the conference asking about less police on the Upper East Side in a previous case and that there is a lack of faith in the police among Latinos. Frank answers the question that, since he has been on the job, crime is down and sets the conference back on course by stressing that finding Teresa is the priority. As the case progresses, Danny finds that there are 16 registered sex offenders near Teresa's house and that a tip on the white van came up empty. In Frank's office, Mayor Frank Russo appears and stresses that finding Teresa alive should be the priority and that Danny is the lead detective on the case. Mayor Russo suggests that if the case goes south that a lot of scrutiny could take place. He also scolds Frank for his attitude at the press conference to which Frank responds with nothing.

Frank calls Danny reminding him that, since he is busy with the case, he wouldn't be able to pick up a roast for Sunday dinner. Danny asks if he is calling as a reminder or asking for an update. Frank smiles, and declares that he is faithful that he has all the resources necessary to work the case. Demarcus rules out Teresa's uncle because he has been locked up in Rikers Island. Danny then realizes that the doll needs to be reanalyzed even though no fingerprints or DNA was found on it. Demarcus deduces that the kidnapper wore gloves and used the doll as bait and the doll may have belonged to somebody else. Danny tries to figure out who manufactured the doll and where it was sold to gather more clues. Danny finds out that the doll is a prototype and only three dolls were ever made. Danny gets the names and address of the people who had access to the doll.

Danny approaches the residence of Oliver Peele who is a doll collector. Danny asks Oliver his whereabouts during the kidnapping. Oliver claims he was at his home, but since he has one of the remaining prototypes, he has an alibi. Another doll belonged to a UN delegate in Shanghai, China, who still has his prototype of the doll. Danny rules Oliver out as a suspect but then gets a phone call about a toy salesman named Donald Banse. Although he has a Florida drivers license, his wife has a New York license and address close by.

Jamie and his partner, Sgt. Anthony Renzulli, are shown finishing up lunch in a diner. Anthony tells Jamie that he was Joe's training officer as well. He remembers that Joe was a good guy and it was sad that he had died on duty. Anthony also reminds Jamie that, just because his father is the police commissioner, he won't be getting any slack from him. As they walk out of the diner, they get a distress call. Danny and Demarcus arrive at the location and they find Mildred Banse taking out the trash. As they question her, she claims that she is divorcing Donald and the last she made any contact with him was sending him his things at The Lincoln Arms hotel. Danny and Demarcus pull up behind a blue van. Danny scratches the paint off the van to show that it was once white. Danny then breaks the rear window to open the van and finds a communion dress and votive candles. They head into the hotel and, when they question Donald, he claims that he was going to visit his niece and that the doll he dropped was going to be a gift. Danny goes to arrest Donald and when Demarcus says to take him downtown, Donald claims that he would be released. Danny gets too rough and tries to get a confession out of Donald by shoving his head into a toilet. Danny found a key to a storage locker and, when he opens it, he finds Teresa in it with tape over her mouth. He carries Teresa over to an ambulance and they take her to a hospital. Danny and Demarcus start to claim victory, but Donald claims police brutality.

In a meeting with Judge Waters, Erin, and Public Defender Adelman, Adelman declares that he will be filing a Huntley motion under the grounds of excessive force and he provides photographs of Donald's injuries. Erin defends that Donald was resisting arrest. Adelman recommends that, because the evidence is inadmissible, he recommends that the case is dismissed. Erin defends that Donald confessed. Judge Waters agrees that the crime is heinous, but without a legal confession and legal evidence, the law has to be upheld. Erin asks for more time. The judge agrees that Donald shouldn't be on the street and rules that, unless Erin can get proper evidence to indict, she would have to let Donald go. Erin then scolds Danny for trashing all the evidence even though Danny claims that CSI is further combing the van and saving Teresa's life.

Danny arrives at Frank's house with the roast and they discuss the case. Danny discloses that CSI couldn't find any DNA or hair fibers. Frank reminds Danny that Internal Affairs is going to have to become involved in the case. Danny defends Demarcus saying that he had nothing to do with it. Frank suggest that Danny should search cold cases to see if there are any similarities. Frank asks Danny if he has seen a doctor about what happened during Danny's tours in the military. Danny says that he has been busy, but he'll get around to it.

Jamie and Sydney are out on a date with friends and, when asked about his day, Jamie announces that a guy had pushed a boy down a flight of stairs who ended up getting paralyzed. Sydney has to excuse herself from the table and Jamie follows her. Sydney is worried that something bad is going to happen just like his brother, Joe, but Jamie assures her that everything is going to be all right. As they head back into the restaurant, Jamie sees Frank escorting and giving a kiss to a reporter from the press conference in a taxi. Danny is continuing the case and finds a cold case about a Catholic girl in Florida that had gone missing, but her body had never been found. It was also around the time that Donald was living in Florida. Danny calls down to Florida to try and tie the cases together.

The family gathers together for Sunday dinner. As the food gets passed around and grace is said, the family starts talking about the case with Erin and Danny yelling at each from across the table. Frank tries to keep the peace and the topic of torture and enhanced interrogations are brought up. Jamie takes sides with Erin, but Danny reminds him that he is a rookie and he should wait until the day where he has to make a quick decision. Danny gets a phone call saying that the evidence from Florida has come in and he has to excuse himself from the table. Before he leaves, he asks Erin how the case would be different if Nicky was the one involved. Henry makes a rude remark that Nicky would be given back in ten minutes which causes Nicky to be offended and the table gets cleared with only Frank, Jamie, and Henry left at the table. Frank comforts his daughter after having a bad week. Frank asks Jamie about Officer Romano being a babe. Jamie says that she is a good friend. Jamie asks if Frank has any friends in his life, but he tells him that he misses his wife.

As Jamie is walking down the sidewalk, he is approached by Special Agent Cisco and Agent Anderson. They show him a badge from a group called The Blue Templar. Jamie believes that The Blue Templar is a fairy tale and that it doesn't exist. Henry would tell stories to Jamie when he was a child, but that was all that it was, stories. The agents have linked them to serious crimes as extortion, stealing evidence, and murder for hire. Jamie asks if Frank knows about this. When the agents refuse to answer, Jamie questions them. Agent Cisco says that he doesn't know how high up the ladder this goes. Jamie goes to leave after Cisco suggests being a mole. Agent Anderson then plays a recording of Joe saying that he was ready to be wired up. Joe was working with the agents to expose The Blue Templar, but died when he was revealed as a mole.

The Campos family arrives at the police station to thank Danny for saving her life. After Danny takes another look at a newspaper clipping of the missing girl in Florida, he notices that the cross the girl was wearing in the photo was the same cross that Mildred was wearing. Danny takes the evidence to Erin and she makes a phone call to have Donald extradited to Florida for which solves the cold case in Florida. Danny claims victory, but is reminded that he still may need a lawyer because of his actions with Donald. Danny thanks his sister and leaves. Jamie meets up with Frank who is fishing on a pier and Frank confesses that he is seeing someone and that he hates keeping secrets. Frank asks Jamie if he is having second thoughts about being a police officer which Jamie denies."

One of the members takes out a cell phone and starts filming. The leader pulls out a gun and the gang starts robbing the passengers. Among the chaos on the train, three gunshots ring out as the train continues along the track. At the Reagan home, Danny is having trouble putting together a model car with Henry assisting him. Henry jokes that Linda could put the car together. Danny calls out to Frank for help, but Frank lets Danny know that a degree in mechanical engineering is needed to construct the car. Erin enters after sending Nikki on a trip to visit her father and Jamie appears to assist Danny in assembling the car as well. Frank talks with Erin saying that, if he was going through a divorce and sending his daughter away on a long trip, he wouldn't be fine with it. Frank gets a phone call along with Danny. Jamie announces that he has a midnight shift leaving Henry alone with the model car.

Danny arrives at the subway station where he meets his partner, Detective Ava Hotchkiss, which is now a crime scene. The street gang had fled after the train had been stopped by passengers pulling the emergency cord. Danny looks at the blood stains which lead to the tracks suggesting the gang escaped through the tunnels. Danny returns to the street to find Jamie and Sgt. Anthony Renzulli drive by. Sgt. Renzulli admits that he wanted to show Jamie what detectives do at a crime scene. Jamie asks them to take him to another station to check for more clues. Danny asks Sgt. Renzulli how Jamie is doing on the job and they trade jabs. When they arrive, they find the subway hatch popped and a blood trail. Danny follows the trail to somebody sitting on a bench. As Danny orders the person to put their hands up, they find that this person has died from a gunshot wound and was left behind. Jamie shows a look of shock.

Commissioner Frank Reagan is being led to his office by his assistant, Detective Abigail Baker, where he meets Chief Mike Jeffords from Brooklyn South to discuss the train robbery. They discuss the case with the deceased being identified as Lee Cranston. Chief Jeffords suggests that Cranston was a new recruit to the gang and probably did something wrong which caused him to be shot. Frank suggests a better theory: that the shooting was an accident. Two witnesses identified the leader of the gang as ""Handsome"" Steven Jackson. Chief Jeffords shows that Jackson has a record and that he enjoys the violence and uses the camera as a rush. Commissioner Reagan orders that more police need to be put on trains as a security countermeasure. Danny arrives at work where Detective Hotchkiss and others are interviewing witnesses. Danny finds a witness named Denise, who is Lee's cousin. Denise tells Danny that she knows of Handsome's antics and that everybody is afraid to ride the trains at night. Danny suspects that Handsome shot Lee, and even if he didn't, he left him there to die. Denise starts to cry and asks to leave. Danny allows it and tells her that, when she's ready to talk, Danny will listen.

Jamie meets up with Erin, buys her a cup of coffee and tells her that he saw his first dead body the night before. Erin wonders if everything is all right and Jamie says everything is all right with him and his girlfriend, Sydney. Danny and Ana are giving their boss, Sgt. Sid Gormley, an update on the case. Danny announces that the medical examiner had pulled a .38 mm bullet out of Lee, but Handsome had a 9 mm gun during the robbery. It is suggested that Lee could have accidentally shot himself in the stomach with a different gun. Sgt. Gormley questions this with Ana stating that half of the victims were face down on the floor of the train and not looking at the gang members. Danny suggests that one of the other gang members had the gun or one of the victims had the gun. Sgt. Gormley says that's a lot of maybes in the case. Detective Baker showed Commissioner Reagan the video that was filmed which had been posted on the internet. Ana is interviewing another eyewitness who claims that she saw the man who pulled out a gun and started shooting. Danny shows her the video and she identifies a passenger as the man who shot Lee. The man is identified as a good Samaritan shooter. Chief Jeffords and Commissioner Reagan focus on the good Samaritan and Frank deduces that it is the man's instinct to protect the witness and that he has a family and job. Frank orders that the man's picture gets released to the press and suggests to shut down the website.

As the case continues, Sgt. Gormley shows Danny and Ana that the good Samaritan has been identified as Oliver Young and that he has surrendered himself in the 65th precinct. Reporter Kelly Davidson had earned herself an exclusive interview with Oliver. Oliver declares that he was scared during the incident, but he felt what he did was the right thing to do. Frank watches the interview and immediately calls Kelly. Danny and Ana interview Oliver about the incident on the train. Oliver says that he was working with drywall and he had been previously robbed on the train. The gun that he had was for protection because he carried money that he had earned from working. Oliver had no intention of shooting Lee, but when things started to escalate he had to do something about it. Oliver also declares that he had a prior robbery arrest when he was 18 years old, but he had lived a proper life until the night of the shooting. Oliver was so filled with guilt that he had to confess and he didn't want to be dragged away from his family. Danny asks Oliver why confess to Kelly and not to the police. Danny deduces that Oliver felt that the police would not treat him fairly.

Ana claims victory on the shooting part of the case saying that Oliver's confession is enough to close that portion of the case. Sgt. Gormley assigns Danny to capture Handsome and to do it by the book which Danny agrees to. Denise shows up again and tells him that Lee didn't want to join Handsome's gang, but he was pressured into it by his friend Dante Vantos. Denise admits that she and Dante used to hang out and she gives up information on where the gang hangs out. Danny arrives with Ana and two officers at an apartment where the gang is having a party. The gang is arrested, but Handsome is nowhere to be found.

Dante is questioned by Danny and Ana and claims that, even if he knows where Handsome is, he wouldn't give him up because of loyalty. Dante asks for his lawyer which ends the questioning. At Sunday dinner, Henry brings up the conversation of people being allowed to carry a gun then the gang would have had a second thought before robbing a train. Erin reminds him that, if more people carried guns, more people would get hurt. Henry defends the law the saying that the reason he had the gun was to stop the robbery. Frank reminds him that nobody can choose what laws are enforced. Danny asks Erin if the defending lawyer is a tough lawyer which Erin concedes to. After dinner, Danny asks Erin if there were any mistakes in the prosecution's case. Erin claims that it's collusion, but Danny claims that it was an act of mercy. Frank agrees with his daughter and then reminds him that Handsome is still at large. Danny admits that is true, but it is now a Major Crimes case of which he is part of. Frank asks Danny how that is going and Danny admits that after the Campos case (from Episode 1 ""Pilot) and the Internal Affairs investigation, he thought he would be assigned to the motor pool. Frank claims that interfering would've been received as favoritism. Frank also admits that he did want Danny in the motor pool, but deferred to his chief of detectives who claimed that Danny would bring something to the case.

Handsome sends out another video aimed at Kelly. Handsome is very arrogant in the video and claims that he is going to rob another train and this time nobody from his crew is going to be killed and that some exclusive footage is going to be sent out. The police ask for a copy of the footage, but Frank pleads that the footage is not broadcast. Kelly agrees under the condition that she gets the exclusive footage of the arrest. Frank declines her request saying that it would jeopardize the safety of police officers. Kelly leaves behind a flash drive with a prerecorded exclusive story. Frank orders more police officers to patrol the trains until Handsome is arrested.

Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli are out on patrol and he asks him what he sees on the street. Jamie shows off his skills by noticing broken glass on the sidewalk from a probable car theft. Jamie asks Sgt. Renzulli what he has against Danny. Sgt. Renzulli tells Jamie that Danny had done 3 things that a detective should never do: Leave his partner, not tell them where he was going, or call in the evidence. He praises him, but says that he has bad habits. Frank meets Erin at the courthouse as she is leaving to meet friends for drinks. Erin would rather go out than return to an empty apartment. Frank presents Erin with a letter that she had written when she was eleven years old and ran away to Henry's house. Erin understands that if a storm was weathered back then, the same would happen now. Erin thanks her father and gives him a hug.

Ana arrives at the prison to show Oliver some photos. As she is about to meet him, an alarm goes off and Oliver is brought out on a gurney having suffered a stab wound. In the hospital, he tells Danny and Ana that he knew something was up and when he asked around he found that a bounty had placed on his head. Danny asks Oliver if he can remember anything else from the train and Oliver confesses that Handsome never got on the train. Handsome had a plan where he would get on one car of the train, tell his crew where to meet up, and then fade away as his crew gets caught. Danny and Ana then try to figure out where Handsome would strike next. After going over his previous arrests on a map, they find out that Handsome is all over New York except for the Bronx and Staten Island. Since there is no subway in Staten Island, Danny and Ana travel to the Bronx to capture Handsome after calling Denise and finding out where Lee would hide from Handsome. Danny arrives at the subway station where Handsome is waiting alone and when confronted he runs away. But the chase is short lived as Danny catches Handsome and arrests him.

In a hotel room where Frank is meeting with Kelly, Frank gets a text on his phone followed by Kelly getting a text as well. Kelly says that she feels that Frank is mad at her, but he denies this. He explains that neither of them have involved their work when they meet, but he's not sure of that when she walked into his office. Frank doesn't want to cost Kelly her job. But Kelly admits that having both of them knowing information that no one else knows was dangerous enough. Kelly and Frank then share a kiss.

Jamie meets with Agent Anderson about the truth of how his brother Joe had died while being involved with The Blue Templar. Jamie denies this, saying his brother was a good cop. Agent Anderson reminds Jamie that she played the recording of Joe working with the FBI. She presents Jamie with Joe's Blue Templar pin and that she needs Jamie's help. Jamie says he is a rookie cop and going undercover against other cops is difficult as he is trying to be a cop himself. Agent Anderson tries to bring Jamie in by saying that, if Joe was her brother, she would help taking out other cops and what the right decision would be.

Erin meets up with Danny by the river as he is celebrating his victory in the case, but Danny doesn't feel it is much of a win because of Oliver. Erin then tells Danny that she had a meeting with the defense attorney and, because the public portrays Oliver as a hero for standing up to Handsome and getting stabbed is enough to drop the case, that Oliver would be looking at probation due to a gun charge. Erin then admits that she felt good doing something for Oliver and Danny and he takes her out to celebrate with a beer."

One of the students, Courtney Thurman, gets followed, chased by a black SUV and she gets grabbed by a man in a mask. When Detective Danny Reagan appears on the scene by himself, a police officer briefs Danny that the man grabbed Courtney and ripped off her clothes, but he did not finish the deed. Danny remarks that it is the second sexual assault in the same night and, with the same motives, Danny declares that it is a sexual predator on a spree.

At the Reagan house, Henry is teaching Jamie how to twirl a classic police baton while his girlfriend, Sydney, is trying to talk about their wedding, but Jamie is preoccupied with the baton. Erin figures out that something is up, but Sydney denies it. Sydney declares that she is happy that Jamie is doing something he loves. Erin tells her that she has every right to be worried since Jamie was on his way to law school and then decided to be a cop. Sydney is worried that Jamie will enjoy his job more than talking to her. Erin tells her not to take it personally, it's not her, it's the job. Erin's mother used to say the same thing about women not being able to compete against a gun and a shield.

Danny interviews Courtney but she is so distraught about the incident, that she can't remember anything that happened during the attack. Danny gets alerted that another attack has taken place 8 blocks away from where Courtney was attacked. In a restaurant, Frank is having a quiet dinner alone with Kelly Davidson. Kelly wonders how having dinner alone in a restaurant could be possible. Frank admits that he may have previously saved the owner's life and the owner did Frank a favor or was being generous. Frank is interrupted by a phone call and is forced to cut dinner short. Kelly asks Frank if she is going to see him later. He answers probably not. Kelly asks if there is anything he'd like to share and he pours his wine into her glass. Frank gives her a kiss and apologizes for having to leave. Kelly then takes out her phone and calls her news desk saying that something is happening in Manhattan North, but it is not going over the police radio.

Danny arrives at the newest crime scene and finds out that another student named Lauren Ryder was attacked. Her attacker beat her up and raped her. Danny is surprised that this attacker finally had the courage to get what he wanted. Lauren did manage to fight back enough to get a glimpse of her attacker and to give a partial identification before she is taken away in an ambulance. Frank is briefed by his assistant, Detective Baker, at police headquarters. Frank suggests that the victim's families should be made aware of the crimes before the press does. At that moment, Frank looks at the TV and sees Kelly reporting live from the crime scene. Frank sighs as he is aware that Kelly knew information about the crime and reported it.

Danny continues investigating the case. A rough sketch is being released to the media while Danny's boss, Sgt. Sid Gormley, goes through surveillance video hoping to catch a glimpse of the suspect's car. At a press conference, Frank assures the public that patrols on campus have been double and more foot patrols have been added. Kelly and a fellow reporter ask if there are any suspects. Frank answers that there are no suspects and acknowledges the other reporter instead of Kelly. Another reporter asks if there is a description and Kelly follows suit again. Frank answers the question and looks at the other reporter again instead of Kelly. Kelly asks if there are any firm leads. Frank answers that he already answered that question and he ends the press conference. Kelly feels embarrassed.

At the hospital, Danny meets with Lauren's father, Walter, and declares that he will get the guy who attacked his daughter. Danny asks if there are any ex-boyfriends that might have attacked her. Walter denies this. Walter is upset about what has happened to his daughter. Lauren is the only thing he has since her mother had died 15 years earlier. Jamie and Sgt. Anthony Renzulli are sitting by a fountain having lunch. Jamie asks if they should be doing something. Sgt. Renzulli claims that they are doing something: the art of nothing. Sgt. Renzulli says that cops need to focus on observing their surroundings. Sgt. Renzulli asks Jamie to look at a couple sitting on park benches. He asks Jamie what he thinks the man is doing. Jamie answers that he is reading a newspaper. Renzulli points out that is what he wants his wife to think. The man with the newspaper is actually looking at a couple of blond ladies doing Tai Chi. Renzulli points out another gentleman walking in the park with a suit and he pats his hip. Jamie believes he is checking for his wallet. Renzulli asks him who puts their wallet in their hip pocket? The man in a suit has a gun. Jamie gets up from the table and goes to arrest him. Renzulli stops him showing him that the man is a cop and all is well.

Danny shows Courtney a sketch of the man who attacked her, but Courtney says that it doesn't help her remember anything about him. Courtney's friend, Renee, and Courtney's boyfriend, Blake, arrive at her dorm and Danny shows them the sketch, but neither one of them recognize anyone on campus. Danny asks them if they remember anything or see anything to call him. Danny also noticed a tattoo on Blake's arm. Back at headquarters, Sgt. Gormley got a partial license plate off of the SUV which results in two strong leads, Vincent Harrah and Sofia Calso. Both of them have black SUVs that partially match the license plate of the car used in the attacks. Danny goes to interview Vincent. When Danny arrives at Vincent's apartment, Vince tries to flee by jumping off the fire escape and he injures his leg. Danny catches Vincent and arrests him, but Vincent claims that he was at Yankee Stadium. Sgt. Gormley confirms Vincent's alibi.

Danny goes to interview Sofia. Danny asks Sofia if the car is hers which she admits. Danny asks where she was the previous night. She claims she was at a charity auction, but she didn't drive her car and took a town car. Danny asks for the information of the company she used. Sofia becomes offended and declares that her husband is the Deputy Counsel of Argentina and she has diplomatic immunity. Danny tells Sofia that her car partially matches a car that was involved in the attacks. Sofia refutes this. Danny asks if anyone else had access to the car and Sofia refuses to further answer any more questions, but she does admit that her son does attend college in New York. Danny arrives at Sebastian Calso's college and, as he tries to question him, he meets Claudio Calso. Claudio asserts his son's diplomatic immunity as well. Danny informs Claudio of the attacks and when Claudio asks Sebastian if he knows anything, Sebastian simply shrugs his shoulders and walks away with his father. Danny strongly suggests that Sebastian is the suspect in the case, but Sgt. Gormley reminds him that a rough sketch and diplomatic immunity has made this case more difficult and that the Commissioner's office is involved in the case as well.

Commissoner Reagan meets with Claudio at One Police Plaza. Frank offers Claudio a cup of coffee and tells him that this isn't the first time they have met. Frank and Cladio had met when Frank was Chief of the Department. Frank tells him that he had been a police officer for 30 years before becoming Commissioner, but he was always a father first. Frank would always let his children know that they came first before the job, but he also let them know that, if they had done wrong, he would be as firm with them as any other lawbreaker on the street. Claudio says that is admirable. Frank asks Claudio to waive his son's immunity. Claudio claims his son is innocent. Frank asks that Claudio should allow the police to rule him out as a suspect by conducting an interview and providing a DNA sample. Claudio claims that would be a breach of diplomatic protocol and refuses. Claudio leaves. Detective Baker reenters the Commissioner's office and takes the coffee cup to the lab to obtain a DNA sample.

While Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli are on patrol, Jamie notices a guy walking down the street wearing a bulging coat. Jamie is suspicious that he is wearing a coat on a warm day. When Jamie approaches, the man tries to flee. As he flees, Jamie catches him and Sgt. Renzulli recovers a gun and some devices. Sgt. Renzulli congratulates Jamie on apprehending his first gun collar.

The lab results come in and it shows a partial match to the DNA found from when Lauren was raped, but Danny feels that it is pointless because Sebastian is untouchable due to diplomatic immunity. Frank meets up with Erin for a late lunch and shares his plan to send the DNA report to Argentina to hope that the country will revoke Claudio's diplomatic immunity. Frank also remembers that Erin had previously worked on a diplomatic immunity case and she decides to see if there is another way to help solve the case. As they finish their lunch, Kelly appears on television reporting that the NYPD does have a suspect, but he may walk free because of diplomatic immunity. Frank brings in Mayor Frank Russo and he says that the issue would become a state department problem and it wouldn't be the city's problem anymore. Danny meets up with Walter and informs him that his hands are tied. This angers Walter and he vows that if the police won't do anything maybe he should. At Sunday dinner, Danny and Jamie agree that diplomatic immunity is a way for people to abuse the system. Sydney challenges Danny's opinion by saying that diplomatic immunity may not be perfect, but it has a purpose. Sydney then suggests female American diplomats who get detained in the Middle East without having immunity. As dinner finishes, Frank gets a text saying that Argentina refuses to waive diplomatic immunity. As Frank is washing dishes, Erin comes in with some new information.

Danny finds Sofia and presents her with a material witness order due to her car being used in a class B felony and declares that her diplomatic immunity was negated after she had divorced Claudio which she failed to disclose to Danny. Also he says that she should make her son grant an interview since she controls his trust fund. As Sebastian is being brought in for questioning, Walter shows up looking for justice. Danny stops him and notices a bulge in Walter's coat pocket. Danny tells him, if he pats him down and finds a gun, it's a class C felony which would force him to arrest Walter and it would carry a three year prison sentence. He then tells Walter to leave and throw his gun into the river. Walter agrees and leaves.

At police headquarters, Sebastian complains that it is much too hot in the interrogation room. When Danny arrives, Sebastian's lawyer reminds him that, although Sebastian has agreed to the interview, he still will not give up his diplomatic immunity. Danny asks Sebastian where he was the night of the attacks. Sebastian gives up arrogant answers. Danny says that it's not funny that a girl got raped. The evidence speaks for itself: Sebastian's car was at the scene, the victim identified Sebastian, and Danny suggested that if Sebastian took a DNA test, it would solve the case. Danny mentions that Sebastian's tattoo looks nice and this causes Sebastian to leave immediately. After he leaves, Sgt. Gormley and a lab technician enter the room. Sebastian touched the door handle with his sweaty hands and a few drops of sweat were on the table which allowed them to obtain a DNA sample. Danny then asks the question: Why does the boyfriend of a victim have the same tattoo? Danny interviews Blake about his tattoo. It belongs to a secret society at school called Wolf and Key of which he and Sebastian are members. Danny asks Blake why he would protect someone who attacked his girlfriend. Among some tears, Blake confesses that he was the one who attacked Claudia and not Sebastian. When pressed further, Blake admits that it was part of an initiation that Sebastian came up with. Blake is now charged as an accessory to aggravated to rape and all the members of the Wolf and Key are arrested.

Frank is shown in his office on the phone with Kelly and he tells her that it would be best if they stop seeing each other. Claudio arrives in Frank's office where he was told about his son's interview and that his DNA was left behind in the room. The DNA collected matches the DNA that was collected from Lauren's attack, but Claudio is claiming that the evidence wouldn't matter because of diplomatic immunity. Frank does accept the fact that Sebastian does have immunity in the United States, but he does not have immunity in his home country of Argentina. Frank has sent a copy of the DNA report to the Buenos Aires Police Department which matches a previous case that Sebastian is now linked to. Frank gives Claudio 24 hours to return Sebastian to Argentina where he will be tried, convicted and sent to Mendoza prison or he can waive Sebastian's immunity and risk getting a fair trial in New York.

Jamie is sitting at Henry's house looking at old pictures. Henry asks Jamie how the first few weeks on the job are going. Jamie says that every time he tries to do something, his sergeant tells him how to do it differently. Henry gives his grandson some advice: Good cops are made by the world they police. Times change and so did the policing, but he should listen to his sergeant and become his own kind of police. Jamie finds a picture of Danny wearing a Blue Templar pin and asks Henry about it. Henry tells Jamie that the Blue Templar was formed to clean up the department, but eventually it became just another club of police officers drinking and telling war stories. Henry then dismisses the talk and turns on the television to check on the New York Jets.

The next morning, Danny brings in Sebastian to finally face charges of rape which ends the case. That night, Henry finds a gift of a cigar box on Frank's front porch with a card that says, ""Sorry, Kelly"". Erin asks who are they from and Frank replies that it is from the mayor who is being interviewed on the news. The mayor takes the credit for the crime being solved and that Argentina took the mayor's advice and did the right thing. Frank complains that, if you want a pat on the back, not to become a cop, but Erin, Danny, and Henry all praise Frank as he reminds Danny not to smoke the cigar in the house."

The leader comes out and makes certain that both of them know their roles in the heist. One is to never leave the truck while the other watches the room. The leader hands him a weapon and makes sure that, if anyone decides to be a hero, they are to be made a martyr.

At One Police Plaza, Henry pays Frank a visit for lunch, but almost gets stopped by a guard outside Frank's office. Henry notices that Frank is wearing his old gun, but claims that his gun is too old and he should wear a more modern gun. Frank says he likes wearing his father's gun. Henry brings pastrami sandwiches with Frank asking about Henry watching his cholesterol to which he replies it's a tactical retreat. At police headquarters, Jamie tries to question Danny about his involvement with The Blue Templar. Danny is dismissive about the topic and says that a rookie shouldn't worry about it. Back in the city, the truck heads to the diamond store and the leader declares that, if they work smart together, they all will be rich.

Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli are having a coffee break while on patrol and Sgt. Renzulli cannot believe that Jamie got Danny to go to a performance of Shakespeare in the park. During their chat, a call comes in over the radio which forces them to cut their break short. Sgt. Renzulli recognizes the call. It is a couple who frequently have issues with each other. When they arrive on the scene, they find a woman named Alice calling a man named John Ganley a pig while yelling through a bullhorn. In front of the apartment is an inflatable pig. Alice claims that she has the first amendment right of freedom of speech, but Jamie reminds her that abundant case law states it infringes on speech when it impedes public order. Basically, Alice can say whatever she wants, but doing it over a bullhorn and having an inflatable pig on the sidewalk is wrong. The truck with the gang arrive at the diamond exchange disguised as electricians. They make their way inside and proceed to rob the diamonds. Outside the exchange, a police officer, Michelle Martin, is speaking to her mother on her meal break. As the gang make their escape after three minutes, the police officer spots the gun one of the members of the gang is carrying and they exchange gunfire. The leader of the gang shoots the police officer and, as she falls to the ground, she wounds the gang member carrying the stolen diamonds. The gang escape in their truck. Henry and Frank are made aware that Officer Martin has died. Frank immediately calls upon his department chiefs and that all tours are to be extended.

Danny and his new partner, Detective Jackie Curatola, arrive at the diamond exchange and get briefed on the situation. The inspector at the scene informs them that the gang got away with nearly five million dollars in diamonds and that Officer Martin was in the area to get her wedding ring re-sized. All the eyewitnesses differ on their description of the gang, but they all agree that there were three of them. Danny notices a blood trail and suggests contacting any medical facility where the gang member could receive medical attention. Frank has a meeting with his department chiefs and he meets with the family of the fallen police officer. Frank gives them the sad news about what has happened.

Linda and Sydney are meeting in a diner and they discuss about what happens after a police officer dies on duty. They decide to postpone their visit to Shakespeare in the park and Sydney asks how Linda deals with the possibility of something happening to Danny. Linda answers that, every time she hears that a police officer is dead, she holds her breath until she knows that Danny is safe. At headquarters, Danny finds out that there is a strong possibility that the diamonds are going out of the country. Jackie shows Danny the footage from a surveillance camera pointed right at the entrance of the diamond store, but it is blocked by a worker who is repairing a streetlight. Danny figures out that it is not a coincidence that the one streetlight with a perfect view is broken and scheduled to be fixed. Danny brings in the streetlight worker and asks him how is it possible that he was working on that specific streetlight at that specific time. The worker claims that he is just a streetlight worker. Jackie comes in with a picture of his children and a pane of glass and tells him to touch the glass, because that's the only way a cop killer is going to touch his children at a maximum state prison. The street worker denies being a cop killer, but Danny tells him, because he helped in the killing of a police officer, his is one. The street worker confesses that he is deep in debt with his bookie for fifty thousand dollars and, if he didn't help them, he would kill him. After asking for witness protection, the street worker gives up the name of his bookie: Ricky Vintano. Danny and Jackie attempt a raid at Vintano's apartment only to find out that he is not there.

Danny seizes a couple of computers from Vintano's apartment as Commissioner Frank arrives for an update on the case. Danny suggest visiting Vintano's father, ""Happy"" Jack Vontano, in which Frank says that he would immediately call his lawyer. Frank suggests a 24 hour surveillance. The gang's van has been found and it has started being processed for clues. Frank lets Danny know that he told the family what happened and declares that solving this case must be a priority to which Danny agrees. Back at headquarters, some new surveillance footage shows Vintano separating from his group with the diamonds. Unfortunately, everybody associated with Vintano has turned up nothing and there were no reports from anybody receiving medical attention from a gunshot wound until a bartender of Vintano, Billy Leo, comes forward, but the problem with him is that he is facing a parole violation for drug possession. He claims that he saw one of the gang members, Jimmy Costello, a week before the heist with Vintano, but it's not enough for Danny to look past the drug possession. He claims that he saw them get into a rented black Cadillac. So with Vintano running away with the diamonds, and Jimmy in no position to travel due to his injuries, all is left is to identify the final member of the gang. Sgt. Gormley suggest tracking down the rented black Cadillac for clues.

At the Reagan household, Nicky runs into the house and gives her grandfather, Frank, a big hug. He is happy to see her as she tells him of her trip to San Francisco. Her mother, Erin, reminds her that she is now two weeks behind on her homework to which Frank sends her off into the kitchen to get started on her homework. Henry asks if it is true in the newspaper that Ricky Vintano is the main suspect in the case from reading the story in the newspaper. Henry then tells the story how Happy Jack was strictly a numbers and sports guy. He never used guns, drugs or dealt with girls even though he was involved with the mob. Henry even praised Happy Jack that they were in the same military unit, but when it came to cop killing cases, he was on the side of the police. When a cop killing case came across Henry's desk as police commissioner, he unofficially went to see Happy Jack. Two days later, the cop killer ended up dead. After Henry leaves the room, Frank starts to reminisce about Officer Martin joining the police after he spoke at Syracuse University. Erin believes that Frank blames himself for his son, Joe, dying. Frank says that, anytime a police officer dies, it's like losing a member of the family. Erin reminds Frank that he inspires people everyday. The price they pay is the life they choose after the fact. Frank thanks his daughter for the kind words.

As the investigation continues, surveillance on Happy Jack comes up empty with no footage of Ricky being found. Jackie announces that the black Cadillac was rented by Jimmy using an alias. Danny goes and checks a possible lead on the car. At a grocery store, Henry meets with Happy Jack and they talk about their sons and the past. Henry tells Jack that Frank is now the police commissioner and he questions Jack about Ricky. Jack starts to question Henry as to why he is doing so, to which Henry says he is doing a courtesy. Jack talks about his son saying that he never wanted to be around the mob life. Henry reminds him when a cop falls, no quarter should be given. As Henry leaves the grocery store, he is watched by two investigators in a car. Danny and Jackie find the black Cadillac and, when they open the trunk, they find Jimmy who has died. Danny determines that Jimmy died by being strangled to death.

Back at headquarters, after watching footage that shows the three members of the gang two days before the heist, the final member of the gang and the person who shot Officer Martin is identified as Dukajean Kola, an Albanian jewel thief. Frank suggests that they should find Kola before he finds Vintano. At the Reagan house, Frank is shining his shoes in preparation for Officer Martin's funeral when Henry asks if he has a spare set of collar stars. Frank asks Henry about his trip to the grocery store in the Bronx. Henry tries to defend himself by claiming he was trying to help. Frank tells his father that the investigators that were parked outside the grocery store recorded a conversation between Henry and Jack and Jack alerted his son. Henry argued that Jack was trying to protect his son, which would be the same thing the Reagans would be doing in a similar fashion. Frank asks Henry if he realizes what would happen if the press became aware of their meeting and that the NYPD isn't the only group keeping an eye on Vintano. Henry claims that Frank is worried that his father is going to embarrass him. Frank responds that he is worried that he may have hindered the case. Henry admits that, maybe it was wrong to visit Happy Jack, but he felt that the only way to bring Vintano to justice was that his father would give him up. At Officer Martin's funeral, Frank gives the eulogy and gives a salute to Officer Martin's young son. After the funeral, Jackie meets up with Danny and gives him some news. Vintano calls Happy Jack and he tells him that he needs to give himself up. When asked about where the call originated, Jackie tells Danny in was in Parkchester, New York, where Vintano had been in prison with a former cellmate named Shawn Randolph. Shawn had died, but ex-wife, Lori Kent, continued to visit Vintano. As Danny and Jackie confront Lori, they also find Vintano and arrest him.

As Danny is driving Vintano, he is in the back seat of the car calling for his lawyer. Danny tells Vintano that neither his lawyer nor his father can help him. He stops the car in a secluded area near a power plant. As the car stops, Jackie questions Danny as to what his intentions are and to not do anything stupid. Danny asks Jackie to have his back, just like she did before when they worked together. Danny takes Vintano to the same spot where Happy Jack previously killed a cop killer in 1975. Vintano claims innocence, that all he did was drive the car. Danny then makes a very strong offer: either give up the shooter or he's going to put two bullets in the back of his head. Vintano gives up the information on Kola and that he would be in a warehouse. At the warehouse, many cops have the area surrounded by guns. The warehouse door opens and Kola comes out shooting a shotgun. The police officers return fire and Kola dies in a storm of bullets. Danny declares that the case is closed by saying now he can sleep at night.

Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli return to Alice's apartment where she is continuing her free speech by holding up a sign and using a live pig. Sgt. Renzulli is actually speechless at this. As Frank is preparing dinner, Frank attempts to give Henry the silent treatment. Henry compares Frank to his mother, stoic. But the Reagans are fighters. Frank reminds him that his wife could do more with a look than a few punches. He also tells him that the next time Henry wants to help out, all he has to do is pick up the phone and ask. The family sits down to the dinner and discuss how the case was solved and they share a few laughs when Henry mispronounces Lady Gaga's name."

They break into an apartment of a man with a beard. He is ordered to put his hands up and not to move. At the Reagan household, Erin arrives and meets Henry in the kitchen as they are getting ready for an outing. Henry complains about not wanting to go to a handball tournament. Erin reminds him that he loves handball. Henry reminds her that he loved to play handball. Frank appears and announces that he cannot attend the tournament. Danny also arrives and is ready to go, but he questions Frank as he leaves. Danny also reminds Frank that it is his grandson's birthday. Frank assures Danny that he has never missed a birthday yet and leaves. Henry scolds Danny for being late. Danny explains that he worked a late shift the night before and is interrupted by a phone call. Danny is called back to work as well, leaving Erin and Henry to go out to the handball tournament by themselves.

On the way to one Police Plaza, Frank is being briefed on the raid. The man who was arrested is named Steven Haas who adopted the name Khalid Hassan. Hassan sent an email to leaders of al-Qaeda with the message ""Today no rest for oppressors in New York City. In area of fireball slaughters crusader enemies"". On his computer, the police found instructions on how to build a car bomb. At his apartment they also found chemicals, tools and wires, but no device and no car. The car was not registered, but neighbors reported seeing an older dark colored SUV. Frank asks what the target would be. No target had been specified, but a map of the 59th Street Bridge was also recovered. Frank orders that all checkpoints be doubled at all bridges and tunnels leading in and out of Manhattan. Frank then declares that it's not going to happen again, referencing the events of 9/11. Danny is getting the same information from his partner, Ava, and then realizes that Linda is taking their sons, Sean and Jack, to the Central Park Zoo for Jack's birthday. Danny tries to call Linda, but her phone dies as she forgot to charge her phone the night before. Linda and the boys are heading into the city by subway. Danny leaves her a voicemail telling her to turn around and head back home. The police are checking all dark colored SUVs as a car with Arabic writing on the rear view mirror drives into the city.

Frank arrives at One Police Plaza where he meets with Chief Bell and Agent Mills of Homeland Security in an emergency command center. Chief Bell reports that a description of the car has gone over the airwaves and all of the police have been called into active duty, but with the large number of dark SUVs in the city, it would take hours to search each one. Agent Mills declares that will give every bit of data they have on Hassan. Frank asks why he is just now hearing about Hassan. Agent Mills tells him that Hassan is an American citizen with an American passport even though he was in Yemen 14 months prior. Frank deduces that Hassan took part in bomb training. Agent Mills admits that his trip to Yemen was not suspicious. Frank goes into his office with Chief Bell and asks how they are certain that the bomb is still in the car. Chief Bell answers that diagrams of the car show that having the bomb inside of it would cause a maximum effect. However, he declares that the bomb is not nuclear because there were no traces of radiation on Hassan or in his apartment. Frank asks what kind of damage can be done. Chief Bell answers, with the ingredients and full formula used, the bomb could have a one block radius. Frank adds another half block with the additions of fragments and shrapnel. Frank finds out that Hassan is being held at Danny's precinct. Chief Bell remarks that Danny's interrogation skills are quite effective to which Frank silently agrees. The car with the Arabic writing drives past Yankee Stadium.

In the city, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli approach a dark SUV, but Sgt. Renzulli dismisses it when he realizes the car is too clean to be a threat. Jamie comments that this bomb alert seems more serious than a previous call they received. Sgt. Renzulli tells him that since 9/11 a lot of threats come in regularly, but they all turn out to be nothing. He would know if the threat is more credible if another alert comes in. They look up ahead and Sgt. Renzulli sees a guy in a hot dog costume holding a sign. He believes him to be suspicious, but Jamie doesn't take it seriously. Sgt. Renzulli explains to him that he could be hiding contraband in his costume and spots him getting nervous. Jamie again doesn't take it seriously. Sgt. Renzulli orders him to go question him. Jamie tries to remind him about the bomb threat, but Sgt. Renzulli reminds him that it would get serious only if another alert comes in. Jamie denies the order, saying that he is not going to question a guy in a hot dog costume. Sgt. Renzulli then explains and asks why would somebody take a humiliating job unless there's something else going on? Jamie tries to reason with Sgt. Renzulli saying that unemployment is high. Sgt. Renzulli again orders Jamie to stop, question, and frisk the guy in the hot dog costume. Jamie finally relents and approaches the guy in the costume. As he approaches, the guy in the costume throws down his sign and tries to run away. Jamie gives chase and tackles the guy to the ground. When they hit the ground, a bunch of illegal drugs fall out of his costume. As Jamie finishing handcuffing the man in the costume, another alert comes over the airwaves.

At Danny's precinct, Danny attempts to contact Linda, but her phone again goes to voicemail. Danny suggests that the Central Park Zoo could be a possible target. Ava suggests that Danny head to the zoo to warn his family, but Danny refuses. Ana shows Danny a picture of Hassan and asks if he remembers him. Danny admits that he does; Hassan was the victim of a strong arm robbery case in the East Village which Danny helped solve. Danny can't believe that a scared young kid like that had become a radical. Ava announces that a secondary squad is tracking down a few of Hassan's cousins and that he had become estranged from his parents. Danny again tries to contact Linda by having her paged at the zoo when Detective Vitale and Hassan arrive to began questioning. Vitale reminds Danny to stick by the book while questioning Hassan so his case ends up sticking. The car with the Arabic writing passes Grand Central Station.

Erin and Henry are walking in the city and they pass a checkpoint with confused looks on their faces. Erin figures out that is the reason why Danny and Frank had to leave to go to work. Erin suggests contacting her office, but Henry stops her by saying that they won't know anything; it's a police matter and they should do their work. Henry then looks up and smiles as they have arrived at the handball courts. Henry admits that it is good to back at a place where he used to spend his Saturdays. Back at the precinct, Vitale begins questioning Hassan. Danny comes into the room and says that his name is not Hassan, but Steve. Vitale reminds Hassan that if the bomb goes off, he could be facing multiple homicides. Hassan could also be facing a federal death sentence. Danny looks at Vitale and says that Steve isn't afraid of the death penalty; why else would he outsource someone else to blow themselves up? Hassan remains silent. Vitale pleads with Hassan and he breaks his silence by saying that Vitale's life is meaningless and corrupt. Vitale reminds Hassan that, if the bomb goes off, all deals are off the table. Hassan defiantly rejects any deals and asks for his lawyer. Danny tells him his lawyer is delayed because of the checkpoints and then asks Steve if he remembers him. Steve remains silent again, but Danny figures out that he does indeed remember him. Hassan calls him corrupt as well just like his wife and children. Danny becomes angry at this which causes Vitale to send him out of the room. Hassan asks for something to drink which Danny sarcastically agrees to.

At the emergency command center, Frank asks to see the original email, noting that the phrasing seems odd. Going over the sentence ""In area fireball slaughters crusader enemies"". The technician tells Frank that Hassan is a non-native Arabic speaker and the word that Hassan used that meant ""area"" may have meant something else. Frank needs to know what Hassan exactly meant. The technician picks up on a live chat between a cafe and a rural training camp in Yemen. One declares that the people of New York will suffer as they have. The other asks if it has been done and the reply is before the new day. Frank then deduces that they have until 5 o'clock before the bomb detonates. Frank then receives a call from the mayor asking for a joint public statement. Frank recommends no public statement at this time. When Chief Bell tries to reason, Frank tells him that the information that they do have would do nothing but cause a panic. Agent Mills reminds Frank that there could be repercussions for withholding information and that he would have to let people in Washington D.C know about this. Frank admits that he is well aware of the risks. Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli get called in to assist with a checkpoint instead of taking the guy in the hot dog costume to jail. As they approach a checkpoint, a dark SUV attempts to cross the checkpoint without being searched. Jamie drives his police car and blocks the SUV, almost causing a crash and causing the guy in the hot dog costume to scream. Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli order the driver to show his hands with their guns drawn. Sgt. Renzulli calls in the bomb squad and Emergency Service Unit. They approach the driver and ask if there is a bomb in the car. This causes the driver to freak out and scream out that there is a bomb in the car. Sgt. Renzulli then asks if the driver is stoned, to which he admits. Jamie calls off the ESU and bomb squad and the driver is arrested for being under the influence of a controlled substance.

Danny announces that Steven is not talking and needs to find out who is driving the car. Ava announces that there have been over 700 people stopped and it would take 2 days to go through all of them. Danny suggests only looking at Arab people who may have been connected to Steven Haas. Ava suggests cross checking through airlines and Danny suggests seeing if any people of Steven's mosque are involved. The car with the Arabic writing drives through a tunnel and passes the Metlife building. Danny again tries to call Linda, but it keeps going to voicemail. When the phone does ring, Erin is on the line asking what is going on in the city. Danny confirms that it is a credible bomb threat in Manhattan. Erin offers to leave Brooklyn and head to Manhattan to warn Linda and the kids, but Danny tells her to stay in Brooklyn where it is safe. Danny is also frustrated that he has checked every possible Arab without any results. Erin suggests that the suspect might not be Arab. Erin has numerous open cases and reminds him that a video on the Internet is recruiting American terrorists. Danny plays off Erin's suggestion. He and Ava start looking at all the checkpoint stops that were looked over for not being suspicious. Henry and Erin are watching the handball games and Henry is enjoying yelling at the players and having a good time. Henry remembers how much of a good time he had playing and Erin suggests that someday he might do so. Henry admits that his playing days are over since he uses a cane to get around. Erin then asks Henry who is going to teach his great granddaughter, Nicky, about handball. Henry says that Nicky doesn't care about handball. Erin reminds him that Danny didn't care about handball either. Instead, Danny liked spending time with his grandfather and listening to old stories. Henry asks Erin about her phone call. Erin admits that there is a car bomb threat in the city. Henry becomes angry wondering when all this is going to stop. He then remembers that bomb threats in his day were different than the ones that take place now.

At the precinct, the interrogation continues. Vitale asks Hassan what the email said. Hassan refuses, saying that he has a translation in front of him. Vitale tells him that it doesn't make any sense. He again reads out loud ""No rest for the oppressors today in New York City"" to which Hassan admits that is what is written. Hassan asks for a drink of water which Danny refuses. Vitale again reads the email noting there are more words written. Vitale asks Hassan if he knows Arabic to which Hassan admits that he does. Vitale asks him to translate words from the email. He points to a word and Hassan translates it by saying ""Crusader enemies"". Vitale asks the next word, Hassan translates it to the word ""slaughter"". Vitale asks the next word, Hassan translates it to ""fireball"". Vitale asks another word, and Hassan translates it to the word ""park"". Vitale questions this saying that the word meant ""area"". Hassan reconfirms that the word ""Mintaqa"" means park. Vitale then deduces that the intended target is a park. The car with the Arabic writing drives near Washington Square Park.

Frank is given the information at the emergency command center that all the police are being redeployed to every park and playground in Manhattan. Frank admits that it is a good lead in the case when he finds out that Mayor Frank Russo has arrived. Frank excuses himself to speak with the mayor. The mayor reprimands Frank by asking wouldn't it have been better if the public was informed? Frank answers that it would have been a better if the information on the car and target was more specific, otherwise he would be creating chaos. The mayor asks what would happen if the bomb went off and no one was warned about it. Frank declares that the bomb will be found and disarmed. The mayor then gives Frank a deadline of 4 o'clock and orders him to be at a press conference. Back at the precinct, Danny and Ava are still having trouble going through all the people that have been stopped at police checkpoints. Danny comes across someone named Mary Jo Clarkson who is married to Steven's cousin, Alex Haas. Danny looks up Mary Jo's social media page. Ava finds out that Alex was questioned at his college where he teaches economics, but he has no known contacts with extremist groups. Danny dismisses that stating that Mary Jo was stopped at a checkpoint in Manhattan in a car that matches the description of the SUV. Danny tells Ava to bring up the footage of her stop at the checkpoint. While searching on Mary Jo's social media page, Danny finds out that she and Alex have a son named Jacob and she is part of the same radical mosque as Hassan. Danny also finds a link to a suicide bomber page. Ava brings up a picture of Mary Jo and her son and on the rearview mirror is the Arabic writing shown driving through the city. Danny and Ava then goes to question Alex.

Frank becomes aware of Mary Jo as Chief Bell tells him that the police are being redeployed again to the downtown parks, especially near Washington Square Park. Frank reminds him not to stop looking at other areas, even though they have a strong lead. Chief Bell reminds Frank that finding Mary Jo is only half the problem. Frank concurs and decides to contact the mayor's office and go public is the next best option. Danny and Ava arrive at Alex's apartment. Danny asks Alex if he knows where his wife is. Alex answers that Mary Jo is no longer his wife because they had gotten a divorce. Alex was going to meet Mary Jo. Danny asks where they were going to meet. Alex answers that they were going to meet at Washington Square Park at 4 o'clock near the arch. Danny calls in the information. Alex demands to know what is going on. Danny asks Alex what is going on. Alex tells Danny that he was awarded fully custody of Jacob and that Mary Jo was bringing him to his father. Mary Jo asked to spend one last night together as a family and that she had a beautiful place to show them. Danny takes Alex out of the apartment and they head to the park. Danny asks Alex if she is a radical and Alex confirms that Mary Jo converted to Islam and went crazy. Alex had been trying to remove Jacob from her ever since. Danny asks Alex if she is crazy enough to build a bomb. Alex becomes very frightened and declares that he has to save his son. Danny tries to calm him down by saying that he could be the trigger for Mary Jo to detonate the bomb. Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli head near the park to set up a perimeter as they discuss the case. Jamie doesn't like that he is being sent in not knowing what they are getting into. Sgt. Renzulli reminds him to follow orders and get used to not knowing.

Mary Jo drives up to the arch at the park when Jacob asks if he is going to sleep at his father's house. Mary Jo tells her son that they will all be together in a beautiful place. Mary Jo parks the car, puts on a hijab and smiles at her son. Danny and Alex arrive at the arch and Alex tries to approach the car. Danny stops him and tells him if he approaches, she could set off the bomb. Danny heads to a pay phone and calls for backup; saying that he has a visual on the car. Ava approaches behind the car. Jacob asks his mother where his father is as she takes out the detonator from the glove compartment. In Frank's office, he and the mayor discuss what they are going to say at the press conference. Frank suggests that they give a description of Mary Jo and the vehicle. The mayor sarcastically asks about adding in the information that a bomb is in the back seat. Frank agrees to the information. The Mayor reluctantly agrees saying that just saying that a bomb is in play is the right thing to do. Chief Bell then comes in and announces that Mary Jo has been located. The Mayor and Frank return to the emergency command center and they watch on a live surveillance camera. Danny tells Alex to leave, but he refuses. Danny tells him if he lets him go over to the car, Mary Jo will detonate the bomb. Alex says that Mary Jo wants them to stay together. Danny says that went Mary Jo told him that she wanted them to stay together, she wanted them in Heaven together. Alex asks if Danny would leave his son. Danny says he is trying to save Jacob and the bomb squad is on the way. Alex says that if Mary Jo sees the police, she would set off the bomb and she would never let Jacob go. Danny again says that they are waiting for the bomb squad. Alex begs Danny to save Jacob. Danny orders Alex to stay put and he approaches the car. Danny identifies himself as a coworker of Alex and he was going to be late in their meeting. Mary Jo says that she will stay in the car and asks Danny to tell Alex to meet them at the car. Mary Jo refuses to leave her car, so Danny decides to wait at the car with them. Mary Jo becomes nervous and Danny talks with Jacob. Mary Jo looks in the rearview mirror and sees the police arriving. Danny feigns ignorance and says that he will go and get Alex as Mary Jo puts her thumb over the detonator. Danny goes to leave the car when Jacob sees his father and calls out to him. Danny orders him back as Mary Jo orders him to come closer. The mayor questions Danny's plans as they watch the video feed.

The confrontation continues with Alex ordering Mary Jo to let Jacob go. Mary Jo tells Alex that they are married for eternity and that, if he doesn't approach the car, she will detonate the bomb and kill Jacob. Danny tries to calm the situation down by having Alex removed and talking to her. He pleads with Mary Jo not to set off the bomb and die alone as Ava slowly approaches the rear of the car. Mary Jo admits that the way things are going now is not the way it was supposed to happen. The people in the command center continue to watch the live feed when Chief Bell tells Frank that the ESU is ready to extract Danny and take over the scene. Frank orders the ESU to follow Danny's lead in the situation. Danny shows Mary Jo his badge and declares he is a detective. Danny promises to bring Alex over to the car as long as Mary Jo keeps her hands where they can be seen. Ava continues to move closer to the rear of the vehicle. He asks her to put the detonator on the dashboard and work together. Mary Jo agrees as Danny signals to have Ava move closer to the car. As soon as she puts the detonator on the dashboard, Ava opens the passenger side door and grabs Jacob as Danny reaches through the window and pulls Mary Jo out the window. Danny places Mary Jo on the ground and arrests her. Ava leads Jacob over to his father. Chief Bell announces that the bomb had been successfully disarmed and the mayor is asking Frank to appear at the press conference. Frank asks Chief Bell where he was on 9/11. Chief Bell answers that he and Frank were working together clearing out the North Tower. Frank apologizes that he was thinking out loud and remembers where they were on 9/11. Chief Bell reminds Frank that his son was out there to which Frank agrees. Chief Bell then says good night to Frank and leaves.

At the Reagan house, decorations are being put up for Jack's birthday as Jamie arrives with pizza. Frank announces that Danny is running late filling out a ton of reports. When Danny arrives, Henry praises Danny as a hero to which Danny announces he got chewed out by everybody. Frank praises his son, but reminds him that if he did in fact get chewed out, he deserved it. Linda and the kids arrive announcing that her day has been long and the subways were packed because of some kind of incident downtown. Linda wants to know what was going on and Frank tells her that she would be told all about it. Jack asks to eat his dinner on the back porch to which Frank defers to Henry. Henry says that, although Sunday dinners are to be held at the table, birthday Saturdays are open to anything as long as grace has been said. Erin asks Henry where his cane is and he announces that he no longer needs it and he wants to teach the children about handball. Frank then speaks up. He is grateful that his family went their separate ways in the morning and then returned to be together for Jack's birthday. Jack then takes his pizza to the back porch. Jamie then says grace over dinner and the family eats their dinner."

She sends a couple of students into a bedroom when she feels that they are making out too strongly on the dance floor. She heads up the stairs when another students remarks that she can't believe that a fellow student invited someone else as they sit on a couch together. The host shrugs it off saying that they deserve each other. The girl on the couch feels that it was a bad idea for her to come to the party as the boy, Billy, calms her by saying that the host, Caitlin, had invited him. He tells her that she knows that they are a couple and that she loves drama. He then kisses his girlfriend causing Caitlin to scoff at this. The girlfriend tells her that she feels close to him and Billy offers a way to become closer: a drug called M-Cat. Billy wishes to try it with his girlfriend saying that the feeling would be awesome. The girlfriend is unsure of this, but Billy reassures her that the drug is not addicting. The captain of the lacrosse team overhears the conversation and announces that, if the girlfriend won't do the drug, he will. Billy takes a hit of the drug.

In the city, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli have pulled over a lady in a car for talking on her phone while driving. The lady scolds Jamie for not taking murderers and drunk drivers off the streets and instead pulling her over. Jamie declares he is just looking out for her safety. Jamie tries to be professional, but the lady is rude and drives away. Jamie tells Renzulli that he hates this part of the job. Renzulli responds by reminding him that their commanding officer wants an increase in activity. He also tells Jamie that maybe he should have stuck with becoming a lawyer instead of a becoming a police officer. They then get a call over the radio of a loud and boisterous complaint. At the Reagan house, Erin arrives wearing a nice dress and Frank comes downstairs wearing a tuxedo as they are going out for the evening. Henry has agreed to watch Nicky and he suggests playing a game of Scrabble. Nicky declines saying she has a lot of homework to do. Henry asks what's going on with his great granddaughter and Erin tells her that Nicky feels she is too old to be babysat. Frank suggests that maybe Erin should loosen the reigns a little. Erin reminds Frank that he had sent a patrol car to follow her around when she had gone to her prom. Frank confesses that he wouldn't do that; in fact the car that he did send was unmarked. Henry also confesses that he had checked the driving record of Erin's prom date and they leave together. Back at the party, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli arrive at the party. They knock on the door twice and Caitlin answers. Sgt. Renzulli tells her about the noise complaint and asks if a party is going on, especially since it a school night. Caitlin says that they are working on a class project. Jamie asks if there is any underage drinking going on to which Caitlin denies. Sgt. Renzulli asks if her parents are home and Caitlin lies saying that her father stepped out to go the store. Suddenly a girl yells out at her friends begging them to wake up. Sgt. Renzulli and Jamie enter the apartment and they find Billy, his girlfriend, the captain of the lacrosse team, and another student passed out. Sgt. Renzulli calls for an ambulance and Jamie does CPR on Billy's girlfriend.

As Frank and Erin arrive at the event they are attending, a member of Frank's security detail tells him the situation at the party. Billy, the captain of the lacrosse team, and the third male student all had died, but the girlfriend survived and was sent to the hospital. Frank asks what kind of a drug was used to which the answer is unknown or where the source of the drug came from. Frank also becomes aware that Jamie saved the girl's life. Frank asks his officer if there is something else to which he denies, but then admits that he felt that he should not have told Frank about the overdose. He felt that it would infringe on Frank's personal life. Frank praises his officer and attends the event. At the hospital, Jamie keeps watching over the girlfriend, Alyson, as she wakes up. She admits that her head is fuzzy due to the medicine she was given to counteract the drugs she took, but she has no recollection of doing so. She asks where Billy is, but Jamie deflects answering saying that he needs to get a doctor for Alyson. Jamie says that he is sorry and Alyson realizes that Billy had died. Then Danny and his partner, Detective Jackie Curatola, arrive in the hospital room to question Alyson. Danny asks Jamie what is going on and he tells him that Alyson was asking about Billy. Jamie confesses that he didn't know what to tell her and sends Jamie out of the room. Jackie starts to question Alyson, but she doesn't believe that any of it is real. Danny adds that questions have to be asked so they can figure out what happened. Jackie shows Alyson a picture of the cat logo that was on the drugs asking her if she recognizes it. Alyson admits that she knew that it was a drug that Billy had gotten. Danny asks if she knew where Billy had gotten the drug, Alyson responds by saying she doesn't know where he got it and that she doesn't do drugs. Danny tells her she is lucky to be alive. Alyson asks about the other boys from the party and Jackie confirms to her that they died. Danny stresses that it is very important that they figure out where the drugs came from so no one else dies. Alyson agrees. Danny asks if she heard or saw anything that she can remember. Alyson was told nothing and saw nothing because nobody at school talks to her. All the friends at the party were Billy's friends. Danny assures Alyson that she will be all right and he and Jackie leave the room. In the hallway, Danny scolds Jamie about making Alyson cry, but then praises his brother for saving her life. Jamie asks if it just an overdose. Jackie answers that it would take awhile until the toxicity reports come back to be sure. Jackie suggests to start questioning every student at the party to find the drug dealer. Danny suggests they start with the one who threw the party, Caitlin. As Jamie leaves the hospital, he gets a text from Agent Anderson asking why he hasn't contacted them.

Erin picks up Nicky from school and they are talking about being in the city alone. Nicky announces that she wants to be part of a group of six fellow students to go out and eat Chinese food and see a movie. Erin asks if she can see the movie somewhere else, but it takes place at Film Forum. Nicky promises to take the subway straight home after the movie then claims that her father would let her go. Erin agrees but makes Nicky promise to come home safely and never use her father as leverage. Nicky promises to text her mother constantly and that she will be safe. Nicky then gets an alert on her phone about the students that overdosed at the party. Nicky reveals that she knows students at that school. Danny and Jackie are questioning Caitlin about the drugs at the party with her father, Tom Breyer, attempting to answer for her. He declares that his daughter does not do drugs which Danny sarcastically agrees with since Caitlin did not die from the drugs Billy took. Danny asks Caitlin who Billy bought the drugs from and Tom answers that she doesn't know. Danny asks Tom to let Caitlin answer the question to which he gets the same answer. Caitlin responds that she has to live with the fact that three people died in her apartment. Tom suggests that Danny is upsetting his daughter and the whole situation isn't her fault. Danny suggests putting the blame on Tom. Tom trusts his daughter and that all of it started as an innocent get together. He blames Billy for taking advantage of her. Danny reminds him that there was more than one kid at the party and that he should back off and let Caitlin help with the investigation. Tom claims he has done nothing illegal and that it is legal for a 16 year old to be alone in a secure building. Jackie asks Caitlin again stressing that she needs to be the one who answers the question as to where Billy got the drugs. Catlin again answers that she doesn't know. Danny then reminds her that, even though she is 16 years old, she can also be charged as an adult and be arrested. Tom asks if Danny is using a scare tactic and Jackie takes out her handcuffs to add to the situation. Tom believes what is happening is outrageous, but Danny claims it is the law and that everyone at the party could be charged with possession of an illegal substance. Also, if Tom hadn't been away on business, Danny could've arrested him as well. Jackie asks if Caitlin wants to add anything more and she finally admits that someone at school sold him the drugs, but she still admits she doesn't know who. That's good enough for Danny as they head to St. Angelus Catholic School.

Danny and Jackie arrive at the school with Danny telling of his times at Catholic School when one of his teachers hit his knuckles with a ruler. Jackie boasts that she had won a Leadership Award four years in a row until she discovered boys. Danny questions Father Leo and Vice Principal Carol Hoffman. Father Leo declares that at St. Angelus nobody is dealing hard drugs unlike in the city. Vice Principal Hoffman asks if they have any idea who the dealer is and Jackie answers that they are trying to figure it out. Father Leo also admits that there had been a few incidents of marijuana and alcohol use, but Vice Principal Hoffman found out who it was and solved the issues by administering help. Danny asks to see any surveillance videos, but there aren't any because it is not in the school's budget and that the Lord sees everything. Jackie asks to talk to the students, but they would need parental permission. With there being so many students, it would take up too much time. Jackie asks if the school lockers could be searched with permission. Father Leo scoffs at this saying that it is an invasion of privacy. Danny reminds him that three kids are dead, and unless an epidemic is started, the lockers must be searched. Father Leo agrees with Danny, but he doesn't have the authority to sanction a search. Father Leo suggests that Danny go to Father Leo's superiors. Danny answers that Father Leo should talk to his higher power and he will do the same.

Frank goes to a church and, after leaving a donation, lighting a candle, and saying a prayer, he meets with Bishop Donovan and asks for permission to search the lockers at St. Angelus. Bishop Donovan warns Frank that giving permission to search the lockers has ramifications. Frank asks if those ramifications are more important than seeing more students die. Bishop Donovan claims there will be outrage by the parents of the students if they are all treated as suspects. Frank stresses that the police needs to find out who is manufacturing the drug and get it away from the students. Bishop Donovan suggests also that many parents will withdraw their children from the school forcing it to close down. Frank warns that he doesn't want to have get a court order to search the lockers. He also suggests that if that happens the church would look uncooperative. Frank also reminds Bishop Donovan that the church cannot afford to sweep another problem under the rug, referring to previous unnamed issues that the church previously had. Bishop Donovan reluctantly agrees and promises to call Father Leo. Frank thanks Bishop Donovan and leaves. At the school, the search reveals mostly bags of marijuana until the drug sniffing dog alerts Danny to a locker which holds two big bags of M-Cat belonging to a student named Wayne Foster. Danny goes into Wayne's algebra class and, when he makes an announcement as to who he is looking for, Wayne attempts to jump out the window. Danny puts Wayne in handcuffs as Jackie gets a phone call that two more people have overdosed.

At Danny's precinct, Danny interrogates Wayne by letting him know that he is facing three counts of criminally negligent homicide and multiple drug charges which would bring a lot of prison time. But Danny offers a way to help if Wayne helps get the drug off the streets by naming his supplier and anyone he sold the drugs to. Wayne admits that he had sold to Billy before, but not the time where Billy had overdosed. Danny asked who sold it to Billy in which Wayne replies that he doesn't know. Danny asks Wayne where he got the drugs to sell and Wayne admits he got them through the Internet on a site called Turbolist. Danny asks him to show him how it's done. Wayne shows him a listing that doubles as a code to buy drugs instead of a comic book that is listed. Danny has Wayne make an offer to purchase drugs to which he does. Jackie asks how long it would take for the seller to respond and almost immediately he does by answering cryptically. Wayne gives Danny a location as to where the drugs would be and at what time. Danny and Jackie head to a parcel post shop on a stakeout and he asks her if she has ever gotten high. Jackie admits that she did experiment a little when she dated a bass player in college, but nothing like the youth of the present day. A bike messenger arrives at the parcel post shop and Danny springs into action. They confront the messenger who has an envelope with Wayne's name on it and, when they ask the messenger where the envelope came from, he tells them it came from a local bike shop. Danny and Jackie approach the bike shop where there is a man waiting and, when he sees Danny approaching, he runs away. The man tries to run into traffic and avoid Danny, but ironically ends up running into a man on a bicycle. The man's name is David Carvell and, when he is returned to the bike shop in handcuffs, Jackie shows Danny a hidden drug lab in the back of the shop. David claims that his drugs are pure and the drugs he sells should be tested. Danny assures him that it will be and sends him away to be processed on drug charges.

At One Police Plaza, Frank is getting an update on his schedule and he sees the results of the drug test. At a bar, Jamie meets Danny and they start to celebrate solving the case with a beer when Jackie arrives with some news. The two overdoses that were called in when Wayne was arrested were not connected to the case. They died of a crystal meth overdose. The toxicity screen on the boys from the party showed that they had died from a lethal dose of potassium chloride. Jackie announces that potassium chloride is not used in recreational drugs. She further announces that the drugs seized at David's bike shop and the drugs that Wayne had did not have potassium chloride; therefore, David cannot be charged in the murders of the students at the party which puts Danny back at square one of the case. Danny asks, if David didn't use potassium chloride in the drugs, who did? Jackie suggests that Billy possibly did to give himself a better high. Jamie suggests that it could be somebody else who was looking to kill someone else. Jackie then suggests going back and talking to Alyson again. Danny agrees that it is a good idea when he gets a phone call saying that Alyson has been involved in an accident while she was out jogging.

Danny and Jackie arrive where Alyson is being treated by paramedics. Alyson went jogging to clear her head when a car came straight at her. She couldn't see the driver because the headlights blinded her. The driver of the car clipped Alyson and drove away. Jackie asks Alyson if she could make out the model of the car. Because it happened so fast, all Alyson could remember the car was medium sized, dark colored, and it may have had a bumper sticker of St. Angelus on it. Danny tells Alyson that she was deliberately poisoned from someone at school. He asks if she knows of anyone who might have reason to do so. Alyson names Caitlin as a possible suspect because she became angry that she and Billy had broken up. Alyson also tells Danny and Jackie that Caitlin has a journal full of bad things about her breakup with Billy and how much she hates Caitlin. Alyson further admits that she, Caitlin, and Billy all were in the same chemistry class where Alyson had seen Caitlin's journal.

At St. Angelus, Danny finds Caitlin's journal and Jackie finds a white powder in Caitlin's lab station. Jackie burns the white powder and finds out that it has potassium chloride in it when the powder turns violet. At Danny's precinct, Caitlin is being questioned again with Tom and a lawyer present. The lawyer argues that it is normal for teenage girls who get their heart broken to vent out in a journal and Caitlin admits that she loved Billy, but she would never really kill him. Jackie asks what about Alyson being with Billy. Caitlin admits that she no longer wanted Billy and that she had dumped him. Danny denies that statement. Caitlin tells Danny that Billy only wanted to get high with her and have sex which shocks Tom. Caitlin continues saying that Billy was pressuring her to do drugs with him, but she didn't want to because she felt that, if you were dating her, you wouldn't need them. She had also found out that Billy had been cheating on her which was enough to cause them to break up, but she didn't know who it was. Danny then switches the questioning to Alyson being run down with a car. Jackie asks where Caitlin was during the time of the accident and Tom immediately answers that she was at a pilates class. Caitlin admits that she did not go to her class and instead she was shopping. Danny asks for proof and Caitlin doesn't have any physical proof like a receipt, but she had been on Twitter while doing so. Danny announces that they would check out her alibi and ask her friends.

At the Reagan house at dinner, the family discusses how they used to keep the family away from drugs. Henry tells a story that he had Danny spend the night in a jail cell full of drunk people to scare them away from alcohol when they were both young. Jamie remembers that Frank did the same thing to him when he was eleven years old. Frank asks his grandson, Jack, how old he is. When Jack answers he is ten years old, the family groans at the table hinting that the same story may happen again. Nicky then announces that she feels that a lot of people believe drugs should be legal and uses medical marijuana in California as an example. Frank reminds the table that drugs are illegal in New York. Jamie agrees with Nicky which causes a debate between Jamie and Danny over the legalization of drugs at the table. Nicky adds that people should be able to what they want, but when Erin challenges her opinion, Nicky becomes offended and excuses herself from the table.

Frank goes after his granddaughter in the hallway and she apologizes for her behavior. Frank commends her for having some good points, but Nicky believes that her mother still treats her like a child. Frank reminds her that Nicky is not mad at her mother for having an opinion, but she had changed her mind about Nicky going into the city by herself. Nicky confesses that Erin doesn't talk to her much and that the night of the gala Erin cried the entire way to the Reagan house. Frank deduces that Erin was trying to be strong for her daughter as she had known how upset Nicky has been about her parents getting divorced. Frank asks Nicky if she knew what was happening the night of the gala. Nicky knew that Erin was becoming the president of the Children's Fund which Erin's mother had the same job before she had died. Frank suggests that Erin was thinking about how much she missed her mother. Nicky then suggests that Frank was doing the same thing to which he admits, but he also tells her that he was trying to be strong for his daughter as well. Frank tells Nicky that she and Erin need to look out for each other, understand each other and love each other. He then gives his granddaughter a kiss on the head.

The next morning at the precinct, Jackie confirms Caitlin's alibi that she was out shopping and she was nowhere near the scene of the accident. Danny asks that they go back to the school again to try and find the person who attacked Alyson twice and hope that the third time is not the charm they are looking for. As they return to the school, Father Leo confronts them and asks what they're doing there. He lets them know that concerned parents are asking questions. Danny tells him to let the parents know that he is trying to solve a triple homicide and a hit and run. Danny asks Father Leo if there is a dark sedan with a St. Angelus bumper sticker on it. Father Leo admits that a car like that could belong to anyone since the school has a large amount of the stickers available. Father Leo excuses himself as Danny checks out a dark sedan. He notices that there was a bumper sticker on the car which had been removed and the car had been recently washed. Jackie runs the plates on the car. On the front bumper he finds that some green paint had been scrubbed from the car. Jackie finds out that the car belongs to Vice Principal Hoffman.

Danny and Jackie run into the school and ask Father Leo about Vice Principal Hoffman. He tells them that the students admire her even though she handles disciplinary issues and handles disputes among the students. Jackie asks if there were any disputes with Billy. Father Leo answers that he was not aware of any issues and that Billy should have thanked Vice Principal Hoffman for not failing out of his sophomore year of school. Father Leo lets them know that Billy had issues in chemistry and that Vice Principal Hoffman tutored Billy in chemistry before she was promoted to Vice Principal. Danny and Jackie then go and talk to Vice Principal Hoffman. Danny asks if she in fact did teach Billy chemistry before she became Vice Principal to which she admits. Danny asks if Billy was a good student, Vice Principal Hoffman then said that Billy was an average student who did extra credit to pass. Danny then tells Vice Principal Hoffman that she should know where this line of questioning is going. Vice Principal Hoffman tries to leave to get Father Leo, but she is stopped. Jackie accuses her of hitting Alyson with the car and planting the potassium chloride in Caitlin's lab station, but Vice Principal Hoffman denies this. Danny then accuses her of having sex with Billy and, even though she attempts to deny it, Jackie makes her confess claiming that that mutually loved each other. Jackie then takes out her handcuffs and arrests her with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.

At One Police Plaza, Bishop Donovan meets with Frank over the case being solved. Bishop Donovan announces that he has been allowed to have a press conference stating that there will be no more issues being swept under the rug. Frank suggests that he would like to stand next to him at the press conference since he has helped out the family for many years to which Bishop Donovan happily agrees. At the Reagan house, Erin comes home after working late to find out that Frank, Henry, and Nicky have made all of Erin's favorite foods. Nicky proposes a toast to her grandmother and the four of them eat their meal together as Nicky says grace."

They tell the worker that they are looking for a man named Louie. The worker tells them that Louie doesn't work there anymore. The men do not believe the worker and they hassle him by dropping a box of peppers on the ground and threatening him with a gun. They ask again when Louie comes out of the store. He makes eye contact with the worker and yells out that he is working in the back which makes Louie run away and one of the men chase him down the street. The worker gets pistol whipped for his trouble from the other man. The chase ends when Louie runs into the street and is hit by a car. The car is driven by a man named Pablo. The man with the gun asks to shoot Louie in the street, but Pablo shoves him away. Louie believes his leg is broken and Pablo threatens him that, if he keeps talking to a district attorney, he won't be feeling pain anymore.

At Erin's office, she gets word that Louie has run away to Puerto Rico. Louie was supposed to be a witness against Pablo Torres. Erin goes to her computer and announces that she is going to bring up her Plan B. Erin plans on contacting Pablo's brother. At Danny's precinct, Jamie meets with his brother who announces that he has a gift for him. He gives Jamie a second set of collar pins and shows him a slapper. Jamie asks where he got it and he shows that it has the initials ""H.R."" The slapper belonged to Henry. Jamie declines the offer as Danny reminds him that he's not in college anymore. Outside Erin's office, the Manhattan District Attorney, Charlie Rosselini, holds a small press conference announcing that, although an election is coming in the year, he's going to keep his job until then. Erin approaches him and he asks if she is going after Pablo on charges of money laundering since other charges of murder, assault, and extortion have failed. Erin answers that she is not giving up, but finding another way. Charlie tells her that Pablo's brother, Esteban Torres, has led a proper life by earning an academic scholarship, becoming a math teacher, and opening a community learning center. Erin tells him that the center was opened with Pablo's dirty money and that she has discovered a money trail. Charles asks Erin if she believes Pablo is going to give himself up after his brother gets jammed up. Erin then reveals her plan: Instead of going after Pablo, Erin goes after Esteban, stating that if Esteban refuses to testify against he brother, he would go to jail. Charlie praises Erin and gives her to go ahead with her plan, but reminds her that an election is coming up. Any mistakes could discredit Charlie. Erin asks who would challenge him when in a previous election, Charlie had easily won. Charlie teases his plans by answering that he has his eyes on a higher office in mind.

At One Police Plaza, Frank is readying himself for a ceremony with Mayor Frank Russo. Mayor Russo reminds him that his position is civilian and asks why he is wearing his police uniform. Frank responds that he wears his uniform as a reminder to his previous work as a police officer. Mayor Russo then announces that Charlie wants to be the mayor. Frank believes that Charlie would go as high as the presidency. They both praise Charlie's work as district attorney, but Mayor Russo is worried that Charlie may be more popular then he is. Mayor Russo tells Frank that no one in the city is more popular then he is. Frank then tells Mayor Russo that he has no plans to run for Mayor. Mayor Russo is pleased by this and hopes that Frank would be standing at his side. The mayor then puts the focus onto him and suggests that Frank should appear with the mayor at a press conference for a formal announcement. Frank declines, saying that he doesn't do politics. The mayor starts to become angry and reminds Frank that he works for him. Frank reminds the mayor that he serves at his pleasure, but works for the people of New York and leaves.

At Erin's office, Esteban has been brought in for a meeting. Esteban tells Erin that his community learning center started out slow, but thanks to some funding it has become a positive part of the city. Erin reveals that the money had come from Pablo's illegal business. She shows him pictures of people with injuries and a picture of a corpse that have been victims of Pablo's illegal businesses. Esteban declares that he would never testify against his brother. In the city, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli have been called to an apartment building to guard the apartment of an elderly lady who has passed away until the medical examiner arrives. At One Police Plaza, Charlie meets with Frank at first to praise Erin's work as an attorney, but Frank suspects more. Charlie admits that he is looking for an endorsement from Frank to become mayor and assures him that his job as police commissioner is safe. Frank tries to cut the meeting short by dismissing him. Charlie reminds Frank that he served as a police officer for 10 years before becoming an attorney. Frank reminds him that he was more politician than police officer. As Charlie leaves, he hints that, if Frank doesn't endorse him, there could be a lot of collateral damage involved.

At the Community Learning Center, Erin gives Esteban until the end of the day to make a decision on whether he testifies against Pablo. Erin admits that testifying against Pablo can be emotional and suggests testifying for the grand jury in secret instead of open court. Esteban says that he can't go behind his brother's back like that. If he decides that he is going to testify, he should at least tell his brother first. Erin believes that is not a good idea. Esteban tells her that a gang wanted Esteban to join with them, but Pablo backed them off and has been protecting him since they were young. Esteban feels that everything positive he has done in his life has been because of Pablo. Erin says that Pablo is dangerous and asks Esteban how he thinks Pablo would react. Esteban scoffs at this saying that he has less to fear from Erin than his brother and walks away from the meeting.

At the Reagan house, Henry, Frank, Jamie, and Danny are all bonding over sandwiches and beer while watching hockey. Jamie declines a sandwich from his brother and Danny makes a joke about seeing a dead body. Jamie asks Danny if he was behind a prank to which Danny denies. Jamie announces that he had to burn his police uniform. Henry tells him that rookie police officers always get the worst possible police calls. Danny also tells Henry that Jamie denied taking Henry's blackjack. Frank reminds his father that they are not authorized anymore and they are outdated. Frank also reminds his son that he never carried a blackjack either causing Danny to say that his father never needed one since he had strong hands. Jamie ends the debate by saying the use of blackjack took place mostly after a suspect was handcuffed anyway. At a church in the city at night, Pablo meets his brother as Erin is on stakeout outside the church. Pablo asks if Esteban is in trouble and he admits that Erin is pressing him to testify against him. Esteban feels ashamed that he is even thinking about it. Pablo tells Esteban to let her do her job and do what he needs to do. Pablo isn't worried that Erin is attempting to shut him down. He claims that his lawyer can do a good job and he is not afraid of jail. Pablo praises his brother for making a good life for himself and leaves the meeting. He approaches Erin's car and gives her a look as he walks away.

Erin meets up with Danny at his precinct and asks for help in the case against Pablo. Danny asks why he needs to be the one helping when Erin has a police squad that is closer. Her squad is understaffed and have been pulling in overtime. Danny denies Erin. Erin tells him that Esteban testified in front of the grand jury and she could see how difficult it was for him. Danny then deduces that Pablo got to Erin. Erin offers to do whatever it takes to send Pablo to prison for a long time. Danny relents and agrees to help his sister. At the Reagan house, Jamie is waxing Frank's old car and they remember good times about Joe. Frank tells the story on what happened the night Joe died and then tells Jamie to take the car to his house since he no longer drives himself anymore. In a store at the city,

Danny and Detective Ava Hotchkiss question Omar Vasquez who was the man that got pistol whipped by Pablo's friends. They ask about Louie. Omar tells them that Louie doesn't work for him anymore. Danny reminds him that he is a witness in a murder investigation. Omar tells Danny that being a witness is bad for business which suggests that Louie is getting career counseling. Danny asks if Pablo is doing the counseling and Omar turns his head revealing a giant scar from when he got pistol whipped. Omar tells them that everyone in the neighborhood knows about Pablo, so why not ask them? Ana answers because Pablo came by looking to shoot Louie. Omar tells them that it wasn't Pablo who had the gun, and names his attacker with the nickname Grumpy. They thank Omar for the information and leave. In the city, Jamie meets up with Joe's ex-girlfriend, Angie. Angie is getting ready to move out of the city and move on with her life. Jamie asks her if on the night Joe died if he had seemed worried about anything. Angie has no answers for Jamie, but she did find a box full of Joe's things and gives them to him. Jamie thanks Angie and leaves. At Erin's office a warrant has been issued based off Esteban's testimony. Erin reminds her officer to be safe. The officer arrives at the club and finds Pablo over a table dead in a pool of blood. Erin gets the call and orders that Esteban be found. Whoever killed Pablo could be targeting Esteban next.

Erin meets with Esteban expressing sorrow for Pablo dying. Esteban asks who killed him. Erin answers that they don't know. Esteban answers that he knows and confesses. Erin denies his confession saying there was a leak after Esteban testified at the grand jury. Back at the crime scene, Danny and Ava figure out that Pablo had plans to go to prison, but he wanted to make his affairs in place. Instead, he ended up getting shot for his troubles. Danny also notices that Pablo's chain with a crown on it is missing. Erin meets with her officer again and gets surveillance from a camera outside the club where Pablo was shot. After watching the footage, Danny spots the same two gang members that met with Omar and the same gun that was used when he got pistol whipped. Danny sets up another raid and arrests Grumpy. Jamie is in the city picking up his clean uniform and he calls his girlfriend, Sydney, to set up a dinner date. Sydney tells him that she has to finish a 500 page deposition, but if she finishes it, she offers to meet up with him late, to which Jamie agrees. As he puts his uniform in the trunk of the car, he looks in the box that Angie had given him. He finds the owner's manual to the car he is driving and an iPod. As he scrolls through the music tracks on the iPod, he hears a recording of Joe's voice. Joe records that in the next day he is going to have a big meeting with The Blue Templar. He also records that his FBI informant has been unexpectedly changed, but he sounds confident that all will be revealed in the next day.

At the police precinct, Danny questions Grumpy whose real name is Israel Beltran. He asks for his lawyer and Ava tells him that he better have a good lawyer because they have the surveillance footage of him entering and exiting the club and that the gun matches the bullets that were retrieved from Pablo. Danny suggests that, once he runs the gun for more tests, Israel will more than likely be linked to another unsolved separate homicide. Danny wants Israel to confess to all of the illegal activity that has been going on in his neighborhood. Israel remains defiant saying that anyone who snitches ends up dead. Erin goes to Charlie asking for protection for Esteban. Charlie argues that there is no case since Pablo is dead. Erin argues, since Israel is brazen enough to threaten Esteban in front of two detectives, that the case is still possible. Charlie dismisses this as simple trash talking. He also suggests that Erin focus on cases that can actually be prosecuted. Erin fires back saying that people won't cooperate if her office turns away from Esteban. Charlie relents saying that if Esteban chooses to give information on Pablo's gang, he would offer protection for him. Erin meets with Esteban at his school and he rejects Erin's offer saying that he will not testify against Pablo's gang even after Erin begs him for help.

At the Reagan house, Henry is practicing cooking a dinner for an upcoming Sunday dinner. Erin asks where her father is and Henry tells her that he had a phone call to make. Henry asks if he can help. Erin tells her grandfather about Esteban not wanting to testify. Henry tells her a similar story when he was a police captain and Frank was a detective. In a mob related shooting, a witness declines police protection and after signing paperwork, Frank takes the paper, puts in his coat pocket, and goes to live with the witness for a week. When the mob came to confront the witness, Frank protected him and threw someone down three flights of stairs which caused the witness to properly testify against the mob. Frank calls Danny about how after a gang leader gets taken out a lot of members of the gang start trying to better their positions in the gang. Danny agrees that Israel's partner, Chavo, would be next on the list. Frank suggests arranging a meeting under their terms to which Danny believes he can put that together. Danny makes a plan that he is going to contact Chavo from a separate phone pretending to be Israel. Ava asks if Danny has a search warrant to legally put this plan into motion. Danny goes along with the plan anyway since there is no time to get a search warrant. Ava reluctantly goes along with the plan. Danny texts Chavo. Chavo is shocked that Israel could be able to text from jail. Danny sends another text saying that his lawyer hooked him up with a phone and that Esteban is being moved into protective custody that night. Chavo texts back that the job would be done. Danny and Ava leave the precinct as Chavo and two of his friends arrive at the education center. Esteban is there closing up the center for the night. Danny grabs Esteban from inside the center and gives the go ahead to go after the gang members. During the small fight that breaks out, Danny uses his grandfather's blackjack. Esteban asks Danny if Erin was the one that sent the police and Danny confesses so and tells him that now Esteban needs to testify.

At the Reagan family dinner, the family is trying to eat the duck that Henry tried to cook, but they complain that it is burned. Frank praises Danny and Erin for taking down Pablo's gang, but she claims that it is bittersweet because the learning center had to close down due to lack of funding. Danny thanks Henry for the use of his blackjack and sarcastically thanks Jamie for not using it. Jamie retorts by hoping that Danny does not get investigated again from Internal Affairs. This causes an uneasy situation at the table and Sydney tries to calm the situation down. Danny tells his brother to listen to his girlfriend. Jamie asks why Danny is being so hard on him and they continue going back and forth at the table which results in Jamie leaving the table. Danny goes to talk to Jamie, but it stopped by Frank who gets up from the table. Outside the house, Frank lights a cigar and Jamie apologizes for his attitude. He is upset about being treated as a rookie all the time and Frank tells him that Danny is just trying to teach him everything he knows about being a police officer. He also says that Danny is being tough on him to make him seem bulletproof. He further tells him to treat his job every day as if there is going to be trouble because one day there will be and that Danny can't handle the possibility of losing another brother. Jamie realizes this.

At One Police Plaza, Charlie has been called in by Frank and he praises him for the closing of the gang related case. Charlie praises Erin's work on the case and suggests that all she needs is a little guidance from Frank. The only negative part of the case was the closing of the education center. Frank then suggests that, if a candidate wanted to further his chances for running for mayor, they could improve if a right decision was made. At the education center, a ceremony takes place after Charlie has made a large donation which helps reopen the center. Frank, Erin, and Henry watch the ceremony on the news and Erin asks if Frank had anything to do with the center being reopened to which he denies. In a courtroom, Erin asks Esteban if he can identify the men who tried to kill him. He points out Chavo and his two assistants. He further testifies that Pablo helped him establish the learning center even though he may have done some bad things in his life. During the testimony, Jamie entered the courtroom and takes Esteban's words about having a brother to heart as he sits next to Danny in the courtroom."

She tells him that she is pleased to have received a phone call and is finally ready to get to work on investigating The Blue Templar. Jamie tells her that he is out. She then tells him that she understands that he has reservations and the risk of the investigation is high, but she offers the full support of the FBI. Jamie declines and goes to leave. She stops him by saying that he has invested a lot of time to find out the truth about Joe's death and defending Frank's honor. Jamie tells her that is the reason he wants no further part in the case. He then tells her it's about family business and leaves.

As he rounds a corner into another section of Chinatown, he finds two Asian men screaming at two Asian women. One of the men threatens one of the women with a gun. Jamie takes his badge out from under his shirt and draws his weapon. He identifies himself as a police officer and orders the man to drop his weapon. The men flee the scene with one running away and the other getting into a car, almost hitting Jamie. Jamie chases the man back into the main area of Chinatown. The man runs into an intersection and is hit by a taxi. Jamie reaches the man, checks for a pulse, and reports that he is off duty and needs an ambulance immediately. The crime scene turns busy as ambulances and police cars swarm the area. Jamie has called his father, Frank, who was having dinner at a restaurant. Frank asks if he was hurt to which Jamie announces to his father that he is all right, but he didn't want to make the problem worse for calling him. Frank reminds him that, as long as he tells the truth, all would be fine. Frank then gets another alert and has to hang up the phone.

Danny has arrived on the scene and he checks on his brother making sure he is all right. Danny asks if Jamie had spoken to anyone and Jamie admits that he gave a statement to Detective Tuan. Danny then asks Jamie what had happened. Jamie tells his brother that he may have seen some of a group known as The Asian Triad who kidnap illegal immigrants and try to get ransom money from their families in China. Jamie is certain that one of the men had a gun, but when he searched the suspect the gun went missing. Danny tells Jamie that a gun tossed on the street in Chinatown wouldn't stay there for long. Jamie also tries to tell Danny about the two Asian women who were being attacked and Danny tells him it would be difficult to find two specific Asians in Chinatown. Danny asks Jamie what he was doing in Chinatown since he was off duty. Jamie tells him he was just walking around after his shift. Danny warns Jamie that Internal Affairs is going to question him wanting to know who he was talking to and what he was doing. He tells him to make sure he has his story straight and he is glad that Jamie is all right.

Back at the restaurant, Frank is speaking to Chief Flores who is part of Internal Affairs. Frank asks him if it policy for him to be called every time an investigation of a police officer has started. He scolds him telling him that this conversation shouldn't take place. As he is finishing up his conversation, Kelly Davidson, who Frank had broken up his relationship (Episode 1.3 Privilege) comes into the restaurant. They make eye contact as Kelly is led to her table, but she returns to talk with Frank. She compliments him on the case, although the mayor took all the credit for it. Kelly asks Frank how he is doing and he responds with the same question. She replies that she is working too hard. Frank acknowledges that working hard is a hazard in both their fields of work. Kelly admits that she misses Frank and that she made mistakes in the case. As Frank is about to reply, he is interrupted by Councilman Welch. They shake hands and Frank introduces the Councilman to Kelly. He then excuses himself and leaves.

Back at the crime scene, the dead man is identified as Grant Lee by Detective Tuan. Grant was a foot soldier in one of the Triads that operate in Chinatown. Detective Jackie Curatola asks if the driver has been found. Detective Tuan says that they are looking for a blue Subaru Impreza. Danny announces that Internal Affairs is going to be with Jamie so he feels that solving the crime would be the best way to help him out. Danny asks Detective Tuan about Jamie seeing two girls. Jamie described them as two Chinese women in their mid twenties with shoulder length black hair. Detective Tuan says that the description is too generic. Danny asks if there were any eyewitnesses and Detective Tuan confirms that there weren't. Danny looks over his shoulder and remembers Jamie saying that one of the women had a scratch on her forehead. He points out a woman in the crowd and goes to talk to her. As they approach, the woman shows that she is scared and Danny tries to calm her down by saying that he would like to talk to her. Detective Tuan speaks to her in Chinese and they go to Danny's precinct.

At the precinct, Danny asks the woman how she got the scratch on her forehead. She responds that she fell down. Danny asks to see her hands and doesn't find any marks on them which tells him that she was lying to him. He suggests that somebody pushed her up against a wall while trying to kidnap the other lady involved. Jackie comes up and announces that Grant had been arrested for assault and bribery. Danny shows the woman pictures of Grant's associates, but she denies recognizing them. Danny tells her that he doesn't believe her. Danny reminds her that her friend is in danger and it would be better if he found her before the Triad does. Jackie assures her that her immigration status doesn't matter in this case. The woman names the other woman as Ming-Tai, but she does not call her a friend. They only had just met each other. Jackie asks if she has a last name, but the woman doesn't know it. Danny asks her where does she live. She answers, ""Gong si fong"" and offers to show them where it is. She also admits that they lived together, but she moved because of trouble.

At Jamie and Sydney's apartment, as Sydney is preparing dinner she tells Jamie that he should have called 911 and waited for backup. Jamie tells her that there wasn't enough time for that to happen. Jamie tries to tell her that he is all right and he didn't get hurt. Sydney agrees with him, but she reminds him that another police officer had been killed when she walked into a crime scene (Episode 1.4 Officer Down). He tries to tell her that he is standing right in front of her, safe and sound. Sydney asks what's going to happen the next time? Jamie doesn't give an answer. At One Police Plaza, Frank is being told by his assistant, Detective Abigail Baker, that the story regarding Jamie and the crime has made it across the city's newspapers. Frank asks what else is on his agenda and Abigail tells him about a successful arrest in a string of taxicab robberies and a press conference on a security initiative, but the focus is going to be on Jamie's incident in Chinatown. Abigail respectfully tells Frank not to minimize the importance of the incident. Frank is aware of the situation and thanks Baker. Frank puts on his glasses and begins to read the paper that has a full cover page story of the incident.

Frank then takes out his cell phone and calls Danny. On the phone, Frank commends his grandson, Jack, making a touchdown in a recent football game. Danny asks if Frank is truly asking about football or about the missing woman Jamie talked about. Frank tells his son if he was calling as the police commissioner, he would be reminding his lead detective that the case is politically sensitive. Danny tells Frank that he is in a one bedroom apartment shared by 30 Asian women who take turns sleeping on mattresses. Frank tells him what he is seeing is the ""Gong si fong"" that Danny learned about from the woman he questioned. Danny tells him he is looking for Jamie's missing kidnap victim, but with so many Gong si fong going on in the city it's not going good. Frank asks about the car, Danny announces that some information just came in and he will call him back. Detective Tuan tells Danny that there is no further information on Ming-Tai even though she had lived in a Gong si fong for over a year. A lot of the women had just come overseas from China and they fear cops, but they fear the gangsters even more. At a press conference, Frank is announcing that 500 new cameras are being installed in the city's bus system. When he allows questions to be asked, Kelly makes a statement that no one has come forward confirming Jamie's case in Chinatown. Frank fires back that Kelly did not ask a question. Kelly asks if Jamie's case is being treated specially because Jamie is Frank's son. Frank defiantly answers no and takes another question.

Jamie is being questioned by Lieutenant Alex Bello of Internal Affairs and Jamie has an attorney named Kenneth Weber with him. Lieutenant Bello asks Jamie if he knew or ever spoke to Grant. Jamie answers no to both questions. Lieutenant Bello asks why did Jamie stop Grant and talk to him. Jamie answers that he saw Grant and another man assault and try to kidnap two Asian women. Jamie testifies that he identified himself as a police officer and told the men to stop. Lieutenant Bello reminds him that he was off duty and asks why he didn't call 911. Jamie answers that he believes that any other police officer would do the same thing. Lieutenant Bello admits that, although the reasoning sounded good, there are no eyewitnesses to confirm Jamie's story. Jamie tells the Lieutenant that the alley was deserted and that's why it was chosen for a crime to take place. Lieutenant Bello asks Jamie why he was in Chinatown at that time of night. Jamie tells him that his apartment isn't far from the crime scene and he was talking a walk. Lieutenant Bello asks if Jamie was having dinner with someone or meeting a friend. Jamie denies both of those suggestions. Lieutenant Bello then tells Jamie that he has eyewitnesses who have said that they saw Jamie talking to a woman with red hair. Attorney Weber reminds Lieutenant Bello that Jamie only has to answer questions regarding the case. Jamie then challenges Lieutenant Bello saying that he can't believe that people saw him talking to a person with red hair, but no one saw the crime taking place. Lieutenant Bello tells Jamie that women with red hair are not common in that neighborhood and they are noticeable. Jamie then tells Lieutenant Bello that it was a tourist who was looking to buy fake designer bags. Lieutenant Bello asks for the tourist's information and Jamie tells him he doesn't have it since he sent the woman on her way. Lieutenant Bello ends the questioning and tells Jamie that the police commissioner has given him orders to be extra rigorous in their investigation. Jamie expects nothing less and the lieutenant leaves.

At Danny's precinct, Jackie has found a picture of a similar Subaru Impreza, but it was in a different neighborhood. Jackie has run the plates and finds out that the car belongs to Nelson Chiu and they get an address on him. Danny calls Jamie and asks him to meet at Nelson Chiu's last known location. At a Chinatown restaurant, Nelson Chiu is eating dinner and smoking a cigarette. Danny and Jackie approach him and ask to speak with him outside. He tells Danny that he is eating, Danny corrects him and tells him that he is smoking in a restaurant which is illegal. Danny takes Nelson's cigarette and snuffs it out in Nelson's dinner. Nelson then blows smoke in Danny's face and is dragged out of the restaurant. Another person tries to tell Nelson what to do in Cantonese, but Jackie warns him and tells him to stay put. Jackie checks Nelson for weapons and Danny calls over Jamie who was waiting in his squad car. Jamie identifies Nelson as the driver of the car and Danny arrests Nelson.

Back at Danny's precinct, Nelson denies knowing who Ming-Tai is and demands his lawyer. Danny tells him he is stuck in traffic. Danny asks why he was trying to kidnap Ming-Tai. He answers by pretending not to speak English. Danny then shows him pictures of the website he owns. The site is for an escort service. Nelson claims that his site is legitimate, but he still has no idea who Ming-Tai is. Danny goes to tell Nelson how much he hates him when Danny gets interrupted that Erin has arrived to talk to him. Erin has to give Danny the news that he has to let Nelson go. Erin reminds him that he cannot charge Nelson on a weapons charge if there is no weapon. Danny tells her that Jamie positively identified Nelson and that he had a gun. Erin tells him that, during the incident, Nelson could've had a water pistol for all she knew and that she won't be prosecuting the case. Danny asks for a compromise and Erin says the best that can be done is that Nelson be charged with misdemeanor assault charges otherwise he was going to walk free on bail the next day.

At the Reagan house, Frank makes himself a sandwich and apologizes to Henry for waking him up. Henry tells him he couldn't sleep anyway and remembers a story about a police officer who almost got in trouble when Henry was the police commissioner. Somebody had told Henry that a cop was skimming money from people who had been arrested in cases involved with drugs. The Chief of Internal Affairs contacted Henry and told him about it saying he might like to talk to the officer in question. Henry told him that he wasn't going to talk to the officer, but to put his best investigator on the case. The Chief then set up a couple of fake drug busts and Henry found out that Frank was the cop in question. Frank tells his father that he was never told about this in his career. Henry then had to sit back and watch Frank get investigated and that it pained him greatly to watch something like that happen to his son. Henry tells his son that every father has the instinct to protect his children.

At Erin's office, Nicky is asking Erin questions for a school project. She asks why Erin didn't become a police officer. Erin tells her that Danny, Jamie, and Joe always wanted to be policemen because they were playing like policemen when they were children. Erin never felt to play that way. Nicky asks Erin if she wanted to be a lawyer. Erin answers yes. She wanted to serve the law differently. She then admits that sometimes she doesn't agree with the police officers she works with. Nicky asks about the time her uncle Danny shoved a suspect's head into a toilet (Pilot, Episode 1.1). Erin praises her brother, but admits that at times he can get carried away. She also tells Nicky that her Uncle Danny would protect her no matter what. Nicky asks what kind of trouble and Erin refuses to answer that question when she gets a phone call. Danny has called Erin to tell him that Nelson has just been murdered in the city. Danny believes that a member of the Triad shot him. Erin suggests that Danny drop the case since there is no victim and both suspects are dead, but Danny refuses.

As Danny examines the car, he finds a piece of paper from the Mott Street Munificent Society. Detective Tuan tells Danny it's a community service center that teaches English, offers free legal advice, and they have a medical clinic. Danny asks if they are connected with Nelson's Triad. Detective Tuan doesn't know if that is so. Jackie comes up and announces that the medical examiner who did an autopsy on Grant found somebody else's blood on him and that it belonged to a woman, possibly Ming-Tai. The medical examiner also found that the woman is pregnant. Danny remembers Wai-Chee, the woman he questioned, that she never said anything about Ming-Tai being pregnant. Danny asks if the medical examiner had figured out how far along in the pregnancy the woman was. Jackie tells him that the woman is in her third trimester. Detective Tuan figures out that, if the woman is Ming-Tai and she is pregnant, she wouldn't be working as an escort anymore. Danny asks what would the Triad still want with Ming-Tai. They don't answer. In Chinatown, a pregnant woman is shown walking and when she walks toward three Triad members, she turns around and walks away.

Danny, Jackie, and Detective Tuan decide to investigate at the Munificent Society. The owner's name is Dennis Eng. They ask about Nelson. Dennis tells them that they help a lot of people and when he searches for Nelson's name it comes up empty. Danny asks if Dennis does any work with gangs or triads. Dennis tells him that he offers a basketball program to deter teenagers from joining gangs. Jackie asks if the name Ming-Tai sounds familiar. Dennis offers to search, but needs a last name. Danny's attention gets caught when he sees a pregnant Asian woman being led into the medical clinic. Danny excuses himself to check out the clinic, but Dennis tries to stop him saying it's not a good time to do so. Danny tries to ask a receptionist about Ming-Tai, but she answers in Chinese. Dennis admits that he provides free medical services to people who can't afford them. Jackie asks if they can continue looking around. Dennis doesn't allow them to do so. Danny asks why not? Dennis explains that a lot of his clients are illegal immigrants and that he is frightening them. Dennis orders them to leave. They leave, but Danny grabs a flyer with Chinese writing on it. Detective Tuan translates the flyer as an advertisement for an adoption agency. He further translates saying that if ""a woman is single and pregnant, or married and can't afford a child, you can put it up for adoption and be rewarded"". Jackie suggests being rewarded with money. Detective Tuan agrees. Danny then deduces that Ming-Tai got pregnant, and wants to be paid for giving up her baby.

Danny and Jackie find Wai-Chee who admits Ming-Tai's plan. Wai-Chee tells them that Ming-Tai was offered five thousand dollars to give up her baby to an American doctor who only works at the clinic on Thursdays. Danny and Jackie then interview a fertility doctor. The doctor doesn't see how talking to him could help Danny's case. Jackie asks if the doctor works at the Munificent Society. The doctor admits that he does pro bono work for them. Danny adds that he does that on Thursdays and the doctor confirms this. Danny asks the doctor if he has seen the adoption advertisement. The doctor answers that he hasn't. Jackie tells him what the advertisement says. The doctor says that he wouldn't be involved in something like this; his fertility practice is a thriving business. Danny goes to leave, but then asks how much does a fertility treatment cost. The doctor admits that it costs anywhere between twelve and fifteen thousand dollars. Danny suggests that the doctor could receive as much as fifty thousand dollars for a healthy Chinese baby to be born. The doctor becomes offended by this suggestion and leaves.

At a hot dog stand in the city, Sgt. Renzulli is buying a hot dog. He tells Jamie that he had a meeting with Internal Affairs. Jamie asks what was said. Sgt. Renzulli tells him that he can't tell him because of confidentiality. Jamie understands. Sgt. Renzulli tells him that Internal Affairs wanted to know if he had done anything unusual during his shift. Jamie asks what would've been called unusual. Sgt. Renzulli tells him if he had made any phone calls asking to meet someone or if he was wearing women's clothing, but that part of the story was a joke. Sgt. Rezulli tells him that he believes that the focus of the investigation has been turned onto a woman with red hair whom Jamie had said was a tourist. Jamie tells Sgt. Renzulli that he had no idea who she was. Sgt. Renzulli tells Jamie that saying that is going to keep them curious. He then tells Jamie that although he jokes around a lot, he should take the advice of telling Internal Affairs who the woman was. If it leads to problems at home, so be it. Jamie can be forgiven by his girlfriend, but if loses his name or his job, he can never get it back. Jamie takes his words to heart.

Back at Danny's precinct, Jackie has brought up a picture of the doctor, Warren Wakefield, and his wife, Nancy, who is Asian. A background check shows that the doctor and his wife have a clean record. Danny bets Jackie ten dollars on what Nancy's maiden name is. Jackie agrees to the bet, saying that Nancy was Nelson's sister. Danny says he believes Nancy's maiden name was the same as Dennis' last name. Jackie brings up the search and Danny wins the bet. At the Reagan house, Frank is reading a newspaper late at night when Jamie comes in. Jamie tells his father he is questioning himself if he has done the right thing. Frank assures him that he did and that any one of the family would do the same thing. Frank admits that the academy gave him skills and the streets give him experience, but it all comes down to instinct. Jamie says that because of the Internal Affairs investigation he feels like a suspect. Frank tells him that he can't talk about that. Frank tells Jamie that Danny and Joe went through the same struggles when they were police officers, but it never reached the front page of the newspapers. Frank admits knowing Lieutenant Bello as well. He admits that he is tough, but fair. He also admits that he investigated the fellow officers in Joe's squad when he died. Frank then changed the subject asking if Jamie has eaten anything. Jamie says that he hasn't and he should head home. Frank asks if something is on his mind and Jamie thanks his father for the talk and leaves.

At Jamie's apartment, Jamie looks up the story on the night Joe died. He highlights the names of two off Joe's former officers, Sonny Malevsky and Lydia Gonsalves. Sydney wakes up in her bed when she realizes that Jamie isn't asleep. She tells him that Lieutenant Bello came to visit her and asked if she and Jamie had a fight and if everything was fine between them. She answered that everything was fine, but then admits to Jamie she really doesn't know, even when Jamie is with her, he's not. Jamie denies this. Sydney then tells Jamie that she has been offered a job working in London for six months. Jamie starts to tell her that he can't move to London, but she stops him knowing that he can't do so but she can and she wants to. Jamie tells her that he was meant to be a police officer. Sydney knows this and tells him that she loves him too much to stand in his way. She then takes off her engagement ring, hands it to him, and walks away.

In the city, Erin meets with Danny telling him that Dr. Wakefield has a lot of mortgages and that he has been skimming money from his properties to live a lavish lifestyle. Danny deduces that he is spending more than his private practice brings in, but wonders where he gets the cash to make payments. In her investigation, Erin finds that wire transfers of up to seventy thousand dollars a month take place four or five times a month. The last transfer took place five days prior from a couple who had paid by check. Erin then excuses herself as she is late for court. Danny thanks his sister for the good work she has done. Danny and Jackie visit and question the couple. They tell them that they tried four times to use fertility treatments and finally Dr. Wakefield suggest that they adopt a Chinese baby. The man asks why they are being questioned about Dr. Wakefield. Danny asks what they were told about where the baby would come from. They tell Danny that the baby would be coming from China and someone would bring the baby to them. The man tells them that the doctors wife had political connections so they wouldn't have to fly to China to bring the baby home. Jackie then tells the couple about the case. Danny asks when the baby would be expected. The man says any day now. This worries the woman as she feels she is going to lose another baby. Danny and Jackie leave and Danny realizes that the couple and Ming-Tai had no idea what they were getting themselves into. Jackie suggests that after nine months Ming-Tai decided not to give up her baby. Danny replies that the Triad doesn't care about maternal bonding and they would go to any lengths to get her baby.

At Danny's precinct, Dr. Wakefield and his wife are be questioned further, but Dr. Wakefield refuses to talk until his lawyer gets there. Danny tells him if he wants to save somebody it should be Ming-Tai because if the Triad gets to her first, he could be facing a charge of accessory to murder. Nancy doesn't understand and Jackie tells her what she thinks is going to happen to Ming-Tai since she has refused to give up her baby. Nancy pleads with her husband, but he remains defiant. Danny sarcastically remarks that waiting for the lawyer is a good idea, because by the time he gets to the precinct and tells the doctor to confess, Ming-Tai would be dead anyway. Danny asks when she is due to give birth and Nancy answers soon. Dr. Wakefield again tells his wife to be quiet and Jackie gets called away from the questioning. Danny then continues with his sarcasm, telling them not to worry, the baby would be fine anyway and that Ming-Tai wouldn't be needed anymore. Jackie gets word that a squad of police officers has arrived at the Munificent Society and that he is going to arrest Dennis. He asks them one final time if they have anything to say and Dr. Wakefield remains quiet. Nancy starts to confess that Ming-Tai is not at the Munificent Society and Dr. Wakefield angrily tells his wife to remain quiet. This causes Jackie to tell Dr. Wakefield to be quiet and allow his wife to speak. Nancy then confesses the entire operation was Dennis' idea. Dennis would bring in poor Asian women and allow them to become pregnant, and then sell the babies to people that couldn't have children. Jackie asks if Nancy realizes that selling babies is illegal. Nancy claims the money was going to benefit the girls and themselves, but Dennis got involved with the Triad and now the Wakefields pay them a percentage to watch the girls. Jackie asks if this is what is happening to Ming-Tai, and Nancy confirms this. Danny asks where she is and Nancy confesses that the Triad has there own doctor named Yi at an office close to the Munificent Society.

In the doctors office, Ming-Tai is tied to a gurney with a gag in her mouth. The doctor goes to administer a labor inducing drug with a Triad member pointing a gun at them. Danny and Jackie arrive at the office wearing bulletproof vests and they have their guns drawn. Danny kicks open the door and shoots the Triad member. He shoves the doctor into a wall and saves Ming-Tai assuring that no one is going to take her baby away from her. Jackie calls for an ambulance and the case is solved. Back at Jamie's precinct, Lieutenant Bello tells Jamie that the woman he has been talking to has come forward. He calls in a red headed woman named Kathleen Ryan. Jamie recognizes her as Agent Anderson. Lieutenant Bello asks Kathleen if Jamie is the officer she talked to in Chinatown. Kathleen confirms that it was so, although Jamie wasn't wearing his police uniform. He asks if they had a conversation. She answers that it wasn't really a conversation, but she had asked for directions to Canal Street. She also says that she wanted to do some shopping in the city to buy a Gucci bag, but she wanted to buy a knockoff because you can't really tell the difference. Lieutenant Bello asked what she did after talking with Jamie. She answers that she started walking towards Canal Street. He then asks what did Jamie do after the conversation was over and she replies that she didn't know. Lieutenant Bello than thanks her and dismisses her. Kathleen then lets Lieutenant Bello know that she had seen Jamie's story in the paper and because he helped her, she decided to help him in return. Lieutenant Bello then announces that the investigation is over.

At the Reagan house, the family is having their Sunday dinner. Nicky makes an announcement at the table that she wants to be the first female of the family to become a cop. Henry praises his great granddaughter and Erin asks if that is why Nicky was asking her all those questions. Nicky was happy for her mother's honesty, but she wants to keep the family tradition of being a police officer. Jamie comes in late and hears the news and then tells his niece that being a police officer is complicated and a commitment, and he admits that he didn't know what he was getting into, but he wouldn't trade for anything which the rest of the family praise him for as they continue with their dinner."

She begs him to kill her when he calls her by her name which is Becky. The man then announces that they are still having fun and puts the knife to her face. This is revealed to be a dream sequence as Becky screams and jumps up in her bed. On her face is a scar. She picks up a newspaper with a picture of her attacker and the headline reads, ""Killer Rapist Walks Free"". At One Police Plaza, Frank asks the District Attorney from The Bronx how the judge ruled on a case. The District Attorney answers that a felony conviction was voided due to tainted DNA evidence. Frank remarks that 3 out of the 5 district attorneys in the other boroughs of New York have gotten the same result in their cases. He thanks the attorney and dismisses him. Detective Abigail Baker announces that the District Attorney from Manhattan is next on the agenda and Frank allows for him to be sent in. Erin walks into Frank's office. They greet each other as Commissioner and Counselor instead of father and daughter. Frank asks for an update on a case and Erin announces they she has found a way to retry one of her cases to which Frank is pleased. Erin then tells her that a judge is possibly going to vacate a conviction on a case involving a pedophile that she is trying. Frank asks how she feels the judge will rule. Erin answers that she is worried, but not as worried about the case involving Dick Reed. He is the man from the newspaper and was eventually set free. Erin has tried to speak to Becky three times in an attempt to make her testify against Dick, but to no avail. Becky is the only victim of Dick's to survive her attack by escaping from Dick after setting her bindings on fire as she was tied to a burning bed. In the previous case, there was enough DNA evidence to link Dick to the murders he did, but since Becky was in such a fragile state, her case was never tried. Frank declares that Dick will be constantly watched and is certain that Erin will find a way to put him back in prison. Baker gets an alert that the next attorney on Frank's agenda has arrived and Frank dismisses her to attend to him. Frank then sits down next to his daughter and asks where her boss, Charlie Rossellini, is. Erin announces that Charlie was on his way to Arizona. Frank remarks how nice it was for him to drop a lot of work on her. Erin defends Charlie by saying that he was scheduled to speak at a conference for District Attorneys a few months back. Frank teases and reminds Erin that Charlie had taken the credit for putting people away, but when some things happen he leaves for somebody else to clean up the mess. Erin goes to leave and Frank gives his daughter a kiss on the cheek.

In the city, Danny and Jackie are on a street corner drinking coffee. Danny complains to Jackie that he took a lot of time to arrest Dick, but thanks to the lab worker who tainted the evidence, Dick gets to walk out of jail. A Department of Corrections bus pulls up. Dick gets off and is met by a small group of fans and a few reporters. He signs autographs as if he were a celebrity. Dick hails a taxi as Danny and Jackie approach him. Danny gives Dick a friendly slap on the shoulder and asks why he is in such a hurry to leave. Dick remembers Danny from his trial and remembers that he gave vivid testimony on a victim named Katie Snow. Danny sarcastically offers Dick a ride since he is going to be watching him. Dick scoffs at him and warns him that, if Danny wants to keep his badge, he needs to leave him alone and cites the penal code for harassment. Dick goes to leave in his taxi and Danny tells him to enjoy his reprieve and that it won't last long. Dick retorts that it was nice to see him and refers to Jackie as his girlfriend. She corrects him as being Danny's partner and Dick leaves in his taxi. An unmarked car with two detectives pulls up next to Danny and he orders them to keep a close watch on Dick. They agree and follow the taxi.

At a press conference, Mayor Frank Russo announces that the release of prisoners due to faulty DNA testing is not a good day for the city of New York. He reminds the people that these kind of problems happened before he came into office, but since he is the mayor now, he intends to clean up the mess. He announces that the lab technician in question has been terminated from his job and more people will be held responsible for their actions. A reporter asks how something like this could happen with the testing of DNA. Mayor Russo passes the question to the person who oversees the Committee for Public Safety, Councilwoman Collins. She comes up to the microphone and answers that the city relies too much on DNA testing and in the last decade the number of cases relying on DNA testing have nearly tripled. She also announces that there is not enough funding to supplement this and suggests that the NYPD go back to investigating hair, fibers and fingerprints. She then passes the microphone to Frank who is standing at the side of the mayor and he reluctantly approaches the microphone. Frank announces that he doesn't have a problem with the funding and assures that he will make sure that nothing similar will happen like this again. Kelly Davidson was reporting in the crowd and she makes a statement to Frank saying that dangerous criminals have been released into the city. Frank then makes a statement of his own saying that it his intention to keep the people in the city of New York safe.

At an apartment building in the city, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli have been called to meet Rosie Guiterrez. She lets the officers know that her ex-husband, Mondo Guiterrez, was recently let out of prison because of a bad DNA case. Sgt. Renzulli is aware of the situation saying that the first thing Mondo had done was violate an order of protection which Rosie confirms. Mondo was across the street looking at his former house with a look. She declares that she feels afraid for herself and her son. Jamie asks if Mondo was at least the legal distance away from her and she confirms this. Rosie reminds them that Mondo killed the man she was seeing after her and Mondo had broken up and that Mondo has a violent temper. Rosie also reminds them that Mondo had said, if he can't have her, no one else should as well. Sgt. Renzulli asks if Mondo is there now, Rosie denies this. Sgt. Renzulli then must tell Rosie, since Mondo isn't in the area, there is nothing they can do. He then tells her, if he does show up again, to do the same thing she did before: call 911 and they will return to make sure she is safe.

At Erin's office, Erin calls for her assistant to bring her some files. Her assistant announces that Becky has come by to visit and she tells Erin that she is willing to testify against Dick. Erin is pleased to hear this. Becky made the decision after seeing Dick on television smiling and waving to his fans. Seeing this made her so sick that she decided to testify. Erin tells Becky that her testimony will put Dick back in prison for the rest of his life. Erin also promises Becky that she will have police protection and they are already watching him. This doesn't convince Becky that she will be safe since Dick had previously broken into her apartment five years prior. Becky tells Erin that Dick can get into places without being seen or heard. Erin reassures her that is not going to happen. Becky agrees with Erin, but says that she just wants Dick out of her head. It has been five years and every time she closes her eyes to go to sleep, she sees Dick in her mind. Erin's assistant comes back and reminds her that she is late for her court hearing.

They walk outside and Erin tells Becky that she will present her case to the grand jury immediately and an arrest warrant will be issued. She reminds Becky of the police protection when she gets a phone call from Danny. Erin can't believe what Danny is telling her. Becky turns around and screams when she sees Dick face to face. Dick starts to smile at her and Erin moves in between them to keep Dick from getting to Becky. Dick claims that Becky scared him as Erin tries to get Becky to go back inside the courthouse. Dick then tries to taunt Erin claiming that she looks better than ever. Dick asks what Becky is doing at the courthouse when a car pulls up to the curb. Becky breaks free from Erin and starts to hit Dick and calls him a bastard. Erin tries to pull Becky away from Dick as Danny comes out of the car and pins Dick up against a pillar of the building. Danny then tells Dick he is being arrested for intimidating a witness as Erin and Becky go back inside the courthouse. Dick tries to tell Danny that Becky scared him and started hitting him. He then adds sarcastically that he's not pressing charges. Danny tells him that he is and puts Dick in his car.

At Danny's precinct, Danny asks Dick if he wants a lawyer. Dick tells him he doesn't need one. Danny tells him that he must like spending time in jail since he intimidated Becky. Dick challenges him to prove that he knew Becky would be at the courthouse. Danny says he doesn't have to prove anything to him, but he can't believe that it was merely a coincidence that they were both at the courthouse at the same time. Dick claims that it was pure luck and since he has such a good week he should buy some lottery tickets. Danny asks Dick if he really thinks a judge is going to believe his story. Dick tells him that exactly was the reason he was at the courthouse. He wanted the judge who sentenced him, Judge Arliss, to see him free on the street and eating a hot dog. Danny tells him that he will be back in front of the judge soon enough. Dick doesn't believe so and he should ask his sister. Danny becomes angry and shoves the interrogation desk into Dick. Dick reminds him to stay calm and that he is a reformed person. Danny tells him that people like him don't ever reform and compares him to a dog that either gets locked up or put down. Dick asks if he is being threatened. Danny tells him he doesn't make threats and leaves the room. Jackie goes up to Danny and tells him that the charges will not stick and he must let Dick go. He tries to call Erin, and although Jackie understands and disagrees with releasing Dick, she tells Danny to give Erin a chance to build the case up. Danny reluctantly agrees and releases Dick. Dick has a confused look on his face, but then smiles as he walks out of the precinct. Jackie then tells Danny that Becky has changed her mind and decided that she is not going to testify against Dick. Danny is worried that Erin's case is now ruined and tells Jackie that Dick is going to hurt somebody else. Jackie reassures him that they won't let that happen.

At One Police Plaza, Mayor Russo is comparing the Dick Reed case to the Son of Sam. The city is terrified and the news has spread nationally. Frank tells him he is aware of the situation and shows him messages from the Governor of New York, the Attorney General, stretching all the way down to block associations. Frank tries to change the subject by saying the 911 system is overtaxed. The mayor is not paying attention to the budget issues and continues to rant about the case saying that the mayor who oversaw the city after The Son of Sam got captured ended up losing his position anyway. He brings up the newspaper which reads that with each day Dick is on the loose, the mayors' chances of reelection become slimmer and slimmer. The mayor tells Frank that he is under a lot of pressure for failing to keep the city safe. Frank again tries to bring up budget issues by saying that the task force that caught The Son of Sam cost $90,000 per day. In the present time, it would be $350,000. Frank lets the mayor know that if he needs more resources he will be hearing from him. The mayor then brings up Councilwoman Collins and lets him know that she has a bid on the mayor's office and with the jabs she took at the press conference she might as well have stabbed Frank in the back with one of Dick's hunting knives. Frank reminds the mayor that he doesn't get involved in politics. The mayor then reminds him that the longer this case takes, things will become bad for him and even worse for Frank. Frank tells the mayor that is not his concern. His concern is protecting the citizens of the city. Mayor Russo then suggests that Frank should consider politics and leaves.

In the city, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli have been called back to Rosie's apartment. She nods her head toward Mondo who is standing across the street just staring at her window. They approach him and ask what he is doing. He responds that he is doing nothing. Sgt. Renzulli suggests that he should go do nothing somewhere else. Mondo suggests that Sgt. Renzulli go and eat another donut. Jamie tells Mondo that he is making Rosie uncomfortable by being there. Mondo reminds them they he is within the legal distance. Jamie reminds him that a lot of people would like to see him back in prison and the only reason they are there is to wait for Mondo to cross a line into an illegal distance so he can be arrested. Mondo declares that he just wants to talk to Rosie. Sgt. Renzulli tells him that she doesn't want to talk to him. Mondo declares that he still loves Rosie. Sgt Renzulli suggests that he love her from an even farther distance away and orders him to move away. Jamie then says that, if Mondo truly does love Rosie, scaring her is not the way to do it. This causes Mondo to walk away and Sgt. Renzulli praises Jamie for his handling of the situation.

At the Chief Medical Examiners Office, Frank stops by and sees the Chief Medical Examiner packing up things in his office. He announces that he just got the news that the Chief Medical Examiner, named Craig, has lost his job and apologizes to him saying that the mayor needed somebody else as a fall guy. Craig tells Frank that he made his office work right a long time ago, but his office is still overwhelmed with work. Frank asks Craig if he is going to be all right. Craig tells him that he has lost his pension, but he owns his house, receives Social Security and his wife continues to work. Frank reminds him that the city delegated an extra twelve million dollars to deal with the backlog of DNA cases. Craig reminds him that delegating the money isn't the same as receiving the money. Frank asks him what happened to the money. Craig tells him every time he went before a committee, all he got was a runaround on where the money had gone and he never saw any of the funds that were promised.

In the city, Jamie has contacted Agent Anderson. He asks her what is going on and she tells him that she helped him out of a problem (Episode 1.8, Chinatown). Jamie reminds her that the reason he was in that problem was because of her. He then asks her how she knew what he had told the investigator from Internal Affairs. Agent Anderson says nothing. He then asks her if she had read the files, or if she was told, or if the investigator was part of the problem. Agent Anderson again says nothing. Jamie asks her if she is part of the problem. Agent Anderson says that everyone is a part of it. Jamie asks her if she is part of The Blue Templar and Agent Anderson hangs up the phone.

At the Reagan house, the family eats their dinner in silence. Jack breaks the silence by asking why no one is talking. Linda tells him that the family has a lot on their minds. Nicky asks Erin if it's about the people that have been released from prison which Erin confirms. Danny adds that it feels like he is sitting on a powder keg while waiting for something bad to happen. He then compares it to Jack and Sean having a bully at school. They know that something bad is about to happen, but they just don't know when. Jamie adds that you can't arrest somebody for something they might do. Frank adds that if a person has done something bad, they will do something bad again to which Danny agrees. He then asks Erin if there is any other crime they can arrest Dick for to which she doesn't answer. Henry tells his granddaughter that she should knock some sense into Becky and make her testify. She defends herself by saying that is what she is trying to do. Nicky adds that a lot of children at her school blame Frank for Dick being on the loose. Danny defends Frank and tries to remind Nicky that Dick is not on the loose. Jack tells Sean the details of what Dick had done to his victims and when Sean tries to ask Linda if it is true, Linda stops that talk immediately. Jamie asks if the plan is to watch Dick for the rest of life. Erin declares that she will make her case even if Becky doesn't testify. Henry comments that better happen before Dick sets another victim on fire. Frank then stops the conversation by saying that he will not have that kind of talk at his table. Sean tries to apologize, but Frank assures his grandson that he didn't do anything wrong. Frank then suggests that they try and enjoy the rest of their dinner to which the family tries to do in silence.

In the kitchen, the silence has continued while Frank does the dishes, Erin takes care of the leftovers and Danny eats his dessert. He tries to break the silence again by asking about the New York Jets and gets no response. Frank then admits that maybe the situation at dinner could've been handled differently. Erin agrees and says that everybody is on edge. Frank asks if the pedophile that Erin has a case against is going to walk free. She tells him she has 48 hours to find another way to keep the case open or he will walk. She plans on looking into involuntary civil commitment and a new mental hygiene law. Danny asks what that means in English. Erin tells her it means if two psychiatrists say that the suspect is crazy, he can be locked up. Danny tells her that doesn't seem very politically correct and that she is working in a gray area. Frank praises his daughter for the idea and that she is getting creative. Danny then gets a phone call about a woman who has been attacked with the same motive as Dick.

At the crime scene, a woman is being placed in an ambulance with a gash on her face. Jackie tells Danny that the case is like Dick's, but Danny says that it can't be Dick since Detective Gerken has kept an eye on Dick's mother's house and has reported that Dick has been in the house since the day before. Danny also says the cuts on this new victim's face are not the same as Dick's. The cuts Dick made were more deep and violent, and the new victim was not raped. Jackie suggests that they have a copycat and Danny adds that he may be one of Dick's crazy fans. He then asks Jackie if she remembered seeing Dick carrying a duffel bag or a box when he got off the Corrections bus. She tells him no. Danny then suggests that, if Dick did get fan mail while he was in prison, it would still then be there.

In Jamie's apartment, Jamie is continuing the research on his brother's death by reading a news article online. He has highlighted the names of two officers, Sonny Malevsky and Lydia Gonsalves who were involved in the incident that took his brothers' life. He searches Lydia's name and finds an article that Lydia was awarded a Medal of Valor for her actions in the incident. A further search shows that Lydia resigned from the police force soon after receiving her award. The next day in Frank's office, Detective Abigail Baker comes in with a bunch of big files in her hands. She announces that she has the minutes from meetings the Appropriations Committee has held. He remarks that politicians can do a lot of talking. He then invites her to sit down and remarks that they have a lot of work to do.

At Danny's precinct, Danny and Jackie are going through Dick's fan mail. She finds a letter from a man named Hugh Stayton who has a record for forgery and selling fake letters. She further finds that he runs a website with a friend named James Ratchet called Luckystabbyknife.com. She brings up the website and finds that it is devoted to serial killers. Danny sees a link marked New Material under Dick's name and asks Jackie to click on it. When she does she finds pictures of Dick getting off the Corrections bus and a picture that James, Hugh, and Dick had taken together. Danny then goes to question Hugh.

At Hugh's apartment, Danny knocks on the door and asks to come inside. Hugh allows them. Danny notices the walls have artwork of serial killers and the room is darkened. He asks Hugh to turn a light on and Hugh tells him he likes being in the dark. Danny then tells Jackie to open a shade to let some light in the room. Danny tells Hugh about the attack in Columbus Park the night before and asks if he is involved. Hugh tries to stop Jackie from opening the shade as it would cause his papers to fade. Danny asks him again the question and he denies being involved. Hugh tells them that he is a collector and he doesn't like touching people. Danny remarks that in prison he's going to be touched a lot by other prisoners. Jackie asks him about the website and Hugh admits that he is the owner. Danny asks where Hugh was at the time of the attack. Hugh tells him that he was in his apartment working on his computer. He then suggests checking the computer and that would confirm his alibi. Jackie suggests that somebody else could've been on his computer while he was committing the crime. Hugh denies this. Danny suggests that Dick and James told Hugh to commit the crime himself. Hugh denies it again. Jackie has searched the computer and finds pictures of the new victim at the crime scene. Danny accuses Hugh of committing the crime and orders the police officers to put him in handcuffs. Hugh then confesses that it was James who did the crime and all he was doing was posting the pictures online. Danny asks if he can prove his story. Hugh tells him that James is obsessed with Dick and would do anything to please him as a fan. Hugh thinks that what James and Dick were talking about is scary. Danny asks if Hugh had seen Dick. Hugh admits that he saw Dick in a dive bar in Flushing, New York. Danny orders the police officers to take Hugh's statement and sends out a description of James over the airwaves.

Danny and Jackie then head over to Dick's mother's house. Detective Gerken tells him that Dick must be in the house since they've never stopped watching the house. He also tells them not to bother questioning Dick's mother since she is catatonic. Danny and Jackie enter the house and search it. Danny goes upstairs as Jackie finds Dick's mother sitting in front of a loud television. She tries to question her, but confirms what the detective has told her since she doesn't answer. Danny searches a bedroom after hearing a woman crying and finds her tied to the bed with bruises and cuts on her face. Danny calls to Jackie and has her call an ambulance. Danny unties the woman on the bed and asks if Dick had done this to her and she confirms and admits that Dick is her brother. Danny asks her if she knows where Dick is and she tells Danny that he lives in the basement. Danny goes to search the basement. When he gets there, he finds a door behind a filing cabinet. He opens the door and finds a tunnel that Dick had used to leave the house whenever he wanted. Outside the house, Danny reprimands Detective Gerken and tells him all he had to do was watch Dick like a hawk. Detective Gerken claims that is what he was doing. Danny argues that he wasn't. Detective Gerken starts to ask him how he was supposed to know there was a tunnel and Danny interrupts him by yelling that it was his job to find out that information. Jackie lets Danny know that the tunnel leads to a neighbor's house and into their storm cellar. The cellar was a bomb shelter that was first built in the 1950s, but there is no sign of Dick. Danny deduces that they need to get to Becky before Dick does.

At Frank's office, Councilwoman Collins has been summoned by Frank. She asks if she has been summoned because of the press conference and that it all comes down to politics and she didn't believe that Frank was so thick-skinned. Frank tells her that he took her words to heart and invites her to sit at his desk which she does. Frank reminds her of an unfortunate misunderstanding where the Councilwoman awarded public contracts without making bids for them. Councilwoman Collins reminds Frank that she was exonerated of that. Frank is aware of that, but it got him thinking as to why she decided to put the blame on him at the press conference when the information would've gotten to him anyway. He then tells her that he visited the Chief Medical Examiner's office. He asks if she had known that he had lost his job and his pension. Before she can answer, Detective Baker interrupts by clearing her throat. Frank apologizes and lets Councilwoman Collins know that Detective Baker put a lot of time in reading the minutes of the meetings. Detective Baker presents one of the files that shown funds that should've gone to the Medical Examiner's office, but instead went to finance a personal vacation for the Councilwoman to the Dominican Republic. She goes to show another example when Councilwoman Collins stops her, saying she doesn't need to hear anymore of this. Frank agrees with her that she doesn't have to, but she may want to. He then tells her that misappropriation of public funds is a serious problem. There are more instances to be presented and when they are done, Frank suggests that the councilwoman may want to have a lawyer.

At Becky's apartment. Becky is sitting on her couch reading a book when she hears a noise outside her door. She looks outside her window and then hears footsteps approaching to her door. She sees a shadow form outside her door as the doorknob begins to rattle. She becomes frightened and goes into her bedroom closet to hide. The door opens, and a man comes in carrying a knife. The man then takes out an mp3 player and plays the song Ave Maria. The man approaches the closet door as Becky tries to hold the door closed. The closet door rattles and opens as the man grabs her by her hair. Danny bursts into the apartment and grabs the man and throws him on the bed with his gun on him. Jackie identifies herself as a detective and takes Becky away to a safer place in the apartment. Danny looks at the man and finds that it's not Dick, but James. He then finds the mp3 player and turns it off. Danny then questions James while he is sitting on the couch in handcuffs. James tells him he has no idea where Dick is, but that he could have Becky since he is done with her. James tells him that Dick has a new victim in mind, but has no idea as to who it is. Danny asks James who the new victim is again and grabs him by the throat. James screams out that he has no idea who it is and if he did, he would tell him. Danny lets him go and tells the police officers to take James away.

At the courthouse, a fellow attorney passes by a janitor who is working late at night. Erin is in her office when she gets a phone call from Danny. Danny tells her that Dick has given him the slip. Erin asks how it happened and Danny tells her what happened at Becky's apartment. Danny believes that Dick used James as a decoy so Dick can go after somebody else as an act of revenge. Erin asks if Dick is still on the loose which Danny admits. Danny tells her he is sending the police back to his mother's house in case the target is his sister. Erin suggests that, if Dick was going to go after his sister, he had plenty of time to do so. Danny angrily tells his sister that he is covering his bases and she should do the same. He warns his sister to be careful as Dick has an issue with her as well. Erin agrees and says that Dick has issues with the judge and half the people in the courthouse. Danny apologizes and tells Erin to be careful. She hangs up the phone. The janitor then looks up and reveals himself to be Dick in disguise.

In Frank's office, he gets a call from Erin saying that the suspect in her case is being transferred to a prison psychiatric facility for a 40-day evaluation. Frank says that is good news. Erin claims a partial victory saying that it would at least buy her some time to continue with the case. Frank notices that it is late and he is hungry. He then suggests meeting Erin for dinner. Erin tries to tell her father that it sounds good, but she has a lot of work to do. Frank interrupts and reminds her that they both need to eat. Erin agrees and asks for just a few more minutes to finish up her work. Frank agrees and they each say they will see other soon. Erin walks into the hallway where she gets startled by her assistant. She asks if there is any more work that needs to be done. Erin gives her one final task and then says that she can go home. Erin goes back into her office, grabs her coat, puts her phone in her purse and leaves. As she is walking down the hall, she sees the real janitor in a pool of blood with his throat slashed. She becomes frightened, but quickly regains her composure and removes her shoes so not to make any noise while walking down the hall. She starts to run in the hall, but only goes a few feet when she runs into Dick with a smile on his face. He taunts her and calls her beautiful. She then shoves her purse into him and runs in the opposite direction. Dick then throws her purse down and goes after her with a knife in his hand.

At the restaurant, Danny calls Frank asking if he had heard from Erin since she isn't answering her phone. He tells Danny that she is still at the courthouse finishing up her work. Danny then tells his father that he will try to call her back. Back at the courthouse, Erin runs into another office to hide and she tries to call for help. She is so frightened that she can't complete a call from the phone. She grabs a fire extinguisher as Dick continues to taunt her saying that he has been waiting a long time to do things to her and he is going to savor every moment with her. He then plays the song Ave Maria and taunts her more. He makes his way into the office where she is hiding and she hits Dick with the fire extinguisher. She runs out into the hallway and Dick chases her and catches her by tackling her to the ground. He ties her hands behind her back with her coat and orders her to get up. Erin tries to fight back and Dick pins her against a wall while Erin cries out in agony. Dick tells her that he has been waiting five years for this when Frank suddenly shows up and orders Dick to get his hands off his daughter with his gun pointed at Dick. Dick uses Erin as a human shield with his knife at Erin's neck as Frank moves a little closer to them. Dick challenges Frank to shoot and Frank does, hitting Dick above his left eye. Erin screams out as they both hit the ground. Frank holster his gun and grabs Erin making sure she is all right. He kisses his daughter on the head and cradles her telling her that she will be all right.

The next day, Mayor Russo is finishing up a press conference saying that it is a great day in New York City. When he opens the press conference for questions, all the reporters want to talk to Frank. Mayor Russo calls Frank up to the podium and the reporters offer a round of applause. A reporter named Miguel asks for any details about Dick being shot. Frank tells him that with all police shootings, Internal Affairs will be handling the case and he can't comment on it. Another reporter asks if Frank can confirm or deny that an indictment will be taking place with Councilwoman Collins. Frank answers no. Kelly then asks Frank, since he can't comment on being involved in Dick's shooting, can he tell them how his daughter is doing. Frank then answers that Erin is back at her desk and has a lot of work to do. Frank then receives another round of applause from the reporters."

At the Reagan house, Frank is on the phone with his former partner, Jimmy Burke, while Jamie and Henry are playing chess. Frank tells Jimmy that he is looking forward to tomorrow and happy anniversary. Jamie asks his father about saying happy anniversary on the phone and Frank tells him that it is an inside joke between him and Jimmy. Jamie asks Frank if he was involved in a shooting in Jimmy's old precinct. Frank admits that he was. Jamie tells his father that he was never told of the story. Frank tells Jamie that he was young when the incident happened and he didn't want his children to know that he could've died on a rooftop in Harlem. Jamie asks if it was that close to actually happening. Frank answers that it did to the point where he calls his ex-partner every year on the day it happened. Frank then excuses himself and goes to bed. Henry then tells Jamie that Frank's partner took two bullets that were meant to hit Frank and that he was taken off duty for six months.

Henry strays the conversation away and moves his queen on the chessboard and tells Jamie that his king is in trouble.

In the city, Danny and Jackie are driving around. Danny hears a song on the radio and playfully tries to get her to sing along, but she doesn't. Jackie asks if Danny is enjoying himself and he admits that he is. He answers how could he not be having a good time when he had just taken a statement from a transsexual escort who thought her psychiatrist had kidnapped her dog. He asks her where else she could be and have a great time. She answers that her bed is the best place she wants to be. Back at the club, more people are begging King to be let in when a gunshot rings out and King falls to the ground dead. As the club becomes a crime scene, Danny and Jackie have arrived. A police officer tells them that King's name is Richard King and the Crime Scene Investigative Unit have let them know the shooter was in the street. Danny asks if there were any eyewitnesses and the police officer tells them that, although there were more than a dozen people near King when the shot rang out, they were facing the club door and not the street. Danny deduces that in the time of the shooting, with everyone scrambling around to become safe and being drunk, the shooter had fled the scene unnoticed. Jackie asks if anyone had heard the shots and the police officer confirms that everyone in the area heard only one shot.

Danny then notices a video camera above the door of the club. Jackie asks if there is anyone that works in the club that they can talk to. The police officer says that the club's owner is available. Jackie recognizes her as Sabrina Glick. Danny asks if she knows her. Jackie answers that she has read a lot about her in the newspaper. Inside the club, Sabrina shows Danny and Jackie the surveillance footage. She also tells them that she had been 20 feet away from where King had been shot. On the footage, it only shows King falling to the ground. Sabrina and the shooter are outside of the view of the camera. Danny asks if there are other cameras shooting from a different angle. Sabrina shakes her head. Jackie then says that they need to take the footage as evidence and suggests that their Technical Assistance Research Unit (TARU) could enhance the videos and expand the view. Danny asks Sabrina what kind of guy King was. She tells him that King was the reason her club got a lot of business over the course of two months. Jackie asks Sabrina to make sure that they are talking about a doorman. Danny tells her that doormen and DJs are a new breed of celebrity in the club business. He then tells Jackie that, before he became a police officer, he was at a doorman at a club as well. Sabrina asked what had happened and suggests that he is too old to do so. Danny tells her that he got married and had two children. Jackie tries to get the questioning back on track and asks if King had any girlfriends or jealous lovers. Sabrina tells them that King has been with Benita Ginn who works as a nurse, but feels that she is not the murdering type. Jackie asks if there are any people who had a grudge or if King had enemies. Sabrina answers that everyone in the city could fit that type. Danny adds that doormen are the only people that can say no to a rich and powerful person. He then asks Sabrina if King made anybody mad. Sabrina then remembers that the bouncers had mentioned somebody getting angry after they had been turned away from the club, angry enough to threaten King with a gun. Jackie asks for a name and Sabrina gives the name and address of Vince Walker. Danny thanks Sabrina as he flags Vince as a possible suspect and flight risk. He and Sabrina exchange information with him giving a business card and she gives him a bar napkin with her phone number on it.

In the city, Frank is having a meeting with Jimmy in a restaurant. Jimmy shows him a picture of his daughter and is proud to announce that she has become a successful doctor. Frank lets Jimmy know that something is on his mind and he tells Frank he knows that a current Deputy Chief is getting ready to retire and he is wondering if he would be considered to fill the possible vacancy. Frank asks him if he is happy at his current precinct. Jimmy admits that he is, but he has been commanding officer there for three years and wishes for a greater challenge. Frank admits that his crime statistics are good and Jimmy concurs and says that will get even better. He also tells Frank that he is going to meet with the statistics committee soon and he feels they will be pleased with what he has to say. Frank reminds Jimmy that he should know how Frank does things. As long as Frank believes he is right for the job, he would be considered. Jimmy agrees that is all he wants is just to be considered. Erin arrives and announces that she has a breakfast meeting with a judge who has been giving her issues with her search and seizure warrants. Jimmy invites Erin to sit at the table and join them. At a hotel, Danny announces to Jackie that a doorman has told them that they have just missed Vince by a few minutes. Jackie tells Danny that she has received information from Vince's credit card that he has rented a helicopter. Thinking that Vince is planning to escape the city, Danny, Jackie and a couple of police cars race to a helipad to stop him. The cars arrive just as the helicopter is about to take off. Danny orders Vince out of the helicopter at gunpoint and Vince complies, immediately saying that he didn't do it. Danny sarcastically calls off the police officers then shoves Vince over to his car and arrests him.

At Danny's precinct, Vince's lawyer has already been called in and he is proclaiming his client's innocence. Danny asks why Vince booked a helicopter that was going to take him to a private jet that was going to fly him to Cuba. Jackie adds that the United States doesn't have an extradition treaty with Cuba. Vince's lawyer claims his client was nervous and that it wouldn't look good, but he upholds the claim that Vince is an upstanding member of the community. Danny denies this calling Vince a scumbag, but if he has a good alibi, he will listen. Vince's lawyer produces a business card for a club called Little Hell. Danny takes the card and goes to the club with Jackie. As they arrive, Jackie asks what kind of club calls itself Little Hell. Danny tells her that it is a dominatrix dungeon. They question the club's manager and she tells them that her clientele are average citizens and many of them are successful businessmen. Jackie tells a story of a former boyfriend of hers who once asked her to lick her boots. Instead, she broke her boyfriend's nose. The club manager tells her that was a shame and that she doesn't seem like the submissive type. The club manager also teases Jackie with her riding crop. Jackie threatens her by saying, if she takes out her handcuffs, it's not to have fun. Danny smiles at the situation and the club manager backs away from Jackie. The club manager confirms that Vince was indeed in the club when King's shooting took place. Danny asks for proof and she shows them a video of Vince being dominated and barking like a dog. The tape's time stamp confirms her story.

At One Police Plaza, Jimmy is giving his crime statistics to a panel of members. Jimmy is proud to announce that violent crime has dropped by 20 percent in his precinct. Frank arrives at the meeting and a panel member asks about what kind of deployment tactics were used in strong arm robberies. Jimmy answers that he used a method of anti-crime units and doubling the number of plain clothed officers. Frank mentions that those tactics failed in another precinct and asks Jimmy why. Jimmy answers that he can't speak for the other precinct, but in his precinct he works hard and often to achieve results. The panel member moves onto burglaries and notices that the numbers have dropped and wants to know why. Jimmy tells them that he started a burglary task force made up of his youngest and sharpest officers. Frank asks him where could he improve. Jimmy tells him that there is always need for improvement. Frank is pleased by Jimmy's answers and leaves the room as the panel member goes on to ask another question.

At Danny's house, Linda is taking Jack and Sean to school. Danny only gets a few minutes to hug is boys since he has gone home to sleep for a few hours before his next shift. As the boys hug their father, the cocktail napkin falls out of his coat pocket and Sean asks what it is. Danny confesses to Linda that Sabrina is a witness in the case he is working. Danny tells Linda he loves her and she says she loves him back. At the Reagan house as the family eats their Chinese food, Nicky reads her fortune cookie saying that a mysterious stranger will be visiting her. Erin quickly takes the fortune out of her hands and tells her that no stranger will be coming near her. Nicky takes her fortune back and says that somebody will be coming for her. Frank adds that as long as he has thirty six thousand armed officers, no one is going near Nicky. Erin notices Linda's new hairstyle and Linda thanks Erin and then sarcastically says she is glad that someone noticed. Danny shoots a guilty look at his wife. Linda then asks Henry to read his fortune cookie, but he refuses. Sean offers to go, but Jack reminds him that he has already read two fortunes already. Jamie calms the situation by allowing Sean to read his fortune cookie which reads that Jamie is wise beyond his years. Danny teases his younger brother that it was wise for him to trade in his Harvard education for his training at the police academy. Jamie defends himself saying it was the best decision he ever made. Danny asks Frank to read his fortune which reads that he will be taking a chance. Henry adds to the fortune saying that, if he does take a chance on something, it will backfire on him.

Erin asks Henry why he has been so grumpy all night. Henry tries to invoke his Fifth amendment right and Frank tells the family that Henry is upset because he is considering a promotion for Jimmy to Deputy Chief. Frank then tells his father that Jimmy did a good job at the statistics meeting. Henry asks if that is enough to give him the promotion. Frank refuses to answer and Jamie still is confused as to why Henry doesn't like Jimmy. Henry admits that what Jimmy did for Frank is admirable, but can never be repaid. It is what Jimmy to his wife that cannot be forgiven. Erin deduces that Jimmy had cheated on his wife of 15 years. Henry says that he cannot trust a man that his own family wouldn't. Danny tries to defend Jimmy by saying a lot of officers in Jimmy's precinct would do almost anything for Jimmy. Linda asks Danny if he is all right with a man cheating on his wife. Danny answers by saying it is wrong for a man to cheat on his wife, but that doesn't make him a bad police officer. Danny then gets a phone call about his case and he excuses himself from the table and goes into the kitchen.

The phone call is from Sabrina who tells Danny that she has some new information about the case. She teases that if Danny wants the information he would have to show up at the club. Danny tells Sabrina that he is on the way. Linda has gone into the kitchen and overheard Danny's phone call. She asks who was on the phone and Danny tells the truth saying that it was his witness. Linda then grabs a newspaper and says that she can't believe of all the cases in New York, he gets the one case that has made the papers as she shows him a picture of Sabrina. Danny defends himself that it is part of the job. Linda tells him the reason she came into the kitchen was to remind him that it only should be about work and nothing else. Danny then goes to leave as he hears Henry still complaining about Jimmy from the dining room. Frank enters the kitchen telling his father to stop talking about Jimmy as Danny leaves. Frank asks Linda if she wants to talk and she tells him that is not a good idea. Frank reminds her that she is also his daughter as well. Linda smiles, says thank you to Frank and walks back into the dining room.

In the city, Danny is driving to the club and he calls Jackie asking for her to meet him at the club. Jackie tells him that she can't because she has gotten a hold of King's girlfriend and is going to see her. Danny suggests that they meet back at the precinct after they are both done with their questioning. Back at the Reagan house, Jamie asks to talk with Frank. Frank notices that Jamie has a look on his face and the last time he saw it was when Jamie got a C in science class. Jamie then puts a ring in Frank's hand. Frank recognizes the ring as his wife's and Jamie announces that the wedding he had planned with Sydney has been called off. Jamie also takes the blame for not getting married and Frank tells him that sometimes the job at home can be more difficult that the job he works on the streets. Frank tells Jamie that he became disappointed after Jamie decided to give up law school to become a police officer. He reminds Jamie that his mother wanted to keep him out of the family business and Frank felt that he wanted to honor his wife's wishes. Jamie tells Frank that he didn't stop him from becoming a police officer. Frank tells him that it was neither his nor his wife's decision to make; it was Jamie's. Frank further tells him that he is very proud of his son on the force as a police officer. He says that he is truly sorry that things didn't work out with Sydney, but to continue trusting himself.

In the club, Danny has arrived looking for Sabrina. He finds her on the dance floor and she invites him to join him, but he refuses. Danny escorts Sabrina off the dance floor to a place where they can talk. In another part of the city, Jackie is talking to King's girlfriend, Benita. Benita tells Jackie that they had moved from North Carolina to New York three years ago. During the trip, King asked Benita to be his girlfriend. She got a job at a hospital working at night and King got his job working at the club so they could spend their days together. Things were going wonderful for her until two months ago when King started hitting underground poker rooms and losing his money. Back in the club, Sabrina has given Danny a business card to her favorite boutique. She tells Danny to buy Linda something nice in case he had gotten in trouble with Linda. Danny asks her if that was the reason that she brought him to the club. She offers Danny a shot of liquor, but again he refuses saying he is on duty. Sabrina then tells Danny that she has found King's cell phone. He notices that a lot of calls were made to the same number. Sabrina tells Danny the number belongs to a person named Lemon. Back in the city, Jackie asks Benita who Lemon is. She tells her that he is a British person who runs an after hour casino. Benita tells Jackie that King would go to the casino after working to relax, but she had no idea that he owed Lemon over $100,000 after reading his e-mails. Benita asks Jackie if Lemon could've killed King. Jackie tells her she doesn't know for certain, but King certainly had a motive. Benita starts to cry. Jackie assures Benita that if Lemon did kill King, he will get caught. Benita tells her that she can't believe what King had done to both of them and Jackie deduces that Benita is eight weeks pregnant.

Back in the club, Danny asks Sabrina where he can find Lemon. Sabrina tells Danny she will give him his location if he dances with her. Again, Danny refuses. Sabrina gives him the information then leads him onto the dance floor. She starts to dance seductively and Danny stands firm, but he finally agrees to dance with Sabrina. While they are dancing, Jackie comes in sees Danny with a big smile on his face. Jackie calls Danny away and he leaves Sabrina on the dance floor. They go outside as Danny is putting on his coat and she asks if he was working the case or trying to hook up with Sabrina. Danny tells her when has he ever strayed away from working a case. Jackie tells him if Linda had seen him with Sabrina and Danny finishes her sentence saying that he would be dancing on crutches. He then shares the information on Lemon and they head to his illegal casino. The police raid the casino in Lemon's apartment as Danny arrests Lemon. At Danny's precinct, Lemon admits that King did owe him money, but he didn't kill him. He also tells Danny that he forgave the debt if King was going to start a new business deal. Lemon was going to finance a new nightclub and King was going to bring the clientele from Sabrina's club. King was planning on leaving Sabrina's club on the night he got killed.

Outside the courthouse, Erin is met by a woman named Molly Griffin. She claims that she met Erin from a previous case and she remembers her. She apologizes for bothering her, but she tells her that something is going on and she knew that Erin was the only one she could talk to. Molly has a problem with the police department. She starts to talk about Frank, but Erin interrupts her saying that if she has a complaint that she should go to somebody else. Molly interrupts Erin by saying she doesn't want to cause any trouble and that she comes from a police family as well. Molly then tells Erin about her granddaughter who had been mugged in the stairwell of her apartment building.

At Danny's precinct, Danny gets a phone call from Frank. When Danny answers the phone, he immediately tells Frank that everything is fine between him and Linda. Frank asks if Danny is getting better at talking on the phone or if he is getting worse, Danny tells him that he knows that Frank is worried about one of his children when the pitch in his voice goes up. Frank tells Danny to tell him he has nothing more to worry about, which Danny does and then sees Sabrina being led into the precinct. He hangs up the phone and goes to question her. Danny asks Sabrina if King had told her about the plan to open a new nightclub. Sabrina's lawyer advises her not to answer the question, but Sabrina answers and confirms the plan. Jackie tells her that information shouldn't have been left out. Sabrina tells her she knew how it would make her look. Jackie suggests that the situation looks worse now. Sabrina then asks Danny if he feels that she is the type of person to murder someone. Danny suggests that if King did open the new nightclub, all her customers would go to the new club. Danny calls her tough and tells her that she should know she wasn't going to let that happen. Sabrina suggests that it is nonsense, but Danny tells her it a motive. Sabrina then admits that she was angry that King would've left her after making him popular and why should she have been happy if he took everything she built for him. Jackie asks Sabrina how unhappy she was. Sabrina's lawyer puts an end to the questioning and as they leave, Danny warns Sabrina that she shouldn't go too far away because if the video doesn't show her on it, he will be seeing her again. Sabrina tells Danny she knows how to get in touch with her and leaves. Danny comes out of the interrogation room to find Linda waiting at his desk. She has brought him dinner. Linda makes eye contact with Sabrina and her mood changes a little. Danny then takes Linda and the food to another room to eat.

At the Reagan house, Erin has arrived as Frank is heating up some leftovers. He is on the phone giving a congratulatory phone call to his new Deputy Chief. Erin then tells Frank that they need to talk about Jimmy. Back at the precinct, Linda asks Danny if Sabrina is a suspect in his case. He admits that she is. Linda then sarcastically asks if she can be part of the jury. Danny playfully answers back that he will see what he can do. He then tells his wife that he doesn't get to do special things for her, but today is different. He then gives her a gift box. Linda is not happy to find a new dress in the box. Linda asks Danny if in the 15 years they have been married if he has ever seen her wear a dress like the one he got. Danny asks her why she doesn't like the dress, it's a new style and he feels she would look great in it. Linda asks if he has been reading Vogue magazine and then tells her that she understands that sometimes a man's eyes wander and if his mind wanders then so be it, but he is never to make his wife ever feel like the way she feels now and she tosses the dress back to him. Linda storms out of the precinct offended.

Back at the Reagan house, Erin tells Frank about the case that Molly told her about. When the attack took place, the officers classified the mugging as harassment. Three weeks later, another case where a person was burglarized got classified as a trespassing case. Frank deduces that Jimmy is misfiling the reports. Erin asks why would he do that. Frank explains that if a felony case gets classified as a misdemeanor case, it would look like violent crimes would go down. As his statistics would drop, it would make him look like a worthy person for a promotion. Erin apologizes for listening to his conversation when she came into the house and asked if he had given Jimmy the promotion. Frank tells her that he did not give the promotion to Jimmy, but to somebody else. Erin asks why did he do that. Frank tells her that he trusted his initial feeling. He then tells her that sometimes you don't have to talk yourself into making the right decisions. Erin praises her father, but he realizes that now he must say goodbye to an old friend. Back at the precinct, Danny tries to give the dress for Linda to Jackie. Jackie tells Danny she knew that giving Linda that style of dress wasn't going to end up being good for him. Danny's commanding officer then announces that TARU has finished expanding the video footage. Danny looks at it and sees that Sabrina did come out of the club and she hit the ground as King was getting shot. Danny goes back and watches the footage and sees something. Jackie sees it too. She sees a tiny flash from a streetlight. Danny corrects her saying that it was not a flash, but a spark from the bullet hitting the streetlight and then hitting King. Jackie deduces that King was not the initial target and they both agree that the target was supposed to be Sabrina.

Back at the club, Danny tells Sabrina about the bullet bouncing off the streetlight and Jackie tells her that he wasn't the target. Sabrina asks who it was supposed to be and Danny tells her that it was her. Sabrina scoffs at this asking who would want to kill her. Danny asks that he would need the names of anybody Sabrina was romantically linked with. Sabrina scoffs again and Danny reminds her that whoever tried to kill her is still out there. Sabrina tells Danny that there was only one person, Danny asks for the name so he can call them. Sabrina says that can't be done because that one person had been shot. Danny deduces that King was involved with Sabrina romantically. Jackie starts to get angry and asks if Benita knew about this. Sabrina admits that she didn't tell her about their affair. Jackie asks if she knew that Benita was two months pregnant or if she even cared. Danny warns Jackie to take it easy and she excuses herself from the club. Sabrina asks Danny if Linda was his wife when they saw each other at the precinct. Danny confirms this. She then asks what does Linda have that she doesn't. He then takes out the cocktail napkin with her phone number and answers himself. Danny then leaves the club.

At Frank's office, Jimmy has been called in to meet with Frank. Frank first tells him that he should know that he gave the promotion to somebody else. Jimmy confirms that he has thanks to all the police officers in his precinct gossiping about it. Frank defends his decision and Jimmy thanks Frank for giving him the news honestly. Frank then places a file in front of him and accuses him of misfiling police reports. He then goes to sit at the opposite side of the table and asks to be told the truth. Jimmy starts to tell Frank that he has given 40 years of service and the only thing he has to show for it are three bullet holes, two failed marriages, and not being able to sleep. Frank tells him that he doesn't want to hear a sob story. Jimmy confesses that he had been misfiling the police reports for six months in the hope of getting promoted and then he would retire with a better pension since he has to pay two alimonies and four college tuitions. Frank scolds him by saying if he didn't have the commitment he should've just retired and been done with it. He then tells him the only thing left was his word, and if that gets lost, there is nothing. Jimmy asks if Frank is going to demote him after everything they had been through. Frank tells him that he is either to be demoted to the rank of Captain and transferred to the Staten Island precinct or he can retire now with his pension and dignity intact. Jimmy thanks Frank and he excuses himself to go do more police work.

In the city, Danny and Jackie approach Benita as she is packing up her car. Jackie asks when did Benita find out about King having an affair with Sabrina. She confesses that the night King was shot, he had left his e-mail server open because she was planning to send King a sonogram of their child. Danny asks where did she get the gun and Benita confesses that King had given it to her a year ago. Danny then puts Benita in handcuffs and arrests her for murder. In another part of the city, Jamie is walking in the city when a woman walks up behind him and tells him to keep walking. Jamie knows that it is Officer Lydia Gonsalves. He tells her that he knows she was involved the night his brother, Joe, died. He tries to look behind him and she orders him to keep walking. He reminds her that they were supposed to meet at another corner. She tells him that she lied about them meeting and she has been trailing him for three blocks. Lydia asks Jamie how did he find her, who does he work for, what does he want, and if he thinks about lying she will be gone. Jamie tells her that he got her phone number from the Pension Department and he wants to know what happened to his brother. She tells him to read the police report. He tells her that it was falsified. Jamie asks Lydia why she left the police department. She tells him that, although she loved being a police officer, her daughter needed a mother and not a dead cop. Jamie asks if she had been threatened and if it was The Blue Templar who killed Joe. When Jamie turns around to get an answer, Lydia has disappeared. Jamie continues on walking down the street by himself.

At Danny's house, Danny asks Linda if everything is all right between them. Linda tells him to tell her if he feels that they are. Danny reminds her that he never strayed away from her and he isn't that type of person. Linda agrees with him reminding him of the Danny she first met, when he had a lot of girlfriends. He then reminds her once he stayed with her, he never looked back. Linda further agrees, but admits that sometimes she wonders if he misses that former life. Danny admits that he doesn't and when asked if he means it, he gives Linda a romantic, passionate kiss and they tell each other they love each other."

She asks if he remembers her and tells her that he does. She apologizes for calling late and tells him that she didn't know who to turn to for help. Danny asks if she needs help or is in trouble and she responds by saying she is scared. Danny suggests that she calls 911 or waits for him at his precinct. Anna tells him that she doesn't know if he can help her and tells Danny that somebody else told her that the police can't help her either. Danny asks who told her what she said, Anna then starts to cry and says that nobody can help and she doesn't know why she even called Danny and hangs up the phone.

At One Police Plaza, as Frank is arriving into his office, Detective Abigail Baker is giving him his morning schedule and briefing report. She tells him that Detective William Carter has tried to call Frank. Frank remembers that William was an old partner of his. Frank asks Detective Baker why he was trying to call. Detective Baker tells Frank that some new evidence was found in a case they had worked together 25 years ago. Frank tells Detective Baker to let his security detail know that he is heading back out. Frank gathers his coat and leaves his office.

Near the river, two New York Police Department divers are bringing out a body from the river. Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli have been called in to secure the crime scene. Jamie is getting information from his phone and tells Sgt. Renzulli that the Medical Examiner is still an hour and a half away. Sgt. Renzulli says that the situation they are at is sad and the victim is a beautiful, young girl. Jamie notices that she is still wearing makeup and the crime must have taken place recently. Sgt. Renzulli reminds Jamie that it is not their job to speculate on the crime. They are there to secure the crime scene and wait. He looks up to see Detective Sonny Malevsky walking up to the crime scene. Jamie recognizes his name and tells Sgt. Renzulli that he believes that Sonny used to work with his brother, Joe. Sonny approaches and sarcastically jokes that Sgt. Renzulli finally got his promotion. He then notices Jamie and seeing his last name on his badge, figures out that he is Frank's youngest son. He asks Jamie if this is his first case involving a floating victim in the river, to which Jamie admits. Sonny then admits that the body is still intact, and he should see a body that has been partially eaten by fish and crabs in the river. He then takes out a pair of gloves and starts his investigation.

In another part of the city, Frank has met up with William at a torn down apartment. William shows him the skeletal remains and backpack of a 9-year-old boy named Leo Gates. Frank is certain that it is indeed Leo, but William tells him that it is not known for certain. Frank tells him again that he is certain. William then tells Frank that he is unsure if Leo's mother stills lives in the area which Frank confirms. Frank then orders William to have the Medical Examiner make a positive identification on the body and rules that the case is no longer a missing person case, but a homicide. He then orders the case file to be on his desk as soon and possible and tells William to keep the press away from the case if possible. Back at the river, Sonny rules out suicide since there are no contusions on her body from hitting the water hard if she truly did jump from the bridge. He then comments that if that did happen she probably would have broken her neck, but when he pulls back her hair he finds a bruise on her neck which shows that somebody else had broken her neck before throwing her body from the bridge. He looks in the victim's pockets and finds a piece of paper with Danny's name on it. Sonny then suggests Jamie get a hold of his brother.

At Danny's precinct after getting the news that the victim was Anna, Jackie asks if Danny had called Anna back. He tells her that he couldn't because Anna was calling from a blocked phone number. She then asks how Danny knew her. He tells her that Anna was part of a sting involving prostitution. Anna had lost her daughter and was trying to get her back. Danny had spoken to the Assistant District Attorney about Anna and got her a reduced sentence of mandatory rehab. Danny still feels bad about Anna dying when she was trying to change her life around, but Jackie assures him that they will find the person who killed Anna and try to make Danny feel better.

At Frank's office, Frank is going over the evidence of his case while Detective Baker tries to remind him of his afternoon schedule. Instead of acknowledging his schedule, he tells Detective Baker that he has ordered the people involved in the case be interviewed again and that William needs to make new reports and have them delivered as soon as they are done. Detective Baker obeys Frank's order. Frank then shows Detective Baker a condolence note that was written. She reads it out loud and notices that the letter is not signed. Frank asks Detective Baker if the letter was written by a man or a woman. Detective Baker answers that it was written by a man. She then gets a notice on her phone from the Medical Examiner. The body has been positively identified as Leo Gates by way of dental records. Frank thanks Detective Baker and dismisses her. He looks at a picture of Leo and then orders her to cancel the rest of his schedule for the day.

At Danny's precinct, Danny has found the name of the escort service that Anna had worked for. Jackie found out that somebody was sending flowers to Anna for a very long time to the point where Anna had to file a restraining order. After a phone call to the florist, Jackie comes up with a suspect's name: Richard Hansen. Danny and Jackie then head out to question Richard.

In the city, Frank arrives at Mrs. Gates' house. After she answers the door, she realizes that Frank has found Leo. Frank confirms that he has. She asks him where he was found and Frank tells her that Leo was found behind a false wall in a basement of an old building two blocks from his school. She asks if Leo suffered. Frank tells her that the Medical Examiner classified the cause of his death was blunt force trauma to the head and that the death was instantaneous. Frank asks if the building where Leo was found meant anything to them and she tells him that she and Leo would pass it on the way to school. Every day they would walk to school together and Leo would constantly beg his mother to walk to and from school by himself. She then remembers the day when Leo died, that it was raining and if that was the reason why she didn't get Leo from school. Frank tries to assure her that there are some things no one can completely control even when it means protecting their children every moment of the day. She tries to plead that if things were different, the outcome would be different. Then she decides that she can call a priest and finally have a funeral for her son. She thanks Frank. Frank tells her there is no need to thank him until he brings Leo's killer to justice.

At Danny's precinct, Richard has been brought in for questioning. He immediately denies killing Anna. Danny sarcastically tells him that Anna committed suicide by strangling herself then dumping her own body in the river. Jackie asks Richard where he was the night Anna died. Richard's alibi is that he was at a charity fundraiser at his child's school. Jackie tells him that Anna took out a restraining order on him the night before she was killed. Danny asks why Anna would do that and suggests that she was going to tell Richards' wife about having an affair. Richard asks why he would throw his life away for a whore. Danny reminds Richard that whore was somebody's daughter who was trying to get her own daughter back. Danny then suggests that Anna wanted to stop being an escort and Richard wouldn't let her. Richard claims he can buy any woman he wants. Danny then suggests they call Richard's wife and ask her how she feels about her husband having an affair. Richard then sits down and admits that he was a regular client of Anna's and when she had quit he tried other escorts, but he felt that Anna was special. He further admits that he offered to pay her rent and double the money she would've been making as an escort, but he was turned down. So he turned to sending her flowers to change her mind. Richard then tells them that there was another person who felt the same way he did towards Anna. The other escorts would tell Richard that their boss was the person. Jackie asks for the boss' name. Richard tells him that he would only go by the name John. Jackie says that it is at least a start and Danny warns Richard that his alibi better check out.

At the Reagan house, Detective Baker has brought the new reports from William to his house. Since Frank isn't at home, Henry takes them. When Detective Baker calls Henry, ""Sir"" out of respect, he tells her that he is retired and doesn't need to be called sir and to call him Henry. He then asks if something on her mind and she tells him that the case Frank is working on has consumed him. Henry tells him that all police officers have cases like these and has her sit at the table with him. He tells her of a case he had in 1955 with similar facts. Detective Baker tells him that she feels that Frank is in a dark place. Henry tells her that William and Frank had different opinions on certain facts of the case. Henry tells that a witness had told William that Leo had gotten into the back of a car, but Frank didn't believe it. Frank felt that Leo had never left the block in the neighborhood and was murdered. Detective Baker tells Henry that a forensic report will confirm that Leo was killed after being struck with the round end of a hammer. Henry tells her that Frank's children were the same age as Leo when the crime took place and that it worried Frank deeply.

In the city, Jamie and Sgt. Renzulli are finishing up a dinner break when Jamie asks how he knows Sonny. Sgt. Renzulli tells him that some people become police officers because they love enforcing the law, some because of the security of the job, and some because they have no idea on what to do. Then there is Sonny who is on a big power trip. Jamie asks if there is anything more and Sgt. Renzulli suggests corruption. He then tells Jamie that, when you talk to people like Sonny, you should always have on hand on your wallet and be ready.

At the Reagan house, Frank comes in late and finds Henry reading the case files. Frank grabs a beer from the refrigerator and Henry asks if he misses being a police officer. Frank admits that he does and admits that he wasn't finished being a police officer. Henry reminds him that he did what was needed to be done and Frank reminds him that Henry had done the same thing. Henry denies this saying he wanted the job of police commissioner and that his son should be proud that he was the only police chief that was right for the job. Henry gets up from the table and asks Frank what he is looking for in the case. Frank tells him that he doesn't know and he needs something to jog his memory. He then reminds Henry that he used to say that there is a lot of information in a detective's head that isn't written. Henry scoffs at this saying that Frank has a photographic memory. Frank then admits that there is a piece of evidence in the case that he can't remember. Henry then says good night to his son and leaves to go to bed. Frank sits down at the table, puts on his glasses and starts reading the files again.

At Danny's precinct, Danny gets a phone call that Richard's alibi has been confirmed. Danny then suggests that Jackie look up the person named John who was obsessed with Anna. They find that his name is John Vega and he owns another escort service called Executive Clientele. They go to question John at his company. John declares the women he hires do not engage in having sex with their clients. They are just there to show clients around the town for nights on the town or business dinners. Danny asks if he knew Anna. John tells Danny that he believes that Anna used to work for his accountant. Jackie rebuffs his statement by telling John that Anna was delivering packages to John. John denies this. Jackie asks if John knew that Anna was an escort at the company his was running. John claims that he doesn't recall that information. Danny asks if he recalls where he was when Anna was murdered. He gives an alibi that he was with one of his girls named Jolene. Danny asks for her information to corroborate his alibi and John complies. He then offers Danny the opportunity to try out his services and Danny declines saying that he is married.

At One Police Plaza, Detective Baker reads to Frank that with all the people in the building at the time of Leo's murder, no eyewitnesses claim to have seen Leo get into a car with anyone. He then tells Detective Baker to bring in William. In the city, Danny and Jackie have found Jolene DeMaine. She immediately lets them know that John had told her that they would be looking for her. She confirms John's alibi saying that they had dinner and hung out at her place the whole night. She then hails a taxi and as she leaves, Danny hands her his business card and tells her if she has any information, to call him. Jolene says she won't and leaves in the taxi. Back in Frank's office, Frank asks William on the phone how he is doing with the new set of interviews. William tells him that he has located some people and he is interviewing a witness named Todd Connelly. Frank tells William that Todd is not on his suspect list. William tells Frank that Todd may have seen Leo getting into a car as an attempt to steer the investigation in a different direction. Frank asks about the superintendent of the building named Ted Wessel. Frank had specifically asked him to be interviewed again and wants to know why it hasn't been done yet. William tells him that he has not found Ted yet. Frank orders William to find him or he will transfer William to a different precinct in New York. Frank then orders to investigate everything on Ted.

Back at Danny's precinct, Jackie has found out that John has a criminal record, but nothing involving murder. He asks Jackie if there is any other way to connect John and Anna other than the escort service and Jackie tells him that nothing has been found in her e-mails and phone records. However, she has found that Anna had been speaking to Jolene, including the day she was killed. Danny goes to question Jolene again and at first, she tells them she had already talked to them. Danny tells Jolene that he knows that Jolene and Anna had spoken on the phone because he had talked to her as well. He continues telling her that she sounded afraid because Anna needed somebody to help her and he believes that the person she was afraid of was John. Jackie reminds Jolene about John's alibi story. Jolene reconfirms the story that she did indeed see John that night. Jackie adds that Jolene did not see John for the whole night. Jolene says that she can't help them. Danny asks Jolene if she is going to let John get away for killing Anna and Jackie adds that Anna was strangled so hard that her neck was broken. Anna tries to tell them to stop and Jackie pleads with Jolene to tell the truth. Jolene tells them that they have no idea what John is really like and that she could end up like Anna. Jackie tells her that she could end up in prison for hindering a prosecution. Jolene then confesses that John was obsessed with Anna. Anna had enough of John and threatened to go to the police. Anna had also told Jolene about Danny and said that he can be trusted in which Danny agrees. Jolene continues her story by saying that Anna went to John's office and when she got there John tried to attack her, but Anna had fought him off. Anna tried to end everything and go to the police by running out of John's office. Anna called Jolene and she met Anna at her house. Jolene found Anna and was told that she was going to meet up with Danny at his precinct.

The story then continues in Erin's office. At Anna's house someone knocked on her door and Anna told Jolene to hide in the bedroom. The person at the door was John who was furious with Anna. Anna and John yelled at each other and then the room went quiet. Jolene peeked out through the door and saw John strangling Anna. Erin asks if John had seen Jolene. She tells her that he didn't see her and she left after John took Anna's body to the river. After Anna's body was recovered, he told all his escorts that what happened to Anna is what happens to people who talk to the police. With Jolene's confession and statement, Danny goes to arrest John.

Danny and Jackie find John and arrest him for murdering Anna. When they do, John doesn't seem fazed by this at all and surrenders quietly. At the courthouse, Danny and Jackie are leaving the courthouse when they are approached by Special Agent Stuart LeMarque of the FBI. He tells them that arresting John has caused a problem since John is involved as a confidential informant under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Jackie deduces that is the reason that John never served any jail time for all the felony crimes in his record. John is part of the Rulanti crime family and the FBI is attempting to go after their boss, Tommy Rulanti. Danny doesn't care about this and stands firm that he is going ahead with the murder case against John. Danny and Agent LeMarque go back and forth as to which case is more important. Agent LeMarque leaves and Erin arrives with another problem in the case. John's defense lawyers have asked for Jolene's statement. Danny figures out that if they get Jolene's statement, John will know who helped in putting him in prison for murder. Erin reminds him that it is within the law and it must be done.

At the Reagan house, the family is having their dinner and Danny asks Erin what kind of law is in play. Erin tells her it is a law that guarantees a fair trial. Danny doesn't understand how it is fair that information given to him is going to be turned over to a possible murderer. Frank gets a phone call and excuses himself from the table. Nicky agrees with her uncle saying that it doesn't seem right. Erin tells her that a defendant has the right to know who is accusing him of a crime. Without information like that, the playing field would not be even. Danny tells Erin that a person's life is in danger. Jamie asks Nicky if she would want to live in a world where anybody can have anybody put in jail because they are anonymous. Nicky answers that she doesn't believe that is fair either. Erin thanks Jamie for taking her side, but then he tells Nicky that John is doing this to intimidate Jolene which would ruin the case. Erin un-thanks her brother. Danny's bottom line is that the FBI is trying to make their case more important by taking down a crime family and Anna's murder and memory would fade away and not be important. Jamie asks about the comment the FBI had made that Anna was just a call girl. Sean asks what a call girl is. Linda tells her son that a call girl is someone who talks on their cell phone all the time. Jack suggest that his Aunt Erin is a call girl because she is on her phone all the time which leads to a laughter session at the table. Frank returns to the table and announces that a possible tip in his case has led to a dead end. After dinner, Erin tells her father that she is worried that she may lose her witness in the case. Frank tells her to be ready with another case against John. He then suggests that she go after one of the cases that the FBI haven't brought against John due to him being an informant against the Rulanti family. Erin considers the idea saying that she has a friend in the U.S. Attorney's office.

At the courthouse, the judge is giving his ruling. Erin feels that, if the testimony is released, the witness' identity would be revealed and be put in danger. The defense attorney argues that there is no way she can predict the future. The judge agrees with the defense attorney and rules that Jolene's testimony will be released to the defense team. The defense team then asks for bail to be set for John. Erin tries to object and accuses John of having family ties to a crime syndicate. Danny and Jackie have arrived at Jolene's apartment and they tell her that John has been released on bail. She tries to close the door in their face when they tell her that all they want to do is make her safe. Jolene says that she wants to be left alone and Danny tells her that John will find out that it was her who gave a statement. Danny asks if John threatened her and she tells them that she will not testify against John. Jackie tells her that she has already given her statement to Erin. Jolene tells them that her statement was a lie and she slams the door in their face.

Erin has a meeting with her friend in the U.S. Attorney's office named David. She asks him for any evidence that he has on John. She promises not to jeopardize by his case by promising that she will not bring up the evidence in her case until David presents his evidence against the Rulanti crime family. Erin then calls Danny and lets him know she has obtained the evidence. At Danny's precinct, Danny and Jackie watch hours and hours of surveillance footage of people with escorts in the town. Jackie has announced that after six hours of watching footage she is tired of seeing the same things over and over. Danny notices that John and somebody else are on the footage that he is suspicious of. Danny sees a license plate that belongs to the judge in the case that ruled that Jolene's statement would be given to John's defense team.

At One Police Plaza, Mayor Frank Russo is scolding Frank for missing an important event. Frank apologizes and tells him he is working on an urgent police matter. Mayor Russo asks Frank what his excuse is for missing a meeting with the Director in Charge of the FBI. Frank tells him that he doesn't have one. Mayor Russo tells Frank that the FBI wants the NYPD to not pursue John's case. Mayor Russo starts to get angry saying that, when the FBI demands a meeting, he is to show up and not leave the Mayor by himself. Detective Baker interrupts and announces that William has found Ted and is waiting on the phone for him. Frank excuses himself from the Mayor telling him he needs to take the phone call. Mayor Russo sarcastically understands and leaves Frank's office.

At a precinct, William has been questioning Ted trying to get a confession out of him for hours, but Ted will not confess. Frank watches the interrogation and William leaves the room. Frank suggests talking to Ted and William allows him to do so. Frank goes into the room and asks Ted if he remembers him. Ted tells him that he thinks he is the police commissioner. Frank admits that he is now and then reminds Ted that they had talked the day after Leo went missing. Ted confirms that he indeed was the superintendent of the building and that he had already said the same thing to William. Frank offers Ted something to drink and Ted answers that he is not going to tell Frank anything different than he told William and all he wants to do is leave. Frank opens his briefcase and shows Ted a school assignment that Leo had written the day before he disappeared. In the assignment, Leo had written how much he loves baseball and all he wanted to do in life was play baseball. Frank also shows Ted a picture of Leo.

Ted asks why Frank is doing what he is doing. Frank tells him that he wants to clear up some things. He reminds Ted of what he was wearing the day they spoke. Ted was wearing a work shirt, khaki trousers, boots and a tool belt. He then tells Ted that he has a good memory and he recites something that another superintendent of a building once told him that if something moves, use duct tape, if something squeaks, use WD-40 and if something is stuck, you hit it with a hammer. That saying jogged something in Frank's memory that on the day he and Ted previous spoke, Ted's hammer was missing from his tool belt. Ted starts to crack saying that he would never hit a child on the head with a hammer. Frank asks him how he knew that was what killed Leo. Ted answers that William had told him that and Frank rejects that answer. Leo tries to tell Frank that he had read it in the newspaper and Frank rejects that answer as well. Ted then claims that his hammer was stolen. Frank then sits down and tells Ted that he had told Laura that her son was dead and how painful it is to lose a son. He then shows him the note that he read him. He asks Ted to read it out loud which makes Ted start to cry after he reads it. Frank tells Ted that he believes that a good person wrote that note who had made a mistake and held onto the regret until it destroyed his life. Frank accuses Ted of writing the note which causes Ted to finally breaks down into tears and he starts to confess. Frank tells him to write down his confession and to make sure that he didn't mean to kill Leo.

At the courthouse, John's lawyer is trying to have the charges against him dismissed under the grounds that the only witness has recanted her statement. The judge is about to make a ruling when Danny bursts into the courtroom. The judge orders Danny to stop and sit down or he will find him in contempt of court and Danny charges him with judicial misconduct and solicitation. Vincent Pellegrino from the Office of Court Administration orders the judge to step down from the bench along with two police officers. Danny tells Erin that the judge was identified on one of the surveillance tapes and has been ruling in favor of John in all his legal proceedings. Vincent orders the hearing is under an official review as Danny gives his sister a wink as he leaves the courtroom. As he walks out, he gives Agent LeMarque a sarcastic pat on his shoulder. Outside the courtroom, Erin and Danny meet up with Frank and they each praise each other in their cases. Danny suggests going out to celebrate as a family, but Frank says that he has more work to do and sends them along on their own. Frank has met up with Mrs. Gates and she tells him that she is pleased that the case is finally solved. Frank presents her with an old baseball card that was found in Leo's backpack and she asks if she can finally thank Frank to which he nods. Frank then leaves Mrs. Gates home and into his car with his security detail waiting for him."

He meets with his guild's leader - Greef Carga, who mostly has low paying bounties which will not cover traveling expenses. Looking to get a big bounty, Carga gives him only an address of his next client who wants the bounty to be private.

The Client, who uses Imperial Stormtroopers as bodyguards, gives the Mandalorian a vague target to bring alive. The only information he is allowed to give is an age (50 years old) and last known location. After receiving Beskar, a special metal given to him by the Client to get an armor upgrade, the Mandalorian meets with the Armorer who melts the metal to give the Mandalorian shoulder armor. The Armorer says the metal was gathered in the The Great Purge and the excess will sponsor other foundlings. The Mandalorian says he was once a foundling.

The Mandalorian travels to the desert planet and meets a native named Kuiil who wants to help him so that he can be rid of the criminals and mercenaries who now inhabit the area. Kuiil teaches the Mandalorian to ride a Blurrg, as there are no land speed vehicles to traverse the area, and sends him to where his bounty is located. Upon reaching the hideout, the Mandalorian is forced to team up with bounty droid IG-11.

He asks about the plans for the Child, but is given no answer. When the Mandalorian returns to the secret Mandalorian enclave, his damaged armor is replaced by the Armorer with a new set forged from some of the beskar reward. Another Mandalorian berates him for working with former agents of the Galactic Empire, who are responsible for their predicament; the Armorer defuses the situation by reminding them of the Way of Mandalore. Returning to the guild, the Mandalorian learns from Greef Karga that everyone in the guild had a tracking fob for the child. Greef implores him to take some time to rest, but the Mandalorian insists on taking on another job. He asks Greef if he has any idea what The Client has planned for the child, but Greef says he did not ask as it would be against the guild code, telling him he should forget about it. Despite accepting a new assignment and starting to prepare his ship to depart, the Mandalorian has a change of heart at the last moment, unable to bring himself to leave an innocent baby in the hands of dangerous Imperials, and instead turns back to infiltrate The Client's base of operations. Killing many Imperial stormtroopers, he rescues the Child from a laboratory. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by the other bounty hunters and Greef, who demand he hand the Child over. After he refuses, a firefight breaks out, leaving the Mandalorian heavily outnumbered and cornered, but warriors from the Mandalorian enclave unexpectedly arrive, attacking the bounty hunters and giving the Mandalorian cover to escape. Ambushing the Mandalorian on his ship, Greef gives him one last chance to surrender, but the Mandalorian outsmarts him and shoots him, ejecting him from the spacecraft. The Child's hand appears, reaching up to the console from below; the Mandalorian unscrews a control knob that he had earlier berated the Child for playing with, and drops it into its hand."

Back at the Razor Crest, the Mandalorian is approached by two of the villagers hoping to hire him to drive off the raiders. He accepts in return for lodging in the isolated village and uses their payment to hire Dune for extra help. Once at the village, a widowed mother named Omera takes them in and offers them food. Dune and the Mandalorian find a set of tracks in the mud outside the village and identify that the raiders have a powerful Imperial All-Terrain Scout Transport. Dune insists the villagers leave and make their home elsewhere, but they refuse and decide to fight, which the Mandalorian accepts. The Mandalorian and Dune show the farmers how to defend themselves and then set up traps in the krill ponds for the AT-ST. The Mandalorian and Dune infiltrate the raiders' camp to provoke them into attacking. The AT-ST then chases them back to the village but stops short of the krill ponds. The Klatooinian raiders then attack the villagers, while the AT-ST shoots the village with artillery fire. Dune then gets beneath the AT-ST, shooting into one of the viewports. The AT-ST takes the bait and steps into the pond, sinks, and then falls over. The Mandalorian then throws a thermal detonator into the walker, blowing it up, and the raiders flee back into the forest. With peace having returned, the Child plays happily with the other children. The Mandalorian tells Dune and Omera that he plans to leave the Child there as he feels it would be a better life. However, a Kubazi bounty hunter from the Guild takes aim at the Child from the trees. Before he can fire, Dune shoots him from behind.

Despite having misgivings, the Mandalorian agrees to help him for the bounty, while Calican will take credit for the capture. Peli, meanwhile, has come across the Child and begins to take care of it while working on the ship, growing slightly attached to it. The Mandalorian and Calican travel into the Dune Sea on speeder bikes, looking for Shand. They come upon Tusken Raiders; the Mandalorian barters with them for safe passage. They eventually come across a Dewback with a dead bounty hunter attached to it, which turns out to be bait laid out by Shand to attract anyone looking for her.

The Mandalorian goes to get the Dewback to replace the destroyed speeder, while Calican watches Shand. She tells him that the Mandalorian is a traitor to the guild and that the bounty on the Mandalorian and the Child are worth a great deal more than her bounty. Calican is unconcerned with the bounty, but Shand points out that taking out a Mandalorian would make him a legend. She offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free. However, Calican shoots her, assuming that she would betray him, and heads to the repair facility on the speeder bike, where he captures Motto and the Child.

The recap below contains plot spoilers about Episode 1: Smoke Gets In Your Eyes. If you haven't seen episode 1 check out the Mad Men Schedule to see when we're airing encore presentations or download it on iTunes.

Inside a swank New York City bar, men in suits sip martinis and throw their heads back in laughter. Don Draper, however, sits alone at a booth and scribbles words on a cocktail napkin next to an ashtray of crumpled cigarettes. When a waiter comes by, Don - the creative director for Sterling Cooper ad agency - tries to convince him to convert from his choice of smokes, Old Gold, to his brand, Lucky Strikes.

""Reader's Digest says it will kill you,"" the waiter says.

""Yeah,"" Don pauses and looks around the room. Every hand at the bar holds a cigarette. ""I heard about that.""

That night, Don knocks on the door of a sultry artist, Midge. Despite her flirtations, he's all business. The trade commission has cracked down on tobacco health claims, and Don's without a plan for tomorrow's meeting to keep the Lucky Strike account from leaving the agency: ""All I have is a crush-proof box and four out of five dead people smoked your brand."" He asks to run some ideas past her but when she unbuttons her white blouse to reveal a lacy black bra, he decides to take a break from work for awhile.

The next morning, while Don suggests he and Midge get married, the revolving door of one Madison Avenue high rise whirls with businessmen. On the floor of Sterling Cooper, up-and-comer Pete Campbell - accompanied by an audience of three smooth-talking execs - speaks angelically on the phone to his fiancé. ""I love you,"" he says, igniting chuckles from the men, whose only concern is planning a bachelor party. ""I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?""

Meanwhile, Joan - with fire-engine red hair and the perfect hourglass figure - introduces new girl Peggy to life as a secretary. Among other skills, Joan recommends showing a little leg, encourages her not to be overwhelmed by the typewriter's technology and offers her a doctor who prescribes contraceptives to unmarried women.

As the antacid fizzes in his glass of water, Don stands in his corner office. When he reaches to grab some weights, a purple heart - labeled ""Lt. Donald Francis Draper"" - falls to the floor. He puts it back in the drawer without much thought as Salvatore enters with a mockup of the new Lucky Strikes ad. It's a sketching of a bare-chested man next to a white box with a read dot. The word Relax is at the top. As Salvatore stares proudly at his handiwork and contemplates a pre-meeting drink, Greta - a researcher - comes in to share her report that people's desire for cigarettes is actually a Freudian death wish, and that if you love danger, you should love smoking.

""We can put a skull and crossbones on the label,"" Salvatore jokes.

Greta hands the report to Don who promptly files it into the trashcan. ""I'll take that drink now,"" Don says.

When Peggy brings Pete into Don's office for their next meeting, he looks her up and down. ""Who's your little friend here?"" he asks.

On their way to a meeting with a Jewish-owned department store, Don offers Pete some man-to-man advice about how his playboy escapades - despite the fact that his wedding is this Sunday - will make it hard to climb the ladder. ""You'll die in that corner office, a midlevel exec with a little bit of hair who women go home with out of pity."" Pete's coy smile quickly faded as they walked into the boardroom.

Surprised to find a woman at the other end of the table - along with David Coen, a token Jewish employee from the mailroom - Don has little patience for Rachel Menken's demands to turn her store into the next Chanel nor her distaste for his less-than-innovative idea to offer coupons to housewives. ""I'm not going to let a woman talk to me that way,"" he says as he walks out the door. As David reaches for the pitcher of bloody mary's, Pete follows closely behind Don to offer his superficial support.

""Having money and education doesn't take the rude edge out of people,"" Pete says.

Soon after, Don and Pete join Roger Sterling, the head of the company, in welcoming The Lucky Strike family to the office. While everyone coughs through smoke rings, Roger advises that they are no longer allowed to advertise that cigarettes are safe and opens the floor to Don's big idea.

Silence fills the room as Don fumbles through papers and stammers over his words. Pete jumps up to fill the void, and he offers up the ""death wish"" psychology from Don's trashed report. Shocked by the ""you're-going-to-die-anyway"" slogan, the Lucky Strike gentlemen get up to leave.

Just then, Don has an epiphany. ""Advertising is based on one thing,"" Don says. ""Happiness."" Everyone else's tobacco is poisonous, but Lucky Strike's is ""toasted."" Within moments, the Lucky Strike folk are sold.

Back in Don's office, Roger encourages Don to reconsider the presidential campaign - the agency's got a young, handsome navy hero by the name of Dick Nixon.

With her first day nearly complete, Peggy thanks Don for standing up for her with Pete. She rests her hand on his. After an awkward moment, he removes it. ""I'm your boss, not your boyfriend."" He then chastises her for letting Pete go through his garbage to get the report but tells her that she has a fresh start tomorrow.

The young execs, led by Pete, hit the gentlemen's club and soon find themselves surrounded by girls. ""I love this place,"" one of them says. ""It's hot, loud and filled with men."" Salvatore, his eyes twinkling as he scans the room, agrees.

Meanwhile, Don attempts to reconcile with Rachel, and she teases that the flashy mai tai nearly does the trick. When he asks why she's not married, she admits that - aside from wanting to have the option to be a businesswoman - she's never been in love.

""The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist,"" he says. ""What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons."" Soon, she agrees to come back to the office.

The bachelor party long over, Pete shows up at Peggy's door. She asks why he came. He leans in, his lips brushing against her bangs. ""I wanted to see you tonight,"" he whispers. Without a moment of hesitation, she lets him in.

It's been a long day for Don, and as the rain pours down from the night sky, he takes the train to a parking lot where he drives his car and pulls up next to a picturesque home. As he walks up the stairs to his bedroom, a woman - his wife - wakes up to greet him. He then crosses the hall and walks into the bedroom of his two young children. As he strokes their hair, he looks off into space."

The recap below contains plot spoilers about ""Episode 2: Ladies Room.""

Roger Sterling, three martinis into his dinner with Don and their wives, recounts his upbringing and urges Don to open up about the same. In the ladies room of the restaurant, Betty's hands go numb and Roger's wife Mona must assist her with her lipstick.

Back home, Betty -- tipsy from drinking -- continues Roger's line of questioning and asks her husband if he ever had a nanny. ""It's like politics, religion or sex,"" he says. ""Why talk about it?"" When he finally says that he never had a caretaker, they make love.

The next day at Sterling Cooper, Peggy -- dressed less frumpy than her first day -- chats with Joan about getting her very first paycheck. Peggy's reverie is interrupted when they enter the ladies room and see Bridget sobbing near the stalls.

In Don's office, a group of the junior ad execs clamor around their latest project: canisters of Right Guard, the first aerosol deodorant. Dale and Paul decide to unwittingly test the product on Ken just as Bertram Cooper, one of the agencys partners, steps in. He wants Don to reconsider taking on the Nixon election campaign, and after some discussion, he agrees.

Joan decides to take Peggy out for lunch, but before they make it out the door, Ken, Dale and Harry offer to take them out. Between flirtatious remarks and sexual innuendos, they admit that the office has been rife with speculation about whether or not Peggy has any romantic attachments.

Back at the Draper house, Betty sits in the kitchen with her friend Francine. Francine, six months pregnant, puffs her cigarette as she gossips about a new neighbor, Helen Bishop, a divorcee with a 9-year-old boy and a baby.

A bit later, Betty drives down the tree-lined street in her station wagon with her children, Robert and Sally. As she slows down to watch Helen drag boxes into her new Dutch colonial, her hands go numb and drop from the wheel. The car bounds up a curb and hits a bird bath on the lawn.

Meanwhile, Don rolls off Midge's bed. He looks for a lighter -- and his underwear. He's surprised to see a small portable TV. ""I remember someone wasting a good piece of a beautiful afternoon reciting a diatribe against television,"" he says. When he won't let up, Midge grabs the set by the handle and drops it out her window without a glance.

Hours later, Don arrives home and apologizes for not being reachable when Betty was at the hospital. Betty, who has seen several doctors to no avail, wonders if her numbness isn't a physical condition but a psychological one. She asks if she should see a psychiatrist. ""Doctors must love that they finally have an answer for 'I dont know whats wrong,'"" Don says.

At the next meeting for the Right Guard account, Paul tries to push copy that compares the aerosol can to space-aged astronauts. Don disagrees, contending that the future is actually something that many people fear. Instead, he thinks targeting women might be more effective, but none of the men in the room can figure out just what these women want.

Disgruntled from yet another futile creative gathering, Paul chats up Peggy at the pie cart. He then gives her an unofficial tour of the office and explains the delicate hierarchy of the different departments: There's media -- they buy space and sell at a markup -- as well as accounting, account management -- those with no talent and plenty of vanity -- and, of course, creative.

Feeling guilty for assuming that Betty has it all and has nothing to be unhappy about, Don comes home with a white gold watch. She's thankful but, through tears, asks again if she should see someone.

At 11 a.m. the following day, Don sits outside Midge's apartment. He took his wife to a shrink and called in sick. Over on Park Avenue, Betty lies on the leather daybed of Dr. Arnold Wayne and awkwardly alludes to her anxiety.

With Don out of the office the Sterling Cooper creative team is scarce. Unlike Salvatore, Peggy remains hard at work. She knocks on Paul's office to tell him that she's too busy to go to lunch, and he responds by closing his door and kissing her. She pulls away. ""I think we've misunderstood each other,"" she says, admitting that there's someone else. Back at her desk, she's ready to follow suit and leave early until Joan arrives with more work. Noticeably moody, Peggy asks, ""Why is it that every time a man takes you out to lunch, you are the dessert?"" Ready to break down in tears, she heads to the ladies room only to find yet another woman already doing so by the stalls.

Feeling better after a romp with Midge and after figuring out that what women really want is ""any excuse to get closer,"" Don takes his wife out to dinner in the city before heading home. As he watches Betty climb the stairs to bed, he goes into his study and shuts the door behind him. He picks up the phone and calls Dr. Wayne who remarks, ""I had a very interesting hour with your wife this afternoon."""

After his picture appears in a local newspaper, Adam Whitman, a man who claims to be his younger brother, approaches him.

Ominously, when Don goes into the bathroom and closes the door, the vibration makes a nail come loose on his award and causes the horseshoe to turn 180 degrees.

Don is late for work, but everyone compliments him on his award. Someone says there is a photo of him in an advertising journal. Don says it is a good thing no one reads it. Peggy tells him some people have commented on his lateness by saying his award has gone to his head. How rude, Don says off-handedly. Don has a meeting scheduled with his account executives, but only one, Ken Cosgrove, is there. Ken has been showing Peggy the short story he just got published in the Atlantic Monthly. He tells Don about it. Peter Campbell and Paul join the meeting and are surprised to learn that Ken is a writer let alone that he has published something. Ken tells them about the plots of his two novels, and Paul ruefully comments, Those ideas aren't even stupid, and asks if he can read the manuscript of one of the novels. Ken agrees. The meeting officially begins as they discuss a client, a bank that is giving away toasters to new customers. There is more or less general agreement that this give-away idea is not only stale but targets women who rarely control the family purse strings. Paul and Don come up with the idea of private (Paul's word) or executive (Don's word) accounts for men, obviously geared toward men who want to keep some of their finances away from their wives.

After the meeting, Peggy tells Don he has a call from Bix Beiderbecke. This turns out to be Midge who tells Don she used the late trumpeter's name because she wants to play the horn. Peggy picks up the phone without remembering that it is still open to the line Don is using. She overhears Midge ask Don to come over and ravish her immediately. Peggy carefully re-cradles the phone. Don comes out of his office and tells Peggy he'll be gone until after lunch.

The account executives, other than Ken, gather in Pete's office. Pete and Paul are especially self-pitying and jealous of Ken's success. Pete complains that Ken's father is just a salesman, to which Paul retorts, what difference does that make? But when Pete observes that Ken has been published in a national publication, which his own father reads, Paul agrees, That hurts.

Later in the episode, Ken is regaling the secretarial pool about his novels. Paul walks in and says he read one and it is good. Saying that he would like to give his girlfriend a copy of Ken's story to read, Paul takes the magazine from Ken and tears out the pages, folds them, and puts them in his breast pocket. Later still, when the two men are alone, Paul apologizes for his behavior, explaining that he just never thought that he was in competition with Ken. You lost, says Ken.

Don and Midge finish making love, and, as Midge points out, Don waits until that moment to complain about Midge calling him at work. But Don allows that he likes coming to see her, and she comments that he seems like two different people and that he becomes a different person as soon as he comes into Midge's apartment.

At a general meeting, Sterling compliments Ken on finishing something and makes several of his usual comments implying that nobody at the agency really ever does any work. Accounts from previous episodes, including the Lucky Strike cigarette one, are mentioned, so we know these are still on-going. Sterling says they will have to wait until after the November elections to see whether the government is likely to take any action against the tobacco industry. The meeting is interrupted by Peggy with a message for Don. A man named Adam Whitman has arrived and is asking for Don. Don looks stunned. He leaves the meeting and confronts Adam who says, It really is you, Dick. He says he is Don's brother, and he works as a janitor. He found the advertising journal with Don's picture in an office trash can. He had thought Don/Dick was dead. Don tries to deny he is Dick, but Adam does not believe that. Don promises to meet Adam at a coffee shop at noon. Don goes back to the meeting but is so distracted that he almost doesn't respond when he is called upon.

Don meets Adam in the coffee shop. Adam reveals that Don disappeared after the Korean War and that his mother has now died. Don comments, she wasn't my mother and she never let me forget that. Adam says that after his mother died Dad passed, too. Don does not indicate whether he has any feelings about that. Adam says that, back in 1953, he had thought he saw Dick/Don in his uniform peeking out of a window. He always suspected his brother was still alive. He wants to know why Don left, but Don only says he couldn't go back. Don finally admits that he missed Adam, but he won't tell Adam anything about his life now. When Adam says he wants to be in Don's life again, Don says, no. He gets up to leave and says that this meeting never happened.

Meanwhile, Betty and her two children arrive at the office because there is an appointment with a photographer for a family portrait. Peggy panics and seeks advice from Joan about what to do. Joan persuades Peggy to tell where she suspects Don is, which is with Midge. Joan says Peggy should not have told that about her boss but promises she'll never tell. She also advises Peggy to keep it simple and just say she forgot to remind Don. Let him come up with his own excuse. He'll have one.

Peggy awkwardly entertains Betty. At one point, Betty makes the remark that Peggy knows Don better than she. Peggy does not say anything. Don returns and says he was at the printers. Peggy tries taking the blame, but Don plays the gracious boss. When he walks out with his family, Peggy is considerably relieved. She later discusses it with Joan, telling her that this seems like an odd job. Joan says that this is the greatest job, apparently reveling in the intrigue.

Betty tells her neighbor and best friend that Don's forgetting that they had an appointment leads her to doubt he puts her very high on his list of priorities. They agree that their husbands behave infinitely better in the suburbs than they do in Manhattan.

Don and his team meet with the banker and tell him their idea about private executive accounts. The banker does not completely reject the idea, but he laughs. When Don asks why, he explains: 1) Many men already have such accounts, there just hasn't been a name for it; 2) advertising the existence of such accounts might only bring up embarrassing conversations between husbands and wives.

Pete and his wife,Trudy, discuss his short story, which is about a hunter and a bear. Trudy thinks it is odd because the bear seems to be talking. Pete explains that the bear is not talking; that is just what the hunter thinks the bear is thinking. He would like her to help get it published by using her connection with Charlie Fiddich, who is in publishing, even though Pete knows that Charlie is her ex-lover. Trudy is clearly hurt over being essentially pimped out to Charlie, but she agrees to go see him. Sure enough, when she meets with Charlie he propositions her, but she pleads for him to drop it.

Don receives an envelope from Adam. It contains a photo of Dick/Don in his uniform with a boy, presumably Adam. With it is a slip of paper from a hotel with a note from Adam telling Don his room number is 5G.

Trudy reports to Pete that his story is to be published in Boys' Life magazine. Pete is disappointed. They'll probably put it next to an ad for exploding cigars. He whines that his story is good enough for the New Yorker and accuses Trudy of deliberately holding him back. Trudy says she could have gotten it into the New Yorker. Pete asks why didn't she. She asks how he could put her in that position. Pete just pouts, evidently not picking up, or not caring(?), that Trudy is implying that in order to get his story published in a better magazine she would have had to sleep with Charlie.

At the Draper family dinner table, Betty is talking about her parents' summer home in Cape May and how it is so far away from New York that Don is hardly ever there. She asks Don why he is preoccupied, and he says he is trying to decide whether he must go back to the office tonight.

After dinner, Don calls Adam and tells him he will come see him in 25 minutes. Don opens a desk drawer and puts an open briefcase on top of the desk. He reaches into the drawer and begins to remove something. Don brings the brief case to Adam's room in a very modest hotel/rooming house. Adam is ecstatic, noting that Don looks more like the person he remembers than he did during their earlier meetings. Don asks whether Adam has anyone in his life; specifically, he asks about Abigail and Uncle Mac. Adam says they are not in his life, without saying explicitly whether or not they are dead. Adam comments on Don's success and says they always said Don was too smart for his own good. Then he recalls that Mac always said Don was too soft. But you aren't soft, are you? No, says Don, I'm not. Don explains that he has a new life and it only goes in one direction: forward. He opens the briefcase and gives his brother five thousand dollars. (Known in slang as five grand or five G, just like Adam's room number.) Don tells Adam to take the money, leave New York, and never contact Don again. Anguished, Adam says that this isn't what he wanted from Don. Don tells him, This is all that I can give you. He tells Adam to go back to thinking that his brother is dead. He urges Adam to reflect on the fact that with five thousand dollars (a lot of money in 1960) he could make a new life for himself. Don allows Adam to hug him, but Don breaks it off first. You going to be OK? Don says. Adam nods. When Don gets home, Betty tells him she knows that Don is uncomfortable about having to use her parents' summer home. He says, I just don't like the way your father looks at me. She replies, Well, you took away his little girl. Betty then suggests that they buy their own summer home, perhaps closer to New York. But Don says that he likes going to Cape May. Besides, we're not that flush right now. It's nothing to worry about, but maybe we can afford to buy a summer home next year. Uncharacteristically, there is no ironic song on the sound track at the end of this episode."

The new switchboard operator is smitten with Salvatore and flirts with him.

Peggy organizes an after work celebration of her successful ad and invites Pete. Salvatore has drinks with one of the lipstick execs who makes a pass at Sal, who is interested but fearful. ""What are you afraid of?"" asks the exec. ""Are you kidding?"" replies Sal. He shakes hands very formally and leaves.

Peggy tries to get Pete to join in dancing but he tells her he does not like her this way. (Happy and triumphant?) Pete leaves. Peggy has some tears.

Don goes to Midge's apartment and snipes at and is sniped at by her beatnik friends, but they also end up smoking marijuana together. Don shows Midge his bonus check and tries to persuade her to come with him on an impromptu trip to Paris, but she turns him down. Don has a flashback to his Depression Era childhood when Don's name was Dick: A hobo comes to their house and, while the man of the house (Dick's father Archie Whitman) tries to reject the hobo, Dick's stepmother Abigail Whitman takes in the hobo and tries to give him a coin in advance for working for food. The head of the house confiscates the coin, implying he will pay the hobo after he has worked. The hobo talks to Dick before bedtime and teaches him symbols used by hobos to mark houses they visit. The last symbol means ""a dishonest man lives here."" Dick reveals that someone has taught him to think of himself as ""the whore's son."" (We are not told who calls him this.) The hobo seems to be the first person Dick has ever met who doesn't want to stigmatize him. The next day, the hobo works, but Archie doesn't pay him. As the hobo leaves, Dick notices the symbol for ""dishonest man"" has been carved on their fence.

Back in 1960: Don takes an instant photo of Midge and her friend and, looking at the picture, realizes they are in love. Nevertheless, he proposes once more to Midge that they go to Paris.

Don steps out into the lobby of a theater. He seems less than thrilled that Fiorello! is only half over when Jim Hobart approaches. Jim, the head of a rival advertising agency, mentions how he and some of New York's most influential were talking about Don's campaigns at the Athletic Club. He encourages Don to consider moving up in the professional world. ""If you were with me at McCann, you'd have over 500 people at your disposal,"" he says. ""We can get a lot of things done.""

Their wives approach. Adele, Jim's wife, links arms with Don to get drinks at the bar while Jim chats up Betty. He sees an uncanny resemblance in Betty to Grace Kelly. She admits to dabbling in modeling when she was younger, and Jim thinks she could be just the look for his Coca-Cola campaign. She takes his business card.

The next day, as Betty tidies up the kids toys -- including a BB gun -- she tells Francine about Jim's offer. She remembers when she was a muse to Italian fashion designer Gianni. Within moments, they are in her bedroom as Betty tries on all the dresses he'd made for her.

When Don gets to his office, he notices a package on his desk. It's from Jim, and it's a membership to the Athletic Club. Don calls him and proceeds to listen to Jim's pitch, which includes a high salary, an international network and clients that include Pan Am and Esso. Don thanks him for the gift and hangs up.

At Dr. Wayne's office, Betty continues to revel in her days as a model. She explains that she met Don while modeling a coat. She also remembers how her mother was dead set against her nascent career, comparing modeling to prostitution. ""You're angry at your mother,"" Dr. Wayne stated. For the first time, Betty took offense to his provocation: ""She wanted me to be beautiful so I could find a man -- there's nothing wrong with that.""

In the Sterling Cooper conference room, the men watch a 30-second video of Jackie Kennedy speaking in Spanish and discuss their plan of attack for how to handle Nixon's campaign. Salvatore thinks women will hate Jackie anyway: ""It's like their better-looking sister married a handsome Senator and now she's going to live in the White House? I'm practically jealous.""

Back at the Draper residence, Betty pulls a ham from the fridge while she reveals to Don that she wants to return to modeling for a few days a week. Don starts to argue but gives up.

The next day, Peggy feverishly scrubs a piece of paper with an eraser when it drops to the floor. When she bends to pick it up, she hears a loud rip. Her skirt split down the side. She ties a sweater around her waist and goes into the break room, where Joan, Marge and Lois are chatting. Joan offers Peggy her spare outfit to avoid ruining her silhouette.

Meanwhile, Roger shows up in Don's office with golf clubs. He says they're from Jim and mentions the bonus Cooper gave him. ""It was designed as a kind of armor against men like Jim Hobart,"" he says. ""I like to think there's more holding you to Sterling Cooper than trinkets."" Roger tries to explain that big clients such as Pan Am aren't as glamorous as they seem and the hands-on approach doesn't follow to big companies, but Don remains silent. ""It's business,"" he says.

As the other men gossip about Don's offer, they notice Peggy in a very attractive yet ill-fitting dress. They switch subjects and focus on Peggy's newfound big-headedness now that she's writing copy. Pete, however, just listens before leaving entirely.

He and Harry retreat to his office to discuss the Secor laxatives campaign before they go on a tangent about fraternity memories. As Pete's halfway through a story about how one of his pledges had a funeral for the house dog, Mamie, during a beauty pageant parade, he gets an idea. To boost Nixon's chances in the undecided states, they'll need to decrease Kennedy's presence there -- and they'll do that by buying up on-air ads for laxatives. ""We're selling laxatives, Nixon's selling Nixon and Kennedy's watching Mamie's funeral,"" Pete says.

In the reception area of McCann Erickson sit a row of young models. Among them is Betty, wearing the dress she'd tried on earlier. Clearly overdressed, she fidgets with self-consciousness until Jim arrives. His colleague Ronnie Gittridge, who handles the art for Coca-Cola, escorts her to the audition.

The phone rings at the Draper residence. It's for Betty. She's the girl with the Cola. Feeling proud, she seduces Don, and as he unzips her dress, he seems genuinely happy for her.

The next day, Betty puts on a smile for the photographer as she sits on a picnic blanket with her bottle of soda. Meanwhile, Ethel -- in her 60s -- sits asleep on the couch as Robert, Sally and their dog Polly barrel through the living room into the backyard. Just then, their neighbor Ross lets some pigeons out of a cage and Polly grabs one in her mouth. Quickly, Ross grabs Polly by the collar and the bird falls from her mouth. It's wounded but healthy. ""I see that dog in my yard again, I'm going to shoot it,"" he says.

That night, Betty wakes up to the sound of Sally sniffling and sobbing. She had a bad dream that Ross was going to kill Polly. This is news to Don and Betty. Angry, Don gets up to have a few words with his neighbor, but Betty stops him.

In Don's office, Harry, Paul and Pete all compliment -- some more reluctantly than others -- Don's work on the Lucky Strike campaign when >Roger and Cooper barge in. ""Who is responsible?"" Cooper asks, regarding the purchase of yet unproduced Secor commercials. Harry and Pete timidly take ownership, and to their surprise, get nothing but congratulations.

Before Don leaves, he gets another envelope from Jim. This time it's pictures of Betty and her ideal family from the shoot. A bit disgusted, Don flips them face down and leaves and beelines for Roger's office. He demands a raise with no contract and Roger obliges, happy with Don's decision to stay. Don assures his boss that if he leaves, it won't be for advertising. ""I'd like to stop talking about it and get back to it some day,"" he says about life.

Don calls Jim to decline the offer, despite Jim getting his wife into the company. ""It's a pity to lose both of you,"" he says. Meanwhile, Betty poses for another shoot when Ronnie approaches with some bad news. They're looking for more Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.

Pete and the boys are celebrating his success in the bullpen when Peggy walks by. As they did before, they make fun of her. ""They call a girl like her a lobster,"" Ken says. ""All the meat's in the tail."" All of a sudden, Pete clocks Ken in the jaw. They fight onto the ground while Don and Roger leave, unphased.

That night, Betty tells Don over a casserole that although they offered her many possibilities, she doesn't think she wants to go back to modeling after all. Don gets it. The next day, Betty goes through her morning routine and sits in the kitchen. When she notices the pigeons circling the sky, she grabs the BB gun, takes aim and fires at the birds."

Don comes down the steps for work as Sally cheers, Grandpas here! And Aunt Gloria! He goes into the kitchen to find Bettys dad sitting at the table, Gloria standing beside him. He wants sugar in his tea, but Betty only allows him saccharine. Theyre getting ready to leave for the beach when Betty suggestively asks Don to help her with something upstairs.

Was she waiting at the funeral unbuttoning her top button? Betty asks, regarding her fathers new girlfriend. Shes a vulture. Don tries to calm her down and suggests that her father cant even fix himself a cup of tea by himself after having been married for 40 years.

Don heads to the office for one more day before the long weekend. There, the men are watching a Kennedy campaign, trying to strategize their next move for their pro-bono work with Nixon. Perhaps a negative ad would be more powerful than a positive one, which only attracts people who already like him. Don thinks there is more to the story: Kennedy? Nouveau riche, a recent immigrant who bought his way into Harvard. Nixon is from nothing. Abe Lincoln of California, a self-made man. Kennedy, I see a silver spoon. Nixon, I see myself.

They cut that meeting short for another, this one with the Menkens -- both Rachel and her father Abraham. Abraham is somewhat open to the suggestions Sterling Cooper offers -- they want to add a restaurant on the ground floor and close the store during construction -- but he has concerns that hes creating a store that even he wouldnt shop in.

Don, looking at Rachel, describes how his customers have changed: Theyre like your daughter, educated and sophisticated. They are fully aware of what they deserve and are willing to pay for it.

Roger passes Joan in the hall and tells her that his wife and daughter are out of town this weekend, so they can do whatever they want. Instead, she asks to see the new movie, The Apartment before making a comparison to how Shirley MacLaines character was handed around to the office men like a tray of canapés.

As Joan puts up a memo in the break room, her friend Carol -- her eyes bloodshot -- walks in. She had just gotten fired after covering for her boss. These men, were always building them up, and for what? Joan says. Diner and jewelry? Who cares? They decide to spend the weekend on the town in search of actual bachelors.

Meanwhile, Pete walks into Dons office with some bad news. They lost the Dr. Scholls account because, as Pete says, they were disappointed with the creative. Angry, Don shoves everything off his desk onto the floor. He goes to Rogers office, where hes getting his hair trimmed, and tells him the latest.

The day you sign a client is the day you start losing them, Roger says, echoing Dons sentiments.

On the main floor, Pete pesters Peggy while she tries to ignore him. Every time I walk by I wonder, are you going to be nice to me or cruel? Peggy says when he wont let up. Disappointed, Pete walks away.

Meanwhile, the other ad men are busy flirting with a group of models, all sets of twins, at the Cartwright double-sided aluminum casting call. Roger and Don show up and set their sights on Eleanor and Mirabelle Ames. Roger hires them on the spot and requests a private celebration upstairs in his office. Drinks all around, Roger flirts relentlessly. Do you love your sister? he prods. Why dont you show her how much? Give her a kiss. Before anything happens, Don rises to leave. Before he can, Eleanor asks him to dance.

Across town, Joan and Carol are getting ready in Joans bedroom. When Joan notices Carol staring, Carol reveals her true feelings. I did everything I could to be near you -- all with the hope that one day you would notice me, she says. Joannie, just think of me as a boy. As she finishes packing her purse, Joan simply asks if they can forget about it and just go out.

Later that night, Joan and Carol return with Franklin, a Fordham college professor, and Ralph, a carpenter. When Joan asks Franklin to change her light bulb -- in her bedroom -- Ralph makes a move on Carol.

Back at Sterling Cooper, Don and Eleanor sit in Dons office when they hear Mirabelle scream. I knew I shouldnt have asked him to do it a second time, she says. Don rushes in to find Roger, naked on the floor. Several moments later, two orderlies push a gurney with a conscious Roger toward the elevator lobby.

At the hospital, Roger recovers from a heart attack and asks Don if he believes in human energy, like a soul. When his wife Mona arrives, he breaks down and cries. Then, his daughter Margaret comes in. The three embrace.

That night, Joan rushes to the office to help Cooper send out telegrams to all Roger Sterling clients, assuring them that business will go uninterrupted. She holds back tears as Cooper tells her she could do better. Don calls Betty to tell him he wont be going to the beach house, and Pete watches a television ad for Kennedy -- in which President Eisenhower trashes Nixon -- in the hospital waiting room.

Don knocks on the door of an apartment. Rachel, in a robe with tousled hair, answers. She lets him in and fixes him a drink. He leans in and kisses her desperately. Is this like the end of the world, she asks, stopping him. Just do whatever you want?

Don opens up and talks about the first time he was a pall bearer and being that close to death. This is it, this is all there is, he says. And its slipping through my fingers. They kiss passionately, slowly laying back onto the couch. He asks if she really wants this. Yes, please, she replies.

Afterwards, Don opens up once more. His mother was a prostitute, and when she died in childbirth, they delivered the baby to his father and his wife. His father was a drunk who got kicked in the face by a horse. When he died, she took up with another man. I was raised by those two sorry people."

She finds an interesting use for it, however. Afraid of losing the Lucky Strike cigarette account, Bert Cooper gets Roger Sterling to come in for a one-hour meeting but he has another attack. Don Draper becomes a partner and takes over for his friend Roger, but so...

The package is addressed to Donald Draper at 405 Madison Avenue. It costs 40 cents, but Adam hands the man a $5 bill.

Back in his hotel room, Adam throws the pile of bills that Don gave him on the table. He places a note that says, ""Enjoy next to the pile"". Then, he removes his belt and pulls a chair next to a ceiling pipe. He threads the belt around his neck and around the pipe before kicking the chair out from under him. His feet dangle as he hangs himself.

Its October at Sterling Cooper, and Roger is still out recovering. Joan prods Don about his condition but is flustered by her own lack of aloofness.

The ad men congregate in Dons office. On the coffee table is a pink plastic belt shaped like womens panties with a small control box and electric cord. After they timidly inspect it, they discover that its a weight loss invention. Whether it actually causes weight loss is yet to be determined, and Pete is skeptical to promote it. It might be a lightning rod for the government and other people out to kill advertising, he says.

Just then, Peggy walks in. As she leaves, the men jokingly suggest that she might be a good candidate to try the Electrosizer. Fred, however, thinks shed be able to put her creative talents to work by testing it out. Later that night, Peggy sits in her bedroom, papers spread on her bed. She decides to give the contraption a try. Peggy turns the dial, and immediately becomes aroused by the vibrations. She peels it off in a hurry.

In another bedroom, Don stares at Rachel. She admits that she thinks about them being together. ""I dont know if I understand how this works or where it goes,"" she says. ""I´m worried this is a fantasy.""

The next day, Peggy awkwardly shares with Don what shes discovered about the Electrosizer. She struggles to explain that she felt something that most women would like to feel. It vibrates, and that coincides with how you wear it, she says. Its probably unrelated to weight loss. Don realizes this new benefit and asks Peggy to figure out how to put it into words.

Cooper tells Don that he just spent the morning talking the Lucky Strike account ""off the ledge."" They recently lost a lawsuit and they are nervous about continuing to do business with Sterling Cooper due to Roger's heart attack. They´ll need to be ready for a big lunch meeting tomorrow -- with Roger.

At the Draper residence, Betty gets a visit from a door-to-door air conditioning salesman named Bob Shaw. When Betty says shes not interested, he asks to come in for a glass of water. He persists, but she doesnt think the Indian Summer will last much longer. He continues to explain how cold air is escaping through their windows and offers to take some measurements. She accepts the offer, and as they both walk up the stairs to look at the bedroom window, she hesitates. ""You know, my husband, I think he´d rather go to Sears,"" she says, forcing him to leave.

That night, when Betty mentions the salesmans suggestions, Don fumes over her letting a stranger into the house.

The next day, Roger -- washed out and tired -- walks with Mona into the bullpen for the first time since his heart attack. A crowd gathers and applauds as he, Don and Cooper go into Rogers office.

Joan enters with instructions to help with his coloring. As she applies foundation to his cheeks, they admit they missed each other. ""I´ve had a lot of time to think about the things I´ve done and been sorry about,"" he says. ""And being with you is not one of them."" Joan wells up with tears.

Men congregate in the conference room for the meeting with Lee Garner Senior and two other Lucky Strike executives. Don and Roger, all smiles, enter and get down to business. Anti-smoking legislation is in progress, but it could be a few years before they put warning signs on packages. Then, Roger lights up a cigarette as he bites into his pastrami sandwich. ""Oh, oh Jesus!"" he shouts, clutching his chest. Once again, Roger is wheeled away by ambulance drivers.

Harry, Paul, Pete, Ken and Salvatore sit in Petes office, debating what might happen to the company. Sal jokes that he already sent out his resume, but Harry thinks Don will become partner. When they all start wondering if Don likes them, Pete shrugs in annoyance.

That evening, Peggy sits at La Trombetta, a seafood restaurant, with her date Carl Winter -- a blue collar truck driver in his best suit. When Peggy mentions how her Belle Jolie copy will appear in some high-fashion magazines, Carl remarks that advertising is simply a lot of people screaming at you from the walls and television. She´s offended, but he reminds her of her reaction when he said he drives a truck for a living. ""You can act like youre from Manhattan, but you don´t look like those girls,"" he says.

Angry, she gets up to leave. ""Those people in Manhattan?"" Peggy says. ""They are better than us. They want things they haven´t seen.""

Later that night, Don calls Dr. Wayne. He´s angry that Betty is in worse shape than she was before therapy. After hundreds of dollars, all you´ve managed to do was make her more unhappy, he says. Dr. Wayne suggests moving toward psychoanalysis, which is at least three visits every week.

The next day, Peggy gives her presentation of the new product. ""Women lose weight so they´ll feel good about themselves,"" she says. ""Combined with a sensible diet, the Rejuvenator -- you´ll love the way it makes you feel."" They love the pitch but are still confused as to what it actually does. ""From what I understand, it provides the pleasure of a man without the man,"" Don says. He offers a critique. It needs a new name and a clever code word so women will know its real utility.

In Ossining Betty attends to the laundry. When the washing machine goes into its spin cycle it begins to clatter against the floor and wall. Leaning it to steady it, she feels the vibrations and closes here eyes as she fantasizes about having sex with the air conditioning salesman on top of her dresser.

Back at the office, Peggy timidly asks for her own desk. She´s interrupted when Cooper asks to speak to Don in private. He offers to make him a partner. When Don accepts, Pete is the first to congratulate him. Don, high off his promotion and raise, gives Peggy a raise, and the rest of the day off. Pete sneaks in to Dons office to sit behind the desk. Just then, the mailroom boy delivers the package from Adam.

Curious, Pete shakes the box. He takes it with him as he leaves."

Don enters with Herman Duck Phillips, who had been in London with Y&R, a bigger agency. He, however, is eager to return to New York and even more eager to take the open job -- Head of Account Services -- at Sterling Cooper.

After Cooper finishes grilling the candidate, Duck and Don walk by the other ad men, whove been chatting about who might be president by the end of the night. Hes the best one Drapers paraded around, Ken says, regarding Duck. Lets see if Cooper is smart enough to know that.

Pete then goes into Dons office to make his case for why he should get the position. I have the loyalty of our most important clients, he says, mentioning Calvin Highland and Lee Garner. These men trust me. Don suggests that Pete, whos been with the company for two and a half years, be patient because hes still at the point where someone will always be his senior.

When Don heads home for the night, he notices Paul, Harry, Joan, Ken, Hildy and some others standing around quietly. As soon as the elevator doors close behind him, the group squeals with laughter. Drinks are passed around and a TV is wheeled out into the bullpen. They flip it on to an anchor reporting that Senator Kennedys odds for victory are a grim 22 to 1. They applaud. Paul pours scotch until the bottle is empty. They are going to need more liquor.

As the night goes on and the numbers get closer, the group gets friskier. Allison walks by and Ken starts to chase her as Paul and Harry shout colors. Ken pulls Allison to the ground and hikes up her skirt to reveal her panties. Who had blue? he shouts back. As everyone laughs, Peggy and Marge stand expressionless. I used to think Id find a husband here, Marge says. Peggy just leaves.

Pete, sitting in the dark living room of his apartment, leafs through Adams shoebox. In it, he peers at dog tags, letters and photographs, one of which shows a young Don and Adam riding horses. He flips it to see Dick and Adam, 1944 written.

Just then, Trudy walks in. Shes noticed him sneaking around with that box and wonders why he wont return it.

Back at Sterling Cooper, Ken comes out of Pauls office with a stack of papers. Death is My Client -- a play in one act by Paul Kinsey, he reads. Paul, embarrassed, tries to get it back. Its not long, however, before hes instead positioning actors around the room and directing the ad hoc production. Joan holds the script as Salvatore, playing Tolefson -- the hero -- reads lines over her shoulder. As he scrolls down the page, he notices a gripping scene. He and Joan look at each other, and Sal pulls in for a dramatic kiss. The audience cheers as they kiss.

Just then, the TV turns up to show that Nixon took Ohio, a pivotal victory. They cheer, dance and embrace. Harry plants a kiss on Hildy, who returns the gesture. Shocked by his own action, Harry retreats to his office. She follows, and they kiss again.

The next morning, Peggy arrives to see the office in shambles and people, coffee in hand, walking around painfully in last nights clothes. She smells something pungent at her desk -- her trashcan is filled with vomit.

Don enters Coopers office, confused by three different newspapers with three different results. A recount of the election means 30 days without a president, which is no way to win, according to Cooper. If Kennedy is willing to buy an election, hes probably willing to play ball with us.

Then, Pete brings Adams box to Don in his office, and when he makes no more progress with the promotion, Pete reveals that he knows Dons past. According to his friend at the defense department, Dick Whitman died in Korea 10 years ago. A man named Donald Draper dropped off the map although hes 43 years old.

Don recognizes the attempt at blackmail but doesnt back down. If your information is powerful enough to make them do what you want, what else can it make them do? he says, fuming. Pete leaves, and Don rips open the box.

He flashes back to a dirt road in Korea in 1950. A lieutenant watches as Dick jumps out of the back of an army truck and is disappointed to see that only one soldier -- he needed 20 for his mission to build a field hospital. Dick introduces himself. The lieutenant follows suit. Draper. Its Lieutenant Don Draper.

Back in his office, Don puts the shoebox in the same drawer as the Purple Heart.

He goes to Rachel Menkens office with a sudden desire to go to Los Angeles with her for good. Although he piques her interest, she reasons that she has a store to run and he has a family. They fight, and she realizes that he doesnt want to run away with her. He just wants to run away.

Don returns to the office and approaches Pete, passing a TV with Kennedys face. ""I thought about what you said, and then I thought about you and what a deep lack of character you have,"" he says, adding that he will hire Duck. Pete threatens to go to Cooper, but Don calls his bluff and walks out to give Cooper the news. Confused at how Don would rather lose it all than see him succeed, Pete follows Don into Coopers office with him. Don tells Cooper hes hiring Duck, then looks to Pete. Pete returns the glance and tells Cooper how Don is really Dick Whitman, a deserter and criminal.

""Who cares?"" Cooper replies as Don calmly lights another cigarette. ""This country was built and run by men with worse stories than whatever you've imagined here.""

Don flashes back to Korea. Dick stands in a trench when Lt. Draper storms out of his tent. Thunderous mortar explosions get closer until gunfire erupts and bullets zoom by their heads. As quickly as the attack began, it ends. The two light cigarettes when they notice a stream of liquid at their feet. Lt. Draper thinks Dick wet himself, but when Dick drops his cigarette, they realize its gasoline.

They run as a fireball drops them to the dirt. Moments later, Dick wakes up and struggles to lift his body, with his arm and ribs broken. He sees whats left of Lt. Don -- guts open, intestines strewn on the ground, flesh charred. He finds Dons dog tags and pulls them from the body. He rips his own off before dangling Dons around his neck.

The next day at the military hospital, Don receives his Purple Heart and news that he's going home -- with the task of returning Dick to his family. When Don and an army chaplain arrive at the rural Pennsylvania train station where the Whitmans stand waiting, he tells the chaplain he can't do it. He watches from a distance as the casket is set near 10-year-old Adam. Just then Adam looks toward the train and makes eye contact with Don. As the train pulls away, Adam shouts: ""There he is, I see him!""

Don, back to reality and at home, turns on his television and watches a replay of Nixons concession speech.

The firm contemplates making some advertisements for candidate Nixon."

Tom thinks it's time to take focus off work. ""The only family and business you should be mixing is the production of a child,"" he says.

At the Draper residence, Betty makes a list of things to bring to her familys home for Thanksgiving. Don, squinting to read a magazine, explains that he cant join her because of his workload as a new partner. ""I don't understand why you can't make my family your family,"" Betty says, aware of Don's real reasons for backing out.

Meanwhile that night, Harry sits in his office and pleads to his wife to let him come home. She rejects the idea, and he settles in for the night.

The next day, Betty comes home from picking up acorn squash to find Francine at the door, distraught. She tells Betty that she was paying the phone bill -- something Carlton normally does -- when she noticed long-distance calls to Manhattan. She called a number, and a woman answered. That, and the fact that he sleeps at the Waldorf two nights a week, makes her believe he's having an affair. Betty tries to comfort her, but Francine says she wishes she could just poison him and then leaves, embarrassed. Then, Betty walks straight into Don's study, grabs the sealed phone bill and slips it into her pocket.

Meanwhile, Duck Phillips holds his first meeting with the ad men at Sterling Cooper. He's disappointed with their current clientele. ""No automobile, airline, pharmaceuticals,"" he says. ""People want cars, they want to fly."" He passes out a list of people they should be wining and dining and mentions that Kodak -- and their new slide projector -- is on the market.

Back at the Drapers, Don arrives home and Betty tells him about Francine's situation. ""How could someone do that to the person they love?"" she says, watching him. He encourages her not to worry.

At the office, Duck puts the carousel slide projector on Don's desk and explains that the delightfully mechanical gadget doesn't jam and is continuous like a wheel. ""Kodak reinvented The Wheel"" Don says, joking.

Over in the engineers booth, Ken and Peggy watch as three women audition their vocal talents for the 'Relax-a-Cizor' on the other side of the glass. Peggy opts to go with Annie, despite Kens partiality to Rita. As Annie stands in front of a music stand and reads the copy into the microphone, Peggy isn't satisfied. She interrupts several times to get Annie to speak with more confidence and beauty. But when Annie doesn't understand Peggys suggestions, she gets choked up.

""This is not working out,"" Peggy says. ""We're going to have to let you go."" As Annie cries, Peggy tells Ken to console her and then have Rita come in for the job.

Don sits in his office, looking at a slide from a box labeled Cape May. He takes another out, holds it up to the lamp, laughs and swaps it for another. Then, he takes the photo of him and Adam riding horses from the shoebox. Unlike the slides, he stares at this one for a long time before he picks up the phone to call Brighton Hotel. He asks for any information on Adam, a former tenant.

""Jesus, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but he hung himself,"" says the night manager. ""He left the building a bunch of money. The city took it.""

That night, Betty eyes the phone bill, noticing eight calls to Manhattan. She picks up the phone and dials the number slowly. After a few rings, a mans voice picks up. ""Who is this?"" Betty asks. It's Dr. Arnold Wayne, her psychiatrist, who doesn't recognise her voice . She hangs up, shocked and ashamed.

The next day, Betty pulls up to a bank, and on her way in, she sees Glen, Helen Bishop's son, in the passenger seat of a green Volkswagen. She walks over.

""I'm not supposed to talk to you,"" Glen says, shyly. She says she doesn't care. ""I can't talk to anyone -- Im so sad,"" she says. ""Please tell me I'll be okay."" He reaches his hand up to her and tells her that he wishes he were older.

That afternoon, Pete tells Don how he took Ducks talk seriously. He brought in a pharmaceutical account from his father-in-laws company, Vicks Chemical, called Clearasil. Don admits that he's impressed. Pete's connection -- and subsequent investment in Sterling Cooper -- got him a bonus from Cooper, along with the Ayn Rand book.

At Dr. Wayne's office, Betty talks about how nerve-wracking it is to get the family together for Thanksgiving. ""Being able to talk, just me and you, has helped,"" she says. ""Still, I can't help but think that I'd be happy if my husband was faithful to me."" As she sneaks a peek back at him, Betty says she feels sorry for Don but should be angry. ""The way he makes love -- sometimes it's what I want, sometimes it's obviously what someone else wants,"" she continues, inhaling her cigarette.

Back at Sterling Cooper, Don hosts a meeting with the Kodak clients. He turns on the projector and flips through slides of him with his newborn baby or the family on Christmas morning. ""This is not a spaceship, it's a time machine,"" he says. ""It goes backwards and forwards, and it takes us to a place where we ache to go again.""

""It's not called The Wheel,"" he continues. ""It's called The Carousel. It let's us travel around and around and back home again."" He concludes with an image of him and Betty kissing on New Years. Overwhelmed with emotion, Harry starts crying and leaves the room. The Kodak clients, equally impressed, cancel their meetings with other agencies.

While they celebrate this victory, Don tells Pete that because young girls buy the blemish-busting Clearasil, Peggy would be the perfect writer for the account.

""Peggy is not even a copywriter,"" he protests. ""She's a secretary."" With that, Don calls Peggy into his office and immediately makes her a junior copywriter with Clearasil as her first task. Pete storms out of the room.

As Joan puts Peggy into a shared office with writer Victor Manny, she encourages Peggy to recognize where she came from or her new job might become doubly difficult. Just then, Peggy grimaces, trying to hide a sidesplitting pain. When her stomachache persists, she goes to the doctor.

""Honey, you didn't mention that you were expecting,"" Dr. Oliver says to Peggy. She replies that that's impossible, and is about to leave when she doubles over in pain. The doctor and nurse quickly realize that she is in labor. That night, a nurse brings a swaddled baby boy to Peggy and encourages her to feed him. She just turns her head away.

As he rides the train back to Ossining Don imagines arriving home as Betty and the kids have finished packing for their trip. ""I'm coming with you,"" Don says. Betty, emotional, watches as he picks up the kids, kissing their heads. When he really does arrive home he arrives to find the house empty. He sits on the steps and holds his head in his hands."

Tim (Scott Bryce) is a 42-year-old banker, making $2 million a year. They meet at a NYC art gallery. They start dating and on romantic outings for 2 weeks. They have dinners and sex. Tim takes her to an apartment listing and invites her to visit his parents. But then at the last-minute Tim's mother is sick and Tim calls in to cancel. He doesn't call for 2 weeks. She calls back, and he promises to call the next day. He never calls again.

Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) explores such issues in her blog, like why are there many great unmarried women, but no great unmarried men. In the mid-20's the women call the shots in all relationships, but by the mid-30's the power equation flips, and the men carry all the cards.

At a birthday party for thirty-something Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her friends Samantha (Kim Cattrall) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) vow to stop worrying about finding the ""perfect"" male and start having sex ""like men"" (without emotions).

Most men are threatened by successful women. The women have to keep their mouth shut and learn to play by the rules. Men believe that women reject perfectly great guys for being too short, too fat or too poor. The men think women don't want to settle, but the women think all men are self centered and unappreciative of women.

Miranda is a corporate lawyer. Charlotte is an art dealer. Samantha is a public relations executive who routinely sleeps with guys in their 20's. Samantha says that for the first time women have as much money and power as the men, and encourages women to have ""sex like a man"", without emotions. Miranda says that if a guy finds out that you are only looking for sex, they get performance anxiety. Carrie says all this goes away when the right guy comes along. Samantha thinks the right guy is an illusion.

Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson) is a gay owner of a talent agency & Carrie's good friend. He is dating Derek (Andrea Boccaletti), who is also his client. Carrie has several encounters with tycoon heartthrob Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Samantha tells her that Big is the next Donald Trump and he only dates models.

Carrie slept with Kurt Harrington (Bill Sage) when she was 26, 29 and 31, and considers him a mistake. As research, Carrie sleeps with Kurt just for sex or ""Just has sex like a man"". Carrie expected Kurt to be hurt, but he calls again and says finally Carrie understands the type of relationship he wants. Sex without commitment. The next time Carrie is looking for sex, she can just call him.

Miranda starts dating nice-guy Skipper Johnston (Ben Weber), after Carrie sets them up. Johnston is the caring, sensitive types. But Miranda thinks of Johnston behavior as off-putting. Charlotte goes on a date with Capote Duncan (Jeffrey Nordling), but when she tells him she won't have sex with him, he goes to a club, and he shares a cab with Charlotte.

At the club, Samantha is hitting on Mr Big, he keeps rejecting her. Johnston is smitten with Miranda, and she ends up kissing him. Capote Duncan ends up going home with Samantha. Mr Big gives a ride home to Carrie when she can't find a cab."

Turns out Nick would bring models to dinner with his friends (and their wives). So, the wives gave him an ultimatum to bring a girl who could carry on a decent conversation. They ban Nick from bringing any more models, as they find it too depressing. Miranda confronts Nick, so admits that he is obsessed with models. Miranda is perplexed, what chance do ordinary woman have, if average men like Nick like dating models. Nick is a Modelizer, who idolizes women. NYC is full of models. Womanizers will sleep with anybody in a skirt. Modelizers are a step beyond Womanizers and are obsessed with models. In NYC, the models roam the streets. At dinner, the 4 gals discuss how men hold women to impossible standards of beauty that normal women simply can't achieve. But men believe that those standards are possible. Samantha believes that she looks like a model, but she took the high road and decided to have a career.

Beautiful women believe that beauty is power. They can get anything they want. Models know that men think they are dumb, while many of them read and are very intelligent. Men know that dating models make them look shallow, but they know that they are sleeping with a model.

Skipper meets Carrie and says he likes Miranda, but she won't return his calls. After Miranda and Skipper bump into each other at the convenience store (he calls her ""luminous""), they sleep together for the first time.

Carrie interviews Barkley (Gabriel Macht), a Modelizer who videotapes his conquests. Barkley is a painter, who has never sold a single painting, yet leads a fabulous lifestyle. He says models have sex like regular people, when regular people are on vacations. He says the trick is to treat them like regular girls. Derek, a male model client of Stanford Blatch, performs at a fashion show. Carrie was there so that she could meet a few Modelizers. Derek is Stanford's client, but Stanford is also secretly in love with Derek. Derek denies that he is gay, but Stanford has hope. Samantha and Barkley are also at the fashion show. Mr Big is also at the after party.

Derek leaves the after party early as he can't take the crowds, after the fashion show. Derek spends the night with Carrie. Although Carrie and Derek don't sleep together as Derek says he doesn't date models as they are too stupid. He is a simple guy with simple dreams and says NYC is too lonely for him. He just wants to lie with Carrie for company.

Samantha chases Barkley while at the same fashion show as Carrie, after she learns from Carrie that Barkley tapes his conquests. But Samantha is disappointed when Barkley says during sex that he only tapes models. Samantha says that she wants to be taped and Barkley agrees.

Carrie meets Mr Big at the show. Big is a Modelizer. Big says that some men just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women. He is dating a model from the show. Mr Big bumps into Carrie at a cafe and says that there are many gorgeous women in the city, but he wants to be with the one who makes him laugh."

Peter claims he was on the way to the bathroom. Patience sends Carrie back to NYC.

Miranda says once someone gets married, all bets are off. All single women are suddenly the enemy. Samantha says it's because married women know single women can sleep anywhere, anytime with anyone. Married women look at single women as loser, lepers and prostitutes. Charlotte, on the other hand, treated marriage like a sorority that she was desperate to pledge.

Carrie sets Sean up with Charlotte, whom she knows shares Sean's desperation for marriage. But Charlotte also breaks off with Sean as they had very different tastes. He was American Classic, she was French country.

They were rivals. Then 2 years ago she met an investment banker and got married.

Carrie is forced to think about motherhood by her late period. Miranda regards the other guests as part of the cult of The Motherhood. Miranda says that mothers think the same, dress the same and sacrifice themselves to the same cause of babies.

Flint accuses Billy of not trusting him anymore. Billy wonders about how Flint has lied to the crew, but Flint plays it off as something that a good captain needs to do to maintain morale. Billy asks about Mrs Barlow, but Flint claims that she is just a Puritan woman who he has taken as a lover.

Jack Rackham, Vane, and Anne Bonny, arrive at Noonan's brothel and inform the madame that they are the new owners.

Eleanor wonders about why Scott would betray her and returns to her offices where she finds John Silver handcuffed to the injured Randal. Outside her office, her father informs a crowd that he is a wanted fugitive and tells them that Captain Bryson liquidated their holdings and that their business there will be ended.

Looking to gain another knot of speed, Flint orders the raising of the topgallants, an act which Mr Degroot feels jeopardizes the ship. Billy supports the Captain's order and they gain the needed speed.

Mr Guthrie tells Eleanor that their criminal business is ended and that he intends to throw his lot in with the landlords with whom he has been cultivating relationships. He asks Eleanor to swallow her pride and join them, but she refuses. Meanwhile, an angry crowd grows outside her offices, looking to get back whatever money they can. Captain Hornigold has his men protecting her offices and urges her to scrape together whatever money she can to settle her outstanding debts.

Billy Bones lays out to the crew their plan of attack. As they approach, Bryson will likely turn his ship to fire on them. Since they are outgunned they cannot trade fire with him and so will go straight at him. But to allow them to board they will have to get Bryson to turn his ship so that it runs alongside theirs. Billy informs them that Mr Beauclerque will ""convince"" Bryson to do so. Billy has also informed Dufresne, the ships accountant, that all hands will need to take part in the boarding, including him. To steady the man's nerves, Billy tells him that no one on the ship has ever died on their first time boarding.

Bryson turns his ship and opens fire. As he does so, Mr Beauclerque, perched in the crow's nest with a rifle, shoots the man at the Andromache's wheel. When another replaces him, Beauclerque shoots him. Eventually, the Andromache turns and the Walrus comes alongside her.

The pirates leap across the gap between the two ships and begin to board. Terrified, Dufresne goes as well. One of the Andormache's defenders points a pistol at him and pulls the trigger, but it misfires. The two men wrestle and Dufresne ends up biting out the man's jugular before passing out. He is found, covered in blood, by Billy Bones.

Back at Nassau, Eleanor has called together a meeting of several captains. She proposes to start a new trading consortium using her contacts and their ships to move trade. She argues that the captains there, who own large ships but are poor pirates, will earn more money as traders. Eleanor asks Hornigold to bless their operation in order to get people to sell to them. Hornigold says that he will only do so if she agrees to lift her ban on Vane. Eleanor angrily refuses.

Aboard the Andromache, the Walrus' crew begins searching the ship. Bryson and many of his men are barricaded below decks. They shoot several of the Walrus crew who approach their hiding place. Flint is informed that Bryson has cut the link between the steering wheel and the rudder. Bryson decides to deliver his terms. He goes below decks to where a number of slaves are chained in the hold. Among them is Mr Scott. Bryson says that Guthrie ordered him to get rid of Scott. They kill a couple of slaves until one of them agrees to act as a messenger.

Back at Nassau, John Silver advises Eleanor to give up the ban on Vane. He says that it's not worth giving up everything she's built to punish Vane.

Gates lays out the situation to Flint: Bryson's men are barricaded in a section of the ship with walls and ceiling as thick as the outer hull. It's also right next to a powder magazine and so they cannot blow their way in without risking the whole ship.

Dufresne is going through Bryson's papers. He tells Billy that he has remembered a crew member who died on his first boarding. Billy names a half dozen others as well, indicating that he had lied to buck up Dufresne's spirits. Dufresne thanks him. Billy then notices a letter on Bryson's desk addressed to Miranda Barlow and pockets it.

The slave messenger emerges from the hold. Communicating through an African member of the Walrus' crew, he relays a message from Bryson. The message says that before Bryson left he sent a message to the Captain of the ship Scarborough, telling him where to find them. A sail is spotted on the horizon. Just then, the slave lights a grenade and rushes toward Flint. Billy shoots him dead and the man's dead body muffles the grenade blast."

Medical officer; Counsellor (Lt. Cmdr.) Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), Psychic; Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner), Android; Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton);

Capt. Jean-Luc Picard takes command of the new Galaxy-class star ship, the fifth USS Enterprise. They are on route to Farpoint Station on Planet Deneb IV. Beyond Deneb IV is the great unexplored mass of the Galaxy. Picard is short his First Officer, who is scheduled to join him at Farpoint. The station was built by the natives of the planet who have now invited the Federation to inspect it and to use its facilities. Picard is supposed to negotiate the use of the station for the Federation, while trying to find out why the natives built it. They are stopped by Q (John De Lancie), a powerful member of a collective who refuses to let them continue and in fact puts them on trial for all of man's past transgressions. Q appears on the bridge of Enterprise and asks Picard to return to his own Solar System. Q calls humanity a dangerous, savage, child race. Just 400 years ago millions were slaughtered in world war II. Q vanishes after delivering his warning.

Picard decides to outrun the gauntlet laid down by Q, by reversing engines and running at full warp speed. But Q follows and overtakes the Enterprise without much effort. Picard orders emergency detachment of the saucer. He transfers all non-combatants into the saucer and Worf is to captain it. Picard transfers to the battle bridge in the star drive to confront Q. Picard then orders a dead stop and surrenders the star drive to Q.

Q transports the crew of the star drive to an ancient Earth court modeled after the horrors of the atomic wars on Earth. Q acts as Judge, Jury, and Prosecutor. He is adamant that humans have been savage in the past, murdering millions, and hence Picard has to answer as guilty and seek punishment for it. Picard pleads for Q to judge them based on how they act today, not in history.

Q decides to accept the challenge and tells them the way they deal with the Farpoint issue will determine their fate. Picard, Data, Tasha and Troi are returned to the bridge of the Star Drive and allowed to proceed to Farpoint.

Farpoint was built very quickly and seems to meet all the Federation's needs. There is even consideration of having them build other such stations. Riker is assigned as the First Officer of the Enterprise and is supposed to join the ship at the Farpoint station. Riker understands that the planet inhabitants use geothermal energy for their energy surpluses. This allows them to use very advanced materials for the construction of the space station. Riker and Dr Crusher & her son Wesley meet on the planet. Forge is also there, waiting to join the Enterprise crew. Riker shares his suspicions that the planet has an uncanny ability to produce exactly what you were wishing/hoping for at that moment. The administrator of the station, Groppler Zorn is shown to issue a warning to an unknown entity to stop displaying its acts of ""magic"" in front of visitors.

Riker beams to the Enterprise when the Star Drive arrives. Data informs Picard that the saucer section will arrive in 51 mins. Picard tests Riker by ordering him to perform a manual docking with the saucer section. It is executed flawlessly. Picard welcomes Riker to the Enterprise.

Geordi has damaged optic nerves and uses an instrument that converts visual images into brain waves to be fed directly to his brain. Data has been assigned the duty to transfer Admiral McCoy (DeForest Kelley) to USS Hood by shuttle craft, as he hates the transporter. Deanna and Riker have romantic feelings for each other. Dr Crusher's husband was killed serving with Picard. Picard is not sure if Dr Crusher wanted this assignment, and she staunchly declares that she requested this assignment aboard the Enterprise.

Riker tells Picard that the planet gets surplus geothermal energy, which allowed them to create a star base to federation standards. Many materials used in the construction are not found on the planet at all. As they soon learn, it is all too good to be true and the station's chief Zorn (Michael Bell) is hiding something. Zorn is evasive about lending his engineers and architects to Starfleet and threatens to ally with the Ferengi instead, if Starfleet does not like the base built for them, as per their standards. Deanna senses pain and loneliness in a form near Zorn.

Riker assembles an away team to inspect the star base closely. He avoids being too close to Deanna though. Deanna has sensed some passages underneath the star base and Riker assigns Deanna, Yar and Geordi to investigate. Riker and Data investigate topside. Deanna again senses extreme pain in the tunnels right beneath the star base. Riker and Data beam to their location. This is when an unknown star ship enters orbit around the planet Deneb IV. The ship is 12 times bigger than the Enterprise. Picard checks with Zorn, who says that the alliance with Ferengi was only a thought and an empty threat. The ship starts firing at the old Bandi city, leaving the Star base untouched.

Picard orders Riker to enter the city, abduct Zorn and beam him to the Enterprise. Picard then orders Yar to lock Phasers onto the unidentified ship. At this point Q appears, it becomes clear that Picard and his crew are not dealing with the situation as he had expected or perhaps hoped. Q again charges humans of savagery and for showing no regard to save the lives of the Bandi city folk. Before Riker can abduct Zorn, he disappears in front of their eyes. Riker and Data beam back to the Enterprise, where Riker yells at Q and forces him to back off.

Yar, Riker, Deanna and Data beam over to the unidentified vessel. They find similar tunnels as they found beneath the Star base. Deanna senses anger and hate, towards the old Bandi city. They find Zorn being tortured by an alien energy based being, who dissipates with phaser fire.

That's when Q arrives on Enterprise and stops Picard from beaming his team back. Picard says he will do anything and begs for his team back, which Q does. But Deanna and Riker report that it wasn't Q, but the alien being who beamed them back. Zorn wants Picard to fire on the ship, but Picard wont.

Turns out Zorn had found an injured alien being and helped it recover and learned that it could transport energy into any matter. But Zorn grew greedy and enslaved it underneath the new star base. That was the pain. This drew its mate, the alien spaceship, who fired on the Bandi city and was full of anger. The Alien ship converts into a type of space jelly fish. Picard fires on the Star base to release the alien mate. The pair unites and goes away. Q is satisfied and leaves Humans alone, for now."

Enterprise is assigned to investigate due to a series of weird messages from the vessel that indicate something has gone wrong on board. As they near the ship however, they receive odd communications from the vessel, almost as if they are all drunk. When one of the crew blows an emergency escape outer hatch, the entire crew is killed. Data says that this is impossible under normal circumstances.

An away team investigates but acquire a virus-like disease. There are indications of a wild party throughout the ship. Tasha finds 10 people frozen in the Engineering section, with evidence that they were playing with the environmental controls. There were 80 people on the ship, and none are alive. Geordi came into physical contact with some dead crewmen on board the spaceship and brings the virus over to the Enterprise. The virus makes them appear drunk and removes all inhibitions.

Geordi is confined to sick bay as Dr Crusher finds elevated temp on him. But he escapes and infects Wesley and then Yar. Wesley is working on a tractor beam as his science project under Geordi. Wesley is thoroughly familiar with the entire ship, but yearns to be on the bridge, which is not yet allowed by Picard. Yar brings Geordi to sickbay where Deanna senses intoxication in Geordi. Meanwhile Dr Crusher still can't find anything wrong with Geordi, apart from his temperature. As it spreads throughout the ship, Picard and Riker try to maintain discipline while Dr. Crusher tries to find a cure. Yar also gets intoxicated and comes to Deanna's cabin to seek her advise on which clothes to wear.

Riker recalls a similar situation in the history of ships named Enterprise. He remembers reading somewhere that a crew person was found taking a shower in full uniform. That gives Dr Crusher a head start but not before an infected Wesley Crusher disables the engines. He has erected a Repulsor beam to block entry to the engine room. He only lets the assistant Chief Engineer inside who has pulled out all the computer chips controlling the engines due to which all the engines are offline. Just then the sun explodes leaving the ship in destruction's path.

Dr Crusher develops the vaccines as per Dr McCoy's notes and starts administering them. But the formula doesn't work as the virus is somehow different. Picard summons Yar, and soon finds that she is infected. Picard sends Data to escort Yar to sick bay. Yar has sex with Data and infects him. Deanna gets infected from Geordi and presses herself on Riker to infect him. Riker touches Dr Crusher and infects her. Dr Crusher wants to do ""things"" to Picard and infects him.

Picard asks Wesley to release control of the ship back to bridge, but Wesley refuses. The red giant starts to collapse. Riker tries to short the power to Wesley's Repulsor beam. The collapsing star's debris will engulf the Enterprise in 14 mins. But the Chief Engineer working with Riker gets Wesley's Repulsor beam switched off and is able access the engine bay. The Chief Engineer cannot replace the chips back within 14 minutes. Wesley suggests Data can put back the computer chips back into position in no time.

Beverly finishes a new vaccine in time and tests it on Geordi and it works. Data starts putting the chips back but needs 1 more minute than what they have. Wesley suggests reversing polarity on the tractor beams to make them into Repulsor beams, to repulse the star debris coming towards the Enterprise, and give Data that extra minute. The ploy works and Data gets the extra time he needs. Beverly inoculates the entire ship."

The planet's leader, Lutan (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson), is more than pleased to provide them with the cure but while on board takes a particular interest in the ship's security officer, Lt. Tasha Yar. He is attracted to her physically and is intrigued at her obvious fighting skills and intelligence. Lutan hands over a vaccine sample to Picard and in exchange Picard invites Lutan for an entertainment program on board the Enterprise. Lutan promises that if Picard respects Ligon's customs, the antidote would be made available to everybody in the Federation. Lutan asks Picard to let Tasha demonstrate the Holo-Deck to him. Lutan kidnaps Tasha just before his formal farewell and beams down together with her.

The Ligon culture respects patience, and so on Deanna's advise, Picard decides to wait for Lutan's response. 24 hours pass without any response from Lutan. Dr Crusher convinces Picard to allow Wesley to come to the bridge of the Enterprise.

Lutan contacts Picard. Deanna and Riker advise Picard that as per the Ligon code of honor he is supposed to return her when Picard asks for Tasha back. Lutan invites Picard to the planet's surface. Picard and Deanna beam down together. Lutan invites Picard and his landing party for the ceremony to hand Yar back. Lutan wants Picard to asks for Tasha's return in the ceremony to maintain Lutan's honor. But later, Lutan refuses to do so wanting to make her his first wife and announces the same publicly during the ceremony.

His current first wife Yareena (Karole Selmon) challenges Tasha to a fight to the death to retain her position. If Yar refuses the challenge then Lutan says that the Enterprise will have no vaccine and no treaty with Ligon. The plague on Cyrus IV is out of control and estimated deaths are in the millions.

Picard has a drink with Lutan and figures he is penniless and needs more land from Yareena. His proposal to Yar was a gambit to evoke a challenge from Yareena, as if she dies, he gets both Yar and the lands that Yareena owns. But the plague on Cyrus is getting worse and Beverly can't create the vaccine from the samples she has. Picard needs the vaccine from Lutan.

He agrees to the challenge. Yar meets Yareena and says she accepted the challenge as Picard wants the vaccine. She does not love Lutan. But Yareena is adamant. Meanwhile Data and Geordi figure out that Ligon weapons have poisons on their spikes.

The challenge begins. Yar quickly overcomes Yareena, but before she dies, they are both transported to the Enterprise, where Beverly saves Yareena from the poison before she dies. Lutan doesn't know that Yareena has been saved, and does not object when Picard says that Yar will not accept the honor of becoming Lutan's wife. He thinks he already has the lands from Yareena. Lutan transfers the vaccines to the Enterprise.

Later, Lutan is shocked to see Yareena alive and Yareena divorces Lutan on the spot. Now Lutan has no lands, no wife and no Tasha Yar. Lutan has lost everything.

Meanwhile, Data continues to try and understand humor but the nuances continue to escape him."

They have stolen a T9 energy converter from a federation star base. This is the Federations long awaited opportunity to make contact with the Ferengi. The Federation till knows very little about the Ferengi civilization. The Enterprise intercept the star ship while it passes through an uncharted solar system. It seems that the Ferengi ship has suddenly lost power due to an engine malfunction. The Ferengi fires on the Enterprise. The Ferengi have an impressive design but are matched technologically with the Federation. But suddenly, the Enterprise also loses power, shields, and weapons.

Ferengi are known to be traders and frauds. Picard uses the last stores of energy to break away from the Ferengi, but the Ferengi have the Enterprise in a strong force field and the Enterprise is not able to dislodge the hold. Deanna points out that while Picard has focused on the Ferengi, they have forgotten about the planet below. Suddenly the Enterprise's data banks are accessed, and all data downloaded at very high speeds. Picard asks Data for a full report on the planet. Faced with no other options that surrendering the ship, Picard asks for terms from the Ferengi.

Diamon Tarr (Mike Gomez) of the Ferengi responds and says that Ferengi would die before surrendering the ship to the Enterprise. Picard is stumped since he did not ask for a Ferengi surrender. Diamon offers to return the T9 device and sacrifice the life of their 2nd officer, as per their code. Picard realizes that the Ferengi ship is in the same condition as the Enterprise. Some external entity is responsible for this.

Data reveals that the dead planet was an outpost of the Tkon galactic empire (with a population of trillions), which has been extinct for 600K yrs. The empire was technology very advanced and capable of moving entire stars. Their sun went supernova and destroyed the empire. The outpost was a distant one, and survived the destruction of the empire. A probe reveals that both ships are being drained of energy by the planet.

The Ferengi have also reached the same conclusion and have withdrawn their offer to surrender. Picard proposes a joint exploration of the planet with the Ferengi. Diamon does not trust humans but agrees that their joint survival is at stake and allows for the temporary alliance. All of Picard's officers advise that Diamon is hiding something.

Riker, Yar, Data, Worf and Geordi beam down, but they all get scattered due to the energy field around the planet. The Ferengi also beam down and stun Riker, Data and Geordi, who had managed to find each other. Worf and Yar arrive to rescue them, but phasers don't work as their energy is absorbed by crystalline outgrowths on the planet surface. Geordi deduces that the entire planet is a energy accumulator. A Holo-Portal appears and petitions the humans and Ferengi to join the Tkon empire. Data tells the portal the Tkon have been extinct for 600K years, but the portal considers this sacrilege. The Portal is reading from history records that are several generations older to when the empire went extinct. The Portal doesn't know that the Tkon empire is extinct. The Ferengi meanwhile sense an opportunity, and petition to join the Tkon in exchange for release of their ship and destruction of the Enterprise. Riker submits the humans for judgment to the Portal. He responds calmly to all accusations made by the Ferengi.

The portal was testing the 2 civilizations and finds that Riker is wise and calm. He releases the Enterprise and restores power to the ship. Riker convinces the portal of releasing the Ferengi ship as well. He argues that Ferengi are what the humans were several hundred years ago, and they may yet mature. Portal warns that Ferengi may destroy the humans, but Riker says their values ask them to accept this as a possibility. Portal is pleased and agrees. Portal assimilates back with the planet."

Kosinki achieves this by changing the intermix formula and the parameters of engine performance. Kosinski is a propulsion expert and have come aboard with his assistant (Eric Menyuk) to conduct experiments to boost the warp speeds of the Enterprise engines.

Fascinated, Wesley sits with his alien assistant (who is from the star system Tau Alpha C) and wins his confidence by suggesting improvements to performance parameters set by the assistant. The results surpass even Kosinski's wildest dreams, jumping the ship into a galaxy 2.7 million light years away. It will take 300 years to get home at max warp.

Deciding against immediate study, Picard orders Kosinski to get them back to their own galaxy. Only Wesley notices that his assistant, who 'fades' supernaturally, is the real key. Wesley senses that the assistant's equations means that space, time, matter, and thoughts are not separate as they appear to be. The assistant is impressed by Wesley's understanding of his work, but tells him to keep his thoughts to himself. Wesley tries to warn Riker abut Kosinki, but since everyone is on the edge, Riker ignores him.

The next jump brings them to where everyone's deepest hopes and fears come true. This time even Riker notices the assistant fading, sitting right next to Wesley. By the time the ship is brought back under control, the Enterprise has reached an uncharted and unknown location, a billion light years from the Milky way. Worf sees a pet from his home planet. Yar sees her cat. Picard finds himself stepping off the lift into a space void and so on. Yar finds herself facing the gangs of her colony, where she grew up. Picard has tea with his mother Yvette (Herta Ware).

The alien assistant is ailing (drained from the 2 ultra-warp journeys) and reveals his 'Traveller' identity. He explains that he has the ability to channel thought into a form of energy and power star ship engines to go wherever he thinks about. He has been using this ability to trade for transportation and allowed Kosinski to take credit for his work. But he made a mistake this time and they ended up far away from their own galaxy.

He also says that he is a time traveler and is from the future. His entire species has the ability to focus thought into a form of propulsion. Till date his species has not contacted humans, as they were not considered interesting. The Traveller admits that staying in this part of the Universe will result in chaos. This is a region where thoughts become reality and humans should not have been brought here until they had learned control, which would be much later in their evolutionary time line. The traveler promises to get the ship back to their galaxy, even though he is very ill and drained of energy. Before starting the Traveller has a private moment with Picard and tells him that Wesley is a boy genius and Picard should help his development.

On this attempt, the traveler vanishes while accelerating the Enterprise. They return to their galaxy, but the Traveller is gone. Wesley's astuteness is noted and fittingly rewarded with an academy cadet future, and a post of acting ensign on the Star ship Enterprise till that rank becomes permanent in the future with Wesley's graduation from Starfleet academy."

Traveling past a mysterious energy cloud, something curious boards the ship, jumping between machinery and crew members, as if seeking a suitable host and learning about the ship without revealing itself. It first enters Worf, via the ship's sensors. It gets into Beverly when she examines Worf. From Beverly it gets into helm control panel on the bridge. Many of the ship's systems malfunction and Mr Singh (from Engineering) thinks it's due to a circuit short. which is impossible since the impacted systems don't interact with each other at all. at first Picard and Riker think that someone from the Anticans or the Selay are sabotaging the ship's system to delay its arrival at the parliament. But Yar can't find anything by interrogating them.

The crew catches on slowly, as nobody seems seriously affected by the highly intelligent host entity (except Wesley's engineering mentor Singh (Kavi Raz), killed in a warp technology energy surge). Wesley had investigated the warp consoles and provided some leads to Singh that might explain the failing of the warp engines. Singh investigated them further and was killed by an energy surge. But the surge restores the ship's warp drives and Picard orders to get underway towards the Parliament.

Deanna tries to hypnotize Beverly and Worf to see why they have blackouts for certain periods of their memory (during which they were in control of the alien entity). Both report the presence of someone else that took control of their minds. Suddenly the Enterprise loses all helm control. Wesley is convinced that the warp computers didn't get repaired, they just ""became"" alright. From helm the entity gets into Picard. Picard now orders to return to the energy cloud where they started from. Everyone on the bridge is puzzled.

Deanne senses that Picard has suddenly become dangerous and confides in Riker, Beverly, Data and Geordi. When Beverly and Riker confront Picard, he orders them to sickbay for mental evaluation. But later Picard admits to Beverly that there is an entity in there with him, in his body and that entity is in command.

As the Enterprise reaches the energy cloud, Picard announces (with the entity in command), that when the ship passed it, it took on board a sentient being, which was yanked away from its natural world. The being was frantic and moved from person to person till it found the helm controls to stop the ship that was carrying it away from its home. Now, by combining with Picard, the entity is home Deanna senses that the entity plans to transport Picard into the cloud, but not as matter, only as energy. When Riker tries to stop him, Picard (with entity in charge) attacks the entire bridge and flees towards the transporter room, and beams into the energy cloud.

After an hour, Deanna senses Picard and says that he is alone in the cloud, since the combination with the entity was not possible out there. Riker takes the ship closer to the cloud. Picard enters the ship via its sensors and is in its circuitry. Since Picard was the last person to beam out, his molecular pattern is in the transporter. Data energizes and Picard (whose energy was in the Transporter circuits), beams into existence once again."

Half in jest, Picard says its Eden-like playground seems too good to be true. Data reports something on the forward bow of the spaceship, but visual inspection reveals nothing. They log it to a faulty sensor.

The people of Edo are super friendly, very fit and healthy, greet everyone with a warm hug, dress skimpily and make love at the drop of a hat. The landing party is greeted by Rivan (Brenda Bakke) and Liator (Jay Louden). Wesley joins the kids, while the adults are invited to the council chamber to discuss rules for the shore leave for the crew. Wesley was part of the landing party to evaluate the planet as a suitable destination for all kids on board the Enterprise.

Meanwhile Data confirms there is no sensor error and demands the hidden entity to reveal itself, which it does, and it is a highly advanced spaceship. The spaceship sends a ""probe"" which enters the bridge. Senior officers struggle with an entity defying every known law of nature, which faces and tests them. It asks Picard to state the purpose of their visit to the planet. Picard says that the Enterprise is on a friendly visit and will leave after making contact. The entity is not convinced since the Enterprise left humans at the last planet they visited. Picard tries to explain the concept of colonization to the entity. The probe then attaches itself to Data for information exchange.

Alas, it is, for while teaching native adolescents' football, Wesley unwittingly commits a minor transgression. He breaks a flower nursery while catching a ball. This was in a zone, which is randomly selected each day, where all errors incur but one punishment: death by painless injection. The alien ship turns out to be Edo's 'god', & is fiercely protective of its 'children', absorbing all Federation knowledge from their database and intending to hold them to their laws.

Picard beams down and learns that Wesley is safe till sundown. Rivan and Liator understand that humans no longer have capital punishment, but they once used to. Liator suggests that Picard uses force to rescue Wesley from the planet, but Picard quotes the Prime Directive. Rivan identifies the spaceship orbiting the planet as their God, who protects the beings on the planet. The God is benevolent, but can makes its presence felt, when needed. He requests Rivan to come to his ship and identify the Alien ship for him. She identifies it as her God. The God gets angry and attacks the Enterprise and Picard is forced to return Rivan to the planet.

Picard then goes to meet Data, who has now regained consciousness, after its encounter with the alien probe. Data tells Picard that the God is currently observing the humans. It knows everything about humans and their way of life and violating the Prime Directive to save Wesley might arouse its fatal wrath. As the God will deem humans deceitful and untrustworthy. Data also offers that the alien life form is only now evolved to a state multi-dimensional existence. Once upon a time in the past, the alien life form was also flesh and blood like humans. Picard hopes that they also shared the same values as the humans. Data believes that the child race on Edo might have been planted by the alien life form, just as humans plant colonies all over the galaxy.

Picard is in a dilemma, meanwhile Beverly has found out that Wesley is on standby for execution and wants Picard to promise to save him. Picard does and takes Beverly down to the planet with him, where it is nearly sundown.

Picard conveys his dilemma to Liator and states that he is prepared to sacrifice his crew and his ship to save Wesley. Picard argues that justice cannot be served if laws are absolute. Life is itself an exception. Edo God allows humans to leave."

They meet as scheduled but the Ferengi simply ignore them for some time. Finally, the Ferengi Commander DaiMon Bok (Frank Corsentino) (& his 1st officer Kazago (Douglas Warhit) & 2nd officer Rata (Robert Towers)) reveal the purpose of their trip - to return to the Federation the USS Stargazer, a ship that Picard once commanded and for which he is credited with a particularly important maneuver. An alien vessel had damaged Stargazer's shield. As it moved in for a kill, Picard executed a high warp speed and stopped right in front of the vessel and fired all phasers and torpedoes, destroying it. This tactic is now taught in battle tactics at the Academy.

9 years ago, Picard had encountered an unidentified vessel in the Maxia star system and destroyed it, that vessel is now revealed to be a Ferengi by DaiMon. Picard's record shows that the vessel attacked the Stargazer and Picard was forced to defend. Picard is pleased to see his old ship but has been suffering from headaches lately. He gets quite caught up in the history of that day on his ship and refers to it as if it was happening right now.

With Dr. Crusher concerned, the captain just goes on as usual. Picard's condition worsens when he goes aboard the Stargazer. Hidden in his old cabin is a device which is causing his headaches. It is revealed that this device is controlled by a member of the Ferengi crew is out to avenge the death of his son in the battle for which Picard gained such recognition.

Data looks at the logs from the Stargazer, which reveals that the ship that Picard fired on was under a flag of truce and Picard fired on it without notice or provocation. The fire on the ship was due an accident in engineering and not due to any Ferengi attack. Riker thinks that the log was forged by the Ferengi, but he still reveals it to Picard and says that as per regulations, he needs to report this to Starfleet.

Riker contacts Kazago and asks if DaiMon knows about the logs on Stargazer, and if they could be forged. Kazago feels insulted and shuts out Riker. That night Picard sleeps and relives the entire incident in his mind, as it is taught in the academy. But the whole scenario is planted and controlled by the Ferengi operator. Data determines the logs retrieved from the Stargazer to be forgeries.

Picard orders Riker to release the Stargazer from the Enterprise tractor beams. Wesley tells Beverly that Picard's brain scans show the same waves that are being emitted on a low frequency band from the Ferengi ship. Beverly and Deanna report to Riker and says that something is impacting Picard's thought patterns. They figure out that the waves were amplified by a device in Picard's cabin, which came with his personal belongings transferred from the Stargazer.

Riker learns that Picard has transported over to the stargazer and has powered the ship. The Ferengi on the stargazer plants his device on the bridge and reveals to Picard how his son was captain of the ship Picard destroyed. Under the influence of the device, Picard orders the computers of Stargazer to execute the same maneuver, but against the Enterprise. Riker again hails Kazago and shows him the amplifier. Kazago reveals the mystery Ferengi to be his own captain DaiMon Bok and Kazago arrests Bok.

Riker holds the Stargazer in a tractor beam, so it can't execute the Picard Manoeuvre and appeals to Picard to destroy the mind control device, which he does. Picard is free from Bok's influence and is beamed back to the Enterprise."

Enterprise is tasked with providing emergency medical assistance.

The indefatigable Q (John De Lancie) appears again, still not convinced that humans are a race worth saving and wanting to test them yet again. This time he focuses on Commander Riker and sets out to prove that mankind will not do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself. He transports everyone, except Picard, from the bridge of the Enterprise to a class M planet. Picard is trapped on the bridge, alone, and cannot speak to anyone in or out of the ship.

Q and the bridge crew led by Riker, are in a Napoleonic setting. Q decrees that the game will be completely unfair. When Yar objects, he places her in a penalty box. If anyone else violates the rules of the game, they will go to the penalty box and Yar would go into nothingness. Q and Yar appear on the Enterprise bridge. Q reveals to Picard that he is testing Riker this time. The wager is Picard's command against Q keeping away from Humanity's affairs forever.

To prove his point, Q vests in Riker all his powers convinced that the old adage about absolute power corrupting absolutely will prove to be true. Riker and his crew find a group of French soldiers in the hills on the Planet, forming skirmishing lines and heading towards the Enterprise crew. Their phasers still work. Worf reports that while the uniforms maybe French, but the beings inside them are not human, but alien animal type, and vicious. Riker's crew comes under attack from the alien beings and Riker saves them by beaming them back to the Enterprise.

Riker remains on the planet though. Q meets Riker and offers him to join the Q community. Q says that the human thirst for knowledge and advancement will surpass the Q at some point, and the Q want to learn from it, and hence the offer to Riker to join them. Riker rejects the offer and Q transports everyone back to the planet, including Picard and Wesley, but no phasers. The alien beings in French Uniforms attack again. Worf and Wesley are killed, Riker is enraged and sends everyone back to the Enterprise, including himself.

The Enterprise reaches Sigma 3. They find a handful of survivors and a dead girl buried in the rubble. Picard forbids Riker from using his powers again to bring the dead girl back to life. Riker is starting to get arrogant and wants a meeting with Picard and his bridge crew. Riker argues that him saving a little girl is not any different to him saving the Enterprise crew. Arguments get heated, and Q appears to goad Riker on.

Riker offers to give gifts to his friends that he knows they would like, using his powers. He turns Wesley 10 years older, into a man. He turns Data into a human. He gives Geordi his eyesight. Worf, a Klingon female companion.

Riker is obviously tempted to play God but his assumptions about giving people the opportunity to be whatever they want doesn't go over quite well. Geordi says that the price is too high and says he wants to be the way he was. Worf rejects his companion as she is from a world now alien to him. Wesley wants to be a boy again, as it's too soon for this. Riker learns his lesson, Q is defeated. Picard knew that the experiment would fail and wins his wager with Q. Q is yanked away by his collective."

The planet is known for its mystical healing powers. Legends say that the planet can mend souls and broken hearts.

On arrival however there is a message for Counsellor Troi - her fiance and his parents are waiting for them and would like to proceed with the wedding. Troi is genuinely shocked - as is Riker - but the engagement is genuine having been arranged by the parents when Troi and her intended, Wyatt Miller (Robert Knepper), were just children.

Also waiting for her is her mother, Lwaxana Troi (Majel Barrett), a larger-than-life personality who dominates any room just by her presence. Lwaxana makes Picard carry her luggage. Deanna is depressed as the wedding means she has to leave Starfleet. Wyatt is a medical officer. Lwaxana says that the Millers tracked her down in Haven and forced her to honor their vows taken several decades ago. Deanna is sad, but promises to honor the customs and traditions of her civilization.

For Troi and Wyatt, there seems to be little time to get to know one another but there is another problem: she's not who he was expecting to see. Since early childhood, he has dreamed of a beautiful blond woman and just assumed it was Troi (he thought Deanna was projecting her own image into him, which Betazoids can do). When it turns out to be someone else, neither are sure what to do. Wyatt has made pictures of this mysterious woman. The Millers don't get along with Lwaxana. The Millers are from Earth and want a human wedding, while Lwaxana wants a Betazoid joining ceremony. The Betazoid joining ceremony require all guests, and the bride and groom to go naked.

Captain Picard soon has another situation to deal with however when a Tarellian vessel suddenly appears, obviously destined to Haven. The Tarellians have not taken permission from Haven to enter orbit, nor have they followed any of their security protocols. Picard identifies the ship as a Tarellian. The Tarellians were supposed to be extinct. They had a war on their planet which led to use of biological weapons. The entire planet was infected. Many Tarellians escaped, but perished on other worlds, whom they also infected. Other Tarellians were hunted down by the other civilizations in the galaxy. The Tarellians carry an incurable plague and the last of them were thought killed many years before. The Tarellian ship will reach Haven in 13 hours.

Wyatt offers to work with Beverly to find a cure for the Tarellian plague, as that is an interest area for him. Meanwhile Haven has asked for protection from the Tarellian ship that Enterprise is obliged to provide and Enterprise is also obliged to help the needy, in this case the Tarellians.

Riker is depressed over losing Deanna and she senses the same. Deanna admonishes her mother over her poor treatment of everyone. She relents and agrees to a half Betazoid and half human wedding. Deanna then tells Wyatt about Riker, and he is happy that she was honest. They kiss.

The Haven government wants Picard to destroy the Tarellian ship before if enters Haven and brings the plague to the planet. But Picard wants to use every second to try and make contact with the Tarellians, which has so far been unsuccessful. Picard holds the Tarellian ship in a tractor beam and disables their ability to transport anything to the surface of Haven.

When the Enterprise establishes visual contact with Tarellian ship, the pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place. The woman on the ship is the woman of Wyatt's dreams. There are 8 people on the ship, and they all carry the plague. They do seek sanctuary on Haven due to its mystical healing powers.

Wyatt decides to join his dream woman on the Tarellian ship. He takes some medical supplies with him. Once Wyatt beams over, The Tarellians say that they no longer wish to live on Haven as they have what they came for. They leave."

The Jarada (an insect like race) consider the slightest mispronunciation as an insult. Stressed and tired from his efforts, he decides to take Counsellor Troi's advice and spend some time on the Holodeck. The Holodeck has been recently upgraded and Deanna says Picard needs the diversion.

He chooses his favorite program, that where he plays a private detective named Dixon Hill in 1940's San Francisco. Accompanied by the ship's historian Whelan (David Selburg) (Picard takes Whalen as he knows more about Dixon Hill than Picard himself), Dr. Crusher and Data they live out the wonderful world created for them in the Holodeck. The Jarada rendezvous is still 11 hrs away and Picard hopes to exit well before then. The characters in the Holodeck are meta-generated, but they feel real and interact with the crew in real time and autonomously.

Picard is retained by a wealthy lady Mrs Arthur Bradley to figure out who is trying to kill her. She suspects Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney). Picard charges $20/day as his retainer plus expenses. Soon, Picard learns about Mrs. Bradley's death in the newspapers. Picard is arrested as a suspect as he was one of the last men she saw.

Just then, the Enterprise is scanned by the Jarada. The long-range scan causes a malfunction that traps Picard and his crew in the Holodeck. Picard is being held by a police inspector who suspects Picard of shooting Bradley and is interrogating him at the police station. The whole experience is very lifelike. Not only that, but the safety mechanisms malfunction as well leading to one of the participating crewmen being seriously injured. Felix Leech (Harvey Jason) one of the characters in the story (Felix says Hill was hired to locate a certain object and demands to know where it is), confronts Picard and ends up shooting Whelan, but the bullet turns out to be real.

Picard knows they are in trouble when the computer does not answer him or provide him any exits from the Holodeck. Felix brings Cyrus with him, who strikes Picard and draws blood. Cyrus looks for some unnamed object and would kill Beverly unless Picard produces it.

The Jarada are early and demand their honor speech from Picard. With the clock ticking away, time is growing short for Picard to make his address to their hosts. Riker determines that Picard is stuck in the Holodeck and there is no way to communicate with him. Wesley and Geordi are tasked with studying the circuits and fixing the issue.

Wesley manages to find the bug and fixes the issue to open the exit door. Cyrus won't allow Picard to leave and threatens to shoot him down. Cyrus and Leech move through the exit into the real world, and they vanish as they are not real. Whelan is taken to sick bay.

The entire population of the planet died of unknown reasons many years previously with Data being found just around that time. The entire planet is now dead, with no vegetation or insects or even soil bacteria.

Although they find no one alive, they do find a huge underground complex and, surprisingly, a disassembled version of Data. They also find a lab belonging to Dr Noonien Soong, Earth's foremost robotic scientist, who was known to have been working on creation of a Positronic brain. But he was known to have failed in his quest. Inside the labs, they also find many drawings by kids, that show a glowing object in the sky frightening all the inhabitants of the planet below.

They re-build the disassembled version of Data and activate it. Data helps the Enterprise engineers by letting them see his own circuits and how he has been put together. He shows Beverly that he has an off switch but asks her to keep it a secret. The reassembled version introduces himself as Lor, an earlier and, he claims, a superior version of Data. He claims he was disassembled because he was so human-like that he frightened the local population. The local population asked Dr Soong to create a less perfect android and thus Data was made. He also claims that the Positronic brains inside Data and him are from Dr Noonien Soong and hence he was right after all. Lore also demonstrates how Data has limitations that were purposefully built in by Dr Soong to make him sound ""less"" human (he can't tell jokes, or say can't or isn't etc).

Lore tells Picard of a Crystalline entity, that feeds on the life force of all living beings. This was the entity that stuck Omicron Theta and kill everyone on the planet. In fact, he knows far more than he is letting on and has the ability to call upon a crystalline entity of great destructive power, the very power that destroyed the planet and killed all of its inhabitants. This is why Dr Soong had disassembled Lore in the first place. Lore was ambitious and wanted to cozy up to the entity by offering it life forms of the planet, and now Lore plans to conjure it on the Enterprise. All he has to do is find a way to impersonate Data. He knocks Data unconscious by mixing a sedative in his drink. He interchanges clothes and pretends to be Data. He tells Wesley that Lore attacked him when he found that he was being tracked. He then sends a signal to the entity inviting it to the Enterprise.

The entity duly arrives to meet the enterprise. Wesley suspects the current thing pretending to be Data to be actually Lore. He asks Picard to restrict Data's movements but is admonished. As the entity starts attacking, the Enterprise prepares to fire on it. Lore (as Data) asks Picard to speak to the entity and asks it back off, which it does. Then it requests permission to go to the transporter room and beam some living tissue next to the entity and then phaser it, to prove that Enterprise is dangerous. Picard sends a security team after him, but Lore (as Data) ""handles"" Worf. The plan is flawed since to transport the tissue, the Enterprise will have to lower Deflector shields for a split second, leaving it vulnerable to attack from the entity. Wesley goes to turn on Data with Beverly's help. Data stops Lore before he can turn off the deflector shields so that the entity can feed on the Enterprise. Data throws Lore into the transporter and Wesley beams him up, but doesn't materialize it back into matter. The entity moves away"

The vessel itself was floating in space but had 3 life pods missing. The crash took place several years before. It's taken many years for any Federation ship to receive the distress call and they're not sure what to expect. They do know that Angel One is a matriarchal society with technology same as mid-20th century Earth. Here women are the stronger and men adopt a more subservient role. Beata (Karen Montgomery) is the elected One of the planet. Beata allows the enterprise team to make a brief visit to search for the missing Federation crew. Deanna takes a lead in communicating with the female dominated society.

Beata confirms that there are 4 male survivors from the Odin. The leader is Ramsey (Sam Hennings). They are in hiding on the planet. 7 years ago when they came, he accepted the hospitality, but later grew restive and even questioned the natural order. Beata asks the Enterprise to look for these fugitives and remove them from the planet as soon as possible. They face an unusual problem when they find the survivors. They don't want to be rescued as now they have wives and kids on the planet, even though they remain in hiding. They claim Beata is afraid of them, since she believes they will start a patriarchal society on Angel One, and hence wants them gone from the planet.

Data tells Yar and Deanna that since Odin was not a star ship, its crew is not bound by the Prime Directive. Thus, they can't force Ramsey and his men to leave if them, if they want to stay. Turns out Beata's 2nd in command Ariel (Patricia McPherson) is in love with Ramsey and reveals herself when the Enterprise trio leave. As for Riker, he has to tread carefully when the planet's leader, Beata, takes an interest in him. Beata invites Riker for some drinks and wants to have sex with him, and eventually Riker gives in. The trio reunites with Riker. Since Riker refuses to force Ramsey and his men to leave, Beata orders their death.

Aboard the Enterprise Picard and Dr. Crusher have their own crisis when a severe flu epidemic strikes the crew. Picard is also infected. Geordi is acting captain. Beverly is under major strain as her sickbay is overwhelmed. The virus mutates every 20 mins, but zero fatalities yet. She figures out that the virus travels by imitating the scent of a perfume that initiates deep inhalation by another person. Enterprise also receives reports of a Federation outpost near the Neutral zone tracking 7 Romulan battleships. USS Berlin has responded but will need a backup. Riker wants to beam to the Enterprise and defend the outpost, but Deanna doesn't want to surrender the 4 men to Beata.

Beata figures out Ariel is supporting Ramsey. Riker speaks to Beata again and offers to take the 4 Odin crew and all of their ""associates"", including Ariel. But now Beverly won't allow anyone to come aboard the Enterprise as the virus has consumed everyone. Riker sends Data up, with orders to take Enterprise to the outpost to defend against the Romulans. Data reckons there is still time before USS Berlin will be overwhelmed and figures they have 48 mins to fix things on the planet and on the ship. Riker argues to Beata that Ramsey did not start the revolution, he merely became a symbol of the changes in Angel society which were already well underway. Beata finds truth in this and releases the captives. Beverly finds the antidote. Beata exiles the revolutionaries to a remote part of the planet. Riker leaves with Yar and Deanna."

The Enterprise is one week late than scheduled, due to another task it had to perform on the way. The upgrade is in the hands of the Bynars, an advanced race whose minds work in Binary code. Cmdr. Orfil Quinteros (Gene Dynarski) is in charge. Bynars operate in pairs. One Zero (Alexandra Johnson) and Zero One (Katy Boyer) are one such pair in charge of the refit. Picard says that Bynars became very connected to the main computer on their planet and gradually evolved into binary beings themselves, with a binary language. Riker has a strange feeling about the Bynars and asks Wesley to keep an eye on them.

For Picard and the crew, it's an opportunity to relax and have a bit of Rest and Recreation. Beverly leaves for a meeting with Dr Epstein & is very excited about the same. Epstein is the leading mind in cybernetics and happened to be on the star base when the Enterprise is visiting.

Commander Riker is never quite sure what to do with himself on these layovers, so he decides to spend some time on the Holodeck in a New Orleans jazz bar. The Holodeck has also been upgraded by the Bynars after its earlier glitch and the Bynars invite Riker to try it out. There Riker meets the beautiful Minuet (Carolyn McCormick) and if it's possible to fall in love with a computer image, he practically does so. Picard soon joins them, but the Holodeck party is oblivious to what is happening on the ship.

When the warp containment field begins to fail, Commander Data orders the evacuation of the ship Data has 4:17 mins before the containment field fails and the antimatter connects with matter and explodes. Data sends the ship off into the far reaches of space not realizing Riker and the Captain are still aboard inside the Holodeck. The computer confirmed to Data that Riker and Picard were not on the ship. But as the ship leaves, Orfil realizes that the magnetic fields around the anti-matter are regenerating. Everyone is off except Picard, Riker and the Bynars. Soon, Picard realizes that Minuet doesn't want him or Riker to leave the Holodeck. He gets a situation update from the computer. They are headed for planet Bynaus. Looks like the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise.

Picard and Riker arm themselves and then set the ship on auto-destruct. They have 5 minutes. They notice an enormous amount of data being received and stored on the Enterprise' computer banks. They access the bridge and find 4 Bynars lying unconscious & dying. Picard and Riker cancel the auto-destruct as they reach the Bynaus planet. They find that the main computer on Bynaus is off. They question Minuet and find that a star in the Bynar system was about to go Nova. The EMP from that would have shut down their computer and erased all data, so they planned to shift all data into the only mobile computer large enough (Enterprise) and shift it back after the EMP passed.

But the Nova went off earlier than expected and Enterprise was one week late to the star base. So, they transferred the data to the star base instead. She doesn't know why the Bynars are dying. She wants Picard to return the data to the computer below but doesn't know how.

Picard figures out that the pass code is the combination of the Bynars names 11001001. The transfer gets started and the main system reboots. The Bynars recover. They held Riker on the Holodeck since they knew they might die and needed someone to restore the computers. They didn't ask for help as they thought there was a risk of rejection, and the stakes were too high."

The message was delivered by the ruler of Mordan, called Karnas. He says terrorists have captured a Federation ambassador and his staff hostage and won't negotiate with him. He requested for Admiral Jamieson as the negotiator. The Admiral makes it quite clear that he is in command the mission, but not the ship.

Jamieson is travelling with his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt). Jamieson tells Picard that Karnas has been insulted by these abductions and would want revenge against the terrorists. On the way, Jamieson, who is quite elderly and suffering from the incurable Iverson's disease, takes an alien rejuvenation drug (without telling Anne) that makes him younger. Jamieson refuses to submit to medical tests on board the Enterprise, as per protocol. Beverly is alarmed at the improvement Jamieson is showing as there are no known cases of recovery from the Iverson's disease. But the alien drug also causes debilitating pain in Jamieson's chest, one of which requires him to seek help from Beverly. She finds traces of alien chemicals in his blood, and no trace of the Iverson disease.

When confronted Jamieson admits that he procured 2 doses of the drug, one for Anne and one for himself and was testing it on himself first, as the process was advised to be very painful. The drug had to be administered in slow dosage over 2 years, but the situation on Mordan IV convinced him to take all the doses for both him and Anne, in a single shot. And it worked.

Jamieson calls Karnas to ask him some questions about the terrorists and their history. But it soon becomes apparent that the hostages are being held by the planet's ruler, Karnas (Michael Pataki), not a terrorist group as he had claimed. Jamieson asks Picard to increase Enterprise speed from warp 4 to warp 8 to reach early and catch Karnas off guard. He also re-looks at plans of the underground tunnels of the destroyed city on Mordan IV, over which their new capital was built. He feels that Karnas has kept the hostages in the same tunnels. He plans to lead an away team on a rescue mission. Beverly tells Anne that Jamieson's body is becoming unstable, and he will not live through this process of cellular change.

When it also come to light that Jamieson's, success was not brought about in the manner recorded in Federation history books. Jamieson admits to Picard that 40 years ago Karnas was holding Federation people hostage to ask Federation for weapons. He intended to kill his rivals, who had murdered his father. Jamieson went in and gave Karnas the weapons he wanted but gave the same weapons to his rivals. This led to 40 years of civil war on the planet. Jamieson saved 63 lives and falsified the records to Starfleet. This time Jamieson leads the away team as planned, but his team comes under attack from Karnas's forces. He gets the pain in his chest again, and Picard has no choice but to beam the entire team back up.

Karnas promises to execute 1 hostage every 5 mins Jamieson is delayed. Despite his condition, Jamieson insists on going, to correct his mistake from 40 years ago. Picard and Beverly accompany him. Karnas refuses to believe that Jamieson is so young. Picard shows him visual proof of this change. He also beams down Anne, as Jamieson doesn't have much time left. Jamieson shows Karnas the blood cut on his hand they both made, to seal the deal. Karnas refuses to kill Jamieson and he dies in front of his eyes. Karnas is at peace and hostages are freed."

But now suddenly the cloaking device is off, and the planet reveals itself to the Enterprise. Rashella (Brenda Strong) welcomes the Enterprise to Aldea.

Prime administrator Radue (Jerry Hardin) & his wife Duana (Ivy Bethune) show Riker, Deanna, and Beverly, whom they had beamed down without asking them, how their people lead a life of leisure, trusting their central computer takes care of all necessities. But they can't solve a medical nightmare: endemic infertility, so they need to 'adopt' earthling children. In exchange, they propose to provide tech info that would take humans centuries to acquire. Their computer even conducts a scan of the entire ship, identifying all the kids on board the ship.

Negotiations obviously fail as Riker says no, while Deanna explains that humans are very attached to their offspring. The Aldeans suddenly snatch Wesley and several younger children as they have the ability to transporter anyone from the Enterprise without their wish. They are particularly interested in the gifted crew kids.

Picard can barely keep negotiating credibly enough to keep the Aldeans from disappearing behind their cloaking device again, while Data works on finding a way through their shields, so they can transport an away team down to the planet and neutralize their power source. Wesley manages to study and befriend the locals while planning a minimal risk revolt. He is the eldest of the abducted kids and takes charge. Radue assigns the kids to their new families, as per their future talents and interests. Rashella gets attached to a small girl and she won't allow Radue to assign her to her designated family. She wants to keep her.

Working with Duana, Wesley is shown the planet's computer and a mysterious room that he thinks contains the power source. The planet's computer has had no maintenance for many centuries. Beverly is allowed to meet Wesley briefly when she is down on the planet to negotiate with Radue and she uses Wesley to conduct a quick hidden scan on Duana.

Radue threatens Picard that if they don't accept his terms, he will throw the Enterprise into the depths of the Galaxy. He demonstrates that with a slight Repulsor to the Enterprise which puts them 3 days away from the planet at warp 9. Beverly figures that Duana is dying due to Chromosomal damage which could be hereditary or environmental. She later figures out that the Aldean ozone layer has weakened over centuries and hence the effect of their damage is far more now than in the past. It is reversible with proper treatment Meanwhile the kids on the planet are sad, and their adoptive families can see that, they are not happy.

Wesley gathers the kids and tells to resist their Aldean parents passively. They all stop eating. Picard and Beverly are invited for the last round of negotiations. Separately, Data and Riker beam down through the hole Data figured out in the shields. They work on knocking off the planet's power source. As Riker gets to the power source, Beverly explains to Radue that ozone depletion has led to radiation poisoning in their bodies for centuries. Sterility is only the latest symptom and if the kids stay, they will also die. Rashella believes Beverly. Riker disables the power source and Picard beams the kids up. Beverly treats the Aldeans. Picard figures out that removing the shield fixes the ozone layer. The myth of Aldea will die, but the people will live and produce kids."

The team's leader, Kurt Mandl (Walter Gotell), isn't very welcoming stating that they are very busy, but Picard insists with Riker, Data and Geordi beaming down to the planet. Deanna had advised Picard that the Enterprise alarms Kurt for some reason and that he is deliberately hiding something. Louisa (Elizabeth Lindsey) handles gardening. Arthur Malenson (Mario Roccuzzo) handles hydraulics and Bjorn Benson (Gerard Prendergast) is the chief engineer. Arthur is having trouble with power surges in the hydraulic conversion chambers.

Louisa explains that Terraforming involves phase 2, where water is formed on the planet. On Velara all the water is sub-surface but is extremely high in salt content. So, Arthur and his machines are in charge of pumping the water out of the ground and filtering it, making it fit for consumption and also supporting life.

Velara III was selected because of its complete absence of any life forms and the Terraforming initiative takes about 30 years. The team is now in the process of removing salts from the natural water supply as the first step in creating a sustainable environment. Arthur is sent to the hydraulics chamber by Kurt, where they are using laser drills for the Terraforming process. The lasers come ""alive"" and start attacking Arthur. They only stop when Arthur stops screaming. Yar beams Arthur to the Enterprise for medical help.

Data restores power to hydraulics chamber and figures out that the lasers were not moving by some predetermined programming or some form of highly advanced dynamic programming. They were following the life form inside the chamber. The laser attacks him as well, but he is able to survive. Data destroys the laser drill. Arthur dies in orbit on board the Enterprise. Picard reckons one of the 3 survivors programmed the laser drill to kill Arthur. But they don't know why.

On the planet, Geordi and Data come across a non-carbon-based object that glows and gives the appearance of life. They beam it up and Beverly thinks this is an inorganic life form. Kurt refuses knowledge of this, but Deanna knows he is lying. Kurt had advanced degrees in Artificial Intelligence and Programming. Picard investigates the possibility that Kurt reprogrammed the lasers to kill Arthur.

When the object attempts to communicate with the crew, it is obvious they have encountered a life form like no other. The life form divides to reproduce and suddenly tries to speak to Picard and Beverly via the translator. Multiple cells have organized themselves into a basic computer. Picard panics and orders the quarantine of the medical lab. Picard confronts Kurt, who admits he knew about the silicone-based crystals, but said he wasn't aware that they had any life. He says he attributed any signals coming from it to natural planetary phenomenon. Meanwhile the quarantine around the lab, starts failing as energy keeps getting diverted to other areas.

The life form again speaks to Picard via the translator and says that they were being killed on the surface and the humans did not stop despite communication. They declare war on humans and start destabilizing the Enterprise. Through electrical impulses, they have hacked into the Enterprise computers and reprogrammed them, and now have total control over them.

Picard learns that Arthur was taking water from the saline water layer on the surface when he was killed. He understands that the saline water is how the life form on the planet connected to each other and remained intelligent. Removing the saline layer would have led to extinction. Beverly and notices that the life form spends a lot of energy to reproduce but has no energy source. Geordi offers that it has cadmium and hence might be photo-electric in nature. Picard turns off the lights in the medical bay and forces the life form to surrender for peace.

Picard and the life form, agree to end of the war. Picard transports them to the surface and leaves the planet with the Terraforming team."

Only one of the four will be accepted into the Academy and the competition will be strong. Wesley is particularly worried about the psychological evaluation which will focus on what he fears most. He has no idea what that is, however.

Picard's old friend, Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello) requests to be beamed aboard and arrives with Commander Remmick (Robert Schenkkan) from the Inspector General's office. Remmick is there to conduct a complete investigation of the ship's operations. Quinn says he has reason to believe that there is something very wrong on the Enterprise.

His very presence is unnerving to both the captain and the bridge crew and his questions to the senior officers all seem to indicate that it is Captain Picard who is under investigation with his decisions, judgment and reliability all in question. They are questioned about Picard's decision making process during the Kosinski incident or the Ferengi incident.

During Remmick's presence, one of the passengers Jake Kurland (Stephen Gregory) steals a shuttle craft from the bay and escapes from the Enterprise. Jake was friends with Wesley and is disappointed for not being shortlisted for the academy test. Jake had lower test scores and hence did not qualify for the academy entrance exam. Jake intends to join a freighter to roam the stars. But he damages the shuttle craft engines and is headed to burn up in Relva's atmosphere. Tractor beams won't work and engines wont restart for 30 secs. Picard maintains his calm, gives precise instructions to Jake, and helps him avoid death by maneuvering his spacecraft out of the atmosphere.

Wesley has another spot test on Relva where he is confronted with a violent bully. But he notices a webbing on the bully's hand and understands it's a Zoldan who view courtesy as a sign of disrespect. Wesley becomes rude and the Zoldan gracefully backs off. The instructor is impressed. Wesley also helps other candidates when they struggle in the tests and shares helpful tips with them.

Meanwhile Remmick continues to investigate the ship. He questions and harasses every member of the crew to find out something wrong with the Enterprise. The crew is clear that they don't like Remmick, but they also cooperate with him and answer his questions professionally. Picard confronts Quinn and wants this charade to stop. Quinn asks Remmick to prepare his report.

In the psych test Wesley is faced with a simulated explosion on the test center. Wesley gets into the explosion area and finds hydrogen leaking from storage (which will blow at any second) and saves an old man. But he cannot save a frightened young person, who won't come out of the room, before it is sealed to contain the explosion. He later learns that this was a test. He had to make a choice and he did. The same way that Picard made a choice and Wesley's father died.

Mordoc is selected eventually, even though he says Wesley should be selected since he lost points for helping him. Picard consoles Wesley by telling him that he also failed the first time.

Remmick completes his reports and presents to Quinn that he couldn't find what Quinn was looking for, except a casual familiarity within the crew and a sense of family. Remmick says he would like to serve on board the Enterprise after his tour of the IG office is finished. Quinn finally reveals that the Federation is under threat from insiders. Someone is attacking the very fabric of the Federation and thus Starfleet want to be very sure about whom they want to trust.

There is debris in the area and the freighter has obviously suffered some damage. The metal skin of the freighter is fatigued due to prolonged battle and is likely to rupture in 5 mins. Picard sends Riker, Data and Geordi as an away team to investigate the freighter.

On board, they find 3 Klingons with one of them seriously injured. The survivors are not very forthcoming about what happened on their ship nor how three Klingon warriors even ended up on a space freighter. All of them are beamed to the Enterprise before the ship blows up.

On the Enterprise the Klingons are led by Cmdr. Korris (Vaughn Armstrong). He says they were passengers on board the Talerian cargo vessel, when they came under attack from the Ferengi. The cargo captain had no combat experience, so the Klingons took over and deceived the Ferengi into lowering their shields by playing dead. Once they did, the Talerian ship blasted them to bits with some old rockets. They say that during the battle the ship might have drifted into the neutral zone. Picard and Worf are not completely satisfied since the weapons discharge in the area of battle do not resemble the Ferengi. They resemble Klingon weapon discharges. Picard contacts Starfleet to find out everything possible about Korris and his crew.

After the injured Klingon dies, the remaining two (Korris & Konmel) try to recruit Worf to their cause by appealing to his Klingon heritage and pride. Worf is probably the only Klingon serving on a human Starfleet vessel. Worf was raised on a Klingon outpost when it was attacked by Romulans. He was left for dead underneath the debris, when a human Starfleet officer rescued him and raised him as his son. This happened before his age of inclusion into the Klingon society. Korris and Konmel tell him they were looking for a new world where they could be true Klingons warriors and that the debris the Enterprise found was actually that of a Klingon battle cruiser they fought and destroyed (the cruiser had been sent to bring them back). Korris and Konmel argue that the new alliance is a death to warriors like them, and their eventual mission is to break the alliance.

The Enterprise soon comes into contact with a second Klingon cruiser led by Cmdr K'Nera (David Froman), that wants the renegades (Korris and Konmel) arrested and turned over to them. K'Nera informs Picard that Korris and his men destroyed the Klingon Cruiser that was sent to arrest them and bring them back. Picard asks Yar to locate the Klingons and confine them to security. Korris wants Worf to fight for them, but he doesn't intervene. Yar arrests the Klingons and puts them in a holding cell. Worf knows that K'Nera will execute the prisoners. With Picard's permission, Worf pleads Korris's case with K'Nera and says that the renegades deserve punishment, but not death with dishonor. Worf wants the prisoners to be released on a planet in the Halee system with weapons in their hands. The planets have dangerous life forms, which will kill the prisoners, but that would be an honorable death for the Klingons.

K'Nera says his hands are tied and he cannot send them to the Halee system, as requested. Korris and his associate Konmel (Charles Hyman) try to escape the brig, but Konmel is killed. Korris is now loose and armed. He gets into engineering and aims his phaser on the main Dilithium chambers. Worf seeks permission to intervene. Korris wants to separate the saucer of the Enterprise and gain access of the battle bridge and wage war on the Federation. Worf tells Korris that his goals are not the Klingon way and that he is not a real warrior. When Korris attacks, Worf kills him."

Drake was investigating why all intelligent life on the planet Minos had disappeared. Minos people were arms suppliers. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced weaponry. They had no restrictions on which side they sold to during a war, and usually sold to both. Drake was commanded by Paul Rice (Marco Rodríguez), who was with Riker at the academy. Riker says Rice was a risk taker. The planet shows no sign of life. Yet, the Enterprise encounters a message from a planet offering to sell them arms. The messenger, essentially a holographic image called the Peddler (Vincent Schiavelli), invites them to the planet below.

The surface of the planet is heavily forested. There, the away team led by Commander Riker comes under attack from a myriad of weapons. Riker comes in contact with Paul Rice, who appears to be unharmed on the planet, but the bridge recognizes him as an energy signature. Riker argues with the Paul Rice's image and proves that it's not real. The image didn't even know Riker's first name and that's how Riker was able to unmask it. The image converts into a hovering weapon that encases Riker into an energy field and makes him immobile. Data suggests that the hover was an intelligence gathering device, which when found out, encased the subject in a field for further interrogation. He can break the field but needs the exact frequency.

This leads Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher to also beam down to the planet. Picard and Beverly too are attacked, and Dr. Crusher is seriously wounded, when they both fall into a deep cavern.

Data and Yar can't find them, but Data frees Riker. In orbit, Enterprise comes under attack from a hidden object. Aboard the Enterprise, Lt. Laforge is left in command for the first time in a crisis situation. He has to deal with being under attack from these unknown weapons systems and he can't beam up the away team as his shields and deflectors are up. Chief Engineer Logan (Vyto Ruginis) is the ranking officer and wants Geordi to relinquish command to him. Geordi refuses.

On ground, the trio is attacked by a new set of hovers, who have learned from the previous attacks and have improvised (they have a deflector shield now). Data says new weapons are coming at an interval of 12 mins. Beverly has lost a lot of blood and Picard has to work very hard to keep her alive and awake.

On the bridge, Geordi's gambit to fire phasers and photons by analyzing the attack paths of the hidden object, fails. Shields and backup systems are failing. Geordi summons Logan to the bridge and orders the Enterprise to leave the planet at warp 5. He then orders a full stop after 28 seconds and tells Logan that he will command the Saucer section, while Geordi will go back to rescue Picard and the away team in the Star Drive section.

Meanwhile inside the caverns, Picard finds the command unit of the entire planet's defense system. The Peddler again comes into view and talks about the perfect killing system. The Peddler thinks he is giving a demo to potential buyers. The Peddler claims that the system is self-learning and can neutralize all surface and orbital threats. Picard figures out that the creators were wiped out once they turned the system on. Data, Yar and Riker locate Picard and Beverly, just before the next, improved unit attacks. Picard tells the Peddler that he has convinced him and that he will buy the unit and asks him to shut down the system, which he does. Meanwhile Geordi takes the Enterprise into the atmosphere and hope to locate its hidden attackers via its turbulence in the air. The plan works and Worf destroys the unit with phasers. They rescue the away team."

It is an Ornaran freighter named Sanction, captained by T'Jon (Merritt Butrick). The transmission is coming from the freighter in orbit around the 4th planet, but receiver is on the 3rd planet. They try to pull the Sanction out of orbit with a tractor beam, but can't maintain the beam, due to the heavy interference from solar flares. T'Jon seems very inept and can't even fix basic functions of his ship, even when told where the problem lies in its operations. He is unable to carry out simple repair tasks on his own ship.

A decision is made to beam over the crew since destruction of the freighter is imminent. Two of the six people aboard are killed as there's no time left to beam aboard properly because the cargo was sent first, yet the surviving crew members seem to care only for the freight. Their passengers, from the 3rd planet Brekka, contest ownership because their agreed payment aboard the freighter was lost. It's their only produce of Felicium, vital for the 4th planet Ornara since it was struck by a general plague. Sobi (Judson Scott) & Langor (Kimberley Farr) are from the 3rd planet Brekka, who are selling the Felicium. Romas (Richard Lineback) & T'Jon are from the 4th planet Ornara who are the buyers of the Felicium from Brekka. Both races can produce electrical charges from their bodies as a weapon. The last contact with Delos was 200 years ago when one race was about to acquire space travel. They haven't made much progress since then.

T'Jon and Romas ask Picard for help in repairing the remaining 2 freighters on their planet as they are inoperative and nobody on their planet knows how to fix them. In front of Picard, T'Jon and Romas argue that they need the Felicium as medicine. Sobi & Langor argue that they have cultivated and purified the Felicium, which is expensive. T'Jon says that the payment was on board the freighter, but Langor says it has been destroyed, due to no fault of theirs.

Picard is alarmed that the Ornarans have brought a plague on board his ship and summons Dr Crusher to the observation lounge. Yet Dr. Crusher soon realizes it's not really medicine as they have no plague symptoms yet suffer immensely without the medicine. Brekkeians as a society produces only Felicium, which they themselves have no use for. They provide Felicium to Ornarians, who provide them with everything else in exchange. The Felicium only subdues the symptoms for 72 hours, after which the symptoms return. There is no cure for the plague. The barrel of cargo rescued contains over 4 billion doses of Felicium.

Beverly concludes Felicium is an addictive drug. The plague was cured 200 years ago, but now only the addiction remains. Data adds that Ornara was the technologically advanced planet and was stuck by plague 200 years ago. Their technology had no cure. The cure was found in a plant only found on Brekka. It could not be cultivated on Ornara. So, a trading relation developed between 2 planets, which exists till date.

T'Jon abducts Riker with his electrical charges and wants Picard to release the Felicium to them. But Picard refuses to negotiate. The Brekkians tell Picard that they are willing to release the Felicium against a loan. Picard realizes that the Brekkians know that there is no plague. He further insinuates that the Brekkians had the plague as well and were cured long ago. They knew about the addiction of Felicium and broke the cycle for themselves, but never told Ornarians and kept them hooked to the product and even increased its potency.

But Picard decides not to interfere due to the prime directive, even though Beverly says this is exploitation, plain and simple. But then Picard also refuses to give the Ornarians the replacement parts for their freighters. Without the freighters there would be no more shipments of Felicium."

She is returning from a conference. The shuttle is stuck by a buffeting force of some kind and is now crashing towards the Vagra II planet, which is uninhabited. The shuttle in touch with the Enterprise, but Enterprise can't get there quickly to help as Dilithium crystals are under maintenance and they are on impulse power only.

Enterprise gets to Vagra II and finds the shuttle under a lot of debris. Due to this, transportation is not possible. Worf is able to pick up faint life signals but is not sure. Picard orders an away team. Away team of Riker, Beverly, Data and Yar beam down, but Counsellor Troi is held captive on a deserted planet by a slick, black, oily, sentient, and immortal puddle of evil. The Slick prevents the away team from reaching the shuttle. The Slick is called Armus (Mart McChesney) and speaks to the away team about their analysis about it, by taking a humanoid form.

Yar tries to bypass Armus but is thrown away by it. Phasers have no impact. Yar is pronounced dead by Beverly. The away team is beamed back up on orders from Picard. Dr Crusher makes all efforts to revive Tasha Yar, but is not successful. Dr Crusher says that there was too much synaptic damage.

Meanwhile, the slick covers the shuttle craft, where Deanna regains consciousness. She had felt Tasha die and knows that the act of killing Tasha had no meaning for Armus. Deanna communicates with Armus and finds that Armus has a great need to make living things suffer. He killed Yar for no reason at all and wanted her to suffer more before she died. Armus wants to break spirits of other living beings.

Deanna figures out that Armus was left on the planet by some other beings, and they never came back for him. Therefore, he is angry. He is also surprised when Riker, Beverly, Data and Geordi again beam down to rescue Deanna. Armus tries to play with them and humiliate them, but they refuse to participate in his mind games.

Armus tells Deanna that a species found a way to discard all that was evil and vile within them. The process created the Slick, and in time the Slick developed a 2nd skin, which became Armus. The species left Armus on the deserted planet, as they had no need for it. Armus envelops Riker completely. Armus threatens to kill everyone if any of them try to leave the planet. Deanna can feel Riker's pain inside Armus. Picard finds out that Armus's energy field goes down whenever it is speaking to Deanna. Now Picard beams down to speak to Armus. Picard refuses to negotiate with Armus. Armus returns Riker as Picard won't order his crew to entertain Armus unless he can see his people. But Armus still won't allow Picard to go near the shuttle and see Deanna.

Armus then allows Data, Riker, Geordi and Beverly to leave. Armus tells Picard he will spares lives in exchange for Picard giving him transportation to a destination of his choice. Picard engages with Armus and says he believes Armus is not evil. His aim is to lower the energy level of Armus below 2.7, so they can beam up Deanna and Picard. Picard is successful and Enterprise is able to beam up both Picard and Deanna, leaving Armus down on the planet all alone.

They destroy the shuttle and declare Vagra II off-limits to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving the planet ever. Tasha Yar is still dead."

His latest trial goes terribly wrong, causing a time-distorting ripple to spread from a binary star system of Vendor. One of stars in the binary star system is a pulsar.

As Picard follows Manheim's signals, Deanna can sense Picard is very emotional about this topic. Jean-Luc Picard is largely focused on Paul's younger wife Jenice (Michelle Phillips), once Jean-Luc's fiance, whom he dumped in Paris for his Starfleet dream. Jenice and Picard were supposed to meet at a cafe in Paris to elope. But Picard decided to pursue his career and never showed up. This is one of the main reasons why Picard never married and doesn't have a family. He still pines for Jenice.

From a Planetoid in Vandor, the enterprise beams up Paul and his wife Jenice. Paul is convulsing and is unable to talk. Both are beamed directly to sick bay for urgent medical attention. Jenice tells Picard that Paul tried for 2 years to find a system like Vandor (a Planetoid around a binary star) to conduct his experiment. Data reckons Paul was looking for a system in which he could access the dense gravity of the pulsar. His experiment was to prove the non-linear nature of time, which in his view, would open a window into the other infinite dimensions that he believed existed. Jenice also says that Paul suspected that something could go wrong with his experiments. So, he erected a force field around the Planetoid and always kept Jenice in a safe room right before the experiment. Jenice also says that Paul erected an elaborate set of security procedures around the lab to keep intruders away.

Data scans the Planetoid and finds an immense source of energy, near to Manheim's lab. Jenice says a 2nd lab on the Planetoid was destroyed in an experiment several weeks ago. Data says Manhiem may have developed a method to harness the energy from the Pulsar.

Paul gets better. He is still in pain and says his body is straddling 2 dimensions at the same time and he is unable to focus his mind and admits to using the pulsar's energy to open a window into another dimension. He learns that the effect is not isolated on the Planetoid and is spreading fast throughout the galaxy. To prevent the galaxy being ripped open, the process must be reversed, although gravely (maybe fatally) injured Manheim can only give unreliable instructions to Data. Paul gives them the right coordinates to beam down safely into the lab, and the codes to bypass the security system.

Jenice meets Picard privately and demands to know why he didn't meet her that day in Paris. Picard admits that he was afraid. She waited all day and wondered for many years on what might have been. Jenice knows that Picard left as he felt that life with her would have made him ordinary.

Deanna speaks to Beverly who is secretly in love with Picard and can't compete with his ex-flame. Picard orders Data to beam down alone, as he is not impacted by the effects of time distortion, as he is an android. Using Paul's instructions, Data beams down to the Planetoid and bypasses his security systems to gain entry to Paul's lab. He adds a precise amount of antimatter to the time distortion, when the next one occurs, to close the rip in space-time Continuum. Paul recovers in the sick bay and decides to go back to his lab to continue his work.

Picard completes his date with Jenice at the cafe in Paris, using the Holodeck. He says a proper goodbye."

Keel refuses to discuss anything with Picard on subspace frequencies, even though they are deemed secure. He wants a face-to-face meeting. The Enterprise reaches Dytallix B and finds Tryla and Rixx's ships already in orbit. The 3rd ship approaching the planet is an admiral class heavy cruiser, USS Horatio, commanded by Captain Keel. Dytallix B used to be a mining planet but has long been exhausted and now abandoned. Keel greets Picard with a series of very personal questions (where they first met, where did he introduce Jack Crusher to Beverly, name of Keel's brother (he didn't have a brother, only 2 sisters)) to test whether Picard is himself or not.

The vague innuendo about a plot to take over strategic sectors of the Federation by replacing mysteriously killed Starfleet officers doesn't quite impress Picard. Rixx says that the lack of memory is the unseen's enemy's biggest weakness. Picard reconsiders after Keel and his crew die in an explosion. Keel had told Picard that he suspected that it has spread to his own ship. His first officer is not himself and his medical officer can't be trusted as well. Rixx had spoken about change in behavior of the top admirals at Starfleet, but they were always accompanied by a loss of memory. Keel's death impacts Picard very hard. He takes Deanna and Riker into confidence. He also tells Riker about Admiral Quinn's uneasiness a few months ago when he offered him a Starfleet academy job.

Picard asks Data to analyze all Starfleet commands in the last few months for abnormal patterns. He finds a cluster of star bases and outposts where command personnel have been changed recently. And the new folks have spoken directly to highest levels of Starfleet command at high frequency. The purpose of these re-assignments is to control vital sections of Federation territory.

So, Picard intends with Riker to visit Starfleet HQ on Earth, where he will dine with admirals and their aide Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan), while Riker keeps an eye on admiral Aaron (Ray Reinhardt), who insists on visiting the modernized Enterprise. Admiral Quinn (Ward Costello) comes on board prior to the proposed dinner and brings on board an alien parasitic creature in a small box. Picard speaks to Quinn about his apprehensions. Quinn says that Picard misunderstood, and he was simply referring to issues with assimilating new species into the Federation.

Picard's red flags go up. Picard beams down for the dinner but asks Riker to keep an eye on Quinn and get him into a medical exam. As Riker meets Quinn, he attacks Riker. Quinn has somehow acquired incredible strength for a man 80 years old and overpowers him, and later Geordi and Worf as well. Finally, Beverly subdues Quinn with phasers. In the sickbay, she finds evidence of an alien parasite nested on Quinn's brain. The parasite breathes through a small gill protruding through the host's neck and will be visible on anybody who is infected. The parasite cannot be removed without killing the host.

Beverly relays this information to Picard. Picard finds everyone in HQ has been infected with this parasite. Riker beams down and it looks like he has been infected as well (Quinn planted the parasite on Riker before Geordi and Worf could come into his cabin to help Riker), as he stops Picard from beaming back. Tryla Scott is also part of the group. But then Riker starts phasing all attendants of the dinner. The alien protrusion on Riker's neck was faked by Beverly to make it look like he was infected.

Turns out Remmick was the mastermind behind this entire scheme. All the alien parasites get into his body, and when Picard fires on him, they find the parasite ""mother"" nested inside Remmick's body. Picard & Riker kill it as well. Turns out Remmick was working on sending a homing beacon to an uncharted section of the Galaxy. Meaning there is a whole planet of these things out there."

The vessel had many pods, but only 3 were found to have people alive, the rest were empty or with broken seals (due to which bodies had decomposed). Data and Worf beam back the 3 frozen bodies aboard, as Picard orders to take Enterprise into the Neutral zone, as per his orders.

Picard briefs his command crew that Romulans are suspected of attacking Federation outposts along the neutral zone. 2 outposts and 1 star base near the neutral zone have been destroyed. Strategic decision is to send in a single ship to assess the situation. Starfleet believes Romulans are seeking a confrontation, wanting to test themselves in battle.

Beverly thaws the 3 people and figures out each has a terminal medical condition. She tells Picard these were perhaps Cryonics, people who froze themselves just before death, so that they could be awakened in a future time, when they can be treated. Beverly has treated them of their conditions and now they are waiting to be wakened. Cryonics was a fad in the late 20th century, but in the case of this particular group, it worked.

The trio are Clare Raymond (Gracie Harrison) (housewife, 35 years old, died of embolism), Ralph Offenhouse (Peter Mark Richman) (Financier, 55 years old, heart attack), L.Q. 'Sonny' Clemmons (Leon Rippy) (Musician, massive chemical substance abuse). Picard is annoyed at Data as Picard wants to focus on the Romulans. He asks Riker to keep the guests away from him.

Enterprise is 6 hours away from the neutral zone and there are no communications from any of the Federation outposts in this region. Picard has to assume they were all destroyed by the Romulans. Riker says Romulans have been out of touch for 53 years, and hence this is ploy by them to see how far the Federation has advanced in technology and technique. Romulans are related to Vulcans and believe in their superiority. They live in extremes, can be very violent one moment and very tender the next. The Romulans will never initiate anything and will wait for Picard to make the first move.

Ralph demands to see Picard and says he has substantial investments on Earth and needs to contact his lawyers. Picard admonishes Ralph for his materialistic ambitions and tells him to stay off the communications panels. He asks Deanna to control the sobbing Clare. Sonny wants drugs from Beverly, but she refuses Deanna helps Clare trace back the history of her family after her death.

At the edge of the Neutral Zone, the Enterprise figures that the outpost Delta 05 was not destroyed, it was scooped off the face of the planet. There are nine outposts at the edge of the neutral zone and Picard intends to inspect each one of them in a calm and orderly manner. Ralph is angry that he doesn't know what is going on, and barges in on the bridge. This is when the Romulans decloak and reveal their ship. Just prior to this, Picard disregarded all suggestions to transfer power to phasers or arm the torpedoes, as that would give away their intent. Worf is particularly against Romulans, who had attacked the Khitomer outpost, resulting in the death of his parents. Worf says Romulans are without honor and hate humans and Klingons.

Cmdr. Tebok (Marc Alaimo) & Sub Cmdr. Thei (Anthony James) oversees the Romulan ship. They say that Romulan outposts on their side of the neutral zone have also been destroyed in the same way. Picard proposes a collaboration to find out what happened. Tebok warns Picard that Romulans have been absent for 50 years and Federation has expanded, but now they are back. Picard arranges for the trio to be transferred to an Earth-bound ship USS Charleston."

Teddy laments that his son can't hear the beautiful music and puts the headphones on him, turning the music louder and louder in an aggressive attempt to get Teddy to hear it.

Theo uses binoculars to spy on Charles, Oliver, and Mabel as they plan their next move. Later, he breaks in to Charles' apartment and takes a picture of their clue board, which includes his father as a prime suspect. He shows his father the picture and warns that the trio of podcasters is onto him. Teddy says that it's his job to look after Theo, not the other way around, and that he believes in the old adage of keeping your friends close but your enemies closer.

Oliver lures Teddy out of his apartment under the pretext of a lunch meeting about the podcast. While he's gone, Charles and Mabel break into the apartment. They find a hidden closet filled with urns from the Shine On Funeral Home. When Theo unexpectedly comes home, the two hide and manage to sneak out, although they leave behind one of the gloves they had worn. Theo flashes back to ten years earlier. Mabel and her Hardy Boys had broken into the apartment and Theo hid in the closet. Observing Mabel and her friends through a peep hole, he saw Zoe say that she thinks he's hot. She steals a ring and puts it on her finger. Theo makes a noise and Zoe sees the peephole and realizes he's watching. She discretely signs to him ""I meant it when I said you're hot"". On New Years Eve, Oscar and Zoe share an elevator with Theo and his father on the way to the party. Zoe discretely gropes Theo during the ride. When they get off the elevator, Zoe signs ""Happy New Year"" to Theo. Teddy sees the ring on her finger and confronts Theo.

While Charles is on a date with Jan, Oliver and Mabel attend a service at the Shine on Funeral Home. Seeing urns similar to those in the Dimas' apartment, they sneak into the basement and discover a secret storage room containing jars of jewelry and what appear to be gold fillings. Teddy comes down into the basement. Mabel and Oliver secretly observe him removing jewelry from a dead body. Teddy discovers them and they try to flee but find the door locked. Ten years earlier, at the New Years party, Theo observes Oscar and Zoe arguing. After Oscar leaves he goes and talks to Zoe, telling her that Oscar is no good for her. He asks for the ring back. Zoe signs that ""It's not like you proposed with it."" Theo replies that ""I'll get you a ring one day, if you want."" Realizing that Theo has feelings for her, Zoe laughs in his face, and apologizes for leading him on. When Theo advises her to stop trying to find happiness in other people she gets angry at him, signing that ""you're very confused about which way the pity flows here."" She angrily takes off the ring and gives it back to Theo. She begins hitting him and as he tries to restrain her he accidentally pushes her off the roof. A horrified Theo sees Tim looking on. A tearful Theo goes to his father, who asks him three questions: how bad is it? Are you responsible? Did anyone see you? Teddy confronts Tim Kono, advising him to stay quiet about what he saw or that he and Mabel might meet the same fate as Zoe.

Theo drives a van through the city. In the back are Mabel and Oliver, bound and gagged. He texts his father, warning Teddy that Mabel and Oliver know and have seen everything.

When there's no answer at his door, Oliver tries to break down the door and fails hilariously. Charles arrives from the symphony. Oliver and Mabel lay out their theory, but Charles rejects it, choosing to side with Jan and saying that he doesn't want to be part of their crazy theories. Mabel asks Charles to look at the evidence and she and Oliver leave. Realizing that Jan's apartment will be empty since she's at the symphony, the two of them decide to search it.

Jan arrives at Charles' apartment and apologizes for lying about being first chair. She and Charles sit and have a drink. She sees the bassoon cleaner on the table and asks about it. Charles tells her it was found in Tim's apartment. Jan wonders if Tim played the bassoon too and if the killer is targeting bassoonists. Then she asks if Charles thinks she's a suspect. Charles says that he doesn't but that Mabel and Oliver do. Jan and Charles confess their love for each other. Charles tells Jan that he'd love her even if she killed Tim. Jan comments that Charles isn't drinking as much as she is. He says he's not drinking at all, but merely taking stage sips, because the drink is poisoned.

In Jan's apartment, Oliver and Mabel find a box labeled ""Jan's toxins"" and realize that they were right: Jan poisoned Tim Kono. In Charles' apartment, Jan admits to killing Tim. She had met Tim in the elevator and had begun a sexual relationship with him since she is attracted to ""lonely men with a big age difference"" with her. The night of the murder, she had lured Tim to her place for a last drink, which she had poisoned. It was Jan's trash which Mabel, Oliver and Charles had seen Tim carrying that night. Charles realizes that Jan's bassoon had sounded different that night and that she must have used a recording to help give herself an alibi. Jan asks how Charles figured it out and he points out that the killer's handwriting matched that on a note she had left for him. Charles begins slurring his words. Jan says that she didn't poison the drink this time, but rather Charle's handkerchief. As Charles collapses on the floor, Jan talks about returning to Tim's apartment and shooting him as he lay dying from the poison. She says that this time she's going to do something more spectacular and opens the gas valve on the fireplace to flood the room with gas. As Mabel and Oliver head to Charles' apartment they encounter a tenant who complains of feeling dizzy. They realize that Jan intends to destroy the building to cover her tracks.

After Jan leaves, Charles rises from the floor, having exaggerated how incapacitated he is. Extremely woozy, Charles crawls to the couch and removes his phone from under a pillow. He had been taping the entire conversation, and has Jan's confession. Charles stumbles out of the apartment in an attempt to make it to safety and manages to get on the elevator. There he encounters several other tenants including Bunny, Dr Stanley, and Howard, but since they all hate him, they merely assume he's drunk and do nothing. Lester the doorman, assuming the same thing, but more solicitous of Charles' welfare, puts him back on the elevator and sends it up to his floor. Mabel and Oliver find him there and load the now immobile Charles into Oliver's dog stroller.

Traveling to the basement, they discover that Jan has rigged the gas system to explode and dismantle her changes. Jan arrives and holds Oliver and Charles at gunpoint. Charles stands up and delivers a moving and lucid monologue about his friendship with Mabel and Oliver. This turns out to be all in his mind, as Charles is still incapacitated and his speech is gibberish. Oliver rams Jan with the stroller and Mabel knocks her out. The authorities arrive and arrest Jan. Having saved everyone in the building from death, and caught the murderer of Tim Kono, the three friends enjoy renewed popularity among the tenants. Bunny arrives and tells them that their evictions will be rescinded, but promises to evict Oliver sooner or later. Mabel calls Bunny a ""cranky bitch"".

Some time later, the trio finishes the final episode of Only Murders in the Building. They celebrate with drinks on the building's roof. Mabel excuses herself and heads downstairs. As Charles and Oliver discuss their next move they hear sirens approaching the building. They get a warning text from an unknown number and race downstairs to find Mabel. They discover Mabel kneeling over a dead body in a tie-dyed ""Only Murders in the Building"" hoodie, an enormous bloodstain on her shirt. Mabel tells them ""It's not what you think!"" Rolling the body over, she shows them that it's Bunny and says that the woman stumbled into her apartment already dying. Oliver identifies the apparent murder weapon as one of Mabel's knitting needles. Just then, the police break in, holding all three at gunpoint. The police arrest the friends and lead them out of the building, past the scornful residents, a worried Oscar, and podcast host Cinda Canning. Cinda's assistant, who is taping audio of the events, says ""Coming next fall, 'Only Murderers in the building'."" Cinda steals the idea for her own."

One of them, Steve, discusses how his son was a problem but has turned his life around and how he's taking his son to London on vacation to show how he and his wife appreciate their son's hard work

The villainous Mauler Twins break up through the pavement and bicker about which one of them is the clone of the original. As the White House's weaponry opens up on them, one of the Twins points out that since the President is targeting them, the plan was to kill him publicly. They open fire and destroy the weaponry, and Steve shoots at them and orders them to surrender. He hits one Twin in the eye, hurting him, and the Twin prepares to kill him.

The Guardians of the Globe drop out of the sky and Immortal fights one while Red Rush gets the guards to safety. War Woman has the soldiers evacuated, and the wounded Twin attacks her. Darkwing evacuates civilians, and Green Ghost uses her powers to render some civilians intangible so they're not hurt by debris.

Martian Man and Aquarus fight a Twin breaking through the White House wall, then the heroes go inside to clear the building. The Twin throws a civilian into the sky, and Darkwing snags her and drops to the nearby sidewalk. When the Twin throws a tank at a nearby building, Darkwing and the woman are caught in the collapse. The hero gets the woman clear using his grappling line, but is still trapped. Omni-Man arrives and lifts the tank off of Darkwing, who destroys falling debris landing on Darkwing and flies off on his hover platform.

Immortal tosses more soldiers clear, and Omni-Man flies overhead and grabs them. Once the White House is clear, the Guardians and Omni-Man unite and fight the Twins with no civilians to be harmed. The heroes take out the two villains.

At home, Mark Grayson is in the bathroom on the toilet reading a comic book. His mother Debbie comes in, looking for soap. Later downstairs, Mark watches a newscast about the White House, and tells Debbie that his father Nolan--Omni Man--is there with the Guardians fighting the Mauler Twins. Debbie isn't impressed, and Omni-Man flies down and comes in. He goes to show, and Debbie insists on kissing him first. Mark is disgusted that his parents are talking about sex in front of him.

As Mark prepares to go to school, he overhears his parents talking about going to Berlin for brats. When he complains, Omni-Man says that Mark has school and he can go when his powers kick in. Mark points out that his powers haven't kicked in yet, and Omni-Man assures him that on his home planet Viltrum, powers kick in by the 18th birthday.

As Mark leaves, he sees Omni-Man fly off overhead. He tries to fly but fails, as a passing postman stares.

At school, Mark and his friend William Clockwell talk about the Twins' attack. Mark defends Omni-Man, who is considered ""the underdog"". A bully down the hall, Todd, is harassing another student, Amber Bennett. Mark insists on getting involved, and tells Todd to back off. Todd beats him, and Amber kicks Todd in the groin. The bully runs off, and Amber thanks Mark for trying to help her.

That night at Mark's job at BurgerMart, he's hauling out garbage. He tosses one bag in, but it flies off into the sky from his over-powered throw. Mark realizes that his powers have manifested.

Later, Mark goes home for dinner and Nolan arrives. Mark tells them that he's getting his powers, and Debbie kicks Nolan under the table until he expresses some enthusiasm. Nolan tells Mark that he'll start training him in the morning.

That night, Mark tries to sleep but can't. He remembers when he was young, and Nolan told him that he really comes from Viltrum, an alien planet. Viltrumites possess super-strength and speed. When they come of age, they venture out into the galaxy to help less-advanced races. Nolan relocated to Earth to be its soul protector, met Debbie, and they eventually married and had Mark, who is half-Viltrumite.

In the past, Nolan explains the changes Mark will go through when he hits puberty, including getting powers.

In the present, Mark remembers Nolan telling him that he's going to be able to fly. He gets out the window onto the roof, braces himself, and jumps off. Mark hovers in mid-air,, then flies off into the sky. An airliner almost hits him and Mark flies out of Earth's atmosphere, passes out from lack of oxygen, and falls back to earth. He wakes up just as he crashed into the street in front of his house.

The next morning, an exhausted Mark wakes up at 6 am. Omni-Man comes in and gets Mark, and they fly up into the sky. Mark's father explains about Mark has to focus on flying since he's a novice, and leads him away. Omni-Man notes that Mark is better at flying than he should be, and wonders if he's been doing late-night practice. He has Mark land, but Mark can't slow down and crashes into the earth. Omni-Man then trains Mark in how to fight, and continues giving his son tips. He punches Mark in the chest, knocking him to the ground, and apologizes for hitting him harder than he intended. Omni-Man tells Mark that if he wants to be a superhero, he needs to be prepared for anything.

Mark and Nolan return home, and Mark goes up to his room. Nolan tells Debbie that he pushed Mark far and it's what Mark needs, and snaps at Debbie when she questions him. Debbie asks Nolan what's gotten into him, and Nolan apologizes and says that Mark getting his powers so late changes things. He wonders if their lives would have been better if Mark hadn't gotten powers at all.

The next day at school, William notes that Mark isn't very talkative. Todd comes up, grabs Mark, and slams him into a locker. Mark invites Todd to hit him, and when Todd does so, Mark shrugs him off and tells Todd to hit him again and again. Todd does so and Mark doesn't flinch, and Toss calls him a freak and walks off. Mark tells William that he needs something to punch.

Later, Mark makes an improvised mask and flies through the nearby city, and hears gunfire. Titan, a stone-skinned villain, and two robbers are running from the guards. As Titan grabs his two associates and jumps over a gate, Mark flies up and slams Titan back. Mark hasn't come up with a superhero a name yet, and Titan beats him. Mark finally slams Titan down the alleyway and knocks Titan out, so Titan drops his armored skin.

Omni-Man flies up and tells Mark that he looks ridiculous, and suggests they get out of there. They fly to a rooftop and Omni-Man points out that Mark did a lot of damage, and he's not ready to be a superhero. Mark tells his father to hit him now that he's ready for it, and when Omni-Man refuses, Mark tells him to let him prove he can take the pain and is ready to be a superhero. The teenager tells Omni-Man that he wants to do what he does, and Omni-Man hugs him and assures him that he will be.

The superhero flies off, telling Mark to follow him. Omni-Man flies his son to the basement of a tailor shop at a mall, where Art Rosebaum is working. Art tells Mark that he secretly makes supersuits, and Mark says that he wants something ""iconic"". The tailor asks what name Mark has decided on, and tells Mark to think about it and get back to him.

That night at home, Debbie goes outside and finds Mark crashing into the earth. He explains that he was practicing his landings, and Debbie tells him that he needs to sleep. Debbie orders Mark inside and he tells her to make him. His mother asks if his being strong is important, and Mark says that it's important. Debbie tells Mark that she's there for him if he needs to talk, and figures that she's boring and Nolan isn't. Mark worries that he's nothing special, more like Debbie than Nolan, and wonders how he can live up to Omni-Man. Debbie tells her son that he just needs to be the greatest him, not the greatest Omni-Man, and assures him that the greatest Mark is enough.

The next day, Mark and Nolan float in the sky and play catch. Nolan wonders why Mark seems distracted, and Mark finally tells his father that he's scared that he can't handle superheroing. His father throws a ball around the globe, and Mark catches it. Nolan explains that along the path of being a superhero, Mark might have to do things he doesn't want to do or think he can't do, and it's okay to be scared. Nolan tells his son that he has to push through his doubts, and if he can then he'll be fine.

Mark says that he can do that, and tosses the ball around the planet to his father. Nolan tells Mark that he is invincible. Getting an idea, Mark goes to Art and tells him his new superhero name.

Debbie wakes up in her bed, alone, gets up, and goes to get breakfast. As she eats and prepares for her day, Mark comes downstairs and asks what's wrong. Debbie says that she's just missing Nolan, who didn't come home the previous night. As Debbie leaves, she finds two GDA agents at her doorstep. They take her and Mark to the GDA base at the Pentagon, and Donald assures them that Omni-Man is getting the best care. He explains that the GDA works secretly with superheroes to keep the world safe.

Donald takes Mark and Debbie to Omni-Man's room, where the hero is unconscious. He says that they're doctors are doing their best, and Cecil steps out of the shadows and says that they'll find out who did it and will make sure they suffer. Cecil introduces himself and says that someone murdered the Guardians, and figured that Omni-Man was lured there and tried to kill him with Guardians. He wanted Debbie to know before the public found out, and Debbie insists on staying there and taking care of Nolan.

Getting a report on his comm, Donald tells Cecil that there's a large attack occurring downtown. Mark briefly takes his father's hand and then flies downtown as Invincible. Alien Flaxans are invading through a teleportation portal, and killing civilians and police alike. The police weapons are useless, and a blast sends Invincible flying as he intervenes.

Invincible knocks the Flaxan leader away from an injured civilian woman and flies her away. The Flaxans open fire, further injuring the woman and knocking Invincible into a blast crater. Meanwhile, the injured Flaxan leader commandeers an attack vehicle and opens fire on Invincible. Atom Eve flies down and shields Invincible, and the other members of Teen Team--Dupli-Kate, Rex Splode, and Robot--join her. The teen heroes battle the Flaxan soldiers, and Atom Eve tells Invincible to get the woman to a hospital.

Invincible recognizes Atom Eve and flies off with the unconscious woman. Robot warns that they may be outnumbered, and the Leader brings up his attack vehicle and prepares to fire.

The next day at school, a distracted Mark walks through the hallways, bumping into student without noticing. Will finally gets his friend's attention, and Mark tells Will that his father got attacked. His friend says that he's there for Mark, and Mark notices popular girl Eve Wilkins and tells Will that he needs to talk to her. Mark goes over and introduces himself, and thanks her for saving him at Atom Eve. She realizes that Mark is Invincible, and asks if Mark wants to talk about the invasion.

As Mark and Eve walk off, two girls talk about how Todd freaked out after Mark let him hit him. Amber overhears them and the girls say that Amber is the reason Todd beat Mark up.

Eve and Mark sit out by the school stadium and talk about their superhero lives. She says that Invincible didn't do bad for a rookie, and that people escaped because of Mark. Eve assures Mark that he'll get used to the fighting, and that it's not how it looks like on TV. She invites him to come and meet Teen Team after school, and Mark jokingly agrees.

Cecil meets with Robot and tells him that the Teen Team did good. Robot identifies the Flaxans and figures that the aliens come from a place where time runs faster. Cecil asks how Invincible did, and Robot tells the director Just missing your dad. He didn't come home last night that he has promise. The director figures that Invincible better toughen up, and uses his teleportation belt to go to the Guardians' base.

Donald tells Cecil that whoever attacked the team cut the security cameras. Cecil orders the techs outa, and detective demon Damien Darkblood reveals himself, examining the bloodstains. Damien gets psychic impressions of the Guardians dying but not who attacked them, and Cecil agrees to let him help find the killer.

At school, Amber approaches Mark at his locker and says she heard Mark took a few punches from Todd for her. Mark dismisses it and meets with Eve. The two of them walk off as Amber watches.

Once they're away from the school, Atom Eve leads Invincible through the city. Invincible loses control, crashes, and hangs onto the edge of a rooftop. Invincible pulls himself up and follows Atom Eve again, and she takes him to the Team's secret base. Atom Eve and Rex kiss, and Rex sarcastically thanks Invincible for his ""help"" at the invasion.

Robot tells the other heroes what he's learned about the Flaxans' temporal rate, and he's created a detector to tell them when the aliens return. The robot asks Invincible if they can count on him in the future, and Invincible immediately agrees.

Later at the hospital, Mark tells the unconscious Nolan that the Teen Team was cool, except Rex. When Mark mentions Eve, Debbie comes in and Mark says that Eve is just a friend. She asks how Mark is doing, and Mark says that fighting aliens wasn't what he thought. Debbie says that they can talk.

Mark goes to check on the woman he rescued, Maya, and the doctor tells Mark that it's too soon to tell if she'll be okay.

At the Teen Team base, Rex notices the early-warning system beeping.

At school, Mark tells Will that he and Eve are just friends. Will says that Mark has a chance of dating Eve, and tells Mark that he should take Rex's place. Mark sees Eve and excuses himself, and Amber sits with Will and asks if Mark is dating anyone. Will tells her that Mark isn't, and that Eve has a boyfriend. He offers Amber Mark's phone number.

Invincible and Atom Eve fly to the TT base, and Rex is jealous when he sees them together. The Flaxans are below on the street, coming through a portal. The Leader tells his men to open fire and they do on the civilians. Robot realizes that the Flaxans have discovered a way to resist Earth's timestream,.

As Invincible and Atom Eve fly down, the Flaxans open fire on them. When Rex and Dupli-Kate attack them, the soldiers kill several of Dupli-Kate's clones and repel Rex's explosive spheres. When Robot flies down on the team hovercycle, the Flaxans fire an EMP device that shorts out Robot. Atom Eve shields the civilians and attacks the Flaxans. They fire drones at her that overwhelm her and concentrate their fire on Invincible, then trap him with adhesive guns.

The Leader prepares to kill Eve, and an enraged Invincible breaks free and knocks the Leader down, then beats him. He flies to Atom Eve and pulls off the drone that has attached herself to her face, and the Leader's protective wristband shorts out and he starts to age. Robot senses it happening and tells the others to destroy the soldiers' wristbands.

The heroes do so, and Robot analyzes a wristband and determines the counter frequency. He projects it, cancelling out the other wristbands, and the Flaxans start aging rapidly. They retreat through their portal and it disappears, and even Rex admits that Invincible was impressive. Invincible gets a call and tells the others that he has to go,

At the GDA base, Mark arrives at Nolan's room and discovers that his father is awake. He hugs Nolan, and Debbie says that her husband is okay enough to come home. Nolan has Mark tell him everything that has happened.

As the family leaves, Mark learns that Maya died. Nolan casually tells him that it's part of the job, and tells the nurse to get him his costume back.

People start to notice that the Guardians are gone.

Nolan and Mark continue sparring, and Cecil arrives to tell them that Allen the Alien is approaching Earth. Despite Cecil's reluctance to ask him, Nolan says that he'll stop him. When Debbie protests, Mark says that he'll go. Nolan agrees, figuring Mark can take Allen, and assures his son that he doesn't need to breathe in space.

Invincible flies into space, and Allen attacks him, mistaking him for Omni-Man. The hero tells Allen to stay away from his planet and fights back, and Invincible slams his opponent into the Moon.

The hero finally says that he just wants to talk, and Allen grants him a ""time out"". The alien sets up improvised chairs and explains that he's an evaluation officer for the Coalition of Planets. He comes by less-developed planets from time to time to make sure there's someone capable of defending them against monsters. Allen explains that ""Urath"" signed up for the plan, and Invincible explains that it's Earth, not Urath. The alien figures that he's in trouble, shakes hands with Invincible, and leaves.

Before Cecil goes, he has Nolan go over one more time what happened. Nolan claims that he got a distress call from the Guardians, and when he got to the base the lights went out and someone attacked him, and then he passed out. Debbie asks Cecil if he has any leads, and as he leaves Cecil says that people always think they're smarter than the GDA... at first.

The Flaxans launch another attack.

At school, Todd grabs Mark and whispers that he's sorry he beat him. He tells Mark that Amber wants to give Mark her phone number, and whispers an explanation that Amber found some old photos of him and promises to delete them if Todd delivered her message. Eve calls Mark to tell him about the invasion.

The Flaxans attack from multiple portals, and the power-suited Leader crushes civilians beneath his feet. As the TT arrives, Robot analyzes the Flaxan weapons and tells the others that there are too many Flaxans, they've improved their weaponry, and have rendered themselves immune to Earth's timestream. He wants to tell Cecil to consider a nuclear response, and Invincible objects. Atom Eve agrees and the heroes leap into action.

The Leader grabs Invincible and throws him away, and jumps on him and continues beating him. The Flaxans overwhelm the rest of the team, and Omni-Man arrives, grabs the Leader, pulls him off Invincible, and lifts him into the air.

The Flaxan weaponry is useless against Omni-Man, and he smashes through them. They retreat through their portals, against the Leader's orders, and Omni-Man grabs the Leader and flies through the last portal. Invincible yells ""Dad!"" and the other heroes realize that Invincible is Omni-Man's son.

Later, Mark returns home and tells Debbie that Omni-Man saved them from the Flaxans but went into one of their portals. She dismisses Omni-Man fighting aliens in another dimension as just another Tuesday, and figures that he's explaining nicely why they should leave Earth alone.

On the Flaxan home world, Omni-Man tells the aliens that Earth isn't theirs to conquer. He then kills the Leader, smashes through the buildings, killing thousands, and destroys the civilization. Returning home, Omni-Man tells his family that he needs a shower. The news reports that the Guardians are dead.

At the GDA, Damien meets with Cecil and Donald, and tells them that only the Guardians and Omni-Man were at the scene of the murders. Which means that the killer was one of them. Cecil tells Damien not to tell anyone his theories. Disgusted, Damien leaves and Cecil tells Donald to put a surveillance team on the Graysons if the killer decides to finish the job."

Rex says that the clones aren't the real Kate, and they get offended since it's not true and leave.

Later at the Pentagon, Invincible attends Robot's tryouts for the new Guardians, but says that he isn't trying out because Omni-Man wants to train Mark himself. Robot says that Invincible underestimates himself, and Invincible says that he'll still be around helping.

Robot thanks everyone for coming, and Burly auditions by fighting Atom Eve. Eve angrily defeats him, and Shrinking Rae defeats her opponent, by getting inside his inner ear and disrupting it. Black Samson defeats her opponent and then helps her up, displaying the strength of his character and spirit.

When the tryouts are over, Robot introduces the new Guardians, including Samson, Rae, and Monster Girl. Monster Girl is a 14-year old girl, but when Rex teases her she transforms into a green-skinned monster and beats him senseless. Invincible intervenes, but Rex doesn't thank him it. Monster Girl reverts to her 14-yearr-old base form, and apologizes because she loses control when someone teases her about being a kid.

Robot finishes by introducing Atom Eve as their final member, and thanks the other heroes for coming. Eve tells Robot that she can't be on the same team as Rex and Kate and walks off, and Invincible wonders why. Rex leaves without explaining.

Invincible flies after Atom Eve and asks what's going on, and Atom Eve tells him that Rex cheated on her with Kate. She says that Rex told Kate that Rex said that Eve and Invincible were dating, and Invincible points out that Rex is an asshole. Atom Eve says that Rex wasn't always, and the two fly off.

Robot meets with others and says that they'll be training there until the forensic investigation is complete, and then they'll move into the Guardians' HQ. Rex says that he isn't coming to 6 am training like Robot has planned, and isn't impressed when Black Samson says he was with the Guardians since the beginning. Rex points out that Black Samson lost his powers and got kicked off the team. Black Samson tells Rex that he'll assume it's a joke, so he won't beat him, and then tells Robot that they need a human leader.

Black Samson points out that he should be in charge because he's the most experienced, and when Rex objects Rae says that she thought the team counted on teamwork. She tells them to call her when they figure it out and leaves, and everyone else walks out on Robot except Monster Girl. Monster Girl tells Robot that she can't do three combat exercises because when she transforms, the curse makes her younger. She's actually 24 years old, and three exercises are too much for her. Robot sympathizes with her for to be heard for the world to judge them by experiences.

Omni-Man secretly watches from the observation gallery, and dismisses the new Guardians as pathetic.

Will goes over Mark's room and gives him decorating tips to impress Amber. He knows what Amber is into and tells Mark, and Mark insists that it's just a study date. Will tells him that every date should feel like a first date. Amber arrives at the front door, and Mark tosses his garbage out the window and sends Will out the back way so Amber doesn't see him.

When Amber comes up and sees the books Mark gave him to show he was interested, he explains why they're there and Amber compliments him on his honesty. She talks with him about comics and borrows one of them to show that she's ""interested"". Mark get an unknown call that keeps calling, and finally turns off his phone. It rings again, and Amber goes to use the bathroom.

Once Amber is gone, Cecil teleports in and admits that he's been watching Mark, and that Mark can't have personal privacy if he wants to be a superhero. Mark says that he wants to be a hero, and Cecil tells him that a supervillain, Doc Seismic, is heading to Mt. Rushmore.

Cecil teleports out and Amber comes in, and Mark makes an excuse about helping Nolan's friend. Debbie comes in with snacks.

Invincible and Atom Eve head to Rushmore, and the GDA monitors them because Nolan is dealing with a Kaiju in Japan. Cecil explains that Doc has a pair of shockwave-generating gloves, and they give him a concussion and brain damage every time he uses them.

Doc is causing earthquakes, and crevasses that spew lava. He tells the tourists to bow to him, Invincible saves a group of Boy Scouts from the falling head of Lincoln, puts it back, and Doc blasts him. Atom Eve shields Invincible with an energy shield, and Doc flies away riding a shockwave and Atom Eve chases him. He stops, and Invincible throws a boulder at him. Doc shatters it with his wrist bracelets, then blasts the area.

More crevasses open up, revealing lava, and a family of three tourists start to fall in. Atom Eve stops them but then falls into another crevasse. Invincible rescues the family, and Atom Eve recovers and blasts Doc. His bracelets backfire from damage inflicted, knocking him into a crevasse. Atom Eve goes in after him, and Invincible flies in and finds Atom Eve holding onto Doc so he won't fall into the lava. Doc slips and falls, blasts Invincible away when the hero tries to rescue him, and seemingly fall into the lava as a boulder falls on him. The lava sprays up, and Atom Eve holds it back while Invincible fly them both out.

Invincible says that he has to go and flies home. Omni-Man is there and Invincible tells him that he left Amber in his room, and his father tells him that the tricky part is balancing his hero and his personal lives. Omni-Man reminds Invincible that he's a Viltrumite and they have responsibilities that normal humans don't. He advises Invincible to change out of his costume, and Mark goes into his room and apologizes to Amber for having to duck out.

Amber wonders why Mark agreed to hang out if he wasn't going to hang out, and Mark insists that he does want to. He wonders why Amber came when she didn't even know he existed until he stood up to Todd, and they both agree that Todd kicked Mark's ass. She says that Mark is the first guy who stood there and took punches for her, and wanted to know the kind of guy that would do that. Amber sits on the bed next to Mark and asks what they do now.

From the beach where Omni-Man defeated the kaiju, William calls Cecil and tells him that it's the first time he's seen Omni-Man on the ropes... and the kaiju might not be dead. Cecil tells William to save the kaiju's body.

Nolan offers Debbie a bit of the kaiju that stuck to his cape for dinner. He says that he'll call Cecil about putting GDA protection on the house, and she tells him that she sold a house earlier despite the fact there was a double homicide there.

At the Team Teen base, Atom Eve takes down her photos of her and Rex, then hears him on the roof setting off explosions as fireworks to get her attention, and flies up. Rex says that he doesn't want to screw up and she should know he doesn't mean to, and asks for a do-over. Atom Eve wishes him luck with the new team and flies off.

Atom Eve flies to Mark's house, peers in his bedroom window, and sees him and Amber making out on his bed. She turns away, smiles, says ""Good for you, Mark"", and leaves.

At a GDA prison, an intruder in the control room secretly releases the Mauler Brothers. The original them kills his guard and uses his handprint to open his cell door, then frees his clone brother after he admits that he's a clone. When the GDA soldiers arrive, the clone pulls loose a piece of wall plating TO protect them as they advance.

When the Brothers get close enough, the original fights the soldiers hand-to-hand. They run, and the intruder closes a blast door behind them. A ladder drops down, providing the Brothers with an escape route. The Brothers climb out to the desert above, and an automated turret opens fire on them. The clone uses the original clone as a shield against the gunfire, runs close to the turret, and destroys it.

The clone, insisting he's the original, runs off and a drone monitors him. Cecil comes in and asks the intruder--Robot-if he has the new Guardians ready. Robot says that the team still has work to do but he's confident in the progress they've made.

At the Grayson house, Debbie is working at her laptop on the kitchen table, alone, when Damien arrives as his presence shorts out her laptop. Damien points out that Omni-Man survived the massacre when the others didn't, and Debbie repeats Omni-Man's claim that he didn't see anything. Nolan comes in and turns on the lights, and asks Debbie if she's all right. Damien has disappeared, and Debbie says that she's fine and goes upstairs to bed. Nolan notices the temperature drop in the room that accompanies the demon PI."

The team leader, Bryant, arrives, and complains that they're going too slow. He shoves his way through the crowd to the door that his workers are opening, goes in, and makes his way to a sarcophagus containing what he call his Master, and whose symbol matches the tattoo on his hand.

Bryant touches his tattoo to the symbol on the sarcophagus, and it glows with a green light and the lid shatters open. The mummified figure within emerges, and Bryant screams for help. Outside, the workers realizing who Bryant is resurrecting and back away in terror, and a sandstorm sweeps across the site. The green glowing Bryant appears in the tomb entrance, and the door slams down.

Omni-Man takes Invincible practice flying above the desert, and ends by having his son race to Mt. Everest. A climber reaches the point where they're standing. Once he climbs back down, Omni-Man admires the view. Invincible asks his father about Viltrumite, and Omni-Man says that the Viltrumites have ended wars all over the universe and brought peace. It's why Omni-Man is on Earth, and why Invincible is there.

When Invincible wonders why Omni-Man gave up his home planet to live on Earth, Omni-Man explains that when Invincible's grandparents died, he came to Earth to seek out something new. Debbie made Earth feel like a home to Omni-Man, and Invincible's birth changed things further. He tells Invincible that keeping the universe save and living up to their home world's heritage takes sacrifice. Invincible says that he gets that, and they race home.

Debbie visits Olga at her home, and she and Olga Debbie talk about the GDA is pursuing its own objectives and how it doesn't care about them. Olga figures that Cecil knows who killed the Guardians, but doesn't care. She says that she's moving back to Moscow and her family, and wants Debbie to help sell her house. Debbie agrees, and asks Olga if Josef ever lied to her. Olga admits that Josef did, and says that all heroes do. She only made the mistake of believing him once, when he said that everything was going to be fine.

Debbie drives home, pours herself some wine, and goes to work on her laptop selling Olga's house. She does a private search on Damien's background, and how he's the only one who has shed light on the truth. Omni-Man and Invincible come in, and Debbie clears her screen. Omni-Man tells her that their son has a hot date, and Mark insists that he and Amber are just hanging out. His parents gently mock Mark, and after Mark goes upstairs to shower, Omni-Arm suggests to his wife that they go out. Debbie says that Olga wants to sell her house and thinks there's a conspiracy around the murders, and Omni-Man dismisses it as Olga's drinking.

Amber takes Mark to a Filipino street fair and talks about her experiences in the Philippines, and asks Mark if he's done any travelling. Mark vaguely says that he's been to Mt. Everest, and then deflects Amber's questions about how he got there. He buys Amber something he can afford: a rice separator.

In his office, Damien drinks. Nolan comes in and accuses Damien of being in his house and frightening Debbie. Damien accuses him of murdering the Guardians, and Nolan suggests that Damien is the killer. Nolan tells Damien not to scare his family again, and figures people will believe him rather than a demon. As Nolan leaves, Damien tells him that he won't give up and the truth can't be hidden. The PI says that Debbie already suspects, and wonders when Mark will as well. Nolan curses and flies out.

The Mauler original takes supplies to an empty warehouse that he uses as a base, sets up his equipment, takes a DNA sample of himself using a drill, and makes a new clone of himself.

The new Guardians move into the old Guardians' base. Cecil teleports in to join them, and reminds them that they're heroes, not tourists. Rex points a splash of blood on the wall from the murdered Guardians, and Cecil says that he left it there as a reminder. When the heroes proves themselves worthy of being the Guardians, the stain will be cleaned off. Cecil gets a message via his comm, tells the heroes to settle in, and teleports back to the GDA.

Monster Girl asks Rex if they're cool, and points that out that he asked for the beating he gave her. He chuckles and admits that he did, and they both agree that the other heroes were assholes. Robot asks Rex not to let his personal and professional lives to intersect, and notes that Atom Eve leaving was the result of Rex's lapse in judgment. The mechanical man slaps Rex on the shoulder, and secretly takes a blood sample.

Nolan returns home and tells Debbie that he was ""reaching someone a lesson"". He suggests that they go to bed, and Debbie shrugs away from him. Nolan asks what's going on, and Debbie claims that she's distracted by work stuff. Nolan tells her that she's the wife of the most powerful man on Earth and shouldn't have to deal with work stuff, and Debbie angrily tells him she loves work stuff.

After shushing Debbie, Nolan grabs Cecil from the shadows where the man is hiding and slams him into the wall. He finally lets him go, saying that he didn't mean to teleport into the house, and Nolan admits that he's a little jumpy. Debbie asks why Cecil is there

Mark returns Amber to her home, and she tells him to plan their next date. They kiss and Amber goes inside, and he flies off and does flips in celebration. Mark returns home and finds his parents talking with Cecil. Cecil says that he needs Nolan to shadow the first manner mission to Mars, but Nolan won't do it. Nolan says that with the Guardians gone, he's needed on Earth. Cecil says that the planet needs a win after the Guardian massacre, and the mission is it.

Nolan says that his priority is to the family and Earth, and Mark volunteers. His father says that Mark's responsibilities are bigger than four astronauts, and Cecil didn't ask Mark to go. When Mark learns that it's a two-week mission, he hastily says that he's not ready and things with Amber are going well. Debbie tells Mark that it's up to Mark to make decisions about how he uses his powers. After a moment, Mark says that he'll do it.

Cecil teleports to the surveillance house across the street, and Donald points out that they wanted Nolan off-planet so they could investigate the Guardians' murders without raising his suspicions. Cecil figures the assignment will let them see what Mark can do, and if his heart is in the right place.

The next day at school, Mark tells Eve that he doesn't want to lie to Amber, but he can't tell her the truth. Eve says that dating regular people is a pain in the ass, and Mark points out that Eve dating Rex didn't work out. Eve says that she can't help Mark because she has her own crap to deal with, and Mark asks her to help him with his Amber stuff in return for him helping her with her Rex stuff. Eve says that she has more with that, and doesn't know what to do with her future. Mark tells her that he's there for her... after he gets back from Mars. Eve tells him that if Mark is going to tell Amber the truth, he'd better be serious about her. She asks Mark if he is serious about Amber.

Amber is at home watching a newscast about the mission launch, and Mark arrives at her doorstep with a baul that he bought for her at the street fair. He then tells Amber that he's volunteer and going away for two weeks, but doesn't give her details. Mark says that he volunteered last-minute, and asks her not to lose interest in him. She agrees to give Mark two weeks, and he leaves as the newscast shows the Mars ship taking off.

Invincible dons an air pack and flies after the spaceship, and takes a picture of Earth from space. Cecil talks to him via the comms and tells Invincible that he should stay out of sight unless something goes wrong, and Invincible is there to deal with the Martians. The GDA knows that the Martians live underground and keep to themselves, and they shouldn't have any trouble with them. Cecil tells Invincible that he should make sure the astronauts get home safe, and that humanity is counting on Invincible.

Debbie and Nolan are at home, watching the mission on TV. Nolan says that the mission is a waste of Mark's time, and Debbie tells her husband that it was Mark's decision and she's proud of him. Debbie tells her husband that he's been different since Mark got his powers, and Nolan insists that he's trying to teach their so. He defends himself, saying that he's been under a lot of stress, and Debbie points out that she's never met another Viltrumite. Debbie says that Nolan is hiding something from her, and it hurts.

Nolan says that he's terrified that he could lose everything, and Debbie admits that she does. He suggests that they go on a trip while Mark is gone, and kisses his wife.

Mark sits on the ship as it heads to Mars.

Nolan and Debbie go to Pisa, and Nolan says that he's made reservations at the café where they ate the last time they were there.

The shuttle lands on Mars, and Invincible flies ahead then hides so the four astronauts don't see him. They take samples, and a bored Invincible looks at photos of Amber and him on his camera. Invincible finally looks down and discovers that the astronauts are gone, and sees a drag trail leading away.

Sitting down, Debbie and Nolan have coffee and Nolan says that Debbie dumped him 20 years ago when they were last there. She says that she did it because Nolan was a dick, and he expected her to worship him because he flew her to Rome. Debbie tells her husband that he only got a second date because she saw him save some kids on the news, and says that she's glad they came. Nolan figures that she still thinks something is wrong, and Debbie says that she feels like she's standing on the edge of a cliff and doesn't know why.

Nolan tells Debbie that he hasn't been honest with her about the murders, and says that Cecil thinks he had something to do with them. He warns that Cecil doesn't like him and things could get bad, and says that they should deal with it by staying together as a family. Nolan tells Debbie that all she has to do is trust her, just as a dragon goes on a rampage across the city.

As everyone else runs, Nolan calmly asks Debbie if she trust him. She says that she does and tells Nolan to do something. Nolan says that he's on vacation and Cecil can earn his paycheck. Fighters attack the dragon,

Damien enters the Grayson home, searches the place, and finds Cecil waiting for him. GDA soldiers uncloak, aiming their guns at Damien, and Cecil tells the demon that Nolan warned them about Damien.

Invincible flies, following the drag trail, and finds that they end at a bare spot. Landing, Invincible examines the area and a sand storm sweeps over him. He finds a hatch and opens it, and small squid-like Sequids jump on him and pull him down. Invincible throws them off and goes down the hatch.

Beneath the hatch are tunnels, filled with more Sequids hanging to the walls. The Martians, similar to Martian Man, surround Invincible and aim their spears at him, and tell him not to move. Their leader asks Invincible if the astronauts are like him, and they take him to a throne room. The Martian ruler greets Invincible, and asks why he's there.

Invincible explains that he's there to protect the astronauts, who are standing nearby. The astronauts say that they have no idea who Invincible, and he sucks at his ""secret mission"". The ruler explains that the Sequids have spread across the galaxy, and when they bond with a host they become almost unstoppable. The Martians' shapeshifting abilities give them immunity, but if a Sequids merges with a human, they can rise up as one and savage Mars and then Earth.

Invincible explains that he's part-Viltrumite, and the ruler has heard of the Viltrumites. He tells that the humans are sentenced to immediate execution because they had contact with Sequids, and the Martians can't risk them being possessed.

Nodding, Invincible says that he understands... and then escapes with the astronauts. They run back to their shuttle, the mounted Martians following and shooting blasters at them. Invincible finally picks the astronauts up and flies them the rest of the way, and they prepare for emergency launch. Meanwhile, Invincible attacks the Martians but is soon outnumbered and blasted back to the shuttle. He lifts the shuttle up and the astronauts fly it the rest of the way into space. Invincible flies back, gets a rock as a souvenir, and reunited with the main craft out in space.

On the shuttle, we see that an unknown Martian shapeshifter is posing as an astronaut. Back on Mars, the original astronaut, now infected with a Sequid, unleashes a wave of Sequids on the Martian warriors.

The astronauts return to earth, and Invincible returns home and hears sounds of a fight inside. He finds Nolan and Debbie sitting on the couch, figures his parents were having sex, and goes to his room while Debbie chuckles.

The next day at school, Mark goes to Amber's locker. She kisses him in greeting and asks how his trip was, and Mark says that it was boring but he did help people. Mark shows Amber the rock he picked up, says it's an ""Earth rock"", and tells Amber not to show it to any geologist or anyone else. Amber thanks him for the regular ""Earth rock"" and kisses him again.

At the GDA HQ, Cecil and his soldiers escort Damien in. Cecil says that they found dried blood belonging to the Guardians, and Damien insists that it was planted by Nolan to frame him. Nolan tells Damien that he knows, leads Damien into an exorcism circle, and reveals that he has the necessary book recreated that Damien destroyed centuries ago.

Donald is there and casts the spell, and Cecil says that he needs to keep things grew until he can figure out why Nolan killed the Guardians. Cecil rings the bell completing the ritual, and Damien is sent back to Hell.

Debbie cleans up Olga's house then shows it to a couple. The couple says that they want it, and Debbie tells them that she'll start the paperwork.

Robot goes to a hidden clone chamber and inserts Rex's blood sample into the twisted clone inside. The creature says that finally phase 1 begins.

Back at home, Debbie tells Nolan that she sold Olga's house. Nolan tells her that Cecil called him and said that new evidence came up, and Nolan is in the clear. He assures Debbie that everything is fine... both unaware that Damien hid a satchel in Debbie's closet."

Titan picks up a nearby forklift and throws it the men, who scatter. One man grabs a heavy gun and opens fire, and Titan takes a discarded pistol and throws it into the man's head. One man is pinned beneath the thrown forklift, and watches as Titan takes out some of the others and the survivors run. Titan grabs the pinned man, frees him, and tells him to tell Mr. Lu that the next time he finds any of Lu's men on his turf, he won't be so gentle. The intruder then snaps the man's neck and tells the kid pointing a shotgun at him the message was for him. The kid shoots Titan in his face, temporarily destroying his armor on his face. It regenerates, and Titan tells the kid to go. Once the kid runs, Titan looks at his torn pants and swears.

The next day, Kill Cannon is on the streets shooting at Invincible. Invincible beats Kill Cannon unconscious and later at school, kids watch the battle on phone video. Mark arrives to see Amber, who walks away because he's late. Mark has brought her Japanese cheesecake in way of an apology, and she points out that it's crazy for him to be late to get cheesecake to apologize for being late.

Across town, Titan emerges from a burning building with a can of gasoline. He tosses it back in and it explodes. As Titan starts to walk away, one of the residents who got out asks him what they ever did to him. Titan walks back to the man, Kevin, and gives him and the other residents money to move into a hotel until they can find homes.

Invincible continues fighting villains as the people cheer him. He goes to hold up a building that was damaged in the fight, and is late to his job at the Burger Mart. Mark's boss, Mr. Sayre, tells Mark that he's been late 12 times in the past three months, and says that he's going to dock Mark's pay.

Invincible texts Amber that he can't make it for their date. She texts back that he's treading on dangerous ground standing her up, and he goes back to his fighting.

Titan goes to crime boss Machine Head and gives him the chip, and Machine Head inserts it into a slot on his head. He moans in ecstasy, and Titan says that it's the last and he's done. Machine Head tells him it isn't, and that Titan's problem is that he's too useful to be let go. As Machine Head's henchman Isotope looks on, Machine Head tells Titan that Titan needs the money and can't live a normal life, and he's a headbreaker. When Titan threatens him, Machine Head says that he knows where Titan's family lives so Titan works for him. Titan smashes Machine Head's desk in frustration, and Machine head tells him that he's never letting Titan go.

In space, Invincible tries to hold back an asteroid heading toward Earth. Omni-Man is calmly waiting, and when Invincible stops it, his father tells him to throw the asteroid back into space. Invincible does so, and Omni-Man tells him that it was a small one. The younger hero gets a text and tells Omni-Man that he has to go, and his father tells him that his training is more important. Omni-Man finally lets invincible go, and his son hugs him and flies off.

Mark arrives at Amber's house for dinner with her parents, apologizes for running late, and offers dessert. Amber walks off in frustration. They study in Amber's room, and she complains that Mark was two hours late as he eats leftovers. She asks Mark if she's important to him, and when he says that she is. Amber points out that when they make plans, Mark is late or doesn't show up and his excuses suck. Mark says that he has family responsibilities and it's hard making it fit, and Amber tells him to make the choice and she's not going down the road.

Mark tells Amber that he's going to do better, and Amber tells him to prove it. As Mark walks home, he kicks a rock in frustration and it goes through a house and into orbit. Nolan calls and tells him that a super-villain is robbing a store and he'd be good practice for Invincible. Mark tells his father that he's not in the mood, but reluctantly agrees.

Titan, in his unarmored form, goes into a fancy apartment in a rundown tenement, and gives the young girl sitting on the couch the ice cream that he brought. She greets him as ""Daddy"", and Titan's wife comes out and figures that they're not out. Titan tells his wife Vanessa that is isn't that simple, but Vanessa doesn't want to hear it and walks away.

Titan goes out on his fire escape and drinks, and his daughter Fiona comes out to sit with him. She points out Invincible overhead, flying his opponent Elephant to prison, and asks Titan if he's a good guy like Invincible. Titan doesn't have an answer for her.

Debbie goes to her closet, feels a chill, and finds the journal that Damien left hidden there. She looks at it and remembers what Damien said about being the only survivor of the Guardian massacre. Nolan comes in and Debbie hides the journal behind her back. Once Nolan leaves, Debbie locks herself in the bathroom and reads the journal. She finds a note saying ""Costume"" and remembers Nolan asking for his bloodstained costume back, at the hospital.

Eve tells her parents that she doesn't need to tell them when she breaks up with someone, and her father says that he only agreed to Eve being a superhero is because Rex was there to take care of her. His daughter says that she can take care of herself, and points out that Rex cheated on her. Her father tells eve to forgive Rex, saying that all guys make mistakes. Eve breaks into tears, and her father tells her that she can't be a superhero on her own and shouldn't be doing it at all.

Turning on her father, Eve tells him that for one thing she can do anything she wants and demonstrated her power. For another, Eve says that she's not sure that she wants to do it anymore. Her father says that it's about time, and Eve flies out and off.

The next day, Invincible is out flying in the clouds and salutes the passengers inside of a passing airliner. He notices his hero name written on a rooftop in the city, flies down, and finds Titan waiting for him. Titan tells Invincible that he got lucky when they fought a few months ago, but he's not there to fight now. He explains that he owes money and can't get out, and isn't a criminal. Titan wants Invincible to help him take down Machine Head.

Invincible has never heard of Machine Head, and Titan explains that Machine Head runs the city. When Invincible suggests that Titan call Fight Force, Titan tells him that he's just flying off and forgetting the ""little people'. Invincible picks up Titan, who shows invincible Machine Head's operations. They spot Machine Head and Isotope leaving a club, and Isotope teleports them away.

Titan tells Invincible that if he helps him takes down Machine Head, he'll help real people with real lives. They land near the community center that Vanessa and Fiona are leaving, and Titan says that he didn't borrow money for him. He goes over to his family, and Fiona hugs him.

That night at home, Mark tells Nolan that he can't take Machine Head by himself while Isotope is helping him. The Graysons are eating dinner, and Debbie is distracted by Damien's journal. Nolan tells Mark that he's making a huge mistake helping Titan, and that Titan is using Mark. Mark insists that he can tell that Titan isn't lying, and that he never wanted to be a criminal in the first place. Nolan says that the whole thing is beneath Mark, and Debbie only says that sometimes people aren't who they appear to be. Nolan agrees with her, and Debbie also says that helping someone is never beneath Mark. Mark says that he'll sleep on it as his mother picks at her food.

Later at the New Guardians' base, the team return after fighting the Lizard League. Rex has brought in beer for his teammates to drink in celebration, and Black Samson uses sonics to shatter the others' bottles and says that two dozen civilians are in the hospital because they didn't fight like a team. Robot replays a video of the fight, and Samson shows where Rex and Monster Girl let a bus of civilians crash.

Rex angrily says that they did their best and won, and dismisses Samson's opinion since he has no innate powers. Dupli-Kate intervenes and tells Rex that Samson isn't wrong, and Rex and the others leave Samson and Robot alone.

At home, Debbie is doing the dishes and asks Nolan why he told Mark that saving lives is beneath him. Nolan says that Mark needs to think big, and Debbie isn't helping because she's not a superhero and doesn't understand the choices they have to make. Debbie reminds her husband that she's one who taught Nolan how to be a hero, and now Nolan thinks she can't do the same for Mark. Nolan says that isn't what he meant, and he thinks that Mark is putting his trust in someone he shouldn't. He tells Debbie that he doesn't want Mark to make a choice he'll regret, and Debbie agrees. The couple hold each other, and Nolan says that he didn't think it would be so difficult.

The next day at school, Mark tells eve that his superhero career is destroying his GPA. Eve snaps at him, and Mark asks if she's okay. She says that she doesn't know what she's doing at Atom Eve. Amber comes up and asks Mark if he's coming that night, and Mark says that he is. Irritably, Amber tells him not stand her up and tells Eve that Mark agreed to volunteer with her at the community center downtown. Mark realizes that it's the same community center he saw Titan's family at. As he leaves, claimed he said he'd help Debbie with an open house, Amber tells Eve that she no excuse not to come help. She then asks Eve if Mark has been acting weird lately. Eve assures Amber that Mark is into Amber, and Eve says that she'll be at the center to volunteer.

That night, Titan takes Invincible overlooking Machine Head's penthouse and details the crime boss' security precautions. Titan explains that he ""took care"" of Isotope by paying the woman he sees to keep him there extra long.

Invincible asks Titan about Fiona, and Titan says that the community center is his family's second home. After considering, Invincible says that he's in but he has to make it clear because he has plans later.

Mauler is dozing at his secret warehouse base, wakes up, and activates his new clone by placing his own memories in it. The ""brothers"" immediately start arguing about which is the original and which is the clone. Robot steps out of the shadows and wonders why Mauler creates a clone who thinks he's the original, and easily avoids the brothers' attack when they come at him.

Robot jumps onto the replication chamber, and one brother stops the other from attacking Robot and damaging the chamber. Robot says that he needs their expertise in tissue growth, shows them the vial with the sample, and says that he'll make it worth the brothers' time.

The next day, Debbie calls Nolan from her car and asks him to pick up a few things for dinner. She has him fly over the globe, having calculated how long it will take Nolan. Once Nolan flies off, Debbie starts a timer on her phone, and goes through her house. With three minutes left, Debbie finds Nolan's bloodstained costume where he hid it. Nolan returns and Debbie kicks the costume under a counter.

Titan and Invincible smash through the penthouse's bombproof windows, then break into Machine Head's office. The crime boss isn't impressed, and says that he knew when Titan would betray him. Isotope teleports in and Machine Head says that the chip Titan got for him lets him calculate quantum probabilities. Isotope teleports in several villains that Machine Head has hired: Battle Beast, Kursk, Furnace, Magmaniac, and Tether Tyrant.

Eve meets Amber at the center kitchen, and Amber shows her around. Amber says that Mark isn't there, and she's giving him 15 minutes.

Invincible and Titan fight Machine Head's hired villains, but are outnumbered. Omni-Man watches from above as Invincible gets repeatedly beaten, and Invincible loses his temper, rips free of the holds on him, and fights back until one of the villains, Battle Beast, slams him to the floor.

At the center, Eve and Amber look at the time as Mark doesn't show up. Amber checks her phone, and discovers that Mark hasn't reached out to her.

Battle Beast continues to beat Invincible, and the Guardians arrive in response to an anonymous call that Cecil got. The villains take down the Guardians, and Battle Beast complains that he was offered worthy opponents but he found none. Samson recovers but his suit malfunctions, and Battle Beast beats Invincible with his mace and licks his blood from his lips.

Samson jettisons his armor and attacks Beast, who easily breaks Samson's fist and slams him against the floor repeatedly. Monster Girl attacks next, and Beast easily beats him to a pulp. Robot fires an energy cannon at Beast, and the alien just chuckles as Rex, Dupli-Kate, and Shrinking Rae join Robot. The heroes say that the villains just messed up, and attack as a team, Beast says that the battle is beneath him and teleports away.

Robot cradles Monster Girl as she transforms back to her human form, and Machine Head discovers that Isotopes has fled, just before Rex knocks out the crime boss. Titan tells the barely conscious Invincible that he didn't mean for it to end the way it did but he has to take care of his own.

At the center, Amber and Eve serve food. Amber tells Eve that she thought Mark would be there.

A GDA squad arrive and tend to the fallen heroes. Cecil tells Donald to do whatever it takes to bring Invincible back, and get a sample to the lab. As the soldiers take Machine Head away, Cecil removes the chip from the crime boss's skull.

At the center, Eve gets a call. She then tells Amber that she has to go.

The medics take Samson away, while Robot tells the unconscious Monster Girl that he's there for her.

As Omni-Man flies back, Debbie gets off the phone. Crying, she turns to her husband.

Eve tells Amber that Mark loves Amber and he'd be there if he could. She then walks out.

A GDA helicopter takes the injured heroes away. Isotope teleports into the penthouse and tells his secret boss--Titan--that his plan worked. Vanessa and Fiona come in, and Fiona runs to her father. She asks if the penthouse is their new house, and Titan smiles.

At the GDA, Donald goes to a secret level. A scientist tells him that nothing they can throw at the Viltrumite cell samples can harm them. Donald figures that blood is still the answer, and the scientists should keep trying."

The male student, Doug Cheston, lunges out at them, drunk, and ""surprises"" them. Doug boasts that he's been drinking, and that his father owns Cheston Pharmaceutical and owns half the university. One of the women points out that Doug's father hiked up the cost of baby medicine, and Doug readily admits that his father did and that soon Doug is going to inherit his father's money.

Doug asks if they want to have sex with him and get in on the ""ground floor"" of his inheritance. Disgusted, the women walk off. Once they leave, a figure dressed all in black grabs Doug and injects him in the neck with a sedative.

Later, Doug wakes up strapped to a gurney. His captor, wearing goggles, tells Doug that he's going through a metamorphosis and will be better than before. Doug calls his captor a nerd, and the overhead light swings to reveal partially-cybernetic corpses strung up from the ceiling. Seeing them, Doug panics and looks down, and discovers that his right arm has been replaced with a replacement mechanical arm. His captor then cuts out Doug's vocal chords with a scalpel, and tells Doug that he'll be better than the prototypes.

Medics brings Invincible, Samson, and Monster Girl into the hospital, and on the OR table Monster Girl transforms into her monstrous form, goes berserk, and then passes out. Robot comes in and tells the doctors that he's familiar with Monster Girl's physiology, and they can have security remove him or they can save Monster Girl's life. The doctors let Robot stay, and he goes to the unconscious Monster Girl and tells her that he's there. Robot tells the doctors to begin an infusion of belladonna and wolfsbane.

Other doctors tend to Samson and try to shock his heart into working. Energy surges from Samson's body, and his heart starts.

Nolan and Debbie arrive and watch from the gallery as doctors operate on Invincible. Cecil and Donald join them, and Debbie and Nolan start arguing about their son. Later, Mark wakes up to find his parents at his bedside. They tell him that he's been out for six days, and Mark says that he was supposed to meet Amber. Eve comes in and says that she told Amber that Mark was hit by a bus. She says that Samson and Monster Girl are still unconscious, and Debbie tells her son that it isn't his fault.

Cecil watches through the observation window as Robot sits at Monster Girl's bedside. Nolan is with Cecil, and offers to take a swing at Damien if he hasn't said anything about the Guardians. Cecil refuses, and Nolan asks if Damien murdered the Guardians. The GDA director is more interested in why Damien would do it, and asks Nolan if Mark told him he was taking on Machine Head by himself. Nolan says that Mark told him he wasn't going off to the crime boss, and Nolan insists that children don't disobey their parents on Viltrum. Cecil tells Nolan that human kids do and walks away.

Mark visits Amber at her house, and he says that the hospital has rules about letting visitors in. Amber tells Mark that she had already dumped him the night he missed their ""date"" at the center. Mark admits that he messed up his first call to her, but Amber let him start over. He asks if they can do that again, and she finally agrees. They kiss and fall down on Amber's bed.

Later at school, Will tells Mark that he needs to watch traffic. Mark suggests that they catch a movie the next Friday because they haven't hung out in a while, and Will says that he's going to Upstate U for a tour, and his former boyfriend Rick Sheridan is there. Will is staying over, and he's going to check out their pre-med program. Mark tells Will that he wants to come and bring Amber, and Will considers.

Later in his room, Mark is packing when Atom Eve flies up to his window. Mark lets her in and thanks her for covering with him with Amber. Mark explains that he, Amber, and Will are going to Upstate for a tour, and invites Eve along. Eve says that she's skipping college, and just wants to help people directly instead of fighting super-villains.

Mark tells Atom Eve that he messed up, and Samson and Monster Girl almost died because of him. Because of that, he understands what Atom Eve is going through and maybe they both need a fresh start. Amber and Will arrive, and Atom Eve falls off.

The trio drive off in Will's car, and Will talks a lot about Rick. Back at the Grayson house, Debbie tells Nolan that she's going out. When he offers to go with her, Debbie reminds him that he said he had work to do on his book. Once Debbie leaves, Nolan gets his bloodstained costume from where he hid it.

The trio arrive at Upstate U, and Will insists that he's not in love with Rick despite talking about him non-stop. Rick greets them and hugs Will, and Rick takes them to his dorm room where he's putting them up.

Eve moves out despite her parents' protests, and tells her mother that she needs a fresh start. Her father Adam says that he isn't going to let her ruin her life on some ""find yourself bullshit"", and if she wants a fresh start she should stop being a superhero. Adam tells Eve that she can't save the world, and trying will get her killed. He says that the worst day of his life was when she got powers, and he wants a normal life for her. Eve tells Adam that that's what best for him, not her, and flies off.

Rick shows the trio around the dorm, and says that he's arranged a biology class sit-in for them. At the class, the professor talks about how they focus on quality of life. Student DA Sinclair speaks up, disagreeing, and Rick tells the others that Sinclair is there on a genius grant.

Sinclair rants about how human failings are engineering challenges, and they need to realize that humans are machines that need to be improved. Amber tells Sinclair that he's being a jerk, and he tells them that his problem is how the university is staffed by idiots. Sinclair tells Rick that he's impressive--a classic alpha male-and the professor tells Sinclair to leave and return when he's ready to learn. Sinclair tells Rick that he'll see him at exams and leaves, and the professor returns to his lecture.

Eve flies over the forest and uses his powers to make a treehouse when she finds a spot with a good view.

As the quarter check out the quad, Rick suggests that the two couple split up, and Will quickly agrees so he'll be alone with Rick. Amber and Mark go off, look around, order foot from a street cart vendor, and end up kissing. Later, they settle on a bench and watch people go by, and Mark tells Amber that he likes it there. He asks Amber what she thinks of them coming there together, and Amber tells Mark that he has to get his grades up. He says that he wants to be there with Amber, and Amber agrees.

As Will and Rick join Mark and Amber, there's an explosion in a nearby building. A cyborg Reaniman staggers out, clutching at his helmet and lunging at the pedestrians. Amber yells at everyone to get bac, and a couple trips. Amber goes to help them and calls for the others to help them, while the Reaniman throws a van. As Mark prepares to fight the Reaniman, Amber calls him over to help.

The Reaniman, formerly Doug, grabs Rick, and Will throws cans at the cyborg's head and yells at the Reaniman to get away from Rick. Doug jumps over and grabs Will by the throat, and Mark change into his Invincible costume and frees Will from Doug's grasp. As the two grapple, Will recognizes Mark despite his mask, and Invincible tells Will to run. Doug shoves Invincible's head into a decorative fountain basin, but Invincible eventually frees himself and slams Doug into the pavement.

Doug recovers and starts beating Invincible. Invincible manages to rip off Doug's helmet, and stagger off. The Reaniman goes after him, but sees the reflection of his face in the basin water and withdraws back in shock. He jumps on a decorative statue in the basin and impales himself,

Invincible goes over to Will, who shares at his friend in shock. He tells Will not to tell anyone his identity, then flies off as Amber and Rick come over. Rick hugs Will and thanks him for saving his life, and Will hugs him back. Mark runs up in his civilian clothes and says that the police are on the way, and Amber angrily asks where he went. Mark says that he ran for help, but Amber accuses him of being a coward. She says that she and Eve were wrong about Mark, breaks into tears, and walks off.

Sinclair comes up, picks up the Reaniman's discarded helmet, and says it's the last time he'll leave any of his subjects' frontal lobes intact. He studies Rick, and figures he'd make a suitable subject.

At her treehouse, Atom Eve brings up news photos of disasters and flies off to deal with one of them.

A badly damaged Robot drone staggers into the GDA room where the doctors are tending to the comatose Monster Girl. It holds out a single cerulean cosmos flower, and Robot takes it and explains the doctors that he sent a drone to the Arctic to get the flower. The flower contains a single molecule that adds 60% to Monster Girl's chance of survival. Robot gives it to the doctors and instructs them on how to extract the necessary compounds, then call Robot for isolation and purification.

Once the doctors leave, Robot sits at Monster Girl's beside. Samson is the next bed, and says that Robot really cares for Monster Girl. He wonders how a machine has emotions, and Robot says that he's programmed to care for all humans. Samson doesn't believe him and asks if they won, and Robot stares at him.

Debbie goes to Art, who is examining Omni-Man's bloodstained costume. He says that he's spent the analyzing it like she asked, and has confirmed it shows samples of various Guardians on it. Debbie suggests that maybe the Guardians attacked Omni-Man and he defended himself, but Art uses the oxidation patterns of the blood to confirm that Omni-Man struck first. She asks Art not to tell anyone, and he says he's too scared to tell anyone, while outside, Nolan hovers in the air and listens in.

Back in Rick's dorm room, Amber tells Mark that there's no way she's sharing a room with him and throws his pack at him before going into their room alone. Rick tells Mark that he can bunk with him and Will, and Rick goes to get some food. Amber goes to take a shower, and Will gushes over Mark being Invincible.

Atom Eve puts out a forest fire with her powers, regrows the destroyed trees, saves two hikers from an avalanche, and grows plants on a farm.

Robot visits the Maulers, who are growing a creature for him in a tank, and tells them that their progress is satisfactory. They ask who it's for and whose DNA did Robot steal, and Robot says that their work doesn't require answers to their questions. Robot tells them that they'll be paid when their work is complete, and the Maulers threaten to destroy the creature. Robot tells them that they'll get the schematics when their work is done, and the Maulers back down.

Once Robot leaves, the Maulers figure they need some ""insurance"" and one tells the other to grab a shovel.

Will continues to question Mark about Invincible, and points out that Mark never told him even though he's his best friend. Mark says that he doesn't even want to be Invincible anymore, and Will says that Mark is being a superhero is the coolest thing that's ever happened to him. Mark isn't sure that Amber will forgive him, and Will agrees. Will then jokingly says that Mark should take him flying or he'll tell everyone that Mark is Invincible. Mark flies Will out and back at superspeed, and Will asks to try on the costume.

As Amber returns from the shower, fraternity bro Kyle startles Amber from behind and gives her a flyer for his fraternity's party later that night. She takes the flyer.

Rick leaves a convenience store and Facetimes Will to ask if he should get some pizza. Rick's call cuts out in mid-conversation, and Will goes to tell Mark. Mark shows Will the flyer and says that Amber got invited to a party, and wonders if he should have gone after her. He'd rather go after Amber, and refuses to help Will, saying that whenever he tries to be a superhero he makes things worse. Mark tells Will to call him if he can't find Rick, but he has to go after Amber.

At the hospital, Samson dresses and tells Robot that he feels better than ever. Robot tells Samson to rejoin the team at Guardians HQ, while he'll remain there until Monster Girl recovers. Once Samson leaves, Monster Girl wakes up and is shocked to find Robot hovering over her. She apologizes for her reaction and Robot tells her that they won the battle., and assures her that her teammates are fine. When Robot says that he stayed with her through her recovery, Monster Girl is surprised and touched.

He gets up to go, offers Art a last beer, and says that he just wanted to make sure their ""partnership"" was still strong.

Mark goes into the party, looking for Amber. He sees her out on the balcony talking to Kyle, and he mentions that his girlfriend is transferring there next semester. Kyle asks Amber if she's seeing anyone, and Amber says that she was. Meanwhile, Will calls Mark and on a staticky call, tells Mark that he's in trouble. The line goes dead, and Mark leaves.

One of the REANIMAN carries Will to Sinclair's hidden lair, puts him on a gurney, and straps him down. Sinclair comes in, carrying a surgical saw.

Invincible flies over the campus looking for Will, and flies into the hole to the sewers that Doug came up from. He flies through the sewer looking for Will, and three Reaniman attack him. They knock him into Sinclair's lair, where Sinclair is ""operating"" on Will. Sinclair says that he's ""improved"" the Reaniman since Invincible fought Doug, and the Reanimen continue beating Invincible. The student insists that he's fixing humanity' weakness.

Invincible rips off one of his attacker's helmets, and Will realizes the Reaniman is Rick. Sinclair says that he removed Rick's emotions, and Will reminds Rick of the sex they had at a lake a year ago. Sinclair cuts Will's arm with his saw, and Rick sees it calls Will's name, and cries. Sinclair sees it, and Rick pulls the control plate out of the back of his head, then fights back against the other two Reanimen beating Invincible.

Will drives back with Amber and Mark, and Amber turns the radio up when Mark tries to talk to her.

At her treehouse, Atom Eve uses her powers to make coffee and refreshes herself from her previous day's exertions. She looks up more disasters on her phone, and goes up on the roof to sip coffee and watch the sunrise.

Debbie asks Nolan why he kept his incriminating costume, and he says that he used it to take care of Damien but part of him might have wanted Debbie to find it. Nolan says that he wanted to tell Debbie the truth months ago, and she asks her husband if he was mind-controlled or blackmailed. Nolan says that didn't happen, and Debbie needs to trust him and if she does, their family will be okay. Debbie says that she can't trust him, and knows almost nothing about Nolan.

A van pulls up to the Maulers' base and drives in. they shoot at the driver, who doesn't respond. They discover that he's a hologram, and Robot comes out of the back. The creature the Maulers have been creating comes out of the van next, still in its cylinder which is suspended in a robot spider carriage. The Maulers realize that it's the real Robot, and that they've been growing Robot a new body.

Robot has them show him the teenage body they've been cloning. The Robot body analyzes it and says that it's perfect, except for the poisonous sacs the Maulers planted in as well as control synapses. The body says that he'll pay them with a GDA control collar as soon as they remove the secret mechanisms they put in the body and do one last upgrade.

When the Maulers demand their payment first, the Robot mechanical body dissolves and the body says that he's alone and helpless. One of the Twins tells the other to do what Robot wants, and the other Twin puts in the upgrade, a neural link.

At the GDA, Donald takes Debbie to a control room where Cecil is waiting. Debbie tells Cecil that Nolan killed the Guardians, and when Cecil says that he knows, she slaps him. She asks how he could know and not tell her, and Cecil explains that he couldn't risk Nolan finding out that they knew until they figured out why he did it and how to stop him.

Debbie wonders if Cecil means to kill Nolan, and Cecil says that he's not sure they can. Donald nods and leaves, and Cecil tells Debbie that he only knows of one person who might be able to go head-to-head with Omni-Man. Debbie realizes who he's talking about and says that he can't, and Cecil ignore her and asks where Mark is.

Omni-Man flies to a mountaintop and rehearses a speech to Mark about how he had to kill the Guardians. He insists that it was his responsibility to do it, and figures that Mark can understand it when no one else does. Omni-Man stops, wonders what he's doing, and flies off.

Robot's organic body tells the Maulers that he didn't intend to leave his cocoon, but he met someone. The maulers put a rebreather on him and put a copy of his consciousness into the teenage body. They compensate for the original's dense neuron system, which threatens to overload their power source. The machinery blows up from the power overload anyway, but the copy process is completed.

The teenage body gets up and wonders which he is, and the Maulers tell him that they had to make the transfer seamless. The original Robot is still alive, and the original tells the teenage Robot to be happy it was him that survived and to change the world, and experience everything they ever could. The teenager wonders if they both can live, and the original reminds him that the plan was that the original die, and he wants to die. Crying, the teenager removes the rebreather and kills his original body.

The Mauler says that they know the teenager did an act of mercy, and they do it all the time. They demand the schematics, and Robot the teenager gives them a flash drive from his mobile cocoon. He tells them that it's time for them to go back to prison, and they just laugh.

The teenager points out that he's a 30-year-old genius with a neural link they just installed for him. He activates two Robot drones. The Twins defeat them, and Robot converts the van into a giant robot and attacks the Twins with it.

Donald is there, and says that it was for the Grayson family's protection. Cecil grabs an energy weapon and shoots Omni-Man, and tells the other agents to run. They do so, and Omni-Man grabs Donald's spine and squeezes. Donald says that it's been an honor and triggers a destruct button, and the house blows up.

Cecil and Debbie are watching from the control room, Omni-Man survives the explosion, and Debbie tells Cecil that Omni-Man is going to find Mark, and she doesn't know who Omni-Man is or what he's going to do. Cecil figures that they'd better find Mark first.

Mark flies up and approaches Atom Eve.

Robot tells the Twins that they will come back to prison with him, and one of the twins grabs some equipment while the other one draws the robot's fire. Working together, one of the Twins completes the gun he's making and shoots at Robot, and the robot shields him. The gun runs out of charge, and the Twins runs as the robot shoots at them. Robot gets a call from Cecil on his comm for all Guardians to come to their HQ, because there's an apocalypse-level priority. Meanwhile, the robot shoots at the clones and misses, blowing a hole in the ceiling.

Will is driving home. Omni-Man lands in front of him and demands to know where Mark is. The teenager tells Omni-Man that Amber dumped Mark, and Mark went to find Eve. Omni-Man tells Will to call Mark, and Will says that Mark's phone is broken. When Omni-Man asks where Eve is, Will remembers Mark telling him that Eve is at her treehouse. With that, Omni-Man flies off.

When the Guardians arrive at their HQ, Cecil tells then to sit tight until he calls on them. Rex demands to know what's going on, but Cecil repeats his order and signs off. The Robot drone is inactive, and the Robot teenager comes in and says that he's more alive than other. Robot says that his real name is Rudolph Connors, and Robot was a drone that he controlled remotely. Rex wonders why Rudy looks like him, and Rudy says that his story can wait until the crisis is resolve.

Cecil's people spot Invincible and Atom Eve flying across the countryside, and that Omni-Man is closing in on their location. Cecil figures that they need to buy some time, and tells his people to ""bring the hammer down"".

Invincible and Atom Eve land at a waterfall and sit, and Invincible tells Atom Eve that Amber dumped him. He doesn't know who he is or who he's supposed to be, and Atom Eve says that she's saved more lives in the last three days then in the last three years as a member of the Teen Team. She figures that she should call her mom.

The GDA fires an orbital laser at Omni-Man, blasting apart the land nearby. Omni-Man is unharmed, flies up at the satellite, and destroys it as it fires at him again. After he notices that his nose is bleeding, Omni-Man destroys a drone transmitting video of him to Cecil. The hero then heads back toward Invincible and Atom Eve, and Cecil tells his people power up the teleporter.

Rudy tells the Guardians what happened, and Rex asks him why he chose to look like him. Monster Girl realizes that Rudy did it for her, and Rudy says that they're prisoners in their own bodies. Rudy offers to help Monster Girl escape her ""prison"", and says that he adopted Rex's DNA because he noticed that Monster Girl found Rex interesting. Rex is creeped out.

Monster Girl points out all the crimes that Rudy committed to be with her, and says that she needs time to process it. Samson detects Omni-Man destroying the satellite and shows the others.

Atom eve sees the destruction of the satellite, and says that they should check in with Cecil. Mark tells her that they're both done with all that, and she says that she isolated herself to start over. However, Atom Eve insists that doesn't mean she's going to ignore the world when it needs her. Mark tells her that the world was fine before he came along and will be fine without his help, and Atom Eve tells him that he'll feel worse if he just sits there when he could save lives. Disgusted, Atom Eve flies off.

Cecil teleports ahead of Omni-Man and shoots him with a blaster to get his attention. He teleports away when Omni-Man tries to grab him, and asks why Omni-Man killed the Guardians. Omni-Man says that they were weak, and Cecil figures that Omni-Man had a reason for killing them. Cecil continues teleporting away and back when Omni-Man attacks him, and Cecil asks him about Debbie. Omni-Man tells Cecil not to speak her name, and Cecil points out that Omni-Man is the one who hurt her, not him.

Cecil points out that Omni-Man fooled them all for 20 years, and asks if Mark knows that his father is a murderer. He asks what Mark is going to do when he finds out, and Omni-Man points out that Cecil can't stop him. Cecil admits that he can't, and all he's doing is buying them a little more time. Omni-Man tries to grab Cecil at superspeed, and Cecil teleports back to the GDA control room, part of his tie in Omni-Man's hand.

Three pods crash down around Omni-Man, and Reanimen emerge from them and attack Omni-Man. They knock him down and beat him, and he flies up with them still on him. Another drone watches from nearby, transmitting the images to Cecil and Debbie. Cecil tells Debbie that the Reanimen are dead soldiers, serving their county thanks to Sinclair, who is nearby in a neck brace after Invincible hit him.

Omni-Man kills the Reanimen, and a technician tells Cecil that Invincible and Atom Eve are on the move again and will intercept Omni-Man in four minutes. Omni-Man destroys the new drone, and another one takes its place. Sinclair flies into a rage, and Cecil has his soldiers take him away. Cecil then has the ""hail Mary'--the kaiju that Omni-Man fought in Tokyo--teleported to Omni-Man.

The Maulers suture Immortal's head back on his body, and then put the control collar that they built from Rudy's collar on the resurrected Immortal.

Omni-Man flies across the wheat fields, and the kaiju teleports in front of him and knocks him down. Realizing that Cecil is listening via the drone, Omni-Man says that he beat the kaiju already. Cecil replied that they've removed its pain center, juiced it up with every drug and enhancement they had, and it's pissed off from its treatment and blames Omni-Man.

Two news helicopters move in on the fight, and the Guardians watch the newscast. Cecil tells the Guardians to stay where they are, and if the kaiju doesn't work then they're the world's last hope against Omni-Man. Rex figures that Omni-Man killed the original Guardians, and looks at the bloodstain Cecil had his people leave on the wall.

The kaiju overwhelms Omni-Man, and a technician tells Cecil that they can't teleport him to Invincible because teleporting the kaiju temporarily overloaded their systems. They call Atom Eve via her phone on Debbie's suggestion.

As the kaiju prepares to swallow Omni-Man, Invincible and Atom Eve arrive and Invincible flies to his father's defense. Meanwhile, Debbie calls Atom Eve, who tells Debbie that she just missed Invincible.

Invincible catches Omni-Man, and says that it's about time they did a team-up. Meanwhile, Cecil tells Atom Eve to do nothing except go to Guardian HQ. The kaiju grabs Invincible, and Debbie tells Cecil to call the kaiju off. Cecil tells Debbie that he can't, because it's the only remaining weapon he has against Omni-Man and he doesn't know if Invincible is with Omni-Man or against him.

The Twins activate Immortal, but he doesn't come to life. One of them pounds on the Immortal's chest. Immortal remembers bits of his long life, including Omni-Man killing him, and awakens, and goes berserk. The Twins are unable to control him with the collar to kill the Guardians, and Immortal flies off.

Invincible and Omni-Man manage to take down the kaiju, and Omni-Man tells his son that Cecil sent the kaiju after him. He tells Invincible that there's a lot he doesn't know, and the kaiju revives, grabs Invincible, and knocks Omni-Man away. Meanwhile, Cecil gets a report that Immortal is approaching the battle site.

Immortal attacks Omni-Man, taking him by surprise. The helicopters broadcast video of the fight across the globe, and Omni-Man recovers, beat off Immortal, and sees the kaiju slamming Invincible into the ground.

Invincible grabs some nearby power lines and electrocutes the kaiju, while Omni-Man drives his fist through Immortal's stomach. Will, Amber, and the Guardians watch the video, and Monster Girl takes Rudy's hand. Immortal dries his thumbs into Omni-Man's eyes, and Omni-Man rips him in half. Invincible stares at his father in shock, and Omni-Man tells him that they need to talk."

In the sky above, Invincible and Omni-Man hover and face each other. Omni-Man tells his son that they need to talk. Invincible takes in his blood-covered father, punches him, and says that someone must he controlling him. Omni-Man tells his son to stop and breaks his grip, and says that he isn't being controlled.

Omni-Man tells Invincible that it's time for his son to know where he really comes from. He explains that he's from Viltrum, and the natives reached their full potential by removing the weak. When it was over, the Viltrumite population was cut in half and what emerged from the ashes was unstoppable. The Viltrumite survivors decided they would be the only empire, and swept out across the galaxy. Some species resisted, but no one could withstand them for long and the Viltrum Empire encompassed thousands of planets.

With their expansion, the Viltrumites were spread too thin. The most trusted officers were each given a planet to weaken. Omni-Man was chosen for Earth, came there, married Debbie, and they had a son: Mark.

Now, Omni-Man and Invincible need to work together to get Earth ready to join the Viltrum Empire. Omni-Man says that it's good news, and they can finally be who they were meant to be. He says that he couldn't tell the truth until Invincible had his powers and Omni-Man was sure that Invincible was a Viltrumite. Invincible insists that Omni-Man loves him and Debbie, His father tells him that Viltrumites, and Invincible, will live for thousands of years. Everyone Invincible knows and loves will be dead before he looks 30, and they can help humans by stopping wars

Invincible is shocked when Omni-Man says that Debbie is more like a pet to him, and says that he isn't going to enslave his friends for aliens that he's never met .Omni-Man says that he can't let Invincible interfere, and Invincible braces himself to fight.

Omni-Man punches Invincible to the ground below, and easily catches Invincible's next punch. He then throws Invincible away and flies after him, while Cecil's people track them via the drones. Debbie tells Cecil that her husband and son will kill each other, and Cecil has to stop them. Cecil orders his people to scramble jets out of Chicago, to distract Omni-Man so Invincible can think of something.

The Guardians watch from their base, and Rudy says that they follow Cecil's orders and stay there. Samson agrees, and Atom Eve flies in and Rex hugs her in relief. The others tell her what's going on with Invincible and Omni-Man, and Rudy warns that Invincible will have to be invincible to face Omni-Man and survive.

Omni-Man and Invincible continue fighting, and the fighters circle them. When Omni-Man throws Invincible to the ground, the pilots open fire. The missiles have no effect on Omni-Man, and he smashes through one fighter. The pilot plummets toward the ground, and Invincible flies up and catches him.

The ejector seat's chute ejects, knocking Invincible away. He flies back, recatches the pilot, pulls him out of the seat just before it crashes into the ground, and lands nearby. As the pilot thanks Invincible, Omni-Man lands behind the pilot, grabs his skull, and crushes it to demonstrate to Invincible the futility of saving him. Omni-flies up after the other pilot, and Invincible grabs his father before he can bring down the other jet. Omni-Man says that it made no difference that the pilot died when he would have died of old age anyway.

Omni-Man punches Invincible into the city, devastating the streets. Invincible recovers and looks around at the destruction caused by his fall. A building he was smashed through starts to fall, and Invincible flies up to catch it. A mother and daughter fall out the window as the building tilts over, and Ii grabs the mother by the hand as the daughter holds onto the edge. The building collapses despite Invincible's efforts.

Cecil and Debbie watch the carnage from the GDA monitor room.

Invincible climbs out and discovers that he is clutching the mother's severed arm. He drop it and collapses sobbing to his knees, and Omni-Man flies down and says that it was Invincible's fault because of his stubbornness against the inevitable. He asks Invincible how many more need to die, and it's up to Invincible. Omni-Man says that Invincible knows that he's right, and Invincible asks him if Debbie's life is worthless. His father says that in the grand scheme of things it is. Listening, Debbie breaks into tears.

Furious, Invincible attacks Omni-Man, who stops him and tells his son that for the first time in his life, he's telling Invincible the truth. He slams Invincible into the subway below, then holds him up as a subway train approaches. It slams into them, shatters around Ii, and crashes into the station.

When the crash is over, Omni-Man tells Invincible that the people are meaningless. Invincible says that Omni-Man is wrong, and he's seen his father die to protect humanity. He figures that Omni-Man was a Viltrumite when he came to Earth, but he's changed and was happy there. Omni-Man concedes that he was happy for a time, but he's loyal to Viltrumite.

Invincible attacks Omni-Man again, who easily dodges his blows and flies him up into the sky. Invincible breaks free, and Omni-Man grabs him again and says that he'll burn the planet down rather than live among the ""animals"" for another minute. He punches Invincible repeatedly up into the clouds, then says that he was wrong to raise Invincible as a human and should have prepared him better.

Samson says that they can still save lives and should move out. When Rudy says that Cecil's orders were to stay there, Dupli-Kate tells him that they don't care. Monster Girl tells Rudy that he's not a robot anymore, takes Rudy's hand, and they go with the others.

Omni-Man slams Invincible into the ocean bottom, then takes him up through an ocean liner and throws his son into a mountain. The impact causes an avalanche that buries Invincible and wipes out the town below. Omni-Man asks Invincible if he's had enough yet. When Invincible says he'll stop Omni-Man yet, Omni-punches him into another mountain and insists that Earth joining the Viltrum Empire will make it better than it ever was. He says that they're to show the humans how wrong they are if they resist.

When Invincible doesn't yield, Omni-Man beats him and says that he can start again with another son. As he shatters Invincible's teeth, Omni-Man remembers when he and Debbie watches a tooth-gapped Mark playing baseball as a child. Nolan isn't thrilled with wasting his time watching the game, and it's a waste of everyone's time. Debbie says that they made Mark, and when their son feels joy, his parents feel joy.

Mark hits a home run and runs the bases. Debbie tells Nolan that their children remind them of the joys in life, and that's humanity. Nolan smiles and cheers Mark as his son slides into home base and is safe Debbie and Nolan hug, and Mark runs over and joins them. Nolan picks up his son and says that he saw it.

In the present, Omni-Man looks at the bloody and beaten Invincible. He curses and collapses next to Invincible, then yells at Invincible asking why he made his father beat him. Omni-Man yells that Invincible is fighting so that he can eventually see everyone around him die. He asks what Invincible will have after 500 years, and Invincible says that he'll still have his father. Omni-Man stares at his son's blood on his hands, then flies off the planet, grief-stricken.

Nolan's travel books will sell well after his death, and they sent proxies of Debbie and Mark to Nolan's funeral.

Debbie thanks Cecil for his cover-up, and Cecil says that Nolan fooled him and he's trying to make things as right as he can for Debbie and Mark.

The Guardians return to their base, exhausted from their rescue efforts, and Rex cleans the bloodstain ""reminder"" off the wall. Samson says that they haven't earned it, and when Rcx ignores him, Samson grabs his soldier. The other Guardians prepare to attack Samson, and Samson tells Rex that now they look like a team. The others join Rex in his efforts.

Mark wakes up, and Cecil tells him that it's a hell of a thing that he did. Cecil explains that Mark has been unconscious for almost two weeks, and tells Mark to rest when he asks where Omni-Man went. Mark goes after Cecil, and admits that he doesn't know if he still wants to be a hero. Cecil tells Mark to come with him, and takes him to a blank white room. He says that Debbie heard everything Omni-Man said, so Mark doesn't have to explain it to her. Cecil explains that Debbie deserved the truth, and she was holding out hope that Omni-Man had a good reason for killing the Guardians.

Mark agrees and wonders where they are, and Cecil turns on the lights the camouflage and reveals a secret weapons workshop. Immortal's body is there, being examines. Cecil turns the lights back off, and explains that people are fed chemicals in their room that prevent them from seeing certain frequencies of lights, and the frequencies are used in the room. He then tells Mark that Omni-Man flew out of the solar system and the galaxy, and they need a replacement.

Mark says that he won't be a hero yet, because it's too much. Cecil takes Mark and Debbie to their home, and says that they fixed it and did everything to cover up Debbie and Mark's absences from work and school. He tells them to call him if they need anything else and leaves.

Inside, Debbie goes to lie down and Mark looks at a photo of his family. He remembers his father telling him that he and Mark have responsibilities as Viltrumites, that normal humans don't. When Mark remembers Omni-Man beating him, he angrily slaps the photo face down.

Discovering that the refrigerator is empty, Mark calls upstairs to Debbie that he's going to order them something for dinner. When Debbie doesn't respond, Mark goes upstairs and sees Debbie on her bed, crying. She doesn't see Mark, and he quietly leaves.

He gets a call from Cecil saying that he needs Mark, and Mark excuses himself to talk to Cecil privately. Cecil tells Mark that some is flying toward Earth from deep space, and they don't know who it is.

They sit on the moon and Invincible tells Allen the situation. Allen says that Viltrumites don't just give up, and they blew up Allen's planet rather than lose. The alien says that the Coalition of Planets is trying to unite enough worlds to stop the Viltrumites, and figures Omni-Man abandoning his post could be the advantage they're looking for. Invincible smiles, and says that he's learned Earth is just a small part of a bigger situation makes it all feel more manageable.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2912494/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"97 years after a nuclear war, human kind is living in space. 100 juvenile delinquents are sent down to Earth to see if the planet is habitable.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Bharat Nalluri'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Clarke (Eliza Taylor) is sketching on the floor, imagining what its like to be on Earth with the sun on her face, trees around her, scent of wildflowers however she is stranded in space. 97 years have passed since a nuclear apocalypse left the planet contaminated by radiation. There were survivors. Twelve nations had operational space stations in orbit at the time but now they are clustered into one, called The Ark. It is believed that Earth will not become survivable for another 100 years, and then they can go back to it

Guards enter the room 17 year-old Clarke is in a prison cell. They stand her up and put a locking wristband on her wrist. Every crime on The Ark is punishable by death, unless you are under 18, where you just get locked up until, at 18, you are reviewed. As a guard tries to take her father's watch, Clarke struggles and runs outside her cell. She looks out at tiers and tiers of cells. As the guards approach Clarke, a woman comes by and tells them to stop. Its Clarke's mom (Paige Turco). Clarke fears she is going to be executed to preserve resources for the remaining citizens. Her mom tells her that is not true, and instead, she, and the other youthful prisoners, The 100, are being sent to the ground. A guard shoots a tranquillizer dart at Clarke and she falls unconscious.

A pod is launched from The Ark. Clarke wakes, strapped in like the other members of The 100, some sitting, some upright. She is surprised to see Wells (Eli Goree) sitting next to her. He explains that when he found out they were going to the ground, he got himself arrested. There is turbulence Wells says its the atmosphere. A video comes on with the Chancellor (Isaiah Washington) explaining that The 100 have been given a second chance, but that the second chance is also for those left on The Ark. He tells them their slates have been wiped clean.

On The Ark, the citizens demand to know what the pod was. Some yell that The 100 are just kids. Cece (Kelly Hu), speaking for the Council, will not confirm or deny anything.

On the pod, the Chancellor on the video explains that they are being deposited near Mount Weather, a military storage facility, built during the war, that is stocked with supplies to last 300 people up to 2 years.

A boy (Finn) has un-strapped himself from his position and is doing low-g acrobatics to the amusement of the others . . . except Clarke and Wells. The boy stops in front of Wells and says, Check it out. Your dad floated me after all. Wells is not amused. Two other boys have unstrapped themselves as well, and Clarke urges them to re-attach themselves. The pod's drag parachutes deploy and the pod's passengers are tossed about, especially those who aren't strapped in. They are thrown violently against the bulkheads, dismantling cables and conduit, resulting in blasts of steam and showers of sparks.

On The Ark, it's reported that the pod is off-course and in system failure. They have lost all means of communication except for the telemetry from the passengers wrist-bands. The 100 are on their own.

As it appears dire on the pod, Wells tells Clarke he has to tell her something. She says if it's about her father, that she won't listen to whatever he has to say.

The descent rockets kick in and the pod lands softly. One boy (Jasper) notices there are no machine noises, a first for all of them. The 100 unstrap themselves and move about. Finn (Thomas McDonell) is kneeling over one of the boys who had unstrapped himself. Clarke, kneeling next to another body, asks if the boy is still breathing and Finn shakes his head.

The 100 rush to the lower level where the main hatch is located. Clarke rushes down and urges them to stop the air outside may be toxic. An older boy (Bellamy) by the door reasons that if the air is toxic, they will soon be dead anyway. A girl climbing down the ladder sees the older boy and calls his name. She runs over and they hug. She asks, and he explains, he put on a guards uniform so he could get on the pod. They reveal they are brother and sister. Someone calls out that no one on The Ark has a sibling. Someone else calls out that the girl (Octavia) was the one they found hiding underneath the floorboards in one of the resident quarters. Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) runs to attack but Bellamy (Bob Morley) stops her. Instead, he lifts a latch and the hatch opens with a blast of steam. Everyone blinks from the bright sunlight, filtering through tall trees. Octavia takes a deep breath of the fresh air and steps out.

Everyone rushes out, including Clarke, who, studying a map of the terrain, determines that they landed far from Mount Weather. She looks up and sees the mountain on the near horizon. Finn comes up behind her, joking that they didn't die in a fiery explosion. She reminds him of the two dead boys who had followed Finn out of his seat. She then points out Mount Weather to Finn. She says its a long, radiation-soaked forest between them and their next meal.

In the control room on The Ark, an older well-coiffed man (Kane), Clarke's mom (Abby), and some scientists (including Jackson) are disappointed that they have lost contact with the pod because now, they cannot determine the conditions on Earth. However, individual screens on the wall of control room tell them the condition of The 100 based on the telemetry from the wristbands and they can use that information instead. They know two of The 100 have perished but reason that it was due to the violent landing. Kane (Henry Ian Cusick) notices that some of the telemetry screens are highlighted in red, indicating spiking vital signs. Abby thinks they may be injured from the landing, or are just excited to be on Earth.

Wells has taken a walk around the pod and tells Clarke they have problems : that they have no communication, and that heat shields on the top of the pod failed and the radio wires are fried. Clarke points to the map and shows him how far they are from Mount Weather. Jasper (Devon Bostic) looks over their shoulders and Wells grabs his arm and pushes him away. A humorless boy (Murphy) backed by a gang of thugs, comes up and tells Wells to back off. Wells tells them they have to figure out where they are. Bellamy, standing with Octavia, tells Wells all they need to know is that they are on the ground. Wells reminds them of the video they saw with the Chancellor, his father, urging them to get to the shelter and supplies at Mount Weather. Octavia says that Wells is not in charge and that they do not have to listen to what the Chancellor says. Clarke says they don't have to listen to what she or Wells or the Chancellor have to say, but they have to reach the food or it will become difficult for them very soon. They have to leave now to traverse the twenty miles before it gets dark. Bellamy suggests that Clarke and Wells, the privileged, go to Mount Weather and bring them back the supplies. Wells tells them they don't understand, that they ALL have to go, but Murphy (Richard Harmon) approaches him and kicks his feet out from under him. Wells slowly gets up and the two face each other, but Finn jumps in between the two, reminds Murphy that Wells has only one leg and that Murphy should wait until its a fair fight. Octavia steps in and flirts with Finn, and Murphy leads his gang away. Bellamy glares at Octavia and reminds her that Finn is a criminal. Octavia, in turn, reminds Bellamy that they are ALL criminals. He takes her aside and reminds her that he came down here to protect her. She says she does not need protection, and having been locked up for most of her life, she cant keep following orders and needs to be free. He whispers that he cannot stay with the group that he did something on The Ark in order to get on the pod, and they will kill him for it if and when the rest come down.

Finn asks Clarke and Wells when they are leaving for Mount Weather. Clarke says right away but Wells wonders how just the two of them can bring enough food for The 100. Finn turns around and recruits Jasper and Monty (Christopher Larkin). Octavia comes by and says shes joining them. Clarke notices Finns wristband is scratched up and he admits he tried to remove it. She says if he took it off, they will think he is dead. Finn says he doesn't care. Clarke asks him if he wants his loved ones on The Ark to think he is dead, or if he wants them to think the Earth is inhospitable and not come down. Bellamy looks on.

The group heads out. Clarke lags behind and tells Wells he should not have come down. When she catches up, Octavia tells Clarke that Finn belongs to her; Clarke says she doesn't care.

In the control room, Cece checks up on Abby. Abby is optimistic as Clarkes telemetry signs are good. Abby gets a call and she tells Jackson (Sachin Sahel) to bring blood plasma. Cece calls to Abby as she is running out and Abby explains that the Chancellor has been shot. Kane looks on.

The group walks on, gaping at the flora. As Finn picks a flower and puts it behind Octavias ear, Jasper is impressed that Finn has game. Monty is unimpressed saying that the flower is poison sumac (Octavia freaks and brushes it off her head), not actually poison but has medicinal purposes his parents are in charge of the pharmaceuticals on The Ark. Clarke urges them along and Finn wonders how she can block the beautiful scenery out. Clarke wonders why they haven't seen any animals and that maybe they have already been exposed to a lot of radiation.

As they continue, Finn asks the boys why they were imprisoned. Monty points out that sumac is not the only herb in The Ark garden. Jasper adds that Monty also forgot to replenish what they had taken from the garden. Jasper asks Octavia what she was busted for and she mumbles, for being born, and runs off to catch up with Clarke. They come upon a six-pointed deer and crouch down in awe to watch it feed. Finn steps on a twig and the animal turns to look at them it has one and a half faces on its deformed head.

The Chancellor is waking up on the operating table, mid-surgery, and Abby insists they increase his anesthesia. Jackson reminds her that they have already used the patient allotment of anesthesia and blood, so she goes to increase the dosage herself. Outside, Shumway (Terry Chen) reports to Kane that they've determined that the shooter was Bellamy Blake, a janitor. He has a sister who their mother kept hidden from them for sixteen years. Shumway reminds Kane that he, as Chancellor pro tempore, can start reducing The Ark population by the proposed 300 citizens immediately. Kane says, not yet, but Shumway reminds him that the removal of The 100 only bought them a months time, and that is not enough time for the engineers to find a way to extend their existence on The Ark, if they even can. Kane tells him to back off. In the meantime, Kane wants to know who helped Bellamy get on the pod surely there is another traitor around.

At the camp, Wells is gathering firewood. He sees that etched on the side of the pod is First Son, First to Dye. Murphy and a henchman come by. Clutching a knife, Murphy tells Wells that his father begged for mercy in the airlock chamber before Wells father floated him. Wells bumps him as he walks off, telling Murphy that he spelled Die wrong.

Bellamy has been watching this and sarcastically advises Murphy not to announce the fact that he plans to kill someone before he kills him. Bellamy tells them that they need to stop the authorities from coming down, that they would never forgive their crimes, and even if they do, they will always be second-class citizens. He recommends they remove their wristbands that The Ark will think them dead and that it is not safe to come down. Bellamy tells Murphy that the additional benefit is that he will make him his enforcer.

Abby returns to the control room and finds out Murphy and his henchmen have died. Kane thinks its from the radiation, but Abby says they wouldn't have died so quickly.

As the group continues, Finn wonders why the Council chose today to send them to ground. Octavia doesn't care, shes enjoying her freedom. Clarke says its because The Ark is dying that there is only three months left of life support, maybe four, now that The 100 has been sent down. Finn realizes that this information is why Clarke was imprisoned and her father, an engineer, was floated. Her father thought the citizens had the right to know but that the Council, and her mother, thought it would cause a panic. Monty hypothesizes that they will have to kill more citizens. Finn says they have to warn the citizens. Clarke looks at him and says that is what her father said.

Octavia has run off ahead, stands on top of a rock formation, and is taking off her clothes,. Down to her underwear, she jumps off. They catch up and see that she is shoulder-deep in a large river. Monty reminds her they cant swim, but she stands up, now waist-deep, and says they can stand. Clarke is alternately happy and confused there is not supposed to be a river there. Finn says that doesn't matter and tells her to take off her clothes. As Jasper undresses, he sees in the distance a disturbance in the water, and it is coming closer to where Octavia is wading. Despite his warnings, a large sea snake grabs her and drags her under water and disappears.

They look out over the river but only see calm waters. Suddenly Octavia pops up on their far right, still being dragged by the sea snake. Finn makes to get in, but Clarke holds him back and gets him to help her push a large rock into the water. It falls in, makes a large splash, and the sea snake lets go of Octavia and heads towards the distraction. Jasper dives in near Octavia. The sea snake comes back towards them but Jasper drags her on to the shore just in time. Octavia has a large bloody wound on her thigh but manages to hug Jasper. Clarke tears a strip from Jaspers shirt and makes a tourniquet. Monty pats Jasper on the shoulder and tells himself that next time, he will save the girl.

Wells hobbles out of the pod and hears primal yelling and screaming. The 100 are gathered around a bonfire, making a ceremony out of removing the wristbands. He confronts Bellamy, reminding the crowd that The Ark will think them dead and not follow down. Bellamy mockingly calls him Chancellor and says that is the point, and that they can take care of themselves. Wells says the people up there are not just their family and friends but their farmers and doctors and engineers as well. Wells asks if it is safe on Earth, how they can NOT want their people to come down. Bellamy says that HIS people are already there. And that the people up there locked HIS people up, and killed his mother for the crime of having a second child, which he blames on Wells father. Wells says his father didn't write the law, to which Bellamy retorts that here, there are no laws; and that here, they can do whatever the hell they want, which begins a chant among The 100. A thunderstorm breaks and Wells tells Bellamy they need to collect the rainwater. As The 100 dance in celebration, Bellamy replies, whatever the hell Wells wants.

In the control room, they see more of The 100 dying, however, Jackson also notices that plasma osmolality is going up, so they must have found water. Kane comes in with security and they arrest Abby for over-using the allotment of anesthesia and blood on the Chancellor. She says she broke the law and used whatever it took to keep the Chancellor alive, to keep Kane from becoming Chancellor. He takes this as a confession and says he has no choice but to find her guilty. She counters that there is always a choice like when Kane chose to press charges against her husband, resulting in his floating, and to include Clarke in the charges. Kane cites Penal Code 1 and sentences her death. He whispers to her that he chooses to do anything to keep the human race alive. She counters and says she chooses to do anything to make sure the human race DESERVES to stay alive.

Abby is put in the same cell Clarke was in. She notices Clarke's sketches.

Clarke wakes on the forest floor the group is all asleep around her and is fascinated by the bioluminescent flowers. Finn is also awake and has gone down to the river for a canteen of water. She drinks. Finn points out a footprint of something bipedal. She says shes read nothing about bipedal animals in that area.

Cece goes to Kanes quarters to plead for the life of her best friend. He says hes the only one who is willing to do what it takes to save humankind. Cece begs for mercy. Kane says they cant afford mercy.

Bellamy wakes Wells in the middle of the night and leads him into a clearing in the forest at gunpoint. Bellamy says he isn't going to shoot him but wants The 100 to think that he has. Bellamy wonders why Wells is behaving the way he is, since his father had banished him. He encourages Wells to take off the wristband. Wells refuses and Bellamy gives a signal whereby three thugs grab Wells, hold him down, and force off the wristband.

Abby is looking out the portal at Earth when the guards come to get her. She is dragged to an airlock. Cece hugs her. As the guards separate them, she asks Cece to watch over Clarke. Abby shrugs off the guards and walks in to the airlock herself. As the doors close, she tells Jackson to work with Sinclair to reverse engineer the wristbands to see if they can be used for communication. As Kane nods to Shumway, the Chancellor hobbles in and declares Abby pardoned. He tells Kane he will deal with him later and demands that Shumway open the door. Abby walks out and tells an orderly to take the Chancellor back to bed.

The group has to ford a wide gap over a ravine. Finn is on a precipice, holding on to a vine and is hesitant to swing across. Jasper encourages him but notices Octavia watching them. Jasper offers to go instead and Finn hands him the vine. Jasper makes it across to the cheers of the others and finds a deteriorating sign indicating Mount Weather. A spear comes from nowhere and pierces Jasper in the chest. The group crouches for cover. Clarke concludes that they are not alone."

Slow Horses begins with: ""how River Cartwright slipped off the fast track and joined the slow horses"", a failure that seems to have had truly catastrophic consequences. To begin we are with River Cartwright, played by Jack Lowden. He's at a London Airport (not a railway station as written), earpiece in, keeping an eye on a suspect. James 'Spider' Webb, is the one in his ear, guiding him, feeding him intel as well as giving orders which are coming from Diana Taverner (know as Lady Di) played by Kristin Scott Thomas). They're telling him to 'hold position', don't go in, they wait and wait and then tell him to go. By this time the suspect has begun to make his way onto the plane so River gives chase bringing him down prior to boarding, only to find that this isn't the man. River is asked to confirm the sighting of the suspect, he does so, saying, ""blue shirt, white t-shirt"", Spider is confused, he says it's the other way round...They get back on CCTV and find the real suspect, making his way towards the train station at the airport. River gives chase, again, barging people out of the way, roughly in some cases. He reaches the true suspect but is too late, the man detonates his back-pack. (River is, in fact, convinced that the slip-up wasn't really his, and that he was actually set up -- a lingering question that continues to play a role in the story.)

Meet Jackson Lamb, Gary Oldman ("" Darkest Hour"", "" Killers Anonymous ""), head of the Slough House arm of MI5. This is where Spooks who have majorly f*cked up in their careers end up, with little to no hope of ever getting out. Lamb doesn't seem to care anymore, he's obviously intelligent, obviously knew his stuff, maybe still does, but he's been left to rot looking after these f*ck ups, maybe even himself. River is now shifting through rubbish on the office floor, we don't know how long has passed, but we do learn that it was a training exercise, though had it been real it would have resulted in hundreds dead, more injured and millions in damage. Catherine Standish (played by Saskia Reeves), Lamb's assistant, asks him what on Earth he's looking for, but he doesn't know, just doing as he's told. Lamb later says he's looking for the remnants of a once promising career. Another agent from Slough House, Sid Baker (played by Olivia Cooke) is sitting in a cafe. She distracts a reporter, Robert Hobden (Played by Paul Hilton), and swipes the contents of his laptop. Taverner wants Sid to bring the laptop with the contents of the USB stick on to her. But it ends up being River, who has a run-in with Spider whom he blames for him now being in Slough House. On the way to HQ, Regents Park, River opens the Flashbox and copies the files onto his own USB. There's nothing on the USB, just PI to many decimal places. River goes to see his grandfather David Cartwright (Played by Jonathan Pryce, the one who pulled some strings to keep him in MI5, to ask him about the journalist. He doesn't know much, but it seems like he knows more. In fact, things fortunately did not go as spectacularly wrong as the first impression suggests -- but River did slip up badly, and it's more than enough to pretty much destroy his career. River comes with a secret service pedigree, raised by a grandfather, David Cartwright, 'the O.B.', who was clearly an old hand in the game. (Possibly, too, he still exerted enough influence that River wasn't simply fired for his mistake.) In Leeds a standup comedian is telling edgy jokes, mainly about religion, he's white but it's his friend who is writing the jokes, he tells his friend he'll confuse people by laughing at the muslim jokes. He's being watched though, but is it the comedian or the friend?

This is a fabulous introduction to Slow Horses, you are left in no doubt that everyone in that office has a back story, something has gone wrong in their lives and that's lead them to be in this decrepit sh*t hole of an office.

Some seem to just get on with it, not be that bothered by it and try to make the best of it. River doesn't seem like one of those, he desperately wants to be back in the action and he's going to do whatever he can to make it happen.

Later, Peter asks Lois for permission to attend an upcoming stag party. After he promises he won't drink, Lois lets him go. Unfortunately, Peter forgets his promise to Lois and plays such drinking games as ""Drink the beer"". He goes to work the next day with a hangover and falls asleep on the job as a safety inspector in a toy factory. Peter misses dangerous objects such as a butcher knife, a surge protector, a gasoline can, razor blades, a porcupine, a toaster with forks inside, and plug-in water. The company receives bad press after releasing unsafe toy products, and Peter is promptly fired by Mr. Weed.

At dinner, Peter breaks the news to his children but decides to keep it from Lois. He tries different jobs, such as cereal mascot and sneeze guard, but fails miserably. Brian pressures him to tell her the truth, but all he manages to do is to tell Lois how fat she is. Brian insists that Peter must look out for his family's welfare. With the word ""welfare"" in his mind, Peter soon applies for government assistance at a welfare office. But a processing error creates a weekly check for $150,000, which is based on a remark former President Ronald Reagan made of a woman called Linda Taylor from Chicago, Illinois, calling her a ""welfare queen"" by making assumptions of earning such proportions from government benefits in 1974. Telling Lois he received a big raise, Peter spends his money on many foolish and extravagant things, such as renting the Statue of David, treating Meg to cosmetic surgery and even going so far as to surround his house with a moat to protect them from the Black Knight.

Unfortunately, Lois is given the welfare check by the mail lady and storms at Peter for lying to her. Peter decides to return the money to the taxpayers by dumping it from a blimp during Super Bowl XXXIII while Brian accompanies him. After the commotion they cause, they are immediately shot down.

Eventually, Lois receives the bad news and goes to court, still angry at Peter for lying to her in the first place. After Peter apologizes for lying to Lois and accepting the money instead of reporting the welfare error, the judge sentences him to 24 months in prison for welfare fraud. Lois, Brian, Chris, and Meg exclaim, ""Oh no!"" but the Kool-Aid Man bursts through the courthouse wall and exclaims, ""Oh yeah!"" Lois tries to explain he's not that bad and she loves him and insists that, no matter what, she will always stand by her husband. The judge agrees and sends her to jail with him. Stewie, being a baby, must have his parents by his side, regardless of his burning hatred for them, especially Lois. He then whips out his mind control device and forces the judge into letting his father go free and get his job back.

Peter states that he has learned his lesson and will never do it again. Instead, he is going to try for such things as a minority scholarship, a sexual harassment suit, and a disability claim."

Unfortunately, he doesn't pay attention to the road, focusing instead on trying to watch TV through the window of a nearby house and crashes into the local satellite receiver dish, knocking out cable TV for the entire Quahog area. He places the blame on Meg, making her even less popular than usual, but he promises her a convertible when she finally gets her license. Peter, who according to Brian is addicted to television, copes with the loss of TV by creating a harness that holds a cardboard television set in front of his face, allowing him to pretend that things around him are on TV.

Meg finally cracks under the pressure of the town's resentment and tells everyone that Peter was the driver who wrecked the receiver. The town is ready to lynch Peter, but Lois convinces the town that now that TV is gone, everybody can focus on more wholesome activities. The townsfolk forgive Peter and move on to enjoy real life.

Peter learns to participate in family activities to fill the void. However, his enthusiasm for life quickly exhausts the rest of the family. When television service is restored, the family is unable tempt him back away from real life, as he opts instead to attend a Bavarian folk festival with William Shatner.

Meanwhile, Stewie is revolted by the broccoli he is fed. Rather than eat it, he plans to wipe out the crop worldwide by modifying a See 'n Say into a weather control device. He uses the remains of the satellite dish, which were tangled around the bumper of Peter's car, to amplify the machine's signal and he succeeds in creating a freezing rainstorm, but the process is interrupted by a bolt of lightning, which destroys the machine, though the storm rages on.

Lois takes Meg out on a driving lesson and the two get caught in the storm. Peter and Shatner begin running back to the Griffin's house barefoot in the rain, but are run over by Meg. Shatner dies on the spot while Peter is subsequently hospitalized in a body cast. The nurse leaves the television turned on, and Peter can't resist being drawn in."

Meg cries all the way home to Peter from cheerleading practice, and has been having trouble fitting in at school. Later, she discovers a new friend named Jennifer.

Peter covers his mistake up by telling Lois that they don't need to have Stewie's party at Cheesie Charlie's because they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home. Meanwhile, Stewie makes it all the way to the airport before deciding that he should face ""The Man in White"" after all.

What Peter and Lois don't realize is that Meg's ""party"" is actually a cult meeting where all the members are about to commit group suicide.

The Cult Leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as ""The Man in White"".

It isn't long before the basement bar becomes a local hot spot. When Lois discovers this, she's upset, but then she gets a chance to sing on stage before an adoring crowd. As she enjoys the spotlight, Peter becomes increasingly uncomfortable with all the attention she's getting, especially from the male patrons. In addition, after the wives of the male patrons express their anger to Peter, he suggests they come down and confront Lois. But the wives later have a change of heart after she tells them about her feelings, as well as how poorly Peter treats her, something Peter didn't bother to tell the women before.

Meanwhile, Stewie's time machine plans are discovered, causing him to panic about the breach of security. In a clear move to protect the plans, he uses the machine to go back in time before his plans were actually found. But he reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. Stewie even manages to back time up to before Chris's soccer game, successfully avoiding the whole altercation between Peter and the pregnant soccer mom. But, unfortunately, his teething pain is still with him."

Nervous and on edge, the girl thinks she heard something and fears something is there. The boy calls out but gets no response, during which the girl's face morphs into that of a vampire and bites the boy, revealing to the viewer that she was the only danger all along. The girl, we will later find out, is Darla.

Buffy has a nightmare the morning of her first day of school. Her mother drives her to the school and encourages her to think positive. Inside the building, Principal Flutie tells her she will start with a clean slate. He reconsiders that after realizing that Buffy burned down her previous school's gym because ""it was full of vampi... asbestos.""

Buffy exits the office and bumps into another student, spilling the contents of her handbag over the floor. Xander sees that and helps Buffy, introducing himself. She leaves without her stake, which Xander pockets because he called out to her, but she had already walked away. In history class, Buffy is helped by Cordelia, who afterwards tests her ""coolness factor,"" skipping the written as Buffy had just moved to Sunnydale, California from Los Angeles. To Buffy's horror, Cordelia humiliates an awkward Willow at the water fountain. Inside the library, Mr. Giles places a book titled Vampyr in front of Buffy after realizing who she was. A stunned Buffy makes a hasty exit.

Buffy, Willow, Jesse McNally and Xander meet during a break and Xander returns the stake. Buffy claims it is standard self-defense in Los Angeles. Cordelia appears and tells Buffy that gym is canceled ""due to the extreme dead guy"" in Aura's locker. Buffy asks whether there were marks on the body, freaking out Cordelia. Buffy forces her way into the locker room, examines the body, and finds the characteristic puncture wounds of a vampire on the neck.

Buffy returns to the library and confronts Giles, who informs her that he is her Watcher. Buffy refuses to accept her calling as a Slayer since it had gotten her kicked out of her previous school and cost her social life. After they leave the library, Xander emerges from behind the shelves, having overheard the strange conversation.

That night, en route to her first visit to The Bronze, the cool hangout in Sunnydale, Buffy meets a mysterious, handsome stranger, who warns her that she is living on a Hellmouth that is about to open, and that ""the Harvest"" is coming. He also gives her a large silver cross. It isn't revealed until the next episode that the stranger's name is Angel.

In The Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment: ""Because tomorrow you might be dead."" She finds Giles and tells him about Angel. Giles tells her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to pick out a vampire in the club and is alarmed to see Willow leave with him. She loses them and is surprised by Cordelia, nearly staking her. Cordelia immediately calls her friends to tell them about it. While Buffy looks for Willow, Jesse chats up Darla at The Bronze. Buffy is stopped by Xander, whom she convinces to help her search for Willow.

Meanwhile, under the streets of Sunnydale, The Master is woken by lesser vampires from a long sleep to prepare for the Harvest. He sends Luke to fetch young blood.

Willow's new acquaintance takes her to a crypt in a cemetery where they are joined by Darla and Jesse, whom she has bitten. Buffy and Xander arrive. Buffy kills Willow's vampire. Xander and Willow help Jesse, who has been weakened, flee. Luke takes Darla's place in the fight so she can help catch the kids. Luke throws Buffy in a stone coffin and is about to move in for the kill.

Luke is about to finish off Buffy, who is trapped in a stone coffin, but is repelled by the silver cross that a mysterious stranger had given her earlier that evening

Buffy escapes the mausoleum and saves Xander and Willow from vampires in the graveyard. Darla has taken Jesse, however. She and Luke inform The Master that there is probably a Slayer in town. The Master decides to use Jesse as bait.

Giles and Buffy give Xander and Willow a brief introduction to the world of vampires, demons and Slayers. Willow accesses the city council's plans for Sunnydale's tunnel system. In a flashback, Buffy realizes that there must be an access to it in the crypt. Xander is hurt when Buffy declines his help but follows her anyway.

Willow is researching the Master in the computer lab when Cordelia trash-talks about Buffy and insults Willow again. In a fine show of nerd revenge, Willow convinces Cordelia to press the DEL key to ""deliver"" her assignment. It ended up erasing her hard work. The dark stranger appears just as Buffy is about to enter the tunnel system in the crypt. He is named Angel. He gives her directions to The Master's lair, but only wishes her luck after she is out of earshot.

Xander catches up with Buffy. They find Jesse, who leads them into a trap. They barely escape, with Xander pulling Buffy out of a manhole. Underground, The Master is unhappy about their escape and punishes the vampire Colin by poking his eye out. Luke drinks the Master's blood, turning Luke into the Vessel. Every soul Luke now takes will give the Master more strength to break out of his confinement.

Buffy and Xander return to the library. Giles explains that the Master arrived 60 years ago to open the Hellmouth, a portal to another reality, but was swallowed by an earthquake. He is now hoping to escape with the help of a Vessel in a once-in-a-century opportunity called ""The Harvest."" To prevent the Master from escaping and opening the Hellmouth, they must kill the Vessel. Xander suggests that the vampires will be at The Bronze.

On her way there, Buffy swings by her house to get weapons and is promptly grounded by her mother, who has been called by the Principal about Buffy skipping classes. Buffy grabs her weapons from a secret compartment of a chest and climbs out of the second-floor window.

Luke and other vampires burst into The Bronze and start the killing. Buffy arrives in time to save Cordelia. She also notices the Vessel mark on Luke's forehead. Xander ends up staking Jesse with a fleeing man's unknowing help. Willow pours holy water on Darla when she is about to bite Giles. Buffy tricks Luke to win her fight. The other vampires flee. Outside The Bronze, Angel realizes that Buffy has done it. ""I'll be damned,"" he says. If only we knew how true it is.

The next morning, Cordelia exemplifies the denial most Sunnydale residents undergo after paranormal encounters. Giles warns the budding gang of more battles ahead, which they accept more nonchalantly than he would like."

During trials, the hands of a girl named Amber spontaneously combust. Amy seems to be under strong pressure from her winning mother, a star cheerleader in her day, and is crushed when she only makes the substitute list after Cordelia and Buffy. We see a brief glimpse of somebody bewitching Barbie dolls over a kettle. Next thing, Cordelia cannot see, which she proves the hard way during driving instruction, and is just saved in the nick of time by Buffy. To prove that Amy is a witch, Buffy, Xander and Willow collect eye of newt and some of Amy's hair during science class, and prove that she has cast a spell. Amy comes home and tells her mother to get with her homework while she goes upstairs with Buffy's bracelet that she stole while Buffy was collecting her hair.

The next morning, a slightly manic Buffy blows her chance at the cheerleading squad when she tosses another girl through the room, ceding her slot to none other than Amy. Buffy turns out to have something more than just a mood disorder: A bloodstone vengeance spell has destroyed her immune system, giving her only about three hours to live. The only way to cure her and break the other spells is to get the witch's spell book. The ailing Buffy and Giles go confront the mother, only to realize that the real Amy is stuck in her mother's middle-aged body while mother is reliving her glory days. Giles finds the witch's book and takes Amy and Buffy back to school to break the spells. Buffy is fading fast.

Amy's mother is cheering Sunnydale's school basketball team when she starts getting flashes of what Giles is trying to do. Xander and Willow are unable to stop her from storming into the science lab with an axe, but buy enough time for Giles to break the spells: Amy and her mother switch bodies again and Buffy feels good enough to fight. However, Amy's mother's power is too great, and it is only by kicking down a steel vent cowling and reflecting her last spell can Buffy win the day; the mother vanishes.

When Amy and Buffy talk in the school hall the next day, they pass by the school's trophy collection where the statue to ""Catherine the Great"" stands. While both girls wonder where Amy's mother ended up, the camera pulls close to the statue's face, revealing the mother's eyes and a muffled voice pleading for help."

He is rudely awakened from this beautiful dream to find himself stuck in the hell known as biology class, and Dr. Gregory is about to call on him.

The only teacher who believes in Buffy, Dr. Gregory, is killed by a monster. The substitute teacher, Natalie French, turns every boy's head, and seems to have a thing about insects, especially the praying mantis. Buffy and Willow just roll their eyes.

Angel shows up at the Bronze, warns Buffy that somebody wants to rip her throat out, gives her his jacket, and vanishes again.Cordelia finds the headless body of Dr. Gregory in the cafeteria locker. The Scoobies try to figure out if there is a connection to the Master, but don't rule out that there is a second monster about. Buffy goes into the park and confronts a vampire who has a large claw in place of a right hand. The fight is interrupted by the police, and the vampire flees. While in pursuit, she sees the vampire come up behind Miss French, who just stares at him. To Buffy's surprise the vampire bolts in panic.

The next day, Buffy is sent to a counselor to help her get over seeing the dead body. This makes her late for the surprise test that Miss French gives the class a test where she helps Xander with a question. Buffy looks through the window in the door, and Miss French turns her head 180 degrees to look at her. Later, Miss French asks Xander over to her house in the evening to work on a project.

Back in the library, Buffy figures that Miss French must be a praying mantis, and convinces the others. Buffy tries to warn Xander, but he brushes her off, saying that she is just jealous.

Miss French welcomes Xander with a drink, a fire in the fireplace, and a tight dress. The drink knocks him out just when she turns into an insect. Xander wakes up in a cage next to another student who tells him how she mates deadly. Willow calls Xander's mother and finds out that he isn't home. Buffy gets Giles to record bat sonar, while Miss French chooses Xander to be her next victim. When the remaining Scoobies visit the house where Miss French is supposed to live, they find a nice old woman who is the real Ms. French, but retired in 1972. To quickly find Xander, Buffy tracks the one-handed vampire, who is so scared of the she-mantis that he knows just which house is the right one. Buffy breaks through the window when the mantis is about to mate with Xander. She slays the insect, using the bat sonar to weaken it.

Buffy, in Angel's jacket, later meets him at the Bronze. He tells her to keep it, and Buffy is obviously smitten. The last scene shows Buffy putting Dr. Gregory's glasses in his closet, but not noticing that there are she-mantis eggs attached to the bottom of a shelf."

And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into hell. As it is written, so it shall be. Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed One shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny.""

Buffy finally gets a datesensitive hunk Owen shows an interest in her. To Giles' exasperation, all Buffy can think about is impressing him with an uncharacteristic interest in the American poet Emily Dickinson. In the school cafeteria, Buffy has to fight off Cordelia to sit at one table with Owen, but it is worth it. He asks Buffy out on a date to The Bronze that very evening.

However, Giles has found out about the prophecy from the symbol on a ring they found in the cemetery. He is convinced that the Anointed One will rise that night, and so despite Buffy's protests, they spend hours sitting on graves waiting for a vampire to rise. None does, however, and though Giles is certain that his calculations are correct, he calls their stakeless stake-out quits. Buffy rushes to The Bronze, only to see Owen dancing with Cordelia. Crushed, she leaves without trying to talk to him.

At the same time, in a van on the way to Sunnydale, a man stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on God's judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the bus, causing it to crash. Other vampires swarm the wreck, attacking the passengers, including the religious man.

The next morning, Owen asks Buffy out on another date that night and even gives her a pocket-watch so that she doesn't miss it this time. Buffy jumps at the opportunity, while Xander is left to stew in his jealousy.

When evening comes, Giles shows up at Buffy's house, waving a newspaper that shows five people died when the van crashed, among them the suspected murderer Andrew Borba, the man who was quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going to the Bronze, though, so Giles decides to check the Sunnydale funeral home himself. Unfortunately, there are vampires present to get the Anointed One, and they trap Giles in a room. Xander and Willow have followed him, though, and run back to The Bronze to get Buffy.

There, first Cordelia, then Angel tries to come in between Buffy and Owen. Finally, Xander and Willow managed to get her to come to the funeral home by pretending to be a couple that wants to do something daring on a double date. When Buffy figures out what has happened, she tries to dump Owen, but unfortunately, he tags along. Even worse, he is present in the funeral home when Borba rises as a vampire. In the fight, Owen is knocked unconscious. Buffy, angry that he has ""killed [her] date,"" kills Borba by sliding him into the furnace while still alive, or rather, still undead.

The next morning, Owen is extremely excited about what they have been through and wants more this is what he likes about Buffy, he says, and almost being killed made him feel alive. She realizes that there is no way that she can have a relationship with him; sooner or later, he will get himself killed. With a heavy heart, she breaks up with him.

Giles tries to comfort her by telling her what a burden it was for him as a ten-year-old to find out his destiny was to be a watcher when he would rather have been a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer. Both agree that at least the Master will be unhappy, too, because the Anointed One was destroyed.

But in his underground lair, the Master is overjoyed as he welcomes the real Anointed One not Borba after all, but a young boy who was on the bus with him."

A gang of four kids taunt and terrorize other students and when one boy does not have the courage to tell Principal Flutie what they have done to him, they ""reward"" him by taking him with them to the Hyena House, even though it is under quarantine. Xander follows to help him, whereas Willow and Buffy are stopped by the zoo warden. He warns the two girls that the animals, fresh from Africa, are said to have special powers. They can even call your name.

In the Hyena House, the hyenas take a flashy-eyed look at the gang of four and Xander. Their eyes flash in return. Only the original victim is spared. None of them notice that they have been standing on a magic symbol of some kind.

Xander is now part of the gang, and his behavior has changed: He is insulting, cruel, tends to scratch himself and smell people. Even more ominous, the school's new mascot piglet, Herbert, tries to flee when it smells Xander. During dodge ball, Xander hits Willow with an excessively hard throw. The game ends with Buffy the last remaining member of her team and Xander, the gang of four and the victim from the Hyena House on the other side. Instead of attacking Buffy, the pack goes for the boy until Buffy steps in. Later, Xander tells Willow in front of the laughing gang that he won't be needing her help any more and is happy he won't have to look in her pasty face ever again. Buffy watches the exchange, but when she confronts him, Xander walks off with the other four, still laughing. Guided by their noses, the five pay a visit to Herbert's cage. Xander suggests lunch and the piglet squeals in terror.

Giles shows no inclination to believe anything is wrong with Xander except that he is a 16-year-old boy. His attitude changes when Herbert is found, eaten. After checking his books, Giles warns that they could be dealing with a case of possession. Buffy runs to find Xander and finds the piglet's cage totally demolished. Xander jumps Buffy, pins her to the floor and tries to assault her sexually. Buffy knocks him unconscious with a desk and locks him in the book cage in the library.

When Principal Flutie finds his pig dead, he knows that the original gang of four are involved and calls them into his office. There, they kill and eat him.

Returning from a teacher's meeting to the library, Giles tells Willow and Buffy about what happened to Principal Flutie. Giles and Buffy go see the zoo warden who tells them that he is not surprised by the possession and knows about the magic involved, but is not sure how the students were affected: he hasn't been able to figure out the ritual. Giles supplies the missing information: A predatory act is required, like when the original four students tormented the boy.

Meanwhile, in the library, Xander tries to sweet-talk his way out of the book cage, but Willow sees through his ruse. The other four pack members break into the library, free Xander, and then all five hunt Willow through the corridors of the school. Cornered in a class room, she is rescued by Buffy and Giles. The five turn away from Buffy, and find an easier target, a family in a car. Buffy drives them off there, too, and offering herself as bait, lures them back to the Hyena House where the warden in full war paint is supposed to perform a reverse of the possession spell with Giles' help. Giles realizes that the warden had tried to call the power for himself, but couldn't figure out how until he learned about the predatory act from Giles. The warden knocks Giles unconscious.

Willow reaches the Hyena House before Buffy, and the warden ties her up and puts a knife to her throat, telling her it is the ""predatory act"" that will trigger the ritual and save the boys. Buffy arrives with the others close behind, and stops when she sees Willow in peril. The pursuing pack knocks her down, and the warden uses this predatory act to shout a spell that pulls the animal spirits from the five students into himself. His eyes flash and he tries to bite Willow. Xander, freed of the spell, sees Willow in danger and tackles the warden. In the fight, Buffy knocks the warden into the hyenas' pen where he is eaten. The gang of four flee. When everything is over, Giles staggers in.

The next day, Xander tells Willow and Buffy he does not remember anything and they shrug the whole episode off with a smile. Giles, walking up to him from behind, points out that he cannot remember reading anything about memory loss during possession in his books, but promises to keep the embarrassed Xander's secret."

Deeming Darla's request to deal with Buffy too personally motivated, the Master decides instead to send ""The Three,"" a trio of warrior vampires, to take the Slayer out. The Three ambush Buffy on her way home from pre-fumigation night at The Bronze. Angel, whom Buffy at first suspects is the (only) one stalking her, shows up at a critical moment, but is wounded helping the Slayer break out of a dicey triple hold. Buffy abandons the fight and helps Angel run to her house, where she yells at him to get inside. With The Three safely on the other side of the door, Angel explains that a vampire can't enter someone's home unless it's invited in. Buffy recalls hearing that, but tells Angel she's never had to put it to the test before.

As Angel removes his jacket and shirt so Buffy can dress his wound, the griffin tattoo on his back is revealed, and Buffy is visibly affected by both his beauty and his proximity. Buffy thanks Angel for his help and asks how he happened to be so close by. Angel, who actually had followed the Slayer from The Bronze, though pleasantly flirtatious, remains evasive. When Buffy's mother comes home from working late, Buffy flies to the front door to be sure Joyce is safe and that no vampires get in, then tries to coax her to go up to bed immediately. Angel foils Buffy's attempt to keep his presence a secret by putting his shirt and jacket back on and coming into the hall to meet Joyce. Buffy claims Angel is a college student tutoring her in history. Once the mildly skeptical Joyce goes upstairs, Buffy pretends to send Angel off, but instead sneaks him up to her bedroom.

Angel says he doesn't want to get her in more trouble, but Buffy replies firmly that she doesn't want to ""get him dead""to which Angel makes no response. They discuss the room's one bed and Angel insists on taking the floor, whereupon Buffy sends him to the window to see whether the ""fang gang"" is still lurking so his back will be turned while she changes. Still trying to figure him out, Buffy asks why Angel, not being The Chosen One, elects to fight vampires. At his non-committal reply, she wonders what his family thinks of his career choice, then looks around at him when he says, ""They're dead."" ""I'm sorry,"" Buffy says, but the conversation is suddenly in murky waters. When she quietly asks if it was vampires, he replies with apparent difficulty, ""It was."" Buffy further theorizes that hunting vampires is some kind of ""vengeance gig"" for him, but with a hint of desperation, Angel changes the subject. Buffy accepts the gambit and they settle down for the night in their respective spots.

When the gang hears about events the next morning, Xander rather illogically protests that Angel is trying to seduce Buffy by saving her life and getting stabbed. Giles identifies the armored vampire trio and reassures everyone that The Three are no longer a threat, since they must offer their lives to the Master in penance for failing their mission. Back at the Hellmouth, the Master allows Darla to execute The Three, as an object lesson in the use of power for Collin, The Anointed One.

Returning to the library later that day, Buffy begins weapons training. She is disappointed when Giles requires her to start with the quarterstaff rather than the ""cool"" crossbow, but easily defeats her Watcher staff-to-staff and progresses to crossbow training much sooner than he anticipates or wishes. Returning home, Buffy brings some supper for Angel, who has waited out the day in her room. Awkwardly attempting small-talk, Buffy asks Angel how he passed the time. Unobtrusively setting aside the food, Angel replies that he did ""a little reading"", a lot of thinking. Buffy notices her diary askew and, suddenly very agitated, begins to explain away entries that reveal her crush on Angel. Clearly amused, but also somewhat at a loss, Angel stops her and explains in turn that Buffy's mother moved the diary while straightening up; Angel swears he didn't read it.

As Buffy takes a moment to deal with her embarrassment, Angel returns to his own agenda and confesses that he doesn't think he should be around her. Completely forgetting the diary incident, Buffy tries to deal with this new shock until it finally registers that Angel has also confessed that all he wants to do is to kiss her. Shocked again, Buffy barely listens as Angel continues to mutter miserably that he's older than she is and that he should go. Buffy looks at Angel with speculation and hope, and her sudden attention rivets his. They take that last half-step toward each other. Angel bends his head to Buffy's upturned face. At first hesitant and sweet, their kiss quickly grows heated and passionate. Suddenly, Angel pulls back with a snarl of distress and Buffy sees his vampiric visage for the first time. She screams in shock and Angel dives out the window, escaping into the darkness without another word. At Buffy's shriek, her mother rushes in and asks what happened, but Buffy glances out the window and says only that she ""saw a shadow."" Bringing her friends up to speed before school the next morning, Buffy wistfully wonders why Angel seems good to her. Emphatically, Giles insists there are no good vampiresa vampire, lacking a soul, is not even a person. Xander urges Buffy to slay Angel.

Returning to his apartment, Angel becomes aware of an intruder, but seems little surprised to see the Master's favorite vampire, Darla. She taunts him, telling him humans will never accept him for who he is, but he replies that he is no longer accepted by vampires, either. Meanwhile, Giles researches Angel's history and notices the peculiarity that even though this vampire was previously well-known as the vicious killer Angelus, Angel apparently has shunned the company of other vampires since coming to America and, stranger yet, has completely stopped preying on humans. Meanwhile, deep in the Master's lair, Darla insists that she be allowed to kill Buffy. The Master concedes upon hearing Darla's diabolical plan to use Angel as her weapon. Later that evening in the library, Willow is having a hard time tutoring Buffy in the history of the Civil War, since they are both distracted by gloom over boysBuffy because she doesn't want to slay Angel and Willow because she wants to attract Xander. Lurking in the stacks, Darla eavesdrops before going to Buffy's house, where she cons Joyce into inviting her in by claiming to be yet another study buddy of Buffy's.

Prowling around Buffy's house himself, Angel hears Joyce's cry and rushes in just as Darla begins to drink from her. Daring him to drink too, Darla shoves the now unconscious Joyce into Angel's arms and escapes out the back door. Deeply tempted by Joyce's warm blood, Angel helplessly vamps, but resists the impulse to drink long enough to be discovered, in flagranté, by the returning Buffy. Horrified, frightened and furious to find Angel apparently feeding from her mother, Buffy literally throws him out of the house, then calls for an ambulance. At the hospital, Buffy, Giles, Willow and Xander try to help ""anemic"" Joyce reconstruct events, and she says her last memory is of inviting Buffy's ""study friend"" inside. Buffy misunderstands, thinking Joyce means Angel rather than Darla. Leaving her mother in the care of friends and doctors, Buffy races to the library, takes the crossbow from the weapons locker, and storms out into the night. At Angel's apartment, Darla works him into a fury, telling him how easy it was to poison Buffy against him, exhorting him to kill or be killed.

Meanwhile, Giles talks further with Joyce and learns enough to realize that it was Darla, not Angel, who bit Buffy's mom. With Xander and Willow in tow, he rushes to find Buffy to warn her of the trap. Alone in the dark, Buffy tracks Angel to the deserted Bronze and engages him in combat. Angel soon tackles and disarms Buffy, but she retrieves her weapon and fires before he can recover his balance. To Angel's surprise, the Slayer intentionally shoots wide and her bolt thunks into the wall beside his head. When she demands an explanation for his actions, particularly why he spared her but not her mom, Angel mockingly recounts highlights from his Angelus days. When the Slayer asks what changed, Angel more quietly tells her the story of the beautiful Gypsy girl he once ate, whose family cursed him in retribution. The Gypsies gave him a soul that would wrack him with guilt, eternally tormenting him for the evil he had wreaked during a century and more of unbridled vampirism.

Angel doesn't try to justify himself, but the Slayer begins to understand that he is unique among vampires, and that this is what she had sensed from the beginning. When he denies biting Joyce, yet confesses wanting to, as well as wanting to kill Buffy herself, the Slayer lays aside her crossbow and slowly offers her throat to a now utterly motionless Angel. Suddenly, Darla emerges from the shadows and starts to taunt them, boasting to Buffy that she, Darla, was the vampire who turned Angel all those decades ago. When Buffy levels her crossbow, Darla pulls out a pair of handguns and fires. Hit, Angel crumples to the floor. Buffy dives for cover behind the bar and looses a bolt that hits Darla's chest but misses her heart. Hearing gunfire, Giles, Willow and Xander rush in and distract Darla, shouting to Buffy that it was Darla who bit Joyce, not Angel. As Darla gleefully blazes away, keeping the Slayer and her friends pinned down, the wounded Angel suddenly lunges toward the wall and yanks out the crossbow bolt that missed his head earlier. Looming up from behind, Angel stakes Darla through the heart with Buffy's bolt, dusting his maker in the witness of all.

In their Hellmouth lair, Collin consoles the Master for his loss of Darla at Angel's hands. Once again at the Bronze, now post-fumigation, Willow, Xander and Buffy comment on how much, and how little, has changed since their last outing. Spying Angel across the crowded room, Buffy goes to thank himand to tell him goodbye. Helpless in the heat of their burgeoning passion for one another, their banter trails to silence and they deeply kiss one last time. As she reluctantly pulls away, Buffy doesn't notice that the cross she's wearingthe one Angel gave her weeks ago at their very first meeting in the alley right out backwas severely scorching him, branding the skin of his chest all during their embrace. Angel, who neither vamped nor flinched as he slowly kissed the Slayer, faintly winces but never says a word as he watches her walk away."

Posey'],"['', '', '']",[],"['pc', 'computer', 'internet', 'pigtails']",[],"The episode begins in a castle in Cortona, Italy, in 1418. We see Carlo, a young Italian man, looking at Moloch, a lizard-looking demon, his master. Moloch promises Carlo everything if he gives Moloch his love, and as Carlo promises his love, Moloch kills him. In a church, a few priests form the sacred circle of Kayless to trap Moloch in a book. The book is sealed in a box, with the head priest expressing his hope that the book will not be read, or the demon Moloch will once again walk the world. The scene cuts to Buffy opening the box in which the book is kept, and is told by Giles to put it in a pile. Ms. Calendar and Giles trade jibes about the need for modern technology. As the class leaves, Willow tries to convince Xander to help her scan. As he leaves, she scans in the book Moloch is trapped in. As Willow leaves, the text ""Where am I?"" is displayed on the computer screen.

A week later, at school, Buffy questions Willow about her missing a few classes. Willow confides she has an online relationship with a boy named Malcolm. As Buffy tries to warn Willow about the dangers of rushing into a relationship with someone she has not seen, Fritz (a computer geek) is instructed by Moloch, via the computer he is working on, to keep watch on Buffy. Ms. Calendar questions Fritz about the unusual amount of time he and Dave are spending on the computer, and receives an ambiguous answer. Later, when Xander asks Willow if she will accompany him to the Bronze, she passes, wanting to talk to Malcolm. Buffy accuses Xander of jealousy, and Xander denies vehemently, claiming he is just worried about Willow, because they have no idea if Malcolm is who he says he is. The scene cuts to Fritz mumbling ""I'm jacked in"" as he scars himself in the form of the letter ""M"". As Willow is late on the next day, Buffy finds that she blew off classes to talk to ""Malcolm"". When Buffy asks Dave for help finding out Malcolm's real identity, his angry response causes her to think that he is Malcolm. When Buffy asks Giles for help, he confesses he cannot help her much as he finds technology to be intimidating. His only idea is for Buffy to follow Dave. As Buffy follows him to the CRD building, a security camera points at her, and a message appears on a computer screen Fritz is looking at: ""kill her"".

When Buffy goes back to Giles and Xander, Xander unexpectedly knows that CRD is ""Calax Research and Development"", a hi-tech company which shut down. When Xander assures Buffy that it is suspicious since he would know if CRD re-opened, they decide to break in. When Ms. Calendar interrupts them, Xander and Buffy leave. Willow becomes suspicious of Malcolm after she learns that he knows Buffy was kicked out of her old school, and logs off the conversation. Back at the library, Giles's and Ms. Calendar's verbal sparring leads them to discover that Moloch's book is empty.

Outside of school, Dave tells Buffy that Willow wants to talk to her in the girl's locker room, as a plot to electrocute Buffy. Dave changes his mind at the last minute, and his warning, combined with Buffy's slayer reflexes, save her. When Moloch hears of it, he begins writing Dave's suicide note on the computer and Fritz kills Dave. Buffy, Xander and Giles reconvene in the library, where Giles gives the exposition on how books were used to imprison demons, but if the books were read, the demons were set free. Together, they realize that Moloch has gotten into the internet - the scanning of his book being close enough to ""reading"" it to set him free - and is wreaking havoc from there. When Buffy tries to delete the ""Moloch"" file, his face appears and tell her to stay away from Willow, and Buffy realizes Malcolm is Moloch.

Buffy and Giles explain that there is no limit to the amount of damage a demon in the internet can do. After they find Dave's body, Xander and Buffy go to Willow's house, and Buffy tells Giles to ask Ms. Calendar for help, hoping that between his knowledge of demons and her knowledge of computers, they can trap Moloch back into the book. Willow is kidnapped by Fritz. At the library, Giles is surprised that Ms. Calendar understands demons, as she is a ""techno-pagan"". Buffy and Xander, guessing that Moloch had Willow kidnapped, rush off to CRD. Buffy calls Giles, and they co-ordinate plans. Inside CRD, Moloch's robotic body is prepared, and he is happy to see Willow. Moloch kills Fritz as a demonstration of his power. Buffy and Xander break into CRD as Giles and Ms. Calendar start preparing the binding spell. The binding spell does not complete, but casts Moloch out of the internet and traps him inside his robotic body. Moloch crashes through a wall and backhands Xander, but Willow hits Moloch with a fire extinguisher. As Moloch tries to kill Buffy, he punches an electrical power line and dies.

The next day, Buffy, Willow and Xander joke about how the Hellmouth is screwing with their love lives, laughing about how none of them will ever find true happiness, then looking decidedly unhappy at the thought."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0533507/?ref_=ttep_ep9,,Buffy suspects that a ventriloquist's dummy may be harvesting organs from classmates performing in a talent show.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Ellen S. Pressman'],"['', '', '']",[],"['reference to the usual suspects', 'tied up', 'man tied up', ""ventriloquist's dummy"", 'library']",[],"The episode begins with a typical horror-movie shot from the POV of the villain, seeing a ballet dancer (Emily) as a demonic voice whispers ""I will be whole"". Cordelia is singing Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Love Of All"" off key, as part of the try outs for the talent show. Giles stops her, obviously to stop his ears from hurting. Buffy, Xander and Willow join Giles, and mock him as he complains that the new Principal (which he refers to as the Führer) put him in charge of the talent show, despite his wishes, so he could have more contact with the students. As Snyder overhears the Scoobies making fun of Giles, he punishes them by forcing them to participate in the talent show. The next try-out is Morgan and his dummy, Sid, and Buffy confesses to being freaked out by dummies. Morgan's act takes a sudden turn for the better when Sid suddenly develops a personality and starts making sarcastic comments about the act. The scene cuts to Emily, who notices the demon (unseen by the audience watching her) and screams.

The talent show rehearsals continue with Marc, an unsuccessful magician. Buffy, Willow and Xander debate what to do for the talent show, and settle on a dramatic scene, since it does not require any actual talent. Sid watches, and makes rude comments as Morgan explains the voice is an imitation of his father. Snyder explains to Giles that he will run a safer, more disciplined school, only to be interrupted by the discovery of Emily's body, whose heart has been cut out with a knife. The Scoobies debate whether the killer is a demon or a human, eliciting Willow's comment that a human murderer is scarier since it could be anyone, even her.

The Scoobies split up and begin interviewing people from the talent show to find the killer. In a quick montage of the interviews, they all point in the direction of Morgan and his dummy, Sid. They decide to check Morgan's locker after school hours. As Buffy is busy breaking into Morgan's locker, and finding nothing, Snyder finds her almost red-handed, and admonishes her for being in the school after hours. Morgan and Sid turn out to be hiding, watching Buffy. Sid tells Morgan that Buffy is ""the one"", saying that her strength is evidence of it.

As Buffy goes to sleep, Sid waits until the lights are off and sneaks into her room. When she wakes up, he quickly scampers out. Naturally, Buffy has a hard time convincing the Scoobies that Sid broke into her room. Giles, on his part, suggests that the demon responsible might be needing the heart (and later, a brain) to keep a human guise, which means the demon could be anyone, once again. When a teacher confiscates Sid, Xander steals him so that Buffy can talk to Morgan alone. As Buffy searches for Morgan back-stage, Snyder is again displeased with her being where he does not think she belongs.

In the library, just as Willow finds references to another possible explanation animated dummies might harvest organs to become humans, Sid is gone when Xander stops paying any attention to him. The scene cuts to Buffy, finding Morgan's body, missing a brain, just as a chandelier falls on her. When she wakes up, Sid attacks her, and during their fight they realize they are both working for the same goal: to stop the demon.

Sid explains he is a demon hunter, cursed to dummy form until he kills the last of the Brotherhood of Seven, those demons which harvest a heart and a brain. Realizing the demon has what it needs, they theorize it will be moving on, and so it will be whomever is missing from the show. Sid suggests to Giles to form a ""power circle"" to find out who is missing, but Giles sees everyone there. When Sid is again missing, Buffy finds Morgan's brain when she looks for him. Buffy, Willow and Xander discover Morgan had brain cancer which is probably the reason the demon did not use his brain, and is now looking for someone smart. This means that Giles and Willow are in danger.

At the talent show, Marc the magician tricks Giles into strapping himself into a guillotine, ostensibly a magic prop, so that he can take his scalp off and get his brain. Buffy, Xander and Willow rush to rescue Giles, and with Sid's help, they manage to kill Marc, who was the demon all along, and save Giles just as the curtain goes up. Everyone assumes it is part of the show, though there is only minimal clapping. The episode ends with Buffy, Xander and Willow performing a scene from Oedipus Rex with remarkable lack of talent, and with Willow running away from the stage."

Her mother shakes Buffy awake and, as Buffy wakes up, she is excited to be spending the coming weekend with her father. Buffy confides to Willow that she thinks she might have something to do with her parents' divorce. In a class, when the teacher asks Wendell to read from the text book, Tarantulas crawl out of it. Buffy sees a young boy standing in the door way, saying he is sorry.

The next day, as the Master explains to Collin, the Anointed One, how wonderful he finds fear, Buffy is nervous about being picked up by her father after school and her mother calms her down. At school, Willow and Xander are worried about the spiders and want to talk to Giles about it. Giles mutters that he ""got lost"" in the stacks of books, and we assume that is something that he fears will happen to him. Giles has no information on the spiders and suggests talking to Wendell. Wendell explains that he loves spiders, but that the spiders hate him because his brother killed his pet spiders when he was off to camp. He explains that the spiders crawling out is a recurring nightmare for him, but this is the first time it actually happened. In the meantime, Cordelia lets Buffy know about a history test that Buffy has not studied for. Buffy has a hard time even finding the class and the test is over in what feels like little time and Buffy has not even filled in her name. She once again sees the young boy outside the classroom. As break-time begins, Laura takes a smoking break in the basement where she is assaulted by an ugly man saying ""Lucky nineteen"".

Buffy and Giles interview Laura in the hospital, where they hear about ""lucky nineteen"". Outside, they are shocked by the doctor saying that she got off easy until the doctor explains about a young boy, Billy, who has been in a coma from assault with the same M.O. Back at school the Scoobies are trying to come up with an explanation as a cool kid's mother embarrasses him in front of his friends. As they are talking, Willow and Xander enter a class room only to find that Xander is now only in his underwear. As Buffy goes into the library to consult with Giles, he says that he has forgotten how to read. He has, however, managed to find a newspaper with a picture of Billy in an article. The article says Billy has been in a coma for a week. But Buffy recognizes Billy as the young boy she has been seeing that day. Giles theorizes she might have been seeing Billy's astral projection.

Buffy's father shows up, and asks to talk to her. Outside school, he tells Buffy that her parents' divorce is, indeed, her fault. Furthermore, he claims to be bored by their weekends together and decides to call the whole thing off. As Buffy is crying, he scolds her. Xander and Willow show up in the library and they realize Wendell's, Giles's and Xander's mishaps were all based on their nightmares, which seem to be coming true for everyone. Buffy finds Billy's astral body and the ugly man, who assaulted Laura, finds both of them.

As Buffy and Billy run away, the Scoobies decide to find Buffy and explain the situation to her. As Buffy and Billy run away from the ugly man, Billy explains to her that he was responsible for his baseball team losing and that it is a bad thing to lose at games. As Buffy and Billy find themselves in the cemetery at night-time, Willow finds herself starring in the Madame Butterfly opera. Willow is overcome by stage fright and runs away. Xander is chasing chocolate bar after chocolate bar until he finds one he has not had since his sixth birthday, only to be assaulted by a knife-wielding clown. Back at the cemetery, the Master buries Buffy alive.

Still chased by the clown, Xander teams up with Willow and Giles. He decides to confront the clown, punching him and feeling liberated. As Willow, Xander and Giles find Buffy's grave, Giles claims it is his nightmare, letting Buffy die. Buffy crawls out of the grave a vampire. They all decide to wake up Billy from his coma to stop the nightmares. In the hospital, they find Billy's astral body near Billy's comatose body. As the ugly man finds him, Buffy confronts him. After knocking him out, she forces Billy to face him. Billy wakes up and everything is back to normal.

As Billy's Little League coach shows up, it is obvious he is the inspiration for the ugly man and that it was he who put Billy into a coma after they lost the game. He tries to run after Buffy confronts him but is stopped by Giles and Xander and put into jail. The episode ends when Buffy and her father leave for their weekend together."

Buffy makes up an excuse about borrowing it from Giles for a history project.

In English class, Cordelia comments that in The Merchant of Venice, Shylock is self-involved and whiny. She likens it to a bicycle rider she ran over; the girl whined about her pain and ignored Cordelia's traumatic experience. The teacher was agreeable to the viewpoint. After class, Cordelia arranges to meet with the teacher the next day to talk about her paper.

In the boys' locker room, Mitch, Cordelia's boyfriend, is attacked by a baseball bat. Cordelia is outside campaigning for May Queen, while Xander and Willow mock Cordelia, referring to a past Buffy did not share. Buffy feels left out and explains that she was the May Queen at her old school. The conversation ends when they hear that Mitch was beaten and taken to the hospital. Buffy slips into the boys' locker room to find the word ""LOOK"" spray-painted on the lockers.

At the library, the Scoobies are stumped. They suspect a ghost. Meanwhile, Harmony asks Cordelia about Mitch's condition. Cordelia explains that he is alright but looking too bruised for the prom pictures. In a flashback, we see Cordelia and Harmony talking about Mitch's recent break-up with Wendy, and whether Cordelia would like to be his girlfriend. In the present, Harmony is pushed down the stairs and injures her ankle by the invisible force, as Buffy approaches. Principal Snyder arrives and Buffy's friends must distract him from Buffy, who runs off to follow an invisible source of laughter. The invisible thing bumps into Buffy before escaping. This is not a ghost. Xander suggests a cloak of invisibility worn by the Greek gods. Buffy dismisses the theory because of the pettiness of the crimes. As the Scoobies disperse, Buffy follows the sound of a flute. In the library, Giles is surprised by Angel, who offers to get a book of prophecies, the Pergamum Codex. Another flashback sequence sees Cordelia and Harmony discussing a lecture and ignoring another girl, Marcie. In the present, Cordelia wins the May Queen award. Looking over Willow's list of missing kids, Buffy suspects Marcie when she sees she played the flute. Tracking Marcie, Buffy finds her hideout just as Marcie finds Ms. Miller, Cordelia's literature teacher, and chokes her with a plastic bag. Cordelia, arriving a short while afterwards, saves Ms. Miller. An invisible hand writes ""LISTEN"" on the blackboard.

As Willow looks over Marcie's yearbook, she sees it is full of the generic ""Have a nice summer!"" greeting, showing nobody actually knew Marcie. She is horrified to find her own greeting to Marcie, ""Have a great summer!"". Giles realizes that Marcie became invisible because nobody ever noticed her. In a flashback sequence, we see Marcie being ignored in class, and becoming invisible. As the Scoobies realize that Marcie really is after Cordelia, the latter walks into the library asking Buffy for help. They decide to use Cordelia as bait and to have Buffy body-guarding her. As Cordelia is getting dressed, she confides in Buffy that she is lonely, too, but being popular ""beats being lonely by yourself."" Marcie lures Willow, Xander and Giles into the boiler room where she closes the door and opens the gas. Then goes and grabs Cordelia as she is changing. Buffy follows Cordelia and finds her unconscious. Marcie surprises Buffy, kicking her and knocking her out.

Buffy wakes up, finding herself tied to a chair near Cordelia, similarly indisposed. They see the word ""LEARN"" on a curtain, and Marcie explains that Cordelia is the lesson, or will be when she makes a mockery of Cordelia's face by surgery. Buffy kicks the instrument tray at Marcie and frees herself from the ropes. Angel rescues the Scoobies and shuts off the gas. Buffy concentrates, listening to Marcie and knocks her into a curtain before knocking her out. Two FBI agents arrive to haul Marcie away. Cordelia comes by the day after the coronation to thank them for helping her, much to their surprise, though her reaction when Mitch arrives shows she is not ready to renounce her popularity. Meanwhile, Marcie is taken to a school full of invisible students by the FBI. She sits down in class and opens her textbook. The title reads ""Assassination and Infiltration"" (as an apparent in-joke from the production team, the text on the page contains the lyrics to the Beatles' White Album song ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"") to which the now-homicidal Marcie chuckles and says, ""Cool.""."

Buffy explains the vampires are rising in number and getting braver, but Giles is distracted by his thoughts. After biology class, Willow finds an excuse to leave, leaving Xander to ask Buffy to the prom. Xander takes Buffy's rejection badly and walks off to wallow in misery.

Jenny Calendar interrupts Giles' study in the library, telling him that she sees apocalyptic portents and demands to know what is happening. She tells him brother Luca, a monk in Cortona, is e-mailing her about the Anointed One. Giles asks her to get more information about this, promising he will explain everything later. In the school hall, Kevin and Willow promise to help Cordelia set everything up in the Bronze for the dance. Willow sees Xander wallowing in his misery and offers sympathy. When Xander asks her to the dance, she refuses to be his second choice.

That evening, as Buffy enters the library, she hears Giles telling Angel that the prophecies say that she will face the Master and die. Buffy, shocked, yells that she is quitting, leaving the cross Angel gave her on the table. She goes back home, and tries to convince her mother to go away for the weekend.

Xander leaves, only to show up at Angel's apartment where he forces Angel to lead him to the Master's lair. Xander and Angel approach the lair as the Master and Buffy fight and taunt each other. The Master tells Buffy that it is her blood which will free him, as he drinks from her and leave her to drown in a shallow pool. At the library, Willow and Jenny Calendar decide that the Hellmouth is underneath the Bronze and leave. However, as they leave, they see an army of vampires approaching the school. Cordelia rescues them in her car and drives the car straight into the school towards the library. Xander and Angel reach Buffy and Xander performs CPR (as Angel couldn't do it himself, because vampires do not breathe). When Buffy regains consciousness, she heads to the surface to kill the Master. Cordelia, Willow, Giles and Jenny fight off vampires trying to enter the library and just as Giles realizes that the Hellmouth is directly underneath the library, a tentacled creature rises through the floor.

Weide'],[''],[],"['reference to gary cooper', 'reference to sophia loren']",[],"Larry (Larry David) has bought new pants, which leave a tent in front of his crotch. The tent makes it look like Larry is having an erection. Larry wants to watch the new Dustin Hoffman movie. Cheryl (Cheryl Hines) has Yoga and won't put it off to watch a movie with Larry. Larry calls Richard Lewis (Richard Lewis), who is going to the movie with his date & won't invite Larry to join them. In the premier episode, Larry jokingly refers to his wife Cheryl as ""Hitler"", offending his manager Jeff Green's (Jeff Garlin) conservative Hebrew parents (Jeff was on the speaker phone while driving in his car and his parents were in the car with him). This makes things bad as now Jeff can't go to the movies with Larry.

Since Jeff can't go to the movies with Larry, Cheryl sets Larry up with a friend of hers Nancy (Robin Ruzan), to go to the movies with him. In the theatre, Larry has a fight with a sexy woman, before getting to his seat. The sexy girl turns out to be Richard Lewis's date Sophia. When Larry sits, he has the trouser tent & Nancy thinks he has an erection from his fight with Richard Lewis's girlfriend. Later, Larry refuses a coffee invitation from Richard, without Richard knowing that Sophia and Larry had a fight earlier that night. Richard, Sophia, Larry and Cheryl have a dinner date planned on the coming weekend.

Larry tells Cheryl how Nancy might have felt that she got him aroused due to the trouser tent. That night Cheryl tells Larry that Jeff left a message that just said, ""I am sorry"". Larry didn't want to admit the truth to Cheryl (that he called her Hitler & Jeff's parents heard it), so he says that he doesn't know why Jeff left that message. Larry also tells Cheryl about the SNAFU with Sophia and asks her to cancel the joint dinner date with Richard & Sophia.

Next day Larry tells Jeff to tell Cheryl that he left that message because he told Cathy Griffin that Larry could not write a screenplay for her, without checking with Larry. Jeff's parents have asked him to drop Larry as a client, so Jeff begs Larry to have dinner with his parents and apologize to them. Richard comes over to Larry's office & is angry at him for ruining things with Sophia. Richard wants Larry to apologize to Sophia at their dinner together, which Larry refuses to go to.

Larry goes over to Jeff's & apologizes to his parents. He gets home, where Cheryl has invited Nancy to explain that Larry didn't have a hard on. But Nancy insists that she was rubbing Larry's arm & he got a hard on. Cheryl is upset that Larry didn't tell her the whole story. Nancy storms out when Larry denies that he had a hard on.

That night they go for dinner (Larry & Cheryl) and run into Jeff & his parents. Larry can't get a table as he has a reservation for 4 (with Richard and Sophia), & the hostess wont seat 2. Jeff asks Larry & Cheryl to join them but says that his parents are still upset because Larry didn't wait to see their daughter's child, when she offered to. At dinner, Cathy Griffin walks up to the table, and it is revealed in conversation that Cathy never spoke to Jeff. Larry is caught in his web of lies."

They also invite Larry & Cheryl to their Paul Simon concert where they have a luxury box, but it ends badly when Larry accuses the bowling alley of misplacing his sneakers. The alley shoe manager admits to giving Larry's shoes to someone else by mistake & asks for his contact info. The shoe manager promises to return Larry's shoes to him.

Larry is thrilled to get the Paul Simon seats but thinks that Ted has the tendency to classify everything as ""heaven"" a tad too quickly. Larry also laments the fact that he can't be friends with Mary, with both being married and all. He says that society frowns on a relationship between a man and a woman in that way. Cheryl gives Larry her permission to be friends with Mary. Larry says that the concert is on Friday as he heard Ted talk to Mary about the same.

Later, Ted gets the wrong idea about Larry when he goes shopping with Mary at a downtown department store. Larry had called to thank Mary for the concert tickets but ended up going sweater shopping with her. Mary has brought her mom (Anne Haney). Larry ends up buying the same jacket that Mary is wearing. Then Larry spots a shoe store and wants to buy the same pair of shoes that he lost at the alley. The salesman doesn't have Larry's size, so orders one specially for him. Larry claims to Mary and her mother that he loves to shop.

Later at lunch, Larry has a coughing fit when Mary's mom mentions that the glass, he is drinking from is hers. This gives the impression is that somehow Larry is disgusted by drinking the same water as Mary's mother. Cheryl is a little angry that Larry went shopping with Mary, as she has never been able to get Larry to go shopping with her. Ted comes by and says that Larry and Mary switched their shopping bags. Cheryl learns that Larry bought the exact same jacket as Mary.

Larry never gets the concert tickets from Ted & Mary. He gets a call from the bowling alley shoe manager, who tells Larry that the guy who has his shoes has just returned to the alley. Larry goes to the alley to confront the guy and asks him to return his shoes back. Larry yells at him for taking shoes that didn't belong to him. Larry then gets his shoes cleaned and fumigated and wears them. Then Larry runs into the salesman (where he ordered the new shoes) & the salesman sees Larry wearing the exact same shoes that he ordered. He thinks that Larry stiffed him.

Its Friday 4 30 pm. The concert starts in a few hours & Larry still doesn't have the tickets from Ted. He tells Cheryl that maybe the coughing fit is what offended Ted & Mary.

The next day Larry goes to the store to return the jacket he bought. He runs into Mary & her mother. Mary clarifies that the Paul Simon concert is on Sunday (not Friday) and that the David's are still invited. Finally on the night of the concert, Larry shows up (without Cheryl) only to find that Ted & Mary haven't come (they had relatives flying in at the last moment). So, its Larry & Mary's mom at the concert."

A bizarre chain of events finds Larry having dinner with a porno star Gil (Bob Odenkirk). Larry wants to dial his friend John but picks the wrong number from the address book and ends up getting a dinner invite for a party at Gil's house. Cheryl is not happy about the dinner party as they had their own plans for Saturday night. Gil used to be a porn actor 15 years ago.

So, to make up for it, Larry's secretary Antoinette (Antoinette Spolar) suggests that he buy Cheryl a present to make up for it.

Larry walks over to the Jewellery store, but is unshaven, in old clothes & looks like a bum. The store girl think he is homeless and refuse him entry into the store. Larry has his eyes on a bracelet that he saw in the jewelry shop window.

Larry asks Richard Lewis to come down to the Jewelry store and meet him. Larry asks Richard to buy the bracelet on his behalf. The store is closed for lunch. Richard is hungry.

At Lunch, Larry finds that the check has spaces for 2 tips (waiter and captain). Larry is disgusted as he doesn't think that the captain has added any value. He gives the waiter a generous tip but gives the captain nothing. Richard had argued that the captain should get half of what the waiters get. Larry gives 20% to the waiters but is reluctant to go to 30% to tip both the waiter and the captain and doesn't believe that cutting the allotment from the waiters to give to the captain is fair either.

That lady signs in first & is thus seen by the doctor first even though her appointment was after Larry's. Larry complains about this to the nurses and when he gets agitated, he is denied his doctor's appointment for the next 45 mins. Larry protests that due to the office policy there is no point in giving appointments as it should be first come first served. The doctor (Jack Gallagher) tells Larry that his finger is fine, which was injured after the scuffle with Richard. He lets Larry go without any charges.

Of course, this causes him to miss an appointment with Diane Keaton (who has read Larry's script and wants to do a show with him). Larry doesn't have $3 cash to pay the parking attendant & promises to pay her back $5 on Friday (as he comes back again to meet his lawyer and his doctor) if she allows Larry to leave. Larry is late for a meeting with Diane, and she leaves. Jeff tells Larry that Diane won't do a show with anyone who doesn't respect her time.

Cheryl hires an interior decorator (Rose Abdoo) who also happens to be Diane Keaton's. Diane had left a number on Larry's machine, but due to a signal fade, the last few digits were not understandable. Larry wanted to get the phone number and call Diane to apologize, explain the delay and set up another appointment. The decorator won't give Larry Keaton's phone number to maintain her client's privacy. Larry argues this is senseless as the decorator heard Diane leave a message on Larry's machine and hence there is no breach of privacy. Hence Larry could not return the call & now Diane is offended. Larry fires his interior designer.

Larry meets his lawyer (Nia Vardalos) (who is the wife of the doctor), who has billed Larry $1500 for reading his script. Larry is not ready to pay as he never asked her to read the script. Larry fires his lawyer on the spot. While entering the lawyers building, Larry had paid $10 to a male parking attendant, asking him to give the money to the female parking attendant when she comes on shift. But while exiting, the lady parking attendant confronts Larry & even though Larry tells her that he gave her male colleague $10, she makes him pay $20 (his last $20).

Now at the exit, Larry is again out of money, and asks the male attendant for his $10 back. The guy refuses, and Larry has to borrow $3 from his recently sacked Lawyer to exit the parking. He is again 30 mins late for the next meeting with Diane. As Larry is waiting, he again runs into his interior designer, who fights Larry for firing her & wants him to pay her regardless. They get into fisticuffs and break Diane's lamp, which was very familiar to the lamp that Larry broke at Gil's house.

Now Larry has to visit the doctor again & has to park outside the building. Runs into the same lady again, & fights with her to get to the doctor's office first, only to find that they still see the lady first, as they changed office policy to see people on the basis of their appointment time, basis Larry's last outrage.

The doctor refuses to treat Larry for his condition, unless Larry pays his wife's bill and his bill in advance. Larry has to fork out his credit card."

The last remaining neighbors meet the Davids. They hear Jeff's camping message on David's answering machine. Since the husband Dean (Wayne Federman) is a lawyer, he offers to help Jeff. The wife (Phyllis (Lucy Webb)) says that Dean is a big fan of Julia Louise Dryfus. Dean expresses a desire to meet her (at their own home) when she visits the Davids next. Dean had indicated that he will not sign the papers unless he gets the meeting with Julia. Larry is furious. He would rather move than call Julia for this favor. Cheryl says Julia will perhaps not mind and it would make her house perfect.

Jeff tells Larry that Dean is not a competent lawyer. Larry wants Jeff to stick with Dean since Larry wants to get rid of the wire in his backyard. Jeff also tells Larry that the kid doesn't want to go home early from camp & expressed a desire to stay at Jeff's for a couple of days. Larry advises against that.

Larry makes the call to Julia to agrees to go to his neighbor's house, but when they visit (after making an appointment with Dean), the wife's (Phyllis) cat has died & she is inconsolable. Julia had to go in 10 mins, but the wife simply won't let her. Dean is not even home, as he is with Jeff. Dean had told Phyllis that he is 25 minutes away and not to let Julia leave. Larry calls Jeff after 15 minutes to find that Dean is still with him. Meanwhile Julia finds that Phyllis is an antique jewelry collector & finds a bracelet that she loves & buys it from Phyllis.

Larry has lost has pad, where he writes his ideas. He thinks he left it at Julia's. He calls her late, goes over to her house, searches the kitchen & the office & messes stuff up and wakes her kid. He is kicked out of her house. The episode argues whether 10 pm is the cut off time for late night calls. Cheryl and Jeff say it is 10 pm, while Larry thought it was 10:30 pm. Julia argues that the cut off is 9:30 pm.

Meanwhile the kid that Jeff let into his house, has stolen everything & now Jeff's wife is hysterical and blames Larry for setting them up with Dean.

Cheryl has bought the same bracelet (that Larry wanted to buy for her), from a jewelry store and gives it to Larry, who drops it in the key holder. Now Julia comes over and says that her bracelet is missing & finds it sitting in Larry's key holder. Now Dean comes over & Julia tears him apart for not keeping the appointment with her at their last meeting & walks out.

Dean refuses to consider that as a meeting with Julia. Larry is about to kick him out, when Dean produces Larry's pad, and asks for the $500 reward which was written on the pad, for returning the pad to Larry. Larry gives the $500 to Dean, & the wire stays."

But Larry is offended when at dinner, the mechanic sits at the head of the table (the position, Larry believes, is reserved for the head of the house). Mike makes everyone say a Holy prayer before starting dinner. Besides that, the event is very well catered, and Cheryl admits to Larry that Jeff's neighbor did a great job.

Cheryl thinks that she mentioned to someone at the party that she doesn't like people staying over at her Martha Vineyard's house & later found that Mike & his wife were planning to go to Martha's Vineyard. Cheryl says that Mike and wife might have felt that she was trying to tell them indirectly that they are not welcome in their house at Martha's Vineyard.

Cheryl says that she will cancel her check if she does not get the leftover food back. Larry confronts the caterer about a lot of missing food, which she claims she has given to a homeless shelter, but in reality, she had only given it to Jeff. Larry learns this when the caterer's maid comes back and tells her that she has dropped the food at Jeff's, while Larry was talking to her. Jeff knew that the caterer stole Larry's leftovers.

Also, Haley and Nathan grow closer until Brooke spreads a vicious rumor that leaves Haley devastated.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Robert Duncan McNeill'],"['', '', '']",[],"['undressing', 'locker room']",[],"Tree Hill High is abuzz about the evening that Dan (Paul Johannson) and Nathan (James Lafferty) are holding at their household. All the Ravens have been invited, as well as all the cheerleaders. Everyone seems to be going, except Lucas (Chad Michael Murray). When he tells this to Peyton (Hilarie Burton), she begins to flirt with him, telling him about a book she read exactly like their lives. But in order to find out the ending, he has to go tonight. Meanwhile, Nathan is being tutored by Haley (Bethany Joy Lenz). Mentioning the event, he realizes he hasn't invited her and feeling guilty, apologizes but can't invite her as it is only for basketball. Haley isn't really bothered but wants him to do some studying and gives him a revision kit with everything in and tells him just to contact her if he needs any help. At the cafe, the event seems to be discussed all over Tree Hill with the adults too as Karen (Moira Kelly) and Keith (Craig Sheffer) are talking about it. After they both have received invites, the two wonder whether they should go or not. Keith is quite adamant that he is not going to his brother's do, but Karen is undecided. That is, until Deb (Barbara Alynn Woods) walks in. She asks and persuades the two adults to go, Karen gives in and changes her mind. Keith, however, thinks it will be too weird and tells Karen it's because of what he told her the night before. Karen then pretends she knows nothing about the whole situation, subtly telling Keith that she has forgotten all about and not to worry about it. In class, Brooke begins her normal routine- stirring up others' relationships. She tells Nathan that Peyton is still interested in him. At practice, Jake (Byran Greenburg) arrives late as he normally does and Whitey (Barry Corbin) just lets it go without any questions. Lucas asks him, why he is always late, but Jake remains silent. On the way home, Peyton offers Haley a lift home where they have yet another conversation about the Scott brothers. When Haley told Peyton that he cares about her, Peyton asks who, and Haley replies both of them. Also, like the previous two times the girls have spent together, Peyton tells Haley to be careful, a comment Haley is sick of hearing. At the night of the event, Lucas changes his mind and decides to go with Karen and Keith, who has also changed his mind. Just before they set off together and leave Haley in the cafe, she tells Lucas she likes Nathan and that it isn't her fault, like it isn't his fault he likes Peyton. Still unhappy, Lucas is forced to be okay with it but tells her to be careful, just like Peyton. At Peyton's house, Brooke tells her that Nathan is still interested in her. It could possibly just be working the situation so she can get Lucas. At Dan's house, Deb tells him that Karen and Keith are coming. Dan sees it as a nightmare and just a way for them to ruin his night. The doorbell goes and Karen, Keith and Lucas are waiting to be let in. They plan to make a signal 'coo' if they need to escape. Karen just tells them to stay away from Dan and they'll be fine, that is until Dan answers the door and the four are left to stare at each other. Once they have been invited in and Dan has given a speech about the Ravens, Whitey tells Karen that he is glad to see her, reminding him of previous years. He also tells her how well she has raised Lucas and that she should be proud. Meanwhile, Jake is encouraging Lucas to go and talk to Peyton, but Brooke soon interrupts their conversation in order to flirt with Lucas. As Brooke is talking to Lucas, Nathan goes to talk to Peyton, asking to go somewhere more privately to discuss them. Lucas views this as them two getting back together, making him storm off. As Peyton and Nathan begin talking, they find out that Brooke has set them up to get back together and are both furious that they have believed her. Both of them have a go at Brooke as she walks in and leave her alone in Nathan's room. Brooke then begins rummaging through the drawers to find some more alcohol but comes across the tutoring kit Haley gave to Nathan, which Brooke sees as flirting and takes the box to show to the others. Outside the house, Brooke sets up a game of truth or dare with the other students. She dares Peyton to show her true feelings to Lucas, and to upset Brooke, a furious Peyton passionately kisses Lucas before storming off herself and Lucas follows her. Everyone then insults Brooke at how pathetic she is acting and leaves her once again alone with a drink. In the kitchen, Deb and Karen begin sharing cooking tips together and getting along together. When the deserts are delivered to a different address, Karen steps in and offers to use some of hers from her cafe. Deb agrees and Karen rings Haley to deliver the cakes. Finding each other again, Lucas and Peyton start talking on the front lawn. Peyton tells Lucas the kiss wasn't a game for her. Just as they are about to kiss, with Dan watching from inside in shock, Haley interrupts them with the cakes. The two then decide to leave together, once again being watched by Dan, as Haley is told to stay and enjoy the party after delivering the deserts. As Haley begins to go around the party, she bumps into Brooke who shows her the note. Brooke tells her that Nathan has been passing around and laughing at the note. Embarrassed, Haley storms off without giving Nathan a chance to explain. Finding a room in Nathan's house, Peyton and Lucas are about to have sex. As they get undressed, Lucas tells her he has been waiting so long for that moment. Peyton agrees but seems more interested in the sex than talking. Lucas then stops her and tells her he has been waiting for more than the sex but for them being together. Realizing this, Peyton tells him that is not what they are meant to be doing. She runs out leaving Lucas alone. Dan then goes in the room and begins offering advice to Lucas, he storms off without listening to his father. In the kitchen, Deb tells Karen that she didn't know about Lucas and her until she was married and pregnant with Nathan, only a month after he left Karen. Leaving the kitchen, Karen is confronted by Dan, to whom she tells to stop living in the past and get over it. Meanwhile, Deb advertises the cafe to her departing guests and thinks that eventually there is a chance her and Karen could be friends. Once everyone is gone, she thanks Dan for behaving, but Dan confides in her telling her he has never felt so off balance. Returning to the cafe from Nathan's, Lucas looks for Haley but can't seem to find her. Eventually, he comes across a silent Haley crying in the corner of the cafe, hidden under a counter. Haley tells him about what Nathan did and that Lucas and everyone else was right all along. Lucas comforts her and tells her about Peyton and him. Haley tells Lucas she wants to be alone and he leaves the cafe. Just as Haley is about to close up, Nathan knocks at the door of the cafe, apologizing about Brooke and explaining it wasn't his fault. Not believing him, Haley leaves him locked out and switches off the lights in the cafe. Jake is then seen playing guitar in his room next to a baby's crib, his baby's crib. Also, Peyton begins drawing what just happened between her and Lucas and begins staring at the webcam, as Lucas is doing the same from his house. She then stands up and covers the camera up so no one can see her."

When he returns home, his mother Nora bandages his injuries and Barry explains that he tried to defend some classmates. Nora tells him that it's better to have a good heart than fast legs, just as Henry Allen comes home and greets his wife and son. That night, Barry is in his room when he hears a noise from downstairs. The water in his fish tank rises out of the tank on its own. Barry goes downstairs and sees his mother surrounded by a red and yellow blur. Henry comes in and tells his son to run. Before Barry can react, he suddenly finds himself blocks away in the middle of a street. He runs home, yelling to his parents.

In the present, Barry arrives late at a crime scene. His adoptive father, Detective Joe West, is there with his partner Fred Chyre and their boss, Captain Singh. The CCTVs have confirmed that brothers Clyde and Martin Mardon robbed the bank and killed a security guard. Joe covers for Barry with Singh, but Singh isn't impressed. Barry checks the area and quickly finds some animal excrement in a tire track and uses Chyre's pen to collect a sample. At the crime lab, Barry is examining the sample when Joe's daughter Iris comes in. He tells her that he can't take her to the unveiling of Central City's new S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator that night because of the Mardon case. Barry tries to explain why the accelerator is so important and how much works its creator, Harrison Wells, has put into it. Joe comes in and Barry tells him that the excrement came from a farm and narrows it down to four possibilities. Since Barry has solved his part of the case, Iris convinces Joe to let him off for the night so that he can take her to the unveiling. That night, Barry and Iris arrive at S.T.A.R. labs and they start talking about relationships, including the one he had with Felicity in Starling City. He's more interested in Iris but she misunderstands him and assures her adopted sibling that he doesn't have to feel awkward talking with her about his girlfriends. Harrison addresses the crowd, telling them that his work will usher in a new age of advancement for mankind. As he talks, a thief grabs Iris' laptop backpack and runs outside. Barry chases him into an adjoining building but the thief attacks and knocks him down. As Iris arrives, police detective Eddie Thawne shows up and catches the thief. They go to the station and Eddie happily boasts about catching the thief. Barry explains to Iris that Eddie is a recent transfer from Keystone City, and Iris eyes the new detective appreciatively. Joe and Chyre approach the last of the four farms. A storm breaks out and Chyre is ready to go home, figuring Barry was wrong. Joe isn't and says that they should check it out while they're there. Barry returns to his lab and discovers that the skylight is leaking rainwater. He watches a news broadcast on TV about the accelerator unveiling, and then unveils his hidden board on strange phenomena... including the blur Henry claimed was presented after he was arrested for his wife's murder. Joe and Chyre spot a car with the tire tracks that Barry identified earlier. The Mardon brothers open fire and then run out to a nearby plane. Clyde manages to shoot and kill Chyre, while the brothers take off in the plane. Barry watches in surprise as on TV, the accelerator goes out of control. The power blacks out across Central City and waves of energy sweep out from the accelerator, covering the city. Joe looks up and sees the energy wave hit the plane, destroying it. Barry goes to close the skylight but hesitates when everything in the room starts shaking. Lightning strikes, hitting the chemicals on a nearby shelf and dumping them onto Barry, who passes out from the shock. The EMTs soon arrive and take Barry to the hospital. Iris can only stand by as they try to revive him.

Nine months later, a comatose Barry is at the shutdown S.T.A.R. Lab building. Scientists Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon are checking on him when he suddenly wakes up. They summon Harrison and while they wait for him, tell Barry what happened to him. Caitlin, a biologist, is surprised to discover that Barry's muscular degeneration is healing at accelerated speeds. Barry wonders how long he was in a coma and a wheelchair-bound Harrison comes in and tells him that it was nine months. As Harrison shows Barry around the once thriving facility, Harrison explains that FEMA classified them as a disaster area and shut them down. When the accelerator exploded, seventeen people died and countless more were injured... including Harrison. The energy wave triggered off the storm and the lightning bolt that struck Barry. They realized that Barry's condition was unique when his heartbeat at the hospital couldn't be detected because it was going too fast for the sensors to detect. Joe and Iris, out of options, gave Harrison permission to monitor Barry. Caitlin and Cisco arrive and Barry says that he has to see Iris immediately. He refuses to let the scientists test him further and leaves. Barry finds Iris at Jitters, the coffee shop where she works. She hugs him and Barry assures her that he's fine. When another waitress trips and spills her tray, time suddenly seems to slow down for Barry. At the Gold City Bank, Clyde walks in and gives the teller a note saying to hand over the money. When she hesitates, Clyde casually generates a tornado from nothing, shattering the bank's skylight. Barry and Iris go to the station and Joe welcomes Barry back. They get a report about the bank robbery, while an officer notes that a storm is picking up nearby. Joe leaves for the bank with his new partner Eddie who tries flirting with Iris. She gives him the cold shoulder and then tells Barry that Chyre died on the night of the explosion. As they talk, a violent suspect grabs a cop's gun and tries to escape. Barry, surprised, sees time slow down again. He runs over and disarms the man so fast that no one sees him, and then goes back to where he was standing. Iris asks if he's okay and Barry says that he is and he'll call her later. When Barry gets outside, his hand starts to vibrate. He suddenly runs forward, out of control, and slams into cars. He finally manages to gain some control and starts running as fast as he can, only to go out of control and slam into the back of a laundry van. Brought to a halt, Barry stares at himself, surprised and happy. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry tells the scientists what happened. They take him to an abandoned airfield and Cisco equips him with a skintight heat resistant suit, equipped with a lightning shaped two way headset resistant to sonic booms. As Caitlin prepares her monitoring equipment, Barry comments that she doesn't smile very much. The scientist tells him that she doesn't have much to smile about because her career is over and the accelerator explosion killed her fiance Ronnie. Barry starts running and soon goes over 200 knots per hour. As he runs, he remembers the blur on the night that his mother died and suddenly goes out of control, running into a barrier and breaking his wrist. Joe and Eddie bring the teller back to the station and she says that a storm sprang up in the middle of the bank. Eddie points out that it's the third such robbery accompanied by freak storms, and that the security cameras were shorted out at each robbery. They check the witnesses' cell phone and get a partial license plate of the bank robber's car. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Caitlin is surprised to discover that Barry's broken wrist has healed in the time it took them to return. Harrison asks what happened and Barry explains about the blur, which he now realizes was a man moving at super speed. People told him as a boy that what he saw was impossible and Henry was convicted of murder. Harrison insists that no one else could have Barry's abilities. Eddie stops in at Jitters to meet Iris, and complains about how she pretends to hate him when she's around Joe so that he won't know that they're involved. They kiss just as Barry comes in and sees them together. Iris takes Barry for a walk and asks him not to tell Joe. She then explains that she saw more of Eddie when she was at the hospital at Barry's bed, and things developed from there. As Barry says that he's unhappy lying to Joe, Clyde drives by with two police cars in pursuit. When one of them skids, Barry gets Iris out of the way at super speed. He then catches up to Clyde's car, gets in, and grabs the wheel. The car flips but Clyde and Barry are unharmed. The robber summons a cloud of fog to cover his escape and Barry dodges out of the way just in time when the other police car barrels through the fog at him. As the medics arrive and take away the dead driver, Joe complains that Barry endangered Iris by taking her out. Barry talks to his adopted father privately and starts to explain about Clyde's superpowers, but Joe figures that it's another of Barry's conspiracy theories. He doesn't believe there was a yellow blur at Nora's death and insists that Henry was the killer. Joe tells Barry that he has to see things as they really are for once, and Barry walks away. Eddie arrives with a composite sketch from the killer's description and Joe realizes that it is Clyde... and Barry was right. Barry returns to S.T.A.R. Labs and accuses the scientists of knowing that there were others like him and hiding the information. Harrison admits that the accelerator explosion opened an extra dimensional portal, unleashing energies across the city. They've mapped the energies but have no idea how many people were affected like Barry. Barry blames Harrison for creating Clyde, but Harrison insists that Barry and his accelerated metabolism is the important thing. If they can analyze and duplicate it, they can save thousands of lives. Harrison warns Barry that he's just an ordinary man, not a hero, and Barry walks out. He speeds through the city and thinks back to the night of Nora's murder.

Barry runs home and finds the police taking Henry away. He goes inside and finds Joe securing the crime scene. Joe, a neighbor, knows Barry as his daughter's best friend. Barry goes to Nora's corpse, crying, and Joe goes over to comfort him.

In Starling City, Barry meets Oliver as The Arrow and tells him what happened. The Arrow wonders why Barry came to see him, and Barry explains that he always wanted to do more and now he has the chance. However, because he failed to stop Clyde, one man is already dead. The Arrow tells him that if Barry decides to become a hero, he'll make mistakes, and admits that he's made a few himself. He tells Barry that he can be a better hero because he can be a hero and an inspiration, rather than a vigilante like the Arrow. The Arrow suggests that Barry might want to wear a mask if he's going to continue as a superhero, and swings away into the night. Later when Barry returns to S.T.A.R. Labs, he tells Cisco and Caitlin that he's been reviewing unsolved cases since the explosion and discovered an increase in missing persons and unexplained deaths. He asks the scientists to help him capture Clyde and anyone else using their powers for evil. They agree and Cisco provides Barry with a new red fire-resistant body suit. It has built-in sensors so that they can track Barry no matter where he goes. Meanwhile, Caitlin uses the S.T.A.R. satellites to track weather anomalies in Central City and gets one from the farm where Joe confronted the Mardons nine months ago. Joe and Eddie drive to the Mardons' former hideout to find Clyde. He is waiting for them and explains that he survived the plane explosion... and realized that with his new powers, he was God. He knocks Eddie unconscious with a micro-storm and confronts Joe. When Joe points out that God wouldn't need to rob banks, Clyde agrees and admits that he's been thinking too small. He summons a tornado, blasting the roof off the barn. Joe carries the unconscious Eddie out but a piece of debris sweeps toward them. Barry arrives just in time to catch it, and Cisco warns him over the headset that Clyde is generating a F-5 tornado. Clyde surrounds himself with the tornado and starts walking toward Central City. Barry figures that he can run against the tornado and extinguish it, but Caitlin warns him that he could die from the strain of reaching the 700 MPH necessary to pull off the maneuver. Barry looks over at Joe and then runs against the tornado. Caitlin and Cisco, monitoring his vitals, realize that he can't do it just as Clyde blasts Barry out of the tornado. Barry realizes that he isn't fast enough... and Harrison gets on the radio and admits that Barry was right, and he is responsible for the deaths that the meta humans have caused. He asks Barry to make up for his mistakes and to run as fast as he can. Barry charges back into the tornado, extinguishing it, and the backlash knocks him down, knocking off his hood. Clyde is too shocked to summon another storm, but draws a gun and prepares to finish Barry off... and Joe shoots him dead. The police detective then goes to his adopted son to make sure that he's okay. The next morning, the police secure the farm while Barry explains to Joe how he gained his super speed. Joe apologizes to Barry for not believing his story about what killed Nora, and realizes that Henry is innocent. The detective then makes Barry promise not to tell Iris so that she'll stay safe. Later, Barry goes to Iron Heights Prison to visit Henry and tells him that he just won a fight. Henry is proud of him and Barry says that he knows his father didn't kill Nora, and now he has a way to find the killer and stop them... and that he's proud to be Henry's son. Eddie and Iris have coffee and watch a newscast about the mysterious ""Red Streak"" that saved a family's life. Cisco decals a lightning bolt insignia onto Barry's suit. Barry and Henry say that they love each other. At a secret chamber at S.T.A.R. Labs, Harrison brings up a hologram display and gets out of his wheelchair. He then brings up a newspaper article about the Flash vanishing on April 25, 2024 in a crisis."

Labs tracks him. Caitlin comes in and Cisco tries to shut off the monitors before she can see what he's doing. However, The Flash calls in on the radio and Caitlin realizes what they're doing. He gets the last people out of the building and runs into an alley, but is suddenly overwhelmed by dizziness as Caitlin orders him to come back to the lab. When Barry return, Caitlin insists that he can't run around the city saving people. Harrison comes in and tells Barry to practice restraint, because his lack of restraint put him in a wheelchair and made him a pariah. Caitlin insists that she isn't going to put Barry back together the next time he injures himself, and then storms out. Cisco asks Barry if he felt anything different because the sensors showed a spike, but Barry insists that he's fine. Barry checks in with Joe, who tells him that he's needed as a CSI at a gun shop that was robbed. Barry speeds there only to realize that he forgot his street clothing. He quickly buys some from a neighboring shop and goes in. Joe and Singh explain that the owner was shot and killed by what the security footage shows was a single man. However, Barry checks the footprints and points out that they indicate that six different men were there... but they all had the same shoe When they return to the police station, Joe points out that Barry is embarrassing everyone, including himself. He wonders if Barry has said anything about his new powers to Iris, and Barry assures Joe that he hasn't.

Joe finds Barry running down the street and takes him home. When they get there, Barry insists on seeing his father Henry, saying that he's innocent of killing Nora. Joe refuses to take him and Barry yells that he hates him.

Back in his lab, Barry has another wave of dizziness. He recovers just as Iris comes in and complains that she's bored being a journalist. She reminds him that he was going to meet with her and explain why scientist/industrialist Simon Stagg is receiving a reward from the local university. Eddie arrives and Barry reminds the couple that he knows they're together, and Eddie thanks Barry for being cool about it. Later, Barry and Iris go to the award ceremony and watch as Simon accepts a Man of the Year award for organ transference. Barry tells Iris that Simon is working with cloning and cellular regeneration. She wonders if he's been avoiding her because she's dating Eddie. Barry assures her that he isn't, just as Simon walks by with his bodyguard Java. When Iris tries to approach the man about an interview, Simon ignores her and leaves. Six armed men break into the hall and order the audience to hand over their money. Barry starts to go after them but Iris stops him, reminding him that he's just a police scientist, not a policeman. However, when a security guard orders them to freeze, the robbers open fire and Barry has no choice but to rescue the man, moving so fast as to be invisible. However, when he goes after the robbers, Barry has another wave of dizziness and collapses. Iris runs outside to find Barry and wakes him up, and he says that he was trying to get the plates on the robbers' can. When they go back inside, Joe and Eddie are taking statements. When the security guard describes how an invisible force took him outside, Joe realizes that Barry was involved and talks to him privately. He makes Barry promise to stop being a hero, pointing out that he has no training. Back at the lab, Barry tells scientists what happened to him. Caitlin complains that he didn't tell them about his earlier dizzy spells and storms off, and Cisco admits that she hasn't been so mad with someone since her fiance Ronnie died. They then test Barry on a special treadmill that Cisco has built to see if they can recreate the dizziness. Barry hits his top speed and the scientists realize that his glucose levels are messed up. As they check the readings, Barry passes out and slams into the protective barrier. That night, Joe goes to Barry's lab and finds his board of bizarre occurrences.

Joe comes home and realizes that Barry is gone. He gets Iris to tell him the truth and they both realize where Barry has gone.

Joe spots Barry's discarded S.T.A.R. sweater and realizes where he's gone. Caitlin and Cisco tell Barry how he's not eating enough to keep up with his newly-accelerated metabolism. Joe arrives and says that he knows Barry has been performing heroics, and blames Harrison and the others for encouraging Barry to risk his life. Barry insists that he has to deal with the wave of Metahumans that the dark matter explosion created, but Joe points out that he's not invincible no matter how fast he is. Angry, Barry says that he's not Joe's son and that he's going to help anyone he can. He tells Joe not to stop him and leaves, and Joe tells the team that he hopes they're smart enough to realize that they don't know what they're doing. That night, Java meets with one of the robbers from the ceremony. The man, Danton Black, says that the rest of his crew isn't there and wants Simon's inventory. Java refuses to help him any further, pointing out that it will make him look like a failure as a bodyguard, and punches Danton. Danton concentrates and then self replicates four copies of himself, who beat Java to death. The next day, Joe brings a skin sample from Java's body to Barry and explains what happened. Barry wants to go with him to talk with Simon, but Joe reminds him that he's a scientist, not a detective. Iris comes in, angry with Barry for missing their appointment so he could give her scientific background on Simon. She asks what's really going on with Barry and he goes to super speed, working out what to tell her about his real feelings for her. He slows down to normal time just as the lab results come back on the skin sample. Barry tells Iris that they are stem cells of the kind that only babies have. Joe and Eddie meet Simon at one of his warehouses and tell him about the murder. The detectives have a file on all of the people who are suing Simon, including Danton. Simon says that Danton is a clinical researcher, not a killer... just as Danton and his ""army"" arrive and open fire on Simon. The detectives get Simon to cover and return fire. At the station, Barry hears Joe call in for backup and goes to his locker to get his suit. While Eddie gets Simon out, Joe provides cover fire. He kills one of the copies but Danton creates another one. They advance on Joe, ready to kill him, but Flash arrives and takes away their guns, and then takes Joe outside. Returning, the hero orders Danton to surrender. He refuses and The Flash knocks two of the copies down. However, Danton generates more of them and they soon overwhelm The Flash. When they prepare to shoot him, the battered speedster manages to get away. Back at the lab, Caitlin treats Barry's quick healing injuries and he tells them what happened. Harrison informs the team that Danton was working in cloning, and Simon stole his research and fired him. They figure that the dark matter explosion hit Danton when he was experimenting on himself, giving him the power to self-replicate. Barry admits that he's in over his head, and figures that his trying to play hero was a mistake. He runs out and through the city.

Barry goes to Iron Heights to see Henry. Joe is already there, knowing where he would go, and okays Henry to come in. Henry tells his son that he was the one who told Joe to keep Barry away, because he doesn't want his son to see him in prison. Barry tries to convince the guards that his father is innocent, but Henry tells him to go home with Joe because there's nothing that he can do for him.

Barry goes to Jitters to apologize to Iris. She's with Eddie, watching Eddie give a press conference earlier on the news. Once the detective leaves, Iris asks Barry if he's going to tell her the truth about what's going on in his life. At the station, Simon refuses to let the police assign a guard to him. He assures Joe that he's increased his personal security and hopes that Danton comes after him. Harrison comes in and applauds, asking what Simon is pretending to be. Simon walks out, brushing by Harrison, and Joe wonders if Harrison knew about Barry's powers when he offered to take him out of the hospital. Harrison admits that he had some suspicions, and tells Joe that Barry quit temporarily. However, he warns Joe that Barry will fail because Joe doesn't have any faith in him. Harrison tells Joe that he cares about Barry as well and leaves. At Jitters, Barry is eating and admits that he's been a jerk. He offers to help her with her article on Simon, but Iris says that she's doing a new article... on the red streak. Caitlin calls and tells Barry that he needs to come to the lab immediately. When he arrives, he discovers that Caitlin has created a diploid of Danton. She explains that she took a blood sample from Barry's suit and created a clone, but without Danton's controlling presence, he's a mindless drone. Caitlin figures that like Barry, Danton can only use his power so much before it begins to fatigue him, and tells Barry that the ""prime"" Danton will be the one showing signs of stress. Cisco provides Barry with high energy protein bars, and the copy comes to life. Joe arrives and shoots it dead, and Harrison figures that the prime Danton is on the move. Joe tells Barry that Simon is at his office building and admits that the police are useless against a one man army. He tells Barry to do what he says for once and stop Danton. At Stagg Industries, Danton and his clones break in and kill Simon's security guards. Simon comes out of his office and the Dantons prepare to shoot him... just as The Flash arrive and carries Simon back to his office. He then goes back and tells Danton that he can't kill a man just for stealing his research. A Danton shoots at him and The Flash dodges the bullet, then knocks out some of the copies. As they fight, Danton tells the hero that his wife Elizabeth had a coronary degenerative disease. He was trying to clone a new heart for her when Simon stole his research and fired him. The Flash picks off the copies but Danton creates more and more, swarming the speedster. The Flash manages to break free and Caitlin and Harrison remind him that he has to find the prime Danton. When the hero warns that it's impossible, Joe chips in and says that Barry has shown him that nothing is impossible. The Flash speeds through the hundreds of copies, finding the one Danton who is sweating. He speeds him up to a balcony and knocks him out, and all of the copies pass out when the prime does. Danton recovers and charges at The Flash, who dodges just in time. The replicating man goes out a window and The Flash grabs him. However, Danton pries himself loose and falls to his death. Later back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry tells his friends what happened. Harrison says that Danton may not have wanted to be saved, and Barry assures the team that they're out there with him when he's helping people. He then goes back to his lab and Joe arrives with three pizzas. As they dig in, Joe admits that he was wrong and says that now they can find the real killer and get Henry out of prison. Barry apologizes for what he said to Joe earlier and assures the detective that he was a father to him in every way that mattered. Iris gets news text about more sightings of the red streak. Caitlin warns The Flash about an emergency and he assures her and Cisco that he's got it. Harrison goes to Simon's office and the industrialist says that he plans to control a power like his rescuer has. Harrison says that the hero will be called The Flash one day, and then stands up and stabs Simon in his heart. As Simon dies in his arms, Harrison says that it's nothing personal, but that he has to keep The Flash safe."

Barry asks ""Why did you kill my mother?"" and Thawne replies ""Because I hate you."" Thawne explains how he hates The Flash (Barry) in the future and that they were opposites and reverses of one another and then The Reverse Flash learnt The Flash's name, Barry Allen. Thawne doesn't explain why they hated each other but says that the only way for him to defeat The Flash was travel back in time and kill him as a child. So Thawne explained how he travelled back in time to when Barry was a kid and attempted to wipe him off the face of existence but the future Flash followed him back and took his younger self (Young Barry) to safety 20 blocks away from the house. Thawne failed and wanted Barry to suffer a tragedy so he killed his mum (stabbed her in the heart). Thawne left the house but to realise that in travelling back, he had lost his connection to the speed force and couldn't travel back home to the future. So Thawne was stuck here and he needed the Flash but the Flash was gone and he had to become Harrison Wells and create the Flash with a particle accelerator. Thawne wants Barry to run fast enough to ""rupture the space time barrier and create a stable wormhole in which he could travel back in time."" Barry thinks about the offer because Thawne says if Barry runs fast enough and makes the wormhole, then he can save his mother 15 years ago. Barry walks out

Barry goes to the lab where Cisco, Caitlin, Joe and Firestorm are. Martin Stein explains that if Barry travels back in time then it would change choices and relationships. Joe thinks Barry should go.

Barry goes to his father but his father says ""No dont travel."" Barry is sad and confused to why his father won't let him travel.

Barry asks Iris and Iris says ""Yes, travel.and then they hug""

Barry accepts the offer and so the STAR LABS team (Cisco and Firestorm) start building a time machine. They realise something is wrong and Cisco goes to Eobard to get help. Eobard solves his problem and asks Cisco for anything else. Thawne says that out of all people Cisco would understand because Thawne is from the future and living around everyone is like living amongst the dead. Cisco explains that Thawne killed Cisco in an Alternate Universe meaning Cisco was affected by the particle accelerator being able to see through the vibrations of the universe. Cisco walks out

Martin Stein sees Eddie doing nothing at a station and asks if he could use it. As he is explaining why Eddie stops him and says ""Its OK. Dr Wells ( Eobard Thawne) made it very clear that I don;t matter. "" Martin Stein disagrees and says that Eddie is a wild card and is the only person that can pick his own fate. That means Eddie is something that no scientist can hope for , Coincedence (being with his future great-great-great-great son in the same building, same profession)

Eddie gets motivated and then goes to Iris at a restraunt and says ""Screw the future"" and asks her out ( the future showed iris marrying Barry.

Caitlin and Ronnie get married and Stein is the rabbi

Barry says his goodbyes and then runs in the particle accleerator, reaching the required speed and then they release a hydrogen particle in the other direction causing a wormhole. Barry is in the speed force and then after seeing many things from his past, present and future, he focuses on the night and then travels back in time to the night to save his mum.

Barry ends up in his old bedroom and goes downstairs and sees his future self fighting the Reverse Flash (he is peeking through the door). Some point in their fight the future Flash stops and sees The Flash. He signals ""No, don't save her."" So Barry is forced to not save her and waits for his future version to get his younger version out of there. Then he hears his mum being stabbed and then goes into the room when it is safe. He is very sad when he sees his mother but also happy. He explains that he is Barry and they hug and it is very emotional. Barry says that him and Dad are fine.

Meanwhile, in the present, Thawne goes into his time machine to travel home. The Flash comes out of the wormhole out of nowhere and breaks the time machine. The Reverse Flash is very angry so he starts bashing Barry. Barry is so bashed and then The Reverse Flash nearly kills him but Eddie (Reverse Flash ancestor) shoots himself in the heart. This means that The Reverse Flash would never be alive if Eddie dies. Eddie dies and then that creates a massive wormhole so Barry runs into the wormhole trying to stop it. THATS HOW IT ENDS

Sookie serves customers, walking around hearing their thoughts. She takes a deep breath and seems able to quiet them. A customer pesters a customer service woman at a Home Depot-like store. Tara gives the customer lip then quits, but not before she threatens to have her baby daddy beat up the manager for patting her ass. When the manager balks at this comment, Tara retorts that she doesn't have a baby daddy and calls the people in the store ""pathetic racists.""

At Merlotte's, Lafayette the sassy gay cook leads a raunchy sex talk that all the waitresses join in while Sookie looks totally freaked out.

In a house, a young man has his way with a woman, but notices bite marks on her thighs. She tells him a vampire offered her $1,000 once to let him bite her. He wants to know what it's like. She says it was way too rough. He's about to leave when she tells him she video taped it.

Back at the restaurant, Tara and Sookie talk to Sam the owner. He has a crush on Sookie. She's distracted when a mysterious man walks in and the lights dim. It's clear that he's a vampire. Sookie goes to wait on him, flirting and giggling to have her first vamp since they ""came out of the coffin"" two years ago. A slimy couple sitting nearby ooze over to talk to the vampire, hot for him.

Back at the house, the young man watches the vampire sex tape as the woman keeps him occupied. The vampire starts to shape shift.

At the bar, Sookie hears the thoughts of the couple planning to drain the vampire of blood. She wants to stop them, but they disappear with him. She runs out after them. She grabs a length of chain from the back of a truck, vigilante waitress.

At the house o' sex, the man is ravishing the woman, calling her dirty vampire-sex related names. He wraps his hands around her neck as a camera records everything, throttling her as he finishes.

Outside the bar, the couple has pinned the vamp to the ground and is draining him. He sees Sookie coming up. She whacks the man with the chain and it wraps around his neck. She runs the woman off with a knife as she threatens to kill Sookie.

Sookie lets the vampire up, slowly lifting the small silver chain that held him in place, burned into his flesh. A dog runs up and licks Sookie. She thinks the vampire is not happy to have been rescued by a woman. She tries to hear what he's thinking and is excited to realize she can't. He offers her his blood, to sell or drink (it makes humans feel healthier and improves their sex lives), but she declines, since she has no sex life to speak of. He's intrigued. His name is Bill. She thinks it's funny he has such a normal name. She says good-bye and goes back to work.

Sam is waiting for her, nervous. Tara wants a job, but he doesn't want her to run off his customers. She bargains with him as it being a way to watch out for Sookie. He agrees.

Sex boy walks in -- turns out he's Sookie's brother, Jason. Tara flirts hello but he's not interested. On the other hand, he's excited to see another waitress, Dawn. She turns him down but he follows her out.

Sookie goes home and tells her grandmother about the vampire that came into the bar. She goes to bed but wakes up in the middle of the night. She looks out the window and sees Bill standing on her lawn. She puts on a robe and goes out to see him, like any young girl would when finding a strange blood-sucker on her lawn. He's gone when she gets out there but then reappears behind her. She says hello and he starts undressing. She says she never thought she'd be having sex with him. ""Who said anything about sex?"" he says menacingly. And then she wakes up.

The next day, she's sunning on the lawn when her brother Jason walks up, having heard about what the Rattrays pulled last night. When he learns she was defending a vampire he warns her to stay away from their kind. He checks to make sure it's not the one from the sex tape, not bald, no tattoos.

Inside, Grandma gets a call that Maudette Pickens has been found strangled in her own home. Jason reacts like it might be the woman he was with last night. He calls her a ""fang banger,"" someone who likes to have sex with vampires. They wants to know why he knows that. He fills them in on vampire hookers. And then says good-bye to his grandmother.

Sookie walks over to him and tries to listen in. She hears: ""How could this be happening to me, how could I lose control?"" before he realizes what she's doing and stops her.

He sits on a lawn chair later, at work supervising on a road crew. On the phone, he tries to talk Dawn into meeting up with him later when two sheriff's deputies pull up. They ask him about Maudette. He denies knowing her or knowing that she was murdered. Then he says he did know. He denies ever having been there, but then says he was there last night. They ask about the nature of the sex, but then tell him they've already seen the tape. They ask him to come with them.

At Sookie's house, her grandmother wants her to invite the vampire to come talk about the Civil War at the library. Sookie promises to ask him if he ever comes in again.

At the bar, Tara is giving a customer lip when Lafayette tells her Jason was arrested. Dawn tells Sookie, who isn't pleased to be the last to know. Dawn starts to say they figured she'd know, but stops. Sookie angrily blurts that she's not psychic and storms off.

Sookie finds two guys from the road crew in the bar and asks what happened. They tell her.

She turns around and sees Bill. In hear head she hears Tara judge her, Sam thinking that he wants to protect her and customers mock her as she floats over to say hi. He takes her hand and the voices silence. He asks her what she is. She tells him again, a waitress. But he says she's something more than human. He asks if he can call on her. She says she has a favor to ask for her grandmother. They make plans to meet after work. He scoots closer and asks if she realizes that every person in there is staring at them. She doesn't care what they think. He says he's going to make Bon Temps his home, so he cares. He walks away and the voices resume.

Sam grabs her arm and takes her to the back room, telling her not to act like a vigilante. He makes her cry, which has the added benefit of meaning he gets to comfort her. She hears his dirty thoughts and then Tara busts in, reading her the same riot act. She tells them she's a grown woman and can make her own decisions. After work at Merlotte's, she waits for Bill. She hears a noise in the woods and goes to investigate -- and it's the Rattrays. They knock her down and start kicking her, violently. As the episode ends, Sookie lays there, helpless and bloody."

Something swoops across the night, picking them off her. A hand reaches down to pull her to her feet.

At the sheriff's station, Jason watches the end of his sex tape with Maudette in which he chokes her and runs out when he realizes what he's done. He starts to cry watching it but then the tape keeps playing. She opens her eyes and laughs, calling him a moron. He's excited to learn he didn't kill her. He suggests it was a vampire.

Bill carries Sookie through the woods.

Jason describes the vampire he saw on Maudette's sex tape. But Jason's tape was the only one they found. The vampire was bald and crazy and tattooed.

Bill carries Sookie to the river, she's in bad shape. He bites open his wrist and tells her to drink. She asks if it'll make her a vampire. He says no, but to do it if she wants to live. She drinks, lustily.

Tara goes home to find her mom passed out on the couch. (A gossip mag has a headline that says Angelina adopts vampire baby.) Tara calls Lafayette to come get her.

Dawn wakes up to loud knocking on her door. Its a very traumatized Jason. He tells Dawn what happened, looking for comfort in one woman's arms after having nearly killed another during sex. But she goes along with it.

At the riverbank, Bill asks Sookie again what she is. She tells him she can hear people's thoughts, but not his. She tells him it's peaceful. She tells him she doesn't date and flashes back to dates where hearing a man's thoughts ruined it. She tells Bill only the people closest to her know. He leans in but she says she should be getting home. She notices she feels completely healed. Doctors don't know that v-juice can do that.

Tara sits on a couch by herself while Lafayette, her cousin, works the crowd. A man tries to pick her up, but she makes up a story about her husband being a mercenary just back from Iraq.

At Dawn's house, she's consoling Jason using the booty method following his recent brush with the law, knocking over things and shrieking a lot.

Bill and Sookie walk chastely down a moonlit street. He was made a vampire in 1865 when he was 30. He was in the Civil War. She asks him if he'd speak to her grandmother's group. He asks if it would make her happy. She says yes. He asks again to call on her. She's off work tomorrow, she'll see him just after dark. Bill disappears.

Jason wakes up in bed next to Dawn, who now has her shirt off. He sees bite marks on her chest and isn't happy about it.

Sookie watches a shouting news program between a Reverend and a woman from the American Vampire League. Her grandmother comes in and they decide Jesus wouldn't mind if someone was a vampire. Sookie eats sausage, tasting more flavors in it than usual. She describes it to her grandmother, who seems to know what happened. Tara comes in, demanding info on her vampire date. Jason comes in in time to hear grandma's news: a tornado turned over a trailer. The one where the Rattrays lived. They were crushed to death.

Sookie drives over there. The trailer is demolished. A van pulls up, and it's the sheriff and the coroner, the one who buried her parents. The sheriff has heard she didn't like the Rattrays much. He also tells her about the vampire living in the old Compton place across the field from her house. He says no one heard anything like a tornado.

Sookie comes home to her grandmother cleaning. She smells rotten food and finds a tiny crumb under the chair. Gran tells Sookie that Jason and Tara are coming over that night to meet the vampire, too.

Later, Bill sneaks up to Sookie on the porch. She has to invite him in before he can enter. She does. As he greets everyone, Jason stuffs his face and stares him down. Bill talks about where he's from. He says he came back because the last of his Compton line died and he's living in their old place. He says he expects the vampire rights act to pass. Jason gives him some vampire prejudice. Tara asks if he owned slaves. He didn't, but his father did. He charms Gran with stories of the olden days.

Bill asks Sookie to go for a walk. Jason tries to forbid her, but Gran shuts him down.

Outside, Sookie tells him she went to the Rattrays' trailer. He says that vampires get stronger over time and learn to cover their tracks. She asks if he ever killed anyone. Yes, by accident. He says he fed on the Rattrays because she drank a lot of his blood. She asks what it'll do to her. She'll have heightened senses, a stronger libido and he'll be able to sense her, especially if she's in trouble.

At the house, Tara cozies up to Jason, talking about wanting to be seen and to matter. They snuggle on the couch and Jason remembers he was supposed to pick up Dawn from work.

Walking through a graveyard, Bill tells Sookie about glamoring people, which is sort of like hypnosis. She wants him to try on her. She goads him into it. He looks deep into her eyes, trying to take hold of her thoughts. She busts up laughing. He has no effect on her. Usually people are more squeamish about vampires, he says. Who is she to be squeamish about something out of the ordinary? She flashes back to her childhood, hearing her mom thoughts as she worries about bills and then getting talked to by a teacher who is resolved to disprove she can read minds. She hears her mom anxious thoughts about her, being scared by her. She tells Bill they diagnosed her with ADD. He asks when she lost them. When she was eight, in a flash flood. He talks about losing his wife and children after he turned.

She quizzes him on his skills. He can't levitate, change form or turn invisible.

They stare deeply at each other, she lets her hair down. He nuzzles her neck and soon it's a vampire-human make-out. But he pushes her away, his fangs out. He tries to calm down and says he'd better walk her home.

Jason lays tied up in Dawn's bed as she gets ready for work. He quickly realizes she plans to leave him like that.

At the bar, a woman orders another drink from Tara, who tells her off and then talks her way out of wearing a uniform.

Sookie waits on four rude guys who think lewd things. The road crew guy runs them off. Sam asks to talk to Sookie in his office and asks her about reading people's thoughts. He says she should read his sometime. She says she doesn't want to; she's had to quit every job she's ever had because she could read her boss' thoughts.

Tara asks Dawn about Jason, in a way that doesn't come across as completely innocent.

Sookie sees something on the news about the anti-Vampire Reverend and his wife having been killed in a car accident. She drives to Bill's house. There's a car with a license plate that says FANGS 1 out front. Two creepy vampires meet her at the door and the bad tattooed guy from the sex tape sneaks up behind her.

She surprises them by asking if they're trying to glamour her. When the dark-haired male vampire admits they are, she tells them it doesn't work on her. They're taken aback; a voice from inside calls them off.

There are two other people lounging around on couches inside Bill's house. One, a woman who looks like she's been fed on (we find out later shes called Janella), and a shirtless man named Jerry. Bill is sitting in a shadowed corner.

Dianne, a vampire that Malcolm (the dark-haired vampire) mentions once had sex with Bill, says Sookie smells like a virgin, and virgins have the best tasting blood. After babies, adds Liam (the tattooed vampire from Maudettes sex tape).

They're about to bite into her neck when Bill shouts for them to stop. ""Sookie's mine.""

The male vampires start engaging with their sex/blood slaves. Malcolm offers Bill some of Jerry. Bill is closing in to bite Jerry, when Sookie hears Jerry's thoughts. He's daring Bill to take a gulp and catch his ""Hep D."" She stops Bill just in time. Dianne asks if shes the only one who wants to know how Sookie knew about Jerry's infection, but before she's answered, Bill runs them off.

Bill tells Sookie he's sorry she had to see that.

Sookie asks what Hep D is. Bill explains that its a hepatitis mutation that makes vampires weak for a month, which puts them at greater risk for getting staked.

Sookie's offended that Bill claimed her as his. He explains that he did it to protect her. If he hadn't, they would have seen her as fair game and he wouldn't have been able to fight them off, especially Malcolm, who is much older than Bill. So, sort of chivalrous.

Sookies grossed out that Bill had sex with Dianne. He says it was back in the 1930s, just after Dianne was turned.

Bill tells Sookie the three vampires are mean and vicious because they live together in a nest. Vampires that live alone, like him, are more likely to retain some amount of humanity.

He asks to kiss her good-night and she immediately says, ""No! I couldn't stand it after them.""

At the bar, Tara stays after and talks to Sam. She tells him about Bill stopping by last night. She tells him he's only got himself to blame for not initiating a romantic relationship with Sookie. Sam asks Tara why she never started anything with Jason, but Tara changes the subject back to Sam.

When Sam tells Tara that Sookie told him that she can't hear Bill's thoughts, Tara suddenly understands his appeal and tells Sam that, unfortunately, he doesn't stand a chance.

Dawn goes home, eager to untie Jason. But he's not on the bed. A masked man grabs her from behind and growls at her. She starts to freak out as he paws at her, but then she gets into it when she thinks it's a vampire. He says he drained the guy she left tied up and thanks her for it, while he gropes her some more. Then the man takes the stocking off of his face, revealing himself to be Jason. Dawn's mad at first, but quickly forgives him and shows him - using her lady parts.

Sookie drives home, freaked out and sad.

She walks up to her porch and Bill appears. She yells at him for popping up again. He says he just wanted to make sure she was safe.

She asks him why she can't hear her thoughts. He guesses it's because he doesn't have brainwaves and then talks about the magic that keeps him alive.

Sookie says they should stop seeing each other. When Bill asks why she says because his friends tried to eat her, and vampires killed the preacher and his family. He says that Sookie will never find a human man she can be herself with. She turns and goes inside.

Tara hangs out at Sams house, not wanting to go home to her passed-out drunk mother. They bond over booze. She asks him why he doesn't have a girlfriend. Sam says he has a hard time opening up. Tara starts quizzing him about sex. They trade ""how long it's been"" stories. He goes for more drinks and she takes her hair down and follows him inside. She matter-of-factly suggests they have sex. Sam says no, that it's a terrible idea. She's his employee. Then he thinks about it

He tells her if things got weird he'd have to fire her. Tara's fine with that. It's a deal.

Back to Jason and Dawn - doing what they do best. Jason is romping away like crazy when he suddenly pictures Liam beneath him. The mood is killed. He tells Dawn he's creeped out that she had sex with a vampire. She's not ashamed, but he thinks she should be. She says it was the best sex she ever had. Jason's clearly jealous.

He gives her enough grief that Dawn tells him to leave. When he refuses, she goes in the other room for a cigarette but comes back with a gun. She runs Jason off, pants half-on, by shooting at her floor.

A neighbor sees Jason leave.

At Bill's house, someone sneaks up behind him and he whirls around, fangs bared. It's Sookie.

She confesses awkwardly that she's never been with a man before but feels drawn to him and even though it might be a mistake she wants to get it out of the way so she can relax and get some sleep. ""Just don't bite me, OK?"" she says. Bill kisses her and starts to take her clothes off.

Sookie wakes up, alone, in her own bed.

Jason comes home and chugs a beer. He turns on the TV and everything is vampire programming.

Dianne, Liam, and Malcolm are hanging out at their nest, plotting their next feeding. Bill knocks at the door. He tells them to stay away from him and Sookie. They tell him not everyone wants to play human. ""Honey, if we can't kill people, what's the point of being a vampire?"", says Malcolm, the elder of the group.

Bill threatens to go to a higher power, someone (named Eric) who outranks Malcolm [also mentioned is an as-yet unnamed female vampire who outranks Eric]. He warns them again and leaves.

Sam wakes up alone.

Tara walks in her house and gets whacked on the back of the head by a Bible-wielding drunk mother who scolds her for staying out all night. Tara insults her mom and then feels bad, moving in to help her off the floor. Her mom whacks her again, this time with a liquor bottle.

Tara tells her she's on her own and leaves.

Sookie takes her pent-up frustrations out on the lawn, pushing the mower. Her grandmother brings her some fresh-squeezed lemonade. Sensing Sookies feeling anxious, Gran asks her if the vampire did something untoward. Sookie tells her grandmother how shes feeling in her head, versus her loin. From the edge of the yard, the dog watches over Sookie.

Tara goes to Lafayette's house. Inspecting her head wound, he doesn't think she needs stitches. He gives her two Vicodin, a shot of liquor, and some weed to take the pain away. Lafayette's date, a scrawny white dude who tries to pull off the name ""Duke,"" leaves, vaguely saying he left the money on the nightstand. ""He's a state senator,"" Lafayette says after the man leaves.

Tara tells Lafayette she slept with Sam, and that Sam barks in his sleep.

On his front porch, Sam is reading the paper and discovers that Marthaville is getting a Starbucks. He wonders out loud if he should buy a cappuccino machine as the dog runs up to him. He tells the dog what he really wants in Marthaville is a vampire killer to take care of Mr. Bill Compton.

In Gran's kitchen, Sookie also reads in the paper that Marthaville is getting a Starbucks. She asks her grandmother if she should keep seeing Bill. Gran says he's polite and handsome. Sookie says he scares her. Not that he'd hurt her, but that she doesn't know what he's thinking.

Gran tells Sookie her grandfather used to know things about people, personal things, that they would have never told anyone. She tells Sookie about him stopping his brother from killing himself, somehow knowing what the brother was about to do. Then Sookie remembers her great-uncle did kill himself, with a shotgun. Gran waves the statement off, saying that was years later.

Jason visits Lafayette, in search of Viagra. Lafayette says he doesn't have any (Viagra's legal), but he does have something that would have the same effect, only better. Unlike Viagra, Lafayettes impotency-fighter is $600 for a ¼ of an ounce. It's vampire blood (a.k.a. V or V-juice). Lafayette explains he has a deal with a vampire, trading booty for blood.

Lafayette warns Jason not to take more than a drop at a time or it'll be too intense. Jason asks if he can just bring the money later, as he gets up to leave. Lafayette grabs Jason and tells him theres nothing free. Apparently in trade for the V, we see Jason dancing around for Lafayette's video camera wearing only his underpants and a Laura Bush mask. Tara, clearly shocked, watches from another room.

Sookie goes to Bill's house during the daytime. She walks around a bit and finally sits on his front steps. All the colors in the trees seem very intense and, apparently, turn her on. Her cell phone rings, shaking her back to reality. It's Sam asking her to go by Dawn's and wake her up. Dawn's late for her shift and Sam thinks she probably overslept.

Sookie goes to Dawn's, walking in when no one answers the door. Inside, the alarm clock is going off. Sookie finds Dawn is in bed, clearly dead. Sookie screams."

The neighbor who saw him running away the night before comes over and accuses Jason, who denies he had anything to do with it. They call the police.

Outside, neighbors gossip, excited that something has happened. Sookie talks to the sheriff, saying the door was open when she got there. She hears Jason wondering how he's going to get out of the mess, he's too pretty to go to prison. Detective Andy Bellefleur interviews the neighbor, Mrs. Lafeve, who recounts the fight. He leads Jason away in handcuffs like he was the last man to sleep with two women who are now dead, i.e. bashing him into stuff. As Andy leaves Jason in the backseat to wait, Jason realizes he has a vial of highly illegal vampire blood on him. He chugs the whole thing.

Sam joins Sookie on the steps, saying he's sorry she found Dawn. He asks her if he should shut down the bar. ""All that'd do is deny people a good stiff drink when they need it most,"" she says. A cop asks Sam for keys to Dawn's storage locker since he was her landlord. Sookie watches the coroner bring out Dawn's body.

At the station, sheriff Bud and detective Andy are trying to trip up Jason. It's working. They've got him saying he found the body. He becomes distracted by a swelling in his pants. He rushes like a 13-year-old boy to the restroom trying to, uh, deal with it. Andy and the sheriff discuss, the sheriff doesn't think Jason did it. Jason seems to resolve his issue, but screams in pain as he does so. Andy and the sheriff go to investigate. As they knock on the door, Tara storms in and gives Jason an alibi, saying he was with her. They let him go.

Sookie goes to visit Gran, who implores her to listen to people's thoughts to find out who might really be responsible.

Working at Merlotte's, Sookie hears all sorts of dirty thoughts and judgments. Arlene is peeved at Dawn for inconveniently dying on them. She says it wouldn't have happened if Dawn didn't spend her nights at the vampire bar in Shreveport.

Tara arrives late and Sam wants to talk about last night. She tells him to forget about it because she told the police she was with Jason. (Presumably trying to put the fact he barked like a dog in his sleep out of her mind.)

Meanwhile, at home, Jason is tending to his crotch problem, which keeps coming back with a vengeance. It also seems to have done something to him that he finds distressing.

At Merlotte's, Sookie thanks Hoyt Fortenberry for being the only person in the bar not thinking nasty things about Dawn. Jason comes in, still distressed. Sookie asks him point blank if he killed Dawn. He says no and rushes off to see Lafayette for input on his record-setting manhood triumph.

Lafayette tells him there's nothing he can do.

Bill comes in. Arlene waits on him, rudely, not giving him what he wants. Sookie fixes it and brings him the Tru Blood he likes. She takes him outside to tell him about Dawn. She wants to know about the vampire bar in Shreveport. He knows it. It's called Fangtasia. (He reminds her vampires are old and puns used to be he highest form of humor.) She asks him to take her, but clarifies it's not a date. Sookie tells Sam why she wants to leave early. They have a tedious conversation about separate but equal as Sam rails against vampires.

In the car, Sookie has worn a bosomy dress for her non-date. She asks Bill what he's thinking. He tells her she looks like vampire bait. She tries to find the compliment in it.

Tara brings food into the walk-in fridge and finds Jason with a steak on his privates. He shows her his issue and she insists they go to a hospital to deal with whats medically known as priapism.

At Fangtasia, Sookie thinks the red walls and leather-clad crowd make it look like a Disneyland version of a vampire bar. Several of the vamps recognize Bill. Sookie shows the bartender, Longshadow, pictures of Maudette and Dawn. He says they both had been there. He says Maudette wanted to die. Sookie notices a blond, longhaired man in the corner. She asks who it is. Eric, the oldest thing in there.

At the hospital, the doctor inspecting Jason's pants tent asks Jason if he's taken any drugs. He vehemently dies it. The doctor wants to drain the blood out of Jason's manpart. Tara wants to leave but Jason puppy-dog eyes her to stay. The doctor pops Jason's tent.

Back at Merlotte's, Arlene asks Sam to walk her to her car. Sam says sure, and stuffs a latex glove in his pocket. We see a picture of him with Dawn at the bar.

Back at Fangtasia, Sookie hears 100 different versions of people hoping to get laid. Bill sees Eric is about to summon them. He does. They have no choice but to go over. Eric says he heard that Bill was ""mainstreaming."" Eric tells Sookie if she has questions she should ask him. She shows him the pictures. He says one offered herself to him, but he found her too pathetic. The other one, he tasted. When Sookie mouths off to him, Bill gets nervous, gripping her hand. Sookie hears an undercover cop wondering where his back-up is. She warns them, adding that a woman is feeding on the man who Eric kicked earlier. When Eric asks how she knows, Bill shakes his head at her to keep quiet. She does, just as the cops storm in.

Bill whisks her off and Eric also escapes.

Tara drives a very spent Jason home, remembering a time when they were kids when Jason protected her from her drunk mom on a rampage. She smiles at the thought, apparently over that whole draining-Jason's-penis thing.

Bill drives Sookie home. She asks him to pull over, she needs a few minutes of quiet. As they're about to kiss, a cop pulls up. He asks if they were at Fangtasia. He asks if he can shine his light on Sookie's neck. He does and Bill shows him his fangs. The cop pulls out his gun. Bill glamours him into giving him his gun. He points it at the cop, giving him etiquette lessons. The audience is hit over the head with a driving-while-black analogy. Bill tells the man he's going to keep his gun. Sookie is freaked out. After they drive off, the cop pees down his leg.

Sam, wearing latex gloves, uses his keys to get into Dawn's house. He looks around her bedroom, smelling her sheets. He buries his face in her pillow and writhes on her bed because, hey, everybody grieves differently."

She lectures him about threatening police officers, telling him that's not very good mainstreaming. Neither, she notes, is hosting orgies. Chastened, he says he won't call on her again.

From the bushes, the ever-present dog watches.

Lafayette gets up to loud knocking on his door. It's Tara, yelling at him for dealing V. She says giving Jason V is like giving H- Hos to a diabetic.

Gran listens to someone on the phone ranting about Jason. She tells Sookie that everyone is excited about meeting the town vampire that night. Sookie tells Gran that Bill isn't all that nice. She says she doesn't think they have much in common. He doesn't think or feel like they do. The phone rings again. Gran doesn't answer.

Jason recreates his procedure for Lafayette using a sausage and a meat thermometer. He tells Lafayette to stop dealing V. He says Tara will be damaged forever, but Lafayette tells him her enduring love for Jason will help her get over it. It's news to oblivious Jason. Jaosn swears off V but Lafayette says if Jason can learn to control it, it might open him up to everything around him. Lafayette brings out his V kit and waxes poetic about its powers. He drips blood drops on squares of tissue as Jason watches, rapt. Lafayette says it's from a new vampire. He can feel him in his muscles, making him strong. He says it might affect Jason differently. Jason takes a square and puts it in his mouth, having sworn off vampire drugs for less than a full day.

At Merlotte's, Sam eavesdrops on Sookie telling Arlene that she won't be going out with Bill again. Seizing his moment, Sam asks Sookie to go to Bill's talk with him that night. Sookie sees everyone staring and says yes. Andy Belflour asks Sookie about Tara and Jason. When she says there's nothing going on, she hears Andy's suspicions about Tara lying confirmed, swearing in his head about it. When Sookie tells him to watch his mouth he realizes she heard it and the rumors about her must be true.

Sookie goes to find Tara, who tells her about giving Jason an alibi. Sookie asks Tara if there's something else she's not telling her. Sookie tries to listen in, but hears Tara going la,la,la,la. Sookie tries to resell Tara and Jason to Andy, who knows she's lying. She tells him if he's going to accuse her, he should at least do it outloud, leaving Andy dumbfounded.

At the church, the town waits to hear from Bill. Rene and Arlene show up, as does the mayor, sheriff Bud and Andy. Bill waits in the dark, drinking the Tru Blood Gran gave him. Hoyt tries to remove the cross on stage, just in case. Sookie arrives with Sam and they sit next to Tara.

Jason wanders around outside, seeing the world for the first time while hopped on V. Jason comes in and sits next to Tara. He tells her he's feeling strong and alive.

Gran introduces Bill, saying his family was among the first to settle in Bon Temps. Bill comes out. The first thing he does is remove the flag Hoyt's mom draped over the cross, returning it to its flagpole. He teaches the crowd a thing or two about vampires, that they can stand before crosses and in churches. He tells them they can coexist. Then he talks about serving in the infantry in 1862. Andy and Bud pontificate on Bill's guilt. Jason hears Bill's talk in 3D. Sookie sees three goof-offs in the audience crush garlic.

In the back, Hoyt empties the fridge and takes a whiff of the Tru Blood, curious.

A man in the audience asks Bill if he remembers his great-grandfather who was in the 28th. Bill says they fought together and Tolliver Humphries was a brave man.

Flashback to a battlefield, as Bill tried to stop Tolliver from rescuing an injured young soldier, only to be shot down. The boy lived. In the audience, Andy's cousin Terry, an Iraq war vet, seems affected by the battlefield tales. Mayor Norris asks a question. He shows Bill a tintype he found inscribed W. T. Compton and family. Bill looks at it. It's his family. He last saw them when he left for war. Rene asks why he couldn't go back to his family after he became a vampire. Bill says it wouldn't have been possible. Bill gets choked up and Sookie seems moved. (He dabs blood away from his eyes.) Terry finds Bills after and hugs him, vet to vet, telling him to stay strong. Mrs. Foytenberry asks for a picture. Sookie congratulates Bill and Sam gets possessive, putting his arm around her.

At Merlotte's, Hoyt, Jason and Rene shares drinks. Jason looks at Tara and sees a veritable Venus de Milo goddess. He goes over to her and touches her arm, saying the sparks feel like he's peeing on an electric fence. From this terribly romantic declaration she deduces he's high again. He acknowledges he is, but then says he's realized how he feels about her. She tells him to come to her when he's sober. He takes her hand and asks for one chance. She seems to consider it.

Over coffee, Sam asks her if she has listened to his thoughts. She says that unlike with other people, from him she just gets odd sounds. She asks him why no one knows anything about him. He continues to be generally charming.

Arlene brings Lafayette back a burger ordered by the three rabble-rousers from the church. They sent it back saying it might have AIDS. He confronts the idiots, dumping the food in their laps.

Leaving the coffee shop, Sam says hes glad Sookie can't hear his thoughts because she'd know what was coming. He kisses her. He asks if he's going to fast. She says its too soon since.... Sam puts it together and is upset when she says she kissed Bill. He gets angrier, pinning her against the car and saying there's nothing he won't do to keep Bill from hurting her. She says they're not like humans, they can turn on you. Sookie points out he's doing a pretty good job of that himself. She storms back into the restaurant and says she'll call a cab.

Hoyt goes to talk to a randy divorcee. She rubs on him and he walks away, thinking about her offer to come home with him. He tries some Tru Blood, served at 98 degrees, and finds it nasty. He succeeds in alienating the chick when she sees him with it.

Bill goes home and sees his late family on his porch. Andy and sheriff Bud show up, asking to speak with him. He's surprised to hear Andy's last name Belleflour. He invites them in and offers them a Fresca.

Bill says he didn't know Maudette, but had seen Dawn. They ask him for an alibi. He asks them if the girls were exsanguinated and tells them no vampire would have left those women with a drop in them.

Flashback to Bill stumbling through the dark during the war, knocking on a cottage door asking for help. He breaks in and a woman puts a rifle to his head. Then she feeds him. He says he look a shortcut but got lost. She's the widow of a colonel Gibson. She wipes the blood off Bill and suggest he spend the night. She goes into kiss him and he pulls away, saying he has a wife waiting. She says he's an honorable man but the others haven't always been. He thanks her again but says he wants to leave. She cuts him off at the door, fangs bared. She feasts. He wakes up in bed with puncture wounds in his neck, the prim widow sitting over him and the corpses of the others laying around. She climbs on top of him and cuts her throat, telling him he has to drink if he wants to live. He does and she says he's hers.

He returns to his home as the vampire tells him he can't ever go in and that his family is as good as dead. He cries a bloody tear.

Tara takes the trash out and hears panting. He finds Jason on the ground with the divorcee bent over in front of him. He graciously invites Tara to join them. Tara can't believe what she's seeing and douses them both in the garbage she's carrying. Unfazed, they continue.

Sookie arrives home and slips on blood. She finds her grandmother lying ashen on the floor, covered in blood."

Sookie stands, barefoot, in shock. Bill comes up behind her and grabs her, trying to calm her. As he holds onto her, someone enters the front of the house. It's Sam. Bill grabs him by the throat. He says he was making sure Sookie got home safe, the door was open. He sees the blood and asks what happened.

Sam puts a blanket around her shoulders and suggests she go upstairs and lie down. Sookie hears Andy Bellefleur with the other police from the kitchen, disturbed and saying the Stackhouse kids, while crazy, didn't deserve this. He thinks they have a serial killer.

Sookie goes outside for air. Sam follows her and sits next to her on the porch. She hears him saying he's so, so sorry in a way that sounds more like lust than sympathy. She tells him some other time and asks what happened to Bill.

Sam goes to get him from inside.

Sam tells Bill to stay away from her. Bill says Sookie doesn't take kindly to people telling her what to do. Sam says he doesn't need Bill to tell him about her; he's known her a long, long time.

Sam says Gran would be alive if it weren't for Bill. He tells Bill if anything ever happens to Sookie, he'll stake him.

Bill notices the screen in the window is slashed.

Down in the kitchen, the coroner notes Gran put up a hell of a fight. Andy thinks Jason might have done it. The sheriff thinks Gran might have upset someone by having ""Vampire Bill"" in the church.

The sheriff has questions for Bill. He got there right after Sookie found the body. He heard a car from his place.

Bill thinks whoever did this is targeting women who associate with vampires. He doesn't think Adele was the intended victim.

Outside, Sookie realizes she should call Jason. Sam volunteers to do it for her. Jason's cell phone rings as he sleeps in bed with his latest conquest. He partially awakens and groggily hurls the phone through the window.

The coroner brings out the body. Sookie says she's staying in the house. She hears the thoughts of the coroner's young assistant, hoping that she doesn't recognize him from the vampire bar. The sheriff thinks she's lucky it wasn't her and that she's next.

Bill has to leave. It's almost dawn.

Sookie sends Sam for the mop so she can clean up. She wipes up her grandmothers blood, on her hands and knees in the kitchen.

The next day neighbors come with food and gossip. Mrs. Fortenberry brings tuna and cheese casserole and Sookie hears that she's disappointed to have missed seeing the blood.

A few moments later, Sookie snaps at her when she sees Mrs. Fortenberry moving a pie Gran made. Everyone judges Sookie, some thinking she did it and most thinking she's crazy.

Tara and Lafayette take her upstairs for some quiet. Sookie doesn't know what shes going to do. She's numb. Tara tells her to quit worrying about being appropriate.

Sookie can't block the voices out. Lafayette gives her a valium for later.

Jason drives to work, late. He's still feeling the after-effects of the V. Rene and Hoyt realize he doesn't know.

Sookie talks to Tara about Bill, and how she got through last night because of him.

Enter Jason who angrily storms up the stairs and busts into Sookies room, slapping her across the face. He says it should have been Sookie and it's her fault because she's sleeping with a vampire.

Tara intervenes, yelling at him and shoving him out of the room.

Andy stops Jason outside, asking him where he was last night. People gather on the porch to watch. When Jason realizes what Andy's accusing him of, he shoves him into his truck, with V-juiced super strength. The gossiping resumes downstairs and Tara comes down to run everyone off, including Sam.

Tara and Lafayette eat leftovers downstairs while Sookie rests upstairs.

She wakes up with hands around her throat, strangling her. She cries out for Bill, who wakes up, hearing her. But he can't come for her because it's daylight. When it's night, he busts into her house and runs upstairs, shaking her. She wakes up. She's fine.

He promises he'll watch over her. He stands outside on the lawn, drinking Tru Blood. The friendly dog strolls up and joins him.

At Adele's funeral, Jason sits next to Sookie and the town people listen. Sookie sees an elderly man being wheeled up by Jason. It's her Uncle Bartlett. Sookie asks him what he's doing there, saying he hasn't been part of the family for a long time. Jason tells her to give him a break.

Sookie says a few words about her grandmother, who she describes as everything to her. The gathered masses judge her, saying it's her fault Adele is dead and it should be her. As the voices continue Sookie yells at them, telling them to ""shut the f--- up!"" This doesn't exactly stop the noise. Sookie runs off.

Tara's drunk mother gets up to say something. Tara worries, but she holds it together and says Adele took care of Tara when she couldn't.

Jason catches up with Sookie. He apologizes, but Sookie is furious Jason invited Uncle Bartlett. He says whatever his problems were, family forgives each other. She says he has no idea what he's talking about. He says they're all each other has. She says they have nothing.

Tara accosts her mother after the service. She doesn't seem to remember beating Tara with a bottle. Tara says she had no right to speak for Adele. She reminds her mom of all the bad things she's done, her mom says it wasn't her, but her demon. Tara laughs at her. Her mother begs for a second chance, she wants to get the demon out of her, but it's expensive. Tara walks away.

Sookie strolls through the gravestones and finds one marked William Thomas Compton.

Jason, sweating and disturbed, tries to hold it together as the mourners leave. He gets in his truck and takes out another square of V. He throws it out the window, then thinks twice and gets out to look for it. He can't find it.

Sookie watches Adele's coffin as it's lowered into the ground. Sam joins her. He says he liked the part of her speech where she told the whole town to shut the F*** up. He offers to walk her home.

At her house she suggest she take a bath while he finds them a movie to watch. She tells him she needs to be alone.

As he walks away he runs into Tara coming up the drive. Neither of them want to be alone.

In her kitchen, Sookie takes out her grandmother's pecan pie. She mourns as she eats it, crying over each pecan bite.

Tara takes Sam to the motel where she's staying. She offers him a warm beer. He tries to talk to her, but she is rude and snide. He gets up to leave but she asks him to stay. He says he wants something real in his life. ""If we do this, we really did this,"" he tells her. They kiss.

At Sookie's, the pie is gone.

When it's dark out she runs out of her house in her nightgown. Bill opens his door, sensing her coming. They run to each other and start kissing.

Tara and Sam finish and the afterglow lasts for mere seconds before Tara jumps up, dresses, and says she has to go.

Meanwhile, Jason is being ridden by some woman, who says she loves him. This is how he mourns. He starts to cry.

At Bill's, with candles lit, they sit on the floor and go slowly. She brings out the vampire in him as his fangs emerge, but she pulls him close to kiss her.

Tara goes to see her mother.

Back to Bill and Sookie, coitus vampirus. She offers up her neck and says she wants him to. He bites her."

When they finish, they take a bath. He sets her straight on some vampire myths: they can reflect in mirrors, crucifixes do nothing. She says she never thought she'd find someone to do the naked stuff with.

She flashes back to when she was a child, when her Uncle Bartlett abused her. Gran, his sister, ran him off and never spoke to him again. She hates that in that otherwise perfect moment, she can't help but think about him.

Lafayette strips for his Web cam. Jason busts in mid-strip. He wants more V. He's willing to pay however Lafayette wants. Laf says no. Jason asks him what he's going to do, call the police? He goes for Lafayette's stash and Lafayette grabs him and throws him out.

Bill shows Sookie his underground bed. No one else knows where it is. It's time for him to sleep. The sun rises.

Tara helps her mom figure out how to dodge bills. Her mom wants $445 to exorcise her demon, which also told her to drink all the booze in the house, including the booze in her coffee cup. Tara tries to take it from her and when it spills, her mom sucks the booze from her clothes.

Sookie returns home to find Jason wandering off with silver candlesticks and a bag of other things.

He sees the bites on her neck and condemns her for it. He says he's taking half of what's his. He won't tell her what it's for. Sookie rips the bag he's carrying and Adele's jewelry spills out. He leaves with the candlesticks.

Tara stops by Sam's. The friendly dog is outside. He's angry over how she left him and telling her she's not very good at the relationship thing. She hasn't had much practice. ""Maybe I'm un-boyfriendable."" He's trying to fix something and she tells him which tool he needs. She gets a call.

Her mother is at the bank, trying to get a loan for an exorcism. She accuses the loan officer of being prejudiced against her because she's a Christian. She tries everything to get the money, including sitting in his lap. Tara comes to get her. Her mom screams that she can't take the demon inside her much longer. She takes her home. Tara takes some money out from under the sink.

At Merlotte's, Sookie wears a scarf around her neck and is in a terrific mood.

Tara calls in and says she's not coming. Jason's one-nighter calls him and tries to get him to come to the bar, but he's heading to Shreveport to the vampire bar.

Sam tells Lafayette not to mess with the AIDS-burger guys when they come in, but he gets back at them by roasting a spoon over the open fire and putting it in their soup.

Arlene can tell something is different about Sookie. She guesses what has happened, but hopes it was with Sam and not Bill. Sookie says it was Bill and she thinks she might be in love with him. She asks Arlene not to tell anyone and Arlene immediately tells her husband Rene and Sam overhears. Arlene hopes Sookie doesn't get pregnant. How will she nurse a baby with fangs?

Sam walks over to Sookie and rips the scarf off her neck. Seeing the bite marks, he calls her a damn fool and she responds by telling the entire bar that yes, she had sex with Bill, and it was great.

A very agitated Jason goes to the vampire bar, where the vamp at the door recognizes his last name on his ID. He's clearly jonesing. She glamours him and he says the reason he's there is to get some vampire blood. She lets him in, but wishes him luck getting out. Uncle Bartlett takes out his trash, confined to his wheelchair. Bill waits for him. He says he's there for Sookie, and chomps down.

Tara and her mother meet Ms. Jeannette in the woods for her exorcism. Tara gives her the cash. They head into Ms. Jeannette's trailer where all sorts of talismans hang. She tells Tara's mom to strip.

Sookie raves about her night with Bill to Lafayette, who says he was always too scared to let them bite him. He congratulates her for crossing that line, but calls her a skank when she walks away.

At the vampire bar, Jason clumsily tries to get vampire blood from the bartender. A girl overhears him and rescues him, saying she has what he's looking for.

Bill's three vampire acquaintances bust into Merlotte's. Malcolm says he's going to drain Sookie. Bill, disposing of her uncle's body, hears her distress.

Terry the war vet tries to help her, but one of them knocks him out. Sam breaks a pool cue to use as a stake. Sex Tape Vampire is about to suck Sam's face off when Bill shows up.

They want him to join their nest. He agrees to go with them. Sookie says he's not like them, but he stares at her and says he's not human, he's a vampire.

Jason introduces himself to Amy, the girl that took him from the bar. He's anxious to do the V.

Tara watches nervously as Ms. Jeannette places rocks on her mother. Tara's not taking it seriously, but Ms. J says she needs to. She has an opossum on standby for the demon to flee to. She starts humming and banging a drum as she chants. Tara watches as mom starts breathing heavily and heaving. When her mom is silent the opossum starts screeching in its cage. Ms. J picks it up and dunks it in a tub of water, drowning it.

The AIDS burger guys plan to go to Bill's house and ambush the vampires. Sookie wants Sam to stop them, but he says he doesn't care what happens to them. And he doesn't want Bill back in his bar. Sookie says he only went with them to get them away from the bar.

Back at his house, Amy is babbling about the earth and Jason is anxious to do the V. She slowly takes the stuff out, preparing it with aspirin for a fuller effect. She calls it nature's greatest gift. She grinds the blood on aspirin into a powder and puts it on a tray like its cocaine. She prays over it, honoring the earth. Jason plays along to get high. She snorts a line. Then Jason.

They hear birds chirping and everything goes out of focus. She kisses him.

Sookie calls Bill and leaves a message, warning him that a lynch mob is coming.

Jason hallucinates in his bedroom. Amy joins him in bed. They have slow, trippy sex, where each touch seems to send sparks between them. Ms. Jeannette tells Tara's mom her demon is gone, but they have to do something about Tara's demon. Tara's not buying it, but Ms. Jeannette asks her if she has many friends, has trouble keeping a job, has her own place and how long she's been with the same man. She tells Tara to find her when she's ready.

Sookie goes to Bill's house. She looks for him in his secret sleeping place. He's not there. She sits and waits. At daybreak, the lynch mob arrives at the vampire nest, where Sookie believes Bill is sleeping, the four idiots are armed with Molotov cocktails. They surround the house and toss their bottles in. One of them catches his arm on fire. His buddy puts him out as the house burns. They run.

Andy and Terry Bellefleur fish. Terry sees something and signals Andy to be quiet. They see Sam Merlotte running naked through the woods. They think that seems about right.

Andy gets a call. He's not happy at the news.

Sookie wakes up in Bill's house. Bill has not come home. Driving home, Sookie hears sirens and pulls up to the house in which the vampires were nesting. It had burned to the ground. The authorities were removing four vampire coffins, their remains now liquid."

At Tara's house, her newly unpossessed mother is taking out all her old bottles of ""demon juice."" She hasn't had a drink all day, and she made ho' cakes.

Jason wakes up in bed with the V pusher chick, basking in their afterglow. They agree they felt something in each other. She thinks he's wise, which he points out no one who knows him has ever called him. He doesn't want her to leave, he suggests they lay in bed all day and have sex and do V. She tells him they'll have to wait on the sex, which he finds confusing because he's pretty sure that's what they did all night. But no, her underwear is still on. It was the V.

Tara goes to Sookie's house and finds her with her head in the oven - cleaning it. Tara starts talking about her changed mother, oblivious to what Sookie has just gone through. When Tara sees Sookie's bite marks and judges her for them it quickly leads to Sookie swearing at her and telling her to leave.

Jason, with the V chick, is really excited to not have sex with her again. But she's out of V. Cold pizza tides him over. She asks how his parents died. He hesitates, but says it was a flash flood, they were carried out to the river. He and Sookie were at their grandmother's. They were on their way to pick them up, and Jason blames himself because if he'd been a better kid they would have trusted him to watch Sookie and wouldn't have been on the bridge to pick them up. He starts spilling, saying he's the worst brother in the world. But she's seen who he is inside and thinks he's good. They kiss.

Terry stops by Sam's and soon asks him if by chance he was out running naked in the woods that morning. Sam says he was working on his car, but Terry thinks it looked a lot like him. Terry thinks maybe he's seeing things again, but usually when he sees things it's insurgents.

At night, it rains and Sookie sits around her house. She gets flowers and, as it dries up, she takes them in the dark to the cemetery where she lays them on Bill's old grave, crying over it.

She walks barefoot among the graves until a hand reaches out grabs her, zombie style. A man starts clawing his way out of the dirt and she struggles to get away. Then he says her name. It's Bill. He's covered in dirt but with her down on the ground with him she goes from being attacked form the grave to having dirty vampire sex in record time. When he goes to bite her she tells him ""not the neck.""

Jason and V chick visit Merlotte's, where she's into all the dead animals on the wall. She talks about the circle of life and Jason proclaims: ""I wanna lick your mind.""

Sookie runs into work late, apologizing to Sam for being late. He gives her his condolences for Bill, but she's giddy. Bill's alive and she's great. Sam's less excited. She hugs Arlene, telling her she loves her, even if she is a bigot. She tells Hoyt and Rene that Bill got her voice mails that something might be brewing and decided to sleep in the cemetery. Rene wonders who the fourth body was. Sookie says they think it was a fang-banger, someone the vamps kept around for sex and blood. For someone who can hear what people are thinking, she doesn't seem to register the disapproving looks on their faces.

Jason's V chick, Amy, delivers Sookie's order while she's busy gabbing. Sookie isn't happy to see her brother, but he really wants her to like Amy. She charms Arlene, who tells Sam she thinks they might have found a replacement for Dawn. ""Looks like you did, too,"" Sookie tells him.

At Tara's house, her mother is dressed up for church with clean laundry drying in the back. Tara is dubious about her mother's transformation, and responds profanely to the churchwoman's suggestion she go sometime.

At Merlotte's, Arlene's babysitter falls through and Terry offers. She brushes him off and he compliments her clavicles in a way that makes her need to be somewhere else.

Amy and Sookie chitchat as they clear tables until Sookie tells Amy her brother is a dog and will stop calling as soon as he's tired of her. She tells Amy she seems like a sweet girl and she doesn't want her to get hurt. Amy says Jason hasn't realized half of his potential.

Arlene apologizes to Sookie if she said some things she didn't mean. And Sookie says yes, she'll babysit.

Hoyt tries to compliment Tara, who tells him to eff off in response. Sam, when he finishes pouring out bottles of Tru Blood, asks to talk to Tara, who's five kinds of angry, in his office. She goes in expecting to get chewed out. Instead he tells her they're the only ones that get it. And then the making out against the door begins.

Lying in bed with Bill, Sookie asks him if making love for more than 100 years ever gets old. Not with her it doesn't. They cuddle. She asks him what it's like to sleep in the ground. Not entirely comfortable, but safe. The doorbell rings, it's Arlene with the kids. Sookie tells Bill to stay, it'll do Arlene good.

Arlene's not thrilled to see Bill. She makes the kids each put on a silver bracelet and tells them to stick close to Sookie.

In another bed somewhere, Tara and Sam also bask. When his praise for her naked skills is less than effusive, she asks what she's doing wrong. He says it's minor, she grunts. Somehow this warps into her sounding like Serena Williams playing tennis and her calling him racist. She's up and putting her clothes on in no time flat, cursing the world.

Sookie and Bill, who's great with children, entertain Arlene's kids over ice cream (Bill's ""lactose intolerant""). When they ask to see his fangs, he puts chips in the corners of his mouth and vamps for them, harmless. The kids eat it up.

Arlene and Rene are stopped in the woods. She's in a rush to get back to the kids, but he needs to change the tire. He asks her to bring him the flashlight. When it doesn't work he tells her to check the batteries. There's a ring inside. He proposes.

Back at Sookie's, Arlene's excited. ""I know I've done it four other times, but it never gets old,"" she says. She asks Sookie to be a bridesmaid again. Rene says maybe they'll be next, then pauses awkwardly. When it's legal, he means.

Sookie comes down for breakfast, sun streams through the windows as Bill reads the paper. He's cooked her a huge breakfast. When she points out it's daylight, Bill turns and the side of his face starts bubbling. He bursts into flames and Sookie wakes up, alone.

The coroner gets a call from the sheriff, telling him that his assistant Neil was ID'd as the fang banger they found. The coroner sobs over the news.

The sheriff and Andy talk to Sam, who has little information on the night the men set out to torch the vampire house. He suggests they work on the murders of Maudette, Dawn and Adele. Andy leaves then comes back in, asking Sam if he recalls spending any time in the woods lately. Sam says yes, but Andy already knew that. Sam says he comes from a family of ""naturists,"" which is a clothing-optional lifestyle. His parents spent most of their life at a nudist colony in Texas. He says ever since they died he honors their memory once a year by running naked through the woods.

Lafayette tells Tara she got conned, but Tara says the messed up thing is that her mom's exorcism worked. ""Compared to a lifetime of Zoloft, $445's a bargain,"" he says.

Sam walks in on Sookie taking a vitamin and is upset when he finds out it's B-12.

Jason picks up Amy, who is jonesing hard for V. But Lafayette won't sell it to him.

Cut to Bill's. He comes home and senses someone's in his house. He goes upstairs to find Eric in his tub surrounded by candles. He has a favor to ask. Bill asks if it's a favor or an order. ""Honestly, did you think you could keep her to yourself?"" Eric asks him.

Amy and Jason wait for Lafayette to leave his house. Amy is starting to tweak. She tells him the best way to follow Lafayette's car.

There's a knock at the door of a man's house, it's Lafayette, asking if the man is ready to party. He's a slightly dorky, middle-aged...vampire. He pours Lafayette some wine, nervously. He starts to nuzzle Lafayette, who stops him, saying he needs his juice first, then they'll party. He takes out his syringe. ""I always look forward to Monday nights, first I watch 'Heroes' then I have you,"" Eddie says. He asks Lafayette if he'd still want him even without the blood, Lafayette says of course. They start kissing (as the Bangles ""Eternal Flame"" plays on the stereo).

Bill takes Sookie to Fangtasia, at Eric's request. He tells Sookie why they're there and that Eric is sheriff of Area 5 and they do not want to anger him. As long as his requests are reasonable, they should go along with them. She tells him about her dream. He says it wouldn't happen quite like that, he wouldn't immediately burst into flames. ""So I guess we'll never have breakfast together,"" she says.

Tara visits the voo doo woman, who was expecting her.

Andy checks up on Sam's naturist story, where the naked man who answers the phone says they've never had any Merlottes.

Inside Fangtasia, which is closed for the night, Eric asks Sookie to listen to their accountant. They think he stole $60,000 from them. Eric says it would be a favor to him and Bill if she'd listen to him. It's humbling to have to ask a human for help, glamoring him didn't work. She agrees, but only if they promise to turn the guilty person over to the police. She listens.The accountant is innocent.

When Lafayette leaves Eddie's house, Amy and Jason prep to go in. She takes off her long, lariat silver necklace. Jason sees something she has and asks what the hell it is.

Inside, Eddie watches right wing TV condemn vampires on a pro-vampire talk show. His doorbell rings. Jason says he's a friend of Lafayette's and Eddie opens the door. Amy throws a chainmail silver hood over him and he falls down, screaming with the sound of flesh sizzling. Amy orders Jason to tie up his feet with her necklace. Jason is shocked but helps her carry him to the car.

Sookie listens to the last of the human employees, a woman named Ginger. Sookie hears her honestly think it wasn't her, but she knows who did it. When Sookie asks who, the name has been erased from Ginger's mind. The vamps figure out she was glamored by a vampire and just then the bartender lunges across the bar at Sookie - fangs out - and grabs her by the throat."

Bill reacts by snapping off a beer tap and staking him through the back to protect her. Longshadow spews blood all over Sookie, creating a ""Carrie"" moment as she ends up drenched. Eric and Pam watch, unconcerned as the bartender's face melts and shrivels. One dead vampire.

Ginger, the human employee whose thoughts lead Sookie to Longshadow, cleans up the soupy remains, freaked to be down among the ick. Eric commands Pam to glamour Ginger when she's done. Pam's worried there might not be anything left in Ginger, but Eric says the alternative is to turn her and Pam agrees they're not that desperate.

Eric buys Bill a blood as Sookie cleans up. Eric isn't pleased Bill killed a vampire for a human. He has to pay for it. Eric wants the girl. Bill objects and Eric suspects he's in love with Sookie. Eric agrees he would have made Longshadow pay, but not in front of non-vampire witnesses.

Jason drives with Amy and the vampire Eddie in the trunk. He's freaked out by their recent and on-going kidnapping and she's calm.

At the bar, Pam brings Sookie a change of clothes. She tells Sookie she's not going anywhere until Eric is done with Bill. There's vampire in Sookie's cleavage.

Ginger re-meets Sookie, glamoured.

Jason carries his vampire booty into a basement with Amy. Both Jason and Eddie want to know what Amy has planned as she ties him to a lawn chair and drains Eddie's blood. She tries to placate Jason with blood, but he's unnerved. Amy drinks it straight out of a thimble poured form Eddie's arm and Jason, watching her enter her happy place, seems to become less worried. Eddie tells him not too, but Jason takes a swig.

Tara tries to get exorcism answers. She gets a quote: $799.95, because Tara's demon is worse than her mother's. She tells Tara not to wait, her loneliness is spreading to her eyes. She tells her to count backwards from 10 when she's alone to see if she can stand herself.

Bill brings Sookie home, dressed in leather. He tells her everything's fine with Eric, but at home, it isn't. There's blood on the walls and Sookie's cat is hanging from the ceiling fan.

Amy and Jason pause mid-sex to thank the vampire for his gifts. As they proceed to do it in front of him, he doesn't seem to appreciate the gratitude. A trippy dreamlike sex sequence shows them frolicking through woods and fairylands. Meanwhile, Eddie continues to bleed.

Bill wraps around Sookie, clothed, in bed. He tells her he'll protect her because the trouble she's in is his fault. She says it's hers because she chose it. Sookie closes her eyes and sees her grandmother.

Amy and Jason frolic in a sun-drenched meadow. She tells him to lie down and listen to the trees. Jason feels light-headed and is talking funny. Amy feeds him an almond, telling him raw food makes the experience better, even better than last night.

Jason worries someone will hear Eddie yelling from inside his basement. He thinks they should feed him. He's worried Eddie is going to die. ""So what?"" says Amy. Her plan is that things will work out because they have to. She deserves to have something good happen, she says. She tells Jason she loves him. He turns away like a big dork and grabs a beer. She repeats it, seeming sweet for a girl who just kidnapped a vampire. Jason tells her he loves her, too.

Tara counts backwards in the mirror but is interrupted by her mother, telling her Sam is at the door with flowers. Her mother assumes she slept with him. He came to apologize.

Tara tells him they're not going to work and asks him if he's a masochist. As proof of her unsuitability she tells him about the exorcism she's starting to think she needs but how she doesn't have the money for it. She runs him off.

At the bar, Arlene finagles an engagement party from Sam.

Sookie comes to work, saying there's nothing good about the morning.

Jason sits on the road crew, staring at the trees. Renee jackhammers a tree and Jason tackles him to prevent him from hurting it. Rene does not share Jason's newfound nature love as the running jackhammer nearly hits him. Hoyt tries to talk to Jason, but calls him ""Jay,"" which prompts Jason to ask if he was on the football team and throw him to the ground. Jason does not seem to be handling his V well.

At Merlotte's, Sookie waits on Andy Bellefleur, who wants to talk to Sam. While he decides what to order, Sookie tells him to hurry up and figure out who's trying to kill her. She tells him about her cat. Amy interrupts, suggesting Sookie take a break.

Amy checks on her outside. Soon they're talking about Arlene and marriage and then what Amy intends with Jason. She tells Sookie Jason misses her and loves her. Sookie concludes Amy is way too good for Jason.

Jason arrives home and flips on the TV. He's aggravated by vampire advocate Nan Flanagan on TV. He hears whimpering from the basement and checks on Eddie, who's in pain from sitting in the same spot. Jason moves him, but hurts his back.

Tara finds $800 in an envelope and goes to ask Sam about it. He tells her they'll talk after work.

Bill golfs. (Yes, golfs.) But on a Wii. The doorbell rings. It's Eric, Pam and a new guy, Chow, Longshadow's replacement. Bill says he takes it it couldn't be avoided (we don't know what yet). He says he has to stop by the bar and tell Sookie he'll be gone for a while.

In his basement with Eddie, Jason has recovered and is feeling good. He asks about Eddie, who used to be an accountant. He tells Jason he used to be married, and only recently realized he was gay. Jason is sympathetic, and tells him he doesn't look that gay. He tells Jason about seeing an unattractive gay vampire surrounded by pretty young things and making up his mind then to turn. Jason says that's crazy.

Bill and his entourage arrive at Merlotte's. Bill needs to talk to Sam. He tells Sam he's been called away and he needs Sam to watch over Sookie. Sam's not happy Bill's asking, but he'll do it for Sookie.

Eric and Pam pass out brochures for Fangtasia. Eric announces that vampires know when a human has wronged them. Amy freezes.

Bill tells Sookie he has to stand trial. She realizes he lied to her about everything being OK. Sookie's upset he has to leave and cries as she kisses him good-bye while Eric yells at him to hurry up.

Tara, having seen the whole thing, tries to talk to Sookie. She starts to apologize for their earlier fight and Sookie tells her she can't even remember what she's supposed to be mad about. Tara gives her a hug.

Jason tells Eddie about the death of his parents. Eddie lends a sympathetic ear. He feels bad that Jason had to grow up without a male influence, like Eddie's son now that he's gone. Jason worries that Eddie might glamour him but Eddie says he hasn't learned that yet. He asks Jason if he's going to marry Amy. When Jason says she might be the one, Eddie tells him not to, that she's a psychopath. Jason swears at him and leaves for more beer.

Tara tries to return Sam's money, but he's not taking it. He says people didn't even know vampires existed two years ago, so an exorcism isn't the craziest thing in the world. She softens and thanks him, then kisses him. Sookie sees them making out.

She asks Amy to cover the rest of her shift. When Amy asks if it's a good idea to go home, Sookie says she's going to stay at Bill's because no one will look for her there.

Sam comes out, zipping up, and asks Amy where Sookie is. When she tells him, he runs out, but is stopped by an increasingly suspicious Andy Bellefleur in the lot. He calls Sam on his naturalist story and says they need to talk. Sam says he forgot something in the bar and will be right back.

Sookie drives, checking her mirrors nervously.

The watchful dog runs out of Merlotte's by Andy.

Seconds later he's at Bill's front door. Sookie greets him and welcomes him inside for the night. He looks away as she changes, a gentlemanly dog.

Sookie invites him on the bed with her, deciding to call him Dean.

Jason returns home with beer...and blood. He feeds it to Eddie.

Sookie wakes up in the middle of the night, thinking Dean's sleeping on her feet. She sits up to see something is on her feet... naked Sam. They both scream."

Tara meets with the voodoo woman, Ms. Jeannette, in the woods. They sit next to a campfire and Tara asks a million questions. The woman spits in Tara's hand and puts something in her hand and makes her hold it over the fire then rub it on her face as she talks about demons traveling via cell phone and microwave, which is why she lives in the woods. Tara drinks from a vial - ""snake juice.""

In Jason's basement, Eddie wakes up as Amy drains him, explaining she's a good person because she's an organic vegan and her carbon footprint is minuscule. She punches his arm because he has a clot forming. Amy goes to look for tape and finds the empty Tru Bloods Jason gave Eddie. She thinks it's beneath them to lie to each other. Eddie tells Amy that Jason loves her and thinks she might be the one. He tells her if he dies there Jason will never forgive her.

Sam explains shape-shifting to Sookie. It's hereditary, but he was adopted. He can turn into almost anything, including birds, but flying's hard. He can't turn into people, they're too complex. It wears off if he falls asleep and on a full moon he can't control the shift (which explains what Terry and Andy saw). But don't call him a werewolf, they're nasty- and real. Sookie tries to process the fact that all these things exist. ""Life is just getting too weird too fast,"" she says.

He tries to put his arm around her but she yells at him. He thought she of all people would understand. He wanted to tell her for years. She's grossed out that she kissed him and he wanted to do more.

Voodoo Woman chants and Tara convulses on the ground, holding her stomach in pain. She feels sick and voodoo woman tells her to let the anger and hate go. She throws up. She sees a younger version of herself standing nearby. Voodoo Woman tells her a demon will take any form to stay alive, only she can destroy it. She gives Tara a knife and Tara approaches the girl. She swings the knife through the air into seemingly nothing. But it comes up bloody. The voodoo woman tells her the demon is gone forever.

Jason primps in the mirror. Amy wants to talk about Eddie, she thinks the way they've been treating him is really uncivilized. He agrees. She wants them to make him love them, help him develop Stockholm Syndrome so they can keep him in the house forever and sell his blood when they need money.

Tara goes home and tells her mom about her exorcism. They decide to celebrate.

Sam, Terry and Sookie prepare for Arlene's engagement party. Arlene shows up and suggests they redo the decorations. The real dog that Sam modeled himself on watches. Sam thinks back to his childhood, when he shifted and his mother saw him.

The politician stops by Lafayette's. He wants V juice, but Lafayette is sold out. He can't restock until after dark. The politician has a speech that night and gets stage fright. Lafayette finds another way to calm him.

Tara and her mom drive back from getting food out of town, but her mom feels sick. Tara stops at a drugstore to get her some Pepto. The employee looks like Ms. Jeannette, but with hair and glasses. And not living in the woods. Tara confronts her and she 'fesses up. The snake juice was ipecac and peyote. Tara's furious and feels stupid. She says her mom will start drinking again when she finds out. Ms. Jeannette suggests she not find out, faith is a powerful thing.

Everyone parties at Merlotte's. Terry tries to talk to Sookie, who wishes Bill was there. ""There's some dead people I wish was still around, too,"" he says.

The vampires gather. A head vampire presides over a tribunal. They rip out the fangs of a vamp who fed on another vamp's human. His punishment is three months of starving until his fangs grow back.

Eric presents Bill.

Jason feeds Eddie Tru Blood, happy not to have to sneak. He tells Eddie about their plan to have Eddie live with them. Eddie asks if Amy told him she found his Tru Blood. He says Amy is playing him.

Lafayette calls Eddie from his house, where the door is knocked down. He finds something and knows Jason is involved

At the party, Arlene tells Rene to ask Sookie to dance. Rene tells Sookie she deserves better than a vampire, although he says he has nothing against them. Sam cuts in. He asks for a truce. She's mad he didn't trust her enough to tell her, and that he didn't tell her about Tara. He says there's nothing to tell. He says he didn't tell her because he knew this is how she'd react.

Jason sort of ignores Amy and tells Hoyt and Rene he met Amy at Fangtasia. He talks about how he feels about her, but says he might have lost the upper hand in the relationship. Rene tells him to take it back.

Bill tries to defend himself, but the head vamp, the Magister, isn't hearing it. Bill tells him Longshadow was stealing from Eric, who backs him up. Bill tells him the human exposed Longshadow, which Eric also backs up. Eric tries to cool Bill off when he speaks too well of humans and upsets the Magister. The usual sentence is five years in a coffin chained with silver, during which time he'd probably go insane and waste away. But the Magister is feeling creative.

Arlene raves about Rene to Amy and Sookie, saying he's just so decent and nice to her and the kids. Amy raves about Jason and Sookie complains that you can't really trust anyone, the wet blanket at the love fest. Tara struts up, loaded, and when Sookie tells her she shouldn't be with Sam, she says ""at least he doesn't drink my blood.""

Andy, still looking for answers, asks Sam what his story is. He was adopted and on his own by 15 -- the truth. Andy asks who took him in. He wants to know what his life was like before he moved to Bon Temps and people started getting killed.

Flashback to teen Sam coming home from school to a completely empty house, except for his bedroom.

Andy says he has no record before he moved there. Tara spills beer on Andy and goes over to Sam, kissing him and pulling him away from Andy.

Tara takes him in the office and tries to get Sam to have sex with her. He stops her, asking what she wants from him. She turns back to angry Tara and storms out.

Lafayette, angry, finds Jason at the party, telling him his supplier is missing. He chews Jason out for always acting like everything's fine, even when people are dying around him. He shoves Jason to the ground, saying he won't be next.

The Magister tells Bill he owes them a life. They take a teenage girl named Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) out of the trunk of a car. Bill says he'll take the coffin instead. Jessica begs for her life, promising to be a good Christian.

Sookie goes inside to get ice. The lights go out. She flashes to the scene of a woman being attacked somewhere. Someone springs from the dark and tries to choke Sookie. She hits him with the ice bucket and runs, hiding in the walk-in fridge. The person follows. She flashes to a woman dying as a man strangles her. Sookie manages to escape and runs back into the bar and into Sam. She asks him not to leave her and he holds her tight.

Tara speeds down the road, drinking. Suddenly, she comes upon a woman standing in the middle of the road next to a pig and swerves to avoid them.

At Jason's, Amy and Jason argue as he tries to be the boss. Amy tells Jason that Eddie will kill them. Jason runs to free him from the silver chains telling Amy that he won't. As Jason starts to undo the ties, Amy grabs a fence post and spikes Eddie through the chest, killing him.

Bill says if they want to torture someone, torture him. The Magister counters that according to their records Bill's never been a maker. He asks if Bill knows the procedure. Yes. ""Then proceed.""

Bill approaches Jessica, taking her hand. She says Jesus will take her home to Heaven. Bill asks her name and glamors her, trying to calm her. But glamor is not permitted. The Magister tells Bill to do as he's told. Bill grabs Jessica, staring at her neck, asking for forgiveness. He chomps down. Jessica screams as Bill feasts and the other vampires look on lustily."

At Sookie's, Sam leaves a message for Tara asking where she is, worried about her. Sookie makes Sam a bed. She didn't get any sense of who the killer was, just pictures. His thoughts were red and black and snarly. There was something familiar, but she didn't recognize him. She saw a woman die in his thoughts, a waitress maybe.

Sookie thinks Bill isn't coming back because he would have felt how scared she was and still didn't come for her. Sookie asks if he heard from Tara. He rubs her shoulder. She says good-night.

Sam loads his rifle.

Tara tells a police officer about the naked lady and a huge pig in the middle of the road. The woman knows Tara's drunk and takes her in.

Jason and Amy clean up the mess that remains of Eddie. Jason looks at Amy like the psycho she is and tells her it was going to be OK his way. They start screaming at each other as Amy says Jason was there the whole way and knew it was going to end badly. As he starts to clean he throws up and Amy tries to comfort him, telling him Eddie was already dead and was a predator. She tells him not to let a vampire come between them. She says what they have is beautiful, as they sit in a basement surround by vampire blood and guts.

Sam comes down to Sookie's and eats breakfast. Sookie doesn't want to wait for the killer to come for her. She's looking through the Yellow Pages. In her sleep, she remembered the woman's name tag. Cindy, and she worked somewhere with the word ""pie"" in the name. Sam recognizes the name. He's going with her.

Amy feeds Eddie guck into the disposal. Jason comes in, angry. He smashes the vials of V and tells Amy he wants every drop out of his house. If she doesn't like it, she can pack her bags and go.

Lafayette paints his toes at the bar, angrily watching his politician lover, a state senator, make an anti-vampire rights speech on TV. They announce where he's staying that night. Amy comes in, looking rough. Lafayette asks if Jason dragged her into his b.s.

At the pie place, Sookie and Sam get nothing from a dumb waitress, but a man at the counter knows her. He tells them she was killed and they don't know who did it. She has a brother, but he's gone: Drew Marshall. He says people said she was carrying on with the vampires.

Tara calls her mom from jail for bail money.

At work on the road crew, Jason tries to get Rene and Hoyt to party with him that night. Hoyt asks why he wants to hang with them when he's got Amy. He thinks about it for a minute and then confesses that Amy likes V. Rene asks if she sleeps with vampires, too. Jason says she says she doesn't. Rene says they'll go out tomorrow. ""These things have a way of working out,"" he tells Jason.

Sookie and Sam visit a police station where she hears the cop thinking about his mistress. The cop becomes unhelpful when he sees Sookie's vampire bites. She suggests she'll tell his wife about his affair and call the Vampire League of America. He says he can fax a photo of Drew to the Bon Temps police.

Lafayette, dressed in a slick, respectable suit, goes to shake hands with his hypocritical politician lover. He shakes his hand and smiles through threats, commending the man for taking a stand against vampires and gays and praising him for the risk he's taking because, after all, so many things can happen to someone such as himself for taking a stand.

Jason arrives home to a candlelit dinner. Amy says it was all her fault and she's sorry. She say's shed do anything for him. Jason, thought of vampire guck wiped away by a home cooked meal, relents. They hug.

Bill waits graveside for Jessica the new vampire to rise. She digs her way out of the ground. She comes up screaming, asking for help.

Sam and Sookie drive home, bonding. Sookie asks him if he loves Tara. He says he likes her and cares about her, but she doesn't make it easy to love her. They're friends.

Sam says he's not that easy to love either and Sookie tells him he's wrong. Sam asks if she loves Bill. She thinks she does, but where is he?

Jason unbuttons his pants, for eatin' room, and raves about Amy's fantastic homecooked meal. She has something she wants to show him, but doesn't want him to get mad. She saved one drop of V. She talks about V being how they started their relationship, so that's how they should end it, to complete the circle. Jason resists for a minute, but then agrees to one last time.

Bill tries to explain to petulant young Jessica that she's a vampire now. She can't go home. At first she thinks of the things she'll miss: her parents, her sister....then no more homeschooling, no more belts, no more clarinet... She's thrilled. She starts celebrating. She thinks being a vampire means she can kill anyone she wants. She whines like a teenager. He tries to feed her Tru Blood. She thinks it tastes terrible. She calls him the worst maker ever. She pouts.

Tara's mom comes for her, but she's not there to bail her out. Her mom tells her she won't let Tara come home. She thinks Tara's on the road to Hell and she's a danger to her soul and she can't have her in her house. Tara's the only reason she has a house, Tara points out. She put up with her mom beating her and taking her money and sending her to school dirty. And now she's turning her back on Tara. Tara tells her to leave. When her mom says she loves her, she says she doesn't, and never did.

Jason and Amy lounge in bed. It seems to start raining on them. Suddenly they're outside, running. Someone enters their house. He's wearing boots. As they romp in their V dreams he approaches them, asleep in bed. We don't see his face. He's wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He takes off his belt and wraps it around Amy's neck. In their V dream, they dance. Amy doesn't seem to notice she's being choked. Then in the V trip she flies away. Jason laughs. Then he wakes up next to her corpse.

He doesn't realize it at first. Then he sees the marks on her neck. He cries, confused. He calls 911.

Bill takes Jessica to Eric, wanting help. She doesn't want to stay with Bill. Eric bosses her effectively. Bill says he needs to get back. Bill tells Eric he'd be in his debt and return the favor if Eric would take her.

A woman pays Tara's bail. She doesn't know her. She's Mary Ann Forrester. She's some kind of social worker, Tara guesses. Tara doesn't want a ride home. Mary Ann says Tara can come home with her. Tara checks that she's not a ""Jesus person."" She's about to leave when Tara stops her. They walk out to Mary Ann's extremely nice car. Andy Bellefleur pulls up and tells her to move her car. They drive off.

Andy takes Jason in.

Sookie and Sam watch TV close on the couch. Sookie tells him she had a good day with him. Sam says the day she walked in looking for a job was probably the best day of his life. She believes him. They start to kiss.

Just then, Bill busts in. He rips Sam off Sookie and starts to fight him. She breaks it up, yelling at Bill for leaving her with no promise to return and then attacking the man who's protecting her. He says if she knew what he'd done to return to her.... She rescinds his invitation to enter her house. He has to leave. Back inside, Sam asks her why she can't see what he's really like. ""Sam, my living room's wrecked, I've got a killer, a vampire and a shape-shifter on my plate, right about now, I'm not thinking about being with anybody.""

Mary Ann's house is enormous. She invites Tara in.

At the police station, Andy gloats, saying he knew Jason was the killer from the beginning. Jason is resigned. He says he doesn't remember what he's done, to any of them. But they keep dying around him, so it must be him, right? He tells him he took V with Amy and when he woke up, she was dead. They were alone, he thinks he must have done it. But he doesn't know why, he loved her. Andy screams at him that he hated Dawn and Maudette, Jason denies it.

Andy accuses him of killing his grandmother, but Jason denies it. Andy says its the worst confession he's ever heard. But that's all Jason has. He says he doesn't want to hurt anyone else. He asks them to lock him up.

The fax of Drew Marshall arrives at the police station and a secretary careless covers it up with files. But we see who it is: Rene."

(Rene gets the truck.) Rene says it's not like Jason killed a bunch of ""innocent women."" Jason objects to the characterization of his grandmother as a ""fangbanger.""

Sookie bullies her way back to see Jason, telling him she wishes she'd gotten there sooner before he confessed to something he didn't do. She tells him to shut up because she's real close to finding out who the real killer is. Rene, the real killer, stands 10 feet behind her.

(Seriously, how good are these credits?)

She tells Sookie about Drew Marshall and how he killed his sister Cindy. She hears Rene wonder why she doesn't go to the cops if she knows all this. She tells him she doesn't know what he looks like, but she's been in his head. She asks Andy Bellefleur if she got the fax with a photo of the real killer. He says he knows nothing about a fax, and why bother since he's got the real killer? She tells Andy he's a poor excuse for a cop and a human being and it's a matter of time before everyone knows it.

Tara wakes up in a plush bed, with a robe laid out for her. A man makes her breakfast. Maryann joins her for breakfast. Tara is figuring out she's not just a social worker. Maryann sees Tara's situation as an opportunity. She has room to rebuild her life. Tara, feeling awkward, makes an excuse to leave, but Maryann says they both know she's got nowhere to go. She says she just wants to help.

The manservant, making Tara's bed, picks up her ringing phone. It's Sam. The manservant hangs up and pockets Tara's phone.

Sookie comes into work, telling Sam she plans to hire a PI to find out who Drew Marshall is.

Jason gets a visitor, Orry Dawson. He's there on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun - as Jason calls it, the ""vampire-hating church."" Orry says what Jason did was a service to his race and to Jesus and he should be proud of it. The church has started a fund for Jason's defense. In the meantime, the man slips him some church literature and calls him a ""brave soldier.""

At Maryann's mansion, Tara goes swimming, beginning with a cannonball. She comes inside to find an enormous spread of food laid out. A young, attractive black man is playing guitar on the couch. His name is Benedict, but he goes by ""Eggs."" He's staying there until he gets back on her feet. ""So, collecting stray black people, that's some sort of hobby of hers?"" Tara says.

When Maryann found him he was worse off than Tara. He calls Maryann a ""miracle worker."" He starts strumming his guitar again and Tara tries to relax.

Outside, Maryann vibrates. She sits in a chair outside, moving in place at hyperspeed.

Rene, enjoying Jason's truck, drives to Merlotte's. Sookie hears Andy loudly telling the story of Jason's confession, but Sheriff Bud corrects him, saying that Jason didn't exactly confess. Bud excuses himself. The cute girl sitting next to Andy offers to buy him a beer and he laps up the adoration.

Sookie hears everyone looking at her, judging her for being Jason's sister. Drew/Rene is sitting nearby, but she hears nothing. She tells Sam she needs to get out of there. She gives him a hug, thanking him for everything.

Sookie gets in her car but it won't start. Rene surprises her, asking if everything's OK. He offers to take a look, but later confesses he doesn't know much about cars. He offers to give her a ride and stay with her until Sam gets off work when she says she can't be alone. Terry drives up, telling Sookie that he told Andy he's known killers and Jason ain't one. ""No one ever listens to me, but they should,"" Terry says.

Before Rene closes Sookie's hood he glances at the sabotaged part.

Rene gives Sookie a ride and when he asks her if she can really hear what he's thinking she hears him thinking that he should think about nothing. She tells him not to bother, you always eventually think of something. She tells him it's weird, but his thoughts don't have an accent.

She talks about how hard it is to hear people think horrible things. She tells Rene that Jason is all she's got left, she's lost everyone.

Rene/Drew says he's lost people too. It doesn't get easier, but you find ways to cope.

Arlene walks into the living room to find her two young daughters watching the Maudette vampire sex tape. One says it's Rene's; they found it in the garage. Arlene looks at the box of video tapes and finds a cassette on perfecting the Cajun dialect.

Rene looks around the house, noticing a rifle leaned against the fire place.

Lafayette cleans up, tossing Sam Rene's work vest that he left behind. Sam takes a whiff of it and finally we understand why Sam rolled around sniffing Dawn's sheets after she was found dead. He recognizes the scent. Sam runs outside, where Terry tells him Sookie left with Rene 23 minutes ago.

At her house, Sookie makes iced tea and Rene fails at thinking of nothing. Sookie sees Rene thinking about Gran and how he came in to find her and started saying she wasn't supposed to be there and attacking her. Sookie sees Rene go after her grandmother and she drops her pitcher of iced tea. She tries telling Rene she's just jumpy as she calmly walks into the other room to the shotgun.

Rene lets her get to it and point it at him, as he tells her she's not going to shoot him. She tries to, but he's removed the shots. She hears him switch voices in his head, cursing, condemning her for sex with vampires. Sookie hauls off and whacks him upside the head with the shotgun and he drops to the ground. She runs outside. Rene chases her through the woods near her house, seeing Drew noticing his sister Cindy's bite marks and then attacking her. As she keeps running, Rene stops, screaming that he can feel her in his head. Sookie sees Rene attacking Dawn, then him sneaking in to kill Amy as she lay next to Jason.

Bill wakes up in his coffin. It's broad daylight outside, but he can hear Sookie screaming and terrified. Sam arrives at her house and sees a belt and signs of a struggle. He runs outside. Bill gets up from his coffin and his skin immediately starts sizzling in the sunlight.

Rene stops running, trying to lure her out saying he didn't mean it. His thoughts list all the vile things he's going to do to her. Sookie hides in the cemetery in a spot dug for a grave. She hears Rene think that he must have lost her in the woods and should go back and check and so Sookie turns to peek her head out of the ground - but he's standing above her. He slugs her. He yanks her out of the ground and throws her against a gravestone and starts strangling her. Bill stumbles onward in the daylight, all of his hair gone and his skin almost completely blistered off. Sam the dog comes running, biting Rene's neck, but Rene manages to get the dog off and starts kicking it. He watches as the dog, hurt, changes into naked Sam. Bill, smoldering nearby, can't quite make it to where Rene is kicking the daylights out of Sam, ""the freak of nature."" Sookie regains her senses and grabs a nearby shovel. She whacks Rene to the ground. When he starts to come back up she takes the shovel and digs deep, almost completely severing his head.

Sam gets up behind her, apparently OK. Sookie, not yet taking in the trauma, sees a smoking pile of man nearby and runs to Bill. His flesh is charred black and he can barely move. He tells her he's sorry. Naked Sam comes to help, picking Bill up as Sookie sobs. Sam puts Bill in the dug grave and covers him with dirt.

Sookie wakes up, bruised and battered, to find Tara standing over her with Sam and Lafayette. Sookie's on pain meds. She asks Tara if Sam told them he saved her life. She explains how he turned into dog, but they chalk it up to pain meds. She tells Sam to let people see the real him because there's nothing there not to love. ""Right back at you,"" he says as Tara sits there somewhat awkwardly.

Arlene comes in with an enormous bouquet of flowers and burst into tears.

Sheriff Bud tells Andy the D.A. is dropping the charges. The marks on Amy's neck match Rene's belt and he, Drew Marshall, nearly killed Sookie. Bud tells Andy to let Jason go. Andy goes back to let Jason out, angry and cussing. He tells Jason, who has been reading church literature all day, that his release is a miracle.

Arlene apologizes for that whole ""sorry my fiance was a serial killer and murdered your grandmother and friends and tried to kill you"" thing. She can't believe she didn't know. Sookie says no one did.

Sookie says Rene kept that part of himself locked away in some dark corner of his mind. Arlene, sobbing, can't stop apologizing. Arlene says if she ever finds another man she wants Sookie to look in his head and tell her everything, ""'cause I have the worst taste in men."" Arlene asks if Bill is going to be OK. Sookie says she doesn't think so and starts crying.

Lafayette says his good-byes, leaving Tara and Sam on the porch alone. Sam asks Tara where she's been, saying he left her five messages. She says she didn't get them. She tells him she's glad he was there for Sookie. Tara says Sookie's right, he is a good guy and he deserves to get everything he wants, and so does she. Maryann pulls up in her shiny sports car and Tara introduces them. But it's unnecessary.

With Tara out of earshot, Sam asks Maryann what she's doing there. ""Did you think I wasn't going to find you? You silly, silly dog,"" she tells him, leaving.

Arlene tells Sookie she should have known, because there were things he liked to do in bed that ""no normal man ever does.""

Jason comes in. Seeing how bruised Sookie is, he says he can't believe he gave Rene his truck. When he says if Rene was still alive he'd kill him again, Arlene excuses herself.

Jason tells Sookie that he had a lot of time in jail to think about how he's never done anything with his life. He says when he was in jail, he was saved and he thinks the bad stuff happened for a reason. He just isn't sure what that is yet. He thinks he's meant to do something important with his life, and as soon as he figures out what it is, he's not going to screw it up.

Lafayette takes out the garbage at Merlotte's. Something swoops out of the trees, freaking him out. He jumps on the Dumpster as it comes at him.

The swooping comes to Sookie's front door. Her doorbell rings. It's Bill. ""You're alive,"" she says. ""Well, technically, no."" He says he fed. He looks completely healed. She invites him in. They hug. He sees her bruises and starts to bite his wrist for her, but she says she wants to feel human, even if that means healing slowly. She can't believe he was willing to sacrifice himself for her. Her life is too short to be angry. They start to kiss.

Two weeks later

A news report announces Vermont has legalized vampire marriage. Arlene teases Sookie that maybe she and Bill should get married now. Sam, back to being bitter, chimes in that he could throw the party because it'd be cheap without food or drinks. Tara tells him he's about as subtle as a flying brick and starts quoting Maryann to him, which he doesn't appreciate. Sam asks her if she's heard from Lafayette. She hasn't. Terry smiles awkwardly at Arlene and sweetly tells her that people disappear but the good parts of them stick around. Then he tells her her hair is ""like a sunset after a bomb went off, pretty."" Then he walks away awkwardly while Arlene is charmed.

Jason attends church with Orry, where the preacher says they won't rest until they've brought God's light onto each and every ""blood sucking abomination.""

At the bar, Tara tells Andy to head on home, but he's deep into feeling sorry for himself. She pours him an extra shot and tell him it's easier for her not to hate him, because that takes too much energy.

Sookie brings Hoyt his food, telling him she's celebrating with Bill later. Hoyt says he'd marry a nice vampire girl if he could find one.

Bill plays the piano and Jessica the bratty vamp strides in, followed by a beaten down Eric and Pam. Pam proclaims Jessica ""extremely annoying."" They're turning her back over to Bill. They wish him luck and leave.

Andy is deep into self pity and Sookie tries to get him to leave. She hears him feeling sorry for himself, thinking she must be happy she was right about him failing and she smiles kindly, saying she's going to call his sister to pick him up and calling him Detective Bellefleur.

Sam, in a snit, goes to his office safe and starts loading stacks of money into a garbage bag.

Out in the parking lot, Andy thinks someone stole his car, but then Tara points it out a few yards over. The three of them walk over to it. Andy opens the back door and a leg with painted toenails the same color as Lafayette's plops out. Tara and Sookie scream."

In Tokyo a man gains entry into an apartment with the old 'found money"" ruse. Once inside the man, private investigator John Sugar looks around and asks for the hostage child, the son of a Yakuza gang boss. He offers to give the man two hours head start to leave Japan. The man attacks Sugar with a knife, who quickly subdues him into a sleeper hold, but has his left bicep slashed. Sugar finds the boy and a woman attendant in a closet. The Yakuza boss arrives, and gives Sugar a thick envelope. Sugar returns to his hotel and superglues the arm wound, upset with the ruined Savile Row suit jacket. Later he goes to a bar for a drink and makes eye contact with another man.

Before returning to LA he receives a text invitation to meet Jonathan Siegel for a new assignment. Taking a private limo service he notices the driver is Arabic and starts a friendly chat in their language admitting he lived in Damascus for a few years. Sugar calls his handler Ruby, a younger woman who seems mildly upset he took a case directly, without going through her, she urges him to take a rest. Arriving at the Siegel house he asks the driver to take his bags to his hotel. Sugar briefly meets lawyer Thomas Kinsey and is then introduced to the elderly and wealthy Siegel. Siegel is an old time movie director, Sugar professes he is a big movie buff. Siegel then asks Sugar to find his granddaughter, Olivia, who has been missing for two weeks. A bit of a wild child, the girl has been on short drug benders before but this time seems different.

A few hours later he goes to see Ruby. She admonishes him for taking the Siegel case, then tries to give him a handgun, saying it is the exact one Glenn Ford used in a movie. He says Olivia reminds him of Djen, his sister. Sugar takes the gun then goes to a garage and recovers his car, a restored blue C2 convertible Corvette Stingray.

Sugar goes immediately to Olivia 's condo. The condo manager shows her the white Audi in the parking garage confirming the door fob hasn't been used for two weeks. Then the man takes Sugar to the apartment, Sugar demands the door key himself. He enters a large two level suite and looks around. Upstairs he finds an old suitcase with old movie magazines, and Rachel Kaye memorabilia. He riffles through them. Hearing voices he comes out to the living area where two men confront him, one with a handgun raised. Sugar cools them down and explains who he is. One man is David Sugar, Olivia's half-brother, a former child actor. The gunman is his buddy/bodyguard Kenny. Sugar then asks them to leave and he continues his search. He finds a Photo Booth series of pix with Olivia and another woman, he recognizes as Melanie Matthews an old rock star, and the name of a bar written on the back.

He drives to the bar from the pix and parks outside, making some friendly small talk and offering a street person named Carl $200 and a burner cell phone to watch his car. He goes inside and sees the Photo Booth and the blonde woman seated at the bar. After a short time they are drinking expensive whiskey together, Sugar claims his body processes alcohol 50x faster than other people so he doesn't get drunk. Melanie Matthews is wasted and he takes her to his car. He thanks Carl and his dog Wiley for guarding his car, and urges the homeless man to call his family in Milwaukee, Sugar offers to get the man and his dog back home.

Sugar takes Melanie to her home and although she seems to want sex, he puts her to bed. Outside he notices Kenny in a car and tells him to stop following him. Then he goes to Olivia's condo parking garage and checks out her car. With an app on his phone he is able to unlock the doors and trunk. In the trunk he finds a dead man in a body bag, he takes pictures and fingerprint scans onto another app, then closes up the car and leaves.

He returns to his hotel Del Corazon and is greeted by the staff. Sugar locks up the gun and places a number of security cams around his hotel rooms in and out and places some fake personal info on his desk.

In the fairy tale world, Prince Charming rides a horse along a road and into a forest. As it begins to snow, he meets with seven dwarves. They tell him that he's too late and he runs to the sleeping woman that they've placed in a glass casket. He tells them to open it, but the dwarves tell him that she's gone. When the Prince asks for the chance to say goodbye to his love, Snow White, they open the casket and he kisses her. A wave of energy sweeps outward, the snow disappears and the woman awakens. The Prince promises that he'll always find her.

Later, Snow White and the Prince marry in front of the kingdom as everyone applauds. The Evil Queen comes in and casts aside the guards who try to stop her. Snow White grabs Prince Charming's sword, saying that she's no longer the Queen, but Prince Charming says that she's already lost and that he won't let her ruin their marriage. The Queen says that she has a gift for them and that she will make her vows. Soon everything that everyone assembled loves will be taken from them, and her victory will arise from their suffering.

In the ""real"" world, Henry is reading a fairy tale book as he takes the bus to Boston. When he arrives, he hails a cab and pays for it with a credit card.

It's Emma's 28th birthday and she has no family to spend it with. She tells her ""blind date,"" Ryan, that she figures he embezzled money from his employer and abandoned his wife when she bailed him out. He realizes that she's a bail bondsman and makes a run for it, but discovers that she's booted his car. When Emma suggests that Ryan should give what money he has to his family, he asks her what she knows about family. Emma knocks him out and says ""nothing."" She then goes home and lights a cupcake for her birthday. The doorbell rings and Emma finds Henry at her doorstep. She has no idea who he is, but Henry knows her by name. He introduces himself and says that he's her son.

Henry forces his way in and explains that ten years ago, she gave a baby up for adoption and he's that baby. Emma tells him to give her a minute and retreats to the bathroom. When she calms down and comes out, Henry asks her to come home with him. When she threatens to call the police, Henry says that he'll claim that she kidnapped him. Emma says that she can tell when people are lying and starts to make the call, but Henry says that he needs her to come with him to Storybrooke, Maine. Emma reluctantly agrees.

In fairy tale world, a pregnant Snow White contemplates the Queen's threat. Prince Charming tells her that it was only words, but Snow White warns that he has no idea what she's capable of. When Prince Charming asks what he can do to reassure her, Snow White asks to talk to a prisoner who can see the future. The Prince hesitates, but Snow White insists that he can assure that their child will be safe. The Prince reluctantly agrees.

As they drive to Maine, Henry asks to stop for food but Emma refuses, saying they're not a on a road trip. He starts reading from his storybook of fairy tales and insists that they're all true. When Emma says they're not, Henry dares her to tell if he's telling the truth. Emma does but points out that just because someone believes something doesn't make it real. Henry says that is what makes things real, and that she's going to save them all.

The jailer takes Snow White and Prince Charming to see Rumpelstiltskin, warning them not to reveal their names. When they arrive at the cell, Rumplestiltskin knows immediately who they are, even though their hoods are covering their faces. He says that he can reassure them but it will cost them something in return. Prince Charming refuses but Snow White insists and asks what he wants. Rumplestiltskin asks for the name of their child and Snow White agrees, and he tells them that they will all soon be imprisoned when time stops, imprisoned somewhere horrible where everything they love will be ripped from them. When Snow White asks what can stop it, Rumplestiltskin says that her child is their only hope and they should get it to safety. On the child's 28th birthday, it will find them and the final battle will begin. Snow White and Prince Charming walk away and Rumplestiltskin demands the name of the child, saying that it's a girl. Prince Charming says that it's a boy, but Rumplestiltskin says that Snow White knows the truth. She turns and tells Rumplestiltskin that the child's name is Emma.

Emma and Henry arrive at Storybrooke. He refuses to give her an address and Emma pulls over. She notices that the town clock is frozen and Henry explains that the Evil Queen sent everyone there and trapped them, frozen in time. When Emma asks why they don't leave, Henry warns that bad things happen when they try. A man, Archie, comes over, and Henry greets him. He tells Emma that Henry is the mayor's son and gives Emma the address. When Henry claims he was on a field trip, Archie tells him not to lie because it means giving in to the dark side. As Archie leaves, Henry explains that Archie is actually Jiminy Cricket, but he doesn't know it and that none of the townspeople remember who they really are.

Prince Charming meets with the council and insists that they need to fight. Jiminy Cricket warns that fighting means giving into one's dark side. Snow White says that there is nothing they can do because the future is ordained, but Prince Charming says that if Rumplestiltskin says the truth, then their child will be their savior. The Blue Fairy arrives with a squad of soldiers bearing a mystic tree and says that the wood can be used to ward off any curse. She asks Gepetto if he can make a wardrobe to hide someone in. He agrees, but the Blue Fairy warns that the tree can only protect one.

Henry asks Emma not to take him back to the mayor, explaining that his adopted mother is evil and only pretends to love him. The mayor, Regina Millis (the Evil Queen), runs out and embraces him, but he insists that he's found his real mother and runs inside. Sheriff Graham is with her and goes inside to check on Henry, Regina invites Emma in for a glass of apple cider. She explains that she didn't know who Henry's parents were and that the records of the parents were sealed. Emma assures Regina that she has nothing to worry about, and that the father doesn't even know that Henry exists. The mayor explains that she's strict with Henry but she wants him to excel in life. When Emma comments on Henry's claims about fairy tales, Regina says that she has no idea what she's talking about. She invites Emma to leave and the bail bondsman goes out to her car. As she turns back, she sees Henry in his bedroom window, watching her. As Emma drives out of town, she realizes that Henry left his book on the car seat. She looks up and sees a wolf on the road ahead of her. She swerves to avoid it and hits the town marker, knocking Emma unconscious. The book opens to the pages of Geppetto at work.

Geppetto and his son Pinocchio are hard at work carving the enchanted tree into a wardrobe. In their chambers, Snow White insists that she can't leave Prince Charming, but he insists that she has to be safe from the curse. As they embrace, Snow White realizes that the baby is coming. On the battlements, the dwarves stand guard and see a vast evil cloud approaching. They sound the alarm as the curse approaches.

Emma wakes up and finds herself in a cell. Leroy (actually Grumpy) is locked up in the cell next to her, and the handyman, Marco (Geppetto), tells him not to give Emma grief. Marco comments that he doesn't have any children. Sheriff Graham releases Leroy and suggests that Emma was drunk on the mayor's cider. Regina arrives and is surprised to learn that Emma is there, and tells Graham that Henry has run away again. Emma offers to help and they take her to Henry's bedroom. She checks the computer and confirms that he made a credit card payment to a birth-mother tracking site using a credit card belonging to Mary Margaret Blanchard, his teacher. Mary Margaret (actually Snow White) is teaching at the school when Regina and Emma arrive. The teacher insists that she knew nothing about Henry's actions and realizes that he stole her credit card. Angry, Regina realizes that Mary Margaret gave Henry the fairy tale book, and the teacher defends herself, saying that he's a special child. The mayor storms off and Emma talks to Mary Margaret, who says that Henry needed the book so that he could have hope of a happy ending. Emma realizes that the teacher knows where Henry is, and Mary Margaret suggests that she check Henry's castle.

As Snow White is in labor, Prince Charming assures her that the wardrobe is almost finished. Geppetto enters and says that it's finished, but Doc the dwarf warns that they can't move Snow White because it's too close to the baby's delivery.

In the forest, the Evil Queen and her retinue of black knights ride toward the castle.

Snow White gives birth to her daughter and remembers that the wardrobe will only work for one person. The Prince realizes that their plan has failed and hears the invading force attacking the castle. Snow White tells him to take the baby to the wardrobe and hopes that she'll come back for them. She says goodbye to her daughter, Emma, and the Prince takes her. He fights his way past two of the black knights but is wounded in the process. Finally he gets to the wardrobe and places Emma inside. As he seals the door, more knights arrive and kill him. They open the wardrobe doors but discover that the baby is gone. With his dying breath, the Prince sees that his daughter escaped to safety.

Emma tracks Henry to a playground castle structure and returns his book to him. He admits that he hoped that when he brought Emma there, things would change and the final battle would begin. Henry figures that she's pushing him away because she feels guilty, and that he knows Emma gave him away to give him his best chance. Emma insists that she's a real person and no savior, but admits that she wanted him to have his best chance. Henry asks her to stay for one week to prove that he's not crazy, saying that his life sucks with Regina. Emma tells him that his life is nothing compared to hers, and her parents abandoned her on a freeway and her foster family had their own baby and sent her back when she was 3. Henry insists that she went through the wardrobe and appeared on the freeway, and her real parents tried to save her from the curse, but Emma doesn't believe him.

Snow White finds the Prince and pleads with him to come back to her. She kisses him but he doesn't awaken. The Evil Queen enters and says that in a few minutes, Snow White will remember nothing and that it's her personal happy ending. Her knights tell her that the child is gone and Snow White smiles, saying that the Evil Queen will lose and good will always win. The Evil Queen laughs as the roof shatters as a vast vortex sucks everything up, and says that they're going to somewhere absolutely horrible, where the only happy ending will be hers.

Emma brings Henry back to Regina and he runs inside. The mayor thanks her and notes that Henry seems to like Emma. Emma admits that when she blew out the candle on her birthday cupcake, she made a wish that she wouldn't be alone on her birthday. Regina says that Emma shouldn't try to come back into Henry's life, because she's raised the boy and he's her son now. She says that Emma has no legal right to Henry because she insisted on a closed adoption, and tells her to leave town or she'll destroy her. As Regina turns to go, Emma asks if she loves Henry. Regina says that she does and closes the door, and then goes to see Henry in his room. She takes his fairy tale book with her and goes to a mirror, studying it intently.

Mary Margaret is serving at the hospital as a volunteer, and goes to see a male patient, a John Doe. She places flowers at his bed and leaves the man... a man who looks like Prince Charming..

Henry looks out his window toward the town clock.

Emma goes to a bed & breakfast run by Granny. She's complaining to her granddaughter, but is surprised when Emma wants to take a room. Granny eagerly agrees to give her a room. As Emma gives her name for the register, Mr. Gold (actually Rumplestiltskin) comes in and comments on her lovely name. He takes the rent money from Granny and wishes Emma a lovely stay, and then leaves. Granny and her granddaughter explain that Mr. Gold owns the entire town, and then Granny gives Emma her key.

As Henry watches the clock, the hands move for the first time, meaning that Emma Swan has started the battle and time is no longer suspended in Storybrooke."

Regina (Lana Parrilla) goes through her son's storybook and notices there are missing pages near the back. She goes to Henry (Jared Gilmore) and asks where the pages are, but he says it's an old book. They've always been gone. Regina complains he thinks of her as an evil queen rather than his mother. He insists he doesn't. She asks who he does think his mother is. Regina assures him Emma (Jennifer Morrison) is no longer an issue, but then hears the town clock time. She goes to see it and notices Emma's car is still in town. Regina goes to see Emma with a basket of apples, saying they're from the tree she has had since she was a little girl. The mayor suggests Emma should enjoy them on her way home. Emma points out Regina telling her to leave is just encouraging her to stay. She wants to stay and make sure her biological son is okay. Regina says she has things under control. Emma asks what she means. Regina says she has the boy in therapy and warns Emma not to underestimate her.

The Evil Queen teleports back to her castle as Prince Charming tries to kill her by throwing his sword. The Magic Mirror (Giancarlo Esposito) asks what she's done. The Evil Queen explains she casts the Dark Curse, much to the surprise of her servant and the Magic Mirror. She then goes to the Forbidden Fortress to see Maleficent (Kristin Bauer), another evil witch. Two briefly spar verbally. The Evil Queen then demands her curse back. Maleficent say they've already made their exchange. It's hers now. She points out it's hidden in the orb on her staff and contained for good reason, and asks where it came from. The Evil Queen summons her magical forces, summoning a fireball from the fireplace. Maleficent fights back as the Evil Queen animates all of the weapons and throws them at Maleficent's pet, a black unicorn. The mistress protects her pet, but the Evil Queen binds her with the metal from the chandelier and takes the staff. When Maleficent tells her to do her worst, the Evil Queen refuses, saying she's her only friend, and ignores her friend's warning. The Dark Curse will create a void within her she can't fill. The Evil Queen accepts that and leaves.

Later, the Evil Queen meets with the other dark forces of the land and tells them today is the day they will finally emerge triumphant. They ask if they'll be happy and the Evil Queen says they will, but she needs a lock of hair from the darkest souls of the land. At her gesture, the trees around them animate, surrounding them. They each contribute a lock and the Evil Queen causes the limbs to withdraw. She then takes out the final ingredient: the heart of her prized steed from her childhood. She unleashes the Dark Curse and a column of magical smoke swirls up into the air as the others look on, but then disappears. A gnome laughs at the Evil Queen for her failure. She transforms him into a stone statue. Regina is in the garden admiring the apples and a gnome statue when the newspaper editor, Sydney (the Magic Mirror), approaches her. He has already published an article in the town newspaper, the Mirror, about Emma destroying the town's boundary marker, but admits he's learned little of Emma's background. Regina points out he's learned nothing of value and warns him to find something or she'll dispose of him.

Emma is at Granny's Diner getting breakfast when the waitress, Ruby (Meghan Ory), brings her a cup of hot chocolate. Emma assumes Sheriff Graham got it for her and goes over to him, telling him she doesn't want anything from him. Henry looks up from the next booth and says he sent it over. He invites her to walk him to school, and says his plan is to free everyone from the curse. As Emma is about to bite one of Regina's apples, Henry grabs it and throws it away. She asks why the citizens don't remember their past lives. Henry explains they all live in a haze. Emma is the only one who can free everyone. He removed the pages from the storybook to keep Regina from learning Emma is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Henry tells her to read the pages and learn about her past, but to make sure Regina doesn't see them because it would be bad if she learned who Emma is. They arrive at the school. Henry goes inside after saying that he's glad Emma believes him. His teacher, Mary Margaret, sees them talk and comes over to thank Emma for making Henry smile. She explains to Emma that Regina has managed to remain mayor through intimidation. Henry thinks she's Snow White. When Mary Margaret asks who Henry thinks Emma is, Emma lies and she says she's not in the book. Emma goes to see Archie (Raphael Sbarge) and asks why Henry thinks people are storybook characters. Archie explains Henry is using the book to deal with his problems. Emma points out Henry only got the book a month ago and his problems go back further. The psychiatrist admits Henry has had problems with his adoptive mother, and offers Emma the file. Emma wonders why he's violating doctor-patient confidentiality. Archie says Emma is very important to Henry. As she goes, Archie tells her to be careful not to destroy the boy's imagination. Once Emma leaves, Archie calls Regina and says she's right. Emma took the file. When Archie wonders why Emma came there, Regina says she's the one who gave Emma the idea.

Emma is in her room reading the file when Graham comes by and says Archie has filed a complaint. Emma stole the files. Emma shows him the files Graham arrests her. She points out she's being set up. Graham asks who would want to set her up. Regina comes to see Henry at school and tells Mary Margaret it's important.

She complains about the bumpy ride and how they should have taken the Troll Road.

Meanwhile, a thief reaches into the coach, steals a package of jewels, and rides off. Prince Charming goes after the thief, knocks the person off their horse, and discovers that it's a woman.

Clearly pleased that Emma stayed for Henry Mills' sake, Mary Margaret offers to let Emma stay with her, but Emma warns that she's not the roommate type.

The next day, Mary Margaret is volunteering at the hospital and notices Henry sitting with John Doe . He asks what's wrong with the patient and Mary Margaret explains that he's been there as long as she's been volunteering, and no one knows who he is or what family he has. Henry asks if she's sure she doesn't know who he is, and Mary Margaret says that she doesn't. Henry meets with Emma and tells her that she's found her father, Prince James Charming, and that he's the John Doe patient. He shows Emma the storybook and points out that Prince Charming and John Doe have the same scar on the cheek. Henry believes that the curse is keeping John Doe and Mary Margaret apart by keeping him in a coma. Emma doesn't believe it but Henry insists that they have to remind them by having Mary Margaret read the story to the coma patient. Emma agrees but says that she'll ask her. Emma then talks to Mary Margaret and suggests that she play along with Henry's idea so that he'll realize that he's wrong on his own when nothing happens.

She summons Dr. Whale, but he says all the instrument readings are still steady with no changes. He suggests that she might have dozed off and imagined things, and then tells her to go home and get some sleep.

Disgusted, Snow White says that it must be a marriage of convenience because no one marries for true love, and Prince Charming defends it as a necessary merger. When Snow White refuses, Prince James Charming threatens to turn her over to the Evil Queen, who has sentenced her to death for murder and treason. Snow White agrees and Prince Charming releases her.

Emma Swan meets Henry at the diner and Mary Margaret comes in to tell them that John Doe grabbed her hand.

When they get to the hospital, Sheriff Graham is there and informs them that the patient has gone missing. Regina is there, looking into the matter as well, and demands to know why Emma is there. She realizes that Henry lied to her when he said he was going to the arcade.

Regina explains that she's the patient's emergency contact, after found him by the road years ago and brought him to the hospital. Emma offers to help find him, but Regina tells her to stay out of it and walks away with Henry.

Graham begins organizing the search and talks to the two employees, Leroy and Walter. They check the security tapes and Emma realizes it's the wrong tape. When they find the right one, they confirm that, four hours ago, John Doe walked out on his own into the nearby woods.

Snow White leads Prince James Charming through the woods to where she sold the jewels, and he notices her holding a necklace. She tells him not to worry about it but he snatches it away. He realizes that it's filled with dust, and she explains that it contains fairy dust that can transform an adversary into a harmless form. Prince Charming figures that she plans to use it on the Evil Queen and points out that Snow White has a lot of anger. The thief explains that the charges against her are false and that she only lived because the Queen sent the Huntsman to rip out her heart, but he took pity on her and let her go. Snow White tells Prince Charming that she only wants to get enough money to leave for another realm, and she thought the coach belonged to the Queen.

However, the Evil Queen's Black Knight finds her and close in, and Snow White realizes that Prince Charming still has her necklace.

Graham, Emma, and Mary Margaret follow John Doe's trail. While the sheriff goes ahead, Mary Margaret asks Emma how she became a bail bondsman.

Henry sneaks away from his mother and comes to find them, and tells Mary Margaret that John Doe is looking for her.

The lead Black Knight prepares to kill Snow White when Prince Charming arrives and kills him with an arrow. He takes on the second knight while the third one snatches up Snow White and rides away. Prince Charming grabs an arrow and manages to shoot the knight, killing him, and Snow White rides back. She points out that he saved him and Prince James Charming says that it was the honorable thing to do. He reminds her that they need to get is jewels, and Snow White says that the trolls she sold it to are just over the next rise.

Mary Margaret doesn't believe Henry, who insists that she needs to stop and let John Doe catch up to her. Emma tells him to go home, but as Henry argues, Graham calls them over. He's found John Doe's patient tag with blood on it.

Prince Charming and Snow White arrive at the Troll Bridge and proceed on foot. The trolls climb up over the edge to surround them, and Snow White tries to negotiate for the ring. They suspect it's a setup and attack, and the lead troll has his men search Prince Charming. They find Snow White's necklace and toss it to the ground, and then find the poster for Snow White and realize who she is. Prince Charming grabs his sword and drives them back, and Snow White grabs her necklace and runs. However, the trolls grab Prince Charming and prepare to kill him. Snow White returns and uses the fairy dust to transform the trolls into insects, saving the prince but using all of the dust. He thanks her, to which she retorts with his words, that it was the honorable thing to do. They continue on with the jewels.

The group follows the trail to the old toll bridge and finds John Doe lying in the stream. They pull him out and Mary Margaret begs him to come back to them, and to her. She administers CPR and he finally revives. Looking up, he says that she saved her, while an astonished Emma looks on. John Doe admits that he doesn't know who he is, and Mary Margaret tells him that he'll be okay. They take him to the hospital and Dr. Whale works on him. A woman runs in, calling the patient ""David"", and Dr. Whale ushers her back. Regina arrives to confirm that the woman is Kathryn Nolan, the man's wife.

Prince Charming gives Snow White the gold back, and she gives him the ring. He comments that it's not her style and she tries it on. He stares at her for a moment, and then Snow White says that it isn't her style and hands it back. Prince Charming offers her the rest of the jewels, but she says that she has what she needs. He wishes her well, and says that if she needs anything... and Snow White finishes the sentiment: ""he'll always find her"". They say their goodbyes and go their separate ways. Snow White turns and looks back, hesitating for a moment, and then continuing on.

Kathryn comes over to Mary Margaret, Emma, and Henry in the hospital, thanking them for their help. She explains she and her husband were having marital problems, so she told him to leave if he didn't want to be married to her. When he left, she assumed that he left town and didn't know he'd been injured. Now Kathryn has a second chance, to say she's sorry. Dr. Whale tells everyone present that David is physically okay, but he has no memory of his past life. Dr Whale suggests that David's first instinct was to find something familiar, and Henry says he was looking for someone. As Kathryn goes to her husband, Henry goes to get his backpack and whispers to Mary Margaret that David was going to the bridge and really was looking for her, that they belong together. As Regina leaves with Henry, Emma catches up to her and points out that Kathryn's story sounds fake. She points out how convenient it is that Regina just now found Kathryn, and Regina says that after Emma went over the tapes, they checked past tapes and found out that David mentioned Kathryn's name in his sleep from time to time. The mayor tells Emma that true love won out and that thanks to Emma and Mary Margaret, the couple will now be together forever. Regina says that not having someone is the worst curse imaginable and leaves. Mary Margaret watches as Kathryn and David embrace. He looks up at her and seems to recognize her, while Mary Margaret looks at the ring that she's wearing. Later, Mary Margaret is at home when Emma arrives at her doorstep and says she wants to take her up on her offer of a spare room."

Archie is at home when Emma storms in and demands to know what he did to Henry. He insists he made the right decision. Regina calls and asks Emma where Henry is. Henry says he has no idea. Archie realizes Henry went to the mine. At the mine, Henry enters the shaft.

-Rumpelstiltskin is spinning thread when Jiminy comes to see him with his collection of stolen goods. As Rumpelstiltskin gives him the gold thread in return, he asks Jiminy what else he wants. Jiminy admits he wants to be free to be someone else, but something keeps holding him back. Rumpelstiltskin asks if it's something or someone, and Jiminy admits his parents. The imp offers him a potion to put in their food, but points out Jiminy has nothing to pay him with. He tells Jiminy to leave his parents for him as payment for the potion. Jiminy wonders what will become of them. Rumpelstiltskin assures them they'll be in safe hands. After a moment, Jiminy takes the potion and departs.

Archie and Emma go to the mine and find one of Henry's discarded candy bars, and realize he's gone inside.Henry walks through the mine shaft and finds a piece of decorative glass in the wall. As he removes it, the ceiling starts to come down. Outside, Archie enters the mine shaft to rescue the boy and the entrance collapses behind him before Emma can go to help. Inside, Archie lights a match and calls out to Henry, and the boy runs up to him. The psychiatrist insists they need to get out but Henry runs into the tunnels, telling Archie to follow him. After a moment, Archie follows the boy into the mine.


Jiminy's parents force him to go to a home and convince the owners, Stephen and Donna, to let them in as weary travelers. They tell the couple there is plague in the next town and they have an elf potion. They sell it to the desperate couple for everything they have and leave. Jiminy gives them the bottle and goes with his parents, but objects to stealing from them. His parents insist it's okay, but Jiminy has enough and throws the contents of Rumpelstiltskin's bottle at them. However, the Puppet Prince says he switched bottles, and they gave the potion to the couple.


Jiminy runs into the house and finds the couple has been transformed into puppets, holding hands. His parents come in and chuckle at their success, and then the couple's boy, the one from the fair, comes in. He stares at his transformed parents in horror and demands to know what Jiminy did to them.

Archie finds Henry deep within the mine, shining his light down a shaft. The psychiatrist says they have to get out. Henry accuses him of thinking he's insane. Archie warns they're trapped with no way out.


Outside, the townspeople gather to try and remove the debris from the mine shaft. When another quake shifts the area, Regina tells them to stop. Emma says Henry went into the mine because of her. Archie's dog Pongo barks. Inside, Archie and Henry hear it and follow the voice. Meanwhile, Emma tells Regina they have to stop arguing and work together to save Henry. Regina asks her to help. Marco suggests explosives to punch an opening.

Inside, Archie and Henry find an old mine elevator. They start cranking it upward. Meanwhile, the fireman plants the explosives. Emma tells them to detonate. The charges goes off, jarring the elevator loose and causing it to drop several dozen feet downward before stopping. Meanwhile, Emma runs to the entrance but discovers they failed.

At the hospital, Mary Margaret is leaving for the day when Dave approaches her. He explains he's starting his physical therapy and has been told to walk outside with an escort. Dave hints he could use a volunteer. Mary Margaret agrees. Outside, Dave tries to remember the town and explains he woke up in some strange land. He admits he lied about remembering the dog to protect Kathryn's feelings. Mary Margaret says he must feel lonely. Dave says she's the only thing in the world that feels right to him.

Kathryn comes up behind them and offers him cranberry muffins, his favorite. Mary Margaret starts to leave. Dave asks if he'll see her tomorrow. After a moment, Mary Margaret walks away without a word.

Regina snaps at the rescue teams. Emma calms her down. Marco suggests they can drill down if they know where Archie and Henry are. Emma releases Pongo, who goes to a spot on the ground and starts digging. They remove a metal plate to reveal an air shaft.

In the elevator, Henry apologizes to Archie. The psychiatrist says it's okay. He assures the boy he doesn't think he's crazy, but explains Regina has a clear idea of what she wants for Henry and is scared when her son deviates from it. Archie says it's also okay for Henry to be free to think what he wants, and apologizes for what he said. When Henry asks why he said what he did, Archie admits he's not the man he wants to be. The elevator shifts again as it starts to give out.

Marco and the others remove the grille. Regina wonders what to do next.

Henry tells Archie he can be Jiminy Cricket, and the cricket was once a guy who took a long time to figure out the right thing to do. Archie admits it sounds like him. Henry says it's harder due to the curse for Archie to hear the voice inside of him and be who he wants to be.

Emma volunteers to take the line down so it won't hit the sides of the shaft and set off another collapse. When Regina tries to do it herself, Emma warns the mayor isn't physically up to the challenge. After a moment, Regina agrees and asks Emma to bring her son safely back to her.

As they wait, Archie asks Henry again why it's so important to him he's right. Henry explains there must be more than the everyday world, but never found any proof. Archie says he does remember the person he wants to be, and he just needs to listen harder. They hear Emma come down the shaft and drop onto the elevator. Archie hands Henry up to her. The elevator finally gives way, plummeting down the shaft... but Archie catches a hook with his umbrella, saving himself.

The three of them climb both out. Regina immediately embraces Henry and tells Emma to clear away the crowd. The mayor goes to thank Archie. He tells he he's going to treat Henry the way he wants to. Regina warns him things haven't changed. Archie tells her he'll always do his best. If she doesn't let him do what he needs to, he threatens to testify against her in any future custody battle.

-Jiminy stands outside of his parents' wagon, looks up at the stars, and makes a wish. The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) flies up and warns him she can't bring back the boy's parents. However, she says he can help the couple's boy, and asks who he would want to be if he could get away from his parents. Jiminy listens to the crickets and silently makes his wish. The Blue Fairy grants it, transforming him into a cricket. Jiminy says that he's free. She tells him to find the boy, Gepetto.

-Emma watches Archie and Marco talk. Henry says they're old friends. As they talk, Henry points out they can hear the crickets now. Things are changing. At his shop, Mr. Gold walks past the puppets of Donna and Stephen. Mary Margaret returns to the hospital and delivers her letter of resignation. At the mine, Regina drops a piece of glass down the shaft to join the many other pieces she has dropped there, revealing they are the shards of Snow White's glass coffin."

She comments about an old windmill on the front lawn that he disliked very much. Everyone is waiting inside for him (a surprise Welcome Home party). As David works through the crowd of guests, he does not remember anyone except for people he met after he woke up from his coma. Nolan's doctor, Dr. Whale, is also at the party. Henry tells Emma that the reason David (John Doe) does not remember anything is because the curse is not working on him yet. His 'false' memories has not set in yet. Henry tells Emma they have to jog Davids memory so he remembers he is Prince Charming. David comes over and Henry asks him if he ever used a sword, which he laughs about. Alone in the kitchen, Davids wife Kathryn, is upset because she feels like she still does not have her husband back. She confides in Regina about the matter. Regina tells her she shares a similar experience of losing a lover, who is now dead. Regina mentions that Kathryn is lucky that David is still alive, as they will have another chance to reconcile - Regina tells her to go to back to her husband at the party. As Kathryn goes back to the party and looks for David, he has already left.

Meanwhile David walks over to Mary Margarets house and asks her why she did not come back to the hospital (as a volunteer), and if he was the reason she resigned from the hospital. Mary Margaret tells him he is married. David tells her he is choosing her, and not his wife Kathryn.

Back in the fairytale Prince Charming (James) is fighting a brute and he wins, supposedly killing his enemy. His father (King George) and the rest of the court who were watching him all congratulate him. Prince James' father makes a deal with King Midas for gold and other riches, if Prince James can kill the dragon that terrorizes his village. As Prince Charming stands and speaks of plans to slay the dragon, the brute who he thought he had killed, drives a lance through Prince Charming's back and out his chest.

The dead Prince James is taken away as his father says goodbye. The knights tell King George they must move fast to kill the dragon, or else Midas will find another dragon slayer. In turn, the King would lose what Midas promised to him (gold, prosperity) in exchange for slaying the dragon. The King tells the knights he already called for help. Rumpelstiltskin shows up and says ""nice way to treat a gift I gave to you"" (refering to the dead Prince James). It is revealed that Rumpelstiltskin found the child (Prince James) for the King because he and his wife could not have children. The King wants another deal, he tells Rumpelstiltskin he will give him anything if he brings his son back to kill the dragon ailing Midas. In return, Rumpelstiltskin tells the King he wants the magic wand owned by the Fairy God Mother (who often helps out the King), demanding her whereabouts. The King agrees, but Rumpelstiltskin tells the King the dead can not be resurrected and the King is upset because they had an agreement to have Prince James to slay the dragon. Rumpelstiltskin reveals to the King that Prince James has a twin brother, and will have him slay the dragon in place of the dead Prince James.

Back in Storybrooke Mary Margaret is washing the dishes and talking to Emma. She is too focused on what David said about choosing her, and not his wife, Kathryn. Emma tells her to stop cleaning and have a drink. Emma tells Mary Margaret if she thinks doing something is wrong (being with a married man), then it is. She tells Mary Margaret to let David figure out his life.

David is looking through his pictures and Kathryn tells him he looks different, that he always use to have a buzz cut. His wife tries to convince him to go to bed. David asks her if they can sit and talk some more. They share a kiss but David pulls her away and tells her it is not right.

Going back to the fairytale, the slain Prince James' twin brother (the Shepherd) is chasing a goat as his mother returns from the market. His mother tells him she had an interesting talk with the grain merchant. He has a daughter that would make a good match because she has a big dowry and it will save their farm. He insists that true love is the one thing he can not afford to sacrifice, and that when he chooses to marry, it would be for love. Rumpelstiltskin shows up and his mother tells him she gave his twin brother to Rumpelstiltskin (for King George) in order to save the farm. He asks Rumpel what he wants, and he tells him that the King needs someone to slay a dragon. He tells Rumpel he is not a dragon slayer. Rumpel tells him if he succeeds in slaying the dragon, his mother shall never want for another thing in her life, and he will be the conquering hero.

Mary Margaret is at the restaurant and the Doctor shows up and asks if she quit the volunteer position at the hospital because of him (refering to their less-than-spectuacluar date). The Doctor leaves just as Regina shows up to talk to Mary Margaret about David. She tells Mary Margaret that David and her do not belong together. Regina tells Mary Margaret, David left his wife and she should stay away because he is fragile and Mary Margaret is close to destroying many lives.

In the fairytale, King Midas comes up to Prince James (who is now the twin) and tells him if he kills the dragon he will be a legend. Prince James is nervous because he does not know how to fight with a sword, or being a knight - let alone slaying a dragon. The Knights tell him to stay out of the cave as they will take care of killing the dragon. Even though Prince James may not literally slay the dragon himself, as long as Midas sees the head of the slain dragon will be sufficient to save the kingdom.

As Prince James and the Knights walk to the dragons lair high up the mountains, they pass many burning bones and ashes of past dragon slayers who were unsuccessful. Although Prince Charming is supposed to stay out of the caves (need him to be alive), he couldn't stand around having several knights dying and to not help them in slaying the dragon. He runs towards the dragons lair as the dragon flies around and spits fire. James manages to save the Head Knight out of the cave and drags him to safety behind a stone. The dragon spots Prince James and starts going after him. He grabs a sword, runs to entrap the dragon's neck in a narrow cave, and chops its head off with the golden sword.

David shows up at Mary Margarets classroom and she is upset that he left his wife. He tells Mary Margaret his wife Kathryn needs someone to feel for her like he feels for Mary Margaret. David tells her he wants her. He asks Mary Margaret to meet him at the toll bridge, where she found him, at 8 p.m. The scene cuts to the station where the Sheriff brings Emma donuts and asks her to work that night for him. He volunteers at an animal shelter and needs to feed the dogs for the shelter's supervisor who is sick.

Mary Margaret shows up at the station and tells Emma that David left his wife Kathryn. She tells Emma he wants to meet her that night. She asks Emma what to do and Emma tells her to go and meet him because David has made a choice.

The King tells King Midas that his son has slayed the dragon. Midas tells the Prince they respect him because of what he did. Midas tells them he does not think small, as he thinks big and then they bring in a girl who Midas introduces as his daughter, Abigail. He tells them he values her more than gold and he wants to offer her hand in marriage to the Prince. The one who slays the dragon also means he is worthy to marry Midas' daughter and unite kingdoms. Prince James is humbled but begins to decline the offer, his 'father' grabs him aside and tells him he must marry her. If he chooses not to, he will be responsible for the destruction of everyone and everything in their kingdom. The King will also kill him and his mother.

At around 7:45 p.m., David he sets out to find the toll bridge with a map in his hands. On the way, he encounters Regina. She asks him if he is lost and he tells her he is looking for the toll bridge. When Regina asks why he is looking for the bridge, he tells her he is looking for someone. She realizes who he is looking for and says So you made your choice. He tells her he cannot change his feelings. Regina gives him instructions to the toll bridge and wishes him luck.

Meanwhile Mary Margaret is waiting at the toll bridge for David. David is lost Regina actually gave him false directions to the bridge. Regina's directions takes David to Mr. Gold's pawn shop. He goes into Mr. Golds shop and asks him where the toll bridge is. Mr. Gold gives him the correct directions and on David's way out, he sees a windmill and he asks Mr. Gold where he got it. Mr. Gold replies that it has been gathering dust forever. David tells him the windmill used to belong to him, and that he remembers everything. Mr. Gold = Rumpel grins as David makes his way out

Prince James comes back to his mother who is happy he is alive. She is excited about how good he looks and how he looks like a Prince. She tells James the King is taking care of them and has made improvements to their house. He tells his mother that Midas wants to unite the Kingdoms and wants him to marry his daughter. His mother says he was right to refuse the offer, assuming he turned down down Midas' offer, as he did to the grain merchant's daughter. But in order to save the whole kingdom, he must take his place as his dead brother James, and marry Midas' daughter Abigail. He tells her no one can truly know his identity as James. He also tells her given his new identity as Prince James, he never see her again. He came to say goodbye.

His mother gives him her ring from his father she says the ring follows true love wherever it goes - and they embrace and say goodbye.

David finally shows up at the toll bridge and Mary Margaret is waiting wearing the same ring exactly like the one in the fairy tale from James' mom but David tells her he remembers everything. Mary Margaret asks if he loves his wife, and he says he does not know although he knows he did, and he has to honor it. He tells her he has intense feelings for Mary Margaret, but he is going back to his wife because it is the right thing to do. Mary Margaret is hurt and upset, and tells David the right thing to do was to not lead her on. She leaves the bridge hurriedly in disappointment and tears.

Patrolling the streets on the night shift, Emma is driving in the deputy car and she sees a dark figure escaping from the 2nd story window of the Mayor's house. She hits and stops the dark figure walking out the drive way with a baton that is revealed to be Sheriff Graham. Emma questions what type of ""volunteering"" that Graham does, as she finds out that Regina and the Sheriff are sleeping together. The Sheriff tells her he snuck out of the window because Regina does not want Henry to know they are sleeping together.

David rings the doorbell and his wife Kathryn (who is Abigail, Midas daughter) answers the door and he tells her that he remembers everything. He tells her they were not at a good place when he got hurt, he needed time, and he has had time he remembers the windmill (he hated) that triggered his memory in Mr. Golds shop. He tells her they have work to do, it will take time, but he wants to see what happens.

Prince James and Midas daughter Abigail are getting married. Prince James' father King George tells him he is confident he has made the right decision. King George calls James son and James calls him father. Abigail does not look pleased with Prince James, and Prince George (Prince James' father) tells him to smile he is on the route to true love. Prince James and Abigail are in the carriage driving as Snow White is hiding in the trees (bring us to the plot of ""Snow Falls"")."

Graham does as Emma arrives. She deliberately avoids Graham, who throws a dart in front of her to stop her as she goes out the door. He asks why she's been avoiding him, and Emma says that she has no interest in discussing his affair with the mayor. Emma walks away but Graham follows her and says that he needs to make her understand. She wonders why, and Graham says that he doesn't feel anything for Regina. However, he didn't want Emma to look at him the way she is now. When she wonders why he cares, Graham leans forward and kisses her. He gets a brief flash of a forest, a wolf, Mary Margaret, and a vault with a black symbol on the door, and then Emma shoves him back. He says that he needs to feel something, but Emma tells him that whatever he wants, he won't get it with her.

Graham goes to Regina's house. When she answers the door, he confirms that her son is asleep, grabs her, and kisses her. The Evil Queen is at her palace and goes to the mausoleum where Snow is saying goodbye to her father. She offers her condolences and says that she also loved her husband, Snow's father. The Evil Queen promises to be there for Snow forever and hugs her.

Later, the Magic Mirror contacts the Evil Queen and congratulates her on the success of her revenge. The Evil Queen is happy that she has fooled Snow, but warns that the kingdom would turn on her if she took a more blatant revenge against Snow. She tells the Mirror that they must be delicate and carefully conceal any involvement in her murder. The Evil Queen wants someone with no heart to handle the killing, and the Mirror suggests that she use a Huntsman.

In the woods, the Huntsman brings down a deer and then thanks it for its sacrifice. He sheds a tear and then looks up as a wolf appears out of the woods. It steps forward and growls at the Huntsman, and the Huntsman says that it won't go hungry.

Graham wakes up from his dream, and tells Regina that he saw himself hunting a deer and talking with a wolf. He explains that he's seen the wolf before, but Regina says that it's a dream and tells him to go back to bed. Graham insists that it was a memory, not a dream, and goes out to get some air. He leaves despite her protests and goes to get his car at the bar. The wolf walks up to him and looks at him for a moment, and then trots away.

The next day, Emma enters the kitchen and finds a bouquet of flowers on the table. She assumes that they're Graham's and throws them away, but Mary Margaret comes in and says that Dr. Whale sent them after their one-night stand. Emma wonders if it's serious and Mary Margaret admits that she felt guilty about it. When Emma says that it's okay and that she never gets beyond one-nighters, Mary Margaret points out that she always keeps walls up from other people and figures that she has feelings for Graham. Emma denies it, proving Mary Margaret's point, and the teacher says that the wall will not only keep out pain but love. She then takes the flowers out of the garbage and puts them in a vase.

Graham runs into the woods and finds Gold out for what he says is a bit of gardening. When Graham says that he was looking for a wolf, Gold says that there aren't any wolves in Storybrooke. The sheriff explains that he saw the same wolf in his dream and then in the real world, and asks if Gold has seen it. Gold says that he hasn't but notes that some people believe that dreams are memories of another life. When Graham asks what he believes, Gold says that he never rules out anything and wishes Graham luck in finding what he's looking for. The Huntsman goes to a tavern with his wolf companion and the other patrons stare cautiously at the animal. They gossip that the Huntsman is an animal who was raised by animals and cries over his kills. One man comes over and asks him why he cries, and the Huntsman says that an honorable man cries, and that animals are pure of heart, not selfish and self-serving. The wolf growls at the man, who prepares to attack it. The Huntsman kills him and takes on the others, who withdraw after a few seconds. Meanwhile, the Evil Queen watches him through a shard of glass, decides that he's perfect, and tells her men to bring the Huntsman to her. In the woods, Graham continues to chase the wolf and catches a glimpse of it. He finally catches up to it and asks what it wants. It starts to walk away, but when he whistles to it, it turns around and comes to him. Graham pets it and has a flash of himself, killing a woman who looks like Mary Margaret. Graham goes to the school and finds Mary Margaret. He says that he thinks they know each other from another life.

The Huntsman enters the palace and refuses to give his real name to the Evil Queen. He explains that the wolves raised him and that his parents only gave birth to him, and she believes that he is a wolf rather than a sheep. She asks him to kill someone and the Huntsman wonders why he should. The Evil Queen offers him a place at her court as her Royal Huntsman, awash in luxury, and explains that she needs someone without compassion, someone who can carve a heart out and bringing it back to her. The Huntsman says that he can do that and tells the Evil Queen to outlaw the hunting of wolves in return. She promptly agrees and the Huntsman asks her who he is to kill.

Graham asks Mary Margaret if she remembers when they met, and she admits that she has no idea. He doesn't remember either, and explains that he doesn't remember meeting anyone in town. Mary Margaret dismisses it as life, and he asks if he's ever hurt her. Graham asks if she believes in past lives, and Mary Margaret tells him about Henry's theory that they're fairy tale characters. She tells him to go home and get some rest, and Graham hesitantly leaves.

The Huntsman, dressed as a guard in the Queen's army, walks Snow home. She offers him an apple and he refuses, and Snow realizes that he's not one of her father's knights. However, she realizes that he's there to kill him. He freely admits that he is, and Snow knocks him down in his armor and runs off. Emma is at the sheriff's office when Regina arrives. The mayor freely admits that she has a relationship with Graham, and asks what Emma's relationship is with Graham. Emma says that her life is her business, but Regina tells him to stay away from Graham because she's putting thoughts in his head and leading him on a path of self-destruction.Graham goes to see Henry and asks him if he's in his fairy tale book. The Huntsman finally catches up to Snow, who is sitting and writing a letter. He asks why and Snow says that she knows he'll find her no matter what. She asks the Huntsman to give her letter to the Evil Queen and tell her that she means every word. The Huntsman reads it, crying, and then draws his knife and advances on Snow. He uses it to cut a reed, carves it into a whistle, and tells her to use it to summon help. He then tells her to run while looking at a nearby deer.

Henry shows Graham the story of the Huntsman and asks when he started having memory flashes. When Graham says that it happened after he kissed Emma, the boy realizes that Graham is the Huntsman and the wolf is his guide. The memories began because the Huntsman spared Snow, Emma's mother. When Graham wondered what happened to the Huntsman in the story, Henry explains that the Evil Queen ripped his heart out so he would never feel anything again. He shows Graham a picture of the vault where she hid the Huntsman's heart, and Graham realizes what he needs to do.

As Graham leaves the house, he finds Emma waiting for him outside. She wonders what is going on and Graham explains that he needs to find the wolf to lead him to the vault where his heart is hidden. Emma wonders what he's talking about and Graham says that he doesn't feel anything. She offers to prove that he has a heart and touches his chest. Emma assures him that it's beating and then puts his heart to his chest as well. Graham doesn't believe it, insisting that it's the curse. The wolf appears down the street and they both follow it as it runs to a nearby cemetery. It leads them to a vault with the symbol from Graham's dream, and he realizes that his heart is inside. Graham approaches the vault and Emma tries to stop him, but realizes that he won't be deterred. She agrees to go with him and kicks open the vault door.

A knight brings the Huntsman to the Evil Queen. She asks if Snow is dead and the Huntsman says that he has her heart. However, first he shows her Snow's letter. The Evil Queen tells him to read it, and the Huntsman recites how Snow said that she knew her stepmother would never have love because of her. She hopes that with her death, the Evil Queen will rule her subjects well and that her need for revenge will be satisfied. Angry, the evil Queen throws the letter in the fire and asks if the Huntsman is becoming a sheep rather than a wolf. When he asks what Snow did, the Evil Queen says that she shared a secret with Snow but she didn't keep it, and the betrayal cost her dearly. The Huntsman then gives her the pouch with the heart. The Evil Queen places it into a box and closes it, and then prepares to put it in a rack with other boxes. When the rack doesn't open, the Evil Queen realizes that it isn't Snow's heart.Graham and Emma find a coffin and urns, but no sign of his heart. He searches for it without success but Emma says that it's okay. Regina arrives and demands to know what they're doing. She explains that the vault is her father's grave, and Graham says that he brought Emma there. He refuses to tell Regina why he was there and she offers to take him home, but Graham says that she doesn't want to go home with her. Regina realizes that he's willing to go with Emma, but Graham insists that it has nothing to do with Emma. He figures that he can't feel anything because of Regina, and he's rather have nothing than what they have. Regina tries to go to him, but Graham says that it's over. The mayor blames Emma, who says that the problem is with Regina, not her. She points out that both Henry and Graham are miserable and tells Regina to think about why people are running away from her. Regina punches her and Emma fights back. Graham separates them and Emma walks away, saying Regina isn't worth it. Regina turns to Graham, who walks away without a word.

Emma and Graham go back to the sheriff's office and he tends to her wounds. He apologizes for going out of his mind, but she understands and figures that he's heartbroken. Emma figures that Graham became involved with Regina because he was lonely and desperate. Regina goes into the vault and closes the door, and then puts the flowers on Henry's tomb. She then pushes it aside, revealing a secret stairway below. The Evil Queen seals the door and tells the Huntsman that he isn't going anywhere. She then takes his heart in punishment, pulling it out of his chest. The Evil Queen then kisses him and says that he's now her, and puts his heart into the rack. She warns the Huntsman that if he ever disobeys her, she'll squeeze. Demonstrating, the Evil Queen causes the Huntsman to collapse to the ground in agony. As her guards take him away to her bed chamber, the Evil Queen says that he is now hers forever.

Regina goes to the rack of boxes and removes the Huntsman's heart from its case. Graham finishes tending Emma's cuts and notices her smiling at him. She steps forward and kisses him, and Graham remembers everything from his life as the Huntsman. In the vault, Regina holds Graham's heart in her hand. Graham tells Emma that he remembers everything. Crying, he thanks Emma and starts to kiss her... and then collapses, dead, as Regina crushes his heart to dust."

""The Dark One,"" a man on a horse in the distance, subdues a couple of villagers who try to jump to the girl's defense by casting some kind of spell of them. Rumplestiltskin's son Baelfire (Dylan Schmid) worries he'll be taken next.

Back in Storybrooke, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) pays a visit to Mr. Gold after he called the Sheriff's Department. He wants to express his condolences about Sheriff Graham. He tells Emma after two weeks as acting sheriff, she'll have to wear the real badge. Mr. Gold offers Emma a keepsake from Graham's apartment. He insists she take a look through his things before they go to the trash. She accepts a pair of walkie-talkies. Mr. Gold tells her she can play with her boy, Henry (Jared Gilmore), and advises her time with her child is precious. ""That's the thing about children,"" he says. ""Before you know it, you lose them.""

Henry tells Emma they should stop messing with the curse for a while, given what happened to Graham. He says ""good always loses, because good has to play fair -- evil doesn't. She's evil,"" he adds, referring to Regina. ""You don't want to upset her anymore.""

Back at the office, Emma is about to clip on the real sheriff's badge but Regina (Lana Parrilla) stops her. She says she's going to appoint Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) from the newspaper (Fairy Tale Land's magic mirror) as sheriff. Emma tells Regina that Graham freed the sheriff's office from her leash, and she's ""not getting it back."" Regina fires Emma.

Emma is raging to loud music and drinking when Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) gets home. She's upset about losing her job, and says she doesn't know why. She just knows she wants it back. Mr. Gold drops in for a visit. He tells her ""two people with a common goal can accomplish many things; two people with a common enemy can accomplish even more."" He asks if she'd like a benefactor. He then tells her the town charter might mean the mayor is ""not quite as powerful as she seems.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumplestiltskin wakes his son in the middle of the night to hide away so he won't be taken for the war. They're caught by a group of nights. The knight explains to Rumple's son his father also ran from battle and all the other men were killed, ""and he returned home to a wife couldn't bear the sight of him."" The knight explains it's treason to avoid service, and calls for his men to take the boy. Rumple begs for leniency, and the knight forces him to kiss his boot in front of his own son. He does, and is kicked aside before the knights all leave. An old beggar manto whom Rumple had given alms (guest star Brad Dourif) comes along and tells Rumple that he'll find a way to be his benefactor.

Back in Storybrooke, Regina introduces Sidney Glass as the new sheriff. Emma interrupts and explains the town charter requires an election if there is another candidate for sheriff. Emma says she's running. Regina says Sidney is running, as well.

In Fairy Tale Land, the old man tells Rumple he needs to ""choose a different path."" Rumple says the only choice he has ""is which corner to hide in."" He says the only thing he's got is his boy, ""and they're going to take him away from me."" The man tells Rumple he should steal the dagger of ""The Dark One"" and keep him as a slave. Rumple says he'd be too terrified to do that. The man then suggests he simply take the power.

Regina visits Mr. Gold and they go back and forth about his fine-print reading of the charter. She says he's trifling with technicalities. Regina tells Mr. Gold he's backing a ""slow horse"" in this race, but he says she shouldn't underestimate ""someone who's acting for their child."" Regina says Henry is not Emma's child, ""not legally.""

""Now who's trifling with technicalities?"" Mr. Gold asks.

Emma finds Henry at the diner reading a newspaper. The headline -- from the story written by Sidney -- explains Emma gave birth to her son while she was in jail. Emma says those records are supposed to be sealed. Henry reminds her ""good can't beat evil."" When Emma mentions Mr. Gold's help, Henry warns he's even worse than Regina. He warns her not to owe Mr. Gold any more favors.

Emma confronts Regina about the article, saying she's most worried about Henry's well-being. Regina insists she did nothing wrong. As they're walking out of Town Hall, where there are ""wet paint"" signs all around, a door blasts open with a fire raging behind it. Regina can't move. Emma freezes for a moment while looking at the fire.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple tells his son about how he'll use the power of the magic dagger for good if he gets it. His son thinks he should go and fight. Rumple tells him it's not a fight, it's a sacrifice. His son then asks if the knight's story of how Rumple ran from battle was true. He also asks if his mother is really dead, as Rumple has told him, or if she left him -- as the knight suggested. Rumple says she's dead. He then explains the plan to raid the duke's castle. He says it's made of stone, but the floors and rafters are made of wood -- and wood burns.

Back at Town Hall, Emma steps away. Regina incredulously suggests Emma is going to leave her. Instead, Emma grabs a fire extinguisher and puts the flames down just enough to pull Regina and get them both to safety. Outside, Regina says because the firefighters have arrived, they weren't really in danger. Emma starts to say, ""Next time I'll just..."" But stops herself and says next time she'll do the same thing, and again the time after that, ""because that's what decent people do."" She leaves. Sidney comes and takes a picture of Regina, calling her ""the victim,"". Regina tells him he's trying to hand the election to Emma. Emma, meanwhile, is telling Henry they don't have to fight dirty. But she finds a rag and takes it to Mr. Gold's shop. She tells him she's not willing to use such tactics to win her election. He warns her to think of what she'll be giving away and who she might be disappointing.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple and his son set a pile of grass ablaze outside the duke's castle and it sets the whole place on fire. Rumple walks through the flames and grabs the dagger off a wall, where it was hidden behind a curtain.

It's the day of the sheriff's election debate. Mary Margaret sees David (Josh Dallas) while she is putting up fliers for Emma. He's putting posters up for Sidney because his wife is friends with Regina. Mary Margaret leaves.

Emma is nervous before the debate and tells Mary Margaret she isn't going to win. She wants to show good can actually win. She's worried she'll have no part in his life if she's not the hero or savior.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Rumple tells his son to go home and wait for him. His son says he has a bad feeling. Rumple sends him on his way. After his son is gone, Rumple holds up the dagger and summons ""Zoso,"" the real name of The Dark One. Zoso (Brad Dourif) appears and warns Rumple to wield his power wisely, and then he antagonizes him, questioning whether Rumple's son is really his own child at all -- given their differences in attitude toward fighting in the war. Rumple stabs Zoso, whose dark presence fades, and realizes Zoso was the old beggar. The magic powers are now being transferred over to Rumple, with Zoso telling him the magic comes with a price and he wanted to relieve himself of the burden of living with such power. Rumple asks why this is happening. Zoso tells him, ""I know how to recognize a desperate soul."" After Zoso dies, Rumple pulls the dagger from Zoso's chest to see the name Rumplestiltskin is now emblazoned on it.

Back at the debate, which is moderated by Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who tells voters to listen to their consciences, Sidney says he wants to serve as a ""reflection"" of ""honesty, neighborliness and strength -- the best qualities of Storybrooke"". Emma acknowledges her ""troubled past,"" and says everyone has overlooked it ""because of the hero thing."" She then explains the fire was a setup by Mr. Gold. She says the worst part is that she let everyone think it was real and she can't win that way.

At the diner, Henry shows up and gives Emma one of the walkie-talkies for standing up to Mr. Gold. He says heroes stand up and expose people like Mr. Gold. Sidney and Regina show up to tell her she won the election in a close vote. Regina hands her the badge. She tells Emma she didn't pick a great friend in Mr. Gold, ""but he sure makes a superlative enemy. Enjoy that.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the knight is taking Rumple's son and wondering why no one is around. Suddenly, one of his men is stabbed from behind. The knight kneels down to acknowledge ""The Dark One's"" presence, and sees it's Rumple. Rumple's son watches on, frightened and wondering what's happened to his father, while Rumple makes the knight kiss his boot. But before the knight can do this, Rumple grabs the man's head and twists it, breaking his neck, and proceeds to fatally stab the other three men in the knight's group. Rumple's son is terrified and says he doesn't feel safe. Rumple tells his son, ""I'm not. I protected what belongs to me, and I'm not scared of anything.""

Emma sees Graham's jacket on the coatrack in her new office. Mr. Gold sneaks in to say he thought she'd want it after all. Emma warns Mr. Gold she's armed. He says the whole thing was ""political theater,"" and that no one was going to vote for her unless they gave her some extraordinary quality. He says he knew she could win over the voters by showing she'd stand up to him. ""I know how to recognize a desperate soul,"" he tells her.

Emma asks why he did this. Mr. Gold reminds her of the deal they made a deal some time back and that she owes him a favor. He says, ""Now that you're sheriff, I'm sure we'll find some way for you to pay back what you owe me.""

""Congratulations,"" he says as he walks out, without Emma saying anything in response."

She introduces Henry to her brother Nicholas and they set off to hang out together. Before they leave the store, the store owner stops them and finds stolen stuff in Henry's bag. He's disappointed in the young boy, and asks the siblings, ""Who do you think you are?"" They say nothing.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see the fairy-tale version of Eva with her father (guest star Nicholas Lea), who cut down a tree to provide firewood. The father sends the girl and her brother off to collect kindling. Before they leave, he places his compass around his daughter's neck so she won't get lost. Out in the woods, we learn (as if we didn't already know) that the siblings are Hansel & Gretel. When they return to where they left their dad, he's gone. Soon enough, the Evil Queen confronts them and asks what they're doing in her forest.

Back in Storybrooke, the store owner tells Regina that Henry was shoplifting, but she says he doesn't eat candy and ""knows better than to steal."" Regina takes Henry and Emma shows up. She learns that their phone was disconnected because their parents couldn't pay the bill. Emma notices that among they items they were stealing was a tube of toothpaste. Eva asks Emma not to arrest them because it will just make things worse for their parents.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Gretel begs the Queen's forgiveness because they've just lost their father. The Queen tells her guards to seize them. The siblings try to escape, but the Queen wraps them up with vines from the forest floor and tells them that trying to escape from her was foolish ""but brave."" She says their bravery might have saved their lives. She says she's going to find their father because they are gong to do something for her.

In Storybrooke, Emma drives the siblings home and Eva doesn't want Emma to come inside. Eva tells Emma their parents will be embarrassed if she comes in. Emma drops them off and leaves, and Eva and Nicholas then run off to their real house, a boarded-up place. Emma sneaks up on them and asks why they lied to her. She asks where their parents are and Eva responds, ""We don't have any.""

Emma talks to Mary Margaret about the kids, and admits that she hasn't reported the case to Social Services yet. Emma doesn't want to report them because of her own bad experiences in ""the system."" Their mother, Dory Zimmer, died a few years ago. Emma. says their father's whereabouts are unknown. Emma wants to look for their father. Eva begs Emma not to let them be separated.

Emma goes to find Dory Zimmer's death certificate and discovers they've been removed. She next meets with Regina, who says she's already called Social Services. There's a boys' home and a girls' home in Boston that's expecting them that night. Emma is stunned.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Hansel and Gretel are following the Queen to the home of the blind witch. The Queen says she needs them to gets something back from the blind witch. The house its protected by magic, so she can't enter it herself. Children are protected from the spell. The Queen promises she'll find their father if they do this for her. She warns them the witch's house is ""unique."" She tells them that no matter how they're tempted, ""Don't eat anything."" She then moves some tree branches to reveal a magical gingerbread house.

Henry comes to Emma and says the siblings are Hansel & Gretel. He tells Emma that their father must be in Storybrooke, because no one else comes or goes. Henry suddenly asks Emma about his own father. She tells him she was ""pretty young"" and working in a diner off the interstate. She says Henry's dad was training to be a firefighter and came to the diner late a lot of nights. They spent a lot of time together, then his life got better and her life got worse. She went to jail, and when she got out she learned that Henry's father died saving a family from a fire. She tells Henry his father was a real hero. Henry asks if she has any pictures of him, and she says she doesn't. But then she leaves to see if Eva or Nicholas have anything they've hung onto from their father. Emma shows them a blanket made by her mother that she's kept with her throughout the years. Eva says she might have something. She hands over a compass. Eva says their mom kept it, saying it was their father's.

In Fairy Tale Land, Hansel & Gretel enter the blind witch's house, which is made of candy and has tones of sweets inside. The witch (guest star Emma Caulfield) is sleeping and the satchel the Queen wanted them to steal is hanging near her. Gretel goes to get the satchel and Hansel picks up a delicious-looking cupcake. Hansel takes a bite and the witch wakes up. The kids try to escape, but all the doors and windows slam shut. The witch exclaims, ""I smell dinner!""

Emma pays a visit to Mr. Gold and shows him the compass, to see if he knows where it could have come from. It's crystal, he says, and it's an unusual piece. He says it was bought at his store. He checks his records and finds a card and asks ""forgiveness"" in exchange for the information on the buyer. She proposes ""tolerance"" instead, and Mr. Gold says that's a start. He tells her it was bought by a Michael Tillman. Emma leaves, and we see the card Mr. Gold was reading from was blank.

Emma finds Michael and he says it's ""not possible,"" and that Dory was ""a one-time thing."" She tells him about the twins and that they're about to be shipped off to Boston. He doubts they're even his, but Emma shows him the compass. He says he lost it, and Emma guesses it was ""12 years and 9 months ago."" Emma gives Michael a passionate speech about how he'll have to answer to his children someday if he refuses to connect with them. He apologizes and tells her he doesn't know anything about being a dad.

Emma tells Mary Margaret that their father doesn't want the kids. Mary Margaret suggests Emma tell them the truth -- the way Emma did with Henry about his father. Emma admits she didn't tell Henry the truth -- ""Henry's father was no hero, and trust me he doesn't have to know the real story."" Regina walks up and tells Emma she's supposed to be on the interstate headed to Boston with the kids.

Back in the blind witch's house, Hansel & Gretel are trapped and she's preparing to roast them. With some quick thinking, and a bit of luck, Hansel and Gretel turn the tables on the witch, pushing her into the oven and escaping from the house while she screams for someone to let her out.

Hansel & Gretel return to the Evil Queen with the satchel, and Gretel hands it to her. She opens it and pulls out a beautiful, red apple. She explains to Hansel that it's not just an apple, ""it's a weapon -- a weapon for a very particular and devious enemy, one who's still under the illusion that she's safe."" Gretel asks the Queen to keep her promise and find their father. The Queen tells them they deserve more than a father who'll abandon them in the forest. She decides to reward them by having them live with her in the castle. Gretel instead demands that they get their father back. She says they wouldn't want to live with anyone as terrible as her, vowing to find their father with or without the Queen's help. ""We'll see about that,"" the Queen says, sending up a swirl of purple dust around them.

In Storybrooke, Emma packs Eva and Nicholas into her car and prepares to head out for Boston. Henry warns her they can't leave Storybrooke because something bad will happen. Emma says, ""Something bad has already happened,"" and drives off.

Heading out of town, Emma's car engine stalls and she calls for help.

In Fairy Tale Land, The Evil Queen sees in her mirror that Snow White is walking around with a group of dwarves and asks herself, ""When did that happen?"" Hansel & Gretel's father is brought to her. She tells him they're gone and she's told them he abandoned them. She wants to know why her children would have refused having everything they wanted from her, and he tells her it's because they're a family, and ""family always finds one another."" The Queen tells her guards to release him, and says they can all be together -- as soon as they all find one another. Hansel & Gretel wake up in the forest and realize the Queen has let them go.

In Storybrooke, Emma and the twins wait for help, and as a tow truck approaches, Eva sees that her compass is spinning. Michael shows up and sees the kids are in the car. At this point, he knows Emma's car is fine. She tells Michael that she was scared of coming to Storybrooke for Henry, too, and now she says she couldn't go back after having met him and gotten to know him. Michael asks Emma if she's taking them to Boston. She says she doesn't have to, and he tells her not to. Michael goes to the car to see them.

Emma gets home and tells Mary Margaret that the twins' dad showed up and changed his mind. This leads to a particularly insightful conversation in which Emma wonders what it'd be like to discover her parents. Mary Margaret tells her she might find out, but Emma thinks not looking is her best approach. Then Emma suddenly tells Mary Margaret about Henry's theory, that Emma was wrapped up in this blanket and placed in a magical wardrobe and sent to Storybrooke to save her from the destruction of Fairy Tale Land by her parents -- one of which is Mary Margaret. They both laugh and Mary Margaret says she thinks she'd remember having had a child. ""You do kind of have my chin,"" Mary Margaret jokes. As Emma's leaving, she spots Emma's blanket and remarks on how pretty it is. Emma says thanks, and leaves. Mary Margaret holds the blanket close and smells it.

Emma finds Henry and is about to tell him the truth about his father -- then decides to continue the lie, saying she's glad she told him. Suddenly a man drives up on a motorcycle. He asks them if this is Storybrooke and whether they know of a place to stay. Emma suggests an inn up the road and after the man rides off, she reminds Henry that he said strangers don't come to Storybrooke

""They don't,"" he says."

The man takes off just as Regina comes walking out, and she wonders who the man is. He warns that a storm is coming.

Mary Margaret rushes off in the morning, telling Emma that she's late for school. She needs to be there by 7:15 to help the kids with their science fair. But we see that she's instead gone to the diner, where David regularly shows up at 7:15. They have a pleasant little conversation before he walks back out to his car, where his wife is waiting. Emma shows up and asks Mary Margaret if she's stalking David. She kind of is. She knows his whole routine, including that ""Thursdays they get Chinese for dinner."" Mary Margaret says she wishes there was a magic cure for love.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow White meets up with Little Red Riding Hood, who asks about how Snow is dealing with the solitude in the forest. The conversation quickly turns to the fact that Prince James is marrying Midas' daughter in two days. Snow says she can't forget him. She wishes ""there was a way to get him out of my head."" Red gestures something, and Snow presses her about what she knows. Red says ""there are whispers of a man who can achieve even the most unholy of requests -- a man who can do what you ask."" Snow wants to know who it is.

We next see her meeting up with Rumpelstiltskin. He likes her boat and says he's been looking forward to meeting her. She says she needs a cure for a broken heart. He puts together a potion that he says will make her unable to remember who the prince is the next time she sees him. He's plucked a strand of hair from her head and says that's all he wants in return. She asks but gets no straight answer when he asks what he wants with it.

Mary Margaret runs into Kathryn at the store -- literally. They inadvertently bump into each other and their baskets both spill onto the floor. Kathryn finds a massive chocolate bar that Mary Margaret is buying, while Mary Margaret picks up a pregnancy test that Kathryn is buying. Mary Margaret politely wishes Kathryn luck with the test. Regina sees the whole scene and tells Mary Margaret to ""be discreet,"" adding, ""their lives are their business.""

Back in Fairy Tale Lane, Prince James gets a crown from his father, which he says is a gift from King Midas. Prince James says he could feed the kingdom for an entire winter with the crown. The king asks James for some enthusiasm, and says he wants his heart. James claims his heart will belong to Abigail, but the king knows James' heart is ""held by another."" He tells James to forget about it, even though James says this was a role he never wanted to play. When the king leaves, James writes a letter to Snow and sends it off with a messenger dove.

Back in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret finds a dove caught in a net. She takes it to the animal shelter, where David works, and the vet there tells her the dove should be OK, but is a rare breed that forms monogamous relationships and it ""won't be happy here"" even if it heals. Mary Margaret figures she has to get it back near home, but David thinks it's a bad idea with the storm coming. Mary Margaret says no one deserves to be ""lost forever, completely alone,"" so she's going to try to beat the storm and take the bird home. David offers to drive, but Mary Margaret thinks she should go alone.

Regina asks Emma about the stranger in town and wants to know who he's there and why. Emma suggests he might be one of the thousands Regina has cursed. Regina doesn't know what she means, and Emma refers to Henry's ""stories."" Regina tells Emma that the man took a particular interest in Henry, which gets Emma's attention.

Mary Margaret drives through the coming storm with the dove in a cage on the passenger's seat of her truck. We get a quick flash to Fairy Tale Land, where we see the dove deliver a note from Prince James. He asks her to come to him and show him she feels the same so they can be together forever. ""And if you don't, I will have my answer,"" he writes.

Now, we see Mary Margaret get out of her truck with the bird, then quickly cut back to Fairy Tale Land, where Snow pulls a hood over her head to bring in flowers for Prince James from the kingdom of Midas. A coordinator isn't so sure about letting her in, but does -- warning to take the service stairwell ""or the guards will toss you over the wall."" She sneaks all the way to James' room, and even hides as he walks by her, but her delay is costly, as a knight grabs her from behind and takes her to a cell. He reads the note James sent her and says ""the king will decide your fate."" Snow tries to climb a craggy wall to escape, but falls and hits her head on the ground. She comes to and little fellow with big ears in a cell next to her tells her he's tried everything. He explains his name is Grumpy. She says she has to escape because there's someone she loves and she's not going to lose him. He tells her his story of love -- he worked at a diamond mine and traded all his money to a foreman to get a diamond so he could propose, but the diamond had been stolen and he took the blame. ""I'm no thief,"" he says, ""but they think I am."" He says he should've known better but he wasn't thinking clearly all because of love.

""I know a way out,"" says a voice from somewhere else. It's another dwarf named Stealthy,"" who snuck in and knocked out the guards with a sleeping gas that ""Doc"" whipped up. Stealthy opens Grumpy's cell and as they're leaving, Snow wishes Grumpy luck and says, ""I hope you get your love back."" Perhaps against his better judgment, Grumpy takes the key and opens Snow's cell, as well.

Back in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret brings the dove to where its flock is, but lighting strikes the cliff where Mary Margaret is standing. She slips and winds up hanging precariously off the edge of the cliff.

Mary Margaret struggles to climb back up and David appears, pulling her up to safety. ""You really think I'd let you come out here alone?"" he asks her. Mary Margaret races back to the cage to get the dove, but David insists it isn't safe to stick around.

Stealthy, Grumpy and Snow are sneaking around through castle, but Snow thinks they should go one way and Stealthy thinks they should go another. Grumpy follows Stealthy and Snow stays behind. Soon enough, the dwarves are stopped by guards. Stealthy tries to run and is shot with an arrow by a sniper (which must be why we hadn't heard of him before). The king asks Grumpy where the girl is, and when Grumpy claims he doesn't know who they're talking about, the king orders him killed. Before the sword is swung at his neck, though, Snow shows up and threatens to burn down the castle if the king doesn't let Grumpy go. He does, and Grumpy gets away, but the king wants to talk to Snow, who is handcuffed.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret and David find shelter from the storm in the form of an empty cabin. Conveniently enough, there's a fire burning in the fireplace. Mary Margaret admits to David that she still has feelings for him. She says she goes to Granny' at 7:15 every morning to see him, but being around him is too painful because he chose Kathryn over her. He laughs, and admits that the reason he goes to Granny's every morning at 7:15 is to see her. He leans in for a kiss, and Mary Margaret backs away and asks him, ""How can you do this?"" She says she knows that Kathryn thinks she's pregnant.

""What?"" David responds.

Emma shows up to confront the stranger, telling him he's suspicious. He claims he was only in front of Henry's house because that's where his motorcycle broke down. She then asks him about his mystery box, but he tells her she's ""going to have to wait a long time"" before he reveals what's in it. Or, he says, she can let him buy her a drink and he'll tell her right now. She agrees, and he opens the box. It's a typewriter. He says he finds Storybrooke provides ""inspiration."" She asks if he's been there before, and he replies, ""I didn't say that."" He gets up to leave, and Emma asks about that drink.

""I said 'sometime,'"" he says before leaving.

David says he didn't know Kathryn thought she might be pregnant, and says they weren't trying to have a baby. The storm has stopped, though, and Mary Margaret goes back outside to release the dove to join its flock. They watch it fly away, and David tries to hold Mary Margaret's hand. She says they can't, but he tries to convince her otherwise. He says he feels like he has ""two conflicting lives -- memories of feelings for her, and real feelings for you."" She says they're going to have to forget each other, and walks away.

The king tells Snow that ""love is a disease -- and like all diseases, if can be vanquished in one of two ways: a cure or death."" He tells Snow to walk down to James' room, tell him she got his letter, and that she doesn't love him. He says it will break James' heart, and that will cure him. Snow thinks that if she doesn't do this, the king will kill her. But he says he'll kill James instead. He says killing Snow would just make James love her more, and the marriage and kingdom would crumble. But if an assassin killed him, he'd died a martyr and Midas would laud the death and the merger of kingdoms would be complete.

""You would do that to your own son,"" Snow says.

""He's not my son,"" the king replies.

We next see Snow enter James' room, and he's ecstatic to see her. He pulls in for a huge hug. She then tells him that they ""can't happen."" He tells her they can leave all this, and she tearfully tells him she doesn't love him. She tells him to fill his heart with love for someone else, ""someone who can love you the way I never have -- the way I never will.""

Back at his house, David and Kathryn talk. She says she feels like he's ""here, but not here."" She says it's been hard on her, and that she wants a family and children with him. She says she thought she was pregnant, but when the test came back negative she was upset at first, but then relieved. She says she wants to fix their relationship, and he agrees. She asks him to join her in seeing Dr. Hopper to get help. He tells her he knows they should be in love, and he wants to make that work. She notes it's 7:10, and they should leave if he wants to get coffee at the diner before work. He suggests that they instead have breakfast at home.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Snow cries as she walks away from the castle. Grumpy walks alongside her, and six other dwarves are with him. He asks Snow if she found her love, and she says, ""Worse, I lost him."" Grumpy invites her to join them on their trip home. ""We all lost someone today,"" he says. Doc notes, ""Now we're seven.""

Grumpy says they're going to protect her. She says the only thing that needed protecting was her heart, ""and now it's destroyed."" Grumpy tells her it will get better, and she agrees -- pulling the potion out. She says it will erase all her pain. Grumpy tells her not to do it -- he says he doesn't want his pain erased. It makes him who he is. ""It makes me Grumpy,"" he says. He tells her to keep the potion, and if the pain is too much she can always drink it. ""But, for now, put it away,"" he says. She agrees, and they continue walking.

Emma notices it's 7:15 and Mary Margaret hasn't left yet. She holds her hand.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Prince James has ridden out to the forest looking for Snow. Red sees him, and tells him that Snow never came back after she went to find the prince.

""Then I'll find her,"" he says. ""I will always find her.""

Grumpy comes running into the dwarves' house with news that the royal wedding is off -- that her Prince Charming isn't getting married to Abigail.

Snow has a blank look on her face, then asks, ""Who?""

Grumpy notices the empty potion vial on the nightstand.

Back in Storybrooke, it's 7:45 and Mary Margaret gets her coffee at the diner. David walks in, sees Mary Margaret and leaves. But she chases him. He says he's trying not to see her, and she says she's trying not to see him, too. They don't know how to resolve this, but when David tells Mary Margaret that Kathryn isn't pregnant, they kiss -- right in the middle of the street.

Regina, in her car across the street, sees it all."

He's pleased to see it's still there after the storm. Regina finds Henry talking with Emma at the castle, and Regina isn't happy that Emma lets Henry play around the castle, which she says is dangerous. Regina tells Emma not to let her feelings cloud her judgment.

Mary Margaret runs off from lunch with Emma to meet up with David, who's texted her a message saying they need to meet. Sidney shows up, drunk, telling Emma he can help bring Regina down. Emma tells him to go home and sleep it off, but he leaves his card and tells Emma to call him, because ""Storybrooke deserves to know the truth about her.""

We zoom in on Sidney's face and find ourselves seeing Sidney's Fairy Tale Land persona: The Genie of Agrabah -- and he emerges from his bottle to grant three wishes for a king who wants for nothing. The genie wishes to be free, and the king makes that his first wish. For his second wish, the king wishes to give his third and final wish to the genie. The genie says that making a wish always comes with a price and he'll never use the wish. The genie says he'll use his newfound freedom to find true love, and the king invites him to his palace. There, the king introduces the genie to his daughter, Snow, and his wife, Regina. The genie and Regina seem to know each other, but say nothing upon their introduction.

Emma shows up to the castle to find Henry watching it being torn down by a demolition crew. Henry also says his book is gone. Regina tells Emma it was dangerous, so she had to tear it down. She also tells Emma to learn her place in this town, or she'll no longer be in it. Regina leaves, and Emma calls Sidney to tell him she's in and wants everyone to know about who Regina really is.

Mary Margaret meets David on the bridge, and he rushes her off to a picnic he's arranged. They kiss and Mary Margaret says they ""have to stop doing this.""

Emma, meanwhile, meets Sidney in a secluded tunnel. He tells her that $50,000 is missing from the town's budget and Regina is responsible. Emma isn't impressed, but he's certain it will help them get to the bottom of Regina's secrets. He wants her phones tapped, but Emma insists they do this ""by the book."" Sidney warns Emma to be prepared for her wrath. When Emma asks Sidney how he allowed himself to get so wrapped up in Regina's world, he says he ""used to think she was a different person.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the king tells a group gathered at a party that his beautiful daughter Snow is his one lasting reminder of her mother, who, like Snow, ""truly was the fairest in all the land."" The Queen cries and leaves the room. The genie follows her out and talks to her. She says no matter how hard she tries to please the king, she'll never fit the way Snow's mother did. They stand at the Queen's apple tree, which she says is like her -- trapped in the castle and also out of place. The genie commiserates with her and gives her a mirror so that she can see herself as he does: ""As the fairest in all the land.""

Back in Storybrooke, Emma and Sidney scour records and Emma discovers that some records are missing. Mary Margaret shows up. When Emma and Sidney realize they can't get a judge to issue a search warrant because Regina owns them all, Sidney suggests they do the investigation his way. He says ""sometimes doing a bad thing for a good reason is OK."" Mary Margaret chimes in, somewhat anxiously agreeing that if you're doing something wrong, but maybe it's meant to be, maybe it's right, ""does that make you a bad person?"" They agree to go talk to Regina.

They confront Regina about the missing $50,000. She says that the records probably burned in the fire, and insists she has nothing to hide. Emma tells Regina they have nothing, and she and Sidney leave. On their way out, Emma reveals that she planted a bug on Regina's desk.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the king calls the genie and says he thinks his wife's heart ""belongs to another man."" The genie assures him the Queen would never stray, but the king shows the genie her diary, which has a note about the mirror the genie gave her, which gave her hope for love. The king says he realizes the Queen is unhappy and yearns for someone to love her ""like I never can."" But he can't imagine that she would betray him. He asks the genie to learn the identity of the man ""who has stolen"" the Queen's heart. The genie takes the job.

Sidney is checking the tapes of Regina's calls and has something about a meeting Regina is setting up, where she's going to exchange a large amount of cash with an unknown person. That night, they follow Regina out to the woods, but the Sheriff's car's brakes go out and Emma crashes into a highway sign. They get out and Sidney says someone's tampered with the brakes, and thinks Regina's found the bug. Mr. Gold emerges and says Regina was meeting him to purchase his land. He wants to know why they're following Regina around. He warns them that ""emotional entanglements can lead us down very dangerous paths.""

In Fairy Tale Land, the Queen's father meets the genie at the apple tree and asks him to take a box to her, where she's being held by the king's guards. Inside the box, he says, is the only thing that can free the Queen ""from this wretched life.""

Emma now wants to break into Regina's office to find records that link her to the land. She gets the files, and also finds a massive key ring with a bunch of keys. She starts looking for Henry's book when Regina shows up. Emma says some kids broke in so she responded -- because she's the Sheriff. She says Sidney came along because he was walking by and saw, so he's a witness. Emma offers to tear the place apart to find evidence of whether anything was taken, but Regina says her services are no longer wanted.

Back in the king's castle, the Queen gives the genie a huge embrace and says her love for him grows stronger every day. But she says there's no escape. He hands her the box and tells her that her father said what's inside will help her escape. She opens the box to find two Agrabah vipers, snakes so deadly they kill with just one bite. She tells him that with one small bite and she can ""be free from this prison forever."" She tells the genie she's sorry they can't be together, but ""perhaps in another life we will find each other again."" She extends her hand toward the the box, but he grabs it and says there is another way. ""What if the king didn't live?"" he asks. He says that for her he would do anything. She hugs him and says she doesn't know what she would do without him. He tells her she'll never have to find out.

The stranger finds Henry at the diner trying to draw everything he remembers from his book before he forgets it. Henry asks the man what he's doing in Storybrooke. He says he's a writer who's doing ""stuff"" in town. He wishes Henry luck with the stories.

Emma and Sidney find escrow documents showing she's looking to build something huge for personal use, but Emma is upset because they've stooped to her level and none of the evidence will be admissible in court. Sidney says they don't need her to go to jail -- just to expose her to the town for what she really is. Sidney then shows Emma a bunch of pictures he took of Emma and Henry while following them around town on Regina's orders. He says Regina knew about their secret place -- the castle -- weeks ago and was just waiting to destroy it until it would hurt them most.

At a City Council meeting, Sidney stands up with something to say, but Regina tells him to sit down. Emma stands up, as well, and announces that Regina is spending thousands of dollars of the city's money to build herself a fancy second home in the woods. Emma goes on to tell the crowd that Sidney was fired because he stood up to Regina and questioned her. She then turns to Regina and calls her a thug who doesn't care about anyone but herself. Regina says Emma is right. She says she is building a house -- a playhouse. She says she wanted to build a playhouse Henry and all the children of Storybrooke could have a place to play safely. She says the design is based on a sketch she found in one of Henry's books. Emma and Sidney are both embarrassed.

In Fairy Tale Land, the genie stands over the king while he's sleeping. He whispers, ""Forgive me, "" then opens the box to release the snakes in the king's bed. The king wakes up for a moment before the two snakes bite his neck. The genie tells the king, who quickly feels the effects of the poisonous bites, that he is the man who gave the Queen the mirror and that he's forever grateful that the king gave him his freedom. The king grabs the genie's hand and tells him he was right, that he should have never made that wish. The genie looks stunned.

Outside, after the City Council meeting, Mr. Gold tells Emma she's going to need a strong ally if she really wants to bring Regina down. Emma turns down his offer. Regina comes up and asks Emma to go back to her job, which is upholding the law, not breaking it. Regina tells Emma she's not allowed to see Henry anymore unless she says so.

Emma finds Henry playing at the new playhouse. He sees her from afar and they chat over the walkie-talkie, where Emma explains that she messed up and can't see him for a while. She tells Henry she's going to try to find his book, but he says ""it's probably gone and it's probably never coming back.""

We next see the stranger in a house opening the box where Henry kept his book and pulling it out.

Emma and Sidney meet up for a beer at the diner and wonder how they missed everything. Sidney says there are a lot more skeletons in Regina's closet. He says the good news is that she's got herself an ally. Emma vows, they ""won't get fooled again.""

In Fairy Tale Land, the genie comes to the Queen, who sadly tells him the guards found the snakes and know they're from the genie's country. ""They know it was you who killed the king,"" she says. ""It's only a matter of time before they catch you. You will be executed."" She says she's arranged for a boat to provide him safe passage out of the kingdom. The genie realizes the Queen set it all up. Of all the snakes in the world she could have chosen, he knows she chose the Agrabah viper so the murder would be traced back to him. He says she never loved him. She says he's no longer of any use to her, and tells her to flee the kingdom and never come back. She repeated to the genie that she doesn't love him and says ""there is no way we will ever be together."" The genie says there is one way. He pulls out the bottle and uses his last wish -- to be together with the Queen always, to never leave her side. Suddenly, he vanishes in a puff of blue dust and she looks around for him. She hears the genie's muffled screams and pulls out her mirror, where she sees him inside, pounding at the glass from within.

""Well it looks like you got your wish,"" Regina says with a wry smile. ""You will be with me -- forever.""

Back in Storybrooke, Regina meets with Sidney , who reveals a tape of his conversation with Emma. They've been together on this all along. Regina tells Sidney that cutting the brakes on Emma's car was ""inspired."" Sidney assures Regina that everything Emma does, she'll know about it. Regina looks at Sidney closely and says, ""I don't know what I'd do without you."" He looks back in her eyes, but says nothing."

Avonlea has fallen. An aide laments, ""If only he had come."" The angry Maurice declares ""ogres are not men"" and are ""unstoppable."" His daughter tries assure him about this mysterious figure's pending arrival, suggesting, ""He may be on his way."" Suddenly, a knock on the door and we see Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) mocking Maurice about his plea for help. Rumple says he can help protect Sir Maurice's ""little town -- for a price."" Rumple wants something more special than gold, which had been previously offered -- he wants Maurice's daughter. He wants her as a caretaker for his ""rather large estate."" Maurice orders Rumple out, but his daughters volunteers to go despite her fiance and father's objections. Rumple warns her ""it's forever,"". She agrees to go in exchange for knowing her family and friends will all live. Maurice asks the young woman, Belle (Emilie de Ravin), not to go. ""You can't go with this beast,"" he says. But she tells her father and her fiance, Gaston (Sage Brocklebank), it's been decided.

Back in Storybrooke, Mr. Gold seizes the flower delivery van of a man who's behind on his loan payment. The man was Sir Maurice back in Fairy Tale Land. The truck is taken. Regina (Lana Parrilla) sees it all and wants to chat with Mr. Gold. He doesn't want to talk, and leaves.

David (Josh Dallas) and Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) chat over separate tables at the diner. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) arrives and gets the report from Mary Margaret that Henry is fine. Emma is still not allowed to see him. A friend named Ashley (Cinderella in Fairy Tale Land) shows up. She's just had a baby and her boyfriend has been working double shifts at the cannery. The waitress invites the whole group out for a girls' night, but no one seems interested. Emma gets a call from the station.

We next see Mr. Gold entering his large house, where the door was open. Emma shows up, gun drawn, and says a neighbor called and reported Mr. Gold's front door was open. Mr. Gold says he's been robbed. When Emma notes this seems to happen to him a lot, Mr. Gold says he's a difficult man to love.

We quickly cut to Fairy Tale Land, where Rumple is showing Belle to her ""room"" -- a dungeon. He locks her in.

Rumple tells Belle about all the duties she'll perform. She drops a teacup when he says one of the things she'll do is skin the children he hunts. He says this was just a quip, and she sees the teacup she dropped is chipped. He doesn't care, saying, ""It was just a cup.""

In Storybrooke, Mr. Gold wants Emma to leave, but she needs to know more. Mr. Gold tells her the thief was the flower deliverer whose van he's just seized.

In Fairy Tale Land, Belle asks Rumple why he spins so much. He says it helps him ""forget."" When she asks what he's trying to forget, he says he can't remember -- so it must have worked. She's trying to pull the drapes open to let some light in, but he'd nailed them in place. She tugs one and falls from her ladder, and Rumple catches her. She thanks him, and when she offers to put the drapes back up, he says it won't be necessary. He'll get used to it.

Emma tells Mr. Gold she's recovered his things from the flower guy's place. Mr. Gold insists there's something missing. Emma says she'll get it, and Mr. Gold says, ""Not if I find him first.""

Back at Rumple's place, Belle tells him she thinks he wanted here there because he's lonely. She says she noticed small clothing, for a child. She asks if there was a son. He says there was. ""I lost him,"" he says, ""as I did his mother."" She asks if this means he was, in fact, an ordinary man. She wants to get to know him, especially if she's never going to meet anyone again. He says he thinks she's just trying ""to learn the monster's weaknesses."" She tells him he's not a monster. A loud knock on the door turns out to be Gaston, who Rumple turns into a pile of dust and a rose with the snap of a finger. Rumple brings the rose back to Belle, saying the knock was from an old woman selling flowers. He asks what made her choose to come with him. She says ""heroism, sacrifice."" She says she's glad she saved her village. He asks her about Gaston. She says it was an arranged marriage and she never really cared for Gaston. She says she thinks love is layered and she could never give her heart to someone as superficial as Gaston. She asks again about his son. He tells her to go to town and fetch some straw, and when she returns he'll tell his tale. She asks if he trusts her to come back, and he says, no -- he doesn't expect to ever see her again.

Storybrooke's girls' night has Ashley pounding drinks. The waitress checks out guys and urges Ashley to join, saying she's not married to Sean and he's always working.

Mr. Gold sees David at a store buying two Valentine's cards. David claims the two cards are for the same woman, he just couldn't decide which to choose. Mr. Gold says he's fortunate to have someone who loves him, and makes his purchase, which include rope and duct tape.

""Love is like a delicate flame,"" Mr. Gold says, ""and once it's gone, it's gone forever."" We next see Mr. Gold driving a van with the flower guy bound in the back.

Mr. Gold has brought the flower guy to a cabin, and says he doesn't normally let people get away.

Belle is walking through the forest when the Queen's caravan comes by and stops. The Queen decides to walk with Belle for a stretch. She probes a bit and determines Belle is running from a ""master and lover."" Belle admits she ""might"" love her employers, but ""something evil has taken root in him."" The Queen says it sounds like a curse. A kiss borne of true love could break it.

Belle returns to Rumple's place and is giddy, though he tells Belle he's just ""not unhappy"" she's back. She then takes her place to hear the story about Rumple's son. He says he lost his son and there's nothing more to tell, really. Rumple asks why she came back. Belle says she wasn't going to, but then something changed her mind. She kisses him, and he feels odd -- and we see his weird coloring begin to change. Belle tells him to kiss her again, adding, ""any curse can be broken."" Rumple jumps back and asks about who told her that. He thinks the Queen has aimed to turn Belle against him. He's enraged, and shouts at Belle, who asks why he doesn't believe their kiss was one of true love, saying, ""Because no one, no one can ever love me!"" He tosses her back into her dungeon.

Back in the cabin, the flower guy wants to explain but Rumple chokes the man by pressing the end of his cane into the guy's throat. He says he wants to know ""where it is"" and who told him to take it. The man says he needed his van. Mr. Gold beats him with the cane, and the man says ""it wasn't my fault."" Mr Gold continues to beat the man, saying, ""You shut her out. You had her love, and you shut her out. She's gone forever, she's not coming back and it's your fault, not mine.""

We then flash to Rumple smashing things up in his castle.

We flash back to the cabin, where Emma has grabbed Mr. Gold's cane and told him to stop.

Flashing back again to Rumple's destruction of things in his castle, he flings teacups across the room, smashing them into pieces on the wall. But when he sees the chipped teacup, he stops, puts it on the table and walks away.

At girls' night, Ashley tells Mary Margaret she needs a ""be-at-home-with-my-guy night."" Mary Margaret says she understands, being in love with someone you can't be with is ""a terrible burden."" Shawn shows up at the bar, taking a break from work, and asks Ashley to marry him. She says yes, and everyone cheers. After Ashley leaves, Mary Margaret stands outside and David asks, ""How's girls' night?"" He gives her a Valentine's card. She opens it, and it reads, ""Cathryn, I love you."" He apologizes and hands her the other card. Mary Margaret tells him he should go home to Cathryn.

Emma tells Mr. Gold he has a funny definition of justice. Emma asks who Mr. Gold was talking about when he was telling the flower guy he ""hurt her"" and ""what happened to her?"" When Mr. Gold refuses to cooperate, Emma arrests him.

Back in Rumple's castle, he enters her dungeon and tells her to go. He says he doesn't want her anymore. She gets up to leave, but stops and tells him he could have been free if he'd just believed someone would want him. She calls him a coward, but he says he just made a decision his power means more to him than she does. She tells him he's going to regret it, and all he'll have ""is an empty heart and a chipped cup.""

At the station. Emma tells Mr. Gold -- who's locked up -- she still owes him a favor. She offers half of her pastrami sandwich. He says when he does decide to redeem the favor, it'll be for more than a half a sandwich. Regina shows up and tells Emma she can have 30 minutes with Henry, which would mean leaving Regina alone with Mr. Gold. Emma takes it and leaves.

Mr. Gold says when two people both want something the other has, a deal can always be struck. He asks Regina (Lana Parrilla) if she has what he wants. She says yes. Mr. Gold looks shaken. When he asks Regina what she wants, she asks him his real name. He claims his name is Mr. Gold. She says if he wants what she has, he'll tell her his real name. He manages to choke out the word: Rumplestiltskin.

Pleased with herself, Regina pulls the chipped teacup from her purse and mocks Mr. Gold for it as she hands it to him, referring to the cup as a ""sentimental keepsake.""

""Thank you, your majesty,"" he says.

Mr. Gold warns Regina he really has the power in Storybrooke, and nothing between them will change.

""We shall see,"" she says.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the Queen shows up at Rumple's place and says she has a request concerning a mermaid. Rumple doesn't want to talk about it, and the Queen asks if he's angry with her. He says her little deception failed, and she'll never be more powerful than him. He tells her she can keep trying, but she's never going to beat him. She asks if it's ""about that little girl I met on the road."" When he says her name was Belle, the Queen tells Rumple she had ""nothing to do with that tragedy.""

He asks, ""What tragedy?""

The Queen explains after Belle returned home, her fiance was gone, her father shut her out, locked her in a tower. She says Belle threw herself off the tower and died. Rumple thinks the Queen is lying, and asks her to leave. The Queen notes on her way out the place is getting dusty and he should ""get a new girl.""

Rumple goes to a cabinet, pulls out the chipped cup and puts it on a pedestal, crying.

Back in Storybrooke, Regina goes into a special-access area of the hospital and heads downstairs. She hands a nurse a rose and asks, ""Has anyone been in to see her?""

The nurse tells Regina, ""Not today -- not ever.""

Regina goes down a creepy hallway, opens a small slot in a door and looks inside, where we see the Storybrooke version of Belle, locked up and stunned to see Regina's face looking through the slot in the door."

The knights race off, but the king brushes it off to Abigail and tells a knight, ""Find him."" We next see Prince Charming evading the knights who are chasing him. But he's soon captured by two men in purple cloaks.

In Storybrooke, Kathryn tells David she applied to law school and was accepted. It's in Boston. She thinks a fresh start is what they need, focusing on making new memories rather than chasing old ones.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see that the prince's captors were working for Abigail, who confronts him and tells him she knows he's in love with Snow White. She says she's come to help him escape -- because she doesn't want to marry him, either.

In Storybrooke, David goes for a walk with Mary Margaret, who thinks they have to tell Kathryn the truth about them, and everything. David isn't sure he can. Mary Margaret thinks being honest with others is the only way they can be honest with each other. She tells him, ""The only way no one gets hurt here is if we don't want to be together."" He says he doesn't want that, and she insists he make a choice and tells Kathryn.

""I choose you,"" David tells Mary Margaret. She tells him to tell Kathryn, and walks away.

Emma runs into the motorcycle guy at the diner, who asks about their date. Emma wants to know his name. He tells her it's August W. Booth, he says, clarifying that the W is for Wayne. He invites her to meet him there after work. She goes inside to meet Mary Margaret, who's curious. They get back to talking about Mary Margaret, who admits she hasn't been staying away from David. Emma has known, but didn't say so. Mary Margaret tells Emma that David is telling Kathryn everything.

We next see Kathryn and David, and he tells her he can't go to Boston with her. She asks for the truth, and whether there's something going on she doesn't know about. He says no. He says he doesn't know what it is, but there's something that's preventing him from connecting. He says she's right about needing a fresh start, but not with him.

In Fairy Tale Land, Abigail and her caravan escort the prince to her father's kingdom. Before he leaves, he wants to know what's really going on. She says her heart also belongs to another -- a man named Frederick, who she was once intended to wed. The prince says he can't help her, because his love told him she doesn't feel the same way for him as he does for her. He calls this his tragedy, but she says it isn't a tragedy. She walks him over to what appears to be a statue of Frederick. It isn't a statue, though. It's Frederick, who was turned to gold when he jumped to push King Midas to safety during a battle. In hopes of bringing Frederick back to life, she'd have to reverse the curse, and she tells the prince about Lake Nostos whose waters are said to have magical properties that can return to you something that's been lost. The prince vows to get to the lake and its water, despite the guards who surround it.

We next see August making a copy of Henry's book.

Regina gives Henry a gift -- a video game joystick. She asks him again not to be upset with him for tearing down the playground and losing his book. Henry says he wants to see Emma. Regina doesn't say anything as Kathryn shows up and interrupts them. Kathryn's crying and tells Regina about David leaving her. Regina immediately calls out Mary Margaret for being a homewrecker, and Regina breaks the news to Kathryn that Mary Margaret and David have been having an affair. Kathryn asks for proof and Regina shows her pictures Sidney had taken. Regina says she didn't say anything because she wanted Kathryn and David to work it out. Regina says she wanted that because she's Kathryn's friend, but Kathryn says a friend wouldn't lie.

In Fairy Tale Land, the prince reaches a shrine where anyone who attempts to get to the lake is meant to leave an offering. He tosses his helmet toward and heads for the lake, leaving Abigail behind.

In Storybrooke, David tells Mary Margaret that he told Kathryn, and she tells him he did the right thing. Kathryn shows up at Mary Margaret's school and slaps her in the middle of a hallway. Kathryn yells at her in the hallway while others watch. Mary Margaret is stunned to realize that David didn't actually tell Kathryn about their romance.

In Fairy Tale Land, the prince easily reaches the lake and dips a canteen in for water. Soon, he hears a rumbling and draws his sword, calling out to whomever is headed toward him to show themselves. Soon, a beautiful siren emerges from the lake and catches the prince's glance.

August gets to the diner and asks Emma to hop onto the back of his motorcycle. He drives her out to a ""watering hole."" It's a well. He says there's a legend about the well -- that its water is fed by a lake that has magical properties. The water from the well is said to return something lost to you. They toast and drink the water.

Mary Margaret feels everyone gossiping and whispering about her as she walks down the street. An older woman tells her she should be ashamed of herself.

In Fairy Tale Land, the siren approaches the prince and tells him she can be anyone he wants. He says he won't fall prey to her deceptions, but she raises a handful of water over herself and lets it pour over her -- turning her into Snow White. The prince tries to resist, but gives in and kisses the figure. His sword drops into the lake. The siren tries to lure him into the water, but he says he doesn't want an illusion, he wants the real thing. The siren pushes him into the water and a vine pulls him downward, trapping him under. The prince spots a knife at the bottom of the lake and when the siren returns underwater and plants another kiss on him, he stabs her in the stomach with the knife, then cuts the vine away to swim to the surface.

In Storybrooke, David is trying to clean off the word ""tramp,"" which has been spray painted onto Mary Margaret's car. She finds him, and confronts David about why he didn't tell Kathryn about them. He says he didn't want anyone to get hurt, but she says he not only lied to Kathryn, but he also lied to her. He tells Mary Margaret they have to pick up the pieces and move on if what they have is true love, but she disagrees. She says what they have is destructive and it has to stop. She says they shouldn't be together.

Emma gets to her car and clears off some leaves. In the gutter, she finds a metal case that has Henry's book inside. August watches this from across the street.

Kathryn pays Regina a visit to apologize for her reaction. Kathryn tells Regina that David has never looked at him the way he's looking at Mary Margaret in the pictures. Kathryn says she's coming to understand she's never been in love. She says her marriage to David was ""just like an illusion."" She says she's going to go out there and find love. She's moving to Boston alone. Kathryn tells Regina that she told David that he and Mary Margaret should be together. Regina seems troubled by this development. Kathryn confesses she's ""always had this irrational fear of leaving Storybrooke."" Regina tells her she just might find what she's looking for -- but she says it in that creepy Evil Queen kind of way that makes you know she doesn't mean it.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming returns with water from the lake and gives it to Abigail, who pours the water over the golden Frederick. He comes back to life. Abigail and Frederick kiss. (Frederick is the same guy Kathryn bumped in the school hallway when she went to yell at Mary Margaret). Prince Charming heads out to find Snow White again. Abigail warns him to make haste, because King George will send his men after him. She adds, ""Some people will stop at nothing to destroy the happiness of others.""

We next see Regina sneaking into Kathryn and David's house, and stealing the envelope Kathryn had left for David.

Emma finds Henry playing his video game. She hands him the book. He's surprised, but thinks it's a sign that their luck is changing. She smiles and tells him she hopes he's right.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming is still looking for Snow White, who runs into Little Red Riding Hood. She tells him that Snow went to break up his wedding because she loves him, and that something must have changed her mind. He thinks it wasn't ""something"" but ""someone."" He looks up and sees King George and his knights heading toward them, with the king yelling for the prince's head. He sweeps Red up behind him and gallops off with her.

In Storybrooke, while Kathryn is on her way out of town, we see Regina burning the envelope Kathryn had left for David. Kathryn, meanwhile, is driving down the dark road and we next see the Storybrooke version of Frederick driving upon the scene of Kathryn's car, which has gone off the road just short of the Storybrooke town limit. He walks up to the car and sees the airbag has deployed but there is no one around. Back at Regina's place, the envelope has burned and we zoom in on her mean, evil, smug face."

One warns a newbie, Nova (Amy Acker), about the value of fairy dust, and challenges her to get home safely without losing any. Sure enough, as they take off, a bit of fairy dust shakes loose and lands on a giant egg being tended to by some dwarves. Out of the egg comes another dwarf.

We next see the Storybrooke version of this dwarf, a grumpy fellow named Leroy. He's met by another little person (this one sneezes a lot), who'd like to sit near him at the diner. Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), meanwhile, announces the town's nuns are selling candles for Miners Day. She's looking for volunteers to help sell them and no one steps up. On his way out, Leroy tells Mary Margaret he won't help because he's the only person the town hates more than her. ""Town harlot, town drunk,"" he says, referring to the two of them.

Later, Mary Margaret explains Miners Day to Emma (Jennifer Morrison). The nuns used to make candles and trade them with the miners for coal, and the tradition continues as a fundraiser. Mary Margaret is getting shunned by everyone because of her status as a ""home wrecker."" Emma gets a call and has to leave, telling Mary Margaret to ""hang in there,"" and offering to help.

Volunteers are decorating for Miners Day when some glitter falls on Leroy, who's just passing through. He looks up and we see it's the Storybrooke version of the fairy from earlier. She's fumbling with the lights and Leroy, suddenly smiling, offers to help. She tells him her name is Astrid. Leroy fixes the lights and she thanks him. He tells her he's in the custodial services, despite the fact that he wanted to be a sailor. He wants to sail around the world. Astrid tells him someone once told her, ""You can do anything as long as you can dream it."" He starts to believe her. She leaves and they're both smiling.

Emma is looking at Kathryn's car, which crashed near the Storybrooke town line. Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) shows up to take some photos as a freelancer, having been fired from the Mirror. Emma finds Kathryn's packed suitcase is still in the trunk of the car. Sidney says he can get Kathryn's phone records to help with the investigation. David (Josh Dallas) pulls up. Emma says she's about to find out how much he knows.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, the newly hatched dwarf is being cleaned and asks about the woman he saw just before he hatched, and the dwarf cleaning him up tells him there are no female dwarves. The new dwarf gets the lowdown on the situation: Dwarves are hatched from eggs and they work (they love working -- ""We even whistle while we do it,"" the veteran dwarf tells him). They mine the diamonds that get crushed into dust that give light to the world. He's told that he and his seven brethren will work together. They grab axes which give them their dwarf names. Sure enough, they get their axes: Stealthy, Happy, Doc, Sneezy, Sleepy, Bashful, Dopey and finally, our new dwarf, who we know is ""Grumpy,"" gets an axe that names him Dreamy. ""The axe never lies,"" the veteran tells him.

In Storybrooke, Leroy goes to Mary Margaret to volunteer and sees Sister Astrid being scolded for having ordered 12 dozen helium tanks instead of the 12 they needed. The nun who is scolding her is the same fairy who was giving her orders earlier in the clouds. She explains to Leroy they'll need to sell ""like, a thousand"" candles in order to make up the difference and pay their rent to Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Last year they sold 42. He'll evict them if they don't pay. Leroy says they only sold 42 candles last year because they didn't have him. ""This year, you're going to sell all of them,"" Leroy says. Astrid calls him her hero. Mary Margaret is surprised by all of this.

David tells Emma he doesn't know anything about Kathryn's disappearance, and they haven't spoken since he ended things with her. He says Kathryn told him she was going to Boston. Emma vows to find her.

We see Kathryn's phone records being pulled -- by Regina (Lana Parrilla). She calls Sidney to let him know she has them, ""and I think you'll find them quite helpful.""

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Dreamy shoveling for diamonds and the conveyor belt that grinds it up into fairy dust. Nova, the clumsy fairy, has trouble shutting off the valve of fairy dust. Dreamy comes over to help. He recognizes her, but she doesn't know who he is. Distracted by their conversation, she loses her bag of fairy dust and watches helplessly as it is nearly moved into an incinerator. Dreamy chases it down and saves it. She tells him she just wants to be a fairy godmother, but she's too clumsy. He tells her he believes you can do anything you want, ""as long as you can dream it."" She introduces herself as Nova, and he's Dreamy. She tells him about her plans to see the fireflies that night. He tells her it sounds fun, and hopes she'll have a good time. She thanks him again and calls him her hero.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret struggles to get anyone to buy her candles. Leroy suggests they go sell them door to door, saying they're so despised the customers will pay them just to leave.

Emma finds Sidney playing a game at the carnival. She tells Sidney that Kathryn never showed up in Boston. Emma asks him for the phone records.

Mary Margaret and Leroy get many doors slammed in their faces.

In Fairy Tale Land, the dwarves are having a great time, but Dreamy isn't feeling like himself. Belle (Emilie de Ravin) overhears him telling another dwarf about his woes and she says he's in love. She says love is the most amazing feeling in the world, and if he's in it he needs to enjoy it ""because love doesn't last forever."" He wonders why he feels so bad. Belle explains to Dreamy that Nova wasn't just telling him about fireflies, but suggesting he go see them with her. She encourages him to go find his love, his hope, his dreams.

In Storybrooke, Leroy comes to tell Sister Astrid some bad news. Mary Margaret expects him to tell her they didn't sell any candles, but instead he tells Astrid they were all sold. She gives him a huge hug.

Mary Margaret is livid. He's committed to $5,000 worth of candles and there's no way they can come up with that. Mary Margaret asks why this is so important to him. He says he doesn't want the nuns to leave town. Mary Margaret realizes he likes Astrid and wonders if he could possibly have fallen for someone less available than a nun. He says he's going to get the $5,000.

In Fairy Tale Land, Dreamy gets to the hill just in time to catch Nova. She tells him flying over the world and being a part of it aren't really the same thing. He suggests they could see the world together in a boat and sail. The fireflies come out, and Astrid kisses him and says they should meet the next night and run off together.

In Storybrooke, we see Leroy offering his boat to Mr. Gold for $5,000. Leroy finally tells him he'd like him to forgive a month's rent for the nuns, but Mr. Gold won't budge. He says he'll be within his rights to evict, and he'll be glad to be rid of ""such distasteful tenants."" Mr. Gold says he has his reasons for not liking the nuns, noting he has a long and complicated history with them.

Astrid shows up at the boat and gives Leroy a pie to thank him for his help. She sees the stash of unsold candles and wonders why they're there. Leroy confesses he didn't sell them all. He was afraid of letting her down with the truth. He apologizes for lying, and says she ""believed in the wrong guy."" She leaves.

Sidney brings Kathryn's phone records to Emma. They include an 8-minute call she made to David just an hour before the accident. Emma says that can't be right because David said he hadn't talked to Kathryn that day. Sidney tells Emma not to beat herself up over being fooled by David because she's not the only one he's fooled.

Leroy shows up at the diner to tells Mary Margaret he didn't get the money from Mr. Gold. Mary Margaret tells him he was right -- she was ""just dreaming"" to think the town drunk and the town harlot could do anything.

In Fairy Tale Land, Dreamy tries to make a quiet exit to meet with Nova, but the rest of the dwarves wake up and ask why he's leaving. He tells her he's meeting Nova and he's in love. Happy offers him a pick axe, but Dreamy doesn't take it. The dwarves hug him and seem to wish him well.

On his way out, he's stopped by the dwarf boss who tells him he can't leave. He says Dwarves aren't capable of love. Then, the other fairy shows up to reiterate to Dreamy what he's feeling is not love, ""it's just a dream."" She introduces herself as Nova's teacher. She says Nova will lose her wings if she and Dreamy run away together. She tells him to return to the mines and the dust he makes and Nova spreading it will bring ""untold joy to the world."" She tells him Nova will be a great fairy ""if you let her -- the choice is yours.""

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret tells Leroy he can never have a relationship with Sister Astrid. He brushes this off, saying Astrid was the first person who told him he could do anything, and he didn't want to disappoint her. Mary Margaret tells him there are consequences to following through when the world doesn't want you to. He asks her about her good memories with David and whether she regrets them. She no no, and Leroy says life is all about holding on to good memories. He says all he wanted was a moment with Astrid to give him hope ""that any dream's possible."" He tells Mary Margaret she's had that, ""so stop feeling sorry for yourself and enjoy it -- because I am."" Mary Margaret says if she had the dream it wasn't worth it. He tells her sitting there drinking won't end her pain, and he can't only think of one thing that will.

We next see Leroy on a roof above the Miners Day carnival. He isn't going to jump, he's going get his moment. He knocks out the transformer, cutting all the power to the whole town. Mary Margaret asks what he's doing, and he says, ""I'm selling candles, sister.""

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Nova waiting for Dreamy and he arrives. She hands him a telescope and he sees a boat waiting for them. She says it has everything they need to explore the world, but Dreamy sadly tells her he can't go with her. He tells her he's a dwarf and he belongs in the mines, and she belongs with the other fairies. She tells him he's special, but he questions what makes them different from any other dwarf and fairy. She says their love makes them different. She knows he talked to the blue fairy. He says it doesn't matter what the blue fairy said. She tells him she loves him, and asks, ""Don't you love me?""

""I'm a dwarf,"" he says. ""I can't love.""

Dreamy goes back to the mines and asks where his axe is. He gets it and it doesn't work. He slams it until it breaks. He asks the boss to hand him another axe. He gets it and the name reads ""Grumpy."" He gets back to work.

In Storybrooke, Leroy and Mary Margaret have sold out of candles and Leroy is ecstatic. Leroy looks over and sees Astrid, and Mary Margaret tells him to go deliver the news and get his moment.

Leroy brings her the cash box with $5,000. She says she doesn't know what to say, and he says, ""You're welcome."" He tells her he's going to fix up his boat and she can be his first passenger. She says she'd love that.

Emma is looking at Kathryn's phone records with the 8-minute call with David highlighted. Regina shows up and asks for an update on Kathryn's case. Emma says she's found something but she isn't yet sure what it means, and at this point in the investigation she doesn't want to reveal what she's found. Regina tells Emma if she's covering for someone and not doing her job, she'll find someone who will.

Mary Margaret smiles as she puts up a ""sold out"" sign on the candle stand. She gets back to her car and sees the word ""Tramp"" scrawled on the windows. She walks away and a kind older lady relights Mary Margaret's candle with her own.

Emma finds David at the carnival and tells him he needs to come to the Sheriff's station and tell him everything.

""I thought I already did,"" he says.

""So did I,"" she says, and she puts him in the back of the Sheriff's car while some of the carnival attendees watch."

He can't explain the phone call that shows up on his records. Emma still doesn't think he's lying, but points out he's not in a great spot. She lets him go, but suggests he get a lawyer.

At Granny's, Ruby flirts with August (Eion Bailey), asking him about his travels. Granny (Beverley Elliott) calls for her, but Ruby blows her off. ""Ruby, stop flirting and get over here,"" Granny commands.

In fairyland, Ruby/Red opens the shutters to her cottage for a young suitor named Peter. He wants her to run away with him, but she's afraid to cross Granny.

Red says good-bye to her suitor and answers Granny's calls. There's a hunting party at the front door preparing to set off after the wolf that's been killing sheep. Red is going stir crazy. Granny won't let her go out with the wolf on the prowl. And she has to keep her hood on -- Granny says red repels wolves.

Granny and Red barricade up the cottage. Red heads to bed as Granny mans the front door with a crossbow.

Back in the diner, Ruby is mad at Granny for embarrassing her. Granny wants her to work Saturdays and she wants to train her how to do the books. Ruby objects. Granny tells her she dresses like a drag queen during fleet week. ""And you dress like Norman Bates when he dresses like Norman Bates' mother,"" Ruby shoots back.

Granny tells her it's time she grows up, and reminds her as long as she works there she has to listen to her rules. They start arguing. Ruby quits and walks out.

Back in Fairyland, in the morning they open up the cottage and Ruby gathers eggs from the chickens in the coop. She hears something hiding. It's Snow White.

They head to the well. Ruby tells her about the killer wolf. They see its handiwork: the hunting party has been slaughtered.

Back in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret asks Emma about David. Emma prepares MM for the fact people are going to look suspiciously at her and David about Katherine's disappearance.

They come upon Dr. Whale (David Anders) hitting on Ruby, who has her bags packed and is waiting at the bus stop. He scampers off. Ruby tells them about her fight with Granny and she's leaving, but she's not sure for where. MM invites her home with them.

In Fairyland, at a town meeting, the leader of the hunting party regrets he couldn't save his men. Red and Snow, with her face hidden, are at the meeting. So is Peter. Granny tells a story about when she was a young girl and her six older brothers and father went out to kill the wolf. She climbed up on the roof and watched as the wolf slaughtered them all. She fell off the roof and the wolf came over, chomped on her arm and then left her alone.

She shows off the gnarly scar. She warns everyone the wolf cannot be beaten. She urges everyone to hide.

Back at the cottage, Ruby tells Snow about her crush on Peter. Snow thinks Granny is using the threat of the wolf to keep Red from love. Red thinks about it for a minute and then announces they should go kill the wolf.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret drives to the edge of town and gets out to look around where Katherine disappeared. She hears something and follows the noise and runs in to David. She assures him Emma knows he had nothing to do with Katherine disappearing. David is in a daze and just keeps saying he's looking. He stumbles off.

Red and Snow trek through the woods, tracking. They find wolf prints.

In Storybrooke, Henry helps Ruby look through help wanted ads at the sheriff's station. Ruby notices the phone keeps ringing. Henry explains it goes to a machine when Emma is busy. Ruby answers it and takes a message, then she handles a call about a prowler, explaining it's a neighbor's dog.

Emma sees her on the phones and offers her a job. Ruby goes out on a lunch run.

Mary Margaret comes and tells Emma about running into David in the woods. ""It's like he was a different person,"" she says.

In Fairyland, Snow and Red keep following the tracks and find the paw prints turn into boots, like he was a wolf that turned into a man.

Red knows ""wolf's time"" is once a month on the full moon. They keep following the tracks and realize they're at Red's cottage. The prints go to her window -- where Peter was.

Red knows Peter didn't join the hunting party last night, but she worries about what will happen tonight.

Snow tells Red to tell him.

Ruby goes in to Granny's and orders lunch, bragging that she's working at the sheriff's station now and helping solve crimes.

Back in Fairyland, Red tells Peter she thinks he's the wolf. He doesn't understand how he could not remember. He suggests she chain him up, just in case.

At the sheriff's station, Henry suggests Emma let Ruby do more because she doesn't remember she's Little Red Riding Hood and has forgotten she's a bada--.

Emma tells Ruby to come with her. They head into the woods looking for David. All of a sudden, Ruby says she hears him and realizes where David is. She finds him passed out on the ground with bump on his head. He doesn't remember anything since he was in Emma's office last night.

Emma takes him to see Dr. Whale, who says it seems like what happened to him when he came out of his coma. Emma wonders what else he could do in that state and not remember. David suddenly worries he could have done something to Katherine. Regina storms in -- she's still David's emergency contact since Katherine is missing. She snarks at Emma to just find Katherine.

Emma calls Ruby and asks her to drive to the toll bridge -- where David went last time during a black out. Emma wants her there before David is released from the hospital.

Ruby drives to the bridge and finds some recently dug up ground. She digs and finds a small wooden box. She opens it and screams.

Back in the cottage, Snow lies in bed, taking Red's place. Granny finds her. Snow explains Red's out with Peter and isn't in danger because he's tied up. ""She's got him tied up? Oh that poor boy,"" Granny says.

Cut to Peter chained to a tree, yelling at Red to stop. She's the wolf.

Back at the station, Emma looks in the box. Ruby asks if it's what she thinks it is. It is.

Ruby's freaked out, but Emma tells her she did a great job finding David and then the box. Emma's impressed.

Granny and Snow head out in the woods to find Red. Granny knew. Red's mother was one, too, but was killed by a hunting party. Red starting turning when she was 13. Granny paid a wizard for the cloak, but Red doesn't always wear it.

The story she told was about Red's grandfather. He marked her that night, then came back and turned her. She says it's mostly faded away, but she's tracking Red by smell. They hear a wolf braying. Granny approaches with the crossbow. They come upon the wolf tearing into Peter.

The wolf turns and lunges at them. Granny shoots her with the arrow. Snow throws the cloak over Red and she turns back. Red is confused. The hunting party is approaching. She turns and sees Peter's body. Snow tells her she's the wolf. Red is distraught as the hunting party appears in the distance, Snow helps her away.

Back in the diner, Ruby visits Granny -- who has the wolf claw scars on her arm. Ruby tells her she wants to come back. She wasn't mad, she was scared of the extra responsibility. Granny assures her she's ready and can handle it. Granny tells her she wanted to learn the books so she could take over the place and own it when she retires. Granny tells Ruby she's proud of her.

Mary Margaret visits with David at the pet shelter, he's worried about what he might have done. Emma joins them. She tells them they found a box and it had a human heart inside. There were fingerprints in the box and a matchto a specific person. David tells Emma to arrest to arrest him.

But the fingerprints weren't his.

They were Mary Margaret's."

Red tells the prince to take off without her. She tells him she's giving him a head start, then, as he rides away, she turns into a wolf and jumps right toward the pack of knights who were chasing them. As he rides away, we catch a glimpse of a ""Wanted"" sign featuring Snow White's face, reading that she's wanted for murder and treason.

Back in Storybrooke, Emma is taking Mary Margaret's mug shots at the sheriff's office. She still doesn't believe Mary Margaret killed Kathryn, but she ""has to go where the evidence leads."" Mary Magaret says it's insane that the evidence shows she cut out Kathryn's heart and buried it. Emma says that if she shows Mary Margaret any favortism, Regina will have her fired and replace her with someone who will railroad Mary Margaret.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see a Snow White who isn't quite so whimsical as we've always thought. She sings to a blue bird until it comes close enough for her to take a swing at it with a broom. When Grumpy asks her what she's doing, she says, ""Getting rid of the vermin in this house."" She doesn't want to eat, but Grumpy tells her he and the dwarves ""made something extra special tonight."" She shows up in the dining area and Jiminy Cricket is there to tell her that her friends have something to tell her. They say she's ""changed."" She hasn't been very nice to any of them, and even Happy is telling her how horrible she's been. Grumpy tells her the potion she drank changed her. She insists the potion was the solution, not the problem. She says the problem is that she's living with dwarves instead of in her palace with her father, as a princess. She's angry at the queen. Jiminy says that's understandable, but it isn't fair of her to take it out on her friends. Snow says he's right, and that she ""should be taking it out on her."" She sets out to get revenge, despite everyone asking her not to. She says she's going ""to kill the queen.""

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret shows up in an interview room and finds Regina there as a third-party witness to ensure Emma stays impartial. Emma proceeds with questioning that reveals David and Mary Margaret's affair. Emma shows Mary Margaret her own jewelry box, which is what they found the heart in. Mary Margaret insists it must have been stolen. Regina claims to empathize, telling her she knows what it's like to lose someone you love -- and that it changes someone. Emma pulls Regina outside and reminds Regina that she (Emma) was supposed to do the questioning. Regina asks Emma how she's so sure Mary Margaret didn't do it. She says there'd be signs of a break-in if the jewelry box had been stolen, and reiterates to Emma that Mary Margaret had her heart broken, which can make people do ""unspeakable things.""

Back in Fairy Tale Land, we see Snow on her quest for revenge. She sets up a trap to knock a knight of his horse and interrogates him (pretty violently) for information on the queen's whereabouts. He tells her she's in her castle, but will be leaving in the morning for the summer palace. She tells him the summer palace was built for her mother, and knocks him out with the back of her pick-axe. Grumpy finds her taking the knight's armor and asks her what she's doing. She says she's going to do whatever she has to do to get into the castle. He says he's there to help her. He's going to take her back to Rumplestiltskin so he can reserve the memory-altering affects of the potion. Grumpy tells Snow that Rumple ""can do anything."" This gets her attention.

Emma is searching the apartment for signs of a break-in, when Henry shows up to see how he can help. He says Regina has a motive. ""She hates Snow White,"" he says. Emma doubts this motive will hold up in court. They hear a noise and Emma pulls a vent off the floor to discover a knife hidden inside.

Henry is bummed and August finds him at the diner. August urges Henry to look to his book for the answers he's looking for. Henry says ""it's just a book,"" but August says they both know that's not the case. Henry's interest is piqued. August tells Henry he is also ""a believer"" and he wants ""to help others to see the light."" Emma is one of the people he's trying to help believe, and she needs proof. Henry opens up the book.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming comes across the knight who Snow White assaulted. He tells the prince about Snow White's attack, but the prince refuses to believe that Snow is ""bloodthirsty.""

David visits Regina and tells her he doesn't believe Mary Margaret could have killed Kathryn. Regina tells him ""everyone has a dark side."" David says he doesn't think Mary Margaret could do such an evil thing. Regina says she thinks ""evil isn't born, it's made."" David tells Regina she doesn't know anything about evil. David starts to wonder whether he blacked out and did it himself.

Mary Margaret tells Emma she doesn't even know where the heating vent in her room is. Emma says she still believes Mary Margaret is innocent, but suggests she get a lawyer. Mr. Gold shows up and offers his services. Emma wants him to leave, but Mary Margaret is happy for the assistance. Emma leaves and Mary Margaret tells Mr. Gold she can't pay him. He says he's not interested in money, he has a vested interest in her future.

In Fairy Tale Land, Grumpy is asking Rumple about the potion, which Rumple explains ""took away her love, left a big hole in her heart."" He says there's no potion that can bring back true love, because it's the most true magic of all. He asks Snow what she really wants, and she says she wants his help to kill the queen. He gives her a bow and arrow that always hits its target. He says she'll have to hit the queen with it when she's on her way to the summer palace. Snow asks Rumple what he wants in return and he says he's ""invested in (her) future.""

David pays a visit to Dr. Archie Hopper and asks for help remembering what happened during his blackouts.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming tracks down Rumplestiltskin. After a little discussion, Rumple tells the prince that true love's kiss will reverse the potion's affects. In return for information on Snow's whereabouts, Rumple wants the prince's cloak. He readily gives it up. Rumple warns the prince to find her quickly, because evil isn't born, it's made. The prince does track Snow down quickly and plants a kiss on her, but she punches him out.

In storybrooke, Henry shows Emma ""proof."" He shows Emma the keys Regina has to all the houses in town. He proceeds to try all the keys on the massive key ring. After a couple of failed tries, Emma agrees to try one more -- and the door opens.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince Charming comes to and finds himself tied up. Snow still doesn't remember who he is, and she's just as determined as ever to kill the queen. He begs her not to do it as she walks away.

In storybrooke, Dr. Hopper asks David to go back to his last memory of talking to Kathryn. As David is retracing his memories, the ones from Storybrooke and Fairy Tale Land converge in his mind, and he sees a flash of who he thinks is Mary Margaret (but is actually Snow White) in the forest, and he is shouting, ""You can't kill her!"" David's eyes open and he tells Dr. Hopper, ""It was..."" He stops and runs out, telling Dr. Hopper he can't help.

In Fairy Tale Land, Jiminy Cricket finds Prince Charming and helps free him. He tells the prince that Snow can't remember who he (the prince) is until she remembers who she is. We next see Snow tracking the queen and her caravan, and preparing to shoot the arrow. She fires, and Prince Charming jumps in front of the arrow,piercing his shoulder. She asks him what he's doing, and he says he's going to show her actions rather than words. He tells her he loves her, but she says she doesn't love him. ""I don't even remember you,"" she says. He tells her he would rather die than let her fill her heart with darkness.

""You would really die for me?"" she asks. She says no one has ever done anything like this for her before.

""No one you can remember,"" he says. They kiss, and she does remember him, and her love for him. But then King George's soldiers arrive, throw a few punches, and take Prince Charming away as a prisoner. Snow shouts to him ""I will always find you.""

Back in Storybrooke, David visits Mary Margaret in the holding cell. Because his memories are confused, he thinks she wanted to kill Kathryn. He's confused, and they end up fighting. She breaks down and kicks him out.

Back in the Enchanted Forest, Snow returns to the dwarfs, upset. She gives one of the dwarfs a new mug, and apologizes to all of them. It's a happy reunion, but she has to leave again to go after James. The dwarfs agree to go with her.

In Storybrooke, Mary Margaret is making up the cot, and finds a key. It fits her cell. She almost escapes, but Emma returns with breakfast. Emma tells her the DNA of the heart matches Kathryn, so she has no choice but to charge Mary Margaret with murder, though she believes Regina is framing her. Emma plans to take Regina on, but needs time to do it right. Mary Margaret agrees to give her time, then pulls out the key again.

Emma goes to visit Mr. Gold, and tells him what she thinks. She wants advice and help. She doesn't care so much about his methods, so long as it gets results. He tells her she's more powerful than she thinks she is.

In the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin is doing something with potions and vials. He mixes Snow White's hair with one from James that he got off of James's cloak.

Back in Storybrooke, we're shown Mary Margaret's empty jail cell."

Henry's book is open to the story of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and he looks a bit confused. Emma finds Henry (Jared Gilmore) sitting in the sheriff's office. He says he wants to congratulate Emma on the genius plan -- escape. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) are surprised to see Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) is missing. Emma knows she needs to find Mary Margaret before her 8 a.m. arraignment. Mr. Gold warns Emma that Mary Margaret's future is in jeopardy and if Emma is caught helping her, her own future is jeopardized, as well. She doesn't care.

Emma is driving in a dense fog and nearly hits a pedestrian near the woods. She stops to make sure he's OK, and he's limping after taking a fall to avoid getting hit. She insists on driving him somewhere. He introduces himself as Jefferson (Sebastian Stan), and gets in the car.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see this same man running away in the woods. But his daughter Grace soon finds him. They're playing hide-and-seek before looking for mushrooms to sell at the market. They get home and find the Queen and her carriage waiting outside their house. The man tells his daughter to sit tight while he goes to find out what's happening. She runs into the woods while he goes toward the house.

Inside, the Queen (looking every bit ""Queen""-like) is waiting and she calls him Jefferson. He calls her Regina (Lana Parrilla). This is weird. She says she has a job for him. He doesn't want his daughter to lose her father, having already lost her mother. Regina/The Queen insists if he does this one last favor for her, she can get him and his daughter the life they've always wanted. She says she needs his skills to get her somewhere. She hands him a slip of paper. He asks what she could possibly want there. She says something of hers was taken and found its way over there, and she wants it back. He tells her to find someone else to get it. She claims she understands, and adds, ""there's nothing more important than family.""

In Storybrooke, Emma drives Jefferson to a huge house. She thinks he must have a huge family, but he says it's just him. She goes inside with him. He gives her some tea and shows her a map of the town he's been working on. Soon after drinking the tea, she begins to feel dizzy. She notices as she's staggering onto the couch his limp is gone. He says, ""Oh, I guess you caught me.""

""Who are you?"" she asks, just before losing consciousness.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Grace and her father at the market. She finds a stuffed rabbit and asks her father to buy it. He's just short of enough money and the seller refuses to take what he has. Grace kindly tells her father she doesn't need it, and he walks away frustrated. We see the seller was really the Queen in an old woman's disguise.

In Storybrooke, Emma wakes up bound and gagged. She smashes the tea cup to use the broken pieces in order to cut herself free. She finds a telescope at the window pointed directly at the sheriff's office, and is puzzled to see the door to her office is open. She follows noises of a blade being sharpened and opens a door to see Jefferson sharpening a pair of scissors.

In Fairy Tale Land, we see Jefferson using scissors to finish making a makeshift rabbit for his daughter. She thanks him and continues her tea party with her stuffed animals. Jefferson tells his daughter he's going to be gone for the rest of the day and is sending her to the neighbor's house. She asks him not to do whatever the Queen wanted him to do. He says she wants her to have what she needs, but she says all she wants is him. She makes him promise he'll come back for their tea party. He says he wouldn't miss it for the world. She goes.

After Grace leaves, Jefferson opens a chest and pulls out a leather case and places it in the middle of the floor.

In Storybrooke, Emma sneaks down the hall and after a wooden plank in the floor squeaks, she sneaks into the next door she sees. In that room, she finds Mary Margaret bound to a chair and gagged, crying.

Emma frees her. Mary Margaret tells her a man grabbed her in the woods and brought her there. She also tells Emma she found a key under the pillow in her cell. She doesn't know who put it there, and neither does Emma. But they both want to know. Emma sneaks them out of the room. Jefferson finds them. He knows Emma doesn't want anyone to find out what she's up to, and he forces Emma to tie Mary Margaret back up. She does. Jefferson tells Emma he now needs her to do something.

In Fairy Tale Land, Jefferson pays a visit to the Queen. He's holding the box. He asks for a guarantee. If he does what she wants, his daughter will want for nothing. The Queen tells him he has her word. He pulls a hat out of the box, puts it on the floor and spins it. A purple cloud swirls around it and it forms a cyclone in the middle of the room. Jefferson and the Queen jump into the middle of it together.

Jefferson takes Emma into a room full of hats on shelves. He says he's trying to save Mary Margaret's life, and he mentions the curse keeping everyone in Storybrooke -- except Emma. She asks if he's been reading Henry's book, and he mocks her for ignoring the stories in it. He says that if she knew what he knows, she wouldn't ignore them. She asks him why he's been spying on her, and he says for the last 28 years he's been stuck in the house day after day until she came into town and the clock ticked and things started to change.

""I know what you refuse to acknowledge,"" he tells her. She's special, and brought ""magic"" to Storybrooke. She tells him he's insane. He tells her she's probably the one who's insane because she refuses to see what's in front of her. He tells her he wants her ""to get it to work."" He sits her down and faces her toward his hat.

In Fairy Tale Land, the Queen and Jefferson are at ""the entrance."" He tells her they have to stick together because the same amount of people that go in must come out. They step into Wonderland. Jefferson says he hates it.

In Storybrooke, Jefferson tells Emma to make a hat. She pieces together the hat, the tea and the insane behavior. She knows he thinks he's the Mad Hatter. He says his name is Jefferson. She tells him the stories aren't real. He tells her that her world is no more real than his. He tells her there are ""infinite more"" worlds out there. All of them have their own rules -- some have magic, some don't. And some need magic, ""like this one -- and that's where you come in."" He tells her she and Mary Margaret aren't going anywhere until Emma makes his hat and gets it to work.

""And then what?"" she asks.

""Then I can go home,"" he says.

In Fairy Tale Land, Jefferson and the Queen get to a series of arches at the beginning of the land belonging to the Queen of Hearts. The Queen pressures him to move forward. She gets to a vault with a wall full of boxes. She takes one but some knights catch them as they try to make their escape. They get close to the looking glass, which is their escape route, but the Queen stops and breaks off a piece of a mushroom. She opens the box and puts the piece inside the box. A massive purple cloud emerges and her father emerges.

The Queen explains the Queen of Hearts has always considered her a threat, so she wanted leverage -- and so she took the Queen's father. The Queen is now taking him back. Jefferson realizes he'll be stuck there if the Queen leaves with her father -- because only the same number of people who came in are allowed to go out. The Queen reminds Jefferson one should never abandon family. Jefferson is distraught, realizing he won't return to his daughter. The Queen tells him if he really cared for his daughter he wouldn't have left her in the first place.

The Queen and her father leave, and knights come to take Jefferson back to the Queen of Hearts.

The Queen of Hearts, giving questions through a knight, wants to know how Jefferson got to Wonderland. He says with his hat.

""Off with his head,"" she orders, and a knight slices Jefferson's head clean off -- but he's surprised to still be alive and talking, while a knight is holding his head up the hair. The knight tells Jefferson since Regina took his hat, he should make another one that works.

In Storybrooke, Emma is trying to do just that. Jefferson tells her -- like everyone else there -- what he loves most has been ripped from him. He asks her to take a look through another telescope. It's pointed at another house where his daughter is living as Paige with another family. Emma asks why he doesn't say something to her, and he says he doesn't want to inflict his curse on his daughter -- the curse of knowledge of their real life.

Emma starts to cry and tells him she knows what it's like to be separated from his kid. She says it can make you feel like you're losing your mind. He says it's real, and Emma agrees maybe it is. He asks if she believes.

""If what you're saying is true, that woman in the other room is my mother,"" she says, adding she wants more than anything to believe that's true. She agrees maybe she needs to open her mind up to magic.

He lets his guard down after she says she'll try to get his hat to work. Jefferson turns back and she uses the telescope to take a swing and knock him out. She runs to free Mary Margaret. Jefferson catches up and a scuffle ensues. At one point, we and Emma catch a long look at the scar on Jefferson's neck from when the knight sliced it off. He finally grabs his gun and has a clean shot at Emma, but Mary Margaret hits him from behind with a croquet mallet, and kicks him through a window, from which he falls several floors to the ground.

Emma is stunned and they look out the window to find only the hat on the ground, with no trace of Jefferson.

Outside, Emma and Mary Margaret see no sign of Jefferson. Mary Margaret also has no idea where her sudden close-combat skills came from. Emma finds her car covered with a tarp, and the keys are on the driver's seat. Emma gives the keys to Mary Margaret, telling her she has the choice of whether to run or face the charges against her and trust Emma things will turn out well. Emma asks Mary Margaret if she'd rather face this together than alone. Mary Margaret gives back the keys.

The church bells ring and Emma remembers the 8 a.m. arraignment. We next see Regina pulling up to the Sheriff's office and Emma's yellow car isn't in the Sheriff's spot. Regina looks quite pleased as she walks in, but she's stunned inside when she sees Mary Margaret sitting in her cell reading a newspaper. Mr. Gold tells Regina his client is not having any visitors.

Regina walks out and Mr. Gold follows. In the hallway, Mr. Gold explains to Regina that Mary Margaret ""came back.""

""You said this would work,"" Regina says. ""That she'd take the key, that she'd go.""

Mr. Gold says she did, ""but it seems that Ms. Swan is rather more resourceful than we thought.""

He tells Regina not to worry, because Mary Margaret is still guilty of murder. ""You may yet get what you want,"" he says.

Regina tells him the only reason she made a deal with him is because she wanted results. He assures her she'll have them, adding, ""See you at the arraignment."" She leaves.

Emma finds Henry at school and tells him she found Mary Margaret and she's OK, ""other than being on trial for murder."" Paige comes by and says hi. As she walks away, Emma asks Henry for his story book. She's curious about something.

She flips through the pages and sees the pictures of Jefferson with his daughter Grace, and his hat, and the slice on his neck.

We see a flash of Jefferson, surrounded by hats he has made, going insane trying to make a hat that works.

Henry goes back into school. Emma asks if she can keep the book for a while. Henry lets her hang onto it, and runs inside. Emma looks more closely at the book."

Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) catches her, asking, ""Remembrance of things past?""

We see this meeting happened a week earlier, with Mr. Gold asking Regina for a favor in exchange for help with (her) Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) problem. It was Mr. Gold's suggestion to stage Kathryn's death and frame Mary Margaret for the murder. The plan included leaving a key to the jail cell for Mary Margaret to use for her escape, and, as Mr. Gold says, ""We all know what happens when people try to leave Storybrooke.""

In Fairy Tale Land, we see a younger version of Regina earning praise from her father for riding her horse. Her mother disapproves, though, saying the girl is becoming an ""old maid."" Regina asks Cora why she always has to criticize her, but her mother says she's trying to help. When Regina tries to walk away, Cora (Barbara Hershey) casts a spell to suspend her in the air until she promises to ""be good.""

Regina runs away to the stable and meets with Daniel, the stable boy, and they kiss.

It's today again in Storybrooke and David (Josh Dallas) is concerned for Mary Margaret, asking Emma about the situation. He still doesn't think Mary Margaret is guilty. Emma tells him Mary Margaret doesn't want visitors. When David asks what Mary Margaret needs, Emma says, ""A miracle.""

Mary Margaret wakes up startled in her jail cell. Regina is watching her. Regina offers Mary Margaret the chance to confess and spare the town and herself a trial. Mary Margaret asks Regina what she ever did to her to make her hate her so much.

Back in Fairy Tale Land, Regina meets up with Daniel but can't stay long. Regina tells Daniel she can't be with him because of her mother, who thinks one's trajectory should always move upward. Regina sees a girl on the back of a horse out of control. The girl is screaming for help. Regina gets on her horse to chase the wild one down. She pulls the young girl to safety and when the girl says she'll never ride a horse again, Regina gives her a pep talk. The young girl then introduces herself as Snow White. They hug.

Mr. Gold wants Mary Margaret to kiss up to the District Attorney. Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) interrupts, bringing a vase of flowers to Emma's office and reporting that he hasn't been able to find anything, but he vows he won't stop until he does find something. When Emma comes back to Mary Margaret and Mr. Gold, Mary Margaret has decided she will talk to the D.A. The D.A. walks in, introducing himself as Mr. Spencer -- it's King George from Fairy Tale Land.

Mr. Spencer grills Mary Margaret until she finally says, ""Yes, of course I wanted her gone. She was the only thing keeping us apart, so, yeah, I wanted her gone -- is that what you wanted to hear?""

In Fairy Tale Land, Regina has her horse-riding clothes out when her mother casts a spell to change her into a gown. The king -- Snow White's father -- is visiting. He's there to thank Regina for saving his daughter's life. The king explains Snow's mother passed away years ago. He says he's scoured the land for a wife and has yet to find a woman with an interest in his daughter until now. He proposes. Regina's mother says, ""Yes.""

Regina flees and finds Daniel and asks him to marry her. She tearfully explains to him the king's proposal and her mother's acceptance, and says the only way out is to run. Daniel slips a ring on Regina's finger and they kiss. Snow White catches them kissing. She asks Regina what she's doing with the stable boy, but before Regina explains, Snow White runs away.

Regina chases down Snow and explains to her while the king is a kind man, she doesn't love him. Regina tells young Snow love is a kind of magic that creates happiness. After hearing this, Snow insists Regina must marry the stable boy if tha'ts who she really loves. Snow wants to tell the king the good news, but Regina tells her no one can know. She asks Snow to keep it a secret. Snow says she thinks she can. She promises, especially, never to tell Regina's mother.

In Storybrooke, August (Eion Bailey) finds Emma (Jennifer Morrison) reading Henry's book, but she says she's grasping at straws. August suggests Emma re-examine what shes already done to see if her perspective changes. Emma gets up to go to the scene of the crime. August insists on coming with her.

Near the bridge, Emma finds a shard of a shovel she thinks might fill in the missing piece to explain who really buried Kathryn's heart.

Henry (Jared Gilmore) helps Emma and August break into Regina's house by giving them a heads up over the walkie-talkie when Regina goes to take a shower. Emma and August look in the garage through Regina's tools and find the shovel with a missing piece that matches the shard Emma found exactly.

Snow and Regina's mother talk in Fairy Tale Land. Regina's mother asks Snow why Regina pulled away from her. She says she loves Regina so much but Regina doesn't let her help. Regina's mother says she'd do anything to show Regina her happiness is all that matters. Snow weighs this and then tells Regina's mother not to let Regina get married to the king because she really loves someone else.

In Storybrooke,Emma shows up at Regina's house with a search warrant and asks her to open the garage. Emma strides into the garage and sees a perfectly unbroken shovel. Emma asks Regina where the shovel went, and how she knew Emma was coming. Regina tells Emma that Mary Margaret is going to pay for what she's done.

Emma goes to August's house because she thinks he told Regina about the shovel, but he swears he didn't. Emma doesn't entirely believe him.

Regina visits Mary Margaret in her jail cell and rubs in how much she's looking forward to the trial. Mary Margaret gets upset and cries and begs Regina to forgive her for whatever she did to make her so angry at her. She cries, ""I don't deserve this, I didn't do it."" Regina replies, ""I know, but you do deserve this.""

In Fairy Tale Land, Regina's mother stops Regina and Daniel's escape, and casts a spell on them to lock them in the stable. Regina asks her mother to listen to her, and says she wants to be with Daniel. Cora doesn't want her to be the wife of a stable boy. Regina vows her mother's magic can't keep her apart from Daniel. Regina tells her mother she'll have to keep them there in the stable forever to stop them from escaping.

Cora acts as if she's OK with it, and says, ""Who am I to stop you?"" Regina hugs her mother and Regina's mother pulls Daniel aside and compassionately offers him advice about a parent always doing whats best for their child. Daniel agrees and says that's what she's doing for Regina. Regina's mother agrees and promptly rips Daniel's heart out of his chest, and turns it into ash. Regina is stunned and cries over Daniels body while her mother tells her this is her ""happy ending.""

""Love is weakness, Regina,"" her mother says. She adds pure power endures and says once she has real power, she won't have to rely on anyone to get what she wants. Her mother tells her to wipe away her tears because she's going to be Queen.

Snow sees Regina in her wedding dress and says she looks beautiful. Snow thinks Regina is about to marry Daniel because her mother would do anything for Regina's happiness. When Regina realizes this, she's speechless and nearly falls over. She pulls Snow aside and asks if Snow told her mother about Regina and Daniel. Snow apologizes for breaking the promise and says, ""I just didn't want you to lose your mother the way I lost mine.""

Regina suddenly shifts from sadness to wild-eyed vengeance. She tells Snow what she had with Daniel was infatuation and he has gone away. She's going to marry Snow's father and be Snow's stepmother, and she's going to be so happy. Cora tells Regina she's proud of how she's already adjusting. Regina winds up asking her mother if the horse with Snow on it went wild on its own. Her mother claims to know nothing about it. Regina walks away and says, ""I should've let her die on that horse.""

In Storybrooke, Regina clutches her ring and says, ""We got her, Daniel. We got her."" Mary Margaret is escorted from her jail cell. Emma confronts Mr. Gold about how he swore he could defend Mary Margaret. He insists there's still time for her to work some magic. Emma goes into her office, grabs a vase and hurls it at the wall in anger. In the pieces, she finds what looks to be a bug.

Emma goes to August to apologize for doubting him. She shows him the bug, which was from Sidney, who'd delivered the vase days earlier.

They hear a scream from behind the diner and run back to find Ruby, in shock, saying, ""She's in the alley.""

Emma goes back behind the diner and sees a body on the ground. She turns it over and it's Kathryn -- alive."

With Gold (Robert Carlyle) distracted, August creeps in the back door and heads for the back. Gold finds him. August says he's looking for maps.

Emma (Jennifer Morrison) visits Kathryn in the hospital. She remembers being in a car accident and waking up in a basement with food and water. Dr. Whale (David Anders) says she was drugged. She remembers waking up a field and going into town. Emma thinks someone was trying to frame Mary Margaret. They're looking into who faked the DNA results. Kathryn can't fathom who would do such a thing.

Regina (Lana Parrilla) accuses Gold of breaking their deal. He assures her he's broken one deal in his life and it wasn't this one. ""Kathryn was supposed to die and Mary Margaret was to get the blame!"" Regina says.

Gold thinks murder seems so much worse here. Gold reminds her Regina didn't say ""kill her"", she said ""something tragic"" and abduction qualifies. He ends the argument with a please.

Regina realizes there will be questions about the fake DNA test results and key in her cell. She doesn't understand why he'd turn on her now, since he's the one who created the curse for her in the first place.

In Fairy Tale land, a boy runs in front of a cart after his ball and the merchant yells but stops when he realizes who the boy is. It's Rumplestiltskin's son. He assures his father he's fine, but when Rump sees the cut on his son's leg he turns the man into a snail over Baelfire's objections. He stomps on the snail as his son cries no.

In the hospital, David (Josh Dallas) visits Kathryn. He apologizes for everything, but she's extremely understanding, saying what they had just wasn't right for him.

Emma hosts a welcome home party for MM. Henry conspires with August, asking if he found what he was looking for at Gold's. August has a feeling it'll find him.

Henry gives MM his present -- a giant card from the class that says ""We're so glad you didn't kill Mrs. Nolan!"" Emma goes to take Henry home, but runs into David at the door. MM isn't ready to see him yet, so Emma suggests he take Henry home to get rid of him.

Emma confronts Gold, asking if he's the one who made Kathryn materialize. ""Are you proposing I'm working with Regina, or against her?"" Gold asks. ""I don't know, maybe diagonally,"" Emma says.

Gold asks her about August. ""He's a writer; a typewriter wrapped in an enigma wrapped in stubble,"" Emma says. Gold thinks August Booth is a fake name and tells her about him poking around his shop. Emma trusts August a lot more than she trusts Gold.

Fairy Tale land Rumplestiltskin brings his son home and starts to heal his knee with magic, but his son doesn't want magic. Baelfire (Dylan Schmid) tells his dad he's different now.

Rumple points out he's brokered an ogre truce and saved lives. But Baelfire wants him to try to get rid of his power. The only way Rumple knows of is if someone stabs him with the Rumplestiltskin knife.

Baelfire asks if his dad would go along with getting rid of his magic if he found a way that didn't involve dying. Rumple says all he wants is his happiness and agrees. Bael makes them shake on it. The deal is struck.

Storybrooke

Rumple breaks into August's room and pokes around. He soon finds a drawing of the Rumplestiltskin knife.

Emma joins Sidney (Giancarlo Esposito) at the diner, confronting him with the bug he planted. Emma tells him there's a DNA trail in a basement somewhere and she's going to find it and he and Regina will be in a lot of trouble. Sidney defends her as an ""amazing woman"" and Emma realizes he's in love with Regina. Emma warns him he's going to end up going down with Regina, too.

Mr. Gold follows August through town.

Fairy Tale land

Rumple leaves Bael to play with local children, but they're all afraid of him. A girl named Morraine joins him. He tells her about trying to find a way to get rid of his dad's power. She tells him about the original being that roams the night which is more powerful than his father.

Rumplestiltskin returns and Bael sees blood on his shoes. His dad announces they need a new maid. She heard them talking about the knife. He doesn't care she was mute and couldn't tell anyone. Bael is horrified.

Storybrooke Mr. Gold sees August talking to Mother Superior (Keegan Connor Tracy). When August leaves, he interrogates her. She says August came to town looking for his father after a long separation and he recently found him. But he hasn't spoken to him yet because it was a difficult parting.

Fairy Tale Land Bael creeps out into the woods at night, and quietly calls to the powerful one. The Blue Fairy/Mother Superior arrives, saying she can help with good magic. Bael says his father is The Dark One. She offers to send him somewhere without magic -- it's the only way for him to get his father back. She gives him a magic bean, the last known to their kind. She tells him to follow it where it leads him.

Storybrooke David meets MM on the street. He apologizes, but she tells him she'll never forget what it felt like to not have his support. He points out it was a really good frame job, but she can't get past him not believing in her. ""It's like something in this world doesn't want us together,"" she says. He tells her he loves her, but she says that just makes everything sadder.

Fairy Tale Land Bael comes home to his father, who is spinning gold. He tells him about meeting with the blue fairy. Rumplestiltskin says fairy magic doesn't mix well with what he is. Bael says they could be happy somewhere else without magic. He reminds his father about the deal he made and asks if he's backing out. Rumple says no.

Storybrooke Mr. Gold visits Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who is willing to listen. Gold tells him he thinks he might have found his son, but he's not sure if he's only seeing what he wants to see. He thinks his son might still be very angry.

Archie assures him anger between a parent and a child is the most natural thing in the world. ""I think he might be here to kill me,"" Gold says. ""Oh well, that's not,"" Archie says.

Gold has spent his whole life trying to fix things but now he's here and doesn't know what to do. Archie tells him he just has to be honest with him.

Gold finds August at the cabin. He opens with telling August he knows who he is. ""Well, I guess all the lying can stop. Papa,"" August says.

Fairy Tale Land

Bael leads his father through the forest. Rumplestiltskin asks where they're going, what kind of world it is without magic. Bael throws the bean on the ground and a whirlwind opens in the ground, like a tornado. Bael tries to convince his father to go through. Rumple says he can't. The hole gets bigger. Bael starts to slip into it.

Rumplestiltskin holds onto it, protesting he can't go. Bael calls him a coward and reminds him he promised, but Rumple won't go.

Bael slips through the hole, leaving his father behind.

When the ground closes, Rumple claws at it, saying he wants to go with him.

Storybrooke

Gold tells August he was right about him being a coward and he should have gone with him and ever since he left, he's been trying to find him.

Gold asks August to do what he's always done and be the bigger man. He breaks down crying, saying he's sorry. August hugs him. When Gold asks if he can truly forgive him, August says yes.

Gold guesses August was looking for the knife. He thought if his dad still had it, it would mean he hadn't changed. Gold suggests they go look for it.

August digs. Gold explains he buried it shortly after Emma came to town. He didn't want to take the chance of Regina finding it.

They dig it up. Gold gives it to August, telling him to destroy it. He tells August he chose the knife once, but this time he's choosing his son. Gold hands it over to August.

August takes it but then points it at Gold, saying ""I command thee, dark one!"" Gold realizes he's trying to control him. ""You're not my son,"" Gold says.

Gold tells him his son would know the knife can't harness magic in this world because there isn't any. That's why he chose this world, because there isn't any magic.

Gold takes the knife back, guessing August is from Fairy Tale Land. He wants to know how August knew about him and the knife and why he took the risk of messing with him.

August says he's sick and he needs magic. Gold leaves him.

Fairy Tale Land

Rumplestiltskin summons the blue fairy. She tells him there are no other beans to transport him. He guesses a curse might work. She says it would come at a great price and mean sacrificing this world. Rumplestiltskin swears he'll do nothing but work to get his son back.

Storybrooke Emma comes to the sheriff's office and finds Regina waiting for her. She introduces Sidney and prompts him to repeat what he just told her. Sidney confesses to everything, saying he did it so he could rescue her and be a hero and get a book deal. Emma doesn't believe him for a second.

In the hallway, Emma tells Regina it's the biggest load of crap she's ever heard. Emma warns Regina she's about to start playing a different game and all she cares about is Henry. Regina tried to take away someone she loves, so now Emma's going to take away some Regina loves. ""I am taking back my son,"" Emma says."

Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) is getting ready to go back to her teaching job after her time in jail. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) tells August and Mary Margaret she hired Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) to help build a case for taking Henry (Jared Gilmore) away from Regina. Mary Margaret asks if she's ready to be Henry's mom and Emma says yes. Henry contacts Emma on the walkie talkie and asks her to meet him at Granny's due to an emergency. Emma leaves right away. August suggests Emma take the day off and go with him to a secret location. Emma says her kid needs her. She doesn't have time.

At Granny's, Henry tells Emma someone added a new but unfinished story to the book about Pinocchio.

In Fairy Tale Land, Pinocchio and his father are on a raft in a stormy sea trying to outrun a whale. There's only one life vest and Pinocchio refuses to take it, telling his father to ""save yourself."" The father wakes up the next morning on a beach with the life vest. He finds Pinocchio dead, face down on the beach. The father picks him up and cries the he wishes he could have saved him. The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) floats downs from the sky. ""You still can,"" she says. She waves her wand over Pinocchio and he's transformed from a puppet to a boy. He wakes up and says, ""I'm a real boy."" The father thanks the fairy. ""This is all I've ever wanted,"" he says. She tells them to go live as a family. The Blue Fairy reminds Pinocchio to be ""brave, truthful and unselfish. So long as you do that you'll always remain a real boy.""

Back in Storybrooke, August calls Mr. Gold and says they have to talk about a problem with Emma. As he's getting up to leave, he jumps back in pain and pulls up his pants leg to reveal a wooden stick where his leg should be.

Regina approaches Mary Margaret at school, explaining she's there because Henry forgot his lunch. Mary Margaret tells Regina he's with ""his mother."" Regina asks if there's something wrong with Mary Margaret who tells her ""not anymore,"" although she had been framed for murder by ""someone."" When Regina asks if she's insinuating something, Mary Margaret replies she is but she forgives her because only someone terribly lonely would try to attack other people's happiness.

""It won't make you happy,"" she tells her. As Henry walks up, Mary Margaret walks away. Regina tells him she wants to transfer him to a new class. He asks Regina if she wants him to have a new teacher because she framed Mary Margaret. When Regina asks if Henry thinks she's capable of such a thing, he replies, ""Of course. You're the evil queen."" Regina tells him the fairy tales aren't real. Henry tells her she can't stop Snow White from getting her happy ending or being with Prince Charming.

""The curse will end. Good will win,"" says Henry before insisting he won't transfer to a new class.

August enters Mr. Gold's shop to find an old man (who we recognize as Pinocchio's father) trying to sell an antique clock. August seems shocked to see the old man. The old man, who doesn't seem to recognize August, leaves and Mr. Gold asks if it's August's first time seeing ""dear old Dad since you arrived in Storybrooke?""

Mr. Gold asks why a man who says he's about to die can't say hello to his own father. August replies that is his business. Mr. Gold says August claims to be the only person who can get Emma to believe and do what she was brought to Storybrooke to do. August says Emma is slowing things down because all she can think about is getting custody of Henry. August asks Mr. Gold to steer Emma to him through his legal advice about custody. Mr. Gold says he has trouble trusting August given what he knows about his nature.

In Fairy Tale Land, Pinocchio helps his father fix a coo-coo clock. When Jiminy Cricket pops out of the clock tied up, the father asks Pinocchio if he did this and reminds him what the Blue Fairy said about being a good boy. Jiminy says Pinocchio didn't mean any harm. The Blue Fairy appears and says she has bad news. Pinocchio leaves the room with Jiminy. The Blue Fairy tells Pinocchio's father the Evil Queen has threatened the kingdom with a curse. She says there's hope if the father will help. She tells him Snow White is about to have a baby who will save everyone in the kingdom when she reaches her 28th year. Pinocchio's father asks how he can protect this child. The Blue Fairy tells him there's an enchanted tree -- like the one he carved Pinocchio from -- that can protect Snow White's child from the Queen's magic if carved into a wardrobe. Pinocchio's father says he's already lost too much to lose his boy.

Back in Storybrooke, Emma tells Mr. Gold she has to save Henry from Regina. Mr. Gold says he won't take her case because they can't prove what Regina did and she has too much power in town. Emma urges him to change his mind, but he says he's not the man to help her beat Regina. Emma leaves angry and goes to August's house. She tells him she's out of options and he once said to beat Regina she needs to see the ""big picture.""

""Show it to me,"" she says to August.

David (Josh Dallas) sees Regina struggling with her car, which she says won't start. He checks it out and says the battery is dead, and offers her a ride because she has a car full of groceries. She accepts, and calls him her ""knight in shining armor."" She invites him to stay for dinner once they get to her house. David says it's late and he has to get up early for work. He goes inside and Regina sees a note addressed to ""Mom."" We see it's blank, but she tells David the note is from Henry. He's having dinner with a friend and won't be coming home. She tells David she shouldn't be burdening him with her problems. He starts to leave, then decides to stay for dinner after all. Regina smiles that evil smile.

In Fairy Tale Land, Gepetto (Tony Amendola), Pinocchio, Jiminy (Raphael Sbarge) and the Blue Fairy find the enchanted oak tree. Gepetto says he can make a wardrobe out of it. The wardrobe has to be big enough to protect two from the Queen's curse -- Snow White and the prince -- who will step inside before the curse strikes, and travel to a distant land where Snow will give birth to her child. When the child reaches her 28th year, she'll begin the battle that will defeat the Evil Queen. Gepetto realizes once the curse strikes, Pinocchio will turn back into a puppet. The Blue Fairy says it's impossible to know for sure. Gepetto asks to give Pinocchio one of the two safe spots in the wardrobe. Jiminy tells Gepetto he can't bargain with the fate of the whole kingdom. Gepetto says Pinocchio goes into the wardrobe or no one does. He tells the Blue Fairy to tell the prince and Snow White there is only enough magic in the tree to protect one person.

At the round table, the Blue Fairy explains the magic of the tree. Gepetto confirms he can build it. She includes the one caveat, the tree can protect only one and a choice must be made.

In Storybrooke, August is taking Emma on a trip to tell her his story. And they leave Storybrooke.

David and Regina wrap up dinner, and David compliments Regina's lasagna by telling her ""you really know how to work some magic."" She and we get the irony, but he doesn't. Eventually, David asks Regina to tell him the story of how she found him. She remembers it being a cold night and it was late. She went back for her forgotten phone and saw David on the side of the road, unconscious. David thinks it's almost like the universe wanted her to find him. She moves in for a kiss, but David backs away and says ""this is great like it is.' He leaves. After David is gone, Regina angrily throws a glass at a mirror and shatters it.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow White is in labor and the wardrobe isn't yet finished. The curse is almost upon them, The Blue Fairy tells Gepetto that Pinocchio can't go into the wardrobe. After she leaves, Gepetto tells Pinocchio to get into the wardrobe. Pinocchio resists lying, but goes along with Gepetto's plan. Gepetto makes Pinocchio promise in 28 years he will make sure the savior believes. Pinocchio gets in. Gepetto tells him, ""You will find me again, and on that day I will look at you with pride. You will be a great man, my son.""

Gepetto closes the doors, there is a rumble, and he opens the doors to find the wardrobe empty. He cries.

Outside Storybrooke, we see August driving Emma on his motorcycle. They arrive at a diner Emma recognizes. August says he was the 7-year-old boy who found Emma when she was a baby.

Pinocchio pops out of a tree in a forest, but it's clearly a different time when he sees a commercial airplane fly over him. He bumps the tree again and gets a jolt filled with flashbacks to his father and the moment he was sent away in the wardrobe. There is another jolt. Pinocchio finds a crying baby in a tree. He picks the baby up.

Outside Storybrooke, Emma tells August she's done listening to his story. But he tells her more details about the blanket she was wrapped in when he found her. He says he lied about where he found her in order to protect her. He tells her they both came into this world through the tree they're standing next to. He says the unfinished story from Henry's book, which he wrote, ends with her believing. She leaves and he gives chase, only until he falls over in pain. He explains he was in Phuket, Thailand, a beautiful place, when Emma decided to stay in Storybrooke. She asks how he knows when she decided to stay and he says he woke up at 8:15 in the morning with a shooting pain in his leg. That's 8:15 p.m. in Storybrooke, and that's when time started to move forward again in the town. He says he was supposed to be there for her and he wasn't, which was why he needed a painful reminder.

He tries to show her his wooden leg, but she can't see it. She only sees a leg. He says her denial is worse than he thought, but she says she doesn't want the fate of everyone in the town on her shoulders. She only wants Henry. He tells her she's everyone's ""only hope.""

""Then you're all screwed,"" she says before walking away.

In a flashback, we see Pinochhio making funny faces in a foster home to stop Baby Emma's crying. Another kid shows Pinocchio a wad of cash he found in a sock drawer in the house and says it's enough to buy them all bus tickets out of town. Pinocchio wants to bring Emma, but can't. He decides to go away, leaving Emma behind.

In Storybrooke, August walks up and sees the man he knows is his father working on the coo-coo clock. He gives him a tip on how to make it work and the man tries it with success. He flashes a smile and asks, ""Who taught you that?""

August says, ""My father.""

The man says August's father must be very proud. August says he doesn't think he turned out to be the man his father wanted him to be. August says he had a chance to fulfill a promise but by the time he got around to it, it might have been too late. The older man says if he had a son, he'd be proud as long as he tried to follow through and correct his mistake. August asks the man if he'd be willing to take on an assistant, and the man says he can't pay him.

""I just feel like fixing things,"" August says. The man invites him into the garage.

Henry wakes up that night to a ""code red"" on the walkie talkie from Emma. She says she needs to talk to him about them. He goes outside to talk. Emma asks if he wants to get away from Regina and live with Emma.

""More than anything,"" he says.

She tells him to buckle up because they're leaving Storybrooke. And she drives off."

Meanwhile, just as Emma and Henry reached the town limits, Henry grabs the steering wheel and stops the car, telling Emma that her ""family"" needs her in Storybrooke.

In Fairy Tale Land, Prince James faces the kind and tells that losing his life for love is ""a sacrifice that I am happy to make.""

""As you wish,"" the king tells him before the knights walk him over to the guillotine and prepare to off his head. Just as the blade drops, it turns into water and in walks Regina. She wants the man the king pretends is his son and offer to pay any riches King Midas had promised for him. She wants to use the prince to get to Snow White.

In Storybrooke, Regina is upset that her apple tree is dying. She immediately goes to Mr. Gold for answers. She thinks the curse is weakening because of Emma. He mentions that Emma wants Henry and that the curse was meant to take away Snow White and Prince Charming's happiness. Giving up Henry might be the cost of keeping the curse intact. He reminds Regina, also, that the curse will be broken if she kills Emma. She wants Regina to undo the curse, but he says he couldn't even if he wanted to. She thinks he wants the curse broken and wants to know why. Mr. Gold doesn't want to discuss it. Regina wants a new deal but Mr. Gold isn't interested. She offers ""anything."" He tells her she no longer has anything he wants. He warns her that once people wake up and remember who she is and what she did to them, ""they are going to be looking for blood.""

Regina sticks a ""white rabbit"" card on Paige's bike at school.

Emma gets back home and Mary Margaret is annoyed that she'd left so abruptly. Emma apologizes and says she doesn't want to be sheriff and relying on her. She also admits that she took Henry with her. Mary Margaret tells Emma she's reverting into the person she was before she came to town. Mary Margaret tells Emma to figure out what to do with Henry.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow White is planning her move to rescue the prince and Red brings news that the Queen is there, too. Snow is going on with the plan anyway, knowing that the Queen is trying to destroy her happiness.

Inside the castle, the Queen tells the prince she has a ""satisfying brand of punishment"" for Snow. She walks away, showing off an apple.

In Storybrooke, Regina meets with Jefferson, the Mad Hatter, and he acknowledges he got the ""message"" (the white rabbit card). She tells him she wants his help. He's none too pleased to see Regina, but she says she has a way for them to both get what they want. She shows him a hat box, which he opens. She wants him to use it again, but he says he can't make it work. She says she has some magic -- ""hopefully enough for one last journey."" She says the solution of how get rid of Emma lies back in their home land. Jefferson tells Regina that if he helps, he wants her to write him and Paige a new story, a new life in Storybrooke. She says he can have that ""after we take care of Miss Swan.""

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow gives the signal to launch the move toward the castle. They move in and Snow starts tearing up on some knights -- with a little help from Grumpy and the rest of the dwarves. Soon, they're trapped, but a swarm of fairies -- led by the Blue Fairy -- come by and knock the knights out with fairy dust.

Henry goes to August, who apologizes for having failed. August shows Henry his arm, which has now turned to wood. August explains he's changing back because he hasn't ""been a good boy."" August explains that Emma can't see his wooden appendages because she doesn't want to believe. August says he wants to spend what little time he has left with his father, Marco (in Fairy Tale Land). August tells Henry he's out of Operation: Cobra.

Emma talks to Dr. Hopper for advice, but he thinks Emma would have a difficult time making a case for custody. He tells Emma ""this war has to end.""

In the castle, Snow finds Charming locked up and makes her into his cell. But he isn't really there. He's just a mirage. The Queen took him to her palace and Snow is only seeing him through the Queen's mirror. The Queen shows up and tells Snow she wants to talk, and tells her they should meet ""where it all began."" Snow prepares for the parlay and heads off despite the dwarves' and Red's protests.

Regina leads Jefferson to the room where she keeps her magic. He puts the hat down but it doesn't spin. She gives the hat some magic, but it isn't enough. Jefferson needs ""something that still works,"" and Regina looks at her ring from Daniel. It glows with magic and she reluctantly gives it up. The hat immediately begins to spin but not enough to open a portal. Jefferson says there might be enough magic to reach to the other side and retrieve. Regina has an idea. He tells her to ""guide the hat"" to the time and place where the thing exists. She tells him they're after an apple.

In Fairy Tale Land, Snow shows up for the parlay at the barn and reminds Snow about when she ran down Snow's runaway horse and saved her life. Regina takes Snow to Daniel's grave. She tells Snow that Daniel died because of Snow. She reminds Snow of how she promised to keep her secret and that's why Daniel was killed. The Queen presents Snow with an apple that would turn Snow's own body into a tomb in which she'll live with nothing but her own regrets. She has to eat it willingly. But if she doesn't, the prince dies. Snow congratulates the Queen for winning and eats the apple. Snow crumbles to the ground while the prince wakes up in his cell shouting because he knows the Queen has done something to Snow.

The apple rolls out of Snow's limp hand and down the hill, where it falls through a hole and Jefferson catches it in Storybrooke. Regina now has what she needs and has to figure out how to get the savior to taste her ""forbidden fruit."" We next see Regina whipping up some delicious-looking, apple-based pastry.

Just then, Emma shows up and wants to talk to Regina. She goes inside and tells Regina that ""whatever"" is between them needs to end. Emma tells Regina she's leaving town, but she wants to be able to visit and spend time with Henry. They head to the kitchen and Regina gives Emma her famous turnover."" Emma looks suspicious at first, but takes it.

In Fairy Tale Land, the dwarves and Red find Snow laying lifeless on the hill. Red realizes Snow ""sacrificed herself for true love."" The Queen is watching all this, and still has the prince in his cell.

In Storybrooke, Regina boastfully visits Mr. Gold and tells him she came up with a solution by having made magic from magic. She tells Mr. Gold that he's going to be staying there, right where he belongs. She tells him that whatever there reason was he wanted the curse to be broken is ""never going to happen.""

Henry visits Emma as she's preparing to leave. He tries to stop her from leaving and tells her she's ""just scared,"" which happens to all heroes right before they fight back, he adds. She tells him he can't believe in curses. Henry tells Emma that Regina wants her dead because Emma is the only one who can stop her. Henry sees the turnover and tells Emma she can't eat it because it's poison. He takes the turnover and eats it to prove the curse is real. She is about to give him ice cream when he collapses."

Lionel berates him for being scared; as a Luthor he is meant to lead.

In Smallville town, Martha (Annette OToole) and Jonathan (John Schneider) Kent enter Nell's Florists, where 3 year old Lana Lang is dressed up as a fairy. She offers Martha a wish. Later in the truck, Jonathan returns with supplies finding Martha in contemplative mood and Jonathan tells her he knows what she wished for.

While Lionel deals with business, Lex wanders off into cornfield and gets spooked by a voice calling for help: then, just when he finds Jeremy Creek (Justin Chatwin) hanging as a scarecrow in field, he and Jeremy are engulfed in a dust cloud thrown up by a meteor that lands nearby. After this first meteorite lands, a volley of meteorites hit the town and the surrounding farmland.

Jonathan and Martha are returning home, driving past the Welcome to Smallville sign when it gets hit, they enter a dust cloud and their truck overturns.

Lionel searches the flattened cornfield for Lex and finds him hidden under a pile of stalks, traumatised and bald;his ginger hair is scattered around him.

Jonathan and Martha awaken hanging by their seatbelts in their upturned truck and open their eyes to find a naked 4 year old boy squatting down to look at them through the window. Having collected the boy they climb out of the crater they find themselves in, with Martha carrying him wrapped in a blanket. Martha, desperate for a child, wants to keep him, and Jonathan tells her they need to find his parents. Martha asks where he came from and Jonathan answers, ""Kids don't just drop from the sky"". They spot a spaceship in the crater from the ridge and Martha says he's, ""Not from Kansas, that's for sure"". Jonathan replies, ""We can't tell people we found him in a cornfield"" to which Martha responds, ""We didn't. He found us"".

TODAY Clark (Tom Welling) is fretting over asking his father to sign his permission slip (We see on the slip that Kent farm is on Hickory Lane) for him to join High School football team. Trials are to be held that afternoon. Jonathan concerned that Clark could injure someone during the game and refuses to sign. Clark had hoped he could 'go through High School not a total loser!'

Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) are on school bus which has stopped to pick up Clark, but he's not there. As the bus pulls away,Clark overhears Pete say to Chloe that if Clark moved any slower he'd be extinct. Clark surprises Chloe and Pete arriving minutes after them and tells them he used a shortcut. Chloe is not convinced. Clark spots Lana and leaves them. They have a bet on how close Clark can get, with Pete betting 10 feet and Chloe 5, and then they count down as he gets closer and falls at her feet. She celebrates by saying, ""Its official, Clark Kent cannot get within 5 feet of Lana Lang without turning into a total freak show!""

Clark ends up face down on the floor in front of Lana, dropping his books. He feels ill and rests against rail. Whitney (Eric Johnson), her boyfriend and captain of the Crows High School football team, arrives and after talking to Lana picks up a book Clark missed and tosses it to him, making Clark drop all the books he's holding, and he slides to the floor.

Jeremy Creek breaks the glass on Trophy display case and removes a photo of the group who strung him up as the scarecrow 12 years ago.

Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) drives his Porsche into grounds of LuthorCorp facility in Smallville and parks outside building. He says, ""Thanks, Dad"" as he gets out of car and heads for entrance. He has just been made manager of the facility.

Pete is at trials, having handed in his permission slip. He is disappointed that Clark didn't keep to their arrangement. Clark is in stands watching.

Clark is next seen standing at safety rail on bridge, staring down at the water, possibly considering suicide.

Lex, driving fast, comes to bridge and hits a pole dropped from a lorry that passed a while ago. He swerves and catapults off the bridge into the water, aware that he hit someone on the bridge. The car sinks like a stone, filling with water as it does so, too fast for Lex to escape.

Clark is thrown into the water by the impact and seeing drivers desperate situation dives to save him. By peeling back roof he's able to haul the driver out and drags him to the bank where he performs CPR, entreating the unconscious driver to respond. When Lex recovers they introduce themselves to each other. Lex says, ""Swore I hit you"". Clark answers, ""If you did then I would be dead"". Clark seems shaken by the realisation. They vow to be friends. Jonathan arrives to collect Clark, notified by emergency services in attendance, demanding to know who the maniac was that was driving the car. Lex stands up, admitting it was him and introducing himself. No lover of the Luthors, Jonathan tells him to drive slower as a parting shot.

Clark has telescope aimed at Lana's bedroom and witnesses Whitney arrive. She tells Whitney that Nell is at the Luthors and that Clark saved Lex's life. Clark sees her give him pendant to wear at forthcoming game on Saturday and that he can return it afterwards. He tells her a scout from Kansas State will be there.

In a car workshop the owner is visited by Jeremy Creek, who he was responsible for stringing up as the scarecrow 12 years ago, when the meteor strike occurred. Jeremy touches him and is surrounded by a blue lightning charge and the owner collapses.

Clark sees a red truck outside the farmhouse and asks Martha about it. She hands him a card and he reads the message, 'From the maniac in the Porsche'. Clark asks her where the keys are and she tells him, ""Your father has them"". He finds Jonathan in barn and asks for keys, but Jonathan refuses, telling him he cannot keep the truck. He can't accept the gift just because he saved the man's life. Desperate, Clark suggests that his father drives the new red one and Clark takes the old blue one. Jonathan will not be persuaded. The conversation turns to keeping things normal. Clark walks over to shredder and shouts, ""Is this normal?"" as he switches it on and sticks his right arm into it. Jonathan dashes over and attempts to force Clark to remove his arm from the machine. With the machine switched off, Clark shows him a tattered sleeve but his arm is unmarked. ""Lexs car hit me at 60 mph. Is that normal? I'd give anything to be normal.""

Jonathan decides it's time to tell Clark the truth about his origins and together with Martha they explain what happened 12 years ago. ""You were adopted. Your parents were not from around here."" Clark guesses they were from another State. Jonathan tells him a bit further away and looks up at the sky. ""You're telling me I'm from another planet?"" Clark asks incredulously. ""And I suppose you have my spaceship stashed in the attic."" Martha responds, matter of factly, ""No, in the storm cellar"". Unwrapping a solid rectangular, polished silver metal block with strange symbols around the edges, Jonathan tells him that it's in a language unknown on Earth. Jonathan then shows him spacecraft. Clark now very angry, says, ""You should have told me sooner"", and races off at superspeed.

Now dark, Clark is hiding out in the graveyard and stumbles across Lana crouching at parents graveside, talking to them. He asks if she remembers them and she tells him she was only three. She introduces Clark to her parents then appears to be listening to them as they ask a question. She tells Clark her mother asks if he's upset about a girl. Clark says no. After she cocks her head she tells him her father asks if it's about a guy. Clark looks shocked and Lana says her father has a wicked sense of humour. They talk for a few minutes and Lana confesses that she feels alone without them. Clark reciprocates, saying, ""Whats that Mrs Lang? Ok, I'll tell her. Your Mom wants me to tell you that you are never alone, she is always watching over you.""

Clark walks Lana home and she gives him a kiss on the cheek before they part. Whitney is waiting for her and witnesses it: obviously furious.

At Luthor Mansion, Clark finds Lex in room with dust covers over furniture in a fencing session. As he enters Lex launches the epee into the air and it lands inches from Clark's head, embedding the tip in the wall. As Lex comes over to retrieve it he notices Clark. Clark tells him he's returning the truck as his father will not let him keep it. The session ended, Lex asks Clark if he believes a man can fly. Clark says only in a plane. He tells Clark that when his heart stopped he flew over Smallville. Lex suddenly looks puzzled and asks how he got through gates and Clark says he squeezed through. Before Clark leaves, Lex says that he knows that Jonathan doesn't like him and believes that an apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He asks Clark, ""What about you, Clark?"" Clark answers, ""I'm adopted"".

Clark goes to visit Chloe at Torch with Pete. Chloe asks them if they can keep a secret. Clark says he's the Fort Knox of secrets. She tells them of something she's been working on and then shows them a wall covered in newspaper clippings of strange occurrences in Smallville since the meteor shower. She says she calls it her 'Wall of Weird' and that it started as a scrapbook but expanded out of control. As Clark scans the articles he spots a little girl, obviously terrified, and realises it's Lana at age three. He realises that the meteor shower and other strange things that have happened in Smallville are connected to his spacecraft landing 12 years ago. Guilt ridden he states to himself, ""It's all my fault"".

Whitney corners Clark at High School. ""Congratulations, Clark. You're this years Scarecrow."" Clark warns him, ""Not now"", but Whitney ignores him so Clark takes a swing at him but Whitney easily catches his fist. Clark feels weak and realises Whitney is wearing Lana's necklace. Whitney pulls off the necklace and places it around Clarks neck telling him it will be the closest he gets to Lana. Strung up on a cross, in the middle of cornfield in his shorts, in the dark and with a red S painted on his chest, a shivering Clark seems to have no hope of rescue. Jeremy passes by on his way to Smallville High, ignoring Clarks plea to get him down, indicating his intention to wreak his vengeance on the current pupils by telling Clark he's safer where he is. Lex appears out of nowhere and immediately unties him. Clark falls to the ground, but in doing so the necklace breaks and he's able to function again. He grabs his clothes, thanks Lex and dashes off before Lex completes his offer of a lift. Arriving at school he discovers Jeremy outside and tells him its his fault that Jeremys like he is and to stop what he intends to do. Jeremy touches Clark and electricity sizzles around them but Clark is unharmed. Jeremy gets into truck and rams Clark, the hood of the truck bends in around Clark with the impact and Clark holds on as Jeremy then drives straight at a wall. A water pipe bursts and the truck cab fills with water. As Jeremy tries to dislodge Clark by using a bolt of electricity, it throws Clark clear. As Clark opens door and water gushes out, Jeremy looks at him and asks where he is.

The Home coming dance is well underway; Lana and Whitney have been crowned Homecoming King and Queen and are dancing. Pete and Chloe have attended together, all are oblivious to the danger that Clark averted.

Alone in his barn Clark looks through telescope and imagines him and Lana dancing on her porch, only for the sound of car horn to interrupt him and he sees Lana climb the few steps to her porch having been brought home by Whitney. Sotto voce he says, ""Thank you for the dance, Lana"". She stops and turns around, as if hearing him and searching for the source."

Episode 2 Metamorphosis

Outside Nell's house someone is in a tree, watching Lana (Kristen Kreuk) through her bedroom window as she drops her wrist corsage into a drawer. Lana discovers a square gift box tied with thin blue ribbon on her bed and opens it; multi-coloured butterflies fill her room to her delight. Her watcher records her reaction on a camcorder, and, satisfied she liked her present, walks away, getting into his VW Beetle to drive home.

Greg Arkin (Chad Donella) spotty and bespectacled face peers around the front door of his home to find his mother, Mrs Arkin, (Gabrielle Rose) viewing recordings he made of Lana and Whitney together. She greets him with, 'Is this what you do with your time now, Greg?' He asks her where she got them from and she tells him from that hole he calls a room. He's indignant and says she had no right. She suggests he has a lot of nerve talking about privacy. She is disgusted, reminding him that she is in the gardening club with Nell and asks how she can face Lana's aunt when she knows her son is creeping around video-taping her niece. She asks him where he's been that evening and he says collecting. She then rants about both disgusting habits, telling him she's had it with his behaviour and threatens, 'I'll be calling Claremont Military Academy first thing Monday morning'. Greg shouts, 'Hey, whos gonna take care of my bugs?'He decides to leave and picking up his favourites, brilliant green flying insects in a glass jar, he shakes it promising he will take them somewhere safe. With his collection in the car he speeds off and when he hits a large bump in the road he swerves before regaining control. This tips the jar onto the floor smashing it; causing the insects to swarm angrily and they attack him. He swats them as they bite/sting and loses control, crashing into a tree; an eerie green light shines through windscreen and hes heard screaming, 'No! No!' The following morning, a fly crawls over the shattered remains of his glasses as his Mom knocks on his bedroom door. She opens the door but is puzzled to find his room is empty. What she fails to see is Greg, stuck to the ceiling, facing downwards as he watches her.

Zooming over Smallville in the dark Clark (Tom Welling) floats into Lana's bedroom and hovers over her bed, with Lana (Kristen Kruek) fast asleep below him. She opens her eyes and tells him, 'It's all your fault, Clark,' then closes her eyes again. Clark hears his mother calling him to get up, reminding him that he hasn't done his chores and they have fifteen minutes before they are due at the Farmers Market. As he loses his concentration he has a brief realisation that he is actually floating, before he falls onto his own bed which collapses; first at the foot and then, seconds later, the head end.

At the local fair, Clark, after checking no one is watching, pushes a nail in with his thumb to secure a sign on their stall, as he prepares it for their farm produce. Chloe (Allison Mack) spots Lana and Whitney (Eric Johnson) and calls out, 'All hail to the homecoming King and Queen!'. Whitney (Eric Johnson) walks over with Lana, who mentions that she didn't see Clark at the homecoming dance the previous night. He responds that he was a little tied up as he glances at Whitney. Lana catches the look on both their faces then Jonathan (John Schneider) praises Whitneys performance at the last game. Not wanting to be near Whitney, Clark says he's going to the truck to unload. After telling Jonathan he'll help, Whitney follows Clark. As he catches up with Clark he insinuates that last night was just a joke then insists he needs Lana's necklace back. Clark answers that he doesn't have it. When Whitney states it is Lana's favourite he tells Whitney with contempt that he had better go out to the cornfield and find it.

Lana is admiring a butterfly wind chime when Greg stands close behind her, saying how beautiful the chime is. She turns to face and him and comments that she didn't recognise him without his glasses, (his hair is slicked back and all the spots have gone too) and he tells her that butterflies live only eight hours. Lana jokes that they live fast and die young, the rock stars of the insect world. He asks her if she will help him with their Lit paper. She asks if it is giving him 'brainfreeze', agreeing to go to his house after school. Whitney comes over to tell Lana that her aunt is looking for her and stays to warn Greg off tailing his girlfriend, calling him 'Bugboy'. Greg asks if he's afraid of the competition. Whitney responds that they are not in competition but if he finds out Greg has been leaving butterflies in his girlfriends bedroom, Greg will know about it. After he's gone Greg says out loud to himself 'sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug'. As Clark watches Whitney and Lana kiss before Whitney drives off, Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) saunters over and tells Clark he can't knock his taste in women before he asks Clark what happened the night before. Clark dismisses it as a stupid prank, but Lex persists, reminding him that he was tied to a stake and left in a field; continuing that even the Romans saved that for special occasions and Clark could have died out there. Clark tells him he appreciates Lex's help but he just wants to forget the whole thing. Jonathan comes over and asks what the hold-up is. Lex extends his hand and Jonathan shakes it then leaves after reminding Clark that he needs to help finish up. Lex is pleased that he at least got a handshake this time. Lex takes a bite out of an apple he took as he watches Lana walk past. He throws the rest of the apple into the back of the truck.

Whitney is heading home listening to the radio in his truck when he feels something land of the roof. Greg has leapt from a tree as he passed below and begins pounding on roof until it buckles and the passenger window shatters, causing Whitney to lose control. The truck rolls on its side and skids along the highway, leaving Whitney trapped, unconscious, inside. Greg watches until he realises another truck is coming. By the time Martha, Jonathan and Clark see Whitney's car he's gone. Jonathan skids to a stop. While Jonathan frees his fire extinguisher, Clark rushes over and releases Whitney, just as leaking fuel ignites. Martha and Jonathan watch in horror as, on the other side of the truck Clark is engulfed in flame as Whitney's truck explodes. They find him huddled in the middle of the road, his jacket smoking. When Jonathan touches Clark's jacket, burning his hand, Clark raises his head and they realise he's sheltering Whitney. Whitney stirs.

Back at the farm, as Clark looks at his arm, Jonathan gives Clark an update on Whitney, who has a couple of cuts and bruises but nothing serious. Clark asks if he remembers anything, and Jonathan reassures him that all Whitney remembers is something smashed his truck then he woke up in the ambulance. Clark asks his Dad to have a word with his Mom as he really freaked her out. Jonathan tells him he also made her really proud. Clark then tells Jonathan about his experience that morning, finding himself floating above his bed and that when he woke up he crashed onto his bed. Jonathan repeats 'floating' and tells him, 'When you break the laws of gravity we're definitely in uncharted territory'. Clark asks what's happening to him. Jonathan tells him that as his father he should have all the answers, and it kills him that he doesn't, but he has to have faith and they will figure it out together. Clark responds, 'But this is happening to me and I'm scared!'

At the mansion, Lex stands in front of a window holding Lana's necklace up to the light. He then puts it inside a box and closes the lid.

Lana rides her horse across a field and into the stables. Lex is waiting for her and suggests that she might want to check the horse's shoes. He introduces himself and she says they have met. He says he would remember her so Lana recalls a day when she was ten, and was in Metropolis for a competition. She and Nell were invited by his father to stay with him, and after being told they had an indoor pool she went to check it out and found Lex and a girl skinny dipping, she recalls that she thinks Lex was teaching her the breast stroke. Lex remembers the incident and shows surprise then comments that she is all grown up now. Lex sees a display cabinet of her competition photos and trophies and spots a photo of her wearing her pendant and asks her where it is. She tells him she lent it to her boyfriend. He asks what her boyfriend's name is and after she tells him it's Whitney, he mentions that like Whitney he was saved by Clark. Lana tells him that she visited Whitney before the game to give him the necklace. She acknowledges it was lucky that Clark was there to save Lex. He says he knows the feeling then queries if she is with the wrong guy as one chucks footballs while the other saves lives. Lana is not impressed, saying that for someone new in town he has a lot of opinions. Lex suggests that while she is nursing her boyfriend back to health she should ask him what he was doing just before the big game. She says he was with her, but it has made her suspicious.

Greg's mother enters her house to find the temperature is 103 degrees Farenheit. She heads upstairs to his bedroom and finds his room is covered in cobwebs and cocoons. He stands in front of her bare-chested, his hair wet and slicked back. She asks what the hell has gotten into him. He replies 'about 2 million years of intelligence and instinct'. She insists he stops it right now. He tells her its too late for that; that nature will take its course: first he will eat then he will moult and then he'll mate. She tries to pass him and he puts his hand across the door-way to block it. He goes on to tell her about the Pharaoh spider that kills its mother and eats her. He turns his back on her, moves his head from side to side then turns round and opens his mouth wide.

At the mansion, Lex finds Clark admiring his war-games layout and asks him if he saved any lives on the way over. Clark smiles as he turns round to face him and Lex continues that he could make a career of it. Clark apologises that his parents gave Lex a hard time, and he jokes that if push came to shove he would have arm wrestled them for it. Clark asks if he is planning an invasion and Lex says his father gave it to him when he was nine. Clark thinks its a cool gift. Lex tells him that it wasn't a gift, it was a strategy tool. He tells him that the battle of Troy started because two men were in love with the same woman, a little like him and the Quarterback, and that's why he strung Clark up in the field. Clark feels the war is already lost. Lex says this is only one battle and that Lana is not as infatuated as he may think. Clark reminds Lex that Whitney is the Captain of the football team and the whole town treats him like a god, game over. Lex suggests that if Clark hadn't pulled him out of the truck all his problems would have been solved. Before Clark comments, he tells him he is kidding and tells Clark he has a Trojan horse for him and picks up a small black box and opens it. Clark immediately feels ill and backs away slightly, but not before he's seen Lanas necklace inside. Lex is concerned and asks if he is ok. Clark assures him he's fine. Lex closes the box and moves towards Clark. To change the subject Clark comments that it's a cool box and asks what it made of. Lex tells him the legend of the box; that it is rumoured to be made from the armour of St George, the patron saint of boy scouts, and that his mother bought it in a casbah in Morocco and gave it to him before she died. Lex offers it to Clark but Clark refuses to take it. Lex asks him pointedly what it is about the Kents and gifts. Lex holds it out to Clark, and as Clark reluctantly takes,it. he tells him to give it to Lana and tell her what happened. When she opens it she will love Clark for it. With the necklace he will hold the power and all he has to do is use it.

In the corridor at school Lana challenges Whitney over where he was before the game on Saturday. He asks if they can talk about it later, but Lana insists that it's a simple question. He says he was training. Scornfully she asks, 'So you didn't grab Clark and hang him up in a field?' He defends himself by saying it was a prank. She demands her necklace back. He is forced to admit he lost it. She asks if he was planning on telling her or if that was a prank too. As she storms away, Greg intercepts her and reminds her he's been waiting for an hour for her to help with the English paper as she promised. She apologises and tells him that something really important came up and that she will do it another time. He accuses her of blowing him off for her boyfriend. She says she has to see Clark. He accuses her of wanting to spend time with Clark, and that he is more important to her than Greg is. She apologises and says she cannot talk about it right now as she has to go. She walks away.

Clark has taken the box out to school field and opens it experimentally. With his hand so near he can feel the effect, his skin taking on a green tinge as it swells and subsides like something moving under it. He shuts the box and it stops instantly. He returns home and finds Lana looking through his telescope in his loft, but instead of giving the box to her he quickly conceals it under a piece of material then continues up the stairs. When she praises his loft he confides his father built it for him and calls it his 'Fortress of Solitude'. She is standing by the telescope when she asks if he knew he could see her house from his loft. He feigns ignorance by being surprised, and subtly moves its position. He states that they only live a mile apart but she has never come over. She guesses that he wants to know why she's come over now. He tells that it's not that he doesn't enjoy her company but yes. She says she's found out about the whole 'scarecrow' thing and she's come to apologise on behalf of Whitney. He tells her, 'Theres no need, it wasn't your fault'. She then says that, 'Lex dropped the breadcrumbs and I followed the trail'. She explains that shes lost her favourite necklace and that her aunt Nell had it made for her from the meteorite that killed her parents. Nell gave it to her on the day that she officially adopted Lana. Clark has perfect opportunity to return necklace but shoves the box in drawer.

Greg's in the shower and sloughing off large lumps of skin into shower tray.

That night Jonathan and Clark are in the barn when Clark hears a noise like insects chirruping before he is attacked by something. When Jonathan goes up into rafters to look, he gets pushed and falls; heading straight down onto the sharp blades of the thresher they were re-assembling. Clark breaks his fall by leaning backwards over the blades, taking the full brunt of Jonathans landing. As Jonathan, then Clark stand up, Jonathan surveys the bent blades and asks, 'What just happened?' They discuss what could have attacked them and Jonathan says, 'Kids don't leap off ceilings and attack people'. Clark focuses torch on ceiling and they see green goo attached to underside of roof. 'Then how do you explain that?' He then tells his father about Chloe's 'Wall of Weird'. Jonathan responds, 'This is as out-there as it gets'. Martha joins in with, 'This coming from a man who's had a spacecraft in his cellar for 12 years'. When Clarks suggests that this has something to do with the meteor shower and he's to blame, Jonathan tells Clark that this probably has more to do with the Luthor fertiliser factory pumping out poisons for past 12 years. He goes on, saying that Clark is not responsible for meteor shower as he had no control over it. Clark asks how he can make the feeling go away and is told by Jonathan that he can't, and that's what makes him human.

Chloe, Pete (Sam Jones III) and Clark meet up and Clark tells them about the attack and that he and Pete should go to Greg's. Chloe, feeling left out says, 'I hate it when you do that'. Clark asks, 'What?' 'Shut me out like that, like you've outgrown me'. Clark jokes, 'I'll never outgrow you other than vertically'. Pete then tells Chloe about when he and Clark were kids and went to Greg's to play in the tree house Greg's father built, and that Clark would not go into it as he was scared of heights. Clarks denies it, saying he didn't think it was structurally sound. All three arrive outside Greg's house and look through window but see no sign of life. They gain entry through an open window and find remains of Greg's mother upstairs, cocooned in spider silk. They realise that having fed, Greg is following spider behaviour and will soon mate and his target is Lana.

Greg finds Lana with Whitney in stables at Nell's. Greg sends Whitney sailing through the air. He hits the rear wall of stall and is out cold. Greg kidnaps Lana, taking her to tree house. Clark arrives at stables just as Whitney emerges from stall. He guesses where Greg would take Lana and gives Whitney instructions to find tree house. Whitney takes his eyes off Clark to start the car, telling him he'll drive. With head down Whitney apologises to Clark for the scarecrow incident but when he looks up Clark is nowhere to be seen.

Reaching the tree house Clark climbs up, finding Lana cocooned and Greg waiting for him. They fight and fall to the ground, Greg then leading the way to an abandoned warehouse nearby. Clark feels the now familiar weakness and pain associated with being in close proximity to meteor rocks and is unable to fight Greg, being tossed about like a rag doll, ending up inside what seemed to be the remains of a container. Greg taunts him, saying, 'You haven't changed since we played around here as kids. You still get sick'. Clark suddenly finds his strength return and realises the walls must be made of lead and are protecting him. Greg swoops in and Clark sends him hurtling back out to land next to a chain. In an effort to get up Greg grabs the chain, Clark yells, 'No, Greg!' as he pulls a large scoop down on top of himself and gets crushed. Hundreds of black spiders come scuttling out from under and around the scoop and scatter. Clark returns to tree house but Whitney has rescued Lana from cocoon, much to Clark's dismay.

Under cover of darkness, Clark approaches Nell's front door and prepares to open the box. Hesitantly he lifts out the pendant, his hand showing the effects. Lana, having heard something, calls out, 'Whitney?' before opening the door. She steps out onto porch and looks around but seeing nothing turns to go back in and spots the pendant swinging from the handle. She smiles as she removes it and goes indoors. Clark watches from the cover of Hickory Lane, then turns and starts walking home."

Reporter Roger Nixon steals Clark's spacecraft and learns his secret. Whitney joins the Marines, and Clark takes Chloe to the prom, while a huge tornado approaches.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Greg Beeman'],"['', '', '']",[],"['cameo', 'spacecraft', 'reporter', 'prom', 'exploding car', 'car bomb', 'detonator', 'tornado']",[],"Lexis waiting at the helipad for his father to arrive. Lionel hasn't told Lex the purpose of the visit, but Lex has gathered all the plant employees together for him. Lionel claims that it will be a motivational speech, but then he proceeds to announce that the plant will be closed due to management problems beyond their control. Lex is furious. This is obviously another attempt to get Lex out of Smallville and back in Metropolis, where Lionel can keep an eye on him.

At school, Clark is trying to get advice from Pete about his tie and cummerbund. He tells Lana that he's planning to ask Lex if he can borrow his limo. Chloe arrives with the news that they are closing the LuthorCorp Plant. Clark tells his parents the news, but they have already heard about it since the Smallville Ledger rushed a special edition (for the first time since the 1989 meteor shower). They argue about why this happened and who is to blame.

Whitney takes Lana to a surprise picnic. He's prepared this special setting to tell her that he's enlisted in the Marine Corps. He says the only thing he'll miss in Smallville is Lana and asks Lana if she will wait for him. She doesn't know how to answer.

Clark goes to the Luthor Mansion and sees the missing piece of his ship on Lex's desk. Lex is upset that Lionel blamed the closing of the plant on him. When Clark realizes how busy Lex is, he leaves without asking to borrow the limo. Lex stashes the key in a little box.

Clark meets up with Chloe at the Torch office. Chloe tells Clark that her dad is talking about moving back to Metropolis. She and Clark are both upset at the prospect.

That evening at the Talon, Clark tells Lana that Chloe might be leaving for good. Lana informs Clark that Whitney has joined the Marines. They speculate what it might be like for them when both Chloe and Whitney are out of their lives.

Lex calls a meeting with the plant's senior management and announces he has a plan to orchestrate an employee buyout.

The next day, Clark is driving fence posts into the ground. When he gets back in the truck and turns the key, the truck explodes. Clark steps out bewildered but unharmed, and it is revealed that Roger Nixon has been filming the entire scene. Jonathan speculates that the explosion was caused by a leaking fuel line, perhaps igniting the fertilizer in the back of the truck. Clark confides that he almost didn't feel the heat and the debris didn't leave any bruises. Martha speculates that he's getting stronger as he gets older.

Lex is reviewing an email message when his father walks in asking why he hasn't started packing. Lex admits that he is forcing a vote of the board of directors to accept the buyout. Lionel laughs at the idea that Lex and all of the employees are willing to risk everything they have. Confident that they will fail, Lionel also casually mentions that he has purchased Smallville Savings and Loan and will not hesitate to close out the employees' mortgages when they start missing payments.

Clark tells Chloe about the truck and she agrees to drive him to the dance. They talk about Whitney's imminent departure. Chloe speculates that Whitney and Lana will break up, and when she moves away, Clark will be free to pursue Lana. Clark is unnerved by her attitude and Chloe admits that she is scared Clark will forget all about her to be with Lana and leave her at the gym all alone. Clark reassures Chloe that he is not asking her to the dance by default but because he really wants to be with her. He gives her a kiss just as Lana walks by.

At the Talon, Roger Nixon asks Clark if he is willing to do an interview and asks why Clark wasn't hurt in the explosion. Lex arrives and shoos him away. Lex warns Clark to stay away from Nixon. When Clark gets home he tells his parents about the journalist, saying he is sure Nixon blew up the truck. Then he tells his parents that he saw the missing piece of the ship on Lex's desk.

Roger Nixon has bugged the Kent's house and is out in his car listening to the entire conversation. He also learns that the ship is in the storm cellar. Roger goes to the mansion and steals the key. He then promises to show Lex all the proof he needs tonight. Lex arrives at the Kent Farm and finds Clark in his loft trying to tie his bow tie. He assures Clark that whatever happens in the next few days, Lex is still his friend and that is never going to change.

Whitney and Lana wander into the empty school gym before the dance, where all the decorations are ready. Whitney puts on some music and asks Lana to dance. He tries to talk to her about their relationship, but Lana doesn't want to talk, so they just dance.

Chloe arrives to pick Clark up and they exchange flowers. They notice that a storm is moving in; the wind has grown even stronger by the time they arrive at the school. As they arrive, Lana and Whitney are leaving on their way to the bus station. Clark says goodbye to Whitney and Whitney apologizes for tying Clark up in the cornfield. He asks Clark to look after Lana until he gets back.

At the bus station, Lana gives Whitney her meteorite necklace for luck. Whitney promises not to lose it this time. He promises that he will still love her when he sees her again.

Roger Nixon goes into the Kents' storm cellar. When he takes the key out of his pocket, it floats away from him and fits itself into the ship. The Kents enter the storm cellar to get in away from the storm and find Nixon there. Jonathan guesses that Nixon is the journalist that Clark told him about and is about to beat him up. Martha is trying to stop him when she notices that the ship is floating and glowing. With Jonathan's attention diverted, Roger runs out into the storm and Jonathan goes after him.

At the Spring Formal, Remy Zero is performing ""Save Me"". When they switch to a slow song, Clark asks Chloe to dance. Clark requested the song because it's one of Chloe's favorites. As they are dancing, Chloe says how surprised she is that Clark came through for her tonight, since every other attempt that Clark has made to date anyone has been ruined when he rushes off to save someone. Just as they are about to kiss, the assistant principal interrupts to announce that the National Weather Service has issued a tornado warning. Three funnels have been spotted south of town, and no one will be allowed to leave the gym. Clark knows that the bus station and Lana are south of town. Chloe agrees to call Lana, but Clark zooms away as soon as her back is turned.

Lex realizes the key is missing and guesses that it was Roger who took it. Lionel arrives to announce that he has discovered that Lex is using his mother's stock to fund the buyout. He tries to tell Lex that it won't work, but Lex is determined to get free from his father. Lionel vows to bury Lex and everyone who takes Lex's side. Just then, the storm blows out a window, sending Lionel to the floor and Lex across the room. A bookcase falls on Lex, cutting his eye. A column falls on Lionel, pinning him to the floor. Lex manages to get the bookcase off of himself, but when Lionel calls out for help, Lex seems to consider the possibility of leaving his father on the floor to die, then seems to regret his hesitation.

Lana is driving home from the bus stop when a large piece of debris hits the windshield. She swerves and puts the truck in a ditch. She gets out and sees three funnels coming straight for her. They come together to form one monstrous funnel as Lana gets back inside the truck and desperately tries to use her cell phone. She sees Clark arrive just as the funnel picks up the truck. Clark runs straight into the storm and disappears."

A male voiceover talks about finding ""that one person"" and wonders what happens when that person is taken away.

We see a gang leader of some kind walking through a subway car with his boys. He spots a disheveled homeless man and takes his bottle of booze. When he makes another move, the man quickly turns the tables and beats up all of them with minimal effort.

All the players from the subway incident end up at the police station. The homeless man speaks with a police officer named Carter. She asks about his background, assuming he is former military based on his fighting prowess. An attorney arrives and is able to make sure the homeless man is released. As soon as he leaves, another cop tells Carter the homeless guy's fingerprints match those found at the scene of several crime scenes in various parts of the world.

Outside the station, two men tell the homeless guy their employer would like to speak with him.

The homeless man (Reese) is brought to meet with a man calling himself Mr. Finch. Finch knows Reese used to work for the government and has been having doubts about what he's done. He knows Reese is suicidal and thinks what Reese needs is a purpose.

Finch and Reese stands on a busy New York City block and asks what he would do if he was able to stop crimes before they happen. Finch has ""a list"" of people about to be involved in terrible things -- murders, kidnappings -- either as victim or perpetrator. Once such woman is Diane Hanson. Finch knows he's involved and wants Reese to get involved and stop it from happening. Reese isn't interested.

We see Reese in a hotel room watching a news report about himself. He then drinks himself into unconsciousness and briefly dreams about Jessica, the woman he was with in the flashback. The phone rings. It is Finch, telling him what he needs is to know what it feels like to let somebody be killed when you could have helped. Reese's hand is tied to the bed and he hears the sound of someone being hurt across the hall. He bursts into the room only to find Finch sitting next to a recording. The recording was three years old, from when a woman was murdered for insurance. Finch says something about Reese being halfway across the world when Jessica was killed. Finch says unlike the government ,he'll never lie to Reese. Finch says he's offering the chance to be there for people the way he couldn't be for Jessica.

Finch takes Reese to his remote base of operation. Finch references how little Reese knows about him and says that isn't likely to change. We see Finch has been getting social security numbers of these persons of interest. He won't tell Reese how.

The woman in question is Diane Hanson, a highly successful assistant district attorney. Reese breaks into her home and grabs as much information as he can. He hacks her cell phone and points a wireless camera at her apartment.

Reese has narrowed the list of likely suspect to two: Wheeler, a former boyfriend and co-counselor and Pope, the man she's currently prosecuting for a gang-related murder. Reese thinks Pope's gang could be targeting her.

Hanson has a dispute with a detective witness when he strays from the testimony they had talked about. She meets with Pope alone and tells him she doesn't think he murdered the people. She asks if he is protecting somebody. He tells her ""these people"" are evil and she should leave it alone. Pope ends up grabbing her by the throat and warning her not to do anything. Reese thinks the people who framed Pope will be coming after Hanson and thinks Pope's brother Michael is the only person who will know who they are.

In another Reese flashback, he tells his woman he's already quit the service. They turn on the TV and see the planes crashing into the World Trace Center on 9/11.

Reese sees Wheeler find information about Michael.

Reese finds Michael, who runs away from him. Michael gets away, but not before Reese is able to plant his cell phone in Michael's backpack.

Reese pays a visit to his gang leader buddy from the opening, Anton O'Mara, when he goes to buy guns. Reese shoots everybody in the room (other than Anton) in the leg and takes the guns.

Michael is grabbed by guys threatening to kill him gang-style. Reese uses his newfound arsenal to take out the car and the guys. We see the men were cops.

Reese shows Finch they are up against dirty narcotics cops, who steal money and drugs and frame people like Pope for their crime. Finch tells him after 9/11, he helped the government design a secret system to eavesdrop on U.S. citizens. He ""taught"" it to separate information related to possible terrorism from other potential crime. But he built himself a backdoor to get at the rest of the information and all he is able to get is the social security number of the central figure. If the government were to ever learn he still has this access, he'll be shut out.

Carter learns ""a suit"" took out Anton's entire gang by himself.

Pope is stabbed to death in his cell. Hanson is called for a meeting in an out-of-the-way alley. Reese follows her and sees Hanson is actually in cahoots with the dirty cops, who are led by an officer Stills. Reese is captured while watching the meeting. Hanson tells them to take care of Reese and then do the same to Wheeler. She admits she was behind the killing of Pope.

Reese wakes up in the car driven by Fusco, who was on the stand earlier. He tells the Fusco he thinks that unlike Stills, he's only participating in these crimes out of loyalty. Reese says that is why he is going to let him live and they both laugh. Reese is going to be sticking around New York for a while and he wants to have a guy on the inside. Reese then sets off an explosive in the back of the car which flips it over. Reese gets out pulls the unconscious Fusco out of the car. After asking if he is wearing a vest, Reese shoots him three times in the back.

Reese tells Finch about Hanson being the ringleader.

Cut to Stills and one of his buddies at Wheeler's place. They are planning to kill Wheeler and frame an ex-con who they pull out of the trunk. Wheeler is with his kid but that doesn't seem to deter Stills's plan. Reese gets the jump on one of Stills's accomplices and puts a gun to his head. Wheeler and his young son get off the elevator. Stills allows them to leave. Reese wounds another of Stills's henchmen and appears to kill Stills, allowing the ex-con to leave.

Reese manages to have a recording of Hanson revealing her guilt played in open court.

Reese pops into Fusco's car and tells him nobody knows he is involved. Also he tells him Stills is in the trunk. He shot him with Fusco's gun. Reese instructs him to dump Stills's body in a remote body of water and says ""I'll be in touch.""

Finch tells Reese he has a decision to make. He say ""the world thinks we're both dead"" and ""you're not the only one whose lost someone."" He tells Reese if he stays, they will both end up dead eventually.

Carter busts one of Stills's guys who again references a guy in a suit being responsible. Reese -- who was watching this -- disappears into the crowd."

He talks to the older man about his affair and refers to his wife hiring two men to kill him. The two younger men standing in the rear of the elevator start exchanging looks as they realize that Reese is referencing them, then they react. Shots are fired, bones are heard to break as Reese takes them out, and then offers the older man some advice: ""Time to see a good divorce lawyer.""

The next day Reese calls Finch, who tells him the next case will be ""unusual.""

Carter arrives at the scene of the two men Reese killed in the opening scene.

Finch says the next case is 15-year old Theresa Whitaker. They are at a cemetery and Finch tells Reese that Theresa and her family were murdered two years ago.

Flashback three years to Finch talking to another man, Ingram (Brett Cullen), during the earlier stages developing his machine. Ingram acts as the ultra-private Finch's front in the project.

Theresa's father, a real estate developer, took the family on a weekend sail and supposedly killed them all. But only the father, mother and brother's bodies were found.

Reese tells Fusco to get him Theresa's file.

We see Reese watching old news coverage of the crime. He thinks it was a professional hit, but he can't explain why Theresa wouldn't have been killed. Reese's only lead is Deacon Paige, a kid she used to hang around with.

Finch meets with Theresa's aunt Elizabeth (Molly Price) under the guise of an insurance inquiry. She divorced Theresa's father's brother in part because he never recovered from the crime. She tells Finch they never had children but loved Theresa like a daughter.

Reese locates Deacon at a skate park. After knocking the kid's cell' 'phone out of his hand, he picks it up and holds onto to it while asking him about Theresa's whereabouts. Deacon says he doesn't know anything. Reese syncs with Deacon's cell phone and immediately afterward sees that he just sent a text to someone named ""T"" telling the person to bolt because ""NYPD is here."" Reese scans the area and spots Theresa (Valentina de Angelis) near an ATM. After a foot chase, she cuts him on the hand with a box-cutter as he tries to grab her and gives him the slip.

Reese discovers that for 17 years Finch has worked as a software engineer grunt at a company he secretly owns. He tells him Theresa is still alive and has been stealing people's account numbers and passwords from ATMs. Finch wants to look at her father Grant's finances.

Fusco connects Reese with a guy who is piped-in with the contract killing industry. Reese roughs him, and two of his friends up as Fusco from a distance looks on in amazement. Reese gets the name of a contract killer named Solnick.

Reese meets with Solnick (Michael Medeiros) in prison. Solnick says he wouldn't have killed the girl. Recently somebody on his block told him he thought he killed the girl and paid a price for the insult.

Finch thinks Solnick could be in danger if the people who hired him to kill Theresa's family found out he didn't finish the job. Grant was apparently an investor in a company named Landale.

At Landale Reese spots the missing uncle Derrick. Finch locates Theresa online and tells him where to find her.

At a laundromat Reese tries to assure Theresa he's there to protect her, but a contract assassin (Ritchie Coster) sneaks up from behind. The guy gets the best of Reese and throws him through the storefront window. But Reese recovers in time to shoot the guy just before he can kill Theresa. Reese takes off to catch Theresa and we see the other guy was wearing a bullet-resistant vest.

Reese takes Theresa to a hotel. She says she doesn't know who targeted her family and had never seen the guy from the laundromat before. She says that right before her father was killed he said it was Derrick's fault. Finch shows up to watch her.

Reese grabs Derrick and brings him to where his brother's family was killed. Landale is a front for dirty money and they killed Grant and his family when the deal went south. It turns out that the property has finally been fixed and is now worth 50 or 60 times what it was a few years ago. Since Theresa would be the legal heir, Landale wants her dead.

Finch talks to Theresa about Elizabeth.

We again flashback to Finch speaking with Ingram about what the machine was intended to do. The man is concerned that they aren't helping all of the other people.

The thug from the laundromat is waiting for Derrick when he gets home.

Reese tells Finch that the man who ordered the hit was Calhoun, Grant's business partner.

Derrick is killed when he won't give up any information about Theresa.

Reese sees Calhoun meeting with a councilman about the land. Calhoun assures him they will be able to break ground in less than a month.

Carter finds Derrick's body with a picture of Theresa in his mouth.

The assassin intercepts a call from Theresa to her aunt Elizabeth. She hangs up without uttering a word, but it is enough for the hit man to learn where she is. He sends Calhoun a text message saying that he has the girl in his sights. Reese rams into Calhoun's car and tells him to call off the hit. When he says it's too late Reese calls Finch and tells them they have to leave.

Finch and Theresa manage to elude the hit man long enough for Reese to arrive and save the day at the last possible second.

Reese calls Carter and says he wants to sit down face-to-face.

At a public park Carter finds only Theresa who tells her ""my friend said I could trust you."" Theresa is pretty mum about Reese and Finch. She is reunited with Elizabeth.

Reese returns to Finch's work to find he has left ""his day job."" Reese phones Finch who is exiting the lobby of the office building with his ""personal effects"" in a small cardboard box which he deposits in a trash can. Finch tells him he's not ready to trust him.

As Finch exits the building, he passes a bust of Ingram who we see has died in 2009."

Joey works as a doorman.

Reese watches Joey at work and sees him get a garbled text message. He leaves work early and heads to a bank, with Reese following. Joey puts on a mask as three other gun-toting men join him to rob the bank. While on the ground Reese stops an older security guard from going for his gun.

We flashback to 2006. Reese is back from the war and runs into Jessica.

Finch wants to give Joey to the cops. Reese wants to have the chance to look into it. Reese sees Joey give a woman a large sum of cash. Reese spots Joey getting out of a cab driven by what turns out to be another marine from his unit, a man named Willis.

Finch finds out Willis had just been at a bar owned by a former military man named Latimer. This appears to be the ringleader. Reese asks Finch to get him a backstory so he can meet Latimer and to eventually create an opening in the team.

At the bar Reese gives Latimer a story of hearing about him from a marine who was killed in action. Latimer doesn't seem sure and tells Reese there are no jobs available right now.

Finch plants a bunch of weapons in Willis's cab and has him arrested.

A cop from the robbery department tells Carter about finding Reese's fingerprints at the scene of the bank job. He shows her footage of the robbery, where they notice both that Reese helped the security guard and that the robbers are ex-military.

With Willis out of commission Latimer calls Reese and has him meet the team. They toss him in a van and drive him to a remote location. When they decide he's okay they give him a phone and tell him to wait for their call.

Reese doesn't think Joey is a cold-blooded killer, so the machine must think he's going to be a victim.

Joey meets his girlfriend at her job waiting tables. Clearly they're having some trouble in the relationship.

This flashes Reese back again to the meeting with Jessica. He implies he has a new job he can't talk about and she tells him she's engaged to a man named Peter and is moving back east. She says she waited for him and he says he never asked her to. Jessica thinks he thought it would be easier being alone.

Carter looks into the gang robbing all the banks. They've done a dozen jobs and haven't hurt a single person. She spots that they are using military-issue radios for communication. The radios were stolen six months ago. Carter wants the robbery cop to cross-check New York area serviceman who left out of the same base over the past year.

Reese sees Joey watch the woman from earlier pick up a kid from kindergarten.

Reese makes a point to ""accidentally"" run into Joey at a bar. They talk about the service and the economy. They have a run-in with two bankers that results in Reese head-butting one of them in the face and punching the other.

Outside Joey tells Reese that he had an ""obligation"" to pay and his normal job wasn't cutting it. He says one of the other guys, Straub, has a gambling problem.

Finch finds out the woman Joey's been seeing is an Amy Miles. Reese checks out Straub and sees him meet with Latimer. Straub wants more money and Latimer tells him about a huge upcoming job. Latimer references several soldiers who used to work for him that have since retired. Straub asks what happens to their split if one of them gets killed.

The robbery cop found one of the robbers, a man named Teddy. Carter wants him followed quickly.

Reese gets called for the next job, busting an illegal casino. The team is heavily armed. Carter is watching. Once they break in and start grabbing cash, Carter calls for back-up. Finch hears this and tells Reese. Reese tells the team his has the police band in his ear and helps them get out just in time.

Latimer tells Straub the next job is the ""big one,"" and makes reference to the new guy not being needed on the way out.

Finch thinks they have to wrap this up before somebody gets killed. Reese wants to talk to Joey before they do anything. Finch has been putting money into a savings account for the little girl. It turns out the father of the little girl, Frank, was in Joey's unit and was killed in Afghanistan.

Joey tells Reese about an upcoming meeting. Reese tells him he thinks Straub is dangerous. Joey says Frank took his place on patrol while he was babysitting a politician and got killed. Reese asks him not to do the next job.

Reese sits in Joey's girlfriend's section and tells her how crazy he is about her. She waited six years for him to come home and ""it's like he's still over there."" She indicates that she's in love with Joey and Reese tells Finch they should tip the cops to the next job.

Carter finds out the two solider we saw Latimer referencing to Straub as having ""retired"" were really shot in the head. It seems Latimer kills the guys after four or five jobs and brings in new meat.

The team is told it is stealing one small item from an evidence lock-up that is worth $400,000. Finch listens to Latimer tells someone that he is killing the team. Straub says they've been given brand new weapons. The team destroys all of their cell phones, meaning Finch can't tell Reese what is about to happen.

The job begins and Finch has placed himself right in the middle of the operation. He's able to whisper to Reese that the job is a trap. One of the cops hasn't been secured and grabs a gun. Reese finally convinces them to leave but they take fire on the way out.

The incident is called in and Carter hears that is probably their team.

Latimer is waiting for the team in the van when they return. He kills Straub and Teddy. Joey realizes the weapons they were given don't work. Reese and Joey flee the scene just as the cops arrive.

Reese gives Joey some cash and tells him to get out of the city. He tells him to ask his girlfriend to go with him.

Carter talks to Reese on the radio she found on one of the bodies. She says sooner or later she's going to lock him up.

Latimer gives an unseen person the item they team stole, which was from an evidence box with Elias written on it.

Reese finds Latimer dead and tells Finch they need to look into the name Elias.

Joey and his girlfriend get on a bus.

Another flashback to Reese and Jessica five years ago. She asks him if he wants to take a risk. If he tells her to wait for him, she will. He says nothing and she walks away. He mutters ""Wait for me. Please,"" after she's out of earshot."

She looks at his x-ray and figures out that he's had spinal fusion surgery in the last year or so. He just wants pain meds and she gives them to him.

Finch tells Reese that Tillman is the latest number to be spat out of the computer. She's a talented, hard-working doctor who lives alone. She's well liked and has had no complaints from patients. Reese thinks they'll have to watch her around the clock to figure out why she's on their radar.

Tillman goes to a club and Reese spots a man who bumped into her earlier. He makes a point to bump into him and grabs his wallet. The guy's name is Andrew Benton and he's carrying roofies.

It turns out that Tillman's been at the club every night that week, so she's living a double life of some sort. Benton is an investment banker with a history of accusations that make him sound like a potential sexual predator.

Reese breaks into Benton's place and copies his laptop.

Carter has figured out based on video of the robbery last week that Reese and Finch (who she has found under his other name) communicated.

Finch finds that Benton has an expunged college record. He doesn't like Reese's relationship with Fusco.

A drug dealer pays Fusco a visit looking for money that is still owed him.

Tillman's back at the bar the next night. Tillman and Benton hit it off at the bar, though she gives him a false name. He invites her back to his place but she passes.

Reese follows Tillman, who appears to be taking pictures of Benton with a telephoto lens. She's stalking him.

Fusco tells Reese about being harassed by the drug dealer.

Benton was accused of giving a woman the date rape drug in college. He got off in part because she waited two days to report the attack. The young woman was Tillman's sister who subsequently committed suicide.

Carter pays Finch a visit about the robbery he witnessed. She confronts him about it looking as if Reese spoke to him. He says the man told him to stop staring at him and he begged for his life.

Finch tells Reese he thinks Carter will catch up with him soon.

Reese follows Tillman to a support group. He talks to her at the coffee machine and tells her he lost someone close to him. She tells him a story about running into Benton and when he introduces himself as ""John,"" she responds with the alias ""Kate Leman.""

Reese seems to have figured out Benton's pattern of rape.

Following the alias Tillman's been using, Reese tracks down a home and finds it filled with materials she could use to dispose of Benton's body. Reese is worried Benton's too savvy for her and plans to get rid of him.

Reese helps Fusco take down the drug dealers who have been pressuring him. He beats them up and takes their drugs as Fusco watches in amazement and fear at what they will do to him.

Reese stops Benton's car and knocks him out. He wrecks the guys' car in front of the station and fills the car with drugs.

Shockingly Benton is released the following day. Fusco says it's because of his high-profile legal team.

Tillman's listens to what sounds like a suicide voicemail left by her sister.

Finch spots Tillman heading towards Benton's loft and alerts Reese. At the same moment Reese is knocked out by the drug dealers.

Tillman hits Benton with a stun gun and ties him up.

Fusco helped the drug dealers to find Reese. They begin baiting Reese.

Tillman puts Benton's body in a van.

As Fusco again watches mouth agape in amazement, Reese deftly extricates himself and disposes of all the drug dealers without bothering to remove the manacles from his wrists. Fusco apologizes and Reese tells him it's time for a change of scenery, dirty cop wise, then admonishes him: ""Lionel, don't do this again!""

Reese makes a point to run into Tillman. He calls her by her real name and references knowing she has a guy tied up the back. He tells her she's a great doctor but she'll never get away with killing Benton. Reese thinks killing Benton will kill her. He says she ""doesn't have to do this"" and asks for her keys. She gives him the keys.

Behind the wheel of the van Reese tells Finch that he and Benton are going to ""have a little talk."" Finch says he's taken care of the Carter problem. Fusco has been transferred to Carter's team.

Reese sits across from Benton with a gun on the table. He asks whether Benton thinks that people ever really change. Reese says he could let him go, since Benton would always be looking over his shoulder. But then he says that people don't really change.

He invites Benton to help him make a good decision about whether to kill him or not as the episode ends...."

Reese drops in on Finch who is eating at a diner. He asks if Finch has a favorite menu item and Finch thinks he's fishing for personal information. He leaves behind a photo of the latest number, judge Samuel Gates who lives with his son after his wife passed away less than a year ago. There is also a nanny, Christina (Adriana Gaviria), who spends a lot of time with son Sam.

Reese begins watching Gates (David Costabile) and through placing hidden bugs learns that the jurist has had numerous death threats. While following Gates, Reese notices a man with a crew cut behind him drop a cell phone in the trash which Reese retrieves. The phone recently sent a text that ""School's out, moving in"" and Reese guesses correctly that the father may not be the target.

Young Sam is abducted from the family's home. Reese shows up at the last minute and attempts to stop the kidnapping, but is unable to keep Sam from being taken as he is hit with a small caliber bullet in the shoulder.

Gates gets a call from the kidnappers who tell him his son is alive but they will kill him if contacts the police. Gates makes a few calls and realizes that Sam is missing. Reese shows and promises Gates that he will help get his son back.

Reese goes with Gates to his home. The housekeeper is missing and the alarm was bypassed. He doesn't think Christina could be in on it.

Finch is looking into the discarded cell phone and is attempting to hack the cell phone company to get more info. Reese discovers that the nanny was killed, probably in order to get the alarm code. He dials 911 and leaves the phone off the hook so NYPD can trace the call back to its physical location.

Detective Carter isn't sure about the newly reassigned Fusco.

Reese calls Fusco away for a brief meeting on the street. Fusco tells Reese that Carter won't quit until she finds him. Reese asks him to look at the ballistics, and anything related to guys with crew cuts.

Finch finally gets some information from the discarded cell phone. Reese goes to the location and knocks out a crew-cutted thug named Josef. Based on tattoos he knows the guy is with an Eastern European street gang.

Carter gets called to the scene of Christina's death. A neighbor spotted someone whose description could be Reese, leaving that apartment.

A cop goes to Gates's home to tell him about Christina. He lies and says Sam is fine. Reese tells Gates about the gang. Gates is suspicious about exactly who Reese is, but he reassures the judge he can help him more than the police. The gang calls and tells Gates that don't want money, rather they need him to ensure a defendant, Angela Markham, the hit-and-run driver we saw earlier, is found Not Guilty and released.

Before the trial resumes Gates tells Reese that Markham was charged with DWI. Reese tells him that the gang is going to kill him, too, so he needs to buy Reese time to find Sam.

Finch has learned that the gang is essentially a multi-national corporation. They're smart and haven't been leaving much of a footprint anywhere.

Fusco tells Reese that his bullet isn't in the system, but offers to help him ID Christina's killer. Fusco helps Carter with the Christina case and she's happy for the assistance.

After driving around in circles with the gang member in his trunk, the thug tells Reese that he doesn't know anything about the kid. They work in small cells and he doesn't have that kind of access. He does, however, give up the address of where he goes to get paid.

Gates starts sustaining every defense objection. He then tells the prosecutor to take time and get her witness prepared and adjourns until the following day. In chambers he gets a call from the gang who thinks he is stalling. Gates says he needs to make it look good so the verdict won't be overturned on appeal.

Finch overhears Markham (Meredith Patterson) talking to the gang leader and learns that her connection to the gang is business-related.

Reese goes to the money house. He grabs yet another gang member, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in small bills.

The gang leader is furious when he finds out what is happening and starts barking orders.

Finch has figured out that Markham is in charge of the money-laundering system at a large bank which is cleaning all of the gang's cash. Finch thinks if they can find the gang's specific accounts they'll be able to find Sam.

Reese asks Gates to give him a little more time. Gates goes onto the bench and throws out a critical piece of evidence.

Finch is able to get inside the bank and access some of its computer files.

Fusco spots a guy on the street near Christina's place who could be the killer. He calls it ""a hunch"" and has a plate run back to a Coldfield Holdings in Brooklyn.

Reese has obtained from his gang prisoner the identity of the boss, a man named Jarek Koska. Finch tells Reese that every day Markham shuts down the anti-laundering software for five minutes, during which time the gang scrubs millions of dollars. Not only are they laundering their own money, but they are providing the service for other criminal organizations. Fusco texts Reese the name Coldfield, which he gives to Finch. It turns up a huge account, along with an address that is less than ten blocks from Gates's house.

As the jury returns with a verdict, Reese finds that Sam has been moved from the location. Markham is found not guilty.

Jarek calls Gates and tells him they need to meet to hand over Sam. Finch is listening and realizes that Gates and his son will be killed at the meet.

At the location Jarek is preparing to shoot Sam when Reese shows up with a gun to Markham's head. He then tells Jarek that all of his accounts have been emptied and the money moved to an offshore account. If Jarek doesn't let them all go free he will inform the other criminal enterprises that he's lost their money as well and they will surely kill him. This sort of works, as Jarek pushes Sam away, then gives his men the order to ""kill everyone."" In the ensuing shootout Reese kills Jarek's henchman and wounds him, but Gates and Sam are fine.

We see that Finch has surreptitiously slipped a piece of paper with Markham's financial misdeeds to the lead prosecutor.

Carter and Fusco arrive at the address associated with Coldfield Holdings to find Jarek, Markham and several other gang members tied up next to the cash.

Reese pays Gates and his son a visit. Gates thanks him, but assures him he won't be able to help him when he's eventually caught.

Reese again meets Finch at the diner and thanks him for the job. This time Finch subtlely reveals that he is a regular there, perhaps a sign he is opening up."

Reese is posing as the replacement driver for a woman (Paige Turco), with Finch helping cover the story by intercepting her confirming call to the service. As Reese drives her away, he clones Zoe's cell phone while Finch breaks into her brownstone apartment and begins a search.

The woman has Reese take her to the docks where she meets up with a rough-looking group of men, who look to be a threat in the form of gang members. Instead, she purchases something in a paper bag, giving one of the men, Slip (Samuel Smith), a large roll of currency.

When she gets back in the car Reese sees it is a gun. She changes into a party dress and goes into a building. Reese follows her and sees she is returning the gun to a cop, Lieutenant Gilmore (Jeff Wincott). The gun is a sidearm another officer, Gilmore's nephew, left in a subway bathroom. This will save the officer's career and in exchange she wants Gilmore to ease up on investigating an elected official. The woman, who goes by the name Zoe Morgan, is a fixer. Reese thinks the potential number of people who would want to do her harm is going to be large.

Detective Carter goes to the scene of a murder of an old former mob enforcer with a knife stuck in his chest. Looking at his record, Carter sees he was once charged with stabbing a woman named Marlene Elias.

Reese takes Zoe to meet with Samuel Douglas (Matt Servitto), the head of crisis management at pharmaceutical giant Virtanen. An investment blogger has tape of conversation between a woman and Douglas' boss, CFO Mark Lawson (Tim Guinee). Lawson is supposed to take over the company from his father-in-law and doesn't want his wife to find out. They want Zoe to hand over a $40,000 payment to Talbot.

Zoe makes the exchange with Talbot (Adam LeFevre). He doesn't seem like a threat.

Carter meets with a retired detective named Sullivan (Dan Hedaya), who has investigated Marlene Elias' murder. Sullivan says Elias had an affair with a mob boss. She was killed when she wanted him to dump his wife. The DA was paid off so the enforcer went free. Carter tells Sullivan the evidence from the trial was stolen several weeks ago. Sullivan says the relationship between Elias and the don produced a son, who ended up in the system.

Zoe meets Douglas. He's with two other men. Once she hands over the recording, they attempt to grab her. Reese jumps in and saves the day, forced to shoot his way from the scene. Reese brings Zoe to Talbot's for more information, but he's been killed. As soon as Reese steps away from the car, Zoe disappears.

Finch is working on the audio of Lawson with the woman. Her name is Dana Miller, a former employee of Virtanen. Finch tells Reese that Miller's number came up six months ago. He had no way to help and she ended up dead of a supposed brain aneurism. The think Lawson killed her to hide the affair from his father-in-law.

In the last few hours. Finch has purchased 87 million shares of Virtanen, making him an eight percent owner of the company. He schedules a meeting with Lawson, who shows him around the company and tells him about Sycolet, a ""revolutionary"" anti-migraine drug just approved by the FDA. Finch also has a brief face-to-face with Robert Keller (Brian Murray), Lawson's father-in-law.

Finch leaves a bug in Lawson's office and hears they are going to go after both Zoey and Reese.

Sullivan calls Carter with information. Elias' son was a runaway who spent time with a woman named Gloria Resento. Carter is going to stop by and get the correspondence between the Elias boy and Resento.

Finch has cleaned up some of the audio. It's clear Miller wasn't having an affair with Lawson, but rather was intending to blow the whistle on some product Virtanen was intending to introduce. Zoe's cell phone pops up on the grid.

Reese meets Zoe at a restaurant. She doesn't trust Reese, but thinks he can perhaps help her.

After a quick conversation with Gilmore to ensure the police won't respond, Zoe and Reese break into Virtanen. The find a deleted file Miller spent time with. It turns out six names were removed from the clinical trial for the migraine drug. All six died of heart problems. Such a mortality rate would have prevented the drug from being FDA-approved. it seems Miller was killed to keep this quiet. Finch (who has been helping from home base) records more audio to finish cleaning up the Lawson/Miller's tape, learning, to his shock, Keller has been in on it all along.

During that time Reese and Zoe are surprised at gunpoint by Douglas, who is being assisted by Gilmore who has turned on Zoe.

Reese and Zoey are tied to chairs. Lawson walks in and asks about the report. Zoe says she E-mailed it to someone she trusts. If anything happens to her. it will be E-mailed to Keller. Keller walks into the room and is upset Reese and Zoe haven't been killed yet; he's in on the cover-up. Douglas pulls out a hypodermic containing potassium chloride and tells Reese and Zoe whichever one gives him the report will live. Zoe says she'll do it, but slips Reese a paper clip to pick his handcuffs on her way out of the room.

Reese has little trouble freeing himself from the cuffs and as they struggle, dispatches Douglas with the lethal dose in the syringe with which he was about to inject Reese.

Finch has figured out Keller is involved and meets him for dinner. He tells Reese on the phone Zoe is taking Lawson to the same naval yard where she bought the gun earlier.

While sitting in the car at the docks Lawson tells Zoe he doesn't think she sent the report to anybody. He thinks she sent it to herself. After confirming the information is on her cell phone, he tells he's going to kill her and instructs the driver to leave. At this moment, Reese smashes in the driver's side window and incapacities everybody.

At dinner at his club, Keller intrudes to ask Finch what his plans are with such a large stake in Virtanen. Finch looks down and sees a text from Reese. They're in possession of the FDA report. Finch then tells Keller he's shorted his stock ""to the tune of half a billion shares"" because he's heard upper management is about to face ""some very serious legal problems."" He places a picture of Dana Miller on the table and leaves.

Carter drops by to see Sullivan and finds him dead on the floor. She looks down the stairwell and spots someone trying to flee. They exchange gunfire. The person gets away. Carter spots blood on the door frame, indicating that she wounded the person in the exchange of shots.

Reese is driving Zoey to another stop as we hear on the radio that Keller and son-in-law Lawson are appearing in court to be arraigned on charges of fraud, conspiracy and murder. Reese mentions hearing Lieutenant Gilmore is facing corruption charges. Reese tells Zoe to be careful. She says ""not gonna happen"" but tells him he has her (cell' 'phone) number as the episode ends."

Carter and Fusco are at the scene and are told by a detective from organized crime that the man killed was a mobster, likely killed by the Russian mafia as retaliation for other hits. Someone named Elias is involved. They see a man bend down near the dead man before leaving the scene. The storeowner is Russian and they feel like the mafia has probably been tipped off that a witness is at large.

Cut to Reese watching a high school teacher named Burton through his apartment window. Fusco calls Reese looking for help finding his witness and describes Burton perfectly. Just then two vehicles full of heavily armed Russian mobsters pulls up and Reese realizes that he is Burton's only hope. He sneaks in the back and gets Burton out of the building just in time. Reese disarms one of the Russians and in the process breaks his cell phone, losing contact with Finch. They attempt to steal a car and two more of the Russians open fire. Burton is wounded in the process and the decided their only escape option is to go through a dangerous high-rise controlled by a vicious Bulgarian drug dealer.

Burton tells Reese that he stopped at the store on his way home. He hid when he saw masked men with a gun, but saw one lift his mask. The guy who was killed told Buron he had a message for Elias that Vinny was going to finish the job for him. Burton tells Reese that he can't testify because he'll never be able to come back to his home.

The dead mobster D'Agostino's widow drops by the station. She tells them it doesn't matter if they find who killed her husband, since Elias will. She's never met Elias, but tells the cops his plan is to reunite the five families and get rid of the Russians.

Carter and Fusco go to Burton's place and hear that he was with a ""tall guy in a suit."" A passerby took video of a Russian mobster named Peter Yegorov, who is boss Ivan's son.

Finch gains access to the ATM camera that was across the street and sees that Reese got away. He sees an SUV pull up after they leave and an NYPD cop get inside. Finch calls Fusco and gives him the license plate number of the SUV to run.

Peter tells a subordinate they can't go into the Bulgarian-controlled building, but they will guard every exit and get Reese and Burton if they leave.

Burton talks about his relationship with the kids, many of whom are children of Russian mobsters. Reese leaves to ""find us a pharmacy.""

Finch finds Fusco who tells him the plate is licensed to a shell corporation. Finch thinks that Elias probably wants Burton dead as well, based on what D'Agostino told him before he died.

Reese drops in on a pair of tweakers. He takes a gun from one and helps himself to some supplies.

The organized crime guy tells Carter he's not sure why Elias is making a move for the Russian's turf. Carter tells him about Marlene Elias having an illegitimate son with the don.

Reese used cocaine and glue to help close Burton's wound. He thanks Reese for saving his life. Reese gives him the gun for protection.

The Bulgarians give Peter and his men permission to help them take care of Reese and Burton.

Reese finds a landline in the project and calls Finch. He asks him to find them a way out. Finch tells them about a service entrance they can try and Reese tells him to have Fusco meet them first thing the following morning.

They run into one of Burton's students, Will, in the hall and he lets them hide out in his apartment.

Finch pretends to be Fusco and has the police turn on the GPS and microphone in the SUV from earlier. He hears the man he earlier saw wearing the NYPD uniform talking about needing to ""get to them first"" before the Russians. Finch wonders if this is Elias.

The Russian finally make their way to Will's apartment. Will is able to convince them he's alone. Burton doesn't seem to be doing very well. Will suggests another way for them to exit.

Reese manages to grab one of the Russians.

Carter goes to see Ivan, who doesn't give them any real information about Peter. He does tell them that Elias is the one who started the war.

Reese, Burton and their hostage leave the project and head for the river. Finch hears that Elias somehow has inside information as to Reese's movements.

Finch calls Fusco and accuses him of being responsible for tipping off Elias. Fusco seems legitimately confused and during the conversation is knocked out from behind by one of Elias' men. He is now waiting at the pier for Reese and Burton.

Carter brings Peter in for questioning. Witnesses told them about shooting up the street. Carter thinks he's trying to kill the guy who saw his father's face. Peter smiles at Carter and tells her she doesn't understand what is happening.

At this very moment the witness starts talking to Reese about his ""boss."" From behind Burton pulls a gun on Reese -- it seems our teacher is actually Elias himself. Elias tells the Russian that their territory now belongs to him. He shoots the man in the knee and tells him if his boss leaves town he'll let him live. Elias tells Reese he thought killing him would be ""ungrateful."" He says if Reese stays out of his way, he'll stay out of his.

They dock and the man Finch thought was Elias meets Burton/Elias and opens the door for him.

Reese tells Finch they made a huge mistake letting Elias go, he's upset they saved a killer's life. Finch says they must move on.

We see Ivan killed by Elias' lieutenant. The crooked cop tells Elias ""Boss, it's done."" Elias responds that ""it's only just beginning."""

Negel has come up in Finch's machine. Based on the fact he has a foreign background and has made no electronic transactions in 24 years they guess the name Negal is an alias. There is a cemetery plot under his name.

Finch goes to see a shady bookstore owner, Pilcher (Austin Pendleton), who has cold war intelligence.

At the cemetery plot Reese finds German coins.

The bookstore guy finds the real name for Negal, Ulrecht Kohl. He was part of a team that would hunt down East German defectors and kill them.

Finch finds out that Kohl's wife, Anja, was killed in a car accident in 1989. Kohl was never heard from after that point.

Kohl knocks on a door. An old man, (Kent Broadhurst), answers and when Kohl shows him a picture of his wife Anja the man says ""It can't be you."" Kohl shoots him and goes inside.

We flashback to 2006. It seems we are looking at Reese's first CIA mission. He's working with a woman, Stanton (Annie Parisse), who is explaining the way thinks work. She also tells them they know he tried to see his girlfriend during a recent trip. That is a no-no for him now.

Reese goes to the apartment of Hauffe. The man is dead and he sees marks on his neck that indicate interrogation. On the phone Finch reads off that there were three members of his team, Steiller, Vernick and Hauffe. Heinlein, who is German Intelligence, sneaks up from behind Reese. Reese knocks him out and calls Fusco to give him a head's up that more murders might be coming.

Reese tells Finch that Kohl is seeking revenge on his former team for something, possibly his wife's death.

We see Kohl kill yet another one of his former team members, Wernick (Larry Pine), by sticking him with one of his needles at a restaurant. Kohl also shows him a picture of ""my Anja."" The man says he didn't know ""they"" would go after her. Kohl said he was caught on put in a hole but never stopped planning.

Reese jumps in the responding ambulance and gets Wernick to tell him what Kohl us up to before he dies. It was a joint effort between the U.S. and Germany. The team was told if they gave-up Kohl they could have nice lives in America.

Steiller is the last target. Using a pin found on the last victim Reese and Finch out the team must have been meeting at a German society called Volk.

The German Intelligence officer tells Carter and Fusco that Kohl escaped during a transfer. He mentions that Kohl ""doesn't exist"" and bringing him back a high priority. A German representative comes in with an order from the State Department to shut down the interrogation.

Finch finds the Volk membership roster. He finds a man named Stagans whose credit scores only go back to 1988. Finch calls Steiller (Sherman Howard) to warn him. Kohl walks up just as Steiller tells Finch that Kohl is dead. We hear Kohl and Steiller talk while Reese rushes to the scene. Before Kohl can shoot him Steiller hands Kohl a phone. A woman answers and Kohl looks shocked. ""Anja is alive?"" he says. Steiller says Kohl's revenge ""was for nothing"" and goes for Kohl's gun. Kohl pushes him off the roof right before Reese arrives. Reese thinks Anja will be next on Kohl's list.

Fusco texts Reese with information on the German Intel officer's car. Reese pulls a large caliber sniper rifle out of the trunk of his car and takes aim. He hits the car's engine block and the vehicle careens into a fence. The intel officer slips Finch an address.

Kohl arrives at Anja's place and finds Reese waiting. Kohl grabs Reese's face and disables him by cutting off both arteries.

We see that Finch is elsewhere with Anja (Laila Robins) .

Reese wakes up across the table from Kohl who pulls out his needles. He sticks one in a nerve and asks Reese for the location of Anja. Reese flashes back to 2006 when the woman he was with killed two other men.

Carter hears about Reese shooting the intel officer off the road. Finch calls Fusco looking for help with Reese. He sends him an address.

Kohl talks to Reese about taking lives for his country. He tells Reese he has to see Anja.

Anja tells Finch she loved Kohl and he loved her. She fled to the Soviet Union. The Americans found her and showed her photos of what he had done. The Americans stages the accident to make it looks as if she was dead.

Kohl finds a picture of a young woman in the kitchen. He looks through albums and finds her name is Marie. Reese tries to convince him not to do anything stupid. Kohl is right about to shoot Reese when Fusco comes in and distracts him. Kohl escapes.

Kohl finds Marie (Aubrey Dollar). He shows her his gun and tells her to call Anja. Kohl tells Anja that if she meets him he won't hurt Anja.

Reese tells Finch that he doesn't think Kohl will let Marie leave.

At the meeting place Marie tells Kohl her real father died a hero after helping her and her mother get free. He tells her he knew her father ""once."" Finch and Anja arrive, at about the same time as Reese. We see that Carter, Fusco and a team are also therein the park.

Anja tells Kohl that she felt trapped. She says she was afraid of the person he'd become and asks for forgiveness. Kohl points his gun at Anja and Reese points his gun at Kohl. The camera cuts away and we hear a shot. When we cut back Kohl has been shot. Reese has Finch take the women away. Reese sees that there were no bullets in Kohl's gun. Kohl says he never would have hurt them and was counting on Reese shooting him. He says the part of him that survived was Marie. Kohl dies and Reese leaves just before the cops arrive.

We return to the 2006 flashback just after the shots. Stanton tells Reese to dispose of the gun and the bodies. He seems upset that they didn't even question the men. She tells him the threat is real and ""your country needs you."" Before leaving she tells Reese that he no longer has any old friends.

Kohl is buried under a different name in the plot he had years ago acquired as a stash site. Reese and Finch note that they will be a similar situation when they die."

He's not talking, and the soldier says he'll have to get his boss. His boss is Detective Carter.

In present day Carter tells Mrs. Kovach (Jennifer Laura Thompson), a victim of severe domestic abuse that she needs to report her husband before she ends up dead.

Carter meets with Elias' biological father, Moretti (Mark Margolis), who is in prison. She tries to convince him that Elias will be able to get to him but he doesn't seem interested. Moretti points out it seems like she might be in trouble as well.

Carter recognizes a drive-by victim (Ronnie Middleton) as somebody who recently ID'd an area thug Hector Alvarez as a shooter. Middleton later recanted his story, however, and never testified. A local business owner who sold Middleton a soda says he's drop by and give her his story.

Finch calls Reese and tells him the machine has spit out Carter's name.

Reese listens in on Carter's conversation with her son Taylor (Kwoade Cross). Finch places a video bug in her car, along with a GPS tracker.

Carter pays Hector (Jason Manuel Olazábal) a visit. He says last night he was with his girlfriend Monica.

Finch looks at Carter's bio with Reese and they realize that she has made hundred of enemies over the years. Hector, Kovach (the abusive husband) and Elias are atop the list.

Finch gives Fusco a bobble head with a camera and instructs him to point it towards Carter's desk. He wants Fusco to ask around and see if anybody is targeting Carter.

Carter grabs one of her regular CIs and asks about Elias and the Middleton drive-by. He's going to look into it.

A former partner of Fusco tells him that Elias is bringing organized crime back to City Hall. Carter is getting in people's way and is bad for business. Permission apparently has been given for her to be killed, as long as it looks ""clean.""

Carter pays the store owner another visit when he never shows. All he'll say is that Hector has been in his store a few times buying beer and condoms. Outside she sees Hector, who makes veiled threats to both her son and the store owner.

Fusco tells Reese what he learned about Carter being taken out.

Carter meets with the hulking Kovach (Flint Beverage) and warns him to keep his hands off his wife. He threatens to shoot her if she comes after him and Reese thinks this is their best suspect.

In another flashback to Carter is interrogating Yusuf. He's responsible for providing explosive vests that have been used by terrorists to kill soldiers. He says he can't tell her anything because of what will happen to him and his family.

Carter and Fusco figure out that Hector probably has a girlfriend on the side who lives near that store.

Reese blows the door off of Hector's body shop with a specialized weapon, and walks in through the breech with his weapon blazing with less-than-lethal rounds which incapacitate the gang inside. He grabs a bunch of guns and steals a car. He tells them if he sees Hector again he'll close down his shop.

Back to Carter and Yusuf. She convinces him the best way to protect his family is to help her. She references losing somebody special to her and it changing her. Yusuf agrees to take her to the locations of the explosives ""for our children.""

Carter goes back to see her CI with Fusco. He tells her he thinks Hector has a stripper on the side.

Carter introduces the girlfriend Monica to the stripper Hector has also been seeing, and shuts the two excitable Latinas in a room together. They get into an altercation before they realize that Hector has been cheating on the both of them.

Another officer tells Carter about the person who shot up Hector's shop, and that Hector has apparently disappeared.

Reese thinks he's protected Carter from Hector, but Finch isn't so sure. Reese thinks Carter is one of their most important cases.

Hector's women tells them that Hector went out the night of Middleton's murder. He changed his shirt that night and she tells them they can have it. They also give her a likely location for Hector. Mrs. Kovach calls Carter and says her husband has a gun and is about to kill her.

Carter and Fusco go the Kovach house and find the man has been incapacitated by someone, trussed up and dangling from the ceiling in the hall. Reese calls Mrs. Kovach's phone and asks to speak with Carter. He says she's in trouble.

We see that Elias (Enrico Colantoni, who we first met in the guise of Charlie Burton in ""Witness (2011)"") is delivering flowers to Carter's desk, where he also takes a quick look at some of her files.

Carter later reads the card on the flowers, which are condolences for her death.

Reese has managed to get himself into the police team that is going into Hector's hideout. Reese follows Carter when she walks around toward the back. Hector tries to flee by running Carter over, but she shoots him through the windshield and gets him in cuffs.

Reese follows Carter after work. Finch points out that despite Hector and Kovach being neutralized he still isn't sure. Carter meets with her CI. He says he found Elias, who told him it ""either you or me."" He shoots her twice in the chest, but before he can finish her off Reese takes him out.

While lying on the ground Carter flashes back to being congratulated on finding the explosives. But the other soldiers led by Sgt. Harris (Ed Moran) say Yusuf never made it back and that ""accidents happen."" They say it's going to be a long war and she's all alone.

It seems Carter was hit in the vest. From the shadows Reese tells her that he understands that she's going to continue to go after him, but she's not alone.

Reese finds the corrupt Captain who Fusco had met with earlier and tells him to make sure everyone knows permission to go after Carter has been revoked.

Carter and her son eat together. While Finch takes the camera out of her car he finds a photograph of an officer she keeps in the car. Reese listens as she tells Taylor ""we have each other."""

Reese glances through one of Finch's books and finds an old picture. Finch tells him the machine has spit out four names this week: Claire Ryan, Matt Dugan, Wendy McNally and Paula Vasquez. It's unclear what connection there is between the four.

Carter is being questioned by IA about the mysterious man who shot her CI. She tells Fusco that she's stuck on her desk until the inquiry is finished.

Reese goes to the first name on the list, a professor named Claire (Helen Coxe). Police are everywhere and he sees that she is dead. Reese copies her laptop. Fusco says she was beaten and shot at close range and it seems she recently came into some money.

Reese convinces Finch that he needs to help him track the remaining three named. Finch will track Matt, Reese will take Wendy and they will give Paula to Fusco. Reese tells Fusco that Paula could be connected.

A sinister investigator named Snow (Michael Kelly) drops by the station looking into Carter and Reese.

Reese tracks Wendy (Bridget Regan) to her salon where she seems smitten with him.

Fusco loses Paula (Melonie Diaz) who seemed very skittish.

Finch sees that Matt (Jeremy Beck), whose aunt has just died, is spending his inheritance on a new motorcycle. Fusco checks in and says he thinks Paula just bought a gun on the street. Wendy has left the salon without Reese realizing it, so he grabs her phone. Finch spots a stroller left unattended in front of Matt's car by a woman in dark glasses and a large floppy hat. It turns out to be a bomb which the woman remotely detonates. Exit Matt.

We hear more conversations about the car crash and references to cocaine.

Finch is upset he couldn't save Matt. He finds that Matt, Wendy and Claire's phones were all at the same place a few days earlier, the scene of a fatal car crash. Wendy has disappeared.

Carter tells Fusco she's connected the fingerprints of Matt and Claire to a car accident. She thinks they were trying to help the male victim. The driver of the car was a Congressman's son named Jamie Hallam who was speeding, high on drugs. His name has been withheld from the press. A brochure for a Haitian orphan charity was found in the car. Jamie's father has been investigating Wall Street.

Fusco meets with Congressman Hallam (Michael Murphy), asking about his son's movements that night. Hallam has been looking into a banker named Davis Bannerman who was with Jamie that night. Hallam admits Jamie was involved with something shady.

Reese finds Wendy and Paula together. He sees them embrace. He goes inside and learns they are foster sisters. He saves them from a man who comes to the door trying to kill them, but they get away in the process.

Carter gets video footage of Jamie's crash. They see Claire and Matt's cars pull up, followed by two women walking up to the scene. A suitcase is pulled out of the car, then 30 minutes later a man in a brand new car without license plates arrives.

It turns out Paula and Wendy's foster mother Susan is in the hospital and having money issues.

Carter finds out that somebody used a fake police shield to gain access to the car crash footage.

Snow finds her on the street and wants to talk. He is CIA and tells her that Reese was his best friend. He tells her Reese is dangerous and says he killed his former partner, Cara Stanton. Since he seems to trust Carter they want her to help them bring him in.

Bannerman (Jack Gwaltney) tells Fusco that Jamie was stoned that night and he seemed to suddenly come into a lot of money. Afterwards, Fusco tells Finch he thinks Hallam and Bannerman's stories were too coordinated.

Finch tells Reese that Jamie was set to fly to the Cayman Islands that night on Bannerman's private jet. Reese finds Wendy at the hospital. She admits that they split the cash they found in Jamie's car between the four of them, $250,000 each. Their share is under their mother's hospital bed. At this point they want to give it back. Paula has been grabbed in the parking lot. A man, Dayne (J. Bernard Calloway), calls Wendy and tells her to bring him the money if she wants her sister to live.

Finch meets with Hallam pretending to be a blogger. Finch says Hallam's enemies are trying to bring him down using his son. He tells him the charity has never used a dime of the $30 million and plans to ruin him. Finch suggests he can move all of the ""dirty"" money into a legitimate charity.

Finch leaves behind a camera pen and hears Hallam call Bannerman and tells him someone has found out about their scam. Finch sends Fusco the recording.

Reese calls Carter. He says the people who killed Matt and Claire are in a parking garage at the hospital. She thanks him for saving her life. Reluctantly, Carter calls the CIA guy, Snow, and tells him she knows where Reese will be.

Finch listens to Carter make the call to the CIA, and races by car to the hospital garage.

The woman (Tracey Ruggiero) who killed Matt with the stroller bomb and posed as a nurse on the sick mother's ward in the hospital, arrives and shoots at Reese. He returns fire and kills her.

Snow, with Dayne, arrives in the parking garage, exiting their vehicle with guns drawn. Reese and Snow exchange guarded greetings by name.

More gunfire is exchanged as Finch charges onto the scene.

Reese helps Paula and Wendy escape with the money.

Reese meets with Snow, who he calls Mark. Mark says ""It's time to come home, John. The slate's been wiped clean."" Reese is shot in the stomach and the leg but is able to escape down the stairs in the parking structure. Reese staggers towards Finch's car and collapses into his arms. Carter has a bead on them both but decides to help them escape."

He dumps a pile of cash on the table and tells him to patch Reese up.

Snow and the CIA are following Carter. He seems suspicious of how Reese was able to get away.

In the office Carter jumps behind Fusco's desk and gets on his computer. She finds a picture of Finch from the Centre St. robbery under the name Burdette.

Flash back to 2005 when Finch is eavesdropping on a conversation between his business partner, Nathan Ingram, and an unidentified NSA representative. She needs some evidence of his progress with the project. Nathan hands her a nine-digit number. Finch later assures Nathan the number he gave her will satisfy her need to know.

Present day: a building super named Trask introduces the wheelchair-bound Reese to his new apartment. Trask talks about his crazy, former (high) life down in Miami. Finch stops by and tells him there is a reason he chose the apartment building: the Machine just spit out Trask's number.

Trask is 51, born in a small town in Florida. He was obviously exaggerating his personal history. Recently, Trask has been searching pawn shops for an untraceable gun.

Snow and his team are still closely watching Carter, looking for Reese.

Finch hacks into the building's wi-fi and is able to use everybody's electronic devices to monitor what is going on. They see that a chef named Lilly appears to be dating penthouse resident Rick.

Reese breaks his own sink to get Trask out of his apartment and allow Finch to snoop around. Inside Finch finds dozens of pictures of Lilly -- it appears Trask is stalking her. Trask goes back to his apartment to get a different wrench and just catches Finch leaving his place. Finch manages to escape into the elevator, but it later caught by the building's security guard. Reese, using the security cameras, finds that the guard was there because he was stealing from one of the rooms. Reese sends Finch's cell phone video of the theft; once Finch shows the guard the evidence, he agrees to let him go.

Back in 2005 we see Nathan (and Finch) get a surprise visit from a Deputy Director Weeks. He tells them the number they gave him was the social security number of an agent with a spotless record. After following him for a few weeks they catch him trying to sell a sizable quantity of uranium. Weeks wants to know how the Machine works, but Nathan isn't giving up any info. When Weeks brings up the issue of personal profit, he is told Nathan is only being paid $1 to develop the Machine.

We hear Lilly telling a friend she's terrified of a person watching her.

Reese's research finds Lilly's a rising star in the restaurant business and has been romantically linked to Rick. Reese gives Finch some self-defense advise before he heads out to do some foot patrol research.

Finch breaks into Lilly's place to plant a new camera but finds one already placed in her bedroom vent. It's connected to a hidden network, meaning Trask has been following her every move.

Carter manages to lose her CIA tail and follows the trace she has on Finch's cell phone.

Finch calls Fusco to asks why Carter is looking for him. He's sent Fusco a prescription bottle with Reese's fingerprints on it and wants him to plant it someplace far away. Finch is watching Lilly and lets Reese know that she clearly seems to feel terrorized. Reese finds out that Trask had a wife who mysteriously disappeared.

Carter stops when Finch's signal ends. He calls a pay 'phone near her, and when she answers it, he tells her to turn around. He is right there and the two sit at a café table together. She want to know what he and Reese are doing and he points her to a man at the bar named Watson. The guy has lost his job, his home and his wife and Finch tells her he will soon be involved in a violent crime. Finch leaves her to follow their latest number.

Carter calls to get some background on Watson. She doesn't learn anything suspicious but she finds that he's following a banker named Dalton who filed the foreclosure paperwork on his house.

Reese thinks Trask might be more interested in Rick than Lilly, which could mean he's getting the boyfriend out of the way. He spots an impending confrontation between Trask and Rick, spotting that Trask has a gun. Trask tells Rick he needs to stay away from Lilly. Reese sets off the building's fire alarm, which prevents any further incident.

Lilly receives a barrage of obsessive text messages from a blocked number. Finch says he wants Trask out of the building that night.

Reese waits for Trask and confronts him about Lilly. Trask says he doesn't have feelings for Lilly ""like that."" At the same moment the computer spits out the source of the hidden network and all of the photos -- it was Rick all along.

We see Rick waiting for Lilly when she returns home. With Finch watching, he pulls her away from the phone. Rick asks her if she ""lied"" to Trask about him and grabs her by the neck. Finch walks in and temporarily stops him. He gets help from Trask and Reese, who throws Rick out the window.

The CIA guys hear about Reese's fingerprints being found in Connecticut and head off in that direction.

Rick survives the fall and, as the crooked security guard is being arrested, Lilly tells the police that Rick had been stalking her for months. She credits Trask for helping her. Finch has learned that Trask had a different name when he was in Miami. He was telling the truth about his high-flying lifestyle, but is in New York as part of witness protection after testifying against the Cuban mafia. His wife left him when his lifestyle changed.

Carter stops Walton just before he can shoot Dalton in a restaurant. As she slaps the cuffs on him her 'phone rings with Finch on the line: ""That, Detective Carter, is what we do.""

A final flashback to 2005. Finch and Nathan celebrate the Machine finally getting its government contract. Finch gives Nathan a little insight into how the Machine was able to spot the dirty agent. Finch says he plans to encrypt the device so that nobody else will ever know its secrets, as Weeks has been trying to hack the Machine's code."

She feels she owes him the meeting since she was responsible for his getting shot, but she wants more answers. Reese tells her she's involved because her moral compass is pointed in the right direction. He doesnt tell her about the machine, but gives her the name Andrea Gutierrez. He needs the juvenile records on Gutierrez, who is civil litigator. He gives her a dedicated cellular 'phone to facilitate contact between them.

Finch provides more background on Gutierrez, who Reese calls an ambitious scrapper. She has lots of debt and is currently suing the state on behalf of ex-cons... but has lost six straight decisions.

Gutierrez is in court with a client named King, who seems to think he is innocent of drug-related charges. Reese then follows her as she meets friends for drinks.

Carter calls Reese with Gutierrez' records. Fusco thinks Carter is up to something when he sees her sneak off to make the call. Reese spots somebody tailing Gutierrez. He stops the guy right before he can shoot Gutierrez from behind, and they fight. The guy handles himself quite well against Reese in his still weakened condition, and escapes. She is unaware of what just happened.

While they guys search for Gutierrez' attacker, Finch is called away. He goes to a police station and bails out a young man named Will for underground gambling. The two hug.

Reese gives Carter a bottle of steroids he took off the attacker and wants to know where they might have come from.

Reese pretends to be a potential client for Gutierrez who wants to sue his boss. When she steps away he plants a microphone and helps Finch get into her computer.

Gutierrez is trying to help prove King was clean on the night of his charge.

On a tip from Carter Reese finds the attacker near his gym. The man runs and during the chase is hit by a garbage truck and is killed. He was an ex-con named Garcia, and his connection to Gutierrez was that he shared a parole officer with King, a man named Galuska.

Carter calls Finch, not too thrilled that a body resulted from her helping him after he has promised ""no killing."" He tells her that somebody was probably paying Garcia to kill Gutierrez.

Reese confronts Galuska, who is shaking down his parolees for their legitimate pay and knocks him out. He puts the unconscious man behind the wheel of his vehicle and pours liquor on him.

Reese watches Finch interact with Will, who seems to be the son of his former partner. Carter calls Reese about framing Galuska. She's found out that a number of his former parolees have been complaining that he set them up. Reese gives Fusco another job.

Reese drops by to see Gutierrez and says Galuska is his new parole officer. He asks her about being single and the fact she didn't stay in the town where she grew up.

In an interrogation room, Carter tells Galuska about Garcia being killed and asks him about him coming after Gutierrez. He lawyers up.

Finch finds out that Galuska has $500K in the bank. Recently he took out $9,900, just under the 10K IRS reporting level, to pay Galuska. They see he's just made a similar withdrawal, meaning he's hired somebody else to finish the job.

Reese stops another man from killing Gutierrez. He brings her to a safe house where she starts demanding answers. Finch calls to say the man who tried to kill Gutierrez this time was also a former parolee of Galuska. Reese tells her what's happening, which confirms for her that King is innocent. She wants to tell King, but Reese demands she stay put until he can be sure she's safe.

Carter tells Reese that all the parolees Galuskas been stealing from have been single parents. He's been going after the state foster care money.

Carter meets with King's son' foster parents. They are listed as having six children under their care, despite living in a one bedroom apartment. Other than King's child, the other kids don't exist. She wants them to give up Galuska's family services connection, but they want a lawyer.

Finch calls Carter to tell her he thinks he knows the family services connect, a woman named Gloria Copeland. He wants her to give the foster family their one phone call.

We see Finch install a scanner on the shredder in Copeland's office.

King calls Carter to say he's being moved to a maximum security facility upstate. He needs her to file an injunction to stop it.

Finch thinks Copeland has started shredding documents. Finch learns that she and Galuska have been making it look as if the parolees have more children than they actually do. The scam would be worth $250,000 a month. But Reese is following Copeland, so it couldnt be her.

Gutierrez meets with a case worker named Chris she's friendly with on behalf of King, since his transfer isn't in the best interest of his son. But it turns out he is the one working with Galuska. He pulls out a gun.

Finch finds that Chris has been forging Copeland's signature on documents.

Chris brings Gutierrez to the basement at gunpoint. He tries to rationalize what he did by saying the kids were better off with foster families. Gutierrez manages to escape long enough to allow Reese to arrive. Reese runs Chris directly into Carter, who makes the arrest.

King is reunited with his son as a free man. Gutierrez has won a $10 million judgment on behalf of King, of which she'll get 30 percent as his attorney. She thanks Reese.

Will tells Finch he's going to stay in town and learn more about his father. Will is starting to discover inconsistencies related to the machine. Finch, who Will thinks is simply an insurance expert, feigns innocence.

The episode ends as Fusco tails Finch at Reese's direction."

Reese watches the man leave home and head to a park. Unbeknownst to his wife Leslie (Amy Hargreaves), Scott was laid off eight months ago and is trying to find work. We see that he's trying to sell personal items to raise cash.

The guys stake out Scott's house and see him get a call about a temp job. Finch hacks his computer and sees that he's politically-motivated and doesn't seems to care for a Congressman named Delancey. Finch finds a huge encrypted file.

At their request, Carter looked up Scott in the system and finds he's clean, though he's recently filed for a gun permit. Finch and Reese watch him arrive at work for what seems to be a fundraiser for Delancey. Finch finally gets into the file and sees that Scott has been sending Delancey death threats -- he is about to assassinate the Congressman.

Reese and Finch follow Scott into the fundraiser, but Reese is unable to bring his gun and dumps it prior to going throught the magnatometer scan. As Reese searches for Scott, Finch sees on his phone that the threatening E-mails are being flagged. Finch realizes that the E-mails didn't originate from Scott's computer, indicating that he's being framed. Reese tackles Scott, but finds he's holding nothing more than confetti. At that exact moment someone else shoots Delancey. Reese chases after the shooter while everybody points at Scott. He's been set-up.

Finch realizes that a sophisticated hacker has worked on Scott's computer. This means they need to look for the real killers.

Reese explains to Carter that Scott (who is in her precinct) was set-up. She watches his interrogation. The staffing agency is bogus and security cameras at the fundraiser seems to have been manipulated. Carter tells the guys that Delancey died in the hospital, meaning Scott's now looking at Murder One.

Scott calls wife Leslie while the police search their home and tells her he didn't do it. She asks ""you have another computer?""

Reese tells Finch that in most cases patsies like Scott are killed to tie up the loose end. Finch has discovered the email that allowed the hacker into Scott's computer and uses it to try and find them. He finds out the hacker is looking at a court house floor plan downtown. Carter calls Reese to tell him the FBI are taking him to that same court house.

Reese intercepts the car and grabs Scott himself. At the same time the hacker tricks Finch and gets into his system and all of his devices. They must discard their phones.

Finch buys a disposable cell phone and leaves a number on an answering service. They speak and Finch tells Reese he's bringing in a political specialist.

Finch meets with their old buddy Zoe (Paige Turco from The Fix (2011)). She seems willing to help them find out who would want to kill Delancey.

The feds tell Leslie about her husband's secret unemployment and show her their financial statements.

Zoe and Finch figure out that Delancey's campaign manager Matheson had ran his former business during the campaign. Delancey's construction business is now under investigation by the DA's office for payoffs and corner-cutting. They think Matheson's plan was to kill Delancey and blame him for everything.

The assassin who killed Delancey tries to break into the hotel room where Reese is keeping Scott. They are able to get away.

Zoe confronts Matheson (Damian Young). She tells him she's a fixer and thinks he could probably use her services. She mentions setting up Delancey and leaves her card.

Matheson calls the hacker to complain about the fact Scott is still alive. She tells him that everything will be fine and calls her muscle. She shows him where Scott is located on a locater.

On the subway Reese pulls a tracking device the tread of one of Scott's shoes. Scott is getting nervous about ever being able to go back to his family. When Reese can't promise him they'll live, he says he wants to talk to his wife.

Through Carter Reese is able to arrange for Scott to speak with Leslie for a few minutes.

Reese lures the hacker's enforcer into a bathroom and beats him silly. He grabs the man's cell phone.

Scott turns himself in.

The hacker calls her muscle's cell phone. Finch answers and says the whole operation is over. We see the hacker start typing a note.

Carter is E-mailed proof that Matheson was behind the murder. Police find Matheson dead in front of his computer... the message the hacker typed, a suicide note, is on the screen.

Scott is returned home to his family safely. Zoe meets up with Reese and asks him to buy her a drink.

Reese finds a home invasion-looking situation at Darren's place. The Super tells Reese, posing as a cop, that Darren's older brother Travis was recently shot and killed, and that Darren was taken by the police.

Carter gives Reese the particulars of the case: Darren watches his brother/legal guardian die of two point-blank gunshot wounds while waiting for the police. And Darren is missing.

The officer who has the case tells Carter Travis got into an altercation at the fried chicken restaurant where he works just before he was killed. Three males were hassling a girl and Travis threw them out after getting into it with one of them. The feeling is that they followed Travis home and killed him.

Reese tells Finch he thinks Darren could be in danger if he's a potential witness.

Reese finds the girl, Lisa (Aja Naomi King), Travis was helping that night, and she reluctantly points him to a comic store.

Reese spots a kid (Brick) leaving the comic store with what looks like Travis' work hat. Reese calls Carter and follows him. He sees Darren approach and pull out a gun. Reese steps in just before he can pull the trigger. Reese takes Darren and suspect Brick's phone.

Darren tells Reese his brother tried to keep him away from crime. Reese leaves him with Fusco and looks through some sketches in his notebook.

Brick tells Carter he found the hat ""on the street."" He seems pretty knowledgeable about the legal process.

After looking through Darren's pictures Reese watches some kids playing basketball. Friends are texting Brick. He writes back as Brick and figures out which kid is Curtis. Curtis is driving a Cadillac and making some transaction. Reese tells Finch there is some kind of sophisticated operation taking place.

We see Finch meet with Will, his former partner's son. Will shows him a napkin of his father's he has found. It contained a champagne cork and had ""Day 1: The Machine"" written on it along with a date. The date corresponds with the time his father left his business and signed the $1 contract with the government. He also found the name Alicia Corwin in the files. She worked at the White House and was in touch with his father. He tracked down Alicia, who is living in a remote West Virginia town that blocks cellular and wireless signals.

Fusco calls Reese with word that Darren has disappeared. Based on a drawing in his notebook Reese suspects he's going to be a bar called ""Ferdy's.""

Darren walks into Ferdy's and ""calls out"" Curtis and Trim. Some other guys don't take kindly to Darren and Reese is forced to come to the rescue.

Darren thinks Reese is a Ronin, a masterless samurai who helps people. He gives Reese his last few bucks, wanting to hire him to ""take out"" the guys who killed his brother. Reese turns him down, but when Darren says there is no way to stop him from going after the kids. Reese says he'll do it ""my way,"" which means no killing.

Reese observes two of the guys running a kind of protection/numbers game connected with the police. Reese steals their SUV to ""shake them up a bit."" They then see the guys talking about a higher-up named Andre and a ""big money run"" taking place that night.

Carter is being pressured by her Captain to let Brick go, since she's still unable to charge him.

Andre happens to be the comic book store owner all the kids love. Andre sends Curtis and Trim to get a half million dollars.

Reese smashes the stolen car into the guys' new one. He puts Curtis in the back of a police car covered in empty beer bottles. Reese hangs on to Trim and begins burning Andre's money to get him to talk. He tells Reese where to find the weapon used to murder Travis.

Will meets with Alicia. Finch listens from afar. She tells him a bogus story about him getting bailed out by the government in exchange for a few of his patents. Alicia tells him to ""let it go."" When Will makes reference to his dad's best friend she runs off.

Andre meets with a corrupt captain who tells him to ""fix it."" Andre wants help getting Brick out of custody.

Carter is told to let Brick go.

Reese and Darren find the gun.

Reese calls Carter to tell her about finding the murder weapon. Reese promises to bring Darren in, then turns around to find he's bolted with the gun.

Darren shows up at the comic book store and pulls the gun on Andre and Brick.

Outside Reese prepares to go in with a beanbag shotgun.

Inside Andre tells Darren to shoot Brick, implying that afterwards he could come for him. Darren doesn't shoot.

Reese comes inside and manages to drop Brick. Andre leaves with the gun at Darren's head. Outside Fusco and Carter help take Andre down. In the process Fusco takes a bullet in the butt trying to protect Darren.

Will tells Finch he's leaving again.

It looks as if Darren is headed to foster care. Reese pulled some strings and got Darren into a charter school for the arts.

Fusco did some digging for Reese and found out Finch's real name and that he was an MIT graduate who has been using a fake name for 35 years."

Cahill is a smuggler working for a dangerious guy named Neil Vargas (José Zúñiga). Reese poses as the driver for a job moving diamonds and we see that Cahill doesn't have any patience for mistakes.

Reese follows Cahill and watches him seemingly break into the home of a police officer named Tully. But inside he hugs a child (Skylar Gaertner) and kisses the mother, Melinda (Jill Paice). Tully (Michael Aronov) is working deep undercover as ""Cahill.""

Flashback to 2008: Reese, a CIA mission, has grabbed somebody Agent Snow (Michael Kelly) tells Reese is accused of selling software to the Chinese. While waiting for orders Reese is given some R&R in New York, where they are working.

In present day we learn that Tully has been undercover for nine years. Finch worries that someobody may have found out he's a cop. Tully meets with his Internal Affairs Bureau (Skipp Sudduth) handler who tells him they have enough on Vargas to pull him out of the operation. Tully says that the real target is ""L.O.S."" who is picking up the next shipment in person. This is apparently the ""big one."" He tells his handler that Vargas has a cop on the payroll.

Snow goes to see Carter and tells her they know Reese is working with a cop. He talks about Reese using people and makes reference to a past partner of Reese's. Finch shows up after Snow leaves and tells Carter that there is a leak that could jeopardize Tully's life. She tells him the handler is the only person who would know Tully is undercover. Files are kept in hard copy only and in one location, H.R., guarded by Internal Affairs.

Reese tells Fusco what's happening and asks him for some help.

At the next meeting Vargas gets a phone call that upsets him. He says he still wants to continue because if they don't finish the mission ""L.O.S."" will kill them. The deal goes south and Vargas' team opens fire. They end up leaving with the drugs but one of the guys, Ajax (Robin Lord Taylor), is shot and seriously wounded.

Afterwards Vargas has them make a pitstop and tells everyone to destroy their phones and give up their guns. Vargas then says ""one of you is a cop"" and vows to find out over the next few hours.

Back to the '08 flashback: Reese sits at a bar and strikes up a conversation with a man who turns out to be the husband of his ex-wife.

Finch calls Carter and tells her he's lost touch with Reese. He sends her a license plate number.

Using the wounded Ajax's cell phone Tully manages to send a text to his handler with his whereabouts.

Fusco asks about Vargas. Finch calls him with instructions to get into the H.R. room where Tully's records are held. He gets in and destroys the file. But Fusco is caught by Davidson (Reg E. Cathey), the head of H.R. who places him under arrest.

In the car Fusco starts to explain the situation. But Davidson gets a call from Vargas. He tells Vargas that a call was made from that location, then knocks Fusco unconscious.

Reese places the phone into his own pocket, taking the heat for Tully when Vargas dials the number. Reese is promptly hit over the back of the head. Reese is interrogated. Tully asks for time alone with Reese, who tells him he knows all about his story, including that the name of his wife and son, and that his brother OD'd. Reese says he can help him get home. Tully wants to stay under and try to bust ""L.O.S."" Vargas returns and wants to kill Reese. Tully says he wants to do it and shoots Reese in the shoulder.

Back in '08 Reese's partner, Cara Stanton (Annie Parisse), wants to know why he's snooping around Peter, the new hubby of his ex. She tells him that Peter could take better care of his ex than he could and should leave them alone. Peter wants to introduce Reese to his wife, since they're from the same town. Reese's partner convinces Reese to leave.

Reese and the more seriously wounded Ajax are placed in the trunk of a car, which is set on fire. Tully manages to slip Reese a flashlight that helps him escape at the last moment. Carter arrives and Reese tells her that Tully only grazed him. Finch calls and Reese tells him Tully is headed for the pick-up in Brooklyn. Finch tells him about Fusco and says he's not sure if they have time to save them both.

At the meet Tully grabs ""L.O.S."" (Michael Berresse) and puts a gun to his head. Vargas points a gun at Tully, but Reese and Carter arrive in the nick of time to gun down Vargas and the rest of the ""L.O.S."" team. Reese knocks ""L.O.S."" out and tells Tully that the guy is CIA and taking him in will only jeopardize his career. Tully says he's doing it anyway.

Davidson places Fusco on the ground and is about to kill him. ""You think you're the first person to put a gun to my head?"" Fusco says without turning a hair. Davidson responds, ""No, but I will be the last.""

At the last second Reese shows up and shoots Davidson, saving Fusco's life. But Reese destroys the dead cop's phone and tells Fusco they need him to remain dirty. Fusco is ""more useful inside.""

Finch and Reese, watching from a car as Tully takes his wife to the hospital to have their second baby, discuss the fact ""L.O.S."" is about to be released.

Snow picks up ""L.O.S."" at the station. ""L.O.S."" wants Carter and Tully taken out, but instead Snow has ""L.O.S."" killed right there inside a CIA SUV.

Fusco buries Davidson and gets help from another dirty cop Simmons (Robert John Burke). He tells Fusco that he ""belongs to H.R. now."""

Adam Saunders (Matt Lauria) is a prop trader who has already had some contact with the SEC over insider trading.

One of Saunders' co-workers is telling him he's been hand-chosen to invest the money of a ""whale,"" with Reese assuming the role of the investor's asset manager. Reese shows him they will start with $128 million which he refers to as ""pocket change."" On a nearby television screen a reporter (Carolina Bermudez) says that the murder trial of Virtanen CEO Robert Keller (Brian Murray from The Fix (2011)) is wrapping up. Saunders apparently short-sold the stock in anticipation of Keller being found guilty. A top partner, Sydney Baylor (Noelle Beck), thinks it was risky and co-worker Victor (Austin Lysy) thinks he was stupid. When Keller is found guilty, Saunders' financial acumen earns millions for his clients.

Reese is unable to clone Saunders' phone, which Finch thinks means somebody else may already be watching him in the same manner.

Saunders drives Reese to a bar and tells him about his philosophy of research and risk.

Finch breaks into Saunders' apartment and finds a closet full of cash.

At the bar a drunken Victor yells at Saunders because her now has to explain to clients what happened with their stock portfolios. He takes a swing at Saunders and a fight ensues. Afterwards Reese observes that Saunders heads to Sydney's place and it's clear they are romantically involved.

Finch has found that Saunders mother died when he was young and he was adopted by her brother, Robert ""Uncle Bob"" Sowalski (John Scurti). No father in the picture. It looks as if Saunders and Sydney are more than just a fling.

Finch has limited access to Saunders' phone, meaning anybody else who was listening will have to get much closer.

They get word to Carter about looking into some records. Finch wants her to go to the SEC and looks at a sealed record related to Saunders.

We see an SEC investigator, Rasmussen (Scott Cohen) find Saunders on the street and promise him that he'll eventually ""get you, kid."" Finch learns that Rasmussen looked at top-tier execs at his firm for insider trading but all charges were dropped. Saunders may have lied to protect his bosses.

We see Saunders talk his ""Uncle Bob,"" owner of a several food trucks and has money invested with Saunders' firm. Uncle Bob is curious about a limited partnership called Tri-Tech Energy. Uncle Bob thinks there is too much money being invested in Tri-Tech.

Finch's money has been deposited by Saunders' firm.

Saunders asks another member of the firm, Paul Ashton (David Furr), about Tri-Tech and he brushes him off. He doesn't like how closely Saunders has been looking into it. Sidney asks about Saunders' meeting with Rasmussen. She thinks the firm can't take another SEC embarrassment.

When Saunders realizes how much Reese knows about his life he gets upset. He says he wants somebody else to handle Reese's employer and drives him home. On the way they go through a construction site which Reese thinks looks fishy. At the last minute Reese forces him to punch the gas and narrowly avoids being crushes by a truck.

Reese tells Finch he thinks the construction site incident was a professional hit attempt. Saunders thinks it was an accident. The majority of Finch's money is being invested in Tri-Tek, which is involved in the construction of a natural gas pipeline from the Gulf to upstate New York.

Finch pretends to be an SEC investigator and meets with Uncle Bob. He learns that Saunders's father moved West and never came back. The only contact was that every month his father would send Saunders $200. But instead of spending it on kids' stuff, Saunders saved every dime and eventually used it to pay for night school.

Rasmussen wants to talk to Saunders about Tri-Tek. Saunders admits he ran some numbers that make him thinks there is no good reason for so much money to be invested in the company. He has the info on a laptop.

Saunders goes up to the office to get his laptop and is called to the rooftop by Sydney for a meeting. Finch is able to see this and directs Reese up there. Reese ends up saving Saunders from being tossed over the edge by a masked man. Reese takes him inside and tells him they need to get him someplace safe.

Carter finds out that a bunch of utility trucks were stolen recently, including the one used in the previous evening's hit attempt on Saunders.

Sydney has been killed. Reese and Saunders spot a wine bottle on the ground that may have been the murder weapon. Saunders drank from the bottle a few days earlier and Reese realizes the plan is to frame him. Reese takes him out of there just as the police are arriving.

At the murder scene the investigator tells Carter the only way to plant the bottle would have been to go through the apartment building's garbage. She recalls that a garbage truck was one of the ones which were stolen.

Reese takes Saunders to a homeless encampment. He tells Saunders that he slept there for four months at one point and tells him to stick with a woman named Joan. Saunders thinks that Reese should look at Victor.

A bill passes the New York legislature that allows for shale fracking in the state. This means there is no need for a pipeline like the one provided by Tri-Tek. Millions of Tri-Tek investor dollars will be lost.

Reese grabs Victor and asks him what happened. Victor says he thought Tri-Tek was a safe investment, but someone powerful must have gotten to the senators.

Saunders sees the headline on a newspaper and calls Reese. He says this is a short-sale, and to figure out who was in on it they need to find who is buying back shares to cover the short.

Saunders calls Uncle Bob, who says his entire company was in Tri-Tek. Saunders apologizes and promises to get all the money back. Somebody shady overhears this conversation.

Finch figures out that Saunders' buddy Paul was in on it to the tune of 4 million shares. Saunders tells Reese that Paul isn't capable of doing it without somebody helping him from inside the SEC.

Paul and Rasmussen meet. Rasmussen is apparently upset the SEC is toothless and decided to get in on the corruption. They discuss Saunders being a loose end, but Rasmussen says he has it under control.

Reese talks to Saunders about his father and the $200 payments. Saunders talks about going to find him when he was 16 years old. His father blew him off, trying to give him more money. All Saunders wanted was family. When Reese realizes Saunders spoke to Uncle Bob he knows they're in trouble. Three men with automatic weapons open fire in the homeless camp. Reese is able to kill two of them and allows Saunders to escape.

Finch and Reese realize that the muscle involved was bigger than Paul and Rasmussen. Finch points out there is still time to foil the plot and tells Reese they need to get Saunders back to work.

Victor tells Paul that an anonymous person is buying up millions of shares of Tri-Tek. All his has is a phone number. Paul calls the number and gets Finch, who directs him to ""my banker."" He connects Paul directly to Saunders on the other side of the room. He says that he and his investor have invigorated Tri-Tek and that Paul will be going to jail. Both Paul and Rasmussen are arrested, led out in handcuffs and put into police cars.

Saunders and Uncle Bob have a tender family moment.

Saunders ends up buying the homeless camp and bringing Uncle Bob's trucks to feed the people. Reese thanks Joan (Deidre O'Connell) for looking out for him.

Carter is told that Rasmussen has been found dead in his apartment. She's confused, given that they were both taken into custody. She looks at some surveillance video image of a uniformed officer placing Paul in a squad car and letting Rasmussen go, then placing something into a trash can and looking right at the camera as he does it. Carter retrieves the phone from the trash and brings it to Reese. He dials the number and Elias (Enrico Colantoni) answers: ""Hello, John. It's been a long time."""

Reese jumps into Carter's car outside the prison where Moretti (Mark Margolis) is being released. Figuring that there's trouble a head since Reese has shown up, she tells him that she has been authorized to offer Moretti protection in return for how to find Elias. A car pulls up and Carter gets out while Reese checks in with Finch. Finch tells his partner that they have a new number that was issued to a Leila Smith by the Social Security Administration just two months earlier. He figures that it's either a case of identity fraud or a new citizen, but all he has is a work address which plans to check out.

When Reese says that they need to focus on Moretti, Finch reminds him that the numbers won't wait.

Carter pulls Moretti over as he leaves and tells him that Elias is looking for him. Unimpressed, he tells her ""I don't see him."" She offers to put him somewhere safe, but he dismisses her offer and is driven away by his men.

Finch goes to the address, St. Raymond's Clinic, slips inside, disables the security cameras, and checks the computer records. He's surprised to discover that Leila isn't an employee but a patient.

Carter and Reese follow Moretti as he drives out to his home in the woods.

Finch poses as a doctor and tells the nurse that he's there to check on Leila's bronchitis. He's surprised when Nurse Mary Abbott (Leslie Silva) shows him that Leila is a six-month-old safe haven baby. Dr. Marcus Adalian had found Leila abandoned outside the clinic, and Mary applied for the Social Security number on Leila's behalf. Due to her bronchitis, she hasn't been adopted yet. Once the nurse leaves, Finch contemplates the baby and wonders who would want to hurt her. He looks outside and sees two suspicious-looking men dressed as interns, and notices that they're wearing street shoes.

Finch calls Reese and says that he has a situation, but Reese says that he has problems of his own. An accident is blocking the road ahead. Moretti tells his driver to drive around the scene even as a distraught woman (Meghan O'Leary-Clark) kneeling next to a supine body of a motorcyclist cries ""Please, can you help us?"" As the pull abreast of the accident, a truck rams them and the fake accident victims pull out guns and shoot Moretti's bodyguards, but Carter and Reese arrive and shoot the three assailants down. They get Moretti out and leave before reinforcements can arrive.

That night, Carter takes Moretti to a safehouse where Detective Szymanski (Michael McGlone) is waiting for them. When Moretti wonders if he has to stay there, Carter tells him that he can leave if he wants but Elias will send other killers after him. The Mafia don considers his situation and reluctantly nods that he will remain there.

Carter leaves and finds Reese waiting for her outside. She tells him that she's cleared the safehouse with a few good cops like Szymanski. ""Elias doesn't own the entire department,"" Carter and thanks Reese for his help and tells him to stay out of trouble. They smile at one another.

Once she leaves, Reese checks in with Finch ""to see how things are going."" Finsh says, ""O, they are going."" When Reese updates him and asks what happened to his number, Finch admits that he did ""something rather rash..."" and glances at Leila, in a car seat in his front seat.

The next morning, Reese meets Finch at the library and realizes that he took Leila with him. Finch figures that someone planned to abduct Leila and dump her in an orphanage outside of the country. He's checked the clinic records and discovered it had received anonymous donations of $50,000 when Leila was born and $10,000 every month since then.

Finch has sent an IRS E-mail to get the clinic to reveal the donor's tax ID number, or have their charitable status face review. They discover that Leila's abduction has been reported and that there's an Amber Alert out. Finch meets with Carter while shopping for baby supplies and explains that he took Leila to keep the men from kidnapping her. He assures her that Leila is safe with Reese, but they both agree that they should resolve things. Finch asks her to go to the clinic and find out Leila's real parents, and recommends that she interview Mary. The cashier (Maria-Christina Oliveras) sees them together and assumes that Finch and Carter are the parents.

Dirty cop Simmons (Robert John Burke) meets with a donut-eating Fusco at the station and tells him that Carter was there on some kind of off-book operation. HR wants to find Moretti and they want Fusco to use Carter to get to Moretti.

Carter, posing as a member of Special Victims Unit, talks to Mary and Dr. Adalian (Karl Kenzler). He insists that they have no records on Leila and walks off, but Carter sees that Mary is concerned and gives the nurse her card before she goes.

Finch shows Reese how to change Leila when the clinic accounts send the tax ID on the donor. It came from Adnan Petrosian, who owns Petrosian Construction. Adnan has been married to Nicola for over 20 years and has an adult sons Bradley who is studying finance at NYU. Finch tells Reese to get close to the Petrosians, and Reese is soon at the house watching. He listens in and hears Adnan (Scott Bryce) complaining about how much money he's spent extricating Bradley (Erich Bergen) from trouble. Bradley assures him that everything has been taken care of, and Reese reasons that Bradley's parents are covering for him.

Mary calls Carter but Fusco takes the call first. The nurse is nervous when Fusco says that she's called Homicide, not SVU, but Carter gets on the line and tells her not to worry about it, that Fusco ""is new here."" Mary explains that Leila had a silver bracelet initials ""C.C."" were engraved on it when she arrived, and gave it to Adalian who now claims he doesn't remember it. She calls Finch with the information, and he uses his ""hacking"" skills to reveal that the receptionist in Petrosian Construction's head office is named Claudia Cruz. Her employment ended eight months ago, right when her pregnancy would have shown, and Carter confirms that she died in a home fire four days ago.

Finch and Reese meet with Carter and bring Leila with them. They tell Carter what they know and wonder why Claudia ended up dead. If Claudia decided she wanted to keep Leila, DNA would have revealed who the father was and he would have had to pay support. Carter has checked the crime scene reports and wants to check with a mentor of hers with the fire department. Reese will follow Bradley while Finch checks with Claudia's parents.

Finch claims to be with Family Services and talks to Claudia's parents Veda (Maria Elena Ramirez) and Sammy (Juan Carlos Hernandez). When Finch says that they've received an anonymous report that Claudia was pregnant, the Cruzs insist that they would have known. However, they never saw her after she moved into the new apartment, and Sammy admits that Claudia was reluctant to come around. Claudia had a silver bracelet with her initials on it and the parents ask to see the baby. Finch says that he might be able to arrange a meeting, and Veda shows him papers that Claudia left there a month before she died. Among them is a photo of Bradley.

Reese continues following Bradley and sees him meet with another young man... his lover. Reese figures that clears him and heads out to check on Adnan. Finch checks on Leila and realizes that the infant has crawled away.

Carter and her FDNY mentor Novak (Sol Landerman) go over the remains of Claudia's apartment. According to the autopsy, Claudia was drinking and passed out. However, Novak confirms that someone tampered with the fire alarm. The X-rays show that Claudia was knocked unconscious from a blow to the head, and the fire was set afterward. She finds a lamp and Novak says that the heat could have etched the fingerprints into the metal, identifying the killer.

Reese returns to help a panicking Finch find Leila. She has crawled off into the shelves and found one of Reese's tear gas grenades. Reese gets it away from her and Finch figures that they need to have Claudia's parents watch Leila. He tells Reese that he's moved Sammy and Veda to a safehouse.

When Carter returns to her desk, Fusco asks what case she's working and she tells him about the fire. She gets a call from Szymanski and then asks Fusco to take the lamp to the crime lab. Fusco points out that Szymanski is in Organized Crime and assures her he has her back. Carter lies and says that Szymanski asked her out on a date, and asks Fusco to keep it quiet.

Reese and Finch drive to the safehouse where Reese goes in first. He discovers that a masked man has tied up the Cruz couple. Reese gets the drop on him but the intruder still manages to get away. When he goes back to the car, Reese discovers that someone has knocked Finch out and abducted Leila.

While Veda tends to Finch's injury, Reese confirms that the kidnappers put a GPS tracker on the couple's car. Finch tells them to get their things so they can move them again, and Reese figures that if they don't get Leila by sunset, her abductors will have her out of the country. He grabbed a medallion from the intruder confirming that he's an East European criminal, and promises Finch he'll do what he has to so he can get Leila back.

Carter goes back to the safehouse and tells Moretti that they're trying to keep a low profile on where he's being kept. Detective Kane (Anthony Mangano) calls to tell her that the fingerprints match with a perp from a road rage incident ten years ago.

Reese bursts into the Petrosian house, grabs Adnan, and demands to know where Leila is. After subduing a security guard, he shows Adnan the medallion and asks where the man to whom it belongs can be found. Adnan admits that he had an affair with Claudia, but he had nothing to do with her death or Leila's abduction. Carter sends a text message to Reese telling him that the fingerprints on the murder weapon belong to Nicola (Kate Hodge), and Reese tells her that he knows what she's done. Nicole admits that she hired the men to abduct Leila, but she tells Reese that she can't call them off now. Adnan is shocked to learn that his wife went behind his back to kill his mistress, and Nicola boasts that there's nothing Reese can do to get Leila back. After a moment, Reese walks away.

Reese goes to bar and demands an answer from the patrons. Several of them prepare to attack him and Reese just smiles.

Fusco follows Carter to the safehouse and sees her with Moretti.

Reese takes out the men and tells the first one to talk. The crook says that the baby has been handed over and there's nothing that can be done to find her. Reese goes back to the library and tells Finch that there's only one man who knows the underworld and can find Leila. He asks for the burner phone that Elias sent them and figures that the crime lord will meet with him out of curiosity.

Elias (Enrico Colantoni) has his men bring Reese to meet him, and Reese reminds him that he saved his life. The crime lord concedes that he owes Reese a favor, but is also aware that Reese took out the thugs who tried to kill Moretti. Reese tells him that someone has killed a mother and taken her child, just like someone killed Elias' mother. He tells Elias that if criminals start targeting children, then there are no rules and Elias can't keep control. After a moment, Elias agrees to help and says that the Eastern Europeans will hand Leila to the Mexicans to move her out of the country, and Reese asks Elias to get him to the meeting.

Scarface (David Valcin) drops off Reese and gives him his guns back, and then tells him the address where the handoff is going down. The next morning, the abductors arrive at the meeting and prepare to hand off Leila. A van drives out of a warehouse and they open fire, but they realize that there's nobody in it. Reese kneecaps one of the Europeans and tells the Mexicans to walk away. They make a hasty exit and the head abductor tells Reese to surrender or he'll kill Leila. Reese shoots him down and picks up the baby, but Scarface and his men arrive, capture Reese, and smash his phone. Scarface reveals that Elias has had a change of heart.

Elias arrives and takes Leila, and explains that he'll trade her for Moretti. When Reese says that he doesn't know where Moretti is, Elias locks Reese and Leila into a refrigerated truck and turns on the cooling unit, and leaves him with a radio to contact him if he changes his mind.

Simmons asks Fusco if he has anything on Carter, and he tells the HR man that he learned she had a pizza. The crooked cop reminds Fusco that he has a murder victim to hold over him and tells the detective to find Moretti.

The temperature inside the refrigerated truck continues to drop and Reese tries to break free.

Carter invites Fusco to help her arrest Nicola Petrosian. Before they can leave, Finch calls to tell Carter that he lost Reese and gives her the last known address. She tells Fusco that something has come up and invites him to arrest Nicola on his own.

Desperate, Reese finally breaks loose and picks up Leila, holding her tight. Meanwhile, Finch arrives at the rendez-vous and finds the dead men and the empty bag that had held Leila.

With Leila weakening by the moment, Reese finally calls Elias and tells him that he's won. When Reese asks what guarantee he has that Elias will release him, Elias says that he doesn't have a guarantee. Reese gives him an address in Queens and Elias admits that he could never harm a child, but he knew that Reese wouldn't either. He says goodbye and drops the keys to the handcuffs in. Once he removes them, Reese breaks open the door, gets into a cab, and turns up the heat. Finch drives up and Reese tells him to tend to Leila while he goes after Elias.

Carter is en route when Reese tells her that Elias knows where Moretti is. She calls Szymanski and tells him to get Moretti out.

Finch gets back to the library and calls Reese. He's at the safehouse with Carter and they discover that Szymanski has been shot. As they tend to his wound, Reese admits that he gave up the address to save Leila, but she says that he should have called the police and that she can't help Finch and Reese anymore. Carter tells Reese to get out before the police arrive and he quickly leaves.

That night, Finch and Reese turn Leila over to the Cruzs. They watch and Reese wonders if they'll ever have children, and Finch warns that the problem with children is that you never know how they're going to turn out.

Elias has Moretti brought to him and greets him: ""Hello, Dad...."""

Based on the social security number he's finding two completely separate digital footprints under the name Jordan Hester. The footprint is small, so he doesn't even know if the person is a man or woman. They assume Hester is leading a double life.

Carter drops by the scene of a 17-year old African American male killed over a girl. The shooter confessed, saying it was the police's fault because they were there to stop him. She is ignoring Reese's phone calls.

Finch and Reese split up to investigate the two Hester addresses. The two apartments are dramatically different. Reese goes to a bar and sees that Hester is a man working as a bar back. Simultaneously a woman comes home the apartment he's been looking through. She is also Jordan Hester. It's two people living one life.

With no theft involved, Reese and Finch realize this isn't the typical identity theft case.

Reese asks Fusco to look into Jordan Hester's record, giving him photos of both people.

An FBI agent named Donnelly stops by to see Carter. He's asking about Reese and wants to meet with her to see what else she knows.

Reese looks into a third apartment connected to Hester. Inside he finds what seems to be a lab for making ecstasy. A man jumps out and Reese quickly knocks him unconscious. Finch thinks use of a fake name would be critical to making ecstasy.

Reese leaves behind a camera in the lab and we see the cook tell another man what happened. They reference a ""boss"" who they've never seen.

Finch interacts with the female Hester at a bookstore. He follows her out of the store and sees several large men following her. At the same time Reese sees that the male Hester is connected to the drugs, meaning the female Hester is caught up in a misunderstanding based on her name being on the lease of the apartment where drugs are being made. Finch helps get her away from the danger.

Reese sees the male Hester tells the cooks that they need to re-locate.

Fusco calls Reese to tell him that one of Hester's distributors was picked-up on a drug charge, but couldn't connect him to a boss.

Finch tells the female (real) Hester about the identity theft being connected to drugs. He tells her he's a private investigator, hired by another victim, and will get the police involved as soon as they have evidence.

Fusco meets with a detective named Franklin who handles identity theft. He tells him about the drugs, and Franklin tells him about a guy named Morrison who was arrested for making ecstasy but claimed he was innocent.

In the male Hester's van Reese finds a laptop. He sees how-to tips about using guns. At the same time the female Hester tells Finch she needs to leave, saying she's a buyer of antiques. Finch agrees to go home with her so she can pack a bag.

Male Hester and his guys start their cook.

Morrison tells Fusco his identity was stolen about a year ago. Fusco says he'll try to get him out of jail. Morrison's life was ruined, his wife and daughter want nothing to do with it.

All of a sudden the male Hester tells the cooks they need to clear out of the place, as the cops are on their way.

Female Hester is lingering in her apartment. She wants to share a drink with Finch.

Morrison recognizes the same kinds of charges from the Hester identity. When Fusco shows him a picture of female Hester, he says her name was Mary and she was a receptionist at his accountant's office.

When the cooks figure out the male Hester doesn't know what he's talking about, they pull guns. At this point both Reese and Fusco let Finch know that the female Hester is the crook. He looks at his glass, seemingly drugged.

Reese steps in to save male Hester. He knocks out the cooks, but Hester pulls a gun on him. Reese convinces him that he's on his side. Hester said he's hit bottom and felt he had no choice to be the bad guy. His plan was to use the supply to lure the real drug dealer out. Reese agrees to help him.

Finch has been given ecstasy. He starts blabbing and Mary realizes he's been talking to somebody. He admits that the person he was speaking to was in her lab. She makes a call, then puts a chemical mixture of some kind in the microwave. Reese sends Fusco to help Finch.

Donnelly shows Carter some of Reese's background. He says they think he left the agency and his now selling his services to the highest bidder. They think he's working in organized crime, specifically for Elias' syndicate. He mentions Snow, and she asks why the FBI is interested. Donnelly says the goal is both to put one over on the CIA and catch Reese. He offers the bureau's support and asks if there is anything else she's like to share. She declines.

Fusco get to the apartment and turns off the microwave.

Mary and her thugs arrive at the lab. She tells the men to ""get rid of"" Hester and Reese. After she leaves Reese quickly turns the table on the henchmen.

Fusco tells Finch he's going to help him track down Eckhart, the accountant Mary worked for.

Cut to Mary meeting with Eckhart. She is clearly strong-arming him into helping with her identity theft. Reese shows up and sits at the table. He's got Mary's police file. Franklin arrives and places her under arrest. Fusco tells Reese he thinks HR had a piece of Mary's operation.

We see Carter looking through Reese's file looking conflicted. Her phone rings but she doesn't answer.

Finch tells Reese they have new numbers -- the heads of the Mafia's five families. Reese assumes Elias is targeting them in an attempt to take over organized crime in the city. Considering the collateral damage that could result, Reese wants them to babysit the dons.

Finch goes to the Brooklyn building where the dons hold a regular meeting and manages to install a listening device. We hear Moretti's son (who has taken over) asking about retaliating against Elias for kidnapping his father. The other dons aren't interested because they feel like he's brining in money. Reese thinks they need to let the dons know Elias will be coming after them.

Carter sees that Elias money was withdrawn in the form of cash and wire transfers. He's planning something big, it seems.

We see Elias is holding Moretti hostage. He tells his father he wants to keep him alive for the ""the show,"" which will be him uniting the families. Elias says the dons won't have a choice in the matter.

A cop with HR tells Fusco they want info on Reese. They're interested in what the feds know, so they can help Elias. He also tells Fusco that he should call in sick for a few days.

Reese tells one of the dons that he is in danger and the only way he'll be safe is if he comes with him. The don turns him down and is almost instantly killed by a car explosion.

We see a flashback to young Elias with the woman who raised him. He's struggling with his identity and wants to know more about his father and what happened to his mother.

Reese calls Elias and asks him to ""end this."" Elias thinks he's doing what is in the best interest of the city. Reese says he can't let him finish his plan without trying to interfere.

Finch tells Reese that Carter is looking into Elias, but isn't aware of the connection to the dons and HR. Reese leaves to try and protect her.

We see Carter attempt to place another of the dons into protective custody. The don is killed, but Reese shows up just in time to save her.

A teenage Elias tries to get work with Moretti. Moretti tells him he didn't know his father either and thinks that a hard life is the best way to achieve success. He tells Elias to keep his head up and there will always be a place for him.

Carter meets with Reese and Finch. She tells them about Elias making the transfers and her inability to access the accounts. Finch offers to use his resources to help and Reese gives her a military-issue weapon.

Reese follows one of the guys on Elias' payroll. He's following the families of the HR cops.

Carter and Fusco meet with the last three dons. They still aren't willing to accept her help. She pulls out a gun, planning to take them into custody by force. They have to shoot their way out of there. Finch calls and gives her a safe house location.

Elias talks to Moretti about his mother. It seems he witnessed her murder when he was four years old. Elias is told about Carter's intervention and he says they need to turn to their friends on the police force.

Finch tells Reese about Carter's plan with the dons. Reese then asks about Carter's son. We see one of the dirty HR cops take Taylor away, having told him his mother is in the hospital.

Finch calls Taylor's cell phone as the kid is headed to the car. The cop realized what's happening and grabs Taylor. Reese shows up gun blazing but can't get to Taylor before he's taken away.

Elias calls Carter and tells her he has her son. He will let Taylor go if she lets the dons go. He explains the evil that the dons perpetrate but she won't make the deal. Reese promises Carter he won't let them hurt Taylor. One of the dons tries to convince Carter that Fusco had something to do with her son being taken. Elias shows up at the safe house in person.

Finch meets with one of the HR cops named Simmons. He shows up pictures of Elias following the dirty cops' families, including the former rapist who has been watching Simmons' wife and kids. He warns him there is no telling what Elias will do once he has no use for HR. Finch asks him to find out the location of Taylor and severe their relationship with Elias.

Elias begins breaking into the safe house.

Several of Moretti's men take young Elias to be killed, referencing the murder of his mother along the way. Elias talks about his strength coming from being alone and kills both of the henchmen.

Finch bravely offers to help Reese get Taylor back, but Reese declines.

Elias breaks into the safe house just as Reese breaks into the place where both Taylor and Moretti are being held. While Reese battles through Elias' men, one of the dons takes Fusco's gun and points it at Fusco. He says he's made a deal with Elias. Carter places Elias under arrest, just before Taylor calls to say he's safe.

Carter thanks Reese and we watch as Elias is processed. Moretti and his son get into a car and a phone rings. It is Elias from prison, calling to tell them good-bye. The car explodes."

She wants know more about the cases they're working and he offers her the chance to work the next one with them. It turns out be a jealous girlfriend who they stop from shooting the woman with whom she's being cheated on.

HR higher-up NYPD Captain Lynch (Michael Mulheren) is interrogating a man who owes them money. He wants Fusco to go with the man to pick up the money.

Finch calls Reese to say there is a new number. Since Carter clearly doesn't trust Fusco, Reese wonders if they should tell her he's working with HR on their behalf. Reese thinks it'll be safer for both of them if she doesn't know. The next number is Tommy Clay (Pablo Schreiber), who works for Grayling Armored Services in the most dangerous position for making cash pick-ups, the hopper. Reese is being planted as a trainee with the company. Reese places a camera on the truck.

Back in 2010 Reese is being assigned to a mission in China. He wants time to take care of Jessica, but they have an important mission coming up. They're being assigned to retrieve a laptop that contains a delicate piece of software. Reese is told by Snow (Michael Kelly) he needs to kill his partner, Cara Stanton (Annie Parisse), after the pick-up. If he does that, he'll get all the leave he needs.

Fusco tells Reese that HR is acquiring street money at a rapid rate. Reese wants him to continue gathering intel.

Carter traces a license plate of the vehicle following the armored car to a pair of scumbags

Reese eats at a diner with the team, meeting their favorite waitress, Ashley.

Tommy tells Reese he'd been robbed once before and ended up with cracked ribs. But mostly the job is boring.

One of the pick-ups is for platinum to be used in pacemakers. They are transporting about $2.5 million worth in two cases. A bomb detonates below the truck, knocking them into the air. Tommy ends up shooting both Reese and the other employee.

Back in 2010 Reese and his partner aren't sure about their mission. They arrive and find dozens of dead bodies.

Reese wakes up in the hospital. Carter is there to meet him and takes him out of there. Tommy's bullet hit his vest. Carter's not sure why Tommy came out blasting.

Lynch has a job for Fusco. He wants him to pick up something in Brooklyn and ""failure is not an option.""

Tommy's wife says she never expected her husband would steal anything. When Carter shows her a stolen bracelet she realizes it wasn't for her, and must have been for a girlfriend.

Finch has figured out that Tommy is seeing Ashley on the side. The plan is to send him a picture of her that is embedded with spyware.

Reese goes to bursting into the burner home coordinates of Tommy' location. He finds dead bodies of Tommy's accomplices in the armored car heist and runs into Fusco.

Back in 2010 Reese and his partner find the Chinese software engineers gunned down. One of them tells Reese's partner somebody ""came and got The Machine"" in Chinese. She lies to Reese about what the man said and kills the wounded man.

Reese tells Fusco about Tommy being long-gone. Fusco thinks he'll be a dead man if he doesn't bring the guy back to Lynch.

Finch found records that indicate Ashley and Tommy are probably are on the move.

Fusco tells his HR contact that Tommy went rogue.

Reese drops in on Ashley, who says that Tommy was supposed to meet her but is a no-show. They were supposed to go to Cabo together. Finch has found a burner phone voicemail with information that indicates where Tommy is meeting his buyer.

Snow pays Carter a visit. He doesn't want them to speak with the police.

Back in 2010 Reese and his partner are unsure of what to think about the scene they came across.

Tommy and Ashley are partners. At some point Reese figures out that Tommy is both perp and victim. Ashley promptly shoots Tommy in the back, but can't bring herself to kill Reese. On her way out she's killed by Fusco and Lynch. When Lynch is about to kill Reese, Fusco shoots him with Ashley's gun.

Back in 2010 after she ""paints"" their pick-up area with cyalumes, Stanton then turns on Reese with her gun drawn; Snow had given her the same instruction he had given Reese! She tells him the agency wants everybody associated to the mission to be killed.

Instead of picking them us, the agency's ""rescue"" aircraft uses the cyalumes as a target indicator. Reese escapes just seconds before the ""friendly aerial attack"" kills his partner.

Special Agent Donnelly tells Carter about a new piece of DNA triggering something from a cold case. Donnelly thinks the murderer of a real estate developer named Peter Arndt could be his mystery man and wants her to help with the case.

Finch calls Carter and they agree to meet. She tells him about the case and Donnelly. Finch thinks she should help the case in order to help their ""mutual friend."" He had wanted to talk to her about something, but blows it off. The woman who waited on them was Garner.

Finch has Fusco look into Garner, who he thinks is probably using an alias. Finch tells him not to include Reese in this task.

Carter drops by Arndt's place. Donnelly says Arndt had been involved in some shady business dealings and was in with some loan sharks His wife was killed two months before he want missing. No body was ever found. Since the scene was so messy, Donnelly thinks it was his subject's first job.

Finch tries to find Garner at her place of work. A U.S. Marshal named Jennings follows Finch out of the bar and says Garner's name is actually Atkins, and she's a wanted fugitive. The Marshal starts asking a ton of questions and at the last minute Reese shows up pretending to be a cop to get Finch, who he tells Jennings is his ""C.I.,"" out of the situation.

Finch, telling Reese he wanted to keep him out of this case because of certain ""sensibilities,"" thinks Garner lives with her threat, as her number kept popping up every few months.

Reese drops by to see Garner. She pulls a gun on him and he says he can help her. She says her real name is Sarah and Finch calls with word that her last name is Jennings -- the husband she's running from is the Marshal. Reese tells Sarah he can make it so she doesn't have to run anymore.

Carter is shown the Arndts' accident report.

Carter is shown Jessica's x-rays. It seems as if her husband actually killed her after she had called Reese and then staged the car accident to cover it up.

Finch tells Reese Jennings has been in trouble for excessive force and had trumped-up the charges on Sarah to help track her down. Reese promises he'll show Jennings ""what a real monster looks like.""

Reese walks into the Marshal NYC field office and coolly, single-mindedly, muscles his way to Jenning's area. He puts a gun to Jennings' head and says if he comes after Sarah again he'll kill him. Finch sees that Sarah has snuck out the window of her safe house.

Sarah tries to purchase a train ticket. When the cashier acts strangely, she bolts but several officers grab her as she attempts to access the departing trains platform and hold her until Jennings shows up.

Finch uses a WiFi detector to locate Jennings' car. He's trying to take Sarah out of the city.

Carter and Donnelly pay a visit to Jessica's mother, who wasn't aware of the kind of trouble Arndt had been. Donnelly hears about Reese tearing up the Marshal's office and leaves. Carter calls Finch. She seems surprised that they weren't able to intervene before Arndt killed Jessica. Jessica's mother references a ""fling"" Jessica had with a soldier before Arndt. She gives Carter permission to look through Jessica's things. Carter finds a photograph of Jessica and a uniformed Reese together.

Reese breaks down the door, quickly disables Jennings and tells Sarah to leave. A bloodied Jennings tells Reese it will never be over between him and Sarah. Reese says ""it's over for you"" and knocks him out.

Carter pulls Reese over on a lonely stretch or road and asks to look in his trunk. She wants him to let her take Jennings in. He wants to take care of the situation and ""do what needs to be done."" She lets him go.

Alicia gives Peck a call. He references a report he wrote. Her advice to him is ""run.""

Finch is thinking that they need to treat Peck like has a disease. Whoever he speaks to is in danger. Peck has given them the slip.

Peck has cashed out his bank accounts. Reese think the man he fought with is probably former Black ops.

The assassin calls a superior and mentions the problem with Reese.

Peck tries to break into the NSA. Reese comes to his rescues and battles it out with the assassin's team. Meanwhile Peck throws a bottle at an NYPD cruiser and turns himself in.

Back in 2009 Nathan asks about contingency if the Government abuses it. Nathan wants a backdoor, or off-switch for the machine. We see them execute a system shutdown.

Peck tells Fusco about the Government wanting a machine to watching everyone. After he leaves Reese walks in dressed as a police officer and sneaks the two of them out. Finch thinks to keep Peck alive they must stop him from acquiring evidence. Peck makes a call to an organization that protects whistle-blowers, but unfortunately one of the people who knows about the machine works in D.C.

The assassination team fires on Reese's car, flipping it over. Reese recovers in time to kill the assassin, but Peck escapes. Reese wonders what they can do, since Peck will never stop.

Back in 2009 we see Nathan fire the machine back up and fiddle with its settings.

Somebody orders that Peck and a reporter he's scheduled to meet to be ""silenced."" Reese stops them while Finch meets with Peck. He tells him that the machine ""is a mystery you do not want to solve."" Finch says the machine cost him something more important than his life. He gives Peck the ability to run away (a new identity with a passport, bank account, etc.) and tells him to forget about the machine. He tells him that he was the one who built the machine and leaves.

Reese goes to Finch's regular coffee shop. He spots a nearby building. He thinks this is where Finch lives. A woman answers and he says he's a detective. Inside Reese spots a picture of the woman with Finch. She refers to the man as ""Harold, my fiancé."" She says she ""lost him two years ago"" because of an accident.

Reese walks outside and sees Finch sitting on a nearby bench. Finch tells Reese that her life was in danger because of being with him. He says he was lucky, since ""I had four years of happiness. Some people only get 4 days"" (refering to John and Jessicia's 4 days in Mexico that ended with the 9/11 attack).

We see that while Finch was advising Peck and telling him that he built the machine, Alicia was listening at a nearby table."

Finch calls Carter to say Reese needs her help immediately. She's grabbed on the way out the door by FBI Special Agent Donnelly (Brennan Brown), who shows her current surveillance footage of Reese with a woman in tow.

MAY 15

Finch gives Reese the next name, a psychologist named Caroline (Amy Acker) who works with high-end clients.

Fusco calls Reese with word he's about to meet with some high-end people in HR. Reese sends him a picture of Caroline, who is meeting with a male patient. The patient says that if word of him seeing her gets out it will a problem for both of them.

Fusco and Simmons (Robert John Burke) meet with the HR counsel, who seem very pleased with his work. They want him to help take care of a rich client's problem by running interference for Homicide. Fusco sees a picture of the victim, and it's Caroline.

Meanwhile Caroline tries to tell her patient she can't do any more for him. He isn't pleased. Fusco calls with word about Caroline being HR's target.

Reese is going to stick as close to Caroline as possible by pretending to be a new patient. She promises discretion.

Carter looks into the finances of a Councilman (and HR higher-up) named Larsson for Finch. He's just had $500,000 deposit made in his account. Finch tells her about HR's new murder-for-hire business.

Caroline guesses that Reese is former military. She asks some thoughtful questions, but Finch reminds him through the earpiece that they can't be discovered.

Finch is being watched closely by Alicia (Elizabeth Marvel).

The balance of the account used to pay for Caroline's murder is $5 million, though Finch is thus far unable to track the source. Zoe (Paige Turco) is brought on to help with the case. Zoe has narrowed the possible suspect to three people: the lawyer who threatened her earlier (""Hans""), a banker named Terrance, and a city official named Sarkesian.

HR plans Caroline's murder and has found a dark location during her walk home. Reese shows up just before she's going to get jumped and cryptically tells her she should catch a cab. She tells him ""I'm safe"" and leaves. Reese continues to follow her, shooting two of her would-be attackers in their legs. Reese takes Caroline from the scene, telling her some of what just happened.

Simmons tells one of his henchmen that if they don't kill her, they'll be killed.

Reese takes Caroline to a nearby hotel to lay low, and we're back to our opening scene with Finch asking Carter for help and Donnelly pulling her away.

Reese tells Caroline they need to find out who might have hired the assassins.

Donnelly and his team thinks Reese is within a six-block area. It has become a manhunt.

HR arrives at the hotel lobby. Finch finds online that a previous tenant of the hotel should still have a helicopter on the roof.

Donnelly finds Reese and Caroline on film and orders in an FBI team.

The FBI sends in a copter of its own, meaning Reese can't go to the roof. He and Caroline have to head back down.

Donnelly has access to the hotel's surveillance cameras.

Finch directs him to a service elevator which leads to a tunnel. He leaves to meet Reese and is followed by Alicia.

Carter gets a text saying ""They're on 45 and they need your help."" Carter, watching the hotel's security cameras' feeds, sends Reese a text telling him to turn around, then another text letting him know when the coast is clear.

Simmons' plan is to blow the entire floor, taking out both Reese and Caroline. The plan is for ""somebody on the inside"" to feed them info.

Zoe has eliminated the real Hans, who actually was out of town. The guy who threatened Caroline was being blackmailed and forced to pretend he was ""Hans"" to threaten Caroline. He doesn't know who did it.

Alicia gets inside Finch's HQ and looks at the photos of past numbers.

Zoe tells Finch ""something seems off,"" and tells him to be careful.

Carter warns Reese that Simmons's team is waiting for him on floor 25, allowing him the opportunity to get off on 26. They hotwire the elevator so that it will skip the floor below. While Simmons team prepares the explosives on floor 25, the FBI begins staging on 27. Carter tells Reese what is happening. Just seconds before both Simmons crew and the feds move in, Finch manages to shut down all cell communication in the building other than his phone. This buys Caroline enough time to finish hotwiring the elevator.

Carter thinks Fusco is feeding HR info about Reese's movements. She corners him in the bathroom and demands answers at gunpoint. He tells her he's working for ""the guy in the suit."" He was just speaking with Finch on the phone. Finch calls Carter and tells her that Reese will need her help downtown. Fusco tells her knows exactly who the mole is and after this he's going to take them all down.

On their way out Reese breaks into HR's vehicle and helps himself to some of their ordnance supplies. Finch is waiting for Reese at the water treatment plant. Reese sends Caroline towards Finch, then begins to fight off HR in a gunfight in the parking lot.

Alicia jumps into Finch's car with a gun. She wants him to help her shut down the ""God"" he created.

Reese is in a huge gunfight. When it doesn't seem to be going well Fusco and Carter pull up and get him out of there.

Alicia tells Finch she thinks the power of the machine killed Nathan. She can ""feel"" the machine watching them and is ""tired of running."" He tells her that she's been running from people they trusted, not the machine. She says he's lucky she found him before they did.

While pursuing Simmons' men, Carter and Fusco aren't happy with Reese for not telling them they were both working with him. Reese hits a switch and blows up the HR car and the kill team. He smiles and walks away.

Zoe has broken into Caroline's offices, and is searching her computer.

Finch accuses Alicia of setting up Caroline to track him down. She says she's been tracking him for weeks, just as she's shot in the back of the head by Caroline. She gets into the car and says ""You can call me Root.""

At the same time Zoe sees that all of the information related to the account has been deleted. She calls Reese and tells him they've been set up. He realizes right away what happened. Root/Caroline put the hit out on herself to track down Finch.

Root tells Finch: ""Come on Harold, we've got so much to talk about.""

Reese finds Alicia's body.

Donnelly is sent an anonymous email (from Fusco) that tells him all about HR.

Reese finds Finch's office completely empty. On the street Reese stares at a camera and tell it ""He's in danger because he was working for you. Now you're gonna help me get him back."" A payphone (obviously one of the last remaining in NYC) on the street rings and Reese answers it."

He says that the Klingons have lost their way, and forgotten the Unforgettable, Kahless. He mentions the lighting of a beacon, and the need to reunite the Houses and save themselves from an impending threat: the Federation

Captain Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) and Commander Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) are on a desert planet attempting to locate a well that has run dry due to radiation from a meteor mining accident. Burnham predicts that an 89-year drought is imminent, and the non-humanoid species inhabiting the world - the Crepusculans - are facing extinction. Georgiou and Burnham's goal is to repair the well and have the USS Shenzhou pick them up undetected, thereby avoiding a violation of Starfleet General Order 1. After walking past a group of egg sacs and eventually locating their objective, Captain Georgiou discharges a type 3 Phaser into the well, allowing water to re-emerge from the well in a large geyser. The pair realize the gathering storm is preventing a transporter lock at their current location, so they begin to walk across the desert. Soon the Shenzhou is shown breaking through the storm clouds, and transports them up to the ship. A bird's-eye-view glimpse of the desert reveals that the captain used their footprints to create a Starfleet insignia visible from overhead, allowing them to be located. Georgiou says that Burnham had served under her for 7 years and wants her to have her own command.

The star-date is 1207.3, or May 11, 2256 in Earth terminology. The Shenzhou has responded to a signal from a damaged Starfleet relay and arrives in order to make repairs. The relay is located in a region of space in close proximity to a binary star system in a state of stellar collision, and the collision has created a large debris field. Science Officer Saru (Doug Jones) believes that the relay was intentionally damaged, since Starfleet always sends a ship to fix it. He picks up a signal from an anomaly in the debris field. First Officer Burnham convinces Captain Georgiou to allow her to approach the object with a Thruster pack, since the debris is too dense for a transporter lock or a shuttle-pod. She has 20 minutes before radiation exposure

Commander Burnham travels the two thousand kilometers to the anomaly without incident, but communication to the Shenzhou is disrupted. Burnham realizes it is not a normal part of the debris field, but an intricately designed, sculpture-like object. The object is centuries old and made of stone and metal alloys. She finds herself standing across from a Klingon. Burnham is attacked by the Klingon, and she manages to drive one side of the Bat'Leth through the Klingon's body, impaling the Klingon.

In the Klingons' chamber, the body of the warrior killed by Burnham, Rejac (Justin Howell), lies in a sarcophagus in the center. The anomaly investigated by Shenzhou is the ""sacred beacon"" placed by these Klingons. The sarcophagus closes, floats out of the chamber & comes to rest at a mausoleum-like area, which is open to space and already populated with many other sarcophagi.

Unconscious, Burnham recalls her childhood at the Vulcan Learning Center. There, a computer system quizzes her rapidly on various Klingon and Starfleet-related facts. She becomes overwhelmed by video of a particular Klingon attack and pauses the computer program. Her mentor, a Vulcan named Sarek (James Frain), lectures her on the importance of logic over emotion.

Commander Burnham wakes up in an anti-proton chamber, covered in wounds. Doctor Nambue (Maulik Pancholy) tells her three hours have elapsed since she was rescued from the object. Burnham recounts what happened earlier to Captain Georgiou, and Saru suggests that she is confused due to suffering a concussion. Georgiou believes her and locks on to what turns out to be a cloaked Klingon vessel. As soon as the weapons lock is initiated, the Klingon ship Decloaks.

The Shenzhou attempts to hail the Klingon vessel, but they ignore them. On the ship, the Klingons discuss a prophecy and reiterate the need to ""light the beacon,"" now referred to as the ""Light of Kahless."" Rejac's brother, Or'Eq, is called to take his place, but he questions whether the plan will work - whether the other houses will come. Just then, a light-skinned Klingon, Voq, joins the room and volunteers to light the beacon. He is rebuffed by the leader, since he doesn't belong to a Great House. Voq assures him of his faith, placing his hand over an open flame, causing severe burns. This act seems to change the demeanor of the leader, and, when a report comes in showing movement on long range sensors fulfilling the prophesy, he hands over his Bat'Leth to Voq and names him Torchbearer.

On the Shenzhou, Saru shows Burnham the ceremonial hull of the ship, covered in the sarcophagus-like coffins. While Georgiou informs Admiral Anderson (Terry Serpico) of their situation, Burnham recommends attacking to the admiral, but is rebuffed.

Captain Georgiou is concerned that Shenzhou is currently the only line of defense between the Klingons and an Andorian colony. Their discussion is interrupted by an ear-piercing electromagnetic signal, along with a blinding light permeating through the ship. Burnham recommends an attack and Saru recommends retreat.

Burnham goes to open a subspace channel to Sarek. She wants to understand more about how the Vulcans handled the Klingons since their first encounter. Sarek cautions her that their solution is unique to them and will probably not be theirs. Further, he cautions her from letting the fact that Klingons killed her parents affect her judgment. Through the discussion, Burnham is convinced that some new leader is causing change within the Klingon Empire and will use a war with the Federation to unite their warring Houses.

Burnham goes back to the bridge and recommends to the captain that the Shenzhou attack the Klingon ship immediately, pointing out that the Vulcans have used pre-emptive strikes in the past to meet threats from the Klingons (Vulcans always fired first when they encountered a Klingon ship). Violence brought respect; respect brought peace. She asks the captain the give the Klingons a Vulcan hello. The captain demands Burnham not contradict her in front of the crew, noting the obvious influence of her past with the Klingons in her behavior. Burnham then seems to accept it, but then quickly disables the captain with a Vulcan nerve pinch. She goes out and takes command of the ship and lies to the ship about Georgiou. She orders an attack on the Klingon vessel.

She's able to order the weapons fired but, just then, Georgiou re-enters the bridge and countermands the order, drawing her Phaser. The beacon from the Klingon vessel diminishes entirely. Then, sensors pick up a series of warp signatures on an intercept course. Georgiou inquires if it is Starfleet arriving, but Burnham quickly realizes it is the Klingons, greatly outnumbering them."

Outside, a flotilla of Klingon ships face-off against the Shenzhou. The Klingons have 24 ships and Burnham states that the Klingon High Council has 24 houses. Seems like someone is trying to unit the Empire against Starfleet.

Aboard his command vessel, T'Kuvma (Chris Obi) persuades the leaders of the various Houses of the Klingon Empire (appearing in holographic transmissions on his bridge) that he can lead them to victory over the Federation. The leaders are initially dismissive until they see the rest of the Federation fleet arrive.

With several Starfleet reinforcements having arrived, Georgiou tries to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict started by her now-former first officer, but the Klingons attack anyway. The Shenzhou is severely damaged, including the location of the brig, leaving Burnham trapped as half the deck is blown away and only a force field between her and open space.

Lieutenant Saru reviews the damage and both he and the captain realize the brig is exposed to space. They can't dwell too long as the ship comes under fire and takes evasive maneuvers. Burnham is still kept alive via the brig's force fields. She drops to the floor and, surprisingly, finds herself in a mind meld with Sarek, enabled by his Katra inside her. She apprises him of the situation and seeks his counsel. He ends up encouraging her that she is not doomed.

During the battle, the bridge is impacted with almost instant force fields turning on. Shields and impulse drive come off-line. Oddly, the pursuing warship moves off, but the ship is now under the influence of the stars' gravity. Just before hitting an asteroid, it is saved by the newly-arrived USS Europa via its tractor beam.

Admiral Brett Anderson's hologram appears on the bridge and Georgiou reports. He decides to try to broker peace with the Klingons. T'Kuvma introduce himself and agrees to a cease-fire, however, soon the Europa is rammed by a Klingon vessel under cloak. As life pods flee the ship, Saru aboard the Shenzhou reports that the Europa is deliberately breaching their antimatter containment field to destroy the attacker. Both ships blow apart.

T'Kuvma encourages the other leaders to go back to the Klingon home world Qo'NoS, united against the Federation. To Starfleet's surprise, all ships leave except for T'Kuvma's. He sends a message to the Federation that Klingon are superior and lets them live to relay that message to their people.

Meanwhile, Burnham uses ethical logic to persuade the computer controlling the brig security systems to allow her to escape across the vacuum between her and the nearest intact compartment by opening a hole in the force field and venting air from it to propel her across. Fortunately, it works.

On the bridge, Saru comes up with a plan to hit the ship with a transport carrying a photon torpedo which they can't fire. However, they can't set the transport on autopilot either. The captain says she will drive it herself.

As T'Kuvma orders the gathering of his ship's dead from the surrounding space, much of the Starfleet flotilla is destroyed or damaged. Georgiou is determined to kill T'Kuvma and avenge the deaths of her fellow officers. She plans to load the photon torpedoes into a shuttle and ram the shuttle into T'Kuvma's ship herself. Burnham then makes it back to the bridge and convinces her to capture rather than kill, which would make T'Kuvma a martyr. The captain briefly notes she is disappointed with Burnham, as she hoped Burnham would be more loyal. Burnham counters that she, in fact, valued the crew over Starfleet principles. Burnham offers to drive the warheads herself, but then they both see the dead Klingons being retrieved. The captain decides to act and calls Saru to get ready.

As T'Kuvma mourns the dead, the Starfleet crew devise a scheme to penetrate the enemy ship's shielding by sending one of the floating Klingon corpses armed with a photon torpedo warhead to penetrate the ship's hull. Saru beams them onto the Klingon dead as they are Tractored up. It works, and the Klingon ship suffers a huge explosion.

Burnham and Georgiou beam aboard T'Kuvma's ship to capture him, Phasers drawn. A struggle between Burnham and Voq ensues when they encounter him. Burnham struggles with Voq as Georgiou fends off T'Kuvma, however, Georgiou is eventually stabbed. Burnham fends off Voq, but not in time. She shoots T'Kuvma, killing him, and then tries to recover her captain's body, but Saru can't lock onto her, so only Burnham is beamed back to the Shenzhou.

Voq vows to his leader's corpse that his legacy will be carried forward. Aboard the Shenzhou, the order is given for all hands to abandon ship. Dozens of escape pods launch from the doomed vessel.

Back on Earth, days later, Burnham stands before a Starfleet board of court martial and pleads guilty to charges of mutiny, assaulting a fellow officer, and precipitating war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. Offering no defense of her actions and mourning the death of her lifelong dream to serve in Starfleet and command a star-ship, she is sentenced to be stripped of all rank and honors and imprisoned for life."

The fellow convicts of the shuttle and know that Burnham is responsible for the loss of 8186 lives in the first battle with the Klingons. An emergency forces (the organism GS-54 attacks the shuttle. The GS-54 feeds on electricity and drains the shuttle of all its power) her shuttle to be rescued by the USS Discovery (NCC 1031). The 3 other convicts rescued are Stone (Conrad Pla), Cold, and Psycho (Grace Lynn Kung). Discovery is a science vessel but has several black badge Starfleet security personnel aboard. Kelya (Emily Coutts) is the helmsman from Shenzhou and now serves on the Discovery, along with Saru. Everyone on the Discovery is cold to Burnham.

Spending several days on the ship, Burnham is ordered by its captain, the mysterious Gabriel Lorca (Jason Isaacs), to assist with a scientific assignment. Saru assigns Burnham to Engineering under supervision of Stamets. Burnham spends hours poring over complex computer code to find an error. Burnham shares a cabin with Sylvia Tilly (Mary Wiseman). Burnham is infamous as the first mutineer of Starfleet. Burnham witnesses effects of strange experiments performed on the ship, but Tilly wont tell her anything.

She overhears Lieutenant Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp), an Astro-Mycologist who is leading the assignment, discuss an upcoming experiment with a colleague serving on another star-ship; Burnham steals Tilly's DNA sample to gain access to restricted sections of the Discovery and finds a bio-environment growing a specific type of fungi.

Lorca is soon informed of an incident on the Discovery's sister ship, the USS Glenn, that killed its crew. Stamets speculates if it was ""bloom"" failure. On the way over to Glenn, Stamets still wont share any details with Burnham. Lorca forced Burnham to accompany Stamets with the mission to bring everything back related to the ""Project"". Burnham speculates that the project is trying to mix physics and biology. Stamets says that at a quantum level, physics and biology are the same. And spores are the building blocks of energy across the universe. Stamets is not happy with his research being commanded by Lorca, whom he considers a warmonger. He says, after the war started with Klingons, his research was co-opted by Starfleet.

Stamets leads a boarding party, including Burnham, to investigate and finds the dead crew hideously twisted and malformed, as well as a group of Klingons who were killed by an unknown creature. When it attacks the boarding party, they retreat into the Engineering section. Burnham devises a plan to outwit the creature, allowing the rest of the party to escape to the shuttle. Stamets is able to beam Burnham out before she is killed by the creature.

Lorca later asks Burnham to work for him, despite her sentence, explaining that he organized the circumstances that led her to him, as he needs strong-minded people such as her to help him win the war. Burnham challenges him by saying she will not help him develop a spore based biological weapon that goes against the Geneva Conventions of 1928 and 2155. Lorca says he admires her and wants her on his team because she knows how to think for herself: ""Universal law is for lackeys; context is for kings"".

He shows her that they are not working on a weapon but on a revolutionary propulsion method. The Glenn traveled 90 light years in 1.3 seconds based on the new propulsion system based on a Mycelial network of spores. A microscopic web that spans the entire cosmos. This technology can help ships to travel anywhere in the Universe and be gone in an instant. This can help defeat the Klingons. Lorca gives a demo of the technology to Burnham by putting her into a container filled with spores. As Lorca activates the Spore Drive, Burnham travels to 4 different systems in a matter of seconds and returns to Discovery. After their conversation, Lorca talks to his chief of security, Commander Ellen Landry (Rekha Sharma), to ensure his ""package"" is safely on board. Landry has secretly transported the creature aboard the Discovery."

Lorca assigns Burnham to study the creature from the Glenn, a giant Tardigrade which destroyed a dozen Klingons, and find a way to use its biology as a weapon. He says that Starfleet needs the best weapons in the Galaxy to defeat the Klingons and they have to learn from the creature. What material in its claw can shred the metal of a ship's hull. The hide that can withstand a Klingon blade.

Landry names the Tardigrade as Ripper. Burnham is not convinced that the Ripper is a hostile beast. She says that the creature acts in self-defense.

Starfleet Admiral Cornwall (Jayne Brook) orders Discovery to the Dilithium mining colony Corvan II, which is under Klingon attack. Corvan's workers extract 40% of the Federation's Dilithium, which is needed for traditional subspace jumps. Stamets is reluctant to make such a long jump using the spore drive. Every time the ship makes a long jump using the spore drive, it loses navigational stability. The Glenn also ran into an unexpected Hawking radiation firewall, while exiting the jump and all the biological on the ship spun out.

Lorca suggests that he proceed by trial and error. When the spore drive is activated, Discovery nearly collides with a star. Stamets says that they are missing a piece of super-computer equipment that has the computational power to help them maintain course. The Tardigrade reacts madly during the jump. Burnham finds that Ripper's brain showed heightened activity during the spore jump and that the 2 activities are connected. Lorca threatens Stamets and forces him to continue the journey to Corvan, playing the distress call from the colony over the ship's internal communication system for the entire crew to hear. Lorca sends Commander Landry to keep Burnham's research on track, and Landry attempts to sedate the Tardigrade (which she names Ripper) to cut off its claw; The creature kills Landry.

L'Rell says that Voq should build a bridge between the 2 worlds. Klingon leader Kol beams over to the Sarcophagus and says that Voq's ship has the cloaking technology to beat Starfleet. L'Rell & Voq beam over to the Shenzhou to get their Dilithium processor. L'Rell pledges loyalty to Voq and says that standing behind Voq he is free to be his enforcer, defender and campaigner. But they are shocked to find that the Klingon leader Kol (Kenneth Mitchell) bribes T'Kuvma's desperate followers with food to earn their loyalty. Kol wants to kill Voq, but L'Rell convinces him to abandon Voq on-board the Shenzhou.

With the help of the reactions of Saru's threat ganglia (as they did not react in the presence of the Ripper), Burnham becomes convinced that Ripper was acting in self-defense. After learning about the reaction of the Tardigrade to the jump and its symbiotic connection with the spores, Stamets and Burnham transport the creature to Engineering. Burnham says that the Ripper came on-board the Glenn using the same Mycelian network that they use on the Spore drive. The Ripper can communicate with the spores and can perhaps tell them where to go. The Glenn figured out how to use the Ripper's navigational abilities to guide their own jumps and make longer jumps with each experiment.

The Tardigrade connects to the spore drive and interfaces with the navigation system, acting as a supercomputer to calculate navigation coordinates. Discovery successfully makes the jump to the Corvan II colony and destroys the enemy ships, then disappears.

L'Rell (Mary Chieffo), a Klingon who is secretly loyal to Voq, promises a way for them to win the war for the house of T'Kuvma. She tells him that the matriarchs of the House of Mokai are ready to help Voq, but that he must sacrifice everything.

After the jump, Burnham visits the creature, which appears to be ill. Tilly persuades Burnham to open the package from Captain Georgiou. Burnham discovers that Philippa Georgiou bequeathed her a family heirloom - her telescope."

She consults ship medical officer Culber and says that Ripper has regenerative abilities, but has been very sluggish for the last 48 hours.

After a month of successful operations, Lorca is ordered to protect the spore drive until it can be replicated for other Starfleet ships. But the Starfleet needs more Tardigrades to make the spore drive operational on other ships. Lorca is told by Admiral Cornwell that until they find more, he should not be taxing the only Tardigrade they have in captivity. Cornwell says that Klingons may have gotten wind of his new propulsion system. Cornwell orders Lorca to stop using the spore drive unless authorized by Starfleet.

As he returns to the Discovery, Lorca is taken captive by a group of Klingons led by L'Rell. Saru is now acting captain of the Discovery. Saru starts to search for Lorca using the ship's resources. Saru wants to make multiple jumps using the spore drive, to locate Lorca within Klingon territory. Burnham updates Saru regarding her concerns about the Ripper's health. Saru dismisses her concerns as the priority is to find Lorca.

Burnham has grown concerned by the toll that the drive has taken on Ripper. Along with Stamets' partner, medical officer Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz), Burnham convinces Stamets to find an alternative to run the drive. Culber says that there is a chance that they lose the Ripper, and hence the spore drive.

Stamets explains how the root of the fungus makes the Mycelial network acts as a matrix that serves as an intergalactic freeway system. The Tardigrade's unique genetic makeup allows it to navigate the network because of its symbiotic relationship with the Mycelial spores. When Ripper borrows DNA from the Mycelium, it is granted an all-access travel pass around the galaxy. Tilly suggests building a virtual Ripper, thereby tricking the Mycelium into thinking it is communicating with the real thing. Stamets replies that he already tried that; it only allowed for small jumps. He knows why now - the spores and the drive were functioning at only a fraction of their capacity until they introduced a living co-pilot. Stamets announces that all they have to do to relieve Ripper is introduce the same sequence into a compatible host, one that understands its role in the process and does so willingly.

The team cannot find a organic host that is compatible with Tardigrade DNA. Saru wants to use the spore drive, but find it offline. Saru blames Burnham for endangering Lorca's life as she did for Georgiou. Burnham argues that human host is the most compatible with Tardigrade, but Saru forbids any human experiments. Saru orders Stamets to use the Tardigrade to jump into Klingon space to a battle cruiser where he believes Lorca has been imprisoned. After this jump, the Tardigrade goes into survival mode, sheds all of its body water, curls up into a ball and goes into hibernation. Saru asks Culber to comply the creature to cooperate, but Culber refuses.

Lorca is imprisoned with captured Starfleet officer Ash Tyler (Shazad Latif) and human criminal Harry Mudd (Rainn Wilson). Mudd escapes torture by Klingons by accepting their offer of getting his cellmates receive the torture instead of him (this is technique by the Klingons to keep the prisoners from bonding with each other). Ash says that he was captured at the battle of the binaries. Lorca cannot believe that Ash survived torture for 7 months, and Ash says that the Klingon captain L'Rell has taken a liking to him. Ash knows there are 30-40 Klingon on the ship. Lorca is tortured by L'Rell, who wants to learn the secret behind Discovery's new form of travel. Lorca finds that Mudd is a mole for the Klingons and has been feeding them intel on every prisoner in exchange for his survival. In discussions Lorca reveals that he killed his entire crew during an earlier battle to spare them from the Klingons' torture but escaped himself.

Lorca and Tyler escape before the Klingons can learn anything about it. Lorca leaves Mudd behind for selling them out. Lorca singes L'Rell's face before escaping in a Klingon shuttle. Lorca flies the stolen shuttle away from the battle cruiser, but is pursued by Klingon raiders. Saru observes the escape, and is able to recognize that the lead shuttle is being hunted. He initiates communication and finds Lorca. Saru beams Lorca and Tyler to the Discovery.

For the final jump needed to escape the Klingons, with Lorca and Tyler on-board, Stamets connects to the spore drive himself as the human host using Ripper's DNA. After the jump, Stamets goes into distress, but revives shortly thereafter. Burnham mends bridges with Saru and gives him Georgiou's telescope. Saru asks Burnham to release the Tardigrade. The Ripper revives in deep space and flies away. Later, Burnham frees Ripper while Stamets' reflection in a mirror does not walk away when he does."

Morning runs, the correct diet and so on.

On his way to broker a peace deal with renegade Klingon houses, Sarek is injured when a ""logic extremist"" attempts to assassinate him. The logic extremist hold that humans are an inferior race, and they are no longer to willing Sarek's patronage of them. Burnham senses this through her telepathic link with Sarek and Lorca agrees to rescue him. Burnham is a human, but raised as a Vulcan by Sarek and his human wife Amanda, when Burnham's parents were killed in a Klingon attack. The logic extremists did not want humans in Vulcan society and bombed the learning center where she was educated. Burnham was dead for 3 minutes and Sarek used his Katra to revive her. The Katra has healing powers. So, now Burnham is linked to Sarek via the Katra. He gets hurt and she feels the pain.

Admiral Terral (Conrad Coates) confirms that the renegade Klingon houses were ousted by Kol's new ruling council. Vulcans were invited to bring the warring parties together to forge an alliance for the peace effort with the Federation. Sarek's role was to bring the houses together on a consensus platform for peace. Now he is lost in a nebula near Yridia. Lorca decides to rescue Sarek.

Lorca considers making Ash his chief of security.

Lorca takes the Discovery into the nebula, but the gases from the nebula make any type of scanning impossible. Burnham offers to go into the nebula in a shuttle in an attempt to mind meld with Sarek and use that to find his location. Burnham searches for Sarek in a shuttle with Tyler and her roommate, Cadet Sylvia Tilly. Ash is their pilot.

Cornwell brings her ship into the nebula to confront Lorca. Admiral Katrina Cornwell questions this decision and others that Lorca has been making. He launches an unauthorized rescue mission, using a convicted mutineer and a prisoner of war.

Burnham attempts to connect with Sarek's mind, and finds him remembering the time that her application for the Vulcan Expeditionary Group was rejected. Sarek was brutal in telling Burnham that she is incapable of competing with the Vulcans and cannot thrive in the Vulcan service. He offers to get Burnham into Starfleet, where the requirements are less extreme.

Sarek keeps kicking Burnham out of his memories. Burnham confides in Tilly that her failure is Sarek's last thought. Sarek didn't believe in her and yet she is the one to save him. Ash argues that as one dies, they don't think about how other failed them, they think about what they wish they had done differently. The question is, what Sarek wishes that he had done different with respect to Burnham's VEG application.

Burnham again mind melds with Sarek and learns that the VEG would only admit one of Sarek's children, and he chose Spock, his half-human son. Spock was then a child, but the VEG wanted to tightly control the integration of outsiders in its ranks. Spock ultimately chose to join Starfleet, rendering Sarek's decision futile. Sarek wished that he had supported Burnham's application to VEG, instead of Spock's. That day was Sarek's failure and not Burnham's.

Burnham helps him regain consciousness and activates a locator beacon.

Lorca and Cornwell have sex, but she is concerned by his paranoid behavior, when he pulls a Phaser on her when she touches her in deep sleep. Cornwell realizes the depth of the issue and plans to remove him from command of Discovery.

With Sarek unable to meet with the Klingons, Cornwell takes his place on Lorca's suggestion. Before leaving, Cornwell tells Lorca that he will lose his command after she returns. She will reinstate him once he gets some help. The peace talks are actually a trap, and she is taken captive by Kol. Kol's holographic image appears and, in Klingon, says he is pleased they captured her instead of Sarek. He promises cloaking technology to Dennas for capturing her. In English, he tells Cornwell looks forward to meeting her.

Saru informs Lorca of Cornwell's abduction. Lorca, uncharacteristically, orders him to get direction from Starfleet Command instead of going after her himself. He takes a look at the stars, with a Phaser now tucked behind in his pants."

Burnham is attracted to Tyler.

While attending a crew party, Burnham and Tyler are called to the bridge to deal with an endangered space creature, a Gormagander, that the Discovery has come across. The Gorgamander feeds on alpha particles from solar winds. It is so consumed by this task, that it ignores procreation, which has led to its state of near extinction. Protocol requires Starfleet to transfer it to a Xenologic facility, so Lorca beams it into the shuttle bay.

When the creature is brought on-board, it is revealed to be carrying a person: Harry Mudd. Harry Mudd attacks the personnel in shuttle bay and even kills a few. He plans to kill Lorca and sell the ship to the Klingons and kill any chance that the Federation has of winning the war. Mudd says that when Lorca left him inside the Klingon prison, he stole any chance of Mudd getting back with his beloved Stella, the only woman he ever loved. Mudd is caught by the officers he decides to blow up the ship instead. The explosion rips the ship apart and cannot be contained. Soon, it reaches the bridge and Lorca is consumed by the fire.

Time line returns to the party earlier, with Burnham and Tyler called to the bridge again. They are intercepted by Stamets, who is aware that they are in a time loop due to his interactions with Ripper's DNA. Stamets is the only one who retains his memory from one iteration to the next.

Over numerous time loops, Stamets works with Burnham and Tyler to find a solution to the problem while Mudd gets further in his plan each time. Each time Mudd plans a different approach to get inside the Discovery ship. The 2nd time he transports into the Engineering section and activates the spore drive and overloads it. Stamets explains to Burnham and Tyler that they have lived through each variation multiple times and there is no scenario which ends well for the Discovery ship. Stamets tells Burnham that Mudd is running the same 30 minutes over and over and his objective seems to be to learn how to run the spore drive system and hand over the ship to the Klingons. Stamets says that Tardigrades can exist in multiple dimensions, and hence he is able to remember the loops due to a side effect of the Tardigrade's DNA

Stamets is worried that eventually Mudd will figure out the piece of equipment he is missing to run the Spore Drive. Stamets is able to convince Burnham and they develop a secret code that Stamets uses to quickly convince Burnham at each iteration. But they need Tyler and Burnham keeps blowing it with him when she tries to get his help at the party. Stamets teaches Burnham how to dance. The next iteration, Burnham asks Tyler to dance with her, and then asks for his cooperation, after winning his trust.

Tyler reveals that Mudd has a time crystal and he once used that to rob a Betazoid bank. He had an infinite number of tries to memorize the security patterns. They eventually convince Mudd that he has won. Mudd kills Tyler and Lorca, and Stamets reveals that he is the missing piece required to run the Spore Drive. Meanwhile Burnham works with Tilly to find that Mudd has hidden his entire ship within the Gormagander, and that has the time crystal and the source of its power. To distract Mudd, Burnham tells him that she killed the Klingon messiah T'Kuvma, and the Klingons will pay a lot more money for her, than for Discovery. Mudd agrees, and then Burnham kills himself to force Mudd to reset the time loop.

In the last iteration, the Discovery team is ready before Mudd boards the vessel. Stamets says that the crew is willing to surrender the ship if Mudd doesn't kill anybody. Mudd agrees and the time loop expires.

Preparing to receive a boarding party of Klingons, Mudd is instead confronted by his ""beloved"" Stella (Katherine Barrell) and her father, from whom he had stolen her dowry. Turns out Stella wasn't taken from her, Mudd was running away from her. Her father was an arms dealer and had even put out a bounty on Mudd. When Mudd thought he was sending the coordinates to the Klingons, the computer actually sent them to Stella and her father. They take Mudd away.

Stamets reveals to Burnham and Tyler that in one of the time loops they had danced together and kissed."

The Klingon ships cannot fire on enemy vessels when they are cloaked. As soon as the Federation ship is destroyed Lorca orders his ship to be taken out of the combat zone by engaging the spore drive. Stamets now has permanent implants in his body to help him engage the spore drive more painlessly.

Starfleet's Admiral Terral (Conrad Coates) confirms to Lorca that Kol from the house of Kor, has revived the Klingon Ship of the Dead. He is now offering the stealth technology to any house that promises him loyalty. Eventually, all Klingon ships will be equipped with this technology and will be able to attack Federation ships at will. Lorca is sent to a mission to the planet Pahvo.

Desperate for a way to detect these ships even when they are cloaked, Burnham, Ash Tyler, and Saru are sent to Pahvo, a seemingly uninhabited planet with a naturally occurring crystalline transmitter that broadcasts the planet's vibration frequency into space. They hope to use the transmitter to create a sonar for the hidden Klingon ships.

Meanwhile, L'Rell tries to help Cornwell escape in exchange for protection from Kol, but they are caught and L'Rell apparently kills Cornwell to try to save face with Kol. L'Rell drags Cornwell to the sarcophagus room. She pauses when she sees that a number of people she knows are now dead. She promises revenge against Kol. L'Rell informs Kol that Cornwell told her about the power of Discovery, but Kol notes she let the prisoner get away from the room. Kol has L'Rell taken away.

The Discovery officers learn that Pahvo is inhabited with indigenous life that introduce Saru to their higher understanding of peace. The life form is made up of pure energy signatures and is indistinguishable from the energy signatures from the rest of the planet. Saru is a first contact specialist and tries to establish communication with the sentient beings. He puts his arm inside the energy signature and feels their intentions. While Saru is busy with establishing contact, Ash and Burnham connect and Ash kisses Burnham.

Eventually, the planet's life force enters Saru's body to communicate with it. Saru communicates its mission to the entity. To end the war with the Klingons. Saru attempts to force Burnham and Tyler to remain with him on the planet forever. Saru says that the Pahvans have already achieved peace and are in perfect balance and harmony with their natural world. Burham and Ash realize that Saru has been compromised by the Pahvans. Ash distracts Saru as Burnham makes her way to the crystal transmitter to complete her mission. Saru eventually figures out that Ash has been misleading him

Burnham is able to fight off Saru and broadcast the new signal. Ash, Burnham and Saru and transported off to Discovery. But back on the ship, Lorca cannot witness any modifications to the Pahvan signal, that will allow them to discover any Klingon ships in the range of the signal.

The Pahvo lifeforms adjust the signal to contact the Klingons as well, hoping to end the war, and Kol receives the signal. He takes the Ship of the Dead to the planet Pahvo. The Discovery is the only ship that can protect the Pahvo.

In a side discussion, Stamets admits to Tilly that he now experiences frequent bouts of disorientation after engaging the spore drive. It could be the effects of genetic modification due to the new Tardigrade DNA in his body. Stamets doesn't tell Culber as Culber would be forced to send Stamets to a Federation lab to be thoroughly investigated."

Admiral Terral says that it is not worth to lose the Discovery over the Phavan transmitter and that Federation scientists can figure out a way to break through the Klingon cloaks, using different methods. Lorca argues that by sending the signal, the Pahvans have declared themselves to be the enemy of the Federation and hence will be annihilated by the Klingons. Lorca refuses to run away from this fight.

Burnham and Saru speculate that the Klingon cloaking device bends all EM radiation, making the ship itself undetectable to Federation sensors. But the background EM radiation contains tiny phase shifts, that are symptomatic to the presence of a cloaking device and its gravitational field. Saru says that if they can determine the exact relationship between the shift and the gravitational field, an algorithm could be developed to expose any Klingon ship hidden by the cloaking device.

The Klingons cannot fire weapons without Decloaking. So, the plan is to beam the boarding party over after the Klingon ship Decloaks and before its shields go up. Meanwhile Lorca had sent Stamets to Culber for a full check-up. Culber finds evidence of modifications to Stamets brain and wants a thorough investigation. But Lorca orders Culber to only send his report to Lorca. Lorca informs Stamets about his plan to make 133 micro jumps using the spore drive to create a 3D map of the Klingon ship's readings when it is cloaked. Lorca knows that he is asking Stamets to make a sacrifice.

Lorca reveals to Stamets that he has been collecting all the data from the Spore drive jumps. They reveal pockets of negative mass that could be connections to possible alternate Universes, and even coordinates to how to reach them. Stamets agrees to the sacrifice as the exploration of the Universe would continue once the Kingons are defeated.

When the Klingons arrive, Tyler and Burnham transport to the Klingon ship and plant sensors that will help create an algorithm for detecting cloaked ships. Burnham detects a human life form on the Klingon ship and goes for a rescue. They find an alive Cornwell hidden with L'Rell, but encountering the latter sends Tyler into shock due to memories he has of her torturing and forcing herself upon him. Tyler goes into PTSD shock, which Burnham is able to revive Cornwell.

Lorca has Stamets make 133 micro-jumps with the spore drive in order to provide a three-dimensional reading of the sensors, while Burnham distracts Kol by challenging him to a fight. Kol wanted to retreat when he detected a possible sabotage of the ship, but Burnham distracts him long enough for Discovery to collect the data needed. Burnham reveals to Kol that she killed T'Kuvma.

The jumps are completed, though not without trauma to Stamets. When the algorithm is calculated, Burnham, Tyler, Cornwell, and L'Rell-who wishes to defect-are transported back to the Discovery and the Klingon ship is destroyed, even though it is cloaked. The algorithm has worked and now Lorca is preparing to transmit the algorithm to Starfleet, so all federation ships can be equipped with it. Lorca is ordered to return to Star base 46 since several Klingon ships are in pursuit to seek revenge. Burnham realizes that Ash Tyler was L'Rell's prisoner. Tyler says that L'Rell tortured him for 227 days, and even sexually abused him. Tyler confronts L'Rell and wants to know why she sexually abused him and she promises to reveal soon.

Stamets volunteers to make one more jump to safety but tells Lorca it will be his last. However, Lorca secretly changes the coordinates, and they jump to an unknown destination surrounded by star ship debris."

The Klingon wreckage is registered hull density outside of the normal parameters. The discovery is attacked by a Vulcan ship but rescued by ISS Cooper. Lorca finds it odd, since the USS Cooper was undergoing a refit. Cooper identifies the Vulcans as rebels and proceeds to destroy them. Saru says that Quantum signature of the Vulcan ship and the Cooper is different to the Discovery, which is impossible since all known matter in the Universe has the same Quantum signature.

Discovery's crew determines that they have arrived in a parallel Mirror Universe, with Stamets now unconscious and unable to power the spore drive. Stamets's eyes have gone white and he talks about infinite possibilities, and about a palace. Meanwhile the Discovery cannot transmit the algorithm to Starfleet in their own Universe, and without it, the war is lost. Tyler confronts L'Rell, and she attempts to use a verbal cue to trigger something within him, though he fights this off.

They find a data core in the wreckage of a Klingon ship. Tyler is sent to retrieve the data core and Lorca can see that Burnham has feelings for Tyler. They learn that this universe is ruled by the human Terran Empire, who are fighting a resistance that includes species such as Klingons and Vulcans. Terrans are an oppressive, racist and xenophobic culture. They are led by a faceless emperor. The rebels are made of all non-human species fighting for freedom. Saru determines that ISS Discovery was at the same location where USS Discovery appeared in the parallel Universe. So, he theorizes that the 2 ships switched places in their respective Universes.

The ISS Discovery is captained by Sylvia Tilly's counterpart, so Tilly and the crew pretend to be their Mirror selves. Burnham makes the entire crew to change into new uniforms and assume their new personas, consistent with their mirrors in the parallel Universe. Here, Burnham is the former captain of the ISS Shenzhou, presumed dead after an attack by the fugitive Lorca. Lorca attempted a coup against the Emperor, and Burnham was sent to stop Lorca. Burnham was killed while piloting a shuttle and the Emperor laid waste to Lorca's ship, who presumably escaped.

The data core also indicates that the USS Defiant also crossed over into the parallel Universe from the future time period of the Original Universe. Lorca and Burnham know that the Defiant didn't use the Spore drive, and thus understanding how the Defiant crossed the boundary could be a key to them getting back to their own Universe.

They deliver Burnham and Lorca to the Shenzhou (which is captained by Connor in the parallel Universe), under the ruse that Burnham had been hunting Lorca since her presumed death and has now captured him. The plan is to get the data on the Defiant from the Shenzhou and return back to the USS Discovery.

Tyler comes to Culber for a complete physical. Stamets comes back from his coma to tell Culber that the ""enemy is near"" and that he should be careful, before going into coma again. Culber informs Tyler that he appears to have undergone major surgical modifications, which triggers something in Tyler and he kills Culber.

Tyler joins the others on the Shenzhou, where Lorca is tortured while Burnham assumes command. Burnham is escorted by Connor to her ready room. But Connor attacks Burnham in the lift, and Burnham defeats him. Connor's dead body falls to the floor and the lift reaches the bridge. The crew claps for Burnham. Tyler meets Burnham who says that she didn't find the files on the Defiant. Burnham and Tyler have sex."

She compares the brain pattern of the Tardigrades and Stamets and speculates that Stamets's neurological activity is part of the Mycelial network that keeps the portals open. So, to understand the activity further, she plugs Stamets back into the spore's network.

Mirror Saru is Burnham's personal slave on the ISS Shenzhou. In this Universe, prisoners are executed by beaming them into the vacuum of space. Its been 2 days and yet Burnham has no new information on how the USS Defiant crossed in and out of the parallel Universe without the spore drive. She has found the data she needs, but she has no way of transmitting the data to the USS Discovery without being discovered.

The ISS Shenzhou is given the coordinates of the resistance leadership and ordered to kill them all. Burnham convinces her crew that instead of destroying the base from orbit, she can infiltrate the base herself and put an end to the resistance forever. Burnham tells Lorca that the rebel alliance is a Mirror of the Federation led by a Klingon. If they can learn how, that is their path to peace back home. Burnham and Tyler travel as a landing party themselves and instead surrender to the resistance in hopes of learning how the Klingons of this universe have learned to work with other species;

They find that the Mirror version of Voq is the resistance leader and is called the Fire Wolf. Burnham tells Mirror Voq that she seeks peace, against the orders of her Emperor. Burnham offers to give the group time to escape before their base is destroyed, and Mirror Sarek (James Frain) confirms that she can be trusted after connecting to her mind. Sarek has seen Burnham's entire history through the mind meld and is perplexed at a world full of possibilities.

Listening to Voq triggers Tyler's programming, and he has to be restrained. Voq obviously sees this attack as a betrayal and wants to kill both Tyler and Burnham. But Sarek stands by his assessment and says that Burnham can be trusted. Sarek demands that Burnham and Tyler be spared, so that the resistance can continue.

Back on the ship ISS Shenzou, Burnham is livid with Tyler for jeopardizing the mission. Tyler reveals to Burnham that he now knows he was once Voq, and that he underwent surgery to appear human and infiltrate Starfleet. Voq's mission was to infiltrate the Discovery and steal the spore drive. He admits to killing Culber, who had found his secret. Voq attacks Burnham to avenge T'Kuvma's death but is saved by mirror Saru.

Burnham has him beamed into space, where he is picked up by the USS Discovery. Burnham had cleverly concealed the Shenzhou's data on a drive and put that on Tyler's body. That drive is recovered by Saru, when he beams Tyler/Voq aboard the USS Discovery. Saru and Tilly imprison him, having earlier found the body of Culber.

Saru and Tilly also unsuccessfully attempted to heal Stamets, who has not been the same since his last spore jump and Culber's death. Tilly's attempt to restore Stamets's cognitive function fail as his heart rate accelerates to a near unsustainable level and then fails. But in the Mycelial network, it is revealed that Stamets comes face to face with the mirror Stamets.

Suddenly another ship enter orbit around the rebel base planet and fires on it, before the rebels have completed their evacuation. Burnham is reprimanded for not killing the resistance leaders by the Emperor-the Mirror version of Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh)."

Burnham tells Lorca that according to Saru, the Shenzhou data revealed that the Defiant used Interphasic space to cross between Universes, but the exact coordinates of the Interphasic space was struck from the record. Before landing, Burnham administers a pain suppressor to Lorca, so he can withstand the torture booths. Georgiou sends Lorca to a torturous agony booth and has dinner with Burnham. The ISS Charon is a palace.

Stamets finds himself within the Mycelial network with the consciousness of his Mirror counterpart, learning that the network has been corrupted by the Mirror Stamets' experiments. Mirror Stamets also ended up in the Mycelial network when an experiment went wrong aboard the ISS Charon. Mirror Stamets was stuck in the network and then saw Stamets enter the network for the first time and had since then been reaching out to him. The corruption of the Mycelial network is the ""enemy"" that Stamets referred to in the physical world. The corruption is spreading inside the network and eating up parts of it. Stamets cannot find the coordinates of his last jump, which brought the ship to the parallel Universe.

Stamets encounters a representation of Culber and accepts his loss, before waking up from his trance. Culber told him that the mirror Stamets corrupted the network and unless Stamets fixes it, everything, everywhere will be exterminated. Mirror Stamets also wakes up on the ISS Charon. He discovers that his spore collection has been infected.

Georgiou invites Burnham for a private dinner. Georgiou serves Burnham a cooked mirror Saru as a treat. Burnham almost gags but manages to suppress her vomit. Georgiou laments allowing Lorca to become a father figure to Burnham, only for the pair to fall in love and plot to overthrow her. She plans to execute Burnham, who reveals the truth about being from another universe.

Explaining how they had crossed over, Georgiou trades the spore drive's schematics for information on alternative ways to cross between universes. But Georgiou warns that when the Defiant crossed over through Interphasic space, it had severe cognitive effects on every member of its crew and they all went insane.

Burnham calls Saru and has them come to the Charon. Georgiou then says she is reluctant to let Lorca go. Shockingly, she starts to argue that Lorca is actually the mirror-universe Lorca, noting his sensitivity to light (the entire human race from the parallel Universe is sensitive to light). Recalling all of Lorca's behaviors that match Georgiou's descriptions, Burnham realizes that she is right and that the mirror Lorca has been impersonating his prime universe counterpart all along, needing Burnham to get to Georgiou. Burnham tells Georgiou Lorca is in-fact the mirror Lorca from Georgiou's Universe.

Meanwhile, Maddox (Dwain Murphy) enters the torture chamber and wants to punish Lorca for killing his sister. Lorca fakes death and Maddox rushes to get him out of the agony booth, in fear that the Emperor will punish him for killing her prisoner. Lorca attacks and ultimately kills Maddox. Lorca reveals he is in fact the Mirror Universe version of Lorca, as he knew Maddox's sister's name and what he did to her.

Meanwhile Tyler is in agony aboard the USS Discovery. Saru can see that Tyler believes he is a Klingon called Voq. Saru reaches out to L'Rell for help. L'Rell says that Voq volunteered for the mission for the glory of the Klingon empire and accepted his human shell. Saru informs her that the Discovery is now in a parallel Universe, where the Klingons have lost the war. Saru refuses to believe it. Saru then beams Tyler/Voq into L'Rell's cell to see for herself, the agony that Voq is undergoing. L'Rell says that she can reverse the surgery. L'Rell holds a device on Tyler's head, which eventually makes him calm down. He starts to describe his past in English, which makes her cry out as if he had died."

Mirror Lorca reveals that it was Mirror Stamets who betrayed his ship, the Buran, to the emperor. When the Charon arrived, Mirror Lorca tried to escape into an ionic storm and ended up into the Original Universe due to a transporter malfunction. Mirror Stamets was developing a bio-weapon for the emperor. With the help of Mirror Stamets, who releases the bio-weapon into the Charon, they are able to kill those loyal to Georgiou and usurp her throne.

Georgiou goes into hiding, while Burnham also evades capture and contacts the Discovery. She warns the Discovery that they are now flying into a conflict. Meanwhile on-board the Discovery, Stamets is unable to revive his spores. Although, Stamets discovers that the massive power source underneath the Charon is powered by the Mycelium. The Discovery travels along the network with the spores, but the power source sucks the energy out of the network. This is what the mirror Stamets was working on. This process is poisoning the network and the infection is spreading rapidly. This power runs the entire city sized ship, and powers weapons that can destroy entire planets. If not stopped, the Mycelial network will collapse in the entire multiverse and life will cease to exist.

Burham informs Saru that Lorca they know is a Terran and from the parallel Universe. Stamets says that it was mirror Lorca who changed the coordinates of their last jump. He got all the data he needed from the 133 jumps around the Klingon ship to fill in the gaps for the access points to parallel Universes. Stamets informs Burham how mirror Lorca and mirror Stamets are destroying the Mycelial network. Burnham and Saru agree to a plan in which Burnham lowers the containment field around a large energy source in the ISS Charon that originated from the Mycelial network. The Discovery will then arrive to destroy the energy source, causing an explosion.

On discovery, Stamets says that their torpedoes are not powerful enough to break the energy orb and suggests loading all of their Mycelial spores into the torpedoes to provide enough potential energy to blow the orb apart. But this will use their entire supply of spores and they won't be able to go back to their own Universe. Plus, the blast will release an amount of energy that the Discover's shields will not be able to withstand. They will be incinerated. At this point Saru takes command of his crew and states that his species can sense danger and death, and he doesn't sense anything at this point. He is confident they will survive.

Tilly speculates that the ship can ride into the Mycelial network on back of the explosion and through which Stamets could navigate them back to their own universe. Stamets will integrate the Mycelial spore drive with the warp core to create another layer of bubble, that will protect the Discovery from the blast.

Mirrow Lorca kills mirror Stamets. Burham finds Georgiou and promises that she will never betray her again, in this Universe or any other. Georgiou agrees to help Burnham and they attack Lorca's group right in the throne room. That is the only room from where Burnham can disable the force field around the energy orb. Rejected and defeated by Burnham, mirror Lorca is then killed by Georgiou who offers to sacrifice herself to allow Burnham's escape.

The latter instead decides to take Georgiou with her as they are beamed to the Discovery and the Charon is destroyed. The plan works as speculated and the Discovery is able to ride the energy wave back. Stamets quickly loses track of the pathway to follow, but then finds a ""clearing in the forest"" based on his mumbling back when he was comatose. He follows the trail home.

Back in their original universe, the Discovery crew learn that they have arrived nine months after they left, and, in the meantime, the Klingons have nearly won the war."

The Federation is fighting 24 enemies. Cornwell is adamant that she saw the debris of the destroyed Discovery 9 months ago. Saru says that was the Terran ship Discovery from the parallel Universe. The 2 ships switched places when they jumped across the Universe. Cornwell surmises that the original Lorca is dead in the parallel Universe. She says that now with the Discovery's return, they have shared the cloak detecting technology with all front-line warships.

Meanwhile the Klingons have successfully used the cloaks to enter star bases and destroy 1/3rd of the Federation fleet. Klingons continue to attack Federation colonies and research outposts with impunity causing massive civilian casualties. 20% of former Federation space is already occupied. The knowledge of parallel Universes will be buried with the Discovery as this will create chaos in the Federation.

The only safe refuge for Starfleet beyond Earth is now Starbase 1, and they warp there with Cornwell assuming command.

After emergency surgery performed by L'Rell, Tyler now has his personality back, but can still access Voq's memories; Burnham is unable to forgive his actions as Voq and rejects him. Saru is not sure if Tyler is now a human or a Klingon or both. Tyler says that he and Voq were part of a new designed species reassignment protocol and Voq was the test case. Voq's skin was flayed, bones cracked, and fingers grated to fit him into a human shell (that came from Tyler). Voq and L'Rell loved each other, and they believed that bringing the Discovery back to Klingon would unite the warring houses under a single banner. Tyler promises to cooperate with Saru and the USS Discovery. Saru tells Tyler that Burnham has refused to meet him. Stamets is angry at Tyler for killing Culber.

Tilly tells Burnham that Tyler is a new person now. He is neither Tyler nor Voq. And the way he is treated now by his colleagues, will shape the person he ends up becoming. Tilly says that Tyler's Starfleet career is over, and that Burnham should say what she has to say. Even if it is goodbye.

The crew finds Starbase 1 conquered by a Klingon house, and the remainder of Starfleet's command withdraws to protect Earth. There were 80,000 souls on star base 1 which now shows life signs of only 274 Klingons. Cornwell speaks to L'Rell to understand how the war ends, as the Klingons are marching on Earth and are not making any demands. L'Rell says that the Klingons have now tasted blood. They will not retreat, and Starfleet has no option but to annihilate them.

Georgiou tells Burnham that she defeated the Klingons in the Mirror Universe with a surprise attack on their home world of Qo'NoS, and Cornwell agrees to replicate that now. Burnham says that Qo'Nos is a planet of subterranean caves. Caves are large enough to hold a star ship. So, instead of surveying Qo'Nos from orbit, they will map it from underneath the planet.

To jump into Klingon territory, Stamets Terraforms a desolate moon in the Veda system, to grow a new crop of spores so they can use the spore drive. Stamets uses his original spore sample to grow his new crop. The plan is successful and a new spores crop is ready within hours and is harvested

Georgiou tells Sarek and Cornwell of other essential information she has, and they have her pose as this universe's original Captain Georgiou to lead the mission. Cornwell tells the crew that Georgiou was imprisoned on board a Klingon ship and was decently rescued in a highly classified raid. Georgiou convinces Sarek that Klingon's will regroup after the attack on Qo'Nos and only she can bring them to their knees once and for all.

Burnham reaches out to Tyler, who tells her that Voq is gone. Burnham says that Tyler had his hands around her throat and no matter how hard she tries she sees Voq inside Tyler."

She won't consider the Klingons as equals and refers to them as animals. Burnham does not like the way Georgiou is leading the crew and confronts her. Burnham does not trust Georgiou and wants to know her real plan. Georgiou says that she has been asked by Starfleet to defeat the Klingons, who are advancing on Earth and only Georgiou can stop them.

Georgiou reveals herself to L'Rell, who is perplexed to see her alive. Georgiou beats L'Rell savagely when she refuses to cooperate which chimney (out of 7) should the Discovery crew use to enter the volcanic cave system on Qo'NoS. Georgiou doesn't believe Tyler can be useful to either the Klingon's or to the Federation, but Burnham argues that Tyler has access to Voq's memories.

Tyler suggests that a drone enter Qo'NoS's underground, dormant volcanic system to covertly search the planet for targets. The cave in which the Discovery will appear, is not connected to the rest of the Volcanic system, so the crew will have to use one of the 7 chimneys to enter it and map the military targets on the planet. Georgiou agrees to take Tyler with her. Tyler says that the most feasible entry point is a chimney that used to a temple to Molor, until Molow was defeated by Kahless. Then the Molor temple was built over and the land around it given to Orion traders.

Discovery jumps to a cave near the system's entrance, and a party of Georgiou, Burnham, Tilly, and Tyler pose as traders visiting an Orion outpost on the planet, in order to find the entry to the chimney and the volcanic cave system. Burnham and Tilly keep a close eye on Georgiou and want to know her actual plan.

Tilly discovers that the volcanic system they are targeting is active, and that the ""drone"" Georgiou has is a hydro-bomb. But before Tilly can communicate with Burnham, Georgiou finds the location of the Molor shrine from a couple of prostitutes and enters the cave system. A hydro bomb will release water overactive volcanic lava and will be turned into super-heated steam. This steam will build in pressure and cause a massive explosion while escaping to the landmass directly above. The land will be vaporized and the whole planet would be uninhabitable.

Burnham confronts Cornwell, who admits that detonating the bomb in the active volcano will annihilate all life on Qo'NoS and win the war for the Federation. Burnham insists that Starfleet not commit genocide and convinces Georgiou to give up the detonator in exchange for her freedom. Georgiou relents when she realizes that she is not prepared to kill Burnham, who she considers her daughter in the parallel Universe.

They give the detonator to L'Rell. L'Rell then addresses the Klingon Great Houses and tells them that she is the leader to fulfill T'Kuvma's call of unity for the Klingon Empire. The Klingons present scoff at her claim until she shows them the detonator. She then orders them to lay down their arms, and the Klingon fleet headed towards Earth veers off.

The Discovery crew are hailed as heroes, and Burnham is issued a full pardon and restored to the rank of commander. Tyler chooses to remain with L'Rell.

As Discovery warps to Vulcan to pick up its new captain, the crew receive a distress call from Captain Pike of the USS Enterprise."

Edwards'],"['', '', '']",[],['mission'],[],"The episode starts with President Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland) in bed, waking up at 4:45 to here his cell phone giving him an alert to go to command ops. After making his way down, he is informed of the fact that Majid Nassar is in a compound near a village and that America has the chance to launch an air strike. President Kirkman doesn't give the order at first, questioning if the blast will kill anyone from a nearby village. After being told that it would be good but he only has 10 minutes before their window will be closed, he gives the go-ahead to blow up the compound. Just before the Jets take off, Command Ops receives new intelligence, telling them that someone from the Algerian Government has tipped of Nassar, who has left.

Kimble confronts the President to deliver her fears on why Car Park H (2-star Generals and up only) was full at 5 AM and asks if they are going to war. She reminds him of his duty to tell Congress if he is going to take military action against anyone.

Military intelligence finds Nassar hiding in the basement of an Algerian hospital, which means that an airstrike is not an option as too many civilians would die. President Kirkman and his Commander of the Joint Chiefs meet in the Oval Office to talk about how to deal with Nassar, with the option of sending in a SEAL Team in the one that the CotJC think is the best. Kirkman demands to go talk to the leader of the team that would be going into Algeria and flies to Little Creek, Virginia.

Aaron briefs Seth on what to say in the press meeting at the White House that is about to start, informing him not to mention anything about an upcoming military strike. Despite the mission being Top Secret, all the press know and badger Seth with questions about what is to happen. Seth tries to redirect the conversation topic to something else to no avail, and so eventually ends the conference.

Max, the commander of the Seal Team, talks to POTUS (President of the United States) about the chances of succeeding in the mission. The commander says that it is a 50/50 chance, but he's confident that they'll get the job done. After reassuring Kirkman, POTUS green-lights the mission.

Kirkman heads to DC to meet with the Congress (a.k.a Kimble and Peter MacLeish) to brief them on the Algeria Mission. Peter gives his support, while Kimble warns him that she will turn her back on him should the mission fail. Aaron speaks to Kirkman after the meeting and recommends Peter for Speaker of the House (a position that Kimble is after) once Congress is actually full, with Tom telling Aaron to get to work on it.

Hannah Wells (Maggie Q) is following up on the tip from last episode (Room 105). After digging around and making a deal with Kimble (to keep her informed of her findings for the blueprints to the most recent renovation of the Capitol). She finds that room 105 was renovated by a contractor that hadn't been used before, that Kimble hasn't heard of and that has closed within two months of the renovation. She finds that Peter MacLeish was found in the rubble of Room 105.

Aaron and Emily (Italia Ricci) approach Peter for the role of Speaker of the House. However, Peter turns them down (saying ""Speaker of the House is pure politics... I'm not interested in power for power's sake""). He says that he is honored, but that being Speaker would prevent him from serving the American people.

With help from Kimble, Hannah finds out that the 8 men who worked room 105, only to discover that they have all died within the last two months since completing work on the room. Further probing leads to the discovery that they had built 105 as a bomb shelter, with Peter knowing about it and going to it before the bombing took place. Hannah takes this all to Jason (her boss at the FBI) who finally believes her but tells her not to tell anyone else (as they ""don't know who to trust"")

As Hannah gathers more evidence, Peter gains more access to POTUS, who invites Peter to the Situation Room to watch the mission via video feed. The SEAL team loses a chopper, with Denton becoming injured so that he can't go on with the mission. Max says that they have a suitable replacement for him though to carry on with the task at hand. The SEALs make their way through the hospital and make it to the basement, where they find Nassar and some of his men, who have taken several children hostage. During the fight (in which the Situation Room loss to the feed (much to POTUS's anger)) the SEALSs manage to apprehend Nassar alive, but Max dies while shielding two children from the gunfire.

POTUS talks to Denton at Max's coffin, who tells him that Max wasn't meant to go on the mission and was meant to stay at the Helicopter Landing Zone, but replaced himself [Denton] when he became injured in the emergency landing of the chopper. Tom starts to blame himself (using the fact that Max told him it was only a 50/50 chance and that he should have waited for better odds), although Denton

Later that night, Kirkman walks in on Emily, Aaron and Seth eating dinner and learns that Peter turned down Speak of the House because he didn't come to DC for power, something POTUS says he can relate to and respects Peter for. Because of this, Tom suggests that Peter may be better suited to take on the vice presidency, ending the episode."

Miller Tobin'],"['', '', '']",[],"['new york city', 'manhattan new york city', 'upper east side manhattan new york city']",[],"Previously on Gossip Girl -- Blair loves Nate, Jenny loves popularity, Lily loves Rufus but is loathe to admit it, Rufus *really* loves Lily, Serena loves Dan and hates Chuck, Lily loves being proposed to by Chuck's dad, Serena *really* loves to hate Chuck, Chuck taunts but secretly loves Blair, Jenny loves attention from Nate, Blair hates her life falling down around her as Jenny ascends to Queen Bee status, Blair and Serena love each other enough to be good friends after so much fighting.

There -- caught up now after three months? Whew! XOXO!

""Moon River"" plays, Blair is Holly Golightly looking for her orange cat (though did Audrey Hepburn ever say ""Ew!"" in the alleyway?), and Nate is doing total George Peppard action, down to the sixties hair. (Flashback for the uninitiated and/or lazy - Breakfast at Tiffanys is Blair's fave film.) Sadly, reality imposes upon Blair's dream and Gossip Girl informs us that spring break is over, over. Blair's BFF is Lady Godiva (as in chocolate), and must be dragged out of bed to school.

Serena and Chuck, apparently step-siblings, are doing a post-modern interpretation of the Brady Bunch kids-sharing-a-bathroom dance, however Chuck's guests are not Peter and Bobby, but his female guests from the previous evening. Turns out he's joking about the girls, but not about getting high. Serena is appropriately disgusted, and leaves without showering (something everyone notices through the day).

Meanwhile, on the way to school, Jenny is playing total Queen Bee with Blair's former clique -- it's just like ""The Golden Girls"" or ""Designing Women"" where everyone wears a different color to offset each other, down to the headbands. Jenny is playing it up that she has a fab couture outfit for her upcoming birthday dinner, but her insecurity belies her pretense at excellent financial and fashion status.

Meanwhile, Eric (still frosting his hair) is gawking in the stairway, hiding from his valet, who wanted to put his socks on for him -- apparently, the new domestic state of the combined Bass-Van der Woodsen families is wearing on the non-Bass kids. Ah -- everyone is cohabitating, but no marriage has happened, as Chuck's dad asks Chuck to be best man. Should be easy, since Chuck is kissing up to Lily big time and alienating his soon-to-be siblings.

Dan (in schoolboy uniform) is back from spring break, eating breakfast with Rufus, who informs him that Jenny is now hobnobbing on private planes and having a grand old time. Rufus (in worn out gray tshirt - still looking great) tells him he's late for school, and aspiring writer Dan makes a break for it.

Cut to B and S - S is rocking out some great leather, B looks like a matron coming back from the salon, white sunglasses and kerchif hiding her personality. S brings B up to speed on her pals, and gets B to remove the disguise. Uh oh, Blair must now face her schoolmates, who gawk and gape and get to see her coated with Yoplait (thanks, Jenny!).

Nate corners Jenny in the schoolyard, and warns her about her new supposed friends, who have turned on Blair and according to him would be more than happy to turn on Jenny. Romantic foreshadowing -- Nate tells Jenny she's not like the other girls! BTW, Nate's bangs have not been cut in three months.

Blair and Serena convene on the Metropolitan Museum of Art steps again, but it's just the two of them, being brave. Then, Chuck and Eric (!) appear, as male BFFs, which irritates Serena to no end. Blair is irritated watching Jenny hold court, and is further peeved that Jenny is getting taken to dinner by the clique girls. Serena basically tells her to be nice and everything will happens in its own time. Blair is.... less than comforted.

Jenny is troubled again having to pretend to be rich, and using her wiles, tries to get out of another expensive night she cannot afford.... by marching up to Blair! AND, she invites her to Butter! (If you don't know about Butter, please start reading New York magazine *right now*) Serena says yes for Blair.

OMG - Dan and Serena are making out at (her) home! Chuck interrupts that the wedding caterer is here with a tasting menu, and invites Dan to stay. Nice, or.... a motive involved? Serena gets a surprise package - it's porn and handcuffs! How thoughtful! She assumes it's from Chuck, he denies, Dan removes the offending material.

Spotted - Blair alone at Butter at a huge table. Turns out Jenny tricked her! The clique girls are at someone's upscale home. Jenny thrusts and parries at questions about what expensive clothes she'll wear to her party, saved by a phone call from her dad. Rufus wants to take her out to dinner, but plays along nicely when she says she wants to be with friends... but the sad music says she might want to be with dad instead of pretending to be fab tomorrow night.

Blair, alone at Butter, puts on the best face possible with the staff.... and then pulls out her phone. Is the bitch back?

Next day, Jenny's at a consignment store -- it's apparent she's been there more than once. She has clothes to sell... but are they hers, or one of her friend's? In exchange, she wants a her own hot outfit.

In the Bass limo, Eric is playing Mini-Me to Chuck's Dr. Evil. Chuck's dad is dubious about the situation, and after Eric leaves, Dad berates him for the porn-and-handcuffs stunt (which Chuck denies again) and then offers him $$$ to keep things copacetic for the wedding. A deal is made.

B and S are talking on the phone - B sez she's not coming in (something to help those less fortunate - ha!) but in reality she's at Rufus' gallery. Back at school, Serena is presented with three cases of champagne, delivered. She leaves it for the kids, and is obviously unnerved at the present. Chuck is intrigued!

OMG - someone stole a couture dress from one of Jenny's friend's moms! Could it be the same dress Jenny just sold at her fave consigment store? As the Magic 8-Ball would say, Signs point to yes! If the dress doesn't get returned, a poor maid could go to jail.

Blair is trying to make trouble with Rufus over Jenny -- B has her sweetest smile on, but manipulation is the name of the game. Rufus counterplays with suggestions of Jenny's servitude to Blair. Blair accepts the maneuver and implies poor Jenny needs help with her new pals. Check, but not checkmate.

Jenny tries to get the stolen/sold dress back so someone you've never seen on the show won't get into trouble. Failing to do so, she calls... Nate! Can she borrow $8000? Nate balks, she hangs up, he's intrigued....

Back at the Bass-Van der Woodsen residence, Lily asks Serena if she has reservations about the upcoming wedding, prompted by the mysterious delivery of champagne at school (thanks, schoolmistress, for blabbing!). Serena vehemently denies, and blames Chuck... just as Chuck's dad walks in assuming the worst.

OMG again - Jenny comes home to Brooklyn, and all her pals are at her loft with Rufus for a low-budget party.... not only is there a tacky cake waiting, but Blair appears to be the one to have arranged it all! Cut to B with a smug smile. Jenny puts on a brave face, but is horrified a la Molly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink that her friends have now seen where she lives.

Blair listens on as Jenny's ""friends"" induct this so-called party into the ""birthday hall of lame."" Blair now looks like she has devoured two canaries, with frosting.

Serena and Dan are sharing a thermos of coffee outside wearing trendy scarves. Nate (!) interrupts, asking to speak with..... Dan? Nate is all like concerned over Jenny and the big money request. Dan is good big brother and willing to investigate.

Cut to Jenny trying to get out of her stolen couture outfit as Rufus tries to help. The clique friends walk in... and see that Jenny is wearing the one-of-a-kind Valentino that magically disappeared from somebody's mom's closet. Blair swoops in, devours a third canary, and invites the brood to Butter. Jenny is left humiliated in her (wait for it) red dress! So Scarlett O'Hara, all the way up here in Brooklyn!

Rufus and Jenny are having dad-daughter time; Rufus reveals Blair's machinations, and then demands to know where the red dress came from. Jenny gives it back to him, telling him how difficult it is to be a brown-bagger in a rich world, and that it means she may have no friends. (Translation: It's harder out here for a Brooklyn girl than it is for a pimp!)

Nate bids Serena a chaste good night in front of her hotel, just as Eric walks up after a mysterious four-hour disappearance. The frosted locks are no cover for his excuses, and he gives Serena a line about how great Chuck is, how he doesn't treat him like damaged goods. Eric gives Serena a present supposedly from Chuck... it's cocaine! Eric is shocked... or is he?

Dan's back in Brooklyn, seeing the ruins of Jenny's birthday-from-hell. He plays good brother, but asks about the $8K. Jenny reveals the she-thought-she-could-fool-them-all plan. Dan offers ice cream. Didn't we just see cocaine about 30 seconds ago? Brooklyn is indeed a world apart.

Serena confronts Chuck, who is wearing a strange whale-knit cardigan that must be seen to be believed. She throws the coke at him, and he reveals he's been kicked out, for the good of their soon-to-become family. Both are slightly confused, like whales on a cardigan.

At Butter, Blair is unwilling to give up her table (again) when her clique pals show up to keep her company - B is now Queen Bee again!

Rufus and Dan argue about whether Jenny should be grounded - spring break is, like, officially over now! Dan goes to get Jenny for some cake, but the blonde minx has disappeared... to Nate's, no less. She asks for a favor -- not money, just not to be alone on her birthday. Sweet, yet a tiny bit creepy.

Back at the Bass-Van der Woodsen ranch, Serena tries to make amends with Eric, who rebuffs her. Just then, an urgent letter is hand-delivered to her... dramatic music rises.... ""Oh my god,"" says Serena, who leaves immediately.

Back at Butter, Jenny crashes Blair's table, with Nate in tow. Seeing Jenny's prize catch, the clique girls turn a blind eye to Jenny's Valentino dress theft, while Blair upchucks her previously eaten canaries.

At Chuck's suite, a knock on the door heralds Serena, who apologizes for accusing Chuck of the champagne-porn-cocaine deliveries. A handwritten note reveals it's all thanks to someone named ""G"" -- ""Hope you like your presents! Coming back to town."" Chuck somberly and sympathetically offers S a drink - we might all need one for the upcoming drama..."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1122271/?ref_=ttep_ep15,,"Serena's world is turned upside down when her former partner in crime, Georgina Sparks, returns to Manhattan to stir up trouble.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Michael Fields'],"['', '', '']",[],"['new york city', 'manhattan new york city', 'upper east side manhattan new york city']",[],"Previously on Gossip Girl: Serena gets a trio of unwanted gifts -- sorry, they're not from Chuck! Flashback: Blair and Nate are in love, then break up. Flash to now: Jenny threatens Blair's status as queen bee. And the mysterious ""G"" is behind Serena's recent receipt of champagne, cocaine, and porn with handcuffs.

Now - back to the present.

Everyone is seen angsting -- about the SATs? Did we drop into geek territory? Seriously, everyone is studying: Serena with coffee, Blair with her maid, the wannabes are enamored of their test pens, Chuck (wearing an orange overcoat stolen from Posh Spice's closet) enlists an African American cutie to take his place during testing. Of course, Dan is the only one actually really studying, pulling his hair oh-so-photogenically. Rufus pops in (having had a Brooklyn spa day, it appears) to remind his son that time's up on his faux SAT. Perfect-pores Rufus is also intent on escorting Jenny to school, since she's been up to slightly devious shenanigans. Jenny appreciates the parent-child bonding, but in keeping with channeling Molly Ringwald a la Pretty in Pink, doesn't want her friends to see her dad.

At school, Serena and Blair are comparing and constrasting their pals' college-bound credentials; Blair *must* take out Nellie Yuki, because she's the highest-scoring student but mostly because she likes saying ""Nellie Yuki."" Chuck appears again in Posh Spice's orange overcoat, Blair disappears, Chuck is surprisingly cordial to Serena. He informs her that Georgina (that would be ""G"") is nowhere near the fair isle of Manhattan, according to his sources. Serena is totally relieved, Chuck waxes nostalgic about how Georgina brought out the old sexy Serena, S politely rebuffs and reminds him about the impending SATs.

Jenny is getting an earful from her upperclasswomen about how she's lucky not to have to take the SATS; everyone is ridiculously accessorized to the max, like they fell onto the Bluefly.com accessory wall from Project Runway. Jenny offers to help, but Blair sweeps in offering a study night, which sounds more like a spa night with massages, pedicures, and round the clock facial treatments.

Serena and Dan meet up in the school yard, exchange smooches and promises to study together when -- OMG, is Sunnydale invading Manhattan?! Michelle Trachtenberg, in oversize sunglasses and Eurotrash style to max, sidles up behind S, insinuating dirty thoughts! She is like totally Georgina! Serena is agape.

Georgina inquires about the gifts, asks if S missed her, offers her a date for a cocktail to catch up. Georgina's vibe is slightly predatory, a tiny bit desperate, and totally hinting at girl-on-girl friendliness that comes with a price; it's as if we've dropped into a Jacqueline Susann novel all of a sudden! (If you are too young to know who that is, Wikipedia her right now and order your copy of Valley of the Dolls - so much fun!) Serena looks like she's seen a ""ghost of parties past"" as Dawn -- I mean, Georgina! -- trots off to cause trouble elsewhere.

Back to Jenny, who meets with a kindergartner who apparently goes to her school - a short cohort in a hot pink overcoat (Posh Spice's also?) who offers to help Jenny find the right boyfriend. Many suitors are rejected when a cutie dogwalker bumps into her; he looks even younger than Jenny if that is possible. He proffers a phone number (smooth operator for 14!) and is on his way. Jenny does so not want a dog walker - sorry!

Nate shows up at the cafe where Vanessa (remember her?) works, where Dan is SAT studying and Vanessa is tutoring him while working on her video project (remember that?); Nate, BTW, appears to be wearing a pajama top under his blazer. Nate is offering numerous SAT books, which Vanessa kindly rebuffs -- in reality, it's a mask for coy flirtation. Nate and his pajama top depart, Vanessa checks out some notes Nate left tucked in the pages, and is intrigued!

It's nighttime now, Serena and Georgina are chatting over cosmos; Serena tries to say she's so not into the past fun and games, Georgina promises fun and games like old times but without the nasty repercussions. Serena waffles, promises one drink - uh oh! Down the path S goes....

The wannabes show up at Blair's -- where's the SAT spa they were promised? Blair is a symphony of polka dots, and her mission is to get her pals to take down Nellie Yuki, find her weakness and exploit it. Once done, spa time is theirs.

S and G are remembering good old times -- S seems very drunk while G is in control. Two guys pop over (if you watch As the World Turns, one of them is Noah, of Luke and Noah, the hot-young-pioneering-gay-male-couple-of-daytime-drama), while S pretends to be Southern and G pretends to be Greek (nice nod to Blake Lively's Traveling Pants films!). A call comes in - it's Georgina's dealer! S is pissed, G is irked because S is pissed, S makes an emergency call to Chuck for a rescue. Chuck obliges after some verbal wordplay, while wearing a green-and-white-striped sweater, plaid shirt, AND pink tshirt!

Chuck calls.... Dan? While Chuck puts on a jerky act, he's really giving Serena a nice out from her study date with Brooklyn Dan, saying S is sick with food poisoning. Dan buys it.

Next morning at school, Chuck has traded his orange overcoat for a red-magenta one. Dan stalks up to him, asking why is Serena so weird -- must be Chuck, eh? S walks up -- uh oh, she pops a migraine story, not a food poisoning one. She covers nicely but not perfectly. Dan pushes it, but she's totally saved by the bell. Dan is angsty, S confides to Chuck that she's miserable, Chuck says, um, tell him about Georgina! Serena, not being wise with the insight, says no way.

Focus on Nellie Yuki, cornered by the wannabes. Blair is orchestrating a pressurization of the perfect student, but Nellie balks until... they find a weakness! (Blair is wearing perfect white gloves, argyle, plaid, a tie AND a striped hairband) Turns out Nellie's boyfriend broke up with her and she's still a mess over it. Blair downloads the product-placed song that reminds Nellie of her old BF - thanks, Verizon Wireless!

Jenny and her Mini-Me are still scheming to find her a boyfriend when they come across adorable Dog Walker Boy again. Uh oh, turns out he's not the walker -- he's the owner! Jenny is pleased, and makes her move.

Back to Blair -- she finds poor Nellie, plays the hurtful song that makes Nellie goes to pieces, and gets the uber-genius to open up to her. Blair is faux-sympathetic, gets the name of Nellie's ex, and invites poor Nellie over for catharsis at her penthouse. Hmmm... Nellie wants to be focused for the SATs, but Blair puts on the nicey-nice act to get her competition in a weakened state.

Vanessa is in Brooklyn in a trendy diner waiting for.... Nate? He's late, she's cute about it, and she's surprised he knows the place. Turns out Nate's dad is in rehab close by... bonding music swells as she looks at him in a different light. Nate says he and his eyebrows come to the cafe for decompression, Vanessa sympathizes... turns out she's read an essay of his he left in one of his SAT books, and is apologizing for treating him like a superficial rich kid. They smile.

G calls S -- G wants to make up, she sees S has changed, says she's an inspiration. We sense duplicity in the air, and the music accompanying the scene confirms our suspicions. Serena says she can't, can't, can't meet for dinner (SATs, you know), but Georgina promises only an hour. Serena waffles (again), says yes to the dinner invite, Gossip Girl tells us that (surprise!) it might be a big mistake.

Back in Brooklyn, Dan is cramming for the SATs and bugging Jenny. Rufus returns home, Jenny is super-perfect daughter with homework all done, dad rewards her with a sewing machine, which she sold to get fashion clothes for school. Sadly, she's still grounded, but wants to meet Dog Walker/Owner Boy. When Rufus says nyet, Jenny storms off.

At SAT Spa Central (aka Blair's pad), B leaves a message for S, who is a no show. Nellie Yuki is getting a massage when in walks.... Nellie's ex-boyfriend! The two awkwardly engage.... the boyfriend apologizes and wants to talk. Nellie is happy and thanks Blair, who, um, *might* have an ulterior motive! Oxygen facials, everyone!

OMG - Nate and Vanessa went out on a date! With live music! In Brooklyn! They start bonding, Vanessa tells him about her non-college dreams and her aspirations of being a filmmaker. They say goodnight....romantic music swells.... Nate and his cheekbones get closer to Vanessa.... she giggles... OMG redux, they totally kiss! Multiple times!

Back in Manhattan, S and G are dining out, with Diet Coke instead of cosmos. G grills Serena about Dan, Serena spills her heart and guts, sweetly, and Georgina seems actually affected. As Serena goes to call Dan, it's revealed - Georgina's putting on an act for certain. And then, she totally spikes Serena's Diet Coke! Drama is in the making! A toast is proposed to the ""new Serena"".... cut to commercial break!

It's got to be the morning after, when Serena wakes up....at Georgina's hotel room?! S is totally confused, and panicked that she's missing the SATs. G offers eggs for breakfast and reveals how S went from Diet Coke to Patron in a heartbeat; also she covered for her pal with Lily. G spins a tale of debauchery and men while playing the good helpful friend. Serena is like totally freaked... and calls Chuck!

In Brooklyn again, Vanessa runs into Nate, who offers to whisk her away somewhere on a one-time-only date. Vanessa is intrigued -- and actually says so! (We are validated!)

Jenny and Rufus are eating breakfast, tense-fully. They finally have it out - Jenny is angry that dad won't let her go see Asher (aka, Dog Walker/Owner Boy) and that she has totally learned her lesson, so let her see the cute boy, OK? Rufus says no way, while wearing a bad collar-less button-up shirt. Frowny faces all around.

Turns out Nate's secret date for Vanessa is.... the SATs! Since she's a genius at helping Dan, shouldn't she take the test herself to see if she does good and might want to go to college sometime? She screws her courage to her number-two pencil sticking place and charges in.

Oh no -- after a whole night of talking, Nellie Yuki confides to Blair that she and her old boyfriend might not get back together! Blair is like totally sad (ha!) and gloats as she hears Nellie got no sleep. As Nellie goes in to take the test, Blair reveals her secret weapon -- she's just stolen the batteries from Nellie's calculator!

At the SATs, Blair and Dan have a nice moment over trying to find Serena. As Blair leaves, Dan overhears a youngish redhead checking in as ""Serena van der Woodsen."" Uh-oh! We smell Chuck somewhere close by....

Flash forward to the end of the SATs -- Blair (who appears to have undergone a hairstyle change while taking her test) and Dan reconvene re Serena, and Dan, wearing his Rufus-style I-am-disappointed face, says he might know where to find her. Adding insult to injury for both Blair and Dan, the two spy Vanessa and Nate embracing! It's a total WTF moment for the two pals-of-Serena.

Dan finds Serena, but instead of getting hostile, he goes into sensitive guy mode and begs her to tell him what's going on. Chuck, a symphony of bad golf-outfit colors, pops in on the moment, as Serena pulls the food-poisoning act again. Dan counterplays with the I-saw-someone-checking-in-as-you-to-take-the-test factoid, Chuck says it was his idea, Dan is *so* sensitive that he says he's not mad and asks Serena to please, please, PLEASE tell him what's what. When she won't, he finally, sensitively, breaks.... now he is really disappointed! And leaves.

Chuck reads the situation and nicely (for him) asks Serena what Georgina has on her that she won't even tell Dan about it. Serena won't say.

At G's suite, S shows up, saying do not EVER contact her again! (Nice white scarf there, Serena!) S confronts her on the shenanigans, but owns her badness. G pushes her on how bad a girl S can be, while Serena's strong facade slowly cracks.... a threat by Serena is issued, ""If I go down, you go down with me."" The two bitchily agree to stay apart.... but Georgina's face says revenge is the order of the day.

In Brooklyn, Asher shows up at the Humphrey loft, bearing food as a gift. Jenny is touched, Rufus is confused, Asher totally plays the perfect prince and Rufus melts.

In Central Park, Dan is brooding when an adorable golden retriever runs up to him chasing a ball. Turns out the sweet doggie is owned by..... Georgina! G plays cute, Dan plays funny, sparks are ignited, and then G introduces herself.... as ""Sarah""!

Teased for next week -- Serena's secret is leaked, and the long-anticipated ""gay bomb"" drops!"

Serena's little brother Eric tried to kill himself, evil Georgina returns to haunt Serena, and Serena will NOT tell anyone what Georgina has on her. Meanwhile, Georgina introduces herself to Dan as ""Sarah.""

On the steps of the Met, Jenny and Blair stare daggers at each other while comparing and contrasting various internet/blog rumors that may or may not be true (Gossip Girl is irked that her sources may not be pure). Yes, everyone is color coordinated within an inch of their lives. Jenny's having a party at Asher's (my, she works fast!) that Blair is so not invited to. Blair tries to cut her down, but the party planner rings up Jenny. (OMG, Jenny is totally wearing fishnet stockings -- what would Rufus say?!) Ha! Turns out it's Rufus on the phone, Jenny says she's going to ""choir practice"" and evades, asking is dinner okay tomorrow, dad? Jenny returns to the group with faux party stories, just as Asher-y boy arrives in a car that James Bond might own. Blair eats chocolate cake with a frowny face.

Serena and Eric are leaving the Palace Hotel - Eric contrasts a plaid shoulder strap with a striped tie, while Serena sports Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts-club vest under a great leather coat. Eric brings up all the Gossip Girl rumors floating around, Serena laughs off the rumor that *he* was GG (nice nod to the outside world!), but Eric is all evasive when Chuck calls S. He's all concerned she's heard from Georgina, but she says she's ok....

But then, Georgina is at Vanessa's coffee shop, where she's playing faux-naif to NYC, and thanks Vanessa and Dan for ""adopting"" her. It's total sweet action, where they dissect Jenny's crush on Asher and G plays dumb over Dan's girlfriend, someone named.... Serena? G is dying to meet this wonderful Serena as menacing music plays. Maybe tonight?

Back at school, Eric is eyeing Jenny and Asher as they smooch, and pulls Jenny over for a private discussion. He's all stalkery about her not returning calls, Jenny giggles and apologizes, then gushes about her new boytoy as Eric seethes. ""How well do you know him?"" Eric gloweringly asks. Jenny thinks he's being sweet, but it's way too creepy. Does Eric have a crush on Jenny? Um, something tells us that's not the story here.

Dan finds Serena, they smooch, he invites her to get together tonight. They banter (apparently last week's falling-out was minor) and Serena begs off on plans for an actual real SAT tutor session. Dan counters with ""dinner with Sarah"" but they try for something else. Meanwhile, Dan's a little frowny face over Jenny's new boyfriend. Serena says to lighten up.

G (with black nail polish) is watching as Dan exits, and Dan spys Asher making out with someone... OMG, a guy? He falls back, watches and waits, ducks back... but misses who it is Asher's been canoodling with.

At the Palace, Lily is making arrangements with the wedding planner when... Rufus shows up! Lily plays cool, but Rufus is looking for mom-style advice re Jenny. Lily relents.

Dan confronts Asher with the fact that he saw Asher kissing... a guy! Asher plays all butch, saying ""Are you calling me queer?"" Dan doesn't bat an eye and says yes (in full sensitive guy mode). Asher overcompensates with nasty comments about Jenny, who intervenes. Asher pivots with some suave invites, Jenny gets all defensive, Dan is left with no way to say what he knows. Jenny and Asher stalk away, Dan is befuddled.

S and B are conferencing on the Met Steps; B needs quality time, S is busy. Then Dan shows up, worried about Jenny. He spills that he's worried about Jenny, Blair's ears perk up for useful knowledge. Serena plays nicey-nice, saying give Jenny space.

Rufus and Lily are at her wedding dress boutique. Parent-child advice ensues (OMG, Rufus is reading Jenny's email), and Lily tells Rufus that raising girls is way tougher than raising boys. Jenny will come back to him, Lily says. Rufus plays gallant and slips a bracelet on Lily's wrist for her. Sweetness ensues.

OMG - Gossip Girl is rocking everyone's Verizon Wireless with the fact that Asher prefers boys, not girls! Comments about Vanessa Hudgens' feelings are bandied about to Jenny, and Blair comes around the corner, ready to pounce on Jenny's supposed humiliation. Blair says the guy-on-guy rumors are not her doing, Jenny says ha!

Serena gets a call from the hotel; a package is awating her from Georgina! She tells the concierge hold it until her arrival from school. As she dashes, Blair unwillingly walks up to Dan, calling him ""dirty."" She thinks he's outed Jenny's boyfriend. He denies, but he spills his knowledge of Asher's previous makeout session. Blair wants proof, since Gossip Girl is not the best source of late. (In addition to the Vanessa-Hudgens-Has-a-Gay-Boyfriend innuendo, we now get a Katie Holmes reference!) Dan does not want Jenny to get hurt, Blair says something mean with the word ""hag"" involved, Dan tells her she's on her own.

Back to Rufus and Lily - they're reminiscing as he suddenly sees her in her wedding dress. His breath is literally taken away. She's touched but wary. He's regretful. She apologizes - are we friends? He says yes, but there are total feelings there.

Jenny's at school, S rushes by as the wannabes quiz Jenny on how far she's gone with Asher. Jenny wavers, the girls continue in, Jenny plays it well (third base - really?) but not perfectly.

Blair's spies somehow manage to get Asher's cell phone -- apparently the boy takes inordinately long showers after lacrosse practice. B conveniently gets all cell phone messages to be forwarded to her. We likey!

Jenny surprises Asher at his mansion before the big party and totally starts sticking her tongue down his throat. He's freaked - or so we think. Then, he tells her how's he keeping up his part of the bargain by offering poor little Brooklyn Jenny status, entree into society, access, resources... in return, she needs to know what she gives him. Asher is being totally mean -- is what Gossip Girl said true? He pulls entitlement, saying to keep up the ruse (though he doesn't say exactly what it is) so she can throw her first Upper East Side party. Jenny is crushed but when Asher says they have to put those ""rumors"" to rest, she sadly asks what she need to do.

S is back at the Palace Hotel - G's gift is a video, apparently. S plugs the flash drive into her laptop -- G and an unknown man are setting up a video camera to record Serena. It's something sexual involving a ""Mr and Mrs Shepherd"" - we can tell from the audio (no video is seen) that S is being coerced somehow. Serena freaks, locks the flash drive in a drawer. As Serena's leaving, she runs into Lily -- turns out Georgina just invited herself to a quiet van der Woodsen family dinner! S is so totally screwed.

Back in Brooklyn, Gossip Girl is totally insinuating that Jenny lost her virginity to Asher! Dan is angry, apparently being on GG's mailing list. He counters her on the whole Asher-being-gay thing, she realizes he saw Asher making out with a boy, Dan asks why is she doing this? He's the voice of reason, she accuses him of being judgemental AND sending tips to Gossip Girl. Get out of my room, nosy big brother!

Blair calls Serena, who can't take the call due to family dinner. Eric is being a little snot, Georgina asks Lily about her wedding plans, G butters up Lily about the impending nuptials. S is unhappy, Eric is smug, Georgina..... uh-oh! She totally outs Eric at the dinner table! SHE saw Eric making out with a guy! She plays like it's cool, but then fake-realizes she's made a mistake.... Lily won't acknowledge that her son might be.... she can't say it. She asks, Eric won't answer and leaves the table, Serena chastises Georgina, who's smug as a bug in a rug.

Jenny's leaving for choir practice... but Rufus calls her on the Asher party. He tells her she's not going. Arguments ensue, as well as threats. She is so not a little girl anymore! Sadly, she's lost his trust.... does she want to lose his respect too? The stakes are too high for Jenny -- she goes, crushing Rufus.

Back at the Palace, Serena goes in to see Eric, trying to make things right. Both are sad that he couldn't tell her he's gay, and that she didn't make the time to connect with him. Eric says he's OK, but Serena says she's there for him. Despite the emotional mess both are in, he admits Asher's his boyfriend, Serena says she's proud of him, they hug. She vows to stand by his side - but Eric says he has to stop by Asher's party. Someone is there he needs to talk to!

Asher's party is a riot of Upper East Side glitz by way of MySpace -- with LOTS of plaid. Blair is seen arriving/crashing -- looking GREAT in a dress and pearls Daisy Buchanan would kill to own. (If you don't know who that is, buy The Great Gatsby *right now*!) She warns the wannabes something big is about to happen, then goes to find the host. Everyone is intrigued!

Serena (in a great minidress) has apparently found her way to Brooklyn and Vanessa's coffee shop - Dan is there, glad that she can finally meet Sarah. S says this is not the time.... but guess who's *right there*? Sarah/Georgina! It is SO NICE to finally meet you, Serena! Serena is shocked to the core, Georgina plays her part perfectly....she's an aspiring filmmaker like Vanessa, and has a ""short film"" she'd like to show the Brooklyn crew. Would S like to view as well? Serena sends Dan away, confrontation ensues. G says it's like old times, S is saying this is so not old times and they are so not friends! G counters with.... well, if they're enemies, Dan sees the video. S backpedals, G pockets the ""short film,"" Serena escapes unscathed... for now.

At the party, Jenny's going on about how great Asher is when the wannabes inform her Blair is there! B strides up to Asher, taps him on the shoulder a la Les Liaisons Dangereuses and infoms him they need to talk! (Love how she did it with a cell phone and not a fan!) Asher relents - it's his phone she's tapping him with. He's cool as he asks her what she's going to do with her evidence, and Blair shows the one little piece of her heart, saying she won't expose what she knows because she cares about who's involved. Just then, Eric (said person involved who's cared for) enters, confronts Asher, who is aghast. (By the way, everyone is watching now) Who's going to tell Jenny? OMG, Eric fessed up to the kissing, but Jenny backs up Asher's so-not-straight story that it didn't happen. Eric professes he's gay, Asher calls him a fag, Eric storms off, and then Blair forwards *all* of Asher's texts, emails and photos to Gossip Girl! Blair is somehow simultaneously smug and noble.

Lily has called Rufus - how did she not know her own son was gay? Rufus says we don't always know the people we're the closest to the best, echoing his contretemps with Jenny. Love is the answer, when you're a parent waiting for your kid to come back to you. The two bond, with romantic overtones.

Update -- Gossip Girl has the proof that Asher was involved in same-sex smooching and that Jenny was lying about giving up her virginity. Blair feels queenly, and seems about to sweep the wannabes away from Asher's party. They offer Jenny one last out -- did J sleep with Dog Walker/Owner boy? Jenny admits exaggerating -- the wannabes can understand dating a gay guy but NOT lying to one's friends. Jenny is branded ""L"" for liar! All fall to Blair now, who says no plans tonight, but perhaps tomorrow? Jenny is saddened.

Lily is waiting up for Eric -- she apologizes for her earlier reaction. Eric plays strong and honest, so she offers to be honest and upfront too. She's scared, she wants the best for her kids, and is worried about him. He says he's better now that he's honest. The two hug.

Blair is at her penthouse savoring her victory (now plastered all over the internet) when in walks..... Jenny! J says she's done with it all. Blair is dubious while Jenny is sincere. Jenny says it's not all worth it, Blair says (with a bit of sympathy) that there's a price to pay, Blair acknowledges that Jenny put up a good fight. The two don't exactly see eye to eye, but understand one another better. Still, why does Blair narrow her eyes like that, as if she's still threatened?

Back to Dan and Serena - does Serena like his new pal Sarah? Um, not so much. Is she jealous, Dan asks. S realizes how much Georgina/Sarah has infiltrated herself into Dan's life. She asks him not to trust this new girl, Dan shows some backbone and angrily asks why -- he's maybe finding the end of his rapidly fraying Serena rope. He sends S off home, but with a caveat to talk... Serena is as usual balky.

S and G get a moment alone - what does G want? She wants things to be like how they were before ""that night"" when everything got all screwed up. Can't they be friends again? Serena is aghast -- um, no! Um, yes, Georgina counters. G can indeed do things -- because she can. She has the power -- over Serena's family, friends, and new boyfriend. Oh, look -- a cab! Get home safe, Serena.

Dan and Rufus are playing Scrabble - Dan's word choices are proving therapeutic (angry, girl, etc etc). Jenny returns in full party outfit, sad. Words aren't spoken at first, then Jenny asks if she can join the game. Rufus says yes. Jenny cries on Rufus' shoulder -- she's sorry about everything.

Meanwhile, Serena shows up at Blair's penthouse on the verge of tears. What's wrong, Serena? What happened? Blair implores S to tell her what's wrong, despite Serena's protests. S can't and says it would make Blair a part of it. Blair says you can tell me anything..... she loves her... what is it?

OMG! SERENA SAYS SHE KILLED SOMEONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

OMG SERENA SAID SHE KILLED SOMEONE!!!!!!

(Deep breath. Relax. Ready? Okay.)

It's the day after the big confession -- Georgina is trying to call Serena, leaving messages in a very I'm-imitating-Glenn-Close-In-An-Oscar-Nominated-80s-Thriller kind of way (but with way better hair). No reply at all, as Phil Collins would say.

In Brooklyn, Rufus is practicing guitar, ready for his Rolling Stone (product placement!) gig about forgotten bands of the 90s. Dan counters with a nasty remark towards the Starbucks demographic, Rufus laughs it off and offers a VH1 joke ready for Dan... who doesn't make one, on account of a sleepless night. Total girl trouble! Dan says Serena isn't telling him the whole truth, Rufus says Dan is way judgemental.... Dan is offended at first but takes the advice.

Still in Brooklyn, Nate is rocking a sweater outfit and tousled hairstyle that says he just rolled out of bed in Manhattan and sauntered his way across the East River to Vanessa, who is Rufus' honorary roadie for the ""big gig"" tonight. A phone call keeps the two from serioius flirting.... uh oh, sounds serious! Nate has to run, he offers explanations and asks what she's doing tonight. Can he meet her at the concert. It's a real date!

Lily is preparing for the wedding, but does she remember she also has a Rolling Stone (placement again?) interview? Dan stops by, but no one's seen Serena. Chuck saunters in wearing a beige-type golf outfit, complete with plaid pants. Has Chuck seen Serena? Nope, and a phone call Chuck receives gives the impression no one knows where S is.

Nate enters a wood-paneled elevator, just as former-friend-turned-enemy Chuck enters. Both are headed to....Blair's penthouse? The maid tells the dynamic duo to wait... Blair's on her way!

Back to creepy Georgina -- leaving the three-thousandth message for Serena. She's got coffee -- such a good ploy! Uh oh - Dan spots ""Sarah"" who plays the OMG-what-a-coincidence card! Sarah is all concerned, offering advice. Just then... Serena calls! But wait - it's some bartender, calling the first name on Serena's speed-dial. Things do not look promising... and Dan looks sad, but plays good guy.

Blair arrives back at her penthouse -- she needs Chuck and Nate's help. Actually, ""we"" need their help. Serena is slumped in the elevator. Chuck and Nate play noble men and drag Serena upstairs, while Blair orders coffee from the maid. Must have been a bad night!

The three try to clean up Serena and wake her up -- keep her talking! Chuck saunters in with hangover food, Nate turns away as Blair undresses S, but good old Chuck leers at the Victoria's Secret underthings revealed. ""Just like old times,"" Chuck says. Serena throws up on cue.

Blair explains the sitch - Serena confessed something totally crazy, B went to find her mom's Valium (a good friend, that B!), but Serena then disappeared and it took B all night to find S. Chuck wants to know the crazy confession, but Blair dodges artfully.

Rufus is unloading for his gig alongside Vanessa -- should dad be worried about Dan? Vanessa says it's all about a friend called ""Sarah."" Just then, a vintage pic of Rufus is unfurled.... Turns out Lily took Rufus' iconic image (so says the Rolling Stone reporter). The reporter unleashes with the questions -- when was Lily involved with Rufus? Why did she give up photography? Before or after she broke Rufus' heart? Just then Dan arrives -- Lily is totally relieved. Who's seen Serena? Maybe ""Charles""? (That would be Chuck) Lily tries to send Mr. Reporter on his way, but he presses on with the how-much-did-you-love-Rufus interrogation. Lily stammers... she wasn't in love with him.... that much! End of interview.

Dan arrives at B's penthouse, where it's Serena Central with Blair, Chuck and Nate. Dan wonders at the unusual convergence. They try (badly) to tell him that Serena's not there, but B offers up a story... Serena does *not* want to see Dan! Brooklyn Boy tries to laugh it off, but he wants to see her -- for super-serious. Just then Serena arrives, pale with hair pulled back in purple velour robe.

""What's happening?"" Dan asks. It's hard to explain. He wants to know her secret. What is the deal? Who are the guys from the bar? She doesn't know -- looks like she really doesn't know. Then he asks if she slept with someone else. He's serious, she sees a reason to push Dan away from the truth and says yes. Dan says he's done. OMG!

As Dan enters the elevator, ""Sarah"" calls all concerned - does Dan want to meet her? She's a real good listener. The answer is... yes.

Lily's back in full-on wedding planner mode. She's had three perfect weddings before and wants this one to be more perfect than perfect! Just then Blair's maid calls with news... Serena is like the ""old days."" Lily should be worried for her daughter. Uh oh! Lily now has to run a very familiar errand.

Lily starts searching Serena's room and finds.... the flash drive with the dreaded video!

Back at Blair's, Serena explains she didn't do anything bad the previous night, and would rather have Dan think she cheated than...know what she really did? Nate is curious! Dan can't know the truth... and even Chuck is getting scared! Blair says she can tell them anything, and a quick recitation of past misdeeds (Chuck and Blair in a limo, Nate and Serena on a bar, Chuck being, after all, Chuck) is offered up. They totally won't judge! Really! They're the non-judging Breakfast Club! What is it, Serena?

""If I tell you, it can never leave this room!"" Cut to commercial, naturally.

Back to the story - remember Georgina? Chuck lost his virginity to her in the sixth grade. Something happened the night of the Shephard wedding -- something S wants to escape, but G is blackmailing her. Turns out that was where Nate and Serena got down and dirty -- skp that part, please, says B. But then, after... Serena left in a rush, flags a cab to Georgina's hotel, where G has a surprise waiting.

Just then, Lily is watching G's video - Georgina and a mystery man are planting a camera for an actual-real Serena van der Woodsen sex tape. Is she down for it, asks Mystery Man? Georgina says S goes down for anything! (Reowr!) Serena arrives but is a total downer about having boinked Nate. Mystery Man wants a party... so break out the favors! OMG, it's cocaine! Serena demurs and goes to hurl; G says S is always frisky after reverse peristalsis (our words, not G's). Lily fast-forwards (whew - thank you! Get to the good stuff!). Mystery Man wants to make out, Serena is not in the mood, but sluggishly acquieses. Soon she's into it... Lily stops the video!

Back at Blair's, B asks S to press on with the story... back to Mystery Man on top of S. Serena tries to put him off with more cocaine. He does some... and then promptly overdoses. S goes to call 911, but Georgina bursts in and stops her. Get the drugs, get his phone, get out of there! Still, Serena calls 911 but G drags her out. G splits but S waits to see the paramedics helping ""Pete"" and gets a full view of the body bag instead. After that, boarding school was a good idea... and B understands why S left. Savvy Nate asks what Georgina wants. And S spills the Georgina/Sarah story. Tell Dan, everyone says! Serena says OMG no! He'll never speak to her again! Truth brings consequences after all, says Gossip Girl.

At the Palace, it's Lily's big rehearsal dinner. Serena and Blair and Chuck arrive -- Lily sweeps her daughter off and grills her like a steak. What about the drugs, and the video she watched? Serena panics, but turns out Lily never got to the drug overdose hijinks. Lily tears up -- what has her daughter become? Ah -- seems like Lily thinks this happened recently! And proffers reformatory school as a cure for it all! Serena is stunned.

In Brooklyn, Sarah and Dan arrive for Rufus' concert with... special guest star Lisa Loeb? Yes, the real singer! Sarah/Georgina is super-nice to dad, and Dan offers the rationale for why Jenny's not in this episode (she's at mom's). Uh oh - a girl in the audience yells out, ""Hey, Georgina!"" G/S ducks and takes Dan over for a drink.

Back at Lily's, Blair confronts icy mom and politely dresses her down, sadness in her eyes. Serena has a secret that is finally catching up with her -- Blair needs Lily's help. Serena needs Lily's help. There's a story Lily doesn't know. Lily goes to find out.

Nate's on his way to Rufus' concert to meet Vanessa -- in the night's most shocking turn, he says he's going to take the subway! Vanessa laughs and says look for Dan, who's there with new girl Sarah. Nate is on point all of a sudden, Vanessa is confused.... Nate tells V that she should SO not trust Sarah, who is really Georgina and he will explain it all when he gets there. Nate then calls Blair -- after ""ews"" are exchanged re Rufus/Vanessa/concert/location-outside-of-Manhattan, Nate gets down to business: Georgina is at the concert. Blair says she'll meet him in 10.

Meanwhile, Lily is off to ""help"" Serena - to juvenile hall, from the sound of it. She kisses Chuck's dad and heads out. Meanwhile redux, Blair tells Chuck she knows where Georgina is. Chuck is totally in to get the evil G. The two are reunited, and it feels somewhat good!

(We failed to mention Blair is again rocking an updated Daisy Buchanan look. We likey!)

Lily and Serena are in a limo -- somehow Lily found out about dead Mystery Man, and tells S to confront his parents. Lily will be right by her side! Whew - no juvie!

Lisa Loeb is hosting the Rufus gig, as Sarah/Georgina runs into Vanessa, who's dubious about her so-called new pal. V is full-on Brooklyn - you got anything to say to me, Georgina? Um, Nate's on his way! G plays dumb, V steps it up and says she has a chance to explain. G walks away. Um, do NOT mess with V, who starts to explain to Dan, but is called away on a Rufus-related errand. Uh oh - what's happening?!?!?

Dan is curious, and serious, and finds Georgina, who's turning on the waterworks.

Lily and Serena emerge from Mystery Man's parents, who apparently have told the two that he was an addict who couldn't stop. Serena still feels guilty, but Lily tells her it's not her fault. Serena is really a good person! Lily's sorry she doubted her. The two hug. And Serena has to do something else -- take her to see Dan!

OMG OMG -- more shocking than Nate promising to take the subway is Lisa Loeb going into a full-on rendition of ""Stay."" Yes, she's wearing the glasses. Meanwhile, Dan is getting G's full story -- there was a mean ex-boyfriend, and G got really scared and left -- is this for real? Ha - it's not! Wow, good cover! G had to change her name to get away from fictional evil boyfriend. Sadly, Dan is buying it all (apparently influenced by the mellow song stylings of Ms. Loeb). G turns on the heat -- she's been falling for him! Oh, she shouldn't have said! Dan wants to talk now -- for him, that's foreplay! G is smug as a bug in a rug. Evil girl - oh, we likey!

Back at the concert, Rufus is rocking out with an acoustic guitar -- is Rufus really singing? It doesn't totally suck! Vanessa finds Nate, who's brought Blair and Chuck to her dismay. Where's Georgina? Apparently she took off, V's not sure where. Nate and Vanessa go off just as Serena arrives - where's Dan? S tells B it's all over now - she can tell Dan everything!

Backstage, Lily is calling her fiance, but hears dreamy Rufus singing. She's drawn to him, fails to make the call... old feelings emerge. Away goes the cell phone. Lily and Rufus make eye contact, and he sings directly to her. She loves it. But then she leaves! What's happening?!?!?!? No, get away, Lisa Loeb - Rufus does not want to do an encore! He confronts Lily outside, she brutally rebuffs him, then they kiss -- and she's the one who leans in! It's the most action we've seen all episode!

Serena's looking desperately for Dan -- who suddenly calls! She's so happy -- but not for long, as it's Georgina calling from Dan's phone. G found out S told their secret. S isn't afraid of her any more but now -- but now G informs her former pal all bets are off! What is G going to do? It's not what she's going to do, it's who she's going to do it with -- just as Dan walks up with coffee for his new friend Georgina. G hangs up. Dan asks how things went with her mom on the phone, while G offers up a lame story and switches their phones back, and then moves in for the kill....er, kiss! G kisses first, Dan assesses the situation... and kisses back!

Quick cut back to Serena, who is clearly worried. Dan and Georgina walk off hand in hand.

Next week: Wedding! Fisticuffs! Come-uppance! Confrontations! Classical music! Season finale!"

Serena is trying to reach Dan - she hasn't slept all night and has officially filled his voice mail. She's coming over now! Taxi is hailed.

Back at the Palace -- yowza, it's the morning after for Lily... and Rufus! He gets a call -- it's about a gig. They both have an OMG moment - Lily suddenly has morning after awareness; he just got a call about a tour for his band! Oh yeah, there's her wedding that day too. Everyone is bathed in orange light as awkwardness and sweet emotion ensues. (Rufus has an amazing bird tattoo - who knew?) Breaking up the stilted intimacy is a call from Bart -- oh yeah, that's Chuck's dad, who Lily is marrying -- who insists they meet up in an hour. Any talking points, Rufus asks pointedly? Lily says she'll think of something.

It's also the morning after for.... Chuck and Blair? Actually, they just fell asleep clothed and everything, and she smacks his arm once they wake up, dispelling all la-la music. Bantering ensues - turns out they'd been plotting about Georgina. (Bonus points for the scarf joke - you have to actually see/hear it to get it) Chuck has to go be best man, Blair literally pushes him out the door, they argue nonstop but the sparks are flying, flying! Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn have nothing to worry about, but it's total Philadelphia Story-style action.

Nate and his dad (remember him?) are jogging around the Central Park reservoir. Nate's mom isn't going to Lily's wedding? Nate is confused, Dad makes excuses, Nate is bummed that mom can't meet Vanessa... something is afoot, we thinks. Too bad Nate is so clueless.... ooh, Nate's dad is making plans for shenanigans!

Serena shows up at Dan's Brooklyn loft - she is so glad to see him! Apologies ensue.... just as Georgina walks out! Smirks/shocks are had all around - it's offically a bizarre love triangle!

Conflict time! G tries to bow out but Serena will have none of it. Dan is being nice guy, Georgina is playing wide-eyed ingenue... and then Serena (finally!) lets loose, calling G a ""psycho bitch"" and accusing her of planning this ALL THE TIME! Dan is flummoxed, and Serena says she'll tell Dan ""everything.""

Flash forward to the end of the story; she wanted to tell him everything! And of course, Dan being Dan is super-nice guy despite the sex-with-Nate/drug-overdose-guy/boarding-school story. Um yeah, Dan, it is a lot to digest! Of course, he wishes she'd told him sooner, but he totally gets it. It's all over, right? S asks. They can fix this? Dan is unsure, Serena totally is in denial mode.... she'll see him at the wedding. He kisses her on the forehead - wow, how ambivalent can you be? But then, Serena says she told her mom this might be ""forever"" and Dan is truly touched... quite the mess, eh?

Dan then calls.... Blair?

Lily meets Bart (Edith Wharton fans take note) at a strange, empty loft that Carrie Bradshaw might have owned had she gotten a big book deal. (Bad cabinets) It's the first building he bought... Lily notes how comforting it is to revisit the first things we loved (remorse note!). But Bart is not young anymore, and he's outgrown owning this building. What should Bart do? Let the building go? Lily says yes. He asks pointedly (watchword of the episode) if she can do the same. We know the answer - yes.

Dan and Blair are in cute cahoots over Georgina, calling her from Blair's penthouse. He spills a story to G's voice mail about a huge fight with Serena, not knowing what to believe, and can she please call him? Blair commends him on his subterfuge, but Dan is uncomfortable with the dangerous liaisons. Right on schedule G calls back! Dan is good at the lying, actually... G falls for it. ""Our spot in the park by the pond?""

""See you there!""

B is impressed - Dan is a born liar! Would he like to spill more details? Er, no!

In the park, Dan and Georgina are faux-bonding. Then Dan calls her on her BS, and G backpedals nicely... Dan is confused since they did, um, you know, do it. G is manipulative while Dan is seriously considering how his relationship with Serena is changed. OMG, where are you, Blair?! Finally, B shows up wearing clashing tablecloths -- she's brought Georgina's parents! And they brought the wrath that hell wrought! Blair closes the deal on G (kudos on the Barcelona lisp in ""Ibiza"") as G's mom descends.... and Blair reveals G will be attending a boot camp for troubled girls! Oh yeah, hadn't Georgina heard? There's only room for one ""crazy bitch"" around here, and Blair holds that title. SNAP!

In Brooklyn, Dan is quizzing Rufus on the new tour (Rufus is still showing off the tattoo) and totally calls him on not coming home last night! And oh yeah, dad, there's a wedding I'm going to -- are you intrigued? Rufus totally is. The wedding is happening? Dan reveals that the reason Lily stayed away from Rufus is because Serena asked her to, for the sake of the Dan-Serena lovey-doveyness. Rufus is a bit speechless.... more than a bit, actually.

(BTW, when did Dan start growing chest hair?)

Meanwhile, Jenny (remember her?) has designed a fab wedding outfit for Vanessa (variations on a theme in orange) that Dan is appreciative of. Platonic smiles all around!

The wedding preparations are in fourth gear - Blair shows up wearing a pink floral shower curtain disguised as a mini-dress (love the headband!). She approaches Chuck, more bantering ensues and B tells Chuck how they buried Georgina. So, save the last dance for him? She grabs his fey bowtie, kicks his shin and tells him Serena is the last thing they had in common, so no dice!

(OMG, they are totally getting it on by end of this episode!)

Nate shows up with his dad, and stares daggers at Chuck. Unpleasantries are exchanged; the make-up artist has given special attention to Nate's cheekbones.

Blair comforts Serena indoors -- what, is it a floral-themed wedding? (Pink for Blair, yellow for Serena) Is Dan coming? Is all forgiven? Serena's working on it. Blair is concerned.

Uh oh, Nate's dad is dealing in some shady business - drugs? Chuck sees it all. Can Chuck's goon keep an eye on Nate's dad?

Lily is preparing in front of the mirror as..... Rufus walks in! Cut to commercial, naturally. (Did you know 90210 is coming back? Totes!)

WHAT is Rufus doing there?! Lily is flustered. Does she want him to leave? Lily is still flustered. He's ready to call off the wedding for her (wow, we got our Philadelphia Story couples mixed up!) but while she's affectionate, it can't happen. It's been 20 years. This is not the moment. She's ready to marry Bart, so there - too many questions! What about Dan and Serena? Rufus is strong, Lily is rambling. Do those 20 years count for anything?

Eric (remember him?) asks where Lily is as violins begin to play. Vanessa steps out of a cab, tugging her orange dress alongside Dan. Yes, Dan has to talk to Serena, who shows up. OMG, he *says* he didn't sleep with Georgina, ""but I may as well have."" What does THAT mean?! Sorry, S, time for a wedding - no answers now!

Lily and Rufus emerge -- and tell each other they love each other! Is the wedding off? Apparently not. He wishes her well and sends her on her merry way, loving yet sad.

Everyone is seated (finally) as Serena makes a surly trip down the aisle, followed by Lily. Bart is impressed, as are the violins. Chuck is supportive. Eric is sad. Gossip Girl intones that Dan and Serena are about to ""F things up"" -- is Serena's mascara going to run?

It's the reception -- Dan and Serena are picking at their food, awkward to the nth degree. Dan needs to talk; Serena needs air. Meanwhile, Chuck's goon reports back on Nate's dad, and Chuck will totally be right back. Time to talk to Nate, since his Dad's leaving for somewhere. Vanessa is concerned. Nate makes excuses, because like his dad is clean now, no drugs! What is Chuck insinuating? Chuck actually makes a full-out confession - he was in love with Blair (!!!!) and now is no time to argue when Nate's dad might be in trouble! Nate glares then storms off to investigate. Vanessa is bereft.

Nate stops his dad's limo -- what is up? Dad says he left a note at home -- saying what, Nate asks. Have you relapsed, dad? No, he wasn't buying drugs -- he's skipping the country to avoid jail time! Dad is totally guilty, so time to go. Nate is disillusioned, especially when he finds out mom is in cahoots on this. It's the best thing for everyone. And then, after a whole season Nate finally grows a pair and punches his dad.

(Nate still has yet to trim his bangs, however.)

Chuck is concerned on the sidelines.

Blair sidles up to Vanessa and tries to make her feel bad. Um, B, do you not know Vanessa will get all Brooklyn on you? Still, B thrusts and parries in with a really good dig on how Nate never got over Serena and oh, she must be familiar with that considering Dan's feelings? V looks ready to whomp on her when Eric shows up to break the tension. Crisis averted!

Nate and Chuck are bonding, apologizing, etc etc etc. Wow, is Chuck really in love with Blair? Looks like. Then Vanessa shows up - Chuck, please go inside! It's a long story, Nate intones. Vanessa, unsurprisingly but sincerely, says she has time.

Dan finally corners Serena -- don't run away! Serena is willing to let the Georgina-Dan hooking-up go, and doesn't want to break up..... but OMG, Dan does! Tears are starting to flow, and while Dan is the most understanding person in the world (his words), this all is just way too much. S reveals her tortured psyche -- lying, etc etc. Where are they now? Back to square one? Too much has happened, Dan says. It's just, ""Have a good summer"" now? ""I guess,"" Dan says.

Wow, it's over. Really, truly, sadly.

Back at the reception, Chuck is proposing a toast. It's eloquent but nice... and then he puts down his speech, and starts speaking his heart (or what Chuck has of one) directly to Blair. She rolls her eyes but is touched. Serena, who's just arrived, is saddened with all the budding love in the room.

Chuck and Blair dance.....more bantering ensues, but in a sweeter tone. ""You don't belong with Nate.... Never have... Never will."" They move in. OMG - who knew the sweetest kiss would be had between Chuck and Blair?!

More awkwardness between Serena and Dan - photos for the wedding album? So they can remember this night forever? Ugh!

And Blair uncovers Chuck's biggest secret... he's a romantic. Take it slow this time? She's all for it.

Wait... Dan doesn't want to stop dancing once the photographer is gone? Total ambiguity!

Yowza - now it's one week later! Rufus is on the road and Jenny calls... and she got an internship at Parsons! With Eleanor Waldorf Designs! (Yeah, that's Blair's mom!)

And now, Blair and Chuck are off to Tuscany -- S is helping her pack for the private plane ride. Blair confides to Chuck's new stepsister -- he brings out the worst in her (cue kinky underwear), she brings out the best in him. Who knew? Serena's ears are bleeding, but she's happy her pal is going off for the summer. Has S talked to Dan? No, and it's for the best -- Serena is totally fine.

Chuck and Nate are doing phone bonding -- they're total BFFs now. While Chuck's off to Italy, will Nate be sweating it out in Brooklyn? Chuck asks what happened with him and Vanessa (who Chuck refers to as ""Punky Brewster"") just as Dan asks V what happened with her and Nate (who he calls ""Man Bangs"" complete with hand gestures over the forehead). Dan barrages Vanessa with questions, but Brooklyn V catches him on his game -- he talks so she won't ask him questions about Serena! Dan is not ready to talk about it; V is glad, he'll be quiet. Ha -- not likely! Vanessa looks at him sweetly -- friends, or more.....?

In Manhattan, Serena runs into Nate, and both are bemused over the Chuck-Blair coupling. Turns out S is off to the Hamptons, she needs a break - they both do. But hey! Does Nate want to reflect with Serena on everything? Mmmmmaybe.....

Blair is at Teterboro waiting for Chuck, and kind of flirts with a Bass Industries (is that right?) intern, while Chuck wants to see his dad before heading off.... Dad is all nice, and proud, while Chuck chafes affectionately. Then Bart gets hardcore, about the fidelity, and lovingness, and other people's feelings, and growing up... Chuck looks panicked! Feelings? Chuck knows not of these feelings! Does Chuck want to come back a new man? Uh oh!

Oh, hello! Lily walks in with ""Amelia,"" a blonde looker who's helping with apartment renovations. Chuck gets another text from B, ""Can't wait to see u!"" Amelia is... hungry. Chuck is intrigued, takes roses meant for Blair, trashes them except for one and approaches Ameila. ""I'm Chuck Bass."" Oh, Chuck! Noooooooo!

Blair is still waiting... Chuck is late. She gets another text. He'll be flying commercial at a later date. Cute intern tells Blair he'll ""flip you for the jump seat."" With a line like that, how can B (or we) refuse? Chuck who? Jump seats for everyone!

What will the summer bring, Gossip Girl wonders. Rufus appears to be writing a song -- for Lily? Jenny is prepping various outfits for her internship. Dan and Vanessa are bonding in Brooklyn, while Serena and Nate are doing the same in Manhattan... just as Blair's helicopter takes off. A scorching summer? Remains to be seen! XOXO, Gossip Girl."

He believes that he is being followed by men in suits, possibly over his actions the night before. In a flashback, Elliot engineers a child pornographer's arrest by hacking the man's computer and sending its illegal content to the police. On the train ride home, he again sees the men in suits along with a man in glasses who attempts to talk to him. The next day, Elliot reports to work at Allsafe Security, where he provides computer security for the very corporations that he despises. The episode cuts to Elliot at a therapy session, where he explains how he has hacked his therapist, Krista, and has unsuccessfully attempted to hack her boyfriend, Michael Hansen. The scene cuts back to the office where Allsafe is preparing to host their largest client, the multi-national conglomerate E Corp (which Elliot refers to as ""Evil Corp""). During their tour of the office, Elliot has a strange interaction with E Corp's Senior VP of Technology, Tyrell Wellick.

After work, Elliot snorts morphine to help him cope with his depression and loneliness and afterward takes suboxone in case he goes through withdrawal. Elliot takes Molly with his neighbor and drug dealer, Shayla, and they have sex. The next morning, he gets a notification on his phone that Krista has checked in at a local restaurant with Michael. Using a ruse, Elliot manages to get Krista's boyfriend's telephone number. While walking home, Elliot receives a panicked phone call from Angela, his childhood best friend, begging him to come back to work. At the office, Elliot finds Lloyd (a colleague of Elliot's) and Angela attempting to stop a DDoS attack on E Corp's servers. Elliot realizes that they cannot stop the hack locally because of the rootkit that the hackers wrote and placed in the root directory of the server (CS 30), and together with Allsafe's owner Gideon he flies to E Corp's server farm to stop the hack in person. While examining the hacked server, Elliot finds a file with a message in it for him. The message simply says, ""Leave me here,"" and after a quick debate with himself, he changes the file so that only he can access it but leaves it on the server.

On his train ride home from Allsafe, Elliot is once again confronted by the man in glasses, whom he refers to as Mr. Robot because of the logo on his shirt. Mr. Robot tells Elliot to follow him off the train, but only if he didn't delete the file from E Corp's server. They head to an abandoned arcade in Coney Island, where Mr. Robot explains that they are the hackers that attacked E Corp's server. Saving their file instead of deleting it was a test, which Elliot has passed. Mr. Robot welcomes Elliot into ""fsociety,"" the name the hackers have chosen. Elliot returns home and compiles all the evidence needed to turn fsociety into the FBI. Elliot visits Mr. Robot again to tell him that he will be turning him in. They take a ride on a Ferris wheel where Mr. Robot asks Elliot to modify the file to show that E Corp's CTO Terry Colby was behind the hack instead of fsociety. Mr. Robot offers Elliot the chance to take E Corp down completely, and Elliot returns home where he modifies the data file as asked. In a meeting with E Corp, the FBI, and Allsafe the next day, Elliot prepares to give the FBI the evidence against fsociety. However, after Terry Colby insults Angela and has her removed from the meeting, he changes his mind and gives the FBI the falsified info that incriminates Colby.

Nineteen days later, Elliot is still waiting for something to happen to Terry Colby or E Corp. To occupy his mind, Elliot turns back to hacking Krista's boyfriend. He discovers that the man is using a fake name and profile, and actually is married to someone else. He confronts and threatens the man, telling him that he must reveal his deception to Krista, or Elliot will dump all his collected evidence on the man's wife. Elliot also demands that the man gives him his dog, which he had been abusing. In his next therapy session, Elliot sees Krista is obviously emotionally distracted and knows that the man broke up with her. Elliot returns to work and attempts to patch his relationship with Angela, who hasn't spoken to him since the meeting with the FBI. They make up, and as they hug, everyone in the office begins to stare. They realize that everyone is staring at the TV monitor behind them, which is showing the news that Terry Colby has been arrested by the FBI. Elliot goes to Times Square to watch the news, but he is confronted by the men in the suits. They take him in a car to E Corp's headquarters, and at the end of the episode, he walks down a long hallway into a room to be confronted by Tyrell Wellick."
