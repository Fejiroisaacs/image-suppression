While Prince Viserys, Jaehaerys' oldest grandson, was chosen, several lords supported Princess Rhaenys, Jaehaerys' oldest living descendant.

Nine years into Viserys's reign, his wife, Queen Aemma Arryn, is again with child. After many failed pregnancies, Viserys is certain Aemma will bear a healthy son. A great tournament is organized to celebrate the impending birth. Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, insists that Prince Daemon, Viserys's brother and heir presumptive, is unfit to rule, citing his brutal methods as Commander of the City Watch, but Viserys ignores his advice.

At the tournament, Viserys's only living child, Princess Rhaenyra, and her companion, Lady Alicent Hightower, Ser Otto's daughter, are intrigued by Ser Criston Cole, a handsome, common-born knight who defeats the popular Daemon in both jousting and melee. Meanwhile, Aemma suffers a breech birth that drastically risks both her life and her baby's. Viserys allows Grand Maester Mellos to perform a cesarean section, hoping to save the child, though knowing the procedure will kill Aemma. The infant, named Baelon, dies hours after his mother. Rhaenyra's dragon Syrax cremates their remains during the funeral.

At Ser Otto's request, Alicent makes a condolence visit to Viserys. Ser Otto later informs the Small Council that, at a local brothel, Daemon mockingly referred to the deceased Baelon as ""the heir for a day."" When confronted, Daemon says Viserys never supported him and claims he is a weak king manipulated by others, particularly Ser Otto. Outraged, Viserys removes Daemon as his heir in favor of Rhaenyra and banishes Daemon from King's Landing.

Viserys tells Rhaenyra a secret passed down through the generations: their ancestor Aegon the Conqueror dreamt of a threat from the North that Westeros can only defeat if a Targaryen sits on the Iron Throne. The lords of Westeros swear fealty to Rhaenyra as crown princess, while Daemon and his lover, Mysaria, depart atop his dragon, Caraxes."

He is known as the Crabfeeder because he nails his enemies to posts on the beach, leaving them to be slowly eaten alive by crabs.

Six months have passed since Rhaenyra's anointing as heir to the Iron Throne. Master of Ships Lord Corlys Velaryon demands that the Small Council take action after the Triarchy-backed pirates destroy four Westerosi vessels. Viserys refuses, wanting to avoid open warfare with Essos. He dismisses Rhaenyra's suggestion to show force against Drahar, and instead relegates her to choosing a new Kingsguard knight. Over protests from Otto and newly-appointed Lord Commander Ser Harrold Westerling, she chooses Ser Criston, the only candidate with actual battle experience.

Lady Alicent continues to secretly console Viserys. She eventually advises that he speak with Rhaenyra about Queen Aemma's death and the expectation for a king to remarry. Ser Corlys and Rhaenys suggest that Viserys unite their Houses by marrying their twelve-year-old daughter, Lady Laena Velaryon.

The Small Council learns Daemon, who previously seized Dragonstone, stole the dragon egg that was intended for the late Prince Baelon and has declared his intentions to marry his mistress, Mysaria, who he claims is pregnant, as his second wife. Ser Otto persuades Viserys to allow him to confront Daemon.

Daemon, who is illegally occupying Dragonstone, is supported by a loyal cadre of City Watch guards. Ser Otto and a small detachment arrive to confront Daemon, demanding he return the dragon egg. As bloodshed looms, Rhaenyra arrives on her dragon, Syrax. She persuades Daemon to peacefully return the egg to her.

Rhaenyra's disobedience in going to Dragonstone angers the king, prompting a heartfelt discussion regarding his remarrying to fortify the Targaryen line of succession. Ultimately, Viserys announces his intention to wed Alicent, shocking and angering both Rhaenyra and Lord Corlys.

Lord Corlys, insulted by Viserys rejecting his daughter's hand in marriage, secretly meets with Prince Daemon. Lord Corlys proposes they form an alliance to retake the Stepstones, using the victory to their mutual advantage."

Enemy commander Craghas ""The Crabfeeder"" Drahar and his forces have engaged in guerilla tactics, raiding Lord Corlys Velaryon's fleets at night and retreating into deep caves whenever Prince Daemon launches attacks with his dragon, Caraxes.

Meanwhile, Alicent Hightower, having married King Viserys and giving birth to son, Aegon, is pregnant again; Queen Alicent and Princess Rhaenyra, once close friends, have become estranged. Viserys, disinterested in the Stepstones war, leads the court on a hunt to celebrate Aegon's second nameday; he intends to kill a white hart stag, considered a royal good omen. Believing Viserys intends to replace her with Aegon as heir to the throne, Rhaenyra storms away from camp, with only her Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole, following.

Viserys dismisses Lord Jason Lannister's marriage suit for Rhaenyra, while Hand of the King Ser Otto Hightower proposes betrothing to Prince Aegon, Rhaenyra's two-year-old half-brother and Otto's grandson. Master of Laws Lord Lyonel Strong advises Viserys to wed Rhaenyra to Corlys Velaryon's son, Ser Laenor, to heal the rift between Houses Targaryen and Velaryon.

While camped overnight in the woods, a wild boar invades the campsite, trampling Criston and attacking Rhaenyra before the two kill it. Before returning to the main camp, Rhaenyra encounters the white hart and allows it to go unharmed; meanwhile, Viserys takes two attempts to slay a regular stag.

Following the hunt, Otto tells Alicent that the realm's nobles will favor Aegon as king, despite Viserys preferring Rhaenyra. Meanwhile, Viserys assures Rhaenyra she will never be replaced as his heir, but urges her to find an influential husband to bolster her claim to the Iron Throne.

Alicent advises Viserys to send reinforcements to the Stepstones. When a messenger brings word of Viserys's decision, Daemon refuses to accept his brother's aid. He feigns surrender to lure the Crabfeeder's army into the open, at which point the Velaryon infantry, led by Corlys, and his younger brother, Vaemond, launch a counterattack. Simultaneously, Ser Laenor cuts off the enemy's escape route with his dragon, Seasmoke. Daemon pursues Drahar into the caverns, killing him as the Velaryon forces claim victory."

Rhaenyra abandons the tour while a fight erupts between two suitors, in which one, an adolescent boy, kills another by sword. As her ship approaches King's Landing, her uncle, Prince Daemon, flies past on his dragon, Caraxes, victoriously returning from his three-year military campaign in the Stepstones.

Daemon enters the throne room, wearing a crown and claiming the title ""King of the Narrow Sea"". He gives up the crown to his brother, King Viserys, swearing his allegiance. As the reconciled brothers celebrate at a feast, Queen Alicent confides her loneliness to Rhaenyra, who also admits missing their friendship. Daemon speaks to Rhaenyra, advising her to indulge her desires while fulfilling royal duties.

Late at night, Rhaenyra, disguised as a boy, sneaks out with Daemon to explore King's Landing's seamier areas. They drink, attend a bawdy play, and visit a brothel, where Daemon removes Rhaenyra's disguise and seduces her. Although she is willing, he is unable to consummate the affair. A frustrated Daemon leaves. Returning to the Red Keep, Rhaenyra seduces Criston, who is initially reluctant due to his Kingsguard oath of chastity, but they ultimately sex.

Ser Otto Hightower learns about Daemon and Rhaenyra's exploits from a spy called the White Worm. Otto informs Viserys, who reacts angrily to the news, as well as Otto's apparent spying on Rhaenyra. Alicent overhears their conversation. She confronts Rhaenyra privately, inadvertently revealing Otto's spying to Rhaenyra. Rhaenyra denies having sex with Daemon. Viserys angrily confronts a disheveled and hungover Daemon, who seemingly confirms the accusations and proposes to wed Rhaenyra. Viserys claims Daemon only wants the marriage to gain the crown, and exiles his brother back to the Vale. Alicent tells Viserys her belief that Rhaenyra is still a virgin.

To avoid scandal, Viserys orders Rhaenyra to marry Ser Laenor Velaryon. In exchange, she demands her father dismiss Otto as his Hand, claiming he manipulates the king for personal ambitions. Viserys does so. He later sends Grand Maester Mellos to give her an abortifacient drink to prevent any ""unwanted consequences."""

King Viserys and Princess Rhaenyra sail to Driftmark to arrange the princess's marriage to Ser Laenor Velaryon, the son of Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys, thus uniting the Targaryens and Velaryon Houses. Knowing Laenor is gay, Rhaenyra says that, once married, they can perform their royal duties and be free to have lovers. Later, Ser Criston Cole proposes that he and Rhaenyra run away to Essos and assume new identities. Rhaenyra refuses to give up the throne and says they can continue their current relationship. Criston feels used and despairs over breaking his Kingsguard vows.

Before leaving King's Landing, Ser Otto Hightower warns Alicent that if Rhaenyra becomes queen, Alicent's children will be considered a dangerous political threat to the throne. Ser Larys Strong slyly asks Alicent about Rhaenyra's health, mentioning she was given a medicinal drink. Alicent questions Criston about allegations that Rhaenyra and Daemon had sex; Criston, misunderstanding, confesses that he slept with the princess. Criston expects execution, but Alicent merely dismisses him and keeps the secret; Rhaenyra's dishonesty distresses Alicent.

At a feast celebrating Rhaenyra and Laenor's forthcoming nuptials, Alicent interrupts Viserys' speech, entering the hall wearing a green gown matching House Hightower's signal color for a call to arms. Her uncle, Lord Hobert, promises her full political support. Daemon unexpectedly attends the feast. Ser Gerold Royce confronts him, claiming he murdered Rhea. Daemon denies it and demands he inherit Rhea's lands. Daemon flirts with Lady Laena, Lord Corlys's daughter. Daemon privately questions Rhaenyra about her marriage; she teasingly suggests they wed.

Laenor's lover, Ser Joffrey Lonmouth, realizes that Criston is Rhaenyra's paramour. Joffrey tells Criston that they should protect the wedding couple's secrets. Criston perceives this as blackmail and brutally beats Joffrey to death, bringing the feast to a disastrous end and devastating Laenor.

Queen Alicent immediately summons the infant. A weakened Rhaenyra brings the newborn herself, assisted by Laenor, who names him Joffrey. Alicent notes the child, like brothers Jacaerys and Lucerys, bears no resemblance to Laenor. Alicent privately insists that Rhaenyra's children are bastards, an allegation King Viserys repeatedly ignores.

Alicent's son Aegon, aided by Jacaerys and Lucerys, pranks his younger brother, Aemond, who as yet has no dragon. Alicent scolds Aegon for misbehaving and stresses family unity, saying he will one day fight Rhaenyra for the throne.

Ser Criston, now Alicent's protector and ally, trains the young princes in swordsmanship. Ser Criston taunts City Watch commander Ser Harwin Strong over his protecting Jacaerys like he was his own child, provoking Harwin to attack Criston. Lord Lyonel Strong later chastises his son Harwin's behavior, stressing it substantiates rumours about Rhaenyra's infidelity with Harwin and damages the children's legitimacy. Amid the political turmoil, Rhaenyra denies Laenor's request to fight the Triarchy. To ease family tensions, Rhaenyra proposes that Prince Jacaerys marry Helaena, Alicent's daughter. Viserys approves, while Alicent disapproves, stating that Jacaerys is a bastard.

The rumours cause Lord Strong to offer his resignation as Hand of the King, which Viserys rejects. Viserys allows Lord Strong to escort the disgraced Harwin back to Harrenhal. After Harwin bids an emotional farewell to Rhaenyra and her children, Jacaerys asks if Harwin is his biological father; Rhaenyra replies that Jacaerys is a Targaryen. Reading the political winds, Rhaenyra moves her household to Dragonstone, also bringing Laenor's lover, Ser Qarl Correy.

Alicent mentions to Harwin's brother, Larys Strong, that she wishes her father, Ser Otto, was still the king's Hand. To that purpose, Larys recruits three condemned criminals, has their tongues removed, and tasks them to set a fire at Harrenhal, killing Lord Strong and Ser Harwin.

Meanwhile, Prince Daemon and his wife, Laena Velaryon, visit Pentos with their daughters Baela and Rhaena. Prince Reggio Haratis offers them lands in exchange for an alliance against the resurgent Triarchy.

During the night, Rhaenyra and Daemon meet on the beach and make love. Prince Aemond sneaks out and claims Laena's dragon Vhagar as his own, nearly falling off while riding it. Aemond's cousins and nephews angrily confront him, with Laena's daughter Rhaena demanding that Vhagar rightfully should be hers. An altercation results in Lucerys slashing Aemond's left eye with a knife. All the royal children are brought before King Viserys. Queen Alicent wants Lucerys' eye gouged out as retribution. When Viserys refuses, a distraught Alicent grabs Viserys' Valyrian steel dagger and lunges at Lucerys. Rhaenyra blocks her, but Alicent wounds the princess' arm. Viserys considers the matter settled when Aemond says gaining the dragon was a fair exchange for losing an eye. Amid claims that Rhaenyra's children are bastards, Viserys decrees that anyone doubting his grandsons' legitimacy will lose their tongue.

A pregnant Princess Rhaenyra and Prince Daemon return to the capital to defend Lucerys' claim. Upon arrival, Rhaenyra notices the Red Keep is now austere and grim, reflecting the new religion that Queen Alicent embraces. King Viserys, bedridden, disfigured, and mentally muddled is gladdened to meet Rhaenyra and Daemon's sons Aegon the Younger and Viserys the Younger. All royal matters are now overseen by Alicent and the King's Hand, Ser Otto Hightower, who keep Viserys quiescent with milk of the poppy.

Meanwhile, Talya, Alicent's lady-in-waiting, frequently visits Daemon's former mistress, Mysaria, believed to be the White Worm, providing information regarding the royals.

Prince Aegon, now married to his sister, Helaena, rapes a handmaiden, which Alicent later covers up. In an attempt to gain Princess Rhaenys' support, Rhaenyra proposes that her son, Prince Jacaerys, marry Rhaenys' granddaughter, Lady Baela, who would eventually rule as king and queen-consort, as well as a marriage between Lucerys and Baela's twin sister, Lady Rhaena, she becoming the Lady of Driftmark and continuing the true Velaryon name and bloodline. Rhaenys warns her that she will have to stand alone while expecting the Hightowers to rule in favour of Vaemond. She also pleads for Viserys to defend her succession to the throne, quoting Aegon the Conqueror's prophetic dream about the Prince That Was Promised.

Vaemond presents his petition to the court, where Otto seems prepared to rule against Lucerys. As Rhaenyra begins speaking, Viserys, frail and barely ambulatory, enters, shocking the court. Viserys struggles towards the Iron Throne, but is assisted by Daemon, who returns Viserys' crown to his head, it having fallen off on the stairs. Viserys asks for Rhaenys' opinion on the matter, and she replies that Corlys wishes for Luke to succeed him as Lord of The Tides. Viserys then affirms that Lucerys is the legitimate heir to Driftmark. Enraged, Vaemond calls Rhaenyra a whore, and his supposed nephews and Rhaenyra's three elder sons bastards; Viserys declares that he will have Vaemond's tongue, keeping to his declaration in Driftmark that anyone who dares question the parentage of Rhaenyra's sons would lose their tongue. Daemon then decapitates Vaemond, declaring that he can keep his tongue.

The royal families gather for a feast at which Viserys implores everyone to make amends. In response, Rhaenyra toasts Queen Alicent for lovingly caring for Viserys. Alicent, in turn, toasts Rhaenyra, and - still angry with Aegon - says she will make a fine queen. After the exhausted king retires to bed, Aemond abruptly ends the festivities by mockingly praising Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey as being three ""Strong boys"", alluding to their deceased, biological father, Ser Harwin Strong. This results in a fight among the princes until Daemon intervenes. Amid mounting royal tensions, Rhaenyra prepares for her family's return to Dragonstone. Viserys, on his deathbed, mistakes Alicent for Rhaenyra and mutters parts of Aegon the Conqueror's dream; Alicent misinterprets it as Viserys wanting their son, Aegon, to succeed him as king.

In Flea Bottom, the Cargyll twins check a fighting arena Aegon frequents, where children, including Aegon's own bastard offspring, are forced into mortal combat as entertainment. An intermediary approaches the Cargylls, saying that Mysaria has Aegon and offers for Otto to meet with her. Mysaria, revealing she knows Viserys is dead, barters with Otto to end the child fighting pits in exchange for Aegon's location.

He comes home to his family's restaurant in Chicago, called The Original Beef or The Beef, which is willed to him after his brother's abrupt death - Michael, who is commonly referred to as Mikey. The restaurant is struggling heavily on finances, is lacking infrastructure, and has a team of uninspired cooks. Carmy must reorganize every system to avoid its imminent closure. An alarm wakes him up from a nightmare involving him releasing a caged bear that ends up attacking him. He is greeted by a delivery driver who delivers a small portion of his meat order due to lack of payment.

While speaking to an older Hispanic Chef named Tina, Carmy has an idea to host an arcade tournament to boost sales in the restaurant, but is required to find alternative ways to source his ingredients. He calls in favors from his friends in the restaurant industry but finds himself trading most of his vintage denim jacket collection in exchange for meat. He promises to trade a jacket that was gifted to him by Mikey, which pains him as it is one of the last reminders of his brother.

As Carmy is given different cuts of meat than usual, he changes the cooking method which takes longer. Tina ridicules Carmy for his fine-dining workflow and is confused when he refers to her as ""Chef"". Carmy is so overwhelmed with work that he forgets that he organized an interview with a highly skilled, young chef named Sydney, who applied for the Sous Chef position. Sydney has a culinary school education and has worked at many renowned restaurants in Chicago which baffles Carmy that she would want to work in his run-down sandwich restaurant. Sydney refers to Carmy as the most excellent Chef de Cuisine in the most excellent restaurant in the entire United States and wants to learn from him. In the meantime, she is a stagiaire who is an unpaid intern so they can learn how the restaurant operates and to be evaluated. Her first duty is to cook the pre-service family meal for the staff.

Ebraheim is an older chef from Africa who is a part of the team. He becomes frustrated with Carmy's new systems and is reluctant to embrace change. It is clear that Carmy is unfamiliar in this environment and lacks the respect of his colleagues. Even Sydney has a hard time establishing herself as the other chefs bully her.

Carmy checks on Marcus, who is in charge of making the bread but is struggling to meet quotas due to equipment being broken.

Gary Woods is a front of house staff member who also handles miscellaneous tasks throughout the kitchen. He is also known as Sweeps, as he swept the St Louis baseball team three times and had a no hitter.

Richard Jeremovich, also known as Richie, colloquially refers to himself as Carmy's cousin. He also pretends to have an Italian heritage, much to Carmy's chagrin. He was also Mikey's best friend and worked alongside him as an unofficial assistant manager at The Beef.

Richie arrives to work late due to having shared custody of his child and berates Carmy for changing the systems. Things become personal when Richie blames his own divorce on supporting Carmy's family before and after Mikey's death, as Carmy was absent. Carmy responds by asking Richie why Mikey didn't leave him the restaurant instead.

As Carmy has been frustrating his staff, they retaliate by sabotaging his equipment which forces him to use the dull house knives. Carmy continually educates his chefs on new restaurant lingo, techniques and efficient workflow. He is also chastised for removing spaghetti from the menu, which was very popular among guests. After a heated argument, Richie takes control and orders the kitchen to ignore Carmy's instructions.

Neil Fak, commonly referred to as Fak, is one of Carmy's closest friends and does freelance maintenance work at the restaurant. He points out that Carmy has been bleeding from accidentally cutting himself during preparation. As Carmy rushes back to the kitchen for first aid, he bumps into Ebraheim carrying a tray and is unable to control his temper.

As he calms down, he stares at a framed picture that he drew which is a concept for a fine-dining restaurant. When attempting to commence a pre-service team meeting, he is unable to get their attention and is overshadowed by Richie telling a story.

Carmy takes a break to collect Mikey's jacket from his sister, Natalie, also known as Sugar. She is uncomfortable being around the restaurant due to bad memories and is hurt that Carmy has abandoned their family in recent years. She urges Carmy to sell the restaurant, but Carmy is adamant in fixing it. When going through Carmy's books, Marcus stumbles across his awards. When he also receives feedback from Carmy that improves his own workflow, he gains a newfound respect.

Carmy gathers the team to try his new method of braising beef where everybody loves the flavors, but Richie refuses to acknowledge him.

Sydney is also eager to impress with her beef stew served with rice, plantains and fennel salad as the family meal. The team has a nice bonding moment where they show gratitude and have banter. Meanwhile, Carmy attempts to calm down the crowd queuing up for the arcade tournament, but is assaulted in a brawl. Richie breaks up the scuffle by firing a gun into the air and takes control of the situation with his authoritative demeanor. As Carmy realizes that he is unprepared to run this restaurant by himself, Richie orders him to stick to the status quo and cook the spaghetti. When Richie is alone, he finally tries Carmy's beef sandwich and quietly remarks on its brilliance.

As Carmy begins to open a can of tomatoes to prepare the spaghetti, he changes his mind and throws it in the trash."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16953538/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,A surprise health inspection reveals the cracks in the restaurant's foundation. Carmy goes head-to-head with Richie.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Christopher Storer'],"['', '', '']",[],"['montage', 'debt', 'flashback', 'abusive boss', 'new york city', 'health inspection', 'health code violation', 'smoke break', 'cigarette smoking', 'cleaning a kitchen', 'health inspector', 'uncle nephew relationship', 'telephone call']",[],"A year ago, Carmy was the Chef de Cuisine at a prestigious fine dining restaurant in New York. He was in charge of a large team who heeded his every command in a silent and orchestrated kitchen. He is seen cleanly shaven, hair slicked back, dressed in impeccable chef whites and is highly focused while plating refined gourmet dishes. A line chef brings Carmy a broken sauce and he politely asks for a new one. When she presents with a second broken sauce, the Executive Chef intimidates her before sending her home. The Executive Chef then torments Carmy for his poor judgment, work ethic, and attacks his personal insecurities. He relentlessly insults Carmy, diminishes his self-worth and triggers his anxiety. Carmy endures the abuse without retaliation and suffers in silence.

At the present day at The Beef in Chicago, Carmy's kitchen is in squalor, his cooks ignore his requests and the environment is very noisy. His current surroundings are a stark contrast to the high level of operation he was accustomed to in fine dining establishments. After service, the staff commence a deep clean of every surface using toothbrushes. Carmy attempts tell stories of his time working in Michelin-starred restaurants, but is dismissed by his staff as being pretentious. Carmy retaliates by saying that he wanted to work at The Beef, but Mikey did not allow him to. After news of the ice cream machine being broken, the staff begin to realize the sources of waste and lost revenue.

As everyone heads home, Carmy stays behind to finish the cleaning. He then goes home late in the evening to an unhealthy dinner of peanut butter and jelly sandwich and junk food. He falls asleep watching a cooking channel and wakes up from a nightmare to find he has been cooking while sleepwalking and has started a fire. Carmy finally acknowledges that he has deep-rooted underlying issues that need to be addressed and that he cannot sustain his current lifestyle without assistance.

After a week, Sydney tells Carmy that she would like more responsibility at The Beef and prepares a business analysis document that outlines improvements and cost-saving measures. She also advocates for a food delivery system which Carmy immediately dismisses. Before they can discuss it, he is interrupted by a surprise health inspection. The usual care-free health inspector has passed away and the replacement inspector is more strict. Richie is hostile towards her while Carmy allows her full access to the restaurant.

Sydney resumes her incessant business proposals which frustrates Carmy. Once again, they are interrupted by the health inspector who discovers violations of structural damage, cross contamination and lack of hot water access for hygiene reasons. The worst offense is that a pack of cigarettes was left on a stove-top. The Beef is then awarded a C grade from the health department. Despite their pleas, the health inspector cannot re-evaluate the restaurant for at least 30 days. Carmy is infuriated and immediately blames Richie where they have to be separated from an altercation. As Richie has an expired driver's license, Sydney is then pressured to drive him to the hardware store to find materials to fix the restaurant. Richie goes on a rant and reveals to Sydney that he is not related to Carmy and is only a close family-friend. He also reveals that Mikey committed suicide by shooting himself in the head four months prior.

Back at The Beef, Carmy has a meeting with his Uncle Jimmy, also known as Cicero. He is the key investor who provides financing to the restaurant. Jimmy encourages Carmy to give up on the impossible task of fixing the restaurant and to sell it. He then reveals that Mikey borrowed $300K from Jimmy based on false promises and that it mysteriously disappeared and was never paid back. Carmy is reluctant to sell the restaurant, then assumes Mikey's debt and assures that he will pay it back.

Sydney and Richie continue to argue where she tries to convince him that the restaurant has potential for culinary success and expresses her admiration for Carmy. They are interrupted when Richie's ex-wife calls him in regards to their five-year-old daughter being upset when starting at a new school. He then tries to comfort her through the phone. Upon hearing this, Sydney pities Richie and is able to fix his mistakes at the restaurant without being asked.

When Sugar doesn't pick up her phone, Carmy calls Pete, who is Sugar's husband. Pete seems flustered and tries to avoid conversation, but Carmy apologizes to him for a previous altercation. Pete brushes it off and hands the phone over to Sugar. Pete only refers to his wife as ""Nat"" and never ""Sugar"" which implies that he has a different relationship with her than her immediate family. Carmy tries to process his erratic behavior and his sister suggests that he should attend an Al Anon meeting which is a support group for family members of those with substance abuse issues. Carmy makes snide remarks about Pete, but Pete is never offended due to his good nature and people-pleasing tendencies. Sugar shows genuine concern about Carmy's shortness of breath, nausea and sleepwalking. He reveals that it began during his time in New York, presumably due to the torment from his overbearing Executive Chef. Despite being abused, Carmy admits that he loved his high-stress jobs at fine-dining restaurants. Sugar urges Carmy to take care of himself and seek help.

When Richie is fixing the tile damage in the locker room, he discovers a letter that Mikey wrote for Carmy, which had dropped into a hidden spot. He contemplates whether to give it to Carmy, but decides to return it to the place nobody would see, thereby denying Carmy of closure.

When the dinner service starts, Sydney takes on the responsibility of expediting the orders and providing feedback to the staff. Ebraheim begins to adapt to the new system but takes time to fix his errors. Carmy thanks Sydney for her help and officially hires her as the Sous Chef. Richie and Carmy appear to be amicable again and find out that Jimmy was able to use his unethical connections to have an immediate reassessment from the health department.

When Carmy has a cigarette break, he realizes that he was the one who left the packet of cigarettes on the stove-top and had forgotten about it. This is the impetus for him to finally seek help and attend the Al Anon meeting."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18233692/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Carmy attends Al-Anon. Sydney struggles to gain the respect of the staff.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Joanna Calo'],"['', '', '']",[],"['al anon meeting', 'montage', 'finger cut', 'cut finger', 'telephone call', 'reference to al anon', 'panic attack', 'sabotage', 'food preparation', 'voicemail message']",[],"Carmy walks around Chicago alone, mustering the courage to attend the Al-Anon meeting for family members of drug and alcohol addicts. At the meeting, a woman gives a speech acknowledging that she was not a victim and that she could not change her alcoholic husband's chaotic behaviour. She blames herself for contributing to her husband's alcohol abuse. However, it made her realise that she had to remove herself from any situation that could become toxic. Carmy listens intently as he ponders his own situation at his restaurant.

During a very busy lunch service at The Beef, Richie is infuriated and yells at the staff for missing the orders. Sydney retorts that they are behind on schedule due to Richie not helping in the kitchen and not inputting the orders through the Point of Service system. The long queue of diners awkwardly wait in line as the staff bicker and Carmy is unable to de-escalate the situation. Marcus also contributes to the noise as he complains that somebody has taken his tray of bread, but Sydney reassures him that she had already prepared them for him. Carmy also realises that his team is disorganised and do not have sufficient ingredients prepared for service.

After a long day of work, Carmy takes the elevated train home and wakes up from his short sleep, still exhausted. He reads an Al-Anon pamphlet that emphasies that he needs to forgive, be honest, be humble, avoid tension, find hobbies, and to keep doing his best despite failing. Importantly, it advises Carmy to frequently attend support meetings.

As Carmy cannot sleep, he returns to the restaurant to find the walls plastered with pictures of desserts that were on the menu in his previous restaurants. Marcus explains that he put the pictures on the wall as inspiration. Sydney then joins them. Carmy explains the process behind making a plum dessert that took the labour of 12 people. It involved a reduction of plum wine; a plum consommé made of black plums cooked in black vinegar, salt, and sugar; compressed plums of thinly sliced squares of plum that are vacuum sealed with the plum wine reduction; and a gelee that had a thick and squishy consistency which was difficult to achieve. Before Carmy can explain how the gelee was made, Sydney answers first that it was made with veal fat which impresses Carmy.

As Ebraheim walks by, Carmy asks why his brother Michael ordered the smaller 28-ounce cans of tomatoes instead of the larger and cheaper 102-ounce cans. Ebraheim admits that the more he learns about Michael, the less he understands about his decisions.

In the office, Carmy requests that Sydney implements a French Brigade system for The Beef, which would involve a hierarchy of staff. Sydney respectfully declines as she thinks the system will fail and is already struggling to gain the respect of her colleagues. Carmy ignores her feedback and insists, as he desperately wants to change his toxic environment. He states that he will run the administrative business while Sydney runs the kitchen. Sydney reluctantly agrees.

Carmy calls a team meeting and hands out matching aprons to the staff, where some are resistant to conform. He acknowledges his staff's current workflow and wants to organise it rather than change it. Meanwhile, Richie interrupts the meeting and undermines Carmy's authority by making fun of him. Sydney unconfidently explains the systems and delegates the roles. Tina continues to pretend that she does not speak English whenever she wants to avoid responsibility. Despite it, she is assigned the Gard Manger role who takes care of cold dishes and garnishes. Ebraheim is assigned Chef de Partie and his role is to prepare meats; he accepts the role graciously.

Carmy answers the phone which had been ringing constantly, only to find out that it is somebody named Nico was wanting to speak to his deceased brother. He then tells Richie who offers to take care of the situation. Carmy has a panic attack as he felt like his brother was still alive but faces the grim reality that he is dead.

In the meeting, Marcus is assigned to be Pâtissier and suggests that they outsource the bread so that he can begin making desserts. He admits that he does not yet have the skills but is eager to learn. Sydney assigns herself to the Sous Chef and Saucier positions where she makes stocks, sauces and gravies. She assigns Richie to an ambiguous role as nobody knows what he truly does. She also implements daily pre-service meetings, front-of-house walkthrough and an end-of-day review for feedback to promote a more efficient workload. Carmy barges through the kitchen and abandons the team to attend an Al-Anon meeting.

As the chefs adapt to their new roles, Sydney shows signs of stress by briefly hiding in the walk-in fridge. During her walkthrough, she reprimands Tina for not following the system and for insubordination. Ebraheim's duty is to cook the family pre-service meal that does not use too many pots. Ebraheim makes Chicken Suqaar, a dish from Somalia. As she scorns Marcus for being distracted in the kitchen, she accidentally cuts herself on an improperly stored boxcutter. Tina feels resentment toward Sydney and secretly sabotages the veal stock by turning the heat from low to high.

As Carmy returns to the restaurant a few hours later, he sees Richie making a surreptitious deal in the alleyway but ignores it. In Sydney's absence, Carmy does his own walkthrough and discovers the pot of boiling stock. He then chastises Sydney for her lack of technique despite her explaining that she left the heat on low. Richie exacerbates the situation by giving negative feedback. Sydney proposes to use the ruined veal stock to make a jus, but Carmy orders her to further reduce it into a demi-glace. He also yells at her for not preparing the onions and ignores that it was originally Tina's duty. With a domineering attitude, he expects her to submit without resistance, which frustrates her. As Sydney hastily prepares a large amount of onions, her previous cut reopens through her glove.

Sydney does another walkthrough where she takes out her anger by providing unconstructive criticism, and unclear instructions to clean the stations and lowboy fridges. She also rebukes Gary for the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant. Sydney then provides passive-aggressive comments on the quality of Marcus' bread. She returns to her station and panics when she discovers that her prepared onions have gone missing. She asks Richie, the staff and Carmy, but nobody knows where they have gone. Carmy states that the other chefs take her preparations as a part of her paying her dues.

Marcus returns with the cambros of Sydney's prepared onions and states that he hid them as a prank. This infuriates Sydney and she swears at the staff. In her anger, she rejects help to reach a heavy container of veal stock stored on the top shelf of the walk-in fridge. As she does not have a ladder or proper manual handling techniques, the container drops onto the floor, wasting a significant amount of stock. Marcus sees it, immediately helps her clean it up and provides reassurance.

Back in the office, Carmy reviews the finances of the restaurant and is confused at Michael's bookkeeping systems.

Sydney attends to the open wound on her finger and Marcus quietly offers a truce. As Sydney sits outside by herself, Carmy brings her a plate of the family meal and urges her to explain her behaviour. Sydney provides feedback by saying that Carmy allows the staff to have a poor work ethic while only yelling at her. Carmy admits that he holds Sydney to a higher standard and to remind her that being a Sous Chef is about following orders. Sydney also says that Carmy's inability to listen to feedback himself was a point of friction. Her rationale for wanting to work with Carmy is to be able to utlise her skills to make the restaurant stand out. She refuses to work at other establishments with a lack of creative freedom, or to resort to working at a brunch restaurant. Carmen acknowledges his fault for leaving the restaurant and reveals to Sydney that he attended an Al-Anon meeting due to his brother being a drug addict. He tries not to use it as an excuse.

Carmen has been ignoring help from his sister and finally listens to the voicemail which states that it was supposed to be Michael's birthday. Carmy continues to spend time alone as he walks through the coast of Chicago and stares across the empty ocean."

Tina and Sydney work together while Marcus makes donuts.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Christopher Storer'],"['', '', '']",[],"[""children's party"", 'catering', 'birthday party', 'reference to ghostbusters', 'xanax']",[],"Marcus peers through the window of Roeser's Bakery and is mesmerised by the process of how donuts are made. From the batter being mixed, the icings being made, donuts being deep fried and dusted in sugar and glazed, then garnished before being displayed at the front. He is gaining inspiration after accepting more responsibility to become the Pastry Chef at the Beef restaurant.

At the restaurant, Carmy and Richie load up the car for a catering job at a children's party in order to pay off the debt that Michael had accrued to Uncle Jimmy. Richie attempts to put a small shirt on an oversized inflatable hotdog. Carmy does not see the humour in Richie's actions and states that he does not want his legs broken by Uncle Jimmy. Richie is reluctant to help out as he states that he would be set back on his administrative duties at the restaurant. Carmy laughs at Richie incredulously and they have a tussle which ends up popping the inflatable hotdog.

Marcus revels in his new duties of being able to bake a chocolate cake instead of having to bake bread. He asks Sydney to try his cake and she is impressed which means a lot to him. Sydney checks in on Tina to ensure that she understands the new procedures and recipes, but Tina remains stubborn and disregards her advice, especially to ensure that the heat is not too high. Sydney tries to relate to Tina by explaining that her duty is to follow somebody else's orders and understands the struggles of being a woman working in hospitality. This does not make an impression on Tina, who argues that she has more experience in the kitchen than Sydney has been alive.

As Carmy and Richie drive to the birthday party, Richie tells Carmy that Uncle Jimmy has moved houses since Carmy was last in Chicago and that they have been going the wrong way. Richie brings up the deep-seated animosity between him and Uncle Jimmy and states that he hates being called Rick. He tells Carmy that he will keep the peace. However, when they arrive, Richie and Uncle Jimmy immediately get into a heated argument about a previous work incident where Richie is blamed for not picking up the phone and losing a contract. Uncle Jimmy also lauds over Richie that he always has to do him favours, then ends the argument by calling Richie ""Rick"".

While Carmy is slicing oranges, an elderly family friend mistakes him for Michael, who had committed suicide. Richie continues to rant about Uncle Jimmy, stating that he feigns his Italian heritage and is actually Polish. Carmy rebuffs Richie by stating Richie is also feigning an Italian heritage. Before continuing with work, Richie chews on prescription anxiety medication and leaves the bottle on the table. Carmy is frustrated when he discovers Richie did not pack ketchup due to philosophical differences on what condiments should go on a hot dog.

At the restaurant, Marcus and Ebraheim discuss the perfect donut. Marcus' idea is a jelly-filled, bright purple, sweet and tangy combination. Marcus' roommate, Chester who is a designer, delivers a book of pantone colour references. Marcus has a goal to make his own perfect donut, as he is inspired by Carmy's plum dessert, and wants to serve it at the restaurant. Sydney supports his aspirations despite The Beef not having the necessary equipment.

Sydney checks in on the dish washers and asks their preferences for the pre-service family meal. Fak asks Sydney if he can have some food but is denied. Ebraheim compliments Sydney for inspiring confidence in Marcus but Tina remains unimpressed. Marcus continues to draw prototypes of his vision of the donuts. He also purchases two dozen different flavoured donuts to research their texture with Fak.

As Carmy walks through the house to find more equipment, he is warmly greeted by other family members. Jimmy's adolescent son is mad that the other children at the party are behaving wildly and opening his presents. Carmy is ridiculed by his family friends who are condescending toward his occupation in the hospitality industry. Pete, Natalie's husband, is also attending the party and immediately defends Carmy. He states that Carmy was the Head Chef at the literal best restaurant in the world. Carmy remains ambivalent.

As Richie continues to grill the hot dogs, Jimmy joins him to escape the mayhem that the children are causing. Richie and Jimmy are still upset at each other, but bond over a mutual hatred of Pete. Jimmy feels like Pete will report them to the police. When Richie has an awkward encounter with another party guest, Jimmy makes fun of him for his poor work ethic, especially for not answering his phone. Richie is adamant that he never received phone calls, so Jimmy reads a message from a client who states a phone number. Richie tells Jimmy that it was Michael's number and not his. Afterwards, they both bond over their mutual anguish over Michael's death.

In the restaurant kitchen, Tina is behind on her work and has ignored Sydney's instructions. But Sydney continues to provide feedback to use a salt bed when roasting the potatoes and to use a knife to peel the hot skins instead of a dirty rag. Marcus begins to make a frosting for his cake.

As Carmy is making hotdogs, Jimmy and Richie are laughing together. When Pete interrupts, the mood is ruined and Jimmy leaves immediately. Nobody laughs at Pete's jokes and are uncomfortable in his presence. He helps himself to Carmy's Ghostbuster-inspired Ecto Cooler drink. Pete makes a remark that all the children have suddenly fallen asleep in the backyard. As he continues to drink the Ecto Cooler, he yawns and becomes drowsy himself. He tries to compliment Carmy by stating that he followed all of Carmy's achievements while he was cooking in restaurants overseas. Pete also tells Carmy that Natalie was also proud of him and misses him a lot but that she resents Carmy for ignoring her. Before Pete leaves, he laughs at the inflatable hotdog with a shirt duct-taped onto it. When Carmy refills the container of Ecto Cooler drink, he realises that the bottle of Richie's anxiety medication was accidentally placed inside. Carmy is hesitant, but informs Jimmy of the situation. Jimmy is amused and instead of being angry, he compliments Carmy for bringing peace and quiet.

Back at the restaurant, Tina allows the pot of milk to boil over on the stove and has to dispose of it. She is immensely frustrated at herself. When she comes back, she sees that a new pot of milk and herbs are placed onto the stove. She is angry that Sydney has been watching her, but Sydney states that she does not have time to waste. As Tina finishes the mashed potatoes, she tastes it and is impressed at the new recipe.

As Carmy is cleaning up after the party, he sees a picture of his father and Uncle Jimmy from 1992. Carmy admits that he did not know his father enough to miss him. Jimmy states that he saw Carmy's father as more of a friend than family as they were of similar age and had similar problems. He says that it had been 20 years since the last time he had spoken to Carmy's dad because they had grown apart after Carmy's dad lacked a direction in life and career. After the seeing the success of the Ed Debevic's diner, Carmy's dad copied the trend and opened The Original Beef restaurant. Jimmy admits that he hates going into the restaurant due to bad memories and cannot understand why Carmy wants to fix it. He lacks faith in the restaurant's success. Jimmy tells an allegory of a near-miss accident during a road trip when Carmy's dad was launched through the windshield due to refusing to wear a seatbelt. He then tells Carmy that after catering the party, that he has subtracted $2000 from the original debt of $300 000.

At the restaurant, Tina doubts herself as she is asked to present the mashed potatoes. To Tina's surprise, Sydney compliments her food. This instils a confidence in her and she finally thanks Sydney. Marcus is in his own world as he garnishes his completed chocolate cake in orange zest. When it is time to leave the birthday party, Jimmy finally shakes Richie's hand and calls him ""Richard"" out of respect. Richie reciprocates. They find Pete sleeping in the living room and have to drive him home. In his intoxicated stupor, he thanks Carmy and Richie for being allowed to be a part of the family and creating memories. Richie refuses to acknowledge Pete, but Carmy apologises to Pete, presumably for the way he had treated him poorly in the past. Carmy and Richie arrive in the restaurant at night for the pre-service dessert during family meal which is Marcus' chocolate cake. Carmy personally compliments Marcus which makes him smile. Tina is exhausted while she eats her food alone and ponders the things she learned throughout the day."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18233702/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,Things go wrong in the kitchen. Sydney finds solutions.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Joanna Calo'],"['', '', '']",[],"['montage', 'smoke break', 'cigarette smoking', 'food preparation', 'water damage', 'fight', 'blown fuse']",[],"Sydney lays awake at night and is distracted by the loud noise of the elevated train. The amber lights flashing through her window remind her of her failed solo-venture catering business of barbecued foods, called Sheridan Road Catering. She is haunted by memories of rejected bank loan applications, immense amounts of ingredients and herself as a young girl developing her passion for food.

As a part of her morning routine, Sydney takes anti-reflux medication. She accidentally bumps into the table in the cramped apartment which wakes up her dad. Sydney takes the train to the restaurant to find Carmy already there, developing a new dish. Carmy reviews Sydney's Cost of Goods Sold report and admits that she is right that they have poor averages on sales per table due to serving sandwiches during dinner service. The price is too low and barely covers labour costs. Carmy proposes a new dinner menu. Sydney wants to cook a braised short-rib with a risotto, as her variation on ""tongue and cheek"". Carmy is not convinced, but tells her that he will consider it.

Marcus interrupts as he tells them about The Noma Guide to Fermentation book. Carmy tells Marcus to get the cakes done quickly, as Marcus is distracted by his obsession with developing donuts. Marcus tells Carmy that all that is left to do is to bake the cakes. As Marcus carelessly tears off a piece of tape, Carmy instructs him to use scissors to create a clean edge. Carmy's philosophy is that all aspects of the kitchen must be maintained in order to have a neat presentation. Meanwhile, Carmy investigates a gurgling from the toilet. There is a sign above it reminding customers not to flush women's hygiene products. Before he is able to tell the team, the toilet explodes in his face and floods the restaurant. Sydney is adamant that they need to close the restaurant in order to clean up and make repairs. However, Carmy wants to stay open for lunch service. He also reminds Marcus to work on the cakes.

Carmy holds a demonstration on how to cook Chicken Piccata, but the new recipe with multiple steps frightens Ebraheim. Carmy reassures Ebraheim that the revenue from the new dinner menu will allow them to hire more chefs for more help. Carmy finds himself having to alter his vernacular, as he realises that most of his chefs have not had a culinary school background to understand. Carmy starts by sauteing onions and garlic until browned, then adds capers and white wine to be reduced before deglazing the pan with chicken stock. He finishes the sauce by whisking in butter and adding seasoning with lemon juice and parsley. The sauce is then spooned on top of a chicken schnitzel. Tina is allowed to taste the dish and she is amazed by the flavours. Fak arrives at the restaurant to fix the leaking toilet and is monitored by Richie. Richie is overly critical of Fak and sexually harasses him. Fak then asks Richie for a job as a chef.

Chester, Marcus' roommate, is back in the restaurant while Marcus sets up a temperature-controlled chamber for fermentation. Marcus admits to Carmy that he does not know what he is doing and is learning as he goes. Carmy reminds Marcus again to work on the cakes and not to get distracted by his projects. Gary educates the dishwasher, Angel, about a baseball player Minnie Minosa and meticulously lists his statistics.

Carmy gives feedback to Tina on how to properly get a maillard reaction on the roasted onions. He asks her the last time Michael made Chicken Piccata for her. Tina tells Carmy that it was during the family Christmas Dinner at his mother's house. He also asks if his mother is still deranged, but Tina gives a diplomatic answer. Carmy exhibits signs of anxiety as he has bad memories of his family.

As Fak and Richie continue the job interview in the bathroom, Fak states that he graduated high school and brings the right attitude to the team. Richie insults his intellect and questions his other skills, to which Fak responds by saying he is able to play the keyboard. The argument escalates with Richie chasing Fak through the restaurant and tackling him onto the ground. Gary asks whether to break up the fight, but Richie refuses until Fak admits defeat by saying ""Matae"", a quote from a Jean Claude Van Damme movie, called Bloodsport. Carmy breaks up the fight by throwing water onto them. In a moment of exasperation, Fak tells Carmy that Richie has been selling cocaine at the back of the restaurant. This angers Carmy.

In the kitchen, Marcus has not yet started the cake batter and rushes through the steps. He dumps the unmixed batter into the stand mixer at maximum speed and panics at his lack of time management. Meanwhile, Richie admits that he only sells small quantities of drugs and that the idea was from Michael to earn revenue from the restaurant during the COVID-19 closures. Richie chides Fak and states that he will never be hired at the restaurant after their fight. Carmy loses his temper and threatens Richie. Before things escalate, Marcus overloads the electrical system and causes a blackout in the restaurant.

As the refrigerators do not work, the team is sent to purchase ice to keep the meats cold while they transport it elsewhere. Fak assesses the systems and states that the condenser is damaged beyond repair and must be replaced. He promises a connection to a supplier at a reasonable cost.

Carmy circumvents his sister and asks his brother-in-law, Pete, for permission to store the restaurant food in their garage. When Natalie finds out, she is angered and hurt that Carmy continues to ignore her even after their brother's death. Richie continues to bully Pete by insulting his following of the Cubs baseball team and questions his knowledge, but is impressed when Pete is a true fan. Carmy admits to Natalie that he does not call her as she only talks about negative things and he does not want to get into a fight. She retorts by saying he only calls her when he is having a panic attack, that he never attended the Al-Anon meeting, spending all his time at the restaurant, and taking advantage of her husband. Natalie also hates that Richie is in her house. Carmy finally admits that he went to the Al-Anon meeting which de-escalates the fight.

At the restaurant, Sydney devises a plan to construct a wood-fire stove out of construction materials to prepare for lunch service. As Sydney lights the fires, she has haunting flashbacks of her failed barbecue business. When Carmy returns, he is impressed by Sydney's proactive thinking. The restaurant is able to stay open by serving the sandwiches outside and accepting cash only.

When Carmy has a cigarette break, he finds Marcus hiding in the alleyway. Marcus admits that he caused the blackout by being behind on his cakes. Without getting angry, Carmy calmly explains to Marcus that he must prioritise his restaurant duties. Marcus admits that his first job was working in a fast food restaurant and that he never had a chance to be creative. He promises to never make mistakes again. Carmy reassures him that setbacks are a normal part of the restaurant business. Carmy tells a story about how after he won the Food & Wine award for The Best New Chef, he accidentally started a fire that almost burned down his place of employment. Carmy admits that he had a moment of catharsis that if the restaurant burned down, his anxiety would be destroyed with it, but then he puts the fire out. He lightens the mood and makes Marcus laugh before asking him to join the team. The guests at the restaurant enjoy the food and compliment Sydney.

Fak admits to Carmy that the cost of fixing the electrical system was significantly more than anticipated and that he lied about having a supplier. He suggests that the only solution to generate the money is to ask Richie to sell drugs. Richie revels in the hypocrisy displayed by Carmy but states that he will only help if Fak admits defeat. Fak is reluctant but sadly concedes and finally says ""Matae"". Carmy makes Richie promise that this would be the final time he sells drugs and Richie delivers on his duties. The power is restored and the restaurant is put back in order.

Carmy compliments Sydney on her work, and she tells him about how her catering business failed. She states that her business gained popularity too quickly without having enough capital to open a restaurant. Running the business from her garage was unsustainable and she defaulted on her loans. She says that the allure of being able to be independent without an overbearing boss was a dangerous fantasy that led her to financial ruin and diminished mental health. Carmy listens without providing judgement or unsolicited suggestions.

Marcus returns to the kitchen and carefully measures his ingredients while neatly labelling them. At the end of the night, Sydney returns to the apartment and continues to have dreams about food. This time, she is able to use her experience as inspiration for developing her cola-braised beef dish."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18233706/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,Richie notices the neighborhood is changing. Sugar and Carmy clean up the office.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Joanna Calo'],"['', '', '']",[],"['tax debt', 'drive by shooting', 'gunshot', 'debt', 'flashback', 'smoke break', 'cigarette smoking', 'date', 'telling a story']",[],"Richie is telling a story that happened a few years ago about spending an afternoon with his best friend, Michael, and his family where they are cooking together and recounting the time they met celebrities in a bar.

Michael has a naturally boisterous, charismatic and colloquial demeanour. He captivates the room with his presence. In the kitchen, Richie watches as Natalie, Carmy and Michael prepare Beef Braciole and a tomato sauce. Carmy listens closely in admiration of his brother and is honoured that he is allowed to cook alongside him. Michael has excellent rapport with his siblings and friends where he is able to play along with jokes and take control of the kitchen. Michael alters his mother's Braciole recipe as he refuses to add raisins.

Michael continues with his story that he and Richie stumbled into a bar called Ceres at 6:45AM and the place remained packed full of guests, including famous Ice Hockey players like Denis Savard, Chris Chelios and Ed Belfour. Michael recalls the busy service was because Savard was inducted into the Hall of Fame the night before. Richie, while drunk, tried to record a new voicemail message while reading from a pamphlet about the Goddess of Agriculture. Meanwhile, a voice approaches them from behind questioning what they are doing. Michael and Richie were bewildered to discover that Bill Murray was speaking to them. Bill Murray then offered to record a new voicemail for Richie.

In the present day, it is Richie telling the rest of the story to his date at a fine dining restaurant. However, Richie is not able to capture the charm that Michael had telling this story. Richie playfully asks his date to call him so that she can hear the voicemail message from Bill Murray, but she does not humour him. She seems unimpressed that Richie was at a bar in the early morning which spoils the mood. The date turns out to be a failure as Richie walks home alone.

The next day at the restaurant, Richie complains to Tina about his failed date but is getting in the way of the chefs. He is in denial about being rejected by stating he didn't like his date due to her lack of appreciation for Chicago history. They are startled by the dishwasher, Manny, who yells to get their attention. At first, he seems unsure about his tone of voice, but Carmy reassures him that it is necessary. Manny requests that the chefs take the tape labels off their containers before sending them to be washed. This is due to the dishwashers' wrinkly and wet fingers being unable to peel off the tape themselves which affects the efficiency. The chefs all agree and he thanks them for their time.

Sydney incessantly pesters Carmy to allow her to make her new risotto and braised beef dish which would be perfect for their takeaway service as it uses ingredients that the restaurants would otherwise waste. Carmy is unconvinced that the dish is ready nor is the restaurant capable of sustaining takeaway options. Carmy sternly tells Sydney that he had called her work references before hiring her. She appears baffled, but Carmy explains that Sydney's curriculum vitae was excellent but that The Beef restaurant was not, which is why he had to verify why she wanted to take a downgrade by working with him. He learned that she is very talented but also too eager and impatient to learn what it takes to run a restaurant.

Sydney takes offence at the feedback and insinuates that Carmy is insulting her for her failed independent catering business. Carmy dismisses this notion and requests for more time to consider adding a new dish to the menu. Carmy asks whether Sydney can cook her new dish without obstructing the workflow of the kitchen while also gaining approval from the dishwashers with the new messes being made. Sydney has already thought ahead and has cleared those obstacles. Carmy tries to make Sydney empathise with him by reflecting on the new-found relaxed nature of the restaurant and that he does not want to lose it. They are interrupted by Natalie banging on the back door of the restaurant.

Carmy is pulled away from the discussion with Sydney to be yelled at by his sister regarding the restaurant owing taxes for the previous five years. As Natalie agreed to be a co-owner of the restaurant, she is being threatened with having her house seized by the Internal Revenue Service unless they make a payment plan. She is stressed by having to do her usual work at the bank while also having to organise the chaotic records kept by their brother Michael when he was running the restaurant. Richie overhears the conversation but they do not take solace in his sympathies. Natalie reluctantly enters the restaurant office to review the documents they have.

Richie walks to the front of the restaurant to have a cigarette and sees that the adjacent bar, The Green Door Tavern, has closed down. He feels uneasy about his environment rapidly changing around him and about losing his identity.

Gary inspects Marcus' fermentation set up and is worried about it being hazardous to his health. He asks who made the pastries on the pictures on the walls. Marcus explains that the pictures are from Richard Hart, the founder of Hart Bageri in Copenhagen, Denmark. Gary also shows concern for Marcus, thinking he is homeless from noticing a pillow and blanket under his work station. Gary offers him a place to stay, after telling him a story about how he was homeless himself while trying out for the Cubs baseball team in the past. Marcus explains that he has been sleeping at the restaurant to save time on his commute because he wants more time to work on his donuts in the kitchen. Gary suggests that Marcus' obsession is psychopathic and suggests that he take a shower. Marcus is astonished that Gary was formerly a professional baseball player.

At the front counter, Richie is dejected and stares out the window. Sydney is worried about Richie as his usual upbeat attitude has disappeared. Richie laments the closing of the bar next door despite never patronising the venue. He enjoyed knowing about its existence as it was a landmark fixture in his area. Sydney tries to relate by naming some of her favourite places, such as Logan, Wicker, and Pilsen. Richie disagrees and states that the aforementioned establishments had changed for the worse. This is why he wants The Beef restaurant to remain the same in order to preserve history. He also values the principles of love and respect.

Richie tells a story about how the architect John Storrs did not see the point in carving a face in the Goddess statue on top of the Board of Trade because it was the tallest building at the time. It looks unusual in the modern day because every building is taller than the one preceding it. The story is interrupted by gunshots in the window of the Beef, but nobody is hurt due to the glass being bulletproof and it being from a small pistol.

Richie goes outside to investigate and sees a bunch of gangsters down the street. Richie is already acquainted with them and condones their illegal activities, but asks them to move their business elsewhere. The gangsters object because the construction of a new fast casual restaurant chain, Sweetgreen, poses a safety hazard. He requests that the gangsters find out who shot the restaurant.

Natalie suggests calling the police but there is an overwhelming negative response. She is also stressed about being exposed to violence, and the prospect of losing her home due to the fault of her drug-addicted brother. Carmy refuses to acknowledge her feelings and blames her for co-signing the finances of the restaurant. Natalie accuses Carmy of suppressing his trauma but his angers them both.

Carmy joins Richie outside and they both realise that they have no skills in accounting despite both being working in the hospitality industry for a long time. Richie asks Carmy about a burn scar on his arm. Carmy states that it was not from an oven, but from Michael's 15th birthday party when he fell into the barbecue while trying to break up a fight between Jan-Carlo and Fak. Carmy admits that he is afraid of something good happening in fear that something bad will happen in return. Richie then tells a story about how his daughter has a warped view of him due to noticing negative traits from his ex-wife. He is hurt that his wife called him contagious and bad news. This is one of the reasons for Richie's current low mood.

Marcus tests out a compote from the fermented strawberries and records his experiments. Despite Richie feeling depressed, he forces himself to feign happiness as he is Head Waiter at the restaurant. The regular patrons genuinely enjoy his company.

As the chefs are busy during dinner service, Sydney manages to make test runs of her risotto and cola-braised beef short ribs. Tina tastes it and is impressed. Carmy does a walkthrough and rearranges staff to assist Richie at the front, provides feedback on shortening the cooking time of the chicken, and suggests that the grease traps get cleaned.

Carmy appreciates that Sydney has waited for a quiet moment to ask for him to try her new dish. He thinks that the risotto is tremendous but that the sauce is not yet perfect. Ebraheim and Alex, the dishwasher, interrupt and try some of the dish. Sydney pushes for the dish to be placed on the menu, but Carmy does not provide her with a timeframe which frustrates her. Sydney has a rash moment where she offers her dish to a guest as a complimentary meal.

Carmy and Natalie continue to look for the proper documents in the office. Carmy stumbles upon a bottle of prescription medication, presumably the ones his brother was abusing. He then admits to Natalie that he would have co-signed for the restaurant with Michael as well. They finally discuss their feelings and she confronts Carmy about him never asking her about how she is doing. Carmy thinks that Natalie blames the restaurant instead of the people who wronged her, such as their mother or Michael. He compares Natalie to their emotionally-unstable mother. Carmy explains his lack of empathy on not knowing how to process his own emotions, let alone somebody else's. He finally is able to ask his sister how she is feeling. In a moment of luck, they are able to find the proper tax documents in an unclearly labelled folder.

Sydney does a walkthrough of the kitchen and notices that the chefs are starting to change their attitudes and work ethics. One example being the lowboy fridges being organised neatly. As Sydney glances at the guest enjoying her risotto, she feels motivated and enlightened, but this is quickly disrupted by a ruckus outside from rival gangs arguing. She provides feedback for Ebraheim to sharpen his knife, but Richie frantically searches the restaurant for his gun to manage the situation outside. As the guests inside the restaurant are frightened, Sydney reassured them before confronting the gang with assistance from Tina and Gary. Richie searches inside the dishwashing area and the workers of colour are offended that Richie insinuated that they took his weapon. He is finally able to find his gun in the boot of his car, but sees that Sydney has already reached a diplomatic solution with the gangs. She offers them leftover Italian Beef sandwiches every Tuesday and they negotiate for extra soft drinks. Richie is astonished at how issues can be resolved without his input.

During a busy rush in the kitchen, Richie annoys the chefs by telling a long-winded story but nobody is listening. When Sydney continually tells him to go back to the front, he swears at her and Tina intervenes. Richie has a tantrum and throws kitchen equipment on the floor. Tina suggests that Richie goes home to calm down. She acknowledges Michael and the history of the restaurant, but takes pride in the new direction and growth. Richie is on the verge of tears as he feels betrayed that his values are being phased out by Sydney, who is much younger than him. He threatens to quit but Tina chastises him that he has nowhere else to go. Richie's once-happy memories of Michael and old times become a haunting reminder that he is holding onto the past. Richie is desperately losing his sense of purpose.

Back in the kitchen, everybody has a symbiotic workflow. Sydney is the Expediter and instructs the chefs through their stations. Carmy focuses on his own station and uses a cake tester to gauge the doneness of the chicken. Carmy apologises to Sydney for being blunt with her when they were discussing the risotto being placed on the menu. Sydney announces that a local weatherman, Tom Skilling is dining at the restaurant and requests Marcus for a special dessert. However, Marcus is distracted by his donut experiments. Carmy is pleased at how the restaurant is operating but requests more urgency from his staff.

Outside, the gangsters are dispersed by lights and sirens from police officers. Richie looks away in shame, implying that he reported them to gain a modicum of control over his life."

Tensions rise.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Christopher Storer'],"['', '', '']",[],"['restaurant review', 'stabbed in the butt', 'quitting a job', 'montage', 'long take', 'single take']",[],"The radio host at 93.1 FM WXRT, Lin Brehmer, introduces the song, This is Chicago by Sufjan Stevens. The relaxing music plays through multiple camera angles of the city including many diverse buildings and elevated trains during the morning. Sydney takes the train, while Manny takes the bus to work. The classic restaurants of Chicago are shown, such as Parky's Hot Dogs, Johnnie's Beef, Pequod Pizzeria, Gene's & Jude's, Superdawg Drive-In, and the baseball stadium, Wrigley Field.

In the restaurant, Marcus has a small setup where he deep fries a donut.

Iconic people and events from Chicago are shown, such as The Great Migration, African-American working class, the gangster Al Capone, former Governor Rod Blagojevich, protests, fans of basketball and Michael Jordan, and former President Barack Obama.

Ebraheim rides a bicycle to work, and Carmy walks from the train station to the restaurant. Once he enters, the entire sequence is completed in one camera take without any interruptions.

Ebraheim slightly struggles while reading a review written by a food critic about The Beef restaurant. The review describes the restaurant as previously being reliable, but is now considered elegant. Meanwhile, Marcus fills the fried donut with a fermented cherry compote. Carmy tells Ebraheim to stop reading because the restaurant is busy preparing for opening in 20 minutes, but Ebraheim continues reading the positive feedback.

Tina has not yet arrived for her shift and Sydney is covering her preparation. Sydney is nervous around Carmy, and tries to stop Ebraheim from reading the next passage that compliments her risotto dish that Carmy told her not to serve. Sydney had unknowingly given the leftover risotto to a random guest who coincidentally was the food critic who wrote the review. Carmy questions Sydney, but then tells her that he harbours no animosity towards her. He then insults the food critic by calling him a hack, as the sandwiches are different to the risotto. Today is the anticipated day that the restaurant offers takeaway orders, but the systems are not yet ready.

Tina finally arrives and brings her teenage son, Louie, to the kitchen. The reason she is late is because her son was suspended from highschool. Tina asks Carmy to provide work experience for her son, but Carmy is hesitant due to being busy with the new systems. Carmy then passes the responsibility to Sydney. Sydney questions Tina why she brought her son, and Tina explains that he has delinquent tendencies and a lack of direction in life. Tina's logic is that Sydney has transformed her negative mindset and is hoping Sydney can do the same for her son.

Richie walks into the kitchen, also reading the review and insults the critic by calling him a hack. Carmy immediately agrees. Richie does not like the idea of having Risotto on the menu and sexually harasses Sydney by implying that she had sexual relations with somebody in the newspaper industry to have the review published. Fak also reads the review but does not understand the terminology used by the critic.

Carmy does an inventory count to ascertain that they have a maximum of 25 salads, 32 chickens, and 100 beef sandwiches. Marcus is distracted and is unable to answer regarding his number of cakes. Carmy threatens Marcus that if he is still working on the donuts that he will be punished. Sydney tries to show Louie how to work in the front-of-house section, but Richie refuses. She then tries to update Richie on how the takeaway system will operate.

Richie continues to bully Sydney by insinuating that Sydney's plan was to take over the restaurant and implement her new methods thereby eliminating the blue-collar demographic in favour of white-collar patrons. Sydney denies the allegations and states that she only wants to increase business and insults Richie on his principles. Richie is offended and retorts that Sydney does not have to be mean-spirited. She tells him not to speak to her and also insults the regular customers, stating that they are the least paying yet most condescending patrons of the restaurant. Sydney is tired of bickering and realises they have not discussed how to operate the new takeaway system. Carmy has to de-escalate their argument and tells them that he has activated the systems before they were ready. Sydney confronts Carmy and points out that she feels they are not amicable, but Carmy does not acknowledge her concerns.

Tina calls them back into the kitchen and is panicked at the sight of an endless wave of tickets being printed from the takeaway orders. Carmy blames Sydney for not turning off the pre-order option on the takeaway system and realises that they have insurmountable orders of 78 slices of chocolate cake, 99 serves of french fries, 54 chickens, 38 salads, and 255 beef sandwiches that are due in 8 minutes when the restaurant opens. Richie exacerbates the situation by ridiculing Sydney, which infuriates her.

Carmy spirals out of control and is angry at Sydney for serving her dish. She is baffled at his true feelings towards her. In a rash moment of stress, Carmy orders the chefs to gather all available food and to prepare it immediately. He also orders Fak to assist, despite him not having experience in the hospitality industry. Carmy restructures the kitchen roles from the brigade system to now be three sections of wet, hot, and sweet foods.

Richie tosses the fries in seasoning, Louie is the food runner, Gary is in charge of labelling the bags and organising the tickets. Sydney is frustrated and dislikes that Richie is doing kitchen duties without proper training. When Sydney checks on Marcus, she discovers he has still been working on his donuts and has ignored all instructions. He fails to understand the sense of urgency in the kitchen and surmises that while the cakes are baking, he has free time for himself.

Carmy fails to understand Sydney's Expediter workflow, but as she tries to explain herself, he screams at her to leave. He yells new instructions at the kitchen to prepare 76 beef sandwiches, 34 chickens, 12 french fries, and 12 mashed potatoes.

As Marcus has not yet sliced the cakes, Sydney rushes through the kitchen but forgets to alert staff that she is coming around the corner. She crashes into Richie, who was appropriately alerting the staff, and drops two cakes onto the floor. Richie absolves himself of blame by stating that Sydney did not alert him of her presence. She insults him but he retorts that the frantic state of the kitchen was Sydney's fault. Tina provides reassurance to Sydney and tells her that she is behaving uncharacteristically. Instead of taking support, Sydney insults Tina and her son, the restaurant, and tells her to get back to work.

Carmy updates the orders that they are waiting on 55 beef, 24 chickens, 41 hot dogs, and 6 Greek salads, but his permanent marker has run out of ink. Tina reports that they are out of giardiniera relish, so Carmy orders Sydney to prepare it. Suddenly, he also tells Richie to prepare it. Richie tells Carmy that another two orders of cakes have been processed, but Carmy tells him to cancel them. Fak comments on how Carmy is furious.

When Richie assists Sydney with the salads, she refuses his help and Richie tells her that she has a deep-seated vicious personality. Sydney is offended and she retaliates by insulting his self-worth and parenting skills. This angers Richie as he walks close to her face where Sydney keeps the distance by pointing at him with her knife. Richie asks Sydney if she will stab him, and she threatens that maybe she will.

Carmy tells them to shut up and is interrupted by Marcus who shows him that he has finally perfected a yeast donut instead of making a cake donut. This sends Carmy into a rage and he slaps the donut out of Marcus' hands.

In turn, Richie tells Carmy to calm down but as he walks backwards to his station, he feels Sydney's knife pierce the right side of his gluteal region. Fak is overwhelmed by the gruesome sight and the hectic environment. Things are made worse when a customer enters the restaurant. Carmy checks on Louie and commends him on his work.

Embraheim is the first-aid officer and dresses the wound on Richie's leg. Richie blocks out the pain by listening to Ebraheim educating him about the Somali civil war which was the inspiration behind the movie, Black Hawk Down. In his story, he mentions how things were exacerbated when the factions disallowed foreign intervention.

As Marcus is upset at the outburst from Carmy, he destroys his donuts in the dining room and walks out. Carmy continues the carnage when he screams at the staff to cook more food that has long been out of stock.

Presumably, a customer asks Louie if the restaurant serves risotto, to which everyone exclaims no. Carmy sees Sydney sitting alone in the locker room and she quits in the middle of service. She states that Carmy is an excellent chef, but a horrible human being. Carmy is irate to the point where he is lost for words. To calm himself down, he takes a bite from Marcus' donut that he slapped onto the ground and is impressed by the flavours. When Richie asks Carmy whether the restaurant is open for business, he smashes the ticket printer, and walks out of the kitchen."

He tells the story of how his drug-addicted brother committed suicide by shooting himself in the head while on the State Street Bridge in Chicago. Carmy resents that his brother did not leave a letter or say goodbye. Instead, his brother gave Carmy the restaurant in his will which Carmy finds insulting. Michael never allowed Carmy to work there with him, despite Carmy being overqualified. Before Carmy is able to prepare the food, his ingredients disappear and he burns himself on a smoking pot. As he is flustered, he begs the cackling audience and producers of the show to stop filming. He also has flashbacks to his nightmare of a literal bear attacking him on the bridge.

Carmy frantically wakes up to discover that those experiences were only bad dreams. He sees on his phone that Uncle Jimmy wants to meet with him which makes him feel worse. In his head, he can hear Michael's soothing voice supporting him when he used to be upset. Carmy continues to be haunted by the previous day's disastrous service involving the takeaway system, his former Executive Chef in New York who tormented him, and visions of wild bears.

As he stares at his enormous collection of cookbooks, he hears Michael incessantly telling him that he is too good to be working at The Beef restaurant. To calm himself down, he thinks back to dishes like Shrimp and Grits, Pig's Ears with Accoutrements, Miso Black Cod, Cassarecce in Tomato Sauce with Green Asparagus, Black Truffle Risotto, and a beetroot rose dish. Carmy takes the most inspiration from Alaine Ducasse of Le Louis XV and Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park.

Carmy attends an Al-Anon meeting and finally accepts the invitation to speak, as he has been to fewer than 15 meetings. He introduces himself by his real name and tells his story involving his brother being addicted to painkillers. Carmy also tells the group about his experiences as a chef and cooking alongside Michael since they were children. He cherishes that their love for food was a commonality. They both had aspirations to open a restaurant together. He appreciates that his brother was there to support him during times of anxiety with his phrase of ""Let it rip."" Carmy remembers his brother being boisterous and hilarious, while also having great social awareness. He reflects that his own personality was the opposite. Carmy did not have many friends in his youth, had a speech impediment, and was poor in academics. He also did not have any amorous relationships and lacks a sense of humour. Carmy thought of his brother as his best friend, and comments that Michael also made others feel like he was their best friend purely from his charisma. Carmy is hurt that he did not know his brother was abusing drugs, as he thought they knew everything about each other. However, as they grew older, Carmy realised that he knew nothing about his brother. Carmy is bitter that his brother abruptly denied him entry to The Bear restaurants in recent years. Carmy used the rejection as an unhealthy motivation to excel in his career as a chef in fine dining establishments to spite his brother.

In his pursuit, he admits that it took a drastic toll on him physically and mentally. He gives examples of doing menial tasks of separating herbs, shucking shellfish, getting cut, having ingredients lodged into his fingernails, having dry and oily skin simultaneously, having callouses on his fingers, and having a disrupted gastrointestinal system due to frequently vomiting from anxiety. Despite the high pressure environments, Carmy was engulfed in his work.

Carmy states that it took him years before he felt comfortable as a chef and was able to work quickly and fearlessly. He had developed a strong palate, knowledge of flavour pairings, food theory, and technical skills. He had rivalries in the kitchen and was hostile towards his colleagues. He took pride in expressing his confidence through his food and creativity, all in the hopes that Michael would acknowledge his efforts. However, when he never received recognition from his brother, he continued to become antisocial and obsessed with his passion for cooking. As Carmy devoted all of his time to the restaurant industry, he was unable to see the signs of his brother who was struggling with his own issues and eventually died.

Carmy now realises that his efforts in trying to fix his family's failing restaurant was a proxy for him trying to repair the damage done to his family in the wake of his brother's death. He acknowledges that the restaurant has significance for many people including the staff, his family and especially for himself. However, Carmy is in suspense if the restaurant held any meaning to his brother.

Back at the restaurant, the mood has shifted with an eerie quietness. Nobody has spoken to Marcus since he walked out. Richie is recovering from the stab wound from Sydney that narrowly missed his orifice. Ebraheim comments that he has had to provide first aid in many gruelling situations. During the pre-service meeting, Carmy regrettably informs the team that the restaurant will be closed at night in order to host a Bachelor party as a favour for Uncle Jimmy's friend. The staff are disappointed.

Sydney hosts a dinner in her house for Marcus so they process their emotions after leaving the restaurant. Sydney has not used her time to relax and has constantly been cooking at home. Marcus and Sydney share stories that both of their parents were very driven people. Sydney reassures Marcus when he feels guilty for nearly having a mental breakdown, and states that it is normal in the restaurant industry. Sydney cooks him a pan-seared sea bass with tomato confit, garnished with herbs and lemon zest. She tells stories of when she was in culinary school and spent her meagre savings to dine at fine-dining restaurants in New York but avoids sharing her favourite restaurant experience. Sydney speaks about her work experience where a Head Chef only allowed her to grate lemon zest as her sole duty for eight months.

Carmy reviews Michael's financial bookkeeping systems again and Tina asks him how he is doing. She is concerned as Carmy is not as animated as usual. Carmy notices that Tina has finally embraced the blue apron that she used to avoid in the beginning. He asks Tina if she knows about a company called KBL Electric, but Tina answers that she had no idea what Michael was doing. In the account-keeping books, Carmy notices large transactions each month which totals the $330 000 that Uncle Jimmy had loaned him. Tina tells the story of how Michael refused to pay vendors, especially for napkins, as he felt it was futile due to struggling on finances. The depressed and cynical attitude was highly uncharacteristic of Michael which concerned Tina at the time. Tina tells Carmy that she loved Michael a lot.

Back at Sydney's house, she tells Marcus that she tried some of his donut that was on the floor of the restaurant, and thought that it was amazing. They both make fun of Carmy for his temperament, but Marcus contemplates going back to the restaurant. Sydney admits that the stress of being a delivery driver was worse than being a chef. She mentions that her family did not go to restaurants often, which made every occasion feel special, likewise in Marcus' situation. Sydney uses her life experience as her career goals; she wants to make people happy with her food and provide them with the best experience. Sydney is unsure of where to work next and is constrained by her financial debt, making it difficult to pursue her dreams. Marcus thanks Sydney and Carmy for teaching him invaluable skills in the restaurant. Sydney finally reveals that her favourite dining experience was in Carmy's restaurant when he worked in New York. She acknowledges his culinary skills but insults his character.

As The Beef hosts the Bachelor party, there are strippers, illicit substances and guests behaving wildly. While Richie and Carmy have a cigarette break outside, Richie expresses his resentment with Michael and that Michael's poor management put them in this situation. He regrets not forcing Michael to seek help for his addiction despite Michael making promises. Richie expresses disbelief that Carmy had not realised that Michael was addicted to drugs. Carmy defends his own ignorance and blames the fact that he never saw Michael, and that Michael rejected his phone calls. Richie comments that Michael's larger-than-life personality made Richie believe that he was never capable of committing suicide.

An altercation inside the restaurant interrupts their conversation and they run inside to intervene. Richie punches a guest in the face which causes the guest to hit their head on the counter, being knocked unconscious. Richie is placed into police custody as the guest was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. He is fearful that he will be charged with manslaughter if the guest dies. Richie exercises his right to make a phone call; instead of calling for help, he calls his ex-wife and leaves an unrelated message apologising for having a poor relationship with her father. Richie is awoken with good news from the police officer that the victim has regained consciousness and that the charges were downgraded to aggravated assault.

Carmy picks Richie up from the police station and discovers that Carmy had used the restaurant's emergency funds as bail. Richie thanks him, and Carmy tells him to prepare the arcade game machines in order to raise revenue. Richie breaks into tears and tells Carmy that he is the only family he has remaining, as they both sit in silence.

At the restaurant, Carmy and Richie clean up the mess from the party the night before. Carmy sees Marcus in the kitchen and apologises for the way that he treated him and his glad that Marcus has returned. Marcus accepts his apology. Ebraheim feels disrespected when he finds a stripper's garment on his workstation, but Gary takes it away. When Tina sees Richie after being bailed out, she is elated and gives him a hug. Gary gives Richie the stripper garment as a present which makes him laugh.

Fak fixes the Ballbreaker arcade game and imagines the in-game character giving him advice to bottle up his emotions when he is upset. The staff do a full clean of the kitchen and begin their preparation. Carmy is in charge of completing Sydney's duties in her absence. Tina jokingly warns Carmy that if he treats her in the same manner that he did with Sydney, she will annihilate him. As there is a River North Festival, Carmy instructs everyone to prepare extra ingredients for the increased demand.

Carmy stumbles upon Sydney's notebook that she left behind and sees her recipe for the braised beef short rib risotto. The meat delivery man arrives but brings pork instead of beef. He refuses to fix the error and tells Carmy to contact the distributor.

Carmy realises that the restaurant has no beef remaining and laughs at his misfortune. Carmy has flashbacks at how the restaurant previously operated in squalor, had unpaid invoices, and had broken equipment. As he turns on the stove to light his cigarette, there is an eruption of flames. Carmy has another moment of catharsis as he stares at the flames engulfing the stovetop, thinking about how his anxiety will disappear if the restaurant is destroyed. Tina and Gary intervene and extinguish the flames. Richie slaps him out of his daze and shows genuine concern.

As Carmy takes a break in the locker room, Richie takes out the hidden letter from Michael and finally gives it to Carmy. Richie admits that he hid the letter from Carmy and wanted to spare him the pain of having to read a potential suicide note from his brother. Carmy quietly forgives Richie and steps outside to read it alone. Before he opens the envelope, he sends a message to Sydney to give feedback that her braised beef needed an acidic component. Sydney is continuing to experiment with recipes in her home kitchen as she responds to the text messages. Carmy apologises for his abusive behaviour but she does not accept it. He tells her to come to the restaurant to pick up her final paycheck.

When Carmy opens the letter from Michael, the words ""I love you dude. Let it rip."" brings him to tears, as he still resents Michael for abandoning him. On the other side of the letter, there is a recipe for the Spaghetti meal that involves the 28-ounce cans of tomatoes. Michael thinks the smaller cans of tomatoes taste better than the large ones which makes Carmy laugh.

Ebraheim tells stories, reminiscing about being a grill master when he lived in Somalia. It is Carmy's turn to cook the pre-service family meal and he decides to cook Michael's Spaghetti. However, he chooses the 108-ounce cans of tomatoes instead of the smaller ones that Michael suggested.

Marcus is making another chocolate cake and applies a dark chocolate ganache on top. This cake looks like a noticeable improvement over the first few cakes that he baked, which shows his progress.

Richie monitors Fak as he is repairing the soda machine and offers him an opportunity to become a full-time employee instead of a contractor. Fak compliments Richie on how he was able to valiantly handle being stabbed by Sydney.

Carmy reminds the chefs to keep up the hygiene in the kitchen while he is preparing the family meal. When he pours the canned tomatoes into the pan, he notices a tightly-wrapped roll of cash. He opens it to discover a significant amount of money and screams for help from Richie. All of the staff members grab the cans of tomatoes to open, each revealing a roll of cash inside as they dump it on the floor. Everybody is in awe and makes jokes.

When Sydney arrives at the restaurant, she is astonished by the money and the mess on the floor. Richie tacitly forgives Sydney by telling her to join in and grab a can opener. Carmy also offers a truce by suggesting ideas on how to renovate the restaurant, such as having a new restaurant with two-seat tables and booths while serving the food in an unpretentious manner. Sydney accepts his apology as she suggests her own ideas of a Danish design, which concentrates on a functional and sleek decor, fine dining restaurant with a tasting menu at the bar. Carmy agrees and suggests continuing to serve Italian Beef sandwiches as a takeaway option by having a window where guests can collect their food. When Sydney asks Carmy what they should call their new restaurant, he takes time to consider it. After taking one last look at the restaurant from the outside, he puts up a sign stating that The Beef is closed and thanks the customers for their patronage. There is another note that reveals that the new restaurant will be called ""The Bear"" which is in reference to the restaurant that he wanted to open with Michael.

The staff enjoy the family meal of spaghetti with tomato sauce. Friends and family are also invited, including Pete, Natalie and Chester. Everyone banters and shares a joyful moment together, including Carmy who has a big smile on his face. Carmy is finally able to heal after all the moments of anguish, and begins to associate good memories with his family's restaurant and his brother."

Watching as the corpse of Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, is tended to, Jaime Lannister assures his twin sister, Queen Cersei Lannister, that if Arryn had spoken to anyone about them, they would already have been executed.

Exiled prince Viserys Targaryen plots to reclaim his father's throne from King Robert Baratheon, and brokers a marriage between his sister Daenerys and Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo. As wedding gifts, Daenerys is given books of the Seven Kingdoms from Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight loyal to the Targaryens, and three petrified dragon eggs from Magister Illyrio Mopatis, who helped arrange the marriage.

The Starks of Winterfell are introduced: Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark, his wife Lady Catelyn, their children - heir Robb, elder daughter Sansa, younger daughter Arya, ten-year-old son Bran, youngest son, Rickon, Ned's bastard son Jon Snow and ward Theon Greyjoy.

Ned takes his sons to witness Will's execution for desertion. Ignoring Will's warning of the White Walkers, Ned beheads him, insisting Walkers are long extinct. The Starks find a dead stag, sigil of House Baratheon, and a dead direwolf, sigil of the Starks, whose pups (Grey Wind, Lady, Nymeria, Summer, Shaggydog, Ghost) are taken in by the children.

News arrives of the death of Lord Arryn, Eddard's friend and Catelyn's brother-in-law. Winterfell receives the royal court, including King Robert, his wife Queen Cersei, their children - heir Prince Joffrey, Princess Myrcella, and Prince Tommen - as well as the Queen's twin brother Jaime, a member of the Kingsguard, and his and Cersei's younger brother Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf known as ""The Imp"". Robert pays respects to Lyanna Stark, his late fiancée and Ned's sister, appoints Ned the new Hand of the King, and suggests Sansa be betrothed to Joffrey. Catelyn receives a message from her sister Lysa, Arryn's widow, who suspects her husband was killed by the Lannisters. Ned reluctantly accepts the position of Hand of the King.
