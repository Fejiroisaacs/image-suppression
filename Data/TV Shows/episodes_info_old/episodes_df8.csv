Kaz's plan hinges on a hidden door.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Mairzee Almas'],"['', '', '']",[],"['good vs evil', 'impossible heist']",[],"Alina is adjusting to life at the Little Palace, talking with Marie and Nadia, but she is still sad that all of her letters to Mal have gone unanswered. She has become good friends with Genya, who helps her get ready for the winter fete. Alina notices the festival outside reminds her of butter week in Keramzin, and she encourages Genya to let her go and see the festivities.

Kaz, disguised in a guard's uniform, monitors the route Alina will walk later that night after her performance. Jesper and Inej have gained entry into the palace by posing as performers for the fete. Jesper finds horses that can get their carriage out quickly, and Inej practices her acrobatic routine. Outside, Jesper notices Genya call Alina's name. He realizes she is Alina Starkov, their target. In a carriage, Kaz outlines their plan: the Conductor will retrieve Alina from the secret room, and the Crows will provide cover on the way out.

Alina goes to see General Kirigan. They talk about her upcoming performance, and she admits that she'd felt nervous until she realized what the demonstration means to the people. She wants to be able to give them hope, and Kirigan says that means a lot to him. Alina kisses him and when she pulls away, they're both smiling.

Alina attends the fete wearing Kirigan's colors: a black kefta embroidered with gold trim. Though she is supposed to enter later, Alina sees Kirigan suffering through a dull conversation with the king and enters the main room early. Kirigan darkens the room so Alina can put on a show for the audience, leaving everybody awestruck with dazzling lights and glowing orbs. The whole crowd bows to her and calls her ""Sankta Alina"".

Meanwhile, Mal stumbles his way back to the First Army camp, claiming to have found the stag. He demands he be allowed to deliver the news to Kirigan so he can see Alina. The First Army general agrees and sends Mal and another soldier to ride to the palace together. Mal tells the palace guards he found the stag, which admits him to Kirigan's quarters. Kirigan asks Mal to show him where the stag was on a map, but Mal refuses to give the exact location until he can see Alina. Reluctantly, Kirigan agrees to let him meet her later.

The Conductor enters the secret room where Alina is kept. Instead of kidnapping her, however, he slits her throat, revealing his allegiance with West Ravkan General Zlatan. It turns out that Alina was a decoy-Marie tailored to look like Alina-and Kaz set up the plan to get the Conductor caught. Genya fights off the Conductor and restores Marie's features as she dies. Dressed as guards, Kaz and Inej tell Alina they will escort her to dinner, but Kirigan interrupts and offers to take Alina to dinner.

A female palace guard goes to Baghra and informs her that Mal has found the stag and told Kirigan. Baghra does not want Kirigan to have such power, and has the guard bring Mal to her hut. The guard reveals herself to be a Durast and attempts to kill Mal, but he kills her instead.

Kirigan takes Alina to his chambers, where they kiss passionately until Ivan knocks at the door, interrupting them. Ivan tells Kirigan about the attempt on Alina's life; Kirigan tells Alina he will be right back. Baghra enters the room through a secret passageway and tells her she wants to protect Alina from Kirigan. She says that Kirigan wants to use Alina's power to expand the Fold and fegyverezni it because he is really the Black Heretic. Baghra reveals herself as a Shadow Summoner and Kirigan's mother. In truth, Kirigan turned hundreds of innocent people into vulkra when he created the Fold. Kirigan has spent centuries waiting for the Sun Summoner and obsessed with finding the stag so he can have its amplifying power. Baghra explains a secret way out of the palace for Alina, directing her to Grisha who are loyal to Baghra. Unwilling to yet again do what someone else tells her to do, Alina decides to take a different path instead.

Kirigan meets Baghra outside the palace. She tells him she has ""disposed of"" the tracker, so his greed for the stag will go unsatisfied. She also says he will never be able to use Alina against anyone, to which Kirigan snaps that Alina is the future and threatens Baghra if she has put Alina in harm's way. Secretly, Mal listens in.

Kaz is followed and nearly killed by an Inferni. Inej saves his life, throwing a knife across the room and into the Inferni's head. She is shocked and full of regret for killing someone, but Kaz emphasizes that she saved his life. They leave the Little Palace without Alina. Jesper has been waiting by a carriage and is awestruck when Alina, unaware that anyone is watching, voluntarily climbs into the back of the carriage he had commandeered. Kaz and Inej make it outside and tell Jesper they've lost their target but Jesper grins, knowing otherwise."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601516/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,"Furious over the Sun Summoner, Kirigan hunts for information. Alina receives a helping hand when she needs it most. Nina warms to a Grisha hunter.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Mairzee Almas'],"['', '', '']",[],"['good vs evil', 'impossible heist']",[],"Inside the Little Palace, Kirigan learns from the captured Conductor that West Ravkan General Zlatan wants the Sun Summoner dead. He hired the Conductor to kill Alina rather than take her across the Fold. Now that Alina is with the Crows, Kirigan and the Conductor assume she will be taken across; Kirigan wants to find her before that. The Conductor offers his help, but Kirigan kills him. Fedyor tells Kirigan that Nina Zenik has been captured by Fjerdan Boszorkányvadászok. Zoya attempts to comfort Kirigan, but he refuses to rest until Alina is found.

Alina escapes from the Crows. While walking around a market, she accidentally reveals herself when she uses her powers to fend off a ügyes soldier. She flees into the woods, where Mal is waiting for her. He takes her to safety, where they argue about who didn't respond to whose letters, whether she knew she was Grisha, and whether she lied to him. They talk things through, and Mal tells her he's been trying to get back to her the whole time. They embrace, make a camp together, and Alina uses her powers to keep them warm.

After Alina's escape, Kaz and Inej argue. Inej let her go, believing in Alina's Saint-like power and her potential to save her people. On the other hand, Kaz argues that her powers were an illusion, and he is furious with Inej for letting Alina slip away. He tells Inej that if they do not return with Alina, Heleen will get the Crow Club and Pekka will get the rest of their city. Inej is confused because she does not know about his deal with Heleen; unwilling to explain, Kaz leaves the table.

The Crows debate leaving empty-handed, since they have lost Alina's trail, are out of money, and know Kirigan will soon track them down. As they are leaving the tavern, Kirigan, Zoya, Ivan, and Polina see them; the Crows split up and flee. Seeking revenge for the death of her brother, Polina chases Inej and injures Inej before Inej stabs and kills Polina. Jesper and Ivan face off, and Jesper's accuracy leads Ivan to guess that Jesper is hiding something before Jesper knocks him unconscious. Kirigan stops Kaz in an alley and demands to know what he did with the Sun Summoner. Kaz tells him the truth: Alina fled on her own, unwilling to be a captive any longer. Kirigan tries to kill Kaz with the Cut, but he escapes in a flash of bright light. The Crows then steal Kirigan's carriage and escape.

Meanwhile, the storm wrecked the Boszorkányvadászok' ship, leaving Nina and Matthias clinging to a piece of wood in the violent, freezing sea. In the aftermath, they must work together to stay alive. They reach land, find an abandoned shelter, discuss their respective cultures, and sleep together to keep warm. As they trek through the snow together, Matthias eventually admits he likes Nina, and they both end up laughing and playing around. When Nina unexpectedly almost falls through a crevasse in the ice, Matthias saves her life.

Alina treats Mal's wounded shoulder and they make plans to find the stag together. Alina thinks that if she can use it as an amplifier, she can grow strong enough to destroy the Fold, and she needs to keep its power away from Kirigan. They head for Fjerda, toward where Mal last saw the stag. David tells Kirigan he can track Alina using a special ring she is wearing. From a city guard, Kirigan learns that a tracker with the First Army was also searching for Alina. He realizes Mal and Alina have been reunited."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601518/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,"The fate of the stag leaves Alina in an impossible position with Kirigan, whose connection to the Fold - and the power behind it - falls into place.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Jeremy Webb'],"['', '', '']",[],"['good vs evil', 'impossible heist']",[],"In a flashback, we see the creation of the Fold. The King was rounding up Grisha and killing them, and Aleksander was on the run. He stops at the home of Luda, his lover, and prepares to flee together with her. However, the King's soldiers arrive and demand the Darkling be taken captive. Aleksander goes outside and confronts them; he is shot by several arrows, but Luda heals him from inside the house. The soldiers remove Luda from the house and kill her in front of Aleksander. Enraged, he breaks his restraints and beheads the entire company with the Cut.

He carries Luda to a Grisha hideout, where she dies. Baghra tells Aleksander that in using his powers to win a war for the King, he made the King afraid of Grisha and started a war on their people. Baghra tells her son to flee to Kerch and return when the King is dead. Instead, Aleksander researches merzost, even though Baghra forbids him to do so. When another company of soldiers demands he surrender to the King, he uses merzost to force the soldiers to serve him, turning them into volcra. However, the power is unstable, and he creates the Shadow Fold.

In the present timeline, Alina and Mal find the stag, but Alina cannot bring herself to kill it. She touches it and her powers glow, but suddenly Kirigan's soldiers shoot both the stag and Mal. Kirigan shows himself and offers Alina a choice-if she allows him to kill the stag, he will get Mal to a Healer. Mal begs Alina to forget about him and kill the stag, but Alina refuses to let Mal die. She accepts Kirigan's deal; and with one deadly cut, Kirigan kills the stag.

David Kostyk uses the stag's antlers to create two amplifiers-one for Kirigan, and a collar for Alina. Once bonded through the amplifier, Kirigan can control Alina's powers, giving him control over both the light and the darkness. They all travel back to the First Army camp by the Fold. In a Grisha tent, Alina meets Genya, who tells her that the King fell ill, the Apparat is now ruling in his stead, and the Queen is confined to her quarters. Alina realizes that Genya was a spy for Kirigan, not her friend, and hid Mal's letters from her. Alina is furious because she trusted Genya.

Kirigan goes to Mal in the tent where he is being held, and they discuss Alina. Later, Mal manages to break free of his shackles and escape. The next morning, Kirigan learns of Mal's escape from Ivan; however, he tells Alina that Mal is still being safely kept. He warns her that if she attempts to oppose him, he will hurt Mal. Kirigan orders Ivan and the guards to kill Mal if he returns anywhere near Alina.

The Crows make plans to return to Ketterdam. However, Inej now has a shot at freedom and doesn't want to go back to the Menagerie. That leads her and Kaz to have a heart-to-heart that night by a fire, where he tells her she was right about Alina. That doesn't mean he has faith in her Saints, though. ""I have faith in myself,"" he says, ""and you, and Jesper."" He promises Inej that if she comes back to Ketterdam, she will not return to Tante Heleen.

Kaz's new plan is to cross the Fold by sneaking on to Kirigan's ship, as he's heard the general plans to cross the next day. Inej sees right through it and asks Kaz if he's just trying to get Alina again, and that million kruge. ""So, all you want is to cross the Fold?"" she asks him. Kaz nods, and it seems that's settled.

They find themselves some new clothes, and papers, and get themselves onto the skiff. Mal also sneaks onto the skiff, and Alina and Kirigan board as well."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601520/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,"In the depths of the Fold, Kirigan demonstrates the scope of Alina's powers, while the Crows cross paths with a stowaway amid a do-or-die undertaking.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Jeremy Webb'],"['', '', '']",[],"['good vs evil', 'impossible heist']",[],"The Crows' new plan is to threaten Alina's life because of her power, but Mal steps in to stop them. Eventually, they all work out that they're on the same side, because they're all against Kirigan. Kaz advises caution as they figure out their next move, but Mal decides he's going to take on the general as soon as possible, and Inej goes with him.

Meanwhile, Kirigan has begun his master plan to actually extend the Fold into East Ravka, destroying the potential uprising there. Alina expresses her horror after he demolishes an entire city. He reminds her that some of the people there wanted her dead. Kirigan tells the crowd to take what they've seen that day back to their home countries and be advised there will be no more war with Ravka, because the Fold can be expanded into any land. When one diplomat speaks up and says Kirigan has now made all Grisha targets, he kills her and her guards.

Mal bursts onto the scene with a gun and tries to shoot Kirigan, while Inej tries to stab him. It doesn't work. Zoya turns against Kirigan and tries to manipulate the wind to get them out of there. Alina manages to break Kirigan's control over her, and she regains her powers by realizing that the stag itself controlled who used it as an Amplifier. It chose her. He watches as she glows and expands the light surrounding them. ""I was trying to save us,"" he exclaims before Mal tackles him. They both fall overboard.

The rest of the Crows join the fight and vanquish Kirigan's Grisha guards. Mal and Kirigan fight for a bit until Mal grabs hold of his gun, and then shoves him into the Fold where a vulkra attacks him. ""I don't have to kill you,"" he tells Kirigan, ""Your past will do it for me.""

Nina and Matthias are making plans to run away together and leave Fjerda and Ravka behind. Unfortunately, Nina runs into one of Kirigan's soldiers at the pub. He slows Matthias' heart so he loses consciousness for a few minutes, and he and Nina talk. Nina tries to tell him that Matthias is not the enemy, but the guard won't listen - he says Matthias must die for his crimes. Nina yells across the bar that Matthias is a slaver, which catches the attention of a man who'd been rounding up slavers for rewards. The guard allows the man to take both Nina and Matthias into custody.

When Matthias awakes, he tries to strangle Nina through the bars. She says she'll deny that he was a slaver at trial, but the man tells her the case won't go to trial for years, and in the meantime, Matthias will be locked up in Hellgate prison. Nina cries, having realized her grave mistake, and Matthias says he never should have trusted her.

Alina, Mal, the Crows and Zoya all sit in a field and talk about the future. Alina gives Kaz her hairpiece in exchange for him keeping information about her whereabouts and survival to himself. She also gives Inej one of her knives. In the end, they all go their separate ways. The Crows go back to Ketterdam, where one jewel from Alina's hairpiece will pay off Heleen and buy Inej's freedom for good. Zoya decides to go to East Ravka to see if her family survived Kirigan's attack. Alina and Mal are happy to just be together again and resolve to destroy the Fold for good.

Also, the Crows end up on the same ship back to Ketterdam as Nina. Kaz says they'll need a Heartrender, which is what Nina is.

At the very end of the episode, The Darkling (aka Kirigan) walks out of the Fold alive. He is not dead, like everyone assumed, but just scarred. A few monsters obediently follow him out."

After the first unsuccessful attempt, Randy and Catalina give him a self-help audio tape they bought from a yard sale which should help. Meanwhile, Joy finds a tape that Earl made before their divorce, in which he says that all his possessions should go to Joy in case of his death. Although Joy is normally not violent, this opportunity to get Earl's money prompts her to go to a weapon store in search of something lethal. Because there is a three-day waiting period for guns, she buys a crossbow to kill Earl, but fortunately, she is not a very good shot.

Earl, in the meanwhile, has Catalina pick an item from the list, and she chooses Donny Jones. Donny was one of Earl's friend, who got framed for a robbery that Earl committed. Earl was masked and sneezing at the time, but he also wore one of Donny's shirts, which caused Donny, who had caught Earl's cold and was wearing a similar shirt, to be caught and sentenced for 2 years in jail. Earl refuses, remembering Donny's history of unpredictably violent outbursts, fearing what Donny would do if he knew he'd been in jail thanks to Earl. He decides to focus on quitting smoking, but this makes him stressful, and stress generally makes him smoke.

Randy and Catalina decide to give Earl a 'push' by secretly making an appointment with Donny and 'dropping' Earl unwillingly in front of Donny's door. It turns out that Donny has become a devout born-again Christian in jail, going as far as tattooing an image of Jesus on his chest, and an image of Moses parting the Red Sea on his bottom. He also bought a Bible in large print for his mother, who refuses to wear glasses because she thinks they make her look old. When Earl reluctantly confesses to Donny that it was his fault that Donny was wrongfully imprisoned, Donny seems angry at first. But he remembers that Jesus would also 'turn the other cheek', and forgives Earl, stating that with his criminal record, he would have ended up in jail one day anyway. As Earl is about to leave, Donny's mother hits Earl with the oversized Bible. She is furious over the fact that she lost two years together with her son because of Earl's lies. However, Earl notices that Donny's mom is a smoker as well; although he can't give her back the two years she missed, he can give her two more years on Earth by making her quit smoking. She refuses, so Earl kidnaps her to his motel and ties her to a chair.

Crabman comes to visit with a dish full of cookies, courtesy of Joy, but he warns Earl that Joy put rat poison in the cookies (which doesn't stop Randy from wanting to try). After removing her gag, Donny's mom tries to scream, but realizing that forty years of smoking have had a disasterous effect on her voice volume, she finally gives in to make a combined effort with Earl to quit smoking. They try with the self-help tape, nicotine patches and by using carrots (although Earl mistakenly thinks he needs to light them), and after a few days, they succeed. Donny's mom thanks Earl, and as he is about to drive home, Joy is making another attempt to kill Earl, but he quickly informs her it's no use as he has already made a new will."

He picks the time that he broke Joy's fancy figurine, which he used as a stand to light firework from. But Joy is not interested in getting back a new figurine, she rather wants an extensive hot tub, but Earl is adamant that, in order for Karma to forgive him, he has to arrange a new statue.

It turns out that the figurine was actually the first price in a mother-daughter talent pageant, and the only way to get a new one is winning the pageant. Joy had won one time with her mother, but a year later, young Shelly Stoker and her mother entered the contest with a knife-throwing act, which was the start of a winning streak that lasted for years. So Earl gets the idea to go to Shelly and buy one of her figurines.

Shelly agrees to give Earl a figurine, provided that he assist in the knife act during the coming pageant, meaning he has to be tied to a spinning board while hoping not to get hit by the knives. It turns out that the knife-throwing is somewhat of a natural 'gift' in the Stoker family, but Shelley's daughter Candy somehow did not get it. Candy would rather be a doctor, but her mother keeps pushing her to practice her act for the pageant.

In the meanwhile, Joy has found out what Earl plans to do to get the figurine. Because she really wants a hot tub, she reasons that Earl has to give her one if he does not succeed in getting the figurine. So she enters into the pageant herself, and because she has no daughter, she also enrolls her mother. The fact that her mother is already dead does not stop her, as the rules do not explicitely state that either the mother or daughter has to be alive. She and Darnell fill up an urn with cigarette ash (they accidentally leave a butt inside) and Joy enters the contest.

While practising for the act, Candy confesses to Earl that she does have the 'gift'; she knew it from a very early age, but she never told her mother, because she really wants to be a doctor instead of doing contests. Earl fears that losing the contest means he has to buy Joy a hot tub, which will cost him the majority of his price money, so he convinces the girl that there are already enough doctors in the world, and that she has to listen to her mother.

At the day of the contest, Earl sees that Joy is doing a bikini act (with the urn simply standing on a pedestal). In order to have a better chance, he asks why Shelly is not in bikini as well, but it appears that she has a scar from a c-section ""because someone couldn't find her way out of mommy"". While preparing for the act, Earl realizes that he is knowingly destroying a young girl's dream, if he forces Candy to go through with the act. She is on hist list now, so he tells her to hit him with a knife in a harmless place, which will cause them to lose the pageant and give Candy the opportunity to follow her dream of becoming a doctor (he will need one anyway afterwards if Candy hits him). During the act, Candy hits Earl in the leg, and Joy wins the contest. She immediately demands a hot tub from him, but Earl realizes that he not only gave Joy her figurine back, he also helped her fulfill her dream of winning the contest and made her feel like a little girl again. So he has no reservations whatsoever to cross Joy from his list."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0654809/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,"Earl talks Joy into letting him set up a new wedding with Darnell after ruining their last one, but he only makes things worse by sleeping with her before the wedding.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Marc Buckland'],[''],[],"['dancing alone', 'smile', 'man wears an eye patch', 'eye patch', 'breakdancing', 'vixen', 'tackled', 'rehearsal lunch', 'bare chested male', 'making out', 'wedding planning', 'broken nose', 'reference to bruce willis', 'reference to demi moore', 'soccer game', 'outdoor wedding', 'garden hose', 'birthday', 'delivering mail', 'helium balloon', 'number 261', 'turtle']",[],"Earl has bought a large number of balloons, because a new item has recently been added to his list: Ruined Joy's Wedding. While Earl was working on his list, Joy and Crab Man had planned their wedding ceremony, and send a letter of invitation to Randy, but not to Earl. The invitation even specifically mentioned that Randy could bring any guest but Earl. To make even more sure that Earl wouldn't come, Joy had planned the wedding right on his birthday, and she had also hired the DJ who Earl always hires for the occassion.

On the day of the wedding, a cheap, improvised ceremony was planned in the park: Crabman had to sit on a park bench all morning to keep it reserved; Joy had to do her make-up in the park restrooms; Patty the Daytime Hooker doubled as maid of honor; and there was even a soccer game constantly interrupting the ceremony. Crabman's mother and sister had also shown up for the occassion. At the same time, Earl was solitarily celebrating his birthday in the Crab Shack, getting drunk, until he decided to go to the wedding anyway (and because he wanted to do his famous breakdance). Earl's appearance and state of intoxication not only spoiled the ceremony; in a failed attempt to kick back a stray soccer ball, Earl inadvertantly aimed it straight at Joy's head, which forced her to wear a nose brace for some time.

Trying to make amends, Earl arrives with the balloons. He also hopes that he can have the same relationship with Joy and Crabman as Bruce Willis has with Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher. Joy, however, isn't interested in another wedding. But when Earl reveals his plans to make it a proper and dignified ceremony this time (he has even created a home-made ornament for the occassion) she is finally persuaded

Joy and Earl get set to organize the second wedding, which begins with a proper wedding dress for the bride. But while shopping, the two have so much fun that it spontaneously ignites a spark of romance between them. They finally end up kissing and making love at Earl's motel (with a terrified Randy still on the bed).

The next day, Joy has snuck out of the motel. Earl goes to her home to talk about what happened, but not suprisingly, Joy accuses him of seducing her on purpose. Earl tells her he needs to confess this transgression to Crabman, but Joy refuses, reminding Earl that Darnell (Crabman) can be insanely jealous (she also tries to convince him that Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have regular sex together without Ashton Kutcher knowing). Earl is determined to come clean anyway, since Darnell is on his list now, but Joy finally convinces him that this will, again, ruin her wedding, so that he can never cross her off the list.

One day before the wedding, there is a rehearsel lunch (a simplified rehearsal dinner, since several of the guests have court-mandated curfews). Earl is in severe doubt, because he does not want to lie to Crabman, with whom he has such precious memories (although a montage of these ""memories"" involves little more than the two always greeting each other). Finally, Earl tells joy that he cannot lie anymore, and Joy unwillingly concedes, but she wants to be the one to tell Crabman. However, out of Earl's sight, she actually tells Darnell that Earl slept with Darnell's mother. Crabman is enraged, and beats up Earl who still thinks that Joy has told Crabman the truth (with arguments like 'I have slept with her so many times'!, which further enrages Crabman). When Earl finally says that Darnell has also slept with 'her', both men understand that they have been put up against each other by Joy. However, Crabmans realization that Joy has cheated on him makes him miserable, and he retreats into a children's playhouse. Earl promisses to make things up. He goes into the playhouse as well, where Darnell confesses not to be mad with him anymore; after all, he had a relationship with Joy when she was still married to Earl as well. Earl convinces Crabman that Joy really loves him, because of the expression on her face when he left the lunch: it was a genuine expression of fear over losing him.

Crabman forgives Earl and Joy and they have their dream wedding at last. While family pictures are made, Crabman insists that Earl be in the picture as well, over Joy's protests. Earl finally thinks that his dream about a relationship like Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher has come true. However, while posing for the picture, Joy hisses to him that she hopes he gets nut cancer, to which he expresses his hope that she will not kiss her illegitimate children with that mouth. Finally, Earl gets the chance to do his famous breakdancing during the afterparty."

Unfortunately, an officer points out to him that this is an offense, so he gets a ticket himself. Because he cannot produce his licence (which Joy had kept for herself in case she could abuse it in some twisted way), he has to appear in court.

Arriving at the courthouse, Earl recognizes another person on his list: a bitter woman called Gwen, who works there as an sketch artist. She cannot get through the metal detector without setting it off, because of several metal bullets in her buttocks. Earl realizes why Karma has brought him there: he had accidentally hit Gwen in the buttocks with his BB gun when they were children (he had a crush on her and was aiming for her boyfriend). It turns out that this incident caused her to have a fall out with her alcoholic father, who took sides with young Earl instead of her. This led to an argument and the father leaving her and her Mom two weeks later.

Earl tells Gwen about his list, and his intention to fix the relationship between her and her father, so that he can cross Gwen off his list. Gwen states that she has not talked with the man since, and she forgives Earl for the shooting. She assures Earl that the incident that followed was not his fault; her father would have left one day anyway, the BB gun incident was just the straw that broke the camels back. Earl still feels guilty for setting these vents in motion, and is adamant to get the two to reconcile in order to cross Gwen off the list.

He and Randy track Gwen's dad down, but the man appears to be a totally unreasonable and unintelligible drunk. Earl tries to get him to sober up by putting him inside his trailer and having Randy guard all the booze outside, while he brings Gwen over. Unfortunately, Gwen is adamant not to speak with her father ever again and refuses to come, and when Earl returns, he finds that Randy has been tricked by Gwen's dad, who has reclaimed all of his booze back inside. In a desperate final attempt, Earl boards up the trailer, locking Gwen's dad inside, and drives the trailer all the way to the courthouse. When Gwen comes out and sees her dad (who is so drunk that he cannot even get his own pants on), she finally realizes that the man is just a pathetic drunk, and that she has been mad at him all those years for nothing. She has no desire to speak to him, but she is a better person now that she can't be mad at him anymore, so she gives Earl permission to cross her off his list.

Gwen's dad makes an escape attempt when Randy locks him into Earl's car with the keys still inside, but Earl assures Randy that he won't get far, as the man does not know to put his foot over the hole in the floor of the car to keep the exhaust gasses out."

Instead of helping, all of the sorority sisters but Amy walk out to go dance to the song ""Waterfalls"" by TLC. When the sisters come back, they are shocked to find Sophia dead.

In the present day, it's a new school cycle at Wallace University, but this year Dean Cathy Munsch won't let Kappa have the same system that it currently carries. The dean asks for Chanel Oberlin, the now-president of Kappa and the meanest girl of the university, to go to her office. There, Cathy tells Chanel that she thinks that she was the one who injured the previous Kappa president, Melanie Dorkess, but Chanel denies it (Red Devil did it). Munsch says that she's going to take Kappa down this year, starting by revoking their charter. Just then, Gigi Caldwell, president of the national chapter of Kappa Kappa Tau and a lawyer, walks in and says that she's not allowed to revoke their charter. Chanel then threatens Cathy and exits. The dean then tells Gigi that Kappa won't have it easy this year and Gigi tells Cathy she has a suggestion.

It's Grace Gardner's first day at college, and her father, Wes takes her in his car to the university. It is revealed that Grace's mom died when she was two. Wes begs Grace to not join a sorority, but she wants to feel closer to her mother who was part of Kappa. She convinces her roommate and new best friend Zayday to join to the Kappa sorority with her.

At the ""Rush Kappa"" party, Cathy makes the announcement that Kappa will be required to accept anyone who wants to become a pledge. Shocked at the news, everybody leaves except for a few. Chanel is beyond mad to see the new pledges left. She then introduces Hester, Tiffany, and Sam. Dean Munsch then introduces The Chanels to Jennifer, another new pledge who terrifies Chanel with her candle vlogging hobby.

The next day, Chanel goes to talk with her boyfriend Chad Radwell, president of the Dickie Dollar Scholars fraternity, about what happened at the party. He tells her that he is going to break up with her if her popularity decreases for having misfits in her sorority, and his best friend Boone supports his decision. This makes Chanel to make plan to scare the other girls so they quit the Kappa sorority.

Chanel tells Kappa's housekeeper Ms. Bean that she will burn Ms. Bean's face off by drowning her in a fryer. Chanel then explains that it won't be for real, only pretend and that oil won't be hot because they will turn off the machine. At a coffee shop at the campus, Pete Martinez, the barista, meets Grace and warns her about Kappa, saying that it's a dangerous house. Chanel interrupts their conversation and says to Grace that Pete got a little too obsessed with her last year and that she had to get a restraining order against him. Pete explains that he was a freshman with a huge crush on her, then accuses Chanel of intentionally leading him on.

After Chanel #2, Chanel #3, and Chanel #5 find a ""creepy collage"" of Chanel's face in Ms. Bean's room, Chanel decides that it's time to scare the pledges. Unaware that the fryer's on, Chanel burns Ms. Bean's face for real, causing her death. Everyone starts screaming and Grace storms out of the kitchen, intending to call the police. Chanel blackmails the other girls, except Zayday, with a trip to Cancun, Mexico, to say that Grace was the one who killed Ms. Bean if she says a word to the police. The girls then hide the dead body in a freezer, unaware that Pete is following and tracing them.

Dean Munsch is in bed with Chad after having sex, and she explains that she blackmailed him to have sex with her with academic probation and confesses that her husband left her for a 19-year-old two years ago. Chad says that he is in love with her, but she kicks him out of the room.

Grace later confesses to Pete what Chanel did, but Pete already admits that he saw them take the body and that he is the reporter of the school newspaper The Sentinel. Grace offers to be his eyes and ears inside the house so they can destroy Chanel and expose what she did. They then go to the freezer to examine the body, however Chanel and her boyfriend Chad Radwell arrive and discover the body is missing.

The Chanels are having a blood oath to promise to not say what they witnessed earlier, but Chanel #2 says she can't stay silent and goes to her room to pack her things and leave the university, but she is interrupted by Red Devil and becomes her first victim, stabbing her in the shoulder and back head. After the other Chanels discover the body, they decide to keep the body in that room until they know what to do with it.

The ""Hell Week"" at Kappa house begins, a week where the new pledges will prove that they are Kappa worthy by submitting themselves in terrible tasks made by The Chanels. Before their first task, Chanel and Grace leave to take a coffee to make peace between them, but nothing gets solved ultimately. Meanwhile, Chanel #3 and Chanel #5 bury the girls up to the head in the house garden and leave them alone so they can spend the night buried, but while the Chanel #3 and #5 are away, Tiffany gets decapitated by the Red Devil in a lawn mower, leaving the other girls screaming horrified."

The Chanels still don't know what to do with Chanel #2's body, who was killed by Red Devil in the previous episode. After Hester suggests to put her in food processor or boning her, Chanel decides to put the body in the same freezer where they put Ms. Bean's body. Hester promises to keep the secret of #2's death.

Grace goes to the house basement, where she founds a mysterious locked door and tries to open it. Chanel #5 catches her and says that only Chanel has the key of that door. Grace tells about the secret door to Pete, who says that people has been whispering for years that the Kappa house has a really dark secret. This makes him think that Dean Munsch's office may have some archives that can explain that secret, so they both think at the same time that they will have to break in.

They start kissing passionately but Grace stops him, saying that they can't kiss if there is a killer in the campus of Wallace University. They both agree that she will break into that secret door at Kappa house and he will break into the dean's office.

Media attention descends on Wallace University after the murder of a Kappa pledge, so Cathy's job is in risk. This problem increases when Grace's father, Wes Gardner, wants unsubscribe Grace from the school, because he fears that something could happen to her. A really flirty Munsch convinces him to keep his daughter at school, but Wes demands to be hired as a professor so that he can keep an eye on her. She says that she finds good parenting attractive.

After Grace breaks into the secret room at basement of the Kappa house, Chanel interrumpts her and tells her that room keeps Kappa's darkest secrest. Chanel proceeds to tell that a legend says 20 years ago a girl died in a bathtub that is in that basement, but was before in one of the bathrooms, giving birth. She also reveals that Cathy knew about the story but decided to cover it up so no one could find out. After Chanel leaves, Grace asks herself who the baby is. After having sex, Chanel realizes that her boyfriend Chad doesn't really love her so breaks up ith him. He return to his dormitory, with his roommate Boone.

Boone says that he is scared for the killer, so Chad, as his best friend, let him sleep with him, but clarifies that Boone will not try touch him at night like past times and will respect Chad's heterosexuality. Chanel, regretful, enters to the room to she can fix her relationship with Chad, but walks in on them sharing a bed together and believes that Chad is gay. After he explains the situation, that Boone was scared and nobody knows that he, Boone, is gay, Chad breaks up with her for being an ""spoiled, homophobic little girl.""

Pete breaks into Munsch's office, and finds an archive with some names that can be related with Kappa's past, so he writes them on a sheet. Unaware that Red Devil is behind him, the killer hits him in the head. Pete wakes up tied outside of building with a note that says ""MYOB"" (Mind Your Own Business). At his dormitory, Grace tells him about the Kappa legend and he, shirtless, shows her the names that he wrote on the sheet. Grace opens the closet to give him something to put on, but discovers the Red Devil costume, which happens to be the mascot of the university. Grace freaks out and asks Pete about his age, he answers that he will turn 20 in a month. Scares, Grace leaves the room because that is the exact same year that the baby would have, and thinks that Pete might be the killer.

Boone goes to talk to The Chanels to tell Chanel that there is no need for her to tell everyone about his sexuality, because he wants to come out in his own way soon. He proposes that after he comes out, they accept him in Kappa, and Chanel likes the idea because that would give her a good reputation as the first girl who accepts a gay man in his sorority. Chanel #5 disagrees, but Boone leaves knowing that they will consider his idea.

At night, after Denise and her friend Shondell fall asleep outside of the Kappa house and Gigi goes on a date with Grace's father, Chanel survives an attack by the Red Devil.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529483/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Lotta Crabtree is hired by mining tycoon Alpheus Troy to lure one of the Cartwrights into town and hold him for ransom in exchange for Ponderosa timber rights.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Edward Ludwig'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"This pilot episode introduces Ben Cartwright and his three sons, Adam, ""Hoss"", and Little Joe. Ben (Lorne Green), a big man with silver hair, is a widower three times over. He loves the 1000 square miles of his ranch, the Ponderosa. They run cattle, raise horses, and cut timber. They own the largest ranch in Nevada in 1859. His eldest son, Adam (Pernell Roberts), was born to Ben's first wife, the daughter of a New England sea captain. Adam, like his father, has a strong work ethic and an even stronger sense of duty and justice. Hoss (Dan Blocker) is the biggest of the family. He's the son from Ben's second wife, a Swedish woman. Hoss isn't his given name, it's just what everyone calls him. Hoss is a gentle and sensitive man and is more comfortable around animals than people. Little Joe (Michael Landon), Ben's youngest, was born to Ben's third wife, Felicia (though in later episodes she's known as Marie.) His mother was from New Orleans. Joe has an exuberance for life and the fun of living it.

They all live on their ranch near the new silver mining town, Virginia City. Virginia City sprang up practically over night when gold, then silver was found in what became known as the Comstock Lode. Ben has little to do with mining. He respects the land and will do nothing that can't be easily replaced. Which leads to the premise of this episode.

The mine owners need millions of feet of timber to dig deeper and deeper for the ore and Ben won't sell. He has thousands of acres of Ponderosa pine, but believes too much logging will ruin the land. The mine owners hire renowned actress Lotta Crabtree (Yvonne DeCarlo) to lure one of the Cartwright boys into town where he can be held hostage until Ben agrees to sell them lumber.

The Cartwrights spot a carriage barreling across the Ponderosa and follow after it to investigate. The carriage has lost a wheel and come to a halt. The boys pull guns on the driver and demand to know what he's doing on their land. A beautiful woman, Lotta Crabtree, steps out of the carriage and refuses to cower. She orders them to put their guns away. Hoss and Joe do, but Adam keeps his out. When she points that out to him, he merely says, ""I might still intend to use it."" Ben tells him to put it up thinking maybe the coach did accidently stray onto the Ponderosa. They offer to help fix the wheel and Ben tells Joe to take Lotta back to the house for a cool drink. Joe, who's been admiring the lady's beauty, is happy to oblige. However, Adam jumps down first and is the one to lift the woman onto Joe's horse.

Once the wagon is fixed, the Cartwrights wonder what's taking Joe and Lotta so long. Their Chinese cook, Hop Sing (Victor Sen Yung) rides up in the buckboard and is upset that everyone missed lunch. Hoss is more upset than Hop Sing as meals are something he doesn't like to miss. But when Hop Sing says Joe took the lovely lady back to Virginia City, everyone knows there's going to be trouble. Adam pulls his gun and holds it on the driver. He threatens the driver, Ned, with one minute to tell what he knows. Ned says he was hired to drive the lady around these hills. Ben demands to know if it was Alpheus Troy who hired him. Ned admits it was. Ben says they'll gather there forces and if the three of them aren't back by dawn, their men are to ride in behind them.

Joe escorts Lotta into town and asks if he can see her after her performance. She doesn't disagree.

Joe takes his horse over to the Chinese section of town and meets Hop Sing's father, Hop Ling (Sammee Tong) who runs a laundry. He takes a rose from Hop Ling's bush and heads back to town.

Joe attends Lotta's performance (Yvonne DeCarlo - performing - ""All other awnsers were no"") and tosses the rose to her when she's done. Then he visits her in her hotel room. He tries to make a few moves on her, but she manages to politely sidestep them. Joe gets the message and they just talk. She's been to New Orleans, which is where Joe's mother was born, and he loves to hear about it. Lotta looks out the window and sees two men she recognizes and realizes they're coming for Joe. She locks the door and begs to know why Ben won't sell his trees. Joe's now very suspicious and says, ""Without those trees we can't keep the land going. Are you expecting any visitors ma'am?"" She looks guiltily away.

The Cartwrights ride to town and demand the return of Little Joe, but Alpheus Troy (George Macready) refuses to say where Joe is. He tells Ben to take it up with his associate. The associate is a gunfighter named Langford Poole (Christopher Dark). Adam insists that Poole fight him and not Ben. They square off and Poole draws. Adam is faster and wounds Poole in the arm. Still Troy won't say where Joe is. Adam suspects Lotta is involved and marches over to her hotel.

The two men push their way into Lotta's hotel room. Joe, sitting casually in a chair, merely tells them that their appearance wasn't entirely unexpected. After a brief fight, Joe escapes out the window and takes refuge in Hop Ling's laundry. The two men have followed and proceed to tear China town apart looking for him. This upsets the residents and they attack the men. Joe comes out of the laundry and joins the fight with an enthusiastic ""Yahoo!""

Meanwhile, Adam has arrived at Lotta's hotel room and accuses her of working with Alpheus. She claims it was all a game and she didn't know they meant to hurt Little Joe. Adam's angry and grabs her wrist and twists. She says he's hurting her. Adam doesn't back down, ""I'll break it, now where's the kid?"" She says sincerely that Adam doesn't understand. He pushes her away in frustration. She sadly says that Adam doesn't think much of her. He's still mad and says sarcastically that she did her job very well luring a young kid to his death. She again insists she didn't know they'd hurt him and she thought of it as a game. He doesn't believe her. ""Next time, Miss Crabtree, pick on a man, not a boy,"" he says angrily and storms out.

Adam returns to the saloon and reports that he didn't find Joe, but his horse is still in the livery. Poole is still there with Troy, so the Cartwrights leave to continue the search, but don't turn their backs on the men.

At sun up they are riding down the main street when they hear music coming from a restaurant. They dismount and go in to find Joe dancing with Lotta as a man plays the harmonica. After his sigh of relief at finding Joe alive and well, Ben yells at Joe, ""Is this what you've been doing all night?!"" Joe says he was just getting started. Ben orders him out. Joe scampers away trying to avoid getting a swat from Ben as he squeezes by. Ben and Hoss notice that Adam hasn't taken his eyes of Lotta. As Hoss turns to follow Joe out he gives Adam a nudge towards her. With Ben, Hoss and Joe outside, Adam steps up to Lotta and gives her a kiss. With a smile he turns and leaves."

The lack of their native food causes the Paiutes to steal Ponderosa beef. The Cartwrights decide to sell their beef directly to the miners, hoping to ease the tensions with the Paiutes and keep their herd from being rustled. This interferes with Burdette's business plan and he tells Thorne to stop the beef from arriving in Virginia City. Thorne and his men accomplish this by dressing up as Indians and killing all but one miner. Harris is left alive to tell everyone it was the Paiutes that ambushed them. Thorne then dresses a miner and kills Tukwa, one of the Cartwright ranch hands. An Indian war is imminent unless the Cartwrights can get to the bottom of this. They go to speak to Harris only to discover that he is too dazed to identify anyone and the only other person who knows Burdette is guilty, a saloon girl named Glory, has been kidnapped. They track Burdette and Thorne and their captive to the desert where a gunfight breaks out. Burdette, who never approved of the killing, refuses to return fire. As he and Glory try to escape from Thorne, Thorne shoots him in the back. Then Thorne uses Glory as a shield. Hoss tackles Thorne and fights him. Burdette, who isn't dead, gets an opportunity to shoot Thorne, killing him. Burdette then dies in Glory's arms. Adam laments that Burdette came looking for a bonanza and now he's dead. Glory says Burdette found it right before he died and that's better than not finding it at all."

One of the members of the party is McCall, a man they ran off their property earlier. The other members include McCall's fiance, Emily, and her brother (also his business partner) John Pennington. Ben is familiar with Pennington's work. They use hydraulic mining and it destroys the land by uprooting trees and removing top soil. Emily is sick and John says they're just trying to get her to the high country for her health. Ben is adamant that they leave. The next day, to ensure that the party goes, Ben has Hoss escort them off. As they make their way, McCall and one of his men, Krug, make plans to take Hoss. They've noticed his concern for the livestock and pretend to have a horse come up lame. When Hoss checks the animal, they knock him out. John and Emily are against this and they too find themselves captives of McCall. McCall kills the Cartwrights' foreman for guns and ammunition and dumps the body at the Ponderosa's front door. While they're gone, Hoss breaks free and, at John's urging to be left behind, Hoss escapes with Emily. The Cartwrights are now tracking McCall and his men who have also enlisted the help of local miners. Hoss and Emily have made their way some distance and see that Ben, Adam and Joe are about to walk into an ambush. He draws McCall's attention to himself and takes on the gang singlehandedly. He's doing well when the Cartwrights arrive and shoo everyone else off. Hoss is explaining things when he realizes Emily is very sick. They rush her back to the Ponderosa. She's dying and knows it. She asks her brother to take her back to San Francisco. She doesn't want to be a bother to anyone and she doesn't want Hoss to know how sick she is. Hoss makes arrangements for her to go with a wagontrain and tells her he'd like her to stay. He describes his favorite glade and says he'd like to take her there. She tells him to go there in the spring and she'll be there. She tells him she loves him, caresses his cheek, and leaves. Hoss can't believe it, he's getting married! He's so excited that he can't understand why no one else is excited too. Now that Emily's gone, they break the news to him. Hoss runs out of the house. Joe tries to follow to console his brother, but Ben stops him. Having lost three of his own wives, he tells Joe, "" For a while it's a hurt you have to bear alone."" Hoss spends his time alone by the water begging God to help him. Eventually, he returns to the Ponderosa. He still can't talk about it or explain things, but Ben understands and encourages him to go on by simply going back to work."

Mike Wilson and his brother Vern take two Bannock women captive. One of the women's husbands, Numta, finds Adam and tells him what happened. He and Adam are able to free the women and take them back to the Ponderosa. However, the other husband has gone to the Bannocks to enlist their help. In retaliation, the Bannock kill Vern and several unrelated settlers along the way. Mike escapes and hurries to Virginia City. He embellishes the story, blames the Paiute, but leaves out his involvement in the kidnapping. Virginia City residents are ready to fight back. Ben, having heard all this, can't believe it and tries to get a town leader, Bill Stewart, to talk sense into these men. Bill is less concerned, but agrees to talk to the men in the morning. Ben returns home to learn the true story from Adam. The next day, former Army Major Ormsby has rallied his ""troops"". Significantly fewer residents are willing to fight in the light of day and sober. Bill and Ben convince them to parley with Paiutes. The Paiutes know they're coming and Winnemucca's son, Young Wolf, wants to fight. But Winnemucca knows that if Ben is there it is to talk. However, when they meet up, Mike wants to fight and he shoots at the Paiutes. In the scuffle, Adam is captured and Ben knocked out. Only a handful of men return to Virginia City and Ben believes Adam is dead. Back in the Paiute camp, Young Wolf would like to kill his old friend, Adam, but Winnemucca prevents it. In Virginia City, Ben is relieved to learn that Adam is still alive, but Mike claims Adam went willingly with the Paiutes. Winnemucca meets with Ben and tells him that if the white man returns with the Army, then many, including Adam, will die. Adam, who's present, tells Ben to ride to the Bannock and convince Ring Nose to tell the truth.

He knows he may die for killing the whites, but he can't allow the Paiute to suffer for his actions. They ride hard to reach the marching army before the army reaches the Paiutes. Unfortunately, they don't get there in time. Young Wolf has Adam off to the side with orders to kill him first. But Adam has freed his tied hands and escapes. Young Wolf is right behind him when Mike shoots him. The battle begins. Adam takes Young Wolf's knife and turns to find Mike taking aim on him. He throws the knife and kills Mike. Ben and Joe arrive and after checking on Adam intend to go stop the army. But the battle is already over. Men on both sides lie dead. The truth comes out and they all know the loss was all for nothing. Winnemucca sits mourning his son and all his Paiute sons. The army marches silently past, dipping their flag in respect."

The Cartwrights have also discovered men surveying on their property.

Sam has also decided that he wants to write meaningful articles and conspires with the Cartwrights to bring down the judge. His hilarious articles make Billington a laughingstock.

The Cartwrights are just returning from having cut down a Ponderosa Pine (and planted a new one in its place) when they see a man on a mule being chased by four men on horseback. They don't know what's going on, but they don't like the odds and decide to help the lone man out. They take cover lower on the mountain and using Hoss' buffalo gun take turns shooting at the four men. Each of the Cartwrights hit their mark (which isn't the four men, but their canteen, hat, rifle and an arm.) The four men can't see who's shooting at them and take off. Henry doesn't know where the help is coming from, but he's happy to have it.

The Cartwrights meet up with Henry and they ask why he was run out of California. Henry denies that he, Henry T.P. Comstock, was ever claim jumping, may God strike him dead if he did. Joe has his rifle casually resting on his shoulder and pulls the trigger for an explosive boom. Henry tells God he didn't mean right now. The Cartwrights all laugh and invite Henry back to the Ponderosa for dinner.

At dinner, Henry tells some wild stories, but he does say he knows Ben's old friend, John Sutter. Ben would like to hear news of him and Henry keeps avoiding answering. Finally, Ben calls an end to dinner and insists on hearing about Sutter. Henry admits Sutter isn't the man he once was. This only confirms what Ben already heard.

The boys have plans for the evening. Adam's going to the saw mill and asks if Henry would like a job. That's not the kind of work Henry does, so he declines. He claims he's a merchant, buying or selling as the situation requires. Ben just wants to make sure Henry isn't interested in panning for gold, not on his Ponderosa. He saw what gold did to John Sutter's land and he won't have it on his. Henry's intrigued to hear that they've found gold at the Washoe Diggings and thinks he might go down there. Hoss thinks he better tag along to make sure Henry doesn't get into any trouble. Joe wants to go to Dutchman Pete's for the weekly dance. Ben's surprised they even have women to dance with down at the diggings. Joe says they're laundry women and Hoss adds that they're all big boned, but they can dance. Joe says he wishes he could find a pretty woman to take to the dance. Suddenly he has an idea and he and Hoss leave. Hoss to follow Henry, Joe to find a pretty woman. Adam heads off to work.

Joe's idea of a pretty woman is Chief Winnemucca's young daughter, Saratuchi (Joanne Sages). He's brought some pretty turquoise material and, after talking with the chief (Bruce Gordon), offers it to Sara and asks her to the dance. ""But don't tell Chiefy.""

Hoss follows Henry to the miners who are placer mining, running water through the soil looking for gold. They find bits here and there, but mostly the equipment just gets mucked up with ""this darn blue stuff!"" Henry sees an opportunity. He asks two miners if they've filed a claim, because otherwise they're tresspassing on his land. Despite Hoss' whispering that Henry can't do that, Henry proceeds and a fight breaks out. Hoss gets pulled into it and Henry just saunters away to find another miner. He offers the man $17 for half his claim. The man, Pike (Charles Wagenheim) jumps at the chance because all he's finding is blue stuff. Now that they're partners, Henry whispers his plans into Pike's ear.

At the dance, Hoss is having a good time dancing with one of the women when Joe arrives with Sara in her new turquoise dress. He introduces her to the men who are all impressed with the pretty young girl. However, one man, Ol Virginny (Richard H. Cutting) thinks it was unwise to take Sara from her father and the Paiutes. Hoss agrees. But Joe doesn't care and escorts Sara out to dance. Several men offer Joe a deal to be allowed to dance with the slender young woman, but Joe always declines. Then he leads her to a corner and proceeds to kiss her. That's when Winnemucca and his braves arrive.

Joe's trying to talk himself out of a bad situation, facing an Indian chief and father's wrath, as well as an angry fiance. Sara was promised to Lean Knife (Abel Fernandez). Henry intervenes and insists on kissing the bride, even though Hoss tries to stop him. Lean Knife pulls his knife to cut Henry and Joe shoves Lean Knife to stop him. Lean Knife is about to turn on Joe when Ben and Adam arrive. Adam shoots the knife out of the Indian's hand. Ben assures Winnemucca that his son is young and foolish and he will be punished, but by him not the Paiutes. The Indians leave and everyone returns to dancing.

Suddenly, amongst the hoopla, Pike runs in yelling he struck gold. Everyone's excited, Henry looks smug, and the Cartwrights have retreated to a corner looking worried. Pike's going to show everyone where he found it, but Henry reminds him that it was on his claim. However, he's willing to sell shares for $100, cash on the barrel head, and he'll let them in on the Comstock Lode. Everyone starts throwing money at him as Pike is desperately trying to say he really did find gold. This isn't part of their plan. When Henry realizes he's practically giving away a real gold strike, he tries to give the money back. But everyone would rather keep their share and they all push out of Dutchman Pete's simultaneously. In the crush, Ol Virginny falls and breaks his whiskey bottle. He decides to use it as a christening and dubs the place Virginia. Henry says that's not right, it needs to be called Virginia City. The crowd cheers and head off for the diggings. The Cartwrights remain behind discouraged.

The Cartwrights conclude their story to the old prospector by telling him that Henry sold his claim for $11,000. He didn't know that all that blue stuff was silver and since then they've pulled out millions of dollars of silver from the Comstock Lode. The prospector says he doesn't feel so stupid then for buying the worthless deed. Ben thinks that the deed would be a nice memento of their old friend Henry Comstock and offers to buy it from the prospector for the $25 he paid for the land."

Regan, comes along seeking his former glory.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Adah Isaac Menken and her touring company come to Virginia City to perform the reknowned ""Mazeppa"". Intrigued by the picture of a naked woman riding horseback, Hoss and Joe are eager to see the show. They sneak out of the house and hurry to the performance only to be pulled out of line by their older brother. Fearing they're about to be reprimanded, Adam scolds them for being late and hopes the best seats aren't gone. During the show, Hoss is confused. The leading lady doesn't look anything like the woman on the poster. Joe says the woman on the poster is playing the part of a man, which just confuses Hoss more. After the show the boys go to the saloon and Hoss is dying to know if she really was naked when she rode out on the horse. After some gentle teasing, Adam assures him that she wore tights. Just then, Ben enters. The boys slump down in their seats hoping he won't notice them. Fortunately, he only has eyes for Adah. She suddenly sees someone she recognizes and begs Ben to take her back to the hotel. It was her ex-husband, once famous boxer, John Regan. They broke up because he abused her. He's followed her before looking for money. Ben hates how Regan treated her. Ben and Adah are old friends and Ben hopes it will be more. He spends all his time with Adah. The boys don't like that he's associating with an actress, but he assures them he can take care of himself. In an effort to prove to Ben what kind of a woman she is both Adam and Joe go to meet her. Neither is successful and both are, more or less, put in their place. Ben even proposes to Adah, he wants so much to protect her. But Regan has a pull on Adah and she can't deny him. Regan is jealous of Ben and takes the opportunity to get revenge by beating Joe up and nearly blinding him. Ben, Adam, and Hoss go to face Regan in the saloon. He refuses to fight with a gun but is willing to take Ben on with his fists. Hoss insists he fight Regan. Ben won't allow him, but Adam holds Ben back and Hoss takes on Regan. Since Regan is a professional boxer, he's beating Hoss. But Hoss won't quit. Finally, at Adam's urging, Hoss turns to wrestling rather than boxing and eventually defeats Regan. He's left lying on the floor when Adah appears. She rushes to him and promises him everything will be alright. The Cartwrights leave and Adam can't understand why a woman like Adah would be with a man like Regan. Ben's only explanation is that there are many kinds of love, as many as their are women."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529848/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,"Caught in the middle of a longtime family feud over a disputed piece of land, star-crossed lovers Joe Cartwright and Amy Bishop try to convince their stubborn fathers to resolve their differences as tension escalates into violence.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Several men cut down a tree on a piece of land known as the Truckee Strip. One of the Cartwright ranchhands, Trump (Charles Horvath), sees the work and hurries back to tell Ben. Two men approach the fallen tree. Jason Carter (S. John Launer) wonders why only one tree. Jessup (James Coburn) assures him that one is enough. Ben Cartwright and Luther Bishop will cause more thunder over this one tree than Carter's ever heard on that mountain.

Sure enough, after Trump tells the Cartwrights what happened, they're in hot pursuit of the lumbermen. Joe loses his man, but comes across a small pond with someone hiding behind a bush. He orders the person out and a young woman with big brown eyes steps out. She's only half dressed and holds her dress in front of her. Joe's surprised with what he's found, but merely dismounts and tells her she's tresspassing. She knows he must be a Cartwright and informs him that the land belongs to her father, Luther Bishop. She's Amy Bishop (Adrienne Hayes). Joe turns around so she can get dressed, but then she accidently steps on a frog and screams. Joe's immediately at her side. One look into her eyes and Joe is lost. He apologizes if he scared her when he rode up and asks if she visits the pond often. She says she does nearly every day at this time.

That evening at the Ponderosa, Ben tells Trump to post men on the Truckee Strip and let him know if anyone steps on his land. But he doesn't understand why Luther would do this. The court awarded the land to Ben and he thought Luther would follow the law. But if Luther wants to make an issue out of this again, Ben will be ready. Joe finally speaks up. ""For one tree? You're going to start fighting all over again for one tree?"" Ben says it isn't just the tree, it's the principle. Ben sends Trump to get the guards and Joe asks if it was worth it. Trump lost an eye in the last fight, was it worth it?

On the Concho, Luther Bishop's place, Luther's foreman Jessup poses the same question. Is Bishop going to fight over one tree. Luther Bishop (Carl Benton Reid) insists, despite the court order, that the land is his. Jessup agrees Luther has as much right to those trees as Ben and Luther could use the timber money. He thinks Luther ought to take Carter up on his offer to buy the timber. Luther says there are other ways to get money than do business with a man like Carter. Luther suspects Jessup is still angry over having lost a brother in the last fight. Jessup is.

Luther checks on Amy before she goes to bed and she too asks about the land. He swears the land is his and he'll fight for it til the day he dies. Not just for the land, but for the principle. He changes the subject and says Jessup told him that Amy was out to the creek. She says she doesn't like Jessup following her. Luther assures her it's only because he asked Jessup to keep an eye on her. What they don't know is that Jessup is outside her window watching her even now.

Joe meets Amy out at the pond again. She's glad to see him, but says her father wouldn't like it. Joe takes her hand, looks into her eyes, and says, ""We don't have to inherit the hates of our families."" She doesn't think they can escape it, but Joe says they can if they try. For the first time in his life he questioned his father and he did it because he met a girl with bare feet and big eyes.

Carter is upset with Jessup because the one tree did not get Luther to sell him the timber he needs. Jessup says he'll need to make a bigger play.

That night Jessup and two men steal three horses from the Ponderosa. They wear masks and ride the Ponderosa horses on to the Concho and kill one man, leaving a second (John Frederick) alive. Frederick sees the Ponderosa brand on the horses' flank.

Frederick tells Luther what happened. Jessup is ready to ride after the men, but Luther says they'll be long gone. He tells Jessup to inform Carter that he'll sell him that timber off the Truckee Strip. Jessup grins as Luther says, ""I hope Ben Cartwright just tries to stop me.""

As Hoss and Ben wonder how three of their horses got out last night, Trump rides up and says there's a whole lumber camp up on the strip. The Cartwrights are ready to ride, but Joe's not around. Hoss says Joe's out looking for strays. Ben thinks he's been out looking for strays a lot lately.

Joe's at the pond with Amy as she reads him Shakespeare. To his credit, he's actually listening. He says he could compare her eyes to the stars or her mouth to a rose, but when he looks at her he can't think of anything to say. They kiss. Joe says they need to tell their fathers, but Amy insists that it can never be, a Cartwright and a Bishop. Joe asks, if their fathers won't let them be together, will she go away with him and marry him. They kiss again and Jessup rides by and sees them.

Ben, Adam, Hoss, and Trump ride into the lumbercamp. As Ben demands to know where Luther is, no one sees Trump sneak into a tent after a young Chinese man who held a knife. He's the cook for the camp. They don't realize anything is amiss until they hear a scream. Ben rushes into the tent to find Trump strangling the young man. Trump drops the boy and goes outside where Hoss keeps him. The young cook is dead and Ben orders that Trump be taken in to the sheriff. Trump won't go and attacks Ben. Hoss pulls him off and they fight. Joe rides up in time to see Hoss win.

The cook's body is brought out and Joe takes it. Adam tries to explain that it wasn't Ben's fault, but only Joe seems truly upset about the death. He wants to know what Ben's going to do about it. Ben says they're taking Trump in to the sheriff. Joe can't believe they don't understand. ""All you care about is that there's been a killing and somebody's got to pay for that killing."" He wants to take the boy back to the Concho. He puts the body across his horse and Ben says Joe can't go. Joe's going anyway. Ben steps forward to stop him and Joe pulls his gun on Ben. ""Just put your gun down, Joe,"" Ben says quietly and asks why Joe needs to do this. Joe realizes what he's done and lowers his gun. He says the killing seems to rub off on people, he pulled a gun on his own father. But he still has to take the body back. Ben lets him go. Adam's worried that Joe will be shot the minute he sets foot on the Concho, but Ben says Joe needs to be trusted. He's got something he needs to figure out on his own.

Joe brings the young man back and is met by Jessup who shoots at him. Luther makes Jessup stop and Joe dismounts. He admits that a Cartwright man killed the cook, but it wasn't Ben's doing. Luther says Ponderosa men killed a Concho man last night. Joe says it couldn't be, Ben's always fought out in the open. Luther helps the boy's father carry the body away. When he's gone, Jessup reminds Joe that his brother was killed on the strip. Joe reminds him that it was a fair fight. Jessup warns Joe to stay away from Amy. Joe returns the threat saying if Jessup goes near Amy, Jessup will have his chance against Joe. Jessup goes for his gun, but Joe is faster. Amy rushes out and stands in front of Joe. Luther returns and sends Jessup away and Amy back in the house. He warns Joe to stay away from Amy. Joe mounts up, but says it'll be harder than that to keep them apart.

Joe is very late getting home and Ben is worried. But when Joe finally comes home, he can't say what he wants to say. He asks if the land means so much to Ben. Ben says it means a lot, but it's not his whole life. He asks Joe what's wrong and Joe finally says he meet a girl named Amy Bishop. Now Ben understands what's been bothering Joe. He promises Joe that he'd never hold his land above his sons. Joe says he wishes Luther felt that way. He also mentions the Concho man killed by a Ponderosa man. Ben says they have a lot to talk to Luther about.

The next day Ben and Joe ride into the lumber camp. Jessup sees them and sneaks away. Ben says the men who killed the Concho man were riding stolen Ponderosa horses. Luther accuses him of lying. Ben, like Joe said earlier, always fights in the open. Luther also questions Joe and Amy's relationship. Ben said he let his boy decide, why doesn't Luther let Amy decide. Luther's confident Amy will choose him and tells Joe he can go get her and bring her back.

Jessup walks into the house and tells Amy that the feud has started again and that Luther won't let Amy and Joe be together. Amy thinks her father will once he gets to know Joe. Jessup says Joe won't get the chance. He's waited a long time for Amy to grow up and he's not letting some Cartwright come in and take her. She doesn't want anything to do with him and he tries to trap her. She escapes and runs to the barn. He's right behind her.

Joe arrives and when he hears a scream from the barn, he rushes in. He finds Jessup molesting Amy. Jessup is unarmed, so Joe takes off his gun and they fight. They use fists, chains, whips, whatever they can find. Jessup grabs a pitchfork and throws it at Joe. He ducks away. Jessup gets Joe's gun and starts shooting at Joe who's hiding in a stable. When Jessup comes around the corner to shoot him, Joe stabs him in the chest with a pole. Jessup dies. Joe goes to check on Amy only to discover she was stabbed in the chest by the pitchfork.

The doctor comes out of Amy's room and sadly reports that he did everything he could. He says Amy wants to see Joe. This saddens Luther, but Joe hurries in and kneels at her side. She tells him the doctor told her she'd be fine. He says Ben gave them the piece of land with the pond so she can wade whenever she wants. She starts to talk about the house they'll have, but stops midsentence. Joe is heartbroken and drops his face to the bed in tears.

When Joe leaves the room he doesn't look at anyone, but merely says, ""She said it could never be, a Cartwright and a Bishop."" Then he walks out followed by his family."

The longer they take to catch them, the more whipped into a lynching party they become, much to the liking of the grieving widower.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Three men, Blackie, Kirk, and Schuster, ride up to a cabin. Blackie asks for supplies. The woman is hesitant, but says she'll get some. While Kirk and Schuster water the horses, Blackie attacks and kills the woman. He runs. Schuster and Kirk had nothing to do with it, but don't want to be caught either, so they all run.

When Flint Johnson and his son, Billy, bring Mrs. Johnson's body to town, Flint says a prospector saw three men riding away. He wants to go after the men. The sheriff's away and the deputy, Jeb, asks Adam and Joe to join them on the posse. They're reluctant, but Jeb begs and Adam agrees. ""Paiute"" Scroggs will be their tracker. Adam isn't convinced the three men had anything to do with the killing and is going along to make sure Flint doesn't do something he'll regret.

""Paiute"" Scroggs tracks the men and realizes they're headed for dry country. He thinks they should stop at McSween's Tavern before continuing, they can load up there. Flint doesn't want to lose time, but Scroggs assures him that the men will tire and the posse will catch them. Flint asks Adam for his opinion. Adam says the posse will be hard enough to control and even worse if they get liquored up at the tavern. Flint decides to go to the tavern.

Most of the men are enjoying themselves at McSween's, but Billy doesn't like it and Adam and Joe don't even go in.

The next morning, Adam insists Jeb take control of the posse instead of letting Scroggs and Flint run it. Jeb doesn't know what to do and says Scroggs has lots of experience with posses. Adam says Scroggs has lots of experience with lynching parties. Jeb meekly shrugs and tells Jeb. Jeb challenges Adam and Joe. Joe says they're making sure the posse stays legal. Scroggs threatens Adam, but he and Joe are faster to draw and Scroggs backs down. But now the lines are drawn.

The three men have reached the desert and Kirk doesn't know why he's running. He didn't do anything. Blackie and Schuster say the posse won't wait long enough to hear it. But Kirk decides he's going back.

That night, as the posse makes camp, Scroggs begins telling the men that even if they catch the murderers, they might not hang. He's seen it happen before and sends a meaningful look over at Adam and Joe. He's starting to work them up to a lynch mob. As everyone sleeps, Joe asks Adam what they'll do if they the posse wants to hang the men when they're caught. Adam says they'll fight them if they have to. Joe doesn't like the idea of fighting friends. Adam reminds him that they don't know the men are the ones who killed Mrs. Johnson.

The next day, the posse's lost the trail, so they split up. Flint and Billy see a man riding toward them. The man, Kirk, says he's giving himself up. Billy tells him to drop his gun. As Kirk reaches for his gun to do that, Flint shoots him dead. He tells Billy that he's claiming self-defense and Billy will have to back him.

As Adam and Joe bury Kirk, Flint is anxious to keep going. Adam accuses him of killing Kirk intentionally. They separate from the posse. As the posse continues to track the remaining two men, Adam asks Joe if there's a short cut to the next watering spot. Joe says it's a rough ride, but there is. They take it.

Blackie and Schuster arrive at the watering hole, but as they move to the water, a shot rings out. Adam and Joe beat them there. Blackie and Schuster hide in a cabin, but there's a small shoot out as Adam and Joe move in. Blackie is wounded. When Adam and Joe come into the cabin, Schuster claims he didn't want to shoot the woman and he begs to be allowed to go get a drink. Adam lets him, but as soon as Schuster kneels at the pool, he's shot dead. The posse has arrived and Adam sees that it was Flint who did the shooting.

Flint demands the third man, but Adam says he's going to make sure Blackie lives to get a fair trial and he'll fight anyone who tries to stop him. The posse backs off a bit and a few of the men even quit the posse. In the cabin, Blackie thinks it's funny that Kirk and Schuster are dead and they didn't have anything to do with the killing, but Adam's going to make sure Blackie stays alive even though he did kill the woman. He doesn't think he'll hang though. There are no witnesses. Joe's worried that Blackie might be right and it'd be easier to let the posse have him. Adam tells him that it wouldn't be right. Joe knows, but he doesn't have to like it.

Scroggs convinces the posse that they can take the Cartwrights and hang Blackie like he deserves. Flint is all for it. He calls to Adam and claims he'll let Adam keep the prisoner. He wants to shake on it. When Adam goes out to shake his hand, Scroggs knocks Adam out. The posse rushes in, hits Joe, and takes Blackie out to hang. Blackie pleads for his life. Just as they're about to hang him, Joe fires a shot and warns them that he'll kill the first man who puts weight on the rope. He takes Blackie back and helps Adam up. More men quit the posse, including Jeb and Scroggs who realizes he won't get the hanging he wanted. Even Billy leaves despite his father's pleadings to get the man that killed Billy's mother. Only two young men remain with Flint.

Adam sees everyone leave and knows it's over. He and Joe take Blackie out of the cabin. Flint asks again for Blackie. Joe and Adam note that Flint's son left him, probably got tired of looking at a man who led a lynch mob. Finally, Flint gives up and Adam and Joe take Blackie back for a trial."

Defending the clerk and Hoss, Ben shoots one of the robbers, a brother in the Morgan gang. Ben is shot in return and the gang gets away.

Ben is badly wounded and the doctor doesn't think he should return to the Ponderosa, so Anne offers to let him stay at her place. She owes Ben and remembers what he did for her.

Half the town parades through Ben's room congratulating him on what he did and promising not to forget what they owe him. They assure him that the posse will get the rest of the Morgan gang. Ben isn't as confident, the Morgans are tough. After everyone leaves, Ben apologizes to Anne for the inconvenience. She reminds him that she owes Ben. Ben says there are others he could have stayed with. She doubts that. Her husband thought he had friends in town too, but they all turned their backs on him, all except Ben. They let a lawyer convince them to hang an innocent man and now her husband is dead and she's a saloon girl. She tells Ben not to depend on his ""friends.""

The posse falls into a trap at the Morgan camp and all are killed. An Indian brings the bodies back to Virginia City. There's a note attached saying the Morgans are coming at sundown for Ben. The lawyer, Tom Pryor, is now the town drunk (he's been blamed and blames himself for wrongly hanging Anne's husband) and he laughs when he sees how the town is now ready to hand Ben over rather than protect him.

Hoss doesn't really know what to do and Ben says they should allow the Morgans to come to town, but to be ready with a trap for them. Hoss says they can block off the side streets. Ben says once they're in, pull a rope across the street and stop them from getting out. Then they'll have the Morgans trapped and surrounded.

Hoss goes around town trying to recruit help, but everyone refuses. Some even blame Ben for bringing this on the town. The only one who agrees to help is Tom. Hoss is desperate and will take even the drunk lawyer. He starts building the barricades and he and Tom hide the rope that will hold the Morgans in. Tom's job will be to pull the rope when the gang has crossed it.

Ben has Anne bring him a gun. She comments sarcastically that he won't need it with all his friends around. Then sincerely tells him not to put his faith in the town. Ben says it's not misplaced faith. Hoss arrives with Tom. Despite the fact that he's the man that got her husband hanged, she lets him in. They manage to side step Ben's questions about the town's assistance saying things like, ""All that are willing are ready."" As Hoss leaves, Anne says Hoss can't fight the Morgans alone, he'll be killed. Hoss agrees, he probably will be.

As sundown draws nearer, Tom needs a drink to fortify himself. He goes to the saloon and sees most of the town there drowning their guilt and cowardice. Tom welcomes them to his world. He takes a bottle and gun and goes upstairs.

Hoss checks to see if Tom's ready, only to find the position empty. The doctor comes up and says he's not good with a gun, but he'll do what he can. Hoss tells him how and when to pull the rope.

The Morgans come. Ben doesn't know why there's no shooting. The rope should've been pulled and the town fighting the Morgans. The Morgans are confused by the lack of response as well. The rope gets pulled, but no one fires. Ben realizes that Hoss lied about the men and he's now out there alone. He has Anne help him up. Hoss gets a few shots out as he ducks around corners. Tom, from the window above the saloon shoots too. He's shot and falls out the window. Hoss is able to kill several members of the gang. Anne has gotten Ben outside. When she sees Tom lying in the street, she goes to him. He tells her to forget the hate and dies in her lap.

Finally, the eldest Morgan wants to face Ben alone. Hoss doesn't like the idea, but Ben agrees to meet Carl. It's a fair draw and despite Ben's wound, he wins. Now the town comes out, but they can't face Ben and he just scowls at them. Then ahe dmits to Hoss that he expected too much from them. Hoss reminds him that Tom and the doctor helped. Ben admits that there are those who do as much as they can and that makes up for the rest."

Amelia delivers the message, but notices what a pretty girl Sue Ellen has grown up to be. She thought she was always the beautiful one and in her day she could turn heads. Sue Ellen has heard this all before and barely listens as Amelia goes on about how to get things from men. But she warns Sue Ellen that she should stay away from Adam. He's not in her class. Sue Ellen is offended and suddenly realizes what her sister has turned her into. She doesn't want to become sister who's now a bitter woman that drinks.

Sue Ellen has been invited to dinner at the Ponderosa. She tells outrageous stories about how wealthy her father was in St. Louis and how they traveled the world and had many servants. Hoss and Joe are silent in their embarrassment of her lies. Ben is coldly polite. Adam doesn't seem to mind. Realizing she's making a fool of herself, Sue Ellen asks Adam to take her home.

When he drops her off at her house, Sue Ellen admits that none of what she said was true. Adam assures her that it doesn't matter what her father did for a living. He kisses her, but suddenly a shot rings out and Sue Ellen collapses in his arms. He sees a man shooting from across the street. He fires back and then chases after the shooter, passing Dixie as he goes.

In the jail, Jesse arrests Adam for murder. Dixie said that he saw Adam shoot Sue Ellen. Adam denies it and starts to take back his gun to go in search of the real killer. Jesse knocks him out and locks him up.

The Cartwrights come to bail Adam out, but Jesse won't do it. Ben is allowed to visit Adam though. He tells Adam that he's sorry about Sue Ellen. Adam doesn't understand why anyone would want to kill her. The other men in her life meant nothing to her. He tells Ben that he knows Sue Ellen didn't love him. He doesn't think she even knew what love was. He was trying to show her, to make up for her sister.

In the saloon, Dixie is regaling the patrons with his version of what happened. He's making it up as he goes along. When the crowd decides they ought to lynch Adam, Dixie hurries out. He passes Amelia, all decked out and made up, on her way in. She finds John Henry and joins him. He comments on her manner of grieving. She tells him that Adam didn't kill Sue Ellen, but she has some idea who might have. He refuses to be blackmailed because he knows that she hated her own sister. She had more reason to kill Sue Ellen than he did.

The Cartwrights drag Dixie into the sheriff's office and Ben makes him tell the truth. He saw a man shoot at both Sue Ellen and Adam, but he couldn't tell who it was. Ben thinks Jesse should release Adam, but Jesse says he's safer in jail. The crowd is talking lynching. Ben goes out to defend his son to the mob. Jesse gives Adam a small gun. He doesn't want to leave Adam unprotected, should the mob get through. Adam asks why he shouldn't just use the gun on Jesse now. Jesse knows Adam is smarter than that. If Adam were to escape, he'd wait til evening when there's only one guard. Adam asks what Jesse would do then. Jesse says he'd give Adam eight clear hours, but then he'd come after him. He says if he catches Adam, Adam will hang.

That evening, Adam holds the gun on the deputy and escapes. As soon as he's gotten his own gun back and goes out the front, he's shot at. The shooter gets away. Adam then goes to John Henry's and demands to know if he killed Sue Ellen. John says no, but Adam should talk to Amelia.

Amelia is in her room when a man enters. She sees him in her mirror and congratulates herself on realizing he killed her sister. And for that he's going to have to pay and pay and pay. Too late she realizes he isn't going to pay. He strangles her.

Adam has just gotten to the house when he hears Amelia scream. A scream that is suddenly cut short. He rushes inside to find Amelia dead on the floor and the killer gone out the window. Ben arrives and wants to know why Adam broke jail. Adam knows he didn't stand a chance there and had to find the real killer. Ben tells him that he has to turn himself back in. Jesse is gathering a posse. Adam is stunned. Jesse had promised him eight hours. He asks Ben to tell Jesse that he'll meet Jesse at Jesse's home.

Ben relays the message and reminds Jesse that they've been friends a long time. Jesse assures him that he'll be good to the boy.

Adam is waiting for Jesse in his room, sitting behind Jesse's desk. Adam asks if Jesse plans on shooting him for trying to escape. ""Something like that,"" Jesse admits. Adam tells him that things would've gone easier for Jesse, if he'd killed Adam outside the jail. That was Jesse's first mistake. The second was to tell him he had eight hours, but then formed a posse right away. Jesse goes for his gun, but Adam has had his out and hidden behind the desk all along. He shoots first. Jesse collapses just as a crowd comes into the room. Adam asks why he killed Sue Ellen. Jesse says he wasn't aiming at Sue Ellen. He liked Sue Ellen and she liked him, until Adam came along. He was aiming at Adam. Then he dies there on the floor."

They haven't had much luck and Hoss says it's time to return. They plan to pack out the next day.

That night, an Indian holds a knife on Joe. He wakes up and the two wrestle briefly. Coming to Joe's aid, Hoss leaps over the campfire. But in his haste he knocks in their supplies and ammo. Bullets start to fire in every direction. Hoss and Joe take cover behind trees, but the Indian just lays still on the ground. When the ""attack"" is over, they check on the Indian and discover that she's a pregnant woman who's due any day now. Joe wants to get her to a doctor as quickly as possible, but Hoss is afraid she'd die on the journey.

Joe goes looking for traces of her people, but discovers she was traveling alone and intentionally heading southeast. She's Shoshone and that would take her into Paiute country. The only thing they can figure is that she was heading to Virginia City for some reason.

With their supplies gone, Hoss has cooked wild beans which Joe can barely tolerate. When they try to feed the Indian woman (Chana Eden) she ignores them. She won't respond to any of their questions either. Hoss finally gets her to eat saying she needs to take care of the baby. To Joe, this means she understands English, but Hoss thinks she's just worried about the baby.

Hoss builds the woman a shelter while Joe attempts to find food. He doesn't have much luck. Despite the fact that they're clearly trying to help the woman, she still refuses to answer their questions. Joe's more worried about her having the baby because, as he tells her, ""what we don't know about delivering babies would scare you to death.""

Over the next several days, they manage to catch duck and rabbit to eat. Then finally, the woman goes into labor. After some initial panic, Hoss delivers a healthy baby boy and presents him to Joe to keep warm by the fire. When he returns to the woman, she asks, in perfect English, if her baby girl is perfect. Hoss, stunned at how well she speaks, says he's perfect, but he's a boy. She isn't happy to hear that which just confuses Hoss. When he returns to Joe, Joe announces that the baby has blue eyes. His father must be a white man.

Joe finds a Shoshone amulet. He thinks her people are around, but doesn't understand why they don't just attack. Hoss says the amulet could've been left months ago. Joe's getting angry with the woman because, even though she speaks English, she still refuses to speak to them. When she sees the amulet, she turns away in fear. Joe belives it's because her people have come for her. But Hoss says it's a war piece and it's forbidden for a Shoshone woman to even see it.

The weather turns worse and even though the woman's not ready to move, they have to get off the mountain. As they make their way down, Joe has the feeling they're being watched. That night Hoss takes first watch.

Hoss wakes up from dozing on his watch to find a Shoshone knife embedded in the tree he's leaning against. He wakes Joe and they know it's a warning. They still don't know why the Shoshone haven't just attacked, but go to wake the woman and keep moving. She's gone. She covered a log with her blanket to look like she was sleeping and left with the baby.

As she hurries down the mountainside, four Shoshone chase her. Hoss and Joe aren't far behind and start shooting. The Shoshone run off as the woman hides in the bushes. Ben (Lorne Greene) and Adam (Pernell Roberts) have been out looking for Hoss and Joe, since they're a week overdue, and hear the gunshots. They find Hoss and Joe who try feably to explain.

They've managed to get the woman back to the Ponderosa. Ben is angry that Hoss and Joe would interfere with the Shoshone. They defend themselves saying they couldn't just leave her. Hop Sing (Victor Sen Yung) comes down the stairs complaining that the next time they bring home a baby they should bring a laundry boy too. He doesn't have time for diapers.

In the woman's room, the doctor (Carlyle Mitchell) tells the Cartwrights that the baby, surprisingly, is fine. But the woman has a very high fever. When he's departed, the woman asks for her baby. Ben's concerned when he sees the pained look on her face.

Ben's staying up late that night, when Hop Sing rushes downstairs to say the woman needs help. He has Hop Sing send Adam for the doctor while he bathes the woman's face with cool towels. He asks her to please tell him who the father is so that he can send for him. She is silent and then dies quietly.

There's a knock at the door and Sumner Kyle (Raymond Bailey) demands to see Ben. Ben comes down and politely greets Sumner and his son, Jason (Steven Terrell), but he and Sumner are not friends. Sumner gets to the point. Jason is the Indian baby's father, as Ben must know, and he's wants the woman sent away. He'll pay for her silence. Ben tells him not to worry, the woman never revealed the father's name. Jason insists he was married to her in a Shoshone ceremony and still loves her. But, he had nothing to offer her that didn't belong to his father, including himself. He wants to see the woman. Ben says she's upstairs, but that she died. Sumner even tries to stop Jason from going then, but Ben holds him back.

The Cartwrights, Hop Sing, and Jason, bury the Indian woman. As they have a small funeral, the Shoshone arrive. One is chief in a full headdress. After the prayer, Jason asks to have his son. Ben tells him that they just buried the chief's only child, but the bloodline continues in the baby. Nothing will keep the chief from his grandson. Jason asks to have his baby and asks Ben to tell his father that he went home. Jason takes the baby and rides away with the Shoshone."

Read all,[],TV-G,Release date,['Lewis Allen'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Bonanza's ""The Outcast"" portrays a woman, Leta Malvet (Susan Oliver), who is ostracized by the town of Virginia City for the criminal acts of her father and brother, whose boots are shown hanging before a lynch mob for the crimes of their wearers in the opening scene. Then the map burns, featuring the then-newly shot sequence of the Cartwrights galloping towards us at Big Bear Lake, California.

The distraught Leta is taken in by Ben Cartwright to rest at Ponderosa for several days on the advice of the doctor. Leta's lover, Clay Renton (Jack Lord) pays a visit to Ponderosa to check up on Leta, much to the chagrin of Ben and Adam. While Adam voices his concerns to Ben about Clay's visit on account of his criminal past, ol' Hoss reserves judgement.

Ben gives Leta a carriage ride over to her house and assures her that the Cartwrights will help her in any way possible. She will need all the help she can get, because the townsfolk go out of their way to give her the snub job as she goes about her business in town. Leta has to choose between fleeing town to begin a new life elsewhere, free of the opprobrium of the townspeople, or to stay and tought it out.

She decides that she can make a living by continuing to sell the eggs from the chickens that she keeps to Harvey Bufford (Edward Platt) who runs a general store in town.

Clay waits inside for her as she enters her house and as he talks to Leta he suggests that she has been converted by Ben Cartwright. For her part, Leta never thought of herself as a bad person to start with and is puzzled by Clay's stance on the matter. Nevertheless, she is clearly in love with Clay and wants to marry him, despite his sordid past.

Next, we see Leta carrying a basket of eggs to sell to Bufford's store, drawing disapproving stares and discourtesies from the residents whom she encounters along the way. While negotiating the sale of the eggs with Harvey Bufford, she fancies a pair of ladies' boots but states that she doesn't have enough money to buy them. Harvey insists that she take the boots and even places them into her basket on top of the eggs. But Harvey's price for the boots is Leta's feminine favors, which draws her ire and she smacks him away. Clay enters the store and witnesses the aftermath of their little altercation, warning Harvey to stay away from Leta. As Harvey's wife enters to see what the commotion is about Harvey coldly accuses Leta of trying to steal the boots and picks them up from the basket to show his wife. However, his wife states with clear purpose to Harvey, ""I saw EVERYTHING"".

Now, the Cartwrights have been finding new and ingenious ways to transport the miners' payroll across their Ponderosa ranch without tipping their hand to bandits who had stolen it in the past. This time, Hoss and Lil Joe ride up to the ranch house with a carriage load of wood, except the payroll is concealed beneath the wood. As they unload the payroll cache they unwittingly reveal their secret to Clay who spies them through a pair of binoculars.

It turns out that Clay is a member of the band of robbers who have been targeting the payroll run, but their leader, Spence, seems unwilling to make the hit until the situation is nearly perfect. This does not sit well with the ambitious Clay, who argues with Spence that he could pull it off, saying that he will rob Bufford's store to get enough money to buy fresh horses for the heist. As the dispute escalates, Clay shoots Spence dead to take over the band of outlaws.

Meanwhile, Hoss delivers a sack of feed to Leta for her chickens. She intrigues him with the request to wait at her kitchen table for a surprise. It turns out to be an innocent one as she shows Hoss the wedding dress that she made. When Hoss learns that she intends to marry Clay Renton, his demeanor turns down, but her optimism about starting a better life with Clay shines through the gloomy outlook that we see in Hoss' eyes.

Now the threads come together as Leta carries her home-made wedding dress to town to enter it into the dress contest at the annual Bazaar, but as Mrs. Bufford (Irene Tedrow) is chief arbiter she turns away Leta, telling her that she is too late. Down the street Clay and his band break in to Bufford's store which is closed for the Bazaar, break into the safe, but find only fifty dollars inside. Harvey Bufford enters his store to retrieve a parasol for his wife, but discovers his safe has been cracked open. Clay confronts him and pistol-whips him several times, then flees with his band.

Ben and Hoss came to town to enjoy the Bazaar while Adam and Joe were instructed to carry the miners' payroll today. Ben spots Harvey slumping out the front door of his store and a crowd rushes to his aid as he gasps Clay Renton's name, then gives up the ghost. Ben resolves to find Clay before the town sets another lynch mob after him.

Ben sends Hoss to find his brothers and meet him at Ponderosa. They find that three of the men were seen heading toward the lake, so Ben sends his boys to get them while he heads to Leta's place alone. As expected, Clay is there, but hides in Leta's bedroom while Ben tries to convince her to bring Clay to justice. She fears for Clay's life, but Ben assures her that he will do everything he can to ensure that Clay gets a fair hearing.

Upon leaving, Ben discovers Clay's horse behind Leta's house while Adam shows up to deliver news of the capture of the rest of the band of outlaws. Ben tries to talk Leta out of the house, but Clay plans to take Leta out the back door and make a run for it. The situation worsens when the angry mob from town shows up, not interested in the least in Ben's notion of justice nor fairness; they want blood!

As Clay expounds on his getaway plans, Leta grabs her rifle and orders him to put down his gun. Instead he hides it in his boot and commends Leta on her negotiating skill with Ben, thinking she is on his side in her own getaway plan. She opens the door and follows Clay outside, keeping her rifle trained on him the whole time. Ben tells the crowd he will handle this and if they want Clay so badly he will have his back turned toward them, counting on their honor not to shoot him to get Clay. But, Leta surprises Clay by telling Ben to check his boot for the gun. Seeing that the game is up, Clay reaches down to his boot to draw his weapon, but old Ben is faster, dropping Clay to the ground.

As this morbid scene draws to a close, Mrs. Bufford offers her apologies having now seen Leta's true colors for the first time."

Checking into the hotel, he asks the clerk if he knows the Cartwrights. Tom (Dan Riss) says everyone on the Washoe knows the Cartwrights and indicates that Adam and Little Joe are in town. Kyle asks if ""Little Joe"" is Joseph Francis. Tom laughs, ""You call him that, you better be ready to duck.""

Joe is in the adjoining saloon playing poker when Kyle comes in and watches. Joe doesn't realize it, but the man he's playing against, Gorman (John Anderson), is cheating. Gorman's partner, Regis (Stacy Harris) is standing behind Joe signalling. Kyle intervenes and manages to keep Joe from fighting the two. However, Regis pulls a gun and Gorman swings at Kyle. Despite his lack of one arm, Kyle fights a good fight and wins. Joe, meanwhile, has taken care of Regis. When the fights over, Joe asks Kyle to dinner. After they've left, Gorman wants to follow, but Regis says he remembers Kyle from Kansas. He figures Kyle will be their ""money tree.""

At dinner, Kyle says he's come to the area looking for silver investors for his backers in the East. Joe volunteers to introduce him to the silver mine owners. Hoss jokes that Kyle picked the wrong Cartwright. Joe has hot southern blood and doesn't understand hard cold cash. But Adam's from New England and it just comes naturally to him. Kyle asks about Hoss and he says he's in between. Ben explains that Hoss was born on the prairie as they came west. Hoss adds that he doesn't understand all this talk about North and South. Ben assures him that they all have roots on the Ponderosa now. Kyle says that ideologies go deeper than where a person lives, but changes the subject by accepting Joe's offer to meet the silver owners.

The next day in the saloon, Hoss and Ben walk into an argument about North and South. Again, Ben tries to calm things by saying Virginia City is neither. The Yankee (Mickey Simpson) notices Ben has a NY newspaper and asks Ben what it says. The Reb (John Locke) doesn't want to hear a northern's view, but Ben is encouraged to read it. Ben reads about Lincoln's ""House Divided"" speech. The argument begins to flare up again, but Kyle has entered the saloon and he has a newspaper from Charleston. He too reads about the speech, but it's not entirely condemning. Yank is surprised a southern paper would write that. Kyle replies, ""A man who honestly knows what he believes and has courage enough to act on it, is a man deserving of praise from all men.""

Returning to his hotel room, Kyle is stopped by Regis and Gorman. They've been checking into Kyle and know he's there to acquire silver ore. They figure it's for ""the Cause."" Regis says there are some owners who might not want to go along and for $5000, he and Gorman can be Kyle's own little army. Kyle listens, but is infuriated at their reference ""for the Cause."" Shoving Regis against the wall, he threatens them not to speak of the Cause that way. Again, Gorman wants to fight, but Regis stops him and says this is just a business arrangement. Kyle agrees to that.

Adam goes to the hotel looking for Joe. Tom tells him that Joe had been out introducing Kyle around, but now Kyle's upstairs alone. Just then, Regis and Gorman come down talking about the temper of the one armed man. Adam wonders who they are and why they're talking to Kyle. Tom says the two just got out of prison, but he doesn't know anything about Kyle. If anyone knows about Kyle, it'd be Joe since they've spent so much time together lately. In fact, Tom mentions, Kyle asked about Joe as soon as he got into town.

Adam goes home and informs Ben about Kyle's interest in Joe. Ben's concerned and goes into town himself.

Kyle and Joe are meeting with mine owner, Hennessy (Howard Wendell) in the saloon. Hennessy is not interested in selling his ore to Kyle. Not only does he have buyers in San Francisco, but he wouldn't sell to Kyle anyway. He's heard about Kyle's Southern sympathies and his leanings are in the opposite direction. He leaves. Joe doesn't understand why Hennessy would bring politics into a business deal, especially since Kyle was offering 1/3 more for the ore. Kyle isn't concerned and thanks Joe for introducing him to so many mine owners. He says it helps to have a Cartwright on his side. Joe doesn't understand that and Kyle says before he came to Virginia City he did some research. He checked to see if the Cartwrights were the same ones he'd heard about. He tells Joe that he knew Joe's mother, Marie in New Orleans. He gives Joe a pocket portrait of Marie that he's had for years. Joe is very moved with the gift. To cover his emotions, he offers to take Kyle to meet the last few mine owners in the morning and leaves.

Ben enters the hotel and asks Tom about Kyle. A woman happens to overhear and says she just checked Kyle's room and he's not in. She introduces herself as Lily Van Cleet (Marianne Stewart) who's on her way to California. They sit in the adjoining restaurant and chat. She learns that Ben has a ranch and three sons. She says she had a son named Joseph too. But he died a year ago in a street fight. ""What's happening in Virginia City happened in the east over a year ago."" She lost her son and her husband that night.

Kyle walks up and is surprised to see Lily. Before he can walk her away, Ben asks to speak to him. She gives them a chance to speak privately and Ben wants to know why Kyle sought Joe out. Kyle admits that he knew Marie and gave Joe a picture of her. Ben warns Kyle to leave Joe alone.

The next morning, in Kyle's room, Lily combs her hair. They're married, but she's the daughter of a Northern senator and doesn't believe in her husband's cause. But she does still love him. She laments that this cause has taken their son, his arm, and their marriage. He's still angry that Northern hypocrites took their son, but promises to return to her when all this is over.

Later, Hennessy tells Kyle that he's going to Washington and he's going to tell people what Kyle is up to. Kyle threatens him not to try it. When Hennessy leaves, Kyle calls Regis over.

Hennessy and Lily both climb aboard the stage. As it moves through a mountain turn, it suddenly falls over a cliff.

The bodies have been brought to the Ponderosa and seeing who the victims were, Ben has contacted Kyle. Kyle looks under the blanket and cringes. He asks how it happened. A boulder was in the middle of the road and the driver didn't have a chance. Based on the foot prints, two men were involved. Ben asks who the woman was to Kyle. Kyle merely says she was someone he once knew. Adam is frustrated and demands to know what Kyle is planning. Joe defends Kyle, but Adam insists Kyle is hiding something. Ben breaks it up.

Kyle returns to the saloon and finds Gorman and Regis. At gunpoint, he takes them into a small supply room at the back. He tosses the gun aside and proceeds to beat both of them up.

The next day at the crash site, Kyle finds Lily's cape and caresses it. The sheriff (Kenneth MacDonald) agrees it was murder, but wants to know why Kyle thought Regis and Gorman were involved. Hoss and Joe come down with some tools and one has Gorman's initials on it. That may prove it was Regis and Gorman, but Adam too wants to know how Kyle knew that last night when he beat the two up. Again, Joe comes to Kyle's defense saying Adam's had it out for Kyle since he arrived. They start to fight, but Ben breaks it up. ""Brother against brother. How dare you! Each of you.""

Ben has dozed off when Hoss and Adam wake him to say the Joe came home, but backed a bag and left again. Ben wants to know why Adam didn't stop him. Feeling a bit guilty, Adam says he intends to and walks out. Hoss tells Ben that Adam plans to leave too. Ben hurries after him.

He tries to stop Adam, who's gathering his things, but Adam won't listen. He says he's going to New England, but wants Joe to know that suddenly he found himself saying things he didn't mean, didn't even believe. Then marches over to his waiting horse. Ben again tries to plead with Adam to stay. He can't stand by and watch his family fall apart. Adam tells him the damage has already been done. ""It's got to be me or Little Joe and he needs you more than I do."" Ben is very worried and begs Adam, ""I don't want you to go."" Adam doesn't want to leave, but says they can't have two different views in the same house, it won't work! And he rides off. Hoss figures that Mr. Lincoln must've been talking about houses like theirs. ""No, not us, Hoss. Not us,"" Ben quietly insists.

Kyle and Joe are meeting with some of the mine owners when Ben barges in and kicks them all out. He says Joe can stay and hear what he has to say and then Joe can decide for himself what he wants to do. Ben accuses Kyle of acquiring the silver to back the Confederacy. He accuses Kyle of giving anything for his beliefs. Kyle doesn't see anything wrong with that, or doesn't Ben believe in anything? ""I believe in my sons,"" Ben says firmly. And he lost two of them today. Joe feels a bit ashamed about that. Ben again asks about Lily. Kyle refuses to talk about her. Ben says he knows, he could feel, that Kyle loved her. What is Kyle willing to sacrifice? Kyle still won't answer, though he's clearly bothered by Ben's talk. Ben asks if she was just a woman he met in a saloon? This pushes Kyle over the edge and he starts to attack Ben, but he can't swing. He complains that Ben wasn't going to get involved, this wasn't Ben's fight. Ben says Kyle made it his fight. He reminds Kyle that Kyle lost a son and now a wife, will nothing stand in his way. Kyle says nothing will. And this won't be the end. There will be brother against brother and father against son. Ben tells him that in the end it will all have been a useless waste.

When Kyle leaves, Joe knows what he's lost and apologizes to Ben. Ben reminds him that a tree has many roots, but it only has one tap root and Joe's is on the Ponderosa.

Joe has gone in search of Adam, only to find him staring out over the lake. Joe says he has something to say and Adam had better listen. He says Adam has always been the one who got to stay up late and other privileges because he was the oldest and helped Ben with the problems of the Ponderosa. Well Joe's not going to take it anymore, not if he and Hoss are the ones who are staying. Adam doesn't look at him, but continues to look at the lake. ""That lake sure gets under your skin. Let's go home."""

Later they come downstairs to find a contingency of women, mostly young and beautiful, except for the leader Lorna Doone Mayberry (Ellen Corby) who's an older, wiser woman. The group stop Hoss and Joe and beg them not to kill their men folk. There's not enough to go around as it is. Again, Hoss and Joe find the actions of these people odd, but promise not to kill any that aren't worth killing.

When the boys step outside, they are shot at. They dive into the saloon for cover. But as the shooting continues they think it best if they do as their told and throw out their guns. The Hatfields take Hoss and Joe prisoner and demand they admit that they're the Slade brothers. Jubel Hatfield (George Mitchell) doesn't believe the boys are from Nevada come to Texas to buy cattle. He thinks they should just hang them. Fortunately, Sheriff Brown (Henry Hull) arrives and says they should wait for Twirly Boggs to get back since Twirly is the only one who knows what the Slades look like. The sheriff takes Hoss and Joe to jail for their own protection.

In jail, Hoss figures everyone in town is ""tetched"" from eating the beef of cattle that ate the loco weed. Then a rock with a note comes through the window. It says that Black Alonzo, the Red Handed Avenger will save them. Hoss looks out the window to see a little boy running away.

The ladies of Kiowa Flats all march into the jail and Lorna proceeds to recite her poem. ""Oh poor doomed prisoners, it ain't too late. Down on your knees as you face your awful fate. Repent your crimes before that trap is sprung. And you, like a side of beef, are hung."" The young ladies in the group are taken by handsome young Joseph and argue over who gets to hold his hand as Lorna reads her poetry. And as the poem drags on and on, Joe thinks hanging would be less painful, but Hoss is near tears from it.

When the poem is finally over, the young women again complain that the town is short of men and their wasting two at once by hanging Hoss and Joe. As the young women argue who's been monopolizing Joe's hand, the back wall of the cell falls down. Hoss and Joe don't think twice about busting out and eagerly accept the opportunity.

The McFaddens have sprung the boys and take them back to their home. All along they've protested that they are not the Slades, but, like the Hatfields, the McFaddens don't believe them. The father, Alonso McFadden (Douglas Spencer) locks them in a room for the night. As Hoss and Joe are getting ready for bed, a young boy, Alonzo (Dennis Holmes) climbs in through the window. Hoss recognizes him as the Red Handed Avenger. He explains that they McFaddens hired the Slades to kill Anse Hatfield, cuz he's the best shot in town. Once Anse is dead, the McFaddens can commence killing all the other Hatfields. Hoss and Joe are not going to be party to this. Since Alonzo threatens to call for help, the boys have to tie him up. Then they climb out the window.

Unfortunately, Hoss makes a racket as he trips over a milk bucket, alerting the McFaddens to their escape. They're recaptured.

In the morning, Hoss and Joe refuse to take arms and shoot the Hatfields. Alonso says then they'll just hang them. Hoss and Joe pick up the guns. Hoss does convince Alonso to ride into town and let Twirly identify them as not being the Slades.

Twirly (King Donovan) is the town drunk and he's regaling everyone with the stories from his school days with the Slade brothers. When the sheriff announces that the Slades are approaching, everyone rushes out. But Twirly calls them back to save the whiskey. When Hoss and Joe arrive, Twirly says they are the Slades. (Michael Landon and Dan Blocker played duel roles as Shorty Jim and Big Jack Slade, so they would look alike.) That's enough for the McFaddens and they demand that Hoss and Joe fulfill their obligation.

As the McFaddens prepare for the fight, Hoss and Joe ask the sheriff how it all began. Seems 30 years ago the Hatfields' hog disappeared. And that night, the McFaddens, who didn't own a hog, had pork for dinner. The sheriff admits he knows they're not the Slades and gives them their guns and horses back.

As Hoss and Joe make their way to leave, little Alonzo marches by and announces he's going to kill some Hatfields. Hoss and Joe know what they have to do just by looking at each other. ""That's what I like about us as a family, Joe. Pa always taught us to never do nothing the others would be ashamed of. I'd like to keep it like that,"" Hoss says. They go back into the saloon to talk to the sheriff.

The sheriff has a plan. Hoss then goes over to talk to Lorna. He says it wold be a shame to lose more men when there's so few to go around. He says women have a way of getting men to do what they want. Lorna thinks Hoss isn't so stupid.

Just as the fight is about to begin, the ladies all march between the two sides. They refuse to move or do any womanly things a woman ought to do until they call this silly feud off. Beautiful young Amanda McFadden tells Anse Hatfield that she's waiting for him to come to her, but he better not come with a gun in his hand. Anse isn't a fool. He drops the gun and hurries over. Followed by everyone except Jubel and Alonso. ""It was such a nice day for a fight too."" Hoss, Joe, and the sheriff all shake hands on the success of their plan."

The Cartwrights go into Virginia City, though it's not for retribution. They fear that any action they might take would cause more harm for the local Chinese. But then Ben and Adam run into Lee Chang (Philip Ahn) as he leaves Hammond's store. His son Jimmy is having a birthday party and wants it to be a real American party. Adam tells him not to worry, just have a cake with candles. Lee says he didn't know it had to be candles and not flags. Ben realizes Lee was denied inside the store. Lee doesn't want to cause any trouble and moves on.

Ben and Adam go into the store and Ben asks for American flags. Hammond (Arthur Space) says he doesn't have any little flags. Ben hadn't specified little ones. Another customer, a sleazy man named Tibbs (Christoper Dark,) asks if Ben meant the little ones. Adam doesn't like Tibbs, he's a thief and a gunslinger, and tells Tibbs to mind his own business. Hammond pretends he just found the little flags and sells them to Ben.

Outside, Ben tells Adam not to let Tibbs bother him. Then they notice a sign advertising Andy Fulmer for Virginia City mayor. Ben puts two and two together. Fulmer is a bigot, Tibbs works for Fulmer.

Ben goes to see Fulmer and asks what Fulmer's campaign platform will be. Fulmer (Gene Evans) says he wants to give Virginia City back to the people who made it. Foreigners are taking all the jobs. Ben asks if ""foreigners"" means the Irish, Welsh, or Chinese. Fulmer says he's fighting for the rights of the Irish and Welsh. He doesn't want to hear one of Ben's high and mighty speeches on prejudice. This is Virginia City and Ben can't even vote, so it's not his fight. Ben says that if he finds out the Fulmer had anything to do with his cook being beaten, he'll drag Fulmer up and down the streets.

Hoss and Joe run into Jimmy Chang (Guy Lee) on his way to work. They're going to be at his birthday party and he's looking forward to it. Hoss is too, but he's concerned about the bird's nest soup that they'll be eating. Jimmy just laughs.

Sally Ridley (Patricia Michon) dismounts in front of her father's livery when Billy Wheeler (Ray Stricklyn) approaches and greets her inappropriately. She chastises him and takes her horse into the stable, handing it off to Jimmy. Billy continues to goad her about who she's been spending time with. When he tries to force Sally to kiss him, Jimmy pulls him off. Billy hits Jimmy to the ground, warns him that that was a mistake Jimmy will regret, and leaves. Sally kneels beside Jimmy and starts to tend to his wounds. Her father, J.R. Ridley (Frank Ferguson) walks in and finds Jimmy in her lap. He accuses her of disgracing herself with a heathen and pulls a gun to threaten Jimmy. Sally tries to take the gun from him when it goes off and she falls to the ground dead. Jimmy crawls over to her. Ridley is in shock and drops the gun near Jimmy. Sally's older sister, Amanda (Helen Westcott) comes in and sees the scene. Billy comes in and laughs, he warned Jimmy about his mistake.

Everyone at Jimmy's party is worried because Jimmy is late. He comes running in, beaten. He tells Hoss, Joe, and Lee what happened, but says the men think he killed Sally. Tibbs calls from outside that they came for Jimmy. He says they can send Jimmy out to be taken to jail, or they'll hang him. Hoss and Joe agree to take Jimmy to jail themselves and Jimmy goes willingly. He believes in America everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

At the jail, the Cartwrights and Sheriff Halstead (Gregg Barton) believe Jimmy, but there will be an inquest. The sheriff warns that Fulmer has been waiting for something like this since he announced his candidacy.

Fulmer calls Ridley to his office. Ridley is still in shock. Fulmer goes on about how the town, his friends, are behind him during this tragedy. Ridley explains it was an accident and he shot Sally. But Fulmer convinces him that it wouldn't have happened if Sally was with a nice, American boy. Ridley comes to believe Jimmy caused Sally's death.

At the inquest, Billy lies and says he found Jimmy and Sally carrying on so he went and told Mr. Ridley. Amanda testifies that Jimmy killed Sally. The judge (Alexander Campbell) wants only the facts. Amanda says everyone knows what kind of girl Sally was carrying on with all the boys. She says she heard the shot and found Jimmy kneeling next to Sally's body with his gun at his side where he dropped it. Adam and Ben can't believe Amanda's attitude. Adam is shocked to realize she's jealous of her own sister. Finally, Ridley takes the stand but only says that Jimmy caused Sally's death. Billy is thrilled. He's sure they'll hang Jimmy now. Fulmer says it's hard to tell with a jury. Tibbs suggests it never get as far as a jury. Fulmer likes that idea.

Fulmer continues to spread the poison. At a meeting in Hammond's he says that allowing a Chinese boy to get away with murder is like saying they don't care about their own wives and daughters. He thinks they should do something about it.

The Cartwrights are in the jail and worried about a lynch mob. They all agree to be deputies. Adam decides to talk to Amanda. He leaves and the crowd gathering outside let him go.

Amanda lets Adam in and he comments on all the parties they used to have at her house. She tells him that they haven't entertained in seven years since her mother died and she had to take over the family household. Adam sympathizes. Amanda complains that Sally made it difficult. The way she behaved was shameful. Adam tells her life hasn't past her by and to stop feeling sorry for herself. She tells him to mind his own business. Adam argues that when a young boy's life is at stake, it's everyone's business. She asks if she's just supposed to march up there and say it was all a mistake. Adam says, yes, if it was a mistake that's what he expects her to do. He's always admired her courage to stand up for herself. She falls into his arms crying. She doesn't know what to do. He looks into her face and says, ""Tell the truth."" Just then, Ridley comes in and tells Adam to leave them alone. Jimmy's a murderer and he'll get a fair trial. Adam insists Jimmy won't get a fair trial unless Fulmer says so. He accuses Ridley of being afraid to stand up to Fulmer. Ridley says he's not afraid of anyone. Amanda says they should go tell Fulmer they want to tell the truth and she'll go with him.

Adam, Ridley, and Amanda go to see Fulmer, but Adam has to wait outside. When Ridley says he wants to tell the truth, Fulmer brainwashes him again. Amanda sits there stunned. When they leave, Adam asks what happened. Amanda says she'll convince her father back. Adam says Jimmy's life depends on it.

He returns to the jail and tells them what happened. If Amanda can't convince her father, they'll have a lynch mob on their hands.

Amanda tells her father that Jimmy will die. Ridley says Sally died. Suddenly Amanda realizes that Ridley isn't trying to punish Jimmy, he's trying to punish Sally for disgracing their name. She wonders if he pulled the trigger on purpose. He swears it was an accident. She tells him that if they let Jimmy die, they'll be the ones who are guilty.

Fulmer has the crowd ready for a lynching. As they march toward the jail, the Cartwrights shoot over their heads, scattering them and forcing them to take cover. Ridley runs up and tells Fulmer that he's going to tell the sheriff the truth. He turns towards the jail. Fulmer tells Tibbs to ""get him."" Tibbs shoots Fulmer in the back. Now Fulmer accuses Tibbs of murder. Tibbs is stunned and confused, but the mob has now turned on him. Adam calls to him to drop his gun. Tibbs turns and fires. Adam fires back killing Tibbs. Amanda rushes up and tells the sheriff that they lied on the stand, Jimmy didn't kill Sally.

Ben asks Fulmer if he's happy now that three people are dead. Fulmer won't take the blame for these killings. The crowd, however, turns its back on Fulmer. He chases after them desperately trying to win back their votes."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529826/?ref_=ttep_ep21,,The Cartwrights try to disprove the validity of a Spanish land grant to stop the De La Cuesta family from seizing part of the Ponderosa and all of the Carson Valley settlers' homestead lands.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],"['star crossed lovers', 'land grant dispute', 'flamenco dancing', 'knife in back', 'criminal mastermind', 'trampled by a horse', 'spanish guitar', 'cantina dancer', 'spanish royalty', 'impersonating royalty']",[],"The episode opens with a settler being evicted from his land by some Spanish vacqueros. When the couple insist they're not leaving, one vacquero moves toward the house. Mary Logan (Claudia Bryar) moves to stop him and is shoved to the ground. Her husband (John Frederick) comes to her defense and is shot in the back by Sanchez (Paul Picerni). Mary is warned to be off the property and an eviction notice is nailed to the porch.

The Cartwrights heard the gun shot and hurry to the Logan home, but they're too late. Mary is distraught. She doesn't want to leave the home she and her husband worked for five years. They're expecting a child now too, but her husband is dead. Ben convinces her to leave with them and stops Joe from chasing after the vacqueros.

Ben and Adam go to report the murder to Sheriff Hawkins (Stuart Randall). But Hawkins is already aware of the killing. Senor Luga (Sebastian Cabot), Sanchez's boss, has already provided a complete report and claims it was self-defense. Ben and Adam don't agree. Luga asks why they're interfering, it's not their fight. Adam reminds him that Luga is also trying to take some of their land. Luga brushes it off as just a few hundred acres, the Cartwrights will barely know it's gone. Ben argues that they care about every foot of their property. Luga claims it is the property of his niece, Isabella de la Cuesta.

Luga returns to the hotel suite to find Isabella (Patricia Medina) kissing Sanchez. He ignores her reprimand for not knocking saying it is common for gentlemen to meet in her presence. Sanchez leaves. Isabella is tired of being stuck in the hotel room. Luga reminds her that it is far more luxurious than what she is accustomed to and he doesn't want her leaving and jeopardizing everything he's worked for. She says that if she is Isabella de la Cuesta, as he claims, what could she jeopardize. He reminds her that Isabella is a lady, she is not.

Back at the Ponderosa, Joe wants to know how Luga can just come in and make claims on land. Ben says he has an old Spanish land grant which has been upheld. The law is on his side. Joe asks what they could do if the claim wasn't valid. Ben says they'd fight it. He sends Hoss and Joe to Monterey to verify the claim. Adam suggests that they should also verify the great lady, Isabella. He says he's going to go talk to her. Ben doesn't think that will accomplish much, she and Luga are in this together. Adam says they can't know that since no one's spoken to her.

Adam goes to the hotel and sees Isabella leaving. He follows her to a cantina outside of town. She starts dancing seductively with the Flamenco dancer. When she's done she has a seat and a cowboy comes over to her. Highcard Smith (Holly Bane) says he remembers her as Rosita from San Francisco. She says he's mistaken, but he insists. He's heard she's claiming to be Isabella and figures she wouldn't want her previous life made public. Isabella continues to refuse him and Adam steps in to send him away. He pulls a knife. Adam sidesteps it and pulls his gun sending Smith on his way.

Isabella thanks Adam for his help, but when she learns he's a Cartwright she becomes suspicious. Luga told her the Cartwrights were causing them problems. Adam says he hopes to cause Luga many problems, but a gentleman always helps a lady. She allows him to walk her back to the hotel.

Sanchez sees the two and reports to Luga. Luga tells Sanchez not to interfere, but he's not pleased.

In her rooms, Adam sips some wine and begins asking her about the land grant. She doesn't want to talk about it. He asks how she justifies throwing people off their land. She says it is her land. Adam argues that it belongs to the settlers who worked and sweated over it. She asks how Adam holds his land, with sweat or a title. ""With both,"" he tells her. He asks when she learned she was an heiress. She says when her uncle, Luga, found her and told her. Adam asks where Luga found her, because Adam found her in a cantina and no Spanish lady would be found there. She refuses to discuss her past, but she does start to flirt with him. He responds by leaning in for a kiss. But she steps away and says that when a man kisses her he will have love in his eyes, not business. Adam takes the dismissal and leaves.

Luga isn't happy that she's been with a Cartwright and wants to know what she told him. She counters by saying it would help them to have a Cartwright on their side. Luga likes that idea.

At home, Adam tells Ben that Isabella isn't the woman he thought she'd be. He wonders if Luga is really the one who's trying to take all the land. Ben doesn't see the difference, the two are working together.

Adam takes Isabella riding. She begs for a break. Adam says he thought all Spanish ladies enjoyed riding. She claims she's out of practice. Again she asks why they have to be on opposite sides. Adam says they don't have to be and kisses her. He wants to show her something and takes her over to the Logan house. He says a couple who were expecting a child lived there. She doesn't care, they can live someplace else. Adam tells her the wife and child can, but the husband is dead. Sanchez killed him. She didn't know about the killings and is upset about it. But she won't call Luga and his men off. The land is hers and she's going to be great lady. Is that so bad? He warns her that she'll never enjoy the land, there's too much blood on it.

Smith arrives at the hotel and informs Luga that he knows who Isabella is. Luga says he doesn't care, they're not afraid of her past. Smith says it could confuse a jury to learn that Isabella is also Rosita Moralez. Luga offers him some money. Smith takes it and says he'll keep scratching their backs if they keep scratching his. When he's gone, Sanchez says Smith will be back. ""Unless something else happens to him first,"" Luga replies.

Adam is explaining to Ben that Isabella really was upset about the killings. Ben isn't impressed if she still refuses to withdraw the claim.

Smith arrives at the Ponderosa and tells them he's got information about Isabella. Adam doesn't want to hear it, but Ben says it's what they've been looking for. He dangles a bag of coins in front of Smith who tells them that Isabella's father, Pedro Martinez, runs a store south of Virginia City and Rosita Martinez was a saloon dancer in San Francisco. Ben gives him the money and says there's more, if Smith will say that in court. Smith says he'll be around.

Adam and Ben are headed into town when they find Smith's body on the side of the road. It adds validity to Smith's claims.

At the hotel, Ben and Adam go to talk to Isabella. Isabella runs out of her room and into Adam's arms as she tries to escape from Sanchez. Sanchez just laughs it off as a lover's quarrel. They take Isabella back into her room and Isabella begs Adam to believe that Sanchez attacked her. He just walks past her and stands by the fireplace. Ben asks her about Smith's story. She admits that she is Rosita, but she is also Isabella. Her parents were killed by Indians and she was sold to Pedro Martinez. When she was old enough she escaped and went to San Francisco. Years later, Luga found her there and told her who she really was. She still refuses to withdraw her claim and Ben keeps pressing her until she's crying. Adam tells him to stop, this isn't getting them anywhere.

Ben sends Adam to find Martinez. If he can't disprove Isabella's story then Adam should do whatever he thinks is best.

Sanchez finds Adam in the stables and says Isabella sent him. Adam doesn't believe that. Sanchez pulls a knife and they fight. Adam manages to push Sanchez into a stable, where the riled horse stomps Sanchez to death.

Adam finds Pedro Martinez (Salvador Baguez) in a drunken sleep. Adam wakes him and asks about Rosita. Martinez is pleased she remembers him. He says a year ago a man came by asking for her. The man bought him whiskey. Adam wants to hear something new. Martinez says that five years ago Dona Theresa Esperanza came looking for her grand-niece Isabella de la Cuesta. She came from Mission San Jose. Adam gives him some money and leaves.

The judge (Ned Wever) stops by the Ponderosa and says he can't put off a decision any longer. Ben begs for time for his sons to return. The judge refuses and calls the hearing for the next day.

Hoss and Joe return just as the hearing is beginning. The land grant is strong and valid. Ben again asks for a delay until Adam can return. Luga insists they continue, but Isabella says she doesn't mind waiting for Adam. If he has something pertinent to the case, they shouldn't be afraid to hear it. The judge delays one day.

Adam arrives the next day with a very elderly woman, Dona Theresa Esperanza (Celia Lovesky). She is Isabella's sole remaining relative, which means Luga is not Isabella's uncle. Theresa says she can identify Isabella. Luga and Isabella clearly know and dislike each other. Isabella says Luga approached her about backing a scheme of his to reclaim the de la Cuesta land. Luga says she can't possibly identify Isabella since she hasn't seen her since Isabella was a child. Theresa assures them all that she'll know Isabella. She looks at Isabella and comments on the tilt of her head and the way Isabella carries herself. But, she asks to speak to Isabella alone. Luga is reluctant, since Theresa's comments seem to support his claim, but Isabella also insists.

When everyone is gone, Isabella almost pleads to know if there is a way to know for certain. Theresa asks what Isabella wants, to be rich? To be a great lady? Isabella gets defensive. What's wrong with that? Theresa says the greatest trait of the de la Cuesta's was their generosity and they would never take the land away from people who'd worked it. Isabella says it must have been an interesting ride with Adam.

Isabella calls everyone back in and says she knows who she is. She is Rosita Moralez. Luga calls her a fool and starts to shake her. Adam puts his arm protectively across Rosita as the sheriff drags Luga away. Rosita starts to leave and Adam asks where she's going. She says she's going back to San Francisco where she belongs and she walks out, head held high. The judge apologizes to Theresa for being forced to participate in the unveiling of this impostor. Theresa asks what makes him think she's an impostor."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529512/?ref_=ttep_ep22,,Jeb Drummond is a murderous sheep herder that has Adam taken hostage to try and force Ben to sign over a large section of Ponderosa land to him.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Felix E. Feist'],"['', '', '']",[],"['sheep', 'bully', 'bully comeuppance', 'comeuppance', 'opening action scene']",[],"Jeb Drummond (Everett Sloane) is driving his herd of sheep across the Ponderosa when the Cartwrights ride up. Ben politely tells him to leave. Jeb asks for permission, he's willing to pay. Ben doesn't want the money, he wants Jeb and his sheep to go. Jeb starts to get a little angry and puts his hand on his rifle. Adam, Hoss, and Joe all pull their guns. Jeb backs down and asks if he can camp out for the night. Ben sighs, but agrees.

The next morning, Jeb has decided he's not leaving. He tells his young herdsman, Billy (Ray Daley) that they're going to take the land. He wants Billy to take two men and watch for the Cartwrights. They're to kill the first man they see. Billy can't believe Jeb would kill a man for no reason. Jeb explains that they have to take what they want and the Cartwrights would kill them if given the chance. He also claims the Cartwrights are no different from the men that tried to hang Billy when Jeb first found him. Jeb saved Billy's life when he would've been wrongly hanged for a horse thief. Billy (at least til now) has been grateful to Jeb and has always respected him, so he does as he's told.

Billy, Collier (Ken Lynch), and Wheeler (Jerry Oddo) take up a position. Wheeler would rather just scare the Cartwrights. Collier knows the Cartwrights aren't the kind that scare. Billy doesn't want to face Jeb's wrath and tells them to shoot to kill because that's what Jeb said to do.

Adam comes up on Wheeler and Collier just as the two have decided to quit Jeb. Adam, gun drawn, orders them to drop their guns. Wheeler spins with rifle in hand. Adam shoots him. Collier rides away. Adam checks on Wheeler and just sighs that it came to this.

Collier returns to Jeb and tells him that Wheeler is dead. Jeb is angry that Collier didn't kill Adam, but he has a plan. He just needs to get the herd into a draw.

Ben is furous that Jeb didn't leave. Adam thinks they should get the sheriff and let the law handle it. Ben says that by the time the courts settled it, the sheep would have torn up the north pasture. It's his land that he cleared and planted and he'll protect it from people like Drummond. He tells the boys to get their guns. Adam reluctantly joins them.

Jeb has the herd in the draw. Billy's confused because they'll be the ones trapped in the draw, not the Cartwrights. Jeb sends Collier and some other men to watch from a ledge. He tells Billy to go hide near the entrance to the draw. Collier's worried the Cartwrights will shoot them all down in the draw, but Jeb knows Ben's not the type to shoot unless shot at. All he wants to do is capture a Cartwright alive and that'll be Billy's job. Billy doesn't like the idea, but Jeb again reminds him of how he saved Billy from hanging and that the Cartwrights would shoot them if given a chance.

The Cartwrights arrive at the draw and are suspicious. Adam says they could just hold their ground and starve Jeb out. Joe would rather ride in and get it over with. Ben doesn't want all four riding straight in as easy targets. He sends Hoss and Joe one way while he and Adam will approach from the front. Adam tries one last time and says they can hold Jeb off while he goes back for the sheriff. Ben again refuses. If they can't fight for their land, they might as well hand it over to the first settler that comes along.

Ben and Adam approach. Ben calls to Jeb and tells him to leave or Ben will starve them out. Jeb acts apologetic and asks to stay the night again. Ben refuses. Jeb tells his men to start moving the herd. Ben tells Adam to help them and Adam moves forward. As soon as he's clear, Billy jumps him and everyone else starts shooting.

Ben takes cover behind a rock with Hoss, but is determined to get to Adam. Hoss worries that Ben won't make it, but Ben says, ""Adam's in there. I'll make it."" Meanwhile, Billy and Adam are fighting. Adam makes a break (with Ben's urging) but he runs out of room. Billy's right behind him, but his gun is jammed. Now Adam has the upper hand. But rather than shoot Billy, Adam tells him to get out of the way. Billy's surprised and asks if Adam isn't going to shoot him. Adam just tells him to move. Billy can't move, Jeb told him to capture Adam, so the two just shove each other. Then Jeb comes up with his gun and holds it on Adam. He tells Ben to stop shooting or he'll kill Adam. Billy is stunned, but remains silent. Ben asks what Jeb wants. Jeb cackles in his victory. He's going to cross the Ponderosa with his flock and if Ben tries to stop him it'll cost Adam's life. Ben hasn't got a choice, but threatens, ""If you harm him. I'll find you and I'll kill you if I have to follow you clear to Hell.""

Back at the house, Ben is blaming himself for Adam's predicament. Hoss and Joe assure him that they would've done the same things Ben did, but now they know better. Ben admits Adam was right, but when Hoss suggests that next time they'll let the law handle things, Ben is upset. He doesn't want to go begging for help. Hoss says it isn't begging, it's asking for help from someone who's job it is to protect them. Joe agrees that normally he'd rather fight their own battles, but this time they have Adam. Ben tells Joe to get the sheriff.

At the camp, Jeb's decided he doesn't want to just cross the Ponderosa, he wants the land for himself. Billy asks how he's going to do that. Jeb gestures to Adam who's bound. He says that if you get a man in his soft spot, you can squeeze anything out of him.

Billy takes Adam some food. He asks why Adam didn't shoot him when he had the chance. Adam just says he couldn't. Adam asks how Billy came to be with Jeb. Billy explains that he's been on his own for a while and foolishly bought a horse from a man without getting a bill of sale. The real owner accused him of stealing it and was going to hang him when Jeb arrived and drove off the men. He owes Jeb. Adam says that doesn't mean he has to be like Jeb. Besides, doesn't Billy realize Jeb only does things that benefit him. He wasn't saving Billy to save him, but for his own purposes. Billy slaps Adam. He figures Adam can't understand because the Cartwrights have so much, but all Billy has is Jeb.

The next day, Ben and Hoss ride out to meet Jeb as he's driving his herd. Adam is tied up in the back of a wagon. Ben isn't carrying a gun and Billy takes Hoss'. Ben offers himself in Adam's place. Jeb doesn't care, what he wants is the Ponderosa. He tells Ben to sign over 50,000 acres or he'll kill Adam. Adam tells Ben not to do it, ""It isn't worth it."" Ben answers, ""Isn't it?"" and signs the paper. Billy is stunned. Jeb is jubilant. Adam leaps off the wagon and tackles Jeb, but his hands are tied and Ben and Hoss don't have guns, so the rebellion is short-lived. Billy holds a gun on Adam and Jeb is mad. He wants the gun so he can shoot them all. Billy refuses. The Cartwrights haven't done anything to be killed for. Jeb angrily tells him that you have to take what you want. Still Billy keeps the gun. Jeb complains that he should've let the men hang Billy for taking the three horses. Billy never told Jeb that the men were looking for three horses and now realizes it was Jeb that originally stole them. He didn't kill the men to save Billy, he killed them so they wouldn't catch Jeb. He doesn't owe Jeb anything. So as Jeb moves forward, Billy pulls the trigger.

As Billy is leaving the Ponderosa, Ben offers him some land to homestead."

They're headed into town for a dance, but Dave offers to help stack hay. He's using the pitchfork to toss the hay up to Hoss when a man rides in with a rifle and orders Dave not to move. He's U.S. Marshal Emmett Dowd (Claude Akins). He accuses Dave of being a murderer and is taking him back to California. Dave turns, still holding the pitchfork, and Dowd knocks him to the ground.

The boys are explaining to Ben what happened and defending Dave. Dowd isn't bothered. He's quietly angry and confident. Since Dowd has the proper paperwork and authority, there's nothing Ben can do and Dowd takes Dave to Virginia City in cuffs. The Cartwrights decide they have to do something to help Dave.

The next morning, Ben wires a lawyer friend in Los Angeles asking him to defend Dave. Hoss arrives from visiting Dave in jail and says Dave is all beat up. The Cartwrights hurry over to find Dave bruised and beaten. The deputy (Tom Greenway) says he wasn't on duty at the time, but Dowd returned later and did this. Ben doesn't understand since Dave was cooperating. He asks if Dave did anything to provoke it. Dave peers up at Ben through his black eye and asks if Ben thinks Dowd needed any provocation. Adam tells Dave about the lawyer in L.A., but Dave doesn't think Dowd will let him get to L.A. alive.

The Cartwrights arrive at the hotel to confront Dowd just as he's checking out. But Dowd isn't intimidated and leaves the hotel. An Austrian couple, father and daughter, are planning on taking the same stage as Dowd, but Dowd told them they couldn't go. They ask Adam if that's the case. Adam admits that a prisoner will be traveling and perhaps they should wait. But they have a boat connection to make and still plan to go.

As Dowd pushes Dave onto the stage, Adam and Hoss decide they'll ride along too, just to make sure everything goes well. Dowd doesn't like it, but he can't commandeer a public stage. He does order the boys to give up their guns, which are locked in the strong box by the driver (Bud Osbourne) and Dowd takes the key. The Straussers, Anton (John Wengraf) and Andrea (Fintan Meyler), also insist on going.

Inside the stage, Andrea is bothered by the treatment Dave is receiving. Dowd doesn't care. He says Dave is a murderer and needs to be chained. Dave has given up hope and tells them not to argue with Dowd about it, ""I'm finished anyway."" This distresses Andrea even more.

The stage pulls up at a watering hole and there's a young rider waiting. Hurd Cutler (Ron Hayes) says his horse came up lame and he'd like to ride along in the stage. Again, Dowd doesn't like it and believes he saw Hurd while in Virginia City. Hurd denies being in town and says he's headed to California. Dowd forces him to give up his gun too before riding on.

At the way station for the night, Dowd takes over. He orders the Straussers to sleep in the manager's room, much to Micah Bailey's (Will Wright) disapproval, and for the men to sleep in the parlor. He also takes Micah's gun and keys.

At dinner, Dave and Dowd sit separately from the others. Andrea is concerned that Dave's not eating, though she can understand why. Her father quietly tries to hush her, but she continues. Dave tells her about his childhood and broken home. He says he tried to stay in one place for as long as he could and now it looks like that'll happen. Adam reminds him that the trial hasn't happened yet. But Dave pessimistically points out that a lot can happen between now and the trial. Dowd calls an end to the evening and sends everyone to bed. When everyone is gone, Dave starts taunting Dowd. He asks how long it's been since Dowd slept and Dowd says it's been a year. Dave starts to whistle a tune which clearly irritates Dowd. Dave says the song's about a woman named Corrie who died. Dowd hits Dave very hard twice.

Dowd, who dozed off in the middle of the night, gets up to check things. He peeks into the parlor and hears Hoss whispering to Adam. Hoss says Hurd isn't there. Dowd goes out to the barn and finds Hurd readying his horse. Hurd releases all the horses at once and they stampede out of the barn charging over Dowd. Hurd comes out and throws a pitchfork at Dowd on the ground. Dowd fires and kills Hurd. Adam and Hoss have come out at the noise and Adam accuses Dowd of murdering Hurd. Dowd claims Hurd was Dave's accomplice.

Anton Strausser is a doctor and he's bandaged Dowd up, but Dowd is badly injured. Adam has no sympathy for him and claims suspicion has rotted Dowd's mind. Dowd insists that Hurd came to help Dave escape. Andrea tells him that they just wanted him to show Dave some compassion. Dowd can't. Dave is responsible for Dowd's killing of his wife. Dave told Cora a sad tale and she felt sorry for him and released him. Then he threw her into Dowd's line of fire and Dowd accidentally shot Cora. Adam isn't convinced and turns to leave, but Dowd calls him back. He says Adam has to take Dave into L.A. since he's unable to now. He hands Adam his marshal badge. Adam doesn't want it. Dowd says it's Adam's duty. Adam takes the badge and leaves the room.

He shows it to Dave, who's still cuffed to the cot in the dining room. Dave can't believe it, but is glad because now Adam can release him. Adam refuses to do that, even though he hasn't decided to wear the badge. He hears someone outside and goes out to find Hoss returning with one of the runaway horses. He takes his frustration out on Hoss. Hoss just goes back into the night to look for the other horses. Adam stays outside trying to decide what to do.

Inside, Andrea talks with Dave. He's confused and doesn't understand why Adam, his friend, would treat him this way. Andrea doesn't know either and calls him David for the first time. He says he likes the way she says his name and tells her that he's innocent. She believes him and he kisses her. He appeals to her to release him. All she has to do is take the keys out of Dowd's coat pocket. She's reluctant and he plays on her emotions saying someone like him doesn't deserve to ask for help. She agrees to help him and he kisses her again.

Andrea goes into the parlor and takes the keys from Dowd's coat. She doesn't realize Dowd is awake and knows what she's done. She returns and unchains Dave. She's pleased that he's free, but he says he's not free with Dowd around. He's going to give Dowd a taste of his own treatment and starts gathering up the chains. Andrea is shocked, but Dave says ""I killed his wife didn't I? He's not going to forget that.""

Adam has made a decision and returns to the cabin. He tells Dave not to move. Dave hunkers down behind Andrea using her as a shield. He says if Adam shoots, Adam will have to kill Andrea first. Adam asks if that's what happened with Dowd's wife. Then Dave remembers Adam doesn't have a gun. He charges Adam and they tumble outside. Adam starts beating Dave, even though Dave is down. He doesn't stop until Dowd, with his rifle, orders him to. Adam asks why Dowd suddenly cares. Dowd says Dave has to get to the trial. Adam reminds Dowd that he would've killed Dave himself if he and Hoss hadn't been around. Dowd doesn't deny that saying he's thought of little else for a year, but says he didn't realize what he'd turned into until he saw Adam."

He and his associate enter the office of the Territorial Enterprise where the editor, Dennis (Arthur Shields) and Joe are proof reading an article. The stranger says he received a copy of the paper in New Orleans and it mentioned Ben Cartwright. He describes Ben and says Ben has two sons. Dennis corrects him and Joe steps forward to introduce himself. He asks what interest the man has in Ben. The man merely wants to know where Ben is. Dennis proudly says that Ben's in Siver City at a reception in his honor. They're grooming him for the governorship. The man reads the article's headline: Nevada and Ben Cartwright, a Great Future Together. The man crumples the paper and says Ben has no future. Joe grabs the man's arm and asks what he meant by that. The man merely tells Joe to tell Ben that Charles LaDuque (Lloyd Nolan) is at the hotel. Joe reaches for him again, but the associate, Cole (Hal Baylor) slugs Joe so hard he crashes across the room. LaDuque says they'll smash Ben as easily as he smashed the story of Ben's life.

Joe goes to the hotel and up to LaDuque's room. He wants revenge on Cole, but Cole isn't there. Joe asks why LaDuque is interested in Ben. LaDuque says he'll spare Joe the ugly details of the story. But he comments that Joe looks a lot like his mother. He says he was good friends with her. Joe, as always, is defensive of his mother and tells LaDuque to leave her out of it. His ""ugly story"" couldn't have been aobut her. LaDuque says it involves Ben. Joe calls him a liar. LaDuque challenges him to ask Ben about him. He's a police inspector from New Orleans and he's here to arrest Ben after 20 years. The charge is murder.

When Ben and Adam return home, Joe tells him that some strangers said some things about Ben that he didn't like. Ben's not concerned until Joe mentions LaDuque's name. He immediately goes to town.

Cole lets Ben into LaDuque's room and LaDuque comments on Ben being considered for govenrnor. Ben merely says he has good friends. LaDuque responds that a policeman doesn't have the chance to gain family, friends, and admiration. He's clearly blaming Ben for something. He reminds Ben that he's been handicapped by a shattered knee cap that he got in the investigation of the murder of Simon LaRouche. Ben remembers. Ben reminds LaDuque that he was cleared of those charges when three witnesses came forward asserting it was self-defense. Ben did run from the inspector, but he offered to return until he learned the charges were dropped. LaDuque says Ben has no proof of that and produces a warrant for Ben's arrest. Ben wants to know why LaDuque is doing this after 20 years. LaDuque says Ben escaped him and in the scuffle LaDuque shot himself in the knee. Ben won't take responsibility for that since LaDuque was trying to kill him and he was unarmed. Of course he tried to run. But LaDuque does hold him responsible. Ben isn't overly concerned, the warrant isn't valid in Nevada. LaDuque threatens to expose the story of Marie and LaRouche. Ben glares at him and walks out.

Ben goes over to the Enterprise and dictates his withdrawl from consideration for governor.

When Ben tries to explain to the boys why he withdrew, Joe knows he's not telling them everything. Ben simply says that he loved Marie and she took Adam and Hoss as her own. But LaRouche came into their lives and threatened to expose Marie. Joe wants to know what he could reveal. Ben tries to sidestep the issue, but Joe is insistant. Ben only says that LaRouche wanted to ruin Marie's reputation. What she did or did not do in her past was of no importance to him. He loved her and she was a wonderful person. But Marie didn't want to bring scandal to her family, so she paid LaRouche's blackmail until Ben found out. He confronted LaRouche. There was a fight, LaRouche pulled a knife and Ben killed him. Joe's angry at LaDuque for bringing this all up now and wants to go to town to deal with it. Ben makes him promise not to harm LaDuque.

Joe angrily tells LaDuque that Ben told him everything and if LaDuque drags his mother's name through the dirt, Joe will kill him. Cole steps in and says Joe will have to kill him first. Joe thinks that might be the best part. They fight. Cole pulls a gun, but Joe is faster and kills Cole. LaDuque says Joe just provided him the opportunity to tell Marie's story at Joe's trial because he's not going to vouche for Joe's self-defense. Joe hears people coming down the hall and runs. LaDuque takes Cole's gun and puts it in the holster. He tells the arriving crowd that Joe shot Cole in cold blood.

Sheriff Brady (Robert Foulk) comes to the Ponderosa and tells Ben that Joe killed Cole and LaDuque says it was in cold blood. Hoss knows Joe wouldn't do that, but Brady says he has to bring Joe in. Ben knows Joe will come home and asks to be allowed to bring Joe in himself.

Ben finds Joe sitting at Marie's grave. He was waiting for Ben so he could say good bye. Ben says Joe's not going anywhere and asks what really happened and why he ran. Joe knows he wouldn't stand a chance with LaDuque as the only witness. Ben tells him that Marie begged Ben to stand trial even though her story would come out, but Ben didn't. He made a mistake and he can't let Joe do the same. He asks Joe to trust him.

Joe turns himself in. Ben goes to make a deal with LaDuque. He'll return to New Orleans if LaDuque clears Joe. LaDuque makes Ben promise to return with him alone, unarmed, and he won't try to escape. Ben agrees. LaDuque tells Brady he's remembering details now and it was self-defense as Joe says. Ben makes Brady promise not to release Joe until Ben's long out of town. Adam and Hoss doen't like the conditions Ben areed to, but Ben makes them promise to stay behind too.

Their first night on the trail, Ben asks why it took LaDuque 20 years to come for him. LaDuque blames Ben for that. He had to be made an inspector before he could name his own assignments and the physical impairment held him back. Ben again won't take responsibiltiy for the leg injury. He says the leg has really been helpful to LaDuque. It gives him something to blame all his shortcomings on. LaDuque pulls his rifle and yells, ""Stop it or I'll shoot you now!"" This only confirms what Ben suspected. LaDuque has no intention of taking Ben all the way to New Orleans. He asks if it's going to look like Ben was trying to escape. LaDuque only answers, ""You'd like me to say yes so it will give you an excuse to break your word."" Ben says he has no intention of breaking his word, he intends to arrive in New Orleans and he lies down to go to sleep.

The next morning as they're about to mount up, Indians shoot at them. LaDuque shoots back but refuses to give Ben a gun. The Indians are more interested in the horses and leave LaDuque and Ben without horses or water with the heat of the day coming. They start walking.

LaDuque struggles in the heat and Ben offers to help, but LaDuque holds the rifle on him. Ben tells him to shoot, after all he's waited 20 years for it. LaDuque collapses. Ben hauls LaDuque the rest of the way to the next way station and gives him some water. LaDuque wonders why Ben didn't leave him in the desert to die. Ben simply asks the station manager (Hank Worden) when the next eastobund stage is due. LaDuque wants to know where they're going. ""New Orleans"" Ben tells him. LaDuque admits Ben isn't wanted in New Orleans, he was cleared of that murder by everyone but him. He admits he wanted to kill Ben. Ben simply asks the station manager for some food and stands up to wash off. He offers his hand to LaDuque and LaDuque accepts it."

Haas'],"['', '', '']",[],"['deserter', 'unrequited love', 'u.s. army officer', 'house of cards', 'escaped prisoner']",[],"Three army prisoners have escaped Ft Dayton. Mertz (James Parnell) still has chains around his wrists. Of the three, he's the big, dumb, strong one. Paul Tyler (Grant Williams) is trying to use a rock to break through the chains. He's not having any luck. The third escapee, Sutton(Joe Maross), leans against a rock complaining. He chastises Mertz for having killed the guard on the escape. He says they'll never get the chain off with rocks. Mertz says maybe the friend Sutton's taking them to will have a chisel. ""Sure, we'll tell her you always go around wearing chains."" Tyler is surprised to find out they're heading to a woman's house. Adam, who's out looking for strays, hears them talking and goes to investigate. Unfortunately, they overpower him and he's knocked out.

A soldier patrol from Ft Dayton arrives at the Ponderosa. Capt Bolton (Chris Alcaide) knocks on the door and introduces himself. Ben invites him in and introduces Hoss and Joe. Both hold their hands out to greet him, but Bolton ignores them completely stepping into the room and looking around. Bolton explains that Fort Dayton is a casuals post for troops deemed not fit for line duty. He says he's looking for three deserters who escaped from the stockade. He says their trail ends on the Ponderosa. Joe tells him that he was riding line and didn't see anything. Bolton can't believe Joe saw no tracks or campfires or any indication. Ben says three men could easily lose themselves on the Ponderosa. Capt Bolton wants to know who else is in the house and marches farther into the room. Ben tells him there's just them and Hop Sing. He resents the innuendo that he might be harboring the fugitives. Bolton says, ""Then you'll have no objection to my men searching the area."" But Ben does mind. He stops Bolton by standing in front of him at the foot of the stairs and says again, the men are not in his house. Bolton says they know the men are in the area and they had to get assistance. Anyone who helps them will the held and tried for obstructing military justice. Ben doesn't budge. Bolton starts to head for the kitchen when Ben asks Hoss to escort the Capt out. Hoss is happy to comply. Just then, a soldier calls out that they have a man. They rush outside and the soldiers have Adam, who staggered in without his coat and gun. He's bleeding from a head wound. He says some men bushwhacked him just west of where he and Joe split up. The Capt asks if he saw the men's faces. Adam shakes his head no and they take him inside.

Ben and Joe will go looking for the men, since Joe knows the area Adam was in. The Capt believes it's the prisoners and wants to go search. Ben says it's his land and his son who was hurt. If Bolton wants to come along, ""You'll ride where I say and behind me. Otherwise take your men and get off the Ponderosa."" Bolton's not thrilled with it, but he doesn't really have a choice.

The three prisoners, Sutton wearing Adam's coat and Tyler carrying his gun, stop near a small cave. Sutton's trying to get his bearings. They're headed for Netta's house. Mertz tumbles into a prickly bush and cries out. Sutton tells him to be quiet and they start to fight. Tyler orders them to stop. Sutton reminds him that Tyler's not an officer any more and can't give orders. But he doesn't really understand Tyler. Tyler only had six months left on his sentence, so he doesn't know why Tyler didn't just stick it out. Tyler merely says he had his reasons. Sutton tells Mertz he can't go to the farm with chains, so he'll have to wait there for them. Tyler agrees and promises Mertz they'll come back for him.

Ben, Joe and the patrol have followed the tracks. They find Mertz in the cave. Bolton demands to know where the others are, but Mertz is silent. Bolton backhands him and Mertz says he doesn't know where the others went. Bolton starts to hit him again, but Ben stops him. Bolton reminds Mertz of ""the box"" and has Mertz dragged away. Mertz struggles saying he'd rather die than go back in the box. Bolton pulls his gun as he trips Mertz then takes aim. Ben pulls him off. Bolton claims the prisoner tried to escape, but Ben says Bolton tried to murder a man and he intends to tell the captain's commanding officer.

Tyler and Sutton have made it to Netta's barn. A young foul lies weak in the hay and Tyler goes to it. Sutton starts to clean up and wonders if Bolton is still looking for them. He figures the brass will give up eventually. Tyler puts on a clean shirt and asks if Netta will be waiting for Sutton. Sutton's sure she will be, they were real friendly. They hear a noise and take cover. It's Netta (Gloria Talbott) who puts a warm blanket over the colt. Sutton comes up behind her. At first she's frightened, but when she realizes who it is, she's glad to see him. Sutton introduces Tyler and says he left the army and they're prospecting together. She says she hadn't heard from him in two years and thought he'd forgotten about her. He assures her that she's the only thing that kept him going. He asks about her father, but she tells him that he died.

Ben complains to Colonel Metcalf (Dayton Lummis) about Bolton. The Col says Bolton claims Mertz was trying to escape. Ben asks if they talked to Mertz. The Col says Mertz is dead. Bolton comes in and defends his actions as being by Army regulation. Ben doesn't know of any regulation for the killing of men. The Col says he has to stand with Bolton. Ben understands and leaves. The Col warns Bolton not to step out of line. Bolton asks to go back to the Ponderosa to continue the search. He's acquired a warrant, so the Col lets him go.

At breakfast, there's a knock on Netta's door. Sutton tells her not to let anyone know they're there. He explains that they just hit a big silver strike and they want to keep it a secret. Hoss is at the door and tells Netta that two prisoners escaped from the fort and are in the area. She acts a little nervous and doesn't invite Hoss in. He thinks it's a bit odd, but leaves. When she returns to the kitchen, Sutton is holding a gun. Now she's suspicious. She asks outright if they're the men the army is looking for. Sutton admits they are, but it's not his fault. He was framed. He tried to serve his time, but the captain is a sadist and he beats men down. He couldn't stay. He says Tyler was held in a sweat box for three weeks. Tyler, who hasn't liked all the lies, admits that's true. Sutton begs for her help and she allows them to stay.

After Hoss reports Netta's behavior, the Cartwrights decide they better go back and check things out.

Tyler and Netta are caring for the colt and Tyler tells her that he was raised with horses. He trusts them and wishes he could say the same for people. He takes off his shirt to clean up and she sees the scars across his chest. She's horrified that he'd be treated that way. He says not to worry about it, he's not worth it. She says she's only known him a little while, but she thinks he's worth it. Ben comes in and Tyler grabs a board to swing at him, but Ben has a gun. Sutton comes in behind Ben and when Ben turns, Tyler hits him with the board. Tyler and Netta drop down beside Ben and Tyler's worried he hit Ben too hard. Sutton realizes Ben knows who they are and cocks his gun to shoot him. Tyler grabs Ben's gun and stops Sutton. Sutton thinks Tyler's crazy. He'll wind up back with Bolton. Tyler asks where Sutton's going to go now. Sutton doesn't know, but he's not staying. He starts to leave the barn, but sees Hoss and Joe outside. He returns and claims he can't leave without Netta. Netta doesn't want to go with him. Hoss and Joe come in and take over and help Ben up. The men refuse to go back, they just want a break. Netta says she's seen the scars and also asks Ben for help. Ben says it's an army matter and takes the men's dogtags. He's going to go talk to the Col. Tyler says if Bolton comes for them, no matter what it takes, he won't go back.

Ben is stopped by Bolton and his men. They find the dogtags and know he's seen the men. Ben refuses to say where, but they know the direction he was coming from.

Back in the barn, Tyler and Netta still tend to the colt. Tyler says he wouldn't have given the colt much of a chance last night. Netta says last night she might not have thought Tyler was worth saving. ""What makes you think I am now?"" he asks. She replies that he saved Ben's life. Hoss asks what landed Tyler in the stockade. Tyler says he refused to obey orders. He was to take his small unit and attack a much larger band of Indians. It was suicide, so he didn't do it. He didn't know it at the time, but he was the diversionary attack and because he didn't do his job, many other soldiers were killed in the frontal assault. Netta doesn't think he should be punished for refusing a suicide mission, but Hoss says the Army usually knows what they're doing. She challenges, did they know what they were doing when they put those scars on Tyler. Joe says not to judge the whole army by Bolton. Sutton insists that's what they're being sent back to. All they want is a chance to get out the back. Joe tells him to be quiet. Sutton tries a different tactic claiming Netta will feel horrible seeing him being dragged away. She's waited two years for him. Netta doesn't answer and Sutton is suddenly suspicious of her feelings for Tyler. Tyler doesn't like the insinuation and there's a brief scuffle. As Joe and Hoss try to break it up, Sutton gets a gun. He holds the gun on Joe and threatens to kill him if Hoss makes a move. Hoss assures him, ""You do that mister and all the bullets in that gun, ain't gonna keep me from squeezing the life outta you."" Sutton takes Hoss' guns and leaves the barn.

He's about to take Joe's horse when he hears riders coming. He takes cover. He starts to sneak away and climb over a fence when Bolton shoots him in the back. Netta asks Hoss and Joe to tell Bolton that Tyler is unarmed and giving himself up. As soon as they leave, she begs Tyler to run out the back. He refuses. Bolton would shoot them both down and now he's got something to live for. Hoss and Joe tell Bolton that Tyler is unarmed, but when Tyler comes out, Bolton orders him to drop his gun. Tyler raises his hands and Bolton orders him again to drop his gun and then he takes aim. Ben shoves him and the shot misses Tyler. Sutton, who's been lying on the ground left for dead, rises up and uses his last bit of strength to shoot Bolton. The other soldiers shoot Sutton and Netta runs into Tyler's arms. Ben tells the Corporal (Sherwood Price) to take Tyler back to the fort. Netta promises to wait for him."

Hawkins' men are in town to make sure it happens.

Hoss and Joe ride up to the jail and tell Ben that they found Duece Martin, a witness. He's dead. He fell or was pushed from a cliff. Sheriff Hansen (Robert Griffin) reminds them that Duece gave a statement immediately after the murder. Joe counters with the fact that Duece then left town and now he's dead. Ben tells Hoss and Joe to do three things: 1. Go talk to the only surviving witness Sally Byrnes (Jean Allison). 2. Stop by the paper. Mr. Baxter (Ian Wolfe) is running a special edition that will make people think. 3. Find Barney Arden (Robert Brubaker) and help him get names for the petition to the governor.

A stranger rides into town. He takes his horse to the livery. The liveryman, Zeke Jackson (Dan White) asks where the man is from. He says he's from Lassiter, Kansas. Zeke recalls that was the town attacked by raiders and burned. Lassiter (Vic Morrow) merely asks about the hanging scaffold. Is the hanging coming or been. Zeke tells him it's set for 6:00 that night. After Zeke takes the horse away, Hoss and Joe come through and Joe bumps into Lassiter. Joe's ready for a fight, but Lassiter won't take the bait and Hoss calms Joe down. After Lassiter leaves, Hoss and Joe take out their hidden rifles and hide them in the stable.

Lassiter goes to the cafe for supper. Only the owner, Sally Byrnes is there. While she's getting his dinner, he notices her calendar. The days up to today are crossed out and today, April 26, is circled. When she returns he asks why the town is so empty. She says the people are afraid to see the Cartwrights hang. He says he noticed she was counting the days. Hoss and Joe come in. They tell Sally that Duece is dead and now she's the only witness against Ben and Adam. She isn't intimidated and says she told what she saw at the trial. Joe grabs her and calls her a liar. Lassiter is immediately there to push Joe off even as Hoss is pulling Joe back. Joe apologizes and says he only wanted Sally to tell the truth. Sally remains determinedly silent and Joe leaves. Hoss asks one more time, politely. Sally tells him that she's not going to lie for him and Hoss leaves resigned. Sally then thanks Lassiter for standing up to the Cartwrights. The only other person she's seen do that is Cy Hawkins. Lassiter asks about the murder. She says Ben and Adam came claiming that her father bought stolen Ponderosa horses. They were out back with Duece. She heard arguing and then the shooting. She's upset and asks him to understand that it was a crazy way to die. Lassiter says he knows the feeling very well.

A young boy, Jimmy (Eugene Martin) comes into the cafe. The sheriff sent him to get stew for the prisoners. Sally's not happy about it, but goes to get it. While they wait, Jimmy notices the way Lassiter sits and wears his hat and gun. He tries to mimic the man. Lassiter plays along for a bit, then goes back to the kitchen. He asks Sally if Lassiter, Kansas means anything to her. It doesn't. He asks if Ben Cartwright is a tall man. She says Ben is big, but wouldn't Lassiter know the name of the man he's looking for. Lassiter says he'll know him when he sees him and heads over to the jail.

When Lassiter looks at Ben, he's disappointed. Ben asks if Lassiter thought the hangman would be doing him a favor. Lassiter says yes and apologizes for bothering Ben. As he's about to leave, Hoss comes in. He tells Ben and Adam that Sally won't change her story. Joe's gone down to the mines because they figure that's where Barney is getting signatures for the petition. Ben's glad to hear it, but reminds Hoss to go to the paper too. Adam recommends he stop at the telegraph office. Maybe Barney's already wired the governor. Before Hoss leaves, Ben makes him promise to do what he can, but to stay within the law. And no matter what, not to take up arms. He doesn't want Hoss and Joe fighting the law and their friends. Hoss promises and leaves. Lassiter overheard all this and returns to the cell area. He says Ben couldn't be more opposite of the man he's looking for.

Lassiter goes to Gil's Saloon and orders a whiskey. Most of Hawkins' men are there. Bert (Harry Swoger) notices the odd way Lassiter wears his gun and teases him about it. Lassiter ignores him, refusing to be provoked. Fred (James Anderson) the leader, asks if Lassiter is a friend of the Cartwrights. Without looking at him Lassiter says he is. Fred asks how long? Lassiter says, ""Maybe ten, fifteen minutes."" Fred says it's a short friendship. Bert wants to make sure that Lassiter doesn't get in their way and gives him a warning. Lassiter ignores him again, which just makes Bert mad and Fred sends him outside to cool down. Lassiter merely asks the bartender (Bern Bassey) if the Cartwrights have any friends. ""Not many,"" he says.

Jimmy is walking back to the jail with his pail of stew when he bumps into Bert coming out of the saloon. When Bert and his buddy Hoag (Bill Catching) discover the meal is for the Cartwrights, they start dumping dirt and a cigar into it. Jimmy's cries bring Lassiter running. He knocks both men aside. Bert falls to the ground and loses his gun. As he reaches to pick it up, Hoss steps on his hand. Fred calls an end to the fight and the men return to the saloon. Jimmy's upset about the stew and Hoss tells him not to worry about it. But Lassiter sends him back to Sally's telling him to finish what he started. Hoss asks who's side Lassiter is on. Lassiter says he thinks the wrong people are in jail in this town. Hoss explains that things couldn't have happened the way Sally said they did. He doesn't think she's lying, but must be mistaken. Ben and Adam were firing at the murderer. Duece could've been coerced, scared or bribed, for his statement. Lassiter asks about the petition and the newspaper. Hoss assures him they'll get enough signatures, especially with the newspaper coming out. Fred overheard this.

Joe runs up. He's suspicious of Lassiter, but Hoss vouches for him. Joe says Barney never went to the mines for signatures. They're going to go look for Barney at his house. Before they go, Lassiter asks, if all else fails, are they planning a small revolution. Hoss just says, ""Yup."" Lassiter asks them to hold off for as long as they can.

Sally is getting Jimmy some more stew and promises that Mr. Hawkins will take care of the men who did this. Jimmy doesn't believe that. Sally explains that Mr. Hawkins can't be responsible for the actions of his men. Lassiter has returned and hears this. He disagrees. ""As a rule, you can usually tell a man by the men around him.""

Fred and Bert go to the newspaper office. The threaten Baxter with cutting him and pouring hot lead on him to stop the printing.

Hoss and Joe find Barney sitting in his dark parlor with his wife and daughter. He says he had to stop getting signatures because Hawkins men threatened his family. Joe accuses him of running and hiding in a house he wouldn't even have if not for Ben. Hoss asks how many signatures he did get. Barney only got five and Hawkins men made him scratch his own name off. Hoss and Joe are disgusted with the cowardice and take the petition themselves. But everyone they approach refuses to sign. They're all afraid of Hawkins and Hawkins men are tailing Hoss and Joe just to add to the fear. Hoss and Joe even go to the saloon. The bartender won't sign either. Joe promises to protect him. Gil knows they mean that, and he knows they will. Every day but one. Bert teases that he'll sign it, but Hoss is in no mood and shoves Bert across the room. He and Joe start to leave. Lassiter bursts in, gun drawn and ready to fire. Hoss and Joe turn to see Bert, still on the floor, but ready to shoot them in the back. All three back out of the saloon and Joe thanks Lassiter for the help.

Next, Hoss and Joe go to the paper, but they find Baxter frozen in fear. They know their time is up and head back to the stables to get their guns.

Hawkins (Richard Devon) finally arrives and checks in with Fred in the saloon. Fred says they put a stop to the petition and the paper. Hawkins notices Bert's bandaged hand and asks about it. Both Fred and Bert wave it off as nothing. There's a stranger in town, but nothing to worry about.

Lassiter goes back to Sally's. Jimmy comes in depressed. He didn't get the stew to the jail in time. They were tying Ben's and Adam's hands and it was too late. Sally consoles him saying he tried. But Jimmy wanted to do something nice for the Cartwrights. Now he'll never get a chance to pay them back. When his parents were sick and nearly died, Mr. Cartwright brought him a horse and said it was a Christmas present, even though it was June. He just wanted to pay Ben back and now he can't. Lassiter assures him that Ben knows and sends the boy home promising everything will be alright. Then he looks out the door and tells Sally she'll have a good view of the hanging. She says she wants them to hang, but that doesn't mean she wants to see it. She goes back to the kitchen. Lassiter says the sound will carry and that's almost as bad as seeing it. He describes it to her and looks out the back window she says she saw the shooting from. It's so dirty she couldn't have seen anything. He thinks Duece told her what happened and she believed him. She argues that she's lost enough. Her pa was killed. ""I thought you were my friend!"" Lassiter says he is her friend and that's why he won't let her do this. He once saw an innocent man hanged and now he's looking for the men who did it. He believes she knows in her heart that the Cartwrights didn't kill her father. She runs from the room.

Ben and Adam are brought out to the scaffolding. They bravely climb the steps. Joe and Hoss are at the stables, rifles ready. Joe wants to start, but Hoss holds him back. They promised to wait to the last minute.

Lassiter is describing things to Sally as he looks out the door. Finally she comes to look too and can't stand the sight of Ben and Adam with the ropes around their necks. She admits that she didn't see it happen. Lassiter tells her to hurry and tell the sheriff. She runs across the street calling to him, calling out the truth. Hawkins tells her to stay out of it. Lassiter realizes that Hawkins is one of the men he's looking for. He asks if Hawkins remembers him from another hanging in Lassiter, Kansas. Hawkins goes for his gun, but Lassiter is faster. A gun fight breaks out and Hoss and Joe shoot some of Hawkins men to protect Lassiter. The sheriff ends it and releases Ben and Adam, then takes the surviving Hawkins men away.

Ben gives Hoss' and Joe's arms a squeeze and Joe teases, ""Aren't you glad we didn't wait til the last minute.""

The next day, as Lassiter is leaving, he meets Sally. She thanks him for not letting her do the wrong thing. ""You made it right"" he tells her. Then he meets the Cartwrights. Ben thanks him and offers him a job on the Ponderosa, now that he's found the man he was looking for. Lassiter says Hawkins was only one and there are more he needs to find. After Lassiter rides away, Ben tells the boys he wouldn't want to be one of the men Lassiter is after."

Whitehead) and Johnny (Robert Nichols) have just delivered a herd to San Francisco. After giving the men a bonus and a reminder that he's buying dinner, Ben sends them off to enjoy the city. Hamp and Johnny promptly get drunk. Out on the street, Johnny says he wants to buy his wife a bolt of silk. A man overhears them and claims he's an importer and they should come with him to see his stock. When they get to a shop near the docks, two thugs knock Hamp and Johnny out. They've just been shanghai'd

Ben's getting a little worried when Hamp and Johnny don't arrive for dinner. Then Hop Sing knocks on the door and reports that his #3 cousin saw two cowboys get hit on the head and dragged away. He thinks it was Hamp and Johnny. The Cartwrights go to check on it.

Cut-rate Joe (Murvyn Vye,) the supposed silk dealer, is really a dealer in shanghai'd sailors. He tells his two thugs that he needs four more men by midnight. He looks down at the two unconscious cowboys and wonders what he can do to make them look more like sailors.

After searching around the Barbary Coast for a while, Ben decides he's going to the police. He warns Hoss and Joe to be careful and tells Hop Sing to stay with them. When he gets to the police station, the sergeant (Stephen Roberts) isn't terribly concerned about the two missing men. He recommends Ben hire more men to replace them. Ben angrily informs him that he'll find his men with or without the police's help. The sergeant merely says, ""Go right ahead,"" and returns to his paperwork.

Hoss, Joe, and Hop Sing aren't having any luck asking about the cowboys. Nobody will tell them anything. They decide to split up and take opposite sides of the streets. Joe thinks Hop Sing should go check with his cousins again. Hop Sing doesn't like the idea of leaving the boys alone, but both say they've heard the Barbary Coast can be fun. They split up. Hoss immediately finds a man even bigger than he is and the two start circling each other sizing each other up. Joe, on the other hand, enters Pig Eye Pete's. He asks the bartender (Herb Vigran) if he's seen two cowboys. Herb isn't helpful either and tells Joe he's too young to be there. Joe starts to protest, but Herb pulls out a big mallet and two thugs (Michael Ross and Don Rhodes) at the end of the bar are paying attention. Joe thinks it's best to leave.

Joe comes out of the bar just as Ben finds him. He's angry that they split up, but they quickly find Hoss, shirtless, ready to fight the big man. They've drawn quite a crowd and with one solid punch, Hoss bring Busthead Brannigan (Tor Johnson) down and wins $100. Ben's angry that Hoss has gotten into trouble, but Hoss assures him he's not. This was a boxing match against the local champion, who he's now trying to revive. Hop Sing rushes up with his Cousin #3 (James Hong). #3 is glad to meet Hoss, cuz Hoss just won him $100. Then Hop Sing warns them that word is up and down the Barbary Coast that they're asking too many questions. Ben says they can't just barge in and act like they're going to tear the place up. He sends Hoss and Joe back to the hotel and keeps Hop Sing and his cousin with him.

Ben also goes into Pig Eye Pete's, leaving Hop Sing and #3 outside to wait. He orders a drink and outrageously compliments the bartender. When he finally asks if Herb has seen his two friends, Herb gives a quick nod to the thugs at the end of the bar. Rhodes walks away to get the boss. Herb stalls. Alexander Pendleton (David White) arrives and escorts Ben to the end of the bar where it's quieter. He says the men were there but they left. At his signal, Herb pulls a handle and a trap door under Ben opens up. He falls into the water below. Herb asks if Pendleton knows what he's doing. He's had enough trouble with the two cowboys he bought from Cut-Rate Joe and now he just dumped their boss. Pendleton says he still needs three more men.

Hop Sing and #3 go back to the hotel and tell Hoss and Joe that Ben went into a bar and never came back. The boys take off.

Ben is led into a room where Hamp and Johnny are also being held. Pendleton, a.k.a Shanghai Pete, brings in Captain Sharp (Richard Deacon) to sell him the new sailors. Sharp peeks through a slot in the door and wants to know why there are only three. Ben offers to pay Pendleton twice whatever the captain is offering. Pendleton is tempted, but the captain says they have a contract and if Pete's wants his future business he'll stick to the contract. Pendleton refuses Ben's offer even when Ben ups it to three times the price. Sharp says that Ben isn't drunk and therefore doesn't want him, but he'll take Hamp and Johnny. He says if Pete doesn't have three more men in an hour, he's going to Cut-Rate Joe's.

Kathleen (Kathleen Crowley) brings Ben some dinner. She's a waitress at Pig Eye Pete's. Ben turns on the charm and asks what a nice girl like her is doing in a place like this. She admits she's considered that question before and has decided it's the money. He offers her $500 if she helps him escape and find his men. She agrees and says she'll be back for him later.

Hop Sing reports that #5 Cousin never saw Ben leave Pig Eye Pete's and to make matters worse, #6 Cousin, who works on the docks, says one ship that was shorthanded now has a crew. He's afraid Mr. Ben now a sailor man. Hoss is ready to bust some heads and marches into Pig Eye Pete's. He demands to know where his pa is. Ross and Rhodes, the two thugs, start to move toward him, but Hoss pulls his gun. Pendleton arrives and assures him that Ben did leave. He calms Hoss down and walks him to the end of the bar. Down the hatch he goes.

A man is waiting below to help Hoss out, but Hoss pulls him in too and starts dunking him to get answers from him. He has a feeling the man was down there waiting for him, dunk. And he thinks he wasn't the only member of his family to come down that hole, dunk. He asks the man if he's seen a man with gray hair, dark eyes and a deep voice. ""I don't remember."" Dunk. ""You better start remembering cuz I'm a cowboy. I ain't no sailor. I like dry land and I can think of one way to get it and that's holding you under til you drink all the water in this place!"" Dunk. The man says he's starting to remember and Hoss says that's good, ""You just took the first step to establishing the basis of a friendship between me and you. Now, where's my pa?""

Kathleen takes the opportunity to get Ben out. She leads him to a ""friend's"" house, but it's really Cut-Rate Joe's and she's Quick Buck Katie. She offers to sell Ben for $100. Ben is stunned, particularly because he offered her $500. She says she knows he'll turn her over to the police. She raises her fee to $150. Cut-Rate Joe refuses and she settles for $75. As she leaves, she assures Ben that he'll see his friends.

Kathleen returns to Pendleton's and reports that she sold Ben to Cut-Rate for $25. Since Capt Sharp already refused Ben, Pendleton thinks it's funny that Cut-Rate will be stuck with him. Besides, he's got an even bigger Cartwright. Hoss enters bashing people as he goes. He hauls Pendleton up over his head and demands to know where Ben is.

Joe is down by the water searching when Hop Sing comes up and reports that Hoss went into the bar and never came out. Right then, the door they're next to bursts open and a man comes tumbling out. Joe goes in to find Hoss beating people up. He joins right in.

Meanwhile, Capt Sharp is telling Cut-Rate that he already refused Ben because he's not drunk. He's a temperance man. But any man who's foolish enough to get drunk deserves whatever happens to him. He will not take a sober man and turns his back. Ben is clubbed and a bottle of whiskey poured over him. Sharp turns around to see Ben staggering and smelling of whiskey. He takes him for $100.

After Hoss has knocked everyone out, Joe demands answers from Kathleen. He has to do some arm twisting, but she finally admits she sold him to Cut-Rate. Hoss is stunned, but wants to know how much she sold him for. Joe drags him away. They go to Cut-Rate's and get more answers. Then Hop Sing reports that #3 Cousin saw Ben being taken aboard a ship.

Ben wakes up next to Hamp and Johnny. They are tied together, but Ben is loose and demands to see the captain. He starts yelling at the captain. Hoss, Joe and Hop Sing are now on the docks and Hoss is glad to hear Ben's voice. And the fight is on. Sailors are going every which way and the Cartwrights and Hop Sing win.

At the hotel, the boys are tending their black eyes and Hoss wants to know how much Kathleen got for Ben. He won't answer. Hop Sing arrives, also with a black eye, and says #7 Cousin is in the silk business and gives a bolt to Johnny. Then he says #9 Cousin is a chef in the hotel and they're going to have a delicious meal. But he'll serve it in the room because he doesn't want them getting into any more trouble. Hoss asks one last time how much Kathleen got for Ben and he just glares at Hoss."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529507/?ref_=ttep_ep29,,"A neighboring rancher, Andy, is good friends with Ben, but his son (Todd) wants to sell their land for mining operations which will spoil the water rights agreement that Andy and Ben made years ago.",[],TV-G,Release date,['George Blair'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Ben and Adam find their neighbor Todd McCarren (Don Dubbins) surveying the property line. Todd says, rudely, that the new owner might be interested in the line. Ben's surprised to hear that Todd's father is thinking of selling. They've had an agreement on water rights ever since Todd's family arrived. Todd doesn't care. He's the one selling the land, not his father. And what the new owner, Len Keith, does to Ben's down stream property isn't Todd's problem.

Ben goes to talk to Todd's father Andy (Rhys Williams). Andy's a friendly man and admits that he did turn the ranch over to Todd since he physically can't keep up, but he assures Ben that Todd won't really sell the land he was raised on. Ben's glad because he always thought the water rights would out last both of them. Todd comes in and accuses Ben of going behind his back. He thinks Ben's there reminding Andy of all their old favors so that Todd won't sell. Andy is upset with Todd's behavior and actually slaps him. Todd storms out. Andy apologizes and says that Todd's future father in law, Len Keith, has Todd thinking there might be silver on the land. Ben doesn't think there's silver there and neither does Andy, but Len's got Todd thinking it might be there.

Todd goes to Len's house. He's engaged to Len's daughter, Virginia (Merry Anders). She greets him, but Todd is anxious to speak to her father. Len (Robert Simon) isn't overly concerned about Ben's involvement, but Todd says Ben is doing Andy's thinking for him. Virginia finds that hard to believe. The Cartwrights have always been decent people. Todd says that's socially, not business.

Later that evening, Len goes to visit Ben and tries to convince him to talk Andy into selling the land, for Todd's sake. Ben says Andy's perfectly capable of making up his own mind and he doesn't see how keeping the land will hurt Todd. On the other had, he's seen Len ruin men before and he doesn't want to see Len hurt Todd too. Len says he always tries reason first, but if that doesn't work there are other ways.

At the dance that night, Todd picks a fight with Adam. Adam tries to walk away, but Todd grabs him and the fight starts. Virginia calls for help and the Cartwrights break it up. Virginia asks her father to take her home and they go outside. Adam follows shortly after to apologize, but Len rushes her off.

At their ranch, Len's foreman, Tucker (Kenneth Becker) is waiting for them and takes Len over to the bunkhouse. Roy (Frank Watkins) is beating another man up. They blame the man for bringing in a herd that is infected with Texas Fever, a highly contagious cattle disease. The only way to keep it from spreading is to kill off the infected cattle and burn them. Len tells Roy to take the man out and see that he doesn't come back, but he tells Tucker not to kill any of the herd yet. He's going to make a gift of them to the Cartwrights.

It doesn't take the Cartwrights long to discover the infected cattle. But rather than killing and burning the cattle, Ben thinks a bath in sulfur soap will rid them of the ticks that spread the disease and maybe they can keep it from spreading further. He tells Hoss to go get as much sulfur as he can. Joe will cut out the cattle that even look sick, while he and Adam dig pits to push the cattle through.

Virginia goes to town and finds Todd in a saloon. He comes out to talk to her and accuses her of siding with the Cartwrights. She doesn't see it that way, but doesn't like the man Todd is becoming. Next she goes to see Andy. She says she thought Todd wanted to treat the land as their future, for themselves and their children. Andy tells her to keep her faith in Todd.

Tucker and Roy have followed Hoss and learned about the sulfur bath idea. They don't know what good it'll do, but figure they should stop it. As Hoss pulls a wagonload of sulfur, they shoot at him. Hoss takes cover and fires back, but Joe comes to the rescue and shoots Roy. Tucker takes off. Neither Hoss nor Joe knows who Roy is, but they find an envelope on him with his name. But since more cattle are getting infected, their first priority is to get the sulfur to the Ponderosa.

Len goes to town and tells Todd, acting all innocent and ignorant, that there's a plague on the Ponderosa cattle. He says two of his men went to offer help and the Cartwrights shot one, obviously to keep things quiet. Todd is legitimately worried and knows the Cartwrights should kill their herd. He also knows they won't. He says the only way to protect the other herds is to do what the Cartwrights won't. He says he'll rally the other ranchers to do what must be done.

The Cartwrights are pushing cattle through the sulfur bath when Hoss rides up with Roy's horse. It's covered with ticks too. Adam goes to town to discover who Roy is. The bartender (Cosmo Sardo) doesn't really know Roy, but he was always with Len's foreman, Tucker.

Adam goes to Len's bunkhouse and finds Tucker. He says he suspects Tucker of being with Roy when Hoss was shot at. Tucker pulls a rifle and Adam shoots him. Adam's shot is only a wound, but a second shot rings out and Tucker is killed. Len shot him and Virginia saw the whole thing. Adam said he wanted Tucker alive to talk, but accuses Len of being a fast thinker. He leaves and Virginia accuses her father of intentionally killing Tucker. Len claims he was protecting Adam.

Todd has a meeting with the ranchers and many are upset about the plague, but a few refuse to go against the Cartwrights. Those that will say they'll meet in the morning with rifles. Virginia arrives as the meeting is breaking up. She asks Todd if he knows how it started. Todd says it doesn't matter, it just can't be allowed to spread. She says she thinks, and Adam agrees, that her father brought the plague to the Ponderosa cattle. Again Todd says it doesn't matter how it started, he has to protect the other herds. She won't believe that. The Cartwrights have always been their friends and what the Cartwrights need is help, not threats. She accuses Todd of doing this to make a big name for himself, not to help the ranchers.

The next morning the ranchers, Todd, and Len ride up to the Ponderosa where the Cartwrights are running cattle through the sulfur bath. Ben tells them that the sulfur is working, but if any of his cattle do become infected he'll kill them himself. Todd is ready for a fight and pulls his gun. Adam hauls him off his horse. Len encourages Todd to shoot and Todd and Adam square off. Virginia and Andy ride up in a wagon and place themselves between the two. Todd tells Virginia to move, but she won't. Andy says if Todd's about to become a killer he can start by killing him. He tells the ranchers that they passed some of the herds and some of their cattle have gotten the fever. He tells Todd that they have to go take care of their own herd. Len says Ben's to blame for this and some of the ranchers want to start killing Cartwright cattle. Ben tells them again that the sulfur dip is working and they're more than welcome to use it for their own cattle. Virginia accuses her father of starting the plague so he could take all their land. Adam backs her and Len goes for his gun. Adam is faster and kills Len.

The Cartwrights run all the local cattle through the sulfur bath, including Todd's herd."

Nonetheless, he has no choice and angrily goes to gather his things.

Billy isn't a happy guest of the Ponderosa and refuses all Ben's good will. After Hop Sing says Billy stole a large, dangerous knife from the kitchen, Ben sighs. He's going to have to discipline the boy. Hoss asks to be allowed to talk with Billy. He finds Billy outside trying to throw the knife like a dagger. Hoss explains that it's a carving knife, not a throwing knife. Billy admits he took it from the kitchen. Hoss says he'll return the kinfe and once Hop Sing calms down, Billy can apologize. He offers Billy his pocket knife for whittling. Billy doesn't want charity, but Hoss says Billy will earn it with chores. In the meantime, Billy can keep it. He's won the boy's trust.

That evening, Billy has cut himself with the knife and tries to hide the cut from Hoss, but Hoss knows about it and takes the blame. He shouldn't have given Billy a tool without showing Billy how to use it. Billy really likes Hoss now and shows him a secret. He has a picture of his mother and father. It's the only thing that's his, except for the pocket knife. He tells Hoss that his father will come back for him. Hoss gently tells him that sometimes a man makes a promise that he means to keep, but sometimes he can't.

Two men have escaped prison. Pike (Bob Tetrick) and Billy's father, Vance (Logan Field). They rob a stage and Pike wants to get across the mountains. Vance knows the way, but says he has to go to his family first. He promises he'll be back in two days. If he's not, then Pike can take all the money and go.

Vance finds his wife's grave, then finds Billy at the Ponderosa. That night he climbs through the window and Billy is thrilled to see him. Vance makes him promise not to tell anyone he saw Vance. He asks Billy to gather as much food as he can to to meet him at their secret cave the next night.

Because of the prison break, the Cartwrights are asked to ride posse. Only Hoss stays home with Billy. A neighbor and his young son drop by to sign some papers. While Hoss takes Mr. Sherman (John Eldredge) in to sign, Orville (Philip Grayson) talks with Billy. He tells Billy that Vance is nothing but a convict. They fight and Hoss and Sherman break it up. Hoss is sorry he didn't tell Billy sooner and gives him a hug. Billy is sure his father will come and explain everything.

That night, Hoss hears Billy sneaking out and follows him. Billy gives his father the food and after spending some time together, Vance sends him back to the Ponderosa. He says they'll meet again tomorrow and leave. Billy goes back and Vance returns to the cave. Hoss is waiting for him. He has to turn Vance in. Vance won't go and in a brief scuffle, Hoss shoots Vance. His first thoughts are for Billy.

Ben has returned from his posse very early in the morning. Hoss comes up behind him with Vance's body thrown across his horse. He doesn't know how he's going to tell Billy. But Billy sees his father and attacks Hoss hitting him in the chest and crying ""I hate you."" It nearly kills Hoss and Ben gently pulls the boy away.

Later, Hoss is outside feeling terrible. Ben tries to comfort him. Hoss says he can still feel the little fists hitting him. He's so big and strong he can do most anything, but he'd cut off both his hands if it would help the boy. He begs to know why God won't tell him what to say to Billy. Ben says there's nothing he can say. Billy will just have to learn to understand.

Hoss and Billy ride in a wagon, taking the body into town. They stop to rest the horses. Pike is there and threatens to kill Billy if Hoss doesn't show him through the mountains. Hoss attacks Pike and yells for Billy to run. Billy runs, but not far. He hides behind a tree and watches as Pike knocks Hoss over the head with the gun. Then he runs on. The Cartwrights are just coming that way and are surprised to find Billy alone. Billy says Hoss is with the man that was with his father and he hopes the man kills Hoss. Ben is very upset but does his best to explain that Vance loved Billy as a father should. Well, Hoss is his son and he loves him. He pleads with Billy to tell him where Hoss is. Billy does.

Hoss is revived and still refuses to show Pike through the hills. They fight again and the gun goes off between them. Pike is dead. The Cartwrights find Hoss collapsed near the wagon. While they check on Hoss, Billy runs off. When they discover him gone, Hoss goes after him. He finds Billy sitting by the lake. Billy is surprised that Hoss is alive. He asks if his father was like Pike. Hoss tells him that his father loved him and that he came back for Billy. This cheers him and Billy asks to stay at the Ponderosa until his uncle comes. He takes Hoss' hand as they walk back."

The doctor (Grandon Rhodes) has examined her and tells the Cartwrights to give a her night's rest and some food then send her on her way. They don't know where her people are, so the doc suggests they turn her over to the sheriff. When Joe protests that she hasn't done anything, the doc says she will. Joe goes to check on her, but she only wants him to go away. When Joe won't leave, she bites his hand.

That night Joe hears the front door close and looks out his window to see the gypsy girl outside. He joins her and she won't look at him. She points to the North Star and says she wants to take. She talks about the darkness being the inside of a bell that rings forth the spirits of the dead. Joe asks about her people, but she claims she has no one. She asks why Joe cares. Is it because she's pretty? Joe thinks she's strange. She accuses Joe of being a little boy, while she is old, withered, dead.

Ben asks what she'd like to be. She says she wants to be free. Then she grabs the tablecloth and pulls it from the table and runs screaming out the door. Her wild behavior spooks Hoss and Joe's horses. She runs the other way and Joe follows. She stumbles again and Joe drops down beside her. She grabs his gun. He holds her still and asks why she wants to kill herself. ""I'm a witch. It is the dark star.""

Later, the gypsies roll in. Hoss thinks they're making camp, but Ben thinks they've just come for the girl. She comes out and says they haven't come for her. Ben doesn't understand, but intends to take her back. She won't go, so Ben and Hoss go to see the gypsies alone.

The gypsy leader, Zorka (Hugo Haas), wants to camp on the Ponderosa until the sky clears. Ben repeatedly brings up the girl, but Zorka avoids talking about her, but admits she brings misfortune. Ben accuses him of leaving her to die. Zorka says they only left her behind. Ben says they can stay on the Ponderosa if they take the girl with them when they go. Zorka offers to sell Ben some horses. Ben's a good judge of horseflesh and doesn't fall for the gypsies old horses. Although one gypsy is offended that Ben and Hoss have accused them of fixing the horses to look younger, Zorka simply asks them to dinner. They're celebrating All Hallow's Eve. Ben tries to decline, but Zorka insists and tells Ben to bring the pig. Ben still refuses and Zorka accepts it. Ben reminds him to leave when the weather clears and with the girl.

Joe finds the girl by a pool of water and finally learns her name, Tirza (Susan Harrison). She starts talking crazy again and Joe asks what she meant about the dark star and why she tried to kill herself. After some more talk about wanting to be a fish, she finally says it's because she's a witch. A gypsy man rides up, Spiro (Arthur Batanides). Joe introduces himself, but Spiro tells him to go run his kingdom. He apologizes to Tirza saying he didn't know she was left behind. He might've been able to stop it. She accuses, ""And all you'd want for that service is to hold me in your arms for all the nights that are to come."" He tries to kiss her. Joe comes to her rescue and there's a brief fight. Spiro pulls a knife, so Joe pulls his gun. Spiro warns Joe that it's his face that will be the last one Joe sees, but leaves.

At dinner, Hoss comes in and reports a missing pig. Ben intends to make Zorka pay for the pig. Hoss and Joe think watching Ben negotiate with Zorka will be great fun, but Adam says he'll stay home in case the gypsies pull a wagon up to the house and walk out with all the furniture.

Zorka offers to pay for the pig with a silver bowl which is much more valuable than the pig. Ben has to refuse that, but Zorka offers him to at least enjoy some pork. While eating, Ben asks why they think Tirza is a witch. Zorka says she was born under a dark star and can turn herself into a wolf. While they're talking Tirza comes in and starts dancing. Joe's enthralled, as is Spiro. But then lightning flashes and everyone is afraid. Tirza runs off and Joe follows. Zorka warns Ben not to let Joe go after her, but Ben knows Joe can take care of himself.

Joe catches up to Tirza by a large rock. Joe asks why she came to dance in camp and she says she likes to see the fear in their faces. He assures her she's not a witch. She says Joe is a tree with his feet firmly planted in the ground. She'd like to be a tree and spread her branches out to protect the children. She asks if Joe thinks she's beautiful. He kisses her. Spiro has also followed them and witnesses this. He raises his rifle and takes aim. But a wolf howls and he leaves.

Tirza wakes up in her bed at the Ponderosas. There are chicken feathers and bloody wolf prints on her bed. She runs to Zorka and begs him to help her. He tells her it will be quite painful, but she wants to be like the others.

Tirza didn't close the front door when she ran and it bangs shut waking Joe. He investigates and finds her gone so he goes to the gypsy camp. Only Spiro is there. Spiro tells him that Tirza turned herself into a wolf and killed the chickens. She's going to go through a ceremony that will pick at her soul until they can remove the evil. Joe starts to leave, but Spiro pulls out a whip and stops him. Everytime Joe tries to go for his gun, Spiro whips him. Finally they fight hand to hand. Spiro pulls his knife and as they fight for control, the knife goes into Spiro.

Joe gets to the ceremonial grounds to find Tirza staked to the ground. Two gypsies hold him back so he can do nothing but watch the ceremony. She tells Joe she wants this and when the ceremony climaxes, Joe breaks free and goes to her. She tells him she's now free. Joe takes her back to the Ponderosa.

At breakfast, Joe tells Ben he wants to marry Tirza. Ben is agreeable, but Zorka arrives and says the weather has cleared so he's come for the girl. Joe tells him that Tirza is going to stay with him. Tirza says she's not. She has waited so long to see love in their eyes, not hate and fear. She's finally a fish swimming with the others. Joe wants her to stay, but she tells him, ""You're a tree, not a fish."" She leaves. Zorka apologizes for Spiro. They found a wolf paw with blood still on it and they should've recognized the devil in him. Ben and Joe watch the gypsies move off."
