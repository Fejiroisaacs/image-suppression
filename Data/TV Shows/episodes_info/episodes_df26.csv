Thanks to Jonathan, this word processor has the power to grant any wish that Richard desires.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Michael Gornick'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"A word processor takes center stage as Richard Hagstrom and his friendly neighbor, Mr. Nordhoff, bring this motley group of slightly-related parts into Richard's home as a gift from his tech-savvy nephew, Jonathan, who was recently killed as Richard's overbearing brother, Roger, recklessly plunged his vehicle off a cliff in a fireball killing himself, his wife, Belinda, and their fifteen-year old son, Jonathan. Belinda was Richard's true love before Roger bullied him out of the relationship. Instead, Richard settled for a non-romantic endeavor with an obnoxious nag of a wife, Lina, and their sole, self-ingratiating son, Seth, who was absorbed totally in making appalling guitar music and hanging out with equally dreadful friends. During Richard's time checking out this makeshift conglomeration of seemingly random electrical parts assembled with no clear attempt to be unified logically, his sole interest was in determining if the any of this processor mechanism really worked better than his antiquated electric typewriter. Jonathan had jokingly implied that rather than allow his uncle to spend thousands of dollars he did not have, he would build him one. He said it rather in jest, but here it was - Jonathan's creation, humming and buzzing with the first surprise message on the screen: Happy Birthday, Uncle Richard! Jon. Richard was touched and continued to be amazed as the word processor hummed and smoked ominously. It didn't seem to be a finished product. After all, Jonathan's time building it was cut all too short by the irresponsibility of his inebriated, worthless father. Richard's desire to write more, faster, and better was incessantly interrupted by his acerbic relationship with both spouse and son, and his refuge was in his study where his freedom to discern what could have been as opposed to what is remained his solitary solace. It was during these hours of reflection that his awareness of a strange phenomenon revealed itself about the word processor. Whatever commands he typed and executed became reality, and delete not only removed the object from the screen but also from all existence as if it and anything associated with it had never been. Richard toyed with pictures on the wall and conjured doubloons until he heard the voice of his son and his friends in their own denigrating way. In one desperate moment after all due consideration, he hit delete. The quiet was deafening as Seth and his noisy friends disappeared from ever having existed, including the scrawled initials carved into new furniture. Nothing remained of what they ever were. Richard felt somewhat panicked when he heard Lina - a much bigger Lina than the one who left to go to bingo - returning with turkeys for him to put in the Amana freezer he did not know he would own in this totally different world with no children on this different track set by fate and a magic-like word processor. But it was humming, smoking, and shaking itself apart as quickly as Lina's insults flowed uninhibitedly from her lips dripping with sarcasm. There was little time to waste for him to gather whatever he wanted of life to insert and execute and increasingly less time remaining to delete anything unsavory left in life. The flood of options raced before his fingers could touch any of the now loosely vibrating keys. Thoughts of Lina, Belinda, and Jonathan interspersed themselves with fantasies of novel ideas and untold wealth at the same instant Richard made his last entry and the processor blew itself to data heaven. When the smoke cleared, Richard's life was the way he had wished it would be before the Word Processor of the Gods intervened."

As his daughter Ma and grandson Jody Tolliver sit down for breakfast, however, they watch in astonishment as Titus comes downstairs to join them. As Titus rests outside on the porch, Ma brings Dr. Snodgrass over, who confirms that the old man is dead is dead but is unable to convince him of that fact. After lunch Reverend Peabody stops by, but is similarly frustrated by Titus's stubbornness. With Titus decaying in the heat, Jody leaves to consult with the local voodoo woman, who gives him a handkerchief filled with black pepper. When Titus sits down for dinner, Jody tricks him into using the napkin, which causes him to sneeze his nose off of his face. Finally convinced that he is dead, Titus shuffles upstairs and passes on."

Hiker Sybil has just broken up with her boyfriend, so they invite her to join them.",[],TV-14,Release date,['John Strysik'],"['', '']",[],"['hot tub', 'cannibalism', 'vegtables in water', 'old age couple', 'human skull', 'big wooden spoon', 'porch', 'human stew']",[],"Out in the country, on the porch of a lone house, Henry Colander is napping on the porch. His wife Elinor calls in for dinner. He comes in and set the table, and cuts his finger on a dinner knife. The two of them bicker back and forth, and Elinor reminds Henry that their twenty-fifth anniversary is coming up. Elinor talks about how she misses their children, and wishes they could have more. Henry says that anything's possible, and Elinor tells him he's such a dreamer.

The next morning, Elinor is on the porch shucking peas when two hikers, Sybil and Mark approach. Mark is rude to Elinor, while Sybil tries to be polite. Elinor lets the couple stay there rather than out in their orchard as they did the previous night, Mark continues to be rude, and Henry finally comes out with a shotgun. Sybil suggests they leave, and Elinor tells her she's always welcome to come back and stay with them if she has any trouble.

Later, Elinor inside cutting meat for dinner. Henry is with her as she wonders if Sybil will come back. Elinor tells him to check on the wine casks, and after some light-hearted complaining, he goes. Sybil comes back and says that she left Mark, and Elinor says that Sybil reminds her of one of their children, and all of their children left but it still feels like part of them is with them. She then offers Sybil a shower after her hiking, and Sybil accepts.

After the shower, she has some stew with Elinor. Henry comes in and Elinor tells him that she's been talking with Sybil, and Sybil ran away from home two years ago. Elinor points out that Sybil reminds her of one of their children, Henry agrees to let Sybil stay with them. They show her their children's' playroom, with stuffed animal heads, rifles, and a large hot tub that Henry built for their children. They offer Sybil the chance to try out the tub, and she accepts.

As Sybil goes to change into her suit, Henry tries to turn on the tub. It doesn't work, and Elinor complains until Henry kicks it and it sits. Sybil comes back in and gets in to the hot tub, and the couple says that their anniversary will be just like it was before their children left.

Later, Sybil joins the couple on the porch and they assure her that her being there is the only gift they need for their anniversary. Henry talks about the poor quality of the stew meat they've been getting from their butcher, and that he doesn't know how to properly kill the animal. The butcher has to respect the animal, and if it dies afraid than it poisons the meat. They say they're going into town to get the meat, and Elinor tells her to sleep in while they're gone.

The next morning, Sybil wakes up alone and turns on the tub. She touches a lock on the wall, and Henry comes in and yells at her for snooping. Sybil goes out and finds Elinor in the kitchen, and apologizes for ruining their anniversary. Elinor assures Sybil that she didn't, and she'll go calm Henry down. As Elinor leaves, Sybil notices a large wooden spoon on the wall.

Henry comes back in and apologizes to Sybil for yelling at her. He pours her some homemade sherry for her and tells her that she can soak in the tub. Sybil goes back in and soaks in the tub. Elinor comes in and throws some vegetables in the hot water while carrying the spoon, saying she brought Sybil a snack to have with the sherry. Elinor pours the rest of the sherry wine in, and Henry comes in. Sybil says that he's not scared of him.

A drunken Sybil passes out, dropping her sherry into the tub. The couple looks on, unsurprised. Elinor starts stirring with the spoon, and Sybil's body floats to the surface. Elinor tells Henry to pour the sherry in, and once he does so then the couple unlocks the hidden door, revealing six skulls bleached clean. Elinor says that she loves having the children for dinner."

At that time, it was not uncommon for an early episode of a new comedy series to include homosexual themes (qv, ""The Facts of Life""). In this case, Mel tells Alice that his college roommate, * a well-known ex-quarterback, is passing through and will stop by for a visit. Mel wants to get them together.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work, because Jack -- played by Denny Miller -- tells her he's queer. (This was around the time of revelations that a number of well-known athletes were gay or bisexual.) Alice's son Tommy, knowing nothing of this, and excited at meeting a famous athlete, wants to go fishing with Jack. Alice is torn, because she assumes gay men are child molesters, but decides to let them go fishing. Nothing happens, of course, but Tommy admits to being disappointed that Jack wasn't very good at fishing.

""All in the Family"" had a similar episode where one of the bar regulars was a gay ex-football player who owned a photo shop -- shades of Harvey Milk!

* It is later established that Mel never attended college."

Rimmer, Third Technician and Second technician, respectively. Lister is an apathetic lay-about and Rimmer is a pompous workaholic, both have their ambitions, Lister's is to buy land on Fiji and raise family there, Rimmer's is to pass the astro-engineering exams and become an officer.

Both are on their rounds fixing the non-essential electronics on the ship, while off-duty Rimmer is preparing for another exam by copying textbook answers onto his body, they are invited to the welcoming back of a deceased officer, George Mcintyre, having being resurrected as a hologram image by the ship's computer Holly, but only one hologram can be sustained at any time. Rimmer attends the exams, and Lister feeds his pregnant pet cat, Frankenstein, whom he smuggled aboard. During the exam Rimmer consults the answers on his body, but the sweat has rendered them illegible, Lister is called to the Captain's office, the cat is discovered and has not been quarantined, a grave offense on board starships. Lister explains he's taking the cat home to Earth and he's given a choice to hand over the cat to be tested in the labs or lose eighteen months wages and time in stasis.

Lister is sent to stasis and awaits release, Holly releases him and Lister finds the ship deserted, he asks Holly where everyone is and Holly tells them they're all dead. Lister is shocked, the cause was because of Rimmer not repairing a drive plate correctly causing a ship-wide radiation leak. Lister was held in stasis for longer until the radiation had died down, three million years exactly. Holly has resurrected Rimmer as a hologram, and the two blame each other for the accident on the ship. Elsewhere on the ship is a third life-form, a humanoid male bearing feline traits, Rimmer and Lister encounter him in the corridors and run off. Holly says that Lister's cat was sealed in the hold, safe from the radiation, and they have bred there for all these millennia and evolved into a new specimen, Felis Sapiens. The man is referred to simply as ""Cat.""

Lister is still convinced they can get back to Earth, and asks Holly to plot a course to Fiji"

The event seems to have stopped and Rimmer leaves.

Later, Cat meets Lister bringing an entire clothes rack with him, not wanting to leave any of his clothes behind. Lister goes into the science room and Rimmer is there, the latter is talking to another Lister who isn't there and leaves. Literally the instant Rimmer leaves another comes in, a startled Lister asks how he did that and Rimmer repeats the previous conversation. He follows Rimmer into the corridor and Cat rushes past clutching his mouth because he lost his tooth, they arrive in the quarters and find Cat there about to eat Lister's fish. Holly is asked what's happening, he says because they're travelling faster than light speed they're witnessing future events, Rimmer spots a photograph on Lister's bunk of Lister holding two babies. Lister hasn't seen the photograph before.

The ship is shaken by a massive explosion, Lister rushes to the science room to investigate where Rimmer tells him he saw Lister die, apparently messing with the consoles. Lister wonders how to avoid his death, it starts with Cat breaking his tooth, Lister rushes the quarters where Cat is about to eat his robot goldfish, he stops him but Cat still breaks his tooth.

Lister upset about dying, according to Rimmer he gets blown up, an alarm is sounded and Holly asks for Lister's help. The navigation computer is overheating and Lister is the only who can repair it, he fixes the machine without consequence. A jubilant Lister returns to the quarters with Rimmer and sees an elderly version of himself on his bunk, aged one-hundred and seventy-one with a cybernetic arm. He tells Lister what really happened, in the future Lister will have twin sons, Jim and Bexley, Rimmer saw Bexley die, the old Lister tells his past self to take a camera to the medical room.

Lister is preparing for a night-out in the quarters and asks Holly why Rimmer was resurrected, according to Holly they know each other best based on the number of words shared, all of which were arguments.

Lister is drinking alone in the ship's disco and reminisces about life before the accident. Rimmer crosses Cat in the corridors, the latter has found the cigarette supply and wants to keep it, Rimmer offers him plenty of fish for returning them. Lister is jamming in the quarters and Rimmer shuts off the music, they climb into their bunks and Lister says he wants to date the late Kristine Kochanski, he asks only twenty-four hours with her for deactivating Rimmer, Rimmer doesn't expect Lister to switch him back on and refuses to hand over her hologram disc.

Lister warns Rimmer he'll pass an exam and become an officer, outranking Rimmer. Rimmer is unmoved. The next morning Lister is gone and Rimmer's right arm is replaced, he has Peterson's arm because his data disk is corrupted, making his physical form glitched. Cat is gorging himself on fish in the science room, Lister is not there. Rimmer finds him in the exam room taking a test, Lister wishes to be a chef, if only because it means outranking Rimmer.

Rimmer takes his own test on astronomy hoping to maintain his position, Cat is slumped on Lister's bunk with a full belly from all the fish. Lister comes in with a cake he made in catering classes, and offers some to Cat, Cat leaves the room about to be sick. Rimmer tries to be chummy with Lister, giving him the location of the cigarettes, it's clear Rimmer is trying to convince Lister not to take the exam, however Lister will go ahead with it.

During the cooking test Kochanski appears, she asks Lister why he didn't tell her how he felt about her, self-esteem was the reasons, then Kochanski's speech seems strange, talking more like Rimmer would. Lister sees he's being duped and throws Rimmer out. After the test, Lister consults a machine for the results, apparently he passed."

Lister is in his bunk reading with his nose, the book is made for the cat race and they read via scents, Rimmer sees him and scoffs at this, Rimmer mentions the unidentified object which Lister believes is just more rocks, Holly informs Rimmer the object is within visual range and goes to see, bumping into Cat in the corridors having a found a yo-yo.

Rimmer sees the object is a pod and orders it reeled in, Cat sees Lister and gives him a holy book he'd requested, the book contains images of Lister, the Cat god, Cloister the Stupid, Lister reveals he is the god of the Cat race, but Cat is doubtful and leaves, Lister asks Holly to translate the holy book when Rimmer rushes in to tell Lister of the pod.

They go to see, Rimmer believes it's the stasis pod of an alien race and wishes to open it, he goes of to bring the skutters and Lister goes into the quarantine room to view to the pod, he discovers it's a Red Dwarf garbage pod with the text eroded off in places, Holly did it as a prank.

In the morning Holly tells Lister of his studies of the holy book, Lister is their god, but like any faith this led to dogma, holy wars over a misinterpreted tradition. The cats built two arks and left Red Dwarf to find the holy land using coordinates misread off an old laundry list of Lister's. One ark flew into an asteroid, the other wandered the universe aimlessly. Lister is distraught over this news.

He goes to tell Rimmer who isn't interested, he's too focused with the ""alien"" pod, Lister goes looking for Cat in the lower levels, Cat is with the man who raised him, a blind priest, he is dying and lost his faith, he asks Cat to burn his sacred hat, part of the holy attire, Cat takes it and wears it because it looks cool. Lister enters the room, the priest begs forgiveness for losing his faith, but Lister consoles him, it's all he can do, he gives the priest his hat back, the priest believes it a miracle and rises to his feet before falling over dead.

The pod is about to be opened, Lister is doing the honors, Rimmer is anticipated, Lister opens the pod and takes out a discarded roast chicken, it takes Rimmer a few seconds to realize the truth."

Lister goes to the sleeping quarters to finish his show which Rimmer interrupts, Rimmer scoffs at Lister's time-wasting and lack of productivity, Lister says he's been productive, he went to the officer's block, this alarms Rimmer as that area is still radioactive, Lister went to look for Kochanski's hologram disk, she dreamt about him, Rimmer climbs into his bunk and they sleep.

In the middle of the night Lister wakes up feeling sick with pneumonia and hobbles to the medical room, he passes out in the corridor, an emergency is sounded and the skutters take Lister to the medical room, Rimmer is directing the examination, Lister wonders why he didn't ask Kochanski out. He had a theory with his friends, the theory was that everyone has two people in their mind, Confidence and Paranoia, Lister is taken to his bed.

Lister is having a fever dream in the sleeping quarters and his hallucinations become real, fish rain down in the sleeping quarters, then a 16th century Warsaw mayor spontaneously combusts, Lister wakes up and Rimmer comes in to tell him of his hallucinations and there are two strangers in the drive room, the personifications of his confidence and paranoia. Confidence is a tall, smooth-talking, showbiz man, Paranoia is pale, judging, morose man. Confidence goes to spend time with Lister, Holly warns of a dust storm outside and all airlocks are sealed, Lister is playing a song he wrote for Kochanski to Confidence, who is naturally amazed, Kochanski is bought up and Lister says he can't find the hologram discs, Confidence assures him he can do anything, Paranoia is telling Rimmer of all of Lister's embarrassing blunders and how much he hates Lister. Lister and Confidence have a plan, they believe they can resurrect Kochanski without deactivating Rimmer, Rimmer still won't tell where her hologram discs are, Lister and Confidence solve it together, they're outside near a solar panel near the sleeping quarters.

The dust storm is over, Lister and Confidence are suited up for the pick-up outside, the medical-unit has been destroyed and Paranoia has disappeared, Lister and Confidence head outside, they find the discs, Confidence admits he destroyed the medical unit, Confidence is still a fever hallucination and curing Lister would mean his departure, he also admits to murdering Paranoia by feeding him into a waste grinder, Lister panics and says to go inside as he's getting hot in his spacesuit, Confidence says he should take his helmet off in an act of over-confidence. He takes his off first and is decompressed.

Lister has the discs and is preparing to resurrect Kochanski, Rimmer warns him he'll be unhappy which proves true, the discs are for Rimmer and a second version appears, the former Rimmer welcomes his clone aboard."

Craig French from Long Island, NY pitched his Crooked Jaw clothing brand. He broke his jaw while playing lacrosse in college. At 26 years old, he started by selling some t-shirts and gradually expanded. He sought $200,000 for a 20% stake. Craig had sold 1,500 units and had his products in 10 stores. However, he failed to secure any orders at a recent trade show. Daymond expressed that Craig was one in ten thousand, but Craig insisted that Daymond could help him secure orders from major retailers. Robert and Harrington opted out due to the low sales of $5,000 in the last 12 months. Daymond and Barbara also opted out, followed by O'Leary.

Robert Allison presented Lifebelt, a device designed to prevent cars from starting unless the driver puts on their seat belt. He requested $500,000 for a 10% stake. Wearing a seat belt can increase the chances of surviving a car crash by 86%. The device costs $229 to install in each car, and it is patented. Robert aimed to license the technology to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Barbara opted out, expressing doubts about Allison's salesmanship abilities. Harrington considered the valuation too high since there were no sales and only the patent had value. Daymond also opted out. O'Leary showed interest in buying the patent for $500,000, but Herjavec offered $1 million. Allison declined the offers.

Susan Knapp pitched A Perfect Pear, a cinnamon-flavored jelly product. She sought $500,000 for a 15% stake. Susan had generated $700,000 in sales over the past 12 months with margins at 2.43%, which could be improved to 10.5%. Her product was available in 650 stores, and she needed the investment for production. She had $100,000 worth of orders. O'Leary offered $500,000 for a 70% stake, while Daymond made the same offer for a 51% stake. Harrington and Herjavec offered a combined investment for a 50% stake. Susan countered at 49% to retain control. Herjavec disagreed with her proposal. Susan ultimately accepted the offer from Harrington and Herjavec.

Mary Ellen Simonsen presented Sticky Note Holder, a product that attached sticky pads to the side of computers. She was seeking $100,000 for a 20% stake. However, since Mary had no sales and was waiting for patents, O'Leary became brutally honest and discouraged the other Sharks from making an offer. Consequently, all the Sharks dropped out.

Mark Furigay, a high school literature teacher from Chicago, pitched Classroom Jams. He had created a teaching aid to improve literature retention in kids. Mark requested $250,000 for a 10% stake. He sold record labels that summarized books, making them easier for teenagers to remember. Mark wanted to retain control of the songs and was not offering a stake in them. The product cost $499, including 30 CDs and a teacher's guide. O'Leary initially asked Mark to leave and instructed the Sharks to offer $250,000 for 100% ownership with a 5% royalty stream to Mark. However, O'Leary called Mark back in and made the offer. Mark expressed his desire for an equal stake in the company, leading Herjavec to offer $250,000 for 100% ownership but with an option to work back to 49% over time and no royalty. When Mark resisted, Herjavec deviated from the other Sharks and offered $250,000 for 51% ownership. Mark appreciated the idea of having five business partners but objected to not having any stake in his own company. He proposed an 8.5% royalty without equity, but the Sharks resisted. Eventually, Mark agreed to a deal with a 5% royalty."

Marian Cruz, Turbobaster. $ 35 K for 30%. A mechanized baster that will replace the traditional baster, the basting brush and other kitchen utensils used at thanksgiving. But she doesn't have a working prototype, only a video of how this will work. She doesn't know how much it will cost to make, but wants to sell it for $ 19.99 for regular and $ 29.99 for stainless steel. As Marian has no idea of her business, O'Leary, Barbara, Herjavec drop out. Harrington sees potential in the eventual product and offers $ 35 K for 100%, with 2% royalty to Marian. Daymon wants 51% for $ 50 K and 2% royalty paid to him. Marian goes with Harrington.

Bryan Parks, Chopstick Art from Eugene Oregon. He is an artist and environmentalist. $100 K for 10%. 25 Bn pairs of chopsticks discarded in the world annually.

In last 12 mths, sales of 30 K units, $ 180K in sales, $ 50 K in profit. She didn't go with a publisher as the first 2 books she gave to a publisher didn't sell well (as they didn't market her properly) and gave a poor royalty. Lori has invested $ 200K of her own money. Lori wants to use the money for more advertising on Amazon, Barnes and Noble and so on. Herjavec says that since Lori doesn't have an inventory issue, he is out & so is Harrington. O'Leary offers $250 K for 100% and when Lori refuses, he opts out. Daymon offers $ 250 K for 51% and Barbara offers $ 250 K for 50%. Lori counters at 40%.

Here's a flowing summary of what transpired:

Kwame Kuadey from Gift Card Rescue: Kwame, hailing from Ghana, was recently laid off from his US job due to the recession. He sought $150,000 for a 30% stake in his business. His company focused on buying unused gift cards at a discounted rate and reselling them on their website. With $120,000 worth of gift cards sold in the last year alone, Kwame attracted interest from Amazon. However, Daymond, Barbara, and Kevin H. were not convinced. Kevin O. offered $150,000 for a 50% stake, which Kwame countered with 40%. O'Leary stood firm at 50%, and Herjavec proposed a partnership offering $200,000 for a 50% share alongside O'Leary. Kwame accepted the joint offer.

Gina Cotroneo from Soul's Calling: Gina, from Dallas, Texas, pitched her business seeking $150,000 for a 25% stake. Her company sent accessories with positive messages and energy. Gina's personal story of surviving an attack gained national attention. Despite $29,000 in sales over two years and a $100,000 personal investment, O'Leary deemed the business worthless. Daymond, Barbara, and Kevin H. followed suit in opting out. Herjavec advised Gina to rethink her business.

Dan Claffey from Coffee Brand Gifts: Dan requested $300,000 for a 40% stake in his business. He acquired copyrights for famous coffee brands and planned to merchandise them in various products. However, his lack of sales and the absence of orders led Barbara, Daymond, and Kevin H. to opt out. O'Leary criticized Dan for wasting his time, resulting in Dan walking out.

Paul Watts from Graffiti Removal Services: Paul aimed to franchise his Sacramento-based graffiti removal service in other cities. He sought $350,000 for a 15% stake. While Paul had a biodegradable graffiti remover, he purchased it from a manufacturer. The Sharks had concerns about Paul not having sold any franchises and the potential for easy replication. Barbara opted out due to uncertainty about the franchise deals with the government. Harrington shared a similar sentiment, and Daymond believed the business model would fail once the product became popular and the manufacturer sold retail. Herjavec and O'Leary offered $350,000 for a 75% stake, but Paul rejected the deal. O'Leary expressed frustration, and Paul left the negotiation.

Amy Feldman and Allison Costa from Coverplay: The entrepreneurs sought $350,000 for a 15% stake in their company, which provided slip covers for play-yards to protect children from dirt and grime. Their customers included retail consumers, hotels, playschools, and more. With $200,000 in sales over 12 months and investments totaling $100,000, their business attracted interest. Harrington couldn't sell it on infomercials and dropped out. Barbara offered $350,000 for 40% but solely for product development, excluding salaries and parties. Daymond proposed $350,000 for a 65% stake, offering assistance to other potential owners (POs). Amy countered Barbara's offer, requesting 30% ownership of the patent along with 10% ownership of the business. This revelation surprised all the Sharks, as they were unaware that Allison owned the patent. Consequently, all offers were withdrawn. Allison decided to reintegrate the patent into the company. O'Leary, Daymond, and Herjavec countered with a joint offer of $350,000 for a 51% stake. Barbara remained at 40%, and a deal was struck with her."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1501153/?ref_=ttep_ep5,,An entrepreneur tries to get the sharks to invest in his fitness device.,[],TV-PG,Release date,[],[],[],[],[],"In the Shark Tank episode, several entrepreneurs presented their business ideas to the panel of sharks, including Kevin O'Leary, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin Harrington, Daymond John, and Robert Herjavec. Here's a recap of what happened:

Jack Beringer, also known as Cactus Jack, from Iowa, is a 65-year-old entrepreneur who has never had a job but has a knack for creating products. He pitched his invention, the Body Jac, a fitness product that facilitates push-ups and promotes a healthy lifestyle. The product is manufactured for $20-30 and retails for $89-129. However, when O'Leary questions Jack's ability to sell it, Jack gets offended. He shares his marketing expertise and past success, having sold millions of his previous products and becoming a millionaire by 32, only to go broke by 38. Jack has invested $27K in the Body Jac but O'Leary opts out, believing Jack is trying to shift the risk onto the sharks. Harrington and Barbara offer $180K for 50% of the business, on the condition that Jack loses 30 pounds and becomes the face of the product. Daymond is not interested in just the Body Jac but offers $180K for 50% of the Cactus Jack company and all its patents. In the end, Jack accepts the deal from Barbara and Harrington.

Irina Blok presents Face Blok, a fashionable surgical mask business. She seeks $50K for a 30% stake in her company. However, since the launch, the sales have been minimal. Harrington sees potential in foreign markets like Japan, but Barbara finds the concept freaky and opts out. Harrington and Daymond also decide to pass due to the lack of sales potential. Herjavec and O'Leary agree that the business is not investment-ready, and no deal is made.

Jeff Cohen from Stevenson Ranch, California, introduces Granola Gourmet. As a diabetic for 15 years, he has developed a healthy snack that does not spike blood sugar levels. The granola bars consist of ingredients with a low Glycemic index. With $120K in annual sales, mostly through Whole Foods in 24 stores, Jeff's past bankruptcy prevents him from securing funds from banks. O'Leary believes the entire business is not worth more than $200,000 and opts out. Harrington sees it as a ""me too"" business and decides to pass, while Barbara believes it will require more capital and also opts out. Daymond doesn't view it as a viable business yet and is out as well. O'Leary points out that Jeff's bankruptcy makes him unattractive to banks for future growth. Herjavec believes in Jeff but chooses to opt out.

Rikki Farrar presents Good Grief Celebrations, offering funeral concierge services such as writing eulogies and planning memorial parties. With only $11,000 in sales in the last 12 months, Herjavec expresses concern about the concept of ""celebration of life"" parties with bars and DJs. O'Leary argues that most funeral homes already offer similar services, making it challenging for Rikki to attract direct customers. He suggests that her low sales are a result of families not approaching her directly. Herjavec opts out due to moral issues, and Barbara believes the business is a one-person show that cannot be scaled up, leading her to opt out as well. Daymond perceives it as an ""ambulance chasing"" business and chooses to pass. Harrington thinks Rikki is not making any money and decides to opt out based on that reason alone.

Rodolfo and Alexis Saccoman, from Brazil, present ""My Therapy Journal,"" a website that allows people to maintain an online journal and track their emotional state. They seek $80K for a 20% stake in the business. The platform uses sentiment analysis software to provide insights into emotional states, including trend analysis over time. With a subscription model ranging from $7.95/month to $14.95/month, they have generated $4,000 in sales in the past 12 months. Barbara opts out, but they reveal they are in talks with Aetna, an insurance firm with 37 million customers. O'Leary offers $80K for 50%, but Daymond and Herjavec want to join the deal. They counter with an offer of $80K for 51%. The brothers then propose 49% for $80K. In the end, O'Leary decides to exclude Daymond from the deal. Daymond offers $120K for 50%, but the Saccoman brothers choose to accept the deal with Herjavec and O'Leary, valuing the expertise of the experienced sharks.

That concludes the summary of the entrepreneurs and their interactions with the sharks in the episode."

One of the entrepreneurs, Jonathan Miller, presented his company called ""Element Bars,"" which specializes in manufacturing custom energy bars. Currently, they produce 1,000 bars per week at their facility. Jonathan sought a $150,000 investment for a 15% stake in his business. The company operates through an online platform where customers can choose the ingredients and labeling for their bars, which are then made and delivered to their doorstep. Element Bars had grossed $50,000 year-to-date. While many of the investors liked Jonathan and his business, Kevin O'Leary and Barbara Corcoran decided not to invest.

Daymond John made an offer of $150,000 for a 75% stake in the company, while Kevin Harrington offered the same amount for a 100% stake in the business along with a 4% royalty to Jonathan. In response, Jonathan countered Daymond's offer at 20%. Robert Herjavec and Daymond John decided not to invest, and Jonathan rejected Harrington's initial offer. However, Harrington came back with a revised offer of $150,000 for a 35% stake and a 4% royalty. Eventually, they agreed on a deal of $150,000 for a 30% stake and a 4% royalty.

In another update, Mr. Todd's Pies, a previous entrepreneur on the show, experienced significant success after the sharks helped him secure a deal with QVC. The pies sold out within minutes, leading to a threefold increase in business since the episode aired.

David Chodoz then presented his invention called ""The Fizz,"" which was a reinvention of the root beer float that could be attached to soda bottles. He sought a $150,000 investment for a 25% stake in the business. David, a toy-maker and habitual inventor, showcased the product to the sharks, and they found it fun and enjoyable. The Fizz had generated $84,000 in sales over the past 12 months, primarily from ice cream stores and state fairs. The ice cream for The Fizz could be provided by the customer or pre-filled by an ice cream manufacturer. However, the larger ice cream companies weren't interested due to low sales potential. Kevin Harrington and Daymond John decided not to invest, and Barbara Corcoran also opted out. Robert Herjavec saw potential in licensing the product to ice cream companies but ultimately chose not to invest. Kevin O'Leary, at the end, decided not to invest for the same reasons.

Buck and Arlene Weimer pitched their product, ""Underease Underwear,"" which was designed to protect against flatulence. They requested a $55,000 investment for a 25% stake in the business. The underwear featured odor control and tight elastics to prevent gas leakage. Over the past 12 months, they had generated $37,000 in sales. Having been in business for eight years, their first-year sales reached $83,000. The market for their product was considered small, leading Robert Herjavec and Daymond John to decline the investment opportunity. Kevin Harrington didn't see enough business potential and also opted out, while Barbara Corcoran preferred wearing sexy underwear and decided not to invest. Kevin O'Leary also declined to invest.

Kimberly Cayce presented her business, ""Kalyx,"" which offered a line of sports bras. As a former professional golfer, Kimberly sought a $125,000 investment for a 20% stake in her company. The business had been in development for three years, with Kimberly investing $100,000 of her own money. The existing sports bras were functional but not aesthetically appealing. The competition included major brands like Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. Kimberly wanted the investment to fund manufacturing and a direct-to-consumer approach. Kevin Harrington decided not to invest, and Kimberly informed Barbara Corcoran that the payback period for her investment would be at least five years. Barbara also declined to invest, along with Daymond John and Robert Herjavec, as they believed Kimberly needed millions to compete effectively. Consequently, Kevin O'Leary opted out as well.

The final entrepreneurs, Brett Thompson and Heath Hall, presented their barbecue sauce and spice rub company called ""Pork Barrel BBQ."" They sought a $50,000 investment for a 10% stake in their business. Recently voted the best BBQ sauce in the nation, their estimated revenue for the next 12 months was $4.1 million, with profits exceeding $1 million. Robert Herjavec and Kevin Harrington doubted the accuracy of the estimate, believing that the success of a distribution deal hinged on a pilot program with 10,000 orders. Daymond John opted out, considering the entrepreneurs' political commitments. Barbara Corcoran made an offer of $50,000 for a 50% stake, but Brett countered at 40%, which Barbara accepted, resulting in a deal at 50% ownership."

Leslie, a stay-at-home Southern mom, had previously been scheduled to appear on Shark Tank but had to leave due to the death of her father. She requested $50,000 for a 25% stake in her business. She had sold her product in 103 independent retail stores, generating $60,000 in sales over the last 12 months. A set of 6 charms was priced at $19.95. Harrington offered $50,000 for a 50% stake, and Herjavec joined in on the offer. However, Daymond expressed interest in joining Harrington, as he believed he could bring value on the retail side. Barbara opted out, suggesting that the male Sharks were influenced by Leslie's appearance. Eventually, Harrington asked Herjavec to leave, and Herjavec offered $50,000 for a 25% stake. Leslie attempted to negotiate with Harrington and Daymond, but they refused to go below 50%. O'Leary then offered $50,000 for a 20% stake and an additional 7% royalty. Leslie accepted Herjavec's offer.

The entrepreneurs Todd Robins and David Adomovich pitched ""FunHouse,"" an entertainment venue located in Times Square, New York. They sought a $300,000 investment for a 20% stake. FunHouse occupied a 25,000 square foot area and charged a $15 admission fee. They projected revenues of $9.4 million in the first year, with $1.5 million required for setup and $7.4 million in annual expenses. O'Leary, Herjavec, and Harrington decided to pass on the opportunity due to the risk-reward profile. Barbara believed the entrepreneurs hadn't accounted for marketing costs and also declined. Daymond followed suit.

Dede Barbati-Parra and Kathy Lam pitched ""Boogie Box Fitness,"" offering aerobics fitness programs, classes, and DVDs. They requested $700,000 for a 70% stake to launch their DVD line, which hadn't generated any sales yet. They also operated another business that involved certifying instructors and offering live classes, with year-to-date revenue of $15,000. Kathy projected selling 1 million units of DVDs within three years, but Daymond disagreed, citing that even top record artists struggle to sell that volume of DVDs. Herjavec opted out, considering it a leap of faith, and O'Leary and Harrington followed suit. Barbara felt the requested investment was too high and declined.

Sawyer Sparks presented ""Soy-Yer-Dough,"" a wheat-allergy-friendly modeling dough made from soybeans. Sawyer sought a $125,000 investment for a 25% stake. Online sales had reached 8,000 containers year-to-date, with an order for 11,000 more containers and a potential market of 12.5 million containers. The product was provisionally patented, and Play Dough had expressed interest in acquiring the company for $500,000. Sawyer was interested in a licensing deal with Play Dough to hold them accountable for sales. O'Leary offered $125,000 for a controlling 51% stake, prompting Daymond, Barbara, and Harrington to bow out. Sawyer then countered O'Leary's offer with a proposal of $125,000 for 40%. However, O'Leary insisted on the ability to close the licensing deal. Herjavec also offered $125,000 for 40% but admitted he wasn't as skilled in licensing as O'Leary. Ultimately, O'Leary brought Daymond and Herjavec on board and proposed $300,000 for a 51% stake while agreeing to negotiate the licensing deal."

First up was Dan Mackey with his product ""Chill Soda,"" a healthy soda option. Dan was seeking $50,000 for a 10% stake in his company. He highlighted that Chill Soda only contains 85 calories, compared to regular soda with 140 calories and organic sodas with 160+ calories, making it a healthier alternative. He mentioned that his product is already being distributed in 40 states across the US and has sold 250,000 cans, generating $175,000 in revenue. However, both Harrington and Herjavec bowed out, believing that Dan would require a much larger investment. O'Leary criticized Dan for wasting his time. Barbara expressed interest in making an offer, but O'Leary and Daymond advised her against it. Eventually, Barbara offered $50,000 for a 20% stake.

Next was Dr. Geoffrey Broderick and his daughter Kristina with their product ""Cornucopia,"" a veterinarian-developed pet food that claimed to extend pets' lives. They were seeking $300,000 for a 15% stake. Geoffrey's claims were based on his own observations as a veterinarian but were not backed by any clinical studies. Herjavec was offended by the claims made by Geoffrey, stating that he can prevent cancer in animals and potentially humans, and he decided to opt out. Harrington also passed, as he believed that medical studies were necessary to back up the claims. Barbara, Daymond, and O'Leary all followed suit.

There was an update on Ava the Elephant from a previous episode. Barbara had successfully brought the product into FlavourX and its 40,000 pharmacies. Unfortunately, Tiffany, the owner, had developed cancer since filming.

Ray Latypov and Jim Dimascio presented ""VirtuSphere,"" a large sphere that allows users to walk and experience virtual reality environments. They were seeking $1.5 million for a 10% stake. The cost of the equipment was $55,000, and they had sold 14 units so far, needing to sell 30 to become profitable. Their target market included army recruiting centers with a $7.7 billion budget, as well as consumer virtual arcades, although the latter was a few years away. O'Leary was the first to opt out, citing a high payback period. Harrington followed, concerned about potential liabilities from injuries inside the sphere. Barbara passed due to the high investment amount, and Daymond couldn't see any opportunities for himself. Lastly, Herjavec expressed excitement about the concept but didn't see sufficient business potential to invest.

Lastly, Gayla Bentley presented her fashion line for women over size 12, called ""Gayla Bentley Fashion."" She was seeking $250,000 for a 20% stake. Gayla highlighted that 60% of US women wear size 12 or larger, yet the market was largely overlooked. Her luxury coat retailed for $470 and cost $125 to make. Her sales over the past year amounted to approximately $500,000. She needed the investment to open a flagship store. O'Leary claimed that plus-size women didn't care about fashion as much, but Barbara disagreed, suggesting that the male investors were dropping out due to personal biases. Barbara wanted Daymond or Harrington to partner with her for half of any deal. Daymond offered $250,000 for a 50% stake, and Barbara joined in the investment. Gayla accepted their offer."

Herjavec feels its not very different to wrapping the cord around the phone itself. $3 landed cost, but they are making it themselves. Sandy reckons that it would cost under $1 to manufacture this in a factory, but is not sure. Herjavec feels that the spool should be tacked onto any mobile skin, as skins are important to people.

In the following essay, we delve into the pitches made by four different entrepreneurs on the reality TV show ""Shark Tank."" By examining the viewpoints of renowned investors Kevin O'Leary, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin Harrington, Daymond John, and Robert Herjavec, we gain insights into the evaluation process, the factors that influence investment decisions, and the importance of business acumen.

Nate Berkopec and ""The Factionist"": Nineteen-year-old Nate Berkopec, a business student at NYU, presented ""The Factionist,"" an environmentally friendly T-shirt line targeting the 16-24-year-old demographic. Despite having generated $3,000 in sales over six months, concerns arose during the pitch. O'Leary argued that the business lacked substance as Nate did not manufacture his own T-shirts but rather printed designs on existing ones. Daymond John advised Nate to explore using bamboo for production but questioned his knowledge of bamboo prices and the design quality. With reservations about the absence of a brand name on the T-shirts, Barbara, Herjavec, and Daymond eventually backed out, leaving Nate without an investment.

Anthony and Tine Calvert and ""Podillow"": Anthony and Tine Calvert introduced ""Podillow,"" a tanning and massage pillow offering enhanced comfort. With a successful track record of selling 6,000 units in two years, the Calverts faced valuation issues during their pitch. O'Leary and Herjavec contended that Anthony had overpriced the company based on future potential rather than its current standing. Consequently, O'Leary, Barbara, and Daymond withdrew their interest. Harrington, acknowledging the limited geographic reach of the product, also opted out. Herjavec advised Anthony to seek a loan instead of seeking investment, ultimately resulting in no deal.

Update on: Body Jac: The update on Cactus Jack's Body Jac, a product aimed at aiding weight loss, revealed promising results. Having shed 30 pounds, Cactus Jack secured a deal with Harrington to sell the product through an infomercial, anticipating substantial sales.

Kimberly and Matthew Foley and ""Wee Can Shop"": ""Wee Can Shop"" presented Kimberly and Matthew Foley's vision for a gift shop for children, with multiple storefronts and a wide range of products. Despite generating $13,000 in sales over the last 12 months, concerns arose regarding the potential implications of turning children into consumers at an early age. O'Leary emphasized the need for Kimberly to generate $200,000 in sales just to break even, deeming the opportunity not viable. Barbara considered the venture a hobby, while Daymond suggested starting over. Ultimately, O'Leary and Herjavec agreed that shutting down the business was the most logical decision.

Tim Stansbury and Erin Whalen and ""Grease Monkey Wipes"": Tim Stansbury and Erin Whalen pitched ""Grease Monkey Wipes,"" a line of effective cleaning and grease removing wet wipes. Having chosen not to patent their natural citrus oils, the entrepreneurs focused on marketing instead. Although sales reached $7,400 over six months, O'Leary, Harrington, and Barbara found various drawbacks in the business. Daymond decided against investing, citing a lack of interest. However, Herjavec recognized the potential and offered $40,000 for a 40% stake. Barbara followed suit, sealing the deal.

Conclusion: The pitches presented on ""Shark Tank"" provide valuable insights into the world of entrepreneurship and investment decisions. The evaluations made by Kevin O'Leary, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin Harrington, Daymond John, and Robert Herjavec highlight the importance of various factors such as manufacturing processes, valuation, market reach, and business viability. Entrepreneurs must not only demonstrate their product's uniqueness and market potential but also possess a deep understanding of their industry. Through this analysis, we gain a glimpse into the complexities and challenges faced by entrepreneurs seeking to secure investments and turn their visions into successful businesses."

Michael wants to start a bidding war amongst the 5 big sweetener players even if they just want to win so the other guys cant use the product.

The couple claims that they have received many franchisee requests, and Daymon challenges them to take the money. But Annie and Jeff say that they don't know what to do after they accept the franchisee's money, and Daymon counters that they still wont know after they take his $200K.

He finds one, but it's crooked, and he decides to get revenge, and also save the small mining town from the evil clutches of Phineas King.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Budd Boetticher'],"['', '']",[],"['hotel', 'poker', 'gun in mouth', 'barber shop', 'trial', 'trail', 'threat', 'silver mine', 'newspaper ad', 'miner', 'judge', 'election', 'crooked gambling', 'cheating at cards', 'alcoholic', 'historical event']",[],"A trail-weary Bret rides into Echo Springs and goes to the local hotel. He takes out the $1,000 billed to his inside coat lapel, cuts some papers of the same size, stuff it all in an envelope, and goes to the front desk. The clerk says that they're out of accommodations, but Bret ignores him and asks him to keep the envelope in a safe. Bret writes his name and ""$1,000"" on the front

Once Bret has washed up and put on his better clothes, he goes to the bar and sees a drunk poker player shoved away from a table. Bret confirms the man's name is Joshua Thayer and invites him to drink with him. Joshua thanks him but wonders why he has bothered, Bret says that he's a gambler and asks if there's a big game in town. Joshua says that it's upstairs but advises against playing, saying that mine owner Phineas King runs it and he never loses. Bret buys Joshua another drink and goes upstairs.

Bret joins the poker game and they discuss how John Stoler was in the bank trying to get a loan for her mine. Phineas dismisses her mine as worthless, and Bret introduces himself. Phineas is amused at the idea of a gambler trying to best him, They play and Bret loses to Phineas. Phineas ""accidentally"" reveals the cards that he folded on, and discovers that they're three aces. Bret says that he hates to be second best.

The men continue playing and everyone drops out except Bret. Bret asks for a cut and everyone stares at him, and Bret expertly cuts the cards. Phineas bets $1,000 and Bret tells him that he's out of money but says that he has $4,000 in the hotel safe. Phineas wants to see the money and has Bret write a note to the clerk to confirm the money is there. They wait Phineas' man Big Mike McComb comes back and says the money is there. Bret calls and raises $3,000, and refuses to let Phineas see the money unless he calls. Phineas folds and says that it's been an interesting evening.

Later at the bar, Big Mike joins Bret and says that it's the first time someone has beat Phineas. As a gunman secretly watches, Bret refuses to say whether he had the money. As he leaves, the gunman bumps into Bret and says that he dropped him, and hands him an Ace of Spades with the word ""Get out of town"" written on it. Bret pays two weeks' in advance for his room and tells Big Mike that he's sticking around to see who wants to get rid of him. Big Mike half-jokingly admits that he'd have been disappointed in Bret if he hadn't. As Bret walks down the street, two men hit him over the head and drag him into an alley.

The next morning, Bret wakes up in John Stoler's cabin. His daughter, Edie, introduces herself and says that she and her father found Bret in a ditch. She assures Bret that her father has Bret's money and wonders why the attackers didn't take the money. When John returns, Edie tells Bret not to say anything and goes to greet her father. Over supper, Edie talks about educated women not making good wives and flirts with Bret. She goes to wash the dishes and John offers to drive Bret into town. Bret says that he wants to know who was so anxious to get rid of him.

In town, Bret finds the gunman from the previous night at the barber, and asks at gunpoint who told the man to bushwhack him. The gunman says Big Mike paid him, and Bret goes to the hotel and confronts Big Make in Phineas' office. He punches Big Mike and then draws his gun on him, and asks why Big Mike agrees to tell Bret if he doesn't tell anyone where he got the information from. Once Bret lowers the gun, Big Mike punches him and laughs, saying that he had to return the ""greeting"". Bret takes it in stride and Big Mike says that Phineas wanted Bret out of town. The gambler says that Phineas is a card cheat and demonstrates what he did when Big Mike doesn't believe him, and leaves.

Bret goes to Phineas' office and Phineas feigns ignorance. The gambler figures that Phineas has to win at everything, including poker, and says that he's not leaving town until he gets his damaged coat fixed... and he'll send Phineas the bill.

Later, Phineas tells Big Mike to take care of Bret... permanently. Big Mike isn't interested in murdering a man, and tells Phineas to get someone else to kill Bret. Phineas threatens to take away his business but Big Mike, unimpressed, says that it might not be a bad thing.

Bret finds Joshua in his hotel room and is surprised to see that he's all right. Joshua figured the room was paid for and Bret wouldn't be using it. Bret tells Joshua to take his room and Joshua says that he was a judge once, but didn't say the right thing to the right people. He warns that Phineas is the wrong people, and Bret leaves.

Later, Bret returns to the hotel and finds Big Mike waiting. Big Mike tells Bret that he's leaving town. A passing rider shots at Bret and the two men take cover. Bret punches Big Mike, figuring that he set him up for a target. They go to Bret's room and Big Mike warns that Phineas will have Bret killed. Bret refuses to leave town, saying that he doesn't know how but he's going to stop Phineas.

The next day, Bret takes out an ad in the paper saying that Phineas didn't attempt to kill him The townspeople are amused, but Phineas isn't. He wants Bret taken to court for defamation of character, but his lawyer Bixby points out that Bret told the truth and Phineas had better make sure Bret is alive or townspeople will think Phineas had to do something with Bret's death. Phineas figures that it's his newspaper and he can refuse the ad, but hasn't second thoughts.

At the hotel bar, Bret notices Joshua passed out at a table and suggests to the bartender that with the election coming up, they write in Joshua's name as judge just to make him feel wanted. The bartender agrees, figuring it would be nice for Joshua even thought it was just a joke. Bret swears him to secrecy, and then goes around suggesting the same thing to other townspeople and also saying that it's betw3een the two of them.

On election night, Judge Richard Bixby and Phineas are drinking and waiting for the election results. Joshua wins, much to everyone's surprise, The townspeople lift Joshua onto the bar to congratulate him, and Phineas storms out. Bret joins Joshua on the bar and says that they made a good choice, and praises Joshua. As Bret takes Joshua to his room, Joshua says that he knows Bret set him up and figures there's an angle. He warns Bret that he's never been bought and never will, and Bret assures him that there's no angle. Bret asks about the validity of his books on mining law and Joshua says that the law hasn't changed. he goes into a room, starts to take a drink, and then sets it down.

The next day, Bret goes to the Stoler cabin and meets with the local miners. He points out that they're all adjacent to Phineas' holdings, and says that there's a way to outproduce Phineas. They form a company New Hope, and hire miners at better wages and hours than Phineas is offering. Soon, the company is getting silver from adjacent to Phineas' holdings. Phineas is less than thrilled and tells to take New Hope to court.

Soon, Bixby has an expert testify that New Hope is mining through Phineas' property. Bret doesn't question the witness, and Joshua points out that he hasn't challenged the statement of a single witness. He doesn't call any witnesses because they don't have any. When Bixby says that Phineas owns the land, Bret says that the Federal mining laws state that the first person to find the apex of the vein is guaranteed to mine it no matter where it goes. Bixby objects, saying that the veins are never continuous, but Bret insists that they stand on the law even if it's outdated. Joshua orders a recess until the next day.

That night, Joshua goes through the law books concerning the apex law. Phineas visits him and says that Joshua's decision can cost him a lot of money. Joshua insists that he won't do Bret any favors in the courtroom, and Phineas offers him a flask. The judge refuses but stares at the flask as Phineas takes a drink. Phineas subtly offers him a $100,000 bribe and leaves.

The next day in court, Joshua finally comes in says that he's decided there is no legal cause for an injunction. The miners cheer and congratulate Bret. Big Mikes come in and says that Bixby is heading to the territorial seat to appeal Joshua's decision.

Phineas waits for the appeal to come through, and says that he won't raise his wages or lower his hours. He has an idea and leaves.

Bret tells the miners what their profits are so far. The alarm goes off and they learn that Phineas flooded his own mines to flood theirs until he gets the court decision. The miners at all of the holdings are out of work, and they blame Bret. Big Mike hides around the telegraph office and the operator notes that even though Phineas flooded the mines, Bret set it off. A telegram comes in and the operator tells Big Mike that Bixby wired that the territorial court has found against Bret and the miners. The operator leaves to find his assistant, and Big Mike makes a few modifications to the wire before leaving.

The miners come after Bret at the hotel. Phineas and his men are waiting and Phineas figures Bret will be lucky to get out of town alive. Big Mike goes to Bret's room and says that he fixed up the wire like Bret wanted, but it will only last until Bixby arrives. Bret goes out and shows the miners his $1,000 bill and says that anyone who doesn't like what he says can collect it. He says that he and Phineas were both wrong, and says that Phineas is a fine man who will open the courts. Bret tells the miners that Phineas King and New Hope are about to merge. Phineas is listening and has no idea what Bret is talking about, and Bret says that all of the reforms New Hope has have initiated are being put in the new merger.

Phineas gets the altered telegram and figures that he'll lose. Bret arrives and Phineas says that it's worth the mines shutting down as long as he doesn't lose. The gambler says that the miners just want 5% of the profits and he'll leave town, and asks Phineas if they confirm the merger or Phineas says that he won't oppose it. Bret takes Phineas to the window and says the merger is on, and the miners cheer Bret and Phineas.

Later, Bret prepares to leave Echo Springs. Edie says that she's leaving to find a man in Boston. Phineas asks Bret to stay and run the miners, and Joshua assures Bret that the town is better than the way he found it. After Bret rides off, Bixby arrives and tells Phineas that the ruling was in his favor. Phineas realizes what Bret did but figures that Bret has guts and fires the lawyer.

Big Mike offers to ride with Bret, figuring that something is bound to be happening there and he can't miss it."

One of his opponents, Samantha Crawford, calls him on three queens, and Bret goes all in. Samantha wins with three kings and Bret leaves with the other players. Samantha approaches Bret afterward and figures that he doesn't like losing to a woman. Bret insists that it has nothing to do with her gender and that she's a bad poker player, and Samantha smugly notes that she called his bluff twice. As she leaves, Bret notices Henry Tree watching and then following her out onto the deck.

The next day, the riverboat arrives in New Orleans and Bret goes to a packet company. He notes that their riverboat, the Stonewall Jackson, is scheduled to leave for St. Louis the next day. Bret suggests that they pay him $5,000, and introduces himself. He notes that Samantha is heading back to St. Louis on another riverboat that is almost sold out, while their riverboat is running nearby. Bret suggests that people are curious to see if he can beat Samantha at poker and they'll pay to ride on the Stonewall Jackson if they win. He admits that he needs $5,000 because Samantha cleaned him out, and notes that Samantha is eager to take his money and will book passage on the Stonewall Jackson. Bret doesn't know why she's targeted him but is eager to find out. When the owners refuse, Bret says that he'll book passage on the other riverboat, the Delta Queen. He goes outside and waits, and the desperate owners Bledsoe and Hayes run after him and invite him in.

The next evening, the Stonewall Jackson sails with a full passenger list. Joe Riggs comes over to the poker table and Bret makes it clear they don't want him playing. The gambler tells Riggs that he saw him play at his own saloon in Wagon Wheel, Wyoming, and it was a crooked game. The other players accept Bret's word about Riggs and he says that he'll see Bret again.

Sam comes in and sits down at the table, and Tree is among the spectators that gather. The owners watch and Samantha wins the cut for high card for dealer. Samantha confirms that they're playing according to Hoyle. They play five-card stud and Bret calls Samantha's raise on a pair of nines showing. Bret has a possible straight but Samantha still has the high hand showing, and she raises. Bret calls and raises. She raises him everything that he has and Bret calls, and Bret reveals the card he needs for the straight. However, Samantha produces a copy of Hoyle and notes that straights aren't accepted in stud unless they're agreed to at the beginning of the game. Bret checks the boat's copy and confirms that the rule exists, and leaves the table.

Bret talks to the owners and they say that they checked Bret's reputation and determined that he's honest. Samantha leaves and the owners tell Bret that they drew more fares than the $5,000 they owe him, so he doesn't need to pay them back. Despite that, Bret insists that he'll repay them. He goes after Samantha and he owners figure that they'll get their money back.

On the deck, Bret asks Samantha why she's out to get him. Tree watches from the shadows as Samantha finally explains that he once won $50,000 from George Cross and it was all the money he had. He embezzled the money from his bank to make good, and he was caught and sent to prison. Cross--her father--claimed that Bret cheated. Bret insists that he didn't but apologizes for her loss, but Samantha isn't impressed. He asks what he can do to help her, and Samantha says that she needs $25,000 more to make good for Cross. If she gets it then they'll release it. Bret figures that they both need money and says that the Hoyle trick won't work once the story spreads. He suggests that they set up in Wagon Wheel competing against Riggs and offering honest games, but he needs her to stake him $10,000. Samantha notes that it's a little one-sided, but Bret tells her that it's the only way she'll get her $25,000 and she gets everything he makes past $5,000. Satisfied, Samantha agrees and walks away.

The riverboat arrives in St. Louis and Bret buys gambling equipment. He goes to Samantha's hotel room and tells he that he's sending the equipment to Wagon Wheel and it only costs $9,000. Bret says that he telegraphed a friend to take care of the equipment. He wonders if Cross would approve and suggests that she stay in St. Louis. Samantha says that she wants to keep an eye on her investment. Once Bret leaves to get the tickets, a man knocks at the door claiming he has a telegram for Samantha. It's Tree, who says that Cross sent him and he's a private detective. He tells Samantha that Cross won't understand the deal she made with Bret. Tree admits that he has to tell Cross what's going on, and Samantha offers him $5,000 not to. However, the detective says that he already gave Cross a report.

Cross comes in and gives her $2,500: 10% of her share. Tree says that she gave $9,000 to Bret and Cross tells Samantha to get it back. He explains about Bret buying the gambling equipment, and suggests that Cross can make a better profit by collecting the money Bret makes in Wagon Wheel. Samantha drops her Southern accent and threatens to tell Bret, but Cross points out that she can't without revealing that she set him up. Tree points out that they need each other and come to some sort of agreement, and they haggle until they agree on Samantha getting 25% of the profits... and Tree gets his 25%.

Later, the train heads to Wagon Wheel and Big Mike greets Bret. Once Samantha goes into the hotel, Big Mike tells Bret that Riggs has the town sewn up and nobody will rent Bret the space. Riggs comes out and greets Bret, and says that he didn't think they'd meet so soon. He insists that he runs the table in Wagon Wheel and goes into his saloon, the Golden Bucket. Big Mike tells Bret that there might be one place, owned by Ma Braus outside of town.

Bret and Big Mike go to Ma's place, and she says that she doesn't hold with anyone who drinks or gambles. The gambler insists that he only gambles honestly, and that no one has beaten Briggs because no one will go up against him. Bret has learned that Riggs took the money belonging to Ma's husband and all she has left is the building Bret wants to use. Ma figures that Bret should leave town rather than risk his life, and Bret tells her that people like her and thought she might want to return the favor. The woman gives in and agrees to rent him the building, and makes some coffee.

Later, Bret goes to Samantha's hotel room and says that they have the property and they'll be ready as soon as the equipment is ready. Samantha asks for the bill of sale for the gambling equipment, and Bret hands it over. He asks if she told her father what she's going to do. Big Mike arrives and shows them handbills he made for the new casino, The Square Deck. There's a $5,000 reward for anyone who finds a dishonest game. Bret and Big Mike go out to give away the handbills because no one else will do it.

Riggs and his men hear Bret and Big Mike as the townspeople gather around, and Riggs says that he hates a crooked card sharp and Bret is one. The townspeople consider Riggs' words, and Riffs tells his men to hang back because he can take care of Bret. However, when Bret steps forward to fight him, Riggs has his men draw their guns. The four thugs beat up Bret and Big Mike, and Riggs tells his men to dump them outside of town and kill them if they try to come back into Wagon Wheel.

Sam watches the whole thing from her hotel room window. As she packs to leave, Tree comes in and figures that she's going to leave since she saw Bret get beaten and offer Riggs a deal. The detective points out that she has a deal with him and Cross, and Samantha notes that she has the bill of sales and Cross doesn't need to know. Tree says that they'll wait for Cross and then they'll all talk to Riggs.

Ma takes Bret and Big Mike in, and Bret says that they're going back into town. She figures that if Riggs hurt her, every citizen would know. Bret asks her to take them into town without Riggs seeing them, and she agrees to do it after dark.

Sam, Tree, and Cross go to see Riggs and say that they're Bret's partners. Cross warns that Bret won't quit, and they have the money to buy all the help Bret needs if it comes to a fight. He offers to sell the equipment to Riggs for a small profit. Riggs checks the bills of sale and Cross agrees to sell it for $20,000. Samantha warns that Bret won't quit as long as he has the equipment, and Riggs figures he can go big with the equipment. He'll give them 10% of his saloon's profits for the next three years, and Cross agrees once Riggs puts it in writing.

The trio return to Samantha's hotel room and find Bret waiting for them with a gun. He admits that he knew the story was fake all along and he's happy being a partner. Cross tells him that he isn't and Samantha agrees, and Bret figures that they made a deal with Riggs. Samantha says that there's nothing Bret can do, and Bret seemingly accepts the situation, gives his gun to Samantha, and leaves. Samantha wonders what Bret will do next, and Cross suggests that she has a soft spot for Bret.

Bret tells Big Mike and Ma what happened, and asks Ma to walk into Riggs' place as long as he and Big Mike go with her. They go into the Bucket and Bret says that they came in for some blackjack. Riggs objects, but Ma says that Bret is a friend of hers and the townspeople side with her. The owner gives in rather than anger his customers, and Bret insists on using the same deck that was already being used. Bret reveals that the cards are marked and the other games are rigged. A fight breaks out and Bret and Riggs exchange punches. Bret and Big Mike draw their guns and Bret loudly says that the customers smashed up a crooked casino in New Orleans. The townspeople take the hint and smash up the place, and Ma laughs as her husband is avenged.

When the townspeople grab Riggs, Bret stops them and says that they should go home. Once they leave, Bret tells Riggs that he knows the owner has the bills of sale but he won't be able to do anything with them. Ma offers to buy the bills from Riggs for $2,000 and notes they're worth nothing to him otherwise. Riggs agrees and leaves, and Ma tells Bret that she's going to start an honest place and wants Bret to work for her. Bret offers the job to Big Mike and he agrees. Samantha, Cross, and Tree come in, and Bret tells them that whatever Riggs offered them, they're getting nothing.

The next day, Bret is heading out on the stagecoach. Ma says that she'll send Bret the $5,000 as soon as she has it, and Bret tells her to send it to Bledsoe and Hayes. When Samantha comes out, Bret helps her onto the stagecoach and gets in with her and her ""partners"". As they leave Wagon Wheel, Bret suggests that they play cards to pass the time. Samantha wins the cut for high card."

Martinson'],[''],[],"['undertaker', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'tombstone', 'robbery', 'escape from jail', 'fake ghost', 'buried loot', '1870s']",[],"Bret is playing poker at the saloon. He wins and collects his winnings, unaware that The Kid is watching him. The Kid goes outside and when Bret walks by, trains his gun on him and demands his $3,000 in winnings. He says that he doesn't want to have to pull the trigger but will if he has to. Bret tries to fight but The Kid knocks him out and leaves.

Once Bret recovers, he tracks down The Kid to the town of White Rock. He asks a man about The Kid, and the man says that there's a boy matching The Kid's description who has been at the Paradise Saloon taking on all comers at poker. Bret goes there and sees The Kid at the poker table. The gambler checks into the nearby saloon rather than confront The Kid.

After sunset, Bret cleans up and heads for the saloon. He hears gunshots and runs in, and finds the players putting The Kid's corpse up on the table. One man says that The Kid lost and accused the other players of losing. The Sheriff says that The Kid lost almost $3,000 to everyone in town. As Bret leaves, he sees a woman--Mary Shane--sitting and crying. He offers her his coat against the chill and asks what the matter is, and Mary finally explains that she had a fight with a man she was engaged to, and he walked off and left her there. Bret offers to drive her home in a buggy, and they go eight miles out of town where Mary lives. She apologizes for going to pieces, and Bret says that her man is a gambler... leaving Mary alone. Mary insists that her fiancé is no gambler.

They come to a bridge and Mary warns that it can be dangerous in the dark. She walks on ahead to check out if it's safe. Mary disappears into the dark and Bret goes to check on her. Back in town, he talks to the stableman who confirms that there's no bridge and no one named Shane lives in town. There's a woman living at Mrs. Clemmer's boarding house that matches Mary's description. The stableman advises Bret to let it go, but Bret points out that Mary still has his coat with $1,000 pinned inside.

Bret goes to the boarding house and knocks at the door. Mrs. Clemmer tells him that Mary did live there but she died a week ago. Bret goes to the Sheriff and tells him what happened, and the Sheriff figures that Bret is either drunk or delusional. He knows Mary before she died, and says that she was a well-respected woman. She was engaged to Bert Nicholson, who runs the hardware store. The Sheriff warns that it's not a good idea to interrupt Bert when he's mourning.

The next day, Bret rides out to where Mary vanished. He sees his court on a gravestone in the nearby cemetery, with the $1,000 pinned inside. Mary's gravestone is nearby. Bret rides back into town and someone takes a shot at him with a rifle. They miss and Bret runs after them as they flee. The Sheriff and the locals arrive and Bret tells the Sheriff that someone shot at him. The lawman says that he doesn't' believe in ghosts, and Bret points out that the man was wearing a black suit. The Sheriff says that Bert wears a suit, and he's also the town undertaker.

Bret goes to the undertaker office and Bert says that she died of a bronchial condition. He refuses to discuss it further because he finds it painful, and Bret asks where he was 45 minutes ago. Bert says that he was there preparing for The Kid's funeral, and that he doesn't own a rifle. The Sheriff and a townsman watch him and hope that Bret isn't moving into White Rock permanently.

Bert rides off on his horse at a gallop, and Bret follows him from a distance. The undertaker rides out of White Rock and comes to a rock slide.

In town, Hank Foster arrives in town.

Bert digs through the rocks, and Bret watches from a distance. When someone walks up, Bert hides and Bret rides back into White Rock. Mary watches him from a house and quickly closes the shade.

That night, Bret is drinking in the saloon. The barflies joke about Bret saying he saw a ghost. He says that the liveliest thing in town seems to be the undertaker. Hank comes over and asks what Bret's story is. The stranger has heard that someone took a shot at Bret and says that he doesn't look like a local boy. Bret says that he's just passing through and Hank wishes him well and goes to the hotel. He asks the clerk for a room on the street side, and notes that Bert has a grudge against the undertaker. The hotel clerk explains that Bert and Mary were going to get married.

Bert rides out to the rock slide and starts searching, not sure what he's looking for.

Bert is having dinner with Mary when there's a knock at the door. Mary worries that it's ""him"", and Bert says that there's nothing to worry about. He opens the door and Hank barges in. Hank asks where the $60,000 of Wells Fargo money is. Bert claims that he has no idea what he's talking about, and Hank figures that Bert shot at Bret because they look similar. Hank figures that Mary died nice and convenient, and she gave Bert part of the $60,000 to help fake her death. Bert says Hank's real name, Felton, and says that he hid the money in a box at the rock slide. He jumps Hank and they struggle, and Bert is shot and killed. Once Hank leaves, Mary comes in and confirms that Bert is dead.

Twenty minutes later, the Sheriff and his men confront Bert at the hotel. They put him under arrest for Bert's murder and take him to jail. The Sheriff says that the circuit judge will be in town in a week, and tells the deputy George to watch Bret carefully.

At the saloon, the locals discuss Bret. Hank listens as they say that Bret came in looking for The Kid and then gunned down Bert. The Sheriff comes in while the townspeople talk themselves into lynching Bret. The lawman smiles and says that they've got lawmen as well as cottonwood trees. He goes back to the jail and tells George to keep a shotgun nearby and make sure the place is locked up. The Sheriff walks down the street, and Hank goes to the jail and knocks at the door. George answers it and Hank claims that he's Bret's lawyer. He agrees to let George lock him in the cell so that they can talk privately once George goes outside.

Hank tells Bret that he thought he could use a friend, and warns that the townspeople are organizing a lynching party. The stranger figures that Mary is tied up with the whole thing and asks Bret to tell him the whole story. Bret figures that he's more interested in Mary than him, and Hank says that he's a special investigator for the railroad. If Bret tells him everything he knows about Mary, Hank will get him out of jail. Bret agrees and Hank says that they'll disarm George and ride out of town. He assures Bret that he won't hurt anyone, and Bret agrees.

Hank says to meet him at a grove outside of town and calls George in to let him out. The deputy does so and makes himself comfortable, and Hank busts in the window and trains a gun on George. Hank has George take Bret's place and sends Bret on ahead. As he goes, Bret hears two gunshots and sees Hank run out of the jail.

Later, Hank arrives at the grove and meets with Bret. Bret draws a gun on him and asks about the shots, and Hank claims that it was someone in the saloon. The gambler points out that the saloon was closed and confirms that Hank fired his gun twice. Bret isn't happy that Hank framed him for a second murder, and Hank attacks him. The two men fight and Bret finally knocks his rescuer out.

Once Bret ties Hank up, he goes to the rock slide and finds Mary digging through the rocks. She finally locates a box, and Bret tosses a rock to get her looking the other way. Mary aims a rifle in the direction of the noise, and Bret ropes her and then comes over. She figures that Bret is Hank and tells him that it wasn't her husband's idea to break out of prison, and he wrote saying that Bret planned the break and killed the guard. Once Bret found out about the holdup money, he killed her husband and then came to White Rock and killed Bert. Bret plays along and Mary says that all of the money is there except $600 that she used to live on.

Bret turns his back on Mary, who grabs her rifle and tells him to drop his guns and then dig up the money. Mary says that she's going to turn the money into the company, and she didn't originally because she promised her husband that she'd wait until he got back. As Bret digs, Hank says that she fell in love with Bert but didn't tell him about the money until she read about the jail break. They came to get the money but the rock slide had buried it. Bret figures that Mary played dead so her husband would ride on when he got there, and Mary and Bert could get married.

Once Bret digs up the box, he tells Mary that he took the precaution of unloading the rifle figuring that she would talk. He explains that he's not Hank and they'll head back in to town. As they go, Mary says that Bert saw Bert at the saloon and had Mary lure him out in the buggy. Bert was going to kill Bret, but The Kid was killed and they came to get Bert, and he couldn't get out of it.

Bret and Mary ride to the grove and Hank tells Bret that he wants to talk in private. Mary asks Hank if her husband is dead, and Hank all but admits that he killed him.

The next morning, the trio ride into town. The Sheriff comes out as the townspeople gather. Later at the saloon, Bret tells everyone what happened. The Sheriff says that they got a telegram about the two convicts, and the townspeople are glad to have Bret say until the $3,000 reward come in. The men offer to let Bret play poker, and Bret feigns being a newbie as he starts dealing."

When one of them hits his horse, Bret takes cover nearby. A man in the rocks above fires at them and they quickly take cover. They finally retreat and the man, Lefty Dolan , comes down and explains that he was waiting for the stage. He offers Bret his canteen and Lefty admits that he was going to hold up the stage and could use the help. Bret tells him that he's just a law-abiding citizen and the men after him were disappointed poker players. Lefty is disappointed that Bret is only a gambler, and Bret offers him half of the money he won. The robber declines, asking for just $30 and a stake for a new horse. In return he'll ride the stagecoach like a good citizen. Bret agrees and Lefty admits that he doesn't bring most people luck.

The stagecoach eventually comes along, and Bret and Lefty wave it down. The driver admits that he's driving empty because of all the times that he's been robbed. He's surprised to learn that they're paying customers and invites them to get in so he has company. Once they get in, the stagecoach continues. The driver spots two armed men up ahead, and the driver insists on stopping rather than risk getting killed. Lefty draws his gun and tells Bret to get out, and the robbers come over. Bret says that he's alone, and the holdup man tells him that his luck has run out. The other robber checks the coach and Lefty shoots him. The man shoots back, hitting Lefty, and Bret punches the first robber.

Bret checks the coach and finds Lefty dying. Lefty reminds Bret that he saved his life and tells him that five years ago in Arizona, him and three men robbed a bank and the teller was killed. An innocent man mistaken for him was arrested for the crime and convicted. Lefty says that the man was Jeff Ferris and makes Bret promise to get Jedd out, and then dies before the driver can get there to hear his confession.

Guilty because he doesn't know what he can do, Bret ends up playing poker but folds rather than win. He tells the other players that there's something he has to do and goes to the prison in Arizona. Bret meets with Jedd and introduces himself, and then explains why he's there. His testimony isn't enough to clear Jedd, and Jedd says that he was a newcomer in town. They were going to hang him but the territorial governor commuted his sentence to life. Bret figures that he just made things worse, but Jedd says that he's glad somebody knows he's innocent. He wonders if his wife Martha is even convinced of his innocence. Jedd asks Bret to do one thing more: call on Martha and tells her that Jedd hasn't changed his mind and wants her to do what he told her to do. He makes Bret promise that he won't tell Martha that he's innocent.

Bret rides to the Ferris ranch and finds a man working on the fence. The men, Ben Maxwell, says that he owns a nearby spread and is helping Martha because her father is sick. Martha returns from a walk and invites Bret into the house for coffee. He passes on Jedd's message and she wonders how Bret knows her husband. Martha figures that Bret knows something about the case and asks if there's any hope, insisting that Jed is innocent. She realizes that Bret knows of Jedd's innocence, and Martha explains that Jedd wants her to get a divorce and remarry. Martha refuses, insisting that one day they'll find out that Jedd is innocent.

As Brett leaves, Ben asks if Bret knows anything about Bret. He figures he'd have a better chance of Martha accepting him if Jedd was out of prison where he can confront him. Bret tells him that Jedd is innocence and the witnesses against him were wrong. Ben asks Bret to call on him if there's anything he can do, and asks Bret to help him place a timber. Bret obliges and slips, and the timber falls on him, breaking his arm.

Bret leaves, wondering if the board was a sign from Lefty that he hadn't done everything possible. Two months later, Bret is playing poker and a man sits down to play. The man deals left-handed and two of the other players, Rex Clark and Whitey Blandon, mention that Lefty dealt the same way. Since they're staying together at the hotel, Bret sets out to talk to one of them alone. Four hours later on a big hand, only the three of them were in. They each have a pair showing but Bret figures that they have three of a kind. Bret has three queens with one in the hole, but figures that if both men lose then they'll leave. But if Rex wins then he'll be back in the game. Whitey has the weakest hand with three 8s, and Bret tries to throw the hand to him. Bret calls Rex and Rex raises, and Bret prods Whitey into staying in. The gambler raises again and advises Rex to drop out. Rex does so and Bret suggests that he and Whitey split the pot. Whitey figures Bret wouldn't offer to split it if he had the third queen, raises, and reveals his third card. Bret drops out without revealing his card, saying he didn't have the third card, and Rex gripes that Whitey shouldn't have won the pot.

Rex goes to his room to drink, and Bret pays him a visit. He explains that he met Lefty and claims that he's been looking for him after they robbed a stagecoach to give him his half of the take. Rex says that Lefty died in his arms owing him money, but Bret knows better and Rex admits that he was lying. He offers Bret a drink, and Bret secretly pours it in a spittoon and pretends to get drunk. As they talk, Whitey arrives in the hallway and hears them talking. Bret mentions the bank robbery and that Whitey was involved, and Rex suddenly sobers up. The gambler tells Rex that he's going to get Jedd out of jail, and draws his gun when rex goes for his. Whitey comes in shooting and Bret takes cover, and Whitey and Rex shoot at him... and Whitey hits and kills Rex. After Whitey runs off, the locals arrive and take Bret to the sheriff, figuring that he's the killer.

Later, Bret talks to the sheriff and explains why he was in Rex's room. The sheriff points out that Rex was killed with a .45 and Bret's gun is a .45, and claims that Whitey's was a .38. Bret admits that he might have shot Rex in the dark, and the sheriff reveals that Whitey's was actually a .45. He figures the jury would acquit Bret and Whitey, and he's not going to hold Bret. The sheriff tells Bret to get out of town because it's embarrassing to have him around.

Bret rides after Whitey, figuring that he's heading to the nearby Mexican border. Plenty of farmers have seen Whitey because of his distinctive hair, and Bret rides near ben's ranch. He stops there and tells Ben that he's following Whitey, and Ben agrees to have his men bring Whitey back. The rancher invites Bret to stay there for the night, and tells him that Martha's father died a few days ago and she needs to hear something good. Bret goes to ride to Martha's ranch, and Ben suggests that he stay there to keep an eye on her in case Whitey goes there. Once Bret leaves, Ben takes out a revolver and checks on Whitey in the next room. He tells Whitey that he didn't need his warning and knew about Bret, and now Bret is at his door. Ben says that Whitey should ride north while he and his men go south, and tells Whitey to wait until midnight to leave.

Bret goes to the Ferris ranch and tells Martha that there's a chance he might be able to get Jedd out of prison if things turn out right and they capture Whitey. Martha thanks Bret for the news, and Bret mentions that Ben is in love with her. She says that she told Ben that she would never marry him, and has known him since he came to town during Jedd's trial. Bret figures that Ben wanted him to come there, and Martha confirms that Ben was at Jedd's trial every day. She's sure that Ben's love is real and Bret agrees, and asks how much Ben paid for his ranch. It was $10,000: one share of the bank robbery. Martha says that the robbers were wearing bandannas and one man's bandanna fell off. Bret figures that he's found three robbers--Lefty, Rex, and Whitey--and the fourth one came back figuring it was safe because no one saw his face. Martha insists that it can't be true, but Bret figures that Whitey was heading to the fourth robber: Ben.

Once Ben is sure the coast is clear, he tells Whitey to leave. As Whitey goes to the barn to get his horse, Bret gets the drop on him and orders him to sign a confession to clear Jedd. Once Whitey does, Bret will let Whitey head for the border. Whitey refuses, and Bret says that Whitey killed Rex claiming that he fired a .38 and Whitey used the .45 that Rex was shot with. The gambler says that Martha is bringing the sheriff and Whitey's time is running out, and Whitey signs the confession. Whitey lights a match to see the paper and sets the hay on fire, but Bret kicks it out and knocks down Whitey when he goes for his gun. Bret tells him what the confession says and orders Whitey to sign, but Ben comes in and gets the drop on Whitey.

Ben shoots Whitey dead and then pistol-whips Bret unconscious. Martha arrives with the sheriff and the sheriff shoots Ben. As Ben lies dying, he agrees to sign the confession to clear Jedd so that he can get back to Martha. Martha thanks him and he dies.

Two months later, Jedd is released from prison and comes home. Bret watches as Jedd and Martha are reunited, and then rides off satisfied that Lefty is done with him."

Sam Harris and his partner Matson make camp, and Mart and his two brothers Wes and Rip sneak up on them. Sam hears them and invites them to come down, and they draw guns on each other. Mart says that Sam knows what he wants, and Sam tells him that he's been leading him away from the claim. The Fallons tell Sam to take them to the claim, and Sam points out that he has a double-barreled shotgun and can hit all three of them. He orders them to ride off, and Mart says that they don't want to kill him and they just want a share of the claim. Sam insists that he found it and is going to keep it. Wes counts to three and shoots Sam when he tries to aim.

The Fallons prepare to kill Matson when he says that Sam was taking him to the mine and he doesn't know where it is. He says that there's someone coming in on the stage that knows everything Sam did, and Mart tells him that they'll let him live if he can get them to the mine. As they leave for the stage depot, Sam stirs.

Four days later, the Fallons arrive at the Packsaddle Stage Depot, and Mart talks to Rip outside. He tells Rip to come inside in a minute and claim that the stage is coming. Inside, the passenger agent Simmons is tending to the bar. Mart sits down with Wes and Matson, and a minute later Rip comes in and claims the stage is coming. Simmons notes that they're early today and goes to get the horses ready. Mart orders Matson to tell them which passenger they're looking for, and Matson wonders why they should keep him alive. Wes draws a knife on Matson, and Mart says that they wouldn't take a chance on killing Matson when the stage is coming. Matson tells the Fallons that Sam sent a map of the claim to his wife Linda, and Mart orders him to go before the stage gets there. As Matson goes to the door, Wes throws a knife in his back. Rip is angry that Wes killed another man, and Mart says that Matson could have warned the authorities.

As Mart and Wes prepare to toss the body in a nearby canyon, they hear Bret rides up. Bret saddles his horse and comes inside, unaware that the Fallons have propped Matson's body up in a chair. Mart comes over and asks Bret if they can help him. Bret isn't interested in chatting, and Simmons comes in and figures that Bret and the others are waiting for the stage.

The stagecoach arrives and the passengers go in to eat. The driver tells Simmons that he drove the horse because they're in Indian territory, but Simmons insists that there aren't any Indians in the area. The passengers eat and Mart comes over, posing as Matson and identifying Linda because she's the only young woman there. He claims that Sam is at the mine protecting it from the local Indians, and Bret overhears him talking. Linda says that Sam wrote that he's the only one who knows where the mine is, and Mart claims that Sam wants her to take him to the mine using the map Sam sent her. Linda says that she'll wait for a while in case Sam changes her mind.

The other three passengers eat Simmons' food, and the older woman Ella Taylor faints when Simmons tells her that she's eating rattlesnake meat. As Ella's husband Dare tends to her, the third passenger McLean comes over and asks about Matson. Mart claims that he's asleep and sends McLean away when he tries to wake Matson up.

The stage leaves with McLean and the Taylors, and the Indians watch.

Bret introduces himself to Linda. When Mart comes over and says that Linda is with him, Bret says that he found Sam two days ago, dying. He couldn't save Sam's life and buried him, and he kept silent to let the Fallons play out their hand. Mart asks if Linda is going to trust Bret's word over Sam's ""partner"", and Bret tells Linda to see if Matson is alive. Linda goes over and confirms that the real Matson is dead, and Bret drives on Mart. Wes says that he and Rip have Bret covered, and Bret reluctantly sets his gun on the counter.

Simmons comes in and Rip holds him at gunpoint, taking his gun. Mart has Bret hide Matson's body behind the bar, and tells Linda that Sam forced them to shoot him. He says that the mine is on Indian land and they want it, and orders Linda to give them the map. Linda says that she left her luggage on the stage, and Mart sends Rip to get the luggage. Mart figures that Sam told Bret where the map is, and orders Bret to strip so they can search him. Simmons explains that everyone heard about the mine when Sam brought a sample in. As he removes his clothing, Bret says that the Fallons won't need any of them if they get the map.

The Indians attack the stage. The driver tries to outrun them and the stage overturns.

Rip rides back to the depot and tells his father that when he found the stage, the Indians had burned it. Simmons suggests that the Indians are heading for the Fallons' ranch with a thousand heads, and Bret wonders why they need a mine when they have a big spread. Rip angrily says that everyone thinks that the Fallons are dirt, and Bret points out that Indians might go after the herd while the Fallons are gone. Rip and Wes argue, and Mart tells them not to fight. Wes wants to kill Bret, but Bret points out that he's the only one who knows where the mine is. He refuses to cooperate if they hurt Linda or Simmons. Bret refuses to take them to the mine unless they let Linda and Simmons go first. Mart tells Wes to shoot Bret in the arm to convince him.

Before Wes can shoot, the Indians attack the depot. Everyone takes cover, and Rip and Wes open fire. The Indians shoot back and Bret suggests that they give him a gun to help. Mart refuses and opens fire with his sons, and Wes figures that the Indians are after something specific. Meanwhile, Linda thanks Bret for his help. He points out that she isn't grief-stricken, and Linda says that she lost Sam to gold fever four years ago. They have a son Timmy who is in Boston with her mother-in-law.

The Indians stop shooting and wave a white flag. Their leader tells the Fallons to send out Bret. Bret tells Mart that they think he found gold and he dropped nuggets to slow them down. He says that he had to kill two Indians to get out, and Mart figures that they were looking for Bret and he knew it. Bret figures that Mart won't send him out because he's the only who knows where the mine is.

Mart yells to the Indians that they can't have Bret, and the leader promises that they'll kill all of them. Wes warns that the next sage just might turn around, and the Indians open fire. Simmons motions to a stuffed owl on the mantle, and Bret spots a gun hidden there. Mart finally orders Bret at gunpoint to go out, and then they dump a corpse in Bret's coat out in front of the depot. The Indians ride over, tie a rope to the corpse's legs, and ride off dragging the body

Inside the depot, Bret puts on his clothes and grabs the hidden gun. He aims it at the Fallons and when Wes goes for his gun, Bret shoots him in the arm. Simmons collects the Fallons' gun and Bret tells Linda and Simmons to sit down. Once they do, Bret has Rip get the map that he hid behind the bar. He offers to sell it to the Fallons for $15,000 cash. Mart wonders why so little, and Bret tells him that he doesn't want to go back to Indian country. Bret figures that Mart has $15,000 at his ranch and he can send one of his brothers to get it. Mart writes down the combination for the safe, and secretly says to bring back plenty of help. He gives it to Wes, but Bret checks the paper and has Mart write the combination and have Wes forget the first note. Mart tells Wes to just bring back the money and Wes leaves.

Bret takes the map from Rip and Simmons confirms that the next stage will be along in two hours. Linda isn't thrilled with Bret, saying that Sam died for his son. Bret figures that Sam wanted the mine to go to his son because he was dying. Mart points out that it's a two-hour ride to the ranch, and Bret figures that the stage will head back to the previous town once they spot the burned coach. Mart is impressed with his thinking and suggests that he partner with the Fallons. Bret figures that he'd get a bullet in the back, and says that Rip might have turned out all right without his father and brother. Mart tells Bret that he can't split them up.

Wes finally returns late, and Bret takes the gun he has hidden on him, and has him sit down. He has Linda count the money and she makes sure that it's all there, and Bret gives the map to Mart. Bret then has Simmons release the horses five miles out to buy him time to escape. Wes secretly nods to Mart and reveals that he has two guns hidden in his boot. Wes and Mart grabs the guns, and Rip yells a warning to Bret and grabs Wes' arm, giving Bret time to shoot Mart in the shoulder and kill Wes. Mart and Rip stare at Wes' corpse, and Mart blames Rip for Wes' death. Rip insists that he's never killed anyone, and Mart angrily tells him to stay away from him. He asks what happened to Rip when it was the three of them against everyone else, and Rip says that it was always Mart and Wes against everyone else. Bret lets Wes keep the map, figuring that it cost him more than he thought.

The stage arrives with Sheriff Tibbs and his posse. Tibbs arrests the remaining Fallons, and after Bret tells him what Rip did, the sheriff says that he'll show him every consideration. Simmons tells the sheriff that Bret sold the map to Wes, and Tibbs asks if Linda wants to back it up. Linda says that Bret had a right to do whatever he wants, and Bret tells Tibbs that he sold him a map, not a mine. Simmons angrily says that Bret was going to give the Fallons their horses, and Bret points out that the horses belonged to them and he figured Tibbs would send a posse so they wouldn't have gotten far. Tibbs points out that he can't arrest Bret for something he didn't do, and a disgusted Simmons figures the sheriff will give Bret a medal next.

Once Tibbs and his men leave with the prisoners, Bret tells Linda that the money is hers and gives it to her. He explains that Fallon wouldn't have gone through with the deal if he had told her earlier. Bret says that Sam struck a pocket of free gold and he realized it before he died, and figures that Fallon should have the claim since he was willing to kill for it. Linda tells Bret that she's almost sorry that she's going back, and they kiss as Simmons looks on, astonished. The woman gets into the stage and it leaves, and Bret gives Simmons a nugget as a souvenir before riding off."

Martinson'],"['', '']",[],"['old flame', 'crooked gambling', 'camel', 'false accusation', 'escape from jail', 'desert', 'derringer', 'bluff']",[],"In Clayville, Bret is playing poker and raises against Brimmer. Brimmer offers Bret the chance to buy an imported full-blooded Arabian mount for $200, Fatima. Bret agrees and Brimmer raises. The gambler stands pat on his hand and Brimmer folds. Bret takes the pot and Brimmer insists on seeing his hand and Bret finally reveals that he was bluffing. He asks to see Fatima, and Brimmer takes Bret outside to the mount: a camel. Brimmer admits that it's one of the last camels that the Army brought over. Bret is angry that Brimmer conned him by making him think that he was buying a horse. The gambler doesn't want the camel, but neither does Brimmer and he leaves.

Bret takes Fatima to the nearby livery stable, and the livery man doesn't want it stabled there. Despite that, Bret pays him to give him a bath and a stable, and the livery man agrees.

Later, Bret collects Fatima and discovers that no one wants to buy a camel. He heads to Silver Springs with Fatima, and discovers that Fatima has fallen in love with him. Bret finally pays a farmer, Johnson, $100 to take Fatima. He rides on to Silver Springs and sees a woman, Donna Seely, walking down the street. Bret joins her and Donna recognizes Bret. They talk about old times and Donna says that she's getting married, and her fiancé is Carl Jimson and he runs the saloon, the Square Deal. Donna tells Bret that everyone loves Carl and elected him mayor, and Bret asks for a recommendation for the room before going on her way.

That night at the saloon, Bret watches the customers play. Donna joins him, and they hear Tommy Norton telling Carl that one of the players, Scott, won't take his credit. Carl advises him to pack it in for the night, and Tommy wonders how he'll tell his wife he lost $200. The owner gives him $50 to get him off the hook. Once Tommy goes home, Donna introduces Bret to Carl. A player calls Carl away, and Bret confirms with Donna that Carl plays. He tells Donna he can pick out the regular players who win, and notes that they do a lot of signaling between them. Donna insists that Carl wouldn't stand for cheating, and Bret sits down to play with them, saying it's the only game in town. He advises Donna not to say that they're cheating.

Bret plays against the two regulars. One of them, Connors, tells another-Ferguson--to speed it up. Bret tells Ferguson to take his time making the call, and Ferguson folds. Connors raises Bret's bet and Bret calls. The other gambler says that he has three queens, but Bret spreads the cards and points out that there are only two queens there. Connors says that his eyes must have been getting blurry, and Bret agrees but notes that his three 10s wins the pot. After leaving the table, Connors meets with Carl privately and tells him that Bret stopped Ferguson from giving him the third queen. He figures that Bret is a pro, and reports that Bret is in for $1,000. Carl tells him to get into the game and keep working with Bret.

Connors reenters the game and after a few more hands, he and Ferguson report to Carl that Bret is a pro. They warn Carl that Bret knows the game is crooked, and Connors suggests that they play it straight and let him move on with $5,000. Carl refuses to let Bret go with ""his"" money, and tells his men that he'll handle it himself. Once they leave, Carl puts a derringer into a sleeve holder. He then enters the game and Bret figures that he's a real expert. Carl wins a few but Bret figures that he's on to him and matches Carl's bet on the next hand. He asks for a cut, citing Hoyle. The owner refuses and Bret figures that Carl knows something about the deck he doesn't. Carl takes offense, draws his derringer, and shoots Bret. Connors and Ferguson support Carl's claim that Bret was going for the gun, and the customers take Bret to the doctor.

When Dr. Nelson arrives, they take Bret to his hotel room. The next day, Donna comes to Bret's room with coffee. He asks if Carl knows that she's there, and Donna admits that he doesn't. She says that everyone in town figures that Bret is going after Carl, and tells him not to. Bret refuses to back down, and says that he heard about Carl from a friend and came to Silver Springs to trip Carl up. He figures that Carl will worry that he's coming after him for a gunfight, and Donna asks him to leave town for her sake. Bret refuses and Donna leaves.

Later, Carl comes to see Donna and asks why she went to see Bret. She explains that she tried to talk Bret out of a gunfight, but Carl demands to know what Bret is to her. Donna says that she thought she was in love with Bret once but it's over, and Carl says that it doesn't make any difference now that she's his girl. He kisses her and then slaps her, saying that he was overcome with jealousy and didn't know what he was doing. Donna tells him to leave and he reluctantly goes.

The hotel clerk, Howard Harris, checks on Bret to ask how long he's going to stay. Bret admits that he's going to confront Chet and has let word spread around, and says that Carl will worry about it. He figures that Carl wont' risk his reputation by shooting him in the back, and Howard asks for an advance on Bret's room. As Howard goes, he points to the window where Fatima is looking in. Howard insists that Fatima can't stay there, and warns that no one will want to buy the camel. Bret pays Howard to try and sell Fatima and the clerk reluctantly agrees.

At Carl's saloon, Drake arrives to meet with Carl. Carl pays Drake--a hired gun--to kill Bret once he's back on his feet. He insists that nobody know Drake is working for him, and pays him half in advance and half upon completion.

Once Bret's wound has healed in a few days, he goes out to see Carl. Howard asks him to pay up but Bret refuses and leaves. Out on the street, the townspeople follow Bret to the Square Deal. Drake is waiting outside and picks a fight, insisting that they've met before and they've got a score to settle. Bret insists that he doesn't know him, but Drake persists. Carl and Donna watch from the saloon window, and Bret figures that Drake is working for Carl. Bret admits that he's not the fastest gun in the world and that's why Carl hired Drake. He removes his hat and says that he has a derringer in his hat and is aiming it at Drake's heart. Drake demands to see the derringer, but Bret refuses and tells him to drop the gun. The hired gun reluctantly removes his gun belt and tosses it on the ground, and Bret reveals that he wasn't holding a derringer and punches Drake unconscious.

Bret goes up to Carl's office and calls to him from the hallway. Carl draws his gun and Donna moves outside. Donna yells a warning, and Bret takes cover as Carl shoots at him. The woman tells Bret not to do it, and Carl asks Bret to let Donna go by. She refuses, and Carl tells her to go outside and try to change Bret's mind.

Donna goes out and Carl shoots at Bret sand misses She turns back and Carl fires again, hitting her in the chest. Bret shoots at Carl, who closes the door. The sheriff knocks Bret out. Carl insists that Bret shot Donna. Bret denies it and says that when she turned around Carl shot her. Nelson reports that Donna is unconscious and it doesn't look like she'll pull through. Bret and Carl have the same caliber of gun, and the sheriff says that Bret is under arrest until Donna wakes up. The gambler tells him to take good care of her because she's the only one who can clear him.

As Bret sits in his cell, Howard visits him and gives him the change from the man buying Fatima. He hasn't heard anything good about Donna, and says that Carl is broken up about Donna's shooting. Carl says he was leaving to go to Crown City to get another doctor, and Howard confirms that he left a few hours ago. Bret says that Howard doesn't look too good and should see Nelson. He confirms that Carl is traveling and Howard has a horse outside, explains that he's going to trail Carl, and punches Howard unconscious. Bret then calls the deputy over and says that Howard is sick. The deputy opens the cell door and Bret punches him unconscious as well, takes his gun, and leaves.

Bret rides after Carl and picks up his trail as he heads for the desert. Carl makes camp and prepares to ride on afterward, and hears a horse approaching. He tosses brush on the fire, and Bret sees the smoke and continues riding up while Carl rides off. Carl dismounts, grabs his rifle, and gets up in the hills to get a clean shot. He shoots, knocking Bret off his horse. Carl comes down and Bret draws and shoots. The owner gets back to his horse and rides before Bret can hit him, and his own horse runs off.

Carl keeps going, figuring that he's in the clear. He stops at a well to water his horse, while Bret catches his horse and rides after him. He arrives at the well and hears a rock fall. Bret discovers that Carl started the rock fall to cover the well. When Bret looks back, he sees a posse coming from Silver Springs, and figures that he has no choice but to ride into the desert. Bret keeps riding, figuring that Carl doesn't have many cartridges left.

The sun rises and Bret walks his horse. Vultures circle overhead and Bret's horse dies. Fatima runs up and Bret mounts her and they go after Carl. They finally catch up to Carl, whose horse has given out like Bret's. Bret keeps coming on and Carl takes cover to shoot at Bret. He soon runs out of shells and surrenders, and the two men fight. Bret wins and hauls Carl back to Silver Springs on Fatima's back.

Back in Silver Springs, Bret hands Carl over to the sheriff. The sheriff says that Donna recovered and told them who shot her, and admits that he's glad Bret busted out of jail. He thanks Bret for bringing Carl in, and Bret says that Fatima deserves the credit and goes to see Donna. Later that day, Bret rides out of town... and Fatima goes after him."

Earlier:

Bart and Bret are riding together to Santa Fe, and go their separate ways when they disagree on which way to go when the path splits. Bret is going to see a woman, Adelaide, and would rather go to Clayton. Bart rides on to Santa Fe, and he decides to spend his time walking around. A woman, Daisy Harris, comes over and asks Bart to pretend he knows her. She points out three men and says that they've been following her for ten minutes.

The three men pass when Bart draws Daisy to the side. Daisy thanks Bart for coming to her help, and asks if she's a strange. She admits that she is, and Bart invites her to look around Santa Fe with her. Daisy agrees and they walk around. The couple take in the local attractions, and at the end of the day Daisy thanks Bart for the wonderful afternoon. She says that her carriage is in the stable across the street, refuses to give her name, but makes sure to confirm Bart is staying at the Barker House.

Later in his room, Bart hears a knock at the door. Henrique Fillipe is there and says that he's an attorney and asks Bart to invite him in. Once Bart does, Fillipe asks if Bart spent the afternoon with Daisy, his client. Bart confirms that he did, and Fillipe says that Daisy is rich but cautious. The attorney says that Daisy is looking for a $500/week job escorting Daisy to Laramie, Wyoming. The trip is dangerous and Daisy wants to go there under an assumed name and an assumed husband.

Bart refuses, and tells Fillipe to tell her that he's flattered but isn't looking for a job. Fillipe says that he has a busy practice and is a rancher, and can't do it himself. Bart says that the job doesn't appeal to him, and Fillipe tells Bart that he'll do his best to make Daisy understand.

Later in the lobby, Bart loses up his poker game and goes to his room to get his $1,000 pinned to the inside of his travel jacket. As he goes back to the game, Daisy approaches him in the hallway and invites Bart into her room. He accepts, and Daisy asks him to reconsider her offer. She says that she wants Bart and feels safe with him. Bart points out that he wouldn't be much help, and Bart asks why she doesn't want to travel on her own. Daisy only says that there's a great deal of money at stake but refuses to give an explanation.

Bart starts to go and Daisy doubles her offer. Bart is tempted to find out what he wants, and says that he already has $1,000. After flashing the bill, Bart goes downstairs to the game. He talks to the desk clerk, who says that Daisy checked in that evening.

After playing into the night and losing, Bart knocks at Daisy's door. She answers, and Bart asks if her offer is still open. Daisy says that it is, and Bart agrees as long as she plays her half in advance. She tells him that Fillipe pick them up at his ranch and has arranged for a stagecoach to stop on the road and pick them up.

The next day, Daisy comes to get Bart. He's won back his money in poker, and asks if he can buy his way out of the job. Daisy says that he can't, and they go to the stagecoach. Fillipe pretends that Bart and Daisy are married under the name ""the Haskells"", and insists that Bart take a rifle with him.

The stagecoach hears for Laramie, and the passengers make small talk among themselves. A Wire Salesman talks about stretching wire across the land. A Cattleman with them objects to stretching barbed wire across the land, and turns to the other passenger. The man, a Book Salesman, says that he sells the Book of Knowledge and is relieved when the Cattleman declares him all right.

When the stagecoach enters into Comanche territory, the driver speeds the horses up. They continue on and arrive in the next town, and the ""Haskells"" check into their suite at the hotel. Daisy comes to see Bart and suggests that they dine together. Bart has her take off her necklace to avoid tempting the local thieves, but she refuses. Bart starts to take it and kisses her. Daisy kisses him back and then takes off the necklace. When Bart offers to get her a gun, Daisy says that she wouldn't know how to use it.

The next day, one man replaces the Book Salesman in the stagecoach. One of them, Mitchell, stares at Bart and Daisy. He says that they look familiar, and Bart tells him that they're strangers to the area. Mitchell introduces himself, and Bart gives his assumed name. When Bart says that they're newlyweds, the Cattleman notes that Daisy said they had been married for five years. Daisy passes it off, saying that they think of themselves as newlyweds.

Mitchell continues staring and finally asks Bart if they met in a poker game. Bart says that he plays whist but not poker, and Mitchell seemingly accepts is story. When the Wire Salesman asks Mitchell what his line of work is, Mitchell says that he handles guns but isn't a gun salesman.

The driver speeds through new Comanche territory, and Bart spots a trail of dust behind them. He takes out the rifle, and Indians ride up on them. Bart, the Cattleman, and Mitchell open fire, and Mitchell tells Bart that he does remember him from a poker game in Dodge City.

The three passengers continue shooting down the Indians, and Mitchell is shot. The Wire Salesman confirms that he's dead, and Bart and the Cattleman keep shooting. The Indians finally give up and ride off.

That night at the hotel, Bart discovers that there's a secret compartment in the butt of the rifle Fillippe gave him. He quickly hides it as Daisy comes in, and insists that they cut to see who gets the hot water in the tub first. They tie, and Daisy smiles smugly and goes to the bath after nodding at Bart to join her.

The next day, the stagecoach leaves the town and the Wire Salesman stays behind. That night, the ""Haskells"" check into their hotel room at the next town, and a man, Snopes, watches them. He checks the ledger and the name they registered in.

Later, Bart comes downstairs and leaves, and Snopes watches him go. He then goes upstairs to the couple's room and knocks at the door, claiming that he's the manager. When Daisy opens the door, Snopes says that she knows him and she'd better lead him in. He wonders why Bart is using a fake name and says that he's always liked Daisy. Snopes says that he has a new business as a groom but could use $100. Daisy agrees to pay him $100, and Snopes doubles his request.

Daisy figures that Snopes is going to blackmail her, and she draws a jeweled derringer and shoots Snopes dead. She plants a revolver on Snopes and calls in Bart and the sheriff. The Sheriff accepts her claim of self-defense and leaves, but Bart doesn't and calls Daisy on it. Daisy says that Snopes was a groom in her family stables in Philadelphia, and knew about her jewelry.

Bart points out that she said she didn't know how to use a gun, and Daisy says that she doesn't trust anyone in the world 100$. She saw no reason to tell Bart that she had a gun and knows how to use it, but Bart doesn't entirely believe her and says that he's leaving unless she gives him the full story. Daisy turns on the tears, but Bart demands to know the reason for Daisy's travel. She asks him to wait until they get to La Mesa for his answers, and Bart agrees to wait until they get to La Mesa. Once Daisy goes to her separate room, Bart looks at her jeweled dagger.

The next day, the stagecoach arrives in La Mesa. The ""Haskells"" check in, and Daisy draws her gun on Bart. She opens the window and pulls down a curtain, then takes out her jewelry. Bart figures that Daisy has set him up, and Daisy tells Bart that her life and the life of the man she loves depends on her carrying it out.

Daisy shoots Bart twice, and he falls to the floor. She screams and hides the jewelry and her derringer in the rifle's hidden compartment. The other guests come running, and Daisy comes out and claims that a man shot Bart and then fled out the window. Mrs. Adams, one of the guests, and her husband Fred tend to Daisy. The other guests call for a doctor, but another man comes out of the hotel room and tells the doctor that there's nothing the doctor can do for Bart. The sheriff arrives, and he goes into the room with the guest.

The next day, the La Mesa sheriff questions Daisy about the shooting. She claims that she doesn't know what gun the killer used, and the sheriff says that the undertaker--Fred Carter-- took derringer bullets out of Bart's body. Daisy claims that the killer must have used her gun, and that the handle was encrusted with jewels. Bart jumped the killer, and that's when he shot Bart. The sheriff picks up the rifle where Daisy left it, checks it, confirms that it wasn't fired, but doesn't find the hidden compartment. Daisy says that the rifle belonged to Bart, and the sheriff puts the rifle back down.

Later at Carter's undertaking parlor, Carter meets with Bart. Bart is looking at the powder burns on his shirt, and says that he should have taken out the powder along with the bullets when he sabotaged the gun earlier. Carter assures Bart that they'll let Daisy see Bart's ""body"", but they won't bury Bart for real.

The sheriff comes in and says that he isn't sure if he can continue with the deception. He tells Bart that Daisy sent a telegram to Fillippe, and she's delaying the funeral until Fillippe arrives the next day. The sheriff can't arrest Daisy unless he has a charge. Bart tells the sheriff that he needs to find out what Daisy is up to, and they won't find out if she's in jail. The sheriff says that he checked the rifle when Daisy was out of the room, and confirmed the jewelry as inside.

Daisy arrives at the parlor and Bart hides before she can see him. She says that Fillippe will be there the next afternoon, and Carter agrees to wait. Once Daisy leaves, Bart emerges from hiding.

The next day, Fillippe arrives in town and comes to the parlor with Daisy. Carter tells Bart, who gets into the coffin and pretends to be dead. A fly lands on Bart's forehead and then nose, and Daisy and Fillippe come in. Bart blows the fly off before they come over, and after a brief glance Carter leads Daisy and Fillippe into the next room where the mourners are gathered.

Later, Bart is ""buried"" and Daisy leaves flowers at the tombstone, with the sheriff and Carter looking on. Daisy and Fillippe return to Daisy's room, and Fillippe says that now they're safe. He points out that Daisy has been getting more tense by the hour, and Daisy wonders why they did it. Fillippe points out that he shot Daisy's real husband in self-defense, and now they're safe.

Fillippe assures Daisy that he hid the real John Haskell's body, and now everyone will believe he died in La Mesa. Daisy settles down and they kiss, and then she screams as Bart comes in through the window. She faints, and Fillippe attacks Bart. Bart easily knocks him out, then lets the waiting sheriff in and says that Daisy is ready to tell him the full story.

When Daisy recovers, she makes a full confession. The sheriff takes her and Fillippe back to Santa Fe. Bart is watching, and Daisy looks briefly at him. Bart gets in a couch, and finds Bret there. Bret admits that things didn't work out with Adelaide, and Bart gives him a cigar and invites Bret to tell him his story."

The brothers greet each other and Bret introduces him to the other players. He then returns to playing one man, Longhurst, and raises the pot to $6,000. Longhurst doesn't have $3,000 with him and Bret offers to take him at his word. Bret says that they owe him $9,000 and says that he figures the $9,000 will buy him into their ring. Longhurst agrees and Bret reveals the winning hand. As the players go, Longhurst says that there's a small auction the next day for a ship, the Flying Scudd.

Once they're alone Bret says that he thought he needed Bart's help to get into the ring but he pulled it off on his own. He then takes Bart out on the town.

The next day the brothers attend the auction. The auctioneer declares that the Flying Scudd is valued at $10,000 and the buyer assumes all costs for the beached ship. Bret tells Bart that they'll get it for $300, and after expenses they'll clear $8,000. The auction begins and Longhurst raises the bidding to $300 before dropping out. A lawyer, Bellairs, bids $350. Bret continues raising the bid and Bellairs matches the bids. Bart wonders if Bret is getting whipsawed, but Bret continues bidding and Bellairs continues raising.

Longhurst calls an end to the bidding, and tells Bret that he doesn't know who Bellairs is and says that the ring will back Bret's bid up to $5,000. The bidding continues to $5,000, but Bellairs outbids him. When Bret asks for a few minutes to consider, Bellairs says that Bret will have to bid within one minute and the auctioneer agrees. Longhurst refuses to back Bret and leaves, and Bret figures that there's something on the Flying Scudd that Bellairs wants. He notes that there's a war in China and something like bullion was smuggled out on the ship.

Bart agrees to support Bret, and the bidding continues to $21,000. Bellairs says that he's representing his principal and has gone $500 over his limit. He asks for 20 minutes to see his client, but the auctioneer tells him that it's against the auction house policy. Bellairs drops out and Bret wins the Flying Scudd.

Bart goes to the hotel to get the money, and sees Bellairs drinking at the bar. Sitting down next to him, Bart offers to buy Bellairs a drink. Bellairs breaks into tears saying the Mavericks outbid him, and refuses to his identify his client. He admits that he doesn't know why his client wanted the Flying Scudd, and Bart offers Bellairs $500 to cover his commission and tell him who the client is. He says that for $500 he's hired Bellairs and his first obligation is to tell him the client is. Bellairs gives him the name and address of the client, James Dixon.

When he arrives at the address, Bart knocks on the door and claims that he has a telegram. Dixon approaches the door with the gun, and Bart admits who he is and says that he's there about the Flying Scudd. He explains that he owns the ship and suggests that they discuss the matter. Dixon refuses to talk to him, and Bart leaves.

A few hours later, Bart meets with Bret and tells him that Dixon never came out. Bret has learned the Flying Scudd is registered with the commission, and the captain, Wicks and the crew have disappeared when they got to San Francisco. Wicks contacted the owners and they put the ship up for auction. Bret has signed 60-day notes to cover the bid, and Bart gives him the money to pass the word about finding the crew.

The brothers check the docks and Bart finds a sailor. He pays the man to direct him to a crewman, Jerome Braus. Bart goes there and finds empty liquor bottles but no sign of Braus. Dixon knocks Bart out and Braus comes in. he addresses ""Dixon"" by his real name, Paul Carthew, and insists that they kill Bart. Carthew refuses and tells Braus that he had share, and tells him to leave but be where he can find him. He says that he'll take care of Bart if it becomes necessary and Braus leaves.

After Bart wakes up, he goes back to Bret's room and tells his brother what happened. Bart figures that they need to hire a captain and a crew, and Bret says that there's probably a captain who will work for them on commission. They go back to the docks and Bart finds a captain, Nares. Nares knows they bought the Flying Scudd for $20,000, and Bart convinces him that Bret is onto a good thing. Nares demands $40,000 and they haggle the price to $35,000. The captain tells Bart to be aboard the Nora Creina in the morning.

The next morning, Bart and Bret arrive at the Nora Creina. Bret is going to stay to deal with the creditors, and suggests that they forget the whole thing. Bart refuses and goes aboard the Nora Creina, and the crew cast off. Carthew is secretly among them.

The Nora Creina heads to sea and Carthew brings the seasick Bart some food. Bart thinks that he recognizes Carthew from his voice but Carthew denies knowing him and leaves.

Later, Bart goes up on deck and mentions Carthew bringing his food. Nares doesn't know him, and later asks Carthew if he knows Bart and what's aboard the Flying Skudd. Carthew reminds Nares that he paid him $2,000 to bring him aboard and not ask question, and Nares seemingly dismisses the matter.

The Nora Creina soon arrives at the Flying Scudd, which is hung up on an underwater reef. Nares takes Bart there and has Carthew go with them, while the rest of the crew scout the nearby Midway Island for fresh fruit and water. The three men go aboard the Flying Scudd and check the hold, and confirm that there's rice and silk. Nares figures the cargo isn't worth more than $3,000, and Bart has him order the crew to tear the ship apart. Once Nares sends Carthew to get the crew, he points out to Bart that the ship could have been lifted off the reef and wonders why the original crew left the Flying Scudd there.

The crew search the ship but find nothing. Bart notices Carthew going below and follows him, and finds him searching the captain's cabin. He finds a small box belonging to the ship's first mate, and Bart gets the drop on Carthew. Carthew offers Bart whatever he wants in San Francisco, and says that Bart will have to kill him to get the box. Bart figures that Carthew isn't bluffing and lets him go. He follows Carthew out and discovers that the crew have found opium hidden in the rice bales. Nares says that it's only worth $13,000 but there are ways of getting the opium into the U.S. Bart tells him to dump it overboard, and Nares draws his gun on Bart. Carthew takes Bart's gun but then knocks the gun out of Nares' hand and draws his own gun on him.

Bart ties Nares up and Carthew tells him that Bart could have killed him but didn't so he repaid the favor. They have the rest of the crew disarm, and then he and Carthew tie them up. Nares wonders how they're going to sail away without him and his crew, and warns that Carthew will double-cross Bart just like he double-crossed him. Bart doesn't believe it, and he and Carthew dump the opium. Carthew says that they'll have to let the crew loose and can't watch them the entire time, and suggests that they take one of the small boats. Bart agrees, even though the chances of them being picked up are small.

The two men sail off and drift out of the trade lanes. Bart asks what Carthew's story is, and Carthew explains that he was a remittance man in New Zealand and stole the first mate's log. There was murder aboard the Flying Scudd and he was part of it. He and his crew of pearl fishers made a haul, fled a Dutch cutter, and cracked up on Midway. The Flying Scudd saw their fire and picked them up, but the crew wanted all of their pearls. A fight started and Carthew was hit across the head. When he woke up, Wicks and his crew were dead. Carthew and the fishermen pretended to be the crew and were picked up and taken to San Francisco. The log has all of their names listed, and if he had gone to the authorities then he would have been arrested for murder. Carthew had enough money from selling the pearls to buy the Flying Scudd, go back, and get the log. Bart tells Carthew that he believes him.

The boat continues drifting, and Bart and Carthew run low on supplies. Bart sees a ship in the distance, wakes up a sleeping Carthew, and Carthew says that he deserves to die. He blames himself for Bart being there when he didn't tell him what was going on in San Francisco. Carthew doesn't see the ship, and says that he'd make things up to Bart if he could, and Bart notes that Bret is up to his neck in debt. He asks what Carthew would do if he could, and Carthew says that he has $50,000 in the bank in San Francisco and would pay it all. Bart suggests that he'd rather die a rich man and asks Carthew to write him a draft, and Carthew humors him.

Bret is aboard the ship, and a crewman spots Bart and Carthew. Watching through a telescope, Bret sees his brother and says that they can head back to San Francisco. Meanwhile, Bart has Carthew look over his shoulder before he can hand over the draft. Carthew gives it to Bart anyway and Bart tosses the log into the ocean. The two men smile and shake hands."

Bret finally tells Parker to put down his gun, then comes up behind him and takes Parker inside. Parker recognizes Bret, who asks Parker where the money he lost in poker came from. Bret explains that the money was taken from a robbed stagecoach. Parker admits that he knew it was stolen money, and Bret explains that the marshal in Quillary figures Bret stole it. Bret escaped, and tells Parker to come with him to Quillary to clear him. Parker insists that he didn't know it was stolen, and the three men who gave him the money were Shield, Kane, and Johnny. Johnny gave Parker the money and has a habit of twisting a gold ring on his finger.

Bret isn't impressed and tells Parker to move. Parker refuses to go, telling Bret that he'll have to drag him. he goes for his gun and they struggle, In the fight, Parker ends up shooting himself and Bret figures that he has no way to clear himself.

Five days later, Bret goes to Bandera to find the three robbers. He sees a sandwich board man, Ponca Brown, walking down the street advertising the Red Front Casino. Ponca comes over and recognizes Bret as a gambler, and says that there's an opening at the casino for a dealer because the old one was shot dead. Giving Ponca a dollar to keep his secret, Bret says that he's using the name ""Bret Martin"".

Bret goes around town and asks about the three men. He has no luck and goes to the Red Front looking for strangers in town. Ponca introduces him to the owner, Cora Beth. Cora tells Bret that he'll do as a dealer. Bret says that he's looking for a game, not a job, and as Cora watches away Ponca warns him not to look at her because the other dealer did the same, and a man, Stacey Johnson, killed him. ""Johnny"" is the meanest man in town and made Doc Holliday back down.

Bret notices that Johnny is twisting his gold ring. He goes over to where Johnny is dealing, buys in, and tells Johnny that he knows him. Johnny says that Doc is a cheap tinhorn and a sick man, and Bret tells him that he can't imagine Doc backing down. Cora overhears them, tells them to play nice, and says that she wants to see Johnny in her office when he's done. Bret goes up to Cora's office and says that he'll take the job. Cora says that her husband ran the casino better, and his name was Cole Creighton. Cole was killed robbing a bank, and he left Cora the casino. She sends Bret to relieve Johnny.

Ten days later, Bret doesn't find Shield or Kane. He gets close enough to Johnny that the two of them are friendly, but Johnny doesn't say much else. Doc arrives while Bret is dealing and recognizes him. He's heard a lot about Bret and mistakes him for Johnny. He challenges Bret to a gunfight because of the slur to his reputation. Ponca confirms that Bret isn't the regular dealer, and Doc apologizes for the mistake. He asks Bret to go upstairs and tell Johnny in Cora's office that he's there.

Bret figures that he has to keep Johnny alive to eventually clear him. He enters Cora's office without knocking and Johnny draws on him. Bret tells him that he made have made a mistake and Doc is downstairs wanting an apology. Johnny isn't impressed and tells Cora that he can take him. Bret confirms that Doc was gambling and winning, and says that Doc doesn't like to kill a man who is winning because he thinks it brings him bad luck. Johnny concedes the point but figures that he can't back down. Bret suggests that there's another way out and asks to speak to Cora alone outside. Cora agrees and tells Johnny to wait in her office.

Cora and Bret go out on the balcony and Bret asks if it's worth $10,000 to keep Johnny alive. He suggests that he get Doc into a game and keep him occupied while Cora convinces Johnny to leave town. Bret goes down and tells Doc that Johnny is in a business meeting with Cora. He invites Doc to play cards with him while they wait, and takes out a marked deck that Cora gave him on his request. Doc refuses, saying that he's had a losing streak, and Bret says that he has well and offers to bet Doc on it. They play blackjack and Doc loses... but they were betting on the losing hand.

Cora watches from her office and says that she wants her money's worth, but Johnny isn't impressed. She says that Shields and Kane will be back with the information she sent them out for, and then she can take the money and set herself up in Frisco with a bigger casino. Johnny wants half instead of a fourth, and Cora asks for time to think about it.

Doc wins on a lucky streak thanks to Bret setting him up. Johnny comes down and the customers move out of the line of fire. Doc says that they have some unfinished business, but he's having a lucky streak and figures they can settle up later. Johnny agrees, figuring that Doc is backing down again, and goes to the bar to buy a round of drinks. Bret deals Doc another winning hand.

Ponca drinks at the bar and says that he can take Doc. The bartender, Gus, cuts him off. Bret keeps dealing winning hands to Doc, and Ponca heads home. However, he draws his gun on Doc's back. Bret sees him and shoots the gun out of his hand, and Doc draws on him. The dealer tells Doc to look over his shoulder, and Ponca says that he wouldn't have shot him in the back and runs off. Bret claims that he was afraid that Ponca would hit him. Doc calls it for the night and checks the deck, and notices that it's marked. He tells Bret that he's disappointed in him because he's been cheating him, letting him win. Doc says that he'll spare Bret's life as a ""favor"" for saving his life, but he'll still go after Johnny.

Cora has seen the entire thing from upstairs, and comes down and congratulates Bret. She says that he's cool and Johnny is a hothead, and she wants Bret to take Johnny's place in the things that matter. Cora tells Bret that their next robbery is bigger than the $10,000 they took in the last robbery. Bret agrees and explains that they have two other partners who will be back in the morning. Cora regrets that she spent $10,000 to keep Johnny alive before she learned she didn't need him.

Bret figures the stolen money is in a safe in Cora's office. He sneaks in an hour later and it takes him until sunrise to get the first two numbers. Cora gets up, and Bret gets the third number. He takes one bill of each denomination for evidence, Bret fakes coming in as Cora comes into the office, gun drawn. He says that he thought they'd celebrate their new partnership over breakfast. When Bret offers to go, Cora points out that Doc is out there and will shoot him on sight, and Bret says that's why he came over early. She sends him to get a bottle of champagne from Gus.

As he leaves the casino to get his horse, he finds the Quillary marshal and his men waiting for him. The marshal says that they captured Shields and Kane, and have cleared Bret of the robbery. The marshal sends his men in to get Johnny, and Bret gives him the bills and says that he needs to leave town. As the deputies bring out Cora, Johnny sees them from across the street and hides. The marshal tells Bret that he can leave, and Bret heads for his horse before Doc spots him.

Bret goes to the stable, and Johnny gets the drop on him. Johnny figures that Bret is a lawman, and says that they're going to ride out of town so no one hears his gun when he kills Bret. Doc comes in and points out that their business isn't completed. He notes that Johnny has his gun out and he hasn't, and invites Johnny to back him down. Johnny tries to shoot and Doc draws and kills him. He then holsters his gun and tells Bret to go for his gun. Doc laughs and says that he knew Bret would do it, and says that he was wrong to think Bret and Johnny were friends. He's remembered Bret and says that his business in Bandera is finished. Bret says that his is as well and they ride off together."

The doorman Tom has never heard of him and refuses to let him enter. Club member Jerome Horne leaves and a man, Alex Jennings, confronts him in the street. Alex complains that the committee voted not to give him the money. Jerome says that the committee doesn't give money to crackpots, but Alex doesn't believe him. Bret comes up behind Alex and disarms Alex, and Jerome thanks him for intervention but says that Alex didn't have the courage to pull the trigger. He gives the gun back to Alex and invites him to shoot. Alex can't, and says that Oliver would have been a martyr if he died but can be beaten if he's alive. He figures that Jerome will eventually go too far and then he'll fall hard.

Once Alex leaves, Jerome tells Bret that Alex plans to build a five-mile long line into the Comstock mine to cart out the ore and vent the mines. They exchange introductions and Jerome dismisses Alex as someone who shows up after the hard work is done and petitions for better working conditions. Bret says that he couldn't get into the club, and Jerome takes him back and brings him in.

Jerome introduces Bret to the businessmen playing poker, including his partner John Bordeen. He wishes Bret luck and leaves, and Bret sits down to play. He soon beats John, and John asks for a chance to win back the $5,000 that he's lost. John offers Bret a bet for the money that he can cut to the Ace of Spades. Bret accepts double or nothing, and shuffles a deck. John takes out a knife and stabs it through the deck, and declares himself the winner. Bret tells him that he owes $10,000 and reveals that he palmed the ace out of the deck. John angrily leaves, saying he'll have the money in his office in one hour.

Bret goes to John's office and the clerk, Mr. Venner, says that John is waiting. John is in his chair, and turns. He complains that Bret has bad manners, and says that he's not going to pay Bret. John figures that Bret is a card shark and refuses to pay off card sharks, but Bret tells him that he doesn't get off that easy. He promises to spread the story that John is a welsher, and starts to leave. John pulls a gun from his drawer and shoots, hitting the door behind Bret, and Bret is forced to shoot him in self-defense.

Venner hears the shots and hovers outside the office door. Meanwhile, Bret confirms that John is dead and leaves. He tells Venner to get the sheriff, then realizes that he'll have to do it himself because Venner is too shocked. Bret ends up going to the sheriff's home to report the shooting. The sheriff says that it shouldn't go too badly for Bret if it was self-defense, and they go back to the office. Venner claims not to recognize Bret from two hours ago. They go into John's office and find no sign of the body, no bloodstains on the carpet, and no bullets in the door. The sheriff assumes Bret is playing a joke and tells him to get out.

Bret wonders where to begin to get his $10,000 back and goes after Venner. A man, Norman Brock, follows him. Bret gets Venner's address and looks for his address. When he arrives, a woman says that Venner was stuck down by a wagon.

The next day, Bret visits Jerome at his ranch and tells him what happened. Jerome says that John is in his foyer, and John apologies for his rudeness and pays the $10,000. Bret leaves and Brock comes out. Jerome tells Brock to follow Bret and that John will have to put up with it if he wants to be a millionaire.

Returning to Virginia City, Bret figures that he should head for San Francisco rather than try to prove he ""killed"" John. As he waits for the stage the next day, Jane Vaughn calls to him by name and says that they only met once in a club in New Orleans. Bret says that he remembers her and Jane tells him that she's staying with her brother. He invites her to join him for a ride in the country and picnic lunch, and Jane accepts.

As they picnic, Bret asks why Jane talked to him. He tells her that he made up where he claimed he remembered her from, saying that he would have remembered her because she's beautiful. ""Jane"" admits that her real name is Ellen Bordeen, John's niece and the daughter of his brother Ralph. Ellen says that John is missing. They live on a small ranch and she left for a few days. When she returned, John and his clothes had disappeared and there was no note. Ellen came to Virginia City to see if Ralph had seen him. Ellen asks if Bret killed John, and Bret says that he did but in self-defense. She explains that 20 years ago John cheated Ralph out of a gold claim and he used the money to build his business. Bret says that Ralph is posing as John and is at Jerome's ranch. Ellen insists that Ralph is posing as John against his will, and the sheriff was put into office because of Jerome. Bret says that he won't help her because he has his money.

Bret packs up the wagon and Ellen draws a gun on him. She says that she's going to take his $10,000 until he helps her find out why Ralph is posing as John. Ellen fires a warning shot and demonstrates her marksmanship, and says that if he doesn't help she'll kill him and use his $10,000 to hire someone who will help her. She has Bret set the $10,000 in the wagon and step aside, then gets in the wagon, takes the money, and drives off.

That night, Ellen returns to her apartment and Bret grabs her. He's already checked the place and confirmed the $10,000 isn't in there, and figures Ellen has it on her. Ellen says that it's glued to the bottom of a drawer, and knocks Bret over the head with a flower vase as he checks.

Later, Bret wakes up and finds the $10,000 next to him on the carpet. Ellen is calmly sitting nearby and says that the money is all there. She admits that she gave up, and says that she misjudged Bret. Ellen admits that he came after the money rather than do what she wanted. Bret starts to go, and then kisses Ellen and tells her that they're in business. He agrees to find out more about why Jerome is using Ralph.

Bret breaks into the office and figures that Jerome and Ralph had time to switch the doors. He checks the hinges and discovers that they were worked on recently, and works out that it's been switched for the closet door in the main room. Brock gets the drop on him and has him kick over his gun belt, and then prepares to shoot Bret in the back. Alex shoots at Brock and misses, and Brock runs off. Bret assures Alex that he did fine, and Alex explains that he was following Bret and saw Brock. Alex confirms that Brock works for Jerome and John, and asks to talk to Bret about his having shot John.

They go to Alex's place and Alex explains that there's heat coming from underground springs, releasing gas into the tunnels. His line would lower the temperature and release the gases, and he's been working for 16 years. Jerome and Ralph have been delaying him for all of that time, making him a figure of public ridicule. They make their money from the railroad carting out the ore, and Alex's tunnel will reduce the distance to a tenth and eliminate their money. Over 400 miners who have died working in the Comstock Lode due to the gas or heat, and Jerome and Ralph have kept the information secret. Alex figures that Jerome is covering up John's death because it would throw the company into probate and the company records would be made public. The investors might panic and withdraw their money, forcing the company into bankruptcy. Bret confirms that Jerome is forcing Ralph to pose as John, and Alex figures that it's chance to expose Jerome. The gambler isn't interested in helping, and Alex warns him that sometimes they can't stay out of other people's business.

The next day, Bret goes out to Jerome's ranch with a wagon. He tells the guard that he's delivering a fence post from the lumber company, and offers to show the guard the shipping orders. Ellen is there with a gun and they capture the guard. They then go inside and find Ralph, and he assures Ellen that he's fine. Ralph explains that he no longer objects to Jerome's scheme. He likes the idea of being a millionaire partner and wants Ellen to join him. Ralph says that John cheated him out of what was his so they've lived in poverty. Ellen agrees with Ralph and Bret wishes them goodbye. She figures that Bret objects.

Jerome and Brock come in, Brock holding Bret at gunpoint. Ellen refuses to let Brock kill Bret, insisting that they're not murderers. Bret notes that he can't hurt them and they should let him go. No one believed him when he said he killed John, and no one will believe him if he tries to say that Ralph has taken John's place. Bret says that he'll head to San Francisco, and Brock holsters his gun. Ellen tries to slap him and Bret stops her, wishing her ""happy money"". Jerome tells Ellen not to let Bret disturb her, and she claims that he doesn't.

As Bret boards the stagecoach, there's a gas explosion at the mine and the locals insist on taking Bret with them to help. They get out the survivors and Alex finds Bret. Alex figures that Bret couldn't stay out of other people's business, and Bret passes out from the heat. He wakes up outside and finds Ellen at his side. She says that she's on Alex's side and Bret's after hearing that Bret had ""volunteered"". Ellen thanks Bret for volunteering and making her see things differently. They kiss and Ellen tells him that they'll have to rescue Ralph again. They go to Ellen's carriage, and Brock sees them go, having overheard them talk.

At the carriage, Brock draws on both of them and orders them to a nearby barn so he can kill them. Bret whispers to Ellen to faint on cue. Brock says that they'll die accidentally in a carriage accident, and Ellen faints. Bret dives to the side and shoots Brock dead, and discovers that Ellen fainted for real. She wakes up and Bret assures her that everything is fine.

Five days later, Jerome is arrested for murder, Ralph is rescued again, Alex goes to Washington, and Bret and Ellen go on their picnic."

-----

Ten weeks ago in Denver, Bret is at a hotel riding poker. He notices a woman, Margaret Ross, comes in looking for Bret. She checks with a porter and confirms that it's Bret, and has the porter take a note to him. It's an invitation for Bret to come to her room in ten minutes. Bret excuses himself and goes to Margaret's room. She says that it's a business matter and she's a widow, and asks Bret to accompany her on a trip. Margaret will pay him $1,000 for protection along with a suitcase full of $200,000. Margaret explains that she's taking it to North Span, Montana, and that Mr. Peterson assured Bret that he's honest, discreet, capable, and a gentleman. Bret tells her that the suitcase never leaves his sight and Margaret says that it's not an issue.

Bret and Margaret are soon aboard the stagecoach heading to North Span. Margaret avoids talking to Bret. They stay over at a hotel and have dinner, and Margaret refuses to discuss herself. They continue on and another passenger tells him that he has a handsome wife. Bret doesn't contradict him, and puts an arm around Margaret's shoulders. Margaret smiles and doesn't tell him to stop.

The stagecoach arrives in Laramie. After they check in, Bret asks Margaret how he can get to know her. He suggests that they enjoy the town, but Margaret gently says that she's staying in for a bath and tells him to leave the suitcase with her. He goes to get it but keeps one bill, and shows it to a local banker. The banker's teller confirms that it's counterfeit, and Bret sets it on fire to light his cigar rather than hand it over for the manager to give to the government.

Bret and Margaret continue, and Margaret dozes off. Bret wakes her up and she tells him her first name, then goes back to sleep. They arrive in the next town, and check in as husband and wife. Bret asks the desk clerk to get them two separate rooms, claiming that he snores, and the clerk says that they only have a single room because the cattle buyers are in town. Margaret glares at Bret, who shrugs.

In the room, Margaret tells Bret to sleep in the livery stable and leave the money there. He refuses and Margaret figures that he's enjoying himself. Bret says that she's staying close-mouthed, and insists that he doesn't have designs on her or her money. Margaret asks what is bothering him, and Bret kisses her. She kisses him back for a minute and then backs away, saying that things are confused enough already before hugging him.

Bret ends up in the livery stable, and the next day he and Margaret continue on. John Grimes and his friend Andrew Wiggins are their fellow passengers, and Wiggins says that they had a successful visit buying cattle. They exchange introductions, and Margaret thinks that she recognizes John. He flirts with her and she talks about the farmland. John and Wiggins chuckle and say that Montana is grazing land. Wiggins explains that John will become the first governor when Montana becomes a state in a few years. John defers but says that he would serve as a governor if he was needed. He invites Margaret to have dinner with him so they can discuss his platform. Margaret says that she has an engagement and glances at Bret, who smiles smugly.

The stagecoach continues on and after John and Wiggins leave, Margaret accuses Bret of being jealous. Bret assures her that he isn't and they joke about Bret becoming governor. She admits that she doesn't like John.

When they arrive in North Span and check in, Margaret wakes up Bret the next morning and tells him that they're going to get rid of the money by putting it in a bank. They meet with the bank manager, Bradshaw, and Margaret asks him to hold the $200,000 in a strongbox. She has Bret present the suitcase full of counterfeit money. Bradshaw tries to convince her to deposit the money, and Margaret says that her late husband lost his $500,000 when his bank closed. The manager takes her to the strongbox.

After Margaret stores the money, she and Bret go back to their hotel and Margaret gives Bret his $1,000. Bret checks it to see if they're counterfeit without saying why, and Margaret kisses him and says that it's goodbye. He tells her that he's leaving yet and kisses her back, and Margaret says that she doesn't want complications. Bret says that she hits hard, and Margaret tells him that she's not in love with her. He asks who she is in love with, and Margaret says that she can't afford to be in love with anyone. Bret figures that they'll see and leaves.

Later, Bret watches Margaret leave the bank and go to the local newspaper, the Territorial Times. Bret goes in and Bradshaw tells him that Margaret has gotten what she came after. Bradshaw confirms that she did, and asks Bret if she seems eccentric to him. He finds it odd that she left $200,000 in a strongbox, and wonders why she borrowed $20,000 at 8%. Bradshaw admits that he'll make money on the interest, and Margaret has collateral from the $200,000 and the property. He finally says that she bought the newspaper.

At his ranch, learns from one of his men that Margate bought the Times even though he's been covering the previous owner's losses for two years, and the owner has left town. Wiggins warns him that there's nothing he can do about it and it would be bad politics if he did. His man tells him that Margaret bought the Times, and John figures that he's charmed her enough that he can marry her and get the newspaper.

Margaret soon publishes a newspaper with an editorial about how farmers have been run out of town by the cattle cabal. She promises to identify the leading members of the cabal in the next edition. John and Wiggins read the paper and John promises to stop Margaret. He visits her as Bret are there, and says that he knows the cattle ranchers. Bret ""translates"", saying that John wants her to attack the farmers. John denies it and Margaret says that she can see what's going on. Once John leaves, Bret offers Margaret his gun.

The next edition goes to print with a headline about the true John Grimes, who was thrown out of Texas. Bret sees John storm into the newspaper office and listens at the door. Inside, John tells Margaret that her story is untrue. She vows to stop him from becoming the governor of Montana, and says that she knows who he is and what he's up to. Margaret warns that if any violence happens, people will know who is responsible and will come for him. Once he leaves, Bret goes in and comforts Margaret. He offers to make an honest housewife out of her, and admits that he fell in love with her. Margaret refuses to admit her feelings, and Bret tells her that she can't fight herself.

Bret walks Margaret home and asks if she needs someone to talk to. She tells him that she can't and Bret says that he owes her a favor for not paying her with counterfeit money. Reconsidering, Margaret brings Bret in and explains that she was from Texas. John and his men were beating people, and her husband ran a newspaper and she helped him. John had his men burn down the Texas newspaper, beat Mr. Ross, and left him for dead. He was crippled and broken in mind and spirit, dying in poverty and bitterness. At the end Mr. Ross had a rage for vengeance and printed his own money to fight John. He told Margaret when he was dying and made her swear she wouldn't let John get away with it. Margaret saved the money until she could use it to get a loan to buy the newspaper and go after John. Bret asks if she loves her, and Margaret admits that she can't let anything turn her from her vow. Shrugging, Bret says that he'll help her while he waits for her.

The next day, Bret and Margaret discover that John's men attacked a newsboy and took his papers. Margaret prints more papers and Bret goes with the newsboy to hand out the papers. Once he leaves, Mrs. Effie Walker comes in and tells Margaret that the townspeople think highly of her. Effie and her husband Jeb are farmers, and Effie says that her husband knows things about John that would put him into the penitentiary if they got out. However, he's never said anything because he was afraid John would have him killed. Now Jeb is dying and hopes Margaret will pay him money so that Effie can get by. Effie says that Margaret can meet Jeb out of town to get his story.

When Bret and the newsboy return, they find a note from Margaret saying that she's going out to the Walker farm. The newsboy tells Bret that the Walkers moved back east a year ago. Bret rides after Margaret, and John's gunman fires shots to panic her wagon horse. It runs out of control and the gunman leaves. When Bret arrives, he finds the wagon at the bottom of a hill along the road. He goes down and checks on Margaret.

Later in North Span, the doctor announces that Margaret is dead. The sheriff is in the crowd, and Bret tells him that he's looking for John. He assures the sheriff that he's no gunfighter and it will be a fair fight. Bret goes down the street with the townspeople following him. The gambler finds John and tells him that Margaret is dead. John feigns innocence, but Bret says that he killed her and didn't have the courage to show her his fight. The townspeople get out of the line of fire, and Bret repeats his accusation. He says that John is a liar and a coward, and tells John that he can ride out of town and he won't stop him. John draws his gun, shoots, and hits Bret in the leg. Bret doesn't miss.

Later at the Times, the townspeople talk about how Margaret showed them what needed to be done. They promise that Margaret's memory will keep them proud and strong. Bret goes to the bank and steals the $200,000 from the strongbox.

-----

Bret finishes his story, telling the sheriff that he couldn't let it come out that Margaret was using counterfeit money.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0644480/?ref_=ttep_ep17,,Bret is selected to serve on the jury of a murder trial and finds himself the only member who refuses to believe that the defendant is guilty.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Richard L. Bare'],"['', '']",[],"['murder trial', 'jury', 'romantic triangle', 'jury deliberation', 'false accusation of murder', 'deadlocked jury']",[],"Outside town, two guards hear gunshots and ride to a house. They see a man, Bill Gregg, running out and holding a gun. The men order Bill to drop the gun, and they confirm that the owner, Sloan, is dead. Bill says that John Sloan tried to kill him, and the men tie Bill up and take him to the sheriff.

At a saloon in town, Bret is playing poker when the sheriff comes in and asks him to come to the jail with him. He says that Bill thinks that Bret can help him out, and insists that Bret come with him. At the jail, Bill reminds Bret that he waved to him as he rode by, and figures that Bret saw someone else ride to Sloan's house. Bret doesn't remember passing anyone on the road, including Sloan. Bill says that Sloan invited him out to his place to lend him some money. Bret remembers Sloan at the saloon extending the invitation, and Sloan refused Billy. One of the men who captured Bill, Slim, points out that Sloan had several thousand dollars from a cattle sale.

The sheriff doesn't believe Bill and has him empty his pockets. Bill has $6,000, and Bret says that at the saloon Bill asked Sloan for $3,000.

The next day, Bret is back playing poker. The sheriff comes in and says that he's there to gather men for a jury. Bret wins the hand and the sheriff picks all four players, including Bret. Bret points out that he isn't a resident, and the owner Charlie Caldwell offers to put him up while the sheriff points out that Bret is in town making a living playing cards.

The trial begins and Bill's lawyer Jabe Hallock doesn't believe Bill's story. Bill's girlfriend Lucy Cutter does. The prosecutor, Blaine, comes in and greets Jabe. Jabe says that it hasn't been long enough since the last time he saw him, and Blaine says that they've had a few years to forget their differences. He warns Jabe not to make it a grudge match, and says that he asked for the case. Jabe says that he asked for the case because he doesn't think much of Blaine, and figures that Blaine doesn't care about the townspeople. He promises not to let Blaine use Bill's case to pave his way to the governorship.

The trial begins and Blaine calls Charlie as a witness. Charlie testifies that Bill talked to Sloan as he was playing cards with Bret.

-----

Bill asks for a $3,000 loan to build a new place, and offers his current cabin at 10%. Bill explains that he and Lucy plan to get married, and admits that the bank won't loan him the money. Sloan says that it must stick in the craw from him, and refuses. He says that he doesn't want to lend and tells Bill to stop begging. Bill reminds him that his father loaned Sloan to get started and Sloan never paid it back. When Sloan says that Bill's father embezzled a lot of his money, Bill goes for his gun and Bill stops him.

-----

Jabe cross-examines Charlie and confirms that Sloan called Bill a thief. Next, Blaine calls Slim who confirms that someone cut through the fence to get to the house. Jabe cross-examines and asks if Bill looked mean or scared. When Blaine objects, Jabe loudly says that Bill supposedly snuck in the back but ran out the front. When Jabe cross-examines the sheriff, he confirms that Bill wasn't drunk despite Blaine implying that he was. The shop owner confirms that he sold a pair of cutters to Bill, and Blaine tries to enter it into evidence. Jabe has the owner confirm that the clippers are Bill's and tells the jury that they'll find out why later on.

Later, Jabe cross-examines the town doctor and asks if Bill has a mean streak. Jabe calls Bill ""Billy"", and Blaine objects saying that Jabe is trying to make the defendant out as harmless. The judge rules in favor of Blaine and Jabe finishes his questioning. Jabe then tells the jury that Blaine thinks Bill fighting for his life is a joke, and accuses the prosecutor of speeding up the case. He calls Bill to the stand and has him testify what happened.

-----

The afternoon of the shooting, Sloan rode up to Bill's cabin and said that he didn't come intending trouble. Bill agrees to hear him out, and Sloan says that he thought about Bill's request. He tells Bill that bracing him in the saloon rode him the wrong way. Sloan insists that he paid off his debt to Bill's father, and he didn't say anything at the saloon because it would have made him look like he was trying to squirm out of paying the money. He tells Bill to take money with no interest, but doesn't want him to tell anyone. Bill agrees and Sloan asks him to ride over to get the money and he'll clip the fence for him to get through. Before he goes, Sloan has Bill swear that he won't tell anyone.

-----

Blaine cross-examines Bill, who says that Sloan took his clippers to cut the wire. No one saw Bill, and Blaine points out that he took special precautions to make sure no one saw him. Bill objects, insisting that he stood up for his own name. Jabe objects, saying that Blaine is attacking Bill rather than the evidence. Blaine has Bill walk through how he entered the house.

-----

Bill comes into Sloan's office at his home. Sloan offers him a drink and offers a toast to Bill and Lucy. He insists on Bill having a second drink, then takes the money out of his safe. Sloan counts out the $3,000 and hands it over. As Bill leaves, Sloan draws a gun and tosses out the contents of the safe, and says that it will look like Bill came with a few drinks and tried to rob him. The businessman tells Bill that he's not good enough for Lucy and she's going to marry him. He figures that Lucy won't mourn a thief for long. Bill goes for his gun and manages to kill Sloan. Bill then runs out the front, and that's when the guards found him.

-----

Blaine points out that Bill had bad words with Sloan, and notes out that Bill didn't suspect anything even though Sloan had a reputation as a hard-dealing businessman. Bill admits that he needed the money and was willing to convince himself that Sloan had changed his ways. Blaine asks where the extra $3,000 came from, and Bill admits that he doesn't know.

When she's on the stand, Lucy says that some townspeople have visited her at the schoolhouse where she teaches. Blaine asks how she knew Sloan loved her, and Lucy says that a woman can tell. The prosecutor then presents his summation, saying that Jabe presented his own imaginings and Lucy lied on behalf of her fiancée. He notes that no one has any proof of Sloan loving Lucy, but Bill hated Sloan and wanted to make a home for Lucy.

The jury convenes and everyone votes guilty except for Bret. One of the players, Pike, objects and says that they should have another vote. Bret offers to bet $500 that they leave the room with a verdict for acquittal. Pike hesitates and then makes sure of the terms of the bet, including his vote for innocence. He agrees and Bret points out that Sloan practically forced Bill to draw on him by accusing his father of being a thief. The other jurors agree with Bret despite Pike's arguments, and Bret says that there's enough doubt for it to be reasonable doubt.

The jurors vote again and this time three more jurors vote not guilty. One juror points out that Sloan cheated Pike at cards in the past. Pike figures it was between him and Sloan, but Bret notes that a man who cheats once would cheat again. When Pike insists that he will never vote not guilty, the foreman Price says that they're all listening to reason except Pike. Pike points out the extra $3,000, and Bret says it's a strong point. He notes that people are careful not to get short-changed, but not so much when they're getting paid more. Bret demonstrates by noting that he paid Pike $500 on the bet and had him hold the stakes... and slipped in an extra $500 there.

The sheriff comes in and says that they need to make a decision or they'll stay at the vote. This time there are 11 for acquittal, and Pike says that his vote will remain not guilty. The jurors argue with Pike, and Bret says that they're deadlocked. He asks why Pike votes for hanging, pointing out that there's no such thing as a pat hand. Bret gives Pike a straight hand and has him shuffle them and cut them twice, without ever touching them himself. He then has Pike deal out five hands face down, and then proposes a bet that there are five pat hands among the 25 cards. Pike doesn't believe it's possible, and Bret bets $500 and Bill's life that there aren't. If Bret loses, he'll stop fighting Pike and vote guilty. If Pike loses, he'll vote not guilty.

Pike figures that there's a trick and confirms the terms of the bet. He asks for another shuffle and Bret agrees. Once Pike deals the cards, Bret picks out five pat hands. He admits that five pat hands can be made out of any 25 cards, calling it ""Maverick Solitaire"".

The jury returns a verdict of not guilty, and Price admits to Bret that he never thought they'd reach a verdict. Pike never did vote ""not guilty"", but Bret figured that he kept their bargain. Price, the foreman, gets up and says they found Bill not guilty. Blaine demands a poll of the jury, and each juror says ""not guilty""... including Pike.

Afterward, Pike pays the $500, talks to Bret, and says that he made him look foolish. Bret tells him that he was betting that Pike was a pretty good man and invites him to go back to playing poker with him."

Martinson'],[''],[],"['cowboy', 'pistol', 'showdown', 'street shootout', 'gunfight', 'shootout', 'barricade', '1870s']",[],"Bret is play poker in Kiowa City, a cowtown in Kansas. The trail hands often ride through town, shooting up the place when they think they're being cheated. Bret continues playing and winning, and a losing cowhand accuses Bret of cheating. He says that Bret deals crooked and threatens to kill him and Marshal Walt Hardie pistol-whips the cowhand unconscious from behind. Bret thanks Hardie for his intervention and goes to bed, and Walt gets some men to carry the unconscious cowhand away.

The next morning, Bret emerges from the hotel and notices that everything is too quiet. A businessman, Somers, advises Bret to stay off the streets. He explains that Hardie is going to have a shootout with Jack Wade, the boss that the cowhand worked for. The cowhand died earlier that morning, and Hardie is holed up in jail. Somers figures that Wade is having breakfast, and tells Bret that it won't be a fair draw.

Bret goes to the jail one of the trail hands standing guard tells him not to stay long. Walt confirms that Bret is who he says and lets him in, and tells Bret that his getting involved wouldn't help. Bret advises him to get out, but Walt says that the town is paying him to make sure the trail hands hoorah the town and he can't run. He advises Bret to get out before the shooting starts, but Bret considers himself responsible. Walt tells him to get out anyway, and Bret gives him a shotgun and says that Wade might decide to parley instead of shoot. He advises Walt to keep an eye on Wade's ramrod Red Scanlon and leaves.

Bret leaves and print shop owner George Buckner comes down the street. The gambler says that Walt and Wade are going to shoot it off, and George wonders who is going to stop it. George doesn't want to get involved and Bret tells him to go back to his shop. Further down the street, Red stops Bret and asks if he's getting involved. Bret says that he's not, and Red tells him to spread the word there won't be any more fuss in Kiowa once it's over... as long as no one gets involved. Bret asks if it will be a fair fight, and Red points out that Walt hit the cowhand from behind. The gambler asks where Wade is, and Red advises him to leave Wade alone. Bret points out that he's unarmed and leaves.

When he goes into the café where Wade is having lunch, Bret finds Wade eating breakfast with Lil. Bret says that he wants to make a deal and Wade assures him that Walt is dead. The gambler suggests that Wade let Walt ride out of town, and points out that the cowhand's death was an accident. Lil agrees with Bret, but Wade says that Walt should have gotten out when he had the chance. Bret points out that Walt is afraid that Wade and his men will tree the town. Red comes in and says that if Jack lets Walt go then the trail hands will quit. He doesn't aim to end his 10% cut, and says that if Wade's father was alive then he would have cleaned out the town by now. Wade tells Bret to go because there's no deal, and Bret says that it must gravel him taking orders from Red. Red challenges Bret to fight, and Bret points out that he's unarmed and leaves.

Bret goes to the salon where Somers and the others have gathered. The bartender, Gus Wilson, figures that once Walt is dead the cowhands will bust up the town, starting with his saloon. Bret says that Wade's bunch won't pull out but Red won't let him, and nobody is planning to stop Red.

At the print shop, George tries to convince his printer Charlie that someone needs to stand up to the trail hands. Charlie warns him that Kiowa isn't like Ohio where George came from, and nobody will stand up to the trail hands. Walt's wife Amy walks down the street, and Walt and Somers come out and watch her walk past the trail hands on watch. She goes to the cafe, and Wade, Red, and Lil come out. Amy begs Wade to sit down with Walt and talk, insisting that Walt didn't mean to kill the cowhand. She begs Wade not to hurt her husband, and Wade tells Lil to take Amy away. He glances at Red for a moment, then walks to the jail. Crying, Amy tells him that he doesn't want to live with murdering Walt.

Wade and Red arrive at the jail and Wade calls Walt out. Bret, watching, reaches for the derringer in his pocket. Wade says that Walt killed one of his boys, and Red guns Walt down. The ramrod says that they should get a drink and they go into the saloon. Bret comes over and asks if Wade always has someone killing for him. He asks why Wade didn't give Walt a chance, and Wade insists that Walt didn't give the cowhand a chance. Once Wade goes inside, Red asks Bret if he's buying in. Bret says that Red will know if he does because he won't turn his back on him.

Bret goes over to the others who have gathered around Walt's body. George insists that it was murder and asks what they're going to do about it. Bret says that if anyone tries to do anything then they'll be killed. George asks the crowd if they can stand by while the marshal is murdered, and Somers tells him to simmer down. Disgusted, George says that he'll label Wade a coward throughout the state. Bret warns George that if he does he's as good as dead, and helps Somers take the body away.

George goes to his print shop and dictates his story to Charlie about Walt's story. Charlie warns that George is buying a lot of grief, and George says that he'll handle it as it comes.

At the camp outside of town, Red tells Wade that they should lay the herd over another day. Wade orders that there'll be no more trouble in Kiowa and they're leaving. Red says that they can't leave until Harry, the man he sent into town for flour, gets back.

In town, Harry gets a broadside from a delivery boy and once he reads it, quickly rides off. The delivery boy then goes into the saloon and hands out the same broadside with George's story. Bret tells Somers that he's going to ride out before Wade and his men ride into Kiwoa City.

Harry gives them Wade and Red the broadside, describing how Walt was killed. George describes them as ""assassins"", and Red says that Wade's father would have torn up in town. Wade tells him to leave his father out of it and orders his men to ride into town.

Somers and the other businessman go to the print shop and tells George that Wade and his men will destroy the town. George figures that maybe the townspeople will defend themselves if they didn't defend Walt. He says that they're cowards and leaves for Topeka. Charlie says that George is going to roust the governor against Wade.

Bret is preparing to leave town when Red and his men ride into town. They see Bret and ride over, and Red tells him that no one rides out or they'll meet with an accident. He tells Bret that he just doesn't like him, and points out that Bret is wearing his gun, and Bret says that he's wearing it in case he comes across a snake and then goes inside.

At the saloon, Gus pours drinks on the house for Wade and his trail hands. Wade asks him who wrote the broadside, and Gus says that it's none of his business. The boss demands an answer and Gus swears that he doesn't know. Wade takes offense at the liquor and throws a bottle into Gus' mirror. Gus quickly says that George wrote the broadside and he's going to Topeka on the night coach. Wade tells his men to bust up the place anyway.

Wade and Red go to the print shop Red beats Charlie for where George is. George is in the back and hears them beating Charlie, and considers going in. Wade says that Charlie is dead, and leaves with red. George goes in and stares at Charlie's body in shock. Bret comes in and George tells him what happened. He admits that he was afraid to come in until Wade left. Disgusted, Bret says that a man who shouts and then runs when someone responds makes him sick. He considers turning George over to Wade before George gets anyone killed. George points out that they both let their friends killed, and says that Bret can't condemn George without condemning himself.

Out in the street, Wade asks Bret where George is. Bret refuses to talk, and tells Red that Red isn't good enough to hit him at that range and if he moves any closer, Bret will kill him. Red wants to go up against him anyway, but Wade orders him to stand down. Bret insists that he doesn't side with anyone and just wants to be left alone. Wade tells him to spread the world around that if George gets out Kiowa he'll tree the town. If he doesn't have George by that night, he's taking the town.

Bret goes to the saloon and Gus tells him what happened. Gus says that he's done being scared by people like Wade and Red, and asks if Bret is afraid of them. Bret figures that he is, and says that his business is staying alive. Somers comes in and says that they can't find George, and admits that they're going to turn him over to Wade or the whole town goes. Gus says that George had no right to what he said and then runs, and Bret asks if they're going to stop the trail hands if they ride in. The two men remain silent, and Bret says that all towns die sooner or later and Kiowa isn't worth dying for.

Red tells Wade that there's no sign of George and figures he hasn't left town. He asks if the townspeople will fight, and Wade says that he's short-handed. Red doesn't care, and Wade tells him that they'll turn the men loose if they don't get George by that night.

Bret finds George in his room, and tells him to get out and make sure no one sees him. George says that there wasn't any place else to go, and Bret tells him that he can leave after dark. Bret blames him for not having the backbone to take the consequences of his talk, and says that Wade will kill George. George thought the townspeople would stand behind him, and Bret tells him that he's going to make a deal. The publisher asks if Wade would forget the whole thing if he puts out another broadside retracting what he said earlier. Bret doesn't think much it will work but agrees to tell Wade.

Bret and Somers approach Wade and his men, who are waiting outside of town. They ask what Wade plans to do to George, and Somers says that he wants to see things settled without bloodshed. Wade points out that his boys won't think much of him if he turns the other cheek, and advises Somers to hand over George. Bret describes George's offer, but Wade isn't interested. Red says that they want to hear it from Wade, and Bret asks Wade what he says. Wade refuses and they walk off. The ramrod hopes that they won't hand George over because he'd like taking Kiowa apart.

George goes to Lil's house and she reluctantly lets him in. She says that he should go out and take what's coming to him, and figures that he's not much of a man. George explains the deal and Lil wonders if he'll stay there afterward. She warns that Wade will either get George or tree the house, and describes what the trail hands will do the town. With Walt dead there's no one to stop them, and asks why George isn't brave now. George says that he never thought of himself as a coward, but he couldn't force himself to open the door when he heard Charlie get beaten.

Lil goes to the saloon and asks if Wade took the deal. Bret told him that Wade refuses, and Lil asks what the ""brave men"" will do now. They ask if she's hiding George, and Lil says that George came to her and she didn't throw him out. She asks if there's any man in town who will fight, and Bret says that he only uses a gun when he has to. He says that she pushed him off the fence by coming in and hiding George, and asks if anyone else will go with him. The townspeople agree to fight back, and they discuss putting up a barricade to slow the trail hands down.

Bret and the townspeople wait in the shadows, and Wade and his men ride into Kiowa. George gets a rifle and steps out, and sees the townspeople gathered to defend him. The trail hands walk down the street, and George steps out. Bret joins him and the two men face off against Wade and Red. Bret says that they'll have to take him and all of the men behind him. When Wade and Red go for their guns, the townspeople shoot them down and continue firing at the trail hands.

The two sides exchange shots, and then Bret yells that if they leave now there won't be any more shooting. After a minute, the surviving trail hands get the two corpses and leave. Back in the saloon, Bret pulls up a chair and starts dealing cards."

Bret and Bart are Johnny Rebs after the Civil War, and join the Union Army as Indian hunters to avoid going to prison. The brothers arrive in their hometown of Little Bend with big plans. Union soldiers control the town, and the Mavericks go into the saloon. The owner, Jessie, recognizes them and the brothers show him the paper for $1,650 that Jessie's father owed them. He pays them up... in Confederate money. They point out that they deposited Confederate gold, and Jessie points out that there's no mention of the note. They say that Jessie Sr. wrote it down in their ledger and ask to look at the books. Three of the customers come over and attack the Mavericks, and Jessie runs in the back.

Bart and Bret defeat the men, and Jessie comes back out and says that he sent for the Union army lieutenant. He points out that they no longer have the receipt, and Laura Miller speaks up and says that she saw the whole thing and can testify that the Mavericks had a receipt.

When the Army lieutenant arrives, Jessie pays off the Mavericks and asks if they'd like to sell their spread for twice the $1,650. Once he goes, Bret thanks the Army lieutenant for his help. They realize that Laura has left, and the lieutenant says that Laura came there four years ago with her father. The Mavericks are both smitten with Laura, and notice that she left a note saying to be there at her place at 8 that night.

At their hotel room, Bret and Bart cut cards to see who will visit Laura. Bret wins, gets a shave, and goes out to the Miller ranch bearing flowers. Bart is there and waves to Bret, and when Laura goes to put the flowers in water. Bart reveals that he knows Bret crimped the cards to win the cut. Laura returns and says that she wants to hire both of them as trail bosses on a cattle drive.

The Mavericks quickly excuse themselves, and Laura says that Jessie is out to grab all of West Texas and she saw a map of the properties at his house. She explains that she saw the map the night she went to kill him, and that Jessie murdered her father but nobody saw it happen. A week after her father died, she went to Jessie's place with a gun. Laura saw the map, which showed that Jessie was buying up five thousand square miles. Both their spreads were on it, but Jessie had it all labeled his spread. Jessie came back but she didn't have the courage to shoot Jessie in the back. She begs the Mavericks to help her because she needs money to buy the land before Jessie does. She can settle the cattle for $80,000 at Fort Adobe near Arizona Territory. Bret points out that there are 500 miles of Comanche between them, and offers them $8,000 to take the job. Laura admits that everyone says that it can't be done, but figures that they need each other or Jessie wins. Bret explains that they want to work and fight for themselves after five years, and Bart agrees. She warns that there isn't time and they have to get there first, but the Mavericks insist that they have to think about it.

The Mavericks ride out to their spread and two men bushwhack them.

Later at Laura's ranch, the two bushwhackers--Jim Hazlit and Miguel--give Laura the Maverick's money. Once Miguel leaves, Jim tells her that now she can keep the money. Laura tells Jim that she's trying to make the Mavericks fight their own fights. Jim grabs her and kisses her. When she draws back, Jim tells her that there's nothing left in her but revenge. He wants his woman back and Laura tells him that he'll have to wait. As Jim goes, Laura asks him if he's walking out on her and Jim says that he wishes he had the guts to.

-----

The Mavericks explain that they didn't know it was Laura at the time, but they confronted Jessie and he said he knew nothing about it. They had no choice but to work for Laura.

-----

Bret and Bart recruit hands from the Johnny Rebs in Little Bend, warning that it won't be easy. Jett and his two men ride up and Jett says that the Mavericks are ""Galvanized Yankees"". Bart asks which Confederate outfit Jett fought with, and Bret says that Jett didn't have an outfit. They admit that they joined the Union to stay out of a prison, and they fought Indians. Jett isn't impressed and the Rebs disagree on whether to work for the ""turncoats"" or not. Most of them agree to hire on, and tell Jett that if he tries to run the Mavericks out they'll shoot.

Bret yanks Jett off of his horse and tells that he can either shoot, fight, or turn tail. When Jett says that they have guns backing them, Bret tells Bart to shoot anyone who interferes. The Rebs agree to work for the Mavericks and Bart tells them to be ready the next day.

That night, Jett and his men ambush the Mavericks when they leave their hotel. The brothers take cover and return fire, and a tall man passing by helps them. Bart kills Jett's men, and the sheriff comes over and asks what happened. The tall man has slipped away and there's no witness to back up the Mavericks' story.

The next day at Laura's ranch, Laura tells the Mavericks that Jessie is claiming the Mavericks murdered the men, and the lieutenant is on his way to arrest them. Bret and Bart ride out and will join up with the drive later. They ride back into Little Bend and try to find the tall man, and learn that he left on a wagon train heading north west. They flip a coin and Bart provides the coin. Bret wins the toss, and Bret says that he'll tag along behind the drive in case the lieutenant and his men ride with the drive.

The drive heads to Fort Adobe and the lieutenant and his man stay with it. Bret follows the Army men, and after six days they head back to Little Bend. When Bret joins the drive, he tells Laura that Bart will join them later. Jim curries his horse and secretly glares at Bret.

Bart rides eight days northwest to find the wagon train. He finds Indians attacking the wagons, and once they leave he checks the wreckage and discovers the tall man isn't among the dead. A few wagons got away and Bart figures the tall man is with them.

The drive makes camp for the night, and Bret sees Miguel polishing his boots... that he saw on one of the bushwhackers. When he grabs Miguel and demands the money, Laura comes out and tells Bret to leave Miguel alone. She says that Miguel robbed Bret to force the Mavericks to work for her. Jim intervenes and when Bret figures he was the other bushwhacker, punches him unconscious. Laura reluctantly gives him the money but refuses to apology. Bret says that he'll stay anyway for 25% of the take. Laura finally gives in and tells Jim that Bret had a right to do and they have work to do. Bart rides into camp and tells him that Jessie is driving 2,000 head to Fort Adobe.

-----

The cabin floods, and Bart tells him that he found one of the wagon train survivors told him that the tall man was heading to Fort Adobe.

-----

The Mavericks push the drive to get to Fort Adobe before Jessie. Two days out from Ford Adobe, the drive takes their first real break. Jessie approaches the camp and asks to talk to Bret about the two murdered men. Bret agrees and Jessie warns him that he's not alone. He doesn't want to lose the race but is because of Bret. Jessie explains that he filled out a disposition before he left. Bret refuses to deal, and Jessie insists that he can beat the Northern carpetbaggers while Bret and Laura can't. He offers Bret twice the 25% they're making from the drive but Bart still refuses. Bret figures that Jessie will try to stop them by stampeding the herd.

Bart rounds up some volunteers to check for Jessie's men. They spot Jessie and a dozen of his men heading their way, and Jessie and his men follow them as they ride away from the herd. Once they lead Jessie far enough away, Bret and his men leave their horses and take to the rocks. The other side does the same and the two sides open fire. Jim covers Bret as he tries to get above them. Jessie spots him and opens fire, and Jim shoots him and calls to Bret that Jessie is down. Bret has his men hold their fire and lets Jessie's men get out because they have nothing left to fight for. The men finally leave, and Jim discovers that Jessie is still alive but pretty bad. Jessie asks Bret to take him to a doctor. When Bret wonders why he should, Jessie promises to tell the truth about the killing.

Two days later the drive arrives at Ford Adobe. Jessie has held on but the infirmary doctor tells Bret that he can't save Jessie. Bret insists on talking to Jessie and having the doctor there to hear Jessie's testimony. Jessie tells Bret to hang and dies.

Later, Bret pays off the Rebs and Laura says that no one will press murder charges against Bret. He doesn't feel like taking a chance, and hopes that Bart will have found the tall man. Jim offers to help, but Bret figures that he should stick around and look after Laura. The two men shake hands and Jim leaves, and Laura impulsively kisses Bret before she leaves with the others.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0644520/?ref_=ttep_ep23,,"To clear their names, Bret and Samantha Crawford go after two gunmen who stole money from a high-stakes poker game they were involved with.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Richard L. Bare'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"At a hotel in Kansas City, a messenger tells Logan that Bret on his way down. Logan quickly leaves hides, and Bret comes down Samantha Crawford approaches Bret and greets him, and Bret says that he's considering cutting his stay short now that he knows she's there. Sam ignores him and asks him to take her out to dinner, claiming that she likes him. Bret agrees to dinner at 7 that night and Sam leaves.

That night at dinner, Bret says that he knows Sam didn't run into him by ""accident"". She admits that she's been looking for him and shows him $20,000 in her purse. Sam gives him a list of names and Bret recognizes them as high-stakes poker players. She explains that she's staking Bret to play in a poker game against them. Bret asks where she got the $20,000, and Sam finally says that she came by it honesty. She offers Bret a 50/50 share and tells him that he's going to claim that he's the world's greatest poker player and they'll come to prove him wrong. Bret reluctantly agrees, figuring that she's the only one who can lose. Sam says that she sent the telegrams inviting the men before dinner.

Later, Sam lays out the poker table in the motel room. Logan arrives and asks if everything is going to be all right, and Sam assures him that it will. She warns that he could ruin everything, and asks if Logan wants to back out. Logan assures her that he doesn't and tells her that he's going to be watching her. Bret comes in a minute later and asks her if she'd told him everything. Sam claims that she has and gives him the $20,000. He warns her that they're all equally skilled which means it's a game of luck, and that they could be broke in an hour.

Two men, Pritchard and Welles, come into the hotel. They see Logan and he sees them, and they come over and introduce themselves. They sit down and ask if it's ready. Logan says that it has to be done a little later, and tells them that he's got somebody else watching them. Pritchard agrees and Logan tells them that it should be starting anytime now.

In the hotel room, Bret plays against the other men while Sam serves drinks and counts the money. Pritchard and Wells put on masks and kick in the door, guns drawn. They take the players' wallets and then grab the poker money that Sam is holding. Bret glares suspiciously at Sam, and the two men leave. One player, Tabor asks Bret if they're friends of him. Bret grabs his gun and goes out in the hall, but the robbers are gone. When he returns, the other players accuse him of arranging the whole thing. The players say that they don't want word to get out, but tell Bret to stay out of their territories and warn he'll have a hard time finding a game.

Once the players leave, Bret asks Sam who else knew about the game. Sam denies it and says that Logan gave her the money and had her set up the game because he knew Bret wouldn't take it from him. She gives Bret Logan's room and they head there. Bret draws his gun and goes in, but there's no sign of Logan. He tells Sam to take him to Logan, and Sam says that she has no idea where he is. She explains that Logan offered her 10% of the profit, and gives Bret a description. Sam swears she knew nothing about the holdup, and figures that it was Logan's idea. Bret figures that Logan will probably take the train, locks Sam in the room, and leaves. Once she's alone, Sam smiles.

Bret confirms with the clerk that Logan checked out 20 minutes ago and there's a train leaving as they talk. Going back to Logan's room, Bret discovers the door open and the lock picked. There's an envelope from Sam with a hairpin inside.

The next morning, Logan, Pritchard, and Wells get off the train at the next stop. Bret arrives a few minutes later and boards the train, and asks the conductor if he's seen Sam. The train stops to stock up on wood, and Bret spots Sam boarding covertly boarding the train. Bret huddles down so she doesn't see him, and she takes a seat next to him. He greets her and figures that she took the train because she wouldn't do the obvious. Bret realized that she would look for Logan, and Sam admits that he's right. Bret says that Logan, Pritchard, and Wells took a train west, and points out that Sam could be joining Logan for her cut. He insists on keeping Sam with him, even though the train is moving.

The train continues to Logan's home in Wyoming, and Bret and Sam get off at the station. They go to the saloon and Bret sits Sam down at a table while he asks questions. The bartender directs him over to Anita, and he invites her to join them. She reluctantly does so despite Sam's presence, and Bret claims that Sam is his sister. Bret questions Anita about Logan, who worked there, and says that he was engaged to Sam and left her waiting at a church. Sam reluctantly plays along, and Anita admits that Logan did the same thing to her that he did to Sam. Logan borrowed money from her, and then left and said he was coming back with more. He had $20,000 and lived in a room out bank so he wouldn't have to pay rent, and pinched pennies to save the $20,000. Logan came back two days ago and told Anita that he didn't have any money. He said he had $100,000 and he was going after the two men who stole it from him. Sam claims that Logan is the only man she'll ever love, and Anita tells them that he went to Deadwood and then coming back for her.

Outside, Sam tells Bret that she's through. Bret insists that they're going after Logan together. He admits that he's starting to believe her story, and Sam admits that she's wondered what it would be like being married to Bret. The couple take a stage to Deadwood.

Logan rides into Deadwood before them and asks the hotel clerk if he's seen Pritchard and Wells. The clerk says that they're not there and shows him the ledger, and Logan gives him a description of the men. When the clerk identifies them and tells Logan what room they're in, Logan takes a room next to them. Once Logan goes upstairs, the clerk quickly leaves.

Logan breaks into the robbers' room, gun drawn, and finds a man he's never seen. The man, Sloan, asks what he wants, and Logan says that he's looking for a couple of friends. The clerk arrives with the sheriff, who takes Logan's question and explains that one of them is dead. Logan insists that he didn't kill anyone and the sheriff explains that Pritchard killed Wells. He tells Logan to get out of town in an hour, and Logan confirms that Pritchard is still loose but headed into Sioux territory. The sheriff figures the Sioux will save the town the price of a hanging.

Logan sits down and Sloan asks if he wants to catch Pritchard. Sloan says that he knows the territory and demands $500. When Logan tries to dicker, Sloan asks for $1,000 and Logan agrees.

Later, the clerk tells Bret and Sam where Logan and Sloan were heading. They ride out on the trail after the two men, and catch up to them at their camp. Bret trains his gun on them and says that they're going to have to trust each other, and holds his coffee and pours some coffee.

The next day, the quartet rides after Pritchard. They come to a Sioux camp and Bret confirms that the Indians have captured Pritchard and have him in one of the teepees. Logan wants to get Pritchard, but Bret says that they should wait until nightfall. Bret settles down to get some sleep, and Sam comes over and asks him if he really saw Pritchard. He assures her that he wouldn't try to outsmart her, and smiles at her once she dozes off.

That night, Logan slips into the camp first, and then Sloan. Sam suggests to Bret that they call it off, but Bret figures she isn't afraid of anything and goes down with the others. They cut their way into the teepee where Pritchard is prisoner, and Logan accuses Pritchard of double-crossing him. Bret puts Logan on guard duty and asks Pritchard where the money is. Pritchard claims that he lost it, but Logan doesn't believe him. Bret warns Pritchard that they'll leave him if he doesn't tell them where the money is. An Indian comes in and Bret knocks him out, and then tells Pritchard that the rest will come. Pritchard says that he buried the money and will take them to it, and Bret cuts him free.

As they go, Bret gets an idea and cuts his way out to the side. He comes up behind Logan and draws his gun on the man, who is preparing to pistol-whip him. Bret tells them to head back.

Later, Bret is playing poker with the five businessmen again while Sam serves drinks. The businessmen apologize to Bret for their suspicions and glances over at Logan, who is watching them. Sam glances at Bret's hand and smiles."

The man at the gate asks who he is, and Bret says that he's Homer Eakins. The guard lets him past, and Bret rides to the ranch house. Bret knocks at the door and the guard lets him in and says that the others are waiting for him.

The butler, Luther, greets Bret at the door. Bret goes into the parlor and introduces himself under his assumed name. His ""cousins"" Abbie Welkins and Lonnie Doyle introduce themselves, and Lonnie introduces Bret to the others: Elizabeth Seabright and her husband Elmo; Millard Sawyer; Hope Martin her brother Jeff, Seeby Dixon, and Pliney Potter. Bret takes a seat and General Jake Eakins comes in. He's not impressed with any of them and asks who Bret is, and Bret says that he's Homer. The General says that he doesn't believe him, and Bret claims that the older man hasn't seen him since he was 10.

Mrs. Knowles brings the General his whiskey, and the General tells them that they're all guests whether they like it or not. He explains that there's a lava bed and the Indians call it ""Black Fire"", thus its name. The General says that he has to decide who will get all of his money, and says that he's going to take two weeks to assign heirs. He informs them that any that aren't interested can leave, and nobody goes. Bret claims that he's been looking after a sick friend and asks if he can bring him, and the General agrees. The gambler says that his ""friend"" is Bret Maverick, and the General tells them that breakfast is the next morning at 7:30.

Back in town, the real Homer is in town painting. Bret arrives and Homer asks how it went. He says that he wants his uncle to die happy knowing that his money is in good hands. Bret tells him that all of the relatives have to spend two weeks at Black Fire. He wants out of the deal, and Homer reminds Bret that he owes him a favor. Bret points out that Homer will need food and shelter and got permission to bring ""Bret"" along. Homer figures that he'd fight with the General and be cut off, but Bret refuses to play along if Homer doesn't and Homer gives in.

At the ranch, Jeff guard reminds the General that they have to live with the farmers who are moving in. The General tells him to run them off and cut their fences. Bret and Homer arrive and Jeff leaves. The older man says that Homer is what he thought ""Homer"" would grow up to be. The General is disgusted that ""Homer"" is a painter, and Homer says that he's a professional poker player and he's never done an honest day's work. Homer admires a stuffed head of a moose and insults the General over it.

That night at dinner, Millard talks about his job as a banker. Elizabeth complains that the General drinks too much but the General isn't impressed. She's a suffragette and against drinking, and the General ask Piney what he thinks of women voting. Piney fakes a coughing fit, and Bret says that women will vote if they put their minds to it. When the General talks about farmers, Jeff says that the country is filling out. Lonnie is glad to boot the farmers out if he was running the place. The General is impressed, and Jeff excuses himself. Hope angrily tells the General that they're all disgusting, hovering around the General hoping to get his money. She tells them that Black Fire belongs to Jeff because he's the one who has been running the place while the General starts trouble. She storms out in a fury.

Later, Bret plays the General in cards and then goes out to get some fresh airs. Homer says that he never plays for fun and tells the General that he can't afford to play for money. Bret smokes and hears Elizabeth and Lonnie arguing. Luther tells Bret that he's only been around for three months, and in three months he'll be somewhere else.

That night, a man slips out of his room and enters another room.

The next morning, the General comes down for breakfast and notices that Lonnie is missing. He doesn't want to hold breakfast for him, and tells Luther to get Lonnie. Luther says that Lonnie isn't in his room and the bed wasn't slept in. The butler informs them that Lonnie took his clothes with him, and the General congratulates Hope on getting rid of one person.

Later, Bret plays horseshoes against the General. Much to Homer's disgust, Bret impresses the General. Homer wonders why Lonnie left, and the General dismisses it as Hope's nagging.

That night at dinner, everyone notices that Pliney is gone. Jeff goes up to Pliney's room to check on him, and Bret goes with him. Pliney is gone along with his clothes, and Bret searches the drawers as the others arrive. He finds Pliney's wallet and figures that someone else did his packing for him.

Everyone gathers in the parlor, and Home points out that Pliney wouldn't have left without his money. The General concedes the point and figures that someone is killing off the competition. He tells them that anyone who wants to go can go without prejudice, and he'd rather they did. Elizabeth and Millard agree to stay, but Elmo insists on going, and the General says that he has guts and brains. Abbie says that she's used to being poor, but everyone else stays. The General advises them all to bolt their doors and leaves.

Later in his room, Bret confirms that the door is solid. Mrs. Knowles comes by and Bret confirms with her that all of the doors have bolts on the inside. She says that she thinks she will be an heir and leaves. Bret goes to check Pliney's room, and Millard asks him if he found what he's looking for.

In the dead of night, Bret checks the doors figuring the killer wouldn't bolt his doors. As he checks Millard's door, Millard attacks him. The two men fight until the General intervenes and tells Jeff to get the sheriff. Bret says that he's been trying people's door and explains that anyone not in their room was the killer. The General says that Millard figured the same thing. Homer comes up and the General tells Bret that he never thought he'd turn out bad. Millard tells Homer to stay out of a family matter, and the General has Jeff lock Bret up in the store room. Homer says that Bret isn't ""Homer"" and explains that he's the real Homer. The General is shocked to realize that Homer is Homer, and immediately defends Bret. He tells everyone to go to bed except Bret and Homer. The General says that he was starting to like Homer until he learned he was a relative, and admits that he has guts taking the blame for Bret. Homer is impressed with himself and leaves. Once they're alone, the General goes to his study with Bret so they can talk.

Millard is in his room undressing and the killer steps out from behind the drapes. Shocked, Millard sees him and the killer throws a knife into his stomach.

In the study, the General drinks and asks Bret to stay there. He figures that Bret is the only one he can trust because he isn't a relative. The General says that Mrs. Knowles knows she'll get $20,000 if she stays, and Luther is an idiot. Bret doesn't want to see the relatives die, and the General doesn't plan to leave his money to a killer. He wants Bret to find the killer and stop him before he kills again, and figures that the killer is a man. Bret points out that Elizabeth is more than capable and wishes the General luck. The General offers him $2,000 to find the killer and Bret accepts. They go the bunkhouse to find some men to act as guards, and the General figures that Jeff is the killer. He admits that he never did right by Jeff and Hope, and that Jeff has made the ranch his family. The General figures that Jeff has been festering inside at the thought of losing Black Fire. Bret bets him the $2,000 that it's not Jeff and the General happily agrees.

Mrs. Knowles tells Luther that she's going to leave if someone else dies, and Luther points out that she won't get any money. The maid goes into the dining room and finds Millard seated in a chair, dead. The relatives gather and meet with the sheriff, who doesn't know who the killer is. The General blames himself and orders them all to go because he knows who he's going to give his money to. The sheriff says that they can't leave because they're all suspects. Jeff comes back and says that they found the other two bodies up at the lava bed.

Bret and the General talk, and Bret figures that Millard wouldn't have let anyone in. He figures the killer was in the room when Millard came in, and reminds the General that they weren't all in the hall when they saw Millard go into his room.

In the study, Homer plays solitaire while Seeby complains that he should have gone. Hope says that it's not good for them to gather and complain, and Homer sarcastically talks about how he's been reunited with his kin. He tells Hope that everything bothers him, and Elizabeth suggests that he has a good reason not to be worried. Homer goes out to ""bribe the guards"", and Bret notices Luther walking around. He searches for clues and goes to Millard's room first. Bret finally locates a photo of a man looking like Luther, standing behind a woman wearing a broach. He pockets the photo and leaves.

That night at dinner, Bret says that they should enjoy their dinner rather than wondering which of them is the killer. He tells them that he knows who the killer is, and explains that there's more than enough money to go around. Bret figures someone wants to make sure Black Fire goes to the ""right"" person. He tells them that none of them are the killer, and notices that Hope is wearing a broach. Bret says that her father is the killer, and the General notes that George Martin hasn't been seen for 22 years.

Bret tells them to forget it, but the General tells him to keep talking. The gambler says that all he has is a theory and says the name ""Martin"". Luther, who is gathering the dishes, drops them in surprise. Luther draws his gun and shoots at Bret, who ducks. The killer runs out the window and the guards kill him.

Later, Bret shows the General the photo and figures that the woman wearing the broach is Hope and Jeff's mother: Luther's wife. The General figures that he's to blame because he didn't leave Black Fire to Jeff, and all he ever planned to do was leave the rest of them money. He gives them all half of his money except for Jeff, who will get Black Fire. The General will use the other half of the money to go out and get drunk.

The General pays off Bret and then asks if Homer is going to go. Homer is planning to go to Paris to pursue his painting, and the General suggests that they both go there and do it up in style. When the General says that he can't behave himself, Homer agrees. Bret is heading to Denver for a poker game, and the sheriff arrives. He wonders what happened, and Bret says that the butler did it."

Peter Benjamin Parker is surprised when Harold Theopolis ""Harry"" Osborn, the son of Oscorp Industries founder Professor Norman Virgil Osborn and the friend of the school bully Eugene ""Flash"" Thompson, offers Peter to be his new roommate at an apartment near Central Park. Peter decides to think about it, while taking photos for the Daily Bugle at the announcement of the new Fisk School of Criminology by Wilson Fisk and Norman Osborn. Suddenly, Peter sees a cloaked yellow and orange goblin-like figure flying down towards Fisk on a bat-shaped jet glider. He pulls out a laser gun and attempts to shoot and kill Fisk, but Peter saves Fisk right before it can hit him. As panic begins in the crowd and police arrive, Peter changes himself into his Spider-Man costume and swings into an air-battle with the mysterious flying masked assassin figure in the air heights of the New York City sky. The battle eventually ends when Spider-Man nearly collides with a plane and narrowly survives a large fall from a building, but hears the strange flying criminal maniac give his name as the ""Hobgoblin"".

As Norman Osborn returns to his home laboratory at Oscorp Industries, he is confronted by the Hobgoblin whom he starts an argument with, revealing that Norman hired Hobgoblin to assassinate Fisk by giving him a costume and weapons and that Norman knows his real secret identity. Norman tells Hobgoblin that he failed his mission and threatens to fire him, but Hobgoblin argues he would have succeeded without Spider-Man stopping him.

At home, Peter discusses with his Aunt May about whether moving out and room-mating with Harry is a good idea. Aunt May tells him that all young people need to move out one day, and also tells him that his girlfriend Mariam ""Mary"" Jane Watson is moving out with some of her friends and her Aunt Anna Watson will be moving into Aunt May's place, thus encouraging Peter. so Peter takes her advice and moves in with Harry at the apartment in Central Park.

that night, Hobgoblin sneaks into the Empire State Building and finds the secret lair of Wilson Fisk (revealed to be the powerful crime lord Kingpin) and his sidekick Allistair Smythe. Hobgoblin tells Fisk that he wants money and revenge on Norman Osborn, prompting Fisk to hire Hobgoblin for a job and orders him to kidnap Harry to get Osborn payback. Hobgoblin breaks into Peters and Harry's apartment and sets off explosives, kidnapping Harry and knocking Aunt May (who was visiting Peter) unconscious, whilst even managing to payback Peter. Fisk tells what Hobgoblin has done to Norman, and want his inventions in exchange for Harry.

Hobgoblin later has a secret conversation with Norman Osborn and asks him for another weapon so he can secretly betray Fisk, as part of a plan to double-cross Osborn. so Osborn gives Hobgoblin a new larger remote-controlled glider with AI-controlled missiles called ""Smart Bombs"". this is later broken up by Spider-Man who swings into another air-battle with Hobgoblin to avenge Aunt May, who is in hospital."

Spider-Man later discusses with Norman Osborn about why he was talking to the Hobgoblin earlier, but he tells him that he needed to trust the Hobgoblin for a deal about betraying Wilson ""Kingpin"" Fisk because Fisk put him in risk of losing his life's work.

Hobgoblin later returns to the Kingpin's secret lair in the Empire State Building and demands he gets paid (as Fisk had refused to pay him before), but instead Fisk fires him after revealing the security footage that Smythe had taken earlier of him discussing to Norman Osborn about betraying the Kingpin. Fisk orders his henchman guards to have Hobgoblin terminated, but Hobgoblin uses his explosives and new glider to battle the henchmen, and eventually results in Hobgoblin defeating the henchmen, almost destroying the lair and presumably killing the Kingpin and his sidekick Allistair Smythe off-screen. Hobgoblin decides to take the Empire State Building for his own and lead the Kingpin's crime organisation, as well as continuing to take Harry hostage.

Hobgoblin later tells Norman Osborn about his success of killing Fisk through video call, but tells him that he has changed his mind about their deal and orders him to give him the entire ownership of Oscorp in exchange for his son Harry. Fisk then reveals himself to Osborn and explains that he and Smythe escaped via a secret tunnel underneath the Empire State Building, and that they could use it to stop the Hobgoblin's schemes and pay him out. Norman decides to hire Spider-Man for the mission who agrees, seeing it as an opportunity to avenge Aunt May during her recovery of unconsciousness.

Norman Osborn shows Spider-Man the way into the tunnel, allowing Spider-Man to enter the Empire State Building and sneak into the Hobgoblin's secret lair. Spider-Man, after sneaking up on Hobgoblin, gets into a battle with him that causes Hobgoblin to accidentally blow up the lair. Hobgoblin eventually lets an unconscious imprisoned Harry go with Spider-Man before escaping on his glider. Spider-Man exits through the secret tunnel, before it is exploded by the Kingpin and Smythe.

after Spider-Man gives the unconscious freed Harry back to Norman, he questions Osborn about being responsible for everything the Hobgoblin did because he did not care about Harry. but Osborn tells him he really did care about Harry, but realises he just did not think about him enough. Hobgoblin then breaks in and attempts to kill the Osborns by crashing the ceiling down onto them, but Norman attempts to save Harry, proving how much he actually cares for him. Spider-Man then swings into a rooftop battle with the Hobgoblin, which eventually ends in Spider-Man jumping into a chimney to dodge the Hobgoblin, causing the Hobgoblin to crash into the chimney, fly out of control and crash into the nearby Hudson Lake, drowning and killing him.

Peter Parker then returns to the hospital where Aunt May is still unconscious, and Peter girlfriend Mary Jane Watson is staying to watch, hoping for her recovery. Mary Jane tells Peter that she has decided not to move out from her aunt because of what happened to Aunt May. Aunt May then awakens from her unconsciousness and tells Peter that he is probably not ready to move out yet, and that saving Fisk from the accident with the Hobgoblin was the right choice and that ""Uncle Ben would have been very proud"".

as the Hobgoblin's ghost floats up to the moon, he whispers in an echoing voice: ""don't forget me, Spider-Man, I won't forget you!""."

Miriam ""Midge"" Weissman admits she is doing something unusual by making a funny speech at her own wedding reception. She has just married Joel Maisel, her ""knight in shining armor"" whom she met while she was attending Bryn Mawr College. Flashbacks reveal that some of her account of how Joel courted her is being varnished to conceal the fact that they had premarital sex and that he took her to burlesque shows rather than ""poetry readings"" as she claims. At the strip club she sees the comic Lenny Bruce for the first time. Finally, Midge jokes that the food at the reception contains shellfish, strictly prohibited by Jewish dietary law, leading to an exodus from the reception, led by the rabbi.

Four years later, the Maisels have two children. Midge is happy about the approach of Yom Kippur because the rabbi, who has finally forgiven her shellfish joke, has agreed to join her family to break the fast after Yom Kippur.

Midge actively supports her junior executive husband's dream of becoming a stand-up comic, although she thinks it is just for fun while he is very serious about it. She meets him at his office before they go out to the Gaslight Cafe, which hosts an open mic for musicians, poets and comics in Greenwich Village. Incidentally, Midge notices that Joel's secretary, Penny, a skinny but pretty girl, cannot even work an electric pencil sharpener.

Midge brings hot dishes she has made for Baz, the manager of the Gaslight, to bribe him to bump Joel ahead in the line up so that he can perform at 10:30 PM rather than 1:45 AM. Baz's assistant, Susie, gives Midge a hard time because she takes a dim view of Joel as a comic.

Seen for the first time, Joel's act does get some laughs, but when Midge applies her eye and ear for detail to help him improve, she notes that not everyone enjoyed his performance.

Midge sees Bob Newhart do a routine on TV and realizes that it is the same routine that Joel does. Joel claims that all comics ""borrow"" from each other and urges Midge not to worry about it. She accepts this explanation although she is not comfortable with it.

On the eve of Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, they go to the cafe. Joel is nervous because a colleague, Archie Cleary, and his wife, Imogene, come to see him perform. He also feels nervous because the sweater Midge brought for him to wear has moth holes. Midge suggests that he use the holes in his sweater to make a joke. He is especially concerned, though, because he never set up a time to perform, so he might have to go on too late for Archie and Imogene's schedule. Midge tries to bribe the manager as usual, but Susie says Baz is away. Midge asks Susie to give Joel a good time slot, but Susie is noncommittal. Just as Joel and the Clearys are about to leave, Susie tells Joel he is on next.

Joel gets up and tries to joke about his sweater, but he rambles. He abruptly launches into his usual routine but loses his place and stumbles badly. On the way home, he blames Midge for suggesting he talk about his sweater. Midge says that she had meant that he should ""put it in the form of a joke.""

At home, Joel continues to blames her not only for bombing at the comedy club but for his dissatisfaction with his job, home, family, and life in general. He packs a suitcase and announces that he is leaving her for his secretary, Penny, with whom he has been having an affair. ""You have the worst timing,"" says Midge, referring both to the reason why Joel bombed and his choice of moments to leave the marriage. He leaves her to deal with their children, her parents and the rabbi who is expected to visit the following day. When Midge breaks the news to her parents, they blame her, too.

Midge drinks a whole bottle of wine that is meant for the next evening's gathering. She then goes to the Gaslight to get back her casserole dish. During a break when the M.C. wanders off-stage, she gets up to deliver an impromptu monologue about her marriage break up and how she is superior to Penny in both mind and body. She has the audience - including Susie - in stitches until she exposes her breasts to demonstrate that her husband has no excuse on that account to abandon her. Two policemen promptly walk in and arrest her. To no avail Susie pleads with them, ""She's just a housewife. She doesn't know the rules."" The police put her in the back of their squad car right next Lenny Bruce and put both of them in jail.

Susie bails Midge out and tries to convince her to become a stand up comic. Susie says she has seen lots of bad comics like Joel, but only two comics have ever appeared at the Gaslight who were any good. One was Mort Sahl, a now successful comic, and the other is Midge. She offers to become Midge's mentor, but Midge turns her down.

After going home, Midge changes her mind. She bails Lenny Bruce out of jail just to ask him if he really loves stand up. He won't admit it, but Midge concludes that he does. She searches for Susie, finding her at home in an apartment so tiny that the door won't open all the way once Susie opens her folding bed.

As Hill predicted, police find the body of PC Merrick who received hundreds of burn marks on his chest and died from a conical object forced into him rectally. Police narrow in on a suspect, arresting a man they believe attacked fellow officer. Superintendent Cross brings Hill to the suspect's house so Hill can gain a sense for the suspects personality and provide his professional opinion on whether the suspect is the killer.
