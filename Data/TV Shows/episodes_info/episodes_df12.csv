Rarity does things neatly and takes her time, while Applejack's methods are a little more fast and dirty.

However, in the middle of their argument, the rain starts up. Being too far away from their own homes, they hear Twilight calling to them from her place nearby. Taking shelter inside, Twilight feels that with 2 of her friends unable to leave because of the storm, they should have a slumber party!

Both Rarity and Applejack want to leave and get away fro each other, but upon Twilight insisting she's never had a slumber party before (but always wanted to have one!), they decide to stay for her sake.

During the course of the evening, they do everything from makeovers, make s'mores, play truth-or-dare, and have a pillow fight, with each task making Applejack and Rarity even more upset with the others.

Finally when it's time for bed, the two are unable to sleep, making a loud racket, causing Twilight to yell she isn't having a good time.

Just then, a lightning bolt strikes a nearby tree, which crashes through a nearby window. Applejack and Rarity begin to argue again, before finally realizing that it's getting them nowhere. Putting aside their differences, they manage to clean up the mess, just as the storm ends."

Her friends explain that Zecora lives in the Everfree Forest. Though noone's taken time to talk to the Zebra, many of them assume she does evil things.

Twilight refuses to believe this, when she and the others notice Applebloom is missing! They follow her trail to the Everfree forest, finding her on the edge of a field of blue flowers. Zecora is also there, and warns the ponies to 'beware!'

All of them return home and go to sleep, but wake up the next day with strange afflictions:

-Twilight Sparkle's unicorn horn has softened

-Pinkie Pie's tongue has swollen up, and all she can do is spit

-Rainbow Dash's wings are inverted, and she is unable to fly properly.

-Rarity's hair has grown incredibly long, hindering her sight and movement.

-Applejack has shrunk to a small size

-Fluttershy's voice is deeper and male-sounding

Almost everyone assumes that Zecora has placed a curse on them. As they discuss this, Applebloom sneaks away, but is tagged along by Applejack, who hides in her hair. As Applebloom nears the Everfree Forest, Applebloom comes out of hiding, and demands her sister go back to Ponyville. However, Applebloom refuses, and places her 'little' sister on a tree branch, before wandering back on her way to Zecora's.

Shortly afterwards, the others find Applejack, and continue on their way to Zecora's, where they see her working over a bubbling pot, and wondering just where Applebloom is.

The others then burst into her hut, assuming she is going to cook Applebloom, before Applebloom appears in the doorway, having returned from finding some ingredients for Zecora.

Both Applebloom and Zecora explain that the reason for the pony's afflictions, was due to their encounter with the field of blue flowers the previous day. The flower is called 'poison joke,' and Zecora was making a cure for them. However, not all of the ingredients she has will work, and she needs to get them from Ponyville.

The others help Zecora return to Ponyville, and show the others in town that they have nothing to fear. Eventually, the girls are returned to normal."

The mood isn't helped when classmates Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon make fun of her, and display their own that they have gotten. Even so, the two have invited Applebloom to Diamond Tiara's 'Cutecinera.'

Applebloom angrily tells how she is upset at not having her cutie mark, and Applejack claims that she took time to get hers too. Hearing this, Applebloom assumes that maybe she needs to help her sister to get hers. However, her many attempts to help sell apples just annoy other ponies to the point, that Applejack sends her away.

Pinkie Pie asks for Applebloom's help in baking, but the results offer no results.

Twilight Sparkle comes by, and knowing of her magical powers, Applebloom begs Twilight to make a cutie mark appear. However, no magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time, and all of Twilight's attempts quickly fade.

Rainbow Dash even puts Applebloom through all sorts of sports, but each attempt brings about nothing.

Eventually, Applebloom goes to the Cutecinera, but wears a make-shift skirt to hide her blank-flank. However, when she gets it caught and the skirt comes off, she is made fun of by several of the kids (including Diamond Tiara), when two voices suddenly come to Applebloom's defense.

The two fillies are Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, who also do not have cutie marks. Applebloom then decides to create a club with the girls, called the Cutie Mark Crusaders, with the attempt to find out what their special talents are."

When Twilight Sparkle stops by Rarity's with a dress she would like to have mended for the upcoming Grand Galloping Gala. However, Rarity claims that the dress does not seem formal enough for such a major event, and gets a most generous idea: create gown for herself and all of their friends who are going, and then put on a fashion show afterwards to show them off!

After happily working through her designs based on what she knows of her friends, Rarity eagerly shows them off...but is met with a lukewarm reception. She then vows to take the others' comments regarding improvements. However, the final results look more garish.

Even so, Spike lets slip to fashion critic Hoity-Toity of Rarity's latest fashion designs and the upcoming show. Rarity goes through with showing the dresses, but every pony that is there doesn't think much of the altered designs, and Hoity-Toity finds them horrible.

This sends Rarity into a depressive state, and her friends feel bad for how they seemed to take advantage of her generosity. They then surprise Rarity by finishing the dress she wanted to make for herself, and claim that their friend's designs were much better than theirs.

They then get Hoity-Toity to go for a second showing, and showcase the original designs Rarity made, which greatly impress him. Hoity then asks Rarity to help him with an upcoming fashion showcase of his own."

Going after them, Fluttershy is shocked to find Twilight Sparkle, turned to stone!

As they leave, Pinkie's friends compliment her on another great party, and mention that she should throw another party again real soon.

The next day, Pinkie goes to each of her friends and tells them that she's throwing an after-party for Gummi that very afternoon. However, each of her friends tells Pinkie that they are busy with other things.

Pinkie Pie's suspicions are further raised when she notices Twilight Sparkle picking up something from the bakery, and seeing the wrapped item passed along to each of her friends. Eventually, it passes into the hooves of Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie follows her friend straight to AppleJack's barn. AppleJack denies anything is going on, and Pinkie leaves, even more convinced that her friends are spiting her behind her back.

Hoping to get more information, she offers Spike some jewels if he will tell her ""that her friends are lying and avoiding her, because they don't like her parties and don't want to be her friend anymore."" Not sure exactly why she wants to hear this, Spike repeats what she just said, and Pinkie thinks she's figured it out...but then loses the bounce in her pink hair, as she truly believes this to be the case.

Even so, she holds Gummi's after-party, but with makeshift 'friends' made out of things like a bucket of turnips, a sack of flour, and a stack of rocks.

Finally, after some forceful shoving, Rainbow Dash manages to get her friend to come along, and Pinkie finds all the other ponies waiting for her inside the barn with a surprise party.

At first, Pinkie Pie misconstrues this as a surprise 'farewell party,' still believing that her friends are disowning her. However, they soon convince her that she's wrong, and that it's not her farewell party, but her Birthday party! Apparently, the group had been planning this for some time, and that is why they couldn't make it to Gummi's after-party party.

With reassurance that her friends still love her, the bounce returns to Pinkie Pie's hair, and she parties with her friends."

Once they all arrive, each of the 6 goes their separate ways (including Spike, who instead of attending the party, goes to a nearby donut shop). However, each of the ponies soon finds their expectations let down:

-Twilight Sparkle ends up receiving and greeting guests along with the Princess -Applejack finds few takers willing to buy her goods -Rainbow Dash gets to hang out with the Wonderbolts, but they are soon preoccupied with other matters -Rarity meets Prince Blueblood, but finds him more concerned with himself than anyone else -Pinkie Pie's partying ways seem 'unrefined' compared to others -Fluttershy is unable to find any of the garden's creatures to make friends with

Each of the 6 then plans to do whatever they can to make it the best night ever. But in the end, the Gala dissolves into chaos, and (at the Princess' suggestion) all 6 quickly beat a hasty retreat.

They find Spike at the donut shop, and are also soon joined by Celestia. The Princess claims to have enjoyed how the night went, and even though it didn't go as planned, all of them claim they enjoyed the night as well!"

Cutler'],[''],[],[],[],"""Nashville"" - ""Pilot"" - Oct. 10, 2012

Welcome to ""Nashville,"" ABC's new drama set in the world of country music and politics in Music City.

Let's meet our players shall we?

First there is Rayna Jaymes (Connie Britton), a hitmaker for 20 years and the reigning queen of country music.

Next up is Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere), a young country pop upstart who is just hitting the big time.

Teddy Conrad (Eric Close) is Rayna's husband. He's a businessman who was once successful but a series of bad deals have shaken up their finances and relegated him to house husband and ""Mr. Rayna Jaymes.""

Lamar Wyatt (Powers Boothe) is Rayna's dad, a possibly ruthless and powerful Nashville businessman with his hand in many pots in the city.

Coleman Carlisle (Robert Wisdom) is a city councilor and old family friend who is counting on Rayna and Wyatt's support for a run for mayor.

Tandy Wyatt (Judith Hoag) is Rayna's sister and her dad's right hand woman.

Watty White (J.D. Souther) is ""the pope of Nashville,"" a respected songwriter-producer-DJ who helped Rayna make her career.

Deacon Claybourne (Chip Esten) is Rayna's longtime bandleader, who was once Rayna's lover.

Avery Barkley (Jonathan Jackson), is an up and coming singer-songwriter trying to get Deacon's attention.

Gunnar Scott (Sam Palladio) is also a singer-songwriter who works at the famous Bluebird Cafe who already has Deacon's attention and approval.

And Scarlett O'Connor (Clare Bowen) is Deacon's niece, is a poet who dates Avery.

Let's begin.

We open in Rayna and Teddys' big old rock star house. Their two girls are running around while Rayna, her hair in curlers, is getting ready for an event. The girls ask why mom has to go to work, and Teddy says it's because someone has to make money. One says ""but I thought we were rich?"" Teddy says they are but they are what's known as ""cash poor"" and it's bad manners to talk about money.

We cut to Rayna onstage at the Grand Ole Opry singing, presumably, one her greatest hits ""Already Gone,"" with her band including Deacon. It's a concert to celebrate Watty White.

After her performance she walks offstage and hugs Watty and Deacon re-introduces her to his ""little niece"" Scarlett who has grown into a beautiful young woman since Rayna last saw her. We meet her boyfriend Avery and Rayna tells them if they need anything to give her a ring.

We cut to Juliette's very busy dressing room. Stacks of her book lay on a nearby table and she's getting her make-up done. She's told her busy itinerary coming up including spots on ""Good Morning America."" She is asked to approve a bottle from the nearby cache of perfume bottles. She sprays one on her wrist and complains it has no smell. Her publicist points out that they're dummy bottles with water, she's just supposed to be approving THE BOTTLE. Then her phone rings. The publicist answers and looks stricken saying it's Juliette's mother. Juliette takes the phone annoyed, and even though we clearly hear her mother asking for money she pretends there is no one there and hangs up. She asks how her mother got her new cell number. Her publicist stammers. Then her manager enters and says it's time for her to meet Rayna. She gets all catty asking exactly how it benefits her to go be nice to Rayna. Her manager says it's not for her it's for the label and she needs to kiss the ring of the country royalty.

Rayna runs into Coleman and his wife backstage and he asks her to come do a song Monday when he announces his mayoral run. She says she'd love to and will check her schedule.

On her way to meet Rayna, Juliette stops and gushes to Deacon how much she admires him and flirts with him heavily. She tells her manager how much she loves him and he says he's the best there is. She wonders why he's not in her band then. He says he's been with Rayna forever. Juliette then bumps hard into Avery. She takes a look at him and says she hopes to do it again sometime but more slowly. He looks dazed and Scarlett smacks him.

Rayna enters her dressing room which is filled with Watty and some of the suits from her record company and her manager. Scarlett enters and she makes a beeline for Watty and shines Rayna. Watty then introduces her. She makes a veiled comment about Rayna's age saying her mother was a big fan and used to listen to Rayna when Juliette was in her belly. Rayna retorts that since she has to go on soon Juliette might want to go and tuck in her ""girls"" in response to her spilling decolletage.

Juliette departs and the suits get down to business: Rayna's latest album is tanking and ticket sales are soft. They have a proposal: she should jump onJuliette's tour as a ""co-headliner."" What they really mean is as her ""opener."" Rayna is completely offended. The suits say it's the new record label bosses idea, and it's pointed out to her that it's better than playing half-empty houses. They'll need her answer by Monday they say.

We then cut to Juliette performing one of her poppy tunes onstage with all the girls in the crowd singing along. Rayna watches in her dressing room and turns it off in disgust. The next day Rayna rushes to show up at event honoring her dad. The mayor is dubbing it Lamar Wyatt day for his great philanthropy. She shows up and Lamar gives her a hard time for being late. He grumbles that he asks for so little and she rolls her eyes. After the event Tandy thanks Rayna for showing and says it means a lot to their dad. Rayna says not to ask her for any more favors like this because she's going through a tough time right now.

We cut to Juliette recording a new track in the studio. We learn that Auto-Tune is her friend. Her producer has eyes for her. (It turns out that he's Rayna's producer too.)

Driving her girls in the car they ask to go on tour with her as back up singers and sing a bit of one of her songs. They sound pretty good. She says they're hired, once they graduate college. (They look to be about 9 and 11). Juliette's song comes on the radio and they crank it up and start singing along in a nice harmony. Rayna snaps it off. They protest and she says ""Mama's got a headache.""

Back at home Rayna stares in the mirror distraught pulling at her face. Teddy comes in and tells her to stop doing that and if she ever gets a facelift he'll leave her. She spills the news about the tanking record and the Juliette Barnes tour. He wonders if it's really such a terrible idea. She says it is because she'll have to lie and say she likes Juliette's music. He says she's lied for worse. She is stricken. He tells her she doesn't have to put herself through this. She says she does if they want to keep living in their house. This is clearly a conversation they've had because he says he's sorry about his bad deals but he's not the first guy to go bust and he's working on some deals to put them in better shape. In the meantime, he points out, she could borrow money from her dad. This incenses her saying she will never do this and he doesn't know her dad like she does and she can't go there and that she'd rather wait table. She says she doesn't want to be like her sister, a handmaiden. He points out that when Lamar dies Tandy will be one of the most powerful people in the state. She says that isn't the point. He says he gets he's a lousy dad but it may be time to swallow her pride. Rayna refuses.

She goes to see her producer and says maybe it's time for her to cut some of those radio ready songs he suggested and release one as a bonus track. He says all those songs are gone. He also lets slip he's producing Juliette's record. She's annoyed. He tells her he's in no position to turn down work. She tells him to stop getting married and just date. She then gripes about Juliette's music wondering why anyone likes it since it sounds like feral cats to her. We cut to Juliette in the producer's bed overhearing all of this.

We then head over to the Bluebird where Deacon is performing in a songwriter's night. Juliette, incognito listens to his sad ballad and wipes away some tears. After he finishes he signs autographs and chats with Scarlett. Avery asks him if he's heard his demo, it's alt-country. Deacon gives him a hard time and tells him to worry more about being worthy of his favorite niece. Gunnar approaches and compliments his show. He was running the sound board. Deacon compliments him and says it won't be long before Gunnar's songs are getting heard since Deacon thinks he's very good. He tells Gunnar to keep an eye on Scarlett. Outside the club Juliette is waiting for him. She flirts some more and asks him if she can record the song he just sang and if he'll come play it in the studio with her. She asks him to be in her band. He says he's with Rayna. Juliette says she heard that tour might be off. This is news to Deacon. She says she will work around his schedule and she'll pay double what Rayna pays because she wants the best. She says they could write together and ""have a lot of fun on the road."" She says Rayna's not the only woman in the world. He points out that she's a girl. She says ""that too"" and then hops in an SUV and zooms off.

The next day standing in a field Tandy and Lamar meet with folks who want to build a major league baseball park in Nashville. They think Coleman will oppose the deal so Lamar says he's going to run his own candidate: Teddy Conrad. He asks Tandy how badly he thinks Rayna will try to screw it up for them. Tandy says she's absolutely going to lose it.

In tour rehearsal Rayna doesn't like the in-ear monitors and gets frustrated. Her manager tells her that he told Coleman she would sing two songs at his announcement and that the label head Marshall wants her answer.

She and Deacon take a walk. She talks about how not that long ago she was the future of country music. He points out that she's been saying she's been wanting to take a break for the girls. She says yes, but she wants it to be her choice. She says she's not ready to hang up her rhinestones and she doesn't want to screw her crew, especially her. He tells her about Juliette's come on. Rayna wonders what he said. He said not available until otherwise notified. She points out that she's got Randy her producer doing her records, wants Deacon and wonders if she's coming for her house next. He says Juliette wants to write with him. Rayna says that she got him in his soft spot. He says he wondered why she never cut one of his songs. She says she figured they were all about her and that would be weird. He says they are. They talk in a way that makes it clear that they used to be an item, and a pretty hot one. She wishes for a do over. He asks what she would change. She says nothing. Then everything. She says she needs a drink and asks him to walk her to Tootsie's. He says he can't, he's got a ""meeting"" i.e. an AA meeting. She wonders if he ever misses the wild old days, he says he does, but not the headaches. She says she doesn't want to hold him back and wants him to be happy. He says he can't be, he lost the thing that would make him happy a long time ago.

Rayna is on the radio with Watty talking about her favorite songs including Tammy Wynette's ""Stand By Your Man."" We learn she lost her mom when she was 12. She and Watty talk about her next move, he says to keep an open mind and to reinvent herself a bit. She asks if he thinks Juliette's a flash in the pan. He does not.

Juliette is late for her recording session with Randy. She's in tears dealing with her mom on the phone. We cut to her mom who is clearly an addict and begging Juliette for money. She hangs up with her and Randy enters and they start making out.

Lamar and the bigwigs take Teddy out to lunch to win him over. He wonders if his financial ruin and inexperience won't work against him. Lamar says he's got faith in him and, really, that's all that matters he says to not let his failures define him but to refine him. Teddy asks him not to hurt Cole Carlisle who is a good man and tells him no dirty tricks or rumors. He doesn't want to destroy Carlisle's family or reputation. Wyatt agrees. They say they'll announce on Monday and Lamar tells him to tell Rayna, that his first job as a candidate is to grow a pair.

We cut to Teddy and Rayna arguing about it in their kitchen. She knows it wasn't his idea and says that he doesn't want to be owned by her dad and he'll regret it. He says if it goes well she can take a break or retire. She scoffs at this, at the idea of standing on the side of the stage smiling and shaking hands. He carps that she can't tell him anything about standing on the side of the stage that he doesn't already know. He says he knows he wasn't her first choice and that she settled but he's been there every step of the way for her and maybe it's time that the spotlight shone on him for a change. She is chagrined. She tells him that she told Cole she'd perform at his announcement. He asks what she's going to do. She says nothing and he says he'll go check on the kids.

Back at the Bluebird Gunnar compliments Scarlett's book of poems and says they are songs. She says her inspiration was a break up with Avery. He wonders what she sees in him. She says she's tried to be without him but can't. He's the one. Gunnar doesn't believe in that. He asks if she thought about putting them to music. She says she does a little. He asks her to sing the melodies she hears while he plays. They begin working something up.

The next morning Rayna waits in the lobby of her record label, Edgehill Republic, where one of her album covers is dwarfed by Juliette's. She goes in to meet with the suits and asks why the loyalty she's shown to this company for 21 years, one she helped build with her success-- which brought her multiplatinum records, Grammys and CMAs-- isn't being returned to her. He's basically like, yeah, yeah, yeah what have you done for us lately? He thinks she and Juliette will be a huge event. He says she has to find her place in a new market. She says so if she doesn't open for their little ingenue who wouldn't make it as one of her back up singers they won't support her? He says those aren't his words but he needs her decision. She says he can kiss her decision as it's walking out the tour.

She then goes to confront her dad and Tandy about Teddy's mayoral run. They claim their trying to help get back in the game. Rayna wonders if she's trying to lure him with money because they won't accept it. Lamar says he knows he's too proud to accept anything from him but maybe she should consider how she got to be so famous in the first place and implies that maybe he gave her a little help behind the scenes at the beginning and paid for her first album. She is aghast. He then says he wants her by her own husband's side. He then implies that he knows one of her children, Maddie, is not Teddy's and that this news would be hard for him to hear. Rayna freaks out and says she can't be bought and won't be there. He tells her not to make him her enemy because his enemies don't fare too well.

She goes and sits on a bridge in her car in a thunderstorm.

Randy goes to the gated community where Juliette lives in the same thunderstorm.

At the Bluebird they've run out of open mic participants and Gunnar goads Scarlett to come sing one of her songs with him. It just so happens that Watty White is in the house. As they sing their very beautiful song he makes a call.

Randy shows up at Juliette's door but she turns him away. She's busy entertaining... Deacon.

We cut to Coleman Carlisle's campaign announcement and see Rayna walking through the kitchen. We then cut to Teddy's announcement. And just when Rayna's about to go onstage Watty's call comes through and he holds up the phone to Gunnar and Scarlett singing. She is floored. He says he'll call her back and he has an idea.

Just when we think she is going to show up to Coleman's announcement we see she has gone to support Teddy instead. She smiles and waves. Lamar and Tandy look on approvingly."

Cutler'],[''],[],[],[],"Rayna gets stuck in traffic taking her girls to school. Juliette Barnes is shooting a video nearby, her daughter informs her she's ""like, the most famous singer in the world.""

Juliette films the video for ""Telescope"" as crowds of adoring fans watch, screaming for autographs. Juliette hears a PA say the song is great for 12 year olds and she demands he be fired. She wants to know the status of getting Deacon Claybourne on her tour to prove she can do more than pop music for preteens.

Rayna gets the bad news from Bucky, that sales are flat and there are no singles. Waddy suggests she get back with Deacon and do a smaller tour, music she can care about again. She doesn't think they can pull off their old love songs anymore or know what Deacon would think about it. Deacon arrives.

Later at home, Rayna tries to convince Teddy that her touring with Deacon is a good idea. She reminds him he didn't consult her before running for mayor. He wants her available for some upcoming campaign things, including a ""vulnerability study"" but she chafes at the idea of baring her personal life.

Waddy talks to the young singers he saw at the Bluebird cafe. They tell him they're not a couple. If they can get three songs together, he offers to cut the demo himself. He tells Gunnar that Scarlett is Gunnar's ticket.

At the studio, Juliette asks Deacon when they can finish writing their song. Rayna arrives to record with him. Juliette asks about their ""little tour."" ""It's just a show for people who love actual music,"" Rayna jabs. Juliette reiterates her offer to Deacon to finish writing together and Rayna can't believe her gall to say it in front of her, knowing where songwriting with Deacon leads. He doesn't seem to mind the possibility.

Scarlett comes home to find her boyfriend Avery bummed to learn a manager won't be coming to hear him perform after all. She doesn't tell him her news.

After recording, Rayna asks if Juliette's people made Deacon an offer to tour with her. He reminds Rayna that he chose her.

But moments later, Rayna sees Deacon ride off with Juliette. She drives him to her private lake once owned by Tammy Wynette and shows him her 1938 Martin guitar. He's impressed. She tries to distract him by kissing him, but he wants to stick to writing.

Rayna goes to see Coleman Carlisle to find out why her dad is mad at him. Carlisle argued against a baseball stadium Lamar wanted in a public meeting.

Back at the café, Gunnar tries to convince Scarlett to entertain Waddy's offer. She invites him to Avery's gig tomorrow.

Rayna arrives for Teddy's fundraiser. Some women tell her they're big fans and suggest she put a record out. She tells them it just came out. ""Do they have it at Starbucks?""

Rayna talks to her father and tells him the way he's gotten into things with Coleman is silly.

Deacon and Juliette make progress on their song, singing well together. He's impressed. She tries to convince him again to come on tour with her. And then she takes her shirt off and jumps in the lake. He takes his off to join her and proclaims himself a dead man.

Teddy meets with two men for the vulnerability study. He denies having girlfriends and they switch to real estate, asking about Cumberland Plaza Development. He was on the board of the credit union backing the deal but resigned before the deal fell apart.

Scarlett rocks out to Avery's band. Gunnar tries to like it. After the set, a girl in the audience goes to talk to Avery, but recognizes Gunnar and Scarlett and compliments them on their set. Avery is upset that he didn't know she performed, then Scarlett lets the Waddy thing slip. She tries to downplay it, but he manages a weak congratulations.

Coleman visits Lamar, who warns him not to mess with him. ""Loyalty's a one way street with you, so you just know, whatever you give that's what you're gonna get back,"" Coleman tells him.

Deacon and Rayna go over stage set up. Someone brings a guitar delivery for Deacon from Juliette, mentioning it's worth at least $50,000. ""What the hell is that?"" Rayna asks. ""Sometimes a guitar is just a guitar,"" Deacon says.

Rayna accuses him of not focusing enough on their tour and spending time instead with ""Miss Sparklypants."" They get in an argument and she storms out.

At home, Juliette is upset Deacon hasn't even said thank you. Glenn tries to cheer her up with a rough cut of her video, but she hates it and thinks it won't help her get Deacon in her band.

Rayna comes home to find the vulnerability study men waiting for her. Juliette records the song she and Deacon wrote, which includes the refrain ""it's a whole lot harder to shine than undermine.""

They ask her about the overlap between her seeing Deacon and Teddy. She ended things with Deacon when he went into rehab. She paid for his treatment. She married Teddy while Deacon was in rehab. They ask if she ever cheated and she politely cuts things short.

Scarlett goes to the Bluebird and see Gunnar performing in a three-piece honky tonk band. Later, she tells Gunnar she doesn't want to record with him. She doesn't want to mess things up with Avery. He asks if she wants to be with someone who doesn't support who she is. She says Avery will support her whatever she does. ""Then what's the problem?"" he asks.

Teddy apologizes to Rayna for not including her in his decision to run for office, and says he wants to support her, too.

Juliette shows up at Deacon's house with the demo she recorded of their song. She wants to record it with him. He says he can't keep the guitar, but asks what she thinks of the demo. ""I think something about you makes me want to grow up,"" she says.

Lamar gets the vetting report, including their theory that there's something fishy to the Cumberland deal. Lamar likes that Teddy has secrets, he thinks it'll make him easier to control.

At home, Teddy burns documents in the fireplace.

Deacon plays his regular set at the Bluebird café. Scarlett waits tables, Waddy, Juliette and Rayna are in the audience.

He tells the audience he has a ""special friend"" in the audience he wants to call up to perform. Juliette thinks he means her, but he calls up Rayna.

She sings one of their oldest songs, that includes the chorus ""no one will ever love you like I do."" Juliette seethes in the audience as Rayna and Deacon sing intimately to each other. Julieete can't help but mouth the words in the audience.

Waddy points at Scarlett and Gunnar and then to Rayna and Deacon. ""Ok, let's do it,"" Scarlett tells Gunnar.

The crowd eats it up. Deacon takes Rayna's hand. Juliette fights off tears as she leaves.

After the show, in the car, Rayna and Deacon sit in stunned silence, digesting their feelings. ""I wish we hadn't done that song,"" she says. ""Now what are we going to do?"" he asks.

Rayne goes home and hugs Teddy close. ""I love you,"" she says."

Drama, bombshells, soap opera acting, little kids singing! All that and more on tonight's ""Nashville.""

We open on a Juliette Barnes photo shoot. In between clicks she asks her manager Glen about getting Deacon on the tour. He says he's working on it but more importantly her mother showed up at the label and they gave her $100 to leave. Juliette is livid saying her mom is a drug addict and no one can give her anything. She says he is his manager and Deacon and her mom? Manage it.

At the Jaymes-Conrad household they're rushing to get ready for school. Maddie is concerned about what she's suposed to wear to the talent show since 7th graders are supposed to show belly and sideboob. Rayna is all ""what?"" Then Teddy takes the girls off to school and Deacon calls. Rayna panics and says now is a bad time and then Deacon's lawyer calls. She tells him to take it. Deacon's lawyers say Juliette's people keep calling. Deacon testily says he's not available.

Gunnar and Scarlett are rehearsing a song at Scarlett and Avery's place when Avery comes home and interrupts. Gunnar tries to be nice, comparing Avery's guitar tone to Link Wray. He grumps off to another room as not to bug them.

Rayna's manager Bucky and accountant Joe have a come to Jesus meeting with Teddy and Rayna about their finances. He says they need to cut their monthly nut in half or else they'll lose their house. Teddy freaks out about the campaign. Bucky brings up the Juliette tour once more. She shoots it down again. Joe says she should borrow money from her dad. She passes. The only option that seems good to them is trying to take a loan out on the house.

Coming out of the studio with Glenn and her publicist, Juliette is confronted by her mother. She leaves Glenn to deal with it and takes off.

Juliette is in the studio and they're talking about Deacon again and she huffs and puffs that he said no. She calls him directly and leaves a message and says if he wants ""Undermine"" on the album they have to record it today.

Scarlett and Gunnar go into the studio with Watty but it's all too overwhelming for Scarlett who basically chokes and Watty tells them to table it for the day. He pulls Gunnar aside and tells him since it's just a demo and they're only trying to get a publishing deal anybody could sing on the songs, it doesn't have to be Scarlett. Scarlett is put off by this but tries to brush it off and says it might be better anyway Avery-wise. She tells Gunnar to let her know if he needs anything.

Joe runs down the tour itinerary with Rayna and Deacon. He leaves them to work out the setlist. Deacon wants to start with the early ones like ""Don't Leave Without Me"" and ""That Could Be Us."" She suggests focusing on the hits instead, presumably songs he didn't write abot her like ""Already Gone"" and ""Last Stand."" He counters they can do whatever they want but without a band and back up singers doing what they did at the Bluebird the other night might be a better call since they will be smaller, quieter, more intimate venues. She seems spooked by this and says she needs some time to think. He says he has something to do anyway and that they can hook up later.

Rayna is going through potential wardrobe for the tour with an assistant in her bedroom and the girls are trying on the clothes. The little one Daphne starts singing into a shoe along with George Jones the radio. Just as her old hit with Deacon-- that she sang the other night at the Bluebird-- ""No One Will Ever Love You"" is about to come on she shuts it off over Maddie's protestations. Then her assistant enters with an envelope. Inside is a check for $500,000 from Lamar with a note attached. The note has a list of demands if they take the money.

Juliette is cutting ""Undermine"" when Deacon enters. He adds his dulcet harmonies to the track. They listen back after in the control room. Juliette asks for five and Deacon gets her to admit that the last verse is about her mother. She never comes out and says she's a drug addict but admits they are no longer close. She grumps about Rayna's career being handed to her since she grew up rich. Deacon saysRayna took her knocks. Juliette says she'd take those knocks. She asks him about his part of the song. He says it's just about him. She says that's why she loves it so much.

Teddy and Rayna discuss the check from Lamar. He says he didn't ask Lamar for a loan. The demands include that Rayna can't release a new album unless it's a greatest hits, she can't tour during re-election, if she does tour it can't be more than 15 dates. She calls him crazy. Teddy agrees and tells her to just tear up the check. She says he should ask the folks at the credit union for a loan against the house since he used to be on the board. He says he'll try saying he got them into the mess and he will try and get 'em out.

At the girls' talent show Rayna signs a CD for a fan and Teddy hears that his friend from the credit union can meet. Lamar shows up with flowers for the girls. Rayna is livid and lays into him about the ""demands."" She asks why he wants her to give up her career so badly. He points out that Teddy is running a campaign and the girls' need their mother. He throws in her dead mom for good measure. She tells him to go home or go to hell but to not stay here. The girls get up and sing their song and they are adorable and really good. Maddie plays guitar and sings lead and Daphne harmonizes on Juliette Barnes' ""Telescope."" It is 8 kinds of adorable. Teddy and Rayna squeeze hands.

Deacon and Juliette get it on again. In bed he wonders how this keeps happening. She says she's irresistible although she points out it didn't help at the Bluebird when he called up Rayna instead of her. She says she wasn't hurt but wishes she was the girl who got picked sometimes. He points out that he's there. She says not like that, but with her music. She gives the hard sell on the tour again and asks what he would say if she asked again right now--naked in bed-- he says it sounds pretty good.

Later after the talent show Tandy and Rayna have a glass of wine in Rayna's backyard. Rayna wonders why Lamar hates her career so much. Tandy spills: their mother had a decade long affair with a country singer-songwriter. Tandy read letters after their mother died. She says that she thinks that it was like her mother's affair made the marriage to Lamar work, like the two men together made a whole marriage. Rayna had no idea. Tandy didn't want to hurt her memory of her mother but she says her career pushes a button in Lamar.

Avery shows up at the Bluebird and Gunnar spills about how she choked in the studio with Watty. Scarlett didn't tell him. Gunnar says she thinks if she really goes after the songwriting thing that Avery will leave her.

Rayna goes to see her dad in the hopes of being sympathetic about her mom but he doesn't make it easy. She says she didn't know and wish she'd had and ever since her mother died he disappeared, effectively being absent in her life except for being mad at her for the path she took. He once again carps about how she wouldn't have a career if he hadn't paid for her first record but she points out that she didn't know this since he didn't tell her until 20 years later. He says he cares about her happiness but that she's proving to have the same disregard for her marriage that her mother did for theirs. She tells him that she's sorry that her mother hurt him but says if he treated her the way he's treated Rayna she understands why her mother did what she did. She says she will never take a penny from him. The next morning at Juliette's her mother shows up at the gate. She turns her away tearfully. Her mother begs her and tells her that she has nowhere else to go and needs her. Juliette points out that there was a time when she needed her too and her mother wasn't there. She tells her security guy to take her to the bus depot and send her home. She walks away crying as her mother yells ""I'm your mama."" She heads back to her house. Deacon has made coffee. She offers to make breakfast he demurs saying he has stuff to do just as Rayna calls. Juliette is sad that he leaves, without even kissing her goodbye.

Teddy goes to the credit union to ask about the loan. The manager Billy says qualifying might be tough but he'll try. But it might take awhile since the IRS is doing an audit. Teddy is clearly worried about this and begs off the loan after all.

At home, Avery hands Scarlett and whisk and brings into her the living room and tells her to sing. He says he will support her and will come into the studio so she can sing to him if she needs it. He tells her it isn't about her, it's about her gift, and she has to share it.

Glenn tells Juliette that her mother made a scene at the bus depot and was picked up with drugs and that the best course of action right now might be allowing her to live with her to keep her out of trouble until they can get her into rehab or send her home.

Deacon and Rayna meet up. She says she hasn't been avoiding him she just doesn't know what to say. He takes the blame saying he doesn't know why he's forcing her to ""say it"" in the first place. She wonders what ""it"" is. That it's all over. She admits that she needs to let him go and doen't want to impede his career and to go do the Juliettte tour. So he asks why she doesn't. She says it's because he and music, they're the same, and she feels like she's holding these hearts in her hands and she's trying not to break them but her heart is in pieces. She says she's trying to do the right thing but none of it feels right. She starts to cry. He looks emotional and says he's going to go and gets up and walks away.

Gunnar and Scarlett head back to the studio and she's doing great. She keeps stealing glances at Avery in the control room. Watty is standing beside him and tells him his girlfriend has ""got it."" Avery introduces himself.

Juliette asks Deacon for an answer and that if he's coming on tour she needs to know she can count on him. He says she deserves that so his answer is no because he's not that guy right now. She is upset and says she hopes Rayna is worth what he's giving up.

Lamar looks through old photos of himself and his wife and is sad.

Juliette's mother arrives and tries to thank and embrace her and Juliette shrugs her off. She heads to a store and does a little...shoplifting. Unfortunately, just before she pocketed a bottle of nail polish a trio of teenage girls spotted her and pulled out a phone and videotaped her stealing it."

We open on Rayna in Teddy in bed. He asks if she knows how much he's missed this. She says ""a lot?"" He agrees. Of course this is just Rayna's dream as Teddy wakes her up.

Across town Juliette wakes up to the police coming to arrest her for shoplifting. They assume she's seen the You Tube video since 4 million others have. She tells them to get a real job and shuts the door in her face.

At the Jaymes-Conrad house Tandy tells Rayna that Teddy is down 12 points in the polls and is practically on life support. Tandy tells the girls that Teddy will win. Rayna offers to sing at Teddy's upcoming fundraiser at the country club. Maddie runs in and show Rayna the video of Juliette stealing.

At the Barnes house Juliette watches as well and seems unfazed although her manager Glenn is freaking and says her publicist McKenna is on the way. (Apparently, she's also Kristen Stewart's publicist.) Juliette's mother lurks around complaining about the dearth of milk. Juliette thinks any publcity is good publicity and at least she looks good.

Scarlett tells Avery she hasn't heard anything from anyone about the songs she and Gunnar recorded. He tells her not to worry. They start making out and Gunnar shows up.He tells her they got a publishing deal, they're both excited, Avery tries to be excited too.

Later that night Teddy thanks her for offering her services to sing at his fundraiser. He reassures her that things are going fine. She mentions Tandy told her about the polling. He says there's a huge margin of error. She wants more info. He says he's just trying to spare her.She also points out that she can sing anywhere. She clearly hates the country club.

Juliette is beginning to get worried as she watches Katie Couric report on her shoplifting incident on her talk show. (Nice bit of cross-promotion that.) Her mother enters with bags of nail polish wondering why she has to steal. She asks Glen to do something about her mother, like send her away. She has to stay with Juliette until her hearing.. in seven weeks. She doesn't think she can do it and tries to make a break for it with her assistant but the paparazzi await her at the gates.

McKenna arrives as Juliette does yoga. She wants to get a statement out immediately. Juliette doesn't want to. McKenna says they need to get ahead of it or else the fallout will be huge. She says they've scheduled an interview with ""Good Morning America."" Juliette doesn't want to do interviews or release statements. She wants to do yoga and prep for her tour.

Bucky calls Deacon and asks him to play Rayna's fundraiser gig for Teddy. He says he'll be there. He's actually having a meeting with Coleman, who is his AA sponsor. Coleman notes it's hard to say no to that family but he finally did.

The publisher Jeannie shows Gunnar and Scarlett around the offices and the gold and platinum plaques of those who have had publishing deals just like theirs. She also shows them the writing rooms, patio, and kitchen. Gunnar meet Hayley, the publisher's assistant. She loves his demo. He introduces Scarlett. He makes a point to say that he is single.

Bucky and Rayna go over the fundraising gig. She says to go with the whole band. She figures they'll need to replace Deacon since he probably won't want to deal with the whole country club/Lamar/Teddy scene. But Bucky informs her that Deacon is already in. She's surprised by that and says if he can deal so can she.

Juliette is doing a wardrobe fitting and she hates it and thinks she looks like a hillbilly. Of course, her mother likes it. She goes to Glenn who has bad news: the executive producer of the CMAs has said she can still attend but is no longer a presenter. He points out that she's also the butt of jokes by all the late night comics and ""SNL:"" He says she may not want to hear it but as quickly as she came up that's as fast as she can disappear. McKenna agrees calling it a make or break moment. She says she has one shot to get it right and be the person the world thinks she is. She tells them she'll do ""GMA.""

Jeannie takes Gunnar, Scarlett, Hayley, and Avery to dinner to celebrate their new deal. Gunnar tells how he came to Nashville from Austin. She says came to be with Avery and the songwriting thing was by accident. She loves it and talks about how much joy she derives from finding just the right words and images and how they can be both specific and universal. Avery bristles and she says she doesn't want to go on and on about herself since she's just starting out. But Jeannie points out that she's better than a lot of people who have been doing it much longer. Gunnar points out that Deacon is her uncle. She says she's learned more from Avery who is a great songwriter who plays out a lot. The publisher is tepid in response. We learn Hayley is from Colorado.

Rayna meets with the fundraising host committee which is full of old, familiar faces including a woman named Peggy, who used to date Teddy, but is now married.

At the end of dinner Hayley calls for another round but Avery wants to call it a night. He's mad that she mentioned his music and calls what she said ""writing process crap."" He decides to walk home.

At home Rayna teased Teddy about Peggy, she thinks Peggy still has the hots for Teddy. She gripes about the country club people. He says those are her people. She says not anymore and they're more her daddy's people and they're Teddy's people now. She vulnerably says she feels like every woman in there would make a better politician's wife than her. He says that's not why he married her. She asks why he did. He says because she dazzled him and always has. She tells him she loves him.

Juliette's mom tries to feed her her favorite macaroni from childhood to prep for her big interview.Juliette says she doesn't eat that crap and reads her the riot act about trying to be a good mother all of a sudden when she's just looking to steal from her o buy drugs. She grabs her moter's bag and upends it and all she finds is a picture of them. She begins to weep.

We cut to Gunnar and Hayley waking up in bed. This one isn't a dream. She wonders on a scale from 1-10 how awkward it will be at work. He says he plans to make it very awkward. She says there's no pressure to make it more than it is. He jokingly says if he didn't have proof to the contrary he'd accuse her of being a dude. They kiss and she gets up. He lays back with a smile. Scarlett pulls up just as Hayley and Gunnar walk out of her place.

McKenna tells Juliette that the interview will be with Robin Roberts with whom they have a great relationship and tries to prep her on the potential question: Why steal when you have money? What kind of example does this set for your young fans? She'll bring up other celebs with similar scandals like Winona or Lindsay. She freaks and says she didn't rob Saks or get three DUIs, it was a bottle of nail polish. McKenna tells her not to do that on camera. She is flabbergasted she can't defend herself. McKenna says nope, she's gotta protect the brand and stay on message pointing out she spent a lot of time hiding where she came from and shouldn't expose it now. She tells her ot be honest and take responsibility. Juliette says she gets it.

Scarlett meets with Deacon and tells her she's confused. She admits she feels guilty she got a deal without even really trying and that she knows it upsets Avery, who she came to Nashville to support. Deacon admits he's not the best at giving advice but says it's hard to be the one struggling to catch up but there's not much she can do: Avery will either keep up or get left behind.

Rayna is nervously prepping for the show. She wants to hold a cigarette. She wonders where Deacon is. Bucky is surprised she's nervous saying these are her people. She says they are not her people and that they were all the people who mocked her in high school for liking country music. He says they all graduated and now she's a big star so, there you have it. She asks him to go get a cigarette for her to hold.

Juliette sits down via satellite with Robin Roberts. Robin brings up Lindsay and Winona and asks why a rich person shoplifts. Juliettte claims people are jealous of her fame and money and it was all a misunderstanding. She put the nail polish in her purse because she didn't want it to fall through the basket and then she forgot to pay because she was distracted by fans tailing her. Robin is incredulous and her team behind the camera is beyond annoyed. Juliette says people aren't only waiting for you to fall they're trying to cause it. Robin changes tack and brings up Juiette's mother's arrest. Juliette rips of her microphone saying the interview is over.

Deacon finally arrives at the country club. Lamar gives him a hard time about being late and underdressed. He points out that he's only doing this as a favor to Rayna. Lamar claims he should be more grateful to the family that's carried him on its back for 20 years. Deacon says he's got him confused with Teddy and that he won't be kissing Lamar's ass since that's Teddy's job. Teddy interjects angrily that he didn't even ask him to do it. Rayna tries to get between their bickering. Deacon zings he won't be voting for Teddy and that he's just a puppet for Lamar. Teddy counters that what Deacon knows about politics couldn't even fill a shot glass. They start getting chesty and Rayna continues to try and make peace.

At Barnes HQ the team is freaking that GMA is already teasing the interview and Juliette's walkout. Glenn tells Juliette that sponsors are bailing and that means for now her tour is off.

Lamar talks up Teddy from the stage as Peggy looks on wistfully. Then Lamar introduces Rayna and her band. She lights into a rocking midtempo number. The country club politely claps along. Teddy looks over at Peggy meaningfully. She looks back. He shakes his head at her. Teddy glares at Deacon and then gladhands some supporters. Deacon eyes Teddy rigt back with a sly smile. The song ends and Teddy walks out.

Post-show Deacon says he doesn't know what that ""Teddy stuff"" was. She says it was him taking the bait and says she doesn't know what he was thinking and can't believe he put ""us"" in this situation. He asks which ""us"" and says he thought she needed him. She tearfully says ""I do need you."" He says he doesn't know what to do with that kind of response anymore. She says she doesn't either but now she has to go home. He asks if they're done here. She says ""yeah, we're done"" with some real finality.

Teddy enters their bedroom at home. Rayna's already sitting on the bed. They are silent for a moment and then he says ""I can't deal with it anymore. I'm your husband."" She says she knows and that she's firing Deacon.

Avery arrives home with a terse ""hey"" for a greeting. Scarlett says she knows he doesn't want to talk about it but they need to. She says she doesn't want to feel bad about the deal and she wants him to support her like she supports him. He says he's trying but walks away.

Later at the publishing house, Gunnar has stocked the fridge with yogurt for Hailey. They do cutesy banter in the kitchen.

Teddy meets up with Peggy in a parking lot. She looks stricken. She says ""this is torture, at the club last night I felt sick."" He apologizes and says it's the campaign and that they've been digging into his past. Peggy says someone is going to find out. He says he's hoping to avoid that. She says she hasn't told anyone and that they've kept this secret a long time and maybe it's time to come clean on their own terms. He says what they did was stupid but his campaign and their marriages depend on them keeping the secret. (Did they kill somebody? They're not actually saying ""affair."")

Glenn comes to Juliette and says they need to talk. Basically he quits her. He says his job is to give the best advice he can and whatever problems she had before, the interview made them exponentially worse. She says she knows. She starts to cry and begs him not to leave and says she wants her image and tour back and will do whatever it takes and she'll listen to him. She promises. He says if she wants him to stay he needs an honest answer on why she shoplifted. She said she did it when she was a kid, it made her feel like she could take care of herself when nobody else would. He tells her from now on she needs to listen and tomorrow they'll regroup and tells her to call a friend to get her mind off it. She says she doesn't have friends. She has people who want to be seen with her. Or used to anyway. She head to the kitchen and eats the macaroni her mother made. She calls Deacon and admits she's not alright. He asks if she's doing anything right now. She's not."

We open on Juliette recording in the studio, an uptempo hand-clapper singing about yelling from the rooftops. Deacon is playing guitar with her band. Her producer Randy doesn't look happy.

Outside the studio her publicist brings Glenn some coffee and says they need to put out a release noting Juliette's back in the studio. Deacon comes out to get Juliette's coffee. Apparently the session has been endless because Juliette doesn't want to go home. Glenn tells Deacon that the problem is her mom who is staying with her until her sentencing hearing or if she goes to rehab. Deacon surmies rehab has been a non-starter.

Back in studio Randy says they are getting diminishing returns and there have been perfect takes. Juliette says she''ll tell him when they have a perfect take. Deacon tries to talk to her about her mother. With his history of addiction he says he can help her. She just wants to stay out her way. Deacon pushes. Seh decides she's done and leaves. Deacon asks where she's going. She says doesn't know.

Across town Rayna's trying on dress for a commercial shoot. Joe likes it and wants her to wear it on the cover of her greatest hits album. She says she doesn't want to make a hits compilation til she's old. He points out that this label head Marshall Evans' peace offering. She appreciates that but wants to make a new, original, great album. Teddy calls, he's on his way to debate Coleman. She offers to come. He tells her not to. They exchange I love yous. As Joe leaves Rayna reminds him she needs a new collaborator and a new guitar player.

Teddy meets Peggy. She's nervous about going to prison. It has to do with the audit of the credit union. Apparently, they ""borrowed"" over two million dollars. Teddy points out that they returned it. She says it's still embezzlement and if they go to Feds now they might be able to cut a deal. He says no and asks for a day to figure it out. She says she's scared. He says she'll be fine.

Rayna shoots the commercial lip-synching a song, maybe called ""American Beauty.' She shimmers and shimmies in a red dress. Bucky returns, they have a problem. Deacon's lawyer called to say he doesn't like the tweak to the first verse to make it work for the commercial. Bucky tells her to call him. She says that's what he wants.

At the publishing house Hayley tells Gunnar she doesn't want to get into the middle of anything with him and Scarlett. He says there's nothing to get in the middle of. Scarlett has a boyfriend and he has her. She says she wants to keep it uncomplicated. Scarlett arrives with Jeannie to announce that they've got a private audience for Lady Antebellum's producer Paul Worley the next day to hear some of their song. Jeannie wants to add another guitar to round their sound out.

Juliette goes home to her too quiet house. She calls out to her mother whom she can't find. She and her bodyguard find her mother passed out in bed with a skanky dude and with bottles of booze and pills strewn about. Juliette kicks the skanky dude out. Her mother follows her out in her underwear asking why she's so mean to her. Juliette calls her embarrassing and to back her up people on the street are stopping and gawking. Her mother retorts she's not the one who stole a bottle of nail polish ""and you call me pathetic."" (Um, yeah.)

At the Coleman-Teddy debate, Teddy does boilerplate ""new Nashville"" stuff. Coleman points out that Teddy is classic ""old Nashville""and goes back in a long line of old money and even though he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he's dug himself a financial hole he might never got out of. (Apparently his dad had similar problems.) He brings up the baseball stadium that he says will drain the city of money. He says the only thing Teddy has ever done is inherit money and lose it. (Wow, ouch, Coleman don't play.) He says Nashville deserves better than that.

Back at the Barnes house Juliette apologizes to Bo her bodyguard. He says family is complicated. Juliette says she's tried ot get her clean 100 times but it never works. Bo says maybe it's time for outside help. Seh calls Deacon.

Avery comes home to Scarlett on the phone to her mom talking about the next day's guitar pull. She's making him dinner. He notes she's really excited. He offers up his services as her extra guitar player. She doubts his sincerity but says having him there would help her nerves. He says yes. They make out in a way that suggests they'll be skipping dinner.

Deacon comes home and Rayna is waiting for him. She asks him about the commercial. He asks her about changing the words and how it ruins the song. She says he knows she doesn't want to do this but she needs the money for her family. He says music's all he's got and it means something to him. She says it means something to her too and that's why she's trying to figure out how to afford to keep playing it. He points out he didn't cancel the tour. She says he knows why she canceled it. So now he figure she's selling songs to the highest bidder. She thinks it's ironic that he doesn't want his song in a commerical but it doesn't offend his sensibilities to play with Juliette. This touches a nerve. They argue more. She asks him to sign the release. He says no. She asks if this is how he wants to do this. She says 'nice to see you Deacon.' He replies in kind.

Rayna has lunch by the river with Bucky. He says all the writers want to work with her but the good ones have commitments. She muses that maybe she write herself, to prove to herself she can and not be beholden to other people.

Teddy goes to Lamar and tells the truth about the ""busted real estate deal."" He says he ran out of capital waiting for the permits, the markets crashed, the bills piled up so he ""protected my investors"" by embezzling cash. Peggy found the money and he didn't ask questions. Lamar wonders why. Teddy suspects that Peggy wanted ""more"" from their relationship but that was strictly on her end. Lamar says Teddy should've come to him. Teddy thought he had it under control. So Peggy buried it until they paid it back but she's scared by the audit. Lamar says he'll make sure Peggy feels safe and to keep his head in the campaign. Lamar tells him that he is not going to be his father.

Juliette brings Deacon to meet Jolene. Deacon tries to talk to her. Jolene denies, denies, denies. Deacon says he just wants to talk.

Over at the guitar pull Scarlett and Gunnar, with Avery's help sing their song for Paul Worley. They make eyes at each other as they sing ""loving you is the only way..."" Avery even sings a nice back up vocal. But then he also plays a showy lead guitar bit over the final verse. The producer compliments Avery.

Deacon talks about everybody needing a little help and if she could do it on her own she probably would've done that by now. Juliette snarks in a corner and Deacon sends her off. He says he doesn't know what will happen if she gets clean but he knows what will happen if she doesn't. He says he knows a good place and her daughter needs her clean. Jolene cries and agrees to get help.

Gunnar is about to confront Avery about his stunt but Avery says ""you're welcome"" implying he's owed a thank you for helping them out. Avery complains they were ""making eyes"" at each other. Gunnar says it was acting to sell a love song. Hayley watches this from the door as Avery said it was pretty damn good acting. Hayley clears her throat and Gunnar says he doesn't need this and stalks off. Scarlett is in the hallway and she overheard. Avery just walks by her.

Bo, Juliette, Deacon, and Jolene arrive at the rehab. She tries to beg off. Deacon gets her out and grabs the pills that fall out of her purse. She starts to waffle as they walk towards the door. She turns to Juliette, slaps her and says ""you can not force me to do this."" Jolene turns around and heads back to the rehab. Deacon follws her in.

Later, Deacon and Juliette debrief on his front stoop. He reassures her that she's done all she can. He asks if Jolene was always abusive. She says once in a while. He puts his hand on her arm. She tries to kiss him. He stops her. She says she's just trying to say thank you. He says she could just actually say, you know, thank you. She says she never thought of anyone like that. This makes him sad. She says everybody she knows just wants something from her. He says not everybody wants something from her, and if she does maybe she needs to spend more time alone. She says he sounds like a shrink she went to once. Once. He offers more help, she says she'll be fine.

Gunnar and Scarlett pick up their paychecks at the Bluebird. She says she wants to clear up that there's nothing between them, she's with Avery. He says he's with Hayley. At that moment, Hayley texts. She's heard back from Paul.

Teddy heads home and finds Rayna up late, 2:30 a.m. He says he's trying to turn things around.She asks if he wants to talk about it. He doesn't. He asks her what she's working on. She says she's writing a song, by herself for a change. He says he'll leave her to it. She looks at him funny as he walks out. He asks what happened between her and Deacon, why did they cancel the tour? Did she sleep with him? She says no and wonders if he really thinks she'd do that. He asks if she wanted to. She says they have to put the past behind them. He says he's trying to.

Deacon meets with Coleman in a diner in his sponsor capacity saying how hard it was to go back to that rehab, the sights, smells. He apologizes to Coleman for having been the one to drag him there all those years ago. Coleman points out it was Rayna who was the one who saved his life. Coleman says he's holding on to something and it's time to let it go. He puts Jolene's pills on the table and exhales. He says he counted the pills over and over all night. He leaves. Coleman asks where he's going. He says he doesn't know.

On an dark road Lamar meets with Peggy and says he can help her and make sure her audit interview never happens. Lamar tells her he needs one thing from her: stay calm, tell no one. He quietly scares her into silence.

At the Bluebird Deacon plays a midtemp ballad called ""Sideshow"" about an alluring woman. A heckler asks where Rayna is saying he likes it better when she sings. Deacon says most people do.

At Juliette's house she wants to move out, leave everything and just go, leave it all in her rearview mirror like Deacon counseled.

Scarlett comes home pissed. The producer loved the song but the back up guitarist hijacked it. She says it wasn't his big shot it was their and he screwed it up because he's so jealous. She says she told Gunnar that she chooses him and that she doesn't know when Avery is going to start believing it himself and stop making her prove it all the time. He's got no comeback other than a not very sincere apology. She says she doesn't want to be a couple that fights all the time. He says he wants them to be the couple they've always been. She says in that couple she's a woman who writes poems and keeps them to herself.

Outside the Bluebird the heckler tries to apologize and Deacon punches him. They throw down.

In the middle of the night, Rayna's phone rings on her night stand. It's Deacon making a collect call from jail. She is offered to press one to accept and two decline. Rayna declines. Teddy wakes up and asks who it was. She says ""nobody.""

The next day at the publishing house Gunnar tells Hayley he want to go legit, make it all complicated with feelings and stuff. She asks how complicated? They start making out right there in the hallway.

Deacon walks out of jail with a new shiner. Juliette is there to pick him up. He thanks her. She says that's one that friends do, bail each other out.

Lamar and Teddy look at negative ads. Teddy says if they do this Rayna will flip and Coleman will release the hounds. Lamar says if they don't he'll lose. He asks Teddy if he wants to win. Teddy says he does.

In the studio, Bucky tells Rayna he loves her demo of her self-penned song. She is thrilled and tells him to tell Marshall Evans they have the first tune for her next album.

Deacon calls Bucky and leaves a message letting him know that they can use the song for the commercial. He says he's letting it go.

Juliette walks into her new house. It's beautiful. It has an infinity pool. She looks happy about it.

Peggy and Teddy meet again. She says Lamar is a genius and the auditors are gone. Teddy says everything is going to be fine. As they exhale a photographer in a nearby car snaps photos of their clandestine meeting."

Things are on simmer tonight in Music City in four separate storylines.

First up is Juliette. It's been a few weeks since the shoplifting/mama in rehab story and McKenna has been rehabbing Juliette's image by keeping her on a short leash doing cute things like zoo photo ops with choirboy quarterbacks. She then decides Juliette should go on a date with said quarterback Sean, a rookie in the NFL. Even though Juliette is determined to sabotage it by complaining about his lack of pass completion and calling audibles, he points out that just because it's a set-up doesn't mean they can't get to know each other and be pleasant. They start to hit it off and Juliette basically dares him to let her whisk him away for some fun on her private jet. On said jet we learn he's never been drunk and that he's a big fan who knows her songs so well he can pick up the guitar sitting there and start plucking ""Telescope"" and singing it. They harmonize a bit and she's impressed. They arrive at a hot club in Miami and get their groove on. As they are leaving an aggressive paparazzo shouting insults about Juliette's mom raises Sean's ire and he pushes him. This, of course, results in some angry photos of Sean that would be damaging to his career. Juliette goes to the trouble of buying off the paparazzo- $25,000 for the shot and says she'll call him the next 10 times she goes out in Miami. Sold. Sean comes to visit her to say thanks and also to ask her out, or in that is, since he doesn't party. She is perplexed at this concept: a boy who likes her for who she is, wanting to legitimately hang out with her, and wanting to stay in, but she smiles and says yes.

Next up, Rayna and Bucky are so cheered by her new, self-penned tune that they want to dive into recording her new album. They bring Marshall Evans into the studio and he grudgingly admits that the song is good and gives her the go-ahead to record. She says she doesn't want to use Randy as a producer this time since she's looking to mix things up. He tells her to pick from the label-approved list of producers and they're in business. Of course, Rayna doesn't want to do this. She wants to work with rebel rock star Liam McGinnis who just relocated to Nashville and likes to do things his own way. Bucky gets her a meeting but this amounts to the two of them going over there, Liam telling her that he has nothing in common with a woman who makes pop country for moms in their SUVs and slamming the door in her face. Rayna, not one to take no for an answer, goes back the next day and basically butters him up, talking about how raw and awesome some live concert he did in Belfast was and that even though she's a mom who drives an SUV she's a songwriter with something to say and hands him the demo of her new song. He invites her in and they get to talking. Then they get to drinking. Then they get to playing. And then Rayna apparently gets to taking a cab home. With a headache and a dim memory she heads back to Liam's and asks what happened. He shows her video they shot of her swilling whiskey and singing a new version of her song that Liam produced. They both pronounce it awesome. When Rayna plays it for Marshall, however, he likes it but doesn't want her to work with Liam. She says she's just trying to make her music. He wonders why she wants to fight. She points out that she doesn't WANT to fight but she has to do what she believes in and that any label in town would likely buy out her contract. She says this is her new sound and he needs to get on board.

Meanwhile, across town, Avery and his band have drawn the interest of two people, promoter/talent scout Reed Olson and manager Marilyn Rhodes. Both come out to the 5 Spot to hear the band. Avery is hoping that Reed-- who books local openers for national touring acts that come through town-- will give them the slot with the Lumineers. Reed clearly liked them but is noncommittal, shaking Avery's hand and leaving.That's when Marilyn oozes down the bar and says Reed doesn't like anything until 10 people tell him to like it. But she, on the other hand, thinks Avery's band is great, will put in a good word with Reed for the booking and wants him to come over to talk about her managing the band. Avery, who is standing with Scarlett when this happens, is thrilled at this turn of events and the two hug. The next day Avery delivers a casserole from Scarlett to Deacon. Deacon points out he was in jail for a few hours not on his deathbed. Avery asks if Deacon knows Reed and Marilyn. He does. He says he'll put in a word with Reed but to stay away from Marilyn who is bad news. He knows. We see him run into her at the Bluebird later and learn she tried to sign him when he was younger and they have a skeevy exchange where she says she could've made him a star instead of the guy who stands behind Rayna and he says he wasn't willing to pay the ""price."" Gunnar overhears all of this and the next day relays it to Scarlett, just as Avery is meeting with Marilyn. Marilyn puts the moves on Avery and he gets as far as making out with her before he puts a stop to it and heads home. There he finds Scarlett packing a bag. He points out that he didn't actually cheat on her. She points out that he went over there planning to so doesn't get credit for not doing it. She shows up on Deacon's doorstep forlorn but resolute. He takes her in and apologizes for the mess that this became.

Speaking of messes, Lamar is about to make a big one. Tandy and Lamar inform Teddy that he's down in the polls and they have a plan. Teddy and Coleman are set to sign a ""clean campaign"" pledge in which they promise no dirty tricks. So, of course, Lamar wants to play a dirty trick. He will have Lamar stopped in a ""routine"" traffic violation so he will be late to the signing and Teddy can badmouth him in front of the press. Teddy reminds Lamar that he doesn't want to hurt Coleman. Lamar reminds Teddy that he said he would do what it took to become mayor and promises just a traffic stop. One problem, when the cops stops Coleman they find the bottle of Oxycontin Deacon gave him that he took from Juliette's mom. And he is arrested. (When Rayna sees this on the news after waking up with her hangover she asks Teddy what Lamar has done and he lies and says nothing.) Coleman holds a press conference where he explains that he has been sober for 19 years and that in his role as a sponsor he took the drugs off the hands of one of the people he counsels and says a drug test will prove he is clean. Later, Deacon goes to him and apologizes for his role in the mess and offers to come forward. Coleman says the whole point of the program is that it's anonymous and that it's his own fault for not throwing the pills out and that he will take care of it. Later, a private detective comes to Coleman with the incriminating photos of Teddy and Peggy. He shows the photos to his wife, agonizing over what to do, saying if he releases them it will ruin Teddy and Rayna's marriage. Audrey, his wife says that Coleman owes those people nothing. Besides which, Teddy isn't fit to be mayor and that sometimes you have to do a little wrong for the greater good."

She again shoots it down and to boot decides she wants to close the upcoming Edgehill Records 25th anniversary show at the Ryman with one of her new tunes. Bucky's not sure about it but Rayna is.

Meanwhile, Juliette's getting hot and heavy by her pool with her quarterback. But Glenn arrives with bad news. Although her approval ratings post-shoplifting are going up since she entered into this no-longer-a-fauxmance, Sean's are going down since he hasn't been playing well. She dismisses football nuts. Glenn also says Marshall wants to meet with her. She wonders if he's a football fan too.

Avery is hanging out with his new cougar manager in front of hot club where she has booked them for a showcase for the media and industry pros including a label head named Domino Wells. He mopes about Scarlett not being there and cougar manager tells him to put her on the guest list.

Juliette and Glenn meet with Marshall who informs them that she's only doing one song. She goes ballistic saying she's gone multiplatinum for them twice in three years. He says she's great and all but her current public image is crap and they need to manage their exposure. Additionally, he wants her to do a duet with Rayna to help her enjoy a little reflected respect. She is not pleased.

At the Jaymes household they're getting ready for movie night. She reports in about the new songs and Marshall. Teddy says his numbers are way up. All is well until Coleman calls requesting a meeting right now.

Deacon's singing another sad song at the Bluebird and it's getting to a weepy Scarlett. Gunnar abandons Hayley to comfort her. This is not lost on Hayley. Gunnar tells Scarlett to channel her sadness into songwriting. She worries she made a big mistake since Avery says he didn't sleep with the woman.

Teddy is hoping this means that Coleman is dropping out since his numbers down are since the arrest. But, of course, it's about the pictures Coleman had taken of him and Peggy. Teddy is flabbergasted and says he hasn't had an affair.Coleman says he believes him but that he doesn't think anyone else will and Teddy has unitl the weekend to announce he's dropping out or Coleman releases the pictures to the media.

Back at her house Juliette fumes about the duet but Glenn points out it's actually a great opportunity. Juliette says she doesn't need to be taken under anyone's wing and she's gotten what she's gotten on her own. If she turns it down he points out not only will she not have a tour but she'll be missing out on the biggest musical event of the year.

Teddy meets with Tandy and Lamar and they advise him, since he didn't do anything wrong, to get out in front of it and come clean. Lamar says to tell as much of the truth as he needs to. Teddy worries that Coleman will dig further and uncover the credit union scandal. Lamar says that trail has been wiped clean. They tell him to get rid of Peggy.

At Deacon's Scarlett is busying herself with cleaning and driving Deacon crazy. He tells her she can't mope around and needs to get out and puts them on the list for the Edgehill show. She asks if it's going to be hard for him to be the house bandleader and play behind Rayna since he quit her band. He says no and clarifies he was fired, he didn't quit.

Rayna heads to the Ryman with Liam to rehearse. Marshall Evans shows up and drops the Juliette bomb. Like Juliette, Rayna is not pleased. He says it's not a request. She says she doesn't take orders. He says if she doesn't do it he's going to release the greatest hits album.

She and Liam discuss it back at the studio and he says, say what you will about Juliette, but she knows how to play the game. So Rayna calls Bucky and tells him to tell Marshall she'll do it on the condition that he owes her and that they'll release a greatest hits album when she wants to and her next album will be her own music produced by Liam.

Juliette stands on the Ryman stage and looks out at the empty seats. Deacon congratulates her on getting her first crack at the stage and tells her she can do it and this place is the place to prove she's no flash in the pan. He reassures her, she replies she knows she can.

Hayley heads over to see Scarlett. She tarts her up and takes her out drinking and dancing theorizing that the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. The night does not go exactly as planned. No sooner has a tarted up Scarlett downed her first tequila shot and she's whirling around on the dance floor with some random dude, jumping onstage with the band to sing ""Ring of Fire,"" and basically driving Gunnar crazy with lust and jealousy. When the dance floor guy kisses her Gunnar breaks it up and basically slut shames her. Hayley is not happy. Scarlett is not happy. Gunnar is not happy. Dance floor guy is not happy.

Liam and Rayna meet up at the Ryman with Deacon and Juliette to hash out a song. It does not go well. They fight about just about everything and snipe at each other, right up until Rayna basically calls her talentless and says she hasn't earned anything and everyone knows. Juliette stalks off. Liam observes that Juliette needs to get laid. Rayna says ""that's so not her problem."" Deacon blows up at Rayna for going too far, pulls out a CD demo of ""Undermine"" and says he wrote the first verse and Juliette wrote the rest and if Rayna listens to it she won't be able to say Juliette has no talent.

Teddy calls Peggy and tells her they can't be seen together anymore. She takes it hard but understands and confirms that nothing was going on between them.

All keyed up, Juliette calls Sean over. They start going at it on the couch but when it's starts getting hot he throws cold water on it and says he's not into casual sex. She's aghast and says that he was clearly in it for the publicity and then wonders if he's gay and needed a beard. She kicks him out before he can really say anything else.

Later, Rayna shows up at her door. She says they both need to suck it up and get this done. Since they can't agree on a song, Rayna proposes they write one. They stay up all night bickering but they get it done and show up at the rehearsal the next day with a finished song.

Scarlett heads over to Avery's to try and make up and is then confronted with the sight of Marilyn in her bra in Avery's bedroom. Avery protests he only started sleeping with her after Scarlett dumped him and he doesn't love her. Scarlett flees.

Teddy meets again with Lamar who has a new plan: make the drug charges stick to Coleman. Even though he promised they would be dropped and Teddy protests that everyone knows that Coleman has 20 years sober and is a sponsor, Lamar says a call needed to be made. He says Coleman can fight the charges in court and will probably will but that will be long after the election is over.

It's the night of the big show. Marilyn introduces Avery to Domino Wells (played by musician Wyclef Jean) who tells Avery to come up to Atlanta to see him. Scarlett can see him right there in the halls of the Ryman and is not happy. She goes to Gunnar and they both basically apologize and she says she wants to schedule a writing session. She says if she's going to lose someone in her life she's glad it's not him.

Backstage in her dressing room, Juliette asks for a little peace and quiet. Then comes a knock at the door. It's Sean, with roses, an apology and an entreaty to get to know her better because he doesn't want to have sex outside of marriage. She says if he got to know her better he wouldn't like her very much. He says it's too late. They kiss, he promises he's not gay.

In Rayna's dressing room the girls hug their mom before she hits the stage. She asks Teddy if he's okay. He says they can talk about it later, wishes her luck, and tells he loves her.

As Buddy Miller plays on the stage Rayna and Juliette wait to go on. Marshall introduces Rayna, who in turn introduces Juliette. They rock the new song they wrote and it's pretty great. The title seems to be ""The Wrong Song"" and it's a real rave-up about a ""liar and a cheater."" Teddy looks nervous and guilty at the side of the stage. Rayna and Juliette sound great. And Liam and Deacon team up on guitar during the solo. It gets a rapturous response and Marshall leans over to Bucky and says it's going to be a huge hit."

There was a lot going down in Music City tonight.

First up, Juliette met Sean's family. At first everything seemed hunky dory. Juliette won over Sean's little sister by singing in the church choir with her and giving her a pair of coveted boots from a video shoot. Then she was invited over for Sunday dinner. Things took a sour turn, however, when Sean's mother essentially told her not to hold her breath for becoming part of the Butler clan since they don't imagine welcoming the daughter of a drug addict and a known shoplifter with open arms. Plus, Sean still won't have sex with her until he's married. So what's Juliette to do? Why she proposes to Sean of course.

Meanwhile, Deacon delivers a letter to Juliette from her mom from rehab which upsets her. She lets him know that she understands how important family is since she never had one, regaling him with sad tales of having to eat dry pancake batter since all the family money went up mom's nose and her first kiss? Came courtesy of one of her mom's creepy boyfriend's. She unceremoniously ushers Deacon out. Deacon himself had a choice to make. At the top of the episode some old buddies blew into town, a rock band he used to run with called the Revel Kings. Apparently, they've all gotten sober and they want Deacon to re-up and hit the road with them, first as a contracted player and, if all goes well, as a member of the band. Both Rayna and Juliette urge him to take this opportunity since the band is apparently a big deal. He decides to take their advice and agrees to sign on.

But, what will Rayna and Juliette do without him? Their label head Marshall Evans is so buoyed by the success of the pair's hit single-- released as a live track from the anniversary show and climbing the charts-- that he proposes the duo hit the road on a true co-headlining arena tour asap. Rayna doesn't immediately shoot down the idea but Juliette has yet to be asked.

Rayna, meanwhile, has bigger fish to fry than potential touring partners. After the triumphant Grand Ole Opry show with Juliette, Teddy dropped the bomb of the Peggy photos and Coleman's intention to release them and make it look like he's stepping out on Rayna. He swears he didn't sleep with her and at first Rayna seems convinced. But then she goes to Coleman to ask him why he wants to drag her family, especially her young daughters, through the mud and he shows her the photos. He says he'd like to believe Teddy too but the pictures make it hard. Rayna goes to speak to Peggy and arrives just in time to see her being wheeled into an ambulance after a suicide attempt. (She had told her husband and he didn't believe her. She went to Teddy and he blew her off.) Rayna goes back to Teddy and says people don't try to kill themselves over nothing. He spills the beans about the embezzlement and she is flabbergasted, essentially calling him a criminal (which he is) and saying she can't trust him anymore. She goes to Tandy livid that she didn't tell her since she knew. Tandy reassures her that the team is taking care of it. Rayna goes to this ""strategy"" meeting and lashes out at everyone. In the end though, her daughters' well-being is paramount so she shows up at Teddy's press conference after the photos leak and stands by her man. He embraces her and thanks her and she whispers she's doing it only for the girls.

Over in Scarlett-Gunnar-Hayley-ville, Hayley gives Scarlett the name of a band looking for a female singer in the wake of her impromptu show while she was drinking. Gunnar is annoyed by this since he and Scarlett are beginning to cook with the writing thing. Hayley says that the real problem is that Gunnar has a thing for Scarlett and this is why they never should've gotten involved and breaks up with him. This frees up Gunnar to go to the Bluebird and plant one on a confused Scarlett, who later says she wants to take a break from writing with him. That is until Jeannie announces that one of the duo's songs, ""Fade Into You,"" has officially been put on hold by an artist and breaks out the champagne.

That's not the evening's only champagne and potential split. Domino Wells has returned to see Avery and his band play. He invited Avery to come to Atlanta and talk about making music. Before he goes, Avery swings by Deacon's and hands her a bottle of champagne. We learn that it was originally intended for them to drink when he got his big break. He admits that they should've opened it when Scarlett got her deal and since this is his first big break he wants her to have it. She wishes him luck in Atlanta. On the way to Atlanta Domino drops his bomb on Avery: he wants him, not his band, some of whom he's been with for years. At first he wants to protest but Marilyn tells him not to end his career before it's even started."

Even though ""Wrong Song"" is number one and Edgehill is throwing Rayna and Juliette a party to celebrate, everyone is angry.

Juliette is angry for numerous reasons. First, she's mad that Rayna and Liam basically ignore her onstage and flirt with each other when they're all performing together. Then she's mad that she has to give them a ride back to Nashville on her plane. Then she's mad that Liam ate her bean dip. And then her assistant lets slip that she thought they were going back for Juliette's mom's court hearing.

She later is angry at her mother's hearing when she's asked to testify on her mother's behalf. Deacon tells her to ""speak from the heart"" and she can only muster a few words about her being glad her mother's getting help. Her mother's charges are not dropped and she has to go back to rehab but she's free for the night so Deacon invites her to Juliette and Rayna's party. Juliette is then mad at the party when Rayna's picture is bigger than hers on a poster and she feels like her mother is embarrassing her. Then she is mad at Deacon for bailing on babysitting his mother at the party like he promised.

Deacon is angry because Tremolo magazine and that reporter Carmen end up writing a story quoting the sleazy lead singer Cy saying they fired Deacon because he fell off the wagon. Deacon reams her out and tells the truth about Cy hitting on Scarlett and points out that he's been sober 12 years.

Deacon is then angry at Rayna when she comes to check on him and he unleashes on her again for marrying Teddy while he was in rehab and not waiting for him. She is angry at this saying she had no idea that rehab trip number 5 was going to stick and it was untenable with him. He knows she's right but is hurt and essentially tells her to buzz off.

Later, when an angry Juliette tracks him down to yell at him about her mom. In his wrecked house, a sober but dry drunk Deacon admits that he tells people he got sober for himself but really he got sober for Rayna and was always hoping he'd take her back. He now knows she won't, not after their fight earlier that day. Juliette tries to convince him to join her band and get back to doing what he loves but he demurs.

Rayna isn't angry at first. She happily flirts with Liam onstage. Joyfully needles Juliette on the plane. Is flattered when a record exec named Calista comes and flatters her and tries to woo her away from Edgehill saying it would be the perfect meeting of artist and visionary record exec. Liam also tries to help woo her to the label since he knows Calista. But then Rayna gets angry too. First when Deacon is so mean to her. And then at the party when she learns from her Edgehill label boss Marshall that the only reason Liam was pushing her to do the deal with Calista is because she offered him a side deal of his own label. Liam, who was also making douchey comments about her marriage to Teddy, basically admits this is true but says it's clear theirs is a real partnership and she can't walk away from it. She angrily does, telling him the partnership is dissolved.

Teddy is angry because he doesn't know where he and Rayna stand and is worried that she's cheating on him with Liam after seeing the freak out at the party. They have a heart to heart.She says she's not cheating but is still angry with him. He apologizes again for his lies and misdeeds. He talks about how when he found her after Deacon ""wrecked"" her and she said she just wanted a solid guy he tried to be that. And when things started to fall apart he did the wrong thing for the right reason: to keep being the guy she needed. He muses she did the same thing in picking him over Deacon.

Avery is angry, mostly at Marilyn, because she keeps saying she's going to introduce him to people at the party but doesn't. He then is angry when Juliette, distracted by her mom, doesn't recognize him or know his song

Gunnar is angry at his brother for pawning his guitar and being a fugitive from the law, forcing him to law to law enforcement officials. He's then angry at Scarlett when she suggests he talk about it and also suggests teaming up with Avery's old band members to form a new group.

Gunnar stops being angry when his brother surreptitiously drops off his guitar and he gets together with Scarlett and the boys to play in her garage.

Avery eventually stops being angry when he hears his song on the radio driving home but then gets angry again when he sees Gunnar, Scarlett, and the boys rehearsing in his old garage.

Juliette stops being angry when she makes conciliatory gestures toward her mother after Deacon makes her see that he and her mother are fighting the same battle. They sweetly, tearfully tell each other how proud they are of each other.

Rayna eventually stops being angry and tells Teddy as she's about to fly off with Juliette that she chose him and they're married and they will work it out. Teddy also stops being angry. Rayna is also no longer angry at Marshall and tells Bucky that if Edgehill can offer her her own vanity imprint she's all theirs.

Rayna and Teddy both get angry again when-- after Juliette tells them they have to wait for one more person on the plane to the next tour stop-- Deacon breezes in and onto the plane. He's joined Juliette's band. Ruh-roh."

It's a veritable hit parade this episode as Rayna, Juliette, and Deacon are hitting the road. Peggy and Teddy are hitting the sheets. Avery and Gunnar are hitting each other. Juliette's getting You Tube hits. And Rayna and Teddy are hitting the skids.

Alright in the night's big storyline we pick up right where we left off with Deacon surprising Rayna, Teddy and company by getting on the plane.

Juliette is really enjoying seeing Rayna so unsettled.

They head to Chicago where they're doing two sold out shows. While there:

-Watty White visits and she tells him Marshall gave her a vanity imprint and she wants to sign some up and coming talent. She asks about those kids she heard in the pilot and he reminds her that's Gunnar and Deacon's niece Scarlett and how they remind him of her and Deacon. At first she's hesitant to move on them since things are so messy with Deacon but by the end of the show she wants to sign 'em.

-Deacon quietly turns up his nose at all the trappings of Juliette's show: dancers, pyro, glitter. And she instantly now hates those things too and wants to be a real artist which she whines about to Glen. He warns her to ""stay on brand."" Since Juliette never does what she's told she decides that the second night in Chicago in an arena is the perfec place to premiere a soft ballad that she and Deacon wrote the day before called, it seems ""Consider Me."" It is gorgeous. The crowd responds okay but Glen is livid. He shows her some mean tweets that a critic wrote about her during the show and she gets upset. (Really? A few tweets from one person undoes her?) But then her assistant comes to her and tells her how much she loved it and, what's more, video uploaded from the show has gotten over 100,00 hits in just a few hours. Juliette decides this means it's time to change things up. She likes to be sparkly but she also wants to be serious and wants to take Deacon's advice to stop talking about doing something and just do it. Glen blames Deacon and tells him not to try to turn Juliette into his Rayna substitute. He scoffs, but...

-At first Deacon and Rayna scarcely acknowledge each other. Then, when her new female guitar player-- who she really likes-- needs help learning a specific lick Rayna tries to break the ice by asking Deacon to help show it to her. He seems to soften a bit but then when she brings up how his coming out is kind of messy he stiffens and says he won't get in her way. A few uncomfortable elevator rides later, Deacon decides to take his own advice and stop thinking and just do something and he plants one on Rayna in the elevator. She is taken aback. She paces around in her room for awhile and then texts him to come up. But as he's getting off the elevator he sees someone at Rayna's door...Teddy shows up.

The two of them had some terse conversation the previous day about Deacon being on the road and Teddy got angry. He then ran into Peggy who is getting a divorce. One thing led to another which led to her bedroom. She also points out that he's unhappy and he shouldn't have to work so hard to get someone to love him. They both know what they're doing is wrong so Teddy decides to make it right. He goes to Rayna and points out the flaws in their marriage and says he's tired of waiting for her to love him and he asks for a divorce.

Meanwhile back in Nashville Scarlett is having problems making rent and a low-paying, low interest gig that only nets her and the band $24 each isn't cutting. Simultaneously coincidentally Gunnar hates his new room mates. Scarlett invites to move in with ground rules: he should not walk around naked in the kitchen, she will not play banjo in the shower. (Yes, this makes no sense. Moving on.) Marilyn has many activities and gigs scheduled for Avery including shooting a ""day in the life with...' type spot on a cable show. While showing the crew around town he brings them to his and Scarlet's house. She storms out angry and demands the money he owes from her. He flippantly says since the broke up and she still lives there she can basically eat it. When he returns to apologize for grandstanding with the cameras, give her the money, and to say he misses her and hopes they can still be friends, he notices Gunnar in the house and says it's late to be working. She says they aren't. Avery flips and starts talking about Gunnar moving in on ""my woman."" Scarlett points out that she is not ""his."" Gunnar rightly stand up for Scarlett and tells Avery not to disrespect her and he also points out that what he's doing with Marilyn is gross and he knows it and this is making Avery hate himself. Avery gets in one punch before Gunnar knocks him to the ground with a right, left, and punch to the stomach combo. Avery turns tail and runs. He heads back to Marilyn's bloody and bowed. He packs a bag and says that she is not his girlfriend and if she needs to drop him as a client she should. She protests that they are using each other. He says he's done and that there's got to be a better way and storms out."

So it's the day after Teddy has asked Rayna for a divorce.

First she has to face a day of interviews and then it's showtime. She misses her first couple of cues at the top of the show and Bucky and Deacon are nervous and Juliette is thrilled.

Deacon pulls her aside to ask if everything is okay and she says it's not and they will talk about it but that she can't right now or she'll lose it.

She runs into Liam at her after party and decides to bury the hatchet with him with shots at a bar. She explains to him what's going on and how she wants to run away from her life. He plants one on her and at first she follows him back to his room. But after another quick make out session she pulls back and goes to cry in the bathroom. He eventually comes in and they just talk. She bemoans the end of her marriage wondering if she should stay in it for th ekids. He says his parents did that for awhile and the best day of his life was when they finally gave up. Of course, he only realizes that in retrospect and says the next day will be difficult for her. She suggests they finish making her album.

The next day Deacon notices Rayna being chummy with Liam and basically accuses her of sleeping with him. Rayna asks him what he wants from her and he bitterly says nothing.

She heads home to Teddy and the girls, who have made her a welcome home cake. They break the news, everyone is sad. Later, when Rayna is packing up some things Maddie comes to her and asks if Teddy is still seeing Peggy. This is news to Rayna. Maddie overheard them talking on the phone-- and Teddy saying how much better he felt when he talked to her-- and thought her mom should know.

Juliette has got a wild hair about changing up the show. Since the new song with Deacon went so well she wants to incorporate a whole acoustic section, complete with new staging and lighting for the second half of the tour. Glen would like her to hold her horses but Juliette will not be tamed. She hands out notes to the crew excising the ""juvenile"" parts of her show and tells Glen to make it happen, that she's no longer his puppet but the boss of multi-million dollar enterprise and she's taking the reins. Glen chafes at this and tells Deacon and the rest of the crew to run changes by him. Juliette doesn't like that Glen and the crew were talking behind her back so she wakes them all up in the middle of the night and tells them she's he boss. Glen quits and Juliette lets him. When she gets home she calls her mom and offers her a place to stay when she gets out of rehab.

Avery is struggling. He's staying in a crummy motel because he hasn't made a dime since signing with Dominic, who is torturing him with creative changes he wants to make to Avery's sound. But then Hayley and her publishing company come calling offering six figures for half his publishing. Marilyn tells him not to sell since it could be worth millions some day. He ignores her advice, and his concerns that he, Gunnar, and Scarlett will all be at the same company and sells and promptly get a check for $100,000.

Gunnar's brother shows up out of the blue looking for a place to crash and, incredibly, to restart the music career he contemplated before he got sent up the river. Gunnar explains to Scarlett what happened and she agrees to let him stay for one night only, not wanting to harbor a fugitive. He swears he has gotten rid of the gun and although he's breaking his parole by not staying in Texas he's otherwise on the straight and narrow. The next morning he explains to Scarlett how he raised Gunnar and gave him guitar lessons as wel as his first guitar. He makes Gunnar's favorite eggs. Gunnar and Scarlett work on a new song they are hoping to sell to Rayna since Watty called and said she's interested in signing them to her label. As they sing, Gunnar's brother picks up a spare guitar and plays along perfectly. Scarlett softens her position and says he can stay a few more days."

He tells her she did nothing wrong and to have no shame and hold her head high and the people that care about her know her and the rest can go to hell.

Scarlett cleans and tries to break her writer's block. In the process of gathering Jason's laundry they find his gun. Gunnar goes to talk to him. He shows him the gun and confronts him about lying.

Scarlett and Gunnar perform a lovely ballad. Juliette is impressed as is everyone else. Avery shows up but he's not on the list. He spies Gunnar and Scarlett singing.

Rayna sits at home. She calls up Watty and asks him to swing by so she can play him something.

Lamar has some appointment suggestions including Hank Tully as deputy mayor. Teddy says he'll consider it. Lamar wants more.

Juliette says she'll be singing so she'll see if there's time. Deacon goes to give a speech and, surreptitiously, Juliette's mother has some champagne. And really enjoys it. To the point that she needs to be pulled off the floor and poured into a car.

She thought about leaving her there and letting the house catch fire. Instead, she put out the cigarette.She admits that she wanted her mother to die. She asks if he thnks he can really help. He says he does.

Back at the party Deacon says he wishes she'd told him about the divorce. She apologizes and says she didn't want to drag him into it. He asks how she is.

The show is back and there's a lot of action tonight.

First off, Juliette is still working without a manager since she fired Glenn. Now she's getting uppity with Marshall at the record company, scorning his roll out campaign for her new album which she thinks is boring and lacks vision. It involves intimate fan club shows, TV appearances, and print and radio interviews. She decides, idiotically, to take matters into her own hands and tweet out publicly the location of an appearance in town later that day that is supposed to be just for the fan club.

Predictably, a mob scene ensues as she plays as fans push towards the stage. One of those fans is Maddie-- who is there against her mother's wishes-- who gets injured when shelving falls on her. Luckily, Deacon sees this and gets her to the hospital. Six other people are also injufred.

Meanwhile, Juliette doesn't understand why this huge crisis is her fault as she screams at her assistant and security guy to fix things. It takes a tearful Rayna calling to yell at her about Maddie being hurt for Juliette to realize her responsibility.

In addition to that epiphany, Juliette realizes she hasn't really been an active participant in her mother's recovery, which is being overseen by her sober counselor Dante. She comes around on that as well and apologizes and invites them both out on the road with her. She then heads to the hospital to pay the medical bills of those injured.

Avery is in Atlanta with Marilyn and Domino and is deeply unhappy. Domino plays him new mixes that have transformed Avery's songs from alt-country to dubstep. Avery is so mad he takes the masters and burns them, returns $75,000 of his $100k advance and gives Domino the keys back to the Mustang he gave Avery tells them both to kiss off. Domino warns him it's not that simple and that he will ruin his name in the music biz. Avery says he feels free for the first time in a long time. He heads home and cleanses himself by going to the Bluebird for open mic night and playing a simple piano ballad about grieving. (Best part of this storyline? When the emcee announces him as ""Avery Barksdale."" Hee hee. ""Close enough,"" says Avery to himself, the only person who cares.)

Meanwhile, Gunnar is seriously struggling with his brother's death and the fact that the police don't seem to be investigating it very deeply since his brother was a recently sprung felon. After falling into bed with Scarlett, which he cruelly says doesn't have to mean anything, he takes up day drinking and then totally skips out on the showcase they had with Rayna, Bucky and Marshall for Rayna's new label.

Scarlett decides to go by herself and slays accompanying herself on guitar. Unfortunately, the whole situation is fraught because at first Gunnar didn't show and Marshall was getting antsy and then Rayna got the call about Maddie while Scarlett was performing and rushed out.

Later, Scarlett confronts Gunnar who is drunk and unapologetic. He then decides to take matters into his own hands and go to the biker bar where his brother was last seen. Scarlett and Deacon put a stop to this and Deacon explains he actually does feel Gunnar's pain and guilt. He tells him that he once forced his best friend to drive drunk and they wrecked and his friend died. Gunnar and Scarlett head home. With a clearer head he apologizes. She tells him their night in bed was a mistake. But later they both toss and turn and go to each other. He says it did mean something and she says it wasn't a mistake. They kiss and head to Gunnar's bed.

The next morning Scarlett gets a call from Bucky, he offers a deal with Rayna's record label.

Deacon's storyline is the night's most lighthearted. He's having trouble with the puppy Juliette gave him so he heads to the vet, who basically tells him in the unnamed puppy is...acting like a puppy. Then, as it often goes with Deacon, they fall into bed together. It ends awkwardly with the vet, who is named Stacy, telling Deacon to name the dog. In a conversation with Coleman, who figures out that Deacon slept with Stacy, he says he thinks Deacon is subconsciously keeping himself available for Rayna and wonders when the last time he went on a proper date was. So Deacon heads back to the vet and asks her on a proper date. She accepts. He also names his male dog Sue. Stacy, who doesn't like country music, doesn't get it.

Meanwhile, Rayna is spinning plates. Trying to soothe the kids through the divorce, work on her new label, and handle the tabloid stuff by going on the Katie Couric show.

When Maddie is rude to her, as tweens with divorcing parents can be, Rayna grounds her. She then calls Teddy and they discuss their agreement-- they will take turns living in the house as opposed to having the girls move. Noting that he has appointed Peggy to his special projects team she asks him not to do any special project-ing at home.

Later that day, Teddy announces Coleman as his deputy mayor. Lamar shows up and he is not amused, talking about who put him there. He points out that Coleman didn't back his stadium plan. Coleman says he backs a stadium, just not Lamar's and then Teddy pulls out a drawing of a prospective new stadium -- Subway Park-- on a different parcel of land. Lamar practically has steam coming out of his ears. And then Teddy gets a call from Maddie lying about wanting to go to her friend's to study and he okays it. She heads off to the doomed Juliette Barnes show.

Then everybody gets the call and Teddy and Rayna head to the hospital. At first she tries to blame him for letting her go out while grounded. Teddy is annoyed that Deacon is there. (Deacon points out that Rayna got up to mischief at that age as well.) When Rayna tries to say she wants to come home that night to be with Maddie, Teddy stands firm pointing out that Rayna missed plenty of sprains and stitches that Teddy took care of while she was on the road and they need to stick to the agreement.

Rayna does, but can't hold off completely. She arrives at the house for a quick visit with a gift. She gives Maddie the first guitar she ever tried to play telling her to use it to work on music to help her get through these hard times. She and Maddie hug and she tells Maddie that she's also grounded for life."

It's ""Nashville"" in New York City tonight as the tour rolls into Brooklyn for three nights at the Barclays Center.

While Rayna, Tandy, and Daphne and Maddie marvel at Rayna's huge billboard in Times Square, Juliette is livid when she looks at it.

So Rayna has big plans to sightsee and eat out with the girls and Tandy but they talk about wanting to hang with Juliette and Maddie announces that she wants to be a singer. When Rayna balks at this idea, Maddie is upset. Tandy and Rayna talk and she points out that the girls idolize her and want to be like her and that her refusal to even consider letting them perform smacks of when Rayna complained that Lamar didn't support her dreams. This cuts Rayna who just hopes to protect them from the evils of the business. So, she wisely explains that she wants them to live their lives, have fun, cultivate their talents and they'll see but for right now, she's giving over her sound check to them so they can get the thrill of performing on her big stage. They play ""Ho Hey"" by the Lumineers, which Rayna's band has sweetly learned to play to back them, and they are adorable and sound great and get a huge hand from the band crew and assorted audience members including Bucky, Deacon, Tandy and Marshall Evans who gets a gleam in his eye and asks Rayna if she wants to sign them to her label. She tells him, playfully, to back off. It's a lovely scene.

Juliette meanwhile is trying to get to a Zen place with Dante and her mother but is too angry about the Rayna billboard. Dante, who you may recall was a corporate business type, tells her to do something about it. So she asks Marshall to find her some corporate sponsors. Under Dante's tutelage, she presents herself to a headphone company board room and explains her amazing Twitter/FB/Tumblr stats and achievements and admits she's made mistakes but is now a grown up ready to make everyone some money. She clinches the deal.

When her mother isn't exactly jumping for joy about this Juliette is confused. Since she has essentially hijacked Dante-- telling her mother to go to the crew AA meeting-- to strategize and has been grumpy about Rayna, she's been ignoring her. Her mother said she wished that Juliette could care for her as much as she does her career. Later that night she dedicates her new single to her mom onstage.

Even later, she dedicates her body to Dante, convincing him that since he's seen the real her they can make a good team. He tries, pretty weakly it would appear, to point out how complicated this would make things but she won't take no for an answer and they go to town.

Deacon asks Stacy to join him on the road and she, and Sue the dog, happily agree. But when she discovers that Deacon has ""history"" with both of the headliners and didn't tell him she is none too pleased, especially after awkward encounters with both Rayna and Juliette. He apologizes, admits that his history with Rayna is complex but says it's just that. And after some contemplation he says he's going to leave the road. She says not to do it for her, but he says he's ready to come home and there's plenty for him to do there.

Scarlett and Gunnar have a hot new neighbor, who comes in the welcome form of Chris Carmack from ""The O.C."" Of course, he's a musician. Scarlett invites him over for a get to know ya dinner. But he has come at an inopportune time. Scarlett's contract with Rayna's record label has shown up in the mail and she finally tells Gunnar what happened. He seems angry and that bleeds a little into their dinner with the new guy. Musically, however, he is a kindred spirit and he and Gunnar stay up late playing and singing together. He finally asks Gunnar why if they sing, write, and live together Scarlett got a deal and he didn't. Gunnar explains. The next day Gunnar tells Scarlett he is not mad she got a record deal, he's mad she kept it from him. He explains that he is not a jealous son of a bitch like Avery. He is proud of her, excited for her, and he loves her and he wants her to sign. They kiss and make up.

Avery goes to Haley to offer her new songs for his publishing deal but she informs him he's in breach of contract and either needs to pay back his deal or find another record deal pronto because the publishing company signed him as a performer. He doesn't know what to do since he gave all his money to Domino. So...he busks. His old buddy and bass player comes to hear him play and, graciously, offers him the phone number of a guy that can hire him as a roadie. At the end of the episode we see him getting in a cab and head for the airport telling the driver he's going to New York. (Will he be Juliette's new roadie? Then replace Deacon when he quits? Then become Juliette's new boyfriend?)

Lamar bumps into Coleman at the Hermitage Hotel, tries first to reminisce with him, then when that doesn't work belittles him, and then threatens him, all in an effort to convince him to persuade Teddy to reconsider about the stadium. Coleman is unmoved. Lamar goes back to his crony who suggests a more personal approach since they have discovered who leaked the Teddy-Rayna divorce news to the tabloids.

Peggy shows up at the Jaymes-Conrad family home in nothing but a trench coat. Teddy enjoys this but says no one can know she was there while Rayna was out of town.

Later when Teddy is gone, Lamar confronts Peggy. It turns out that she was the one who leaked the information about Teddy and Rayna's divorce, and lies about Rayna cheating, to the tabloids. Lamar convinces Peggy that Teddy would not be happy to hear this news so in exchange for not sharing her dirty deeds she is tasked with convincing Teddy to build the stadium on Lamar's land.

Cut to Peggy trying to do just that. Teddy rebuffs her saying he doesn't want anything to do with Lamar but she notes he's a big power broker and there is more room for expansion on his land. Teddy seems justifiably confused by this line of conversation.

After Lamar pressures Peggy he heads home and calls a crony to tell her that she's in the tank for them. But just as he toasts his new baseball stadium he drops his drink and clutches his chest. Lamar, it would appear is having a heart attack."

Lamar's heart attack and Juliette's libido throw the tour into a tizzy.

The gang is all still in New York when they get the news.

Rayna bows out of the final night of the NYC stand and borrows Juliette's plane and high tails it home with Tandy and the girls, which forces Teddy to kick Peggy Kenter out of his bed. (She later calls to say she loves him and he returns the affection.)

Rayna and Tandy head to the hospital where Tandy is button-holed by Lamar's business partner. Rayna goes in to see him and the reunion does not go well. He is terse with her and she can't summon the courage to break through that.

Watty White shows up to support Rayna and Lamar freaks out when he sees him screaming at him to leave the hospital and working himself up. Watty pulls Rayna aside and confesses that he was the musician with which her mother had an affair and the night her car crashed, she had her bags packed and was on her way to be with Watty.

Later when she and Tandy are chatting Lamar has another heart attack and has to go into surgery. Rayna leaves a plaintive message for Deacon who, on a travel day, comes to sit with her and comfort her which she appreciates. When it's time for him to leave she sweetly but heartbreakingly tells him to tell Stacy she said hi.

Tandy goes over all of Lamar's papers to be prepared for the worst and she finds something interesting. She discovers the Peggy situation and marches over to Teddy's office and hand him a file proving that it was Peggy Kenter who leaked the news of his divorce to the tabloids. He is gobsmacked.

After Lamar gets out of surgery Rayna takes his hand and talks to him as he sleeps saying she had no idea he had been hurt so badly by her mother and that she just felt like he was mad at her all the time and that they missed a whole chunk of their life together. He wakes up and smiles at her.

Meanwhile, Juliette and Dante decide that even though it's probably not the best course of action they are going to continue sleeping together and keep it from her mother. Her mother, feeling bereft, now that Dante is spending all his time as Juliette's de facto manager and ignoring their therapy sessions decides she wants to go home after almost drinking a bottle of vodka from the honor bar.

They put her off in the short term and try to scramble to figure out what to do about the show now that Rayna has cancelled. Instead of just finding a local opener, Juliette decides to expand her set by a whopping ten songs which, understandably, doesn't sit well with the band who have to learn them in a just a few hours. Deacon tries to talk some sense into her but they get into a shouting match.

Avery, who has been hired as a roadie for the tour, is busy trying to carry out the orders of the stage manager and find Juliette's in-ear monitors. He goes on her bus to find them and catches Juliette and Dante in flagrante de licto and Dante sees him and later fires him. Deacon goes to him and tells him off and rehires Avery. Again, after the show, in which he is chilly to her onstage, he goes to Juliette to ask why she is putting so much faith in her mother's sober companion. Juliette says he's the only one supporting him. He says that isn't true and that she shouldn't have done the show anyway since their was a family emergency. Juliette points out that Rayna isn't her family and no matter what Deacon thinks she isn't his either. He disagrees and this is when he heads back to Nashville to Rayna.

After the show Jolene goes to Dante and says again she wants to go home and worries that he's stopped caring about her. He says he does and she asks him to prove it and starts kissing him, just as Juliette enters the room. Juliette explodes and calls her disgusting. The argument spills into the hallway in front of the band. Dante grabs Juliette's hand and says they all need to calm down and Jolene realizes they're sleeping together and says Juliette is the disgusting one. The next day Juliette sends Jolene home with Emily, who is charged with getting her a new,female, sober companion and she informs Jolene that Dante is now her manager.

Back in Nashville, Scarlett signs her contract and Gunnar decides this is cause for celebration which ends up in a night out drinking with their new neighbor Will. After Will and Scarlett perform an impromptu duet at the bar, she confides in him that Gunnar hasn't written any new music since his brother died. After she goes to sleep, Will takes Gunnar out to shake him up. They dangerously race a train and although Gunnar is upset at first it does in fact make him feel alive! The next day he heads back to the publishing company and begins working on a new song. Meanwhile, Juliette heads over to Edgehill with Bucky-- Rayna couldn't make it because of Lamar-- and she is toasted by Marshall and the whole Edgehill staff and they congratulate her on being the first signing to Rayna's label."

Avery tries to sign up for open mic night but he's too late their full up. He does get their early enough to catch Gunnar's act with and his new attempts at swagger.

Liam and Rayna holding hands in the studio and Liam says he wants to whisk her away to St. Lucia. She says with kids, dad out of the hospital, and the tour she can't. He says she has a few days off after this tour and she said she wanted to live in the moment. She says she'll think about it.

Even better a guy named Jack Nelson comes up and says he wants to record the song he sang as a demo. Will asks if he's going to use the number and Gunnar tells him to knock himself out. Avery is also sitting at the bar and he compliments Gunnar's song and apologizes about the way he acted with Scarlett. Gunnar points out that he and Scarlett are together now and Scarlett got a record deal. Avery takes that in.

Rayna goes to hang with Lamar and he's poring over her clippings. He says he may not have agreed with all her choices but he still followed her career. She gingerly broaches the Watty White subject and says she had no idea how difficult that was for him. Lamar shuts that down. He says he wants to start all over with her and he wonders if they can. She says she thinks that would be nice. They look at old family photos and reminisce.

Teddy confronts Peggy about the leak. She says she didn't mean to and says a reporter tricked her into confirming the story and then she felt bad so she didn't tell him. She promises she didn't do it on purpose and then spills the beans on Lamar coming to her and trying to get her to persuade Teddy on his stadium site. She protests that they love each other. He says that's not enough and asks her to leave.

The next morning Scarlett tells Gunnar the good news that Rayna is willing to take him too but Gunnar doesn't want that anymore.

Onstage Rayna thanks Liam and they hug. Deacon, at the side of the stage with Stacy, sees something in that hug. A fan calls out a request for an old tune and Rayna protests Liam doesn't know the old ones. He immediately starts playing it and he says he knows the cool old ones. Stacy asks Deacon if this one he and Rayna did together. It is. Liam and Rayna duet very cozily. Deacon fidgets uncomfortably and tells Stacy he's going to get some water.

Tandy tells Lamar it's late and he needs to not be working. Lamar says Teddy has canceled their contracts because Tandy ratted out the Lamar/Peggy connection. Tandy says that Teddy has been part of their family for 13 years and she was showing him respect. Lamar counters it is his company, not Tandy's and he says after all that's happened that it was Rayna was there for him and isn't acting like he's lost his edge. He bids Tandy a dismissive goodnight.

Stacy goes to find Deacon and asks what that was all about. He is diffident.

She tells him to look into Teddy's past for some ammunition, especially in the Cumberland deal.

Emily reports that she got Jolene back to her place. Juliette is distraught she thought her mother was going to make it this time. Then she looks more closely at the drugs and starts to get a sinking feeling. The drugs can't be Jolene's: she is allergic to what's in them. Suddenly, realizing that it was Dante who ""found"" the drugs on her and Esme who vouched for them and then she handed them a big check she is very interested in finding Dante. Emily calls and it goes straight to voicemail. A crew guy reports Dante picked up the show money and claimed he was going to pay the crew. It would appear that Juliette has been had.

Post-show Scarlett chats with Avery at the side of the stage. She asks if he's miserable. He says no, he's just making the best of a good opportunity. She says it's nice to see this version of him again. Avery says he's trying to get back to who he was. He asks why she's still there.

Rayna goes to Deacon's and says she was at home packing but she had to say something. And that something is ""I love you.""

She says she just wouldn't feel right and he can do what he wants with that information. She goes to leave and he grabs and kisses her. (And it is awesome.)

Emily reports to Juliette that another $475,000 is missing from her corporate accounts and thinks they should call the police. Juliette doesn't want anyone else to know. She asks Emily to call her mom and tell her she doesn't have to go back to rehab since she doesn't think she can do it. Emily asks her what she wants to do about this house she bought. She says she's still buying it, as a reminder to never trust anybody.

Gunnar is working on a song and having beers with Will. He says the song he sang at Tootsie's was from lyrics his brother wrote and that he was the talent in the family. Will jokes that Gunnar told Jack Nelson the song was his. He laughs and says he didn't know how to explain it. A little dark. Will asks if Scarlett is mad that Gunnar decided to hang with him instead of going to the show with her. He laughs and says things have been getting pretty weird and he doesn't know how to fix it and that maybe he's kidding himself thinking it was going to last forever. Gunnar asks if that sounds stupid and Will says no and then Will tries to kiss him. Gunnar freaks out and kicks him out as Will protests that he didn't mean it and he apologizes.

Rayna and Deacon finally get it on. For reals.

Juliette gets drunk. Rayna gets down. Gunnar gets duplicitous. Avery gets dutiful. And Coleman gets out of the way in tonight's ""Nashville.""

Juliette, in her quest to keep the police -- and more importantly, by association the press-- out of her train wreck of a life, hires private security to track Dante, freeze her accounts, etc. She has also started drinking, heavily. But amidst the doom and gloom she gets the call that she has been nominated for the CMA Female Vocalist of the Year. Her excitement is tempered only slightly by the fact that Rayna is nominated as well.

Since Rayna has already won 4, Juliette is hell bent on having Marshall and the record company focus their efforts on her but when they please low budget, Juliette takes it upon herself to launch a million dollar campaign to woo CMA voters. She then finds out that Dante has spend $17,000 on an engagement ring. Presumably, not for her. She also keeps drinking. Enough to worry even her mom.

Enough that when she show up at the CMA nomination party that Rayna dubs her perfume 80 proof. Enough that she screams at Deacon while he and Rayna are trying to have a conversation so he quits. Enough that she then hires Avery to play for her show-- he does very well-- and then try to hit on him in her limo. He declines and she is sad she can't even pick up a roadie. Her security guard pours her back into her house where Jolene tries to tuck her in and console her as she tearfully wonders why nobody cares about her. And then Dante really lowers the boom. He calls and Juliette asks what he wants. And then all we hear is her say ""What kind of tape?"" (Looks like a Juliette sex tape is in the offing.)

Meanwhile Deacon and Rayna are all lovey-dovey, schmoopy with each other in bed but when the real world starts to encroach things get tougher. In an effort to be honest with Teddy she tells him that she and Deacon are tentatively an item and he goes ballistic noting there's no way Rayna can have a relationship with him and not eventually tell him that Maddie is his biological daughter so she should call it off. Apparently, they had an agreement that he would never be told when they got married.

Rayna tries to pull back, saying they should take it slow. Coleman tries to warn him that he shouldn't blow up his whole life for a woman who has messed with his mind over the years. Stacy is heartbroken when he awkwardly breaks up with her and gives her his dog to boot. Tandy tells Rayna she should just treat it as a fling. But warning signs be damned, they find each other too irresistible and when he says he knows she's not telling him something and that he doesn't care she melts all over again in the back of her limo on the way from the CMA nomination party.

While this is going on, Teddy is dealing with a sullen Maddie who blames him for the divorce. Whatever you want to say about his philandering, Peggy Kenter ways, he is a great dad and loves her even knowing her paternity. He convinces her to go to her school's father-daughter dance and eventually goads her into dancing and she has a great time. She later tells him she's glad she went but misses that they are not a whole family anymore.

While he's patching things up with Maddie, Teddy gets a break-up note from Coleman. When Coleman realizes that Tandy, Teddy, and Lamar all have their guns pointed at each other and each was trying to use him as a pawn, he wisely realizes if he just gets out of their way they'll destroy each other and he can likely swoop in and pick up Nashville's pieces.

Across town Gunnar is still weirded out by Will but he didn't say anything to Scarlett about it. He's too busy stealing his brother's song to record a demo with that producer who heard him in the bar with Will. He goes off to do that while Will and Scarlett go to the CMA nomination party, schmooze with industry people, and get confused when they see Avery onstage with Juliette.

Gunnar cuts his demo, his producer loves it and asks if he has more. He shows him Jason's notebook of song idea and he loves them but has trouble reconciling the outlaw type songs with Gunnar. He says it's all true except where the statute of limitations has run out, ha ha ha. So it looks like he plans to steal all of Jason's songs. Later, as Scarlett returns from the party he's listening to the demo and she gives it a spin and says she likes it too. But later she finds Jason's notebook and kinda can't believe he took Jason's song. He shrugs it off saying it's just a song."

A lot of action in tonight's penultimate season one episode.

First up is Rayna's label announcement. Marshall wants to close the deal on two artists by the end of the month and get going. Rayna knows she's got Scarlett, and will introduce her at a show at the Opry the following night, but she and Bucky decide to hold auditions to find a male artist.

When Will gets wind of the super-secret auditions from Scarlett he shows up and talks his way into an audition and wows Rayna and Bucky with his swagger and voice.

Meanwhile Gunnar is running himself ragged recording Jason's songs and trying to build an ""outlaw"" image to fit them. When he goes on a radio show and claims that he's a bad boy who does what he wants, Scarlett wonders what is happening to him and asks Will to speak to him.

Will heads down to a gig where Gunnar is playing up said image and when a guy at the bar wonders where Gunnar did the time he sings about, he and Will get into a scuffle that lands them in jail, which causes them to miss Scarlett's debut at the Opry.

The debut itself is a triumph. Even though she is nervous and calling Gunnar, Deacon helps prop her up and then she gets a box from a friend in the audience: a whisk from Avery. It is very sweet. She finds him in the audience as she sings and it perks her up and he just beams at her. She receives a standing ovation.

The next morning in jail Will and Gunnar commiserate. Gunnar thanks him for having his back. Will says it's not his first time in jail but it doesn't seem like Gunnar. He replies he doesn't know what's ""like me"" anymore. Will apologizes for ""that thing"" he did. Gunnar apologizes for overreacting saying he was just surprised. Will admits that when he was 17 that his dad caught him with a friend and asked him to explain himself. He couldn't. His dad said he couldn't live under his roof while he figured it out. So he hitched a ride to Abilene, got a job, and learned guitar. Gunnar asked him if he ever figured it out. Will says that all he knows is the only time he's happy is when he's playing and singing. He's going to be a country star no matter what it takes. Gunnar agrees he is going to do the same.

Scarlett bails them out and Will promises to pay her back. Gunnar tries to apologize but Scarlett isn't having it. She says she fell in love with Gunnar, not his brother and she wants no part of what he's doing.

Meanwhile, when Lamar starts showing signs of forgetfulness Tandy tries to lay the groundwork for a coup. But Lamar shows up unannounced at a board meeting and reclaims his place at the head of the table.

Juliette's goes from frying pan to full on fire. After a brief writing session with Avery in which she says she doesn't believe in love because everyone who ever loved her betrayed her, she gets bad news from Dante.

He wants $2 million for the SD card of the sex tape he made of them. Juliette still doesn't want to involve the police and have a scandal right before the CMAs so she sets up a meeting to hand off the cash. Dante doesn't show and decides to up his price to $10 million. Juliette decides to simply come clean and sets up an interview with ""The View"" and tapes a statement saying she has made mistakes but this time she simply fell in love and trusted the wrong man.

But just as she's about to appear on the show via satellite she gets a desperate call from Jolene. After going on an oxy and booze bender, she called Dante and told him she'd give him the original two million in exchange for the card. But when he shows up, she shoots him instead and then overdoses. She calls Juliette and says her goodbyes and throws the SD card in the garbage disposal.

Juliette arrives to the apartment and weeps over the wreckage. Later, catatonic with grief and anger she watches the news reports of the shooting and overdose.

And finally, Deacon wonders when he and Rayna can stop sneaking around. She says she needs to talk to the girls but in the meantime invites him over to dinner with them.

They're getting cozy playing a tune when Teddy shows up unannounced and pulls Rayna aside. He reiterates that he doesn't want her to see him or have him around the girls. She says it's not up to him. She notes that her opposition to Peggy was that he was having an affair. He counters that she was having one the entire time they were married. She tells him not to rewrite history and that he can't dictate what she does.

Except the next day Teddy serves her with a restraining order. Rayna can't believe he did this and Teddy tells Rayna that he finally did what Lamar said and he grew a pair.

Rayna tells Deacon about the restraining order but says she can still see him. Maddie overhears her saying I love you and so Rayna sits her down and tells her it's Deacon, that they're seeing each other, and it's grown-up stuff and when she's old enough she'll tell her.

Rayna visits Lamar and asks him to help with the restraining order. Lamar says he'll take care of it.

Teddy and Rayna meet up in court and the judge admits that Lamar called him but it was just to put in a word for keeping the proceedings quiet. He lifts the restraining order and says that they will need to return to court in two weeks.

Maddie goes snooping in Rayna's closet and finds a strongbox.

Rayna goes to see Teddy and says she wants to come to an understanding like reasonable people reassuring him that he will always be Maddie's father. She notes that he has trusted her all this time to keep this secret and that he needs to keep trusting her. He agrees.

Unfortunately, inside the strongbox Maddie found a paternity test. She calls her friend in tears saying that she doesn't think Teddy is her father."

Post-show he visits her dressing room and tells her about Maddie's visit. He wants to know that she hasn't been lying to him every moment of the last 13 years. He wants to know how it's possible. She says the fact that he can't remember is how it's possible. She asks him to remember how he was. He says he does. She says she got pregnant, married Teddy, agreed to get the paternity test after they were married, found out and Coleman told them not to tell Deacon, to ""cut him loose,"" because it would interfere with his recovery since it took him five rehab stints to get sober. He is, understandably, freaked out and leaves. She starts to cry. A production assistant comes in and tell her she's on to present an award in 40 seconds.

Rayna calls Teddy and tells him Maddie knows and to be her partner in this to get Maddie through it and to come to the house.

They try to talk to Maddie who is packing a bag. They try to explain. Maddie is angry saying that Rayna lied to Maddie and to Deacon and she wants to live with Teddy and runs out. Rayna goes after her but Teddy stops her saying she promised him he wouldn't lose her and now he's promising her the same thing and to let Maddie work it out.

Simultaneously, Deacon proceeds to get drunk at a bar. He asks the bartender to turn off the CMAs.

The next day Rayna calls Coleman and asks him to go find Deacon.

Rayna goes to Juliette's mom's funeral and calls Deacon once again, hoping he'll be there.

Instead he's chasing after Teddy at City Hall and starting a fight. Teddy says Rayna deserved better than him and that he hasn't changed. Security tackles him.

Rayna offers her condolences to Juliette. Juliette explains she grew up in the dirt and now she gets to put her mother back in the dirt. She lived her life knowing this day would come, dreading it, wanting it, hating herself for wanting it. She always thought if she was good enough her mother would get better but she was never good enough. Rayna says she is good enough. She asks if she knows if Deacon is coming. She doesn't.

Gunner finds Deacon puking off his porch. He helps his drunk ass in. Gunner asks for advice on Scarlett. Deacon says he has none and shuts the door in his face. Gunner calls Scarlett and tells her to get Coleman there stat.

Coleman and Scarlett show up and Deacon is in a drunken rage. He is destroying things. He tells Coleman to leave, he tells Gunner he's not good enough for Scarlett. He charges Coleman screaming in a rage that Coleman told Rayna to cut him loose. It is chaos. Gunner pulls him off. Deacon apologizes to Scarlett. Gunner ushers her out as Coleman subdues him. Deacon says he doesn't want to talk. Coleman says that's fine but he's not leaving.

Coleman calls Rayna and tells her to stay away. Deacon wakes up. Coleman tells him he talked to Rayna and got the story. Deacon says he's not ready to talk about that yet but he wants to go to a meeting. He says he gets that he just washed 13 years of sobriety down the toilet. He says he plans to go get his new welcome chip at the 8 o'clock meeting and Coleman says he'll be there.

Rayna talks with Maddie and explains she married Teddy because she loved him and also so Maddie would have a father and that she loves her more than anyone in the world and she's never going to leave her. They cry and hug.

Deacon showers and takes some aspirin. Juliette calls him and he apologizes for not being at the funeral. She says it's her fault for pushing him away. She says she's having a memorial at the Bluebird and asks him to come. He says he'll be there and then takes a slug off a bottle.

Juliette holds her memorial at the Bluebird. She admits her mom was a mess but she was her mess, and she loved her and her biggest dream was to see her sing at the Bluebird so she dedicates a song to her mom with Avery backing her up.

The audience includes Rayna, Marshall, Glen, and a drunk Deacon. Rayna spots Deacon and goes out to meet him. He tells her to go back inside. She realizes he's drunk and tells him to slide over that she's driving his car home.

They drive and talk, we don't hear what they say. The conversation becomes heated and Rayna swerves to avoid another car and Deacon's car flips.





Jack and Gunner meet and he admit he stole Jason's words and the outlaw thing is an act and his girlfriend doesn't like it. Jack says he's not serious about career if he's going to chuck it over some girl he's not going to remember in 10 years.

Will thanks Scarlett for bailing him out and tells her to work it out with Gunner. But she's having breakfast with Avery. He tells her she was truly great. And she says it means a lot coming from him. Avery hopes Gunner is treating her right. She says they have things to work out. He claims he's sorry to hear it. She says he's not. He tells her to come by his gig that night.

Gunner brings Scarlett flowers and asks to start over since he came clean to his producer. She's unsure. He asks what more she wants. She says she doesn't know what she wants and that she's late to see an old friend play.

Gunner goes back to Will's and walks in on him with a girl in bed. Gunner is confused. Will says he's going to be the next big thing in country music and he'll do what ""that"" takes. Will tells him about seeing Scarlett with Avery.

Avery calls Scarlett to come up and sing a song he wrote for her a long time ago. She does and, of course, that's the moment that Gunner walks in. He orders a beer and drinks as they sing.

Scarlett and Gunner meet and talk. We don't hear what they say. He touches her face and gets down on one knee and proposes.

Will is in a restaurant with his new girl when a cute waiter appears to recognize him. He silently wills him away with his eyes and a small shake of his head.

Lamar demotes Tandy in favor of a board member who is his yes man. She quits and says she's just his daughter now and apparently he can only be on good terms with one of those at a time.

US attorney Dashiell confronts Tandy and says he wants to talk to her about Lamar."

This episode showcases a different view on friendship, and how even something as simple as the desire to have a friend can be harmful. To be true, pick your friends wisely.

Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp are a pair of undersea crooks who are out to ""take over"" something before an even more notorious crook named Crab Louie arrives in Atlantica. They encounter Urchin, an orphan merboy who pretends to be independent and tough as nails, but actually craves friendship. Lobster Mobster pretends to offer friendship in the guise of joining his ""gang"", which Urchin eagerly accepts. First task as part of the gang is to steal some food. When Urchin hears that the Neptune Ball is underway at the royal palace, he sabotages the dance and makes off with a sack of food during the commotion. However, his actions are witnessed by none other than Triton, Ariel and Flounder.

When Urchin swims away, Ariel and Flounder chase after him. Ariel, curious and not at all angry, confronts Urchin about the stolen food. Ariel offers a hand of friendship to Urchin that is different from that offered by Lobster Mobster, but Urchin is reluctant to take it. Even so, Ariel has never been one to give up easily, so she tries again... Only to be captured by Lobster Mobster, who wants to use her as a hostage to get Triton's treasure.

From here, Urchin surprises even Ariel when he shows his true colours: he's actually a nice kid, and a clever one, at that. Thinking on the flick of his tail, he comes up with a plan to save Ariel, and then later to remove Crab Louie, impressing even Triton himself.

All in all, it's an excellent introduction to a lovable character who's flawed in places but has a heart of gold something he shares in common with Ariel herself."

When the twins accidently get stuck in a bubble from the Lobster Mobster's bubble gun and are almost eaten by a giant squid, it's up to Ariel & friends to rescue them. In the end Ariel concludes that despite everything babysitting is pretty fun and volunteers to do it again whenever the Clambakersfields come back to visit.

They try to trick Thor into believing that Ariel wouldn't make the perfect partner, which leads to a mini-war between Olympia and Atlantica, until they try to put a stop to it.

This episode deals with the simple things of friendship and harmony in the diversity of the underwater realm. Also, it introduces us to the Manta, whom I think is the best villain of the animated series.

The episode starts with Ariel and Flounder seeing off Triton, Sebastian and Urchin as they leave to watch a turtle race elsewhere. Left to their own devices, Ariel immediately drags Flounder to explore a dormant volcano outside Atlantica. There, they suddenly hear a voice, small and helpless, asking for help from inside the volcano. Though Flounder thinks it's a bad idea, Ariel lets it out, only to find that the small creature was in fact a giant Manta, who thanks her with a wicked chuckle before heading for Atlantica.

There, the Manta uses his charms and hypnotic powers to turn the Atlanticans against each other. He exerts his strong influence on them one by one, teaching them to stick to their own kind, and soon enough the Atlanticans are forming exclusive ""cliques"" and refusing to mix around with anyone else. Fights, verbal and physical, break out all over Atlantica over the most petty of things.

Ariel and Flounder try to trap the Manta in a net, but he's too powerful and escapes easily. So they decide to use a different approach, and try to reason with the angry Atlanticans, and to help threm remember how wonderful their lives had all been when they were openly sharing their world. In particular Ariel tells them to believe in their hearts, and not to just blindly listen to what any outsider says about each other."

In this episode, Arista and Ariel come head-to-head at last.

It is time for the Carnival of Tides. Everyone in Atlantica is looking forward to it, especially King Triton's daughters because there appears to be something for everyone to do at the carnival. Sebastian has been given the task of gathering all seven girls and getting them ready to leave. Ariel, as usual, is late because she's hanging out with Urchin and Flounder.

As soon as Ariel does come back to the palace, she gets into a fight with Arista. Why? Over a comb that Ariel found and actually belongs to Arista. It isn't really much of a reason to start a fight, but Ariel and Arista don't need much of a reason because they just don't get along. Sebastian tries to get them to stop fighting but fails. When King Triton sees what's up he declares the two girls beached and bans them from going to the Carnival of Tides. Sebastian, of course, is then assigned to be their babysitter.

As you can imagine, neither girl takes very well to this, and they immediately start blaming each other.

It looks to be another boring being-stuck-at-home thing, until the Gators arrive. Specifically, Flo and Ebb Gator, freshwater thieves. Their target is the royal treasure, left unguarded in the absence of King Triton's trident.

Ariel and Arista quickly develop a truce; the Gators are the biggest threat, not each other. If they work together, they can stop the fiends from reaching the royal treasure. Oh, and Sebastian helps, too.

As things go on, of course, Ariel learns that all this while Arista has actually been secretly envious of Ariel's adventures. After all, Ariel gets to do amazing things on a near-daily basis, and although Arista is not quite as outgoing as Ariel, it would be nice to do something amazing once in a while. Brought closer by this admission, the two sisters put their heads together setting up traps for the Gators, so we end up with Home Alone in Atlantica."

We see him hanging out with King Triton, the father Urchin never knew, and then later sneaking off to Ariel's sisters' dressing room to play a few pranks on the unsuspecting mermaids.

Central to the episode is that Father's Day is close at hand in Atlantica. While Flounder's perfectly happy to get his father ordinary fin warmers, Ariel wants to get her father something special. Urchin, being an orphan, is a little glum in the face of Ariel's enthusiasm until she suggests that he get something for King Triton, since they have been bonding quite a bit in recent times.

So in their quest for the perfect Father's Day gift, the gang meet Moray the Eel, a mer-street vendor. He sells them a map to Shark Canyon where they'll be able to get rare glow shells, something that Ariel thinks will make the best Father's Day Gift ever. Shark Canyon itself doesn't have any sharks, but there is a large squid hanging around and as a result Ariel and Flounder get stuck in a cave. Urchin goes off to get help, but with King Triton being off-duty, Urchin steals borrows the trident, fully intending to return it once he uses it to save Ariel and Flounder.

But as usual, things go wrong. Urchin loses the trident to the sneaky Moray, and so after he frees Ariel and Flounder on his own, the trio go after the Eel, hoping to get back the trident before Triton notices that it's missing. But to their dismay, they discover that Moray has given the trident to the Evil Manta.

On the whole, this is an Urchin episode. He's still the lovable raggamuffin he was when we first met him, but somehow along the way he became a welcome fixture into Ariel's family."

In this episode gives in to her baser instincts and ends up doing something classically teenage-girly.

Like every other typical teenhood situation in the movies/on tv, there is one alpha female on the block who decides on what's hot and what's not. In Atlantica, that happens to be Pearl (who first appeared in the episode Red), and whom Ariel admires for her effortless cool... which is kinda understandable, since Ariel is quite the outcast among her merfolk peers.

When Ariel hears her sister Alana is going to a party at Pearl's house, Ariel shyly asks if she can come along. Pearl says yes, Ariel is excited, Alana decides to give her sister a makeover, and Flounder is skeptical about the whole thing (being a boy and all). Ariel and Alana ask their father for permission to go to the party, and it's granted because King Triton feels that it's okay as long as Pearl's parents will be around to supervise the party.

Later when Pearl comes by the palace to pick the two princesses up, she weasels Ariel into driving Triton's chariot to the party. Ariel and Alana are helpless to deny Pearl what she wants, and off they go. But then it turns out that there is no party at Pearl's house, and Pearl is in fact taking them to Eel-ectric City, the place so hoppin' that it's always boppin'. Flounder finds out about this and recruits Sebastian, so that together they can go after and rescue Ariel, though when they arrive things don't quite work out in the way they planned.

It's a lighthearted and modern episode in that sense that it pays homage to the typical teen drama where the unpopular girl wants to be popular and learns that it isn't all that it's cracked up to be. I like that despite all of Ariel's willingness to rebel and push her father's rules, there are some things that make even her uncomfortable, because they're just not worth it. Also, you'd think that this episode would end with Triton scolding his daughters, wouldn't you? Heheh."

A couple, the Simms, and their young daughter Mary come in as Lewis goes through his manifest. He tells the couple that they're closed, and Mrs. Irene Simms points out the sign out front says that the store is open. Lewis agrees to stay open, and the Simms look around and Irene tells Mary not to touch anything. Mary does anyway, and Lewis tells her to stop. The girl ignores him and Lewis warns her that the things are not to be played with.

Irene hears them talking and comes over to remind Mary what she said. When Mr. Simms tells Mary to listen to her mother, Mary says that Irene isn't her mother and her real mother is dead. Irene takes offense, and Mr. Simms tells his step wife to leave Mary alone. Lewis goes upstairs, and Mary spots an antique female doll on a shelf. Smiling, the girl picks it up, looks at her parents, and then runs outside with it. She goes to a nearby garage where two boys are working on a car, to get out of the rain.

Mary pulls the string on the back of the doll, and it laughs. The doll talks, saying her name is Vita, and says that the two of them can do a lot of things and they're going to be best friends. The two boys come over and ask Mary where her parents are, and Mary tells the boys to leave them alone. Mary tells them to go away, and Vita tells her that she can have anything she wants. Vita then lunges at one of the boys, scratches his throat with one hand, and Mary runs off with Vita.

When Mary come back into the store, and her parents fuss over her. Mary says that Vita did it. Lewis takes the doll and insists that it's not for sale, and nothing in the store is for sale. He orders the Simms out, and they quickly leave. Once Lewis is alone, he mutters ""no more"", puts Vita in a bag, along with some of the other antiques, and goes down to a vault in the basement. He puts the antique into it, and above, the windows in the store open apparently on their own.

Lewis quickly finishes putting the antique away, while a wind blows through \the store above. Sealing the vault, Lewis sees flaming hoof prints on the stairs and demonic laughter. He screams in terror and runs to the freight elevator. The antiques in the vault move on their own, and they fly out of the vault doors as they open on their own and fly at Lewis. A cross hovers before Lewis, and when he grabs it, it burns his hand. The elevator door opens, and after Lewis stumbles backward into the elevator, the door closes behind him and the elevator ascends.

A demonic sign burns itself into the wooden floor of the elevator, and the fire consumes the floor revealing a bottomless shaft. Lewis grabs the sides of the elevator, but the metal mesh sparks, breaking his grip so he plummets down the shaft to Hell.

Six months later, Michelle ""Micki"" Foster tells her fiancé Lloyd that she has to go. Lloyd isn't happy that she's going when his law firm company picnic is coming up, and Micki assures Lloyd that she'll be back. He says that he plans to announce their engagement and it would ""behoove"" her to be there. Micki takes offense at his tone, and Lloyd apologizes and says that he wishes she'd get the antique store over with. She says that she wants to as well, and doesn't know why her Uncle Lewis left her the store because she hadn't met him or the cousin, Ryan Dallion, that she's sharing everything with. Lloyd figures that he can sue Ryan for a greater share of the inheritance and get some litigation experience.

Micki takes a taxi to the store and notices that the front door is open. She goes inside and calls to anyone there, but gets no response. Ryan jumps out from behind a counter, wearing an antique mask, and startling Micki. She hits him over the head with an antique and he removes the mask. Micki realizes who he is, and explains that Lewis' lawyer told her Ryan would be there, and introduces herself. Ryan says that he thought the telegram said ""Michael"", and he was expecting a man. He's looking forward to cleaning the place up, but Micki isn't impressed with it. She goes to call Lloyd and tell her that she arrived safely, and discovers the phone are out until the next day.

Ryan looks around and admires the antiques, and figures Lewis was his kind of guy. He says that the lawyer said the store was in probate and they got it by default. They look around and find Lewis' antique limo, and invites Micki to get into the backseat while he checks it out. A cat jumps onto the back seat, startling Micki, and she goes back into the store.

Micki finds her way to the basement and Ryan follows her, saying that it was just a cat. She wants to get an appraisal on the property, and Ryan finds the broken wall and the vault doors beyond. He points out that whatever is behind the doors belongs to them, and pries the door open. Inside are all the antiques Lewis stored there, and the cousins go in, Ryan propping the door open with a metal piece. Mick says that something doesn't feel right about it, and they hear something behind them. Ryan goes to check it out, and the metal propping the doors open bends and shifts so that the door close.

Micki yells in panic, figuring Ryan is playing another prank. Ryan tries to get the door open, and Vita on the shelf comes to ""life"". Micki sees it and backs away. Antiques fall off the shelf toward her. She finally gets the doors open and runs out, goes to the staircase, and trips. When she grabs a banister, it twists opening a secret compartment in the ceiling. Lewis' manifest drops out and falls onto a couch near the cousins.

Intrigued, Ryan looks through it. Micki complains that she almost suffocated and starts to describe how the doll moved, but then figures Ryan wouldn't believe her. Ryan dismiss her as a ""tight ass"", and Micki throws antiques at him in anger. He stops her and figures that she doesn't want to run the store with him. Micki tells him that she came there to sell the place. She points out that they didn't even know Lewis, and Ryan says that they're not selling.

The cousins are soon selling, holding a going-out-of-business sale. Ryan concedes that Micki might have been right, and he never wanted to run a business. Mr. Simms is among the people that comes in, and buys Vita for Mary. Micki refuses to sell it, recognizing it from the vault, but Ryan overrides her and sells it to Mr. Simms.

That night, the cousins are counting their money and Ryan tells Micki that they should have everything sold. A man, Jack Marshak, sneaks into the store and searches for something. Micki and Ryan hear him, and Ryan grabs a pipe. They go after Jack, who has moved upstairs, and Jack grabs a sword and tells Ryan to drop his improvised weapon. Ryan does so and Jack demands to know who they are. When Ryan asks who he is, Jack says that he supplies the store with antiques and Lewis didn't always pay his invoices.

The cousins explain that Lewis was their uncle, and Jack is unaware that Lewis is dead until they tell him. They have coffee in the kitchen, and Jack says that he and Lewis were boyhood friends. Jack opens Lewis's eyes to the spirit world, and warns that they may not want to believe in it. He says that Lewis was afraid of growing old, and was greedy, and he dabbled in things that Jack wanted no part of. Jack says that Lewis was involved in devil worship, and he was ready to make a pact with the Devil involving his antiques. In return, Lewis would get immense wealth and immortality. Jack admits that he must not have succeeded if Lewis died, and they'll never know what really happened. He wonders if Lewis left a record of what happened to his antiques, and Ryan shows him the manifest.

When Jack sees the manifest, he confirms that the runes on it are black magic. Jack finds another of Lewis' secret compartments, and it contains finds files on various antiques. The antiques are all in the manifest, and were all connected to mysterious deaths. Micki doesn't believe in any of it, and Jack suggests that Lewis tried to get out of the pact and the Devil killed him. The antique remained cursed, including the ones that the cousins sold. Micki figures that Vita was cursed, and describes how it looked at her like it was alive.

At the Simms home, Mr. Simms gives Mary the doll. He tells her not to let Irene know about it, and Mary agrees. Once they're alone, Vita tells Mary that they can do everything. Downstairs, the husband and wife argue and Vita tells Mary that they can do anything they want with Irene.

Irene finds the wrapping from the present and tells her husband that Mary doesn't deserve one. His wife says that Mary is spoiled, and Mr. Simms says that he tried to make up for the fact that Mary lost her mother. Irene says that she'll take Vita away from Mary, and Mary hears her.

Ryan and Micki find the check Mr. Simms used to pay for Vita, and they go to get it while Jack is going to consult with a medium for more information. He says that the cousins can go home and forget it all happened, but Micki figures that if there's the slightest chance Jack is right, a little girl has the doll and they need to get it back.

In her room, Mary has a tea party with Vita and her other dolls. Vita points out that Irene is mean to Mary, and plays on Mary's hatred of Irene to ""punish"" her stepmother. Mary hesitantly asks what they should do, but Vita goes silent when Irene comes in. The girl refuses to talk to her because she's having a tea party with her friends, and Irene says that she doesn't hate her but doesn't like how she's been acting. She points out that Mary left her bicycle on the driveway again, and she's taking away her new doll as punishment but can have her back in a week. Mary says that Irene will never take Vita from her and runs away with the doll.

Irene chases Mary to the edge of stairs, takes Vita, and orders Mary into her room. Once Mary goes, Irene puts the doll into a hallway closet. Mary watches from her bedroom door, and Irene goes down the stairs.

Ryan and Micki drive to the Simms' address

Mary gets Vita from the closet, and Irene comes up and sees her stepdaughter with the doll. She tells Mary to give her the doll, and Vita looks at Mary. A skate rolls over under the doll's control, moving behind Irene. Mary then holds Vita out at Irene, and Vita hisses at Irene. Irene steps backward, trips on the skate, and falls down the stairs. Mary looks at her unconscious stepmother, then walks outside after the paramedics arrive to take Irene to the hospital.

Ryan and Micki arrive and figure that they're too late. A neighbor woman tells them what happened, and the cousins see Mary sitting on the curb with Vita. They go over to get the doll, and Mary tells them to go away and Vita hisses at them. Mary then gets into the ambulance with her father, and it leaves for the hospital.

At the hospital, Irene wakes up and Mr. Simms tells her where she is. Mary is in the room with Vita, and Mr. Simms goes to call a doctor. Vita tells Mary to kill Irene, and Mary holds Vita up to Irene, who stares in horror. The girl holds Vita up to Irene's face and Irene dies, gasping in terror. Mr. Simms comes back and breaks into tears, while Mary sits down, plays with Vita, and laughs.

Micki and Ryan arrive at the hospital the next morning, claiming to be Mary's niece and nephew, and the nurse at reception tells them that Irene passed away from a cardiac arrest. Micki worries that someone else might be in danger just like Irene.

The neighbor woman comes over at Mr. Simm's invitation to babysit Mary while he takes care of the funeral arrangements. He worries about Mary since she's lost two mothers.

Mary is playing in her basement play room with Vita and her stuffed animals. The babysitter is sitting in the room and hears Mary. Mary puts a record on and tells Vita that she's having fun just like Vita said, and tells the babysitter that they want more chocolate chip cookies. When the babysitter refuses, saying Mary has eaten too many, Mary demands the cookies and yanks the package away from the women. The babysitter says that it might be good if Mary takes a nap, but Mary refuses and tells her to go away and get out of their house. Vita tells Mary that she knows what to do, and the nearby records fly through the air at the babysitter, under Vita's demonic control.

Micki and Ryan comes to the house, Micki figures that it's their responsibility to deal with the doll.

Vita animates the stuffed animals, which move at the babysitter. A jump rope animates and wraps around the babysitter's neck, and Ryan and Micki at the front door hear her scream and pound on the door. Mary leaves out the patio door with Vita, while Ryan picks the lock on the door. Meanwhile, a bookshelf falls on the babysitter .Everything magically restores itself before the cousins arrive, and they confirm that the babysitter is still alive.

Ryan calls an ambulance on the room's phone, and Micki sees Mary on a swing at a nearby playground. She points the girl out to Ryan and goes after her, and Mary figures that Micki is there to take vita away. Micki says that she has to, and Mary walks away. She holds the doll up and the swings jump at Micki. Micki breaks free of them, and Mary climbs up a slide. Mary holds the doll up, and a clown head on a nearby set breathes fire, and a tetherball swings on its own into Micki.

Mary slides down the slide and goes to a nearby roundabout. Micki follows her and tells her to give her the doll. The roundabout spins on its own, and Micki grabs a railing and gets on as storm clouds gather. Micki tries to get to Mary, and the roundabout speeds up. Ryan arrives and tells Mick not to let go of the railing, and he jumps on the roundabout and manages to pull Vita away from Mary. Mary falls off the roundabout, and it stops spinning as the storm clouds disappear. They go to the bruised Mary, and Micki hugs her and says she'll be okay as they take the girl back to the house.

That night, Jack puts the doll back in the vault and seals the doors. He says that once the antiques were cursed, they can't be destroyed, so they have to be sealed in the vault to keep anyone else from getting them. Micki wonders what will happen to Mary, and Ryan figures that a good shrink can fix her up in 20 years.

Micki calls Lloyd and says that they'll have to postpone the wedding while she deals with Lewis business affairs. Lloyd isn't happy and hangs up. Ryan suggests they change the name of the store, and Jack suggests ""Curious Goods"". Micki figures they need to get all of the antiques back, the ones that Lewis sold and they sold. When she wonders where they begin, Jack finds an article in a newspaper."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583327/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,Ryan and Micki disguise themselves as monks to retrieve a mysterious pen kept in an ancient monastery.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Timothy Bond'],"['', '', '']",[],"['cousins', 'objects', 'female role lead', 'male role lead', 'search for lost object', 'fear', 'human sacrifice', 'sacrifice', 'cursed object']",[],"At the Eternal Brotherhood Monastery, Abbot Capilano says that they won't sell the monastery no matter what the price offered. Brother Albert La Croix suggests that they could do a lot of good with the money, but then says that he'll support whatever decision Capilano makes. Capilano says that the decision is anonymous and adjourns the meeting.

Capilano goes up to the roof to send a message by pigeon to the Brotherhood headquarters, announcing the decision. Meanwhile, a hooded monk in his quarters writes that Capilano's heart is filled with joy as he sends the message. The monk writes of how Capilano dreams of flight, and Capilano levitates off the roof. He drifts out over the courtyard, and the writer says that Capilano will be deluded. The abbot abruptly plummets to his death many stories below, and the writer closes his book after writing that one more obstacle has been removed from his control of the monastery.

At Curious Goods, Ryan reads a newspaper article about the ""Oracle of Death"", Brother Currie. A monk claims that he can predict eight deaths, a fire, and an airplane crash. Micki is skeptical, but Jack overhears and describes the story of Nostradamus. Micki isn't convinced, figures that the Oracle of Death is a hoax. Jack sees in the article that the monk uses a quill pen, and says that he picked up the antique quill pen himself. Jack confirms that a quill pen is listed in the manifest. It was sold to Rupert Seldon, and Jack warns that the Eternal Brotherhood is like a fortress and it's a cloistered monastery so it's incommunicado. Jack figures he can forge a letter of introduction, but warns that Micki won't be allowed because women aren't permitted there.

Ryan binds up Micki's breasts and she puts on a monk's robe along with Ryan. Jack finishes the forged letter, and tells Ryan and Micki that their Brothers Matthew and Simon, being transferred in from a monastery in Yorkshire. They go to the monastery and Brother Drake shows them to their quarters. As they go, Drake points out where Capilano ""accidentally"" fell to his death. Ryan says that Micki has taken a vow of silence so she won't give away by her voice that she's a woman, and Ryan turns the conversation to Currie. Drake says that Currie predicted Capilano's death, and Currie is in seclusion and meets with no one.

Drake takes them to their room, and explains that since space is cramped, they'll be sharing the same room. He directs them to the communal lavatory and showers, and Ryan quickly excuses Drake. Micki isn't impressed with the monks' ""generosity"", and refuses to take a communal shower. Ryan says that they'll find Currie, grab the pen, and leave.

That night, the brothers gather for communion. Drake points out Ryan to La Croix, saying that he was asking questions about Currie. La Croix suspects they might be journalists and says to keep an eye on them. Afterward, Micki and Ryan go back to their room and go to the mess hall to find Currie. Drake secretly follows them, while they follow a monk taking a tray of food to Currie in a basement cloister. The monk follows them through a chamber filled with a guillotine, and the monk leaves the tray of food at a door and leaves. Currie comes out, and Ryan asks to talk to him about the quill pen. Drake comes up behind them and says that Currie has taken a vow of silence, and he'll escort them back to their quarters.

The next morning, Drake has Ryan and Micki tend to the yard. Brother Arrupe runs past, and Ryan flag him down. Arrupe says that the Oracle of Death has made another pronouncement, that the abbot is going to choke to death. Ryan points out that the abbot died two days ago, and Arrupe wonders if their concern has been misplaced.

That night, Ryan and Mick return to their room. Meanwhile, Arrupe is in his room and receives a message that he's been appointed abbot. He goes to bed, and the canopy on his canopy bed comes down. The blankets pin Arrupe to the mattress, and the cloth canopy smothers him. Arrupe rips a hole in the cloth, and Micki, Ryan, and the other monks hear his screams. They run to his quarters and find Arrupe dead. Ryan and Micki find the message saying that Arrupe had been declared abbot.

The next day, La Croix calls Ryan and Micki to his office. He asks who they are, and Ryan sticks to his cover story. La Croix asks why they were searching for Currie. When Ryan says that they just want to see him, La Croix says that's impossible because Currie wants to be left alone with his burden.

The cousins go back to work on the lawn, and Micki complains about the burden of hunting down the antiques. Ryan doesn't see the problem, and says that it's up to them to get the antiques because no one else is going to do it, and no one will ever believe it.

At Curious Goods, Jack makes a fake quill pen.

Drake introduces Ryan to Brother Jack, a transfer like Ryan. It's Jack, and once Drake leaves, Micki joins them. Jack says that he got photos of the pen from a collector, and made the duplicate. Micki shrieks when she finds a spider, and La Croix and Drake are watching from a distance and notice. Jack says that Seldon is wanted for the murder of his business partner and disappeared afterward.

La Croix--Seldon--visits Currie, who knows that the newcomers know about the pen's problems. He wants to stop using the pen, but La Croix figures that they need to write a new epitaph. He points out that Currie would be behind bars if not for his deal with La Croix, but Currie figures that prison wouldn't be any worse. He asks La Croix to stop torturing him, and La Croix lights a cigar and chuckles, saying that splitting a $500,000 advance on the biography of the Oracle isn't torture. La Croix says that he needs Currie to take credit for what he writes. When Currie says that La Croix is despicable, La Croix says that they both are. When he's abbot, he can sell the monastery and they'll pocket $10 million from the sale. Currie says that it's over and he's leaving, saying that the Oracle has made his last prediction.

Once Currie leaves, La Croix goes to his diary and makes a new entry with the pen. Currie hides beneath the guillotine to avoid some passing monks, and La Croix writes about him committing suicide by the guillotine. Currie is forced to climb onto the guillotine. Meanwhile, Micki and Ryan go to Currie's cell and find it empty. They hear Currie moaning in terror as he straps himself to the guillotine, and run over just as Currie is forced to release the blade.

La Croix runs out and joins them, and says that Currie predicted his own death.

Back in their room, Micki figures that it's the end of things. Ryan points out that they still have to find the pen. Micki says that she's scared, and Ryan admits that he's terrified.

La Croix makes another entry with the pen, describing how Micki and Ryan will be bit by a poisonous spider. A tarantula crawls into the cousins' room and onto the sleeping Micki. She wakes up and sees the tarantula, and calls to Ryan. Ryan tells her to freeze and knocks the spider off, and Jack comes in. Micki points out the tarantula to him, and Jack casually picks it up and says that it's harmless.

The next day while they're working, Micki tells Ryan and Jack that she has to get out. Jack says that there will always be an element of danger, and that's why he's there. Meanwhile, La Croix and Drake are out walking, and La Croix tells Drake that Currie left behind a number of predictions. He's surprised to see the cousins alive, and asks them if there any interruptions with pests. Jack says that there wasn't, and once La Croix leaves, and Jack figures La Croix was fishing for information and that the cousins were supposed to die. Since they're not who La Croix believes that they are, the pen didn't work on them.

La Croix tells Drake to meet with the reporters at the front gate, who are asking about Currie. He also tells Drake to find out if the Yorkshire monastery sent the two new monks. He figures that ""Matthew"" and ""Simon"" aren't who they claim to be.

Ryan points out that there was no diary in Currie's cell, or they would have seen it when they searched the place. They figure La Croix has the pen, and Jack says that he can search it while Drake suspects Miki and Ryan.

At the front gate, Drake gives a prepared statement that Currie killed himself because of the burden of his fatal predictions. Micki and Ryan watch La Croix, who is quietly reading a book on the lawn.

Jack searches La Croix's office and finds the diary. He matches the signature on the invoice from the shop for Seldon, with La Croix's writing in the diary. Jack finds Ryan and Micki outside, and tells them what he's found. Drake overhears them talking about going back to La Croix's office to continue the search during the next meditation.

Micki takes a shower while Ryan stands guard outside. Drake sees her through a peephole and realizes that she's an imposter. He goes to La Croix and tells him that the real Matthew and Simon never left the Yorkshire monastery, and they were both bitten by poisonous tarantulas and died. He tells La Croix that ""Simon"" is a she and offers to have them removed. La Croix stops him, telling Drake to act like nothing has changed. He has Drake start the meditation without him and leaves.

Jack goes back to La Croix's office and searches it. He's looking under a table and when La Croix comes in, Jack claims that he saw a mouse. La Croix draws a gun on Jack, takes him down to the guillotine, and ties it to him. Jack calls La Croix by his real name and figures his upcoming meeting is about real estate. La Croix admits that he has the pen, and puts a burning candle beneath the blade rope.

Ryan and Micki are at meditation, and an impatient Micki finally gets up and tells Ryan that she's going to look for the pen while he look for Jack. She has the fake pen with her.

Real estate agent Marvin Green meets with La Croix to finalize the sale of the monastery. Drake is listening at the door as Green and La Croix discuss the sale. Green offers to reduce his commission to 10%, and La Croix chuckles and says that the commission is normally 3.5%. He demands cash and a percentage, and Green agrees. La Croix excuses himself and leaves with Green in tow, and Micki slips into La Croix's office.

Jack tries to blow the candle out without success.

Micki finds the pen in a hidden compartment in La Croix's chair, and substitutes the duplicate for it. La Croix returns to his office and Micki hides, and he discovers that the diary is gone. He leaves, unaware that he has the duplicate, and Micki quickly leaves as well.

Ryan finds Jack and frees him just in time as the rope burns through. Micki joins them and says that she found the pen. La Croix comes out, gun drawn, and has them hand over the pen. He finds the invoice Jack brought and blindly writes down their epitaph, making sure to say that they're imposters. Drake charges out, swings at La Croix, and misses. La Croix trains the gun on Drake as well, and Drake accuses him of being a traitor. Drake drops the axe and La Croix continues writing on the invoice, saying that a tragedy will be fall the imposters.

Finishing, La Croix realizes that the rope has dropped off the guillotine blade. Jack tells him that he should never write on what he's already signed, and the blade levitates toward La Croix. It flies at La Croix, just missing him several times, and finally embeds itself in a wall. La Croix chuckles in triumph, circles back, and prepares to shoot the trio and Drake. The blade pulls itself free and Micki calls a warning, but La Croix figures that it's a trick. Slamming into his back, the blade kills La Croix and he falls to the floor. Ryan takes the pen.

Later back at Curious Goods, Jack explains that the pen can only make evil predictions come true. Micki has changed back into a dress, and Jack explains that the pen Ryan is holding is the fake. Ryan uses it to write a prediction for lunch, and Micki and Jack stop him."

He tries to make eye contact with a woman, who sees him and tries to avoid him. Hastings goes over anyway and asks the woman to dance. She refuses and the man with her tells Hastings that the woman isn't interested. When Hastings persists, the woman angrily tells him that she doesn't want to dance with him and goes to the dance floor with the other man.

Hastings goes back to the bar and removes the bag from the Cupid statue. It comes to life and fires a magical arrow into the girl's arm. Hastings goes over and cuts in, and the woman agrees. She suggests they find a motel room, and Hastings agrees. As they go, Hastings grabs the Cupid statue. They go to the honeymoon suite of a nearby motel and start kissing on the bed. The Cupid statue, placed on a counter top, looks on. After sex, the woman says that it's crazy and she's never experienced anything like it before. She tells Hastings that she love and he strangles her to death.

Frat boys from the bar break in and stop Hastings. One of them, Bowser, sees the Cupid and takes it while his friends pry Hastings off of the dead woman. Ryan reads more of the article, in which Hastings said that he had to kill for Cupid.

The next day at Curious Goods, Micki reads a story about the murder and the Cupid. She asks Jack what she remembers about the Cupid in Lewis' manifest, and he remembers picking it up in Cairo. The maker was so ugly that no woman could look at him, so he vowed vengeance and had the Cupid cast in his image.

Ryan reads more of the article, which talks about how Hastings said he had to kill for Cupid's sake. Micki identifies the Cupid from the manifest, and Lewis sold it to a Frederick Mason four years ago. Jack confirms that Frederick killed three women and was sentenced to death.

Ryan and Micki go to the motel posing as policemen, and the manager says that he saw the Cupid when they barged in but now it's disappeared. The manager says that the frat boys came by and they knocked the door down, and remembers that one of them picked up the statue. They all wore the same t-shirt with the fraternity name on it, but he couldn't read the Greek letters. They all had a symbol of a heart with an arrow through it on the t-shirts.

At the nearby college, Eddie Monroe is taking photographs of Laurie Warren. A campus security guard asks Eddie what he's doing, and Eddie claims that he's taking photos of birds. Eddie approaches Laurie and says that he's been calling her. He thought they could go out again, and Laurie says that she helped him with his homework and it wasn't a date. Eddie accuses her of thinking she's too good for him, and a terrified Laurie says she doesn't think that and tries to walk away. He follows her and asks if he isn't good enough for her, and Laurie doesn't want to talk about it. When Eddie grabs her by the shoulders, Laurie tells him that if she reports him again, he'll be kicked out of college again.

Ryan and Micki arrive, posing as cops and ask about the fraternities. Eddie confirms the fraternity is Delta Lambda Chi from the heart-and-arrow symbol the cousins describe. He shows he's wearing a similar t-shirt and says that he's a member, and Laurie offers to take them there as an excuse to get away from Eddie. Eddie offers them a ride in his truck, but Laurie says it's not far and Micki says that they'll walk. As Laurie leads them away, she tells Micki that she's glad they interrupted.

Eddie drives to the frat house and starts picking up papers. The president of the fraternity, Harold, tells him to do a good job because they're having a party that night, and he lets Eddie wear one of their shirts but he's not a member.

Cleaning up the rooms, Eddie finds the Cupid. Bowser comes in, and Eddie claims that he's dusting. Once Bowser leaves, Eddie looks at the statue.

When Micki and Ryan arrive at the frat house, Ryan figures they'll hand over the statue since one of them took evidence from a crime scene. The cousins go in and Bowser tells Micki that she's invited to the party. Pp asks why they're there, and Ryan says that they're there on official business and are going to look around. When Harold asks for official ID, Ryan says that it's a personal matter and they're not cops.

Micki leads Ryan out, and they spot Eddie bagging garbage. They ask if he saw the Cupid, and Eddie claims that he didn't. The cousins leave, and Ryan tells Micki that she's going to accept the invitation so they can attend the party. That night in a college boiler room, Eddie sits in his quarters looking at the photos of Lauren that he's taken. He also has the Cupid, and cuts out the head of Laurie from the photos and laughs manically.

At the store, Micki and Ryan talk over the situation with Jack. He says that he has what they need to find the Cupid without searching the fraternity.

At the fraternity party, Jack poses as a bartender. He mixes in an old Scottish ""truth serum"" with the punch, and tells Micki and Ryan that it's sodium pentothal. Meanwhile, Eddie takes photos of Lauren with a male student before they go into the party. When Eddie tries to go into the party, Harold intercept shim and reminds Eddie of what he said earlier. Eddie walks off and drives to a bar, taking the Cupid with him. He tries to hit on a red head, who ignores him.

Ryan and Micki search the fraternity for the Cupid but find nothing. Meanwhile, Bowser drinks at the bar and Jack asks him if he's seen the Cupid. Under the influence, Bowser says that he's got it as Micki and Ryan come over. He takes the cousins to his room to show them, but discovers that it's gone. Bowser figures that Eddie took it when he was cleaning, and he caught Eddie looking at it earlier. Ryan says that they'll try to get it from Eddie, gets Eddie's address from Bowser, and the cousins leave.

At the bar, Eddie puts the Cupid on the bar top. The red head Eddie was hitting on says that it's ugly. Eddie asks the red head for a light, and the Cupid shoots her. She then says that she has a light. Eddie invites her to come for a ride with him, and the red head immediately agrees. They drive off in Eddie's truck.

Ryan and Micki go to the boiler room, avoid a trip wire Eddie left, and search Eddie's quarters.

Eddie parks in some woods, and he and the red head make out. After sex, the red head tells Eddie that she loves him. Eddie take a bottle of honey out of the glove compartment, says it gives him energy, and puts some on the red head's lips and fingers. He then excuses himself to urinate and leaves the cab. Eddie tells her to lock the doors for safety and walks off.

Micki and Ryan search Eddie's quarters, and find the photos of him and Laurie that he pasted together from separate photos. Ryan figures that Eddie has a serious problem.

Eddie finds a beehive, goes back to his truck, and puts it in the front seat. The bees attack the honey-covered red head, stinging her to death. The Cupid watches in satisfaction from the truck bed, and the red head can't get out of the cab because Eddie has parked to block the opposing door, and is keeping the passenger-side door closed. Eddie watches through the window and laughs mockingly as the red head dies.

Micki and Ryan return to the fraternity, and find the drug-influenced Harold talking to Jack about his divorced father. The cousins draw Jack aside and tell him that Eddie has the Cupid and he's dangerous. Jack goes to look for Eddie while the cousins look for Eddie. One fraternity brother says Eddie might have gone to the motel bar nearby because he couldn't get a drink at the party. Jack excuses himself and heads to the motel bar.

The obsessed Eddie drives to Laurie's house.

At the motel bar, Jack talks to the bartender who says that another guy was looking for Eddie. The bartender says Eddie left with the red head but doesn't know how Eddie did it. The bartender overhead that Eddie was taking the red head to Mason's Creek, and Jack heads there.

Ryan and Micki confirm with Harold that Jack left.

Jack drives to Mason's Creek and searches around. He find the red head's bee stung corpse dumped in the woods, and Bowser shows up. He recognizes Jack from the party, and says he came to recover the Cupid that Eddie stole from him.

Laurie's boyfriend Alex leaves her sitting beneath a tree, to get some beer. Eddie comes up behind Laurie, puts the Cupid on the grass, and asks if he can sit down. Laurie refuses, saying she's with someone, and tells Eddie to go away. He show her the Cupid and claims that it's a token of his affection for her.

Micki and Ryan search for Eddie, and spot Eddie walking away arm-in-arm with Eddie. Eddie abandons Laurie and runs into the boiler room, and Ryan goes after him while Micki stays with Laurie. Eddie hides behind a pillar and Ryan runs past him, then climbs up a ladder. Ryan hears him, doubles back, and grabs the Cupid that Eddie is holding, trying to pull it away from Eddie. When he fails, he grabs a pile and hits Eddie. Eddie drops the Cupid, and Ryan grabs it and runs out.

Micki tries to tell Laurie that he's obsessed, but Laurie is under the Cupid's spell and doesn't believe it. Ryan returns with the Cupid. Laurie demands an explanation, and Jack finds them and says that he found the corpse of the red head. Eddie returns and hides in the bushes, overhearing them. The security guard comes over and asks if everything is okay, and says that the frat boys reported the Cupid as stolen. The guard takes it to the security office for safekeeping, and walks away.

The trio figure it will be safe in the security office and drive off with Laurie. Meanwhile, Eddie approaches the guard and says that they bought the Cupid at a swap meet. The guard, thinking Eddie is with the fraternity, gives the Cupid to him.

The trio return to the store with Laurie, and Micki has her stay upstairs in her room with her. Once Micki leaves her alone, she joins the two men. Jack figures they can't tell the police about the Cupid because then they would hold it as evidence. Meanwhile, the still love-smitten Laurie calls Eddie at the boiler room. She says that she had to go with the trio to avoid arousing their suspicions, and Eddie invites her to his place. Laurie agrees and confirms Eddie got the Cupid, and says that she loves him.

Laurie sneaks out and goes to the boiler room. Eddie has set out a candlelit dining table, and comes up behind her holding the Cupid.

The runaway wakes up and asks what the woman wants, and the woman sits down next to her and offers her a cup of hot tea. The woman says that she's nobody just like runaway girl, and takes an ivy-covered cup of tea out of a paper bag along with a Thermos. She pours some tea and offers it to the runaway, and the runaway drinks from it. The ivy on the tea cup comes to life, grows, and strangles the runaway, then retracts back onto the cup.

Later, Lady Die is singing in a recording booth. The sound board operator, Teddy, puts in a new path and Die stops the recording to complain and tells Teddy not to surprise her again. She storms off to her dressing room, and her agent Langley follows her in and shows her PR shots while Die checks her face in her mirror. She complains about looking too old in one photo and picks another one, and asks about the benefit concert she's doing in a few nights. Die doesn't want to look chintzy on her first benefit, and Langley asks her why she's doing it for the homeless. The singer doesn't give an explanation, and Langley quickly apologizes for giving an opinion she disagrees with.

Teddy comes in and tells Die that they're ready for her. She goes back to the recording studio and starts singing.

Later at the store, Ryan is listening to Die's record on his stereo. Micki comes in with groceries and Ryan shows off his record collection to her. She turns down the volume, and a social worker, Birdie, comes in with their curtains that she's been working on to spruce up the place. Jack is working nearby and tells her that she shouldn't have, but Birdie insists. She tries to flirt with Jack, who is busy working on a protein drink and isn't interested. Ryan and Micki pick up on Birdie's interest and go under to run interference between Jack and Birdie.

Jack is working on rats and says that his drink tends to have a mild aphrodisiac effect. Birdie offers to volunteer, Jack hastily dismisses her offer while thanking her, and Micki leads Birdie off for some coffee. Birdie says that there was another murder in the park and she had to identify the body. The runaway had no family or friends, and wasn't the first similar murder. Jack and Micki remember and case earlier that year about a woman, Sarah Berell, and Birdie points out that Sarah disappear but wasn't strangled. She says that the police don't care and nobody cares about the homeless, and Ryan points out that Die is holding a benefit concert for the homeless. Birdie notes that a concert won't stop the murders.

Micki offers herself and Ryan talking to the police. Birdie figures it won't do any good, but the cousins go to the morgue where a coroner is working on the runaway's body while Lieutenant Fishbein looks on. Micki and Ryan talk to Fishbein about the homeless deaths, passing themselves off as neighborhood watch. Fishbein says that homeless persons make perfect targets for sport, and says that the murderer is a sicko. He says that unless they have an eyewitness, he's unlike to solve the murders. The coroner finds a greenish stain on the corpse's neck, and Ryan grabs a leaf on the clothing. Fishbein tells Micki that the cousins are trespassing and should get the hell out or he'll arrest them.

The cousins take the leaf back to the store, and Jack confirms that it's swapper's ivy from Ireland. It doesn't exist anymore and was considered an evil plant. The user could use the ivy to trade for whatever they wanted, and finds a reference to a tea cup with swapper's ivy design on it in the manifest. It was sold to Fat Eddie Burrell two years ago, and he lives in Hillsdale.

That night, Ryan and Micki go to Fat Eddie's seemingly-abandoned apartment building. The front door is unlocked and they hesitantly go in. The apartment is overgrown with ivy and seemingly abandoned, uneaten food on the table. A murphy's bed with a skeleton on it falls out of its closet.

Die is at the benefit concert stage, having her crew set up the lighting. She checks her face in her compact, and Langley assures her that she looks fine. Die leaves and Langley sees a young girl, Kristen, grabbing food from the crafts table. When Kristen tries to run, Langley grabs her and then gives her a cinnamon bun. Kristen hugs him and leaves, and Langley discovers that Kristen stole his wallet. The girl in some bushes while Langley runs past without seeing her.

The woman approaches a homeless person sitting on a park bench and offers him a cup of tea from the ivy cup. Kristen comes up and asks if she can have some tea, and the woman tells her that it's just for grownups. The girl admires the woman's bracelet, and the woman offers it to her if she leaves. Kristen accepts and goes, and when the homeless man drinks from the cup, the ivy comes to life and strangles him to death as the woman--Die--watches in satisfaction. Kristen witnesses the murder from the darkness.

The next day, Fishbein and his men take the body away after having Birdie try to identify it. Birdie goes over to where Micki and Ryan are waiting, and says that the homeless man isn't one of hers. Ryan goes to get the limo. Kristen is there and asks Birdie for some food, and Micki offers to find her some. Birdie sees Die's bracelet that Kristen is wearing and asks where she got it, and Kristen insists that it's hers. The social worker says that it belonged to Sarah and that Sarah was Fat Eddie's brother. Kristen finally says that the woman who murdered the homeless man gave the bracelet to her, and confirms the woman was much younger than Sarah, who was over 70. The girl describes how the woman she saw was giving the homeless man something to drink in a tea cup, and Micki says that Kristen had better come with her.

Ryan pulls up and Kristen runs. When he comes over to ask Micki and Birdie what was going on, Fishbein notices.

As they drive back, Ryan figures that Kristen is terrified. Birdie says that she'll get them a photo of Sarah from her file. On the radio, the announcer David Kay says that he'll be interviewing Die that night before her benefit concert the next night. Ryan turns the volume up on Die's song, and Micki asks him to turn it down. Birdie smiles and says that Sarah used to sing the nursery rhyme ""I'm a Little Teapot"", that Die is doing a rock version of.

Later at the store, Ryan ""ages"" the album cover of Die. Jack says that in the legends, old age was traded for youth. Birdie comes in wearing a mini-skirt as Jack suggests that the ivy trades the victim's life force for the cupholder's age. The social worker shows off her dress and asks what Jack thinks, and suggests they get some meal. Jack begs off and goes back to check on his experiment. Micki tells Birdie that Jack is just shy, but Birdie isn't consoled. She notices Ryan's sketch and says that Sarah had the same problem, then leaves.

Once Birdie leaves, a relieved Jack comes back. Ryan suggests that Die and Sarah are the same person, and Jack suggests that they pay Die a visit. Micki points out that Die is being interviewed live by Kay that night, and Jack offers to print them the proper credentials.

Kristen walks down the street and comes to the radio station, and sees a poster of Die and recognizes her from the murder scene. Ryan and Micki pull up and go in, posing as rock magazine reporters. Meanwhile, Kay is interviewing Die about the concert. She says that she's doing something for the homeless, and he plays a song from her new CD. Langley is there and comments that Die is looking tired. She checks her face in her compact and realizes that her age is catching up to her.

Ryan and Micki come in and flash their fake credentials, Micki posing as Ryan's chauffeur, and say it's about Sarah. Die feigns ignorance, and Langley and Kay call for security. Die runs out the back and bumps into Kirsten, who pickpockets the teacup from her as the rock singer runs off. Birdie is also there and stares at Die in recognition. When Birdie calls her by ""Sarah"", Die runs the other way.

The guards escort Ryan and Micki out. They both noticed that Die is aging, and figure she went to the park to find a new victim.

In the park, Die approaches a sleeping homeless man and offers him a drink. She discovers that the teacup is gone.

Kristen in an alleyway, singing the nursery rhyme. She makes the motion, then grabs the cup and runs off.

Micki and Ryan search the park looking for Die. Ryan insists that Die is Sarah, and that's why she ran when they mentioned the cup. Micki figures that Die will on killing to stay young, and Ryan points out that they have to stop her before Die gives her concert because after that, she leaves town on her tour.

An aging Die crawls back the way she came, looking for the cup on the ground. Meanwhile, Micki and Ryan spot a woman with white hair, her back to them, and approach her. They grab her but it's not Die and she screams. Ryan apologizes and the cousins continue on.

Birdie searches the park for Die.

Kristen returns to the park with the cup, finds her things where she hid them, and lies on her blanket humming to herself. She dozes off but wakes up when someone approaches her, and runs away holding the cup. It's Micki and Ryan, who catch her and tell Kristen not to worry. Micki offers to give her a real meal, a bed, and another pretty cup for the teacup, and Kristen agrees. They leave and Die watches them from the shadows.

The cousins return to the store with Kirsten and tell Jack that they recovered the cup. They take Kirsten upstairs to the bedrooms, unaware that Birdie followed them. Ryan puts the cup down on a desk before he goes to the kitchen with Jack to make some food for Kirsten, and Micki makes up a bed for Kirsten. Birdie breaks in, grabs the cup, and leaves. The others have gathered in the kitchen, and hear the bell on the door. Birdie hails a taxi and tells the driver to take her to the park.

As Micki tucks Kirsten in, she assures the girl that the store wouldn't be a good place for her to live permanently. Micki assures Kirsten that she can stay there for a while and then they'll find her a good home.

Birdie approaches a sleeping drifter asks him to join her for a nightcap. She talks about how it's lonely no matter where she is, and pours alcohol into the cup. Birdie mutters a toast to happiness and youth, then gives the drifter the cup to drink. As the leaves stares to come to life, Birdie yanks the cup away, tosses it on the ground, and wonders what she's doing. As Birdie cries, the drifter invites her to drink with him and she accepts, drinking from the bottle.

The next day, Ryan says that the thief was apparently old and moved slow. They figure it was Sarah, not Die, and she was aging. They figure that if they don't stop Die, she'll kill again.

In the park, the drifter says he'd better ""start his rounds"". Birdie thanks him for talking to her, saying that she needed the company, and the drifter tells her that she's cool for an old lady. She says that she doesn't feel like one anymore, and after the drifter leaves Birdie picks up the cup and leaves. Birdie goes to a phone booth and calls the store, unaware that the aged Die is watching her from the nearby bushes. The social worker tells Ryan that she has the cup and would like to return it.

Ryan and the others drive to the park, and Fishbein and his assistant secretly follow them. The trio discover that Birdie is gone and split up to search for her. Meanwhile, Die chases Birdie, who trips on a branch, falls down a slope, and drops the cup. Birdie passes out, and Micki and Ryan find her a few minutes later. Fishbein and his men arrest them arrest them as the killers, and Fishbein confirms that Birdie is still alive. The cousins insist that Die is the murderer, but Fishbein doesn't believe them. Jack watches from hiding and slips away.

The aged Die goes to the phone booth and calls Langley, and tells him not to cancel the show.

Fishbein and his men take Ryan and Micki to a squad car and drive them off, then put Birdie into an ambulance.

In the park, Die finds a sleeping homeless man under a blanket and pours him a cup of tea. She offers it to the man, who is Jack wearing a wig. He dumps the tea out and says that the cup doesn't belong to her and runs off with it. Die collapses to the ground, yelling in frustration.

That night at the concert venue, Langley goes to Die's trailer and calls through the door, saying that her fans want her. Die tells Langley not to come in and she'll be out in a second. Meanwhile, Jack goes to the venue. Micki and Ryan have been freed and are with the recovered Birdie at Die's trailer, plotting to steal the cup from Die. Jack finds them and shows them the cup, and Langley sees them and asks what is going on. The door opens and the now decrepit Die says that it's show time. She then dies of old age and falls onto the ground.

The next day at the store, Jack continues working on the protein drink and removes the aphrodisiac effect. Micki comes downstairs with Kirsten, and Birdie comes in and greets the group. She confirms that Kirsten hasn't changed her mind about moving off the streets and asks if they want to play tea party."

Ryan watches her and the Murphy bed comes down, revealing a dummy of a corpse that Ryan planted. He comes in and jokes with Micki, who is not amused. The ""dummy"" reveals that he's Ryan's friend, Larry, and Ryan dismisses it as part of Halloween. Micki complains about letting Ryan talking her into having a party at Curious Goods, and Ryan insists that they have to let the neighbors know that the store is nothing to be scared of. Micki wonders how they'll keep track of everything with so many people there, and Ryan assures her that he made a sign that the vault is off-limits.

More guests arrive, and Jack dressed as Merlin performs magic tricks and Tarot card readings. Meanwhile, Larry and his friend Howard ignore the keep out sign and go down to the basement vault. They turn off the lights, scaring the guests, and when they turn the lights back on at the fuse box, it burns out. Continuing on, Larry and Howard find a crystal ball sphere and Howard wants to leave, frightened. Larry jokingly tries to call up Elvis, and the ball changes color. Ryan comes down as they both run for the stairs, and Ryan tells them that the party is upstairs.

The two teenagers go back upstairs, and Ryan gets the lights back on. As he goes back upstairs, he hears something moving in the darkness and goes back to investigate. He finds the ball, now emitting smoke, and runs upstairs. Ryan tells Jack and Micki that they have a problem, and a cold wind blows through the room. A ceiling tile breaks open, and Jack yells at everyone to get out.

Once everyone leaves, the ghostly noises and wind die down. Jack has Ryan draw a pentacle around the desk and gets the crystal ball. He brings it to desk and tells the cousins that Larry and Howard attracted something when they triggered the ball. A pumpkin explodes, and Jack casts a spell to banish the ghosts. Everything quiets down and Ryan asks Micki to come with him to get punch from the kitchen.

Jack hears a tapping at the door and goes to investigate. He finds a girl sitting outside, Greta, and she says that she went out trick-or-treating and got lost. Greta says that she lives nearby, and Jack takes her home.

Ryan and Micki come back and discover that Jack is gone.

Greta continues leading Jack on, insisting her house is just ahead.

Ryan insists that whatever was haunting them before is gone. Meanwhile, the mist from the ball drifts up the stairs and the cousins feel the chill from it.

Jack realizes that Greta is leading her in circles and tells her that her game is over. Greta insists that it's no game and they're almost there, and Jack goes with her.

Ryan and Micki hear a ghostly sighing as the mist drifts into the main room. Lewis' ghost appears and they recognize him from his picture. Lewis says that he didn't come back to hurt them, and he can't even if he wanted to. He says that he knows they have a right to be angry at him, and he's come back to make amends and undo the curse.

Greta tells Jack that her home is down an alley. When he goes in, a gate drops down, trapping him. Greta transforms into her evil self, laughs in triumph, and says that Jack fell for a feeble trick. Jack realizes that Evil Greta is working with Lewis, who is loose upon the earth.

Lewis says that he'll need their help to undo the curse, and he can only stay in the real world until dawn and then he must return to his punishment in Hell. He says that he must undo the murder of his wife, his secret sin, and reveals a hidden doorway behind a bookcase before disappearing. The cousins enter the room beyond and find quarters. Lewis' ghost is standing beside a bed with the corpse of a woman. He says that it's Grace, his wife, and says that he killed her with his ambition and greed. Grace stood in the way of that, and Lewis needs the Amulet of Zohar from the vault. With the amulet, Lewis can fill Grace's soul. If they help him free her soul, Lewis will end the curse. Ryan and Micki agree and go to the vault.

Two men dressed for Halloween drive by, see Jack, park and get out, and come over to mock Jack.

Ryan and Micki get the amulet and Ryan figures they have nothing to lose and Lewis can't even touch them. They return to the hidden room and Lewis has them hold the Amulet next to Grace. The Amulet glows and jumps out of Micki's hand to Lewis', and Lewis turns solid. Ryan grabs Lewis, who easily knocks him aside and runs outside, sealing the door behind them and trapping them in the room. Lewis goes to the limo where Greta is waiting. She confirms that they have three hours until sunrise, and Lewis drives off with her.

The two men taunt Jack, who taunts them as peasants and invites them to come in and get him. They hook a chain up from their truck to the gate.

Micki keeps yelling for help until Ryan tells her to stop because she's giving him a headache. She wonders what Lewis is going to use the Amulet for, and Ryan gets an idea for how they can escape.

The two men pull out the gate enough for Jack to slip free. He then uses flash powder to escape the men.

Ryan and Micki escape through a vent and realize that Lewis is gone. Micki checks the manifest for the Amulet, and discovers that a spirit needs to take over a body to come back to life. The entry is in Old English, and all Micki can make out is that she needs to get into a body that died from a peaceful death. Ryan figures that Lewis is heading to a mortuary and looks for the closest one. They discover that Lewis took the car, and Micki leaves a note for Jack before they leave on foot.

Lewis and Greta pull up to a mortuary, and break in using the power of the Amulet. They look for a suitable corpse, and Ryan and Micki arrive outside, see the car, and realize Lewis is inside. A hearse pulls up, and Lewis and Greta come out. They take casket out and knock out the driver when protests, then take the coffin inside. Meanwhile, Ryan tries to pick the lock on the door and finally gets it open. He and Micki go inside.

Jack gets to the store and finds Micki's note. He takes his magic kit with him and goes to check mortuaries.

Ryan and Micki sneak in and find Lewis and Greta preforming a ritual on the corpse. They retreat down the hallway and consider what to do next. The cousins figure that if they get the Amulet, they'll render Lewis powerless. Ryan plans to go for the Amulet while Micki lures Greta away.

Micki goes into the chamber where Lewis is performing the ritual, says ""Sorry"", and runs out. Lewis sends Greta after her, and Micki ducks into a room with coffins. Greta soon finds Micki and magically levitates her into the air, then takes her back to Lewis.

Ryan sneaks into the chamber then tries to get the Amulet. Lewis shoves him across the room and Ryan runs out. Greta is there and entrances him, then leads him into a room and has him lie in a coffin. She locks it shut, then locks shut another coffin with an entranced Micki in it. Greta then sets both coffins on a roller belt going into a crematorium furnace and turns it on. Greta then returns to Lewis and tells him that she's giving their guests a ""warm welcome"".

Jack finds the mortuary and sees the car parked outside. He picks the lock on the door and goes inside.

Lewis continues performing the ritual, and Jack hears him and peers through the door. He then retreats and finds the crematorium, and pulls the coffins off the belt just in time. Jack says that the Amulet is too strong to stop, and all they can do is slow Lewis down until sunrise in eight minutes. He has Micki and Ryan distract Greta, a demon, while Jack slows Lewis down until dawn.

The cousins yell through the chamber door, and Lewis sends Greta after them. Micki and Ryan run off, and Jack goes into the chamber and tells Lewis that he must abide by his choice. Lewis says that he wouldn't have made his choice if he had known the punishment, and in Hell he dies over and over. Jack deflects Lewis' magical attack and says that he can't waste time trying to kill him.

Greta searches for the cousins, who are hiding in a storage vault. They run out and shove gurneys at Greta.

Jack casts spells to negate Lewis' ritual, and the two chant over the corpse.

Greta throw a chair at the cousins, missing and hitting a fuse box. The demon accidentally impales herself on a metal pipe, and she disappears in a flash of smoke. The cousins go to the chamber where Jack is on his knees, weakened. Lewis figures he has two minutes left, but Jack says that the cousins stopped the power and the clock on the wall. Micki opens the window letting the sunlight in, and Lewis is sent back to Hell.

Later back at Curious Goods, the trio clean up the debris from the party. Jack says that Lewis was married to Grace, she died and was buried, and they all lost a great friend. He waxes on about her beauty, and admits that he knew her better than he should have, but not as well as he dearly wished. Micki hopes that someone will talk about her that way, and Jack warns that in two weeks it will be Friday the 13th."

He secretly drugs her glass of champagne and they share a toast to the assistance she will provide him. As Collette passes out from the drugged drink, his assistant Robert Simpson knocks at the door and says they need Fahteem to go on early because another magician called in sick. Fahteem tells Robert not to interrupt him again and Robert leaves.

Collette is unconscious, and Fahteem tells her farewell. He then goes out on the club stage and performs his finale. He gets into the ""Cabinet of Doom"", while in his dressing room, Collette sleeps inside of a large cabinet. Meanwhile, Fahteem has said that two people have died accepting his challenge to survive the Cabinet. He has Robert put a dummy in the cabinet, then pulls a lever to drop sword blades into it.

Waking up, Collette yells for help but no one hears her.

Once the blades are pulled back up, the cabinet is opened to reveal the pierced dummy. Fahteem enters the cabinet and his assistant closes the door. Robert then pulls the lever and releases the blades. Collette is skewered while Fahteem is unharmed. Once the swords are pulled up, Fahteem emerges to applause from the audience.

Later, Fahteem is packing up the Cabinet of Death in the empty club. A figure emerges from the shadows and pulls the lever, despite Fahteem's protestations. The swords fall, piercing and killing him.

At Curious Goods, Jack is reading an article about Fahteem's death. He tells Ryan and Micki that Fahteem was one of the world's great magicians, and died in an accident three months ago. Jack explains that magicians were surprised by Fahteem's rise to prominence, and he did an illusion that was so dangerous that few magicians try it: the Cabinet of Doom. The older man explains the illusion, and how no one ever figured it out. Jack says that he used to do the Pendulum of Death, and it required impeccable timing and skill. Fahteem was killed, apparently when the armature with the blades slipped.

Jack mentions Fahteem's real name of Harvey Ringwald, and both he and Micki recognize it from the manifest. They find Ringwald listed as the purchaser of the Houdin Box. Jack explains that the box once belonged to the legendary French magician, Houdin. Houdin died trying to perfect it, and the article mentions that Robert now works for a magical supply house. Jack sends Ryan and Mick to talk to Robert, while he checks with some fellow magicians at the Temple of Magic to see what they know about Fahteem.

When the cousins meet with Robert, Robert says that he hasn't seen Fahteem's things since the accident. Ryan says that it's important they get the Box back, and Robert wonders why. Micki claims that they want it for sentimental reasons, and Robert says that Fahteem didn't have partners but flunkeys, and Fahteem never revealed his secrets to anyone. Last he heard, all of Fahteem's items were auctioned off. Robert says that he should have been the headliner and Fahteem the flunkey.

Once the cousins leave, Robert calls a man and says that someone is asking about the cabinet. He assures the man at the other end that he didn't tell anyone anything, and the man tells Robert to handle Micki and Ryan if they get in the way.

At the Temple of Magic, the staff are preparing for a televised magician's contest. Jack meets with a friend, Monte, who says the winner will get $100,000 and an invitation to the Magic Star Society. Monte tells Jack that Fahteem's equipment has already been dispersed, and only a lunatic like his assistant, Tommy, would try something so dangerous.

Micki and Ryan arrive, and Jack introduces them to Monte. Monte says that it's a closet set but invites them to come back during the next night's contest as his guests. Once Monte leaves, the cousins tell Jack that Fahteem and Robert weren't friends. A magician, Montarro, is berating his daughter Lyla that she has been nothing but a problem since her mother died. Monte comes over and tells Montarro that the auditorium is magicians only. Montarro introduces himself and says that his specialty is a death-defying act, the Coffin of Blood. It's the Cabinet of Doom, with a new paint job.

The trio return to the shop and Jack tells the cousins that whoever has the Houdin Box can be the best magician in the world. He figures they'll try to prove it in Monte's contest, and says that they're looking for something spectacular and death-defying. Micki figures that Montarro is a likely suspect, and Jack figures that they can get in with him as a magician, and the cousins as his assistants.

Jack gets his old magic props out, and later at the Temple tells Monte that he'll be performing the Pendulum of Doom. Monte refuses to let Jack endanger himself, but finally gives. After telling one magician practicing, Miranda, to get her act together, he says that Jack will have to audition like anyone else, and only the top five will qualify for the televised contest. Ryan goes to unload Jack's gear and check out the prop room.

Ran takes the gear into the prop room. He looks around and finds the Coffin of Blood., marked the property of the Great Montarro.

Miranda slips an envelope under the dressing room door of Montarro's dressing room and then leaves.

In his dressing room, Jack practices his escape while Micki times him. He's rusty, and Tommy secretly watches Jack practice. He sees Jack use a hidden key in the straitjacket to unlock the padlock on it and free himself. Micki says that it too Jack 85 seconds to escape when the rope burns in a minute, and Jack assures her it's faster upside down. Ryan comes in and tells them he found the Coffin and it belongs to Montarro. Jack figures that Montarro has his hands on some of Fahteem's equipment and goes to check on it with Montarro.

Later, Micki and Ryan are having drinks in the Temple bar. Montarro is complaining to Lyla about how someone is trying to blackmail him out of jealousy or greed, and tells Lyla to stay out of his business. He insists that it's his chance and he won't be denied.

Jack goes to the prop room to check out the Coffin.

Montarro leaves, and Ryan tells Micki that he'll tail the magician to make sure he doesn't barge in on Jack. Ryan says that Micki should keep an eye on Lyla and leaves. Micki approaches Lyla, who is crying.

Going to the stage, Montarro enters the cabinet there and closes the door behind him. Ryan, following him, opens the doors and discovers that Montarro has vanished.

Lyla thanks Micki for her friendliness, and says that her father is strict and might not let her meet with Micki afterward. She tells Micki that she really loves her father, and Micki invites her to the store. Lyla says that she's been on the road with Montarro since she was 16, and Micki asks her about the Coffin. The woman admits that she doesn't know much about it. Lyla asks why Micki is there, and Micki says that they're trying to win the $100,000 first prize.

Jack measures the Coffin and then hides inside of it when Montarro comes in. Ryan finds Montarro, and Montarro accuses Ryan of following him. He says that Ryan doesn't belong there, and Ryan asks for his autograph. As Montarro signs the piece of paper that Ryan provides, Ryan leans on the level controlling the armature and Jack sees him. As Ryan talks about Fahteem, Montarro finishes signing the autograph and tells him to leave. Jack sighs in relief as Ryan leaves the armature, and Montarro leaves behind him.

Emerging from the Coffin, Jack finds Ryan and Micki. Ryan says that he didn't know Jack was in the Coffin, Micki says that Lyla is terrified of her father and doesn't have a clue how he performs the Coffin, and Jack reports that there's no way out of the Coffin. They figure it's the Box, which explains Montarro's paranoia.

Later, a figure slips into Jack's dressing room and files through the extended part of the key in the straitjacket.

On the stage, Monte complains to Micki and Ryan that Jack hasn't shown up and the audition is in a few minutes. Ryan goes to check the gym and Micki checks Jack's dressing room. When they don't find him, they return to the stage and finds a hooded Jack in the straitjacket. Micki introduces the Pendulum of Death illusion as the assistants rig Jack up above a bed of spikes.

Micki sets the rope suspending Jack on fire. Jack frees one hand and uses the key, but the end breaks off because of the filing. Jack falls to his death on the spikes, and Ryan removes the hood to reveal that it's Tommy. Jack comes out and tells the cousins that Tommy locked him in the closet so he'd have a chance to perform. They check the key and discover it was filed through so that it would break, and realize Tommy's death was no accident. Micki figures that they're getting too close, and that Montarro was too obvious. She suggests that Miranda is the murderer, and she's been watching them closely.

The trio go to Miranda's dressing room and find her dead of hanging, an apparent suicide. Ryan removes ""her"" wig and they realize that it's Robert. There's no suicide note, and they suspect that Robert didn't kill himself. There's sawdust in the wig, and assistant Tony comes in, see Robert's dead body, and runs. Ryan chases him down, and Tony says that it was Robert's idea to blackmail Montarro. Jack demands answers, and says that it has something to do with the Box. Tony tells them that Robert tried to find out about the illusion from Fahteem, but Fahteem wouldn't tell him anything before his death. They figure Montarro killed Fahteem to get the Box, and Robert and Tony came there to find the Box and write their own ticket. Robert found it but never told Tony where it was, but he did send a note to Montarro to arrange terms so they would be the headliners in exchange for their silence. All Tony knows is that when Fahteem performed his illusion, someone had to be inside the box.

That night a half-hour before the contest begins, the trio figure that whoever using the box is just murdering. Jack goes to Monte to try and get him to postpone the contest, Micki goes to convince Lyla not to perform and stop the performance, while Ryan looks for Montarro figuring he's lining up another victim.

Micki finds Lyla on stage as Montarro checks the Coffin. Lyla says that she and her father are getting along pretty well, and Micki asks her not to help her father perform the Coffin so that he can't go on. She says that it's real magic, and says that Montarro has the Box. Lyla has seen it and takes Micki to see it. It's in the wine cellar, and when Micki gets in to check it, Lyla locks her inside. She boasts that she's the Great Montarro, and she made her father what he is. Lyla says that her father doesn't know what's going on with the Box, and no one is going to get in her way. She thanks Micki for ""helping"" her with the act, and says that Micki will be at the show in spirit before leaving.

Jack finds Monte backstage and tries to get him to postpone Montarro's act. Monte figures that it's jealousy and Jack says that Tommy was killed in place of him. Jack says that the murderer killed Robert and made it look like suicide, but Monte doesn't believe him. Ryan finds Jack and they both realize that Micki is gone, and go to talk to Lyla. Lyla claims that she hasn't seen Micki for a while and prepares to go on with her father. Ryan sees sawdust on Lyla's back and realizes it's the same as the sawdust on Robert's wig. It came from the dummy in the Coffin act, but the Montarros haven't done the act yet. Ryan remembers seeing the same sawdust in the wine cellar, and they figure Micki is there.

Monte comes out on stage and introduces Montarro, Meanwhile, Ryan and Jack find the Box in the wine cellar. Montarro enters the Coffin and Lyla pulls the armature lever. Jack manages to open the Box and Micki gets out just in time. Montarro is killed by the sword blades in the Coffin, and they return to the stage as Lyla screams in horror. Assistants get Montarro's corpse out of the Coffin and take the hysterical Lyla away.

Later at the store, Jack ties Ryan in a straitjacket and chains. Micki joins them and Ryan jokingly suggests that she could turn psycho just like Lyla. She cheerfully tightens the straitjacket, and Ryan says that he can get out. He has Micki time his escape, and Micki and Jack go to get some coffee while Ryan tries to escape without success."

The vendor offers the man flowers, and the man offers the vendor a large bill. It blows down the street on the wind, and the vendor goes after it down a nearby alley. Meanwhile, the man removes an antique scalpel from a case, goes down the alley, and cuts the vendor's throat with the scalpel. Passing people at the mouth of the alley see the murder, and the killer runs down the alley to a gate. He cuts through the bars with the scalpel and makes his escape.

The next day at Curious Goods, Jack reads an entry in the manifest about a Victorian surgical scalpel that Lewis sold, from the late 19th century. Jack and the cousins have read the newspaper report about the eyewitnesses reporting that the killer sliced through the gate using a scalpel, but Micki isn't convinced. Lewis sold it to James Bronson, and there's nothing else in the manifest that fits the eyewitnesses' description. Jack goes to do some research on Bronson before they visit him, and Micki finds a note in the manifest that the scalpel may have belonged to Jack the Ripper, when he committed his murders in the summer of 1888.

Later, the cousins drive to rendezvous with Jack outside of Bronson's blade shop. He joins them and says that Bronson is an ex-con still on parole, and he was convicted of an assault with a deadly weapon. Bronson was known as a craftsman with a blade, and they go into the shop. When they ask about antique knives, Bronson immediately says that he doesn't carry them. Jack describes the scalpel, and Bronson jams a finger between Jack's fingers on the counter and tells him not waste his time. He says that he doesn't remember buying an antique scalpel.

Micki yells from across the room, and Bronson blurts out that she couldn't have found it because she sold it. He refuses to identity the buyer, until Jack threatens to give some negative over to Bronson's parole officer. Bronson caves and say that he sold the scalpel two years ago to Dr. Vincent Howlett. Jack is familiar with Howlett, and the trio leaves. Outside, Jack tells the cousins that Howlett is known as the ""miracle man"" and has turned surgical into big business... for him. Howlett calls all of the most hopeless cases and cures them. As for the negatives, they're from Micki and Ryan at the zoo and Jack was bluffing.

At Ravenbrook Hospital where he now works, Howlett is giving a lecture to visiting doctors while performing an operation. He finishes the operation and the doctors applaud, and Jean Flappen is also in the observation gallery watching Howlett intensely. Afterward, Vince goes out into the hallway with the head of surgery, Dr. Patricia Price. Price introduces Howlett to the waiting doctors and welcomes Howlett to the hospital, congratulating him on his ""premiere"" surgery. Howlett gives a speech, noting that he hopes his skills can help the hospital's ""somewhat tarnished"" reputation. Price glares at him as he leaves.

As the trio drives to Ravenbrook, Jack says that he's heard the hospital has been having some setbacks and need Howlett to restore their reputation for outmoded equipment and poor patient care. There have been some malpractice suits filed against them, and minor scandals among the staff. Jack says that Howlett loves the limelight, but his critics say that he's turning medicine into a circus. He notes that Jack the Ripper was supposed to be a doctor.

Price asks Howlett what he does on his time off, and Howlett plays coy saying it's boring. She says that she remembers him from medical school when she his professor, and is surprised he became a surgeon. Howlett tells her that his track record speaks for itself, and asks if she's jealous of his reputation. Price says that she doesn't approve of his ""show biz"" approach to surgery, and he tells her that it works and then leaves. The woman from the operating gallery, Jean Flappen, secretly watches Howlett and then goes.

The trio arrive and Jack asks for Howlett. Micki sees an ER patient being given resuscitation measures

Jean puts up a photo of a girl on a door ahead of Howlett and runs off. Howlett sees the photo and tosses it on the floor, and Flappen steps out behind him and aims a revolver at him. The trio come by and Ryan pulls the gun up. Howlett doesn't hear her, and Jean yells that Howlett is a killer and they should let her kill Howlett before he kills again. Micki runs after Howlett, and orderlies take the screaming Jean away. Ryan goes after Micki and Howlett, and Jack checks Jean's discarded purse and finds an article about the death of her daughter.

Howlett goes to his office and Micki stands outside in the hallway.

The orderlies strap Jean to a bed and leave. Jack slips in and asks her about her daughter. Jean says that Howlett carved her up when she was in med school, and she worshiped Howlett. She heard Howlett was coming to town, went to where he was staying and said she would talk to him. Later, the police called Jean and said they found her daughter's carved-up body. Jean didn't know Howlett killed her, but she had to do something and started following him. Everywhere he went there was another killing, but he was too smart to make a slip and she couldn't let him go on. Jack asks about the weapon, saying that he's a friend, but he can't release her. Jean figures that Jack is in on it and yells that she'll kill him as he leaves.

Howlett looks at the scalpel contemplatively, and Micki comes in and claims that she's a supply staffer. She says that she's there to make sure he got everything he needs, then quickly leaves. Ryan is in the hallway outside, and Micki tells him that she saw the scalpel. Ryan sends her to tell Jack, who is in the waiting room. She goes to Ryan and tells him what she's discovered, and Jack worries that Howlett will go after Ryan if he suspects Ryan knows something.

After Howlett leaves his office and walks down the hallway, Ryan emerges from hiding and goes after the doctor. Howlett enters a wing of the hospital under construction and Ryan goes in after him. Meanwhile, Micki and Jack go into Howlett's office. Jack finds the scalpel case but the scalpel is gone. According to Howlett's surgery schedule, he's not down to operate again that day so Micki wonders where he went with the scalpel. Jack figures that Howlett is also using the scalpel to kill, and it gives him the power to cure. Killing people ""recharges"" the scalpel, and Micki and Jack figure Ryan is Howlett's next intended victim.

Ryan peers through a grate into an adjoining room, and sees Howlett opening a locker where he stores the scalpel.

Jack and Micki find a nurse, who says that she saw Howlett but doesn't know where he is. They see the door to the closet wing but figure Howlett didn't go there.

Howlett takes the coat and hat he wears when committing the murders out of the locker, as Ryan watches. Ryan slips on the box he's standing on, making a ruckus. He runs, and Howlett gets the scalpel and goes after him. Micki and Jack hear the noise and go into the closed wing. Meanwhile, Ryan goes into the old morgue and hides in one of the drawers. Howlett comes in and sees a drawer partially open. He yanks open the drawer and stabs the cloth-shrouded body inside.

Micki and Jack come in and Micki yells Ryan's name. Howlett runs out, while Micki confirms that the body wasn't Ryan's. Ryan yells to her from the drawer he's in, and Micki gets him out. Meanwhile, Jack chases Howlett to a freight elevator and tackles him. They struggle and Howlett shoves Jack into an open elevator. Jack grabs the cable, and Howlett slices through it with the scalpel. Jack falls down the shaft, and Howlett runs when he hears Micki and Ryan coming. They see Jack lying at the bottom of the shaft.

The doctors are summoned, and take Jack to an operating room. Price talks to the waiting Micki and Ryan, and asks if Jack has any family. They say that he's their family, and Price says that they may need one of them to sign the release for surgery. Once Price leaves, Ryan goes as well, telling Micki that he has to do something.

Price goes to Howlett's office and finds him standing in the darkness, contemplating the scalpel. She tells him that they need him to operate. Price says that the patient is no one important, and has no chance of living unless Howlett performs one of his ""miracles"". Howlett says that he can't operate that night, and Price tells him that he's there to improve the hospital's reputation and the press has gotten hold of Jack's case. They're there expecting to see the ""miracle man"" in action. Howlett agrees to perform the surgery at 8:30 when it's scheduled, and Price leaves.

Later, Howlett goes out looking for a victim.

Ryan goes to Jean's room. Meanwhile, Jean complains to the orderly on guard that her straps are too tight, and asks him to loosen them a tad. When he loans over to do so, Jean knocks him unconscious with a flower vase, takes his keys, and leaves.

Price visits Micki and says that Jack has an aortal aneurysm. She warns that it's almost already fatal, and the best surgeon in the country has agreed to do the surgery with Micki's consent. Micki realizes that Price is talking about Howlett.

Howlett approaches a skateboarder on his own. He pulls out the scalpel, but before he can attack the boy's friends arrive. They skate off and Howlett walks off, looking for another victim.

Ryan steals a set of doctor's scrubs.

When the nurse on duty is distracted, Jean breaks into the locker holding the patients' belongings. She gets her gun and clothing, and leaves.

Howlett approaches a prostitute and takes out the scalpel. His pager goes off and she runs into a nearby building. Angry, Howlett turns off his pager and walks off.

Jean dresses in the ladies room, then go out

Howlett returns to the hospital and scrubs up. Price berates him for running late, and when he sets the scalpel down on the sink, Ryan steals it and leaves. Howlett notices the theft, while Ryan goes back to Micki and tells him that he has the scalpel. She tells Ryan that he has to give the scalpel back so that Howlett can save Jack.

Howlett searches desperately for the scalpel. Price tells him to get hold of himself. Ryan comes in and gives Howlett the scalpel. Howlett and Price go into the operating room, and Price points out his ""admiring public"" in the gallery. When he holds the scalpel, Howlett hesitates and Price asks if anything is wrong. He tells her not to worry about him and says that he's not going to lose Jack or any patient ever again. Jack's face is covered, so Howlett doesn't realize he's operating on the man who attacked him earlier. Jean watches from the gallery.

Micki and Ryan wait in the waiting room, and Ryan talks about how he and his parents never got along. He says that Jack is the only one who ever acted like he had something on the ball.

The anesthetist removes the cloth on Jack's face, and Howlett realizes who he's operating on. When he hesitates, Price and the other operating staff look at him, puzzled. Howlett realizes that he can't let Jack die without risking his reputation, and goes back to operating.

Mick tells Jack that they can't let Howlett get away no matter what happens to Jack, because it isn't what Jack would want.

Howlett continues operating on Jack, and finally says that he's done. He tells the nurse that he'll supervise Jack's post-op personally.

Price tells Micki and Ryan that Jack survived the surgery. Ryan asks where Howlett is, claiming they want to thank him, and Price says that he's in scrubs and wanted to supervise the post-op personally.

Howlett goes to Jack's room and prepares to kill him, cutting through his respirator tube with the scalpel. Jean comes in, aiming her gun at Howlett, and tells him to face her. He does so, invites her to come closer, then slices through the gun with the scalpel. He cuts her hands, and Ryan and Micki hear her scream and run in.

When Howlett runs out, Ryan and Mick go after him. They chase him into the abandoned wing, and Howlett jumps on Ryan's back. He cuts through the garbage lid Micki is using as a shield, and the cousins run. Howlett goes after them, and they lock themselves in a boiler room. The doctor cuts a hole the metal door with the scalpel and comes in, and Jean comes up behind him and knocks him over the head.

The cousins run out and come to another dead end. Ryan grabs a crutch as a weapon, and tells Micki to hide behind a crash cart. Howlett arrives and finds both cousins gone. Ryan drops down from the steam pipes onto the doctor, and Mick shoves a storage bin onto Gorman's hand and head when he comes at Ryan with the scalpel. Micki charges up the paddles on the crash cart and when Gorman comes at her after punching Ryan unconscious, she uses them on the scalpel. Gorman is electrocuted and falls over. Ryan wakes up and turns Gorman comes over, and discovers that he fell on the scalpel and it plunged into his chest.

Later at the store, Micki tends to the recovering Jack. She assures him that they put the scalpel in the vault, and Ryan returns from the airport and that Jean is heading back home. Jack says that it's time to go back to work, despite the doctors' advice that he take it easy. The cousins side with the doctors and tell Jack to relax, and Ryan points out that with Howlett out of the way, he won't be sending Jack a bill."

The janitor, Tommy Dunn, looks on, and one boxer sarcastically calls him ""tough guy"". Tommy goes into Manny's office and takes a pair of antique boxing gloves out of a box, and looks at them. Manny comes in and asks Tommy what he's doing, Tommy asks if he can borrow the gloves, saying that they belonged to Killer Kelsey. Manny asks if he's going to use them to beat up somebody who owes money, and Tommy insists that he did his time as an enforced and doesn't do it anymore. When Manny yanks the gloves back, Tommy says that Manny is just like the rest of them and won't give him a break. Manny tells Tommy that he's no boxer, and tells him to get out of his office and sweep the floor.

Later, Cornelius is heading out and sees Tommy working out with a rope. Tommy tells Cornelius that he's still hoping to get a shot at him, and Cornelius says that he wouldn't waste his time and Tommy is a lost cause. Tommy watches Cornelius talk to Manny before he goes, and later steals the gloves. He goes to the locker room and puts them on, and Manny yells to him from the door that he's going home. Manny tells Tommy to keep his nose clean and leaves, and Tommy throws air-punches with the gloves. His hands shake and he is pulled toward the wall. When the gloves touch the gloves that his shadow is ""wearing"", the shadow separates from the wall and walks out.

Manny walks down an alleyway on his way home, and the shadow comes up behind him. Tommy can sense what the shadow senses and whispers Manny's name. Manny hears the voice and sees the shadow, and recognizes it as Tommy's. The shadow cuts off Manny as he tries to walk out of the alley, then corners Manny in a dead-end.

In the gym, Tommy works out a bag. He punches it off its hinges, and in the alleyway the shadow beats Manny to death.

In the alleyway, the dying Manny writes ""To"" in his own blood on a nearby piece of cardboard.

The next day at the store, Micki takes a photo of Ryan with a flash bulb attachment. She says that she's making a photo diary for Lloyd. Jack gets a call from Manny's widow asking them to look at her dead husband's boxing memorabilia. She called them because Manny bought some stuff from Lewis, like the gloves. The gloves are listed in the manifest, and the original owner Kelsey killed an opponent in his ring. Jack was at the fight, and Kelsey hung up the gloves, ""went strange"", and never threw another punch.

The trio go to Manny's Gym and Micki takes photo. Ryan and Jack go through Manny's things and discover that the gloves aren't there. Manny's widow Sadie comes in and talks about how Manny wanted to start a boxing museum. Micki joins them and asks how Manny died, and Sadie says that he was beaten to death in a nearby alley. There were only one set of footprints at the scene of the crime, and they found the letters ""To"" written nearby.

Micki continues taking photos, including of boxer Tony Terrific. Tommy comes over and shoves Tony aside, and invites Micki to take photos of him. She isn't impressed, and Cornelius comes over and tells Tommy to get lost. Tommy tells him to mind his own business and Tommy invites him to say it to him in the ring. Unimpressed, Cornelius says that he won't waste his time with Tommy. After Tommy leaves, Micki thanks Cornelius and they introduce themselves. She checks his gloves, just like she checked Tony's, looking for the ""Killer"" stamped on them like were stamped on the cursed gloves. Cornelius says that Tommy has had more losses as a boxer than anyone in the city. Micki thanks Cornelius for his help and takes a photo of him as he walks away.

That night at his fight, outside, Tommy invites Tony to come in and see him fight. Tony dismisses Tommy, and Tony says that Tommy will never know what hit him. Tommy shrugs off his gibe and goes inside, laughing. Jack is nearby and overhears the exchange.

In the locker room, Tommy goes by himself and releases the shadow. Tommy then goes out in the ring and fights with his opponent. Outside, the shadow confronts Tony and beats him to death. Inside, Tommy beats his opponent with the power of the gloves, shrugging off his opponent's blows. Ryan, Micki, and Jack are there and look on as Tommy wins. Micki snaps a photo of Tommy's gloves and sees the ""Killer"" stamped on them. She tells Ryan and Jack that Tommy is wearing the gloves, and Jack figures that Manny was trying to leave Tommy's name in his blood.

A man runs in and yells that Tony is dead, beaten to death and left on the hood of a car. Tommy has left the ring, and Ryan goes to check Tommy's locker for the gloves. Ryan breaks into the locket and finds a medical report on Tommy. Cornelius comes over and asks Ryan if he's looking for something. Ryan claims that he gave his wallet to Tommy to hold, but Cornelius doesn't believe him and finds Ryan's wallet in his back pocket. The boxer gives Ryan the wallet and tells him to get out.

The trio go to the apartment building where Tommy lives. Micki gets an idea and goes to a nearby pay phone. She calls Tommy and suggests they go for coffee. Tommy agrees and leaves, and Ryan and Jack break into Tommy's apartment while Micki goes to the nearby diner where she agreed to meet Tommy. She picks at her food to stall, and Tommy invites her back to his place for a ""nightcap"". Micki turns on the charm, and Tommy says that he can't lose at anything. She tries to beg off, saying she has to work, but Tommy figures she's playing him as a sucker and grabs her arm. Tommy tosses down money for the tab and goes back to his apartment.

Micki goes to the phone booth and calls Tommy's apartment. Ryan and Jack don't pick the phone up, but they hear Tommy come in and hide. Tommy realizes someone has been searching his place and spots them, and figures that Micki was trying to distract him. He grabs the gloves from a hidden hole in the wall, knocks Ryan down, and shoves Jack out of the apartment.

In the alleyway near Micki, the shadow appears.

Tommy advances on Ryan and throws a punch at him, and Ryan ducks. Meanwhile, Micki uses her flash attachment on the shadow. It's blinded, and so is Tommy. The attachment recharges, and Ryan tries to grab the gloves from Tommy. He fails and runs out, and on the street below the shadow fades away. Micki joins Jack and Ryan as they come out, and she says that she has to get the film from her camera developed.

Back at the store, Micki tells Jack what she saw. Ryan gets the photos developed and when the trio go over them, the shadow isn't there. Jack finds a shot of it and Micki figures that it was when the flash didn't work. The older man suggests that when Tommy wears the gloves, his shadow goes after his victims. His dark side is unleashed by the gloves, and they figure that someone else will be murdered the next time Tommy goes into the ring.

Tommy goes to the gym and everyone congratulates him. He challenged Cornelius to a fight, but Cornelius refuses. Meanwhile, the trio arrive and Jack figures Tommy won't let the gloves out of his sight. Cornelius hears them talking about how Tommy killed Manny and Tony, and he confronts Tommy and punches him in the face. He tells Tommy that he'll fight them that night, and Tommy promises that he'll be there with his gloves on. The trio overhear his confrontation and confront him, and Micki tells Cornelius that he can't fight Tommy but can't explain why. Cornelius says that he agrees with them that Tommy killed Manny, and Manny was like a father to him. Once Cornelius leaves, Jack figures they have to make sure no one gets killed.

That night, everyone gathers for the fight. The trio are in the audience, and Jack tells Ryan to wait for his opportunity. He then goes into the locker room and tells Tommy that he knows about the gloves. Jack claims that he saw Tommy steal the gloves, and threatens to go to the cops. He says that Tommy gets to keep the gloves while Jack gets 70% of Tommy's winnings. Smirking, Tommy agrees and tells him to wait for him out in the parking lot.

Jack goes out to the parking lot where Micki is waiting, and says that they have to use Tommy's rage against him. Inside, Tommy unleashes the shadow then goes to the ring. Jack comes in and taunts Tommy, and Tommy and Cornelius fight.

Jack goes outside and the shadow comes after him.

Tommy rallies and starts beating Cornelius.

Micki uses a bright flashlight on the shadow. Inside, Tommy is blinded and Cornelius beats him. Outside, the shadow disappears in the bright light and inside, Cornelius beats Tommy. The shadow comes after Micki and Jack, and the flashlight battery fades. It knocks the light out of her hand, and Jack taunts the shadow over to him. Micki pulls the car over and blinds the shadow with the headlights, and Cornelius finishes off Tommy. Ryan jumps into the ring and grabs the gloves from Tommy, while everyone cheers Cornelius.

Back at the store, Ryan puts the gloves in the vault. Micki says that what they did wasn't enough, and Tommy will get away with killing two people. Ryan points out that Tommy has a perfect alibi, and Micki goes to her bedroom and tries to sleep. Ryan comes to her door and asks if she's all right. She says that she is and turns down his offer of cocoa.

Tommy breaks into Micki's room and puts a knife to her face. He demands his gloves, then takes her with them to go get them. Ryan hears them and calls to Micki, going out. Micki breaks free of Tommy, and Tommy threatens Ryan with his knife. He grabs Micki and tells Ryan to get the gloves or he'll cut her. Jack comes in and begs Tommy not to hurt Micki. Ryan goes to get the gloves, and Jack tries to move in on Tommy but Tommy spots him and invites him to try it.

When Tommy prepares to stab Micki anyway, she yells that he's hurting him, breaking his concentration. Jack points out that Tommy has no alibi, but nobody can prove anything up to now and he's outsmarted everyone. If Tommy kills them, the authorities will know. Tommy figures that he's a nobody without the gloves, and figures the trio stepped on him just like everyone else.

Ryan returns with one of the gloves, his other hand behind his back. Tommy realizes that there's only one glove and demands the other one, and Ryan hits Jack with his other glove-clad hand. Ryan's shadow appears and beats Tommy, while Ryan beats Jack. Micki tries to pull the glove off of Ryan's hand, and he gives it up. His cousin goes to Jack, and Ryan insists that he had to put on the glove to save Micki. Jack recovers and tells Ryan that it was the stupidest thing he's ever done, and Micki goes to call an ambulance for Tommy. Meanwhile, Jack looks at the unconscious Tommy and says that sometimes a person brings justice on themselves.

The next day, Cornelius brings Tommy things to the shelf. The commission confirmed that Cornelius' fight had nothing to do with Tommy being hurt, and Tommy had scar tissue on the brain from all the head shots he took in the past. Cornelius says that it felt like he would be doing something for Manny when he beat Tommy, but Manny would have had nothing to do with it. Micki says that Tommy just came over and started shouting, then collapsed. Cornelius says that he's going to run Manny's Gym for Sadie and leaves. Jack tells Ryan that he holds Ryan responsible for what happened to him, and half-jokingly promises revenge."

Smitty is throwing branches into the mulcher when Adrian comes over and says that he's finished. Adrian looks at the mulcher's swirling blades, fascinated, and Smitty asks if he's okay. After a moment, Adrian tears himself away from the machine and goes back to work.

Jack and Micki go into the house, while a man secretly watches them go in. Micki knocks over a board and screams in shock, and Jack finds a $5 bill nearby. Meanwhile, the man comes in wielding a crowbar. He asks Jack and Micki what they're doing there, and Jack explains that they're looking for Harley and sold an antique to him that they'd like to get back.

The neighbor has them step outside slowly and checks their business card. The man says that he looks after the place, and Harley was an accountant talking about financial futures. Several months ago Harley was locked up, after he was found with a bag of money and it was confirmed his mother was missing. Some folks say that Harley murdered his mother, and he started screaming about ""the mouth of hell"" when the police questioned him about his mother's disappearance. Harley attacked the police and was locked up.

On the Pierson grounds, Adrian looks at the mulcher. He tells Smitty that he'll finish up on his own so Smitty can go home early, and insists that he wants to make a good impression. A group of vagrants are sitting nearby, the leader drinking and watching the two gardeners. Smitty drives off, and Adrian goes to the mulcher. It starts up on its own and Adrian stares into the swirling blades. The vagrant leader calls to Adrian by name and comes over. He says that there's a lot of interest on Adrian on the streets, because he owes too much to the wrong people.

Adrian insists that he's good for it, and the vagrant tells him to tell the legbreakers that will come for him. He figures Adrian wants to pay him to stay quiet, and asks for $500 a week for his quiet. Adrian says that he'll kill the vagrant if he opens his mouth, and the mulcher starts up on its own. The vagrant tells Adrian that he's a pretty boy and is all talk. Adrian knocks the vagrant unconscious with the man's own bottle, then shoves him into the mulcher. Dollar bills shoot out of the other end, and Adrian gleefully pockets them, laughing.

That night at the store, Jack tells the cousins that the mulcher was sold at a police auction three months ago. A Robert Smith bought it, and Jack is trying to track him down. Ryan is worried about Micki, and says that Lloyd is a dork. Jack examines the bill he found and says that it's brand new but dated 1937. The $100 bill Harley sent to Lewis is also dated 1937 and brand new, and suggests that Harley might talk to Lewis. As for Micki, Jack tells Ryan that she'll have to work out her issues all by herself.

Micki is making herself up for bed as a man lurks outside her window. She sees the man's shadow on the drapes, goes to Ryan's room, and tell him that there's an intruder outside her window. The man breaks in through the window, and Ryan shoves him to the floor and starts choking him. Micki stops Ryan, realizing that the intruder is Lloyd. She hugs him, and Ryan introduces himself and points out that most people use the front door.

Micki has Ryan leave, and Lloyd explains that he flew out to take some dispositions. He says that he felt he didn't have a choice but to spy on Micki, to find out if there was another man in her life. Ryan listens at the door as Micki points out that Ryan is her cousin and nothing could be stranger than being involved with her. Lloyd wonders why Micki hasn't sold the shop yet, and Micki says that the store has been turning her life inside out. Her fiancé offers his legal expertise, and Micki says that it's about misplaced inventory. She says that she'll be home soon, but Lloyd tells her that he can't marry someone who isn't 100% honest with him. With that, Lloyd leaves the way he came.

The next day, Ryan visits Amanda at her home. She says that her husband deserves the credit for the beautiful grounds, and Ryan explains that he's with an antique store and wanted to buy the mulcher from Robert Smith: Smitty. Amanda directs Ryan to Smitty, and Ryan and Micki approaches the gardener. Micki is distracted by Lloyd, and doesn't believe it when Ryan says that things worked out for best between Micki and Lloyd.

The cousins talk to Smitty, who says that he has a vintage 1937 mulcher. He tells them that the mulcher isn't for sale, but agrees when Ryan offers him $2,500. Once Smitty goes to get it, Micki complains that they don't have $2,500. Meanwhile, Smitty goes to the mulcher, and Adrian calls him into the tool shed he's in to get Smitty's help. Smitty goes in, and Adrian kills him with a shovel. He then goes to get the mulcher, but when he returns he discovers that Smitty is gone.

Adrian grabs a trowel and searches for Smitty, who jumps at him. The younger man stabs Smitty to death with the trowel, then feeds Smitty's body into the mulcher and collects the bills that shoot out of the output pipe.

Jack goes to the mental hospital where Harley is locked up, and claims Lewis asked him to stop by and say hello. He shows Harley the two bills, but Harley tells Jack that he doesn't know him and orders him out. Jack tells him that Lewis is dead, getting Harley's attention, and says that he and Lewis were partners. Lewis tried to go back on his pact with Satan and was killed for it. Jack says that he wants to use the mulcher like Harley did, and he can use it out of the hospital and will share the money with Harley. Harley rambles about investing and says that if he agrees, Jack must choose more ""expensive"" victims. He laughs manically and twirls around in his wheelchair.

That night, Ryan and Micki return to the store and tell Jack that they found Smitty but he disappeared when he went to get the mulcher. Jack hushes them as Lloyd stands up and demands to know what's going on. Micki takes Lloyd to the basement to show him the cursed antiques.

Ryan talks to Jack, who says that the wealthier the victim, the more money the mulcher produces from them. When Jack wonders why the money is minted 1937, Ryan tells him that was when the mulcher was built. Jack wonders if Lloyd will believe Micki, but Ryan figures he won't.

Micki takes Lloyd into the vault and asks him to trust her. She insists that it's no fantasy, and tells Lloyd to put the doll down when he picks it up. It moves when Lloyd isn't looking, but Micki sees it and tells him that he has to get out. Lloyd agrees and they go upstairs to the front door. Once Lloyd leaves, Micki goes to her room. When Ryan starts to go after her, Jack tells him to give Micki some time.

The next day, Ryan and Jack go to the garden posing as volunteer gardeners. Jack checks around and confirms that Smitty never left the grounds, and suggests that Smitty is a victim. Adrian secretly watches them and listens in as they talk about Smitty.

Micki is lying on her bed, and Lloyd sneaks into the shop and comes up to her room. He says that he doesn't want to lose her.

Charles asks Adrian if he's seen Smitty, and Adrian says that Smitty is over by the shed. Charles insists on going on his own, and Adrian runs ahead of him.

Micki and Lloyd share a bottle of wine. Lloyd says that he believes Micki believes in the curse, and tells Micki that imagination is a powerful thing.

Adrian takes the mulcher out of its hiding spot in the trees and starts it up. He then goes into the shed and gets a hand scythe, as Charles arrives outside.

Lloyd asks Micki to come home with him the next day, and then they'll get things back the way they were. He figures that if Micki stays there, she wants to call off the wedding. Micki stares at Lloyd, contemplating.

Charles goes into the shed, calling for Smitty. Adrian kills him with the hand scythe then feeds him into the mulcher. Charles isn't dead, and screams as he's fed into the blades. Laughing, Adrian watches Charles die.

Micki and Lloyd kiss, and Micki tells him that she's coming home.

Amanda leads a group around the memorial for her late husband. She sees Adrian working and asks his name, and says that he's doing a fine job. As she move son with the group, Adrian takes out a bill from Charles and sniffs it, then puts it into his bag with the other bills as he looks at Amanda contemplatively.

That night, Ryan goes to the kitchen to wash up. Micki comes in humming with Lloyd, and Lloyd says that he'll pick her up the next day at noon and the plane leaves at 2. Once Lloyd goes, Ryan says that he's been pulling weeds trying to find a murderer, and Micki was in bed with Lloyd. He points out that the two of them sold some of the cursed antiques that are in the world, and Mick insists they did it in ignorance. Ryan says that they still have a responsibility, and Micki says that Ryan is only living there because he likes it. She wonders why she has to sacrifice her life for the antiques and the store, and Ryan points out that she has nothing to sacrifice except for the ""snot-nosed"" Lloyd. Micki slaps Ryan, who tells her that they need her to make the whole thing work out. He says that he needs her, and Micki says that she's sorry and walks out.

The next day, Ryan and Jack return to the garden. Jack checks with gardeners and confirms that there's no sign of Smitty. He realizes that Ryan is depressed and says that he'll miss Micki as well, but there's nothing they can do about it if her heart isn't in it. Ryan agrees and says that he has to do something, and they split up to search the house and grounds.

Ryan finds Adrian's bag with the bills inside, each with a 1937 date. Adrian sees Ryan and goes into the shed, and Ryan runs off to find Jack. On the way he sees Charles' discarded glasses and pockets them. He finds the mulcher hidden nearby in the trees, and Adrian finds him and stabs at him with an awl. Ryan narrowly avoids the blow and runs off, and Adrian chases him.

While passing the memorial, Ryan trips and knocks himself out when he hits his head. Adrian drags him to the gardening shed and locks the unconscious Ryan inside.

While waiting for Ryan to show up, Jack sees Micki arrive in a taxi with Lloyd. She goes over to Jack and says that she had to say goodbye before going. Jack hugs her and wishes her a safe journey, and Micki wonders where Ryan is.

Adrian recovers his awl and runs off.

When Jack tells Micki that Ryan disappeared, she insists on going to look for cousin. Lloyd figures that Jack set the whole thing up to keep Micki from leaving, and Micki points out that Jack didn't know she was coming.

Adrian drives a garden truck, towing the mulcher, to the manor. As Adrian goes up to the manor, Jack spots him and asks if he's seen Ryan. Adrian abruptly says that he hasn't and continues on his way. Jack goes the way Adrian came from, and sees the mulcher hooked up to the cart. Ryan is calling for help from the shed, and Jack hears him, runs over, and releases him. Ryan describes Adrian, and Jack realizes that he just talked to the killer, who is going after Amanda as the richest person there.

Adrian breaks into Amanda's office, and she recognizes him from earlier. He says that she can set him up for life, and Amanda screams. Micki hears the screams and runs in, while Adrian tells Amanda to shut up. She comes in with Lloyd and they see Adrian threatening Amanda, and Adrian grabs Amanda as a shield and yells at them to get back.

Adrian takes Amanda to the mulcher, and Micki and Lloyd follow them. Ryan and Jack see Adrian coming and hide behind the cart. Ryan grabs the bag of money, tells Jack to distract Adrian, and runs off. Jack yells at Adrian that they know about the mulcher and it's over, but Adrian figures that he's still a rich man. Ryan starts up the mulcher and dumps the money from the bag in. Adrian releases Amanda, jumps into the mulcher chute to grab the money and is pulled in by the blades. Micki checks on Ryan, who hugs her in relief. Nothing but blood comes out of the output chute, and Jack figures Adrian wasn't even worth a dollar.

Later at the shop, Lloyd tells Micki that they saw a tragedy. Jack and Ryan have Micki involved in something dangerous. She says that it's what she does, and she has a responsibility to get back all the things they sold. Lloyd dismisses Ryan as a commercial school dropout, while Ryan listens in while cleaning. Micki tells Lloyd that if he cared about her, he'd try to understand. She insists that at least Ryan is honest and cares, and turns away from Lloyd. Lloyd leaves, and Micki tells Ryan to leave her alone and goes up to her room.

Ryan follows Micki to her door and asks if there's anything he can do. She yells at him to leave her alone, and he goes to his room. He puts up a banner welcoming Micki home, as Micki comes in and apologizes for yelling at him. She sees the banner, smiles, and thanks Ryan."

He sees a rare copy of ""Tales of the Undead"" Issue One on display by the owner, Charlie Evans. The cover displays the comics hero, Ferrus. Cal goes over to Charlie to buy his comic books, and they discuss Ooo's fascination with Ferrus. Charlie says that the creator, Jay Star, signed the issue. The owner says that the issue has been appraised as priceless, and Cal says that he'd kill for a comic like that. Charlie figures that he'll get at least $25,000 for it and invites Cal to sign up for the shop's free-comics-for-a-year contest. Cal says that 'Tales of the Undead' is the only comic he wants, and Charlie tells him that Cal has no chance of getting 'Tales'.

Cal signs up the contest and puts his name on a slip that he puts into the entry box. Ryan comes in and Charlie greets him by name, and Ryan says that Jack flew to Singapore so he has to run Curious Goods by himself. Charlie shows him the 'Tales' issue, that Cal is staring at. Ferrus is Ryan's favorite, and Charlie says that he got it at an estate sale. Charlie shows off Jay's signature, and says that he's selling it at auction at that Briggs is holding in two days.

As Charlie and Ryan go back to the counter, Cal breaks into the case holding issue one, while Ryan goes into the back room. Charlie sees Call and goes over to confront him, and Cal screams that he has to have it, shoves Cal away, breaks the glass of the case with his arm, and grabs the comic. Charlie goes to call the cops, and the room shakes as Cal transforms into the robot-like Ferrus. Ferrus chokes Charlie to death, throws away the body, and goes on a rampage. Ryan sees what's going on, runs in, and Ferrus knocks him aside before walking out the back.

The next day at the store, Ryan examines a piece of metal that came off of Ferrus's suit, while Micki looks on. She's skeptical of his claim that a comic book character beat him up, but Ryan insists that it was Ferrus, not a guy in a suit. Ryan says that in the first issue of the comic, a kid got the Ferrus powers the same way from a magic book. Micki checks the manifest under ""Magazines"", and discovers that Lewis bought it from Jacob Starenski. Ryan realizes that it's the real name of ""Jay Star"", the creator of Ferrus, which built Peerless Comics single-handedly. Jay wrote Ferrus for a few years and then disappeared, and supposedly died in poverty, a broken man. The date is recent and the seller's address is listed, Ryan has Micki go the store and check with the cops, while he investigates the seller.

Ryan drives to Jay's home, off in the country. The house maid, Mrs. Forbes, tells Ryan that Jay doesn't take visitors, particularly who she assumes is a reporter looking for a story on the 40th anniversary of Ferrus's premiere. When Ryan yells through the door that he's a fan, Jay hears him and tells Forbes to let Ryan in.

The embittered old Jay tells Ryan not to mind Forbes, saying that she's been taking care of him for years. He dismisses himself as a worn-out old man and a has-been, and says that his name is hardly reverted. Ryan talks about how he started because of Jay, and asks for Jay's autograph. Once Jay gives it, he asks Ryan why he's there. Ryan sees a comic book artist award nearby, from 1947, and Jay says that it was for the appearance of Ferrus. As Jay talks about Ferrus was going to be his passport to fame and money, Ryan asks him if he knows anyone so obsessed with Ferrus that he would kill over the comic book.

Jay says that he doesn't know anyone except for an editor or two in the old days. Forbes, listening in, says that Peerless cheated Jay out of his money. Jay abruptly dismisses her, and then tells Ryan that they stole and connived their way to the top on his work. Peerless got everything except a few old issues that Jay kept and later sold, and some original art: censored scenes that Jay keeps in the basement as insurance against a ""cold day"".

When Jay says that he's seen cruel miracles and nothing could surprise him, Ryan tells him that Ferrus has come to life. He explains that an original issue became cursed and lets the holder transform into Ferrus, and Charlies was killed. Jay knows Charlie and says that he has one of the best collections in the city. Jay laughs at the idea that it sounds crazy.

Ryan leaves, and Jay tells Forbes to get him his coat. He goes to the store where Charlie's daughter Linda is packing things up, and offers his condolences on Charlie's death. Jay goes through the entry box and finds the slip with Cal's name on it, with 'Tales of the Undead' as the issue he wants to receive a year of . It also has Cal's address on it, and Jay takes the slip with him.

At this apartment, Cal is calling Carmine DeMaddio to sell Ferrus himself. As Carmine hangs up, Jay comes in via the open door and says that he and Carmine go way back. Jay presents proof of who he is and Cal is awe-struck. The artist demands the comic, saying that it was his to begin with and it was stolen from him. Cal picks up the comic and begs Jay not to make him do something he doesn't want to do. Jay says that he won't end up like Charlie and threatens to tell the authorities. Cal transforms into Ferrus and advances on Jay, who takes an award from beneath his jacket and stabs Ferrus in the chest. Ferrus collapses to the floor and transforms into the dead Cal, and Jay takes the comic and leaves.

At the store, Ryan tells Micki that he was humiliated by Jay laughing at him. He thought Jay would at least believe in the possibility of the supernatural. Micki doesn't get the appeal of Ferrus, and Ryan talks about how comics inspired little kids like himself. His cousin sympathizes and goes back to reading the comic, and lists of Ferrus' powers. Ryan is reading the newspaper and sees an article about Cal's death.

The cousins go to Cal's apartment and search through the debris. Micki finds Carmine's name written on a pad, and Ryan recognizes him as the publisher of 'Tales of the Undead'. Ryan and Micki go to Carmine's office, and he freely admits that Cal called him. He says that Jay sold his rights to Ferrus in 1948 but then lost the money in a land swindle. Jay tried to kill Ferrus off, coming up with some way to kill ""Ferrus the Invincible"". Peerless never published the issue, and Carmine doesn't remember where the pages are. Carmine says that they'll never publish the ""death of"" issue, but suggests that the issue might show up at the auction.

Later, Jay comes to Carmine's office Jay says that he's there to stake a claim on Ferrus, and sees a panel of Jay's artwork. Carmine says that he bought it, and Jay angrily tells the publisher that it's his and he never sold it. He accuses Carmine of stealing it like everything in his life, and promises that he's going to get back. Jay uses the comic to transform into Ferrus, and Carmine runs and sets off the fire alarm. Carmine then gets into the freight elevator, and before it can go down Ferrus smashes in through the door and chokes Carmine to death.

Ryan and Micki hear the fire alarm and see that the elevator is still on the floor with Carmine's office. The elevator comes down with Ferrus in it along with Carmine's broken body. The cousins hide before Ferrus sees them, and Ferrus walks past them. The police arrive outside, and the cousins follow Ferrus out. The police open fire, but the bullet impacts knock Ferrus down. Once the police go back to their cars to call it in, Ferrus gets up, unharmed, and walks off.

Back at the store, Micki says that they have to find the comics. Ryan wonders how they will stop Ferrus if he's bulletproof, and figures the comic that ""kills"" Ferrus holds the secret of Ferrus' vulnerability. He suggests they go to Jay to get the issue.

The cousins drive to Jay's house and Forbes answers the door. Jay hears Ryan and tells Forbes to have Ryan go away. When Ryan yells that he saw Ferris, Jay changes his mind and dismisses Forbes. Once Forbes leaves, Jay insists that there is no Ferrus. Ryan says that he saw Ferrus and he was shot down and walked away. Jay confirms that Ryan didn't tell the police anything, and Ryan asks him for the issue where Jay killed off Ferrus or any notes he might have. The artist claims that he would have sold the issue ago, and doesn't remember anything. Jay tells Ryan to go, and Ryan leaves.

Out in the car, Micki suggests that they check Briggs Art Gallery to see if the issue has turned up there.

Jay goes through the old issues he kept, and discovers that the ""death of"" issue is gone. Forbes confronts him and says that he couldn't have left well enough alone. She admits that she sold the issue to raise the money, and she didn't stick around because she loved Jay. Forbes goes to pack, and Jay says that she doesn't have to go if she doesn't want to. First, Jay asks who she sold the issue to. Forbes says that she sold it to a dealer, Ted Hailey, who bought it for the auction. She assures Jay that she wouldn't have kept any of the money for herself. As she picks up the issues Jay tore through, Jay uses the cursed comic to transform into Ferrus and kills her.

Micki and Ryan go to the auction house and talk to Mr. Briggs. They say that they're looking for the secret issue, and Briggs tells him that it should be there any minute and it is on the list. The owner is waiting until the last minute to bring it in. Briggs refuses to tell them who the owner is, citing confidentiality. Once Briggs leaves, Micki sneaks a look at his list and gets the owner's name. Ryan goes through Briggs' Rolodex and finds Hailey's address.

As the cousins drive to Hailey's address, they find Hailey's car. Hailey is dead and thrown through the windshield. The secret issue is gone, and one of Jay's heart pills is on the pavement. Ryan recognizes it from earlier when he saw Jay.

Ryan and Micki drive to Jay's house and peer in through the window. They see Jay burning the stolen issues in the fireplace, and Micki knocks at the front door. Jay goes to answer it, and Ryan breaks the window glass. The artist hears him and goes back to the fireplace, and throws the remaining issues into the fireplace. He grabs a poker and threatens Ryan, while Micki grabs the cursed comic from a nearby table next to the pointed award.

Jay confronts Micki, and Ryan grabs the secret issue out of the fireplace. When Micki drops the comic book, Jay grabs it and transforms into Ferrus. The secret issue shows the hero killing Ferrus with the award. Ryan picks up the award from the table and kills Ferrus with it. Ferrus collapses to the floor and transforms back into Jay. Dying, Jay asks Ryan how it feels to be a hero

Later, Micki tells Ryan that she's reading through his comics. She suggests that they go to a comic art festival, and looks at the award Ryan has kept. Ryan irritably tells her to leave him alone, and Micki says that she's sorry about what happened. Micki has cut out a photo of Jay and gives it to Ryan, and Ryan says that he never wanted to be a hero but just an artist. He offers to show Micki his drawings, and they joke about Ryan ""showing her his etchings""."

David is going through his bills and tells Jordy that they're going to pay off all of them but it will take almost everything they have. He admits that their last crop was a disappointment but insists that they can't split them up. Jordy says that his dead wife is up in Heaven, looking out for them.

Outside, Marge Longacre, wearing a raincoat, watches the house. She goes to a nearby scarecrow with a photo of David pinned to its chest, and the scarecrow's head nods as it comes to life.

David puts Jordy to bed, and Jordy hugs his father before he goes into his bedroom. Downstairs, David senses something wrong and opens the backdoor. The scarecrow is there, wielding a scythe. When it moves toward David, David slams the door shut. Jordy hears the noise and looks down the stairs. Below, the scarecrow teleports into the house and kills David, cutting off his head.

Marge comes in as Jordy hides, and she picks up David's head and leaves.

The next day, Marge holds her arms up to the rising sun and smiles.

Later, Ryan and Micki drive to the nearby farming community of Riverdale. Ryan sent out mailers all over the country asking about the scarecrow listed in the manifest. Charlie Cobean responded to one mailer, asking them to come get the scarecrow. There's a postcard from Jack in Singapore, saying that it will take him another week before he finds the Icarus Feather.

In Riverdale, Ryan gets directions to the Cobean farm. Micki tosses Ryan an old baseball that she found in the store. It's signed from Ryan to Jimmy, and Ryan snaps at her for bringing it and then dismisses it as nothing. They talk to Charlie and his wife Tudy, and Charlie says that he's never heard of them and didn't write the note. Tudy blurts out that they bought the scarecrow from Lewis, and Charlie says that it burned up in a crop fire three years ago.

As the cousins go, Micki asks to use the Cobeans' bathroom. Micki whispers to Ryan to keep the Cobeans talking, and she finds a man locked in a closet. He growls and comes at Micki, choking her. Charlie hears the noise, comes, and shoves the man back in the closet. Charlie tells the cousins that the man, Nick, is their boy and their business. He tells them to leave, and outside Ryan says that the Cobeans were lying. The antiques can't be destroyed so the scarecrow couldn't have been destroyed in a crop fire. Ryan suggests that they scout.

The cousins traipse over the countryside and finds a neighboring farm. They spot an empty scarecrow post on a nearby hill, and Marge comes up and demands to know who they are. Micki says that they're antique dealers, and Marge tells them to mind their curiosity. Marge introduces herself and says that she was taking some good to Nick. She admits that the Cobeans are careful to keep Nick protected, and suggests that they stay at the Longacre Inn that she owns and runs single-handedly.

Marge continues to the Cobean house, and immediately tells the couple that she's heard they have some visitors. The Cobeans quickly let her in.

That night at the inn, Marge is delivering linens when Ryan notices a photo of her and a man on the wall. When he comments on it, Marge says that the man is her husband and she buried him. Once she leaves, Micki says that Tudy tried to tell him something at the Cobean farm. Marge is on the stairs and hears them talking.

Tudy sneaks out of the house once Charlie dozes off in front of the TV. Marge watches her go, and pins a photo of Tudy to the scarecrow's chest. Tudy makes her way through the forest in the fog, and the scarecrow appears and Tudy runs through the cornfield, into Riverdale, and down the main street. She gets to the inn and makes it to the front porch. The scarecrow appears and cuts off her head with its scythe.

Inside in her room, Micki hears Tudy scream and goes out to investigate. She finds Tudy's head on the floor and sees the scarecrow standing nearby, and yells for Ryan. Ryan runs downstairs from his room, but by the time he gets to the front door, the scarecrow is gone. Tudy's decapitated body is there but there's no sign of her head. As Micki says that she saw the scarecrow, Marge comes down from her room and Ryan tells her that there's been an accident. He goes back to Micki, and Marge smiles in satisfaction.

Later, Sheriff Comins arrives to take Micki's statement. She claims that she didn't see anyone, including the scarecrow. Once Comins goes, Micki tells Ryan that the scarecrow came to life and has a photo of Tudy pinned to its chest. Comins overhears her but figures she's rehearsing her story to get in the newspapers.

The next day, Comins visits the inn and asks Marge if Micki and Ryan are around. They aren't, and Comins mentions Micki saying that she saw the scarecrow. The coroner's report confirms that Trudy was decapitated with a scythe, and there was cornstalks in Tudy's hands.

Micki and Ryan go to a local co-op store and buy an antique part from the owner, Nate. Micki mentions the Cobeans, and Nate says that they have been doing well the last few years and don't need petty cash. Nate tells them that the Cobeans have been buying up nearby farms, and Charlie wasn't much of a farmer until his luck changed overnight. The cousins ask if there have been a lot of disappearances of people that were unexpected, and Nate mentions David's disappearance a week ago along with Jordy

As the cousins drive to the Meeno place, Nate is out chopping wood and sees them. Marge is with him, and comments that he really likes Micki. She says that Micki is a wild one that needs to broke good, and Nate goes back to chopping wood with an axe.

The Meeno farm is for sale, and Micki wonders where the scarecrow is. The cousins split up and Ryan checks the house. He notices that there is partially-eaten food on the table.

Micki looks around outside and finds a trail of blood. She follows it to a partially-constructed barn and sees a tarp-wrapped bundle inside.

Jordy grabs Ryan from behind and tackles him to the floor, then runs off.

Micki approaches the bundle and finds a basket holding rotten tomatoes underneath it.

Ryan grabs Jordy and gets him to calm down.

The scarecrow comes at Micki and swings at her with its scythe. She ducks out of the way and runs, screaming. Ryan and Jordy hear her and look out the window, and see the scarecrow chasing Micki. She trips and it prepares to kill her, and Comins arrives and shoots it dead. As Ryan and Jordy run out, Comins pulls the mask off the scarecrow and discovers that it's Nick. Ryan suggests that Nick killed David, and Comins agrees. The sheriff explains that he came looking for them, and figures that killing Nick put an end to the murders. Ryan offers to look after Jordy, and Comins says that Jordy has an aunt but it might take a while to track her down

That night at the inn, Ryan cleans Jordy up and puts him to bed. Marge checks in on Jordy and confirms that he hasn't said anything, and as she goes she asks Ryan to let her know if Jordy says anything.

Micki comes in, leaving her bag on the hallway table.

Ryan lays next to Jordy, telling a funny story. Jordy finally smiles, and Ryan tells him to get some sleep. As Ryan leaves, he runs into Micki and they go out in the hallway. Meanwhile, Marge takes Micki's driver's license from her bag.

In one of their rooms, Ryan says that Jordy reminds him of his younger brother, Jimmy. He explains that when he and Jimmy were out playing baseball on the street, a truck jackknifed and killed Jimmy. Micki figures that Jordy reminds him of Jimmy, and Ryan says that there's something about him. Returning to the present, Ryan asks Micki what she found out. She says that three people go missing every harvest and so far David and Tudy are the only ones who have disappeared, and the harvest has two days yet to go. Ryan figures that the scarecrow has to find one more victim. Jordy overhears them, comes in, and says that he can help them.

At home, Charlie gets some papers out of a drawer and then starts to make a call. He hears something outside the window and puts the phone down, and tucks the papers into his pocket.

Jordy says that he didn't see the face of the person who took his father's head, but only that they wear wearing a raincoat. Marge is listening outside the door and walks away. Meanwhile, Jordy says that when he and David went to the Cobeans, Jordy saw the scarecrow there. The trio prepare to drive to the Cobean farmhouse, and Micki discovers that her driver's license is gone and her picture was on it. Marge listens from hiding as Jordy says that David lost a photo of himself a couple of days before he died. The cousins figure a photo is how the scarecrow locates its victims, and Ryan tells Micki that they have to get her somewhere safe like the sheriff's office.

Marge leaves the inn and goes to the sheriff's office

Ryan figures that the person controlling the scarecrow set it up to make Nick look like the scarecrow, putting Comins off the real killer's trail. The trio go to the sheriff's office and find Comins outside. Comins agrees to watch over Micki, while Ryan and Jordy go to the Cobean house. Marge watches Micki and Comins go inside from the around the corner of the building.

Charlie hears something rattling at the window, but looks outside and sees nothing.

Marge gets the scarecrow and says that Micki will be surprised. Charlie comes up to the attic where he's keep the scarecrow, and tells Marge to get her hands off of the antique. He says that Marge killed Tudy and Nick, and that the entire thing stops there. Marge isn't impressed, and Charlie trains his shotgun on her. The woman secretly picks up a baling hook and approaches Charlies, saying that he's a good-looking man. Marge says that she never planned to hurt Charlie's family, and she paid Charlie good when he was going to sell cheap. She tells Charlie that he should put down the gun and they can have some fun. Charlie lowers the shotgun, and Marge kisses him... and then kills him with the baling hook.

Later, Ryan and Jordy check the Cobean barn and find it filled with scarecrows dangling from the rafters. Jordy doesn't recognize any of them as the killer scarecrow, but blood is dripping down. Ryan finds Charlie's body hanging among the scarecrows.

Micki talks about keeping secrets to Comins, and Comins says that he has lots of secrets. He goes to get Micki a blanket from the closet, and Micki sees a raincoat like the one that Jordy described. She shoves Comins into the closet and locks the door, then runs out.

Jordy goes to the farm house to try and call Comins, but gets no answer. Ryan has found the papers, which are a bill of sale. They show that Charlie sold the farm three years ago, and when Ryan sees the buyer's name he tells Jordy that they have to go.

Micki returns to the inn and finds Marge there. The girl asks if Ryan is there, and Marge says that it's just the two of them.

Ryan and Jordy drive to the sheriff's office and go inside.

Marge takes Micki to her room and tells her to relax. She goes, locking the door from the outside, and Micki pounds on the door and yells to Marge. The scarecrow is under the quilt on the bed and sits up, wielding its scythe. Micki's license is pinned to its chest. Marge hears Micki scream and continues knitting.

The scarecrow advances on Micki, and she avoids its swings.

After Ryan releases Comins, the trio go to the inn. Marge hears them coming and picks up a pair of scissors. She sneaks up on Comins and stabs him in the back, then grabs Jordy and threatens to kill him if Ryan doesn't stay back. When Jordy calls to Ryan, Ryan goes berserk, kicks the scissors out of Marge's hands, and attacks her.

The scarecrow continues swinging and missing at Micki, cutting through the door. Micki burst through the door and runs downstairs. Marge has kicked Ryan off and run, and the scarecrow teleports downstairs and intercepts Micki. Ryan jumps on its back, but it shrugs Ryan off and advances on Micki again. Ryan recovers and grabs the scythe, and Micki yanks the license off of the scarecrow's chest. It collapses, inert, and Marge runs out screaming and attacks them with the scissors.

Ryan grapples with her, and Marge hits the photo of her and her husband. The photo falls on the scarecrow, and it activates and kills Marge with its scythe. The photo falls off its chest, and the scarecrow goes inert again.

The next day, the cousins give their statements to Comins. Jordy is waiting for them outside the office, and Ryan tells Jordy that there's nothing to worry about. He gives the boy the baseball and Jordy asks who Jimmy is. Ryan tells him about his younger brother.

As the cousins drive out of Riverdale, Micki wonders what the scarecrow did with the heads. Behind them the scarecrow crossbeam falls over."

One of them is Jerry Scott, in a wheelchair. One at a time they are brought up to faith healer Steve Fishoff. Fishoff talks about his next ""patient"" a young man blinded by cataracts. The faith sealer says that he can heal the blind boy when doctors can't, and has everyone chant their belief.

Jerry stands up and says that he doesn't believe, and neither should the congregants. He says that what everyone is witnessing is a crime, and Fishoff insists that Jerry is drunk and they're witnessing the work of the Devil. Jerry asks the blind teenager what the color of his hair is, and the teenager insists that he's blind. When Fishoff says that the teenager just wants to be healed, Jerry steps forward and removes contact lenses from the teenager's eyes. Fishoff slips away while the congregants gasp in shock.

Fishoff flees out into an alley, and one of his ""patients"" finds him and calls him a crook. The fraud runs away, and runs into more of the infirm. They recognize him and he runs, and falls into a pile of garbage. Fishoff finds a white Italian Renaissance glove and puts it on, both curious and compelled. The charlatan laughs in triumph as he feels the glove's power, and a crippled woman hits him when she finds him.

The deformed woman, cursed with boils, curses Fishoff for not healing her as he promised. Fishoff insists that he didn't promise anything, and blames it on God's will. The woman accuses Fishoff of taking everything she had, and falls on Fishoff, He instinctively touches her face with his gloved hand. She's healed and cries in relief, while Fishoff stares at the glove in shock and then slips away.

The boils from the woman's affliction spread tenfold from the glove into Fishoff's body, He stares at the boils in horror, and a policeman sees him and comes over, assuming Fishoff is drunk. Fishoff touches his face, and the boils spread to the cop and he collapses to the ground, his body a mass of suppurating lesions while Fishoff is healed.

A year later at Curious Goods, Ryan is trying to get the TV to come in as Micki looks on. They get a commercial of Fishoff talking about how he was a different person six months ago. Ryan records the commercial on the VCR, and Jack comes in. Fishoff puts on the glove and says that he has the power. Jack recognizes the glove as an antique he brought it back from Rome after one of his terms in the Merchant Marine. The glove was made for Antonio Storza, an alchemist, by his court physician, and it provided good health for the elite. The glove is listed in the manifest, and Jack wonders at what cost the glove heals people.

The trio go to Fishoff's mission, and two of the guards usher Jack out when he tries to break in to Fishoff's office. Jack tells them to follow Fishoff if he leaves, while he looks for another way in. The cousins wait on a fire escape until Fishoff leaves by himself. They split up to follow him.

A woman takes her dog out to walk him, and the dog walks away. The woman runs after her dog, and a stricken Fishoff grabs the dog's leash and takes it to the owner. Fishoff grabs her hand when she reaches for the leash, transferring the ailments that he's absorbed into her. The glove is rendered pristine, while the woman dies horribly. After Fishoff walks away, the cousins join back up and find the woman's corpse. They realize someone used the glove to kill her.

Later back at the store, the cousins tells Jack what happened. Jack speculates on what the curse is, and figures who he needs to ask for help to get close to Fishoff. He tells Micki that he needs to see his contact alone, because he's ""decidedly peculiar"". Jack goes to the freighter where Jerry lives, and finds Jerry watching a video of another faith healer and taking notes. The two friends warmly greet each other and Jerry figures that he's debunked 400 ""parasite"" in the last 20 years. None of them close to being the real thing. Jack jokingly argues that Jerry has just never met a real faith healer, and Jerry says that they'll never see eye to eye on belief versus skepticism.

Jack says that he needs Jerry's help against Fishoff. Jerry has heard that Fishoff is back, and Jack hopes that he can get to Fishoff now. When Jerry wonder why Jack is involved with a small-timer like Fishoff, Jack brings up a video of Fishoff healing a crippled man with the glove. He says that Fishoff is a fraud but the glove gives him the power to heal.

Jerry accepts Jack's statement for the sake of argument, and Jake tells him that there are unpleasant side effects. Jack's friend demonstrates his own psychic abilities with spoon-bending, and sarcastically wonders if he should go out and heal the ""wounded world"". Jack warns that the bigger Fishoff gets, the more dangerous he'll get. Jerry confirms that Jack believes the glove can heal any disease, and asks Jack what he wants him to do.

Later at the mission, Jerry approaches Fishoff and says that he's been impressed with his recent success. Fishoff strokes the glove and Jerry says that he'll admit if he was wrong. The faith healer says that there is a power greater than both of them running through him, and Jerry dismisses it as greed. Fishoff insists that he can really do it, and wonders why Jerry is doing it. Jerry says that he can prove Fishoff is a fraud and a hypocrite, and this time he'll break him for good. Fishoff accepts Jerry's challenge.

Back on the freighter, Jerry tells Jack that he found a terminally ill ""patient"" for Fishoff. The person will die if a miracle isn't found, and Jack says that they can't let Fishoff kill someone because of the price to be paid. Jerry doesn't care that someone else will die, and tells Jack that he no longer has a say in it. When Jack wonders what the matter is with Jerry, Jerry pulls up his sheet to reveal the lesions on his chest. Jack realizes that Jerry is the patient and says that he can't be, and Jerry says that he has no choice. He takes out a revolver and aims it at Jack, and says that it's ironic that after his years of disbelief, the one person who can save him is a faith healer.

At the store, Ryan and Micki worry about Jack not having returned yet. Ryan figures that Jack can handle it, but Micki isn't convinced.

Jerry ties up Jack, who warns that the glove will kill someone. His friend says that he can't afford to care about that, and hopes Jack is right and he's wrong about the supernatural. Fishoff pulls up in his car and stations his bodyguard outside while he goes in. Jerry is waiting for Fishoff, and Jerry asks if Fishoff brought the glove. Fishoff confirms that he did, and Jerry says that he's the patient. He tells Fishoff that he's dying, and Fishoff says that he can heal anything but he's hated Jerry's guts for years and now has his life in his hands. With that, Fishoff puts the glove on.

Ryan figures that they should go get Jack because something has gone wrong. He gets Jerry's address from Jack's address book.

Fishoff asks Jerry if he believes, and advances on him. He tells Jerry to kneel to him, and Jerry does so. Fishoff demands that Jerry say loudly that he believes, and touches his ungloved hand to Jerry's head. The faith healer shoves Jerry back, and Jerry realizes that he's still dying. Fishoff jokingly says that he must have used the wrong, hand, and removes and pockets the glove.

Jerry draws his revolver and tells Fishoff to heal him or he'll kill him. He fires a shot into the air to demonstrate he's serious, and the bodyguard runs in. Jerry shoots him dead, and Fishoff runs after him as Jerry gives chase. As Fishoff gets in his car, Jerry shoots him in the back. Fishoff collapses into the front seat of his car, and puts on the glove to heal himself as Jerry comes down the gangplank after him.

Fishoff drives off but, weakened, wedges his car in behind a dumpster. Finding a gunshot wound on the glove and realizing he has to get rid of the damage before the glove kills him with it, Fishoff tries to get out of the car but discovers the door is jammed against the dumpster. Jerry arrives as Fishoff opens the car window and begs for help. The debunker laughs hysterically, and gunshot wounds spread across Fishoff's body.

Jerry takes the glove and goes back to his cabin. He trains his gun on Jack and finds that Jack has already slipped his ropes. Jack figures that Jerry killed Fishoff, and Jerry figures that he can heal himself and then will need Jack afterward. Jerry has Jack sit down in his cabin, then touches the glove to his chest and heals himself.

Ryan and Mick arrive outside and go aboard the freighter.

Jerry realizes that he's healed, and the glove is covered with his lesions. He advances on Jack, saying that he's sorry, and Jack tries to run. He forces the gloved hand back on Jerry's face, and Jerry screams in agony as the lesions appear back on his body tenfold. The cousins arrive as the dying Jerry begs Jack to pray for him. Jack says that he will as his friend dies, and the glove returns to its pristine state.

Later back at the store, Jack is kicking at a crate in frustration. He tells Micki that Jerry was his friend and Jerry tried to kill. Jack bemoans what his ""friends"" have done to him, and tells Micki that he wants to leave. As Ryan comes in, Micki tells Jack that maybe they'd be better off if Jack considers them liabilities. Ryan interrupts, calming them both down. He assures Jack that he still has friends and they're his friends. Jack calms down and offers Ryan an ancient remedy for his head cold, and Micki suggests chemicals and proposes a contest of magic versus scientist. Ryan leaves in disgust when they start betting on which of them can cure him."
