The camera pulls back to reveal an overturned car and truck. A sheriff's cruiser pulls up and out steps Rick Grimes. The uniformed man cautiously examines the scene before approaching a gas station. More abandoned cars. Laundry. Baby dolls. Makeshift camp sites. A dead woman rots in one of the cars.

Grimes, who carries a gasoline canister, is looking for gas -- but a sign at the station reveals that there is none left. Suddenly, he spots a shambling figure in bunny bath slippers. It is a young girl. ""Don't be afraid,"" Grimes says. She turns -- a ZOMBIE! Grimes pulls his gun ... and blows her brains out. Welcome to the apocalypse.

FLASHBACK: Rick and his partner Shane discuss the differences between men and women while eating lunch in their cruiser. Rick talks of his wife Lori and son Carl. Apparently, the couple had a fight the night before. ""It's like she's pissed at me all the time and I don't know why,"" Rick explains to Shane. The pair then gets an urgent call.

A weaving car is being chased by cop cars. Rick and his men set up a roadblock. The weaving car swerves and FLIPS over and over before coming to stop in an adjacent field. Two bloodied men emerge from the wreck with their guns drawn. They FIRE. Rick is hit. The officers return fire and quickly take the two men down. Rick, who is wearing a bulletproof vest and has only been winged, believes it is all over. He stands up ... and is SHOT again. Turns out there is a third armed man in the wrecked car. Shane raises his shotgun and BLOWS the man away. He then turns his attention to Rick, who is BADLY injured. It doesn't look good.

CUT to the hospital. We see events from Rick's hazy point of view. Shane visits with flowers. Time passes ... but how much time? Sometime later, Rick awakes. The flowers are dead. The clock has stopped. He tries to move, but his legs have atrophied. He falls. ""Nurse, help!"" Rick cries. No answer. Rick manages to stumble into the hallway ... and discovers a complete mess. Gurneys, papers and equipment are strewn everywhere.

Worse: a hospital employee appears lying dead on the floor appears to have been almost completely devoured. A set of double doors, meanwhile, has been chained shut with the scrawled warning: ""Don't open. Dead inside."" Rick wisely backs away from the doors, which begin to bulge and shake. Something wants out. Rick retreats to a darkened room with a flight of stairs heading down. Using only a match to light his way, Rick eventually finds an exit door ... and is blinded by the light of the day. Outside, dozens and dozens of dead and rotting bodies are wrapped in hospital sheets. Rick is HORRIFIED.

Rick stumbles away from the hospital, finds a bicycle and races home. ""Lori!"" he cries. ""Carl!"" But the house is empty. Its occupants are long gone. Crying, Rick walks outside. Something approaches him from behind -- slowly. It's a non-zombie boy! The boy, Duane, swings a shovel and knocks Rick to the ground. The boy's father, Morgan, then rushes up -- and notices that Rick isn't a zombie, after all. Rick passes out from the blow.

For the second time that day, Rick wakes up in a bed unsure of his surroundings. He is tied to a bed inside a suburban home. ""Did you get bit -- maybe scratched?"" Morgan asks. Rick explains that he has ""only"" been shot. The trio then sits down for dinner and Morgan explains that the streets are crawling with ""walkers."" The process: bites kill you, a subsequent fever ""burns you out"" and, then, ""after awhile, you come back."" Duane then looks out the window at the walking dead -- and spots his mother! He cries ... and Morgan does his best to comfort his son. ""She died in the other room in that bed over there,"" he explains to Rick. ""I should've put her down ... I just didn't have it in me.""

The next morning, Rick returns to his home with Morgan and Duane. He notices that all the family photo albums are gone. Rick theorizes that his family fled after packing up their personal belongings. Duane says they probably headed to Atlanta, where the center for disease control and prevention is located. The trio then head to the police station to take hot showers (the station has its own propane supply) and collect weapons and ammo.

Rick then says goodbye to Morgan and Duane, who take their supplies to a nearby Jeep. Rick hangs around just long enough to SHOOT a zombie deputy he once knew before driving away in his squad car. Destination: Atlanta. First, though, Rick stops at an area park to put a female zombie -- cut in half and crawling pathetically -- out of her misery. ""I'm sorry this happened to you,"" Rick says through tears. He shoots her in the head.

Meanwhile, Morgan and Duane return home. Dad tells his son to wait downstairs before heading to the upstairs bedroom. There, Morgan takes aim at zombies in the street with a scoped rifle. He shoots two ... before spotting his wife. Shaking, Morgan takes aim ... but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. Zombie Mom shambles away. Morgan weeps.

Sometime later, Rick uses his police radio to see if anybody responds. Unbeknownst to Rick, a group of survivors does hear Rick's message (he can't hear their answer). It turns out that the group, which has made a camp in a field, includes Shane, Lori and Carl! Lori tells the group that they should've set up a roadside sign warning people against going to Atlanta, which is apparently crawling with zombies and completely unsafe. Shane tells her that they simply don't have time. She storms off to a tent. Shane enters to talk her down ... and the two end their conversation with a passionate kiss. Uh oh.

CUT to Rick, who comes upon a farmhouse where the inhabitants decided to shoot themselves rather than live in a zombie-infested world. Rick, who is looking for gas, spots a horse in the yard. He decides to ditch his cruiser and ride the steed. ""Go easy, OK?"" he tells the animal. ""I haven't done this for years."" Riding the horse, Rick soon approaches Atlanta. The city is seemingly empty -- save for crashed cars, empty Army helicopters and burned-out buses. Sure enough, zombies begin to appear.

Suddenly, Rick hears the sound of a helicopter. He spurs the horse to follow it -- and turns a corner into a side street PACKED with zombies. Quickly turning around, Rick flees -- and runs into another horde. The sheriff is pulled from his horse, which quickly becomes zombie feed. Rick then crawls underneath an Army tank and begins SHOOTING wildly. He then notices a hatch in the bottom of the tank and pulls himself into the belly of the steel beast, SLAMMING the hatch shut behind him. He crawls up against a seemingly dead soldier, and takes his gun. While looking away, the soldier comes to zombie life; Rick shoots him in the head just in time. Safe ... for now.

Inside the tank, Rick can hear the undead swarming all over the vehicle. He is despondent when, suddenly, a voice crackles over the tank radio. ""Hey you, dumbass,"" the voice says. ""You in the tank? Cozy in there?"" Rick's eyes go wide. Who is that?

Until next time, what is left of America ..."

So Lori heads into nearby woods to search for provisions. She hears a rustling. Nothing. She continues. More rustling. Nothing -- again. Lori is about to panic when ...

Shane appears OUT OF NOWHERE and drags her to the ground. They immediately begin to strip off their clothes. Shane momentarily stops when he sees Lori's pendant. She removes it -- and the two get back to making wild love in the grass.

Meanwhile, Lori's husband, sheriff Rick, remains trapped in a tank in the middle of Atlanta. Zombies swarm the military vehicle, but can't get inside. Inside, a voice comes from the radio. ""Hey, you alive in there?"" the voice asks. The voice then tells Rick that a side street is comparatively unpopulated by ""walkers"" -- and advises him to make a run for it. After a few deep breaths, Rick emerges from the top of the tank. He BASHES a zombie in the face, SHOOTS a few others and starts RUNNING. A young man suddenly appears (Rick ALMOST shoots the stranger) and diverts Rick down an alley.

The pair climbs a fire escape -- and the man, the voice on the radio, introduces himself as Glenn. They climb to the roof then double back through the building to the street. With zombies hot on their heels, Rick and Glenn make it to a department store, where a band of survivors await. One of the survivors, Andrea, is FURIOUS at Rick for firing his gun and attracting the undead. ""You just rang the dinner bell,"" she says. Sure enough, a horde of zombies has assembled at the entrance to the store. Suddenly, the group hears SHOTS.

They sprint to the roof -- and find Dixon shooting his rifle. T-Dog, who is black, accuses Dixon of wasting bullets. Dixon immediately uses the N-word -- as if he were just waiting for an opportunity -- and the two immediately come to blows. It ends with Dixon pointing a gun at T-Dog and declaring himself superior. ""Anybody else?"" the racist asks. Rick answers in the affirmative -- and BASHES Dixon in the face with a rifle. Rick then cuffs Dixon to a pipe ... the tosses the keys off the roof. Dixon HOWLS with rage.

Later, Rick suggests the group head for the sewers. Survivor Jacqui, who used to work in the city zoning office, explains that the building should have an access point in the basement. Glenn volunteers to head into the hole to scope out the situation -- and takes a flashlight and fellow survivor Morales with him. In the meantime, T-Dog and Dixon trade insults on the roof while the former tries to get somebody -- anybody -- on the radio. ""It's nothing personal,"" Dixon says. ""You're kind and my kind just weren't meant to mix."" T-Dog shakes his head -- and refuses Dixon's request to give him a hacksaw.

Glenn and Morales soon return from their sewer trip -- and explain that a steel grate blocks any chance of exit through the sewer. Even worse: the zombies outside have busted through the first set of glass doors. Only one final set of doors keeps them from entering the department store. So what now? Rick suggests a distraction. Andrea explains that the undead can smell the living. Apparently, their odor is distinct.

The plan: chop up a dead body of a security guard and smear his blood and guts on their bodies. -- thus, smelling like a zombie. It's as disgusting as it sounds, but the survivors get the job done with a big axe and rubber gloves. Glenn vomits. ""Do we smell like them?"" Rick asks. Says Andrea with a grimace: ""Oh, yeah."" Rick then tosses T-Dog a key to Dixon's cuffs (an extra set he had stowed in his pocket) and heads outside with Glenn.

Amazingly, the two blend in, passing zombies who sniff them before turning their undead attentions elsewhere. The other survivors watch from the roof. Unfortunately, storm clouds are gathering above. It's going to rain ... and possibly cleanse Rick and Glenn! T-Dog, meanwhile, continues to try to contact people on the radio. Although he doesn't know it, Shane's group of survivors can hear the calls -- barely. ""He said a department store,"" Lori says. As it turns out, Andrea is the big sister to Amy, who is traveling with Shane, Lori, Carl, Dale and others. Andrea volunteered to go to Atlanta to get help. Now, Shane tells Amy that her sis ""knew the risks"" -- and they won't be going after her. Amy, naturally, is FURIOUS. ""You sonofabitch!"" Amy tells Shane, who looks guilty as hell.

Rick and Glenn, meanwhile, continue to walk through the horde of zombies. Then it begins to rain. The guts begin to wash off of the pair. The zombies begin to smell something. Uh oh. A zombie ATTACKS -- and Rick BURIES his axe in the monster's brain. ""Run!"" Rick screams. So they do, eventually hopping a chain-link fence. As the zombies figure out how to climb the fence, Rick and Glenn hustle to a truck at a construction site. The keys have been left inside. They gun the engine and take off.

But they don't go far. Rick soon stops the truck and breaks into a nearby sports car, setting off the loud alarm. The plan: Glenn will drive the sports car to the front of the department store. The alarm will attract the zombies. Meanwhile, Rick will drive the truck to the back of the store and pick up the survivors. Glenn calls the group on the radio to tell them the details. But what about racist Dixon? ""You can't leave me here!"" Dixon screams. T-Dog hesitates ... but finally decides to free Dixon with the key. Alas, T-Dog trips -- and the key bounces from his hand and disappears into an open pipe. ""I'm sorry!"" a distraught T-Dog screams before fleeing the roof. Again, Dixon HOWLS with anger.

CUT to Glenn, who plows through a horde of walkers in front of the department store -- the car alarm BLARING the entire time. CUT to Rick, who backs up to a loading dock. Morales, Jacqui, T-Dog and Andrea jump into the back of the truck. Rick notices that Dixon isn't there. ""I dropped the damn key,"" T-Dog explains. Finally, CUT to Glenn, who RACES down an empty highway in the sports car. He lets out a triumphant YELL!

So everybody has escaped (with the possible exception of Dixon) ... for this week."

Merle, still chained to a rooftop in Atlanta, rants and raves almost incoherently. He seems to be talking about his time in the military. After a few moments, he appears to ""wake up"" at the sound of zombies beating on the door to the roof. ""Oh Jesus!"" Merle cries. ""I know I'm being punished ... I deserve it ... show me the way!"" The undead moan.

CUT to Rick and Morales drive though a town -- the former explaining that poor Merle has a brother named Daryl. CUT to the makeshift camp where Lori cuts Carl's hair while Shane watches. Shane promises to teach Carl how to catch frogs. ""We'll feed these folks Cajun-style Kermit legs,"" promises sudden father-figure Shane. Suddenly, Glenn drives up in his sports car ... followed by Rick, Morales and the rest of the survivors. ""Come meet everybody,"" Morales tells the sheriff. Andrea is united with Amy. Morales is united with his family. And, finally, Rick spots Lori and Carl. They EMBRACE.

After the emotional reunion -- one Shane watches with shock and confusion -- Rick cuddles around the campfire with his wife and son. ""I can't tell you how grateful I am to you, Shane,"" Rick says. If he only knew Shane and Lori had become more than buddies. T-Dog, meanwhile, wonders if Merle is still alive. He believes the lock on the rooftop door to be too strong for the walkers to break. Also: everybody in camp worries about telling brother Daryl, who is apparently away on a ""hunt."" He'll likely react poorly.

Later, Rick cozies up to Lori in their family tent. ""Baby, I really thought I would never see you again,"" she says. ""I'm so sorry ... for everything."" Yet she can't bring herself to reveal the details of her most recent affair with Shane. Rick then passionately kisses his wife. After a moment of hesitation, she kisses him back. Shane, meanwhile, sits alone. The next morning, Rick awakens and makes his way through camp -- when he hears a SCREAM. Carl has seen a zombie feasting on a dead dear. Rick, Shane, Dale and Glenn approach the monster and BEAT it to death (again) -- Dale finally decapitating it.

At that moment, Daryl returns to camp. He is angry that the zombie ate the deer he shot ... and takes his revenge via crossbow on the still twitching head. Andrea and Amy wince. Shane then pulls aside Daryl and gives him the bad news: Merle didn't return from Atlanta. Rick approaches. ""Your brother was a danger to us all, so I handcuffed him to a roof ... he's still there,"" the sheriff explains. Daryl is APOPLECTIC. He ATTACKS Rick, who -- with the help of Shane -- subdues the hillbilly. T-Dog then explains that he dropped the key down a drain. ""I'm going back,"" Rick tells Daryl. Lori hangs her head.

Shane tries to convince Rick not to go -- especially to save a jerk like Merle. ""I can't let a man die,"" Rick says. ""We left him like an animal in a trap."" T-Dog and Daryl volunteer, too. Glenn reluctantly agrees to join the team. But it's not just about saving Merle. Rick explains that he dropped a bag containing valuable guns, ammunition and a walkie-talkie. The latter he can use to warn Morgan and his son Duane against heading to Atlanta. After they leave, Lori attempts to comfort Carl -- whose confidence ends up comforting her.

Sometime later, Shane and Carl bond by catching frogs -- or attempting to anyway. Jacqui wonders why the women have been relegated to washing clothes. They then begin to mention things they miss about their old lives. Andrea mentions that she misses her vibrator -- and the ladies crack up. Their smiles disappear when Ed, Carol's moody husband, approaches. He tells his cowering wife that this isn't a ""comedy club."" Lori then reprimands Carl for leaving Dale's side, though the boy was obviously safe with Shane. After Carl leaves, Lori turns her ire on Shane. ""You stay away from me -- you stay away from my son,"" she shouts. ""My husband is back! He is alive! You are the one who told me that he died!"" Shane is distraught.

Meanwhile, Rick, Daryl, Glenn and T-Dog park their truck outside Atlanta. They opt to approach the heart of the city on foot. Soon, the foursome is inside the department store. Daryl SHOOTS a zombie in the brain with an arrow. Back at the camp, Ed's anger has escalated. He insults Andrea and then SLAPS Carol across the face. Shane, whose blood is already up, sprints toward Ed and proceeds to BEAT him mercilessly. Ed is little more than a blood pulp before Shane stops -- warning the wife beater that if he raises his hand to anyone in the camp, he will die. ""I'll beat you to death, Ed!"" Shane rages. Carol screams ... and runs to her badly injured husband.

Finally, the Atlanta gang arrives on the rooftop to find Merle missing ... or most of him. Turns out ol' Merle must've been able to reach the hacksaw. His severed hand remains on the roof, but the rest of Daryl's big brother has apparently managed to escape.

Until next time ..."

Their conversation, however, is strained -- the pair were born 12 years apart and don't appear to have much in common. They talk of their father, who taught them different approaches to fishing. ""He knew we were so different,"" Amy says. ""He knew you needed to catch the fish and I needed to throw them back."" The thought of their parents nearly brings both ladies to tears. It's a touching moment.

Meanwhile, the crew of would-be rescuers has just discovered Merle's severed hand on the Atlanta rooftop where he'd been left by the last exploratory group. Angry Daryl, who holds T-Dog responsible for his brother's predicament, aims his crossbow at the man. Rick, in turn, points his own gun at Daryl, urging the hillbilly to stand down... or else. The tension subsides somewhat, and Daryl picks up his brother's hand, wrapping it in T-Dog's bandana for safe keeping. The group follows Merle's blood trail... and discovers a few slaughtered zombies along the way. Apparently, Merle remains pretty handy at killing the undead -- even with one hand.

Back at camp, Jim determinedly digs a series of holes -- so determinedly that he ignores (or doesn't hear) Dale's offer of water. In fact, the survivor appears oblivious to everybody. ""Hey, Jim?"" Shane asks. ""I'm just a little concerned, man."" Jim continues to dig and -- after calling Shane's leadership into question -- takes a swing at the cop with the shovel. Shane tackles the digger and cuffs him. ""The only reason I got away was because the dead were too busy eating my family,"" Jim cries. The man is clearly unhinged.

Glenn is giving a detailed plan of how the rescue team will search the streets. The strategy covers all angles. ""You got some balls for a Chinaman,"" Daryl sneers. ""I'm Korean."" says Glenn. ""Whatever."" says Daryl.

The team then hits the streets, which are filled with walkers. Glenn is able to grab the bag of weapons left behind by Rick, but is then accosted by living members of a street gang! The gang members shove Glenn into their car and speed away. One of the gang, however, is left behind... and the young man is immediately corralled by T-Dog and a seething Daryl.

Back at the camp, Shane has tied Jim to a tree... for his own safety, of course. Jim apologizes to the children for scaring them. And why was he digging? ""Something I dreamt last night,"" explains Jim, who can't remember the details. He then urges Lori to keep Carl close. ""Never let him out of your sight,"" he says. Lori nods in understanding.

The rescue team, in the meantime, interrogates the captured punk, who refuses to provide any info. Daryl then shows the punk Merle's severed hand, claiming that it was he who did the cutting. The punk shakes in fear... and then talks. Moments later, the rescue team arrives at the hideout of the gang, which is led by a man named Guillermo. Rick proposes trading Glenn for the young punk, but Guillermo refuses. He wants the bag of guns. Only then will the gang surrender Glenn.

The rescue team retreats to their makeshift headquarters, where the guns are stashed. Not surprisingly, Daryl doesn't want to give up the guns... but Rick disagrees. The sheriff explains that Glenn saved him from the inside of a tank. Rick plans to return the favor. So, moments later, the team approaches the gang hideout for the second time. The young punk is bound and gagged as he is pushed inside at gunpoint where he is then freed.

""You have your man, I want mine,"" says Rick, who refuses to surrender the bag of weapons. Many guns are drawn and pointed when an old lady suddenly parts the crowd. She is the grandmother of one of the gang members. Rick assures the abuela that he is not there to arrest her kin. The old lady then leads Rick and the rescuers inside an attached old-folks home.

Turns out that the group is caring for the residents -- and are willing to fight for weapons and medicine to do so. ""The staff took off,"" explains Guillermo, who is a custodian at the facility. ""Just left them here to die."" The gang members act as security. Sympathetic, Rick then hands over a few weapons to help the cause.

Later, the rescue team heads back to their van... only the vehicle is missing. ""Who would take it?"" Glenn asks. Answers Rick: ""Merle."" Even Daryl winces -- his brother probably went back to camp ... for revenge. The crew heads off toward the camp on foot.

Back at camp Shane decides to free Jim so he can join the survivors for a fish fry. Everybody is enjoying the food and chatting -- Dale gives the group a Faulkner lesson -- when zombies suddenly attack the camp! Ed is bitten! Another walker takes a chunk out of Amy's neck! Andrea screams as her sister bleeds out. Shane opens fire. Morales and Jim bash zombies with bats.

Just then, the rescue team arrives for another rescue. They fire their weapons repeatedly as Zombie brain matter splatters the campsite. Suddenly, all is quiet save for a weeping Andrea, who hunches over her sister's lifeless body. ""Amy!"" she screams. ""Amy!"" The remainder of the survivors watch in horror.

Jim whispers chillingly: ""I remember my dream now... why I dug the holes."""

Rick hunches on a grassy hill overlooking Atlanta. He tries to hail Morgan on the radio and warn him. ""Atlanta is not what we thought,"" Rick urges. ""Do not enter the city. It belongs to the dead now."" The sheriff then gives the location of the survivors before giving up. No contact with Morgan has yet been made. Andrea, meanwhile, continues to mourn Amy, who lies dead on the camp ground. Lori approaches. ""We all cared about her,"" Lori says. ""We'll be as gentle as we can."" In other words, the body must be discarded. Andrea doesn't respond. Rick tries his luck -- and Andrea points a gun at him for his efforts. ""Sorry,"" Rick whispers then slowly backs away.

The clean-up continues. Daryl tries to drag one of the dead humans into a fire, but Glenn won't allow it. The humans are to be buried -- decent like. ""You left my brother for dead,"" Daryl growls. ""You had this coming."" Ouch.

More bad news follows. Jim was bitten in the skirmish. He pleads with Jacqui not to tell, but she announces his wound to the camp. ""I'm OK, I'm OK,"" Jim insists, but the bite is deep. He isn't OK. Naturally, Daryl suggests putting a pickaxe into Jim's head, but Rick protests, insisting ""We don't kill the living!"" Instead, Rick suggests the group head to the CDC -- on the off chance that a cure can be found. Nobody particularly likes the idea, but no one argues either.

Later, Dale has a heart-to-heart conversation with Andrea. He explains that, after his wife died of cancer, he didn't care about anybody until he met Andrea and Amy. Andrea is touched. She gently lays Amy's birthday gift -- a necklace and pendant -- across the dead woman's bloody neck. Carol, in the meantime, volunteers to sink a pickaxe into the head of her (abusive) dead husband. She does so -- and then does it again and again. Something tells us that Carol is working out past frustrations.

Suddenly, Amy opens her eyes. Is she alive?! Not exactly. ""Amy, I'm sorry I always thought there would be more time,"" Andrea whispers. Before Amy can bite into her sibling, Andrea puts a gun to her temple. ""I love you,"" she whispers before shooting undead Amy through the brain.

Later, Shane questions Rick's decision to leave the group and attempt to rescue Merle. It appears a power struggle between the long time friends could be brewing. But there's no time for a pissing match now. The group gathers to bury its dead (in spite of Daryl's repeated objections) -- and Rick makes a promise to his boy: ""I won't leave again ... not for anything."" Lori, meanwhile, questions the logic of going to the CDC on a ""hunch."" A decision will have to be made quickly, however. Poor Jim is looking terrible. The sick man coughs and spits into a bucket. Lori eventually opts to support her husband, telling Shane that they should trust Rick's ""gut."" Shane is visibly disappointed.

Later, Rick and Shane strike out into the woods to search for zombies. They argue over the best course of action. Shane is obviously upset for reasons (his affair with Lori in Rick's absence) that he doesn't mention. The two then split up in search of the undead. From a distance, Shane points his gun at his friend, but doesn't fire. The next morning, Rick tries Morgan again on the radio, explaining his plan to head to the CDC. Again, Morgan doesn't answer. Shane, meanwhile, explains how the caravan will work when Morales announces that he won't be coming. Instead, the survivor and his family will go to Alabama, where they have kin. ""I have to do what's best for my family,"" he explains.

So everybody minus the Morales family climb into cars, trucks and a camper and drive. In the back of the RV, Jim moans in pain. Naturally, they don't get far before the camper overheats. Shane volunteers to ride ahead to a gas station and see if a replacement part can be found. Rick then visits Jim, who asks to die. ""I want this,"" he says. ""Leave me here it's my decision."" Moments later, the group carries Jim to a nearby tree. Rick offers Jim a pistol, but the sick man refuses it. They then leave Jim to the elements.

Cut to a flickering video feed. A man introduces himself as Jenner, who drinks from a CDC coffee mug. He lives underground and searches for a cure -- but there has been no progress. End of transmission.

We then see Jenner, wearing a full contamination suit, studying samples of the undead flesh and listening to classical music. The man is exhausted -- and he accidentally knocks over a test tube. Alarm bells begin to sound. Jenner hustles to the door and it slams shut behind him. Suddenly, the lab room bursts into flames. A robotic voice announces that ""decontamination is complete."" Jenner hangs his head. His fresh samples have just been destroyed. No more tests. Still no cure.

Later, Jenner drinks wine. ""I think tomorrow I'm going to blow my brains out,"" he says into a monitor. ""But tonight I'm getting drunk."" The camera pulls back to reveal that Jenner is alone in a vast and high-tech underground facility. Outside, the land around the CDC is littered with corpses -- hundreds of them. The group of horrified survivors weaves through the bodies toward the door. Inside, Jenner spots the survivors on a security monitor. He is shocked. Rick looks into the camera and begs for help. Jenner hesitates, struggling with how to respond to the survivors' plea... and then finally opens the door from the inside."

Army troops open fire on a group of doctors and nurses. Zombies suddenly appear -- and take a bite out of the army. Shane ducks into a room where Rick lies in a coma. ""If you're going to wake up, you better do it now!"" Shane tells his friend. It's no use. Rick continues to slumber so Shane reluctantly leaves, blocking the door to Rick's room in the process.

PRESENT DAY: Rick, Shane and the rest of the survivors enter the CDC fortress. It appears to be abandoned when Dr. Jenner materializes from a dark corner. ""Is anybody infected?!"" Jenner demands. ""You all submit to a blood test. That's the price of admission."" Rick agrees. Jenner then leads the group underground and explains that the rest of the doctors are dead or gone. A computer -- which has a female voice -- has been his only company. Later, the survivors indulge in a few generous glasses of wine before Jenner introduces the group to its quarters -- complete with hot water!

Everybody has a hot shower and continues to drink, though it's clear that Andrea is not well. She vomits in the toilet and weeps. ""It's over,"" she tells Dale. ""There's nothing left!"" Dale prefers to see the end of the world (as they imagine it) as a chance to start over but Andrea isn't buying what he's selling. A drunken Rick, meanwhile, has a heart-to-heart with Jenner. Basically, the sheriff explains that the group didn't have any real chance of surviving on the ""outside."" ""It will all be OK,"" Jenner tells him unconvincingly.

A drunken Shane, in the meantime, confronts Lori. ""I'm going to tell you a few things and you're going to listen to me,"" Shane slurs. ""How can you treat me like this?!"" He explains that there was a massacre at the hospital and he had no choice but to leave Rick. Then it gets ugly. ""I love you,"" Shane says before aggressively groping Lori. She fights back -- and forcefully pushes him away, scratching his neck in the process. Ashamed and angry, Shane storms from the room. Lori tries to pull herself together.

The next morning, T-Dog makes powdered eggs for the survivors. Shane enters and tries to conceal the scratch marks on his neck. He offers a lame excuse about the marks being self inflicted. After breakfast, Jenner asks the computer to replay ""TS-19,"" a video record referencing ""Test Subject 19."" The test subject was bitten by a zombie and volunteered to have his process monitored. The group watches as the subject's brain synapses corrode and shutdown then flicker back to life during ""resurrection."" Essentially, the brain stem reawakens, but nothing else. ""The neocortex -- the human part -- that doesn't come back,"" Jenner says. ""Just a shell driven by mindless instinct."" Alas, Jenner knows almost nothing more -- and is nowhere close to finding a cure.

The replay concludes with what is obviously a bullet ploughing through the brain stem, ceasing all neuro activity.

Dale then notices a clock that is counting down to zero. Jenner explains that the basement generator will eventually run out of fuel. And what happens then? Nothing good -- that's for sure. Rick leads a group to the basement to check out the generators. They discover a bunch of empty fuel drums. Moments later, the air conditioning stops. Jenner, meanwhile, has shaved, combed his hair and put on a tie. He stares at a framed photo of his dead wife when the lights suddenly go out. The CDC is shutting itself down. Thirty minutes remain on the clock. Jenner then explains that the French were the last to work on a possible cure. ""They thought they were close to a solution,"" Jenner says. Unfortunately, the power eventually ran out just like it is now.

Panicked, Rick tells the group to pack their bags -- it's time to go. But Jenner seals the door, locking everybody inside. He explains that it would be pointless to run. The computer has locked all the exit doors on the street level. The CDC houses multiple strains of deadly viruses -- and is designed to make sure nothing escapes when power is lost. Basically, the facility will auto-self-destruct, killing everyone inside. Awful understanding dawns on the survivors' faces. ""It's better this way,"" says Jenner, who has resigned himself to dying in less than 30 minutes. ""It sets the air on fire. No pain.""

Shane and Daryl try to chop down the door with axes but it's no good. ""There is no hope,"" Jenner says. ""There never was - this is our extinction event."" Shane, however, isn't going to go down without a senseless fight. He begins shooting up the room with a shotgun -- making much noise, but accomplishing nothing. Rick wrestles the gun from his hand and slams his friend to the ground. ""Are you done?"" Rick asks. Responds Shane: ""I guess we all are."" After a moment of silence, Rick accuses Jenner of keeping secrets. The doctor then admits that TS-19 was his wife, who ran the facility. ""Your wife didn't have a choice, you do,"" Rick pleads. ""That's all we want: a choice!""

So Jenner opens the sealed door, but warns that the topside exits remain shut. ""There's your chance,"" Jenner says. ""Take it."" He then shakes Rick's hand and whispers something in the sheriff's ear. As the group rushes out the door, Jacqui and Andrea announce that they are staying. They would rather die an instantaneous and painless death than face the outside. ""This isn't what Amy would want for you!"" Dale tells Andrea. The rest of the survivors, meanwhile, have rushed to the front lobby. They desperately try to break the glass, but it withstands even a shotgun blast. Carol then pulls a grenade from her purse. Rick takes the grenade, sets it against the glass entrance and pulls the pin.

BOOM! The glass breaks, creating an exit.

Back in the command center, Dale continues to try to convince Andrea to leave with him. She refuses -- so Dale sits down. ""If you're staying, I'll stay, too,"" Dale tells Andrea. The group leaps outside -- and immediately begins shooting zombies. They head for their caravan of cars. Just then, Dale and Andrea emerge from the building. Both have decided to live, after all. There is suddenly a whine in the air. Time is up. The survivors take cover as the CDC structure implodes in an awesome bloom of fire.

A short time later, the group drives away from the destruction. A black cloud of smoke blocks the sun -- an ominous sight for our departing survivors."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0617921/?ref_=ttep_ep0,,A writer in need of a job reluctantly agrees to work for her father's women's magazine.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Philip Charles MacKenzie'],[''],[],[],[],"News reporter Maya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo) is working at her desk when news anchor Christy (Emily Proctor) demands her to edit the copy for self serving motives. Offended and annoyed, Maya jokingly retypes the copy to read -gang violence is down since last year and they tell me they credit the decrease to removal of the frontal lobe of my brain and in a related story I wet myself- subsequently Maya is fired.

We catch up with Maya again three months later where she has come back from a job interview. Her roommate Wally (Chris Hogan) shares some good news about a potential date as Maya shares her news about a promising interview with Newsweek. Sadly, Wally informs her that she received a message that she didn't get the job based on her references. Wally talks Maya into visiting her father Jack Gallo (George Segal), owner and chief editor of Blush fashion magazine. Maya has not seen her father in a year because he married a much younger woman that went to school with both her and Wally.

When Maya arrives in the Blush lobby, a gaggle of very tall, beautiful, and slender models are being assessed by fashion editor / former supermodel (Noxzema Gotcha Girl) Nina Van Horn (Wendy Malick), and sexually harassed by executive assistant to Mr. Gallo, Dennis Finch (David Spade). Maya tells Finch she is there to see Jack Gallo and is quickly put down. She then approaches Nina and is also put down but with a quick come back puts Nina in her place. Finch quickly seizes the opportunity to suck up and directs Maya to Jacks office.

Jack is pleasantly surprised to see his Maya but they are interrupted by Elliot (Enrico Colantoni), who tries to tell her that Jack is always talking about her and that he is so happy to finally meet her; Elliot is quickly discovered to be a liar when he inadvertently calls her Myra instead of Maya. Nina enters the room regarding a model dispute with Elliot and the dispute is settled by Jack.

When Elliot and Nina leave the room Nina has an opportunity to speak with Jack only to find that he already knows her situation and is more than happy to give her money. When Maya tries to offer a way to pay him back, Jack suggests writing an article for the magazine. Thinking she is a serious journalist Maya turns it down but then changes her mind when Jack says it will be a good way for them to spend time together.

No sooner do the words come out of his mouth when a call comes in that his wife Ally is in the hospital delivering their baby. Maya is upset as she had no idea and stays to write a negative article about her - father the jackass- .

Nina and Finch peer over the desks at Maya discussing newly discovered information about her such as - Maya is a Stanford Graduate, was on the deans list, has no current boyfriend, and is on the pill - Nina fears that Maya is trying to take over the magazine as Elliot joins the conversation.

Later, Elliot asks Maya her opinion about photos of different models for her article and soon discovers that she is a feminist who is opposed to messages models send to young girls. Elliot is lured away by model Lorena (Shannon Maureen Brown), who is in search of Pellegrino. The discussion resumes as Elliot proves a point that everyone enjoys looking at beautiful things.

As Maya collects her check, Finch notifies her that she has a new baby sister. After reality sinks in, Maya goes to the hospital to meet her new sister Hannah, and congratulates her father.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0617872/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,A writer in need of a job reluctantly agrees to work for her father's women's magazine.,[],TV-PG,Release date,['Philip Charles MacKenzie'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"News reporter Mya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo) is working at her desk when news anchor Christy (Emily Proctor) demands her to edit the copy for self serving motives. Offended and annoyed, Mya jokingly retypes the copy to read -gang violence is down since last year and they tell me they credit the decrease to removal of the frontal lobe of my brain and in a related story I wet myself- subsequently Mya is fired.

We catch up with Mya again three months later where she has come back from a job interview. Her roommate Wally (Chris Hogan) shares some good news about a potential date as Mya shares her news about a promising interview with Newsweek. Sadly, Wally informs her that she received a message that she didnt get the job based on her references. Wally talks Mya into visiting her father Jack Gallo (George Segal), owner and chief editor of Blush fashion magazine. Mya has not seen her father in a year because he married a much younger woman that went to school with both her and Wally.

When Mya arrives in the Blush lobby, a gaggle of very tall, beautiful, and slender models are being assessed by fashion editor / former supermodel (Noxzema Gotcha Girl) Nina Van Horn (Wendy Malick), and sexually harassed by executive assistant to Mr. Gallo, Dennis Finch (David Spade). Mya tells Finch she is there to see Jack Gallo and is quickly put down. She then approaches Nina and is also put down but with a quick come back puts Nina in her place. Finch quickly seizes the opportunity to suck up and directs Mya to Jacks office.

Jack is pleasantly surprised to see his Mya but they are interrupted by Elliot (Enrico Colantoni), who tries to tell her that Jack is always talking about her and that he is so happy to finally meet her; Elliot is quickly discovered to be a liar when he inadvertently calls her Myra instead of Mya. Nina enters the room regarding a model dispute with Elliot and the dispute is settled by Jack.

When Elliot and Nina leave the room Nina has an opportunity to speak with Jack only to find that he already knows her situation and is more than happy to give her money. When Mya tries to offer a way to pay him back, Jack suggests writing an article for the magazine. Thinking she is a serious journalist Mya turns it down but then changes her mind when Jack says it will be a good way for them to spend time together.

No sooner do the words come out of his mouth when a call comes in that his wife Ally is in the hospital delivering their baby. Mya is upset as she had no idea and stays to write a negative article about her - father the jackass- .

Nina and Finch peer over the desks at Mya discussing newly discovered information about her such as - Mya is a Stanford Graduate, was on the deans list, has no current boyfriend, and is on the pill - Nina fears that Mya is trying to take over the magazine as Elliot joins the conversation.

Later, Elliot asks Mya her opinion about photos of different models for her article and soon discovers that she is a feminist who is opposed to messages models send to young girls. Elliot is lured away by model Lorena (Shannon Maureen Brown), who is in search of Pellegrino. The discussion resumes as Elliot proves a point that everyone enjoys looking at beautiful things.

As Mya collects her check, Finch notifies her that she has a new baby sister. After reality sinks in, Mya goes to the hospital to meet her new sister Hannah, and congratulates her father. Although happy, Jack is afraid to make the same mistakes he made with Mya. Mya reassures Jack that all Hannah needs is her fathers love and time. Jack talks Mya into helping him run the magazine so he can have more time for his new family. Mya agrees."

They explain their origins to the audience, as well as how they took down The Puppet Master, a villain who can control people's minds.",[],TV-Y7,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"The pilot episode begins with the Fantastic Four locked in an underwater battle against Prince Namor. Moments later, we discover the Fantastic Four are in a television studio, recounting the battle for the audience as they make an appearance on Dick Clark's scholarship telethon. The Four are selling copies of their team autobiography to raise funds, which leads to Clark inquiring about the origin of the Four's superpowers. Reed Richards proceeds to tell of his discovery of a mysterious celestial body streaking through our solar system and his desire to investigate it. Sue Storm, her brother Johnny, and friend Ben Grimm refused to allow him to go into space alone and so they climb into Reed's rocket and set off for the mysterious object's path. What Reed had failed to realize was how the cosmic radiation emitted from the object would affect the energy field surrounding Earth and, as a result, the rocket and its crew were basked in unusually potent cosmic rays.

The rocket crash-lands on an island and each of the team begin to discover how their bodies/DNA have reacted to the incident: Sue has gained the power of invisibility, Reed can stretch his body to incredible lengths, Johnny can create/control flame and fly, and Ben has transformed into a creature of stone. From that moment, the team adopts their new hero personas and return to New York when they rent an apartment. The team's first opportunity to display their new-found powers arrives in the form of a man in a trance who climbs atop a bridge and moves to jump. The team manage to save the man's life, and in the process, gain the attention of the man behind the trance - the Puppetmaster.

The Puppetmaster becomes obsessed with the Fantastic Four's superpowers and fears they may pose a problem with his master plan of using his sculptures to control the population of the local prison and using them to terrorize and control the city. To prevent the Four from interfering, the Puppetmaster creates a sculpture of the Thing and forces him to come to his apartment. Sue is worried that the Thing's sudden departure is related to a recent fight he had with Reed and follows him invisibly. The two arrive at the Puppetmaster's home and his blind daughter, Alicia Masters, is able to sense Sue's presence. Not taking any chances, the Puppetmaster lures Alicia and Ben behind protective glass and floods the room with sleeping gas. Sue is soon incapacitated and the Puppetmaster decides to use this turn of events to his advantage; he disguises Alicia as Sue and sends her back with the Thing hoping that the two of them can help him bring down the team and free the path to his total control over the city."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0577660/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"The Fantastic Four continues their story. The Puppet Master has them where he wants them, but things don't go as planned for him.",[],TV-Y7,Release date,[],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"The episode begins with Dick Clark and announcer Gary Owens recapping the events from the first installment before the Fantastic Four continue to recount their first encounter with the Puppetmaster for Dick Clark's college scholarship telethon audience. Once the Puppetmaster sent Alicia (disguised as Sue Storm) and the entranced Thing to the Baxter Building to deal with the remaining two members of the Fantastic Four, he tunes in to a news broadcast from the new ""escape-proof"" maximum security prison. As he watches, he uses a sculpture of vicious criminal Slash Curtis to instigate a riot, steal the guard's weapon, and enact a jailbreak. During the commotion, the reporter stops the prison warden for a series of questions and the Puppetmaster takes photos of his face from which to create a new sculpture. Back at the Baxter Building, the Thing wastes no time in carrying out his orders. Upon arriving, he throws Johnny through a bookcase and bursts into Reed's lab. Reed immediately realizes the Thing is in a trance and not controlling his own actions. He lures the Thing into crashing through a cylinder of his recent experimental formula; Reed's formula not only succeeds to knocking the Thing out of his trance but even returns him to human form. When the fighting's over, Alicia steps forward in confusion, removes her blonde wig, and begs for someone to tell her what's going on. Ben explains what he's learned of the Puppetmaster and explains that Sue is being held captive. Moments later, Reed's formula proves to have been a temporary fix and Ben returns to his stone figure. The team has Alicia wait at the Baxter Building and, as they go to leave for the Puppetmaster's home in the Villages, Reed introduces the Thing to his newest invention - the Fantasticar.

The Puppetmaster soon completes his neuro-kinetic clay statue of the prison warden and uses his command over the man to open the prison gates, releasing prisoners into the city. Slash Curtis and his crew seize the warden and hold him hostage in the cell block, with Slash designating himself as negotiator. Meanwhile, Sue is chained to a chair in the Puppetmaster's loft. She shuffles to a nearby table where the key to her shackles had been left. She unlocks her restraints, turns invisible, and goes to escape but the Puppetmaster discovers her escape and uses a fresh Invisible Woman statue to halt her. Reed, Johnny, and Ben arrive and confront the Puppetmaster, who unleashes a robot drone to slow them down while he makes his escape with Sue. Ben easily pounds the drone into submission but the Puppetmaster has taken Sue aboard a helicopter and is already too far for Reed to reach. Johnny jumps into action but the Puppetmaster spots his follower and throws Sue from the helicopter as a distraction. She's rescued from the fall by Johnny and they regroup with the others. Their first plan of action: get to the prison, halt the riot, and save the warden. The team arrive in the Fantasticar just in time to watch as Slash's goons take the television reporter hostage.

We are returned briefly to Dick Clark's telethon where the Thing is selling more copies of the Fantastic Four's autobiography before Clark requests that the team continue with their story. Recognizing the risk in a direct assault on the prison, Reed forms a plan. The Human Torch and the Thing bust into the prison from below, tunneling through the ground and bursting out amidst Slash's assembled crew. The Thing captures Slash and his thugs in a cage while Reed and Sue rescue the reporter from her two captors. With the prison situation under control, the Thing visits Alicia in a new home Reed and the team had acquired for her in an effort to keep her safe from her evil stepfather. Alicia displays the Thing a sculpture she had created of him and we briefly see the budding feelings the two have for each other in a tender moment.

The team arrives at the Puppetmaster's home and Reed neutralizes the remainder of his neuro-kinetic clay, but the Puppetmaster is no where to be found. Reed realizes where he must be heading and the team jet off to Alicia's new apartment where Reed expects the villain will turn up. The Puppetmaster arrives at Alicia's apartment to retrieve his prized possession: a statue he'd sculpted of himself in his true Puppetmaster glory. With the puppet, he plans to control the governments of the world and seize control. Alicia fights to retrieve the puppet from her stepfather and, in the ensuing struggle, the Puppetmaster and his puppet are thrown out the window to the street below. The Fantastic Four arrive a moment later and the Puppetmaster has disappeared.

The episode concludes in Dick Clark's studio where the telethon has reached $5 million and Ben continues to pitch copies of the team's book to the studio audience."

The team arrive just as the crystals in the demonstration transform a microscopic organism into an monstrous octopus creature and the presenter removes his disguise to reveal that he is Prince Namor, ruler of Atlantis. Namor has come to the surface to warn the surface-dwellers of the effects of their pollution and sets the creature loose on the audience. The Human Torch moves to bring down Namor but the Atlantean king calls upon the help of whales, who blast the Torch with water and put him out. The Thing scuffles with Namor (who the Thing discovers is much stronger than he appears) while Reed ties the sea creatures many tentacles in a knot. Sue goes to trap Namor in a force field but he side-steps and she traps the Thing. Namor takes a moment to appreciate Sue's beauty before retreating to the ocean. The team is left to ponder this new adversary while Namor returns home to Atlantis where Lady Dorma suggests the two of them might leave for a vacation. The two are interrupted by General Krang, one of Namor's military leaders, who informs him that his armies are ready for action. Krang requests that, should he bring victory to Atlantis over the surface-dwellers, he receive Lady Dorma as his prize. Namor demands the two leave him in peace, tired of their bickering. Meanwhile, the Fantastic Four have settled in on a beach to discuss the night's events. Sue, tired of Reed's science obsession, wanders off from the team. Once she is alone, she is grabbed by Namor and taken into the ocean. Namor brings her to Atlantis where he explains that he means no harm and only asks that she stay as his queen. Sue refuses, but Namor threatens to unleash his armies on the surface world as retribution for the pollution it has dumped into the oceans if she does not comply.

The remaining Fantastic Four wonder over Sue's disappearance and Johnny soon discovers Namor's footprints where Sue went missing. In Atlantis, Lady Dorma begins showing her distaste in Namor's decision to take a surface-dweller as his queen. Back at the Baxter Building, Reed has created some new inventions to aid in their mission to save Sue: a rod to help detect and track Namor, an oxygenating spray to allow the team to breathe underwater, and a special watch for Johnny. Meanwhile, Lady Dorma approaches General Krang and explains that she believes Namor has weakened and his love for the surface-dweller is a disgrace. Using Krang's desire for Dorma against him, Dorma convinces him to attack the surface world and usurp Namor of his throne. Namor passes the time explaining to Sue just how damaging the pollution of the surface world has been to the oceans. Sue expresses that they had meant no harm and hopes there can be peace between the two worlds. The team arrives in the Fantasticar and Namor responds to their attacks by opening the palace dome, flooding it. Namor realizes that the palace is empty and Lady Dorma arrives to explain that Krang has taken every available soldier to the surface to wage war. Reed, Johnny, and Ben burst into the chamber and Namor opts to make his escape, knowing that he will not succeed in winning over Sue this time.

Namor heads for New York City to stop Krang's invasion. Namor fails to convince Krang to end the assault, with Krang accusing him of treason for his love of the Earth woman. Feeling responsible for Krang's actions, Namor joins the Fantastic Four but refuses to hurt any citizen of Atlantis. The forces of Krang's army are too numerous for the Fantastic Four, so Reed and the Thing devise to rob them of the water they need to breathe. Namor confronts Krang, who lunges an eel/spear at the Atlantean king. Lady Dorma, in a change of heart, leaps into the eel/spear's path and is killed. Reed has reached a beam-emitter on the Baxter Building and begins using it to evaporate the water in the Atlantean helmets. Without the ability to breathe, the army is forced to retreat back into the ocean, to Krang's dismay. Krang escapes into the water and Reed reveals to Johnny that the watch he'd given him was thermite and would allow him to continue burning underwater. So, the Human Torch dives into the ocean, grabs Krang, and brings him to justice. Namor explains to Reed that, with the city safe, he is returning to Atlantis to rebuild his kingdom and honor the death of Lady Dorma. Reed offers to use his molecular resuscitator and is able to return Dorma to life. With Dorma alive, Namor returns to the ocean and the Human Torch arrives to explain he has dropped Krang in prison."

Young women are being brutally slashed to death by a mysterious man who seems to possess superhuman strength and properties. The murderer is especially brazen; one girl, a go-go dancer, is killed in her dressing room. The club's bartender and bouncers all confront her assailant, but he hurls them aside like rag dolls. Another young woman is attacked as she walks along a semi-deserted street, the killer leaping onto the sidewalk from an impossibly high fire escape. The murders bear all the same qualities as those committed by Jack The Ripper.

Angry with Kolchak because of the way he constantly makes enemies at the police department, Vincenzo assigns him to fill in for Miss Emily's advice column while she is on vacation. Even worse, he assigns the Ripper case to Updike, which infuriates Kolchak. Kolchak pursues it anyway, latching onto a Ripper sighting that he overhears on his police scanner. The cops have the Ripper cornered on top of a building, but as Kolchak snaps pictures, the Ripper takes numerous bullet hits, wards off any policeman who dares approach him, and finally leaps to the sidewalk from the top of the building. Not only is he unharmed, he destroys a police cruiser in the process and escapes. Kolchak's photographs are worthless, since his flash didn't illuminate much, but at a press conference he gets an unexpected lead: the Ripper has sent a letter to a rival newspaper, directly contacting one of Carl's associates, Jane Plum. Jane bargains with Kolchak for information and tells him that the Ripper refers to himself as the authentic ""Jack the Ripper"". She has researched the phenomenon and feels it is a contagious psychosis; she has discovered that Ripper-style murders have been occurring throughout history, worldwide, separated by decades and always sticking to a similar pattern.

Another murder occurs at a massage parlor; Ron is unable to follow up on it, repulsed by the details of the killings. Kolchak tries to visit the crime scene immediately after the slaying and is turned away; instead he meets an elderly couple stopped in traffic just outside. The man's car has been damaged, and he claims the front end was crushed when he slammed into a pedestrian.

Vincenzo sees Jane's byline in the rival paper and is shocked by her angle on the story (""cannibalism!""), unaware that Carl has given her the idea. Carl tells Vincenzo that he is helping Updike by researching Ripper murders. He neglects to tell the boss that he has ignored the Miss Emily letters; Vincenzo finds them all stuffed into Carl's desk.

Jane prints an offer to meet the Ripper on his own terms, but Carl is concerned; he feels the murders are too similar. He draws a connection to an incident where a Ripper murderer was sentenced to be hanged in Germany; the attempt failed, but Carl sees an image in one of his blurry photographs of the Ripper: a rope burn on his neck. Jane says that it's impossible for all of the murders to have been committed by the same person, as it would make him over 130 years old.

Carl decides to stake out the massage parlor; the murder patterns of the past dictate that the Ripper will strike in the same place again. Instead, Carl is nearly arrested when the undercover police officer misunderstands his intentions and arrests him for a lewd proposal. Fortunately for Kolchak, the Ripper strikes immediately afterwards and attempts to murder the police officer. She and her partner ward him off and he takes off running, resulting in another police chase. This one ends in his capture when the Ripper attempts to leap onto an electrified fence.

Carl is now convinced that the killer stalking the streets is Jack the Ripper himself; he has uncovered news articles about numerous attempts to execute The Ripper throughout the decades, all of which failed. The police treat Carl as if he is insane, and in fact they have captured The Ripper and incarcerated him. But even as they speak, the Ripper rips the large maximum security door out of the concrete wall of his cell, escaping once again. The police are still in denial and begin searching for an accomplice that they feel has sprung The Ripper from jail.

Carl realizes that he must face The Ripper alone if anybody is going to stop him, and he tries to figure out where The Ripper could be living. Ironically, the answer lies in the Miss Emily column. Carl recalls one of the first letters he read that week, written by an elderly woman who claims her neighbor has ""x ray eyes"" and goes out in the evening wearing a funny suit. Kolchak traces her and visits her home, and she reveals that her mysterious neighbor lives in a spooky, rundown house near her own.

Through his research, Carl theorizes that the only thing that can harm The Ripper is electricity; that is why the police were able to subdue him after he touched the electrified fence. Carl rigs a trap for The Ripper and then sneaks into his house. While he is in there, The Ripper comes home and confronts him. In the struggle, Carl discovers the body of Jane, who has indeed fallen victim to the supernatural psychopath. Kolchak gets The Ripper to chase him through the grounds of the house, leading him directly into his trap: a small bog of water that Carl has rigged with electricity. Throwing the switch, Carl electrocutes The Ripper, resulting in a huge fire that destroys all of the evidence of the incident. Before fire can consume it, The Ripper's body disintegrates, and Carl's only souvenir is one of the Ripper's shoes. Carl phones the British manufacturer and discovers that the particular style of shoe went out of production over a hundred years ago."

Lucas advises Potter to sell now, picks up a bowl, and drops it on the floor. Potter tells Stuart to get out and tells Lucas that the store isn't for sale.

The stagecoach stops and circuit judge Oren Travis gets out.

Lucas smashes another of Potter's display cases. Travis hears the noise, as Stuart walks out and Potter yells after him to tell Stuart what he can do with his money. Lucas turns and shoots Potter dead, as Oren and the townspeople watch. Oren borrows a shotgun from the coach's guard, and walks over to the store as Lucas fires another shot into Potter's body as Lucas's two men look on from outside. Mary comes out when she hears the noise, and Lucas yells at the watching townspeople to get on with their business.

The Seven ride into town, and Oren aims the shotgun at Lucas and tells him to drop his gunbelt. Lucas claims self-defense, but Oren doesn't believe him and threatens to shoot all three of them with the shotgun before they can get a shot off. Mary comes over and tells Oren to be careful, and Oren tells her to move away. The Seven are watching, and take up positions nearby.

Chris stands next to Oren, and Lucas tells the Seven it isn't their fight. They stay, and Oren repeats his order and tells Lucas that he's under arrest, and introduces himself as the new circuit judge. Lucas quickly complies.

As the undertaker hauls Potter's body away, and Potter's wife and children watch. Oren locks Stuart up in jail, and Mary tells him the marshal let all the prisoners go before the marshal left town. Stuart advises Oren to let him go, and Oren tells him that Stuart is going to stand trial for murder. Mary tells Oren, the father of her dead husband, that Lucas' uncle Stuart raises cattle and thinks he and his friends run the territory.

Oren still isn't impressed, and tells Stuart that he's hung 23 men like him. He leaves with Mary, and asks her who Chris is. Mary says that he's a hired gun, and Oren tells her that he's going to get a drink at the saloon. Oren then tells the townspeople outside who he is, and he asks for any volunteers for the jury. The townspeople quickly excuse them while Lucas' men watch, and Oren says that he'll conduct a bench trial himself.

In the bar, Chris is drinking and Vin joins him. Vin says that he was thinking of heading out early for Tascosa where he's wanted for murder. Chris advises him to give it a few days, but Vin figures he needs to turn himself in before someone tries to kill him and claim the bounty on his head before he can clear his name. Chris agrees to go with him to Tascosa and leaves.

Nathan and Josiah are sitting nearby, and Josiah tells his friend that he knew he was going to die. He tells Nathan that all of the ""lost souls"" in Four Corners need him. Nathan says that he needs to change the bandage on Josiah's wound, and calls Buck over to help him take Josiah to his office.

Ezra and J.D. ware watching, and J.D. wonders if all of the Seven are going their own ways. Ezra says that they should, just as Oren comes in and offers $20 for a week to be sheriff. The townspeople ignore him and Oren raises his offer to $30, but no one takes the offer. J.D. finally goes over and offers his services, and Oren tells him that he's too young. When Oren says that there's no glory in the job, J.D. says that he isn't looking for any. Oren looks over at Ezra and asks if J.D. is the only brave men among them. When no one answers, J.D. goes over to Ezra and tells him that he's the new sheriff. Oren recognizes Oren as a bail-jumper from Fort Laramee, and tells J.D. to arrest Ezra. Ezra claims that it's a case of mistaken identity, but Oren knows that Ezra has a holdout derringer. He triggers it, and J.D. reluctantly arrests Ezra.

One of Lucas' thugs, Flint, rides to the James match and tells Lucas that his nephew has been arrested. Lucas prepares to ride into town and free Stuart.

In the jail, Oren tells J.D. to shoot Ezra if he tries to escape. Once the judge leaves, Ezra tells J.D. to let him out. J.D. says that he can't, because he's just doing his job. Buck comes in and asks J.D. what's wrong with him taking on the job of sheriff. He figures J.D. is out of his mind, and J.D. insists that he'll be fine. J.D. takes out the sheriff's gun and spins the barrel, and Buck tells him not to do that in case the cylinder comes out. Buck tries to give J.D. ""a few pointers"", and says that he was a lawman once. He tells J.D. to pin his new badge behind his lapel, and J.D. falls over in his chair. Buck, realizing that it's hopeless, leaves.

That night at her office, Oren is staying with Mary, who is looking at a drawing her son Billy made of the Travis manor where he's staying. Oren and says that they should go to get something to eat. They talk about Oren's son-Mary's father--and tells Mary that her son wonders why Mary doesn't live with them. Oren insists on riding his grandson's most-recent letter to Mary, which includes an invitation to stay with him. The judge asks why Mary doesn't sell the paper and come home, and Mary insists that Four Corners is her home. Nobody wants the newspaper anyway, and she hoped once Oren settled the town down, it would be safe to bring Billy there. Oren warns that it's hard to make changes when he can't even raise a jury, and Mary drops the matter and tells Oren to get them a table at the restaurant.

Lucas and Flint ride into Four Corners, past the sheriff's office. Chris comes out of the saloon as Lucas comes in, and Lucas tells the judge that they need to keep the homesteaders out. He offers to pay Oren off, and Oren says that he was there and it was murder. Lucas warns that there might be another murder if Oren doesn't let Stuart go, and Oren tells Lucas that if he dies, the entire Union army will come down on the rancher. Lucas just calmly shrugs and leaves.

The next day, Mary is handing out newspapers. Buck approaches her and helps her. Mary sees Chris going into the general store, and Buck reads an editorial Mary wrote about the need for justice. Buck points out that he's not a resident and can't serve on a jury in town, and when Mary asks about Chris, Buck points out that Chris is a drifter like him... unless there's something for him to stay for.

In his cell, Ezra is trying to eat the jailhouse food and talks to Stuart. Stuart says that he'll eat lunch when he gets out, and he's leaving when his men get there. Ezra offers him a game of poker, and if Ezra wins then they ""forget to lock the door behind them"". If Stuart wins, he can kill Ezra.

Mary goes into the store where Chris is, and says that she lost her husband and knows what Chris went through when he lost his wife and child, and Buck has told her about it. Chris tells her that she doesn't know what he's going through, and leaves.

Several townsmen go up to the sheriff's office and their leader, Mr. Conklin, tells J.D. that they want him to turn Lucas loose. J.D. says that he has to stand trial, and Conklin tells him that they don't want a trial. He warns that Stuart's men will come back and shoot up the town, and J.D. grabs a rifle and tells him that they're trying to stop innocent people from dying. Potter's widow, Gloria, shows up and reminds Conklin that Potter was a friend of his. She can't believe that now Conklin wants to let Stuart go. Conklin says that they can't risk more innocent people dying.

Conklin figures that J.D. is bluffing and moves forward. Vin comes up and fires a shot into the air, then stands beside J.D. and ask if there's a problem. Conklin says that they don't want ""their kind"" in Four Corners, but Vin isn't impressed and the mob disburses. J.D. thanks Vin for the backup.

Buck is getting a shave at the barber, and Chris comes in behind him, takes the razor from the barber, and puts it to Buck's throat. Chris tells Buck not to discuss his personal history with anyone, and Buck wonders what he's supposed to do when people ask. Telling him not to say anything, Chris leaves.

Oren tells J.D. to get some witnesses to the shooting, at gunpoint if he has to. J.D. agrees, and a storm rolls in. The judge goes to the salon with Stuart, and waits for the trial to start. Flint and two other armed men ride into town, and J.D. comes into the saloon and tells Oren that nobody will testify and there's company coming. Oren calls the court to order as Flint and his men barge in. The three men order drinks, ignoring Oren when he says the saloon is called.

J.D. draws his gun and tells the trio to put their gunbelts on the bar. His cylinder falls out and rolls across the floor, and Flint chuckles. Oren grabs his gun on the table in front of him, and J.D. ducks and hits his head on a post as the men shoot at him. They miss, and Oren shoots them.

Chris and Vin are preparing to ride out of town, and hear the gunshots.

Flint shoots and hits Oren in the shoulder. He gets the keys to free Stuart.

Chris and Vin run over, and Flint's men outside open fire on them. The two gunmen take cover and return fire.

Stuart tells Flint not to kill Oren because he's a Federal judge... and he wants to do it. Chris comes in through the window and shoots at them. Stuart runs out and Chris shoots Flint. Vin guns down one man, but Stuart rides off with the surviving man. Chris has J.D. get Nathan to tend to Oren, and J.D. goes out and blocks Vin's shot at Stuart as the latter rides off. Mary arrives and goes to her father-in-law.

Later, Nathan tends to Oren's wound while Mary looks on and tries to help. Chris comes in and asks how Oren is doing. Mary tells him that her father-in-law is stubborn, and Chris tells her that he's leaving and Mary should go back where she came from. She says that she swore on her husband's grave that she wouldn't become a victim or abandon his dreams, and it's all she has left to give Billy. Chris accepts that and warns that Lucas will walk right through her, and he'd hate to see Billy become an orphan. Vin comes in and tells Mary that a couple of James' men are asking how Oren is doing. Chris figures that it might be better if Oren dies.

Later at the town cemetery, Chris, Vin, and J.D. bury a fake coffin filled with rocks, faking Oren's death. Mary is on hand, as the only mourner. James' men are watching, and J.D. suggests that they do a eulogy for the watchers' sake.

Later at Nathan' office, Oren wakes up and Chris, watching the window, tells him that he's safe. The judge asks where Mary is, but wants to talk to Chris before he gets her. Oren thanks Chris for backing him up the other day, and says that he had a son killed and wonders if was worth it. The judge tells Chris that being shot makes someone think about what they believe in, and asks Chris what he believes in. Chris admits that he doesn't believe in much, and Oren tells him that it looks like more than most.

Nathan and Josiah are repairing the church roof, and Nathan asks his friend if he's saved any souls yet. Before Josiah can respond, Chris arrives and says that he's not leaving, and he has a little ""situation"". The two men agree to go with him. Buck is drinking in the saloon, and Chris and Vin find him and tell him about the job. Buck isn't interested in ""committing suicide"", and leaves with a woman over his shoulder.

Chris goes to get J.D. J.D. tosses tossing his sheriff's badge in a drawer, and Chris tells Ezra that he broke the law and isn't taking him with him. Ezra says that he knows where Stuart went, and Chris points out that they know as well. The gambler says that Stuart likes him, and he can get them in. Chris asks if Ezra plans on running out on him again, and Ezra swears on his mother. J.D. points out that Ezra told him his mother is still alive, and Ezra dismisses it as a figure of speech. Chris agrees to let Ezra ride with them.

The six gunfighters ride out of town, and Mary watches them go. They approach Lucas' ranch and see him holding a boxing match outside of the heavily-guarded hacienda. Vin tells the others that there's more than expected, but they figure it's time to do it. The gunfighters ride up to the hacienda, and Josiah helps a worker with a bundle of flour while Vin goes to take out the sentry on the roof. J.D. secretly cuts the thugs' saddle straps, and Ezra approaches Lucas at ringside and claims he bet his freedom in a poker game against J.D. and won. He asks to talk to Lucas about something ""delicate"" in private, and Lucas agrees.

Josiah gets behind Stuart, and Vin gets behind the sentry and punches him unconscious. Meanwhile, Ezra draws his holdout on Lucas, and Chris comes up and they take Lucas away. Vin takes up the sentry position as Stuart calls on his thugs and then goes over with Flint and asks Lucas where he's going. Chris yells says that Lucas is going for a ride, and then tells Stuart that Vin has a rifle trained on the rancher. Realizing that it's a raid, Stuart offers Chris double what he's getting. Chris tells him that there's some things money can't buy, and leaves with Lucas and Ezra.

Stuart yells at his men to stop them, and Vin opens fire on him. The rancher quickly tells everyone not to move, but one thug goes for his gun. Nathan throws a knife into the thug's arm, and Josiah takes Flint's gun. Stuart tells his men to let Chris and the others go, and wonders who they are. Chris tells him that it doesn't matter and leaves with Lucas. Nathan and Josiah follow them, and Stuart sends his men after them

Flint goes up to Vin's position, and discovers that Vin propped his hat in place as a decoy. Stuart sends his men after the gunfighters, as Vin joins the others and they ride off. Some of the thugs fall off their horses when the cut straps break, but the rest ride off after Lucas and the gunfighters. The thugs close in, and J.D. tells the others that he couldn't take care of all the horses. Buck shoots the two lead thugs and rides out, and tells Chris that it's a good thing he came along and the remaining thugs ride back to the hacienda.

When the Seven return to town, Conklin confronts J.D., furious that he brought Lucas back. When Conklin says that Oren is dead, Mary helps her father-in-law out and Oren says that the news of his death is premature. Oren says that the Seven risked their lives to bring Lucas to justice, and asks for twelve townsmen to serve as a jury. The townsmen agree, and take Lucas to jail.

Oren asks the Seven to stick around for 30 days until he comes back, and will pay them $1 a day plus room and board. J.D. agrees if everyone else is, and Oren gives Ezra a pardon if he'll agree. The others agree, and Oren thanks them for what they did. Mary echoes his sentiment, and they go into the saloon for Lucas' trial."

They arrive and Buck explains that the owner, Wickes, brought in ""working girls"" for the local ranchers. Buck and J.D. go into a tent saloon to have some whiskey first, and J.D. notices Chris sitting at a table. Buck advises J.D. not to approach their friend, and they go to the bar.

Wickes comes over and greets them, and says the first drink is free to new customers. He tells them they should let him know if they need anything, and leaves. Two men come in, and Wickes figures that the head man wants the usual and calls one of the prostitutes, Nora, over. Nora hesitantly comes over, and the prostitute sitting with Chris, Lydia, comes over.

Nora tells Wickes that she's not feeling so good and tries to leave, and Wickes grabs her arm. Lydia comes over and tries to take over for Nora. Wickes tells Nora that she's coming with him and drags her out, and Lydia goes back to Chris and says she's fine but Nora isn't.

J.D. looks over the girls, and finally picks one, Emily. He says that he can meet her on his own despite Buck's offer, finishes off his drink for courage, and goes over to Emily. She takes him to his tent, and Buck figures he'd better follow along and make sure J.D. doesn't ""trip over his own feet"". He watches Emily lead J.D. into her tent, then hears a scream as Wickes slaps Nora when she tries to tell him she won't go with the man.

Wickes threatens to kill Nora if she ever questions his authority again, and Buck goes over and grabs Wickes' hand. When Wickes throws a punch at Buck, Buck easily ducks it and knocks Wickes down. Lydia runs over to check on Nora, and says that she needs a doctor. Wickes tackles Buck, and two of his men grab Buck and Wickes beats him. Chris fires a warning shot and tells Buck that they're leaving, and taking Nora with them. J.D. comes out, gun drawn, disarms Wickes' men, and rides off with Chris, Buck, and Nora. Before they go, Wickes tells Chris that it isn't over, and glares at Lydia.

Back in Four Corners, the gunfighters take Nora to Nathan. He tends to her in his ""office"", and when Chris and Vin check on her, Nathan tells them that Nora is in bad shape. Nathan says that Nora has old bruises and someone has been treating her rough, and Nora says that she has to get back because Wickes will be mad. She explains that Wickes paid her way there and she has to pay him back with interest. Nora says that she came because Wickes promises her so much, and the more she works the more she owes. Mary arrives and asks to talk to Chris privately.

At the bath house, J.D. and Buck are taking baths and J.D. is telling Josiah about what Buck did. Josiah figures that it's a righteous fight, and J.D. asks what got into Buck. He says that Emily said she might not even charge him, and Buck and Josiah both chuckle at the idea. Josiah insists that sex with a women should be a spiritual experience, and they have to do it right because when Adam and Eve did it, they were tossed out of Paradise so they have to make sure their loss wasn't in vain. Buck agrees with Josiah, and J.D. is irritated that everyone is giving him advice on his sex life.

Mary tells Chris that he has a responsibility to Nora since he rescued her. When Mary objects to Nora's ""kind"", just as Emily and Nora ride into town on wagon with the other Wickestown girls. The men come out to help them out of the wagon, and Chris and Mary come over. Lydia asks about Nora, and Nathan assures her that Nora will be fine. The older prostitute says that they snuck away from Wickes, and says that she left when she saw that there were men who would stand up to Wickes. Mary glares at Chris, and Nora asks for a safe place. When Mary tells Nora that it's best if she move on, Nora says that it might be best if Mary lets the Seven speak for themselves. She takes offense when Mary makes it clear she wants the working girls out of town.

J.D. and Emily smile at each other, and Josiah notices.

Chris goes into the saloon, and Buck follows him in. When Buck asks what they should do, Chris tells him that he can handle it because he picked the fight. Buck says that the women will stay. Mary comes in, overhears him, and disagrees.

Ezra ushers the townsmen back, and offers to escort them to the bathhouse. As he leads them off, Ezra suggests talking about a ""solution"" to their predicament.

Vin rides the women's back trail to see if Wickes' men followed them, and spots them coming. He rides back to Four Corners as the men approach.

Mary argues with Buck, and Chris says that it's a free country if they want to stay. Mary wants the right to raise children in a safe community. Vin comes in and tells them about the men approaching, and Chris and Buck go out with him. The men ride into town, and their leader Quint tells the others to tear the place apart and find the girls.

The men go into the saloon, and Quint comes across Vin. Quint says that they're looking for some girls and tells Vin to stay out of the way while they ""look around"". Vin tells him that the pickings are awfully slim. Two of the men go to the stable and find J.D. shodding a horse. Once they leave, the girls emerge from the hay in the stable.

Buck stands in front of a crate hiding two more of the prostitutes, and after Wickes' men ride on, Buck tells the prostitutes to keep down. When two more men break into Nathan's office, he's ""tending"" to Ezra, who claims that he has consumption and that it's highly contagious. The thugs quickly leave. More men search the church and find Josiah at the pulpit. Emily is hiding in the pulpit, and Josiah invites the men to join him in prayer. The three thugs leave, and Josiah asks Emily how his performance was.

Quint goes into the bathhouse but finds no one. He leaves, unaware that Lydia was hiding in a tub.

Vin watches Quint and his men ride out of town.

Chris goes to the bathhouse and finds Lydia taking a bath. She says that she isn't shy, and Chris tells her that it's best if the prostitutes go on their way. He offers to take the girls to a nearby town to catch a train. Lydia says that they'll stay and make a stand, and Chris tells her that if they do they'll be on their own. She says that they always have been, and Chris leaves.

Outside, Chris tells Vin that they need a new plan. Meanwhile, Ezra is talking to some of the women and says that they should become mail-order brides, and he'll be glad to arrange it. J.D. is nearby and watching Emily, as Ezra explains that he'll only find them well-off husbands and collect a small ""finder's fee"". Emily wonders why men like that would want women like them, and Ezra says that he'll tutor them at his ""charm school"".

Buck comes up to J.D. and tells him to go over to Emily. When J.D. suggests that Buck meet up with one of the women, Buck says that he never pays for sex. Buck explains that he respects women, and that buys him a lot of kindness. He says that he grew up in a brothel, and his mother was a prostitute. Buck insists that she was a saint.

Mary watches Chris talking to Vin from her office. Lydia comes in and asks if she could talk to Mary about a job. Mary tells her that she doesn't have any positions, and Lydia says that she's seen people like Mary before. When Mary takes offense, Lydia figures that Chris is Mary's and says that she'll leave them alone. Mary insists that their business is professional, and explains that Oren hired them to protect the town. Lydia asks if Chris is fair game, and Mary defensively says that he is. The prostitute smiles and says ""Good"", and then leaves.

That night at Wickestown, Wickes berates Quint for failing to find the prostitutes. He figures Lydia wouldn't leave Nora behind, and Quint tells him about Nathan. When Quint says that there wasn't any women in the town, Wickes slaps him and points out how strange that was, and says they'll pay Four Corners a visit the next day.

The next morning, Josiah is standing watch from the church bell tower. He sees Wickes and his men coming and sounds the bell to warn the others. The men ride into town, and all of the Seven are waiting for them, rifles out. Wickes tells them to hand over his girls, and they say that they haven't except for Wickes' men. Vin rides out of town with the wagon, and Wickes' recognizes it as his wagon and goes after it with his men.

Vin drives the wagon out of town heading for the mountains. The thugs easily cut the wagon off, and Vin leaps onto the horses and pulls the pin on the hitch as the wagon heads for the cliff. The horses take him away, and the wagon goes off the cliff. When the Seven ride up, Wickes says that he didn't drive the prostitutes off the cliff. He's not happy about how much it cost him. Chris tells Wickes to go before he does something he regrets.

Once Wickes and his men ride off, the Seven laugh since the whole thing was a ruse. The ""corpse"" from the back of the wagon are dummies. Vin arrives with the horses.

Later back in town at the church, Ezra runs his ""charm school"" with Buck filling in as one of the would be husbands. Ezra interrupts to complain the prostitute is acting too blatant. Josiah is busy scraping at the paint, and Ezra finally tells him to stop. Nathan comes in and complains that Ezra is trying to sell women off like cattle.

That night, Vin goes to the saloon and sees Lydia sitting near the bar. She assures him that she's not working, and thanks Vin for his help against Wickes. Vin says that Chris isn't there because he doesn't want to get caught between the prostitutes and the townspeople, and Lydia takes a drink of Vin's whiskey and says she's tired of making decisions based on what other people want. She then goes off to check on Nora.

Wickes has Mary in his tent, and tells her that the only thing separating him from her girls is having luck and a decent family, and asks what would happen if Mary didn't have that. He asks if Mary's pride is worth the life of her child if her husband left her.

Ezra starts singing, and shoves off a man who tries to get fresh with her. Meanwhile, the others break into the camp, catching the guards by surprise. Ezra punches the man again, and he slams into another patron and a fight breaks out. Wickes hears the commotion and goes to check it out.

Josiah punches one of the guards who broke into his church. A guard gets the drop on Buck, and Nathan pistol-whips the guard from behind, knocking him out. J.D. checks a tent and finds a prostitute undressing, and quickly excuses himself.

Chris finds Mary, knocks out her guard, and unties her. She assures Chris that she's fine, and he helps her out of the tent. Wickes returns and draws his gun on Chris, and Lydia arrives and shoots Wickes. The others arrive and Wickes--still alive--goes for his gun. Buck shoots him dead and leaves with the others.

Later in town, Emily tells Ezra that they're going to try their luck on their own. The prospective husband Ezra found want their money back, and the man from the camp turns up and asks Ezra if he sings. Ezra storms off, and Emily kisses J.D. before leaving with Nora, Lydia, and the others. Chris tips his hat to Lydia as she leaves, and she blows him a kiss.

He's ready to go, and Coltrane tells him that they'll leave within the hour. Chris looks outside and sees Buck nearby, dressed as a local. As Chris sits down at an outside table, Coltrane brings Terry out and introduces her as her safecracker like her father before her. He says that Buck was a friend of Terry, and he wants Chris to ""run herd"" on Terry.

In the upstairs hotel room, Olivia sees movement in the hall outside under the door sill. The guards see the movement as well and open the door, and find a fire in the hallway. One guard goes outside to put it out, and Buck swings down from the ceiling, kicks the man unconscious, and draws on the other guard.

Ezra goes to Maude's room and he tells her that they found Billy. Maude says that Ezra has ingratiated himself in with people in the town, and it's ripe with opportunity. She tells him about Wheeler and they spent the evening together, and suggests they use the same con on Wheeler that they used in Chicago. Ezra immediately refuses, and tells a disappointed Maude that he has the town believing he can protect it from people like Maude... and him.

Maude wonders if Ezra has joined the ranks of the employed, saying it would be undignified. She says that it's a waste of his gifts and she raised him better than that.

He says that they saved Billy, and Wheeler listens carefully as Maude sarcastically tells Ezra that now he can return Billy to Mary.

Ezra is disappointed that Maude didn't take any maternal pride in what he did, and Wheeler excuses himself. The gambler leaves, saying he's going back to the jail to find out who hired the outlaw horsemen... and then hunt their boss down and rip his throat out. He says it loud enough so everyone in the bar can hear him, and Maude tells Wheeler that she doesn't fancy watching a man dismembered. She emphasizes that's what a mob does to a man who prey on little children.

Wheeler excuses himself, and finds Josiah and the others waiting for him. Ezra and Maude join them, and Wheeler realizes that it was all an act. Mary is with them, and Wheeler says that it wasn't his idea and he had to go along with it. Wheeler tells Mary that Stephen was digging into land deeds, and he would have found out that they were fake. He says that he just wanted to talk to Stephen to get him to back off, and protected Billy as long as he could.

She hugs him and says that he's safe, and Billy looks at Frank and, recognizing him, says that Frank killed Stephen. Chris tells Billy that's it over, and Frank will pay for what he did.

The next day, Ezra escorts Maude to the waiting stagecoach and apologizes for what he said earlier. Maude ignores him and greets Buck, who wishes her a good trip. She notices that he smells like an animal and moves on. Ezra continues his conversation, trying to leave. J.D. pays Maude off for lifting his ""curse"", and Josiah tells Maude that he'll die if she leaves and kisses her hand.

He asks Oren about hanging, and the judge briefly describes it as ""short rope, long drop"".

Jock asks Oren about the man who is going to be hung, and Oren says his name is John Blackfox, and Indian drifter and horse thief. He got caught, and Oren sentenced him to be hunger. Jock is thrilled to be writing about a real-life case, and Oren isn't interested in getting a copy of Jock's most recent dime novel.

When Oren goes into the jail, J.D. tells him that the prisoner would only speak to Oren. Blackfox tells Oren that he has information and he'll give it to Oren if the judge calls off the hanging. The prisoner says that three years ago, he was at a murder but didn't do nothing. He tells Oren that there were two murders, of a woman and a boy, and they burned in a fire. The woman's last name was Larabee.

Chris soon hears about Blackfox's information, and goes to the jail. J.D. ""takes a break"", gives Chris the keys, and leaves. Chris unlocks Blackfox's cell door and confirms that he witnessed the Larabee killings. He says who he is and punches Blackfox.

Taking Blackfox out, Chris holds him under in a water trough and says that the woman and boy were his wife and son. Blackfox says that he didn't kill them, but he was hired along with two other cowboys for $50 each to scare some folks off of their land. By the time they got there, Blackfox had sobered up and told the others he'd stand guard, and got scared and ran off when he saw the flames. Chris doesn't believe him, and figures Blackfox is tailing ""jailhouse lies"" to save his skin because everyone knew about the fire.

Blackfox insists that he's telling the truth, and describes the house in detail. Chris shoves him back in the jail.

Jock interviews Nathan and Josiah and how they're part of Chris' ""gang"". Chris comes out of the jail and Jock introduces himself, saying he's going to make Chris a very famous man by coming along on Chris' ""search for justice"". Chris tells Jock that he's not coming with them, and the three men ride off with Blackfox. Jock runs to his horse loaded with camera equipment and rides after them.

As they ride along, Chris tells Blackfox tell him about the two men who rode with him that night. Blackfox says that he's never seen them before and never seen them again, and all he remembers it that one man had a single spur. The one who hired him was a hard man who rode a big horse like Robert E. Lee's. Chris realizes that it was a big gray, and a rider comes up behind them. It's Buck, who joins them and tells Chris that he heard Chris was going back. When Chris says that Buck doesn't need to come along, Buck reminds him that he's the one who talked Chris into staying in Mexico the night of his family's murder. Chris advises Buck to let it go, and Buck says that Sarah was a friend of his and he thought a lot of Chris's son.

That night, the group makes camp and Chris unhandcuffs Blackfox but tells him that if he runs, he'll hang him himself. Someone moves in the nearby forest, and the four gunmen draw and aim. Josiah and Nathan stay behind to watch Blackfox while Chris and Buck go into the forest. When Josiah sets down his revolver to pick up a rifle, Blackfox reaches for it. Nathan spots him and throws a knife into the ground at Blackfox's fingers. Josiah says that he was going to shoot Blackfox's hand off.

Chris and Buck find their stalker: Jock. He explains that he has to get the story, and hears a coyote howl in the distance. Buck jokingly offers to shoot Jock, then turns when he hears someone and tells Jock to run away.

The next morning, the group arrives at the old Larabee homestead. Chris looks at the tombstones where he buried his wife and son, and remembers the past when they were still alive, and Buck was there. Chris tells his son Adam that he has to go away for a while, and Adam should take care of Sarah, and then rides off with Buck as Sarah and Adam wave to him.

Chris tells Blackfox to tell him what happened the night of the murders. Nathan calls Chris over, saying that they found something. At the stream where the soil has washed away, there's a boot with a single silver spur next to the corpses of the two men, Nathan confirms both men were shot in the back of the head, execution-style, and figures the shooter was left-handed from the shot pattern. Chris says that they're going to the saloon in Eagle Bend to find a left-handed shooter with a big gray house.

In Eagle Bend, Chris and the others go into the saloon. The bartender isn't interested in talking, and tells Chris to go somewhere else if he's looking for information. Undeterred, Chris asks about the left-handed man. The bartender threatens to throw him out, and Chris disarms him when he goes for his shotgun behind the bar. when some of the locals try to get involved, Josiah and Buck draw their guns on them.

Chris questions the bartender again, and this time the bartender says that the left-handed man comes along once in a while. However, the bartender doesn't know the man's name. He gives a description, including the man is very clean and has a withered hand. Chris says that they're taking rooms in the boarding house next door, and tells the bartender to contact him if the shooters show up. Josiah says that he's staying in the saloon for a while, and the others leave.

After getting a letter from Oren, the sheriff agrees to let Chris lock up Blackfox in the local jail. Blackfox tells Chris that he didn't know anyone died in the fire, and is sorry about the deaths of Chris' family. Later in jail, the killer whispers to Blackfox from the cell window. Blackfox says that he's trying to save his neck, and the killer isn't thrilled that Blackfox brought Chris there. The prisoner insists that Chris hasn't found out anything, and tells the killer to murder Chris and then they'll both get what they want. The killer, Cletus Fowler, says that Blackfox has turned into a rat, and he hates rats. Cletus walks away, and Blackfox sits down on his bunk.

Chris goes to his room , and sees blood under the jam of his closet door. He opens the door and finds the bartender, dead and hanging on a closet hook. The local undertakers haul the body out, and the sheriff tells Chris to avoid trouble in town. Josiah has sent a telegram to the others. Chris goes to the saloon, and Cletus watches him go.

The next day, Chris gets angry with Josiah who is patiently waiting. Jock comes in, and Chris sees him and storms off. He admits that he followed them because they left him in the forest without food. Josiah goes to the general store to see if the killer has his gloves custom-made, while Nathan goes to the horse livery to find the big gray. Jock goes with Nathan, and wants to ask him a few questions and write a story about him.

In the street, four men open fire on Chris. Chris' friends come to his aid, while Jock stands out in the street confident that they're not shooting at him. Once of them shoots Jock's notepad out of his hand, and Josiah pulls him to cover.

A wagon pulls up, and J.D., Ezra, and Vin open fire from the back. They take down one gunman and the other three ride off. Vin shoots one in the shoulder with his rifle, and the Seven ride off after the other two. The tracks lead to Purgatory, and Jock follows them and is thrilled to see Purgatory after hearing so much about it.

As the Seven rides into town, Ezra confirms that Jock is a writer and asks if there's monetary recompense for the real-life main characters. Jock is eager to talk to Ezra and take his car.

The Seven have brought Blackfox with them, and Chris drags him into the cantina. Ezra warns Jock that the locals have some prejudices against people from New York, but Jock would rather meet some of the wanted men there.

Chris spots the gray outside the cantina, and tears up the outside of the cantina while demanding to know where the horse's owner is. A man directs Chris to a rented room, and Chris storms in and grabs the man on the bed and demands to know who hired him. The man says that he didn't try to kill Chris, and Chris draws his gun on the man and demand answers.

Nathan comes in and says that the horse hasn't been ridden in a while. The man says that he hasn't been out of town in over a week, and Chris releases the man and growls in frustration.

Outside, Buck, J.D., and Vin spot a man in a coffin. He has a bullet wound in his shoulder like the one Vin put in the gunman's shoulder, and they hear a gunshot. They go to the cantina and Ezra ""welcomes them to the festivities"" while holding bundles of cash. Jock is taking statements from the locals, and he told them that he's willing to pay anyone who will tell him about murder and mayhem.

Jock comes over and says that it's better than he ever dreamed. Ezra congratulates him, and the outlaws call Jock over to take more photos. Chris, Vin, and Nathan come in and Buck tells Chris that he found one of the shooters, dead. Meanwhile, Jock shows the Seven the photo he took, and Vin spots Cletus in the background of it. Jock confirms that it was taken an hour ago, and Blackfox confirms that Cletus hired him.

Chris goes over to the bar, shows him the photo, and asks if he knows Cletus. The man gives Cletus' name, but Chris has never heard of Cletus.

The group rides back to Eagle Bend, but no one can point them to Cletus. Chris goes to get a drink, and Vin joins him and says that some of the locals have agreed to help in the search for Cletus. Vin figures that Cletus has left town, but Chris doesn't believe it. He tells his friend that when he was ranching, a mountain lion kept killing his stock so he tracked it in the mountains. The cat was behind him the entire time, watching him, and Chris figures Cletus is doing the same. Vin wants to get Cletus first, and Chris suggests that Vin stay and have a drink.

Later, Chris stays behind and the others split up to search the area. That night at the saloon, an apparently drunk Chris yells for Cletus to show himself, and fires his gun at the ceiling. Once he runs out of bullets, Chris tosses his gun away and collapses on the floor, passed out. Cletus comes in, gun drawn, with three other armed thugs. Cletus tells Chris that he's found him, and that the money was right for him to kill Chris' family.

Cletus says that he guarantees the anonymity of his clients, but he was hired to go after Chris and his family got in the way. He was going to kill Chris, but Chris ran off. Chris asks about Blackfox, and Cletus says that he eviscerated Blackfox in his cell.

Chris staggers to his feet, and Chris ""sobers up, grabs a gun he hid under a table, and shoots at Cletus. The others are hidden in the saloon and emerge, guns drawn. Cletus goes for his gun and Chris wounds him, and he goes down as the two sides exchange shot. Cletus crawls out the door, and Chris tells the other not to kill Cletus and to cover Chris while he goes after the killer.

Chris runs outside and sees Cletus go to the livery. He goes in after his family's killer and yanks him off the horse he's mounted up on. Chris beats Cletus, who grabs a pitchfork and fights back. they knock over a lantern and start a fire, and Chris disarms Cletus and tells him to get up. After a brief struggle, Chris punches Cletus half-unconscious and then drags him out.

On the street, Chris tells Cletus to tell him who hired him. Cletus gets up and starts to speak, then tells Chris to go to hell and walks back into the burning stable. It collapse around him, as Chris screams in anger and frustration.

Later back in Four Corner at the church, Josiah ponders whether Chris would ride with the Seven again. He walks out past Jock's dime novel about the Seven."

The elderly woman grabs a carbine and goes out to confront Guy.

Guy tells Nettie to hand over the carbine, and Nettie orders him and his men off her property. Unimpressed, Guy tells her that it's best if she stay alive to protect herself and Casey. His man Curly comes up behind Nettie and takes her carbine, and Nettie tells Guy that he's not getting her land like everyone else's.

Going into the ranch house, Guy finds an antique chair and ""suggests"" that Nettie give it to him as a gift. She refuses, saying it's a family heirloom, and Nettie yells to Casey to blow Guy's head off. He kicks in the storage room door and finds Casey inside, aiming the revolver at him. Guy yank the gun away and says that he isn't after her virtue, takes the bullets out, and takes a music box and leaves. Meanwhile, Guy's men tear down the corral fences.

Nettie tries to stop Guy from leaving with the music box, and he says that Casey gave it to him. He shrugs both women off, and Casey throws a rock at his back as he leaves, and tells him to rot in hell. Guy just turns ad glares at her, then mounts up and tells Nettie to be out of the territory the next day. If Nettie tells anyone that he was there, Guy promises to throw Casey to his men. Guy rides off with his men, as Nettie and Casey watch.

Later in Four Corners, Nettie comes in and tells Mary, Chris, and Vin about Guy's raid. She explains that he's a rancher who wants to expand his owning, and has driven out all the other small land owners in the area. Chris checks a map of the area and determines that Guy has been ""buying"" property in a line. He figures that the railroad will come in a line when it comes, and the owners will have to deal with whoever owns the land.

J.D. comes up outside Mary's office and finds Casey waiting for her aunt. She tells J.D. that he can't go own in because they're having a meeting, and he says that he's one of them. Casey looks at him flirtingly and says that she's seen J.D. around riding, but he's not as good as she is. When J.D. questions her, Casey invites him to race and he refuses to race a ""girl"". She asks if he's afraid, and J.D. rolls his eyes.

Chris comes out as Buck arrives, and Chris asks Buck if he'd be interested in partaking in a ""little show of force"" at Guy's ranch. Buck is more than glad to help, and Nettie tells Vin that she and Casey are staying at the town hotel for the time being. He offers his arm and takes her over, and Nettie is much obliged and tells Casey to come along. Vin says that he's impressed by Nettie's courage and she deserves an escort.

J.D. tells Buck that Casey gets on his nerves, and given she dresses like a man, figures she's hardly a girl. Buck, amused, knows better and tells J.D. he's blind.

As they walk, Nettie tells Vin that she's lived in the territory since she was a girl. Vin is impressed by her talking about her shooting skills.

As the Seven ride out to Guy's ranch, Josiah stops when he sees a poster for dancer Emma Dubonnet. Nathan rides over, and Josiah tells him that God has answered his prayers. When Nathan wonders if he's been praying for Emma to come into town, Josiah just smiles and rides on with the others. He tells them that he's not doing anything that will keep him out of town when Emma performs, but refuses to go into details.

The gunmen ride onto Guy's property and Guy comes out to see them, wielding a revolver. Vin tells him to hand Nettie's things over, and Guy claims that the small ranchers give him gifts because they love him. Buck points out that Guy is going to make a profit when the railroad comes through, Vin says Guy's men aren't good enough to face him, and Guy is a coward who threatens women. Guy backs down and tells Curly to return the two horses Nettie ""gave him"".

Guy leads Vin into the house, and Vin gets the chair. When Guy says that he's a ""collector"" of sorts, Vin tells him to stay clear of Nettie if he knows what's good for him, takes the music box, and leaves with it and the chair. Once the gunmen leave, Guy tells Curly that he's riding to Lobo County that night.

As they ride back town, J.D. says that they could have beaten Guy's men easy. Vince isn't sure it's over, and point out that there are two more parcels of land on the railroad corridor, that Guy doesn't own. Buck figures that Guy won't walk away.

In Lobo County that night, Marshal ""Top Hat"" Bob Spikes and his men are burning out a farmer when Curly rides up. Curly tells Spikes that Guy sent him and told him to tell Spikes that he needs him, and will pay triple rates to deal with the Seven. Spikes has heard of the Seven, and says that he will come as soon as he finishes his ""business"". He tells Curly that he will eat the liver of any man who puts a bullet into Chris before he gets to Chris

Mary is walking past the land office, and Guy comes out and says that he just bought the mortgage on Nettie's ranch from the bank. He plans to call the loan, and tells Mary that he'll have the land legal and there's nothing the Seven can do about it.

At the Wells ranch, the Seven is helping Nettie repair the fence. Ezra looks on, relaxing and drinking, and tells Vin that a ""gentleman"" doesn't debate himself with menial labor. Nathan asks Josiah why he bought a suit, and Josiah swears him to secrecy then shows him a photo of Emma. He says that he's carried it net to his heart for half a lifetime, and says that he saw Emma's show in San Francisco years ago. It was true love, and he saw her four times after that. Josiah asked her to marry him, but said there'd be a delay of two years because he pursued a course of spiritual study with a Cherokee holy man. He wonders if that was a mistake, and is happy that now he can win Emma again.

Mary rides up on her carriage, and tells Nettie that Guy bought the mortgage and it's legal. Nettie says that she owes just over $300, and Vin looks over at Ezra and smiles. He tells Nettie that Ezra is saving up to buy a saloon of his own, and he has more than $300 tucked away in his boot. Ezra reluctantly hands it over when Vin insists, Vin saying that he'll pay Ezra back in an hour. The gambler agrees to lend Vin the money at 10% interest, 20% a day if Vin takes more than an hour to pay him back. Ezra gives the money to Vin, who gives it to Nettie,

Guy and his men ride up and Nettie gives him the money, and he wonders how she came up with the $300 and then leaves. Chris is waiting for Guy, and tells him to hand over the $300. The other Seven emerge from hiding, guns drawn, and Chris tells Guy that it isn't a robbery but a ""donation"" to the rancher repair fund. Guy hands the $300 over and advises them to invest some of the money into their coffins, then rides off with his men. Vin gives Ezra the money, and ignores his request for interest.

Later in town, Emma rides into town in her carriage. She invites people to come to the saloon to see the show, and Josiah sees her. He calls to her, and Emma greets him and tells him to come to the show. Emma clearly doesn't recognize him and goes into her hotel.

The next day, a man rides into town and yells that someone is burning the other ranch. Vin, Nathan, and Ezra ride there and find the ranch burned down and the owner, Porter, strung up. They start to cut the body down, and Spikes and his men ride up shooting. He tells them who he is and that they should give a message to Chris that any ""dealings"" with Guy should go through him. Spikes tell Ezra to hand over his coat as a ""gift"" to Guy. When Ezra refuses, Spikes hits him and tells one of his men to get Ezra's coat. Before they go, the one-eyed Spikes tells Vin to tell Chris that the next time the two of them meeting, he's going to rip Chris' eye out.

Later in town at the hotel, Josiah nervously paces outside and Emma sees him through her window. She smiles at Josiah when he sees her, and he braces himself to go in.

J.D. is relaxing in front of the sheriff's office, and Casey comes by wearing overalls and sees J.D. He's playing with his knife, throwing it into the wood, and Casey draws her own pocketknife and competes with him. When he loses, J.D. complains that Casey is distracting him and goes inside. Buck shows up and tells Casey that she's not fooling anyone except maybe J.D. He assures her that she's a fine woman, and suggests that she let J.D. in on her ""talents"". Casey says that she can spit, ride, and rope better than any man. Buck suggests that she wipe off the mud and get herself a dress.

At the saloon, Vin passes on Spikes' message. Chris doesn't remember Spikes. Spikes and his men are outside, and Spikes calls out Chris. When Chris refuses to run, Vin goes out and Buck and Nathan join him. Chris comes out and asks Spikes who he is, and Spikes says that Chris has been scared of running into him again ever since they first me. Chris invites Spikes to draw, and Spikes says that he won't kill Chris without the satisfaction of Chris knowing why he's doing it. He says ""rail-splitting"", calls Chris a SOB, and rides off to deal with his ""other business"". Vin figure that Spikes' business is with Nettie, and the gunmen ride out to the Wells ranch.

When the gunmen arrive, they find Nettie waiting with her carbine. She's expecting Spikes, and Vin suggests that they take Nettie back into town for her own safety.

Spikes and his men ride to Guy's ranch, and Spikes tells Guy that Porter's place is gone and tomorrow they'll burn out Nettie. He says that he isn't leaving with Chris' eye, and Guy tells him that he's welcome to Chris' eye after Spikes takes care of business.

Later in town at the show, J.D. and the others gather at the door to see Emma. J.D. sees Buck bringing Casey along, and Casey in a dress. J.D. and Casey smile at each other, and Buck smirks.

She vaguely says that she missed Josiah, and Josiah says that the thought of her has sustained him for years. Josiah asks if she could think of marrying him again, and Emma tells him that she's taken for the evening... and Josiah couldn't afford her. Guy arrives to pick up Emma, and Emma cheerfully goes with him.

J.D. finds Chris and Buck out on the boardwalk drinking, and joins them as they make lovesick cow noises. Sitting down with them, J.D. tells Buck that he doesn't know anything about women. Chris remembers Spikes from a rail-splitting contest when they were 17. Chris won, and Spike accuses him of cheating and threw a punch. Spikes lost his eye in the brawl, and J.D. points out that Spikes won't ever kill Chris if Chris never tells him that he doesn't remember the reason for Spikes' beef.

Vin suggests that they ride out to Guy's ranch that night, and Chris agrees. They to get the others, and J.D. asks Chris how he knows he can take Spikes. Chris just smiles.

Vin realizes that Chanu is trying to cover his tracks but missed a few, and notes that he's using unshod Indian ponies. Reverend Owen Moseley and his son Rafe are with them, and Rafe is irritated that they haven't caught up to Chanu and Claire yet. Owen tells Rafe not to use such a tone, and when Rafe complains that Vin isn't sure what side he's on, J.D. says that all Vin said was that he wasn't sure Chanu was a renegade.

Rafe tells Buck that Chanu is probably waiting to jump them, and Buck half-jokingly says that Chanu will probably go for Rafe first because he's the loudest. Meanwhile, Vin tells Owen how he knows the tracks are still fresh. and tells Owen to follow him to Claire.

Rafe walks off, and J.D. tells Josiah that Rafe is trouble and J.D. has heard that Owen has had to pull Rafe out of scrapes in various towns. Josiah figures that sounds about right for a missionary's son.

Mary and Nathan tend to Claire, and Owen and Rafe come in and ask Claire if she's okay. Nathan tells them that Claire has just bruised knee, and takes offense when Rafe asks if Nathan touched her.

As the Moseleys go, Mary offers Owen any help she can. He asks her to pray that he finds forgiveness. Owen says that he's devoted his life to bring God to Indians, and questions his faith if Claire being abducted is his reward.

At the saloon, J.D. and Josiah discuss Chanu. Josiah confirms that Chanu is the son of a chief, Ko-Je, and he'll finally get a chance to meet Ko-Je. He plans to go to the reservation and tells Ko-Je that they have his son, and will stay for a few days to make sure they don't get any ideas about breaking Chanu out of jail. Rafe joins them and says that if Owen can't turn them, Josiah can't. Josiah says that he isn't interested in turning them, and Rafe says that he isn't impressed with the Seven's reputation. J.D. tells Rafe that he has a few more days until Rafe grows into his reputation, and Josiah tells Rafe to tend to his family.

Rafe asks Josiah if he's worried that he'll throw down on him. Chris joins them and says that Rafe is the one who should be worried, and Rafe says that he'll be watching them and leaves. J.D. sarcastically says that they're shaking in their boots, and Josiah glares at him.

That night, Josiah rides to the reservation and meets with Ko-Je, and says that he's no longer a missionary. Josiah tells the chief that Chanu is in jail, and is going to stand trial for kidnapping. Ko-Je suggests that they bring Chanu there so he can be punished by tribal law, and Josiah tells him that the townspeople won't agree to that. Ko-Je says that they don't understand, and Josiah says that he knows what it means to have a Bible shoved down one's throat.

Josiah explains that his father was a missionary like Owen, and the two of them finally parted ways when they ""broke"". Ko-Je says that God came between him and Chanu, and God should find better things to do with his time.

J.D. and Nathan play poker in the jail, while Chanu sits in his cell and chants. When J.D. asks Nathan why Chanu is chanting, Nathan suggests that Chanu is praying. Meanwhile, Chanu unwinds a strap from his legging.

Outside, Vin is on guard. Buck and Ezra walk up and Buck tells Vin that they might have a problem. Ezra says that rumors are spreading that Vin and Chanu have a ""relationship"". Vin says that he doesn't know Chanu personally, but figures he had a reason for doing what he did. Buck notes that Claire was frightened when they found her with Chanu, and there's no reason he can think of that would make that right.

After Buck and Ezra leave, Vin goes in and tells J.D. and Nathan to get some food while he watches the place. Once they leave, Vin gives Chanu some food and tells him that he can get a message to Ko-Je if Chanu wants. Chanu doesn't respond, and Vin says that he's heard Chanu was raising hell about the missionaries at the reservation. He asks if that has something to do with Chanu taking Claire, and Chanu just looks at Vin but doesn't answer.

Vin tells Chanu that people think he took Claire to have his way with her, but Vin figures that Chanu would have done that long before they found him if that were so. Chanu says that Claire lies like Owen and there's no reason to talk to her about what happened. Chanu says that Owen tries to destroy his people's spirits, so he stole from the missionaries because they steal from his tribe.

After a moment, Vin tells Chanu that Oren might understand what happened with Chanu, and might keep him from being executed. Chanu asks for Vin's good, then grabs him and strangles him with the strap. Vin manages to grab Chanu's other hand and break his wrist, but Chanu keeps his grip with his other hand and strangles Vin unconscious. Chanu then takes the cell key from Vin, release himself, and escapes.

Later, Nathan returns and wakes up Vin. J.D. and Chris are also there, and Chris posts J.D. outside to make sure no one comes in. Vin insists on going after Chanu, and says that all he needs is 24 hours. Chris offers to ride with him, and agrees to give Vin 24 hours before they form a posse.

Vin and Nathan go to the Moseley home, and Rafe comes out to greet them. He tells them that Owen and Claire were gone when he got home, and three horses are missing. Rafe is armed with a rifle, and says that he found the front door wide open. Vin figures that Chanu got Claire, and Owen went after them. Rafe tells them to stop, and Vin tells him to shoot them if he has to but they're going after Claire.

Rafe demands to know where Claire is, and Vin tells him that he doesn't know but Chanu has escaped. The young man wants to form up a posse, and says that he's going to kill Chanu when he finds him. Vin punches Rafe unconscious and rides off with Nathan.

The next morning, J.D. rides to the reservation and tells Josiah that Chanu escaped, and Chris sent J.D. to back Josiah up if Chanu come there. Ko-Je overhears him and says that his son won't come there. Josiah talks to Ko-Je privately and figures the chief knows where Chanu is because of what Ko-Je said earlier. When Josiah says that Ko-Je has to protect his son, Ko-Je asks if Josiah's son protected him. Josiah says that he did in his own way, but his father is dead and he'd like to keep Chanu from being the same. Ko-Je tells Josiah that his father is on his shoulder, and that's why Josiah is ""unbalanced"". Josiah says that it isn't about his balance but Chanu, and Ko-Je tells him that all things are connected and walks away.

Vin and Nathan track Chanu, and Vin discovers that Chanu changed direction from north where he was heading. He says that he lived with the Indians when he was buffalo-hunting, and a friend in the tribe taught him everything he knew. The Army killed him when they rounded up the tribe for a reservation.

Owen rides up and dismounts, and admits that he's a preacher not a tracker. Nathan advises him to head home, but Owen says that Claire worked at his side trying to save the Indians and he'd go to his grave trying to get her back. He offers to show him where he lost Chanu's trail, and Vin agrees to let him accompany them but tells him to stay back if they found Chanu.

In Four Corners, Ezra and Buck stand guard to make it look like Chanu is still inside. Ezra says that he doesn't see the need for the ruse, and Buck says that they don't need the town riled up because Chanu has escaped. Rafe rides up and Ezra figures that they'd better shut him up before things get out of hand. Rafe angrily asks them why they're not out looking for Claire and Owen, and Buck says that they're in good hands.

Some of the townspeople look on, as Rafe complains that Vin ""almost took his head off"". Ezra looks at Rafe's head wound and, claiming to have some medical knowledge, says Rafe could collapse at any moment. Buck knocks Rafe out from behind, and he and Ezra carry Rafe into the sheriff's station.

Vin and the others find a fresh campfire, and Vin notices a nearby tree hit by lightning. He tells Owen that Chanu's people don't burn wood that has been ""cursed"" by lightning.

At the reservation, J.D. spots smoke coming from a hut. None of the tribespeople react, and J.D. tosses a bucket of water inside... and discovers that several old Indians are in a sauna. Josiah comes in after J.D. asks, them to excuse the boy because of his poor upbringing, and takes J.D. out. Outside, Josiah tells J.D. that the hut is a sweat lodge and J.D. should show more respect. J.D. figures that they should go over Chanu, but Josiah says that there's something Ko-Je wants him to know about Chanu, and is waiting for Josiah to figure it out for himself.

Vin spots Chanu ahead, alone and chanting as he makes a circle of stones. When he spots Vin, Owen, and Nathan approaching, he jumps on his pony and rides off. Vin mounts Chanu's other horse and spots Claire's body lying behind the bushes. Nathan goes to her, confirms she's dead, and tells Owen. Owen kisses his daughter's hand in grief.

As a storm comes up and Owen wraps up Claire's body and prepares to take it back to town, Nathan tells Vin that there were bruises on Claire's neck about the size of a man's hand. Owen asks Nathan to deal with Claire's dealer. When Vin says that they'll track Chanu down, Owen wonders if that's good enough anymore.

Owen returns to Four Corners, and Buck and Ezra see Claire's body. Mary comes out and sees it along with many of the townspeople, Chris notices as well, and Rafe comes out and sees his sister's body as Owen takes the body to the town undertaker. He runs over and Owen stops him as his son breaks into tears, while Chris holds Mary.

That night, Nathan and Vin make camp. Nathan tells Vin that it isn't his fault that Claire is dead, but Vin figures that if he hadn't let Chanu escape, Claire would still be alive. Vin thought that Chanu wasn't so filled with hate, and Nathan tells him that Vin is just a man and sometimes a man can be wrong.

The next morning, Josiah approaches Ko-Je as the latter stands on a hill overlooking the reservation and tells the chief that Claire is dead. Ko-Je knows, and Josiah warns that things could get dangerous for the tribe and he needs Ko-Je's health. Josiah admits that he and his father fought because he felt his father didn't practice what he preached, and Ko-Je says that Chanu feels the same way about him. Josiah hopes that when Chanu gets to be his age, he'll regret it like Josiah does.

Ko-Je tells Josiah that he failed in his belief and didn't honor Chanu's path, and they both have lost balance and must find it again. Josiah suggests that they find Chanu first, and then balance themselves.

Vin and Nathan continue tracking Chanu, and Vin spots the Indian watching them from behind a tree. He gets his rifle and tells Nathan that he has to do it alone, and goes into the brush after Chanu. Chanu runs off, and disappears from one spot and reappears in other several feet away. Vin goes after him and an Indian brave jumps him. The brave and Vin both draw their knives and prepare to fight, and another Indian joins them and prepares to attack Vin.

Facing off against the two braves, Vin says that he no quarrel against them and Chanu is the one he wants. One of the braves, Chanu's brother, says that Chanu will be judged by his own people and Vin warns them that some people won't let that happen. Nathan arrives and throws a knife into the brother's shoulder as he prepares to attack Vin. Vin manages to disarm the other brave and punches him unconscious, and points out that the first Indian is Chanu's brother and next in line to be chief. He figures they must be close to Chanu, has a good idea where he's heading, and figures that he'll need water. Nathan tells Vin to go on ahead while he takes care of the braves' injuries.

At the town cemetery, the townspeople gather for Claire's funeral. Owen says that Claire would have wanted forgiveness, but all he has is rage in his heart. Despite he gave everything he had to the reservation Indians, he believes that they killed Claire. The townspeople echo his sentiments, and Mary tries to calm them down without success. Owen asks whose child is next, and the townspeople head to the reservation.

Chanu stops for water at a creek, and Vin emerges from hiding and trains his carbine on Chanu. Chanu advances on Vin, saying that he's already dead and doesn't care if Vin kills him. He tells Vin to kill him, and gets close enough to grab Vin by the throat. The two men struggle and Vin pins Chanu down, and figures that Chanu took Claire to protect him. Vin realizes that Chanu was making a burial mound with the stones and asks why he did it, and Chanu says that Claire was his wife and loved her.

In the reservation sweat lodge, the elders continue purifying themselves. Josiah and Ko-Je are with them, and Ko-Je tells Josiah that he's not listening when Josiah admits that he isn't coming up with anything. Ko-Je figures that Josiah's father told him that he didn't listen, and says that Josiah's father will speak to him when Josiah's anger at himself is gone. The chief says that the spirits tell him that he should trust Josiah, and tells Josiah that it's about Claire and ""the other"". Josiah wonders who he means, and when Ko-Je remains silent Josiah says that it's best if the chief tells him who else is involved.

In Four Corners, Ezra and Buck prepare to ride off after Chanu to bring him in. When Chris confronts them, Buck tells him that they don't think Vin is right for the job of bringing Chanu in. Mary runs up and says that the mob is heading for the reservation to burn it down.

The townsmen ride to the reservation, and Ko-Je smiles as they come. Josiah points out that there's not much to smile about, and Ko-Je says that things are as they will be and the spirits will send help. Rafe dismounts and asks where Chanu is, and Ko-Je tells him that Chanu isn't there. Josiah and J.D. step forward, guns ready, and tell the mob to leave. Owen is with the posse, and says that Josiah is a heathen.

Rafe says that he's going to find Chanu and lynch him. Ezra and Buck arrive and fire warning shots, and Chris steps out as well. Buck tells the mob to go home, and Owen says that the gunfighters are sinners. Vin and Nathan arrive with Chanu and the wounded braves. Dismounting, Vin announces that Chanu and Claire were married, and they ran off together. Owen is offended, and Chris asks Vin if he has proof.

Vin says that Chanu was away getting water when Claire was killed, and the man who strangled her had strong hands. He points out that he broke Chanu's wrist at the jail and Chanu couldn't have strangled Claire. Rafe wonders who else could have done it, and Vin looks at Owen and points out that Owen followed the trail and the campfire was his. He explains that Owen found Claire alone at the camp and killed her.

Owen says that it's all a lie, then grabs a gun from a horse holster and prepares to shoot Chanu. Chris shoots the gun out of Owen's hand, and Josiah asks him if he accepted the baby that Claire was carrying. Owen says that the baby was a demon from Hell, and Rafe stares at his father in shock as Owen says that Chanu turned Claire against them and God. He tells the crowd that he tried to talk to Claire, and she pushed him away so he went out of control and strangled her.

Rafe flies into a fury at his father, and Josiah holds him back. When Rafe draws a gun, Josiah grabs his hand says that if Rafe kills Owen, he becomes him. Josiah asks Rafe if that's what he wants, and Rafe lowers his gun. The others take Owen to jail,

Later, Chanu gives Vin a pouch on a strap as a gift to his new friend, and they shake. Meanwhile, Josiah tells Ko-Je that he has his balance back, and Ko-Je smiles as the Seven ride back to Four Corners."

The owner asks if Chris is passing through Jericho on business, and he taciturnly says that he is. The local sheriff, Quince, and his deputy come in, and tell the salesman that he's under arrest for suspicion of armed robbery. The salesman, who looks inoffensive, insists that it must be a mistake. Quince tosses a wanted poster on the bar, and says that a bank was robbed in Langdon.

Chris speaks up, saying he was in Langdon for three days and didn't hear anything about a robbery. Quince asks if he's a lawman, and when Chris says that he isn't, the sheriff advises him to keep his mouth shut. The salesman points out that the man shown on the poster looks nothing like him, and the two lawmen grab him. Chris tells them to let the salesman alone, and struggles with the deputy. The salesman runs and Chris stops the deputy from shooting him in the back. The salesman escapes, and Quince knocks out Chris from behind.

Later, Chris is taken before the town judge--Quince--who charges him with abetting a wanted criminal. When Chris objects, the deputy hits him in the gut. Quince says that he can postpone the trial if Chris has $500. When Chris says that he doesn't, the deputy frisk him and confirms he doesn't have any money on him. Chris tells Quince to go to hell and the deputy, acting as Chris' attorney, says that Chris pleads guilty. Quince says that Chris is sentenced to five years' hard labor.

Chris is taken out to the local prison outside of Jericho, via a prison wagon. He jumps a guard and mounts a horse, and the other guards close the gate and soon pull Chris off the horse. The guards drag Chris to the Warden, who tells Chris that he's going into the hole for four days for attempted escape. The Warden tells Chris that he's now only known as ""Inmate 78"", and if he violates any rules then he'll go into the hole.

When Chris says that he wants to get a letter out, the Warden tells him to use the proper appellation. He tells Chris that he has an attitude problem, and asks if he wants to try for eight days in the hole. He asks if they have an understanding, and Chris tells the Warden that men like him are easy to understand. The Warden gives him eight days in the hole and the guards drag Chris off.

In Four Corners, J.D., Buck, and Nathan are playing poker and J.D. is trying to tell a joke. Mary comes in and asks if they've heard anything from Chris. Buck says that they haven't and she wonders if they should be concerned because Chris is seven days overdue. J.D. and Nathan figure that it's concerning, but Buck doesn't. Mary isn't reassured, and leaves.

The guards take Chris out of the hole after eight days, and the Warden asks him they still have a problem. Chris says that they don't, and the Warden has the head guard, Phillips, put Chris to work. Chris is soon working with the other prisoners. One of the prisoners serving food, a cook , sees Chris and finds him looking familiar. He figures that whoever Chris is, the Cook doesn't like him. The Cook spits in Chris' food, and Chris sits down and eats.

Another prisoner sits down next to Chris and figures that Chris is new there. He asks for Chris' food and Chris lets him have it, and the older prisoner quickly leaves as Gage Lawless and his two brothers come over Gage asks Chris if he remembers them, and Chris says that he doesn't. Gage says that Chris shot their cousin Jackie dead in Dodge City, and Chris says that Jackie didn't give him any choice. When Gage says that Chris was better and could have winged him, he tells Chris that he's going to pay and orders him up.

Chris stands up and says that Jackie wasn't trying to wing him. He says that he doesn't want any trouble and then punches Gage in the gut. He takes out one of the other two brothers, and the third one draws a shiv and comes at Chris. He slashes Chris in the side, and Chris disarms him and pins him to the ground, and puts the knife to his throat. Gage backs off, and Phillips comes over and pulls Chris away. Chris tucks the shiv up his sleeve and the guards take him to the infirmary.

The guards shackle Chris to a bed, and Doc Simmons tends to Chris' wound. Simmons drinks while he works, and claims that it's ""medicinal"". He figures that Chris didn't pay the bail and ended up in the prison, and says that Quince and the Warden have a deal worked out. Quince contacts the prisoners' family and asks for the ""bail"", and half the men are waiting to hear from their families while the other half are cutthroats and thieves. Chris points out a dead man shackled to a bed and asks what happened to him. Simmons says that the prison happened to him, and slaps a cloth soaked in alcohol in Chris' wound to ""sterilize"" it.

In Four Corners, Mary gets a telegram from Langdon saying Chris left two weeks ago. She tells the other Seven, who figure they'll check it out and ride off.

At the prison, the Warden shoots at a rock near a working Chris to get his attention, and tells him that he has a visitor. In the Warden's office, Quince is there. He tells Chris that he's there to offer him the possibility of a retrial, and all he needs is for Chris' family to post the $500 bail. Chris finally says that he knows what they're offering, and says that if he gets out then he'll come back and take Quince and the Warden both down.

The six gunmen ride into Jericho and Vin tells the deputy that they're looking for a friend. When the deputy wonders if Chris is the thief they caught recently, Buck takes offense and Vin holds him back. Vin says that it's the wrong man and rides off with the others. Down the street, Vin suggests that it's a dead end. They go to the boarding house and Josiah talks with the owner, Jessie. He flirts with her and says that they're looking for Chris. Jessie says that she doesn't recognize anybody by Chris' description, but says that she doesn't have a good memory.

J.D. is trying his joke on Ezra, who isn't amused. The deputy brings Quince in, and Quince says that he doesn't like all the new guns rolling through his town without an introduction. He wants to know their business, and Jessie says that Vin and the others are looking for Chris Quince doesn't ""remember"" Chris either, and tells the men that if they're planning on staying in Jericho, he's going to have to collect their guns.

Buck snickers, and Vin says that they'll be moving on as soon as they get supplies. The six gunslingers walk out without handing over their guns, and Jessie tells Quince that they could be trouble. Quince tells her that he can handle them.

At the prison, Chris goes through the food line and Chris threatens him with the shiv if the Cook spits in his food again. The Cook reluctantly swallows his tobacco and Chris smiles and walks away.

Later, Chris is digging when the Warden comes through with Inmate 46. He announces that 46 has been hiding in the infirmary, ""slacking off"", and Chris anonymously yells for the Warden to leave 46 alone. Gage and the others watch, as the Warden tells 46 to get up and prepares to beat him with his baton. Chris steps forward and grabs the Warden's wrist, and the Warden tells him to step aside. When Chris doesn't, the Warden hits him with his baton.

Phillips repeats the Warden's order, and Chris gets to his feet. Gage figures that Chris will get himself killed, and the Warden beats Chris down when Chris manages to stand up. The Warden says that he can beat Chris all day and hits him again, and the other prisoners wince in sympathy. Phillips advises Chris to stay down, and Gage bangs his shovel on a wheel. The other prisoners join in on the impromptu protest and encouragement, and Gage tells Chris to get up.

Chris manages to get back to his feet, and the Warden and the guards look around nervously. Chris tells the Warden to leave 46 alone, and the Warden tells the guards to take 46 back to the infirmary while Chris goes there as well to get fixed up. The Warden says that he has plans for him.

Later, Simmons tends to Chris' injuries. The doctor takes a drink and tells Chris that 46 is doing well. Simmons says that 46 was a tough prisoner when he came in, and everyone liked him. Some people thought he was a Texas Ranger who came in looking for the missing, and some thought he was an Indian tracker. He was stubborn like Chris.

In Jericho, the Seven go to the general store and compliment the owner on his selection. Nathan spots Chris' revolver on display, and Buck angrily tells Anderson to show him the gun. When Buck breaks open the case, he takes out the revolver and confirms that it's Chris'. Buck slams Anderson on the counter and asks how he got the gun.

Later, the Seven visit Jessie, and tell her that they found Chris' gun on sale in the local store and he said that Jessie sold it to him. She denies it, and Buck threatens her. Jessie turns to Josiah, the ""preacher"", for help, while Vin and Nathan hold Buck back. Josiah advises Jessie to tell him what really happened, and Jessie tells Josiah that some drunken men forced her to take the gun instead of money, and told her to be quiet about how she got it. Josiah thanks her for her time, and Buck immediately calms down.

Down the street, Buck figures that Jessie is lying and Josiah agrees. However, Josiah figures that Jessie won't tell them anymore.

At the prison, Phillips tells Chris to take it easy. Chris goes to work and the prisoners nod at him in admiration. Gage and his brothers are waiting, and Gage asks how 46 is doing. Chris says that he's doing better, and admits that he should have winged Jackie but he was a different man then. Gage accepts that and lets Chris pass.

Quince comes to see the Warden and tells him that Vin and the others aren't going away. The Warden tells him that he's discovered that Vin is a wanted man, and figures they should give the others a dead Chris.

The Seven go to interview the deputy, searching for Chris, and Ezra points out that they're not particular subtle. He suggests that they let him interview the deputy, and that a little subtlety is in order. The others agree, and Ezra is soon getting drunk with the deputy at the saloon and claims that the Seven are going their separate ways. Ezra says that they're an uncivilized bunch, unlike the deputy. The Deputy says that Chris must not have been a ""special friend"" after all, and Ezra tells him that they were looking to collect a bounty on Chris because of several stagecoach robberies that he committed. The deputy admits that he knows Chris, and Ezra pours him another drink while secretly pouring out his own drink.

At the prison, the Warden tours the grounds. He calls Chris over and accuses him of spitting on his shoes. When Chris denies it, the Warden asks him if Chris is calling him a liar. Phillips warns the Warden that if they put Chris back in the hole, he'll die. The Warden tells Phillips to back off, and Chris insults the Warden. Another guard hits him behind the knees, and the Warden tells Chris that he's going into the hole for eight days. Phillips refuses to take Chris there, and the other guard takes Christ there. Once they're gone, the Warden tells Phillips that he's fired

Ezra gets the deputy drunk and tells him J.D.'s joke. The deputy laughs and then passes out, and Quince and his other deputies come in with Anderson leading them. Quince has a wanted poster of Vin from Texas, and Vin tells Quince that the racket Quince and the Warden are running. The sheriff says that he's a liar and tells Vin's friends to back down.

Nathan tells Quince that they knew all about Vin's ""crime"", and Vin calmly stands up. The deputies run out, realizing that they're outnumbered, and Anderson and the saloon customers leave with them. The Seven draw their guns on Quince, and Quince backs down.

Later, a man brings the Warden a rattlesnake in a bag, per his orders. The Warden tells the man that he doesn't want Chris to see the morning's light,

Later that night, the Warden goes to the hole and looks down on Chris. He drops the rattlesnake out of the bag and into the hole.

Vin drags Quince out and says that they'll go out to the prison. Jessie is waiting for them on the street with a shotgun, and tells them to let ""her boy"" go or she'll shoot. She tells them that Chris is already dead and they might as well leave, and Josiah steps forward and tells Jessie that she doesn't want to pull the trigger. He says that it isn't too late to mend her ways and calmly walks toward her, and says that all Jessie is doing is getting her son killed.

Josiah walks up to the shotgun barrel until it's touching his chest. He says that he has faith that she'll do the right thing, and best for what's best for Quince. Jessie tells him to go to Hell and pulls the trigger, and Josiah reaches forward and blocks the hammer from falling. He yanks the shotgun away, and says that his faith only goes so far.

The Warden tells Chris what happen when a rattlesnake bites him. The snake lunges repeatedly at Chris, and he dodges as best he can. Chris then grabs the snake and thrust it up through the bars, and it bites the Warden in the neck. The Warden collapse and the snake slithers away, and the Seven ride up to the gate with Quince. Quince tells the guards to open the gate, saying that they've got Vin, and the guards oblige. Once they ride in, Quince yells a warning and rides off.

A guard sounds the alarm, and the Seven take out the guards as they go for their guns. The gunslingers take cover, and Quince goes to the telegraph office in the prison. Phillips is already sending a message to Fort Yuma telling them that they have a prison break, and Quince tells him not to bring in the authorities.

Outside, the two sides exchange fire and Josiah takes out the bell-ringer on the tower as he prepares to shoot Josiah.

Phillips tells Quince that the Warden is at the hole, but they don't have time to get him. Quince grabs Phillips' gun, aims it at him, and tells him to stop sending a telegraph and to open the safe where the Warden keeps his money.

Chris grabs the grate keys from the dying Warden, and uses them to free himself.

Buck tells Vin to get Chris, and a stray shot hitting a lantern sets the main cabin on fire. Vin and Nathan go to get Chris.

Quince gets the money while Phillips is forced to hold the bag for the sheriff. Vin breaks in and Quince uses Phillips as a shield and then runs out the door with the bag of money. Nathan sees him come out and tackles him, and Quince yells to a guard to shoot Nathan. The guard wings Nathan, and Quince runs away as Vin comes out and confirms that Nathan isn't badly wounded.

The guards in the burning house surrender.

Quince comes to the hole and finds the Warden. The sheriff shoots into the hole, hoping to kill Chris. Chris emerges from the shadow outside and when Quince comes at him, stabs him with the shiv. Quince dies in the dirt, and goes over to the dying Warden, who asks who Chris is. Chris tells him that he's ""Inmate 78"", and the Warden dies as Chris steps over his body and walks away.

The next day, Josiah goes through the prison records and releases all of the prison who were false accused. Simmons is among them, and Phillips tells Josiah and Chris that none of them knew about the ransoms. Chris tells Phillips that he's in charge now, and it's up to him to change things. Phillips says that Chris can be sure of it and they shake. Chris then mounts up and rides off with the others."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529483/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,Lotta Crabtree is hired by mining tycoon Alpheus Troy to lure one of the Cartwrights into town and hold him for ransom in exchange for Ponderosa timber rights.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Edward Ludwig'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"This pilot episode introduces Ben Cartwright and his three sons, Adam, ""Hoss"", and Little Joe. Ben (Lorne Green), a big man with silver hair, is a widower three times over. He loves the 1000 square miles of his ranch, the Ponderosa. They run cattle, raise horses, and cut timber. They own the largest ranch in Nevada in 1859. His eldest son, Adam (Pernell Roberts), was born to Ben's first wife, the daughter of a New England sea captain. Adam, like his father, has a strong work ethic and an even stronger sense of duty and justice. Hoss (Dan Blocker) is the biggest of the family. He's the son from Ben's second wife, a Swedish woman. Hoss isn't his given name, it's just what everyone calls him. Hoss is a gentle and sensitive man and is more comfortable around animals than people. Little Joe (Michael Landon), Ben's youngest, was born to Ben's third wife, Felicia (though in later episodes she's known as Marie.) His mother was from New Orleans. Joe has an exuberance for life and the fun of living it.

They all live on their ranch near the new silver mining town, Virginia City. Virginia City sprang up practically over night when gold, then silver was found in what became known as the Comstock Lode. Ben has little to do with mining. He respects the land and will do nothing that can't be easily replaced. Which leads to the premise of this episode.

The mine owners need millions of feet of timber to dig deeper and deeper for the ore and Ben won't sell. He has thousands of acres of Ponderosa pine, but believes too much logging will ruin the land. The mine owners hire renowned actress Lotta Crabtree (Yvonne DeCarlo) to lure one of the Cartwright boys into town where he can be held hostage until Ben agrees to sell them lumber.

The Cartwrights spot a carriage barreling across the Ponderosa and follow after it to investigate. The carriage has lost a wheel and come to a halt. The boys pull guns on the driver and demand to know what he's doing on their land. A beautiful woman, Lotta Crabtree, steps out of the carriage and refuses to cower. She orders them to put their guns away. Hoss and Joe do, but Adam keeps his out. When she points that out to him, he merely says, ""I might still intend to use it."" Ben tells him to put it up thinking maybe the coach did accidently stray onto the Ponderosa. They offer to help fix the wheel and Ben tells Joe to take Lotta back to the house for a cool drink. Joe, who's been admiring the lady's beauty, is happy to oblige. However, Adam jumps down first and is the one to lift the woman onto Joe's horse.

Once the wagon is fixed, the Cartwrights wonder what's taking Joe and Lotta so long. Their Chinese cook, Hop Sing (Victor Sen Yung) rides up in the buckboard and is upset that everyone missed lunch. Hoss is more upset than Hop Sing as meals are something he doesn't like to miss. But when Hop Sing says Joe took the lovely lady back to Virginia City, everyone knows there's going to be trouble. Adam pulls his gun and holds it on the driver. He threatens the driver, Ned, with one minute to tell what he knows. Ned says he was hired to drive the lady around these hills. Ben demands to know if it was Alpheus Troy who hired him. Ned admits it was. Ben says they'll gather there forces and if the three of them aren't back by dawn, their men are to ride in behind them.

Joe escorts Lotta into town and asks if he can see her after her performance. She doesn't disagree.

Joe takes his horse over to the Chinese section of town and meets Hop Sing's father, Hop Ling (Sammee Tong) who runs a laundry. He takes a rose from Hop Ling's bush and heads back to town.

Joe attends Lotta's performance (Yvonne DeCarlo - performing - ""All other awnsers were no"") and tosses the rose to her when she's done. Then he visits her in her hotel room. He tries to make a few moves on her, but she manages to politely sidestep them. Joe gets the message and they just talk. She's been to New Orleans, which is where Joe's mother was born, and he loves to hear about it. Lotta looks out the window and sees two men she recognizes and realizes they're coming for Joe. She locks the door and begs to know why Ben won't sell his trees. Joe's now very suspicious and says, ""Without those trees we can't keep the land going. Are you expecting any visitors ma'am?"" She looks guiltily away.

The Cartwrights ride to town and demand the return of Little Joe, but Alpheus Troy (George Macready) refuses to say where Joe is. He tells Ben to take it up with his associate. The associate is a gunfighter named Langford Poole (Christopher Dark). Adam insists that Poole fight him and not Ben. They square off and Poole draws. Adam is faster and wounds Poole in the arm. Still Troy won't say where Joe is. Adam suspects Lotta is involved and marches over to her hotel.

The two men push their way into Lotta's hotel room. Joe, sitting casually in a chair, merely tells them that their appearance wasn't entirely unexpected. After a brief fight, Joe escapes out the window and takes refuge in Hop Ling's laundry. The two men have followed and proceed to tear China town apart looking for him. This upsets the residents and they attack the men. Joe comes out of the laundry and joins the fight with an enthusiastic ""Yahoo!""

Meanwhile, Adam has arrived at Lotta's hotel room and accuses her of working with Alpheus. She claims it was all a game and she didn't know they meant to hurt Little Joe. Adam's angry and grabs her wrist and twists. She says he's hurting her. Adam doesn't back down, ""I'll break it, now where's the kid?"" She says sincerely that Adam doesn't understand. He pushes her away in frustration. She sadly says that Adam doesn't think much of her. He's still mad and says sarcastically that she did her job very well luring a young kid to his death. She again insists she didn't know they'd hurt him and she thought of it as a game. He doesn't believe her. ""Next time, Miss Crabtree, pick on a man, not a boy,"" he says angrily and storms out.

Adam returns to the saloon and reports that he didn't find Joe, but his horse is still in the livery. Poole is still there with Troy, so the Cartwrights leave to continue the search, but don't turn their backs on the men.

At sun up they are riding down the main street when they hear music coming from a restaurant. They dismount and go in to find Joe dancing with Lotta as a man plays the harmonica. After his sigh of relief at finding Joe alive and well, Ben yells at Joe, ""Is this what you've been doing all night?!"" Joe says he was just getting started. Ben orders him out. Joe scampers away trying to avoid getting a swat from Ben as he squeezes by. Ben and Hoss notice that Adam hasn't taken his eyes of Lotta. As Hoss turns to follow Joe out he gives Adam a nudge towards her. With Ben, Hoss and Joe outside, Adam steps up to Lotta and gives her a kiss. With a smile he turns and leaves."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529536/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,The Cartwrights go up against two San Francisco men who plan to get rich by killing off the antelope herds--which the Indians rely on for their food--and selling the meat to Virginia City's swarms of silver miners.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Paul Landres'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Burdette and Thorne are selling native antelope meat to the ""diggers of Sun Mountain"" (the miners) at outrageous prices. The lack of their native food causes the Paiutes to steal Ponderosa beef. The Cartwrights decide to sell their beef directly to the miners, hoping to ease the tensions with the Paiutes and keep their herd from being rustled. This interferes with Burdette's business plan and he tells Thorne to stop the beef from arriving in Virginia City. Thorne and his men accomplish this by dressing up as Indians and killing all but one miner. Harris is left alive to tell everyone it was the Paiutes that ambushed them. Thorne then dresses a miner and kills Tukwa, one of the Cartwright ranch hands. An Indian war is imminent unless the Cartwrights can get to the bottom of this. They go to speak to Harris only to discover that he is too dazed to identify anyone and the only other person who knows Burdette is guilty, a saloon girl named Glory, has been kidnapped. They track Burdette and Thorne and their captive to the desert where a gunfight breaks out. Burdette, who never approved of the killing, refuses to return fire. As he and Glory try to escape from Thorne, Thorne shoots him in the back. Then Thorne uses Glory as a shield. Hoss tackles Thorne and fights him. Burdette, who isn't dead, gets an opportunity to shoot Thorne, killing him. Burdette then dies in Glory's arms. Adam laments that Burdette came looking for a bonanza and now he's dead. Glory says Burdette found it right before he died and that's better than not finding it at all."

One of the members of the party is McCall, a man they ran off their property earlier. The other members include McCall's fiance, Emily, and her brother (also his business partner) John Pennington. Ben is familiar with Pennington's work. They use hydraulic mining and it destroys the land by uprooting trees and removing top soil. Emily is sick and John says they're just trying to get her to the high country for her health. Ben is adamant that they leave. The next day, to ensure that the party goes, Ben has Hoss escort them off. As they make their way, McCall and one of his men, Krug, make plans to take Hoss. They've noticed his concern for the livestock and pretend to have a horse come up lame. When Hoss checks the animal, they knock him out. John and Emily are against this and they too find themselves captives of McCall. McCall kills the Cartwrights' foreman for guns and ammunition and dumps the body at the Ponderosa's front door. While they're gone, Hoss breaks free and, at John's urging to be left behind, Hoss escapes with Emily. The Cartwrights are now tracking McCall and his men who have also enlisted the help of local miners. Hoss and Emily have made their way some distance and see that Ben, Adam and Joe are about to walk into an ambush. He draws McCall's attention to himself and takes on the gang singlehandedly. He's doing well when the Cartwrights arrive and shoo everyone else off. Hoss is explaining things when he realizes Emily is very sick. They rush her back to the Ponderosa. She's dying and knows it. She asks her brother to take her back to San Francisco. She doesn't want to be a bother to anyone and she doesn't want Hoss to know how sick she is. Hoss makes arrangements for her to go with a wagontrain and tells her he'd like her to stay. He describes his favorite glade and says he'd like to take her there. She tells him to go there in the spring and she'll be there. She tells him she loves him, caresses his cheek, and leaves. Hoss can't believe it, he's getting married! He's so excited that he can't understand why no one else is excited too. Now that Emily's gone, they break the news to him. Hoss runs out of the house. Joe tries to follow to console his brother, but Ben stops him. Having lost three of his own wives, he tells Joe, "" For a while it's a hurt you have to bear alone."" Hoss spends his time alone by the water begging God to help him. Eventually, he returns to the Ponderosa. He still can't talk about it or explain things, but Ben understands and encourages him to go on by simply going back to work."

Mike Wilson and his brother Vern take two Bannock women captive. One of the women's husbands, Numta, finds Adam and tells him what happened. He and Adam are able to free the women and take them back to the Ponderosa. However, the other husband has gone to the Bannocks to enlist their help. In retaliation, the Bannock kill Vern and several unrelated settlers along the way. Mike escapes and hurries to Virginia City. He embellishes the story, blames the Paiute, but leaves out his involvement in the kidnapping. Virginia City residents are ready to fight back. Ben, having heard all this, can't believe it and tries to get a town leader, Bill Stewart, to talk sense into these men. Bill is less concerned, but agrees to talk to the men in the morning. Ben returns home to learn the true story from Adam. The next day, former Army Major Ormsby has rallied his ""troops"". Significantly fewer residents are willing to fight in the light of day and sober. Bill and Ben convince them to parley with Paiutes. The Paiutes know they're coming and Winnemucca's son, Young Wolf, wants to fight. But Winnemucca knows that if Ben is there it is to talk. However, when they meet up, Mike wants to fight and he shoots at the Paiutes. In the scuffle, Adam is captured and Ben knocked out. Only a handful of men return to Virginia City and Ben believes Adam is dead. Back in the Paiute camp, Young Wolf would like to kill his old friend, Adam, but Winnemucca prevents it. In Virginia City, Ben is relieved to learn that Adam is still alive, but Mike claims Adam went willingly with the Paiutes. Winnemucca meets with Ben and tells him that if the white man returns with the Army, then many, including Adam, will die. Adam, who's present, tells Ben to ride to the Bannock and convince Ring Nose to tell the truth. Ben and Joe ride hard, but Virginia City has already sent Mike to request assistance from the Army and they're marching quickly to the Paiutes. Ben and Joe reach Ring Nose and he is an honorable man. He knows he may die for killing the whites, but he can't allow the Paiute to suffer for his actions. They ride hard to reach the marching army before the army reaches the Paiutes. Unfortunately, they don't get there in time. Young Wolf has Adam off to the side with orders to kill him first. But Adam has freed his tied hands and escapes. Young Wolf is right behind him when Mike shoots him. The battle begins. Adam takes Young Wolf's knife and turns to find Mike taking aim on him. He throws the knife and kills Mike. Ben and Joe arrive and after checking on Adam intend to go stop the army. But the battle is already over. Men on both sides lie dead. The truth comes out and they all know the loss was all for nothing. Winnemucca sits mourning his son and all his Paiute sons. The army marches silently past, dipping their flag in respect."

The Cartwrights are not amused. Meanwhile, Virginia City is having an election and Judge Billington is running for re-election. He's campaigning hard, even though he never loses. The Cartwrights have also discovered men surveying on their property. When they discover the surveyor works for the railroad and that Billington has been seen with the railroad supervisor, they realize that a land grab is about to be made and approved by a crooked judge. Sam has also decided that he wants to write meaningful articles and conspires with the Cartwrights to bring down the judge. His hilarious articles make Billington a laughingstock. Despite being attacked, he continues to write. The Cartwrights come into town to defend Sam just as he's under gunfire. A gunfight ensues even as Sam writes his next article. But suddenly it occurs to him that his pen name isn't right. As the bullets fly around him, and the Cartwrights encourage him to write, Sam decides to call himself Mark Twain.

He has two claims and one of them paid off. His fiance, Annie O'Toole, grabs up one of the deeds since she staked Swede. She says she, Swede, and her father, Kevin ""Himself"" O'Toole are all going to Nevada. ""Himself"" doesn't want to. The heathen air will kill him, he claims. And sure enough it does. When the Cartwrights meet Annie, her father is lying dead in the back of her wagon along side her stove. Hoss helps her bury her father on Swede's claim and she pays him with a meal. The scent of real home cooking brings every miner in the area. Adam doesn't think it's safe for a woman alone on the Washoe and proposes that she feed these men at a $1/plate to earn the money to return to San Francisco. She agrees on the condition that he be her partner. So they open up a restaurant. But even though Annie earns lots of money (by raising prices for meals) she refuses to go home. Then Gregory Spain arrives saying she's on the site he bought from Swede, claim #2. Annie refuses to give up her rights to this claim. After all, ""Himself"" is buried here. Spain refuses to take claim #1 because it isn't the one that has the strike. After some fighting, they go to miner's court with Ben as the judge. Spain says he has the deed to claim #2 and since Annie never made the required improvements, she defaults on the claim. Adam is able to prove that Annie did make the improvements. Hoss dug an exploration hole six feet deep, six feet long, and three feet wide. Just because he put a body in it and filled it back up doesn't change the fact that it was an exploration hole. Annie wins. Eventually Spain offers her $25,000 for the claim. He knows he'll find far more in silver on it than that. She sells and moves ""Himself"" over to claim #1.

Comstock, the Cartwrights remember when they first met the silver-tongued claim-jumper and his scheme that laid the foundation of Virginia City.",[],TV-G,Release date,['John Brahm'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"As the Cartwrights return from moving the herd, they pause to cool off by the lake when suddenly a shot rings out. An old prospector accuses the Cartwrights of being on his land. He bought and paid for it and even has the deed. Although Ben tries to explain that the land is his, when he sees the deed he laughs and shows the boys. The land was sold to the prospector by Henry T.P. Comstock. The prospector doesn't know what's so funny, so the Cartwrights proceed to tell him the story of when they first met Mr. Henry Comstock.

Henry Comstock (Jack Carson) sits atop his mule about to be hanged by four men. He's been accused of claim jumping and they intend to put an end to that. Henry begs a moment to pray and proceeds to ask God why these men haven't heard the new goings on. The leader, Heck (Jack Mather) wants to know what Henry's talking about and Henry explains that Hang Town changed its name to Placerville and outlawed hangings in the city limits. He also claims that the city limits go clear to the top of the Sierras. The men decide they'll make the long trip and escort Henry out of town and hang him on the other side.

The Cartwrights are just returning from having cut down a Ponderosa Pine (and planted a new one in its place) when they see a man on a mule being chased by four men on horseback. They don't know what's going on, but they don't like the odds and decide to help the lone man out. They take cover lower on the mountain and using Hoss' buffalo gun take turns shooting at the four men. Each of the Cartwrights hit their mark (which isn't the four men, but their canteen, hat, rifle and an arm.) The four men can't see who's shooting at them and take off. Henry doesn't know where the help is coming from, but he's happy to have it.

The Cartwrights meet up with Henry and they ask why he was run out of California. Henry denies that he, Henry T.P. Comstock, was ever claim jumping, may God strike him dead if he did. Joe has his rifle casually resting on his shoulder and pulls the trigger for an explosive boom. Henry tells God he didn't mean right now. The Cartwrights all laugh and invite Henry back to the Ponderosa for dinner.

At dinner, Henry tells some wild stories, but he does say he knows Ben's old friend, John Sutter. Ben would like to hear news of him and Henry keeps avoiding answering. Finally, Ben calls an end to dinner and insists on hearing about Sutter. Henry admits Sutter isn't the man he once was. This only confirms what Ben already heard.

The boys have plans for the evening. Adam's going to the saw mill and asks if Henry would like a job. That's not the kind of work Henry does, so he declines. He claims he's a merchant, buying or selling as the situation requires. Ben just wants to make sure Henry isn't interested in panning for gold, not on his Ponderosa. He saw what gold did to John Sutter's land and he won't have it on his. Henry's intrigued to hear that they've found gold at the Washoe Diggings and thinks he might go down there. Hoss thinks he better tag along to make sure Henry doesn't get into any trouble. Joe wants to go to Dutchman Pete's for the weekly dance. Ben's surprised they even have women to dance with down at the diggings. Joe says they're laundry women and Hoss adds that they're all big boned, but they can dance. Joe says he wishes he could find a pretty woman to take to the dance. Suddenly he has an idea and he and Hoss leave. Hoss to follow Henry, Joe to find a pretty woman. Adam heads off to work.

Joe's idea of a pretty woman is Chief Winnemucca's young daughter, Saratuchi (Joanne Sages). He's brought some pretty turquoise material and, after talking with the chief (Bruce Gordon), offers it to Sara and asks her to the dance. ""But don't tell Chiefy.""

Hoss follows Henry to the miners who are placer mining, running water through the soil looking for gold. They find bits here and there, but mostly the equipment just gets mucked up with ""this darn blue stuff!"" Henry sees an opportunity. He asks two miners if they've filed a claim, because otherwise they're tresspassing on his land. Despite Hoss' whispering that Henry can't do that, Henry proceeds and a fight breaks out. Hoss gets pulled into it and Henry just saunters away to find another miner. He offers the man $17 for half his claim. The man, Pike (Charles Wagenheim) jumps at the chance because all he's finding is blue stuff. Now that they're partners, Henry whispers his plans into Pike's ear.

At the dance, Hoss is having a good time dancing with one of the women when Joe arrives with Sara in her new turquoise dress. He introduces her to the men who are all impressed with the pretty young girl. However, one man, Ol Virginny (Richard H. Cutting) thinks it was unwise to take Sara from her father and the Paiutes. Hoss agrees. But Joe doesn't care and escorts Sara out to dance. Several men offer Joe a deal to be allowed to dance with the slender young woman, but Joe always declines. Then he leads her to a corner and proceeds to kiss her. That's when Winnemucca and his braves arrive.

Joe's trying to talk himself out of a bad situation, facing an Indian chief and father's wrath, as well as an angry fiance. Sara was promised to Lean Knife (Abel Fernandez). Henry intervenes and insists on kissing the bride, even though Hoss tries to stop him. Lean Knife pulls his knife to cut Henry and Joe shoves Lean Knife to stop him. Lean Knife is about to turn on Joe when Ben and Adam arrive. Adam shoots the knife out of the Indian's hand. Ben assures Winnemucca that his son is young and foolish and he will be punished, but by him not the Paiutes. The Indians leave and everyone returns to dancing.

Suddenly, amongst the hoopla, Pike runs in yelling he struck gold. Everyone's excited, Henry looks smug, and the Cartwrights have retreated to a corner looking worried. Pike's going to show everyone where he found it, but Henry reminds him that it was on his claim. However, he's willing to sell shares for $100, cash on the barrel head, and he'll let them in on the Comstock Lode. Everyone starts throwing money at him as Pike is desperately trying to say he really did find gold. This isn't part of their plan. When Henry realizes he's practically giving away a real gold strike, he tries to give the money back. But everyone would rather keep their share and they all push out of Dutchman Pete's simultaneously. In the crush, Ol Virginny falls and breaks his whiskey bottle. He decides to use it as a christening and dubs the place Virginia. Henry says that's not right, it needs to be called Virginia City. The crowd cheers and head off for the diggings. The Cartwrights remain behind discouraged.

The Cartwrights conclude their story to the old prospector by telling him that Henry sold his claim for $11,000. He didn't know that all that blue stuff was silver and since then they've pulled out millions of dollars of silver from the Comstock Lode. The prospector says he doesn't feel so stupid then for buying the worthless deed. Ben thinks that the deed would be a nice memento of their old friend Henry Comstock and offers to buy it from the prospector for the $25 he paid for the land."

Intrigued by the picture of a naked woman riding horseback, Hoss and Joe are eager to see the show. They sneak out of the house and hurry to the performance only to be pulled out of line by their older brother. Fearing they're about to be reprimanded, Adam scolds them for being late and hopes the best seats aren't gone. During the show, Hoss is confused. The leading lady doesn't look anything like the woman on the poster. Joe says the woman on the poster is playing the part of a man, which just confuses Hoss more. After the show the boys go to the saloon and Hoss is dying to know if she really was naked when she rode out on the horse. After some gentle teasing, Adam assures him that she wore tights. Just then, Ben enters. The boys slump down in their seats hoping he won't notice them. Fortunately, he only has eyes for Adah. She suddenly sees someone she recognizes and begs Ben to take her back to the hotel. It was her ex-husband, once famous boxer, John Regan. They broke up because he abused her. He's followed her before looking for money. Ben hates how Regan treated her. Ben and Adah are old friends and Ben hopes it will be more. He spends all his time with Adah. The boys don't like that he's associating with an actress, but he assures them he can take care of himself. In an effort to prove to Ben what kind of a woman she is both Adam and Joe go to meet her. Neither is successful and both are, more or less, put in their place. Ben even proposes to Adah, he wants so much to protect her. But Regan has a pull on Adah and she can't deny him. Regan is jealous of Ben and takes the opportunity to get revenge by beating Joe up and nearly blinding him. Ben, Adam, and Hoss go to face Regan in the saloon. He refuses to fight with a gun but is willing to take Ben on with his fists. Hoss insists he fight Regan. Ben won't allow him, but Adam holds Ben back and Hoss takes on Regan. Since Regan is a professional boxer, he's beating Hoss. But Hoss won't quit. Finally, at Adam's urging, Hoss turns to wrestling rather than boxing and eventually defeats Regan. He's left lying on the floor when Adah appears. She rushes to him and promises him everything will be alright. The Cartwrights leave and Adam can't understand why a woman like Adah would be with a man like Regan. Ben's only explanation is that there are many kinds of love, as many as their are women."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529848/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,"Caught in the middle of a longtime family feud over a disputed piece of land, star-crossed lovers Joe Cartwright and Amy Bishop try to convince their stubborn fathers to resolve their differences as tension escalates into violence.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Several men cut down a tree on a piece of land known as the Truckee Strip. One of the Cartwright ranchhands, Trump (Charles Horvath), sees the work and hurries back to tell Ben. Two men approach the fallen tree. Jason Carter (S. John Launer) wonders why only one tree. Jessup (James Coburn) assures him that one is enough. Ben Cartwright and Luther Bishop will cause more thunder over this one tree than Carter's ever heard on that mountain.

Sure enough, after Trump tells the Cartwrights what happened, they're in hot pursuit of the lumbermen. Joe loses his man, but comes across a small pond with someone hiding behind a bush. He orders the person out and a young woman with big brown eyes steps out. She's only half dressed and holds her dress in front of her. Joe's surprised with what he's found, but merely dismounts and tells her she's tresspassing. She knows he must be a Cartwright and informs him that the land belongs to her father, Luther Bishop. She's Amy Bishop (Adrienne Hayes). Joe turns around so she can get dressed, but then she accidently steps on a frog and screams. Joe's immediately at her side. One look into her eyes and Joe is lost. He apologizes if he scared her when he rode up and asks if she visits the pond often. She says she does nearly every day at this time.

That evening at the Ponderosa, Ben tells Trump to post men on the Truckee Strip and let him know if anyone steps on his land. But he doesn't understand why Luther would do this. The court awarded the land to Ben and he thought Luther would follow the law. But if Luther wants to make an issue out of this again, Ben will be ready. Joe finally speaks up. ""For one tree? You're going to start fighting all over again for one tree?"" Ben says it isn't just the tree, it's the principle. Ben sends Trump to get the guards and Joe asks if it was worth it. Trump lost an eye in the last fight, was it worth it?

On the Concho, Luther Bishop's place, Luther's foreman Jessup poses the same question. Is Bishop going to fight over one tree. Luther Bishop (Carl Benton Reid) insists, despite the court order, that the land is his. Jessup agrees Luther has as much right to those trees as Ben and Luther could use the timber money. He thinks Luther ought to take Carter up on his offer to buy the timber. Luther says there are other ways to get money than do business with a man like Carter. Luther suspects Jessup is still angry over having lost a brother in the last fight. Jessup is.

Luther checks on Amy before she goes to bed and she too asks about the land. He swears the land is his and he'll fight for it til the day he dies. Not just for the land, but for the principle. He changes the subject and says Jessup told him that Amy was out to the creek. She says she doesn't like Jessup following her. Luther assures her it's only because he asked Jessup to keep an eye on her. What they don't know is that Jessup is outside her window watching her even now.

Joe meets Amy out at the pond again. She's glad to see him, but says her father wouldn't like it. Joe takes her hand, looks into her eyes, and says, ""We don't have to inherit the hates of our families."" She doesn't think they can escape it, but Joe says they can if they try. For the first time in his life he questioned his father and he did it because he met a girl with bare feet and big eyes.

Carter is upset with Jessup because the one tree did not get Luther to sell him the timber he needs. Jessup says he'll need to make a bigger play.

That night Jessup and two men steal three horses from the Ponderosa. They wear masks and ride the Ponderosa horses on to the Concho and kill one man, leaving a second (John Frederick) alive. Frederick sees the Ponderosa brand on the horses' flank.

Frederick tells Luther what happened. Jessup is ready to ride after the men, but Luther says they'll be long gone. He tells Jessup to inform Carter that he'll sell him that timber off the Truckee Strip. Jessup grins as Luther says, ""I hope Ben Cartwright just tries to stop me.""

As Hoss and Ben wonder how three of their horses got out last night, Trump rides up and says there's a whole lumber camp up on the strip. The Cartwrights are ready to ride, but Joe's not around. Hoss says Joe's out looking for strays. Ben thinks he's been out looking for strays a lot lately.

Joe's at the pond with Amy as she reads him Shakespeare. To his credit, he's actually listening. He says he could compare her eyes to the stars or her mouth to a rose, but when he looks at her he can't think of anything to say. They kiss. Joe says they need to tell their fathers, but Amy insists that it can never be, a Cartwright and a Bishop. Joe asks, if their fathers won't let them be together, will she go away with him and marry him. They kiss again and Jessup rides by and sees them.

Ben, Adam, Hoss, and Trump ride into the lumbercamp. As Ben demands to know where Luther is, no one sees Trump sneak into a tent after a young Chinese man who held a knife. He's the cook for the camp. They don't realize anything is amiss until they hear a scream. Ben rushes into the tent to find Trump strangling the young man. Trump drops the boy and goes outside where Hoss keeps him. The young cook is dead and Ben orders that Trump be taken in to the sheriff. Trump won't go and attacks Ben. Hoss pulls him off and they fight. Joe rides up in time to see Hoss win.

The cook's body is brought out and Joe takes it. Adam tries to explain that it wasn't Ben's fault, but only Joe seems truly upset about the death. He wants to know what Ben's going to do about it. Ben says they're taking Trump in to the sheriff. Joe can't believe they don't understand. ""All you care about is that there's been a killing and somebody's got to pay for that killing."" He wants to take the boy back to the Concho. He puts the body across his horse and Ben says Joe can't go. Joe's going anyway. Ben steps forward to stop him and Joe pulls his gun on Ben. ""Just put your gun down, Joe,"" Ben says quietly and asks why Joe needs to do this. Joe realizes what he's done and lowers his gun. He says the killing seems to rub off on people, he pulled a gun on his own father. But he still has to take the body back. Ben lets him go. Adam's worried that Joe will be shot the minute he sets foot on the Concho, but Ben says Joe needs to be trusted. He's got something he needs to figure out on his own.

Joe brings the young man back and is met by Jessup who shoots at him. Luther makes Jessup stop and Joe dismounts. He admits that a Cartwright man killed the cook, but it wasn't Ben's doing. Luther says Ponderosa men killed a Concho man last night. Joe says it couldn't be, Ben's always fought out in the open. Luther helps the boy's father carry the body away. When he's gone, Jessup reminds Joe that his brother was killed on the strip. Joe reminds him that it was a fair fight. Jessup warns Joe to stay away from Amy. Joe returns the threat saying if Jessup goes near Amy, Jessup will have his chance against Joe. Jessup goes for his gun, but Joe is faster. Amy rushes out and stands in front of Joe. Luther returns and sends Jessup away and Amy back in the house. He warns Joe to stay away from Amy. Joe mounts up, but says it'll be harder than that to keep them apart.

Joe is very late getting home and Ben is worried. But when Joe finally comes home, he can't say what he wants to say. He asks if the land means so much to Ben. Ben says it means a lot, but it's not his whole life. He asks Joe what's wrong and Joe finally says he meet a girl named Amy Bishop. Now Ben understands what's been bothering Joe. He promises Joe that he'd never hold his land above his sons. Joe says he wishes Luther felt that way. He also mentions the Concho man killed by a Ponderosa man. Ben says they have a lot to talk to Luther about.

The next day Ben and Joe ride into the lumber camp. Jessup sees them and sneaks away. Ben says the men who killed the Concho man were riding stolen Ponderosa horses. Luther accuses him of lying. Ben, like Joe said earlier, always fights in the open. Luther also questions Joe and Amy's relationship. Ben said he let his boy decide, why doesn't Luther let Amy decide. Luther's confident Amy will choose him and tells Joe he can go get her and bring her back.

Jessup walks into the house and tells Amy that the feud has started again and that Luther won't let Amy and Joe be together. Amy thinks her father will once he gets to know Joe. Jessup says Joe won't get the chance. He's waited a long time for Amy to grow up and he's not letting some Cartwright come in and take her. She doesn't want anything to do with him and he tries to trap her. She escapes and runs to the barn. He's right behind her.

Joe arrives and when he hears a scream from the barn, he rushes in. He finds Jessup molesting Amy. Jessup is unarmed, so Joe takes off his gun and they fight. They use fists, chains, whips, whatever they can find. Jessup grabs a pitchfork and throws it at Joe. He ducks away. Jessup gets Joe's gun and starts shooting at Joe who's hiding in a stable. When Jessup comes around the corner to shoot him, Joe stabs him in the chest with a pole. Jessup dies. Joe goes to check on Amy only to discover she was stabbed in the chest by the pitchfork.

The doctor comes out of Amy's room and sadly reports that he did everything he could. He says Amy wants to see Joe. This saddens Luther, but Joe hurries in and kneels at her side. She tells him the doctor told her she'd be fine. He says Ben gave them the piece of land with the pond so she can wade whenever she wants. She starts to talk about the house they'll have, but stops midsentence. Joe is heartbroken and drops his face to the bed in tears.

When Joe leaves the room he doesn't look at anyone, but merely says, ""She said it could never be, a Cartwright and a Bishop."" Then he walks out followed by his family."

The longer they take to catch them, the more whipped into a lynching party they become, much to the liking of the grieving widower.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Three men, Blackie, Kirk, and Schuster, ride up to a cabin. Blackie asks for supplies. The woman is hesitant, but says she'll get some. While Kirk and Schuster water the horses, Blackie attacks and kills the woman. He runs. Schuster and Kirk had nothing to do with it, but don't want to be caught either, so they all run.

When Flint Johnson and his son, Billy, bring Mrs. Johnson's body to town, Flint says a prospector saw three men riding away. He wants to go after the men. The sheriff's away and the deputy, Jeb, asks Adam and Joe to join them on the posse. They're reluctant, but Jeb begs and Adam agrees. ""Paiute"" Scroggs will be their tracker. Adam isn't convinced the three men had anything to do with the killing and is going along to make sure Flint doesn't do something he'll regret.

""Paiute"" Scroggs tracks the men and realizes they're headed for dry country. He thinks they should stop at McSween's Tavern before continuing, they can load up there. Flint doesn't want to lose time, but Scroggs assures him that the men will tire and the posse will catch them. Flint asks Adam for his opinion. Adam says the posse will be hard enough to control and even worse if they get liquored up at the tavern. Flint decides to go to the tavern.

Most of the men are enjoying themselves at McSween's, but Billy doesn't like it and Adam and Joe don't even go in.

The next morning, Adam insists Jeb take control of the posse instead of letting Scroggs and Flint run it. Jeb doesn't know what to do and says Scroggs has lots of experience with posses. Adam says Scroggs has lots of experience with lynching parties. Jeb meekly shrugs and tells Jeb. Jeb challenges Adam and Joe. Joe says they're making sure the posse stays legal. Scroggs threatens Adam, but he and Joe are faster to draw and Scroggs backs down. But now the lines are drawn.

The three men have reached the desert and Kirk doesn't know why he's running. He didn't do anything. Blackie and Schuster say the posse won't wait long enough to hear it. But Kirk decides he's going back.

That night, as the posse makes camp, Scroggs begins telling the men that even if they catch the murderers, they might not hang. He's seen it happen before and sends a meaningful look over at Adam and Joe. He's starting to work them up to a lynch mob. As everyone sleeps, Joe asks Adam what they'll do if they the posse wants to hang the men when they're caught. Adam says they'll fight them if they have to. Joe doesn't like the idea of fighting friends. Adam reminds him that they don't know the men are the ones who killed Mrs. Johnson.

The next day, the posse's lost the trail, so they split up. Flint and Billy see a man riding toward them. The man, Kirk, says he's giving himself up. Billy tells him to drop his gun. As Kirk reaches for his gun to do that, Flint shoots him dead. He tells Billy that he's claiming self-defense and Billy will have to back him.

As Adam and Joe bury Kirk, Flint is anxious to keep going. Adam accuses him of killing Kirk intentionally. They separate from the posse. As the posse continues to track the remaining two men, Adam asks Joe if there's a short cut to the next watering spot. Joe says it's a rough ride, but there is. They take it.

Blackie and Schuster arrive at the watering hole, but as they move to the water, a shot rings out. Adam and Joe beat them there. Blackie and Schuster hide in a cabin, but there's a small shoot out as Adam and Joe move in. Blackie is wounded. When Adam and Joe come into the cabin, Schuster claims he didn't want to shoot the woman and he begs to be allowed to go get a drink. Adam lets him, but as soon as Schuster kneels at the pool, he's shot dead. The posse has arrived and Adam sees that it was Flint who did the shooting.

Flint demands the third man, but Adam says he's going to make sure Blackie lives to get a fair trial and he'll fight anyone who tries to stop him. The posse backs off a bit and a few of the men even quit the posse. In the cabin, Blackie thinks it's funny that Kirk and Schuster are dead and they didn't have anything to do with the killing, but Adam's going to make sure Blackie stays alive even though he did kill the woman. He doesn't think he'll hang though. There are no witnesses. Joe's worried that Blackie might be right and it'd be easier to let the posse have him. Adam tells him that it wouldn't be right. Joe knows, but he doesn't have to like it.

Scroggs convinces the posse that they can take the Cartwrights and hang Blackie like he deserves. Flint is all for it. He calls to Adam and claims he'll let Adam keep the prisoner. He wants to shake on it. When Adam goes out to shake his hand, Scroggs knocks Adam out. The posse rushes in, hits Joe, and takes Blackie out to hang. Blackie pleads for his life. Just as they're about to hang him, Joe fires a shot and warns them that he'll kill the first man who puts weight on the rope. He takes Blackie back and helps Adam up. More men quit the posse, including Jeb and Scroggs who realizes he won't get the hanging he wanted. Even Billy leaves despite his father's pleadings to get the man that killed Billy's mother. Only two young men remain with Flint.

Adam sees everyone leave and knows it's over. He and Joe take Blackie out of the cabin. Flint asks again for Blackie. Joe and Adam note that Flint's son left him, probably got tired of looking at a man who led a lynch mob. Finally, Flint gives up and Adam and Joe take Blackie back for a trial."

Ben says once they're in, pull a rope across the street and stop them from getting out. Then they'll have the Morgans trapped and surrounded.

Hoss goes around town trying to recruit help, but everyone refuses. Some even blame Ben for bringing this on the town. The only one who agrees to help is Tom. Hoss is desperate and will take even the drunk lawyer. He starts building the barricades and he and Tom hide the rope that will hold the Morgans in. Tom's job will be to pull the rope when the gang has crossed it.

Ben has Anne bring him a gun. She comments sarcastically that he won't need it with all his friends around. Then sincerely tells him not to put his faith in the town. Ben says it's not misplaced faith. Hoss arrives with Tom. Despite the fact that he's the man that got her husband hanged, she lets him in. They manage to side step Ben's questions about the town's assistance saying things like, ""All that are willing are ready."" As Hoss leaves, Anne says Hoss can't fight the Morgans alone, he'll be killed. Hoss agrees, he probably will be.

As sundown draws nearer, Tom needs a drink to fortify himself. He goes to the saloon and sees most of the town there drowning their guilt and cowardice. Tom welcomes them to his world. He takes a bottle and gun and goes upstairs.

Hoss checks to see if Tom's ready, only to find the position empty. The doctor comes up and says he's not good with a gun, but he'll do what he can. Hoss tells him how and when to pull the rope.

The Morgans come. Ben doesn't know why there's no shooting. The rope should've been pulled and the town fighting the Morgans. The Morgans are confused by the lack of response as well. The rope gets pulled, but no one fires. Ben realizes that Hoss lied about the men and he's now out there alone. He has Anne help him up. Hoss gets a few shots out as he ducks around corners. Tom, from the window above the saloon shoots too. He's shot and falls out the window. Hoss is able to kill several members of the gang. Anne has gotten Ben outside. When she sees Tom lying in the street, she goes to him. He tells her to forget the hate and dies in her lap.

Finally, the eldest Morgan wants to face Ben alone. Hoss doesn't like the idea, but Ben agrees to meet Carl. It's a fair draw and despite Ben's wound, he wins. Now the town comes out, but they can't face Ben and he just scowls at them. Then ahe dmits to Hoss that he expected too much from them. Hoss reminds him that Tom and the doctor helped. Ben admits that there are those who do as much as they can and that makes up for the rest."

His opponent, John Henry (John Stephenson), manages to fire first. He misses, though Adam didn't even flinch. Adam tells John that if he ever insults Sue Ellen Terry again, Adam will kill him. He fires into the air, drops the dueling pistol, and leaves.

Back at the ranch, Ben (Lorne Greene) is not happy and Adam asks why, since Ben too has made ""a few grand gestures"" of his own. For one thing Adam could've gotten himself killed, but for another, Ben wonders if Sue Ellen Terry is worth it. He's heard that Sue Ellen has ""been friendly with more than one man in Virginia City."" Adam knows, but he likes her and wants to continue to see her.

Sue Ellen Terry (Fay Spain) is a lovely young saloon girl who John Henry had been seeing. He apologizes to her for causing a scene and hopes to make it up to her by giving her an expensive necklace. At first she doesn't want to take it because she doesn't want to hurt him, but he insists.

However, she continues to date Adam and the two spend an afternoon together on a picnic. She tries to tell him what kind of girl she really is and that she likes expensive things. But he doesn't think much of it and kisses her instead. When he brings her home that evening, they're met by a drunk, Dixie (Malcolm Atterbury). He insults Sue Ellen, but with Adam's hand on his neck, he apologizes. But as he stumbles away, he claims he knew Sue Ellen too. Again, Adam ignores the insinuations. She worries that there will be more men like Dixie and hopes Adam won't hate her. He promises he could never hate her and escorts Sue Ellen to her porch as her older sister watches from a window.

One day in town, Adam runs into Sheriff Jesse Sanders (Buddy Ebsen) who says he heard about the duel. Adam assures him that he and John Henry have worked things out. Jesse asks if Adam's making time with Sue Ellen. Adam tells him that that is none of Jesse's business.

Jesse goes to see Sue Ellen, but is stopped outside by her sister, Amelia (Jean Willes). Jesse leaves a message for Sue Ellen: Stop seeing Adam Cartwright.

Amelia delivers the message, but notices what a pretty girl Sue Ellen has grown up to be. She thought she was always the beautiful one and in her day she could turn heads. Sue Ellen has heard this all before and barely listens as Amelia goes on about how to get things from men. But she warns Sue Ellen that she should stay away from Adam. He's not in her class. Sue Ellen is offended and suddenly realizes what her sister has turned her into. She doesn't want to become sister who's now a bitter woman that drinks.

Sue Ellen has been invited to dinner at the Ponderosa. She tells outrageous stories about how wealthy her father was in St. Louis and how they traveled the world and had many servants. Hoss and Joe are silent in their embarrassment of her lies. Ben is coldly polite. Adam doesn't seem to mind. Realizing she's making a fool of herself, Sue Ellen asks Adam to take her home.

When he drops her off at her house, Sue Ellen admits that none of what she said was true. Adam assures her that it doesn't matter what her father did for a living. He kisses her, but suddenly a shot rings out and Sue Ellen collapses in his arms. He sees a man shooting from across the street. He fires back and then chases after the shooter, passing Dixie as he goes.

In the jail, Jesse arrests Adam for murder. Dixie said that he saw Adam shoot Sue Ellen. Adam denies it and starts to take back his gun to go in search of the real killer. Jesse knocks him out and locks him up.

The Cartwrights come to bail Adam out, but Jesse won't do it. Ben is allowed to visit Adam though. He tells Adam that he's sorry about Sue Ellen. Adam doesn't understand why anyone would want to kill her. The other men in her life meant nothing to her. He tells Ben that he knows Sue Ellen didn't love him. He doesn't think she even knew what love was. He was trying to show her, to make up for her sister.

In the saloon, Dixie is regaling the patrons with his version of what happened. He's making it up as he goes along. When the crowd decides they ought to lynch Adam, Dixie hurries out. He passes Amelia, all decked out and made up, on her way in. She finds John Henry and joins him. He comments on her manner of grieving. She tells him that Adam didn't kill Sue Ellen, but she has some idea who might have. He refuses to be blackmailed because he knows that she hated her own sister. She had more reason to kill Sue Ellen than he did.

The Cartwrights drag Dixie into the sheriff's office and Ben makes him tell the truth. He saw a man shoot at both Sue Ellen and Adam, but he couldn't tell who it was. Ben thinks Jesse should release Adam, but Jesse says he's safer in jail. The crowd is talking lynching. Ben goes out to defend his son to the mob. Jesse gives Adam a small gun. He doesn't want to leave Adam unprotected, should the mob get through. Adam asks why he shouldn't just use the gun on Jesse now. Jesse knows Adam is smarter than that. If Adam were to escape, he'd wait til evening when there's only one guard. Adam asks what Jesse would do then. Jesse says he'd give Adam eight clear hours, but then he'd come after him. He says if he catches Adam, Adam will hang.

That evening, Adam holds the gun on the deputy and escapes. As soon as he's gotten his own gun back and goes out the front, he's shot at. The shooter gets away. Adam then goes to John Henry's and demands to know if he killed Sue Ellen. John says no, but Adam should talk to Amelia.

Amelia is in her room when a man enters. She sees him in her mirror and congratulates herself on realizing he killed her sister. And for that he's going to have to pay and pay and pay. Too late she realizes he isn't going to pay. He strangles her.

Adam has just gotten to the house when he hears Amelia scream. A scream that is suddenly cut short. He rushes inside to find Amelia dead on the floor and the killer gone out the window. Ben arrives and wants to know why Adam broke jail. Adam knows he didn't stand a chance there and had to find the real killer. Ben tells him that he has to turn himself back in. Jesse is gathering a posse. Adam is stunned. Jesse had promised him eight hours. He asks Ben to tell Jesse that he'll meet Jesse at Jesse's home.

Ben relays the message and reminds Jesse that they've been friends a long time. Jesse assures him that he'll be good to the boy.

Adam is waiting for Jesse in his room, sitting behind Jesse's desk. Adam asks if Jesse plans on shooting him for trying to escape. ""Something like that,"" Jesse admits. Adam tells him that things would've gone easier for Jesse, if he'd killed Adam outside the jail. That was Jesse's first mistake. The second was to tell him he had eight hours, but then formed a posse right away. Jesse goes for his gun, but Adam has had his out and hidden behind the desk all along. He shoots first. Jesse collapses just as a crowd comes into the room. Adam asks why he killed Sue Ellen. Jesse says he wasn't aiming at Sue Ellen. He liked Sue Ellen and she liked him, until Adam came along. He was aiming at Adam. Then he dies there on the floor."

They haven't had much luck and Hoss says it's time to return. They plan to pack out the next day.

That night, an Indian holds a knife on Joe. He wakes up and the two wrestle briefly. Coming to Joe's aid, Hoss leaps over the campfire. But in his haste he knocks in their supplies and ammo. Bullets start to fire in every direction. Hoss and Joe take cover behind trees, but the Indian just lays still on the ground. When the ""attack"" is over, they check on the Indian and discover that she's a pregnant woman who's due any day now. Joe wants to get her to a doctor as quickly as possible, but Hoss is afraid she'd die on the journey.

Joe goes looking for traces of her people, but discovers she was traveling alone and intentionally heading southeast. She's Shoshone and that would take her into Paiute country. The only thing they can figure is that she was heading to Virginia City for some reason.

With their supplies gone, Hoss has cooked wild beans which Joe can barely tolerate. When they try to feed the Indian woman (Chana Eden) she ignores them. She won't respond to any of their questions either. Hoss finally gets her to eat saying she needs to take care of the baby. To Joe, this means she understands English, but Hoss thinks she's just worried about the baby.

Hoss builds the woman a shelter while Joe attempts to find food. He doesn't have much luck. Despite the fact that they're clearly trying to help the woman, she still refuses to answer their questions. Joe's more worried about her having the baby because, as he tells her, ""what we don't know about delivering babies would scare you to death.""

Over the next several days, they manage to catch duck and rabbit to eat. Then finally, the woman goes into labor. After some initial panic, Hoss delivers a healthy baby boy and presents him to Joe to keep warm by the fire. When he returns to the woman, she asks, in perfect English, if her baby girl is perfect. Hoss, stunned at how well she speaks, says he's perfect, but he's a boy. She isn't happy to hear that which just confuses Hoss. When he returns to Joe, Joe announces that the baby has blue eyes. His father must be a white man.

Joe finds a Shoshone amulet. He thinks her people are around, but doesn't understand why they don't just attack. Hoss says the amulet could've been left months ago. Joe's getting angry with the woman because, even though she speaks English, she still refuses to speak to them. When she sees the amulet, she turns away in fear. Joe belives it's because her people have come for her. But Hoss says it's a war piece and it's forbidden for a Shoshone woman to even see it.

The weather turns worse and even though the woman's not ready to move, they have to get off the mountain. As they make their way down, Joe has the feeling they're being watched. That night Hoss takes first watch.

Hoss wakes up from dozing on his watch to find a Shoshone knife embedded in the tree he's leaning against. He wakes Joe and they know it's a warning. They still don't know why the Shoshone haven't just attacked, but go to wake the woman and keep moving. She's gone. She covered a log with her blanket to look like she was sleeping and left with the baby.

As she hurries down the mountainside, four Shoshone chase her. Hoss and Joe aren't far behind and start shooting. The Shoshone run off as the woman hides in the bushes. Ben (Lorne Greene) and Adam (Pernell Roberts) have been out looking for Hoss and Joe, since they're a week overdue, and hear the gunshots. They find Hoss and Joe who try feably to explain.

They've managed to get the woman back to the Ponderosa. Ben is angry that Hoss and Joe would interfere with the Shoshone. They defend themselves saying they couldn't just leave her. Hop Sing (Victor Sen Yung) comes down the stairs complaining that the next time they bring home a baby they should bring a laundry boy too. He doesn't have time for diapers.

In the woman's room, the doctor (Carlyle Mitchell) tells the Cartwrights that the baby, surprisingly, is fine. But the woman has a very high fever. When he's departed, the woman asks for her baby. Ben's concerned when he sees the pained look on her face.

Ben's staying up late that night, when Hop Sing rushes downstairs to say the woman needs help. He has Hop Sing send Adam for the doctor while he bathes the woman's face with cool towels. He asks her to please tell him who the father is so that he can send for him. She is silent and then dies quietly.

There's a knock at the door and Sumner Kyle (Raymond Bailey) demands to see Ben. Ben comes down and politely greets Sumner and his son, Jason (Steven Terrell), but he and Sumner are not friends. Sumner gets to the point. Jason is the Indian baby's father, as Ben must know, and he's wants the woman sent away. He'll pay for her silence. Ben tells him not to worry, the woman never revealed the father's name. Jason insists he was married to her in a Shoshone ceremony and still loves her. But, he had nothing to offer her that didn't belong to his father, including himself. He wants to see the woman. Ben says she's upstairs, but that she died. Sumner even tries to stop Jason from going then, but Ben holds him back.

The Cartwrights, Hop Sing, and Jason, bury the Indian woman. As they have a small funeral, the Shoshone arrive. One is chief in a full headdress. After the prayer, Jason asks to have his son. Ben tells him that they just buried the chief's only child, but the bloodline continues in the baby. Nothing will keep the chief from his grandson. Jason asks to have his baby and asks Ben to tell his father that he went home. Jason takes the baby and rides away with the Shoshone."

Read all,[],TV-G,Release date,['Lewis Allen'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Bonanza's ""The Outcast"" portrays a woman, Leta Malvet (Susan Oliver), who is ostracized by the town of Virginia City for the criminal acts of her father and brother, whose boots are shown hanging before a lynch mob for the crimes of their wearers in the opening scene. Then the map burns, featuring the then-newly shot sequence of the Cartwrights galloping towards us at Big Bear Lake, California.

The distraught Leta is taken in by Ben Cartwright to rest at Ponderosa for several days on the advice of the doctor. Leta's lover, Clay Renton (Jack Lord) pays a visit to Ponderosa to check up on Leta, much to the chagrin of Ben and Adam. While Adam voices his concerns to Ben about Clay's visit on account of his criminal past, ol' Hoss reserves judgement.

Ben gives Leta a carriage ride over to her house and assures her that the Cartwrights will help her in any way possible. She will need all the help she can get, because the townsfolk go out of their way to give her the snub job as she goes about her business in town. Leta has to choose between fleeing town to begin a new life elsewhere, free of the opprobrium of the townspeople, or to stay and tought it out.

She decides that she can make a living by continuing to sell the eggs from the chickens that she keeps to Harvey Bufford (Edward Platt) who runs a general store in town.

Clay waits inside for her as she enters her house and as he talks to Leta he suggests that she has been converted by Ben Cartwright. For her part, Leta never thought of herself as a bad person to start with and is puzzled by Clay's stance on the matter. Nevertheless, she is clearly in love with Clay and wants to marry him, despite his sordid past.

Next, we see Leta carrying a basket of eggs to sell to Bufford's store, drawing disapproving stares and discourtesies from the residents whom she encounters along the way. While negotiating the sale of the eggs with Harvey Bufford, she fancies a pair of ladies' boots but states that she doesn't have enough money to buy them. Harvey insists that she take the boots and even places them into her basket on top of the eggs. But Harvey's price for the boots is Leta's feminine favors, which draws her ire and she smacks him away. Clay enters the store and witnesses the aftermath of their little altercation, warning Harvey to stay away from Leta. As Harvey's wife enters to see what the commotion is about Harvey coldly accuses Leta of trying to steal the boots and picks them up from the basket to show his wife. However, his wife states with clear purpose to Harvey, ""I saw EVERYTHING"".

Now, the Cartwrights have been finding new and ingenious ways to transport the miners' payroll across their Ponderosa ranch without tipping their hand to bandits who had stolen it in the past. This time, Hoss and Lil Joe ride up to the ranch house with a carriage load of wood, except the payroll is concealed beneath the wood. As they unload the payroll cache they unwittingly reveal their secret to Clay who spies them through a pair of binoculars.

It turns out that Clay is a member of the band of robbers who have been targeting the payroll run, but their leader, Spence, seems unwilling to make the hit until the situation is nearly perfect. This does not sit well with the ambitious Clay, who argues with Spence that he could pull it off, saying that he will rob Bufford's store to get enough money to buy fresh horses for the heist. As the dispute escalates, Clay shoots Spence dead to take over the band of outlaws.

Meanwhile, Hoss delivers a sack of feed to Leta for her chickens. She intrigues him with the request to wait at her kitchen table for a surprise. It turns out to be an innocent one as she shows Hoss the wedding dress that she made. When Hoss learns that she intends to marry Clay Renton, his demeanor turns down, but her optimism about starting a better life with Clay shines through the gloomy outlook that we see in Hoss' eyes.

Now the threads come together as Leta carries her home-made wedding dress to town to enter it into the dress contest at the annual Bazaar, but as Mrs. Bufford (Irene Tedrow) is chief arbiter she turns away Leta, telling her that she is too late. Down the street Clay and his band break in to Bufford's store which is closed for the Bazaar, break into the safe, but find only fifty dollars inside. Harvey Bufford enters his store to retrieve a parasol for his wife, but discovers his safe has been cracked open. Clay confronts him and pistol-whips him several times, then flees with his band.

Ben and Hoss came to town to enjoy the Bazaar while Adam and Joe were instructed to carry the miners' payroll today. Ben spots Harvey slumping out the front door of his store and a crowd rushes to his aid as he gasps Clay Renton's name, then gives up the ghost. Ben resolves to find Clay before the town sets another lynch mob after him.

Ben sends Hoss to find his brothers and meet him at Ponderosa. They find that three of the men were seen heading toward the lake, so Ben sends his boys to get them while he heads to Leta's place alone. As expected, Clay is there, but hides in Leta's bedroom while Ben tries to convince her to bring Clay to justice. She fears for Clay's life, but Ben assures her that he will do everything he can to ensure that Clay gets a fair hearing.

Upon leaving, Ben discovers Clay's horse behind Leta's house while Adam shows up to deliver news of the capture of the rest of the band of outlaws. Ben tries to talk Leta out of the house, but Clay plans to take Leta out the back door and make a run for it. The situation worsens when the angry mob from town shows up, not interested in the least in Ben's notion of justice nor fairness; they want blood!

As Clay expounds on his getaway plans, Leta grabs her rifle and orders him to put down his gun. Instead he hides it in his boot and commends Leta on her negotiating skill with Ben, thinking she is on his side in her own getaway plan. She opens the door and follows Clay outside, keeping her rifle trained on him the whole time. Ben tells the crowd he will handle this and if they want Clay so badly he will have his back turned toward them, counting on their honor not to shoot him to get Clay. But, Leta surprises Clay by telling Ben to check his boot for the gun. Seeing that the game is up, Clay reaches down to his boot to draw his weapon, but old Ben is faster, dropping Clay to the ground.

As this morbid scene draws to a close, Mrs. Bufford offers her apologies having now seen Leta's true colors for the first time."

Checking into the hotel, he asks the clerk if he knows the Cartwrights. Tom (Dan Riss) says everyone on the Washoe knows the Cartwrights and indicates that Adam and Little Joe are in town. Kyle asks if ""Little Joe"" is Joseph Francis. Tom laughs, ""You call him that, you better be ready to duck.""

Joe is in the adjoining saloon playing poker when Kyle comes in and watches. Joe doesn't realize it, but the man he's playing against, Gorman (John Anderson), is cheating. Gorman's partner, Regis (Stacy Harris) is standing behind Joe signalling. Kyle intervenes and manages to keep Joe from fighting the two. However, Regis pulls a gun and Gorman swings at Kyle. Despite his lack of one arm, Kyle fights a good fight and wins. Joe, meanwhile, has taken care of Regis. When the fights over, Joe asks Kyle to dinner. After they've left, Gorman wants to follow, but Regis says he remembers Kyle from Kansas. He figures Kyle will be their ""money tree.""

At dinner, Kyle says he's come to the area looking for silver investors for his backers in the East. Joe volunteers to introduce him to the silver mine owners. Hoss jokes that Kyle picked the wrong Cartwright. Joe has hot southern blood and doesn't understand hard cold cash. But Adam's from New England and it just comes naturally to him. Kyle asks about Hoss and he says he's in between. Ben explains that Hoss was born on the prairie as they came west. Hoss adds that he doesn't understand all this talk about North and South. Ben assures him that they all have roots on the Ponderosa now. Kyle says that ideologies go deeper than where a person lives, but changes the subject by accepting Joe's offer to meet the silver owners.

The next day in the saloon, Hoss and Ben walk into an argument about North and South. Again, Ben tries to calm things by saying Virginia City is neither. The Yankee (Mickey Simpson) notices Ben has a NY newspaper and asks Ben what it says. The Reb (John Locke) doesn't want to hear a northern's view, but Ben is encouraged to read it. Ben reads about Lincoln's ""House Divided"" speech. The argument begins to flare up again, but Kyle has entered the saloon and he has a newspaper from Charleston. He too reads about the speech, but it's not entirely condemning. Yank is surprised a southern paper would write that. Kyle replies, ""A man who honestly knows what he believes and has courage enough to act on it, is a man deserving of praise from all men.""

Returning to his hotel room, Kyle is stopped by Regis and Gorman. They've been checking into Kyle and know he's there to acquire silver ore. They figure it's for ""the Cause."" Regis says there are some owners who might not want to go along and for $5000, he and Gorman can be Kyle's own little army. Kyle listens, but is infuriated at their reference ""for the Cause."" Shoving Regis against the wall, he threatens them not to speak of the Cause that way. Again, Gorman wants to fight, but Regis stops him and says this is just a business arrangement. Kyle agrees to that.

Adam goes to the hotel looking for Joe. Tom tells him that Joe had been out introducing Kyle around, but now Kyle's upstairs alone. Just then, Regis and Gorman come down talking about the temper of the one armed man. Adam wonders who they are and why they're talking to Kyle. Tom says the two just got out of prison, but he doesn't know anything about Kyle. If anyone knows about Kyle, it'd be Joe since they've spent so much time together lately. In fact, Tom mentions, Kyle asked about Joe as soon as he got into town.

Adam goes home and informs Ben about Kyle's interest in Joe. Ben's concerned and goes into town himself.

Kyle and Joe are meeting with mine owner, Hennessy (Howard Wendell) in the saloon. Hennessy is not interested in selling his ore to Kyle. Not only does he have buyers in San Francisco, but he wouldn't sell to Kyle anyway. He's heard about Kyle's Southern sympathies and his leanings are in the opposite direction. He leaves. Joe doesn't understand why Hennessy would bring politics into a business deal, especially since Kyle was offering 1/3 more for the ore. Kyle isn't concerned and thanks Joe for introducing him to so many mine owners. He says it helps to have a Cartwright on his side. Joe doesn't understand that and Kyle says before he came to Virginia City he did some research. He checked to see if the Cartwrights were the same ones he'd heard about. He tells Joe that he knew Joe's mother, Marie in New Orleans. He gives Joe a pocket portrait of Marie that he's had for years. Joe is very moved with the gift. To cover his emotions, he offers to take Kyle to meet the last few mine owners in the morning and leaves.

Ben enters the hotel and asks Tom about Kyle. A woman happens to overhear and says she just checked Kyle's room and he's not in. She introduces herself as Lily Van Cleet (Marianne Stewart) who's on her way to California. They sit in the adjoining restaurant and chat. She learns that Ben has a ranch and three sons. She says she had a son named Joseph too. But he died a year ago in a street fight. ""What's happening in Virginia City happened in the east over a year ago."" She lost her son and her husband that night.

Kyle walks up and is surprised to see Lily. Before he can walk her away, Ben asks to speak to him. She gives them a chance to speak privately and Ben wants to know why Kyle sought Joe out. Kyle admits that he knew Marie and gave Joe a picture of her. Ben warns Kyle to leave Joe alone.

The next morning, in Kyle's room, Lily combs her hair. They're married, but she's the daughter of a Northern senator and doesn't believe in her husband's cause. But she does still love him. She laments that this cause has taken their son, his arm, and their marriage. He's still angry that Northern hypocrites took their son, but promises to return to her when all this is over.

Later, Hennessy tells Kyle that he's going to Washington and he's going to tell people what Kyle is up to. Kyle threatens him not to try it. When Hennessy leaves, Kyle calls Regis over.

Hennessy and Lily both climb aboard the stage. As it moves through a mountain turn, it suddenly falls over a cliff.

The bodies have been brought to the Ponderosa and seeing who the victims were, Ben has contacted Kyle. Kyle looks under the blanket and cringes. He asks how it happened. A boulder was in the middle of the road and the driver didn't have a chance. Based on the foot prints, two men were involved. Ben asks who the woman was to Kyle. Kyle merely says she was someone he once knew. Adam is frustrated and demands to know what Kyle is planning. Joe defends Kyle, but Adam insists Kyle is hiding something. Ben breaks it up.

Kyle returns to the saloon and finds Gorman and Regis. At gunpoint, he takes them into a small supply room at the back. He tosses the gun aside and proceeds to beat both of them up.

The next day at the crash site, Kyle finds Lily's cape and caresses it. The sheriff (Kenneth MacDonald) agrees it was murder, but wants to know why Kyle thought Regis and Gorman were involved. Hoss and Joe come down with some tools and one has Gorman's initials on it. That may prove it was Regis and Gorman, but Adam too wants to know how Kyle knew that last night when he beat the two up. Again, Joe comes to Kyle's defense saying Adam's had it out for Kyle since he arrived. They start to fight, but Ben breaks it up. ""Brother against brother. How dare you! Each of you.""

Ben has dozed off when Hoss and Adam wake him to say the Joe came home, but backed a bag and left again. Ben wants to know why Adam didn't stop him. Feeling a bit guilty, Adam says he intends to and walks out. Hoss tells Ben that Adam plans to leave too. Ben hurries after him.

He tries to stop Adam, who's gathering his things, but Adam won't listen. He says he's going to New England, but wants Joe to know that suddenly he found himself saying things he didn't mean, didn't even believe. Then marches over to his waiting horse. Ben again tries to plead with Adam to stay. He can't stand by and watch his family fall apart. Adam tells him the damage has already been done. ""It's got to be me or Little Joe and he needs you more than I do."" Ben is very worried and begs Adam, ""I don't want you to go."" Adam doesn't want to leave, but says they can't have two different views in the same house, it won't work! And he rides off. Hoss figures that Mr. Lincoln must've been talking about houses like theirs. ""No, not us, Hoss. Not us,"" Ben quietly insists.

Kyle and Joe are meeting with some of the mine owners when Ben barges in and kicks them all out. He says Joe can stay and hear what he has to say and then Joe can decide for himself what he wants to do. Ben accuses Kyle of acquiring the silver to back the Confederacy. He accuses Kyle of giving anything for his beliefs. Kyle doesn't see anything wrong with that, or doesn't Ben believe in anything? ""I believe in my sons,"" Ben says firmly. And he lost two of them today. Joe feels a bit ashamed about that. Ben again asks about Lily. Kyle refuses to talk about her. Ben says he knows, he could feel, that Kyle loved her. What is Kyle willing to sacrifice? Kyle still won't answer, though he's clearly bothered by Ben's talk. Ben asks if she was just a woman he met in a saloon? This pushes Kyle over the edge and he starts to attack Ben, but he can't swing. He complains that Ben wasn't going to get involved, this wasn't Ben's fight. Ben says Kyle made it his fight. He reminds Kyle that Kyle lost a son and now a wife, will nothing stand in his way. Kyle says nothing will. And this won't be the end. There will be brother against brother and father against son. Ben tells him that in the end it will all have been a useless waste.

When Kyle leaves, Joe knows what he's lost and apologizes to Ben. Ben reminds him that a tree has many roots, but it only has one tap root and Joe's is on the Ponderosa.

Joe has gone in search of Adam, only to find him staring out over the lake. Joe says he has something to say and Adam had better listen. He says Adam has always been the one who got to stay up late and other privileges because he was the oldest and helped Ben with the problems of the Ponderosa. Well Joe's not going to take it anymore, not if he and Hoss are the ones who are staying. Adam doesn't look at him, but continues to look at the lake. ""That lake sure gets under your skin. Let's go home."""
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529733/?ref_=ttep_ep19,,Hoss and Little Joe are mistaken for bloodthirsty hired killers in a small Texas town dominated by two feuding families.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],"['noose', 'evil twins', 'good twin and evil twin', 'texas', 'hired killer', 'twin', 'twins', 'doppelganger', 'identical twins', 'evil twin', 'loco weed', 'hatfield mccoy feud', 'cowardly sheriff', 'bar shootout', 'bar fight', 'opening action scene', 'gunfight', 'shootout', 'town drunk', 'shot in the back', 'mistaken identity', 'escape from jail', 'dual role']",[],"This comedic episode has Hoss and Joe mistaken for gunslingers, the Slade Brothers.

The Slades have been hired by the McFaddens in their feud against the Hatfields in the small Texas town of Kiowa Flats.

Hoss and Joe ride into town and wonder about the actions of the townspeople (who've been warned the Slades were coming.) In the saloon, Hoss wonders if he smells funny or something. He asks the bartender, Sully (Bill McLean) if there's anything wrong with them. Sully nervously assures him, ""No sir!"" When Hoss comments on the nice day, Sully is nearly in tears nervously agreeing. Hoss and Joe leave, tipping their hat to the sheriff as they go and head over to the hotel. They don't know it, but the whole town follows them over and peeks through the door at them. Sully still terrified by the way Hoss looked at him.

Later they come downstairs to find a contingency of women, mostly young and beautiful, except for the leader Lorna Doone Mayberry (Ellen Corby) who's an older, wiser woman. The group stop Hoss and Joe and beg them not to kill their men folk. There's not enough to go around as it is. Again, Hoss and Joe find the actions of these people odd, but promise not to kill any that aren't worth killing.

When the boys step outside, they are shot at. They dive into the saloon for cover. But as the shooting continues they think it best if they do as their told and throw out their guns. The Hatfields take Hoss and Joe prisoner and demand they admit that they're the Slade brothers. Jubel Hatfield (George Mitchell) doesn't believe the boys are from Nevada come to Texas to buy cattle. He thinks they should just hang them. Fortunately, Sheriff Brown (Henry Hull) arrives and says they should wait for Twirly Boggs to get back since Twirly is the only one who knows what the Slades look like. The sheriff takes Hoss and Joe to jail for their own protection.

In jail, Hoss figures everyone in town is ""tetched"" from eating the beef of cattle that ate the loco weed. Then a rock with a note comes through the window. It says that Black Alonzo, the Red Handed Avenger will save them. Hoss looks out the window to see a little boy running away.

The ladies of Kiowa Flats all march into the jail and Lorna proceeds to recite her poem. ""Oh poor doomed prisoners, it ain't too late. Down on your knees as you face your awful fate. Repent your crimes before that trap is sprung. And you, like a side of beef, are hung."" The young ladies in the group are taken by handsome young Joseph and argue over who gets to hold his hand as Lorna reads her poetry. And as the poem drags on and on, Joe thinks hanging would be less painful, but Hoss is near tears from it.

When the poem is finally over, the young women again complain that the town is short of men and their wasting two at once by hanging Hoss and Joe. As the young women argue who's been monopolizing Joe's hand, the back wall of the cell falls down. Hoss and Joe don't think twice about busting out and eagerly accept the opportunity.

The McFaddens have sprung the boys and take them back to their home. All along they've protested that they are not the Slades, but, like the Hatfields, the McFaddens don't believe them. The father, Alonso McFadden (Douglas Spencer) locks them in a room for the night. As Hoss and Joe are getting ready for bed, a young boy, Alonzo (Dennis Holmes) climbs in through the window. Hoss recognizes him as the Red Handed Avenger. He explains that they McFaddens hired the Slades to kill Anse Hatfield, cuz he's the best shot in town. Once Anse is dead, the McFaddens can commence killing all the other Hatfields. Hoss and Joe are not going to be party to this. Since Alonzo threatens to call for help, the boys have to tie him up. Then they climb out the window.

Unfortunately, Hoss makes a racket as he trips over a milk bucket, alerting the McFaddens to their escape. They're recaptured.

In the morning, Hoss and Joe refuse to take arms and shoot the Hatfields. Alonso says then they'll just hang them. Hoss and Joe pick up the guns. Hoss does convince Alonso to ride into town and let Twirly identify them as not being the Slades.

Twirly (King Donovan) is the town drunk and he's regaling everyone with the stories from his school days with the Slade brothers. When the sheriff announces that the Slades are approaching, everyone rushes out. But Twirly calls them back to save the whiskey. When Hoss and Joe arrive, Twirly says they are the Slades. (Michael Landon and Dan Blocker played duel roles as Shorty Jim and Big Jack Slade, so they would look alike.) That's enough for the McFaddens and they demand that Hoss and Joe fulfill their obligation.

As the McFaddens prepare for the fight, Hoss and Joe ask the sheriff how it all began. Seems 30 years ago the Hatfields' hog disappeared. And that night, the McFaddens, who didn't own a hog, had pork for dinner. The sheriff admits he knows they're not the Slades and gives them their guns and horses back.

As Hoss and Joe make their way to leave, little Alonzo marches by and announces he's going to kill some Hatfields. Hoss and Joe know what they have to do just by looking at each other. ""That's what I like about us as a family, Joe. Pa always taught us to never do nothing the others would be ashamed of. I'd like to keep it like that,"" Hoss says. They go back into the saloon to talk to the sheriff.

The sheriff has a plan. Hoss then goes over to talk to Lorna. He says it wold be a shame to lose more men when there's so few to go around. He says women have a way of getting men to do what they want. Lorna thinks Hoss isn't so stupid.

Just as the fight is about to begin, the ladies all march between the two sides. They refuse to move or do any womanly things a woman ought to do until they call this silly feud off. Beautiful young Amanda McFadden tells Anse Hatfield that she's waiting for him to come to her, but he better not come with a gun in his hand. Anse isn't a fool. He drops the gun and hurries over. Followed by everyone except Jubel and Alonso. ""It was such a nice day for a fight too."" Hoss, Joe, and the sheriff all shake hands on the success of their plan."

The Cartwrights go into Virginia City, though it's not for retribution. They fear that any action they might take would cause more harm for the local Chinese. But then Ben and Adam run into Lee Chang (Philip Ahn) as he leaves Hammond's store. His son Jimmy is having a birthday party and wants it to be a real American party. Adam tells him not to worry, just have a cake with candles. Lee says he didn't know it had to be candles and not flags. Ben realizes Lee was denied inside the store. Lee doesn't want to cause any trouble and moves on.

Ben and Adam go into the store and Ben asks for American flags. Hammond (Arthur Space) says he doesn't have any little flags. Ben hadn't specified little ones. Another customer, a sleazy man named Tibbs (Christoper Dark,) asks if Ben meant the little ones. Adam doesn't like Tibbs, he's a thief and a gunslinger, and tells Tibbs to mind his own business. Hammond pretends he just found the little flags and sells them to Ben.

Outside, Ben tells Adam not to let Tibbs bother him. Then they notice a sign advertising Andy Fulmer for Virginia City mayor. Ben puts two and two together. Fulmer is a bigot, Tibbs works for Fulmer.

Ben goes to see Fulmer and asks what Fulmer's campaign platform will be. Fulmer (Gene Evans) says he wants to give Virginia City back to the people who made it. Foreigners are taking all the jobs. Ben asks if ""foreigners"" means the Irish, Welsh, or Chinese. Fulmer says he's fighting for the rights of the Irish and Welsh. He doesn't want to hear one of Ben's high and mighty speeches on prejudice. This is Virginia City and Ben can't even vote, so it's not his fight. Ben says that if he finds out the Fulmer had anything to do with his cook being beaten, he'll drag Fulmer up and down the streets.

Hoss and Joe run into Jimmy Chang (Guy Lee) on his way to work. They're going to be at his birthday party and he's looking forward to it. Hoss is too, but he's concerned about the bird's nest soup that they'll be eating. Jimmy just laughs.

Sally Ridley (Patricia Michon) dismounts in front of her father's livery when Billy Wheeler (Ray Stricklyn) approaches and greets her inappropriately. She chastises him and takes her horse into the stable, handing it off to Jimmy. Billy continues to goad her about who she's been spending time with. When he tries to force Sally to kiss him, Jimmy pulls him off. Billy hits Jimmy to the ground, warns him that that was a mistake Jimmy will regret, and leaves. Sally kneels beside Jimmy and starts to tend to his wounds. Her father, J.R. Ridley (Frank Ferguson) walks in and finds Jimmy in her lap. He accuses her of disgracing herself with a heathen and pulls a gun to threaten Jimmy. Sally tries to take the gun from him when it goes off and she falls to the ground dead. Jimmy crawls over to her. Ridley is in shock and drops the gun near Jimmy. Sally's older sister, Amanda (Helen Westcott) comes in and sees the scene. Billy comes in and laughs, he warned Jimmy about his mistake.

Everyone at Jimmy's party is worried because Jimmy is late. He comes running in, beaten. He tells Hoss, Joe, and Lee what happened, but says the men think he killed Sally. Tibbs calls from outside that they came for Jimmy. He says they can send Jimmy out to be taken to jail, or they'll hang him. Hoss and Joe agree to take Jimmy to jail themselves and Jimmy goes willingly. He believes in America everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

At the jail, the Cartwrights and Sheriff Halstead (Gregg Barton) believe Jimmy, but there will be an inquest. The sheriff warns that Fulmer has been waiting for something like this since he announced his candidacy.

Fulmer calls Ridley to his office. Ridley is still in shock. Fulmer goes on about how the town, his friends, are behind him during this tragedy. Ridley explains it was an accident and he shot Sally. But Fulmer convinces him that it wouldn't have happened if Sally was with a nice, American boy. Ridley comes to believe Jimmy caused Sally's death.

At the inquest, Billy lies and says he found Jimmy and Sally carrying on so he went and told Mr. Ridley. Amanda testifies that Jimmy killed Sally. The judge (Alexander Campbell) wants only the facts. Amanda says everyone knows what kind of girl Sally was carrying on with all the boys. She says she heard the shot and found Jimmy kneeling next to Sally's body with his gun at his side where he dropped it. Adam and Ben can't believe Amanda's attitude. Adam is shocked to realize she's jealous of her own sister. Finally, Ridley takes the stand but only says that Jimmy caused Sally's death. Billy is thrilled. He's sure they'll hang Jimmy now. Fulmer says it's hard to tell with a jury. Tibbs suggests it never get as far as a jury. Fulmer likes that idea.

Fulmer continues to spread the poison. At a meeting in Hammond's he says that allowing a Chinese boy to get away with murder is like saying they don't care about their own wives and daughters. He thinks they should do something about it.

The Cartwrights are in the jail and worried about a lynch mob. They all agree to be deputies. Adam decides to talk to Amanda. He leaves and the crowd gathering outside let him go.

Amanda lets Adam in and he comments on all the parties they used to have at her house. She tells him that they haven't entertained in seven years since her mother died and she had to take over the family household. Adam sympathizes. Amanda complains that Sally made it difficult. The way she behaved was shameful. Adam tells her life hasn't past her by and to stop feeling sorry for herself. She tells him to mind his own business. Adam argues that when a young boy's life is at stake, it's everyone's business. She asks if she's just supposed to march up there and say it was all a mistake. Adam says, yes, if it was a mistake that's what he expects her to do. He's always admired her courage to stand up for herself. She falls into his arms crying. She doesn't know what to do. He looks into her face and says, ""Tell the truth."" Just then, Ridley comes in and tells Adam to leave them alone. Jimmy's a murderer and he'll get a fair trial. Adam insists Jimmy won't get a fair trial unless Fulmer says so. He accuses Ridley of being afraid to stand up to Fulmer. Ridley says he's not afraid of anyone. Amanda says they should go tell Fulmer they want to tell the truth and she'll go with him.

Adam, Ridley, and Amanda go to see Fulmer, but Adam has to wait outside. When Ridley says he wants to tell the truth, Fulmer brainwashes him again. Amanda sits there stunned. When they leave, Adam asks what happened. Amanda says she'll convince her father back. Adam says Jimmy's life depends on it.

He returns to the jail and tells them what happened. If Amanda can't convince her father, they'll have a lynch mob on their hands.

Amanda tells her father that Jimmy will die. Ridley says Sally died. Suddenly Amanda realizes that Ridley isn't trying to punish Jimmy, he's trying to punish Sally for disgracing their name. She wonders if he pulled the trigger on purpose. He swears it was an accident. She tells him that if they let Jimmy die, they'll be the ones who are guilty.

Fulmer has the crowd ready for a lynching. As they march toward the jail, the Cartwrights shoot over their heads, scattering them and forcing them to take cover. Ridley runs up and tells Fulmer that he's going to tell the sheriff the truth. He turns towards the jail. Fulmer tells Tibbs to ""get him."" Tibbs shoots Fulmer in the back. Now Fulmer accuses Tibbs of murder. Tibbs is stunned and confused, but the mob has now turned on him. Adam calls to him to drop his gun. Tibbs turns and fires. Adam fires back killing Tibbs. Amanda rushes up and tells the sheriff that they lied on the stand, Jimmy didn't kill Sally.

Ben asks Fulmer if he's happy now that three people are dead. Fulmer won't take the blame for these killings. The crowd, however, turns its back on Fulmer. He chases after them desperately trying to win back their votes."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529826/?ref_=ttep_ep21,,The Cartwrights try to disprove the validity of a Spanish land grant to stop the De La Cuesta family from seizing part of the Ponderosa and all of the Carson Valley settlers' homestead lands.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],"['star crossed lovers', 'land grant dispute', 'flamenco dancing', 'knife in back', 'criminal mastermind', 'trampled by a horse', 'spanish guitar', 'cantina dancer', 'spanish royalty', 'impersonating royalty']",[],"The episode opens with a settler being evicted from his land by some Spanish vacqueros. When the couple insist they're not leaving, one vacquero moves toward the house. Mary Logan (Claudia Bryar) moves to stop him and is shoved to the ground. Her husband (John Frederick) comes to her defense and is shot in the back by Sanchez (Paul Picerni). Mary is warned to be off the property and an eviction notice is nailed to the porch.

The Cartwrights heard the gun shot and hurry to the Logan home, but they're too late. Mary is distraught. She doesn't want to leave the home she and her husband worked for five years. They're expecting a child now too, but her husband is dead. Ben convinces her to leave with them and stops Joe from chasing after the vacqueros.

Ben and Adam go to report the murder to Sheriff Hawkins (Stuart Randall). But Hawkins is already aware of the killing. Senor Luga (Sebastian Cabot), Sanchez's boss, has already provided a complete report and claims it was self-defense. Ben and Adam don't agree. Luga asks why they're interfering, it's not their fight. Adam reminds him that Luga is also trying to take some of their land. Luga brushes it off as just a few hundred acres, the Cartwrights will barely know it's gone. Ben argues that they care about every foot of their property. Luga claims it is the property of his niece, Isabella de la Cuesta.

Luga returns to the hotel suite to find Isabella (Patricia Medina) kissing Sanchez. He ignores her reprimand for not knocking saying it is common for gentlemen to meet in her presence. Sanchez leaves. Isabella is tired of being stuck in the hotel room. Luga reminds her that it is far more luxurious than what she is accustomed to and he doesn't want her leaving and jeopardizing everything he's worked for. She says that if she is Isabella de la Cuesta, as he claims, what could she jeopardize. He reminds her that Isabella is a lady, she is not.

Back at the Ponderosa, Joe wants to know how Luga can just come in and make claims on land. Ben says he has an old Spanish land grant which has been upheld. The law is on his side. Joe asks what they could do if the claim wasn't valid. Ben says they'd fight it. He sends Hoss and Joe to Monterey to verify the claim. Adam suggests that they should also verify the great lady, Isabella. He says he's going to go talk to her. Ben doesn't think that will accomplish much, she and Luga are in this together. Adam says they can't know that since no one's spoken to her.

Adam goes to the hotel and sees Isabella leaving. He follows her to a cantina outside of town. She starts dancing seductively with the Flamenco dancer. When she's done she has a seat and a cowboy comes over to her. Highcard Smith (Holly Bane) says he remembers her as Rosita from San Francisco. She says he's mistaken, but he insists. He's heard she's claiming to be Isabella and figures she wouldn't want her previous life made public. Isabella continues to refuse him and Adam steps in to send him away. He pulls a knife. Adam sidesteps it and pulls his gun sending Smith on his way.

Isabella thanks Adam for his help, but when she learns he's a Cartwright she becomes suspicious. Luga told her the Cartwrights were causing them problems. Adam says he hopes to cause Luga many problems, but a gentleman always helps a lady. She allows him to walk her back to the hotel.

Sanchez sees the two and reports to Luga. Luga tells Sanchez not to interfere, but he's not pleased.

In her rooms, Adam sips some wine and begins asking her about the land grant. She doesn't want to talk about it. He asks how she justifies throwing people off their land. She says it is her land. Adam argues that it belongs to the settlers who worked and sweated over it. She asks how Adam holds his land, with sweat or a title. ""With both,"" he tells her. He asks when she learned she was an heiress. She says when her uncle, Luga, found her and told her. Adam asks where Luga found her, because Adam found her in a cantina and no Spanish lady would be found there. She refuses to discuss her past, but she does start to flirt with him. He responds by leaning in for a kiss. But she steps away and says that when a man kisses her he will have love in his eyes, not business. Adam takes the dismissal and leaves.

Luga isn't happy that she's been with a Cartwright and wants to know what she told him. She counters by saying it would help them to have a Cartwright on their side. Luga likes that idea.

At home, Adam tells Ben that Isabella isn't the woman he thought she'd be. He wonders if Luga is really the one who's trying to take all the land. Ben doesn't see the difference, the two are working together.

Adam takes Isabella riding. She begs for a break. Adam says he thought all Spanish ladies enjoyed riding. She claims she's out of practice. Again she asks why they have to be on opposite sides. Adam says they don't have to be and kisses her. He wants to show her something and takes her over to the Logan house. He says a couple who were expecting a child lived there. She doesn't care, they can live someplace else. Adam tells her the wife and child can, but the husband is dead. Sanchez killed him. She didn't know about the killings and is upset about it. But she won't call Luga and his men off. The land is hers and she's going to be great lady. Is that so bad? He warns her that she'll never enjoy the land, there's too much blood on it.

Smith arrives at the hotel and informs Luga that he knows who Isabella is. Luga says he doesn't care, they're not afraid of her past. Smith says it could confuse a jury to learn that Isabella is also Rosita Moralez. Luga offers him some money. Smith takes it and says he'll keep scratching their backs if they keep scratching his. When he's gone, Sanchez says Smith will be back. ""Unless something else happens to him first,"" Luga replies.

Adam is explaining to Ben that Isabella really was upset about the killings. Ben isn't impressed if she still refuses to withdraw the claim.

Smith arrives at the Ponderosa and tells them he's got information about Isabella. Adam doesn't want to hear it, but Ben says it's what they've been looking for. He dangles a bag of coins in front of Smith who tells them that Isabella's father, Pedro Martinez, runs a store south of Virginia City and Rosita Martinez was a saloon dancer in San Francisco. Ben gives him the money and says there's more, if Smith will say that in court. Smith says he'll be around.

Adam and Ben are headed into town when they find Smith's body on the side of the road. It adds validity to Smith's claims.

At the hotel, Ben and Adam go to talk to Isabella. Isabella runs out of her room and into Adam's arms as she tries to escape from Sanchez. Sanchez just laughs it off as a lover's quarrel. They take Isabella back into her room and Isabella begs Adam to believe that Sanchez attacked her. He just walks past her and stands by the fireplace. Ben asks her about Smith's story. She admits that she is Rosita, but she is also Isabella. Her parents were killed by Indians and she was sold to Pedro Martinez. When she was old enough she escaped and went to San Francisco. Years later, Luga found her there and told her who she really was. She still refuses to withdraw her claim and Ben keeps pressing her until she's crying. Adam tells him to stop, this isn't getting them anywhere.

Ben sends Adam to find Martinez. If he can't disprove Isabella's story then Adam should do whatever he thinks is best.

Sanchez finds Adam in the stables and says Isabella sent him. Adam doesn't believe that. Sanchez pulls a knife and they fight. Adam manages to push Sanchez into a stable, where the riled horse stomps Sanchez to death.

Adam finds Pedro Martinez (Salvador Baguez) in a drunken sleep. Adam wakes him and asks about Rosita. Martinez is pleased she remembers him. He says a year ago a man came by asking for her. The man bought him whiskey. Adam wants to hear something new. Martinez says that five years ago Dona Theresa Esperanza came looking for her grand-niece Isabella de la Cuesta. She came from Mission San Jose. Adam gives him some money and leaves.

The judge (Ned Wever) stops by the Ponderosa and says he can't put off a decision any longer. Ben begs for time for his sons to return. The judge refuses and calls the hearing for the next day.

Hoss and Joe return just as the hearing is beginning. The land grant is strong and valid. Ben again asks for a delay until Adam can return. Luga insists they continue, but Isabella says she doesn't mind waiting for Adam. If he has something pertinent to the case, they shouldn't be afraid to hear it. The judge delays one day.

Adam arrives the next day with a very elderly woman, Dona Theresa Esperanza (Celia Lovesky). She is Isabella's sole remaining relative, which means Luga is not Isabella's uncle. Theresa says she can identify Isabella. Luga and Isabella clearly know and dislike each other. Isabella says Luga approached her about backing a scheme of his to reclaim the de la Cuesta land. Luga says she can't possibly identify Isabella since she hasn't seen her since Isabella was a child. Theresa assures them all that she'll know Isabella. She looks at Isabella and comments on the tilt of her head and the way Isabella carries herself. But, she asks to speak to Isabella alone. Luga is reluctant, since Theresa's comments seem to support his claim, but Isabella also insists.

When everyone is gone, Isabella almost pleads to know if there is a way to know for certain. Theresa asks what Isabella wants, to be rich? To be a great lady? Isabella gets defensive. What's wrong with that? Theresa says the greatest trait of the de la Cuesta's was their generosity and they would never take the land away from people who'd worked it. Isabella says it must have been an interesting ride with Adam.

Isabella calls everyone back in and says she knows who she is. She is Rosita Moralez. Luga calls her a fool and starts to shake her. Adam puts his arm protectively across Rosita as the sheriff drags Luga away. Rosita starts to leave and Adam asks where she's going. She says she's going back to San Francisco where she belongs and she walks out, head held high. The judge apologizes to Theresa for being forced to participate in the unveiling of this impostor. Theresa asks what makes him think she's an impostor."

Ben politely tells him to leave. Jeb asks for permission, he's willing to pay. Ben doesn't want the money, he wants Jeb and his sheep to go. Jeb starts to get a little angry and puts his hand on his rifle. Adam, Hoss, and Joe all pull their guns. Jeb backs down and asks if he can camp out for the night. Ben sighs, but agrees.

The next morning, Jeb has decided he's not leaving. He tells his young herdsman, Billy (Ray Daley) that they're going to take the land. He wants Billy to take two men and watch for the Cartwrights. They're to kill the first man they see. Billy can't believe Jeb would kill a man for no reason. Jeb explains that they have to take what they want and the Cartwrights would kill them if given the chance. He also claims the Cartwrights are no different from the men that tried to hang Billy when Jeb first found him. Jeb saved Billy's life when he would've been wrongly hanged for a horse thief. Billy (at least til now) has been grateful to Jeb and has always respected him, so he does as he's told.

Billy, Collier (Ken Lynch), and Wheeler (Jerry Oddo) take up a position. Wheeler would rather just scare the Cartwrights. Collier knows the Cartwrights aren't the kind that scare. Billy doesn't want to face Jeb's wrath and tells them to shoot to kill because that's what Jeb said to do.

Adam comes up on Wheeler and Collier just as the two have decided to quit Jeb. Adam, gun drawn, orders them to drop their guns. Wheeler spins with rifle in hand. Adam shoots him. Collier rides away. Adam checks on Wheeler and just sighs that it came to this.

Collier returns to Jeb and tells him that Wheeler is dead. Jeb is angry that Collier didn't kill Adam, but he has a plan. He just needs to get the herd into a draw.

Ben is furous that Jeb didn't leave. Adam thinks they should get the sheriff and let the law handle it. Ben says that by the time the courts settled it, the sheep would have torn up the north pasture. It's his land that he cleared and planted and he'll protect it from people like Drummond. He tells the boys to get their guns. Adam reluctantly joins them.

Jeb has the herd in the draw. Billy's confused because they'll be the ones trapped in the draw, not the Cartwrights. Jeb sends Collier and some other men to watch from a ledge. He tells Billy to go hide near the entrance to the draw. Collier's worried the Cartwrights will shoot them all down in the draw, but Jeb knows Ben's not the type to shoot unless shot at. All he wants to do is capture a Cartwright alive and that'll be Billy's job. Billy doesn't like the idea, but Jeb again reminds him of how he saved Billy from hanging and that the Cartwrights would shoot them if given a chance.

The Cartwrights arrive at the draw and are suspicious. Adam says they could just hold their ground and starve Jeb out. Joe would rather ride in and get it over with. Ben doesn't want all four riding straight in as easy targets. He sends Hoss and Joe one way while he and Adam will approach from the front. Adam tries one last time and says they can hold Jeb off while he goes back for the sheriff. Ben again refuses. If they can't fight for their land, they might as well hand it over to the first settler that comes along.

Ben and Adam approach. Ben calls to Jeb and tells him to leave or Ben will starve them out. Jeb acts apologetic and asks to stay the night again. Ben refuses. Jeb tells his men to start moving the herd. Ben tells Adam to help them and Adam moves forward. As soon as he's clear, Billy jumps him and everyone else starts shooting.

Ben takes cover behind a rock with Hoss, but is determined to get to Adam. Hoss worries that Ben won't make it, but Ben says, ""Adam's in there. I'll make it."" Meanwhile, Billy and Adam are fighting. Adam makes a break (with Ben's urging) but he runs out of room. Billy's right behind him, but his gun is jammed. Now Adam has the upper hand. But rather than shoot Billy, Adam tells him to get out of the way. Billy's surprised and asks if Adam isn't going to shoot him. Adam just tells him to move. Billy can't move, Jeb told him to capture Adam, so the two just shove each other. Then Jeb comes up with his gun and holds it on Adam. He tells Ben to stop shooting or he'll kill Adam. Billy is stunned, but remains silent. Ben asks what Jeb wants. Jeb cackles in his victory. He's going to cross the Ponderosa with his flock and if Ben tries to stop him it'll cost Adam's life. Ben hasn't got a choice, but threatens, ""If you harm him. I'll find you and I'll kill you if I have to follow you clear to Hell.""

Back at the house, Ben is blaming himself for Adam's predicament. Hoss and Joe assure him that they would've done the same things Ben did, but now they know better. Ben admits Adam was right, but when Hoss suggests that next time they'll let the law handle things, Ben is upset. He doesn't want to go begging for help. Hoss says it isn't begging, it's asking for help from someone who's job it is to protect them. Joe agrees that normally he'd rather fight their own battles, but this time they have Adam. Ben tells Joe to get the sheriff.

At the camp, Jeb's decided he doesn't want to just cross the Ponderosa, he wants the land for himself. Billy asks how he's going to do that. Jeb gestures to Adam who's bound. He says that if you get a man in his soft spot, you can squeeze anything out of him.

Billy takes Adam some food. He asks why Adam didn't shoot him when he had the chance. Adam just says he couldn't. Adam asks how Billy came to be with Jeb. Billy explains that he's been on his own for a while and foolishly bought a horse from a man without getting a bill of sale. The real owner accused him of stealing it and was going to hang him when Jeb arrived and drove off the men. He owes Jeb. Adam says that doesn't mean he has to be like Jeb. Besides, doesn't Billy realize Jeb only does things that benefit him. He wasn't saving Billy to save him, but for his own purposes. Billy slaps Adam. He figures Adam can't understand because the Cartwrights have so much, but all Billy has is Jeb.

The next day, Ben and Hoss ride out to meet Jeb as he's driving his herd. Adam is tied up in the back of a wagon. Ben isn't carrying a gun and Billy takes Hoss'. Ben offers himself in Adam's place. Jeb doesn't care, what he wants is the Ponderosa. He tells Ben to sign over 50,000 acres or he'll kill Adam. Adam tells Ben not to do it, ""It isn't worth it."" Ben answers, ""Isn't it?"" and signs the paper. Billy is stunned. Jeb is jubilant. Adam leaps off the wagon and tackles Jeb, but his hands are tied and Ben and Hoss don't have guns, so the rebellion is short-lived. Billy holds a gun on Adam and Jeb is mad. He wants the gun so he can shoot them all. Billy refuses. The Cartwrights haven't done anything to be killed for. Jeb angrily tells him that you have to take what you want. Still Billy keeps the gun. Jeb complains that he should've let the men hang Billy for taking the three horses. Billy never told Jeb that the men were looking for three horses and now realizes it was Jeb that originally stole them. He didn't kill the men to save Billy, he killed them so they wouldn't catch Jeb. He doesn't owe Jeb anything. So as Jeb moves forward, Billy pulls the trigger.

As Billy is leaving the Ponderosa, Ben offers him some land to homestead."

They're headed into town for a dance, but Dave offers to help stack hay. He's using the pitchfork to toss the hay up to Hoss when a man rides in with a rifle and orders Dave not to move. He's U.S. Marshal Emmett Dowd (Claude Akins). He accuses Dave of being a murderer and is taking him back to California. Dave turns, still holding the pitchfork, and Dowd knocks him to the ground.

The boys are explaining to Ben what happened and defending Dave. Dowd isn't bothered. He's quietly angry and confident. Since Dowd has the proper paperwork and authority, there's nothing Ben can do and Dowd takes Dave to Virginia City in cuffs. The Cartwrights decide they have to do something to help Dave.

The next morning, Ben wires a lawyer friend in Los Angeles asking him to defend Dave. Hoss arrives from visiting Dave in jail and says Dave is all beat up. The Cartwrights hurry over to find Dave bruised and beaten. The deputy (Tom Greenway) says he wasn't on duty at the time, but Dowd returned later and did this. Ben doesn't understand since Dave was cooperating. He asks if Dave did anything to provoke it. Dave peers up at Ben through his black eye and asks if Ben thinks Dowd needed any provocation. Adam tells Dave about the lawyer in L.A., but Dave doesn't think Dowd will let him get to L.A. alive.

The Cartwrights arrive at the hotel to confront Dowd just as he's checking out. But Dowd isn't intimidated and leaves the hotel. An Austrian couple, father and daughter, are planning on taking the same stage as Dowd, but Dowd told them they couldn't go. They ask Adam if that's the case. Adam admits that a prisoner will be traveling and perhaps they should wait. But they have a boat connection to make and still plan to go.

As Dowd pushes Dave onto the stage, Adam and Hoss decide they'll ride along too, just to make sure everything goes well. Dowd doesn't like it, but he can't commandeer a public stage. He does order the boys to give up their guns, which are locked in the strong box by the driver (Bud Osbourne) and Dowd takes the key. The Straussers, Anton (John Wengraf) and Andrea (Fintan Meyler), also insist on going.

Inside the stage, Andrea is bothered by the treatment Dave is receiving. Dowd doesn't care. He says Dave is a murderer and needs to be chained. Dave has given up hope and tells them not to argue with Dowd about it, ""I'm finished anyway."" This distresses Andrea even more.

The stage pulls up at a watering hole and there's a young rider waiting. Hurd Cutler (Ron Hayes) says his horse came up lame and he'd like to ride along in the stage. Again, Dowd doesn't like it and believes he saw Hurd while in Virginia City. Hurd denies being in town and says he's headed to California. Dowd forces him to give up his gun too before riding on.

At the way station for the night, Dowd takes over. He orders the Straussers to sleep in the manager's room, much to Micah Bailey's (Will Wright) disapproval, and for the men to sleep in the parlor. He also takes Micah's gun and keys.

At dinner, Dave and Dowd sit separately from the others. Andrea is concerned that Dave's not eating, though she can understand why. Her father quietly tries to hush her, but she continues. Dave tells her about his childhood and broken home. He says he tried to stay in one place for as long as he could and now it looks like that'll happen. Adam reminds him that the trial hasn't happened yet. But Dave pessimistically points out that a lot can happen between now and the trial. Dowd calls an end to the evening and sends everyone to bed. When everyone is gone, Dave starts taunting Dowd. He asks how long it's been since Dowd slept and Dowd says it's been a year. Dave starts to whistle a tune which clearly irritates Dowd. Dave says the song's about a woman named Corrie who died. Dowd hits Dave very hard twice.

Dowd, who dozed off in the middle of the night, gets up to check things. He peeks into the parlor and hears Hoss whispering to Adam. Hoss says Hurd isn't there. Dowd goes out to the barn and finds Hurd readying his horse. Hurd releases all the horses at once and they stampede out of the barn charging over Dowd. Hurd comes out and throws a pitchfork at Dowd on the ground. Dowd fires and kills Hurd. Adam and Hoss have come out at the noise and Adam accuses Dowd of murdering Hurd. Dowd claims Hurd was Dave's accomplice.

Anton Strausser is a doctor and he's bandaged Dowd up, but Dowd is badly injured. Adam has no sympathy for him and claims suspicion has rotted Dowd's mind. Dowd insists that Hurd came to help Dave escape. Andrea tells him that they just wanted him to show Dave some compassion. Dowd can't. Dave is responsible for Dowd's killing of his wife. Dave told Cora a sad tale and she felt sorry for him and released him. Then he threw her into Dowd's line of fire and Dowd accidentally shot Cora. Adam isn't convinced and turns to leave, but Dowd calls him back. He says Adam has to take Dave into L.A. since he's unable to now. He hands Adam his marshal badge. Adam doesn't want it. Dowd says it's Adam's duty. Adam takes the badge and leaves the room.

He shows it to Dave, who's still cuffed to the cot in the dining room. Dave can't believe it, but is glad because now Adam can release him. Adam refuses to do that, even though he hasn't decided to wear the badge. He hears someone outside and goes out to find Hoss returning with one of the runaway horses. He takes his frustration out on Hoss. Hoss just goes back into the night to look for the other horses. Adam stays outside trying to decide what to do.

Inside, Andrea talks with Dave. He's confused and doesn't understand why Adam, his friend, would treat him this way. Andrea doesn't know either and calls him David for the first time. He says he likes the way she says his name and tells her that he's innocent. She believes him and he kisses her. He appeals to her to release him. All she has to do is take the keys out of Dowd's coat pocket. She's reluctant and he plays on her emotions saying someone like him doesn't deserve to ask for help. She agrees to help him and he kisses her again.

Andrea goes into the parlor and takes the keys from Dowd's coat. She doesn't realize Dowd is awake and knows what she's done. She returns and unchains Dave. She's pleased that he's free, but he says he's not free with Dowd around. He's going to give Dowd a taste of his own treatment and starts gathering up the chains. Andrea is shocked, but Dave says ""I killed his wife didn't I? He's not going to forget that.""

Adam has made a decision and returns to the cabin. He tells Dave not to move. Dave hunkers down behind Andrea using her as a shield. He says if Adam shoots, Adam will have to kill Andrea first. Adam asks if that's what happened with Dowd's wife. Then Dave remembers Adam doesn't have a gun. He charges Adam and they tumble outside. Adam starts beating Dave, even though Dave is down. He doesn't stop until Dowd, with his rifle, orders him to. Adam asks why Dowd suddenly cares. Dowd says Dave has to get to the trial. Adam reminds Dowd that he would've killed Dave himself if he and Hoss hadn't been around. Dowd doesn't deny that saying he's thought of little else for a year, but says he didn't realize what he'd turned into until he saw Adam."

He and his associate enter the office of the Territorial Enterprise where the editor, Dennis (Arthur Shields) and Joe are proof reading an article. The stranger says he received a copy of the paper in New Orleans and it mentioned Ben Cartwright. He describes Ben and says Ben has two sons. Dennis corrects him and Joe steps forward to introduce himself. He asks what interest the man has in Ben. The man merely wants to know where Ben is. Dennis proudly says that Ben's in Siver City at a reception in his honor. They're grooming him for the governorship. The man reads the article's headline: Nevada and Ben Cartwright, a Great Future Together. The man crumples the paper and says Ben has no future. Joe grabs the man's arm and asks what he meant by that. The man merely tells Joe to tell Ben that Charles LaDuque (Lloyd Nolan) is at the hotel. Joe reaches for him again, but the associate, Cole (Hal Baylor) slugs Joe so hard he crashes across the room. LaDuque says they'll smash Ben as easily as he smashed the story of Ben's life.

Joe goes to the hotel and up to LaDuque's room. He wants revenge on Cole, but Cole isn't there. Joe asks why LaDuque is interested in Ben. LaDuque says he'll spare Joe the ugly details of the story. But he comments that Joe looks a lot like his mother. He says he was good friends with her. Joe, as always, is defensive of his mother and tells LaDuque to leave her out of it. His ""ugly story"" couldn't have been aobut her. LaDuque says it involves Ben. Joe calls him a liar. LaDuque challenges him to ask Ben about him. He's a police inspector from New Orleans and he's here to arrest Ben after 20 years. The charge is murder.

When Ben and Adam return home, Joe tells him that some strangers said some things about Ben that he didn't like. Ben's not concerned until Joe mentions LaDuque's name. He immediately goes to town.

Cole lets Ben into LaDuque's room and LaDuque comments on Ben being considered for govenrnor. Ben merely says he has good friends. LaDuque responds that a policeman doesn't have the chance to gain family, friends, and admiration. He's clearly blaming Ben for something. He reminds Ben that he's been handicapped by a shattered knee cap that he got in the investigation of the murder of Simon LaRouche. Ben remembers. Ben reminds LaDuque that he was cleared of those charges when three witnesses came forward asserting it was self-defense. Ben did run from the inspector, but he offered to return until he learned the charges were dropped. LaDuque says Ben has no proof of that and produces a warrant for Ben's arrest. Ben wants to know why LaDuque is doing this after 20 years. LaDuque says Ben escaped him and in the scuffle LaDuque shot himself in the knee. Ben won't take responsibility for that since LaDuque was trying to kill him and he was unarmed. Of course he tried to run. But LaDuque does hold him responsible. Ben isn't overly concerned, the warrant isn't valid in Nevada. LaDuque threatens to expose the story of Marie and LaRouche. Ben glares at him and walks out.

Ben goes over to the Enterprise and dictates his withdrawl from consideration for governor.

When Ben tries to explain to the boys why he withdrew, Joe knows he's not telling them everything. Ben simply says that he loved Marie and she took Adam and Hoss as her own. But LaRouche came into their lives and threatened to expose Marie. Joe wants to know what he could reveal. Ben tries to sidestep the issue, but Joe is insistant. Ben only says that LaRouche wanted to ruin Marie's reputation. What she did or did not do in her past was of no importance to him. He loved her and she was a wonderful person. But Marie didn't want to bring scandal to her family, so she paid LaRouche's blackmail until Ben found out. He confronted LaRouche. There was a fight, LaRouche pulled a knife and Ben killed him. Joe's angry at LaDuque for bringing this all up now and wants to go to town to deal with it. Ben makes him promise not to harm LaDuque.

Joe angrily tells LaDuque that Ben told him everything and if LaDuque drags his mother's name through the dirt, Joe will kill him. Cole steps in and says Joe will have to kill him first. Joe thinks that might be the best part. They fight. Cole pulls a gun, but Joe is faster and kills Cole. LaDuque says Joe just provided him the opportunity to tell Marie's story at Joe's trial because he's not going to vouche for Joe's self-defense. Joe hears people coming down the hall and runs. LaDuque takes Cole's gun and puts it in the holster. He tells the arriving crowd that Joe shot Cole in cold blood.

Sheriff Brady (Robert Foulk) comes to the Ponderosa and tells Ben that Joe killed Cole and LaDuque says it was in cold blood. Hoss knows Joe wouldn't do that, but Brady says he has to bring Joe in. Ben knows Joe will come home and asks to be allowed to bring Joe in himself.

Ben finds Joe sitting at Marie's grave. He was waiting for Ben so he could say good bye. Ben says Joe's not going anywhere and asks what really happened and why he ran. Joe knows he wouldn't stand a chance with LaDuque as the only witness. Ben tells him that Marie begged Ben to stand trial even though her story would come out, but Ben didn't. He made a mistake and he can't let Joe do the same. He asks Joe to trust him.

Joe turns himself in. Ben goes to make a deal with LaDuque. He'll return to New Orleans if LaDuque clears Joe. LaDuque makes Ben promise to return with him alone, unarmed, and he won't try to escape. Ben agrees. LaDuque tells Brady he's remembering details now and it was self-defense as Joe says. Ben makes Brady promise not to release Joe until Ben's long out of town. Adam and Hoss doen't like the conditions Ben areed to, but Ben makes them promise to stay behind too.

Their first night on the trail, Ben asks why it took LaDuque 20 years to come for him. LaDuque blames Ben for that. He had to be made an inspector before he could name his own assignments and the physical impairment held him back. Ben again won't take responsibiltiy for the leg injury. He says the leg has really been helpful to LaDuque. It gives him something to blame all his shortcomings on. LaDuque pulls his rifle and yells, ""Stop it or I'll shoot you now!"" This only confirms what Ben suspected. LaDuque has no intention of taking Ben all the way to New Orleans. He asks if it's going to look like Ben was trying to escape. LaDuque only answers, ""You'd like me to say yes so it will give you an excuse to break your word."" Ben says he has no intention of breaking his word, he intends to arrive in New Orleans and he lies down to go to sleep.

The next morning as they're about to mount up, Indians shoot at them. LaDuque shoots back but refuses to give Ben a gun. The Indians are more interested in the horses and leave LaDuque and Ben without horses or water with the heat of the day coming. They start walking.

LaDuque struggles in the heat and Ben offers to help, but LaDuque holds the rifle on him. Ben tells him to shoot, after all he's waited 20 years for it. LaDuque collapses. Ben hauls LaDuque the rest of the way to the next way station and gives him some water. LaDuque wonders why Ben didn't leave him in the desert to die. Ben simply asks the station manager (Hank Worden) when the next eastobund stage is due. LaDuque wants to know where they're going. ""New Orleans"" Ben tells him. LaDuque admits Ben isn't wanted in New Orleans, he was cleared of that murder by everyone but him. He admits he wanted to kill Ben. Ben simply asks the station manager for some food and stands up to wash off. He offers his hand to LaDuque and LaDuque accepts it."

Haas'],"['', '', '']",[],"['deserter', 'unrequited love', 'u.s. army officer', 'house of cards', 'escaped prisoner']",[],"Three army prisoners have escaped Ft Dayton. Mertz (James Parnell) still has chains around his wrists. Of the three, he's the big, dumb, strong one. Paul Tyler (Grant Williams) is trying to use a rock to break through the chains. He's not having any luck. The third escapee, Sutton(Joe Maross), leans against a rock complaining. He chastises Mertz for having killed the guard on the escape. He says they'll never get the chain off with rocks. Mertz says maybe the friend Sutton's taking them to will have a chisel. ""Sure, we'll tell her you always go around wearing chains."" Tyler is surprised to find out they're heading to a woman's house. Adam, who's out looking for strays, hears them talking and goes to investigate. Unfortunately, they overpower him and he's knocked out.

A soldier patrol from Ft Dayton arrives at the Ponderosa. Capt Bolton (Chris Alcaide) knocks on the door and introduces himself. Ben invites him in and introduces Hoss and Joe. Both hold their hands out to greet him, but Bolton ignores them completely stepping into the room and looking around. Bolton explains that Fort Dayton is a casuals post for troops deemed not fit for line duty. He says he's looking for three deserters who escaped from the stockade. He says their trail ends on the Ponderosa. Joe tells him that he was riding line and didn't see anything. Bolton can't believe Joe saw no tracks or campfires or any indication. Ben says three men could easily lose themselves on the Ponderosa. Capt Bolton wants to know who else is in the house and marches farther into the room. Ben tells him there's just them and Hop Sing. He resents the innuendo that he might be harboring the fugitives. Bolton says, ""Then you'll have no objection to my men searching the area."" But Ben does mind. He stops Bolton by standing in front of him at the foot of the stairs and says again, the men are not in his house. Bolton says they know the men are in the area and they had to get assistance. Anyone who helps them will the held and tried for obstructing military justice. Ben doesn't budge. Bolton starts to head for the kitchen when Ben asks Hoss to escort the Capt out. Hoss is happy to comply. Just then, a soldier calls out that they have a man. They rush outside and the soldiers have Adam, who staggered in without his coat and gun. He's bleeding from a head wound. He says some men bushwhacked him just west of where he and Joe split up. The Capt asks if he saw the men's faces. Adam shakes his head no and they take him inside.

Ben and Joe will go looking for the men, since Joe knows the area Adam was in. The Capt believes it's the prisoners and wants to go search. Ben says it's his land and his son who was hurt. If Bolton wants to come along, ""You'll ride where I say and behind me. Otherwise take your men and get off the Ponderosa."" Bolton's not thrilled with it, but he doesn't really have a choice.

The three prisoners, Sutton wearing Adam's coat and Tyler carrying his gun, stop near a small cave. Sutton's trying to get his bearings. They're headed for Netta's house. Mertz tumbles into a prickly bush and cries out. Sutton tells him to be quiet and they start to fight. Tyler orders them to stop. Sutton reminds him that Tyler's not an officer any more and can't give orders. But he doesn't really understand Tyler. Tyler only had six months left on his sentence, so he doesn't know why Tyler didn't just stick it out. Tyler merely says he had his reasons. Sutton tells Mertz he can't go to the farm with chains, so he'll have to wait there for them. Tyler agrees and promises Mertz they'll come back for him.

Ben, Joe and the patrol have followed the tracks. They find Mertz in the cave. Bolton demands to know where the others are, but Mertz is silent. Bolton backhands him and Mertz says he doesn't know where the others went. Bolton starts to hit him again, but Ben stops him. Bolton reminds Mertz of ""the box"" and has Mertz dragged away. Mertz struggles saying he'd rather die than go back in the box. Bolton pulls his gun as he trips Mertz then takes aim. Ben pulls him off. Bolton claims the prisoner tried to escape, but Ben says Bolton tried to murder a man and he intends to tell the captain's commanding officer.

Tyler and Sutton have made it to Netta's barn. A young foul lies weak in the hay and Tyler goes to it. Sutton starts to clean up and wonders if Bolton is still looking for them. He figures the brass will give up eventually. Tyler puts on a clean shirt and asks if Netta will be waiting for Sutton. Sutton's sure she will be, they were real friendly. They hear a noise and take cover. It's Netta (Gloria Talbott) who puts a warm blanket over the colt. Sutton comes up behind her. At first she's frightened, but when she realizes who it is, she's glad to see him. Sutton introduces Tyler and says he left the army and they're prospecting together. She says she hadn't heard from him in two years and thought he'd forgotten about her. He assures her that she's the only thing that kept him going. He asks about her father, but she tells him that he died.

Ben complains to Colonel Metcalf (Dayton Lummis) about Bolton. The Col says Bolton claims Mertz was trying to escape. Ben asks if they talked to Mertz. The Col says Mertz is dead. Bolton comes in and defends his actions as being by Army regulation. Ben doesn't know of any regulation for the killing of men. The Col says he has to stand with Bolton. Ben understands and leaves. The Col warns Bolton not to step out of line. Bolton asks to go back to the Ponderosa to continue the search. He's acquired a warrant, so the Col lets him go.

At breakfast, there's a knock on Netta's door. Sutton tells her not to let anyone know they're there. He explains that they just hit a big silver strike and they want to keep it a secret. Hoss is at the door and tells Netta that two prisoners escaped from the fort and are in the area. She acts a little nervous and doesn't invite Hoss in. He thinks it's a bit odd, but leaves. When she returns to the kitchen, Sutton is holding a gun. Now she's suspicious. She asks outright if they're the men the army is looking for. Sutton admits they are, but it's not his fault. He was framed. He tried to serve his time, but the captain is a sadist and he beats men down. He couldn't stay. He says Tyler was held in a sweat box for three weeks. Tyler, who hasn't liked all the lies, admits that's true. Sutton begs for her help and she allows them to stay.

After Hoss reports Netta's behavior, the Cartwrights decide they better go back and check things out.

Tyler and Netta are caring for the colt and Tyler tells her that he was raised with horses. He trusts them and wishes he could say the same for people. He takes off his shirt to clean up and she sees the scars across his chest. She's horrified that he'd be treated that way. He says not to worry about it, he's not worth it. She says she's only known him a little while, but she thinks he's worth it. Ben comes in and Tyler grabs a board to swing at him, but Ben has a gun. Sutton comes in behind Ben and when Ben turns, Tyler hits him with the board. Tyler and Netta drop down beside Ben and Tyler's worried he hit Ben too hard. Sutton realizes Ben knows who they are and cocks his gun to shoot him. Tyler grabs Ben's gun and stops Sutton. Sutton thinks Tyler's crazy. He'll wind up back with Bolton. Tyler asks where Sutton's going to go now. Sutton doesn't know, but he's not staying. He starts to leave the barn, but sees Hoss and Joe outside. He returns and claims he can't leave without Netta. Netta doesn't want to go with him. Hoss and Joe come in and take over and help Ben up. The men refuse to go back, they just want a break. Netta says she's seen the scars and also asks Ben for help. Ben says it's an army matter and takes the men's dogtags. He's going to go talk to the Col. Tyler says if Bolton comes for them, no matter what it takes, he won't go back.

Ben is stopped by Bolton and his men. They find the dogtags and know he's seen the men. Ben refuses to say where, but they know the direction he was coming from.

Back in the barn, Tyler and Netta still tend to the colt. Tyler says he wouldn't have given the colt much of a chance last night. Netta says last night she might not have thought Tyler was worth saving. ""What makes you think I am now?"" he asks. She replies that he saved Ben's life. Hoss asks what landed Tyler in the stockade. Tyler says he refused to obey orders. He was to take his small unit and attack a much larger band of Indians. It was suicide, so he didn't do it. He didn't know it at the time, but he was the diversionary attack and because he didn't do his job, many other soldiers were killed in the frontal assault. Netta doesn't think he should be punished for refusing a suicide mission, but Hoss says the Army usually knows what they're doing. She challenges, did they know what they were doing when they put those scars on Tyler. Joe says not to judge the whole army by Bolton. Sutton insists that's what they're being sent back to. All they want is a chance to get out the back. Joe tells him to be quiet. Sutton tries a different tactic claiming Netta will feel horrible seeing him being dragged away. She's waited two years for him. Netta doesn't answer and Sutton is suddenly suspicious of her feelings for Tyler. Tyler doesn't like the insinuation and there's a brief scuffle. As Joe and Hoss try to break it up, Sutton gets a gun. He holds the gun on Joe and threatens to kill him if Hoss makes a move. Hoss assures him, ""You do that mister and all the bullets in that gun, ain't gonna keep me from squeezing the life outta you."" Sutton takes Hoss' guns and leaves the barn.

He's about to take Joe's horse when he hears riders coming. He takes cover. He starts to sneak away and climb over a fence when Bolton shoots him in the back. Netta asks Hoss and Joe to tell Bolton that Tyler is unarmed and giving himself up. As soon as they leave, she begs Tyler to run out the back. He refuses. Bolton would shoot them both down and now he's got something to live for. Hoss and Joe tell Bolton that Tyler is unarmed, but when Tyler comes out, Bolton orders him to drop his gun. Tyler raises his hands and Bolton orders him again to drop his gun and then he takes aim. Ben shoves him and the shot misses Tyler. Sutton, who's been lying on the ground left for dead, rises up and uses his last bit of strength to shoot Bolton. The other soldiers shoot Sutton and Netta runs into Tyler's arms. Ben tells the Corporal (Sherwood Price) to take Tyler back to the fort. Netta promises to wait for him."

Hawkins' men are in town to make sure it happens.

Hoss and Joe ride up to the jail and tell Ben that they found Duece Martin, a witness. He's dead. He fell or was pushed from a cliff. Sheriff Hansen (Robert Griffin) reminds them that Duece gave a statement immediately after the murder. Joe counters with the fact that Duece then left town and now he's dead. Ben tells Hoss and Joe to do three things: 1. Go talk to the only surviving witness Sally Byrnes (Jean Allison). 2. Stop by the paper. Mr. Baxter (Ian Wolfe) is running a special edition that will make people think. 3. Find Barney Arden (Robert Brubaker) and help him get names for the petition to the governor.

A stranger rides into town. He takes his horse to the livery. The liveryman, Zeke Jackson (Dan White) asks where the man is from. He says he's from Lassiter, Kansas. Zeke recalls that was the town attacked by raiders and burned. Lassiter (Vic Morrow) merely asks about the hanging scaffold. Is the hanging coming or been. Zeke tells him it's set for 6:00 that night. After Zeke takes the horse away, Hoss and Joe come through and Joe bumps into Lassiter. Joe's ready for a fight, but Lassiter won't take the bait and Hoss calms Joe down. After Lassiter leaves, Hoss and Joe take out their hidden rifles and hide them in the stable.

Lassiter goes to the cafe for supper. Only the owner, Sally Byrnes is there. While she's getting his dinner, he notices her calendar. The days up to today are crossed out and today, April 26, is circled. When she returns he asks why the town is so empty. She says the people are afraid to see the Cartwrights hang. He says he noticed she was counting the days. Hoss and Joe come in. They tell Sally that Duece is dead and now she's the only witness against Ben and Adam. She isn't intimidated and says she told what she saw at the trial. Joe grabs her and calls her a liar. Lassiter is immediately there to push Joe off even as Hoss is pulling Joe back. Joe apologizes and says he only wanted Sally to tell the truth. Sally remains determinedly silent and Joe leaves. Hoss asks one more time, politely. Sally tells him that she's not going to lie for him and Hoss leaves resigned. Sally then thanks Lassiter for standing up to the Cartwrights. The only other person she's seen do that is Cy Hawkins. Lassiter asks about the murder. She says Ben and Adam came claiming that her father bought stolen Ponderosa horses. They were out back with Duece. She heard arguing and then the shooting. She's upset and asks him to understand that it was a crazy way to die. Lassiter says he knows the feeling very well.

A young boy, Jimmy (Eugene Martin) comes into the cafe. The sheriff sent him to get stew for the prisoners. Sally's not happy about it, but goes to get it. While they wait, Jimmy notices the way Lassiter sits and wears his hat and gun. He tries to mimic the man. Lassiter plays along for a bit, then goes back to the kitchen. He asks Sally if Lassiter, Kansas means anything to her. It doesn't. He asks if Ben Cartwright is a tall man. She says Ben is big, but wouldn't Lassiter know the name of the man he's looking for. Lassiter says he'll know him when he sees him and heads over to the jail.

When Lassiter looks at Ben, he's disappointed. Ben asks if Lassiter thought the hangman would be doing him a favor. Lassiter says yes and apologizes for bothering Ben. As he's about to leave, Hoss comes in. He tells Ben and Adam that Sally won't change her story. Joe's gone down to the mines because they figure that's where Barney is getting signatures for the petition. Ben's glad to hear it, but reminds Hoss to go to the paper too. Adam recommends he stop at the telegraph office. Maybe Barney's already wired the governor. Before Hoss leaves, Ben makes him promise to do what he can, but to stay within the law. And no matter what, not to take up arms. He doesn't want Hoss and Joe fighting the law and their friends. Hoss promises and leaves. Lassiter overheard all this and returns to the cell area. He says Ben couldn't be more opposite of the man he's looking for.

Lassiter goes to Gil's Saloon and orders a whiskey. Most of Hawkins' men are there. Bert (Harry Swoger) notices the odd way Lassiter wears his gun and teases him about it. Lassiter ignores him, refusing to be provoked. Fred (James Anderson) the leader, asks if Lassiter is a friend of the Cartwrights. Without looking at him Lassiter says he is. Fred asks how long? Lassiter says, ""Maybe ten, fifteen minutes."" Fred says it's a short friendship. Bert wants to make sure that Lassiter doesn't get in their way and gives him a warning. Lassiter ignores him again, which just makes Bert mad and Fred sends him outside to cool down. Lassiter merely asks the bartender (Bern Bassey) if the Cartwrights have any friends. ""Not many,"" he says.

Jimmy is walking back to the jail with his pail of stew when he bumps into Bert coming out of the saloon. When Bert and his buddy Hoag (Bill Catching) discover the meal is for the Cartwrights, they start dumping dirt and a cigar into it. Jimmy's cries bring Lassiter running. He knocks both men aside. Bert falls to the ground and loses his gun. As he reaches to pick it up, Hoss steps on his hand. Fred calls an end to the fight and the men return to the saloon. Jimmy's upset about the stew and Hoss tells him not to worry about it. But Lassiter sends him back to Sally's telling him to finish what he started. Hoss asks who's side Lassiter is on. Lassiter says he thinks the wrong people are in jail in this town. Hoss explains that things couldn't have happened the way Sally said they did. He doesn't think she's lying, but must be mistaken. Ben and Adam were firing at the murderer. Duece could've been coerced, scared or bribed, for his statement. Lassiter asks about the petition and the newspaper. Hoss assures him they'll get enough signatures, especially with the newspaper coming out. Fred overheard this.

Joe runs up. He's suspicious of Lassiter, but Hoss vouches for him. Joe says Barney never went to the mines for signatures. They're going to go look for Barney at his house. Before they go, Lassiter asks, if all else fails, are they planning a small revolution. Hoss just says, ""Yup."" Lassiter asks them to hold off for as long as they can.

Sally is getting Jimmy some more stew and promises that Mr. Hawkins will take care of the men who did this. Jimmy doesn't believe that. Sally explains that Mr. Hawkins can't be responsible for the actions of his men. Lassiter has returned and hears this. He disagrees. ""As a rule, you can usually tell a man by the men around him.""

Fred and Bert go to the newspaper office. The threaten Baxter with cutting him and pouring hot lead on him to stop the printing.

Hoss and Joe find Barney sitting in his dark parlor with his wife and daughter. He says he had to stop getting signatures because Hawkins men threatened his family. Joe accuses him of running and hiding in a house he wouldn't even have if not for Ben. Hoss asks how many signatures he did get. Barney only got five and Hawkins men made him scratch his own name off. Hoss and Joe are disgusted with the cowardice and take the petition themselves. But everyone they approach refuses to sign. They're all afraid of Hawkins and Hawkins men are tailing Hoss and Joe just to add to the fear. Hoss and Joe even go to the saloon. The bartender won't sign either. Joe promises to protect him. Gil knows they mean that, and he knows they will. Every day but one. Bert teases that he'll sign it, but Hoss is in no mood and shoves Bert across the room. He and Joe start to leave. Lassiter bursts in, gun drawn and ready to fire. Hoss and Joe turn to see Bert, still on the floor, but ready to shoot them in the back. All three back out of the saloon and Joe thanks Lassiter for the help.

Next, Hoss and Joe go to the paper, but they find Baxter frozen in fear. They know their time is up and head back to the stables to get their guns.

Hawkins (Richard Devon) finally arrives and checks in with Fred in the saloon. Fred says they put a stop to the petition and the paper. Hawkins notices Bert's bandaged hand and asks about it. Both Fred and Bert wave it off as nothing. There's a stranger in town, but nothing to worry about.

Lassiter goes back to Sally's. Jimmy comes in depressed. He didn't get the stew to the jail in time. They were tying Ben's and Adam's hands and it was too late. Sally consoles him saying he tried. But Jimmy wanted to do something nice for the Cartwrights. Now he'll never get a chance to pay them back. When his parents were sick and nearly died, Mr. Cartwright brought him a horse and said it was a Christmas present, even though it was June. He just wanted to pay Ben back and now he can't. Lassiter assures him that Ben knows and sends the boy home promising everything will be alright. Then he looks out the door and tells Sally she'll have a good view of the hanging. She says she wants them to hang, but that doesn't mean she wants to see it. She goes back to the kitchen. Lassiter says the sound will carry and that's almost as bad as seeing it. He describes it to her and looks out the back window she says she saw the shooting from. It's so dirty she couldn't have seen anything. He thinks Duece told her what happened and she believed him. She argues that she's lost enough. Her pa was killed. ""I thought you were my friend!"" Lassiter says he is her friend and that's why he won't let her do this. He once saw an innocent man hanged and now he's looking for the men who did it. He believes she knows in her heart that the Cartwrights didn't kill her father. She runs from the room.

Ben and Adam are brought out to the scaffolding. They bravely climb the steps. Joe and Hoss are at the stables, rifles ready. Joe wants to start, but Hoss holds him back. They promised to wait to the last minute.

Lassiter is describing things to Sally as he looks out the door. Finally she comes to look too and can't stand the sight of Ben and Adam with the ropes around their necks. She admits that she didn't see it happen. Lassiter tells her to hurry and tell the sheriff. She runs across the street calling to him, calling out the truth. Hawkins tells her to stay out of it. Lassiter realizes that Hawkins is one of the men he's looking for. He asks if Hawkins remembers him from another hanging in Lassiter, Kansas. Hawkins goes for his gun, but Lassiter is faster. A gun fight breaks out and Hoss and Joe shoot some of Hawkins men to protect Lassiter. The sheriff ends it and releases Ben and Adam, then takes the surviving Hawkins men away.

Ben gives Hoss' and Joe's arms a squeeze and Joe teases, ""Aren't you glad we didn't wait til the last minute.""

The next day, as Lassiter is leaving, he meets Sally. She thanks him for not letting her do the wrong thing. ""You made it right"" he tells her. Then he meets the Cartwrights. Ben thanks him and offers him a job on the Ponderosa, now that he's found the man he was looking for. Lassiter says Hawkins was only one and there are more he needs to find. After Lassiter rides away, Ben tells the boys he wouldn't want to be one of the men Lassiter is after."

Whitehead) and Johnny (Robert Nichols) have just delivered a herd to San Francisco. After giving the men a bonus and a reminder that he's buying dinner, Ben sends them off to enjoy the city. Hamp and Johnny promptly get drunk. Out on the street, Johnny says he wants to buy his wife a bolt of silk. A man overhears them and claims he's an importer and they should come with him to see his stock. When they get to a shop near the docks, two thugs knock Hamp and Johnny out. They've just been shanghai'd

Ben's getting a little worried when Hamp and Johnny don't arrive for dinner. Then Hop Sing knocks on the door and reports that his #3 cousin saw two cowboys get hit on the head and dragged away. He thinks it was Hamp and Johnny. The Cartwrights go to check on it.

Cut-rate Joe (Murvyn Vye,) the supposed silk dealer, is really a dealer in shanghai'd sailors. He tells his two thugs that he needs four more men by midnight. He looks down at the two unconscious cowboys and wonders what he can do to make them look more like sailors.

After searching around the Barbary Coast for a while, Ben decides he's going to the police. He warns Hoss and Joe to be careful and tells Hop Sing to stay with them. When he gets to the police station, the sergeant (Stephen Roberts) isn't terribly concerned about the two missing men. He recommends Ben hire more men to replace them. Ben angrily informs him that he'll find his men with or without the police's help. The sergeant merely says, ""Go right ahead,"" and returns to his paperwork.

Hoss, Joe, and Hop Sing aren't having any luck asking about the cowboys. Nobody will tell them anything. They decide to split up and take opposite sides of the streets. Joe thinks Hop Sing should go check with his cousins again. Hop Sing doesn't like the idea of leaving the boys alone, but both say they've heard the Barbary Coast can be fun. They split up. Hoss immediately finds a man even bigger than he is and the two start circling each other sizing each other up. Joe, on the other hand, enters Pig Eye Pete's. He asks the bartender (Herb Vigran) if he's seen two cowboys. Herb isn't helpful either and tells Joe he's too young to be there. Joe starts to protest, but Herb pulls out a big mallet and two thugs (Michael Ross and Don Rhodes) at the end of the bar are paying attention. Joe thinks it's best to leave.

Joe comes out of the bar just as Ben finds him. He's angry that they split up, but they quickly find Hoss, shirtless, ready to fight the big man. They've drawn quite a crowd and with one solid punch, Hoss bring Busthead Brannigan (Tor Johnson) down and wins $100. Ben's angry that Hoss has gotten into trouble, but Hoss assures him he's not. This was a boxing match against the local champion, who he's now trying to revive. Hop Sing rushes up with his Cousin #3 (James Hong). #3 is glad to meet Hoss, cuz Hoss just won him $100. Then Hop Sing warns them that word is up and down the Barbary Coast that they're asking too many questions. Ben says they can't just barge in and act like they're going to tear the place up. He sends Hoss and Joe back to the hotel and keeps Hop Sing and his cousin with him.

Ben also goes into Pig Eye Pete's, leaving Hop Sing and #3 outside to wait. He orders a drink and outrageously compliments the bartender. When he finally asks if Herb has seen his two friends, Herb gives a quick nod to the thugs at the end of the bar. Rhodes walks away to get the boss. Herb stalls. Alexander Pendleton (David White) arrives and escorts Ben to the end of the bar where it's quieter. He says the men were there but they left. At his signal, Herb pulls a handle and a trap door under Ben opens up. He falls into the water below. Herb asks if Pendleton knows what he's doing. He's had enough trouble with the two cowboys he bought from Cut-Rate Joe and now he just dumped their boss. Pendleton says he still needs three more men.

Hop Sing and #3 go back to the hotel and tell Hoss and Joe that Ben went into a bar and never came back. The boys take off.

Ben is led into a room where Hamp and Johnny are also being held. Pendleton, a.k.a Shanghai Pete, brings in Captain Sharp (Richard Deacon) to sell him the new sailors. Sharp peeks through a slot in the door and wants to know why there are only three. Ben offers to pay Pendleton twice whatever the captain is offering. Pendleton is tempted, but the captain says they have a contract and if Pete's wants his future business he'll stick to the contract. Pendleton refuses Ben's offer even when Ben ups it to three times the price. Sharp says that Ben isn't drunk and therefore doesn't want him, but he'll take Hamp and Johnny. He says if Pete doesn't have three more men in an hour, he's going to Cut-Rate Joe's.

Kathleen (Kathleen Crowley) brings Ben some dinner. She's a waitress at Pig Eye Pete's. Ben turns on the charm and asks what a nice girl like her is doing in a place like this. She admits she's considered that question before and has decided it's the money. He offers her $500 if she helps him escape and find his men. She agrees and says she'll be back for him later.

Hop Sing reports that #5 Cousin never saw Ben leave Pig Eye Pete's and to make matters worse, #6 Cousin, who works on the docks, says one ship that was shorthanded now has a crew. He's afraid Mr. Ben now a sailor man. Hoss is ready to bust some heads and marches into Pig Eye Pete's. He demands to know where his pa is. Ross and Rhodes, the two thugs, start to move toward him, but Hoss pulls his gun. Pendleton arrives and assures him that Ben did leave. He calms Hoss down and walks him to the end of the bar. Down the hatch he goes.

A man is waiting below to help Hoss out, but Hoss pulls him in too and starts dunking him to get answers from him. He has a feeling the man was down there waiting for him, dunk. And he thinks he wasn't the only member of his family to come down that hole, dunk. He asks the man if he's seen a man with gray hair, dark eyes and a deep voice. ""I don't remember."" Dunk. ""You better start remembering cuz I'm a cowboy. I ain't no sailor. I like dry land and I can think of one way to get it and that's holding you under til you drink all the water in this place!"" Dunk. The man says he's starting to remember and Hoss says that's good, ""You just took the first step to establishing the basis of a friendship between me and you. Now, where's my pa?""

Kathleen takes the opportunity to get Ben out. She leads him to a ""friend's"" house, but it's really Cut-Rate Joe's and she's Quick Buck Katie. She offers to sell Ben for $100. Ben is stunned, particularly because he offered her $500. She says she knows he'll turn her over to the police. She raises her fee to $150. Cut-Rate Joe refuses and she settles for $75. As she leaves, she assures Ben that he'll see his friends.

Kathleen returns to Pendleton's and reports that she sold Ben to Cut-Rate for $25. Since Capt Sharp already refused Ben, Pendleton thinks it's funny that Cut-Rate will be stuck with him. Besides, he's got an even bigger Cartwright. Hoss enters bashing people as he goes. He hauls Pendleton up over his head and demands to know where Ben is.

Joe is down by the water searching when Hop Sing comes up and reports that Hoss went into the bar and never came out. Right then, the door they're next to bursts open and a man comes tumbling out. Joe goes in to find Hoss beating people up. He joins right in.

Meanwhile, Capt Sharp is telling Cut-Rate that he already refused Ben because he's not drunk. He's a temperance man. But any man who's foolish enough to get drunk deserves whatever happens to him. He will not take a sober man and turns his back. Ben is clubbed and a bottle of whiskey poured over him. Sharp turns around to see Ben staggering and smelling of whiskey. He takes him for $100.

After Hoss has knocked everyone out, Joe demands answers from Kathleen. He has to do some arm twisting, but she finally admits she sold him to Cut-Rate. Hoss is stunned, but wants to know how much she sold him for. Joe drags him away. They go to Cut-Rate's and get more answers. Then Hop Sing reports that #3 Cousin saw Ben being taken aboard a ship.

Ben wakes up next to Hamp and Johnny. They are tied together, but Ben is loose and demands to see the captain. He starts yelling at the captain. Hoss, Joe and Hop Sing are now on the docks and Hoss is glad to hear Ben's voice. And the fight is on. Sailors are going every which way and the Cartwrights and Hop Sing win.

At the hotel, the boys are tending their black eyes and Hoss wants to know how much Kathleen got for Ben. He won't answer. Hop Sing arrives, also with a black eye, and says #7 Cousin is in the silk business and gives a bolt to Johnny. Then he says #9 Cousin is a chef in the hotel and they're going to have a delicious meal. But he'll serve it in the room because he doesn't want them getting into any more trouble. Hoss asks one last time how much Kathleen got for Ben and he just glares at Hoss."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529507/?ref_=ttep_ep29,,"A neighboring rancher, Andy, is good friends with Ben, but his son (Todd) wants to sell their land for mining operations which will spoil the water rights agreement that Andy and Ben made years ago.",[],TV-G,Release date,['George Blair'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Ben and Adam find their neighbor Todd McCarren (Don Dubbins) surveying the property line. Todd says, rudely, that the new owner might be interested in the line. Ben's surprised to hear that Todd's father is thinking of selling. They've had an agreement on water rights ever since Todd's family arrived. Todd doesn't care. He's the one selling the land, not his father. And what the new owner, Len Keith, does to Ben's down stream property isn't Todd's problem.

Ben goes to talk to Todd's father Andy (Rhys Williams). Andy's a friendly man and admits that he did turn the ranch over to Todd since he physically can't keep up, but he assures Ben that Todd won't really sell the land he was raised on. Ben's glad because he always thought the water rights would out last both of them. Todd comes in and accuses Ben of going behind his back. He thinks Ben's there reminding Andy of all their old favors so that Todd won't sell. Andy is upset with Todd's behavior and actually slaps him. Todd storms out. Andy apologizes and says that Todd's future father in law, Len Keith, has Todd thinking there might be silver on the land. Ben doesn't think there's silver there and neither does Andy, but Len's got Todd thinking it might be there.

Todd goes to Len's house. He's engaged to Len's daughter, Virginia (Merry Anders). She greets him, but Todd is anxious to speak to her father. Len (Robert Simon) isn't overly concerned about Ben's involvement, but Todd says Ben is doing Andy's thinking for him. Virginia finds that hard to believe. The Cartwrights have always been decent people. Todd says that's socially, not business.

Later that evening, Len goes to visit Ben and tries to convince him to talk Andy into selling the land, for Todd's sake. Ben says Andy's perfectly capable of making up his own mind and he doesn't see how keeping the land will hurt Todd. On the other had, he's seen Len ruin men before and he doesn't want to see Len hurt Todd too. Len says he always tries reason first, but if that doesn't work there are other ways.

At the dance that night, Todd picks a fight with Adam. Adam tries to walk away, but Todd grabs him and the fight starts. Virginia calls for help and the Cartwrights break it up. Virginia asks her father to take her home and they go outside. Adam follows shortly after to apologize, but Len rushes her off.

At their ranch, Len's foreman, Tucker (Kenneth Becker) is waiting for them and takes Len over to the bunkhouse. Roy (Frank Watkins) is beating another man up. They blame the man for bringing in a herd that is infected with Texas Fever, a highly contagious cattle disease. The only way to keep it from spreading is to kill off the infected cattle and burn them. Len tells Roy to take the man out and see that he doesn't come back, but he tells Tucker not to kill any of the herd yet. He's going to make a gift of them to the Cartwrights.

It doesn't take the Cartwrights long to discover the infected cattle. But rather than killing and burning the cattle, Ben thinks a bath in sulfur soap will rid them of the ticks that spread the disease and maybe they can keep it from spreading further. He tells Hoss to go get as much sulfur as he can. Joe will cut out the cattle that even look sick, while he and Adam dig pits to push the cattle through.

Virginia goes to town and finds Todd in a saloon. He comes out to talk to her and accuses her of siding with the Cartwrights. She doesn't see it that way, but doesn't like the man Todd is becoming. Next she goes to see Andy. She says she thought Todd wanted to treat the land as their future, for themselves and their children. Andy tells her to keep her faith in Todd.

Tucker and Roy have followed Hoss and learned about the sulfur bath idea. They don't know what good it'll do, but figure they should stop it. As Hoss pulls a wagonload of sulfur, they shoot at him. Hoss takes cover and fires back, but Joe comes to the rescue and shoots Roy. Tucker takes off. Neither Hoss nor Joe knows who Roy is, but they find an envelope on him with his name. But since more cattle are getting infected, their first priority is to get the sulfur to the Ponderosa.

Len goes to town and tells Todd, acting all innocent and ignorant, that there's a plague on the Ponderosa cattle. He says two of his men went to offer help and the Cartwrights shot one, obviously to keep things quiet. Todd is legitimately worried and knows the Cartwrights should kill their herd. He also knows they won't. He says the only way to protect the other herds is to do what the Cartwrights won't. He says he'll rally the other ranchers to do what must be done.

The Cartwrights are pushing cattle through the sulfur bath when Hoss rides up with Roy's horse. It's covered with ticks too. Adam goes to town to discover who Roy is. The bartender (Cosmo Sardo) doesn't really know Roy, but he was always with Len's foreman, Tucker.

Adam goes to Len's bunkhouse and finds Tucker. He says he suspects Tucker of being with Roy when Hoss was shot at. Tucker pulls a rifle and Adam shoots him. Adam's shot is only a wound, but a second shot rings out and Tucker is killed. Len shot him and Virginia saw the whole thing. Adam said he wanted Tucker alive to talk, but accuses Len of being a fast thinker. He leaves and Virginia accuses her father of intentionally killing Tucker. Len claims he was protecting Adam.

Todd has a meeting with the ranchers and many are upset about the plague, but a few refuse to go against the Cartwrights. Those that will say they'll meet in the morning with rifles. Virginia arrives as the meeting is breaking up. She asks Todd if he knows how it started. Todd says it doesn't matter, it just can't be allowed to spread. She says she thinks, and Adam agrees, that her father brought the plague to the Ponderosa cattle. Again Todd says it doesn't matter how it started, he has to protect the other herds. She won't believe that. The Cartwrights have always been their friends and what the Cartwrights need is help, not threats. She accuses Todd of doing this to make a big name for himself, not to help the ranchers.

The next morning the ranchers, Todd, and Len ride up to the Ponderosa where the Cartwrights are running cattle through the sulfur bath. Ben tells them that the sulfur is working, but if any of his cattle do become infected he'll kill them himself. Todd is ready for a fight and pulls his gun. Adam hauls him off his horse. Len encourages Todd to shoot and Todd and Adam square off. Virginia and Andy ride up in a wagon and place themselves between the two. Todd tells Virginia to move, but she won't. Andy says if Todd's about to become a killer he can start by killing him. He tells the ranchers that they passed some of the herds and some of their cattle have gotten the fever. He tells Todd that they have to go take care of their own herd. Len says Ben's to blame for this and some of the ranchers want to start killing Cartwright cattle. Ben tells them again that the sulfur dip is working and they're more than welcome to use it for their own cattle. Virginia accuses her father of starting the plague so he could take all their land. Adam backs her and Len goes for his gun. Adam is faster and kills Len.

The Cartwrights run all the local cattle through the sulfur bath, including Todd's herd."

Vance knows the way, but says he has to go to his family first. He promises he'll be back in two days. If he's not, then Pike can take all the money and go.

Vance finds his wife's grave, then finds Billy at the Ponderosa. That night he climbs through the window and Billy is thrilled to see him. Vance makes him promise not to tell anyone he saw Vance. He asks Billy to gather as much food as he can to to meet him at their secret cave the next night.

Because of the prison break, the Cartwrights are asked to ride posse. Only Hoss stays home with Billy. A neighbor and his young son drop by to sign some papers. While Hoss takes Mr. Sherman (John Eldredge) in to sign, Orville (Philip Grayson) talks with Billy. He tells Billy that Vance is nothing but a convict. They fight and Hoss and Sherman break it up. Hoss is sorry he didn't tell Billy sooner and gives him a hug. Billy is sure his father will come and explain everything.

That night, Hoss hears Billy sneaking out and follows him. Billy gives his father the food and after spending some time together, Vance sends him back to the Ponderosa. He says they'll meet again tomorrow and leave. Billy goes back and Vance returns to the cave. Hoss is waiting for him. He has to turn Vance in. Vance won't go and in a brief scuffle, Hoss shoots Vance. His first thoughts are for Billy.

Ben has returned from his posse very early in the morning. Hoss comes up behind him with Vance's body thrown across his horse. He doesn't know how he's going to tell Billy. But Billy sees his father and attacks Hoss hitting him in the chest and crying ""I hate you."" It nearly kills Hoss and Ben gently pulls the boy away.

Later, Hoss is outside feeling terrible. Ben tries to comfort him. Hoss says he can still feel the little fists hitting him. He's so big and strong he can do most anything, but he'd cut off both his hands if it would help the boy. He begs to know why God won't tell him what to say to Billy. Ben says there's nothing he can say. Billy will just have to learn to understand.

Hoss and Billy ride in a wagon, taking the body into town. They stop to rest the horses. Pike is there and threatens to kill Billy if Hoss doesn't show him through the mountains. Hoss attacks Pike and yells for Billy to run. Billy runs, but not far. He hides behind a tree and watches as Pike knocks Hoss over the head with the gun. Then he runs on. The Cartwrights are just coming that way and are surprised to find Billy alone. Billy says Hoss is with the man that was with his father and he hopes the man kills Hoss. Ben is very upset but does his best to explain that Vance loved Billy as a father should. Well, Hoss is his son and he loves him. He pleads with Billy to tell him where Hoss is. Billy does.

Hoss is revived and still refuses to show Pike through the hills. They fight again and the gun goes off between them. Pike is dead. The Cartwrights find Hoss collapsed near the wagon. While they check on Hoss, Billy runs off. When they discover him gone, Hoss goes after him. He finds Billy sitting by the lake. Billy is surprised that Hoss is alive. He asks if his father was like Pike. Hoss tells him that his father loved him and that he came back for Billy. This cheers him and Billy asks to stay at the Ponderosa until his uncle comes. He takes Hoss' hand as they walk back."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529530/?ref_=ttep_ep31,,"While hunting a predator wolf, Little Joe finds a gypsy woman who has been rejected from her people because she is believed to be a witch.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Lewis Allen'],"['', '', '']",[],"['gypsy', 'witch', 'tied up', 'exorcism']",[],"As Joe and Hoss are out tracking a wolf, Joe dismounts and follows the tracks. He spies a young woman lying on the ground. When he approaches, she gets up and runs. She stumbles down a hill and lies unconscious. Hoss joins Joe and they take the young woman, who appears to be a gypsy, home.

The doctor (Grandon Rhodes) has examined her and tells the Cartwrights to give a her night's rest and some food then send her on her way. They don't know where her people are, so the doc suggests they turn her over to the sheriff. When Joe protests that she hasn't done anything, the doc says she will. Joe goes to check on her, but she only wants him to go away. When Joe won't leave, she bites his hand.

That night Joe hears the front door close and looks out his window to see the gypsy girl outside. He joins her and she won't look at him. She points to the North Star and says she wants to take. She talks about the darkness being the inside of a bell that rings forth the spirits of the dead. Joe asks about her people, but she claims she has no one. She asks why Joe cares. Is it because she's pretty? Joe thinks she's strange. She accuses Joe of being a little boy, while she is old, withered, dead. She tells Joe to go away before she turns him into a toad, which just confirms Joe's opinion.

The next day, Ben finds the girl scraping crumbs off the dining room table. He offers her breakfast, but she merely comments that he's a rich man. He agrees he has much to be grateful for and asks about her people. He wants to return her to them. She says they didn't lose her, she's different from them. She can go anywhere, be anything. Ben asks what she'd like to be. She says she wants to be free. Then she grabs the tablecloth and pulls it from the table and runs screaming out the door. Her wild behavior spooks Hoss and Joe's horses. She runs the other way and Joe follows. She stumbles again and Joe drops down beside her. She grabs his gun. He holds her still and asks why she wants to kill herself. ""I'm a witch. It is the dark star.""

Later, the gypsies roll in. Hoss thinks they're making camp, but Ben thinks they've just come for the girl. She comes out and says they haven't come for her. Ben doesn't understand, but intends to take her back. She won't go, so Ben and Hoss go to see the gypsies alone.

The gypsy leader, Zorka (Hugo Haas), wants to camp on the Ponderosa until the sky clears. Ben repeatedly brings up the girl, but Zorka avoids talking about her, but admits she brings misfortune. Ben accuses him of leaving her to die. Zorka says they only left her behind. Ben says they can stay on the Ponderosa if they take the girl with them when they go. Zorka offers to sell Ben some horses. Ben's a good judge of horseflesh and doesn't fall for the gypsies old horses. Although one gypsy is offended that Ben and Hoss have accused them of fixing the horses to look younger, Zorka simply asks them to dinner. They're celebrating All Hallow's Eve. Ben tries to decline, but Zorka insists and tells Ben to bring the pig. Ben still refuses and Zorka accepts it. Ben reminds him to leave when the weather clears and with the girl.

Joe finds the girl by a pool of water and finally learns her name, Tirza (Susan Harrison). She starts talking crazy again and Joe asks what she meant about the dark star and why she tried to kill herself. After some more talk about wanting to be a fish, she finally says it's because she's a witch. A gypsy man rides up, Spiro (Arthur Batanides). Joe introduces himself, but Spiro tells him to go run his kingdom. He apologizes to Tirza saying he didn't know she was left behind. He might've been able to stop it. She accuses, ""And all you'd want for that service is to hold me in your arms for all the nights that are to come."" He tries to kiss her. Joe comes to her rescue and there's a brief fight. Spiro pulls a knife, so Joe pulls his gun. Spiro warns Joe that it's his face that will be the last one Joe sees, but leaves.

At dinner, Hoss comes in and reports a missing pig. Ben intends to make Zorka pay for the pig. Hoss and Joe think watching Ben negotiate with Zorka will be great fun, but Adam says he'll stay home in case the gypsies pull a wagon up to the house and walk out with all the furniture.

Zorka offers to pay for the pig with a silver bowl which is much more valuable than the pig. Ben has to refuse that, but Zorka offers him to at least enjoy some pork. While eating, Ben asks why they think Tirza is a witch. Zorka says she was born under a dark star and can turn herself into a wolf. While they're talking Tirza comes in and starts dancing. Joe's enthralled, as is Spiro. But then lightning flashes and everyone is afraid. Tirza runs off and Joe follows. Zorka warns Ben not to let Joe go after her, but Ben knows Joe can take care of himself.

Joe catches up to Tirza by a large rock. Joe asks why she came to dance in camp and she says she likes to see the fear in their faces. He assures her she's not a witch. She says Joe is a tree with his feet firmly planted in the ground. She'd like to be a tree and spread her branches out to protect the children. She asks if Joe thinks she's beautiful. He kisses her. Spiro has also followed them and witnesses this. He raises his rifle and takes aim. But a wolf howls and he leaves.

Tirza wakes up in her bed at the Ponderosas. There are chicken feathers and bloody wolf prints on her bed. She runs to Zorka and begs him to help her. He tells her it will be quite painful, but she wants to be like the others.

Tirza didn't close the front door when she ran and it bangs shut waking Joe. He investigates and finds her gone so he goes to the gypsy camp. Only Spiro is there. Spiro tells him that Tirza turned herself into a wolf and killed the chickens. She's going to go through a ceremony that will pick at her soul until they can remove the evil. Joe starts to leave, but Spiro pulls out a whip and stops him. Everytime Joe tries to go for his gun, Spiro whips him. Finally they fight hand to hand. Spiro pulls his knife and as they fight for control, the knife goes into Spiro.

Joe gets to the ceremonial grounds to find Tirza staked to the ground. Two gypsies hold him back so he can do nothing but watch the ceremony. She tells Joe she wants this and when the ceremony climaxes, Joe breaks free and goes to her. She tells him she's now free. Joe takes her back to the Ponderosa.

At breakfast, Joe tells Ben he wants to marry Tirza. Ben is agreeable, but Zorka arrives and says the weather has cleared so he's come for the girl. Joe tells him that Tirza is going to stay with him. Tirza says she's not. She has waited so long to see love in their eyes, not hate and fear. She's finally a fish swimming with the others. Joe wants her to stay, but she tells him, ""You're a tree, not a fish."" She leaves. Zorka apologizes for Spiro. They found a wolf paw with blood still on it and they should've recognized the devil in him. Ben and Joe watch the gypsies move off."

The middle-aged manager, Gene (Bob Odenkirk), notices a young, tough-looking guy (Michael Perez) staring at him. Gene appears petrified, but then it turns out the man wasn't looking at him at all, and Gene is obviously relieved. After the mall closes, Gene goes home in the snowy darkness to his modest apartment and sips a stiff drink alone in front of the TV. Then he carefully closes the blinds, pulls a videotape from a hidden compartment in his closet, puts it in his VCR, and starts watching. It's a demo tape of ""better call Saul"" ads, and we realize that ""Gene"" is actually Saul Goodman (of Breaking Bad), now living under a new alias.

Flashback to many years before, now in full color. A small New Mexico courtroom full of people is impatiently waiting for Goodman -- at this point in his life named Jimmy McGill -- to appear. The bailiff (Lonnie Lane) finds Jimmy in the bathroom practicing his argument in front of a urinal. Jimmy enters the courtroom and delivers his closing argument to the jury, defending three teenage boys (Grant Barker, Clay Space, and David Said) for some unspecified crime. Then the prosecutor (Sanford Kelley) plays a videotape of the accused laughing while they abuse a corpse in a mortuary.

After the trial, Jimmy is paid $700, argues unsuccessfully with the pay-window clerk (Nadine Marissa) that he should get $700 per defendant, and swears he won't do this work again. In the parking lot, Jimmy answers a cellphone call from a potential client, and uses a falsetto voice to pretend to be his own (non-existent) secretary, while making excuses why he can't meet the prospective client at his own office, offering instead to meet at a cafe. He drives his yellow clunker sedan to the exit gate, and we see that Mike (Jonathan Banks) (also of Breaking Bad) is running the parking lot booth. (They apparently do not know each other at this point.) Mike insists that Jimmy pay $3 or get an additional validation sticker. Jimmy rants and raves with angry sarcasm as he goes back to the building to get the additional sticker, rather than pay $3.

At the cafe, a nice, youngish couple talks with Jimmy about their case. The man (Jeremy Shamos) is going to be tried for embezzling $1.6 million while working as county treasurer; Jimmy has heard about it in the news. The man is just about to sign an employment agreement making Jimmy his lawyer, when his wife (Julie Ann Emery) stops him and says they need to think about it. Jimmy is disappointed.

Driving while talking on the phone, Jimmy runs into a skateboarder, cracking his windshield. In a panic, he runs over to the injured skateboarder, whose twin brother is freaking out. When the brothers (Daniel Spenser Levine and Steven Levine) ask for an out-of-court settlement of $500, Jimmy suddenly realizes it's a scam. He kicks the supposedly injured skateboarder who turns out not to be injured at all. Jimmy castigates them for trying to con a lawyer, or anyone driving such a crappy car as his. The pair run away when Jimmy demands money for his broken windshield.

Jimmy walks into a nail salon and chats with the asian owner (Eileen Fogarty) while collecting his mail. She is dismayed that he defended the corpse-abusing teens (she saw it in the paper). Jimmy walks to the back of the store where his extremely meager office is located (apparently in a utility closet). His answering machine has ""zero messages."" He looks through his mail and is interested to find a letter from the law firm HHM -- Hamlin Hamlin & McGill. It's a check for $26,000. He tears it up.

Jimmy goes to HHM and theatrically confronts Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian) in front of other HHM employees, dumping the torn-up check on the table and asking what it was for. Howard says it's ""for Chuck."" Jimmy says it's not enough; Chuck did a lot for HHM and should get more. In fact, says Jimmy, Chuck owns 1/3 of HHM. Jimmy wants $17 million, and tells Howard to stop pretending Chuck still works there; Chuck's cashing out. Howard says he wants to hear that from Chuck.

On his way out of HHM, Jimmy spies the couple from the cafe being introduced to Howard. Jimmy becomes so upset that he has a kicking fit with the trash can in the parking garage. But in the garage, he is met by Kim (Rhea Seehorn), a lawyer who was in the conference room when Jimmy confronted Howard. They share her cigarette; apparently they know each other.

It's night, and Jimmy drives up to Chuck's house. He stashes all his portable electronics in the streetside mailbox before entering the dark interior. Chuck (Michael McKean), Jimmy's considerably older brother, has been away from HHM for a year because he now suffers from extreme sensitivity to electromagnetic fields. He's housebound, and lives without electricity. Jimmy helps him by bringing supplies and newspapers.

Jimmy tries to talk Chuck into cashing out, but Chuck insists that he will recover from EM sensitivity and resume his work, plus Chuck knows HHM can't afford to pay that kind of money. Jimmy says that Chuck is broke and soon will be on the street, but it turns out HHM is paying Chuck a stipend so he can keep on living the way he is. The argument escalates to shouting, then Jimmy apologizes for getting angry.

Chuck shows Jimmy one of Jimmy's own matchbooks with his name as a lawyer ""James McGill"", and says that Howard wants Jimmy to stop using that name, because it could be confused with HHM. Chuck tries to persuade him, but Jimmy's flabbergasted that he's being asked to stop using his own name.

Jimmy hunts down the twin skateboarders at a skatepark, and tells them the story of how, when he was a younger man in Cicero, Illinois, he was a slip-and-fall con artist known as Slippin' Jimmy. He offers the twins $2,000 to team up with him on a new scam. Soon the three of them are casing their target, Betsy Kettleman (the wife of the accused county embezzler). The plan is to do the same thing the twins did to Jimmy, but with Jimmy showing up after the accident and pretending to be on Betsy's side.

They execute: The fake accident with Betsy's car works great, and witnesses dining outside are totally convinced. But Betsy doesn't get out of her car; instead she suddenly drives away. The twins call Jimmy, who's waiting a few blocks away in his car, and tell him what happened. They're hanging onto a pickup truck and following her car on their skateboards. Jimmy tells them that they're going to make even more money from a hit-and-run, then the twins decide they don't need Jimmy at all and hang up the phone.

Betsy pulls into her driveway and the twins skateboard up and confront her, one of them pretending to have an injured leg. But it's not Betsy at all; it's another woman (Miriam Colon) who speaks only Spanish. Not realizing it's the wrong person, the twins manage to make her realize they want money. She goes into the house, and the twins follow. Jimmy drives up, sees the damaged car, and knocks on the house door.

When the door opens, it is Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz) (from Breaking Bad) pointing a gun in Jimmy's face. Tuco pulls Jimmy into the house, looks around to make sure no one outside saw anything, then closes the door."

Calling him ""Mijo,"" she tells Tuco that she hit one of the twins with her car. When the twins refer to her by a derogatory name, Tuco silently bristles, but calmly reassures his grandmother, and sends her upstairs to watch TV. He talks briefly with the twins, determining that they want money and that the police have not yet been called. Then he beats them both to the floor with his grandmother's cane.

Tuco's grandmother watches a Spanish-language soap opera, but is curious as to what's happening downstairs. She goes to the top of the staircase and sees Tuco cleaning a small patch of blood off the living room rug. He tells her it's spilled salsa, and reassures her the twins won't bother her any more. After she returns to her TV, he makes a phone call and tells the person on the other end to get Nacho (Michael Mando) and his van.

Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) knocks on the front door; Tuco pulls him inside at gunpoint. Tuco questions Jimmy, who explains as innocently as possible that he's just a lawyer who got a call from the twins about an accident. Tuco's grandmother appears on the stairs again; Tuco hides his gun behind his back so she won't see it. She draws attention to the ""salsa"" stain, which Jimmy now notices. Tuco talks his grandmother back upstairs, then returns to interrogating Jimmy. Jimmy pleads that if the twins are still alive, they and he will leave, and never bother Tuco or his grandmother again. Tuco takes Jimmy to the garage and reveals that the twins are indeed alive, but bloodied, bound, and gagged. Tuco gives Jimmy a big knife and tells him to cut the twins free. As soon as Jimmy removes one of the gags, that twin blurts out that the accident was a scam led by Jimmy.

Tuco and his henchman tie and gag Jimmy and the twins, and take them out to the hot, sunny desert. As soon as Jimmy gets a chance to speak, he explains that the target of his scam was Betsy Kettleman, not Tuco's grandma, who happens to have a similar car. Tuco doesn't believe him, and scares Jimmy with a pair of wire cutters, so Jimmy makes up a story that he's an FBI agent. Paranoid Tuco swallows the tale easily, and is thrilled that the FBI operation is named ""Kingbreaker"" -- but then Nacho asks a few questions and quickly establishes that Jimmy doesn't know anything about Tuco's business. Jimmy admits he's just a lawyer, and Nacho convinces Tuco to let Jimmy go. Tuco is going to brutally kill or maim the twins for insulting his grandmother, but Jimmy argues, courtroom style, for mercy, eventually convincing Tuco just to break their legs, which he does with terrifying gusto. Jimmy drives the twins to the hospital.

Jimmy chats with a pretty lady (Jamie Luner) in a ritzy hotel bar. It's going well, but Jimmy becomes distressed by a nearby patron (Jeff Poole) snapping hard breadsticks in half, which reminds him of legs breaking. He goes to the washroom to vomit.

At night, Jimmy enters Chuck's (Michael McKean) dark, electricity-free house, takes off some of his clothes, and crashes on the couch without explanation. Chuck removes Jimmy's cellphone from his pants pocket and uses tongs to throw it out into the yard. While Jimmy sleeps, Chuck examines a hospital bill that also fell out of the pants, which details the twins' fractures. Morning comes, and Jimmy wakes up and drinks coffee with Chuck, who is wrapped in a foil sheet. Jimmy asks about the foil, and Chuck explains about the cellphone. Jimmy asks if he looked at the bill, and Chuck says, yeah, maybe. Jimmy says that the bill isn't the return of ""Slippin' Jimmy."" Jimmy repeatedly requests that Chuck remove the foil sheet. Reluctantly Chuck does, but after Jimmy leaves, he immediately puts it back on.

Jimmy returns to his life as public defender and works many cases. He continues to rehearse in the restroom, to have trouble with parking validation stickers at Mike's (Jonathan Banks) lot-exit booth, to argue with the prosecutor (Peter Diseth) in the hallway, to drink vending-machine coffee, and to collect meager checks from the pay-window woman (Nadine Marissa). His work starts to become tiresome.

In his utility-closet office in the back of the nail salon, Jimmy's desk phone still has ""zero messages."" He sits on his fold-out bed, sipping a strong drink. The nail salon owner (Eileen Fogarty) pokes her head in and announces there's a customer outside. Jimmy quickly folds his bed back to a couch, tidies his office, and dons his suit. The customer enters -- it's Nacho. Nacho assures Jimmy that no one knows he's here. Nacho's interested in the Kettleman's embezzled loot; he wants to steal it. He proposes that Jimmy tell him how to get to it, for which Jimmy will receive 10%. Though grateful that Nacho saved his life, Jimmy says he doesn't know where the money is, and besides he just wants to be a lawyer, and was only ever trying to get the Kettleman's business. On his way out, Nacho writes a phone number in a matchbook on the desk, in case Jimmy changes his mind."

Jimmy tries to make light of the situation, but Chuck impresses upon him the seriousness of the charge, which could get Jimmy labelled a sex offender. Chuck, a fully competent lawyer at this stage of his career, is disgusted with how low Jimmy has sunk. Chuck agrees to help Jimmy, so long as Jimmy straightens out his life once and for all.

Back to the present: Jimmy, alone in the dark, closed, nail salon, sips cucumber water and stares at Nacho's phone number. He calls Kim (Rhea Seahorn), waking her. She thinks he wants to talk dirty. He playfully invites her to come to the salon for a massage, then he tries to get her to talk about how much money the Kettlemans stole and where it might be. When that doesn't work, he suggests the family might be in danger. She becomes concerned and presses him for info, but he blows it off as just his own idle speculation. After hanging up, Jimmy reminds himself, ""I'm no hero."" He tosses and turns in bed, thinking. Then he gets up and uses paper items from the supply closet to construct a crude voice modifier. Driving to a pay phone, he calls the Kettlemans. It takes three tries, but Dean Kettleman (Jeremy Shamos) comes to the phone, and Jimmy, using his vibrating voice tube, attempts to tell him he's in danger. Dean can't understand what the caller is saying, and neither can Betsy (Julie Ann Emery) when Dean puts the call on speaker. Jimmy abandons the tube and just yells it plainly into the phone, then hangs up. Betsy and Dean realize that they have been warned that someone's coming for their money. Afraid, they stare out the window into the darkness, and see a shadowy figure moving outside their house.

Daytime: Jimmy argues with the prosecutor (Peter Diseth) in the bathroom over a plea deal, while the prosecutor uses the toilet. The prosecutor accepts Jimmy's deal when he realizes they haven't been talking about the same case. Jimmy gets a call from Kim; she wants him to come right away to talk about the Kettlemans. In a hurry to leave, Jimmy argues angrily with the calmly stubborn Mike (Jonathan Banks) at the lot exit gate. Mike won't budge, then Jimmy suddenly reaches into the booth, presses the gate button, and drives away before Mike can stop him.

At the Kettlemans' house, a police investigation is underway. Kim and Howard (Patrick Fabian) are there; Jimmy talks with each in turn. He learns that the house is ransacked and the Kettlemans (including their two children) (Caleb Burgess and Sage Bell) are missing. Jimmy drives to another pay phone and calls Nacho several times, stating the pay-phone's number in each message, and pleading to ""de-escalate"" the situation. He waits for a while, then the phone rings, but the person on the other end says nothing. Jimmy tries to leave, but his car won't start. He spots someone walking down the street toward his location. He runs; they give chase. Jimmy is swiftly apprehended by plainclothes cops. Upon discovering who he is, they deliver him to Nacho at the police station, believing him to be Nacho's lawyer.

Jimmy enters an interrogation room where Nacho (Michael Mando) sits alone. Nacho's being questioned because his van was spotted parked near the Kettlemans' home multiple times, making him prime suspect in their disappearance. The police also found blood in the van. Jimmy thinks Nacho is guilty, and recommends he come clean and take a plea deal. Nacho is angry; he believes that Jimmy had someone nab the Kettlemans' loot, and is now setting up Nacho to take the fall. Nacho admits to casing the house, but says he did nothing else; the van blood is from the twin skateboarders. Jimmy and Nacho now believe each other, but Nacho threatens to kill Jimmy if he doesn't straighten out this mess before the cops discover anything illegal Nacho has actually done.

Kim and two detectives (Dorian Missick and Vincent Laresca) talk with Jimmy outside the interview room. He tells them Nacho had nothing to do with it. He says to test the blood in the van, but they say that will take too long. Jimmy overtly ensures that Nacho can hear him loudly arguing for Nacho's innocence. Jimmy and Kim convince the investigators to let Jimmy examine the crime scene.

Leaving Nacho at the station, they all go to the house, and Jimmy looks around. After a while, he notices something: The Kettlemans' daughter is always holding a certain doll in the family photos, but the special spot on the shelf, where the doll should be, is empty. Could the Kettlemans have faked their own kidnapping? The detectives are unimpressed: They already noticed the missing doll, but the Kettlemans' cars are still here, and all other means of transportation have been checked out.

Jimmy talks privately with Kim and admits to anonymously warning the Kettlemans; he says he thought that his client Nacho was a threat, but he couldn't say so directly, due to attorney-client privilege. Kim realizes that Jimmy must be right that the Kettlemans weren't kidnapped. Jimmy informs Kim that he's in real danger from Nacho; the only solution is to find the Kettlemans. But Kim won't agree to point the police in the right direction; that would violate the Kettlemans' privilege with HHM.

Mike now won't let Jimmy drive into the parking lot. Jimmy gets out of his car and confronts Mike up close, poking him in the chest, but Mike grabs Jimmy's wrist and easily puts him on the ground with an arm-twist maneuver; Mike seems to know this move well.

Mike is now inside the building, standing in a hallway, discussing the Kettlemans with the two detectives. The three of them confront Jimmy and say that Mike won't press assault charges if Jimmy helps them nail Nacho. Jimmy insists that Nacho is innocent. The detectives are about to take Jimmy to booking, when Mike changes his mind and says he's not pressing charges. Jimmy follows Mike into an exit stair and demands to know why Mike let him off. Mike explains that he's a former Philly cop and that he thinks Jimmy's right, and that the Kettleman's are probably hiding somewhere nearby.

Jimmy is outside examining the Kettleman's house. He walks far out in to the wilderness land behind their back yard. Night comes, and he's still exploring, in a woodsy area. There he finds a tent, from which he can hear the sounds of the Kettleman family singing the camping song ""Bingo."" He calls HHM and tells them he found the Kettlemans, and to meet him at their house. He bursts into the tent causing the Kettlemans to momentarily scream, then he tells the Kettlemans they're coming home. They don't want to go, and he wrestles Betsy over a duffle bag, which rips open, spilling their stolen money all over the tent floor. Everyone silently stares at the pile of cash."

In an alley, they discover a barely conscious drunk man. Jimmy takes the man's watch and estimates it is worth more than his wallet, leading his companion to give him his remaining money in exchange for the watch. After the companion takes off, it is revealed that the whole incident was a scam organized by Jimmy and the ""unconscious"" man. The two then return to Jimmy's residence and congratulate each other.

In the present, the Kettlemans offer Jimmy a bribe if he does not reveal they stole the $1,500,000. Jimmy instead gives them the option of them hiring him as their lawyer, but the Kettlemans refuse. The next day, Jimmy thanks Mike for his assistance in solving the predicament. After Nacho is released from police custody, he accuses Jimmy of warning the Kettlemans and says he will face ""consequences."" Jimmy rebuts by implying that he warned the family for the children's sake, and that given Nacho's sloppiness he should be grateful for any warning as it saved him.

Back at his office at the salon, it is revealed that Jimmy took the Kettlemans' bribe. Jimmy calculates his fees that can be paid off with the bribe and spends the remaining money on a makeover and billboard advertisement which shares obvious and deliberate similarities with Chuck's law firm, Hamlin Hamlin & McGill, presumably out of spite. Kim confronts Jimmy over the imitation, and Howard Hamlin brings Jimmy to court over the trademark infringement, in which he is ordered to have the advertisement removed.

After failing to convince any news outlets to cover his predicament as a human interest story, Jimmy organizes a video plea, calling for sympathy to his situation. During filming, however, the worker removing the advertisement slips and falls, held on only by his harness. Jimmy pulls the worker to safety while the public watches and records. It is revealed that the accident was staged by Jimmy as a publicity stunt. Howard and Kim, watching the news, see through the ruse instantly. Due to his newfound popularity, Jimmy receives numerous new consultations.

Jimmy visits Chuck, but hides the newspaper that reported the ""rescue"" to keep Chuck from seeing it. Chuck congratulates Jimmy on his new success, but is oblivious to the stunt. Chuck notices that one of his daily newspapers is missing, which Jimmy dismisses. After Jimmy leaves, a suspicious Chuck painstakingly hurries to his neighbor's house and collects their copy of the newspaper, in which Chuck reads about the stunt."

Chuck refuses to open the door for the police officers due to his electromagnetic hypersensitivity. One officer walks around to the basement door, where he finds that the breaker lines have been cut and several empty cans of camping fuel for Chuck's stove and lanterns. Combined with Chuck's ramblings, the two officers deduce that Chuck is a drug user, kick down the front door, and taser him.

Meanwhile, Jimmy approaches wealthy tycoon Big Ricky Sipes, who offers $1 million in cash to help him secede from the United States. Jimmy's excitement at the windfall quickly dissipates when he notices the eccentric mogul has printed his own currency, and Jimmy can't take a single ""dollar"" to the bank. Jimmy visits another prospective client, an inventor named Roland Jaycocks, who asks to help him patent ""Tony the Toilet Buddy,"" a training toilet that spouts encouraging phrases to kids as they use it. When Jimmy points out that all of the phrases could be misconstrued as sexual innuendos, an incensed Roland chases Jimmy out of his house. Finally, Jimmy visits Mrs. Strauss, an elderly woman who collects porcelain Hummel figurines. He assists her with estate planning, which mostly consists of allocating various Hummels to different friends and relatives. Mrs. Strauss finds Jimmy's moxie quite charming, and pays his full fee upfront.

That evening, Jimmy entertains Kim Wexler with tales of his eventful day. Now that he has two wills and a living trust under his belt, she suggests that he could have a promising future in elder law. Jimmy considers, but is interrupted when Kim takes a call from Hamlin saying that Chuck is in the hospital. There, Jimmy and Kim explain Chuck's condition to a skeptical doctor who proves that Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity may not be genuine. She recommends Chuck be committed to a mental institution, but Jimmy initially decides to take him home. However, Hamlin shows up and tells Jimmy that he has convinced the DA to make sure that Chuck is not committed. Jimmy is infuriated by Hamlin's greed, knowing that if Chuck were to be committed, Jimmy would become his legal guardian and thus have the authority to request and receive Chuck's severance payment from Hamlin's firm. Although he threatens to have Chuck committed just to scare Hamlin, he still ultimately decides to take him home.

At Chuck's house, the two brothers discuss Jimmy's recent exploits, and Chuck encourages him to pursue elder law. After mimicking Andy Griffith's appearance in Matlock, Jimmy promotes his new specialization at a nursing home by printing a slogan on the bottom of Jello containers: ""Need a will? Call McGill."" Exiting the parking lot, Jimmy gives Mike his business card that has the same slogan printed on it. After his shift, Mike parks outside a woman's house; she comes out and gets in her car, stares at Mike uncomfortably, and they both drive away. At his home, Mike is visited by several police officers. He tells the detective, ""Long way from home, aren't you?"", to which the detective replies, ""You and me both."""

A Few Months Ago

Jen and her cousin Bruce Banner are on a road trip. He shows Jen the device strapped to his arm that keeps him in human form, and she talks about her theory that Captain America is a virgin. A Sakaaraan courier craft appears in front of them, and the cousins' car goes out of control and off the road. Jen climbs out and goes around to Bruce's side, and manages to get the unconscious man out. Some of his blood falls into the gash on her arm, and she turns green and grows. She runs off into the woods while Bruce turns into the Hulk.

That night, Jen wakes up near a country bar. She goes in via the back, goes to the women's restroom, and tries to wash the blood off her clothes. Four women come in and help her, figuring a man beat her up. As she goes out and waits for Bruce after calling him, three men come out and hit on Jen. She turns into a ""She Hulk"" and snarls at them, and they fall back in terror.

Jen wakes up on a bed in a cottage on a beach. She makes her way to the basement and finds a bunker there, and ""Smart Hulk"" working in a lab. Smart Hulk says that they're in Mexico and he talked to her parents, and they know she's okay. He says that the cottage is where he went during the Blip, integrating himself and Hulk's identities. Smart Hulk explains that Tony Stark built the lab for him, and that they almost hit a Sakaaran courier craft that were apparently delivering a message to him. Jen asks what happened to her, and she remembers that he changed. Bruce says that his irradiated blood got into her body after the crash, and the two of them share a rare combination of genetic factors that let them synthesize gamma radiation. He used a sample of blood to fully heal his injured arm, letting him turn into Hulk, incinerates the sample of Jen's blood because it's too dangerous to get out into the world, and tells her that her condition isn't ""going away"".

Bruce warns that he can't make a cure for her, and Jen insists that she doesn't want to be a Hulk. She needs food, and Bruce makes her pancakes. He tells his cousin that she can't go back to her job because it's too stressful, and she can't be confronted with stress anymore. Bruce tells Jen that she'll have to stay there until she can control her alter ego, and it could take years.

In his lab, Bruce puts Jen in a sealed chamber and has to learn when stress will trigger her transformation. He activates a wall of spinning buzz saws that advance on Jen. She panics, turns into She Hulk, and shoves the wall back, breaking it, then breaks out of the chamber. Jen speaks in her normal voice and has her normal personality, much to Bruce's surprise. He's jealous that she doesn't have another personality to wrestle with, and tells her that she still can't be emotional and it will never stop that people see her as a monster. Jen agrees to let Bruce to teach her how to "" Hulk"".

Bruce takes Jen out of the veranda and teacher her yoga techniques to control her emotions. Jen isn't into it, and Bruce tells her to get some rest and they'll try in the morning. The next morning, Bruce sets off an airhorn in the sleeping Jen's ear, startling her awake. She turns into She Hulk and breaks the bed, and Bruce goes to work reinforcing all of her furniture. Bruce walks his cousin through exercises in being a Hulk, and Jen wonders when she's going to use any of it as a lawyer. He tells her that by being a Hulk she's putting a target on herself and all of her loved ones, and shows her the upsides of being a Hulk. They can get buzzed on alcohol but never get drunk, but Jen has to still deal with the hangover in the morning. She insists that she's not going to be a superhero, and is going to return to her career as a lawyer. Jen says that she deals with anger and stress all the time, because she's a woman.

Jen goes to Bruce's jeep, and Bruce goes after her and says that she's now a superhero and people like them have to protect the world. She doesn't want to be a superhero and chooses to help people as a lawyer, and drives off. Bruce stops her and says that he spent a lifetime denying who he really was, and Jen drives off and throws him off the hood of the jeep. When she knocks him into a pile of boulders, Jen stops the jeep and walks back to check on him. Bruce is fine and tells Jen that she has to learn to calm down. She loses her temper, Hulks out, and punches Bruce. They fight and smash the cottage, and Jen sheepishly apologizes. Bruce says that he'll respect it if she wants to back to her life as a lawyer, but Jen figures he doesn't mean it. Bruce helps Jen get her things into the jeep, and tells her that she can call him anytime.

The Present

Jen finishes her flashback and says that her family knows and Nikki knows, and there hasn't been any crazy stuff ever since. She goes to the courtroom and she gives her closing argument. The supervillainess Titania smashes in as Jen starts, and Nikki tells Jen to Hulk out and deal with Titania. Jen does so and they fight, and She Hulk knocks Titania out with one punch. Jen reverts back to her human form and prepares to give her closing argument.

The Past

Jen applies at other law firms, but none of them want to hire her because she's a potential liability. She eventually meets with Nikki, who helps her find jobs.

Augustus ""Pug"" Pugiliese comes in with a welcome basket and says that he's in the Superhuman Law Division as well, Later, She-Hulk meets with Holden and he tells her that her first case is the parole of Emil Blonsky, the former Abomination. Blonsky has been serving time in an ultra-high security prison, and there's a lot of publicity about his possible release. GLK&H is taking on the case pro bono for the publicity, and She-Hulk points out that Blonsky tried to kill Bruce so she has a conflict of interest. Blonsky has signed a conflict waiver and wants to retain Jen specifically as his attorney. When She-Hulk says that she'd rather take any other case, Holden tells her that if she doesn't take the case, she doesn't have a job at the firm. He says that at the least she should meet with Blonsky before she decides.

She-Hulk goes to the prison and the guard tells her that no super-powers are allowed inside. Jen transforms and is taken to Blonsky, and her escort has her sign a waiver that they can't guarantee her safety. The guards let her into the visitor area around Blonsky's cell. He's in his human form, and Jen sets off the alarms as she steps on the pressure plates around Blonsky's Plexiglas cell. Blonsky explains that he's transformed himself spiritually, and he chooses not to turn into Abomination anymore.

Blonsky admits that he tried to kill Hulk, but it was nothing personal and was under direct orders from the US Government. He says that the Super Serum the government gave him drove him berserk and that's why he went on his rampage in Harlem, Now Hulk is a hero and Blonsky is locked up. Jen tells Blonsky that he's going to need to show he feels remorse for his actions, and Blonsky says that he does, and he's written haikus to each of his victims. He insists he's speaking from the heart and wants to move on with his life, and Jen says that she'll think about helping him.

Holden leaves a message on Jen's phone saying that he wants her answer by the end of the day. Jen calls Bruce and tells him that she has a new job, but she has to take on Blonsky as a client. Bruce says that Blonsky wrote him a nice letter and a haiku, and they've put their grievances behind them and Bruce is sure he's okay with Jen defending Blonsky. He warns her that it's not easy going public, and laughs when she says the public named her ""She-Hulk"". Bruce assures her that she's got it but should be careful, and he's busy. Before he can finish, the Sklaar courier he's on takes off into warp.

Jen calls Holden and tells him that she's taking the case. She assures Holden that she has a winning strategy and the case is in the bag, and her new boss tells her to take a look at the news. The news is running footage of Abomination in an underground fight club in Macao.

She points out that he didn't tell her about his escaping from prison and fighting in Macao. He says that he was forced to leave his cell but returned of his own free. Emil explains that the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong, broke him out.

Jen calls Nikki at her office, and tells Emil's story. Nikki says that she can track down Wong, and Jen complains that Wong may have ruined her case. She then informs the audience that the show isn't a cameo a week despite the cameos, and it's mostly about her.

The news and Internet are filled with reports about how She-Hulk is representing Abomination at his upcoming parole hearing. Nina is in Jen's office watching it, and Jen comes in. Her paralegal tells her that she has to respond to it, but Jen refuses. Jen is called to Holden's office, and the two of them go there and Nina warns Jen that the gossip won't go away once the case does. In Holden's office, Dennis is already there as is Pug and Dennis isn't happy Jen is there as well. He says that he has too much history with Jen to be comfortable on the case, and Mallory Book comes in and Holden tells Jen that Mallory is also in the Superhuman Law Division. When Dennis hits on her, she leaves in disgust.

Holden tells Jen that Dennis has been defrauded by an ex-girlfriend and wants their help filing a suit against her to get their money back. The girlfriend is a shapeshifting Light Elf from New Asgard, although Dennis thought he was dating Megan Thee Stallion. Wong teleports in, in response to Jen's message, and Holden lets Jen go to talk to Wong privately.

Back in Jen's office, Wong readily tells her that he extracted Emil from the prison against his wishes because Wong needed a worthy opponent as part of his training to become Sorcerer Supreme. He asks that Emil not be punished for his transactions, and Jen points out that the parole board will be the one punishing Emil. Wong refuses to erase everyone memories through magic, and she asks Wong to show up at the hearing and explain everything. Wong agrees.

Pug interviews Dennis about how much money he lost and confirms he spent $175,000 on her in gifts. Once Dennis confirms that Pug will take his case, he leaves. However, he then comes back in and tells Pug that he's going to drop the suit. Pug realizes that ""Dennis"" is the Light Elf, Ruun, shapeshifted into Dennis' form. She leaves before security can arrive.

Jen goes into the prison for the hearing past the reporters, and Emil's soulmates are there. The hearing comes to order and Jen says that they have a witness who will clear Emil of any wrongdoing. She says Emil will give his statement since Wong hasn't arrived, much to Emil's surprise. He says that he feels rehabilitated and when he rambles on, Jen interrupts and says Emil's not the man he was. She says that Emil's soulmates have pledged to support him. The prison staff testify about how Emil has redeemed himself at the prison, while Jen waits desperately for Wong to appear.

When one of the board members plays the video of Abomination in the fight ring, Jen says that there were extenuating circumstances. Wong teleports in and he starts testifies.

In Dennis' pre-trial hearing, Runn's lawyer moves for the dismissal of all charges on the grounds that Ruun is the daughter of a New Asgard diplomat and thus has diplomatic immunity. The judge rules that Ruun doesn't because they're not in New Asgard. The defense lawyer says that no rational human would have believed Ruun was Megan Thee Stallion, and it was just a relationship gone bad. The judge points out that Pug has to prove Dennis was truly fooled, but he lets them go to trial.

Ruun then shapeshifts into the judge's form, takes the bench after he leaves, and says that he's changing his ruling. Pug notices that Ruun is gone and calls her on it, and she changes back to her normal fun and runs out of the courtroom with a bailiff chasing her.

Wong says that it was Emil's choice to return to his cell. When one of the board members points out that Emil is Abomination, Emil turns into Abomination against Jen's wishes and demonstrates that he's in full control of himself. He then changes back to human and Jen says that the whole thing proves that Emil could break free if he wanted, but has chosen not to. The board adjourns to consider all that they've heard. When the board points out that Wong facilitated a crime, Wong quickly teleports away.

Jen rushes out past the reports, ignoring their questions. Shew goes to the bar with Nikki, and still tells her paralegal that she's not doing interviews. Pug joins them and wonders how they worked with Dennis, and Jen points out that Dennis almost terminally deluded. Getting an idea, the next day Peg has Jen testify under oath that she knows Dennis well and he shared his dating life with her. Jen says that Dennis is self-absorbed and chauvinistic, and would believe he could attract Megan Thee Stallion. The judge awards full damages to Dennis, and sentences Ruun to 60 days for impersonating a judge. Megan is the gallery, and says that there's only one Megan.

As Jen, Pug, and Dennis leaves, Dennis asks them if he thinks he has a shot with the real Megan. Pug tells him not to try and thanks Jen for her testimony. Jen gets an idea when Dennis wishes there was a way to take away Ruun's shapeshifting powers permanently.

The parole board reconvenes, and they grant Emil release on parole. Emil is prohibited from turning into Abomination indefinitely, and has to wear an inhibitor. Jen thanks them, and Emil thanks Jen. He gives her the same advice Nikki did about being part of the story by interviewing.

Later, Jen goes on a news show as She-Hulk and says that he didn't come up with the name. The interviewer focuses on her diet and exercise secrets.

That night, Jen returns home and two men dressed as wreckers attack her. She turns into She-Hulk and easily tosses them off of her, and two more wreckers join them, wielding Asgardian tools they stole from a construction site. She easily defeats them, and one of them tries to take a blood sample but the needle breaks on her skin. They run off and one of them, Thunderball, says that he couldn't get the sample for her blood.

Later, Jen returns to her office and signs Megan on as her newest client. Holden comes by and sees them twerking together."

In Kathmandu, Nepal, Wong settles down to binge on 'The Sopranos' when Madisynn falls through a portal onto his couch next to him. She talks about how she just fought goblins, and about how a talking goat helped her escape in return for six drops of her blood.

Jen is in her apartment talking to the audience about Wong. Her father Morris comes in and says that he's there to beef up her security. Jen admits that she didn't call the police about the Wrecking Crew, and says that she'll kick their asses if they come back.

At her office, Jen signs up for a dating app. Nikki comes on and turns the TV on to a repeat of Jen's interview on the news. Wong teleports in and tells Jen that he has a legal matter of the greatest importance. Nikki leaves, and Wong explains that he's having issues with a stage magician, Donny Blaze, a former student of the mystic arts but was kicked out after he summoned three kegs and a former fraternity brother. Now Donny is performing at the Mystic Castle in LA, using the real mystic arts in his shows, and is sending volunteers to other dimensions. Wong says that he needs to make an example of Donny, so that no unlicensed persons ever perform the mystic arts. Jen confirms that Donny didn't sign a NDA or a non-complete, or anything in writing. She warns that any judge will throw out the case, and has Wong leave his card before he portals out.

That night, Jen and Nikki go to the bar and Jen writes up a cease-and-desist. Once she's done, Jen works on her dating profile. A man comes over and hits on them, and once he leaves Nikki assures Jen that there are plenty of non-gross people out there for Jen to date. Nikki goes through Jen's dating profile and critiques it, and suggests Jen make a profile as She-Hulk. Jen would rather date as ""herself"", and a match comes up.

That night, Jen meets with the man, Alan, who spends their date talking about himself and eying other women. He takes a call and leaves, sticking Jen with the check.

The next day in court, She-Hulk says that she and Wong have filed a motion for preliminary injunction against Donny. The judge asks for a witness, and Wong reluctantly takes out his sling ring, summons a portal, and summons Madisynn. Jen puts Madisynn on the stand, and she explains that she can't go into detail about how she escaped, or the demon who helped her would reap her soul and the soul of everyone she loves.

Donny's lawyer moves to dismiss, insisting magic can't be copyright. Jen says that the mystic arts is real magic, not stage illusions. Donny and his lawyers demonstrate stage magician, and Wong gets up to say a few words against Jen's advice. Wong talks about how Donny is seeking to wield the power of gods, putting the entire multiverse at risk,. The judge says that she'll review the evidence and have her decision in a few weeks. She also rules that Donny can practice his livelihood in the interim. Madilynn gets Wong to take her for froyo, spoiler 'Sopranos' as they go.

That night at her house, Jen calls Nikki and asks her to proof a brief the next day. Nikki reminds Jen that the next day is Saturday, and Jen claims that she has a big night after swiping and hangs up. Jen gets an alert that she has no new matches on the dating app, transforms into She-Hulk, and creates a new profile for herself. The new matches flood in, and She-Hulk goes out with them. They're all jerks, except for the last one, a pediatric oncologist. The doctor, Derek, asks Jen about herself. She-Hulks is intrigues and suggest they go to her place.

At Jen's place, She-Hulk tells Derek about her first day at the law firm. She gets a call and ignores it, and Derek says that it's the best date he's had in a while. The phone keeps ringing and She-Hulk tells Derek that it can wait, and kisses him.

As Jen drives to work, she sees billboards advertising Titania's skincare products. Later when she's at home, her cousin Ched barges in and tells her that he's making a killing selling Titania's She-Hulk products, and wants Jen to autograph them. Jen refuses, and his cousin tells him the line has nothing to do with her. She explains that Titania trademarked her name, and she didn't ""let her"" do it. Ched points out that if Jen had trademarked ""She-Hulk"" first, Titania wouldn't have been able to.

Later, Jen and Nikki go to one of Titania's store, so Jen can talk to Titania. Jen find Titania and tells her to stop, and Jen insists that the name is hers. Jen goes to her office with Nikki, and complains that Titania stole her name. Once Nikki goes back to her desk, Pug comes in and asks for a favor: that she'll stand in line waiting for a sneaker drop and help him get a second pair when they're limited to one per customer. Nikki agrees if Pug will put her in contact with his drop broker, so the broker Alonso can get clothing for Jen's size.

Pug agrees and later takes Nikki to the place Alonso says is a front for the business, a boba café. the clerk claims to have no idea what Pug is talking about, but Nikki assures him they're not cops and takes them to the back. The clerk has bootleg superhero stuff in the back, and tells them that the real tailor won't meet with them and he's very exclusive. He takes them to a security door, and they talk over the intercom to the tailor, who says that he'll do a 15-minute consultation with them.

She-Hulk meets with Holden in his office, and he finally asks about the Titania products he saw ads for. Jen assures him that isn't her, and points out now the firm is in the middle of a frivolous lawsuit. No one will hire the firm if it can't handle their own messes, and tells Jen that someone will handle it rather than her.

Jen meets with lawyer Mallory Book at the firm, who says that she's taking the case a professional courtesy but moving forward, they're not colleague. Mallory says that they need to show strength and countersue, and She-Hulk was using the name in a professional capacity before the trademark date, and Titania is profiting off of name recognition. She tells Jen to dress professionally if she's going to be Mallory's client, and calls in Nikki to help Jen with her loo. Nikki says that she has made Jen an appointment with the guy who makes clothing for superheroes. Jen figures she doesn't need it, and Mallory and Nikki tell her that she does.

Later, Jen and Mallory go to court for the preliminary with Titania. Titania's lawyer moves to dismiss the frivolous countersuit, and Mallory responds by saying that Titania didn't file trademark on the name until She-Hulk went public, and present evidence says that Titania is using the name to sell her sham products. She asks the court to grant a summary judgment. Titania insists that her products aren't sham, and her lawyer says that Jen wasn't interested in the name until it became associated with Titania's products. He runs tape of Jen telling the press that she won't answer to the name She-Hulk, and Mallory runs the tape of Jen telling a newscaster that someone else made up the name ""She-Hulk"" and it stuck. The lawyer tells Mallory that she needs to present more instances, and Mallory says that she can.

Once the judge recesses, Nikki takes She-Hulk to the tailor, Luke Jacobson. He's never heard of She-Hulk, and says that his client list is exclusive because his work is impeccable. Nikki says that She-Hulk is Hulk's cousin by blood, and is being considered to be an Avenger. When She-Hulk says that she's just a lawyer, Luke figures it's a waste of his time and talents to make a non-superhero suit. Nikki has Jen demonstrate how she can lose mass by turning into her human form, and then she turns into She-Hulk again. Inspired, Luke has an assistant order extra bolts of stretch wool.

Later, She-Hulk and Nikki go back to the firm. One of She-Hulk's dates, Todd, is with Mallory and recognizes She-Hulk, who recognizes him. He says that he's one of the firm's biggest clients, and Mallory is his lawyer. Todd suggests that they should reconnect and She-Hulk vaguely agrees, and Mallory takes Todd to her office.

Later, Jen and Nikki sit on a bench in front of the firm for lunch. Jen talks about her date with Todd, and Jen figures her dates show a clear pattern of her using the name. All she has to do is call all of her dates as witnesses.

Later in court, Mallory shows the judge Jen's dating profile and calls the four men Jen dated. She-Hulk slumps down as the men describe their dates, and Derek says that he wouldn't have gone on the date if Jen had presented as herself. The judge finds in Jen's favor, and has Titania recall all of her products. Afterward, Titania tells She-Hulk that it isn't over and leaves. Derek suggests to Titania that they link up later.

As She-Hulk and Mallory go, Mallory tells She-Hulk that she can do better. Jen takes Mallory to the bar and buys her a drink as thanks, and Mallory tells Jen that she doesn't know any other lawyer who would humiliate herself to win a case. They talk about what they have to put up with as women, and Jen says that she's glad they're friends. They're both taken aback by her statement, and Mallory thanks Jen for the drink and goes.

She gets ready for their date, and Josh pulls up outside. They go out on dates over the next few days, and Jen finally pulls Josh into her house and they have sex, She wakes up the next morning and finds Josh gone, She texts him but gets no answer, and at work tells Nikki that she's waiting to hear from Josh. Nikki tells She-Hulk to just coast through it, but She-Hulk wonders why Josh is ghosting her. Josh still doesn't text Jen, and Emil's parole officer Chuck Donelan calls her and tells her that they got get a failure alert on Emil's inhibitor. Chuck is going to go up to Emil's ranch, and since they don't have the budget for soldiers, he wants She-Hulk to meet him at the ranch.

Jen drives to the ranch, Summer Twilights, and meets Chuck at the gate. She honks the horn and Chuck suggests that she 'Hulk out"". Once she does, they go in and Emil explains that he turned into Abomination to chase after a chicken. Chuck resets the inhibitor and quickly drives away, and Jen tells Emil that she figured he wasn't trying to run off. She checks her phone but there's still nothing from Josh.

Man Bull and El Aguila slams into her Prius. Jen turns into She-Hulk and stop Man Bull from destroying her car. Emil explains that it's two men working through their resentments in a safe environment. Man Bull apologizes to Jen, who tells him to apologize to her Prius with money. Jen doesn't care about their backstories and wonders how she's going to drive home when her car is destroyed. Once they learn the tow truck won't be there until later that day, Emil figures Jen can spend some time there, and explains that he offers life-coaching. Jen tells Emil that she has to get some work done, and he tells her that she should enjoy the relaxation. He figures she's not in a teachable mood and walks away.

The retreat doesn't have wifi service, and Jen tries to find someplace that has it. She comes into a building where Emil is meeting with his clients: Man Bull, El Aguila, Porcupine, and Saracen. He invites Jen to join, but she passes because she managed to get one bar. Emil continues with his session, Emil suggests that Porcupine take off his porcupine suit and open up. He feels safer with it on. Wrecker comes in, and Jen does a ""previously on"" for him. Jen turns into She-Hulk and throws Wrecker across the room, and Emil tells her to sit in the Calming Chair.

Emi has them sit in the circle, and Wrecker talks about how he decided to work on himself without a magic crowbar. He apologizes to Jen for teaming on up on her with the rest of the Wrecking Crew, and El Aguilar points out that She-Hulk has some issues. The others agree, and Emil asks She-Hulk if she wants to share. He points out that she's glued to her phone, and she talks about Josh, and how she met him when she was Jen and he didn't seem interested in She-Hulk. She-Hulk talks about how everyone pays attention to She-Hulk and nobody pays attention to Jen, and that some guys don't care about Jen and it sucks for Jen. Now Josh liked Jen, but it sucks when he's ghosting her.

The others want to kill Josh, and Emil has them speak to Jen's pain with the tools they've learned in group. They say that Jen is pretty great, and they'd like to spend time with her. Wrecker tells her to stop using She-Hulk as a shield and trust them, and She-Hulk turns into Jen and everyone applauds her breakthrough. Porcupine removes his mask and he smells because he's been in the suit too long. When Wrecker tells Jen to spend time on Jen because Josh isn't, the others agree and tell Jen to delete Josh's number. Jen does and everyone cheers,

They go to the smoke lodger yurtin, and the group watches as Jen comes out. She deletes the number, and they cheer. As the tow truck comes to get Jen's car, she tells the group that she'll never forget them. They give her a goodbye card with their love. Jen tells Emil that she's glad she stuck around and she drives off with the tow truck driver.

Three days earlier while Jen is sleeping after sex, Josh clones her phone and then sends it to ""HulkKing"" with the Intelligencia, along with a sample of Jen's blood."

He explains how he activated his jet boots and they shot him into the sky, but then they cut off and Leap-Frog fell back down to the parking lot. The boots set his costume on fire, giving him third-degree burns on his legs, and he wants compensation from the tailor who designed the suit. She-Hulk agrees and Eugene says that the tailor is Luke Jacobson, a super-suit designer. She realizes Luke is her tailor, and goes to Holden and tells him about the potential conflict of interest, because Luke also designs her clothing. Holden points out that the Patilios are valuable clients and Eugene has signed a conflict waiver, and tells She-Hulk to get Luke to agree to a settlement so the case doesn't go to court.

She-Hulk goes to see Luke, who tells her that he's still working on the gala dress for the upcoming lawyer award. Luke insists that his suits are impeccable, and refuses to settle for any amount. He tells She-Hulk that She-Hulk will never get another suit from him, and rips her new dress in pieces. Furious, She-Hulk tells Luke that she'll see him in court and storms out.

Later in court, Luke tells the judge that he's not representing himself, and his lawyer Matt Murdoch comes in. He calls for the judge to reject She-Hulk's motion for Luke to produce his client list, and She-Hulk counter-argues. They argue back and forth, and the judge rules in Matt's favor. Eugene says that he used jet fuel in the boots, as Matt can tell with his heightened sense of smell, and Eugene did it against Luke's instructions, and then denies it, and everyone can tell he's lying. When the judge dismisses the suit, She-Hulk tries to apologize to Luke, who doesn't accept her apology.

That night, Jen goes to the bar. Matt is there and buys her an appletini, then joins her. Matt explains that Luke made him a couple of new suits and Matt owed him. He claims that he had a ""hunch"" that Eugene used jet fuel, and explains that he usually does pro bono work but occasionally takes on a rich client when the bills pile up. Matt says that Jen as a lawyer can use the law to help people, and become She-Hulk when it fails. He steps aside to take a call, and Todd texts Jen to ask to see her about a legal issue. Matt comes back and says that something has come up at work so he has to go, they both say it was nice meeting each other, and he leaves.

Todd persists in texting Jen to meeting, threatening to go to Holden. She-Hulk finally meets with him and Todd tries to impress She-Hulk with the Wakandan war spear he bought at auction for a million dollars. She isn't impressed. When Todd tries to hit on She-Hulk, she storms off.

Jen goes home and collapses on the couch, and gets a call from Eugene saying he's driving to his secret lair and someone is ramming his car. She says that she'll meet him, then puts on her new She-Hulk costume and goes to the parking garage where Eugene is. As she drops in front of the car, Daredevil drops off the car that he was attacking and tells She-Hulk to back off. She-Hulk refuses to waste her new costume and tells Eugene to drive off. As he does so, Daredevil tries to get by She-Hulk, using his acrobatic agility to avoid her blows. He drops down in front of Eugene as the latter drives out of the garage, and She-Hulk drops in front of Daredevil. She-Hulk manages to stun Daredevil, grabs him, and pulls off his mask to discover that he's Matt. Matt puts his mask back on and explains that he's really blind, and has a special method to ""see"". Jen reverts to her human form, and Matt explains that Eugene abducted Luke and is holding him hostage, and she insists on going with Daredevil to save Luke.

The two of them drive to the warehouse that Eugene is using as his ""secret"" lair, the ""Lily Pad"". Eugene is having Luke design a new improved costume for him, and Jen and Daredevil sneak up to the window to check out Eugene and his goons. Daredevil locates all the goons by hearing their heartbeats, and tells Jen to stay there while he picks them off one by one. They argue about whether to use stealth or super-strength, and Daredevil finally tells her to follow his lead.

Inside, Daredevil takes out the first group of goons. When the reinforcements arrive, She-Hulk drops in through the roof and takes them out. She-Hulk smashes into the main room and the rest of the goons arrive. Eugene suits up while Jen frees Luke, tell him to go and call the police, and tells Eugene to stoop before he racks up more legal charges. Daredevil takes out the goons and argues legal points with She-Hulk, and Leap-Frog leaps out a window. He lands on a car below and breaks his leg.

Later, the police and paramedics arrive, and the latter take Eugene away on a stretcher. Luke tells She-Hulk that they're even and he'll make her dress. Daredevil is on the roof, and Jen joins him and thanks him for his help. He thanks her for her help, and they argue over who was the lead superhero. He offers to take out to dinner the next time he's in town, and Jen suggests that they skip all that. They go to Jen's apartment, kissing, and end up in bed.

The next morning, Daredevil walks back to his hotel. Jen is wondering if the episode is over, when Nikki comes in with her own dress for the gala. She works out that Jen had sex with Daredevil, and Jen wonders if they're doing the gala in this episode when the next episode is the finale.

That night, She-Hulk and Nikki go to the gala. Jen's parents are inside, and She-Hulk realizes that Todd is there. The Walters, Nikki, and Pug go to their table, and the presenter gives the Lawyer of the Year award to She-Hulk, Mallory, and several other lawyers. Intelligencia starts playing Josh's photos of Jen after sex on the screens in the back, and Intelligencia says that she's a slut. She-Hulk goes berserk and pounds the screens. Alarms go off and everyone runs, and She-Hulk sees Intelligencia in the back taking video of her rampage. They run out when She-Hulk comes for them, and She-Hulk bursts through the outer wall and grabs them. Armed DODC soldiers arrive and tell her to stand down, and she puts up her hands and surrenders."

Malloy, Nikki, and Pug come into Jen's cell and Malloy tells Jen that they need to discuss the rampage. She points out that the witnesses saw an out-of-control Hulk, and tells Jen that the DA won't pursue charges as long as Jen wears an inhibitor to stop her from becoming She-H

Outside the DODC prison, Jen's parents greet her, Jen goes to her office and is fired, and Nikki and Pug help her box her things. She goes home and finds reporters camped outside her house. Jen has dinner with her parents, and her father says that she's welcome to move in with them if she can't get a job. She's eventually forced to move back in, and goes to her old room.

Later, Nikki comes to see Jen, who is trying to locate Intelligencia. Nikki has also been trying to track them down, and tells Jen that their server security is airtight. She figures that one of them will eventually slip up, and then Jen plans to sue them for defamation and invasion of privacy. Dennis gives an interview that is less than flattering about Jen. Jen complains to herself about how it feels like she's getting screwed over. The narrator cuts in, but Jen cuts him off, saying they're not doing narration. Jen tries to contact her cousin, but Bruce doesn't respond. She figures Emil would understand and texts him to ask if she can stay with him at his retreat. When Jen gets no response, she goes anyway.

At her office, Nikki manages to get an invitation to an Intelligencia meeting from HulkKing.

Jen drives to the retreat and Wrecker greets her. He sets her up with a guest room.

Pug and Nikki drive to the Intelligencia meeting place, and Nikki sends Pug in. He reluctantly goes in and blends with the other all-male members, and Todd is there and recognizes Pug. Todd accepts Pug as one of them and hugs him, and then complains that Jen didn't earn her powers. Nikki talks Pug through acting convincing, over his earbud, and Todd says that he is HulkKing. The signal gets cut off due to bad reception. Todd calls the meeting to order, and says that they're just getting started.

Jen goes to the compound's kitchen to get a snack, and runs into Wrecker. Wrecker says that Emil is at the lodge holding a private event, and Jen goes there.

Todd introduces the special guest speaker: Emil as Abomination. Jen comes in and Emil turns back to his human form when she calls his name. Nikki comes in and Pug joins her, and he tells Jen that everyone is Intelligencia and Todd is HulkKing. Todd tells Jen that he hired Josh to seduce her and steal her blood, and his team has synthesized her blood to give him the powers she never should have. He injects himself with the serum and becomes Bio Hulk. Titania bursts in, and then Hulk, while Jen complains to the camera about how messy the season has become. He fights Abomination, while Jen complains that none of the storylines makes any sense.

Jen breaks the inhibitor, transforms, and breaks out through the Disney+ menu, and enters the Marvel: Assembled show. She finds herself in the TV studio, and finds the She-Hulk production office. She complains to the writers about the stupid season finale, and they tell her that they thought it would be a cool twist. They say that it's the story that Kevin wants, and She-Hulk says that she wants to talk to Kevin. The writers tell her that no one talks to Kevin, and She-Hulk goes to talk to Kevin.

The receptionist has She-Hulk sign the NDA and calls the guard. She fights past him and the other guards, and finds a room filled with screen showing Marvel shows. A robot, KEVIN, drops down from the ceiling and greets She-Hulk. It explains that its name stands for ""Knowledge Enhanced Visual Interconnectivity Nexus, and tells her to transform back to Jen before it answers her question, and she should transform once the camera is off her because the visual effects team has moved on to another project.

Once Jen transforms back to her human form, KEVIN tells her that it makes the decisions, and it possesses the most advanced entertainment algorithm in the world. It tells her that it's not her show, and Jen asks for her closing argument. KEVIN grants her request, and Jen says that they shouldn't go for a big spectacle but focus on her travails. She convinced KEVIN to get rid of the Todd-gets-powers storyline, have Hulk reveal where he was in one of the movies, hold Emil accountable, have the climax in daytime, and bring back Daredevil.

KEVIN agrees, but tells Jen she'll never be able to enter real-life again. Jen makes an off-screen transformation and returns to the show, turns back to her human form, and says that she'll see him in court. The police take Todd arrive, and Daredevil arrives to help. Jen tells him that he missed it. Emil goes back to prison for ten years, and she goes home with Matt and has an outdoor meal with him and her family. Matt tells everyone that he's only in LA for a week.

Bruce as Smart Hulk joins them and introduces his son, Skaar.

Later, She-Hulk goes to court, telling a reporter that she's going to hold people responsible for their actions, as Jen and as She-Hulk.

The end credits show Emil going to a chicken house, KEVIN reading a She-Hulk comic, and Todd being hauled away in court as She-Hulk looks on.

Wong teleports into Emil's cell and apologizes to Emil for taking so long. Emil figures Wong got sucked into another show, and then takes him to Kamar-Taj."

The operative is brought before Fire Lord Sozin, who tells him the information he stole was planted to trick the other nations into falsely believing the first attack in Sozin's impending war would target the Earth Kingdom. However, Sozin has a different plan in mind.

At the Southern Air Temple, twelve-year-old airbending prodigy Aang is summoned by his friend and mentor, Monk Gyatso. They discuss the imminent festival in honor of the Great Comet that will appear soon, and hundreds of airbenders from temples around the world arrive for the celebration. As Aang joins his fellow students to help with preparations, Gyatso attends a meeting of the airbending elders to discuss Aang's future. The boy has been revealed to the monks as the next incarnation of the Avatar, the one person capable of bending all four elements, and the sacred protector of the world. The Earth Kingdom has contacted both the Water Tribes and the Air Nomads asking for help against the Fire Nation's impending attack. With all out war on the horizon, the monks must tell Aang of his unique heritage, and send him to be trained in the other elements immediately. Gyatso argues against such an action, as Aang, despite having already achieved mastery in airbending, is too young to appreciate the responsibility and endure the hardship of such a burden. The other elders are adamant it must be done, and Gyatso takes Aang to the shrine of the last air nomad avatar, Yengchen. When she died, the next Avatar was born into the Water Tribe, the next into the Earth Kingdom, and the next into the Fire Nation. Now, the Avatar spirit resides in an air nomad, and Gyatso tells Aang that he is the newest Avatar. He explains that he must leave very soon to begin training the the other bending disciplines, but Aang is saddened at the thought of leaving his life and his friends behind, especially Gyatso. The old monk tries to comfort and encourage him, but that night Aang sneaks out of bed to think. His giant sky bison, Appa, finds him, and Aang tells the flying creature his is terrified of what the monks are asking of him. He goes for a ride to clear his head, as far below, the Fire Nation army gathers. Lead by the Fire Lord, the Fire Nation troops invade the temple and attack the Air Nomads. A battle ensues, and Gyatso gathers the students, but finds Aang missing. He takes them to the shrine as the other airbending masters defend their home, but the firebenders have been empowered by the passing comet, and slaughter the monks in droves. Gyatso makes a stand at the shrine and faces down Fire Lord Sozin, but the Fire Nation ruler shows no mercy. Meanwhile, a storm has come down upon Aang and Appa while they fly, driving them to the ocean. The hurricane disorients them and a massive wave swallows them, and they nearly drown in the depths. Suddenly, Aang's master tattoos glow, and he enters a powerful state which freezes both him and his bison in a ball of ice, deep below the surface.

In the Southern Water Tribe Village of Wolf Cove, teenage waterbender Katara tries to practice her waterbending in secret, but fails to perform even basic moves. She finds her older brother Sokka trying to organize the village's children for patrol duty. The two go fishing to replenish the village's supplies, and Sokka chastises Katara for trying to use her powers again, as the Fire Nation has hunted down every other waterbender in the South Pole and would kill her if they found out. They argue, and soon get caught in rapids that crash them into a large spherical iceberg. Their boat drifts away, so Katara tries to waterbend it back to them, but her uncontrolled bending disturbs the ice. As they watch, a light shines from the center and the iceberg blasts itself apart, revealing a young boy standing inside, Aang. His glowing markings fade and he falls unconscious at the sibling's feet. Sokka is skeptical and wary of the strange child, but Katara insists they take him back to the village. Meanwhile, the crew of a nearby Fire Nation ship witness the light, and their scarred young captain orders them to follow it. Sokka and Katara return home with the unconscious boy, and their grandmother recognizes his tattoos as belonging to an airbender. Sokka dismisses the idea, as airbenders are extinct, and they leave him to rest. On the Fire Nation ship, the young captain, Prince Zuko, tries to convince his uncle General Iroh of what he saw. Iroh is skeptical, as the banished prince can only return home and take his place as heir to the throne on the condition that he hunt down and capture the long-missing Avatar, and after several years trying to find any sign of his impossible quarry, he may be imagining things. He tries to get Zuko to calm his search and accept the possibility that the Avatar is gone forever, but Zuko is determined.

Aang awakes and emerges into the village, confused. Sokka finds him and Aang asks where he is, but realizes Appa is missing. No one in the village knows what a sky bison is, but Appa comes to Aang's side as his blows a special whistle. Aang explains what happened to him during the storm, and the villagers are incredulous at his story, as airbenders have not been seen in over a century. Gran Gran tells him that Fire Lord Sozin destroyed the Southern Air Temple and every single monk within it as they gathered for the last Great Comet Festival. She realizes that Aang has been trapped in the ice for a hundred years.. Aang goes outside the process this revelation, and Katara goes to check on him. She tries to comfort him, and tells him that her mother was killed when the Fire Nation raided their village years ago. Her father and all the other able-bodied men left to join the war and retaliate against the firebenders, leaving young Sokka as the sole protector of the village. Over the last hundred years, the Fire Nation has conquered much of the world, leaving only parts of the vast Earth Kingdom and the North and South water tribes still actively fighting against them, and every nation has become paranoid of outsiders. She takes Aang to the abandoned firebender ship that she hides in to practice her waterbending, but is still unable to make much happen. She explains she is the only waterbender left in the tribe, and has had to hide her talent in case the Fire Nation ever returns. Aang gives her some advice to focus her energy, helping Katara to achieve a basic form and waterbend properly for the first time, but they soon see the approaching ship heading for the village. They race back as Sokka scrambles to prepare their meager defenses. They don't understand why the firebenders would suddenly return, and Gran Gran tells them they are there for Aang. He is the Avatar. Zuko leads his men to the village gate and demands they hand over the Avatar in exchange for the Wolf Cove's safety. Sokka is prepared to turn Aang in, but Katara convinces him they cannot hand over the world's last hope of defeating the Fire Nation. Sokka challenges Zuko to single combat with the condition that he and his men leave if he wins. Zuko accepts, and after a brief fight Sokka is incapacitated. Before Zuko can kill him, Aang steps in to defend him. The villagers try to fight back against the firebenders, but Zuko loses his patience and orders the village to be destroyed. Aang offers to surrender if they leave the tribe in peace. Zuko accepts, and the firebenders leave with Aang. Katara tells Sokka they have to try and help him, and Sokka puts the next oldest teen in charge and gives orders for the village's defense, before getting ready to follow the ship.

Aang is locked away in the Fire Nation vessel, and is visited by Iroh. Aang asks him why the Fire Nation started the war, and Iroh does his best to explain. Once they finish talking, Iroh and the guards leave, but not before Aang uses his precision airbending to swipe the guard's keys. At Wolf Cove, Katara and Sokka find Appa and get him to fly them to the ship. Aang sneaks out of his cell and finds Zuko's chambers. The prince has found dozens of Avatar relics, and has a notebook full of research. Aang takes the notebook and recovers his airbender glider staff, and makes his way to the main deck, but is spotted and pursued. He uses his glider to fly away, but is shot down by Zuko. He is caught by Sokka and Katara on Appa, and Katara is able to waterbend a wall of water to protect them as they make their escape. Unable to return to the village for fear the firebenders will follow them, they flee to the Southern Air Temple.

They find the temple an overgrown ruin from the Fire Nation's attack. Aang goes to the shrine of Yengchen, and finds Gyatso's body. He breaks down in sadness and rage, and his tattoos and eyes again begin to glow. He creates a windstorm in his wake that decimates the shrine and nearly blows Sokka and Katara off the mountain. Katara appeals to him to stop, but Aang is nearly consumed by his despair. He remember the words of Monk Gyatso, and eventually comes out of his state. Katara embraces him as he mourns the death of his people. Later, the trio try to figure out what to do next. Aang decides to follow the monks' last instructions, to learn the other three elements, and find a way to bring balance back to the world. Back on the ship, Zuko resolves to hunt Aang down no matter what."

The three detectives plan to go undercover at the prison, with a Deputy Winston as their inside contact. They are soon picked up for speeding and hitchhiking, and the officer plants drugs in their car before hauling them off to the Pine Parish Prison. Winston mentions that Elizabeth was not the first woman to go missing from the prison. Once there, the tough female guard Maxine notes that they are ""jackpot"" candidates for ""the house"" and makes them shower and change into uniforms. They observe fancy cocktail dresses hanging nearby, but are not told what they are for before they are shown to their bunks.

The next day, the three prisoners are made to dig potatoes in a field. While there, they talk to other inmates and ask about Elizabeth, learning that she was last seen being taken to the infirmary. Kelly () talks to Linda () and learns that the dresses are for ""parties,"" but they are interrupted by a guard, Carl (), before Linda can elaborate. She warns Kelly not to cross Carl, as he attempted to rape Elizabeth shortly before her disappearance. At lunch, Jill () fakes illness in order to search the infirmary. Sabrina () and Kelly meet Warden Sorenson, who inquires kindly after their well-being. In the hospital, Jill snoops and finds Elizabeth's file, also noting that she signed in, but not out, of the infirmary after being attacked by Carl a month ago. Later, the girls are told to dress in the cocktail dresses because they are going to a party, an ""invitation"" they cannot refuse. Once there, Sorenson, clearly the madam, tells them that they can avoid working in the fields after their third ""party"" prostituting themselves to the male guests, all prison suppliers. Jill meets with a ""client"" and charms him into talking about Elizabeth, and he says that she tried to escape and is likely dead. Jill makes it to a phone and tries to call Winston, but is caught and told that he has ""resigned permanently."" They deny asking anything about Elizabeth, but they are chained together and placed in a car, with Carl threatening them with death.

The girls manage to escape the car by strangling the guards with their chains and crashing, but the guards are soon hot on their trail with bloodhounds. They find a filling station and remove their chains, and Sabrina gets the idea to throw the dogs off with the scent of gas. They hijack a potato truck and are chased by the jailers, who eventually meet their end in a fiery crash. Back at the office, Charlie says that the governor commends their actions and is looking into other prisons, and that the Pine Parish staff is awaiting trial. Christine, though heartbroken over her sister's death, is grateful for their work. And Linda, released from the prison, arrives and joins the office as their new receptionist."

Kelly is found alone, shot in the head (flesh wound that puts her on deaths door) at the amusement park. Sabrina, Jill and Bosley eventually learn that Kelly was at the park with her ""date"", an autistic boy named Skip to who she has been acting as a big sister. Skip was found abandoned when he was six years old.

Lying in a hospital bed and a stranger comes in announcing he's the father. He's actually a guy who lost the gun which had been used to kill a small time hood at the park earlier that day, which the boy found and shot Kelly with.

She reveals all to him about the little boy (like where he most likely is) and realizes the minute AFTER she gets a sedative injected that she's done wrong.

So she gets dressed and leaves the hospital in a taxi, swooning around an amusement park to save the day. She's single-handedly starts fighting (and losing to) the two bad guys. Fortunately, the taxi driver she begged to call Bosley actually did, and within seconds the whole group, plus cops show up just as the men point their guns at Kelly. ""Cheese it! It's the fuzz!""

Bullets start flying, yet the cops must be having coffee.

The only people who can catch the bad guy are the angels. PS: He ran out of bullets, so it was easy. They caught him in the centrifuge. They spun him until he lost his gun and then let him spin some more.

Now, the woman who abandoned him in the first place gets full custody while Kelly, in shorts and barefoot and Sabrina and Jill in full on 70s elephant bells (and shoes) stare at the now happy little boy fishing at the oceans edge.

A young girl (Katelyn Reed) stands outside a dilapidated house, looking at it. Two twin boys (Kai & Bodhi Schulz), who appear up to no good, stroll up the walkway to the house. The young girl warns them that they ""are going to die in there!"" The boys enter and ransack the house, smashing most everything breakable in sight. They come across a dying animal, but their attention is soon drawn to the opening door leading to the basement. Downstairs, they see shelves filled with different oddities. They soon discover they are not alone in the dark, as both of them are attacked by something in the shadows.

In the present, after recently suffering a miscarriage, a doctor (Andy Umberger) gives Vivien Harmon (Connie Britton) a prescription for hormone replacement pills. After filling the prescription, she arrives home to what she presumes is an empty house, yet is startled by a noise. Armed with a knife, she goes upstairs to the door of the room where the noise appears to be from. After finding her husband, Ben (Dylan McDermott), in bed with another woman, she slices his arm when he tries to stop her and explain.

Almost a year later, the Harmons plan to move from Boston to Los Angeles, in hopes of repairing any mental and physical damage to their family. They are greeted by a realtor (Christine Estabrook) at a house with an interior that seems familiar to us. Daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) is told check and see what the dog is barking at. She finds him at a basement door. The curious girl checks out what appears to be an empty basement, but the camera angle makes us think differently. Back upstairs, the realtor gives ""full disclosure"" on the history of the house, telling the family of the murder/suicide that occurred in the basement. Violet, out of morbid curiosity, speaks up that they'll take the house. The old house from 1978 has been renovated and has new owners - the Harmons.

The adult Harmons still have a long road of healing ahead of them, but Ben begins trying to be intimate with Vivien. She's just not ready. On her first day of school, the new girl, Violet, already breaks the rules by smoking on school grounds. She is informed of them, rather rudely, by a clique of girls (Christian Serratos & Bianca Lawson). Their leader, Leah (Shelby Young), tries to force Violet to eat the cigarette. Violet spits in her face and runs off, smiling.

At home, Vivien decides to remove the wallpaper in the house and uncovers the first of many strange murals. Her work is interrupted by the grown-up version of the girl we saw at the start of show - Adelaide (Jamie Brewer) - and her mother, Constance (Jessica Lange). These are the Harmon's neighbors. Constance, we learn, used to be a movie star, balking once when they asked her to do nude scenes. She gave up acting, once she became pregnant with Addy, the ""mongoloid"" as she describes her daughter. Constance admires Vivien's diamond earrings, after we see her pocket some silverware. She also gives Vivien a housewarming present - a container of sage to burn and get rid of the ""bad Juju.""

Later, that evening, Vivian does so and hears wind whistling up in the attic. There, she finds out that the house hasn't entirely been cleaned out, coming across a black leather sex suit. She has Ben to throw it in the trash outside, which he complies.

The next day, Ben begins his LA psychiatric work with a young lad named Tate (Evan Peters). Tate tells Ben of his dreams, wherein he paints himself in skull-face and kills people he likes in order to rescue them from the ""filthy world."" He also speaks to Ben of bloodletting (an Indian ritual of ridding the body of evil spirits) as Violet cuts herself repeatedly in the bathroom. Tate interrupts her, by giving her proper instructions if she was trying to kill herself.

That night, naked and sleepwalking, Ben lights a large fire in the fireplace. The next day while hanging laundry out to dry, Vivien meets a matronly Moira (Frances Conroy) who gives her housekeeping tips. While waiting inside for a cab, Moira tells Vivien of her history with the house. Vivien hires her on the spot to be the current housekeeper. When Ben arrives and is introduced to the new housekeeper, he sees an entirely different Moira (Alexandra Breckinridge). He praises his wife for making the risky move of hiring what he presumes to be a young sultry maid.

Tate speaks to Ben about the meds he's taking, adding that he doesn't really need them because he has a new love, who is listening in - Violet. Together at last, Tate and Violet speak of common interests, while he writes a brief message on her chalkboard. (TAINT) Ben finds them together and tells Tate to leave. The boy knows he's not supposed to be in Violet's room.

After taking a shower and missing his razor blades, Ben finds Moira taking a ""break"" - pleasuring herself. After a moment of his own self-pleasure, Ben hears someone outside. He looks to find a disfigured man in the airing laundry. Ben runs outside to an empty yard. While putting away groceries, Vivien hears a noise and turns to find all kitchen cabinets and doors open. She hears Adelaide laughing in the doorway and scolds her for being in the house yet again, but Adelaide knows who the culprits are, this time - the ghosts of the twins we saw at top of show.

Even after Constance tells Vivien that Adelaide may have been wrong in whatever was done, Vivien still stresses her point to Addy. She grabs the sides of Addy's face and warns her to stop sneaking into their house. After ensuring Adelaide is out of earshot, Constance threatens bodily harm to Vivien, should she touch her daughter again.

Ben tries to warn the school of Tate's underlying violence and is given the run-around. Moira, still appearing young to Ben, comes in to clean the room and tries to seduce him. He keeps asking her to leave, but she refuses, then they are interrupted. Violet sees Moira as her mother does - the older matronly lady. At school, Violet gets physically attacked by the clique.

Vivien nearly finishes her mural reveal, and Ben helps in the cleanup. He admires her unkempt natural beauty and tries to get frisky again, but she will have none of it. This leads to a heated argument between the two, which, in turn, leads to a passionate makeup session on the couch. Later, Mom nurses her daughter's war wounds while sorta defending Ben to her. Looking for payback for her bully, Violet turns to Tate for help, who suggests bringing the girl to the basement for a fake drug deal and scaring her.

The leather suit, mobile (Riley Schmidt), re-appears and Vivien thinks it's Ben seeking ""round two."" She complies and has sex with the man in black. Meanwhile, Ben is sleepwalking into the kitchen, turning on all the burners on the gas stove. Constance stops him because ""it's not his time."" He returns to bed, where a bewildered Vivien and he profess love to another.

With the bait fallen for, Violet leads Leah down to the basement of the house. She tells her the drugs are in the next room, but only Tate is there. Thus begins our first of many creepy show moments, as Tate summons the creature in the basement. The scene is done in a strobe effect, making it hard to decipher without a pause button. What can be seen is a small human-like creature (Ben Woolf) with rows of pointy teeth and clawlike hands. It menaces Violet and holds Leah down on the floor, clawing deeply into her face. She runs off crying. Violet screams at Tate for going too far on the scare tactics. He yells back at her.

The next day, Ben gets followed by the disfigured guy from the yard on his jogging route. He tricks the guy and ends up catching him off guard. Ben demands answers. The scarred man, Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), reveals that he was a previous tenant of Ben's new home. He set fire to the house, killing his wife and kids, and burning himself. After creeping Ben out with threats against his family, Ben fires back that he could have the man committed if he continues to harass them. When Ben storms off, the man smiles knowing that the seed of insanity has been planted in Ben's mind.

Moira catches Constance stealing Vivien's diamond earrings. Constance claims they'll think it was the maid and also has her own threat. ""Don't make me kill you again!"" Downstairs, Vivien asks Ben what he wants for supper. He asks for suggestions and she offers Indian food. He states that she only craves Indian food while she's pregnant. She casts him a knowing smile. Ben hugs her and it's difficult to discern if he's a relieved father or worried one. Meanwhile, the other candidate for paternity - a figure in black - looks on."

So begins AHS's second episode - Home Invasion. The house we know that had once been owned by a doctor to the stars now houses female students enrolled in nursing school. Three of them are going to the Hollywood Bowl to see The Doors in concert. Two other ""squares"" pass up the chance and stay home to study. One, Maria (Rosa Salazar), makes the mistake of opening the front door to a presumed-wounded stranger. ""Franklin"" (Jamie Harris) proves to the two nurses his aversion for women in that particular career field and shows us the first detailed crime to take place in our current favorite house. Both women die in particularly gruesome fashions and the stranger disappears.

In the present, Tate (Evan Peters), in his own way, makes his intentions known to Ben (Dylan McDermott) about Violet (Taissa Farmiga), Ben's daughter, including graphic details about wanting to have sex with her. Ben ends their session early. Ben has been avoiding his ringing cell phone. After telling the caller about their arranged agreement to not speak anymore, we learn who Ben had the fling with a year ago and that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, perhaps feeling guilty about the attack in the basement, Violet becomes friends with Leah (Shelby Young) who now dons a floppy hat to cover graying-from-fear hair.

Later that night, the house burglar alarm goes off, but that doesn't dissuade Tate from watching Violet sleep. Ben searches the house, and the open door down into the basement, to find neighbor Adelaide (Jamie Brewer) playing in the basement. He leaves, thinking she was playing alone, and we see a ball being rolled back to where Addy had been.

Ben takes on a new patient: Bianca Forest (Mageina Tovah), a struggling actress, who dreams of being cut in half trying escape a Carpenters song playing on a stalled elevator. Ben suggests the dream represents some inner, unresolved pain. ""I just think I'm afraid of getting chopped in half."" While on the phone with Tate's mother, trying to get out of that professional relationship, Bianca appears in the room with Ben. He thought she had left. She does leave, but after looking around the place.

Constance (Jessica Lange), the neighbor for which we have a love/hate thing, cooks in her own kitchen while explaining to Addy why she doesn't look like the magazine models. ""You were born with...other gifts."" We, nor Addy, aren't told exactly with those gifts are, but Addy is allowed to add to the recipe for cupcakes for the neighbors - her own spit and Ipecac syrup.

Ben, as per usual, comes across Mr. Harvey (Denis O'Hare) on his jog. Larry tells Ben he must lie to his wife to cover up the predicament with his former fling. Constance delivers the special-made cupcakes to the Harmons. She offers them as an apology for all of Adelaide's unlawful entries, yet insists they are for Violet alone. After sensing that Vivien is with child, Constance relates tales of herself being a mother, not only to Addy but to three other children - two of which had Down's syndrome as well, the other was ""a model of physical perfection...lost to other things."" This, including talk of her former screen-godlike husband, saddens Constance.

That night, Vivien takes a cupcake to Violet, who feels left out about the pregnancy news. She thinks her mother is too old and ""weak"" to be a mother again. Refusing the cupcake, Violet sets it outside her door. In Boston, we and Ben meet Hayden (Kate Mara), a needy clingy psych student. She insists to Ben that she's fine without him now. She just needs his support to cope with the upcoming abortion. However when he checks his phone to see if his wife has called, Hayden freaks out and forces him to turn over his phone.

During Ben's excursion, Vivien hears the doorbell in the middle of the night. Forty years after the opening scene, another stranger needs help - with the same ""injuries"" as Franklin back then. Vivien appears smarter than the naive nurses of long ago and does not open the door for the wounded woman, yet offers to call 911 for her. It is then we see the outsider already has inside help. Two hooded invaders, one of which is Bianca, must have found Addy's way inside.

The three intruders (Kyle Davis, Azura Skye, & M. Tovah) intend on recreating the murders we saw at show's opening, because ""Franklin was the first. Before Manson. He changed the culture."" Vivien and Violet were to be dressed up like nurses. What the intruders didn't count on was a) the house was intent on protecting its current inhabitants on this night, and b) the current inhabitants are stronger women than the 1968 nurses. First, Violet breaks free and is pulled into a pantry by Tate, who tells her to somehow ""get them into the basement.""

Vivien, meanwhile, sees Adelaide behind her attacker and phrases her words to instruct her neighbor to seek help. Upstairs, the lady intruders prepare the bathroom crime scene for Violet. Bianca finds the cupcake and eats it. Violet tells her captor that the scene is wrong. The original bathtub was downstairs, in the basement.

Next door, Constance entertains her male ""business associate,"" perhaps to train him in some pillow talk. Adelaide knocks on the bedroom door to try to explain about the ""bad man"" next door. Constance thinks she speaks of Ben and shoos her away. When Addy interrupts the tryst again, Constance locks her daughter in a mirror-filled Bad Girl closet as punishment. ""Look at yourself. Look at yourself hard.""

Once Tate knows that Violet has put his plan into place, he makes Bianca realize her worst fears and embeds an ax into her midriff - twice. He then appears in the basement, calling out Violet's attacker. When she draws near to the tub, its original victim's ghost appears in it. Vivian escapes the male attacker, who thinks she has entered the open basement door and follows her into the tub room. The two ghost nurses await him, as well.

At the abortion clinic, Ben checks his neglected cell phone to see he's missed a few calls - only 13. Back home, two of our latest victims lie dead in the basement, their throats ripped open like the twins in 1978 (Episode 1). Constance appears alongside Tate and Moira (Frances Conroy), asking if the intruders' demise were his handiwork. He says no. Regardless, the three have a mess to clean up.

The police (Drew Powell & Scott Lawrence) have lost track of two intruders - the third was found cut in half - but are confident in finding them. Violet burns her dad for not being there for them, and for thinking she let Tate in the house. She said at least Tate was here. Then praises her mother for being brave through the ordeal. Our episode ends with Vivian telling Ben not to call the place ""home"" anymore. ""We're selling this house!"""

Young Moira (Alexandra Breckinridge) is going about her duties in the master bedroom. The male owner of the house suggests an afternoon rendezvous with her. She refuses for several reasons - she really needs the job, he's drunk and the last time they had one was a mistake. When she tries to leave, he tackles her onto the bed and attempts to rape her. During his attempt, a shadowy female figure approaches the room with a gun. She fires a warning shot into a vanity mirror, interrupting them. Constance (Jessica Lange) is the gun-bearer and she has had enough of her lover and the maid's trysts. After shooting Moira through her right eye, Constance tells the man she has loved him since she was 16. With her gun, she then takes her anger out on the man. Constance cries out her emotional pain of betrayal and what the outcome has caused her to do.

Through some nifty camerawork, Vivien (Connie Britton) enters the exact same scene and we are thrust into the present. She and Ben (Dylan McDermott) are arguing about him being deceitful with her - not in the way we think. It's about an investment deal gone wrong and she cautions Ben to not lie to her again.

The next day, Vivien meets with the realtor (Christine Estabrook) about putting the house on the market. The realtor complains that it would be difficult, given the current financial state of the country. Vivien remains firm, threatening to sue for not receiving full disclosure on the house. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Moira tells Ben she made a fresh pot of coffee and hands him an empty cup.

Later, older Moira (Frances Conroy) catches Constance taking some Harmon silverware to add to her ""magpie"" collection. Constance tells her to let things go and ""Move on, missy!"" When Moira breaks down and says she can't, Constance lets her know that she feels no remorse for Moira whenever she looks at that ghostly eye of hers.

Ben has a new patient, Sally Freeman (Adina Porter), who has marital difficulty. She doesn't know why, because she has tried her best to like the things her husband likes. She begins to list all the things she has tried and Ben enters a sort of fugue state, from either boredom or something else. He then finds himself outside, in the backyard, with blood on his hands.

Inside, young Moira cleans up a bloody mess and follows him into his office, where she began her cleaning. Once again, she tries to coerce him into a fling, but they are interrupted, this time by Vivian. Vivian doesn't really know who to believe. Older Moira claims Ben approached her, which is understandable from the stress put upon him. Vivian suggests Moira take some time off. Moira fires back with threats of pressing charges.

Later, outside, Vivien sees the Eternal Darkness Tour vehicle pull up. The guide (David Anthony Higgins) calls her house, the Murder House. Also outside, Ben finds Violet (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn't hidden her smoking from him very well. He offers to find her help if she needs someone, aside from family, to talk to. But the person she seems to confide in is always near - Tate (Evan Peters).

Ben approaches young Moira about the whereabouts of his recorder he uses in his patient sessions. Moira suggests it might be down the front of her dress. She then tells Ben he has a new patient in waiting. The new patient is Hayden (Kate Mara), the woman with whom Ben had an affair and got pregnant. We last saw her at the abortion clinic with him. She changed her mind when he bailed on her. Police Detective Jack Colquitt (Geoffrey Rivas) interrupts them and Ben thinks he's there with question about the previous break-in. But he tells Ben he's there to ask about to a missing patient of his - the woman with marital trouble.

We learn, via the tour guide, how actor Sal Mineo (Aric Cushing) allegedly died - stabbed in an alley after making sexual advances on a guy (Trevor Torseth). Vivien has become a ticket holder on the tour, in order to learn more about her house.

In the 1920s, ""Doctor To The Stars"" Charles Montgomery (Matt Ross) moved his wife Nora (Lily Rabe) to the house in L.A., only to fall on hard times and become addicted to different drugs. He developed a ""Frankenstein complex."" One night at the dinner table, they squabble over numerous things, including money. Nora tells him she's arranged for him to help out women ""in trouble,"" in order to have additional income. Their first patient, Dorothy Hudson (Abbie Cobb), arrives, and Nora calms her by giving her a sedative for what's to come, while politely asking for cash up front. Nora turns her over to Charles, with tears in her own eyes. Before we can learn how the Montgomery's lives came to a ""shocking finale,"" Vivien notices she is spotting blood.

The OB/GYN, Dr. Hall (Eve Gordon), tells the Harmons that spotting blood during pregnancy is normal, but that there can be no more stress put upon Vivien. Under his own stress and possibly something else, Ben briefly faints. The doctor suggests blood work to determine the cause.

While taking a few of her canine ""clients"" for a walk, Constance notices Tate in the window of the Harmon house. She waves, but he remains stoic. Accompanying Ben during his outdoor exercise, Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare) attempts to run lines with Ben, then solicits $1,000 from him for ""headshots."" Still panicked over losing his patient recorder, Ben searches high and low in his office for it and ends up in the backyard again. This time, he has a shovel nearby and is joined by Constance. Strangely, Moira looks on while Constance tries to convince Ben of building a gazebo in the backyard, rather than planting things.

Inside, Vivien gets a visit from someone she believes is a potential buyer of the house. The woman seems to have an intimate knowledge of the house's design. Upon entering the kitchen, she flinches and winces at the modern appliances. Vivien offers her some tea to calm her. Vivien's visitor is confirmed (to us) to be not of this world, as the camera pans behind her to show a gaping head wound. ""Nora"" learns Vivien is pregnant and vanishes into thin air.

While landscaping, Ben is told by the detective that his missing patient, as well as his recorder, has turned up. The recording reveals what really happened during Ben's ""fugue"" state with the patient. She thought he had tuned her out and was ignoring her, so she slit her wrists and ran, taking the recorder with her. Violet accompanies Vivien to look at a new place. She tells her mom that they survived being victims of the intrusion; and, if they move again, she will run away and never be found.

Dr. Hall calls Ben about his bloodwork. The narcotic, Laudanum, appeared in his system. (Until the early 20th century, laudanum was sold without a prescription.) Before answering the door, Ben tells young Moira he knows she drugged him. She tells him to prove it. At the door is an angry Hayden intent on telling Vivien their secret.

Ben decides to take her somewhere to talk about future plans, but Larry has plans of his own for her. Outside, he landscapes her face with a shovel - twice. Ben freaks out. At first, he's sorry for Hayden, then worried he'll be implicated for her death. Larry tells him to leave things to him, while again asking for the $1000.

Larry prepares to bury Hayden in the backyard and thanks Ben for starting the hole. He finds the hole has been previously occupied. Among the remains, he finds a doily-type material similar to a collar of a certain maid's uniform. She oversees her ""excavation"" from the window. Will she finally be free?

Not today, as Larry drops Hayden's body on top of Moira's remains and begins to bury the two. Later, Ben covers the gravesite with a concrete foundation. Constance needles Moira that now she's ""stuck here forever."" The Harmons delight in the new gazebo - Vivien, because it adds to the value of the house; Ben, because it covers up two mistakes regarding Hayden.

That night, while Vivien sleeps, the ghostly Nora watches over the new mother."

Chad is carving pumpkins and discussing the perfect details he needs to ready the house for a Halloween party, or Halloqueen party as Patrick jokes. They are a gay couple who planned to flip the house and start a family but the house hasn't sold and they are at odds. Chad accuses Patrick of cheating which he admits to and brags about. Chad doesn't care and states that this party will allow them to sell the house and be free so Patrick better get with the plan and dress the part. Patrick leaves to the gym and to get supplies and a costume. Chad fusses with the decor and then sees a man in the rubber suit. Thinking that its Patrick in costume Chad is unprepared as the man in the black rubber suit plunges him into the apple bobbing tub and breaks his neck. Patrick enters in his cowboy costume just in time to hear his neck snap.

Now we are in the present and Christine Estabrook (Marcy) the real estate agent is convincing McDermott (Ben) and Britton(Vivian) to hire a fluffer to repair the house's image problem with Halloween decor. (So far the only vistors have been people who have died in the house: the doctors wife and the twin boys who egg the place). Marcy recommends a young gay to spruce the place up.

Next we see Lange (Constance), her boytoy Graziadei (Travis) and her daughter Brewer (Addy) in the kitchen next door. Travis and Addy are getting along, discussing Halloween costumes and eating chocolate chips. Constance doesn't like this and sends Travis to the store. She lectures Addy about her affection for Travis and states that;I will not share any men I bring into this house with anyone ever. Then Addy says she wants to be a pretty girl for Halloween and Constance laughs and says she will be snoopy. Addy says the dead will walk among us on Halloween and Constance says we have always known that. Now no more Halloween rubbish and send Travis to my room when he returns.

Ben answers the doorbell and the burned man O'Hare (Larry)is there demanding $1000 and threatens to out Ben's secrets under the gazebo. Ben shuts the door on him and returns to a conversation with Peters (Tate) about not being able to treat him anymore since he has been hanging around outside the house trying to see his daughter Farminga (Violet). However, Tate has not been seeing the other doctor he recommended so they agree to meet elsewhere for coffee.

Vivian has hired a security officer and updated the home security system with panic buttons. Conroy the old maid (Moira) is carving pumpkins in the kitchen and asks for Halloween off to visit her mother. Vivian takes a pumpkin to the porch to find Patrick and Chad outside discussing the greenery outside. She assumes they are the fluffers that Marcy hired. Chad and Patrick bicker about Patrick's past infidelities as they discuss decor plans with Vivian. They want to destroy the gazebo right after Halloween. Ben cuts himself and Patrick goes with him to help find the first aid kit. As soon as they are out of sight Patrick reaches for Ben's crotch and propositions him. He says they are similarly obeying husbands at home and quite the opposite outside the home and no one will know if he spends 4 minutes giving Ben oral sex. Ben insists he is straight. Patrick asks Ben not to tell Chad. Meanwhile Chad and Vivian are discussing cheating spouses and Chad tells Vivian that he was a snoop and got proof Patrick was cheating on him because you can erase a text but you can't erase a cell phone bill.

Addy scares Violet by crawling out from under her bed and asks her to make her pretty. They discuss Tate and that he likes Violet and that Violet is a virgin. Constance catches Addy with makeup on and yells at her and threatens to hurt Violet.

Violet goes to meet Tate in the basement at midnight and the rubber man grabs her violently only to start laughing and take off his hood revealing himself as Tate. She insists she wasn't scared so Tate says he will scare her. They use a ouija board to contact doctor Ross (Charles) because he used to live in the house. The story goes that the doctor and his wife Rabe (Nora) performed many abortions until a girl told her boyfriend who then wanted revenge and he took the couples baby and killed it. The doctor used his frankenstein experiments on the child and created an ungodly monster that remains in the basement even now. Violet doesn't believe him and asks to hang out somewhere else on a real date. They make plans for Halloween and Violet sneaks him out. And something blows out the candles they leave burning.

Tate and Ben meet for coffee and see a little girl dressed up and they start talking about Violet as a child and Ben as a child. He was surprised he became a doctor after being a troubled kid.

Constance surprises Addy with a full mask of a pretty girl and offers an old dress as well so she can dress up. Ben is getting dressed as a vampire and Vivian suddenly says ""How's Mara (Hayden). I told you that if you lied to me one more time that we were done."" She looked at the phone records and saw Haydens calls. Ben keeps lying and says hes been avoiding her and telling her not to call back and she has finally stopped calling and that he didn't see her when he went to Boston. Vivian says she left Hayden a message and Ben says she won't call back. But then the phone rings and its Hayden but they don't answer.

Patrick and Chad have a fight with Ben and Vivian about their outfits and the type of apples they bought. Then Ben and Vivian ask them to go. Chad and Patrick tell them that Ben and Vivian should be the ones leaving, ""its not their house, the house knows and they know that they don't deserve it."" Ben and Vivian tell Chad and Patrick to leave and they say they won't. Vivian flips out and Chad and Patrick go. She tells Ben that she doesn't believe him and his lies. She tells Ben to leave and then the baby starts hurting her, They go to the hospital and tell Violet to stay home and not answer the door.

Addy tries to trick or treat at Violets and runs into some pretty girls they tease her and take off and she races after them and gets hit and left for dead by a car crossing the street. At the hospital the baby seems to be awfully big for 8 weeks and the nurse faints as she looks at the image, Constance runs up to Addy's body in the street and wants to move her to the lawn before she dies. She drags her across the street but its too late.

Moira visits her mother in a home and is distraught that she was not around for her. She removes her mothers (Molly) breathing tube and she flatlines. Molly's ghost appears and asks Moira to come with her but Moira can't.

Violet hears knocking and the doorbell rings. Frank is yelling trough the door about his $1000 Ben owes him and says he won't leave without it. She calls Ben and he says just keep the door locked, Frank says "" I know you're in there, is that your daughter?"" And we see the man in the rubber suit standing behind Violet. Ben and Vivian come home to the alarm going off and an open door and no Violet. There's a knock at the door and its Hayden and Ben slams the door shut.

When she turns to face him, there's nothing there. She goes to her room and pauses briefly by the bed. She hears something at the window and goes toward it. A muddy hand reaches from underneath the bed, failing to grab her ankle. Violet goes downstairs and meets with Tate (Evan Peters), who tells her that the person pounding on the door was probably just a neighbor kid playing a prank. He gives Violet a black-painted rose and takes her on their date.

Ben (Dylan McDermott) and Vivien (Connie Britton) arrive at the house and hear the alarm going off. While Vivien searches upstairs for their daughter, Ben hears a knock at the door and answers it, and finds a ghostly Hayden (Kate Mara) at the door. As he slams the door shut, Vivien reaches Violet via phone. She's out on the beach with Tate, and assures her mother that she's fine and out with friends. When Vivien asks who was pounding on the door, Violet says that it was just neighbor kids playing a prank. Her mother tells her to be home in an hour and Violet agrees.

Vivien goes to find Ben, who has grabbed a knife from the kitchen rack. He says that the neighbor kids destroyed their pumpkins but Vivien points out that killing them with a knife might not be a good idea. She says that they've had a long day and she's going to take a bath, that they'll talk about Ben moving out the next day. As his wife leaves, Ben insists that he's not moving out and he's not giving up on their family.

Ben goes outside, grabs a shovel, and heads to the gazebo. Larry approaches him, asking for his $1,000. Ben hits him with the shovel and then slams him into the gazebo. He figures that Larry and Hayden set things up, and that she isn't dead or buried beneath the gazebo. Larry tells Ben that the dead have nothing left to lose and laughs, but Ben knocks him down and starts beating him. When Larry says that Hayden is more dangerous than ever, Ben grabs him by the neck and says that if he goes down, he'll take Larry with him. Larry dares Ben to kill him so that he can come back and haunt him. Ben grabs the shovel and considers beating Larry some more, but then tells him to stay off the property and walks away.

Vivien answers the doorbell and talks to the security company rep, Luke (Morris Chestnut), who came to investigate the alarms. She tells him that Violet set off the alarms and that he has nothing to worry about.

On the beach, Tate and Violet are kissing. Violet wants to have sex. Tate says that he wants to but he can't, and suggests that the medications that Ben has been giving him have made him impotent. Violet prepares to leave, but Tate says that he's not ready to go. He holds her tight and talks about his idols were all high school dropouts, and that Violet shouldn't get stuck there. Five high school students approach them, all apparently made up as accident victims. They know Tate and congratulate him on showing his face for the first time in years after hiding in his mommy's house. Tate tells them not to harm Violet, but they say that they want Tate and threaten to kill him. Violet, unimpressed, thinks it's all a joke. They wonder why Tate gets a girlfriend and say they haven't had sex in a long time. Tate grabs Violet and leads her away while the five students watch.

Vivien is preparing to get in the bath when Hayden calls on her cell phone. Hayden asks if Ben has told her about Boston, and Vivien tells her that she also fell in love with a married man and had the fantasy that she'd be with him. However, it didn't happen that way and Vivien says that it never does because men like that are ""missing something."" Hayden says that Ben found something in her that he doesn't with Vivien, and describes them in bed together. Vivien snaps, saying that she regrets not ripping Hayden's face off when she caught her in bed with Ben. Hayden says that it's too late now and tells her to ask Ben about Boston, and Vivien throws the phone down. Vivien then starts to get undressed, but looks at the mirror and sees the words ""ASK HIM"" drawn in the steam.

Vivien runs downstairs and tells Ben that Hayden is in the house, and she's going to call the police. Ben insists that she's overreacting and that if the police show up on Halloween, it will ruin their chances of selling the house. He goes to the kitchen, grabs a knife, and walks downstairs to the cellar to find Hayden. Hayden speaks out, saying that she loves him saying her name, and Ben tells her that she has to go. She points out that slamming the door in her face was a mean thing to do and reminds him that he's the father of her child. Hayden asks him to kiss her, insisting that she's aching for him, and then spits out some of her own internal organs. She then remembers what he did to her and complains that he buried her under a gazebo and discarded her like she didn't even exist. Ben demands to know what she wants. Hayden says that she wants Vivien to know the truth about him. Larry comes up behind Ben and clubs him unconscious with the shovel. He then apologizes to Hayden for killing her. She says that she'll deal with him later and goes after Vivien, and Larry pulls out his lighter and asks to help.

Vivien looks outside and sees Chad (Zachary Quinto) smashing the Halloween decorations. She confronts him and Chad says that all he wanted was one perfect Halloween night. Vivien ruined it and now Chad figures that Patrick (Teddy Sears) is out having sex at a gay bar. Vivien threatens to call the security company and Chad tells her that no one can protect her now. She runs into the house and locks the door as Chad screams at her to get out of the house.

In the upstairs bathroom, Hayden soaks in the tub. Vivien calls out to Ben and tries the door to the bathroom, only to discover it locked. The dog, Hallie, starts barking and Vivien goes to investigate. She sees smoke pouring out from under a door and investigates, and finds a towel on fire.

Violet goes to her room with Tate, asking who the students on the beach were and how they knew him. He insists that they're just popular kids that were trying to be cruel. Before Violet can respond, they hear dogs barking outside. Violet goes to the window and sees the five students coming into the yard, and grabs a pair of scissors.

Vivien walks through the house, calling for Ben, when her phone rings. She goes into the bathroom to get it and answers it. Hayden says that she didn't want to let the bathtub water go to waste. Vivien realizes that Hayden was in the tub and asks where she was. Hayden calls someone over and says that she loves what Vivien has done with the kitchen. Grabbing a golf club, Vivien goes into the kitchen. She finds a disturbed dog dish and something exploding in the microwave.

Violet goes outside to confront the students, threatening to call the cops. Unimpressed, they tell Violet that she's deeply disturbed and she tells them to go home. One of the girls, Chloe, say that after what happened, her parents split up, moved away, and left her without a home. Kyle says that he lost his football scholarship. They figure that she's in love with Tate and will give him her virginity despite what he did to them. When Violet asks what Tate did to them, they realize that she doesn't know. The students tell her to find a newspaper or their Westfield High yearbook. Tate runs out and tells them to leave Violet alone, and for her to go inside. He runs away and they chase him down the street, while Violet calls the police. Constance (Jessica Lange) comes up and grabs her, demanding that Violet come to her house and that Adelaide (Jamie Brewer) is dead because of her.

Vivien goes to her bedroom, activates the security silent alarm, and hears something in the closet. She opens the door and Hallie runs out. As Vivien goes after the dog, she sees Hayden standing in the doorway. Hayden says that she wants the truth to be known once and for all. She asks Vivien what she thinks Ben is capable of. Vivien says that she knows Ben all too well. Hayden asks if she thinks Ben could commit murder. Unimpressed, Vivien tells her to leave but Hayden insists that Vivien has to know exactly who she's married to and they have to talk about Boston and her pregnancy. Vivien assumes that Hayden is talking about her pregnancy, and Hayden realizes that was why Ben said the abortion was her choice. Vivien now knows that Hayden is also pregnant. Sobbing, Hayden smashes a family photo, picks up a piece of glass, and tells Vivien that Ben didn't want her to keep their baby because he already had one with Vivien. Hayden then advances on Vivien, wielding the piece of glass like a knife.

Downstairs, Larry is pouring out gasoline around the room, when Chad comes in and asks what he has planned for his house. Ben comes to in the basement and discovers that he's been tied up. Nora (Lily Rabe) is standing over him and tells him that he's a disgrace. She asks him how he can allow Hayden to take away the only thing that gives his pathetic life meaning. Nora unties him and says that she will not permit another failure in the house, and tells Ben to save the baby.

Hayden tells Vivien that she has no idea what Ben did to her and that she matters. She warns Vivien that Ben will hurt Vivien and the baby and it's better if they just end it now. She grabs Vivien but Ben comes in and yells for her to stop. Hayden tells him to tell Vivien about Boston and the baby. Ben admits that he went to Boston to be with Hayden. His wife points out that Ben had ended the affair over a year ago, but Ben admits that he went back to Hayden and that he lied to Vivien about that as well. He tells Hayden to put down the knife now that Vivien knows the truth. As Hayden hesitates, Luke arrives in response to the alarm and Vivien tells him that Hayden is the intruder.

Constance brings Violet to her kitchen, serves her tea, and explains that Adelaide wanted to be a pretty girl, but she wasn't pretty in the morgue under the fluorescent lights. She explains that she made Adelaide up as she was saying goodbye. Violet apologizes and Constance says that she was just trying to help, but she was the one who let Adelaide go out into the world. Violet asks for a cigarette and Constance offers her one and lights it up. She explains that Adelaide was a willful child and inherited it from her, and figures that she was more like Constance than her other children. When Violet points out that she didn't know Constance had other children, Constance says that Tate is her son but insists that he can't learn that his sister has passed on. She explains that Tate doesn't react well to certain things and asks Violet to promise not to tell him. Constance says that her son has the soul of a poet but none of the steel that lets him resist the horrors of the world, the steel that she has, that Adelaide had, and that Violet has. She suggests that Tate is attracted to Violet because he craves her strength, and shows Violet a photo of Tate and Adelaide together.

Tate runs to the beach and the five students corner him. One of the girls, Steph (Alessandra Torresani), reminds him that Tate put a gun to her head and asked if she believed in God, and when she said yes, Tate pulled the trigger. Kyle shoves him to the ground and demands to know why he went after them and ruined all their potential. Tate insists that they have the wrong guy and that they're just hallucinations, but Chloe says that they're real and begs him to say what he did. She says that she would have been 34 years old if she hadn't died, but Tate insists that he doesn't know her or the others. As the sun comes up, the five students leave.

Dawn comes and all of the house's victims come back. Moira (Frances Conroy) tells Chad that her mother is dead and he offers his condolences. She admits that she couldn't go with her. Patrick tries to apologize to Chad, saying that he couldn't help himself, but Chad says that he's doomed to be trapped in the house, unable to make it the way he wants. Moira affirms that he is trapped.

As Luke takes Hayden to the police, he says that she's evil and that no one does things like that out of love. Hayden admits that she put tomatoes in the microwave and says that it was a prank. She tells Luke that Ben was the love of her life. She wonders what will happen now and Luke tells her that she's going to jail. As he pulls up to the police station, he goes to open her door, only to discover that Hayden has vanished.

Ben is packing in the bedroom and notices the shattered picture frame. He then goes down to the kitchen and kisses Vivien on the forehead, and then leaves without a word."

A SWAT team bursts in, looking for Tate.

It's 1994 and a normal day at Westfield High. Some students and the librarian (Tom Gallop) mill around in their quiet solitude of bookshelves. Suddenly, somewhere outside the library, several pops are heard. A student bursts through the doors and proceeds to barricade them. He tells those inside that somebody is shooting up the school, shooting people. They barricade the main doors. The shooter enters a forgotten rear door, shooting the librarian trying to hold it shut. Whistling a hauntingly-familiar tune, he begins picking them off, one by one. The shooter is revealed to be Tate (Evan Peters).

Back at the house, the SWAT team has their guns trained on Tate in his bedroom. He stands and mocks them with a simulated gunshot to his head - his nod to the movie Taxi Driver.

In the present, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) searches for the Westfield High massacre on her computer. She recognizes the victims in the pictures - they visited her on Halloween night. She then sees an article of their killer, her love interest, Tate. Horrified, she dashes downstairs to find Constance smoking in the kitchen. Constance, aware that Violet knows about Tate, tells her that she believes the house drove him to do it.

Constance takes Violet to her house to introduce her to Billie Dean (Sarah Paulson), a medium. Billie tells Violet about how she herself was ""chosen,"" and how some confused spirits linger on the earth after their deaths. Constance explains that she wanted Ben to treat Tate, to get him to accept his condition. Constance wants Violet to help Tate move on.

Violet prepares to bail out, thinking it was a setup. Then, to convince Violet that shes for real, Billie asks about ""Mary."" We see a flashback of a dying elderly woman (Linda Porter) telling Violet: ""They don't understand you."" Billie is aware of this and asks Violet if that phrase means anything to her. That creeps out Violet, leaving the two ladies to wonder if they can trust the girl.

Vivien (Connie Britton) sits, looking very pregnant, applying lotion to her belly. The baby inside her, starts clawing at her. Vivien awakes from the nightmare, shaking. Either out of fear or needing adult conversation, she summons Luke (Morris Chestnut), her security guard. Ben (Dylan McDermott) appears, as well. She finds him ""disgusting and disappointing as a man"" and wants him gone. However, he is the income-producer and has to continue his patients' sessions in the house. Vivien relents.

Violet, still shaken by the revelation about Tate, cuts her wrist with a razor blade again then imagines cutting her throat, before she's interrupted by Tate. ""Are you scared now?"" he asks her. Then, as quickly as he shows up, he's gone.

Ben meets with his new patient, Derek (Eric Stonestreet), an insomniac who's paralyzed with terror over urban legends. Recently, hes been afflicted by the Piggy Man, supposedly a hog butcher in Chicago during the 1903 Worlds Fair. The Piggy Man, who disappeared mysteriously, allegedly wore a mask made from one of his kills. Derek tells Ben that, if you stand in front of a mirror and say ""Here Piggy Pig Pig,"" he'll return for the slaughter. Has the patient tried it? No, but something inside of him is afraid that he might just do it. Before they see each other again, Ben says, Derek is going to have to try to shave in a mirror. After the patient leaves, Violet comes in seeking comfort from Ben. ""The darkness,"" she says, ""it has me.""

Vivien, meanwhile, tries to contact the nurse who passed out during her ultrasound. She quit, the hospital tells her.

Constance saunters in, voicing her concern for the pregnant Vivien and offering nutrient-rich pig offal to help the new mother cope with her morning sickness. She asks Moira (Frances Conroy) to saute the piggy parts for Vivien, the way she used to do so for Constance. We need that baby, Constance tells Vivien. We need another sweet child around here.

Moira, frying up the offal, offers some wisdom for Vivien: Mr. Harmon will cheat again. Then, as Vivien is digesting Moira's morsels of truth, the maid serves her the offal with a little sea salt and lemon. She saved the pancreas, though. Its better eaten raw, Moira assures her.

Ben and Derek meet again, as Ben pushes him to confront a mirror and his fears of the Piggy Man. Ben shuts him in the bathroom and turns out the light. Skittishly, Derek starts chanting ""Here Piggy Pig Pig"" before he hears something rustling in the shower. He pulls back the curtain to find a glaring Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), one of the house's previous victims.

Vivien visits a doctor to get an amniocentesis. Ben shows up, even though hes not quite welcome in Vivien's eyes. But he affirms that he's the daddy! Later, in the kitchen, Vivien tells Moira that they're going to have to let her go. Moira insists on staying, saying shell work for free. Why, she even has a fresh meal ready for her and the baby. A raw brain from an organic farm. Vivien digs in, and she cant seem to get enough of it, wolfing it down.

Violet, meanwhile, apologizes to Leah (Shelby Young), the girl she led to be attacked in the houses basement. ""The devil is real,"" the girl says before telling her a story from the Book of Revelation about a red dragon that eats babies. Leah also happens to have some pills to help Violet sleep.

At the Westfield High library, Violet encounters the wheelchair-bound librarian who was wounded in the shooting. She begins to ask him about Tate, but he doesn't really want to talk. ""Good people just don't have a bad day and start shooting people,"" Violet says. ""Maybe he wasn't a good person,"" the teacher replies.

Violet comes home to catch someone out of the corner of her eye. Thinking it's Tate, she follows the entity down to the basement, where she's accosted by some of the house's spirits, except who she's looking for. She dashes upstairs to her room, where her iPod was left on and a message on the chalkboard is waiting for her: ""I love you."" She's had enough, so she helps herself to the pills Leah gave her.

Tate drags Violet down the hall, crying for her not to die. He pulls her into the shower in a bid to wake her up, gagging her into vomiting the pills. He's saved her life, but that doesn't look like what she wanted.

Ben meets Derek once again, but the perpetually terrified sap is making little or no progress. For some reason, we then see a flash of Ben spying on Vivien and Luke having another weirdly deep conversation.

Vivien finally tracks down the ultrasound nurse. Praying in a church, the nurse (Heather Olt) doesn't want Vivien to get too close to her. ""I saw the unclean thing you carry in your womb. The plague of nations. The Beast,"" the former nurse says. ""Okay, so you didn't see anything. The machine malfunctioned,"" Vivien replies. The former nurse is insistent. ""You need some help,"" Vivien says before she leaves, while the nurse spouts certain Bible quotes at her.

Derek's home now, deciding to give the mirror chant a try again. Just as he confronts his fear of the Piggy Man, chanting the magic words three times, the shower curtain flies open. It's not the Piggy Man, just an easily offended burglar (Peter Allen Vogt) who shoots poor Derek in the forehead. The burglar and his partner (David Ury) take off.

Back at Constance's, Billie tells her that her dead daughter is angry with her. ""She was my reason for living,"" Constance says, speaking of Adelaide. ""Talk to her,"" Billie says, ""she's here."" Constance begins apologizing for the way she treated Addy, telling her that she actually admired her and thought her the most beautiful girl she ever met. ""She says thank you, and that she knows,"" Billie tells Constance. Addy also tells her, through the medium, that she is a pretty girl where she is, and that she's glad Constance didn't get her on the lawn of the murder house before she died. Addy's afraid of Tate, especially now that she knows about him.

Flashback to the day of the shooting. Constance is crying for the cops not to hurt her son. We again see Tate mock the police before he reaches for a gun under his covers. They open fire. ""Why did you do it?"" the commanding officer (Preston James Hillier) asks him. Tate's eyes glaze over before he can answer.

We see Violet lounging in her bed, flipping through a book about birds. Tate appears, and they share a moment of understanding. He tells her she's become distant and cold, and that he would leave her alone if that's what she wants. ""I love you,"" he tells her. Violet, moved by this, comforts him. They spoon, trapped together in a twisted tale of teenage ethereal love."

A young woman (Mena Suvari), a newly arrived aspiring actress in Los Angeles, prostitutes herself to a dentist (Joshua Malina), who lives and works out of the house. He puts her under anesthesia and rapes her, but finds her unresponsive afterward. Panicked, he drags her down to the basement, and encounters Dr. Montgomery (Matt Ross), who offers to help her, but instead dismembers her. Her remains are found in a field by a mother and child (Caitlin Dahl & Ava Kolker), revealing her to be the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short.

Present

A detective (Geoffrey Rivas) and Haydens sister, Marla (Tanya Clarke), arrive at the house, looking for her, believing her to have been murdered. However, Hayden (Kate Mara) appears and assures them she is fine, intending to live with Ben (Dylan McDermott). After they leave, she tells Ben she had an abortion and leaves. Elizabeth appears later as a new patient, but their appointment is interrupted by a call from the doctor (Eve Gordon), who tells him that he is only the father of one of the twins.

Constance's (Jessica Lange) and Travis' (Michael Graziadei) relationship deteriorates, resulting in him sleeping with Hayden, who he believes lives in the house. Elder Moira (Frances Conroy) mocks Constance by telling her Tate (Evan Peters) is the father of the other twin. Constance furiously berates Tate, stating that if Ben finds out, he will never help him and Tate will never be able to pass on.

Believing that Vivien (Connie Britton) cheated on him, Ben visits her in the ward. Thinking she is asleep, he expresses his anger and disgust with her hypocrisy and says he will never help her leave. At home, Hayden tries to comfort Ben but he firmly rebuffs her and tells her that he never loved her. Heartbroken, she accepts this, but tells him that Luke (Morris Chestnut) slept with Vivien. Ben comes upon young Moira (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Elizabeth trying to seduce him and has enough, firing Moira and throwing Elizabeth out. Hayden comforts Elizabeth, assuring her that her dreams of fame came true in death as the Black Dahlia.

Constance tries to make up with Travis and proposes to him, believing they can raise Tates child together as a family. When he refuses, she mocks his dreams of becoming famous and he goes off to sleep with Hayden, who kills him. Travis body is dismembered by Dr. Montgomery and taken away by Larry. Two basketball players (Joshua Allen & Dennis Hill) discover his body in the same mutilated manner as the Black Dahlia. Elizabeth assures Travis' ghost that he may yet find fame like her.

Constance, desiring the child, visits Vivien in the ward, expressing her support for her. Vivien confides in her that she was raped by the Rubber Man, but will pretend it was a hallucination in an effort to be discharged from the ward. Ben confronts Luke, but learns that he is sterile and could not be the father. As Moira leaves, Ben finds the Rubber Man mask and demands to know the truth, now believing that Vivien is not crazy and was indeed raped. Moira congratulates him for finally starting to see the truth, appearing for the first time to him in her ""true"" elderly form.

While having tea with Billie Dean (Sarah Paulson), Constance asks her what might happen if a baby is born of a ghost and a human. Billie Dean states that a Catholic papal secret foretells that such a child is the Antichrist and will result in the Apocalypse."

After Larry's wife kills herself and their daughters, Constance (Jessica Lange), Tate (Evan Peters), and Addy (Jamie Brewer) move into the house to live with Larry (Denis O'Hare). On Thanksgiving, the atmosphere is tense, with Tate expressing his disgust with Larry for killing Beau (Sam Kinsey) and his naïveté with Constance, who strings him along to live in the house. Tate also resents Constance for her part in this. An undetermined time later, Tate, high on cocaine and crystal meth, goes to Larry's office, douses him in gasoline and immolates him, then goes to his school to commit the shooting massacre seen in the episode ""Piggy Piggy.""

Present

Ben (Dylan McDermott) visits Vivien (Connie Britton) in the ward, apologizing and telling her he believes her claims that she was raped, and she will be discharged soon. He also tells her that the rapist fathered one of the twins.

Detectives (Charles S. Dutton & Mayala Rivera Drew) tell Constance of Travis' (Michael Graziadei) murder, and she confronts Larry, believing he killed Travis out of jealousy. Larry states he only moved the body, and that a ghost killed Travis in the house. He continues to seek Constance's love, but she says she never loved him.

A truant officer (Gregory Sporleder) informs Ben that Violet (Taissa Farmiga) has skipped school for sixteen days. Ben convinces Violet to try a new school and calls an exterminator to handle a sudden fly infestation.

Learning of Constance's fights with Travis, the detectives take her in for questioning, believing her to be involved in his death. They review her history of family deaths, noting that the district attorney intended to charge her with the murder of her husband Hugo (Eric Close) and Moira (Alexandra Breckenridge), who are considered ""missing persons,"" but could not find the bodies. Unknown to them, this is because Constance buried Moira and ground up Hugo's body, feeding it to dogs. A lawyer, Harry Morgan (Derek Richardson), appears on her behalf, ending the questioning, and tells her that they want to pin Travis high-profile murder on her.

Tate overhears Ben looking into boarding schools for Violet and tells her that Ben plans to send her away; Violet is devastated. , In the basement, Larry retrieves the murder evidence and sees his daughters, Margaret (Shyloh Oostwald) and Angela (Katelynn Rodriguez), and wife,Lorraine (Rebecca Wisocky). He apologizes to his wife and swears to get revenge on Constance, but she tells him that he was the one who broke their vows, not Constance.

Tate, wearing the suit, attacks Ben with chloroform. Ben fights him and pulls off his mask, seeing Tates face before passing out. Tate tells Violet that they can be together by committing suicide. Violet flees from him, but finds that no matter where she runs, she winds up back in the house. Tate quietly takes her to the basement, where the fly infestation is revealed to be from Violets decaying corpse hidden in the crawl space; Violet did not survive her initial suicide attempt in Piggy, Piggy. Tate, who has known that he too was a ghost the entire time, ironically admits that he was trying to protect her from realizing that she was dead. Though shocked, Violet eventually comes to terms with her death.

Constance is brought in again by police, only to learn that Larry has confessed to the murder. She denies any connection to him. She visits him in jail, and he explains he confessed to pay for his sins, but will be able to handle his punishment if Constance will just say she loves him. Constance coldly refuses and leaves."

Nora (Lily Rabe) cares for and protects a young Tate (Paul Butler) from the Infantata (Ben Woolf), whom she still refers to as her son, Thaddeus. She tells Tate that if he tells them to ""go away,"" the ghosts will listen and leave him alone. Tate gets closer to her, telling her that he wished he had a mother.

Present

Tate (Evan Peters) cannot promise Vivien's baby to Nora, for fear of revealing to Violet that he raped her mother. Nora is resolved to take the child anyway.

Ben (Dylan McDermott) picks up Vivien (Connie Britton) to take her from the ward to her flight to Florida, not understanding why Violet (Taissa Farmiga) refuses to leave with him. The doctor strongly warns Vivien and Ben that, despite only being six months in the womb, one of the twins is ready to be born any minute, telling them that the other twin is dying because the dominant twin is taking all the nutrients.

In the house, Violet and Tate encounter Chad (Zachary Quinto) and Patrick (Teddy Sears) preparing a nursery and cribs, planning to take the twins. Violet objects, contacting Constance (Jessica Lange) for help in stopping them. Constance and Chad confront one another. Constance offers Ben's twin to Chad, but demands her grandson for her own. Learning that Tate is the father of the other twin, Chad remains resolved to take both children. Constance and Violet enlist the help of Billie Dean (Sarah Paulson), who senses Violet is dead, but keeps it a secret from Constance at her request. She tells Violet that she can banish a spirit if she burns one of its close possessions and recites the word ""Croatoan"". Tate obtains Patrick's ring when Patrick attacks him, screaming that he could have been ""free"" of Chad and the house if Tate hadn't killed him, which Chad overhears, heartbroken.

Ben enters the house to retrieve Vivien's bags and Violet. Violet tells him that she is dead from suicide and cannot leave the house, futilely urging him to take Vivien far away from the house and its ghosts before she gives birth. Ben thinks she is high and tries to take her to the car. Meanwhile, Vivien goes into labor in the car and Constance appears, taking her into the house against her will. The power goes out and ghosts destroy the car, forcing Ben and Vivien to have the babies there. Dr. Charles Montgomery (Matt Ross) handles the pregnancy, with the 1968 nurses' ghosts (Celia Finkelstein, Rosa Salazar) attending. Constance urges Ben to accept the house's help with the birth.

In the basement, Violet burns Patrick's ring and Chad's watch, and recites the spell, but Chad mocks her, saying that ""banishment spells"" are all fake. When she asks why he is destroying the cribs, he explains that he now knows that Patrick no longer loves him and has given up. He then tells her that Tate killed him and Patrick and raped Vivien.

While Vivien gives birth, Ben helps her with her lamaze breathing, remembering the day Violet was born. The first twin is stillborn, and Dr. Montgomery hands it to a happy Nora. Constance takes the second twin, and she and Moira (Frances Conroy) gush over it, until Hayden (Kate Mara) appears demanding the child. Vivien begins to postpartum hemorrhage and Violet appears, apologizing to her and urging her to let go and join her. Ben, unaware of Violet's presence, urges Vivien to live, promising her that they can still have a happy life together. Vivien dies and Ben finds himself alone.

Violet confronts Tate, revealing that she knows all he has done and she forces him to remember the school massacre. Distraught, Tate begs for forgiveness, saying that Violet has changed him. She believes him, but cannot forgive him because Vivien is dead and Ben is alone. She states he must be punished for it and that, therefore, she cannot and will not be with him anymore. She forcefully banishes him by saying ""go away"" and Tate disappears. Violet, alone and crying, is soon comforted by Vivien's ghost, who tells her she was brave and that she is proud of her."

In their Boston residence, after Vivien (Connie Britton) has caught Ben (Dylan McDermott) cheating on her, he begs her forgiveness, saying he would do anything to save their marriage. This includes getting out of Boston and moving to a different city. He shows her pictures of this great house in an older district of Los Angeles, claiming Vivien loves old houses. He tells her the price of this house is strangely lower than those around it, and that it would be a great place for the family to start over.

Present

Days after Vivien's death, Ben plans to commit suicide and leave the baby to Vivien's sister. However, he reconciles with Vivien and Violet's (Taissa Farmiga) ghosts, who encourage him to take the child and start a new life away from the house. Before he can, Hayden (Kate Mara), enlisting the help of other ghosts, kills him, making it look like a suicide. Hayden takes the baby, but Constance (Jessica Lange) reclaims him with Travis' (Michael Graziadei) assistance. She tells detectives that she found Ben after he hanged himself and that Violet must have taken off with the baby, leaving without a trace.

As ghosts, the Harmons are reunited as a family. However, they realize that the house is a danger to those living in it. With future families potentially moving in, they resolve to protect those families by scaring them away. Moira (Frances Conroy) explains that while some ghosts in the house only wish the living to suffer the same fates they did, other ghosts are innocents and do not wish to see any more bloodshed. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the burned Lorraine (Rebecca Wisocky), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join with the Harmons to help scare new families away from the home.

Meanwhile, Tate (Evan Peters) is still in love with Violet, trying to make her happy out of fear that she is alone, going so far as attempting to kill Gabriel (Brennan Mejia), the son of the Ramos family that has moved in, because he might be a good boyfriend for Violet. She stops Tate, helping the boy escape, and gently rejects him once more, telling him that she has her family and is not alone. Tate then seeks council from Ben, who wants nothing to do with him, labeling him a psychopath full of charisma, but incapable of true remorse or admitting responsibility for his actions. Tate is moved to finally admit his responsibility for the massacre, burning Larry, killing Chad and Patrick, and raping Vivien and attempts to apologize. Ben tells him that the only people who could forgive him for the awful things he's done are the ones he hurt directly, adding that, regardless, he cannot be his therapist. Tate then asks for at least some companionship; Ben does not immediately respond.

In the basement, Vivien discovers that the other twin had actually lived for a brief moment after its birth before dying. Its spirit is being taken care of by Nora (Lily Rabe), who finds that she does not have the constitution to be a caring mother and returns the baby to Vivien. Moira suggests that Nora never truly really wanted to be a mother, but had merely been stuck on the idea of her lost child at the moment of her death and thus became obsessed with motherhood as a spirit. Vivien asks Moira to join their family as the baby's godmother, which she happily accepts. Together, as one happy family, they all celebrate Christmas by decorating a tree in the abandoned house with various ornaments found in the attic. Watching from outside, Hayden tells Tate that Violet will never let him in again and that he should get over her, but he resolves to wait, even if forever.

Three Years Later

Constance has been raising the baby, which she has named Michael (Asher Gian Starita), masquerading him as the orphaned child of distant cousins, who is now in her care. She returns from her errands one day to find that indeed, three-year-old Michael is living up to his prophesied role, having brutally and gleefully killed the babysitter in her absence. She looks in stunned silence at the blood and then the handprints of Michael, who waves at her from a rocking chair. She slowly sits in front of him and muses, ""What am I going to do with you?"""

Professor explains that the film is going to be a love story between Gamera and the city of Tokyo. Joel watches the film with Crow and Tom Servo (Elvis Weinstein) as usual.

THE FILM: Gamera

Images of sea water.

In the Army, a man and a woman arrive. They stare at some ships passing them by. A Japanese ship is crushing the ice to move on. The Captain also stares at the planes.

A telegram received by American soldiers. A US Base technician (Osamu Ôkawa) gets the message and tells the Commander (Kôji Fujiyama), who orders American pilots to shoot on sight. An American pilot (Ikuji Oka) tells the plane, probably a Soviet plane, to identify itself and its mission. As there is no reply, the pilot shoots it.

Meanwhile, an Eskimo Chief (Yoshio Yoshida) talks about legends of a huge tortoise which they call Gamera - they may be more than one. He tells the stories to Dr. Hidaka (Eiji Funakoshi) and other scientists like Kyoke Yamamoto (Harumi Kiritachi), and shows him a piece of stone which has been etched on, probably by the tribe predecesors. When the plane falls down, a small atomic bomb goes off. Both Japanese and Americans notice the increased radiation. A Soviet Representative (Muneiko Takada) denies all knowledge

The explosion has woken up Gamera, a huge tortoise with dangerous tusks. It springs out from a volcano-like hell and causes a Japanese ship to have to evacuate.

In New York, Hidaka and his daughter, scientist Katherine Hidaka () go to a news studio, where they disclose the situation, interviewed by newscaster (Yûji Moriya). Hidaka thinks that Gamera will have a short life span because of radiation. However, a farmer (Bokuzen Hidari) has seen a plane changing course really fast. The saucer-like object glowed in the night. As the news makes headlines, Hidaki and his assistants realise that this will mean that people will forget about Gamera. The flight attendant (Tsukako Fujino) keeps on serving drinks.

On a town with a lighthouse, a school teacher notices that Toshio ""Kenny"" Sakurai has no friends, and complains of this to his mother, Nobuyo Sakurai (Michiko Sugata). So she tells the father, (Yoshirô Uchida), who tells Kenny to get rid of the turtle for his own good; finally, the child complies. He'll release the turtle to the sea.

INTERMISSION

A funnily melancholic song sung by Crow to a pet turtle kept on a plastic nest. Servo comments that he's just a robot singing a love song to a turtle - the turtle is a plastic turtle, by the way.

BACK TO THE FILM

Gamera reaches the lighthouse. It watches Kenny, who can't see anything at first. Kenny runs home but Gamera doesn't wait for Kenny's mother to look. Finally, all the villagers watch Gamera. Gamera smashes a lighthouse, where Kenny has gone to for some reason. Gamera saves Kenny and is gentle with him - Gamera leaves while Kenny's parents take care of Gamera. Kenny and his parents realise that Gamera is a good turtle, and that's why Kenny liked turtles.

Gamera has gone to the Okado area. Kenny's parents listen to the radio broadcast. Kenny returns to the seaside; he looks for Tibbyy, his turtle. Tibby hides. Kenny finds him and promises to return the following day.

Earth tremors announce Gamera's arrival. A pilot (Takehiko Goto) is sent to check things out. There is a plan to lure Gamera to a heat source and then try to kill it. The Minister of Defense (Kenji Ôyama) orders all the Army to watch for Gamera. They try to fry Gamera with electricity. All the opposite, electricity seems to give it strength. The Commander (Jutarô Katô), advised by Hiraka, tells his Adjutant (Daigo Inoue) to go full blast with traditional weapons against Gamera. They need stronger weapons, so he studies the itchings, which give him the idea of fighting Gamera. Gamera can throw fire, like a dragon. The Japanese decide to ask the USA for help. Only Kenny supports Gamera.

Kenny asks them not to fight against Gamera. Hidaka says that Gamera feeds on fire, so that's not a good idea. A soldier says that the plan has gone wrong; so now they're going the opposite way - trying to freeze Gamera. It was an experimental device and it'll only work for ten minutes.

INTERMISSION

The Bots have put an arrow to Joel's male Barbie doll. Joel has told the bots before that, to survive the bad films, they need to keep together and show compassion. The bots reluctantly start doing meditation and sending Kenny good vibrations. The bots really hate Kenny!: his voice is annoying, he doesn't have to go to school, his pssion for Gamera has killed millions of people... and he never gets into trouble. There is even a postcode you can send your reasons to hate Kenny to.

BACK TO GAMERA

They try freezing Gamera. Gamera falls down the mountain, but Gamera retreats into his shell. Gamera burns and becomes a saucer-like thing.

Gamer resumes attacking a city. Before being attacked again, Kenny jumps on the train which is moving to attack Gamera. Kenny is pushed aside and Gamera is killed.

Another plan is devised. Reporters are told to leave, as the plan is kept secret.

INTERMISSION

Gypsy (Jim Mallon) welcomes somebody (Michael J. Nelson) dressed as a turtle. He says that he's Gamera, and he stumps on cities because he was discriminated against because of his size. He admits that he's using Kenny to create a good image of him. He speaks to Godzilla. They talk of creating a film Gamera vs Godzilla

BACK TO GAMERA

Kenny talks to Hidaka and the Army again in a restricted area. Ships are sent to kill Gamera; Kenny wants to do something to help Gamera. Gamera moves to the Army, but then changes course. If it reaches Japan, it'll cause complete destruction. Kenny tells Gamera to go somewhere else. Gamera has disappeared, but then appears at them. For some reason, they throw torches at him.

Gamera moves towards a volcano. Kenny is desperate to help him. A pilot will kill Gamera.

Kenny and Lara meet again. Z Plan is about to happen. They light some oil. Gamera realises it's a trap but goes towards it anyway. Suddenly, Gamera is put under a roof; and then, he is fried with atomic energy... and then sent to space.

All superpowers of the time colaborated to put Gamera inside a rocket, freeze it and send it to Mars, as humanity was unable to kill Gimera on Earth. Kenny is happy because Gamera was not hurt. He wants to become an astronaut so that he'll be able to see Gamera someday.

Images of ocean water.

The End.

The bots point to several characters from the film. Tom Servo bids goodbye.

He tells her that if, in fact, he is next, she could be killed, too. As they hold hands, she points out that if her husband catches her with him, she WILL be dead. The waitress brings him a drink he didn't order, but he drinks it anyway, and immediately leaves the bar. He quickly becomes dizzy, his vision blurs, and he passes out. He awakens to find himself in a concrete cell, chained by the ankle. There is at least one dead body in the cell with him.

The investigation of the missing Marine begins at the bar, where Atlas' truck is still parked after several days. Tony flirts shamelessly with the waitress as they question her. Gibbs finds the Zippo lighter and cigarette Atlas dropped when he passed out. Gibbs becomes frustrated with DiNozzo's flirtation, but Tony redeems himself by providing information he got from the waitress: the woman Atlas was with was Carol Powers, a reporter for ""The Post."" Powers is questioned, but can't help much.

Kate finds that no one is missing from Atlas' Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, but a new CO checked into his command a month ago. CO Joe Sacco's file contains a letter of punishment for getting into a fight in 1992, as a first lieutenant, with a couple of enlisted men including Atlas. Meanwhile, Atlas remains in his damp cell, into which his kidnapper releases a swarm of bees. Abby discovers, based on analysis of the cigarette, that Atlas had ingested a combination of codeine and speed. The combination is illegal here, but available OTC in the Philippines and Okinawa. Major Sacco's last duty station was Okinawa, so the team is off to Quantico to interview him. Sacco indicates that he's not too surprised by Atlas' absence, and that he's had trouble with alcohol in the past. He says Atlas is a marginal Marine and he's not really missed. He explains that the 1992 incident was simply a couple of Marines getting drunk; Atlas had swung at him and Sacco overreacted.

As the team returns to headquarters with Gibbs driving like a crazy man, Abby calls and informs them that three Marines have gone missing from EOD units in the last eight years. They were all considered deserters, they all served with Atlas under Sacco, and they were all in the Philippines in 1992. Abby also finds that there is one remaining member of Sacco's EOD unit unaccounted for: Major Mark Cohen, who was given a Bad Conduct Discharge for assaulting his CO in 1999.

While Abby goes off to a party in her dog collar and black leather jacket, Tony and Kate remain at work, eventually falling asleep at their desks.

Atlas still hasn't seen his tormentor, but awakens to the slam of the cell door and finds a cross necklace on the floor. He picks it up and yells at the closed door, ""Oh my God, I didn't know!""

Tony convinces Gibbs to let him shadow Sacco, hoping he will lead him to Atlas. Abby reports that Cohen isn't a suspect, as he was found dead last year in a sewer system in Old Town Alexandria, chained to a wall. Abby doesn't like the idea of Tony tailing Sacco alone; she has a ""weird feeling"" about it. Kate thinks the feeling may be the results of the 18 Red Bulls Abby drank at the party the night before. Tony follows Sacco to the same bar from the opening scenes, and flirts with the waitress as he drinks a ginger ale.

When Kate and Gibbs look at the evidence recovered from the scene of Cohen's death, they find a cross necklace. Kate points out that Cohen was Jewish, but Sacco is Baptist. Tony follows Sacco out of the bar and calls Gibbs to check in as he starts to get the same blurry vision and dizziness Atlas experienced before he passed out. On the phone with Gibbs, Tony says he doesn't feel too well, and mumbles, ""I think I screwed up boss,"" right before he passes out. He awakens in the same cell as Atlas, who says, ""Welcome to hell."" Atlas' face is covered with huge bee stings. Tony tells Atlas not to worry, because of Rule 9: ""Those rules they teach you in the Marine Corps."" When Atlas asks, ""What rules?"" Tony responds, ""I always suspected Gibbs was making stuff up."" But as he pulls a knife hidden in his belt buckle, he tells Atlas that Rule 9 is: ""Never go anywhere without a knife."" As Tony is attempting to get their chains off, Atlas holds up the cross and says he needs to confess, that he deserves to be there. He says, ""It was an accident. He must have found out about it. We killed four girls...Sacco was in love with one of them."" The four were the four buddies' (Atlas' and the other three missing men's) girlfriends, one of whom left Sacco for Atlas. When the men left the Philippines, they tried to smuggle the young women back to the states in shipping containers. Lt. Sacco split the men up at the last minute and put them on different ships, and none of them was on the ship the girls were on. The girls only had enough food and water to last a few days, and died of starvation and dehydration in the shipping containers.

Gibbs finds Tony's cell phone where he dropped it. Back at headquarters, McGee arrives and asks where to set up shop. Ducky reports that Cohen had a high concentration of honeybee venom, but that he died of starvation over a period of weeks or months.

Abby and McGee work side by side in Abby's lab, sharing Abby's Caf-Pow. Abby discovers that the fingerprint she lifted matches one she lifted from Powers' credit card receipt, and they conclude that Powers was working with Sacco.

Sacco's car is found by Manassas PD at the entrance of a sewer system. Gibbs and Kate arrive and enter the system of tunnels as Tony and Atlas escape from the cell and try to find their way through the maze. Sacco is also looking for Atlas, yelling for him as he makes his way through the tunnels. He comes upon Tony and Atlas, and is surprised to find Tony. Sacco says he isn't going to shoot anybody, that they have to get Atlas out. He says he followed ""her"" here, and she's completely insane, and they have to get out before she finds them. Tony asks, ""Who?"" just as Sacco is shot from behind by the waitress from the bar...one of the girlfriends, who had actually survived and had been rescued from the container by Sacco. She said she had been the youngest, and the other girls gave her their food and water and died one by one; they were covered in bee stings and wearing cross necklaces. She said at first Sacco was good to her, but then he tried to control her. So for eight years, she's been hunting and killing the men who left her friends and her to die."

Gibbs asks Kate to profile 'the one you couldn't stab' and Kate tells him the reason she couldn't: he had kind eyes. Gibbs reminds her that eyes can lie. Then, he shows up again in DC - showing off to Kate at a stoplight, and then Kate jumps into a car driven by his conspirators, ordering them to follow him, and of course is then kidnapped by them. We learn that the terrorist's name is Ari, who was born to a Arab woman and a Mossad agent father. And it turns out the whole lab incident when Kate, Duckie and Gerald were hostages was Ari's ""initiation"" into Hamas. He then foils a potential terrorist action in the US involving Marine 1, the President, and Ariel Sharon. Gibbs doesn't care that he and Ari are (sort of) on the same side, he feels Ari crossed a line. FBI's Fornell tells Gibbs he needs to back off the pursuit of Ari so his cover won't be blown. Gibbs insists on meeting with Ari in a place of his choosing first: the morgue, where the body waiting for autopsy is the good-looking blonde who was leading DiNozzo on, and who was one of the terrorists. Gibbs shoots Ari, so his story will stand up better to Hamas and al-Qa'ida -- and to get a little back for Gerald. I think we'll see Ari again, and soon."

Robin'],[''],[],"['police', 'police team', 'pilot episode']",[],"Robbery/Homicide is answering the call to the home because there is a deceased woman lying face down, naked, on the bedroom floor, with her hair shorn. Ellen Parks, sits with her coat on, telling Detective Flynn her boss is on vacation in Hawaii, staying a few extra days. Her boss is Dr. Elliot Collier, a computer scientist, and Ellen was his secretary. Detective Waters comes to get Flynn to review the body. Flynn asks if there was any identification on the body and Waters tells him two driver's licenses, two passports, all fake, with the pictures cut out. The maid called police when she returned to work and found the body in the bedroom. She sits talking to a policeman. Four or five blows to the back of the head is what killed her, even though she was shot in the face, all according to Dr. Tanaka, where he says the naked body lie for twelve days.

Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson is introduced by Det. Sgt. Gabriel to the doctor, acknowledging again both Detectives, Flynn and Waters. She excuses herself to Det. Lt. Flynn, she bending down to examine the victim. Tanaka comments, I'm just here to declare the victim dead and write it up as a homicide, something a Coroner's attendant usually does, but some ass-hole at Parker Center insisted on a doctor. Brenda acknowledges the ass hole to be her. Brenda notices vomit on the victim, sniffing the stains on the floor, where someone tried to clean up. She asks the doctor to expedite the autopsy, stating she will follow him to the morgue when he is ready to leave. The bullet in the victim needs to be hand delivered to Firearms Analysis for a quick turnaround.

Flynn is irate Brenda is taking the case over, loudly expressing his opinion. Chief Johnson explains to Flynn there has been a change of plans, Priority Homicide has been assigned the case. She also insists a warrant will be needed to search the garage and car, since it is detached from the house. She asks Ellen if Dr. Collier gave her permission to allow strangers into the garage and car; Ellen shakes her head no. She orders everyone out of the car and garage. Det. Waters disagrees with her, calling her a bitch. She retorts, excuse me, Lieutenant, if I'd like being called a bitch to my face, I'd still be married.

At HQ, Captain Taylor of Robbery/Homicide, takes issue with the manner she treated his officers at the crime scene. Deputy Chief Pope tells Captain Taylor, we tried running the department your way, and we had a twenty-year veteran indicted for lying under oath and the murderer being interviewed by Larry King. Bottom line, it did not work, therefore, they brought in Brenda, the closer. Pope continues with Collier developed an anti-piracy computer program CEO Dr. Brown values at over a half-trillion dollars. Dr. Harlan Brown is Collier's boss, fourth richest man in America. The department needed more specialization, Pope declares to Taylor. It is no reflection on anyone's ability to do their job. Pope further adds, Brenda's qualifications include her CIA employment. Before a jealous and disgruntled Taylor left Pope's office, he handed him a folder with some snide remark.

The house is rented by Dr. Elliot Collier, who is missing, Sgt. Gabriel says Dr. Collier deleted his entire employment record; Brenda stipulates we have no picture and no fingerprints. Gabriel says Collier had himself listed as a Christian Scientist employee, thus no medical record on file. Brenda states this disappearance was likely premeditated, but the murder was not. Brenda, in the car with Gabriel, states the victim's prints are everywhere in the house, in his office, in his car, but Collier's prints are nowhere to be found. At HQ, Detective Tao explains he was doing some background on Dr. Collier, and he talked to his mother. Tao informs Brenda with a certificate, Elliot Collier died when he was nineteen, according to Social Security records. Brenda then asks, who is this guy?

Pope shares with Brenda those folder contents which are requests for immediate transfers back to Robbery/Homicide from every single member of her squad. Brenda's response is they'll have a whole list of other reasons to hate my guts. Gabriel has been showing the autopsy in the murder room at the same time Brenda listens to Pope, taking the Taylor-folder from Pope. Twelve years ago, the woman had breast reduction surgery, work on her jaw line and likely a nose job as well. Brenda adds to Gabriel's information, which means she was serious about changing her appearance. She discards each transfer request in a wastebasket as her orders are directed to each of the officers with a final comment, all we have now is a woman we cannot identify murdered by a man who does not exist.

In Brenda's office are Collier's boss and the company attorney. CEO Dr. Brown tells Brenda, Elliot Collier is a genius, continuing to prattle on about Collier, trying to compare his idiosyncrasies with Steve Jobs of Apple Inc. Brenda inquires how much will your company be worth if we can't find him? Attorney Banks says he will not be intimidated by Brenda's accusations. Brenda says the man who created his identity was stolen from a teenager who died in 1989. Banks objects to searching Elliot Collier's office records and computers. Brenda comes back with how a company whose entire reason for existing is to make things secure, cannot locate or correctly identify their most valuable employee. What would that do to the value of your stock? Brenda gets a signature from Dr. Brown for permission to search the records after threatening a press conference.

Provenza is downstairs near the Firearms Analysis entrance arguing with Taylor to get the bullet from the victim identified. Taylor refuses to allow Brenda's team to go to the front of the line. Pope intervenes by continuing the shouting match with Taylor. Finally, Taylor begrudgingly relents to Pope in a face to face confrontation. Pope wins, entering the lab with the bullet taken from the victim's head.

Collier transferred all his money into accounts of his victim's aliases, according to Det. Garth, furthermore, Collier rented his house and car. Brenda asks why would he transfer money to her if he planned on disappearing. Tao speaks, he didn't get rid of everything. Tao says there is one identity he missed, no one entered his office secured area without an iris scan. Tao shows Brenda security pictures of Collier's scanned eye, and adds in the land of no evidence, the left eye is king. Tao also shares mash notes, in e-mail, from Collier to his Secretary Ellen. Brenda requests Tao run a check on our Miss Ellen Parks, with a little cross around her neck. Gabriel asks Brenda what if Ellen found out Collier was living with another woman, and Brenda responds, killed him in a jealous rage. Gabriel speculates what if he was taking off with this woman and Ellen killed them both. Provenza pokes his head in her office asking what she wanted. Brenda says what about the bullet and Provenza answers didn't college boy tell you.

Brenda confronts Pope in the parking garage as he is going to his car and she is noticeably mad at not getting cooperation, accusing him of playing with her livelihood. She screams, I want that report and that bullet back. He promises to get the results from firearms analysis asap.

Brenda invites Sanchez to sit in on the interview with Ellen since he has been with her since her arrival; she sends a disgruntled Gabriel home to rest while Daniels listens from the hallway and others listen from the control room. Brenda's initial interview with Ellen has her admitting Collier would give me the keys when he would go on vacation, but the relationship was not romantic. Ellen says she has never dated anyone, ever. Brenda asks Ellen, did you know Dr. Collier was living with the victim? Did he ever mention that? You never met her or saw her? Dr. Collier had a relationship of some kind; we found her fingerprints all over the house and at work. Ellen responds with that is really surprising, because there are very strict rules about that. Brenda adds, it very surprising when someone we really care about does something like this. I know Dr. Collier was your friend. If Dr. Collier gets in touch with you again, you must let us know. Brenda concludes the interview.

Fritz meets Brenda in the hotel bar, renewing their friendship. Brenda has her Merlot and Fritz has his water. He offers her an FBI report on the mystery woman, saying you were right, the victim's got a record, in fact, she is wanted for murder. Brenda looks with surprise at the paperwork.

At HQ, Brenda reviews the contents of the FBI packet with the detective team. The victim's name was Alana Devin, she would have turned forty next month. In 1991, she shot a security guard outside a pharmaceutical company during an ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) protest. Alana Devin was a lesbian. Like Collier, she was a computer scientist and she changed her identity. The gun that fired the bullet into her face is the same gun used in the original crime, as Brenda holds up the evidence bag containing the bullet. Detective Garth informs Brenda the day Collier leaves, Ellen closed her checking account, the day he went missing, she reopens it. Brenda says she needs to take another look at Alana's body. Gabriel takes a call, telling Brenda the morgue released the body. Taylor explains the moment the victim identification is out, the coroner certifies the body, and it is released by law to the family, common procedure for releasing bodies from the morgue, which Brenda wants back to conclude her case. She tells Taylor you have no right to share the victim's identification. The family has been waiting fifteen years for Alana to come home, they can wait three more days. Taylor asks why the body is important to conclude the case. She tells Taylor she doesn't report to him so your question is irrelevant. Pope quiets the heated conversation between Taylor and Brenda. You will have the body back tomorrow morning.

Brenda and Gabriel leave Pope's office while Pope tells Taylor to sit down, we need to talk. Gabriel confides in Brenda, he was the one giving Taylor the ID to release the body. She acknowledges because he is your friend. Gabriel asks her, have you been able to figure out how Dr. Collier was able to get rid of his fingerprints everywhere? Brenda replies with a yes. Gabriel continues with that bit about bringing the body back, was that true or are you bluffing? Brenda answers, I never bluff, I just express my optimism forcefully. You had Ellen Parks picked up and held overnight. We don't have the gun, and no witnesses. Ellen will be very helpful with that, I promise. Is this more of your forceful optimism? Brenda comes back quickly with oh no, it's my experience. Because as any good interrogator will tell you, as hard as a secret is to uncover, it is even harder to keep. Goodnight Sergeant. Goodnight Ma'am.

Pope is questioning Brenda's actions and intent by keeping the suspect Ellen Parks held overnight and not seeing her all day. Pope insists if Brenda does not get what she needs from Ellen, then she's going to get a lawyer, and we are screwed. Brenda response is I know a little something about admiring the boss and finding out he is not the guy you thought he was. Pope leaves her office.

Brenda goes into her final interview with Ellen dressed very conservatively. She is immediately met with a confrontation telling Ellen to sit down, telling her she lied about her relationship with her boss. Brenda shows Ellen the email correspondence between Collier and her. Ellen agrees with Brenda that she was emotionally intimate with Collier, but not physical. Brenda consoles then confides in Ellen, she loved Dr. Collier and he loved her, and were you aware he changed his name from Alana Devin. Did he tell you he was living under a false identity and he had shot a security guard? Ellen answers yes to all of the questions. You kept that information from the police, why? He showed you the gun? The shooting was an accident, he didn't mean to shoot anybody. Yes, he showed me the gun.

Brenda discloses Alana was Dr. Collier. Brenda shows Ellen the pictures of Alana before and after the surgeries. The iris scan of Alana's left eye matched the scan of Dr. Collier's left eye; a confirmation they were the same person. Let's go back to the night you were leaving. That is when you met Alana Devon, right? These things have to said. She had plastic surgery that changed her jaw line and her nose and reduced her breasts. She proceeded to live her life in permanent disguise. Brenda shows Ellen the pictures of Alana before and after the surgeries. She always turtlenecks because she had no Adam's Apple. She also claimed to be a Christian Scientist, so she would not have to take the company physical. That's why we only found Alana's fingerprints at Dr. Collier's house, and in his office and in his car, not because Alana was living with Dr. Collier, but because she was Dr. Collier. Do you know how I can prove this Ellen? The shot that was fired into Alana's face missed her left eye, and when I took her body back to the morgue, I found the iris scan of the left eye matched exactly the iris scan of Elliot Collier's left eye. The man you were having an affair wasn't a man at all, he was a woman. That night you were leaving, he told you the truth, he showed you who he was. I have it right don't I Ellen, or are you a lesbian?

Ellen slams her hand on the table declaring I am not a lesbian, while she points her forefinger to the ceiling, to emphasize her sexual preference to Brenda. Ellen is offended by Brenda's remark about being a lesbian, stating how could you say that? Brenda comes back with the statement, but you didn't mean to kill him, did you? Hadn't planned on that, but just for the record, just so it is clear, could you please say that out loud. Ellen states, I didn't mean to kill him. I was kissing him and she pulled my hand down against her and I picked the paperweight up off the desk and I hit him over the head with it. I just beat her head in.

Sgt. Gabriel tells Brenda, while she is packing to leave for the night, you know you were right from the beginning, looks like love."

Robin'],[''],[],"['cheating husband', 'police team']",[],"A beautiful woman is found dead in her shower with no immediate sign of how she died. Initially it appears to be an accident at home, but Brenda has her suspicions when none of her hired help is present and the razor, she obviously used to shave her legs is missing. Could a missing razor lead to her killer? Brenda continues her investigation with weak cooperation among her team of detectives. Only Det. Sgt. Gabriel is with her as she looks for the killer among suspects including her philandering husband.

On the scene Gabriel states the conditioner she applied has to be on her twenty minutes and during that time Brenda says she shaves her legs. Brenda looks for the missing razor, and it is important if they cannot find it. Lindsey says Heather has not worked in two years, she was not in a hurry contradicting Jennifer's story.

At the morgue Brenda questions if the conditioner could have shut down her central nervous system. The coroner will look at her brain to determine if that was true. She tells Agent Howard she will send a picture of her scalp to determine the possible cause of death once the coroner is through.

Brenda is late for the Dean Kingsley interview. She arrives with Sanchez asking questions of Dean while his agent sits with him. Soon his attorney arrives saying no further questions leaving with her client and agent. Brenda goes to Pope complaining about the mishap and the quality of officers given to her by Captain Taylor. Taylor's additional officer is to be Flynn

Lindsey is filling in Brenda with Heather's calendar. Brenda is updating the murder board with the data. Lindsey had an affair with Dean in the past. It's not like she was Dean's last girlfriend, the sailboat is more like a ferry. Heather would take everything Dean had if she were to find out about the affairs.

If you can't interview the suspect you find what you can about the victim was Brenda's response to Gabriel asking what if Dean will not talk to us. Brenda eyeballs Heather's appointment book wondering who Heather was getting all gussied up to see. Rather than invite these people down to HQ, at no expectation of privacy, we should see the people at their workplace, keeping them in their comfort zone.

First visit is Jennifer, Heather's hairdresser, saying she had a 11:30 lunch appointment, and normally she performed her hair appointment in the shop, but Heather insisted she meet her that morning, be here by eight were Heather's exact words according to Jennifer. Second stop, Janine, Heather's Personal Shopper, black and red dress for Brenda. Janine's husband left her because of Dean, win some and lose some, she tells Brenda. Third, Isabelle, makeup artist for Heather, added eyelashes to Brenda, gave the restaurant name location for her 11:30 appointment; get a divorce first, he made a play for me in front of his wife. Fourth, Allison Metcalfe, I am Dean's alibi, Brenda responds, oh no Miss Metcalfe, you're his motive.

Brenda sits with Fritz at dinner explaining she got to know the manager this afternoon which is how she could get the reservation for the restaurant they are in. Fritz provides the details from the toxicology report on the nicotine conditioner, under exact conditions, it could be only fifteen minutes for it to penetrate and be toxic.

Brenda requests from Lt. Tao evidence to prove the nicotine conditioner and the victim hair follicles match. Brenda interviews Donnie Holt, owner of the boat slip two over from Dean Kingsley, who recognizes the picture Brenda provides as the new girlfriend, sailing off with her that night. The picture was Allison Metcalfe. The liquid nicotine found at the Kingsley house did not match up with the strands of hair from the victim. The Kingsley prenuptial agreement does not exist, Dean did not have one at all. The victim's cause of death was from a nicotine solution absorbed solely through the scalp. Brenda says his alibi is solid, the revised autopsy report confirms her suspicions and the prenup was non-existent.

Dean lied when he said he was alone on the boat and he conspired with Allison Metcalfe when she decided to pass that lie on to the police. Conspiracy equals obstruction of justice. Flynn goes to Taylor who goes to Pope who prevent Dean's arrest.

Brenda confronts Flynn the next morning stating no one thought to inform her of that decision, looking about into the squad room faces. Well then, I'll just go arrest him myself, as she leaves without any cooperation from her officer staff. Gabriel chases her down. Can you be certain you can drive Dean Kingsley back to Parker Center without getting lost? Brenda holds out her keys to Gabriel, gesturing you drive.

Dean's attorney says my client doesn't have to talk to you. Brenda responds, but he does have to listen. Taylor and others watch the interview. Brenda tells Dean he is responsible for his wife's death. Telling all these women the lies with a non-existent prenup. Being out on your boat when your wife is murdered is too much even for Hollywood standards. Did you ever think that one of these women might take you seriously? I would like you to make a list of all these women you have played this game with over the last three years, handing Dean a pen and paper. And I would like you to sign this custody agreement, because I am going to need it to make my case, showing the agreement to his attorney, before she put it in front of him to sign first.

Brenda returns to the hair salon on the premise she can't seem to get her hair the way it was before. Jennifer hears about the latest girlfriend, a restaurant manager from Beverly Hills, and Dean with a good alibi, on his sailboat with that manager. Brenda says the hairdo you gave me was the same as the one you gave the woman who played opposite him in his last movie. I looked it up on the crew list, that is how you knew him. Tell me Jennifer, did he ever take you sailing? Donnie Holt greets her, remember me? Brenda distinguishes among the dates Dean had, determining Jennifer was a few back since the latest girlfriend, verified by Donnie. . You washed Heather's hair and conditioned it just you always do, but you wore gloves because you didn't want to get any of the nicotine on your hands, and after you massaged it in, she went into the shower to shave her legs, and you waited until she died. And then you went into clean up a little, you took the razor by mistake, to be neat, and on the way home, you got rid of the poison, the gloves and the razor along with anything else. Gabriel hands Jennifer the agreement where Dean Kingsley signed away his parental rights, provided you tell us where you dumped the cleanup materials. Jennifer complies with the request, giving the location of the stuff she tossed. Brenda told her if she got an attorney, she would tear up the agreement, and Dean and the new girlfriend would sail off with her new baby. Jennifer signs the agreement, acknowledging her criminal act."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542965/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,"Brenda's investigation into the murder of a teenage prostitute puts her in the FBI's headlights, and in a possible conflict with Fritz.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Elodie Keene'],"['', '']",[],"['teenager murdered', 'police team']",[],"Brenda is looking for a corpse among the bags in the morgue storage, i.e. toe tag #2005-3290, a teen prostitute, murdered by stabbing, but with Gabriel's assistance, they find the body of the young victim, from the racks. The body has been there three days already, no name. Gabriel asks what makes a hooker so important and Brenda answers the client list is the factor moving it to Priority Homicide, which is why Brenda is searching for the body, not waiting for a morgue attendant. She makes a positive identification from the file and the face of the dead victim.

Captain Taylor argues with Brenda over the handling of the prostitute murder case and conversations center around the client list of notables. The teen prostitute was murdered, stabbed multiple times, and judging from the stab wounds, the M.E. identifies the killer as at least six feet tall because the victim is just shy of six feet; pictures of the dead girl indicate her assailant was ruthless, showed no mercy with multiple wounds. The stab wounds were caused by a six-inch serrated blade. Time of death estimated to be between eight PM and midnight. Brenda has her detective-staff look for leads, including suspect backgrounds, one of which is a friend of Pope's, named Danny Booth, and his fiancé. Brenda tells her officers the killer was likely a regular customer since there was no sign of a break-in, robbery or struggle. Gabriel reviews the killing with slides from the victim's web page, named Strawberry Lollipop, which is the only name known so far for the victim. The web-page calendar depicts March with a reduced list of clients, around twenty-five, presumably limited to her regulars. Brenda requests Lt. Provenza talk to any of her customers, should they happen to come in. Pope catches Brenda before she leaves, stating no feathers ruffled unless you think the suspects are guilty. The matter of interviewing Pope's friend Danny Booth, a regular-client, is mentioned with orders to have the interview at eight AM in Pope's office and off the books.

Brenda looks over the recent victim's house with Det. Daniels while Provenza interviews six-foot-suspects, including a judge, who was at dinner the night of the murder. A congressman client offered a tip to Provenza while being interviewed of possible contractors, since the victim was having her kitchen remodeled. Brenda eyes the blood-stained mattress, hears and sees the victim's cat. Daniels admires the granite countertops, stainless appliances and custom cabinets. Brenda pulls the local take-out menu from the refrigerator, calls the number for a to go order asking if her card or boyfriend's card is on file; it was the boyfriend.

The boyfriend-pimp Nik is called in for questioning, his rap sheet consists of an A&B charge he got dropped; he is the illegitimate son of the head of the Russian mob, Ivan Kozlov, known for heroin trafficking. Captain Taylor is the resident expert on the Russians, according to Flynn. Brenda declines hearing from Taylor, for now. Nik is not involved in the drug business and he waived his right to counsel, but he did say he was thirsty; Brenda brings him something to drink. Zoya Petrovna was the girl's name according to Nik, telling Brenda he was in the Federal Building for several hours while the murder was taking place. Nik is unaffected by the girl's death, showing no sympathy or remorse. Agent Fritz Howard stops at Brenda's hotel room to take her to dinner and confirms the whereabouts of Nik Kozlov in the FBI building for the evening into the morning, because he was told the same.

The next morning, Brenda talks to Danny Booth about a name he does not recognize of the woman he was spending two-thousand per week; Brenda comments that's is quite a lot on a Federal salary. That's enough, Mr. Booth, we'll meet again on more formal circumstances. That's all the questions for now, as she exits, followed by Pope, excusing his friend. Brenda says he is not innocent, and he works for Immigration & Customs Enforcement. The girl was eighteen, practically a child, and her name was Zoya Petrovna. Pope asks about Nik's alibi and Brenda says it was confirmed by the FBI. Flynn gives Brenda Zoya's phone records, showing conversations with Nik Kozlov and Nadia Orwell. Brenda orders background information on Booth's fiancé and Nadia Orwell from Provenza and Sanchez. Franny, from Taylor's office, provides Gabriel with data of a similar victim from six months ago.

Brenda sits in her car trying to eyeball Nadia, within time she comes toward her pushing a baby in a cart. Brenda visits with a reluctant Nadia to learn the connection among the mob, Booth and Zoya. Once she sees Zoya's murder picture, she becomes talkative, willing to give Brenda information. Nadia identifies Booth from a picture, saying all immigrant girls have to date him. She called him a sick pig as soon as she saw his picture. Immediately after getting off the plane, they meet Booth, who stamps their passports. Nadia Orwell was a former Russian prostitute who informs Brenda how corrupt the system is with the men running the outfit, starting with the immigration agent Booth. If Nadia gave the names of three aliens, she would be released from her obligations. Nadia got married and is free from the ring. She tells Brenda about Zoya wanting to stay in the U.S., get married with baby. Nik rejected that notion. Nikolai Kozlov, a pimp for the mob, related as a step-son of the head man. Nadia cries believing she betrayed Zoya in allowing her to come here, and Zoya not being able to return because Nik held her visa.

Gabriel shows Brenda a file of another stabbing victim, another Russian prostitute from months ago; there is no M.E. report with the file. The FBI visits the murder room demanding files be turned over now on Zoya. Brenda has to comply, except for the woman Gabriel found from the data search. Brenda tells Gabriel she finds it interesting that suddenly an eighteen-year-old Russian hooker becomes vital to our national security apparatus. Why the FBI suddenly wanted all the info on Zoya leaves Brenda curious, but they asked for Zoya, they got info on Zoya. They didn't ask for the woman Gabriel found with Franny's help, which Brenda opens the file, showing her morgue picture. Brenda and Gabriel visit a cemetery with unmarked graves looking for the match of the victim Gabriel found. She is identified as Vonya, the body is exhumed, as Brenda talks to the priest associated with the cemetery. He recognizes Booth's picture Brenda shows him. Brenda learns from the priest the exhumed woman was pregnant.

Brenda interviews Booth in an interview room, stating how he sleeps with every girl coming in from Russia, stamping their passports, taking money from the mob for each girl and with whom you have your choice to sleep with coming into this country. Booth says he might need an attorney, but Brenda says he doesn't need a lawyer, otherwise she will talk to his fiancé about what he has been doing with these girls. Brenda orders Booth to call the FBI, make an appointment to talk, telling them what you do for the Kozlov's. Brenda goes in place of Booth, directly to the same agents' office that took files from the LAPD. Brenda learns the FBI agents are holding information from her because of their investigation of the racketeering within the organization. Brenda explains to the FBI agents, Nik Kozlov was to be the father of a baby from another prostitute before she was murdered in the same fashion as Zoya. Brenda realizes then, the FBI is covering for Nik, because she asks if they might know where Nik was when Vonya was murdered. She purposely mixes dates of the murder, and the FBI response is the same, they have an excuse for Nik both times.

She is in the FBI parking lot ordering Gabriel to get Nik and his father in for questioning, when she meets Agent Howard. Brenda questions Fritz if he was lying before and he responds, I told you what they told me. Fritz acknowledges the giant RICO investigation going on, she balks at his excuse, saying Nik was never in custody, they wanted him to testify against his father, so they flipped him. Letting people kill teenage girls because they have connections to the mob is just wrong, Brenda walks away form Fritz in the Federal parking lot, he admitting what is going on here is morally reprehensible. I hope you're not mad at me in the morning, as she drives back to her office. Brenda tells Pope, I had Nik Kozlov ordered in here, arresting him for murder. Taylor says Andy Osterman is with Nik, one of the top mob attorneys, you won't get in a word. Brenda asks Taylor for any information he can provide on Nik's relations with his family. Taylor updates Brenda on Nik in front of Pope just before she goes into a meeting with him and his attorney. Taylor states, Nik is the son of his father's second mistress, an American girl, a pro, who went missing when Nik was four. Nik is not very high up the ladder in the organization, his legitimate brothers handle the heroin business; Nik just manages the ladies; Nik is the family pimp.

Brenda introduces herself to Nik's attorney, stating Nik and her are old friends, having met, talked beforehand, with Nik declining the presence of an attorney. Andy turns to Nik, asking if he was stupid. Nik claims he didn't do it, that is why the decline for counsel. Brenda shows him a picture of Vonya, killed by stabbing, same knife used to kill Zoya. Gabriel tells Andy, DNA tests prove she was the mother of Nik's unborn child. Brenda agrees it happens, claiming that is how Nik entered the world. Brenda also looks Nik in the eyes, explaining when his father passes, he will be shut out of the family business altogether, for being illegitimate; his step-brothers will inherit the business, as they are legitimate heirs. Tell me Nik, did what happened to your mom when you were a little boy, did that make you think whores were disposable? Nik lunges at Brenda. Andy Osterman holds him back in his seat. Since Nik won't tell me where he really was during the time of Vanya and Zoya's murders, perhaps Mr. Osterman you could tell me where you were? You are Nik's criminal attorney, right, for his whole family. So, were you with him last Friday when he was being questioned by the FBI, from seven PM until five in the morning? I can't imagine the FBI would question someone for ten hours without his attorney present or that Nik wouldn't have called for you under those circumstances. The FBI gives your client an alibi for these murders. Brenda to Osterman, can you help me with that? Andy says no, I don't think so, no. Brenda says well, I tried. You are free to go Nik, thank you. Osterman turns to Nik, come on Nik, it is time to go home. Brenda gets up, opens the door, turns to Nik, that's it, Nik, there's nothing more to do. Nik again lunges at Brenda, saying he wants to confess, I killed them. The officers move quickly to rescue Brenda from Nik's grasp, with his pleas of guilt, not wanting to go with his attorney. Brenda says I would like to help you Nik, but I just don't know who to believe, you or the FBI.

Brenda walks out of the interview room, down the corridor, Pope stops her asking, what did you just do? Brenda pulls both pictures of the slain girls from her purse, holding them up for Pope to see. Pope eyes the photos, turns, and walks away, while Brenda clutches the pictures, looking forlorn.

At her new home, Brenda answers the door. Fritz comes in, complementing her about the house, telling her Nik Kozlov was found murdered last night, had his throat slit. Brenda responds, so, the world is short another budding serial killer. Fritz says the Kozlov empire remains standing. Brenda says I have someone to replace Nik, meet Danny Booth, she holds a file up, and his fiancé. It was not my job to protect Nik Kozlov, it was my job to seek justice for those two teenage girls. Fritz takes Booth's file home with him while Brenda hears and sees the cat come into the living room. She is mad the animal was not removed prior to her moving in to Zoya's old place."

His records are plainly displayed about his desk, including his appointment calendar and some patient files. Gabriel updates Brenda, we've got no signs of a break-in, no theft, he's still got his wallet on him. Brenda observes the victim's mouth, I have the feeling Dr. Rainey spent his last few seconds gasping for air. Yeah, red dots on the eyes, petechial hemorrhaging. Gabriel concludes, he was suffocated. Det. Daniels imparts the victim's wife would like to see the body, Brenda asks to see her somewhere in another room. Brenda orders Det. Sanchez to put down the files he has in his arms and also orders Lt. Provenza to do the same with the doctor's appointment book; they are both considered privileged information, and cannot be removed from the premises. Brenda directs Provenza to collect the couch cushions, have SID pack them up and take to forensics, please.

Leah Rainey laments she warned her husband, explaining to Chief Johnson the study her husband was conducting is a clinical trial, an antidepressant designed to treat drug addiction in teenagers. She was concerned this could happen. I'm a psychiatrist also working with juvenile offenders, we wanted to do something to save these children.

The murder room discussion is led by Lt. Tao, over 2,000 addicted teens are in the program. Provenza quips, so, we have a few suspects. Flynn stabs the conversation with so it seems not to be working. Tao adds details, maybe because only half the kids got the medication, one-half were given a placebo. Flynn asks, and we can't go through the doctor's files, Chief? Brenda reacts, no, not an option. How is the clinical trial going? Det. Daniels interjects some news of a family suffering a loss through their son Cody as a result of the medication. Flynn insists the special master obtained through a judge he knows will allow the patient files accessible. Brenda dismisses his idea. Flynn is disturbed with the fact Brenda does not want to pursue the special master, and he takes his problem to Pope. Pope explains to Flynn the manner in which Chief Johnson is approached yields a better chance to get results. Pope tells Flynn there was an incident in Atlanta where she was brought up on charges of ethics violations and therefore has been going by the book ever since. Pope discloses the ethics charge was dismissed but is a matter of record. He asks Flynn to start the special master paperwork and he will speak with Chief Johnson. Pope requests Flynn not to mention anything about the ethics inquiry, it stays just between us.

Brenda talks to Dr. Jerome in his office to get up to speed about how the program is progressing. Dr. Jerome gives his explanation of the trial's progress, for instance, if the drug was abruptly withdrawn, it would produce health risks, such as convulsions, coma and death. After Cody Hammond died, Dr. Jerome suggested to Dr. Rainey the trial should be shut down, but the drug company would not even consider it. Dr. Jerome has his phone ring a few times during the interview with he stating it is common when treating adolescents. It could cost as much as one-hundred-million dollars to shut the whole program down because of restart up costs. There is a knock at the doctor's door and a group of teenagers is seen outside ready to start their session. He excuses himself to Chief Johnson, but the group session is there to begin. Brenda gets the name of the drug company lead, a Dr. Dawson.

Brenda has Dr. Dawson in her office where he is adamant about not shutting down the program and putting his company under suspicion. Dawson threatens Chief Johnson telling her to leave his company alone. Lt. Flynn tells Det. Daniels and Lt. Tao he believes he might have found the chink in our Chief's armor-plated Wonder-Bra. He describes the ethics violation inquiry in Atlanta and has his source from the press help him dig for information about the case. Brenda wants to solve the case of murder to Dr. Rainey and if he had published the cases of failure in the experimental drug program, wouldn't that have had the same effect on the program being delayed? I'm looking for a bad guy that killed someone. Dr. Dawson continues his mean demeanor in Chief Johnson's office, even referring to Atlanta and a possible lawsuit to the LAPD. Pope corners Brenda explaining how Lt. Flynn's idea of the special master would help uncover a possible suspect. Pope waves over Flynn and Brenda imparts, there is no better time than the present, step into my office, please. Brenda proceeds to state how unhappy she is Flynn went over her head. This idea of yours is a no go because she does not want wait around two months for a judge to consider the document where they could lose time in solving the case. Brenda makes it incredibly clear to Flynn she is not interested unless the sun explodes, then she would consider the proposal. She directs to Flynn, get the students in here to be interviewed now. Flynn rejoins, whatever you say ma'am.

Gabriel to Brenda, can we talk a minute regarding ethics? Certainly, detective. There nothing that would please me more than to get information from Dr. Rainey's office files or from Dr. Dawson's company files. It is not just an issue in ethics, Brenda makes the point to Gabriel, it's a matter of logic, if Dr. Rainey's files are so important, then why are they still in the victim's office? If Dr. Rainey's files could tell us who murdered him, then why didn't the killer take them? Gabriel replies, that's a very interesting question. Brenda directs her ire, so while Lieutenant Flynn gets all bent out of shape with me, I want to find out who is all bent out of shape with Dr. Rainey. For example, the parents of Cody Hammond. Brenda and Gabriel visit the Hammonds in their home. Mr. Hammond claims Dr. Rainey killed his son, because when he got sick while on the medication, they took him off the drug altogether. Mrs. Hammond recalls, when the paramedics arrived, my son was lying dead near the dining room table. None of that matters, because you didn't come here to investigate what happened to Cody anyway, did you? Mrs. Hammond gets up from her chair to grab her drink sitting next to the near-empty Stoli bottle. Mr. Hammond expresses his feelings about Dr. Rainey and the drug company where they continue along their paths like nothing happened. Brenda and he have a poignant exchange about the two deaths, Cody and Dr. Rainey.

Pope asks Flynn, Lieutenant, what's all this? Flynn quips, it's bring-a-juvenile-offender to work day. Chief Johnson wanted us to interview as many kids associated with the drug trial as we could put names to. Pope's response to Flynn, instead of going through the victim's files? Yeah, we're filling up the joint with teenage junkies. Pope abides with Flynn, I'll have another talk with Deputy Chief Johnson, after Flynn informs him she passed on the summary judgement. Flynn wants to pursue another angle with Chief Johnson before Pope has another talk with her.

Flynn to Gabriel, I brought in all the names from the phone dump like she asked me, plus some high-school junior Dr. Rainey put on the no admit list for dealing pot, Eric Plackton. Mr. Plackton was a little more reluctant to stop by, he put Sanchez through hell. Gabriel to Flynn, hey lieutenant, it's what she wanted, not me. Flynn retorts, well, you keep telling yourself that Sergeant, maybe it will sound believable. Flynn walks away as Gabriel shakes his head in disgust.

An officer or two officers interview the teen-agers, while Chief Johnson and Dr. Jerome observe in the media room. Lt. Tao to Teri, were you mad at him? Teri says, no. I just wanted back in the drug trial. Provenza and Sanchez interview the drug dealer Julio had to run to catch. Gabriel is interviewing Gretchen. Gretchen reveals, I never had a problem with medicine, no side effects. It completely changed my life. Mrs. Schiller adds, we don't see the depression anymore.

Provenza continues interviewing the teen drug-dealer Eric while others watch in the control room. Provenza avows, you knifed another boy. Dr. Jerome discloses to Brenda, somebody must have pulled some strings for this kid, because we weed out kids like him. He should have never been in the study at all. Brenda to Dr. Jerome: Dr. Rainey's wife warned him about kids like that. Dr. Jerome: Leah Rainey sees the worst kids in the city. Provenza exclaims to Eric, the day Rainey died, campus security caught you on tape. Eric discloses, I sneak in every day, I go where my customers are. Dr. Jerome is in the media room watching Gretchen, and standing next to Brenda. Gretchen to Gabriel: Dr. Rainey did not want me to see my boyfriend anymore either. Gabriel: What did Dr. Rainey have against your boyfriend? Gretchen: When you are that old, you forget, I think, what it is like to be in love. This medication changed my life, if he hadn't put me in that study, I would not have known how to care for someone else. Eric, teen-drug-dealer, you never even read me my rights; you don't have crap on drug charges. Brenda politely asks Dr. Jerome, could you please wait for me outside in the hallway, thank you. She then turns and speaks to the guys in the media room, you guys are acting like a bunch of dentists in a strip club; out, out. She adds, if you can't book our drug dealer on possession, get him out of here. Brenda yells at Lt. Provenza, she is sixteen years old, he continues to stare at Gretchen in the video, sarcastically saying I am so ashamed, as he finally exits.

Lt. Tao asks Lt. Flynn, you're emailing a reporter? Flynn counters, you want to dig through the dirt, get yourself a worm.

At Brenda's house answering the phone from Gabriel, are you sure it was Dr. Jerome's office and not Dr. Rainey's? Which files did he say were stolen? How far away are you? There is a knock at the door at Brenda's house, she is surprised to Det. Gabriel. This is Special Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI, so we will pick up in a few days, then I'll call you. They all leave Brenda's.

At the doctor's offices, Det. Gabriel expresses, there is no forcible entry, Lt. Tao adds, she wants a complete SID workup anyway. Dr. Jerome comments, they took my laptop. Tell me, Miss Johnson, why would one of the kids do this to me?

Brenda questions Gabriel, did you do all your homework on Dr. Rainey's wife? He retorts, need to talk with her again first thing in the morning. The victim's wife Leah Rainey is a psychiatrist also, working in the same building. Gabriel interviews Dr. Rainey. I will try to make this as painless as possible. Your husband never called the Hammonds? Mrs. Rainey ripostes, he would have liked to, but he was counseled against it by the insurance company, malpractice issues, saying you are sorry for someone's loss can be misconstrued as an admission of guilt. Gabriel inquires, can you think of any reason your husband might have broken a confidentiality agreement? Dr. Rainey reacts with yes, when a crime has been committed, privilege goes away, you call the police. Gabriel pursues his questioning, suppose one of the teenagers opened up to your husband about a crime, how could I access that file? Mrs. Rainey rejoins, privilege belongs to the patient, or in this case their legal guardians; do you even know who these kids are? Only a few, he replies.

Pope is looking at the newspaper article while talking to Brenda as they walk the hall at HQ. Pope expresses wow, could they have put sexual misconduct in any bigger type. Brenda asserts the writer said the source is a high-ranking officer close to the chief's office. Pope retorts, well, you know it wasn't me because I know the whole thing was bogus. A lot of people could have leaked that story. Didn't you tell me that jerk from Curson was threatening you? While you're questioning their ethics, maybe they are returning the favor; reporters disguise their sources all the time. Gabriel slaps the newspaper article down on Flynn's desk in front of him, gives him a cold stare; no words are exchanged.

Pope is in Brenda's office listening, do I look hurt to you, Will? No, if I'm not mistaken that's your angry face, as it is with most things. Brenda looks perplexed listening to Pope's comment on what came down in Atlanta. Julio enters her office, that good looking girl we had in here yesterday, Gretchen Schiller. She was just rushed to the hospital with convulsions.

Brenda greets the Schillers at the hospital, while Gabriel has choice words for Dr. Dawson, who questions why LAPD is at the hospital; the doctor is put in his place quickly by Gabriel. Mrs. Schiller is frantic, the doctor said they couldn't find any sign of the medicine in her bloodwork. Does that make any sense to you? Brenda reacts, it's beginning to, yes. Brenda to the Schiller's, what happened to Gretchen is not your fault.

Brenda is in the electronics room viewing the original interviews of Gretchen and Eric; she is instructing Buzz to play them, rewind and play them again. The conversations are Gretchen saying no side effects, with Gretchen's mother adding she has even started dating again. Brenda realizes Gretchen's mother was right, she was taking the medication. Brenda has Buzz play back interviews of drug dealer and Gretchen Shiller. The drug dealer student speaks, I didn't care, I was getting a placebo anyway. Now Brenda knows, uttering to the dual-screens and Buzz, I was concentrating on the wrong person. Brenda is referring to the drug dealer as the wrong person rather than Gretchen. Det. Gabriel, I'm going to need Gretchen's cell phone again and I want to see your notes from your interview with Dr. Rainey's wife.

Brenda is in Pope's office, having a conversation with him and he is to trying to understand why she wants the officer guarding Dr. Rainey's office removed, but not taking the files, making them completely accessible. She affirms, this will help make the case. Brenda hands Pope an authorization for wearing a wire, because she cannot authorize it herself.

Brenda encounters Dr. Jerome and Dr. Watson arguing in the murder room, she declares to Dr. Watson, Gretchen is going to be fine. She is not talking yet but the doctors will find out what happened with her medication. I'm still interested in Dr. Rainey's files. Dr. Watson maintains they're protected. Brenda retorts, I know, confidentiality, but I can still get permission from the patients. Dr. Jerome can give me the names of the parents since the patients are minors. Dawson shouts back, if the parents find out what happened to Gretchen and Cody they're going to pull their kids from the study; you think what happened in Atlanta got ugly, wait. Brenda informs Dr. Jerome, as of tonight, Dr. Rainey's files will be free of police protection, and Dr. Dawson knows that.

Pope to Flynn, handing Flynn a one-page document, Lieutenant Flynn, Deputy Chief Johnson's authorization for a wire. I want it run through the van and through our electronics room here. You'll have to split up the squad, but you've gotten pretty good at that, haven't you? You leak to the press again, I'll have your stripes. Got it? Lt. Flynn acknowledges. Pope's last orders, give her the authorization, take the night off, let the people here do their job.

Brenda is sitting in Dr. Rainey's office with the lights off and near a light switch, Gabriel and Julio are in the van, Louie and Buzz are in the electronics room, all of them are listening to Brenda, wearing a wire, in Dr. Rainey's office. Dr. Jerome enters through the dark, he goes to the file drawer, pulls a file, attempts to leave and Brenda turns on the lights. She speaks to Dr. Jerome, that happen to be Gretchen Schiller's file doctor? Yes, it is Gretchen's file. Dr. Jerome speaks, after you told me the files were unprotected, with Dr. Dawson gone, I got worried, now that I don't have any records of my own. How is it your office got broken into with a policeman down the hall and why would the drug company steal your files and leave Dr. Rainey's files untouched? Brenda looks Dr. Jerome into his eyes, asks him may I be honest with you? I think you killed Dr. Rainey yourself. I think the file contains information Dr. Rainey was going to report you to the police. My guess is Dr. Rainey gave you a chance to turn yourself into the police, and you paid him back by smashing him over the head with his phone and smothering him to death with the cushion from his sofa. . Brenda continues, from Gretchen Schiller's interview, Gretchen said she had a boyfriend Dr. Rainey wouldn't approve. You got the file right there, why don't you open it up and read your friend's notes. Now that you have broken into the office and stolen the file, I cannot open it myself, but a judge can. Dr. Jerome reacts, she is a delusional girl, on serious medication. Brenda ripostes, this is so amazing, holding up Gretchen's cell phone, your entire relationship memorialized in text messages. Dr. Jerome tries to somehow justify his behavior, but Brenda corrects him, in this case it's called murder. Dr. Jerome counters, how is it murder? You said Gretchen was getting better. Brenda retorts, I lied, she's still in a coma, and the person you have been exchanging text messages all day about accidently switching out Gretchen's medication with a placebo is a forty-five-year-old Chinese-American detective in my office. Lt. Tao sends Dr. Jerome the text U R a murderer. When I find cases where someone has been sexually abusing a minor, I usually find it is part of a pattern. You said you specialize in adolescents. How closely do you study them? Transference issues, in law enforcement we call it statutory rape, maybe you prefer molesting. Brenda has reached the point where the case is solved and she has heard enough of Dr. Jerome, murderer of his associate, Dr. Rainey. The officers in the van, Gabriel and Julio, say it is time to leave the van and enter the office. Brenda tells the officers to get him out of here; Gabriel and Julio arrest Dr. Jerome."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542957/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,Brenda works to solve the rape and murder of a congresswoman's daughter.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Greg Yaitanes'],"['', '']",[],"['police team', 'rape and murder', 'attempted rape', 'congresswoman']",[],"Brenda and Gabriel enter the hotel where U.S. Congresswoman Simmons is attending a function and just being introduced by the Mistress of Ceremonies. The officers ask the receptionist for the Representative's seat location. They walk to the correct table, inform US Rep. Simmons who they are and they would like a word with her about her daughter. She responds, give her five minutes; Brenda, with Sgt. Gabriel, depart for the corridor. The Congresswoman, with her aide, Larry Fine, enter the hallway and Brenda asks her if this is your daughter, from a picture she is holding. Brenda informs her daughter has been found murdered. Sgt. Gabriel says it was from a blow to the head, and she was also raped in her home. Rep. Simmons is naturally distraught, Chief Johnson says they will talk later, adding, this being a terrible time to converse.

Brenda enters the crime scene, filled with her team of officers and patrol staff. Lt. Tao says there were no sign of forced entry, likely it was someone Carla knew. Tao shows Brenda the probable events in the bedroom; Brenda asks Det. Daniels for a name of the ex-boyfriend, when she can determine it. There is a cutout picture from a mural Brenda finds in the dresser drawer; it is the boyfriend and Carla. Daniels comes back with information on Brett Harlan, with whom Carla worked with at their employer ad agency, which Brenda says that explains why she kept it to herself.

Brenda acts as Det. Gabriel's secretary, entering the interview room where Brett Harlan waits. She is wearing an earpiece to hear of the fingerprint report from the crime scene. Brenda questions Brett on his whereabouts around the time of the murder and he gives a friend's name he was with at a bar. Brenda asks for a swab for DNA because some of his stuff was found at the crime scene. Brett figures out it was Carla who was raped while Brenda feigns, she was not supposed to inform anyone of the victim's identity. Brett says Carla was holding onto his belongings until he gave her key back. Brett explains their schedules have not been suitable for him to meet Carla to make the exchange, the key for the personal items. Brenda says she cannot provide further information about the case. Gabriel confirms the alibi with Brett's friend and Tao says the fingerprints do not match the killer's, i.e. anyone known to the police, including Brett. Brett says he warned Carla of doing this weird stuff. Gabriel tells Brenda that Brett's fingerprints do not match the rapist. Brett removes his shirt for Brenda to look for any blood on him unidentified from the crime scene; Brett complies and there is no blood or any marks. Brenda tells Brett someone killed Carla during the attack in her home.

Pope emphatically states Rep. Simmons wants to enter Carla's home, being the emotional wreck, she is, so if you want something Brenda, go get it now. Brenda takes the key from the uniformed officer, leaving the door open, since he says the key is marked do not duplicate. Brenda begins her search of Carla's home and bedroom. As she is looking through some desk ornaments, someone tapes her mouth with duct tape, throws her to floor, slugs her, tosses her on the bed, proceeds to rape her, when she pulls her revolver out sticking in the man's gut. He gets off of her, removes his mask at her command, where she continues to point the gun at him. She informs him he is under arrest for breaking-and-entering, attempted rape, and assaulting a police officer.

Brenda places one more bandage on her forehead, calls Agent Howard, when Det. Daniels enters her office, saying her assailant is in the interview room and Congresswoman Simmons is in Pope's office awaiting word on her attacker's response to police questioning. Sgt. Gabriel confronts interviewee Andrew Gage, Brenda's attacker, stating to him, you are under arrest for the attempted rape and battery of a police officer. Gage states he doesn't need an attorney, shouting to the Sgt. he is married, while Gabriel opens Gage's leather bag of S & M accessories. Gage says I brought what I thought she would like as Gabriel questions how his wife would react to his extracurricular activities. Brenda is watching this interview with Pope in the media room. She had previously told Gabriel he would be more objective conducting the interview. Gage screams to Gabriel the woman who did this to my face was asking for it as he refers to a document in his bag. Gabriel refers to the previous girl was attacked in the same house and Gage denies knowing anything about a previous girl. The paper gives the address of Carla's house, requesting the service through a web site referral; Gage repeats, she was literally asking for it, via a personal of the Jones list. Gabriel looks at the paper, Brenda asks Pope to please have Gabriel stop the interview.

Brenda walks the webpage document info to Pope's office where Simmons and her aide are waiting. Brenda requests Rep. Simmons let the police finish their investigation before asking for this progress report. Brenda tells Congresswoman Simmons the man we arrested tonight is not the man who killed your daughter, his prints do not match any print we found at the house. Brenda proceeds to explain what she knows based on the Jones list, i.e. personal ads placed for S&M invitations, Representative Simmons says she doesn't have her reading glasses, Brenda reads the ad. The sheet reads, in part, come to the house, key under a rock by the door, tape my mouth and have your way with me. Simmons interrupts, stating Carla did not write that filth. She leaves the room while Larry asks how the ad was found. Pope tells him from someone responding to it. Brenda assures him the ad will be taken down by morning. Larry leaves. Brenda sadly laments to Pope, she was asking to be raped Will, she wasn't asking to be murdered.

Brenda is met by Agent Howard in the parking lot, afterward at her house, where he attaches a new bandage to her forehead. She invites Fritz to spend the night on the sofa sleeper, not in her bed, as she tells him she has been through a rough day with men.

Brenda and team head to the Jones list headquarters as Brenda learns from Lt. Tao one million people a week visit the web page. Entering Jones headquarters and dealing with the irritated owners, Brenda manages to secure the list of responders logging into this ad featuring Carla's address. Over six-hundred members of the Jones list reviewed Carla's ad, DNA from the rape kit indicates the killer is Caucasian and has red hair. Matching DMV photos will validate the suspects and a search can begin.

Brenda and Gabriel locate suspect Corey Horowitz at his fraternity, but he does not really have red hair, and usage of his credit card leads to the home of pledge Jeffrey. Brenda interviews the neophyte fraternity member, telling her the woman resisted the attack, fighting back harder than expected. Jeffrey waives his right to an attorney as Brenda provides proof of his fingerprints at the crime scene and bets him there will be a DNA match if he does not want to talk. Jeffrey lets Brenda know the fraternity boys dared him to follow-through with the meeting. He tells Brenda when I got to the house, I found the key, snuck in the front door, took off all my clothes, had the tape ready, doing whatever it said in the ad. When I let her up, she got hysterical, she tried to kill me. She pulled a lamp out of the wall, hit me over the head, she was screaming like she was crazy. Jeffrey lifts his shirt up showing Brenda the blood and wounds from Carla's defensive moves. She broke this glass thing, she gouged me and was slashing at my neck. She was trying to kill me, so I pushed her away, when she smashed her head on the dresser. I tried to help her up when her face just went white. I didn't know what to do, then she was dead. I left, locked the door behind me, kept the key, because I didn't want anyone else to go in there. I didn't know what else to do.

Brenda leaves Jeffrey, points to the restroom for the disturbed Congresswoman, argues to Gabriel and Pope arresting Jeffrey is not the way to proceed. We can't get him for B & E because he had access to a key supposedly left by Carla, he can't be arrested for rape because he reasonably thought he had consent, and charging him with murder, he will argue self-defense because Carla fought back. Brenda has a glazed look in her face repeating Carla fought back is what is wrong.

Lt. Tao notes to Brenda every time Carla Simmons went online, her computer recorded it. Brenda asks to be shown how Carla placed her ad. She was not a regular on this site, just the one time placing the ad, as Tao demonstrates for Brenda. There is also no record of any kind of dating-service-site activity like the Jones list from Carla's computer. Tao prints out the date and time stamp of the ad placement for Brenda. Tao asks, you have a confession, what is it you are trying to prove? Intent, Lt. Tao, intent, because without intent we do not have a murder, and our rapist goes free.

Brenda gets information from the team how the descriptions were created by the Jones list users. She has called back Brett Harlan, ex-boyfriend, to answer some loose ends since they found the killer and to return his stuff. Brenda shows Brett the ad, saying Carla was raped and murdered because of the ad on the internet. The ad was placed by somebody else using her computer, notice there is a date and time stamp on it. Brenda tells Brett that Carla did not fill the Jones list form in herself, she was at work when it was completed, and it was filled by a browser auto fill. Brenda tells Brett there is a better reason Carla did not place this ad because she fought back, and why would she fight back if rape was what she intended. Brenda informs Brett, she didn't even know about the Jones list, someone else put up this ad. Someone who had access to her computer, someone who could get in and out of her house.

Brett responds with are you suggesting I put that ad up? Brenda answers no, I am not suggesting that, I can prove it. Another ad you placed of yourself on another site, describing yourself as a control freak, you spelt control incorrectly twice in each ad, spelling it with two l's. Brenda puts the proof on the table in front of Brett. She tells him, walking out that door now makes you look guilty which is what the District Attorney will see as this is being taped. Please tell me you didn't want Carla to be raped? Did you expect people to act on that ad and murder Carla? Brett is standing and shouting no, no. He sits and tells his version of what made him place the ad. Weeks ago he lost his temper reacting to Carla's gunning the car in reverse when he punched her in the arm. He apologized several times, not even bruising her, but she broke up with him for that one thing. Brett said he pursued the apologies, calling her a hundred times, but Carla never responded. Brenda says so you were hurt and angry; she says thank you Brett, it's not pretty, but now at least we know the truth.

Brenda puts Brett's stuff on the table asking for her house key since that was the deal made with Carla. Brenda says, she would return your stuff and you would give her back the key. Brett says oh yeah, I must have lost it. Brenda says really, the landlord only issued two keys, one Carla kept and the other she gave to you. Brenda produces a key, which Brett tries to take, but Brenda pulls it back. She says I got this from the guy who raped and murdered Carla, which you left outside for him. He found it outside her house under the rock where you said it would be. If you didn't intend for anyone to rape Carla, why did you leave the key for him? Brett is silent. Brenda comments, shoot, now we have a problem. Gabriel speaks, if someone dies in the commission of a felony, like solicitation of rape, and there was proven intent, Brenda adds, that is first-degree murder. Brett speaks, saying I thought if she knew what real violence is like then she would know what I did was really nothing.

Congresswoman Simmons enters the murder room after Brenda is warned she is approaching, pulling down the screen to cover the picture detail on the murder board. Simmons looks at Brenda, I think I could have spared myself some doubts about my daughter if I had let you do your job. I can't begin to thank you for proving she was the girl I thought she was; I did know her, so thank you. Brenda says you're welcome. Pope asks if she is okay and she responds yes, I am good. Alone, Brenda calls Fritz to have breakfast with him, somewhere away from the offices and she asks him for good directions."

The mother, Jillian Thompson, comes to HQ looking for her son, Brenda learns she is divorced, working in Phoenix, where the judge had full custody in L.A. Brenda is aware their son is autistic, after visiting the judge's home. Jillian speaks about the treatment her son Keith has received from the classmates where he attends school.

Eddie Hoke is a suspect, a big fish per Captain Taylor, Pope has Hoke brought in for questioning with Brenda and Taylor sitting in on the interview. Hoke's attorney states my client was in your cell when this all went down.

The judge's car is found at the airport with the autistic son in the trunk. Brenda has some of her clues divulged by way of the son as she seeks the murderer. Keith is continually uttering the coordinates where he is located or wanting to know the coordinates of his immediate location; the episode title is a reflection of Keith's autistic behavior.

Brenda asks the team of detectives, wouldn't a carjacker who had no qualms killing a judge, also kill Keith? Brenda pleads with Pope not release Keith to his mother because she will take him to Phoenix then she will have to have him extradited. The judge's Mercedes has a special GPS installed, stating the precise location of the vehicle upon start of the car through an electronic voice. The reason why Keith went into one of his anxiety modes when Brenda's car was started and the voice never came on announcing the location. By researching the coordinates, Lt. Tao and Brenda realize the killer made a stop other than the park or the poker game.

Gabriel and Brenda go to the other location to find a bar, with Gabriel asking Brenda why would someone who has just shot a judge with an autistic teen locked in the trunk of a stolen car, come here? Daniels and Sanchez have Tao search the calls of the number from the men's room payphone from a time immediately after the murder. There was one familiar number called from that phone. It turns out to be a cell number held by Jillian Thompson; a phone she later denies owning, although purchased in Tempe AZ.

Video tape shows a man leaving the bar, who in turn is identified by Keith from the control room. The suspected killer is Jason Murphy, interviewed by Brenda, determining his brother was sentenced by the judge. Brenda describes Jason's actions on the night of the murder. Three cigarettes he smoked with the grounded butts in the area outside of the poker game. Jason car-jacked the Mercedes, he shot the judge, stole his car with Keith in the back seat, later put in the trunk, which Keith scratched Jason because he doesn't like being touched. He drove to LAX, left the car and flew home to San Fran, his flight manifest shown to him by Brenda. Brenda asks Jason to write down the name of the person hiring him to kill the judge. He would not be charged by the state of California for any crime giving Brenda the written name.

Brenda leaves Jason in his interview room going to Jillian's interview room, where Brenda is told Jillian did not purchase a prepaid cell phone, days earlier. She answers Brenda's inquiry of the $75,000 withdrawal being for home improvements to accommodate Keith moving to Phoenix and having his own room. Brenda then shows Jillian a picture of Jason Murphy asking how long she has known this man? Jillian says she has never seen him before, but Brenda asks why did he call you twenty minutes after he murdered your husband?

Brenda shows Jillian pictures of two choices where Keith can be housed while she is in prison; she also sees her name penned by Jason Murphy on a tablet saying she hired him to kill her ex-husband. Brenda says to Jillian you have a choice of facilities for Keith to reside, tell me you paid Jason to kill your husband or I will turn Keith over to Child Services and he will go the lesser desirable location.

Jason Murphy called the judge's home threatening husband Michael Thompson according to Jillian. Brenda says to her, then you knew he would not be opposed morally to killing the judge. When Michael took away Keith, he took away my life, cries Jillian to Brenda, I guess now we're even.

Brenda goes back to the interview room with Jason Murphy and his attorney Pierson. She then introduces Special Agent Howard from the FBI, who will be taking Jason into custody, as the new Federal law for car-jacking has the death penalty attached to it. Agent Howard will fill you in on all the details. Thank you says Brenda, as Agent Howard reads Jason his rights."

A doctor-customer calls for an ambulance and the police, while attending to the injured man. The doctor re-phones emergency services, saying he called twenty minutes ago asking them to hurry. There is a composite poster labeled gay-basher on the entry door. The man-in-the-bar ridicules Det. Ross for his late arrival and handling of the bloody incident. Captain Taylor explains to Lt. Flynn, the hand-off to Priority Homicide is due to the political nature of the case; he excuses Det. Ross from his duties while Chief Johnson enters the bar area. Brenda has brought her sick cat to a crime scene in a pillow case and she is questioned by Sgt. Gabriel, why the cat to the crime scene? Gabriel hands the animal to paramedic Terrence, requesting it be brought to an animal hospital, while Terrence is there to transport the beating victim. The man originally carrying the victim was given a sedative by Dr. Hall, and is holding the bat found outside where the bloodied man was found. He is crouched near the victim, dazed, due to the medicine he was given. Det. Sanchez informs Brenda the bar patrons have disturbed the crime scene as he explains the case to update her.

At autopsy, Dr. Crippen explains the first blow to the side of the head is the cause of death, the other wounds came afterward, including the cracked ribs, left arm broken in two places and the shattered femur. The blow to the side of the head is the only strike from the back, the other wounds came after the victim was likely dead. Brenda wants the autopsy evidence in a hate crime detailed before the body is opened up to prevent the court accusing the police from inflicting the wounds. The doctor understands there was some jewelry stolen. Gabriel says a Gucci watch and a diamond ring. Dr. Crippen hands Brenda the item found under the victim's T-shirt; she holds up a pair of designer dog-tags, diamond-in-laid. Crippen adds, there was residue of Special-K under the victim's nostril; ketamine mix to dull the senses, popular in gay-dance-clubs. Brenda is aware of the drug's effects, possibly making the victim not suffer through the beating.

Flynn gets a tip the gay-basher-poster looks just like the woman-caller's boyfriend; he transfers the caller to Robbery/Homicide, directly informing Captain Taylor of the call. Brenda goes to her office where Assemblyman Bridges, local politician representing a gay neighborhood, and Chief Pope are waiting for her. She tells them they are picking up the man matching the composite picture. The only blood found at the crime scene is that of the victim, despite there being so many people disturbing the area. Brenda educates Bridges on procedure, i.e. we do not disseminate the picture of a person-of-interest to prevent the court from accusing the police of contaminating the evidence; we just don't want to track the murderer down, we want to make certain we do it so he is put away for life. Robbery/Homicide is in progress of apprehending a suspect at his apartment address with Captain Taylor leading the group. Blake Rawlings, gay-basher is taken out of his apartment by the police when they bash open the door and he is shooting up in the bathroom. Brenda politely explains her methods to the Assemblyman of gaining the suspect's trust while Rawlings is cuffed and hauled away by Robbery-Homicide. Taylor makes certain Blake eyes the composite drawing while he is on the floor of his motel-room-apartment; by some standards, Rawlings was roughed up taking him into custody.

Pope is screaming there is no evidence where the arrest was made, no wallets, no jewelry, no bloody clothes, no stolen property at all. Brenda, in Pope's office, reminds him of the mess Robbery-Homicide made of apprehending Blake Rawlings based on the composite drawing tip. Pope doesn't want to cause any more friction within the gay-neighborhood via Assemblyman Bridges. He insists Brenda continue with the case and leave Taylor be. Brenda says Taylor wants the case, let him take it. Pope insists she take it and he will handle Taylor. Brenda tells him you always say you will handle Captain Taylor but you never do. She exits Pope's office upset, with the file.

Brenda has Barry, the victim's friend looking at Blake from the media room, and he recognizes him from the picture in the bar, not sure of the identity that night. Barry tells her Rawlings was leaning over Clint in the dark at the time and then he threw the bat at me. Brenda asks Barry to describe what happened before the attack. Barry describes Clint as a little high, they stopped for a drink before heading out dancing; Barry was the designated driver. He left the bar, but to return, forgetting his jacket with his cellphone in it. He tells her their house just went on the market, he has not been working much lately, and Clint was trying to get back into acting. Barry is teary telling his story. He does not recognize the found dog-tags, he says they were certainly not Clint's.

Brenda interviews Blake Rawlings with Jimmy York, Blake's attorney. Blake says he goes after gay guys heading back to their cars because they are dropping stuff, usually alone and they have money; he claims he does hate anybody. Blake says the stolen property is hiding in the trunk of his girlfriend's car. He tells Brenda he went to the grocery store the night of the assault because the girlfriend doesn't want him using drugs around her; he used the parking lot of the store to shoot up and continues to plead for help from Brenda.

The police call upon Jennifer Russell, Blake's girlfriend, who remembers and calls out Captain Taylor's name to Lt. Flynn, saying she was the person calling the tip line for the reward money, turning in Blake. She said Flynn transferred her call to Captain Taylor; so, did you bring the money? Lt. Flynn tells her, you don't get the money until he is convicted, honey. Flynn hands her a search warrant, they go to the garage, pop the trunk, finding all sorts of loot and a wooden bat; just like Blake said it would be.

It doesn't surprise Brenda that Flynn transferred the call to Taylor, as she looks over the stolen property tagged on her desk. She listens to Det. Gabriel praising her good work, saying he just wants to get the bad guy. She orders him, together with Sanchez and some uniforms to find the watch and wallet near the crime scene. Terrence interrupts Brenda to report on her cat; it was very pregnant with six kittens, presenting her with bill. Pope calls for her, she says Sgt. Gabriel will show you out and I will pick up my cat, thank you. Brenda informs Gabriel they will not be arresting Blake just yet.

Agent Howard is driving Brenda to dinner, but before they dine, she must meet with Pope for a drink. Fritz says he will pick up her cat and kittens. She informs Pope she hasn't charged Blake with the murder yet, after Pope hands her a token gift of appreciation for her hard work and for putting up with the forces that are; he tells her the gift is a pair of small diamond earrings. He asks why Blake hasn't been charged. Brenda says it is an evidence issue and no confession are reasons given for not making the arrest stick.

Fritz notices the blue box from Pope, saying jewelry is never just jewelry, despite the way Brenda pushes it off as the token gift it was. Brenda's epiphany is when she thinks of the meaning behind the dog-tags encrusted with diamonds. They were given to Clint by someone other than his lover Barry. Brenda is holding Kitty, while the kittens are in the back seat. Agent Howard ponders how he is going to valet this car with six kittens in the back seat.

The kittens are in Brenda's office as she gets some good news when Gabriel gives her the stolen wallet, ring and watch taken from Clint. They were tossed in a nearby pond with the money gone from the wallet. Brenda asks Lt. Tao to identify the merchant selling the diamonds in the dog-tags, Det. Sanchez is asked for a dump of every cell phone the victim was using in order to find anyone else he might have been taking to at length. Sgt. Gabriel is asked to secure credit reports, hopefully providing the frequent callers from Clint and Barry. I am pretty sure they didn't buy this necklace, but I am pretty certain there is someone else who did. Flynn asks what about me? Brenda says you can command the tip line because irrespective of already catching the guy, who would transfer those calls to Captain Taylor if you weren't here? Flynn has a look about him knowing he crossed the line.

Provenza asks Taylor why he is marching Blake Rawlings to an interview room lead by Det. Ross and patrolmen. Taylor responds, sometimes Pope giveth and sometimes Pope taketh away. Brenda is reviewing Blake's interview when Provenza inquiries what she wanted. She says I think I got this, go home Lieutenant, there no sense everyone being exhausted. Taylor grills Blake, working on a confession from him on the premise he gets help for his addiction. Provenza mentions Tao says you might think there is someone else that could be involved in this murder. Brenda answers, there could be a strong possibility. Taylor sweats Blake into a confession, telling him I can help you. I can give you an upgrade from assault with a deadly weapon to first degree murder; Det. Ross, put that back in its cage, and Taylor exits the interview room.

Tao, with Sanchez, show Brenda the results of their findings. Julian Carver, photographer, purchased the dog-tags on his American Express card. Brenda looks through the credit reports confirming Barry and Clint hadn't made a lot of money in the last couple of years. Tao notes they were not legally married, but they had joint accounts, shown from their credit reports, eyeing also the suit Barry bought for Clint's funeral, draining the last of his available credit. Flynn trumpets Taylor just got a confession from Blake Rawlings, but Provenza, with the help of Buzz, says that confession isn't likely to hold up. In his hand, he has tapes from retailers showing Blake was in the parking lot like he said, when the murder took place. Brenda views the video and agrees, Blake couldn't have committed the crime, after looking at the tapes with other officers, and Buzz running the machine at Provenza's direction. Brenda states she needs this Julian Carver.

Brenda, Gabriel and Sanchez drop in on photographer Julian Carver, and Brenda asks him how well he knew Clint Harper. Julian says I took six rolls of him six weeks ago, he was looking for an agent, needed some new pictures. Brenda says according to his cell phone records, you must have known him fairly well, records show frequent calls between you two, some were rather lengthy. Sanchez finds a bag of Special K stored in the microwave oven, Brenda comments, now I don't know what to believe, Mr. Carver. Brenda holds up the dog-tags found on Clint while Gabriel finds revealing poster-size photos of Clint and Julian. Julian confesses to his affair with Clint. He opens up saying Clint was ready to move in, leaving Barry for me. Julian tries to prevent Brenda from taking anything belonging to Clint, including the large provocative pictures. She counters with either you let me take these pictures or I arrest you for possession of a controlled substance, your choice. Don't worry about the pictures, I going to display them.

Julian Carver is alone in an interview room while Brenda and Barry watch in the control room. Barry says he has never seen him before, even after being shown a poster picture of him, looking much healthier and wearing less clothes. She then shows him a poster-pic of Clint; little comment from Barry. Brenda hands him a box of items Clint was not wearing in the picture. The property left at the studio now belongs to you Barry, community property law prevailing, including the house you were selling, to pay off your debts. If Clint had dissolved your partnership, you would have had to split everything equally, after you supported him for the last six years, then you fell on some hard times. You went out looking for another boyfriend and you knew a composite was being circulated around your neighborhood, you told me yourself. Brenda reminds Barry of the aluminum bat purchased days ago, using the same credit card for the new suit he purchased yesterday. Those credit cards were stolen, and after you bludgeoned Clint to death, you threw those cards in the pond across the street. How did it feel, Mr. Anderson, the boy you spent all this time with was about to leave for someone else, with half your assets? Barry stares in silence at the revealing pictures of Clint with Julian, hung around the room by Brenda.

Screw Julian Carver! I loved Clint, I loved him. Barry's outburst when Brenda asks if they had a photographer at their ceremony. Barry states he begged Clint not to go, not to humiliate me, to allow these photographs. None of this was easy, I had given him everything, what had he given me, I never wanted to hurt him, I was trying to work it out.

Watching the Barry-interview with Pope and Brenda, Assemblyman Bridges says this was supposed to be a hate crime, Brenda responds, I think it is. Bridges comments, how am I to explain this to the community? Pope chimes in with well, you have been trying for years to say that gay and straight marriages were pretty much the same. I think this guy has done it for you.

Taylor is trying to justify his behavior with the case, i.e. Blake Rawlings' forced confession. Brenda speaks her mind to Taylor, it's not the department you have been treating like crap, it's me. That's because you have been getting mixed signals, so let's see if we can straighten things out. I don't want an apology from you, I want an acknowledgement of my rank. I want an understanding you are beneath me in the chain of command, and I want you to be officially warned if you undermine my investigations ever again, Chief Pope will recommend an investigation from Internal Affairs, which I believe is the established procedure for an insubordinate officer. Are we all agreed? Pope says I see nothing improper in that request. Good, thank you so much, as Brenda exits with her kittens in their box. Taylor tells Pope, sir, I think I should point out I only got the confession you wanted me to get. Pope answers back with on the other hand, you may have accomplished more than I expected.

Brenda returns home with the kittens and Fritz brings her a bed for Kitty and the pillow case she was in when Brenda brought Kitty to the crime scene. Brenda thanks Fritz for the return of the pillowcase as it was one of a set given to her from her mother when she went to school at Georgetown."

Robin'],"['', '']",[],"['police', 'girl murdered', 'mexico']",[],"Chief Johnson puts on her latex gloves, points to the scrape of her leg, referring to a girl pulled from the water run-off in L.A. EMT's are in full force helping to gurney the victim out of the drink into an awaiting ambulance. They are mindful the Chief has a job to do as well, where Brenda points to an indentation on her cheek, indicating she was struck. Brenda surmises she probably was not killed here, the victim's underwear is missing, could you get her to the morgue please. I want to notify the parents before the press does.

At the mother's home, Brenda informs her of the body recovery, the mother is hysterical with the news. The man standing next to the mother is her cousin, Alejandro, gardener for the same family-employer. Brenda and Sanchez listen to the mother's cries.

Dr. Crippen, Medical Examiner, estimates the time of death to 46-52 hours based on the time in the water and the amount of decomposition; Brenda confirms the time span between two and eight PM on Monday. Crippen begins with the rape kit exam, Brenda is obligated to observe, she soon has to leave the autopsy room and sit in the hallway. Dr. Crippen sits with her after he has completed the autopsy. The camera shot shows the marked abrasion on her cheek. Blunt force trauma to the head is the cause of death, the blow so strong it broke her neck, the lungs were empty, she died before she hit the water. The bruise on her was caused after death, there was sexual assault, a lot of ripping, a lot of tearing, she was a virgin. The DNA was washed away by the river water, there is nothing to collect for evidence. There was no evidence of torture, whatever happened to her she did not hurt for very long.

Det. Gabriel enters the Phillips house, employment home of Carmen Alvarez and her slain daughter, Marta. Mrs. Phillips assures Brenda that Marta and her mother were treated like family, asking what kind of monster would do this to a sweet girl like Marta? Hart Phillips comes into the kitchen area, reintroduces himself to Brenda, saying he has to leave, but they can talk later, as he has an appointment he has to attend. Austin Phillips, the son, describes a person of interest in the area, seen always carrying a camera, average height, dark hair and average weight.

Chief Johnson invites Austin and his mom to HQ to look at some photos of known sex-offenders in the area. Austin recognizes a picture, asking who he is. Brenda and Gabriel dispatch themselves to the house of Wayne Mathers, he answers the door, they enter, are introduced to Vera Mathers, Wayne's mother, who doesn't like the intrusion and suspicion from the LAPD. Wayne asks if he could change his shirt before they go downtown with pictures he has taken. Brenda sends Det. Gabriel out the back to watch so Wayne does not leave by the window, while Vera Mathews coughs repeatedly, smoking a cigarette and using an inhaler. Brenda asks Vera if she was home last Monday between two and eight PM, when a gunshot rings out from the bedroom. Wayne has shot himself dead on his bedroom floor. Gabriel calls for assistance, grabbing the weapon from Wayne's bloodied hand.

Brenda is in the murder room declaring she wants to know if Marta was the only child Wayne was able to find, in view of the many illegal children in L.A. Lt. Provenza comments on not being able interview the dead Mr. Mathers for a confession. Chief Johnson responds to the lieutenant's snide comment by informing all of the two-hundred-fifty-seven or more twelve-to-thirteen-year-old missing Latina girls. Illegals are prime targets for child molesters, Brenda wants to know if Marta was the only one Wayne managed to find. Brenda also would like to know how Marta got into that river. Brenda asks Gabriel to assemble a crew to dig up Wayne's backyard looking for any more victims. She also wants to know how Marta got that bruise on her cheek. She sends Provenza to Marta's school to talk to her teachers, to find out who her friends were. Chief Johnson requests, let's see if we can figure out how and when Wayne grabbed her; the choice of victim in this case is usually based on availability. Lt. Tao to look at Wayne's computer and Det. Sanchez to run photos by Marta's family. I want to go to sleep at night knowing we buried the killer and not his crimes.

Brenda and Sanchez are interviewing Alejandro trying to get a handle on the identity of Marta's killer. She places pictures of men in front of him seeking recognition. He does not ID any and claims it was his fault she was killed. He asserts it was he who brought up Carmen and Marta from Mexico, acting through a coyote and paying the $2,600 cost for each. Sanchez knows he is lying; the money is too much for him to have. Sanchez yells at him, he doesn't get a lawyer, illegals are not entitled to counsel. Brenda pleads with Alejandro for any information he can provide regarding the rape, beating, and dumping of Marta Alvarez into the river. Brenda advises Det. Sanchez about his temper, she wants to find out all she can these people, not scare them away. She sends the detective on a mission to find all he can about Alejandro.

Lt. Provenza meets Brenda in the hallway having nothing to report from the school but he has delivered Vera Mathers to her office. Brenda puts out Vera's cigarette, no smoking in her office. Vera says her son was a drunk, he didn't take pictures of human beings, he took pictures of flowers in parks and gardens. Too often he would be found with his pants down, having to pee, passed out in a park full of little kids; he was arrested and charged with the wrong crime, she insists her son was not a sex-offender. Wayne would never hurt a kid. She shouts disparaging remarks about the ethnicity looking at the picture of Marta. Vera blames Brenda for the death of Wayne.

Chief Johnson inquires who was aware of Carmen's weekly schedule? Carmen Alvarez answers very few people knew as she packed her daughter's belongings. Brenda learns firsthand Marta received good grades at school, evidenced by an A graded paper. Brenda admires Marta's work when she learns Mrs. Phillips returned the backpack to Carmen saying Marta forgot it at their house. Marta's backpack and notebook contained a handout Brenda holds in her hand dated the same day Marta disappeared. Brenda asks Carmen if she could borrow the school items, promising to return them. The expression on Brenda's face when she sees the date of the handout signals an alarm in her head.

At HQ, Brenda goes through the school items informing Det. Gabriel the Phillips' house could be the crime scene, requesting him to alert Mrs. Phillips of that fact, also Chief Johnson has Sgt. Gabriel get Wayne Mathers' photographs from SID, immediately. Lt. Tao requests Lt. Provenza's help him look at the photos. Mrs. Phillips is startled someone could have been in her house and taken Marta. Brenda asks if they could look around, getting her to sign a consent form. Austin Phillips takes a call from his father explaining the police are at the house. Lieutenants Provenza and Tao show each other pictures of flowers from Wayne's collection. Hart Phillips dismisses the police revoking the signed consent form. Provenza shows a photo with the date and time indicating the same hours the little girl was killed. Brenda is calling a judge for a warrant to enter the Phillip's house and search the premises. Det. Sanchez is putting a warrant out for Alejandro and Provenza calls Brenda with the photo find. Brenda asks Lt. Tao if the time, date could have been tampered with on Wayne's camera. Sanchez tells Brenda Alejandro has left the area, probably returned to Mexico, and Carmen has returned to Mexico. Hart Phillips is seen through their home glass doors, conferring with his wife and son, when Brenda informs him of the warrant she just received to search his house. He requests Chief Johnson for a place to talk; they head downtown while Mrs. Phillips and her son say they refuse to stay in the house. Brenda informs them their cars are staying pending investigation, Leslie and Austin leave indicating they will ask the neighbor for transportation, while SID searches.

Brenda meets Pope in the hallway learning Hart Phillips is waiting for his attorney who claims he is close; she is mad attorney Banks has taken so long to get his client's interview, certainly delaying the interview for a lame reason. Hart begins his story while constantly looking at his watch and asserting he was having an affair with Marta, particularly over the last two weeks. His story becomes harder to accept when claiming he dumped the body in the river. He states he paid Alejandro to bring Marta and her mother back from Mexico, like he did with the former housekeeper who got pregnant. He continues to fabricate his story by saying he panicked when Marta pulled away from him and slipped on the steps, justifying why he did not call the police or an ambulance. He wrapped her in a blanket, put her in his car and dumped her body in the river, thinking she would just float away. Brenda says the autopsy report said she regained consciousness when she hit the water. Hart says he could hear her screams but couldn't get to her before she hit the water. Brenda stands, leans over to Banks, shouting at him if he knowingly delayed getting to the interview, he is in trouble. He turns to Hart asking what that was all about? Brenda runs into the media room telling Pope that Marta was dead before she hit the water, indicating the story she just listened to was just that, a story to gain time for the real criminal to escape. She gets on her phone to Sgt. Gabriel to locate Austin Phillips. Brenda shouts to Pope, he kept us waiting in order to let his son Austin escape.

Lt. Tao informs Brenda Leslie Phillips has left for the border, first in her neighbor's car to the airport, then in a rental car via San Diego. Sgt. Gabriel brings back evidence Austin went on line to find registered sex-offenders, choosing Wayne Mathers, shown on Austin's laptop. Austin had Wayne picked out before LAPD arrived on the scene at the house. The police also found a car jack in Austin's car matching the scar left on Marta's face. Back in the interview room, Banks gets the brunt of Brenda's ire, stating he gave Hart need time to compose himself. Brenda corrects him, you mean time to compose a false confession. She shows Hart the picture of Marta, while he sets his terms for Austin to come back to the U.S. Brenda does not agree to his plan. Brenda to Hart, if I were you Mr. Phillips, I would spend little less time worrying about your son and spend time what I am going to do with you, as she firmly closes the interview room door.

Chief Johnson sits at Pope's desk telling him Leslie Phillips used her credit card to check in at a resort in Ensenada. Brenda requests Pope's help in getting to force a confession from Austin. Pope questions her uncanny ability where Brenda says he doesn't have the faith in her abilities as much as she does in her own. Getting a seventeen-year-old to confess to life imprisonment as opposed to life on the beach seems impossible but he is willing to let her try and hands her two bottles of Cuervo Gold as persuasion for the Federales. Brenda says the Mexican police have a better record with the FBI than the LAPD. Pope understands she is travelling with Agent Howard to Mexico, no escort required.

Brenda enters a room with Agent Howard, Austin Phillips and two Federales. Brenda introduces Austin to Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI. Austin asks for his lawyer. Brenda explains he is not entitled to legal counsel nor does he have the right to remain silent because he is not in the United States anymore. Brenda asks Austin to come with them back to the U.S., Agent Howard affirms he will charge Leslie Phillips with crimes keeping her in a Mexican prison for three years, surviving that, she will be transferred to an American prison where she will spend the next fifteen years. Brenda says your father will be charged with aiding his mother in helping you to escape to Mexico. Austin refuses to leave Mexico under any circumstances, even though Chief Johnson and Agent Howard state the money he thought was accessible isn't, your credit cards are frozen, there is no ATM access. No cash, no parents, no allowance, no hotel, there is a significant difference between visiting the beach and living on one. Austin shouts he is not leaving no matter what you say, referring to Brenda's deal.

Brenda bluffs a proposal with Fritz about letting the parents go free if Austin details what happened at his home with Marta. Brenda turns to Austin declaring freedom for his parents if he tells what happened. Austin asks then you'll unfreeze their assets? Brenda responds yes I will unfreeze their assets, but I want to hear the truth. Austin talks about Marta's behavior toward him, their getting to together in his father's study when his parents weren't home. I told her this is what meant to be my girlfriend, she went really quiet, running away, she fell down the stairs; it was an accident. Brenda interrupts saying it was no accident you went online to find a sex-offender pedophile you could blame. It is not an accident that Wayne Mathers is now dead because you did not want to be accused again for rape, it was no accident you dumped the body of the girl in the L.A. River. We found her DNA in the trunk of your car, I have evidence to prove it. Austin shouts at Chief Johnson, good for you, now you can leave. Brenda comes back with now you can stay.

Brenda shows an attending Federalé a birth certificate of the victim, Marta Alvarez, proving she was born in Mexico. Just your bad luck, I guess, because you sought sanctuary in the country of your victim. Brenda iterates to Austin Phillips, since you killed a Mexican national you can be tried here for your crime, the police don't like when a naturalized citizen, particularly a minor, is murdered, especially by someone outside of their country. Austin is led out screaming for his mother while she is restrained outside in the hallway.

Brenda uncaps the tequila bottle chugging a few ounces, Fritz says he guesses he is driving. They decide to stay the night. Sgt. Gabriel is shown herding Kitty's kittens, mentioning the Chief can relax, he will handle the home front."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542966/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,Brenda tangles with a meddling deputy D.A. as she investigates a butler's possible murder made to appear as suicide.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Tawnia McKiernan'],"['', '']",[],"['police', 'sibling rivalry']",[],"The Dutton driveway gate is locked, none of the siblings know the code for entry, Brenda arrives with a bench warrant for the Dutton butler, who is supposedly in the house but not responding. Gabriel explains to Brenda the Duttons are locked out of the home of their late father because of the will. Brenda pulls a patrol car up and parallel to the gate, gets on the hood and climbs over the barrier. Gabriel follows her inside the house, only to find the butler hanging out back on a rope from the flag pole, with the big ladder on its side lying nearby. Gabriel lets Provenza inside the yard with everyone else. The Duttons are staring at Albert, the butler, hanging just out of the rear entryway.

While Deputy D.A. Yates introduces himself to Brenda at the crime scene, he identifies the victim hanging from the flagpole as definitely Albert Turner. Yates came looking for Albert because he did not show up in court today. The body crashes to the floor of the foyer, and Brenda requests no one touch the body other than the coroner's staff, in view of the broken glass caused by the fall. Yates affirms he was trying Albert for the death of the former Mrs. Dutton, Angelina. Brenda quips, that seems like a waste of time. Chief Johnson invites attorney Bloom come by her office tomorrow afternoon and she needs Gabriel to request a quick autopsy, to determine the cause of death. She also wishes Lt. Provenza to secure the crime scene until the body is removed. Chief Johnson leaves with her familiar thank you all very much, saying so nice to meet you to DDA Yates.

Attorney Bloom is in Brenda's office informing her of his position in the Dutton family. Albert Turner was indicted for killing Mr. Dutton's widow. Bloom utters indicted, but not convicted. Bloom adds his entire practice exists solely to handle their affairs. Albert was on bail, taking care of the house, and Bloom also represented him. Bloom continues to reveal everyone hated Angelina Dutton. She changed the will, benefiting the Dutton children far less than were originally granted before the marriage. Albert was on an agreement to be taken care of for his life. Brenda queries Bloom, who do you think killed Angelina Dutton? Bloom leaves Brenda by snidely saying he would not want to speculate on that, but he and Albert spent their careers straightening out after the Duttons.

DDA Yates comes to Brenda's house stating they got off on the wrong foot the other day. Brenda shoots back with that was because it was in your mouth. Yates reveals he doesn't believe Albert Turner killed himself. He helps Brenda with the dirty kitchen by drying while she washes the dishes. Billionaire Roland Dutton fell in love and married a stripper, Angelina, who later died of an overdose. Yates insists he believes Albert never had any part of her death, he was just simply an easy target. Yates offered Bloom a deal for Albert, just wanting to know which of the Dutton children did it. Dennis Dutton has a history of violent behavior. Ten years ago, he beat his girlfriend with a golf club, going overseas until the best witness against him died in a car accident. Yates pleads for help from Brenda in finding the killer of Angelina and Albert. Deputy D.A. Yates blatantly apologizes to Brenda for his prior condescending behavior. His request includes getting the coroner to re-examine the body and determine Albert's death was not suicide.

Brenda watches Provenza's interview of Albert, the Lieutenant is proud to say the butler did it, but Brenda has Buzz rewind the tape to show a cane draped over the chair next to Albert in the interview room. Next, the coroner inspects the corpse closer to find a degenerative joint disease, arthritis severe enough to prevent him from ever climbing the ladder found at his hanging. Det. Gabriel and Chief Johnson receive news from Dr. Crippen upon further review he declares Albert Turner's a homicide. He couldn't possibly have carried out the suicide by carrying the ladder from the garage, drunk and on pain medication for his arthritic hip, hoisted himself up the ladder, tying himself to the flagpole with the rope and hanging himself.

Brenda's plan is to do a background check on the latest victim then call in the Dutton's for further questioning. Whatever reason they can find for inviting the Dutton children to HQ will be pursued. Deanna Dutton is picked up for possession of a controlled substance by Det. Daniels at a nightclub. Detective Sanchez and Officer Susanna Walsh pick up Delvin Dutton at a bar for solicitation of Sanchez while Walsh stands aside while the pair talk price. Delvin tries to pick up Sanchez and gets busted with Walsh cuffing him at the bar. At HQ, Brenda requests a complete financial check on Albert from Lt. Tao, when Attorney Bloom enters her office complaining she picked up the Duttons without allowing him to hear from them beforehand. Gabriel interrupts their conversation stating the reason they couldn't find Dennis Dutton because the District Attorney's office picked him up last night. She interrupts Yates while Dennis sits at the table in the D.A.'s office. Attorney Bloom arrives and scolds the D.D.A. and Brenda for holding Dennis. Yates asks Dennis where he was at the time of Albert's murder and he claims he was at home. Brenda demands to know how Dennis made a living while he was in Switzerland and Bloom explains he handles all the Dutton finances, providing all the children with an allowance.

As Deanna is vomiting in the toilet her attorney is asserting her alibi for killing Albert. Deanna was sequestered at a rehab in Malibu when the murder took place. Devlin sits in an interview room ask for Julio to interview him. Brenda summons Julio, the arresting officer, to join them in the interview room while his fellow officers watch. Devlin provides the name of the hustler he was with when Albert was murdered. Devlin also provides Brenda with financial information explaining where the money comes from to fund his reckless behavior and that of his sister's drug supply.

D.D.A. Yates shows Brenda pictures of Cristine Berringer, Dennis Dutton's former girlfriend, indicating the Dutton's don't take rejection very well. That picture was taken a few hours after she broke up with Dennis. Brenda has Yates exit promising to share information in the near future as she is getting signs her officers are finding information. Lt. Tao informs Brenda James Bloom has Dutton's endurable power of attorney to handle the Dutton's business affairs, he controls all the family finances, in fact he runs the company. Albert had an account opened by wire in Geneva two weeks after Angelina died; five million dollars held in certificate of deposits automatically renewed every ninety days, except it was reversed last Friday afternoon in the name of Dennis Dutton. Provenza announces he was wrong, he has the fingerprint analysis he hands Brenda; the ladder was wiped clean at Albert's place of death. Provenza quips, I doubt if he wiped the ladder clean after he was declared dead.

Gabriel enters declaring shots fired at the Dutton house. Brenda declares it her lucky day because she didn't know how she was going arrest the Dutton children again. In the Dutton house with attorney Bloom present, Brenda requests an explanation. The explanation doesn't work with all arguing amongst one another, so Brenda has them all arrested to be interviewed together, a group therapy session Brenda chides Bloom.

All the Dutton's are in the interview room with Bloom and Yates. Brenda assumes, in front of everyone, that whoever murdered Albert also murdered Angelina. Deanna was in rehab when Albert was murdered, however, a search of her house revealed a supply of Vicodin. Chief Johnson said we found Vicodin in Albert at the autopsy, which does allow for a prevailing conspiracy potential. Yates adds how do we know you did not share those pills with your brothers and they didn't drug Albert. Bloom insists he removed the supply of drugs from Deanna's house last month and the months before when he dropped her off at rehab, which he promises he will testify to in court. Brenda is satisfied, well that's good enough for me, Deanna, you can wait in the hallway. Devlin announces he has already proven he had an alibi, but Brenda comments you have said you had the gate passcodes, so you could get in and out. Why would Devlin kill the family butler, if Albert killed Angelina he obviously made the children fabulously rich, suggests Bloom. Brenda puts up another argument when Bloom declares Devlin did not have the passcodes, he stole the remote control when you found Albert's body. He gave the remote back to Bloom after Dennis shot at him. Yates probes Bloom, would you willing to swear to that in court as well? Bloom declares I would. Well then Devlin, you can wait in the hallway with your sister.

Brenda queries Dennis, where did the source of the five million dollars Dennis received by wire come from? Bloom explains after the incident with the former girlfriend, Dennis was never allowed access to any of the funds. Bloom signs a waiver for Brenda to validate the issuance of funds restricted by the will and controlled by Bloom. Well then, Mr. Dutton, would mind waiting outside for a moment please? Dennis compliments Bloom on a job well done. Yates speaks to Bloom, congratulations, once again you have helped a murderer go free. Brenda speaks to Deputy D. A. Yates, if you had been listening carefully, someone just confessed; why Mr. Bloom. Brenda speaks to Bloom, thanks to you, the Dutton children all have concrete unbreakable alibis and you were the only one left with the motive, means and opportunity. Yates looks at Bloom, my god, you took the drugs from Deanna's house, only you and Albert had the passcodes to the gate. Brenda adds, and you were the only one who could transfer funds in and out of Dennis' account. You signed this waiver for us to check the validity of the transfers. We discovered you gave Albert five-million dollars. That was an advance on his inheritance. Then why did you take it away? After Mr. Yates offered him a deal you transferred that money out of Albert's account and into one held by Dennis. And why would you have done that because you knew Albert was going to die.

Yates speaks to Bloom, Angelina was liquidating the company, hiring all new attorneys. You spent your entire life straightening up after the Duttons, always around the family, but never really a part of it, that's hard. Killing people, maybe a real Dutton could get away with murder, but not you. Now, you're a good attorney, you know what we're going to find. Yates declares, I am going to trace all of these cash transfers to and from Albert, right back to you. Aren't I James? Bloom is still standing and appeals to them; will you take the death penalty off of the table? Yates responds, if you confess to both murders right now? Bloom sits, reflects by saying, the only thing I really regret, is killing Albert, that was too bad, I'm going to miss him, but I'm really sorry I never got the opportunity to knock-off those horrible children. Is there a chance I could plead insanity?

As Brenda tidies up her office, Dennis Dutton stops by to trade quips, and Chief Johnson has the final word, be careful what you wish for Mr. Dutton."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542961/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,The investigation of the murder of a Middle Eastern businessman and his bodyguard is complicated by the FBI who believe the case to be related to terrorism.,[],Not Rated,Release date,['Rick Wallace'],"['', '', '']",[],"['police', 'fbi']",[],"Brenda and Gabriel are seen driving on the way to a murder crime scene, when Sgt. Gabriel gets fed up with his boss's directions and inquiries as she squints to see anything. He stops the vehicle, gets out and returns with sun glasses for her. He explains this is L.A., the sun shines 329 days a year; that squint is not working for me. She likes the shades, indicated by her smile, as they head to their destination.

Priority Homicide officers with patrolmen are on the scene. Dr. Wm. Graham, whose smock is smeared with blood, is giving details to Sanchez when Brenda and Gabriel arrive. Iranian businessman Razi Moktari and his driver Jeffrey Sanders are found fatally shot in a parking garage. Det. Daniels updates Chief Johnson on the identity of the bodies on the garage slab. Lt. Provenza points out Layla Moktari is sitting in a black-and-white unit, and she speaks to women only, giving Det. Daniels her initial story of they were leaving her doctor's appointment and getting into their car when a black SUV driving by started shooting from the vehicle. Det. Daniels says Layla did not get a good look at the shooters driving by. Dr. Graham is Layla's physician and he was the first person seen when police arrived. Lt. Tao adds the husband was probably dead before he hit the pavement, as he demonstrates to Brenda details of the actual shooting. Lt. Provenza notes the gun in the hand of the bodyguard-driver, there is no evidence of him firing a shot. No evidence of casings left from the bodyguard, indicating all casing were from the shooter. Lt. Tao found eleven casings, he comments, possible a professional hit. Brenda issues assignments to her officers seeking more information of the scene, telling a patrolwoman to secure the parking garage, nobody in or out, until she says so. Two FBI agents roll up, Brenda greets them, they claim the purpose for their presence is to observe. They do refuse Lt. Provenza's effort to escort them away from the crime scene, as directed by Chief Johnson. Agent Jackson explains to Det. Gabriel he does not take orders from LAPD. After bumping Provenza to the ground, they back off to their vehicle, making it obvious they want something from the incident. Layla made mention to Daniels she feared the US Government was involved.

Taylor stops Pope in the hallway informing him of the FBI threatening to pull their people off six cases they are collaborating, namely a drug-gang sting because of Chief Brenda Johnson's recent actions. Pope is also informed by Brenda of the incident in the garage between Jackson and Provenza. Agent Jackson promises Pope and Brenda there will be an FBI liaison-agent assigned to them in order to share any information within national security parameters.

Security cameras were shut down at the time of the shooting per Gabriel, so identity of the alleged get-away vehicle is not available. The wires were cut from the security system, indicating the shooting was planned. Eleven confirmed casings were found at the scene, all from the shooter, and all forty-caliber. Sanchez informs the group of bodyguard Sanders being the real deal, with an unblemished service record together with a similar record in private practice. Lt. Tao identifies the type of weapon and Brenda assigns him and others to find any leads of other crimes with that weapon. Brenda learns Agent Howard is the newly assigned liaison officer, as he enters her office through the hallway door.

Agent Howard addresses Brenda's staff, providing them with lists of suspects, commenting to Brenda they are not the friendliest group I ever met. Brenda responds with they are slow to warm up. Chief Johnson and Agent Howard head out to visit with the wife and son at their palacious home. The house furnishings have been damaged when the FBI came to search the premises. An ambitious search was conducted as noted by the damaged furnishings. Layla conveys to Brenda the changes Iran experienced and how it affected them in LA. Agent Howard grills Layla's son, Faraz, while Brenda listens to his mother. Her daughter has asthma, aggravated from the dust rising from the recent FBI raid. Her name is Fatima and she is up in her room, resting.

Daniels confirms flight reservations were made for the daughter Fatima, and mother Layla, next week to Iran, no ticket for the father or son. Gabriel states no vehicle left ten minutes before nor after the shooting. Brenda responds then the car is still there. Gabriel is assigned to check all the cars in the garage and Brenda asks him to see Taylor for additional help with the search. While in Taylor's office, Gabriel gets the help of Lt. Flynn with the search of garage-vehicles, Flynn is assigned by Taylor. Tao shares internet information from a patriot site on a suspect with Agent Howard. Brenda tells Fritz they picked him up fifteen minutes ago. Brenda tells Fritz she knows the two million dollars belongs to the government, and given to Moktari to be traced by an FBI middleman, and now it can't be found. Brenda insists there is no evidence to date on Moktari, otherwise he would have been arrested long before he was gunned down.

Dr. Graham exits the interview room, greets Layla, introducing himself from their garage encounter. Layla and her son enter the media room to view a lineup, conducted by the FBI. She does not recognize anybody. Fritz excuses them from the room, when mother and son pause to argue, trading slaps across one another's cheek. Brenda has Buzz record their conversation, as mother and son are separated. They all gather in Pope's office, asking Layla if she wants to press charges. She declines, wanting to go home with her son, who has a temper like his father.

Brenda interviews suspect Craig Sherman, who says he committed the killings, also stating he left in his vehicle afterward. This fact makes Brenda know he is not the killer, just a zealous storyteller, a person simply looking for publicity. Something he said perplexes Brenda, he said things better than they actually happened. There is a physical review of the shooting with Tao placing rods in the two dummies as Provenza pretends he is firing a gun using his hand. Brenda asks everyone why the bodyguard did not get off a single shot during the shooting. Tao and Brenda examine the bodyguard's gun, finding the firing pin was altered with superglue, preventing the gun from firing. Sanders would not have noticed the gun was altered. He would have to take the gun apart to find the change to the firing pin. Whoever did the shooting knew they would not have to concern themselves with the bodyguard. Tao inputs, who had access to that weapon?

A policeman interpreting the son's conversation has him saying he will be alright, you will go home where the air is pure for Fatima, and the people are pure for you. I found father's money, I will look after myself. Gabriel and Flynn enter the media room with Gabriel informing Brenda there are no fingerprints nor blowback on any of the vehicles. Chief Johnson orders Gabriel to release the crime scene, thanking the Sgt. and Lt. Flynn, adding, we will try a new tack on the car in the morning.

Chief Johnson enters her office where Jackson and Pope are standing and Fritz is sitting. Jackson responds to her inquiry about Mrs. Moktari's son being located in a place where Agent Jackson says he is not at liberty to say; he is the son of a terrorist with a lot of money and we need to get it back. Brenda addresses Agent Jackson, although your lack of respect for my professional ability is obvious, I would like to share an observation with you. I think physical torture of people is an unreliable means of extracting information from someone. Pope returns fire with removing a murder suspect is hardly what we agreed to earlier. Jackson comes back with knowing her son is in custody might be incentive for Mrs. Moktari to tell us what she knows. An observant Islamic woman is more like to talk to me than she is to you, Brenda shoots back. Jackson leaves Brenda's office, Chief Brenda quips, so if I can't get Mrs. Moktari to tell me who the killer is, they are going to beat the information of the kid? Both Fritz and Brenda mention they have equally strong feelings for one another and Agent Howard says he is officially removed from the case tomorrow morning. Fritz adds, that is why she is better off finishing this investigation on her own. Brenda responds I appreciate that. Before you finish up your paperwork, I have a favor to ask. If I am expected to get Mrs. Moktari to flip on her son, I need to have something the FBI seized. Get me the daughter's prescription out of the FBI evidence. Pope tells Agent Jackson having a mother give up her son might be a little too much to ask, even for Brenda. Jackson comments we'll settle for knowing where the money got to. They watch the interview together with Layla and Dr. Graham. Gabriel joins them in the media room.

Layla is in the interview room and now joined by Dr. Graham with Chief Johnson. Brenda explains that you two were the only ones to last see the murderer escape, so it would be of great help for some more information. Brenda had one of her best officer's search for that SUV, when it dawns on her, there wasn't one; it didn't exist, there was no get-away car. You two just met one another yesterday, yet it is strange the two of you telling the exact same lie. Then I thought maybe they're just pretending to be strangers. You told me your daughter has asthma and Dr. Graham is a pulmonary specialist; he treats lung disorders. I found your daughter's prescription, and the attending physician is Dr. Graham. The doctor tells Layla it would be better for me to handle this, we want a lawyer.

Brenda responds, if you want a lawyer, I'm handing this over to the FBI, and they have Faraz, I think they might have taken him to Egypt. Layla gasps at the thought of her son gone and in another country. Brenda tells Graham to be silent or be placed under arrest for murder. Layla says she waives her right to counsel. Brenda speaks, someone tampered with this gun, and with your answer, you could be deciding who lives and who dies. Layla screams he wasn't sending me back to Iran, he was sending me back to the 17th century. Brenda requests Layla to tell me what happened. Layla details the crime, stating we planned it on my doctor visit. William cut the wires to the security cameras, and as we were leaving, coming out of the elevator, he walked over to Razi and fired the gun; he then put it in his pocket. He was only trying to save me. Chief Johnson responds to Layla's tearful lament, I am sure you wouldn't have a problem convincing a jury of that. Brenda pauses to mention, what about Jeffrey Sanders, an innocent man killed so you would not leave any witnesses. Agent Jackson walks in with a Federal Warrant for Layla Moktari and would consider it a personal favor if you would turn the doctor over to me as well. Brenda complies.

Agent Howard enters Chief Johnson's office stating to her, they handed Layla over to the CIA. Brenda says they'll send her back to Iran; a rare intelligence asset on the ground. Fritz says we got Dr. Graham. Brenda responds, on a plea deal; probably sign a confidentiality agreement, serve time for manslaughter. The husband is killed and an innocent man was gunned down in the process. She could have just filed for divorce instead. I can't think of a single culture where that is the right way for a woman to gain her independence. So, did you find your money? Razi had half of it, the rest of it is gone, Agent Howard answers Brenda's question. The two leave with Fritz taking Brenda out to dinner."

Meanwhile, Captain Taylor makes a fateful decision about supporting one of his men.",[],Not Rated,Release date,['Gloria Muzio'],"['', '', '']",[],"['african american female detective', 'african american woman']",[],"The episode opens in the morgue, with camera fixed on the examination table. The medical examiner identifies the body in front of him as Lisa Barnes, the victim of meth-amphetamine induced heart failure, found dead at eleven this morning. Presumed to have been the victim three years ago of a serial killer named Bill Croelick, who is on death row for killing her. Taylor tries convincing Pope into ignoring the body of Lisa Barnes which they are standing over in the morgue as the person presumed dead at the hands of Croelick. Taylor to Pope, we misidentified this victim and Pope says what's the alternative? Taylor suggests in Pope's face, do us a favor, send this girl to the crematorium as a Jane Doe, keep Croelick in prison, don't damage the reputation of our department. Pope returns with here is the favor I am going to do for you, I am going to forget you said that. Chief Johnson enters, Pope begins an explanation of events from three years ago with a murder victim, he then hands the update over to Lt. Flynn, the officer on the case. Flynn tells Brenda, Miss Barnes identified through dental records. The medical examiner recaps that the body on the table is Lisa Barnes, dead as of eleven this morning from meth-amphetamine heart failure. The problem is the wrong body mistaken for Lisa, and Bill Croelick is on death row for killing Lisa Barnes; a trial happening some three years ago. Brenda probes, so, who did Bill Croelick kill? Pope counters that is what we need Priority Homicide to find out, before we have him released.

A forthcoming procedure spread by Pope for Brenda in Pope's office. Croelick's method of killing was making certain there was little evidence available for conviction. As Flynn put it earlier, he barbequed his victims. Pope says he cut off her hands and feet, set her on fire twice, pushed her off a cliff in a car. Brenda gives a, sounds thorough. Chief Johnson summarizes for Pope, to arrest Croelick again, we must connect him to the young lady he murdered, and we may have only forty-eight hours before he walks. Pope finishes providing Brenda with information about Croelick, summing she is his type, namely blond.

Brenda is at the murder board having Deputy D.A. Powell explain her part in the trial of Bill Croelick. Brenda directs her comments to Deputy D.A. Powell, please explain some of the mistakes made, start with the body we found yesterday. Powell chronicles Lisa Barnes' last years with her meth habit and Flynn adds what he discovered since it was his case at the time which brought Croelick to justice and eventually prison. Brenda adds, of what you thought was Lisa Barnes. Did you run the dental records through the missing persons database? Powell answers no. Flynn holds up Lisa's driver's license found at the scene, through dental records we identified the victim as Lisa Barnes. Brenda orders Lt. Tao to collects all the files of missing female victims at the time of the crime. Powell mentions Dr. Nelson Graydon did the work-up on the forensics, he is the only forensic dentist in L.A. County. Brenda orders Det. Gabriel to get Dr. Graydon to come in to HQ. Flynn tells Brenda about Anna Tandy, a similar victim from 2000, also his case, and like Lisa, blond and petite. Anna died in much the same way Lisa was, presumed to be Lisa. Powell says there was a witness to Anna's death, and Croelick confessed to the witness he killed Anna, but the witness died before it went to trial. Four days into the trial, the witness overdosed. Left to Powell was a lot of circumstantial data, and a deposition from Dr. Easton, who did Croelick's psych evaluation. Easton interjects his testimony was on the part of Lisa Barnes, not a part of this inquiry. Croelick's acquittal made us sick, states Powell. With Lisa Barnes, it was a chance to finally get him. Provenza chimes in with Dr. Easton had two chances to interview Croelick. Brenda inquires with Dr. Easton, do you think Croelick killed our Jane Doe? Easton says yes, based on the similarities of each crime. Moved to Brenda's office, Easton tells they found his fingerprints on a stainless-steel lighter found at the scene. Easton describes Croelick as borderline sociopath, knows the difference between right and wrong, smart. Easton concludes by elucidating Croelick's family upbringing, making it cringeworthy in his detail. Every woman Croelick ever dated was like his mother, blond, suffering a horrible death at the hands of his father, according to Easton.

Brenda meets Bill Croelick, exchanges artificial pleasantries, while the media room learns he has waived his rights. She excuses the officers standing in with a chained convict, saying she thinks it would be fine one-on-one. Brenda iterates you plead not-guilty three years ago murdering Lisa Barnes, and it turns out you were telling the truth. Brenda requests Bill tell who did die in that accident three years ago, promising to erase the capital conviction, dropping the death penalty. Bill responds with why should he answer any of her inquiries, when he leaves a free man in twenty-eight hours. Brenda departs the room after Croelick makes a point to ascertain she is not too far from assistance.

Brenda greets Roy and Kim Barnes stating she is the bearer of some unique news. Mr. Barnes, your first wife Lisa is dead, again. Brenda says Lisa, found yesterday, dead from a drug-overdose, is news to Roy. We already have a positive identification of the body, we don't need you to see her again. Brenda adds Roy was still married three years ago, the death certificate I hold is more current, and accurate, than the one you signed. Please sign this document for us to swap dead girls. Roy signs the document acknowledging Lisa's recent death. Brenda tells him she wishes she could identify the person he thought was Lisa years ago; she cannot for now.

Dr. Crippen has the body formerly known as Lisa Barnes on the morgue-table with Chief Johnson and Sgt. Gabriel standing by looking at the charred bones. Brenda solicits the M.E. for his help in identifying the body by looking at the remaining teeth. He hands the remaining teeth to Sgt. Gabriel.

Dr. Easton shows Brenda what he had to work with based on dental records and a few remaining teeth from the victim. There is a marked difference between the x-rays of the current victim and those from three years ago. Brenda takes the jar of remaining teeth, thanking Easton she would like a second opinion identifying the teeth in hand. She gives the jar to Agent Howard for analysis and identification rather than rely on the results of unreliable Dr. Grayson. Brenda hands Fritz forty files of missing-women and the jar, hoping he can get a match via FBI forensics. Brenda is asking Agent Fritz Howard to identify the remains of the charred dental work from the person formerly buried as Lisa Barnes. Det. Gabriel informs Chief Johnson she has a visitor, it is Bill Croelick dropping in to say good-bye, he says he cannot talk now, his attorney is waiting for him downstairs. He exits while watched by officers and patrolmen.

Taylor is in Pope's office ranting about Chief Johnson not getting Croelick to give up information. Taylor invites Pope to demote Chief Johnson, allowing the LAPD to get what everybody wants, Croelick back in prison. The proposed demotion will send a message throughout LAPD, per Taylor. Pope mentions Flynn got his promotion off this case, do you think he is creating the evidence? Pope says he is interested in getting this current case solved.

Doctors Easton and Graydon both are demanding police protection from Croelick who has called identifying himself to each and threatening their families. Brenda requests their requested police protection from Bill Croelick. Lt. Flynn declined his protection, saying he could take care of himself, referencing his holstered weapon as plenty of protection.

Croelick surprises Brenda on her front porch, she points her gun at him while calling Det. Gabriel for assistance; I have located Croelick, he is on my porch. Bill says his attorney called him stating the police were looking for him. He claims his accusers framed him. Killed and burned to death was Anna Tandy, using an accelerant of grain alcohol down her throat, according to Bill, but the unidentified girl burned recently, not treated in that manner. Police arrive to haul Croelick away. Brenda looks spellbound after Croelick mentions the lighter found at the scene of the recent murder and the use of the accelerant being absent.

Both Brenda and Crippen stare at the burnt corpse, swapped from the grave of Lisa Barnes. Dr. Crippen, the Medical Examiner, declares the Jane Doe in front of them, is an example of lungs not exploding, however, Anna Tandy, the girl from a few years ago, her lungs exploded. Brenda requests he take-a- peek inside, but Crippen says, tell me Chief Johnson, where do you see an inside? They are looking at a partial charred corpse, hands and feet removed.

Fritz enters Brenda's office with a file, Brenda grabs the file inquiring is this my Jane Doe? Referring to the missing dentist, he may have skipped town, nowhere found. Fritz states, I promise that's your girl, first reported missing June 2002. Brenda declares, she looks almost exactly like Lisa Barnes. Moving into the murder room, Brenda announces, let's hope this girl rings a bell with someone. Dr. Easton blurts out, her name is Samantha Jones, she is chapter eight in my book, I testified at her rape trial. Brenda inquires, and who was the arresting officer in the case? Flynn acknowledges by nodding.

Flynn, Taylor and Brenda are in Pope's office, Pope enters his office demanding to know what is this all about? Explain it to me, Croelick has nothing to do with this Samantha Jones, at all? Some other scumbag raped Samantha, and we had a hell of time getting her to testify against Croelick; the woman was unstable, you ask some of these chicks about it, and they would rather be murdered than sexually assaulted. Samantha said that, it is in Easton's records. Some women cannot deal with rape, when she disappeared, we all thought she had committed suicide. Chief Johnson chimes in with her conclusions. Well, I suppose she could have lifted Bill Croelick's stainless steel cigarette lighter, making sure his prints were still on it, made a copy of Lisa Barnes' license, stolen a car, pushed it off a cliff, chopping off her hands and feet while discarding them in route after setting fire to herself. Maybe she trained for her suicide at the Cirque due Soleil. It seems much more reasonable that she was murdered, and somebody planted the evidence, after the fact, doesn't it?

Taylor has his say stating it is possible this girl, Samantha, did commit suicide. It is possible that someone familiar with the Croelick case, wanting to put him away, could have planted the items. I just think Internal Affairs should investigate this whole situation. Pope enquires Brenda, you agree? Brenda answers no, no I don't, not yet. I would like to have a private discussion with Lieutenant Flynn, if you don't mind.

Brenda confronts Flynn in her office, declaring if you want to keep your job and your rank, you better be straight with me, without all the usual crap I have to take from you. Three years ago, Samantha Jones, a rape victim was murdered, in the same way Bill Croelick kills his victims. Flynn adds, looks that way. She was the same weight, height and color as another rape victim, Lisa Barnes, a drug-addict, living on the streets. Flynn agrees the two women looked alike. I don't know if someone wanted to frame Bill Croelick or someone wanted us to think Lisa Barnes was dead or someone wanted us to misidentify Samantha Jones. Brenda asserts someone planted Lisa's driver's license on the scene. Did you do that Lieutenant? Did you tamper with the evidence because you saw a promotion in your future? Flynn stands, looking Chief Johnson in the eyes, saying no. I had an audit of your investigation, eight print packages came back from the crime scene. All but one of those packages went to the courthouse, why the one? It arrived late, the case was over. The prints were partials and palm prints, it didn't matter, states Flynn. Brenda adds, you mean they didn't match Bill Croelick's. There were palm prints on the car? A direct order issued to Lt. Flynn to get the taillight of that car and the other set of prints. You're not going to move to have me investigated? No; get me the print packages off that car, please; thank you. Brenda exits her office though the back door while Lt. Flynn looks bewildered.

Gabriel is with Roy and Kim Barnes, suggesting they have the right to remain silent, why don't you use it? She is in one interview room and Roy follows Gabriel to another room. Brenda explains to Dr. Easton, here is what I think is plausible, but that's not where I would like to be, going into an interview. Doctor you will be wearing an earpiece when you interview these people.

Everyone wanted us to think it was Lisa who died in that car, she had been missing for a long time, she was a drug addict; it is possible she was dead. With Roy's first wife declared legally dead, he can marry the second time. What I want to know if Roy or Kim or the two of them could plan a murder this complex. Most important thing, I need you to have him grab a glass of water and leave it in the room when they go. Can you do that? I need to get their palm prints, but I need to do it legally. When someone leaves their glass behind deliberately, that means they don't consider it theirs legally, and can take the prints off it, even if I don't have probable cause to ask for it. I will be right in your ear trying hard not to bother you.

Gabriel enters the media room saying they each declined counsel, saying they were both innocent and it was too expensive.

Easton greets Roy Barnes. Roy says I remember you, you're a psychiatrist. You testified at Lisa's trial.

Easton tells Roy, there is a thought you might have murdered Samantha because she looked like Lisa, and you thought that Lisa was dead. Easton drinks his glass of water, palming the glass as he lifts it. Roy does the same as he drinks from his water glass. Roy says I gave up looking for her long before she turned up dead. Easton invites Roy if he wants to take his water, he declines, as Easton leads him out of the room; both water glasses left on the table as the two men exit. Lt. Tau enters the empty room wearing latex gloves, taking Easton's glass.

Brenda to Easton through the earpiece, I have a couple of questions before you go into see Kimberly. The murderer had to be someone who knew exactly how Croelick kills his victims and someone who knew how to manipulate Croelick into picking up his stainless-steel cigarette lighter, so it could be dropped later at the crime scene. Kind of like you manipulated Roy into picking up his glass just now. Someone who knew Bill Croelick smoked a lot, someone who knew how he operated, like the way he moved with Anna Tandy.

Easton enters the empty interview room noticing the glass missing was his, not Roy's; Tau is inspecting the print from Easton's glass and Tau tells Brenda the print is good, we got a match. Brenda reminds Easton of the palm print on the back of the car Samantha Jones was in when you pushed her off the cliff. I warned you doctor, don't leave the glass behind, and you abandoned it. You were the only one who said Miss Jones was suicidality depressed; Brenda reads Easton his Miranda rights. Easton runs, but stopped by an angry Lieutenant Flynn. Easton demands an attorney and Provenza says he will get him a phone book.

Taylor meets up with Flynn, saying well, that's one arrest that's really going to cost her. Flynn returns with you want to gloat to someone you're close to? Grab a mirror, Captain. I'm applying for permanent transfer to her squad.

Croelick meets Chief Johnson in the HQ parking lot. Imagine Dr. Easton having an affair with a rape victim then murdering her just to keep it quiet, what a monster, wouldn't you say? Brenda answers him, I don't believe in monsters."

Robin'],[''],[],"['african american female detective', 'african american woman']",[],"Priority Homicide is called to a Hollywood home where a naked man is draped over the edge of an outdoor poolside hot tub, face down, bottom torso in the water. Loud music is playing, a liquor bottle is present, a wet robe is in a nearby chair and Lieutenant Provenza is giving orders to his fellow officers in his best Chief Johnson exaggerated southern voice. The orders include SID be called to the scene, secure a background check on the victim, identify any fingerprints on the bottle, summon neighbor calling into police and get an estimated time of death. As he is issuing his directives, Brenda congratulates him on his choice of excellent ideas.

Detective Sanchez informs the Chief the victim's name is Dick Pruitt, Hollywood producer, found alone in his present state. Detective Daniels brings the neighbor over to talk, Pruitt's wife and son moved out yesterday according to Daniels. Lieutenant Tao assesses the use of alcohol in the hot tub, giving the tequila to SID, Brenda picks up the wet robe, smelling like chlorine. Brenda begins her directions for the officers, find the spouse, I would like to talk with her, I'm surprised she is not around, identify any prints from the cd player, Lieutenant Flynn is requested to do the honors at the morgue and Lt. Provenza to get the hair piece to SID.

Pope hands Captain Taylor an internal anonymous complaint issued regarding Chief Johnson's working with the District Attorney's office and the FBI. Taylor feigns surprise at the complaint declaring how serious the document could be while Pope wishes it be made to disappear. Pope informs the Captain if there is any complicity in the charges being brought to IA then Captain Taylor could be brought forward to IA, also; assuming he had a hand in the complaint. Pope advises the Captain he will be acting on the complaint straight-away.

The murder room meeting yields information on Dick Pruitt's arrest record including DUI's and a wife refusing to press charges after being assaulted by him, the autopsy report from Lt. Flynn found water in the lungs, he did not cook, he drowned, with a BAC of 0.16. Detective Daniels announces the toupee evidences there might have been a struggle, for it was expensive and was not easily removed. The water saturation indicates he was in the hot tub for at least three hours. Brenda needs the finger prints on the cd player be secured, the know-it-all neighbor will be visited again and I plan on seeing the spouse at her parent's residence, her father is a concert pianist, according to Det. Sanchez.

Brenda summons Gabriel to accompany her, but beforehand, meets Pope at the elevator asking when he was going to tell her about the anonymous complaint. Pope says he never planned on telling her, he was trying to make it simply go away, as it reflects badly on him as well. Brenda looks at him, iterating conduct unbecoming. Pope summarizes, it is in my hands, go solve your case. He gets on the elevator while Sgt. Gabriel stands off, but within earshot.

Brenda sits at the dining table with Pruitt's wife, Amelia Pruitt, her mother, Delia Lopez, her father Alonzo Lopez, guest Dennis Burke and Sgt. Gabriel. Amelia is at her parent's home since she left her house days ago, Dennis Burke, Alonzo's master student, claims they were all dining when the incident happened with Mr. Pruitt. Amelia doesn't know what the argument with her husband the other night was about, as Brenda questions her, seeing the bruising around her neck and wrists. The Lopez's wish to be alone after this initial questioning. Brenda excuses herself and Sgt. Gabriel, they exit the house, in the driveway, Brenda mentions murderers need air-tight alibis, while Gabriel seems to think Amelia has one.

Deputy D.A. Powell and FBI Agent Jackson are in Pope's office discussing Chief Johnson's competency versus her dismissive attitude. If IA were to contact you regarding Chief Johnson, Pope enquires, your concerns her intra-agency relations are considered bad. Pope proposes a meeting with the two individuals and Captain Taylor, since he is the anonymous source.

Sandy DeCourt, Dick Pruitt's agent, is there to be interviewed by Brenda, per Lt. Flynn. Sandy is very open about her client's behavior, saying he played around, and she would have killed him too, if she was in love with him, but she wasn't. She got dismissed by him recently, no specific reason, so she could be a suspect. While she is talking to Brenda about her former boss, Gabriel is in the media room inquiring about the IA complaint which everyone knows was Taylor's doing. Sandy says Amelia did it, she says I know she did it.

Back in the murder room Provenza and Sanchez cannot believe Amelia could have killed Pruitt, hold him under water until drowning. Daniels wants to show Sanchez how she could do it while the other officers observe. Daniels is behind Sanchez with his feet below him, in a sitting position, he is able to stand with her on his back, but Daniels proves it with Sanchez's feet up, level on a chair; he cannot stand up. Amelia possibly could have accomplished the task with him relaxing with his feet elevated in the tub. Pruitt's feet show marks on them as Brenda held up a photo, indicating he struggled causing the abrasions on his heels. Flynn takes a call from the neighbor. Brenda says she will go visit him at his home. Where is Sgt. Gabriel? Provenza volunteers to go with Brenda.

Gabriel is in Taylor's office declaring he would tell IA the charges against his boss are small-mined, petty and malicious; he is ashamed of whoever may have filed them. The charges further make him sick to his stomach and you will excuse me Captain, I am investigating a murder. Taylor tried to play the role of the aggressor, but Gabriel leaves him speechless as the Sergeant exits.

Pruitt's neighbor, Mr. Mitchell, says the argument he heard was with the girlfriend, overhearing how she worked on the recent project, how she was too expensive for what she did, identifying her DMV picture Provenza shows him. Mr. Mitchell identified her car as well, saying that was her in the picture. Mitchell also said the gardener was present that evening, he saw the truck. Interviewing the gardeners proved neither could understand English, likely eliminating them when they chose to invoke counsel. Sanchez asked them questions in Spanish evidently eliminating them as suspects.

Pope meets Brenda in her office informing her of the planned meeting in his office. She will be there as scheduled, after listening to all his scenarios. Essentially she is expected to apologize to all three, promising to do better, where IA will turn to Taylor exposing his accusation as frivolous.

Chief Johnson and Sergeant Gabriel have been waiting in the Lopez residence for twenty minutes, Brenda enters the den where Dennis Burke is playing the piano. He replays the works he just completed by touching the control on a recording device attached just below the keyboard. Brenda and Gabriel witness the device and hear firsthand what it is capable of doing. Dennis uses the piano when he cannot secure a practice piano at school. He speaks very highly of the family and reflects on exactly where everybody was in the house the evening of the murder. Alonzo retired to the piano room to practice for an upcoming concert, Delia Lopez took her husband in a plate of food leaving Dennis to be with Amelia. Amelia was not in the mood to chat, going upstairs to her room. They continue to probe where everybody was with Dennis answering questions, when Delia enters vouching for her daughter being up in her room. Delia summarily dismisses Brenda and Gabriel threatening harassment charges. Brenda mentions you will have to take a number and she leaves with the Sergeant. At the car, Brenda comments the subway would have allowed sufficient time to commit the murder and attend the concert.

Lt. Tao goes over the train schedules while referring to a map. Lt. Flynn describes the unlikelihood of backtracking from the trains to the Pruitt house. Provenza brings up the truck reported parked near the Pruitt's; college students drive such trucks. Lt. Tao mentions the cd player did not have any prints on it, it was wiped clean, maybe it was brought to the scene. Brenda invites Tao secure the footage of the security cameras of the subways around the time before the murder and after. Let's look for such a truck parked in one of our subway stations and include the impound lots. Brenda has Provenza and Flynn retrace the train travel routes including a car-drive to the Pruitt house.

Brenda takes time to clearly state how she will attend the meeting tomorrow regarding the complaint about her and she has enjoyed working all the people in the room. Interrogating people, getting to the truth and knowing the right thing to do politically are two very different things. In fact, to do either of them very well, you pretty much have to ignore the other. Brenda interjects that she might not be here tomorrow after the meeting, and she compliments every one of the officers how great it has been working with them. She leaves for the evening. Provenza says the smart move is to not get involved until the dust settles. Flynn fires back, that is the smart move, what is your idea? Provenza grins.

Brenda is likely thinking of the long day ahead while sitting at her desk when Lieutenant Tao enters with pictures from the surveillance cameras, there was a truck found in the impound lot taken from a subway station lot and a cap found in the truck matching that worn by the subject in the pictures. Thank you Lieutenant Tao, have Sgt. Gabriel meet me outside of Pope's office, I am going to have to speed out of here like the wind. Tao comments we are pulling for you Chief. Thank you Lieutenant, that means a lot.

Brenda enters Pope's office, Chief Pope, I want to thank you for arranging this meeting. Brenda to Deputy D.A. Powell, I would like to start with you Miss Powell. I'd like to say how sorry I am, that I was unable to ignore your general level of incompetence in the wrongly obtained conviction in the case of Bill Croelick and I am sorry if you felt hurt and defensive about putting a man on death row for the wrong crime. I certainly hope that will never ever, ever happen again. Brenda turns to FBI Agent Jackson. Agent Jackson, I deeply regret that the FBI handed over two million dollars to a man on the terrorist watch list without the capacity to trace it or manage to follow him for months without knowing his wife was having an affair with her doctor; and, I hope you do much better in the future. Brenda to Captain Taylor, Captain Taylor, I suppose I should apologize to you for not having been born in Los Angeles, but having seen your work up close now for several months, I can honestly say that, try as I might, I can't think of any fair and reasonable system on earth where I wouldn't outrank you. I hope that clears everything up. Thank you very much. Pope smiles discretely, well, she did say she was sorry. Brenda leaves Pope's office.

Chief Johnson is at the Lopez residence, Amelia answers the door, Brenda orders her to stand aside or Sgt. Gabriel will escort you downtown. Gabriel puts Dennis Burke in his place, with I suggest you step aside. Brenda moves to the studio, blocked by Delia Lopez. After asking her who she was with when her son-in-law was drowned in his hot tub, Brenda exclaims exactly no one, looking to Sgt. Gabriel, arrest Delia Lopez for the murder of Richard Pruitt. Stay inside Mr. Lopez, I need you to make a choice who you're protecting with this alibi of yours. Brenda and Alonzo step inside the studio, Brenda closes the door, he says my daughter is a victim herself, can't you see that? My wife is not a murderer.

Brenda gets the truth from Alonzo. I know she was here, referencing his daughter, but where were you? Pictures blown up to show him getting on the subway near his house, wearing the cap found in the truck, he is pictured getting off the train at Western and Hollywood, pictured coming home from his son-in-law's house, his clothes damp from drowning Richard Pruitt and finally a pic coming home as fast as you can, riding the escalator at the subway station. Brenda dumps the cap from an envelope, stating here is the cap you bought from a used-car dealer off Melrose. Alonzo picks the first photo claiming it is not me, I was here playing the whole time. Brenda begs to differ, pushing the play button on the recorder attached to the piano, music playing. Brenda directs you didn't keep Dennis around here for Amelia, you kept him around for yourself. Dennis was stalled at the dinner table so he could say he heard you playing in the next room. Your wife came in with a plate of food, restarted your program while you were gone, making Delia an accessory to murder. Brenda's phone shows Pope is calling, she reads Alonzo his rights declaring he is under arrest for the murder of Dick Pruitt. Brenda prompts him if he would waive those rights, leaving his wife free of involvement, leaving her surprised he was not in the room when she bought the food into him. Alonzo consents, he says yes to waiving his rights, so his wife could visit him in prison. I do waive my right to an attorney, my wife and daughter are not involved. I murdered that filth who beat my daughter. I protected my family like animals are allowed to do, as I have the right to do.

Pope is speaking from his office directly to Taylor, it doesn't make any difference what Jackson and Powell said; there's a limit to what the Chief cares about that. Taylor thinks he is not alone on looking at all grievances, but Pope reaches into to his briefcase with proof to the contrary. In it are transfer-request-papers from all officers in Priority Homicide declaring they want out of the division if Chief Johnson is put somewhere else or worse. Now if some one wants to be responsible for getting rid of some of the finest officers picked for Priority Homicide in the first place, I guess I can't stop them. If the Chief decides this was a colossal waste of our time and resources, there will be serious repercussions. If, on the other hand, this complaint was to suddenly disappear, low I am to suggest it, there is a promotion available. Taylor finally looks toward Pope, saying Commander Scotts position. Pope adds, one rank below Deputy Chief, any chance you might be interested? Captain Taylor perks up, grinning.

Sgt. Gabriel is clearing the murder board with Lt. Tao, Buzz is nearby, Pope is in Brenda's office handing her the transfers, obviously not to be honored as she remains in her position. Brenda exits her office, grabs the wastebasket, walks in front of the murder board, so, we have a summation of a case to write. She begins assigning tasks to the officers. She calls their names from the papers before discarding them, one by one, in the wastebasket. Pope passes by noticing all is back to plan in the murder room.

Brenda finishes by saying if you want, Chief Pope tells me at the conclusion of a successful case you all gather at O'Malley's to celebrate, so if you would like, I want to buy you all drinks; everybody agrees. Brenda retires to her office, shuts the blinds and enjoys a chocolate treat."

Up in the penthouse, Rosco tries to connect with his teenage son, Parker Rosco, who behaves aloof but placating. Rosco becomes worried about something, and decides to leave immediately for London, calling an old friend to try and explain his concerns. Before he can, he steps through a projected illusion of his elevator, and falls down the shaft to his death. The scarred man downstairs removes his equipment, and leaves without a trace.

In London, teenage schoolboy Alex Rider and his best friend, filming enthusiast Tom Harris, discuss going to a big party that Alex's crush Aisha will be attending that evening. Later Tom brags about having the address to the event on his phone, but the teacher confiscates it for having it out during class. After school, Tom coerces Alex into using his skills to get the phone back so they can go to the party and meet Aisha and Alex gives in, using parkour to climb the building and reenter the school through the roof access. He makes it down to the classroom and successfully picks the lock on the desk drawer with a paperclip, but is caught escaping by the returning teachers. Alex is driven home by his uncle and guardian, Ian Rider, who chastises him for his rule-breaking, and forbids him from going anywhere for the weekend. Alex complains to the Riders' housekeeper and Alex's former nanny, American immigrant Jack Starbright, saying that his uncle is too strict and rigid. Jack reminds him of the adventures and exotic trips Ian has taken him on throughout his life, and suggests he cut him some slack. During dinner, Ian watches news coverage of Michael Rosco's death, saying that he was a client of the bank Ian works for. Alex recognizes Rosco's some Parker from a prank video he made the previous year, remarking he looks very different since Rosco sent his troublemaker son a to remote boarding school to straighten him out, which fascinates Ian. Later, Ian searches through Parker's social media and finds the name of the school: Point Blanc. Jack comes to see him and tells him she has passed her exams and gotten her university degree, after six years of part time classes while working for the Riders. They start to discuss the possibility that she might move on now that Alex is nearly grown, but Ian gets an urgent call.

Tom calls Alex on his laptop about the party, but Alex tells Tom that Ian has grounded him. Ian comes in and tells Alex he has to go to the office for the evening, and asks him if Point Blanc was the name of the school Parker Rosco was sent to. Alex is confused, but confirms the name sounds familiar, and Ian leaves. Alex takes advantage of his absence to sneak out of the house and go to the party. Ian picks up his partner, Martin Wilby, who informs Ian that he ran down the lead Ian gave him, and has arranged a rendezvous with an informant. They arrive at an empty industrial building, and Ian retrieves a gun from a secret compartment in his car. Alex meets Tom at the party, finding it packed with schoolmates. They mingle with their fellow teenagers, drink, and enjoy themselves, though Alex's attempts to connect with Aisha fall somewhat flat. Meanwhile at the warehouse, Ian and Wilby become suspicious of the strangely quiet meeting place, and are confronted by the scarred man who assassinated Rosco, Yassin Gregorovitch. Yassin and Ian seem to know eachother, and Yassin admits killing Rosco. Before Ian can act, Wilby turns his gun on him. Ian is shocked by Martin's betrayal, telling him he doesn't even know who he is working for, and won't live long enough to enjoy the money. Yassin apologizes to Ian for what he must do, and shoots him dead. The job complete, Yassin shoots Wilby in the arm and instructs him to call in the murder to his superiors. Alex returns home from the party to find a police car outside his house. The officer tells him and Jack that Ian was in a deadly car crash, and has been killed. A shocked Alex asks to see the body, but the officer tells him that Ian was driving over the speed limit, and his body is too damaged for viewing. Alex and Jack are left to grieve.

The next morning, Alex goes to Ian's study and finds a scribbled note on Ian's desk, 'Point Blanc'. Across town, a male and female agent and a group of forensic workers are at the scene of the murder, taking Ian's body away. The agents are joined by their leader, who is informed that Ian and Martin were attacked by an unknown assailant who left little to no trace. Martin is hurt, but alive. The leader goes to speak to Wilby, and asks the agents to talk to Alex. The female agent remarks sadly that first the boy's parents are killed, and now his uncle. They go to the Rider home, and introduce themselves as colleagues of Ian's from the 'bank'. The woman, Mrs. Jones, offers their condolences for Ian's passing. Alex tells them he was told his uncle was driving over the speed limit when he was killed, which Ian never did. The man, Crawley, says sometimes people make mistakes, but Alex insists Ian never did. Mrs. Jones gives Alex her number on a business card for the bank, and tells him to call if he needs anything. On their way out, Alex mentions Point Blanc, and asks what it means. Neither of them recognize the name, but they promise to look into it. Their leader, Alan Blunt, debriefs Wilby about the attack. Martin claims that Ian called him with a lead about a cyber-attack they've been investigating. Blunt doesn't understand how someone behind a cyber-attack could possibly get the drop on people like them, and throws the idea of the attack being connected to that case out. He asks Wilby if Ian mentioned anything else, but Wilby insists that was all Ian told him.

Tom comes to visit Alex, and finds him frustratedly hanging up with a hospital. Alex frantically tells Tom that he has called every hospital and mortuary in the city and no one has records of Ian's body ever being entered. He starts to wonder if the story behind Ian's death was completely fabricated, returning to the fact that Ian would never, ever drive over the speed limit. Tom thinks he is just in shock over his loss, but Alex is determined to find out the truth. Realizing that Tom's phone is still in Ian's car, he asks Tom if his phone tracker app is activated, and has him access it's location. Mrs. Jones goes to see Blunt, and shows him evidence collected from Michael Rosco's death, as well as from the death of a Russian billionaire who also had a troubled teenage son. Both men sent their children away to a school called Point Blanc. Jones credits Alex with unwittingly making the connection. Alex and Tom follow the GPS towards Tom's phone and make it to the industrial complex. Alex sneaks in and see Crawley overseeing a group of people cleaning up the scene and towing away Ian's car, ordering everyone to use a cover story if they are asked about the activity. Alex records this as evidence, but is confronted by an agent. Alex easily incapacitates the man, and he and Tom spot Crawley leaving the scene. Alex asks Tom to go home and cover for him while he bikes after the car. The vehicle drives downtown and into a building apparently under renovation. Alex is able to slip in through the gates right after the car, and finds himself in an underground parking garage. Crawley finds him following him, and brings him in for a talk. Alan Blunt observes Alex, who has been brought to an interview room and is being held for breaking in. Blunt remarks that Alex has shown incredible skill and intelligence in figuring out who they are, let alone finding them. He says he is exactly what they need. Blunt has Alex brought to them and shows him the truth about his uncle. Ian never worked at a bank, but was in fact a decorated war veteran, and an agent with the Department, a subdivision of the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. Blunt runs the operation, and Ian was one of their best field agents. He tells Alex that Ian was shot and killed while doing his job, and they never was a car crash, which Alex already knows. Blunt says that Alex is his uncles nephew, which is good, because they have a job they'd like him to do. Alex is furious that he has been lied to his whole life, and angry the Department let Ian get killed. He refuses Alan's offer, and storms out. Blunt tells him to call them if he changes his mind. Mrs. Jones expresses her disgust at the idea of using a juvenile as an agent, but Blunt tells her they have to adapt, or they will lose the fight.

The next day, Alex tells Jack that someone killed Ian, but doesn't get a chance to tell her what he found as the doorbell rings. Immigration Officers arrive at the Rider house and demand to see Jack's visa. They proclaim the document void and order her to accompany them for deportation back to the United States. A social worker arrives at the same time with more officers to take Alex away to foster care. Alex tells them all to wait and without even dialing, picks up the phone and tells whoever is listening that he will do the job. The officers and the social worker all get a call, and leave without a word. Jack is shocked and confused, and Alex leaves the house without explanation and gets into a waiting car with Alan Blunt."

Michael Rosco was one of two recent high-profile accidental deaths, the other being Russian gas and oil tycoon Gregoriy Serenkov, who's troublesome teenage son Stepan was also sent to Point Blanc. Ian was building a friendship with Serenkov before he died, as the Department thought he could be a useful asset. The connection to the deaths and the school is too big of a coincidence for them to ignore, but the Department cannot step in without cause for investigation, and the only ones who can get into Point Blanc are troubled ultra-rich teens. Mrs. Jones tells Alex his mission will be to blend in with the other students and simply observe and report any strange findings. Alex is resolved to help find whoever is responsible for his uncle's murder. The next day Alex prepares for school, but Jack wants an explanation for the dramatics of the previous day. Alex tells her it was just a misunderstanding and Mr. Blunt sorted it. Jack does not believe him, nor does she understand how a man from the bank could have such influence, but allows Alex to go to school with a promise to talk about it later. As he leaves, Alex is observed by someone in a parked car. He arrives at school and is met by Tom, who asks what happened when he followed the car. Alex tells him it was nothing, but Tom starts spouting his own theories. Alex tells him he got it wrong, it was just a crash, but he is approached by Aisha, who expresses her condolences and support. Tom agrees it was brave of Alex to come to school, and they separate for class, but Tom still does not believe Ian's death was accidental.

Crawley comes to see Mrs. Jones with the ballistics report from Ian's murder, showing a match to a Korean standard-issue pistol. Ian was in charge of helping a North Korean defector make it out safely, and theorizes they must have found out who was responsible and used a military gun to send a message. Jones wonders if perhaps the evidence is too perfect. Meanwhile, Alex is pulled from class to meet with a grief counselor, Geoffery Daniels, who is permitted to speak with him alone. As soon as the headmistress leaves, Daniels tells Alex he is actually from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and is aware of the truth behind his uncle's death. Alex is wary of the strange man, who provides identification to prove his credentials, and tells Alex that the Department is an outdated branch of operations, that Alan Blunt is an unscrupulous man that has turned the Department into an all but a private agency for his own purposes, and Daniels has been waiting for an opportunity to bring him down. He suspects Alex may be the key to Blunt's undoing, and asks Alex if the Department have asked him to work for them, a highly illegal and unethical action. Alex doesn't say anything, and they two are interrupted by Tom walking in on them. Daniels quietly warns Alex to be careful of anything Blunt asks him to do, and to watch out for others that might be interested in his activities. During lunch, Tom invites Alex to come around that evening and wind down with a movie marathon, which Alex agrees to. When Tom leaves, Alex calls the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and briefly reaches Daniels, confirming his identity.

Alan Blunt has returned from meeting with Sir David Friend, a British billionaire who runs a food and farming empire, and suggests to Mrs. Jones that the family would make a good cover story for Alex. They Friends have a daughter, but Alan has learned that she will be away while Alex would be there. Mrs. Jones is still disgusted at the thought of using a grieving teenager in dangerous field work, but Blunt orders her to be Alex's handler, and asks for continuous updates. Alex and Tom bike home from school, and go their separate ways after planning to meet up later. Before Alex reaches home, he is run into by a van, which stops as two masked and black uniformed men get out and drug him. Alex is abducted as the van speeds away. That night, Alex awakens, handcuffed and blindfolded, as the van arrives at its destination. He is dragged to an underground complex and brought to an interrogation room, and his blindfold removed. A man enters, Wolf, and tells Alex that there is no hope of anyone finding him, and tells him to answer one simple question in exchange for his freedom. He asks Alex what his uncle Ian's real job was. When Alex tells him he worked at a bank, Wolf warns him that lying will come with consequences.

At the Rider residence, Jack answers the phone to Tom, who is calling to see if Alex is doing okay, since he never showed up to movie night. Immediately worried, Jack hangs up and tries to call Alex's cell phone, but he does not pick up. In the compound, Wolf asks Alex a new question, and demands to know about Point Blanc. Alex tells him it just means a close range gunshot, but Wolf gives him a last warning not to make things worse by trying to deceive them. Alex is groggy from the drugs and from hitting his head on the van, so Wolf gives him some water. He asks again about Point Blanc. When Alex denies any knowledge, he is dragged away to a large empty room and chained to a chair. When the guards leave, bright lights are switched on, and extremely loud rock music is played from the speakers. Alex composes himself from the initial shock, and begins to sing while staring at the CCTV camera. In the monitor room, Wolf watches along with three other soldiers. His lieutenant, Snake, remarks on Alex's resilience, and Wolf reminds her that the boy is nothing but a subject. Meanwhile, Jack has tried over and over to get in touch with Alex, and has even called the Police in an attempt to report him missing, but the cops assume he is just a teenager staying out late, and refuse to take any action for the night. Jack calls Tom and demands the password to Alex's laptop. She finds a finished upload of the video Alex took at Ian's murder scene, and recognizes Crawley from his and Mrs. Jones' visit to the house, and finds the business card with Jones' phone number.

Back in the interrogation room, Wolf shows Alex he has files on both Jack and Tom, and threatens to make them give up the information Alex is hiding. Alex asks to see the file, and becomes distraught at the sight of his friend's photos. Wolf promises to send him home if he cooperates, and asks again about Point Blanc. Alex gives a glib answer and throws the file in Wolf's face, and is put back into the torture room with more loud music. Jack has called Mrs. Jones to the house, and tells her she knows that she and the others are spies. She has made copies of the video and the information and sent it to law firms across the world, and warns Mrs. Jones that if anything happens to her, they will blow their operation wide open. Impressed, Jones asks what Jack wants, and the housekeeper demands to know where Alex is, but Mrs. Jones does not know.

After Alex resists another round of ear-splitting music, it is finally turned off. Pipes in the ceiling are activated, and begin dousing him in freezing cold water. Wolf, Snake, and the others watch from the monitor room as he is forced the sit through the deluge. Snake speaks up against their treatment of the boy, despite Wolf's claims that they are only doing their job. She does not back down, and her concerns are shared by the other two members of their squad, Fox and Eagle. Snake asks Wolf to turn off the water, and Wolf allows it. However, as the water subsides, they see that Alex has escaped, using the paperclip from the file to pick open the cuffs. They sound the alarm and run out after him. They are unable to find him on the thermal cameras, as the cold water has lowered his body temperature. Alex just barely manages to hide as the squad begins a systematic search of the grounds, and slips past two of them in the darkness. He runs for it, but is lost in the compound. He finds what seems to be the road leading out, and spots a car approaching. He runs to it and yells for help, but to his surprise, Geoffery Daniels steps out. He tells Alex to get in to his car so he can take him to safety, but Alex doesn't understand what he's doing there and is extremely suspicious, refusing to go with him. Daniels pulls a gun on Alex as his captors find and surround him. Alex, having realized the truth of the situation, dares Daniels to shoot. When Daniels hesitates, Alex asks if he has passed the test. Mrs. Jones arrives and orders everyone to stand down. Daniels is actually a Department agent called Smithers, as are Wolf and the others. She aborts their mission, and Wolf tells her they need to talk. Jones orders him to put it in his report, and tells Alex to come back with her so she can take him home. Alex is angry, but goes with her.

Alan Blunt reviews the footage of Alex's questioning with Smithers and Crawley, who tells him Wolf reported that the boy seems to have been conditioned against interrogation and torture. They surmise that Ian must have taken the precaution, along with teaching him self defense and other physical skills. Mrs. Jones enters and demands to know why she was not informed about the operation, and Blunt tells her they had to be sure Alex was up for the task ahead of him. Jones tells him never to go behind her back with her agent again if he wants her to be his handler. Blunt tells the group that the operation at Point Blanc must stay a close secret between the four of them only. Jack cleans up Alex's cut, and tells him to walk away from whatever they are asking him to do for them. Alex tries to convince her that he won't be in any danger, but she doesn't trust the Department. Alex says he has to find out who was responsible for his uncle's murder, and bring them to justice no matter what. Jones meets with Wolf, who wants to know who Alex is and why they were asking about Point Blanc. Jones can't tell him anything, and Wolf tells her that Alex was genuinely scared during the interrogation, but was using it to hold back the information, a technique that suggests he's been training for something like this his entire life. Even so, Wolf can tell that he does not want to be a spy, and thinks she and Blunt are forcing him. Alex has no idea what he's being trained for, and Wolf warns Jones that if Alex dies during this mission, she is responsible.

Smithers shows Blunt and Crawley the security footage from Michael Rosco's death, just outside the elevator, showing him seemingly step right out into the empty lift shaft. However, Smithers has worked out what really happened, and demonstrates a life-like hologram technology. He tells them that only a few agencies in the world could be capable of setting up something so advanced. Meanwhile, Martin Wilby returns to his apartment to find Yassin waiting for him. Wilby tells him the Department have bought their evidence of a North Korean hit team, there has been no talk of Yassin or Point Blanc. Yassin is pleased with Wilby, and reminds him to get in contact immediately if anything changes. Across the city, Alex enters the Department Headquarters to begin briefing for his mission. Blunt congratulates the boy on his performance during the 'training exercise', but Alex is only interested in getting on with the mission, finding out out who killed Ian, and never seeing Blunt again. Mrs. Jones and Smithers fill Alex in on the details of his cover. He will pose as Alex Friend, the troubled son of Sir David and his wife, Lady Caroline. Their daughter is also a juvenile delinquent, so Alex should fit right in. They have created a cover story for why the Friends want him in Point Blanc, and to help sell the illusion, Alex will live with the billionaire couple at their estate for several days before being brought to the school. All the pieces are already in place, and Alex will begin his mission immediately.

At Point Blanc, high in the French Alps, the headmaster of the school, Dr. Greif, listens to his right hand woman, Eva Stellenbosch's concerns that they might be moving too quickly, and their activities may be noticed. Greif tells her they had always planned for one last student, and Alex Friend will be perfect for their plan."

Stellenbosch has just contacted Sir David about possibly bringing Alex into the school, but she has requested a meeting with the teenager first.

Alex goes to school, but the cut on his head worries Tom, who offers to find a way to get revenge on whoever beat him up. Alex tells him it was just some random troublemakers, and brushes him off on his way to class. After school, he returns home to find Mrs. Jones waiting for him. She checks on his progress with learning his cover identity, though Alex has thoroughly memorized every detail. The Department have also circulated a fake news story of the billionaire's heir pulling a dangerous prank at a private school, which has already gotten the attention of the administration at Point Blanc. Alex demands the Department return Tom's phone, since it has nothing to do with Ian's murder or their mission, and Mrs. Jones agrees. She addresses Alex's distrust of her and the Department, and possibly even of Ian, but tells him that despite all the lies, one thing that was clear was Ian's love for Alex. She tells him Ian really was their friend. Alex isn't convinced of her motivations for telling him this, but she simple says she is sorry for what happened to his uncle. She tells him the operation will be starting soon, gives him and Jack a credit card, and instructs them to make Alex look the part. Jack takes to the task with vigor, and soon Alex has a new haircut and clothes to help him sell his role. He goes to school, and his new look attracts the attention of several female students, including Aisha, who invites him and Tom to meet her and her friends for a movie. Tom is less impressed with Alex's transformation, but he and Alex readily accept Aisha's invitation. They walk home together, but on the way Alex is called in to the Department. He makes an excuse to leave Tom, who calls him out for lying to him for days, and asks to see the text. Alex says its private, and Tom assumes he plans to meet with Aisha alone. Alex insists its nothing like that, but can't tell Tom where he is going. Tom drops the matter and lets him leave, and Alex sadly parts ways with his friend.

At Department HQ, Alex is given a final briefing about Point Blanc and its few students. Smithers gives Alex a special device to take with him; an MP3 player that secretly functions as a communication device for texting messages to the Department. This way, he can keep them updated on his progress, as the school will likely confiscate the phone they are giving him. He is informed him that Stellenbosch will be coming to meet him soon, and he is being sent to the Friend mansion immediately to blend in for a couple days before she does. Alex is frustrated at having to blow off his friends yet again, but has no choice in the matter. He is brought to the Friend Estate in Surrey, and introduced to Sir David, and the overly sedated Lady Caroline. Sir David gives Mrs. Jones a message to bring to Alan Blunt, that after this service to the Department, they are even. Alex is shown to his room, as well as an entire private wing in the massive manorhouse, and is told that the Friend's daughter, Fiona, will be gone while he is there. Back at the Department, Martin Wilby is back at work. Crawley tells Blunt that he has conducted a thorough investigation, and Wilby''s story regarding Ian's murder checks out. Blunt is still skeptical that an outside force could have identified the ever-careful Ian and targeted him, and concludes that either Wilby is telling the truth, or he set Ian up. Crawley redoubles his efforts to investigate.

The Friends and Alex share an awkward dinner, and Lady Caroline shows concern over the young man's involvement in the Department's dealings. That night, Alex texts Tom with another excuse for missing the movie, and asks him to send Aisha his apologies, which only frustrates Tom further. The next morning, Sir David takes Alex to shoot clay pigeons, and teaches him how to shoot. He privately tells him that he cannot trust Alan Blunt, who will always see him as merely a tool for his use. Alex picks up the gun technique very quickly, and tells David that he is well aware for Blunt's machinations. That afternoon, the Friend's petulant and spoiled teenage daughter, Fiona, comes home early from her week away, having apparently had a nasty break up with her boyfriend. Sir David and Lady Caroline quickly speak with her about Alex. Fiona is annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with Alex because of Blunt's blackmailing Sir David, but reluctantly agrees. Tom storms into the Rider house to try and find Alex, who claimed he was ill. Finding him gone, Jack tries to tell him that he has gone away for a while with some friends, but won't tell Tom who. Tom knows she is lying, and angerly rants to Jack about Alex's behavior towards him, and him blowing off Aisha after so long trying to get her to notice him. He thinks that the same people who were involved in Ian's sudden death have gotten to Alex. Jack tells him she believes him.

Alex wanders the mansion, memorizing every room and detail. He comes across Fiona in the pool, who is impressed by his instant recognition of her. At dinner, She tells Alex all about the family's illegal activities, mockingly in the name of him bettering his cover by knowing their secrets. Later that evening, Alex is informed his pizza delivery has arrived. Confused, Alex goes to find Tom at the door in disguise, and they go to Alex's room to talk. Tom confronts Alex about all that has happened since Ian's murder, and Alex admits everything. Tom tells him that Jack is incredibly worried about him, and Alex tries to convince him that his mission is nothing nearly as dangerous as what Ian was doing, only looking around a school and coming back. Tom asks why they had to threaten him and Jack to force Alex's compliance if the mission would be so easy, and Alex has to admit how he got his previous injury. Tom tells him that the Department are not really on Alex's side, but he and Jack are, and makes Alex promise never to lie to them again. Alex agrees, and on the way out Tom tells him to be careful, and to come home quickly, reminding him that Aisha won't wait around forever. While biking out, Tom is nearly run over by several teenage boys on their way into the estate. The boys enter the estate and are greeted by Fiona, who happily reunites with her boyfriend, Rafe. Alex finds the group and Fiona introduces him as a 'charity case' the family has taken in for a few days. Rafe and his two friends are polite, but all four clearly look down on Alex. Nevertheless, they invite Alex to go walking with them in the morning. Alex is tense, but accepts.

Crawley tells Wilby to go home and rest, but Wilby refuses, wanting to continue investigating Ian's murder. Crawley tells him that the Department know who killed Ian, and since they cannot do anything to retaliate, they are dropping the case, to Wilby's shock. The next morning, Alex meets the Friends, as well as Rafe and his companions, for breakfast, and the other teens tell him they plan to go shooting while on their walk. Alex is nervous about the change of plans, but Rafe offers to lend Alex his father's antique shotgun, and they give him a location in the woods to meet them later. Alex goes to the woods and waits, but no one else shows up. Suddenly, bullets start to get fired at him, but Alex cannot see the shooter. He makes a run for it, narrowly avoiding getting shot as he takes cover behind the trees. He looks to see Rafe and his friends calling out and taunting him while reloading, with Fiona trailing behind. Alex buries himself in the underbrush and hides as the group walk over him, intent on hunting him down. Once they have passed by, Alex sneaks up behind and attacks and disarms Rafe, forcing the others to drop their guns. Fiona and Rafe try to claim it was only a prank, and they weren't really aiming for him, but Alex is livid at their callousness. He lowers the gun from them, but hurls Rafe's antique shotgun deep into the underbrush when he has the audacity to ask for it back, and heads back to the manor. He makes it back just ahead of Eva Stellenbosch, who has arrived for her meeting with Alex and his ""parents"". Mrs. Jones tells Alex to relax and focus, and sends him in to wait for Stellenbosch while she and other agents monitor him from another room. Sir David and Lady Caroline meet her at the door and thank her for her prompt response to their message, and take her in to see Alex. He plays the part of the extremely belligerent and spoiled son of the billionaire couple, the Friends convincingly portraying his concerned parents. Stellenbosch psychoanalyzes Alex, and the team is worried she may have seen through his cover, but Alex has successfully fooled her, and she concludes he is in dire need of rehabilitation at Point Blanc. Stellenbosch informs him and the Friends that he will have zero contact with them while he is at the academy, which requires total isolation in order to enact their radical teaching methods, and tells him they will leave immediately. From the monitoring room, Mrs. Jones and Smithers spot Fiona marching back to the house, furious, and making a beeline for the room where Alex and Stellenbosch are meeting. The Friend's housekeeper, secretly a Department asset, tranquilizes her and hides her out of sight just before she can reach Alex and blow his cover. Stellenbosch and Alex get into a car and are driven away. At home, Jack waits alone for any word of Alex's status, and Tom begins working on a video documentary of Alex's spywork. Far away in the French Alps, Alex and Stellenbosch arrive by helicopter at Point Blanc academy."

Also, Haley and Nathan grow closer until Brooke spreads a vicious rumor that leaves Haley devastated.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Robert Duncan McNeill'],"['', '', '']",[],"['undressing', 'locker room']",[],"Tree Hill High is abuzz about the evening that Dan (Paul Johannson) and Nathan (James Lafferty) are holding at their household. All the Ravens have been invited, as well as all the cheerleaders. Everyone seems to be going, except Lucas (Chad Michael Murray). When he tells this to Peyton (Hilarie Burton), she begins to flirt with him, telling him about a book she read exactly like their lives. But in order to find out the ending, he has to go tonight. Meanwhile, Nathan is being tutored by Haley (Bethany Joy Lenz). Mentioning the event, he realizes he hasn't invited her and feeling guilty, apologizes but can't invite her as it is only for basketball. Haley isn't really bothered but wants him to do some studying and gives him a revision kit with everything in and tells him just to contact her if he needs any help. At the cafe, the event seems to be discussed all over Tree Hill with the adults too as Karen (Moira Kelly) and Keith (Craig Sheffer) are talking about it. After they both have received invites, the two wonder whether they should go or not. Keith is quite adamant that he is not going to his brother's do, but Karen is undecided. That is, until Deb (Barbara Alynn Woods) walks in. She asks and persuades the two adults to go, Karen gives in and changes her mind. Keith, however, thinks it will be too weird and tells Karen it's because of what he told her the night before. Karen then pretends she knows nothing about the whole situation, subtly telling Keith that she has forgotten all about and not to worry about it. In class, Brooke begins her normal routine- stirring up others' relationships. She tells Nathan that Peyton is still interested in him. At practice, Jake (Byran Greenburg) arrives late as he normally does and Whitey (Barry Corbin) just lets it go without any questions. Lucas asks him, why he is always late, but Jake remains silent. On the way home, Peyton offers Haley a lift home where they have yet another conversation about the Scott brothers. When Haley told Peyton that he cares about her, Peyton asks who, and Haley replies both of them. Also, like the previous two times the girls have spent together, Peyton tells Haley to be careful, a comment Haley is sick of hearing. At the night of the event, Lucas changes his mind and decides to go with Karen and Keith, who has also changed his mind. Just before they set off together and leave Haley in the cafe, she tells Lucas she likes Nathan and that it isn't her fault, like it isn't his fault he likes Peyton. Still unhappy, Lucas is forced to be okay with it but tells her to be careful, just like Peyton. At Peyton's house, Brooke tells her that Nathan is still interested in her. It could possibly just be working the situation so she can get Lucas. At Dan's house, Deb tells him that Karen and Keith are coming. Dan sees it as a nightmare and just a way for them to ruin his night. The doorbell goes and Karen, Keith and Lucas are waiting to be let in. They plan to make a signal 'coo' if they need to escape. Karen just tells them to stay away from Dan and they'll be fine, that is until Dan answers the door and the four are left to stare at each other. Once they have been invited in and Dan has given a speech about the Ravens, Whitey tells Karen that he is glad to see her, reminding him of previous years. He also tells her how well she has raised Lucas and that she should be proud. Meanwhile, Jake is encouraging Lucas to go and talk to Peyton, but Brooke soon interrupts their conversation in order to flirt with Lucas. As Brooke is talking to Lucas, Nathan goes to talk to Peyton, asking to go somewhere more privately to discuss them. Lucas views this as them two getting back together, making him storm off. As Peyton and Nathan begin talking, they find out that Brooke has set them up to get back together and are both furious that they have believed her. Both of them have a go at Brooke as she walks in and leave her alone in Nathan's room. Brooke then begins rummaging through the drawers to find some more alcohol but comes across the tutoring kit Haley gave to Nathan, which Brooke sees as flirting and takes the box to show to the others. Outside the house, Brooke sets up a game of truth or dare with the other students. She dares Peyton to show her true feelings to Lucas, and to upset Brooke, a furious Peyton passionately kisses Lucas before storming off herself and Lucas follows her. Everyone then insults Brooke at how pathetic she is acting and leaves her once again alone with a drink. In the kitchen, Deb and Karen begin sharing cooking tips together and getting along together. When the deserts are delivered to a different address, Karen steps in and offers to use some of hers from her cafe. Deb agrees and Karen rings Haley to deliver the cakes. Finding each other again, Lucas and Peyton start talking on the front lawn. Peyton tells Lucas the kiss wasn't a game for her. Just as they are about to kiss, with Dan watching from inside in shock, Haley interrupts them with the cakes. The two then decide to leave together, once again being watched by Dan, as Haley is told to stay and enjoy the party after delivering the deserts. As Haley begins to go around the party, she bumps into Brooke who shows her the note. Brooke tells her that Nathan has been passing around and laughing at the note. Embarrassed, Haley storms off without giving Nathan a chance to explain. Finding a room in Nathan's house, Peyton and Lucas are about to have sex. As they get undressed, Lucas tells her he has been waiting so long for that moment. Peyton agrees but seems more interested in the sex than talking. Lucas then stops her and tells her he has been waiting for more than the sex but for them being together. Realizing this, Peyton tells him that is not what they are meant to be doing. She runs out leaving Lucas alone. Dan then goes in the room and begins offering advice to Lucas, he storms off without listening to his father. In the kitchen, Deb tells Karen that she didn't know about Lucas and her until she was married and pregnant with Nathan, only a month after he left Karen. Leaving the kitchen, Karen is confronted by Dan, to whom she tells to stop living in the past and get over it. Meanwhile, Deb advertises the cafe to her departing guests and thinks that eventually there is a chance her and Karen could be friends. Once everyone is gone, she thanks Dan for behaving, but Dan confides in her telling her he has never felt so off balance. Returning to the cafe from Nathan's, Lucas looks for Haley but can't seem to find her. Eventually, he comes across a silent Haley crying in the corner of the cafe, hidden under a counter. Haley tells him about what Nathan did and that Lucas and everyone else was right all along. Lucas comforts her and tells her about Peyton and him. Haley tells Lucas she wants to be alone and he leaves the cafe. Just as Haley is about to close up, Nathan knocks at the door of the cafe, apologizing about Brooke and explaining it wasn't his fault. Not believing him, Haley leaves him locked out and switches off the lights in the cafe. Jake is then seen playing guitar in his room next to a baby's crib, his baby's crib. Also, Peyton begins drawing what just happened between her and Lucas and begins staring at the webcam, as Lucas is doing the same from his house. She then stands up and covers the camera up so no one can see her."

Countries around the world launch nuclear missiles to destroy it before it can destroy the planet, but surprisingly, the missiles have no affect. The reason: this is no comet.

The ball of light enters the atmosphere, and just when it looks like humanity is about to go the way of the dinosaur, the ball slows, hovers, and eventually touches down. Soon after, the light shrinks to an intense point, then explodes outward in a concussive burst, leaving behind 4400 people, including men, women and children of all ages. All are missing persons who have been gone anywhere from a few months to 50 years - and none have aged a day beyond when they were last seen.

The 4400 are rounded up, quarantined, and eventually released back to their families. As they begin to try and reconnect with their ""life interrupted,"" not all is well: soon after their release, some of the returnees begin to experience unexplainable, and for some, uncontrollable new abilities. It's up to Tom Bishop and Diana Skouris, two Homeland Security agents, to unravel the mystery behind the 4400."

But fighting crime can prove deadly, even for a member of the 4400.

Meanwhile, Richard and Lily have moved in together. As Richard struggles to find work, he must also deal with a pregnant Lily's claims that the baby, still in vitro, is able to communicate its thoughts and feelings to her.

Knox has an airtight alibi for the night of the murder, and when another man confesses to all of the murders, the case seems to be solved. But the killings continue - and with each murder, another person comes forward to confess to all the crimes. Forced to contend with the possibility that Knox is somehow convincing his neighbors to commit murder on his behalf, Tom and Diana lay a trap that they hope will prove Knox is complicit in the killings.

Meanwhile, as public sentiment toward the 4400 begins to turn hostile, millionaire Jordan Collier seeks to organize his fellow returnees. After Shawn, Richard, and Lily attend a meeting hosted by Collier, they all find themselves involved with this charismatic leader. However, Collier's intense interest in Lily makes Richard uncomfortable - why is Collier so eager to insinuate himself into their lives?

Elsewhere, when Tom receives news that Kyle's condition has begun to deteriorate, he is forced to confront the possibility that his son may never wake up from his coma.

Mr Carlson is hesitant, fearing the worst but Andy, Venus and Johnny Fever convince him it'll work smoothly.

On the day that Scum are supposed to arrive at the station, Jennifer hangs a large banner in the reception area that reads ""WELCOME SCUM"". Herb talks to Mr Carlson, reading him some of Scum's lyrics, which are violently and sexually suggestive. The band arrives and surprise Herb and Mr Carlson by being incredibly polite and dressed in fine suits. Mr Carlson directs them to Venus, who'll interview them on the air in advance of the show.

While he talks to them in the studio, the band, polite at first, suddenly drops their nice-guy act and begin giving Venus suggestive and offensive answers to his questions. Their leader, Blood, asks if he can say hello to his mother and sends out a stern warning, telling her not to come home if she ""knows what's good for her."" Offended, Venus suddenly stops the broadcast and admonishes them for acting rudely, Blood apologizes and tells Venus to ask their singer, Dog, about his musical training. Dog tells him flatly that he has none. Nigel, their bassist, speaks up and informs Venus that they're not a punk rock group. Blood explains that punk is ""passe, that punk bands ""dress deplorably"" and that they typically don't physically attack their audiences. Dog tells him they don't like audiences. Venus is flustered but agrees to have tea brought to them when they ask for it.

Back in Mr Carlson's office, Carlson, Jennifer, Andy and Johnny are tending to a shaken Mr Pievy, the representative of the band's American recording company. He tells them that on the way to the station he merely tried to give them the time and they suddenly threw him out of the moving limo. Venus appears and tells everyone that the band is dangerous and are currently having tea in the broadcast booth. A knock is heard at the door and, thinking it's the band, they open it. It's Les who tells them there are three ""very well-dressed"" gentlemen who are cooking something in the broadcast booth. Venus panics and runs back there. A frightened Pievy tells them he's bowing out, leaving the station staff to deal with the band. Andy tells everyone they'll go ahead as planned and that Johnny will watch them at their hotel.

At the hotel, the calm and collected Johnny sits on the bed reading a magazine and acting cool toward the hostile band. They begin to show off, systematically destroying the room's furnishings and throwing a bellhop out the window (thankfully they're on the ground floor) but Johnny is still unfazed. When he receives a call from Andy, he tells them the situation is still under control, until one of them rips the phone cord from the wall.

At the show that night, Andy and Venus are excited to see the arena is sold out and the crowd are roaring for the band to come on. Johnny arrives and tells them both that the band, feeling they haven't been treated very well by the station, have refused to go on. When the band arrives, Andy tells them they will go on and that they're ready to fight the band if necessary.

A few moments later, Venus is seen onstage introducing the band, sporting a few bruises and ripped clothing. The band comes on to the delight of the screaming crowd and launch immediately into one of their hits, berating the crowd just before Dog begins singing.

Backstage, Andy talks to Mr Carlson, telling him the band went on without a hitch - he doesn't tell his boss about the fight he had with Scum. The two reminisce on some of their favorite musical acts - Carlson reveals that he's a fan of Benny Goodman. Andy tells his boss that he's a Goodman fan too. Johnny walks in telling them that the band is spraying the crowd with a fire extinguisher and Carlson seems very concerned until Johnny tells them both that the crowd is eating it up as a gimmick. Andy & Mr Carlson prepare to watch the show by stuffing tissue in their ears and walk out into the arena together."

Mr Carlson silently enters the booth, curious as to the song being played, particularly the sounds of barking dogs sampled on the 17-minute track. Johnny appears to be ignoring the station manager, even when Carlson waves his hands in front of Johnny's trademark sunglasses. Carlson hovers over the record player and when he gets too close, Johnny calmly orders him not to touch it. Carlson asks about the ""orchestra"" playing the song and asks if he's hearing dogs on the song, to which the still-passive Johnny says ""I do."" Carlson is still puzzled but tells Johnny to keep up the good work as he slips out the door.

Mr Carlson and Herb Tarlick are working on a Thanksgiving promotion involving a turkey giveaway. When questioned about it by the station's program director, Andy Travis, about it, Mr Carlson becomes mildly haughty, saying he has a lot of great ideas for the station. Andy leaves his boss and Herb to their own devices.

The day of the big giveaway arrives and the station's news reporter, Les Nessman, will do live coverage of the event in the parking lot of a Cincinnati shopping mall. Les sets up in front of a store and begins to describe the scene, stopping momentarily when he's harassed by the shop's owner for standing in the doorway. Back at the station, Johnny is at the controls in the booth while Venus, Andy and Bailey listen in.

Les sees a helicopter fly in over the parking lot, dragging a message banner behind it. Slow to read the message, Les finally reports that it says ""HAPPY THANKSGIVING FROM WKRP"". He then notices a dark object being dropped from the helicopter, then a second one. Believing them to be skydivers, his tone becomes increasingly cautious when he sees no parachutes are opening. After a few more moments he realizes in horror that the objects are live turkeys. Continuing his broadcast (which bears a strong resemblance to the Hindenberg disaster) he says that the turkeys are hitting the ground and that the crowd has begun running away in panic. One turkey hits a parked car. Les continues, saying the turkeys are hitting the ground like ""sacks of wet cement"". He tries to retreat to the store behind him but realizes he can't after annoying the owner.

At the studio, the gang are listening, horrified themselves, when the broadcast is suddenly cut off. Johnny calmly tries to re-establish contact with Les, but hears only silence. Johnny thanks Less, telling his listeners that the shopping mall was just ""bombed by live turkeys"" and ends the broadcast.

Back in the studio lobby, Herb and Carlson return, looking ragged. Carlson says he thought the promotion was foolproof and the two stalk into his office. Les returns to the studio, looking just as haggard as his boss and Herb. He says a man and his family tried to kill him and he only got away by locking himself in a phone booth. He goes on, saying that the helicopter landed in the parking lot and that Carlson must've decided, after seeing the turkeys hit the ground in the drop, that he'd simply free the others after the chopper touched down. Les says things got very bizarre afterward and tries to walk off but Andy stops him, telling him to explain the rest. Les says the turkeys seemed to mount a counteroffensive, turning on their human minders and that they were ""organized.""

A few moments later, Herb and Carlson emerge from the office, still in shock. Carlson says ""As god is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly."""

He looks around to see nothing but destruction everywhere. Like him, many people are walking around in a daze, some crying for help because their loved ones are injured. Many people are dead in their cars, the result of a barrage of traffic accidents. In the background, the scene is repeated everywhere, including several buildings with severe structural damage. He starts shouting for his partner, Demetri Noh (John Cho).

FLASHBACK TO FOUR HOURS EARLIER

Mark is readying for another day at work. He takes his gun out of a safe, only to find a note from his wife, saying how much she hates him. She would appear to be joking as Olivia Benford (Sonya Walger) is in bed, and their daughter is fixated on a morning cartoon. Emerging from under his broken garage door, which Olivia reminded him to fix, their babysitter Nicole Kirby (Peyton List) arrives and agrees to work overtime since Olivia has to work a late shift at the hospital. A friend of the Benfords, Bryce Varley (Zachary Knighton) didn't show up to meet them the prior night, and Olivia gives him grief about it. Judging by the fact that Bryce is walking along a pier and is about to put a gun under his chin as he looks out at some morning surfers, it is obvious he is in some sort of severe emotional stress.

Mark finishes attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting with his sponsor, Aaron Stark (Brian F. O'Byrne), who relays the story of how he began drinking after his daughter's body was brought back from Afghanistan. Mark thinks Aaron should go out with this woman he is trying to set him up with, but Aaron is tired of being badgered, given that he's the sponsor.

Nicole told the Benford's she had to study and would be more than happy to babysit extra hours. It would appear studying her boyfriend while she is on top of him is part of the curriculum.

Mark and Demetri are in pursuit of two suspects and an unknown woman accompanying them. At the FBI's regional office, Janis Hawk (Christine Woods) received the video intel from the surveillance team, and their boss, Stanford Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance), wants the information fast on the two suspects and the unknown woman. However, Mark and Demetri are identified and a high-speed pursuit begins. Aaron Stark continues his job with the power company, Olivia is in surgery, Nicole is with her boyfriend, and Bryce is about to commit suicide.

As Mark and Demetri are about to hit a gasoline tanker, Mark has a vision. He sees hazmat suits, a large bulletin board of information, with pictures, names, and forensic evidence with lines connecting them. He is barely coherent, and he is drinking hard. He writes a question on a desk calendar: ""Who Else Knows?"" He has no time to think, as several assassins, based on their masks and tattoos, enter with laser-guided weapons, presumably to kill him.

Suddenly, he is in his overturned car. Aaron is hanging from a utility pole, his feet stuck in a power line, Nicole and her boyfriend have blacked out, Olivia comes to in the O.R., and Bryce is still alive. Los Angeles is in utter chaos.

Mark locates Demetri, and they try to help wherever they can. Bryce, who is apparently a doctor, goes down to the shore to help several people who may have drowned during the blackout. Worst of all, Mark and Olivia's daughter, Charlie, had a bad dream during the blackout.

CHARLIE: I dreamt there were no more good days.

Mark and Demetri locate the SUV they were chasing. It would appear that only the unidentified woman survived the crash, and Demetri demands to know what she planned to do with the terrorist attack the other two were apparently planning. Mark pulls him off for a moment, as onlookers note that the police and fire departments can't come, and whatever happened is happening all over the country. Demetri convinces Mark to look for Olivia, who is only two miles away. He tries to go, but bodies in the street, people in trouble, and looters have run amuck. Even a kangaroo is on the loose. Several TV's report that the entire planet blacked out, and helicopters fly overhead.

Mark finally contacts Olivia to relay the news, but Olivia's hospital is getting deluged with injuries, including a little girl that seemed to know her name mysteriously. Mark makes it back to the office, where Wedeck briefs him that none of the intelligence agencies can figure it out, but the entire world blacked out for two minutes and seventeen seconds. Wedeck is trying to assess the overall damage between vehicular crashes, plane crashes, and someone just falling down the stairs. However, Mark wants to know about the blackouts themselves, as he remembers parts of his own vision.

MARK: We've been saying that people have been blacking out, but that wasn't my experience.

Mark wasn't the only one. Several of his colleagues had a similar experience. Not hallucinations, it felt more like a memory that wasn't of the past...it was of the future. Mark describes his...

It was April 29, 2010 at 10 PM. (which everybody confirms in their visions)

VEDECK: Are you saying that everybody's consciousness jumped forward six months to April 29th?

MARK: As crazy as that sounds...yeah.

Demetri has brought the mystery woman into the office, since she was still planning to kill thousands of people. Mark tells him about the ""flash forward,"" and an interesting hypothesis comes up. One of their partners was in New Scotland Yard in London during the vision with someone names Fiona Banks (Alex Kingston) when a bird hits the window of a high-rise. They call her and ask if she saw anything, and she corroborates their story. It had to do with the Rutherford case.

Some of the information that people saw in their visions were being confirmed as well, such as a senator brought up on ethics charges, and the Dow rising quickly. A ""Grand Mosaic"" was the phrase used by one of the talking heads, which is what Mark saw in his vision. Operation Mosaic was his case during the future, and it had to do with what was happening.

Wedeck wants more information. Demetri claims he only blacked out, but he was a bit shifty about it. Janis was 17 weeks pregnant in her vision, and she begins to wonder about the father she hasn't even met yet. Wedeck had the misfortune of being in the bathroom, so all he knew was Kobe Bryant tearing a ligament and the Rays swept the Red Sox.

To gather more clues, Janis suggests setting up a Website where people can enter their visions and cross-reference them. Mark realizes they actually do that, and he was following up on leads. Demetri is skeptical, but Wedeck has made the decision to put Mark at point on this. He begins the investigation that Mark has a vision on.

Mark and Demetri start to build the bulletin board he saw in his vision. He adds the names where he can, along with pictures he thinks he saw. Some of the words included ""D. Gibbons"", ""Baltimore"", ""Blue Hand"", and ""Friendship Bracelet"". Mark also had a friendship bracelet on, like one kids would make. Mark also confesses that he had a gun, people in masks were coming to get him, and one of them had a three-star tattoo on his arm. Demetri is upset because he didn't see anything, and he only had one viable reason for it: he was dead six months from now.

Back home, Nicole tells Mark that Charlie was OK, and she had been watching the news all day. The fact that Mark can't give her any information does not help her peace of mind. At the hospital, Olivia is having a hard time dealing with saving the life of a young boy, only to find out his mother was killed earlier in the day and nobody can locate his father. Bryce confessed to Olivia he was about to commit suicide on Venice Pier that morning, but his vision showed he was alive in six months and his whole life had changed. He thinks it was a sign from God, although Nicole thinks God was punishing the world. Olivia was not as optimistic, as she saw the end of her marriage in her vision.

Mark confesses to Aaron that he was drinking in his flash forward. It wasn't a one-time thing, as far as he could tell. Aaron tries to make him see the positive: perhaps Mark could do something to prevent becoming an alcoholic again. This would appear to be the impetus for their marriage ending. Aaron's flash forward is very unusual: his daughter is alive again. Aaron is convinced that she needs his help.

AARON: You're worried that your vision will come true. I'm worried that mine won't.

Mark successfully fixes the garage door as Olivia comes home. In bed, Olivia asks what he saw. He tells her about being in the office with gunmen coming. He conveniently doesn't mention that he was drinking. She decides not to talk about hers because it was too upsetting. He insists, and she was with another man in her vision. She is in tears, wondering how in the hell she would betray him or cheat on him.

The young boy who's father hadn't been contacted arrives. Lloyd Simcoe (Jack Davenport) wants answers, but Olivia won't be back until morning. He insists that he'll wait for her. He is also the man in Olivia's vision.

As Mark sits outside, doubly-worried about his impending alcoholism and Olivia's infidelity, Charlie comes out and gives him a gift: a friendship bracelet.

At work, Janis has been going through the surveillance feed of every camera she can find. During the blackout at Comerica Park in Detroit, a figure walks along the left-field bleachers while everybody is blacked out. The figure looks around and exits the park."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1480389/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,FBI's LA office has a head start on investigating the flashforward with Mark's vision and by opening a web site.

However, Charlie is not much for playing it, and the other kids tease her about it and rip her stuffed animal. Of course, she fights back, but runs away when the teacher confronts her. On the streets of Los Angeles, they are in a state of martial law. Certainly Mark could have used the military when someone in his AA meeting goes off about the flashes. But he should cut the guy some slack: the man wrecked his father's Ferrari as a kid and almost blew up on a speeding bus. Aaron chides him for lashing out, because at least Mark has a support group for dealing with what happened, something very few people have.

At FBI HQ, Director Wedeck gives a pep talk that is part Mike Ditka, part Casey Stengel. As agents, they don't get the luxury of freaking out, since the public is looking to them to solve this problem, which has become too much for 18 agents who resigned. The Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Anastasia Markham (Lynn Whitfield), is none too happy that the L.A. office took it upon themselves to investigate the blackout, even setting up its own public Website at taxpayer expense. The Mosaic Collective, as the site is called, has received over 800,000 reports thus far. Also, the fact that the blackout occurred at the top of the hour, a 1 in 3600 chance, is notable. Markham is not happy the office is kowtowing to the public's fear of ""hypothetical flights of fancy."" That is, until Wedeck and Janis Hawk show Markham their ""flight of fancy"": the moving figure at the baseball game in Detroit.

Mark and Olivia pick up Charlie at the principal's office. The school advises them to talk with her about her dream, since they hadn't thus far, nor has Charlie at school. They also had to talk about Olivia's dream as well. There was another man in the house, and Olivia clearly had feelings for him. Mark wonders if Charlie saw the same man in her dreams. For now, they reassure each other their marriage won't fall apart, no matter what the vision shows. Olivia takes Charlie to the hospital since their babysitter was AWOL and repairs Charlie's bear, Bryce updates her on several cases, including finding Lloyd Simcoe, the father of the young boy she helped and knew her name. Lloyd appears, and Olivia meets the man she saw in her vision.

Lloyd has been waiting for Olivia for three days to thank her for saving Dylan's life. Lloyd lets her know that Dylan is autistic, he and his wife were divorced soon after the diagnosis, and he hasn't told Dylan that his wife diet yet. Olivia immediately passes off his medical questions to Bryce, and they part ways before Olivia completely freaks out. Speaking of freaking out, Demetri freaks out that Mark is wearing the friendship bracelet Charlie made for him and refuses to take it off. Demetri thinks Mark wants these things to come true, but Mark cuts through the BS and tells Demetri he's panicking over not having a vision and thinking he's dead. They refocus on the task, and specifically D. Gibbons, one of the names on the bulletin board. Local authorities are knocking on doors investigating the 4,000 D. Gibbons' in the U.S. However, Didi Gibbons decides to save them shoe leather. She owns a cupcake store, bringing in a sampling of cupcakes, which immediately get logged into evidence by Wedeck. (Insert donut joke here.) She was hellbent on finding Demetri Noh, since she heard his name in her flashforward. She was arguing with someone on the phone, apparently someone harassing her.

Mark and Wedeck take a break with impounding the cupcakes, since Wedeck didn't give many details of his flashforward. He's mad as hell, but after dressing down Demetri for being too dismissive of Didi, he doesn't really have a choice. He was in the bathroom during the blackout and hit his head on the toilet paper dispenser. He exited to find Agent Rafalski drowning in one of the urinals. He didn't have much of a choice: he had to give Rafalski mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. (I swear, ABC and its damn toilet humor! When is it going to end?!)

WEDECK: You speak about this, email, text, fax, or Twitter, whatever, to anyone, I'll transfer you to the ass of the cornfields so fast your head will spin!

MARK: Mouth-to-mouth?

Wedeck does get a little karmic payback later, as he and Janis analyze the figure in Detroit with Markham. The figure is looking around as if they expected the even to occur. It's is likely a male, based on the 5'8"" height and 150-pound weight. Markham considers this man very dangerous, not because he caused the blackout, but she doesn't want him to cause it twice.

At the hospital, Olivia is reunited with Charlie, and she takes Charlie by Simcoe to see if Charlie saw him in her flashforward, like Mark suggested. She didn't recognize Simcoe...but she was apparently good friends with Dylan, the autistic child who knew Olivia's name. Dylan was in Charlie's dream.

The background report on Didi Gibbons is clean. However, it would appear her credit card was used twice within a few minutes. Once in Newport Beach, then in Utah. In her vision, she was arguing something about pigeons. However, it wasn't a person: it was Pigeon, Utah. Despite Demetri's skepticism, Wedeck tells them to run it by the Salt Lake City bureau. Olivia brings Charlie to Mark and tells her about seeing Dylan in her flashforward. Olivia also tells him that Dylan's father, Lloyd Simcoe, was the man in her vision. Mark doesn't take the news well, since now she has met the man for whom she had feelings, despite Olivia's protests that she wouldn't stray. However, the conversation will have to continue later, since Didi Gibbons' credit card just bought a bus ticket in Pigeon, Utah.

All roads are blocked out of Pigeon, but the person who bought the bus ticket hasn't shown yet, according to the local sheriff. Like Demetri, she didn't see anything. However, she is more content because she hadn't drawn the conclusion that she was dead by then. Gibbons' ticket is never used. It was looking like a dead end, but an old warehouse across from the bus terminal has a clue. It's Divine Doll, an old company that went under a few months ago with the rest of the town. In Mark's vision, there was a doll next to D. Gibbons' name. Suddenly the dead end has come back to life. Mark, Demetri, and Sheriff Keegan enter to find lots of old doll parts...and an alarm system that Mark accidentally trips, which starts a baby menagerie of dolls hung with nooses. Shadows move across the office windows above them. They draw their guns on a mysterious figure, who has what appears to be explosives rigged everywhere.

""He who forsees calamities suffers them twice over.""

The figure starts a fire to blind the three, and Keegan is shot. An explosion rips through the office.

Forensics is all over the scene, and a photo is taken of a doll with one eye missing, the same photo on the bulletin board. Demetri tries to avoid freaking out that Keegan, who didn't have a vision, is now dead. He finds a chess piece, which was in the office. The mysterious figure had some heavy duty computer equipment and was hacking every major computer system in the world since after the blackout. Demetri thinks this person was doing what they were doing: investigating what was going on.

Back in L.A. Olivia comforts Lloyd, who doesn't know how to tell his son his mother is dead. Mark's bulletin board is starting to take shape. Lloyd tells his son that his mother died, following Olivia's advice to tell him he loves him. Dylan very calmly says he wants to see Olivia.

At the FBI, an amazing revelation occurs. The D. Gibbons found in Utah used his cell phone that Mark and Demetri recovered to make five calls right before the blackout...and one DURING the blackout. Sure enough, the call during the blackout was made to a cell phone near the baseball stadium in Detroit. The mysterious D. Gibbons was also awake during the blackout. The Mosaic site is nearing a million hits, and Demetri has lost all of his skepticism towards Mark's flashforward. Didi Gibbons makes a late-night cupcake run for the group. Demetri and Janis talk back and forth about her being 17 weeks pregnant (you know where this is going, don't you), and Janis decides to post to her own site, hoping the sonographer replies back to see if she had the same vision as Janis. She now knows it will be a girl. She prompts Demetri to enter his, but he refuses. He relays the story about Sheriff Keegan being dead and not having a vision, either. Janis is curious whether Demetri wants to know how he'll die, since it might be prevented, or someone might have some information to help. He decides to try. Unfortunately, he is succesful. A woman in Hong Kong calls him, who can't divulge how she got his number or this information. But an intelligence brief she saw in her flashforward says Demetri will be murdered on March 15, 2010.

At home, Mark confesses he is working as if the future will happen, but at home he doesn't want it to happen. But he does thank Olivia for telling him about Lloyd. If only he would tell her about drinking during his flashforward. He also made a fire in the fireplace to burn the friendship bracelet. He checks on Charlie, who asks him about people having bad flashforwards. She is scared, because in hers, she knows ""D. Gibbons is a bad man."""

A man named Geyer is talking to a guard, Schultz. He asks him what he saw in his flashforward. Schultz was at the breakfast table, talking to his wife. Or rather, not talking as usual. Geyer, imprisoned in Munich, saw something that would insure his release from Quale Prison.

LOS ANGELES

Mark has called Aaron over for a face-to-face. Aaron isn't happy that Mark lied to Olivia, given that he found out the hard way what lying to your wife can do. But Mark tells him about Charlie's flash and his own, and the fact she knew about D. Gibbons. Aaron makes it simple: get D. Gibbons before he gets your family. ""The world has changed. Maybe the rules need to change a little, too.""

SEATTLE, WA

On a mostly empty plane, a woman, Zoey Andata (Gabrielle Union), talks to another man who decided to take the first flight possible after the groundstop on planes was lifted. He was the CEO of the airline, so he didn't have a choice. She is trying to get back to her fiance, Demetri. Demetri, who is trying to get a trace on the woman who called him the previous night and told him he would be shot 3 times in the chest on March 15, 2010.

LOS ANGELES

There's no lack of intelligence data on the blackouts, although there might be a lack of INTELLIGENT data regarding the blackout. One example: the flashforwards were caused by a release of toxic gas from deep inside the earth caused by crustal rifting. (""The earth farted and we blacked out?"") However, a report from Germany has some promise. A prisoner named Rudolph Geyer knows why the blackouts lasted for 137 Sekunden, which is German for ""seconds."" Mark thinks it's a good lead, since the phrase 137 Sekunden was on the bulletin board in his flashforward. So was a picture of the guy. Even creepier is that the intelligence report from Germany mentions Mark by name. Geyer insists on talking to Mark and only Mark. Wedeck sends him overseas.

Demetri meets Zoey at the airport, and she is eager to tell him about her flashforward. He quickly switches topics to something slightly more mundane, and much more fun. After having her second blackout of the week, she tells him about seeing her wedding in her flashforward on the beach in Hawaii, and she says he is there. He is surprised, but he tells her he saw the same thing. Sadly, Aaron's reunion with his ex-wife, Kay, is far more somber. She thinks he is crazy to believe their daughter is still alive, and she has plenty of hostility towards him, clearly blaming him for her death. She throws him out of the bar she had been working in for the past 5 years and was working in during her flashforward. She refuses to sign the releases allowing him to exhume the daughter's body to prove the military lied about her death. However, he is not so easily stopped. He will find her.

MUNICH

The powers that rule the prison are not very happy about this visit, but Geyer is eager to talk to Mark. He saw Mark's name in his vision. However, Geyer insists he wants to return to the United States, where he hid from authorities for over 20 years. The German government is not too thrilled to allow a Nazi soldier to be released. However, Geyer won't breathe a word until he does. Janis Hawk doesn't want him to make the deal, since they could be letting a mass murderer go free for potentially nothing. Mark doesn't want to do this, but billions of lives are in the balance. Geyer's lawyer offers a compromise: a couple of pieces of information for Mark to verify, then the pardon comes and the rest of the information with it. Mark asks about the 137 seconds. Geyer talks about the Hebrew translation of the word ""Kabbalah,"" the numbers of which assigned to each letter in the Hebrew alphabet add up to 137. Mark immediately calls BS and threatens to leave. Geyer says that he was being repatriated during his flashforward into the USA. The agent checking his credentials hears that Geyer has murder to thank for it. He remembers the name: Jerome Murphy. The lawyer wants Mark to find Jerome Murphy and compare flashforwards to prove the validity of Geyer's claim.

LOS ANGELES

Felicia Wedeck (Gina Torres) talks to Olivia about her flashforward. Her college-age son is away, but a 9-year-old boy is in his room, and she is putting him to bed. Suddenly she has a young son in her flash. She wonders about the validity of it, but like Olivia not having Mark around, Felicia doesn't have Stanford around, since he has to deliver a eulogy for 8 dead FBI agents.

Demetri tracks down Jerome Murphy, who wasn't a customs agent yet. Most likely because he was too busy putting on his boogie shoes. (I am switching to boxers tomorrow.) However, Demetri shows him the picture of Geyer and Murphy confirms everything Geyer said. But Demetri has an interesting decision to make. He finds a bong in Murphy's house, and he could obviously arrest him for it, thus ending his chance of being a customs agent. Murphy begs him not to do it. But given his lack of a flashforward, does he change the future?

MUNICH

Janis is downing a few shots to moral relativism, and is not happy that Mark is actually considering the deal. Mark has had to let the occasional murderous drug dealer go to get the major distributor. But Janis can't understand about allowing an admitted Nazi killer go free. Wedeck calls to inform Mark that Murphy confirmed the flashforward, and the State Department is calling in its favors. Everybody is on shaky ground now, including Aaron, who got Mark to pull a few strings to get his daughter's body exhumed without Kay's approval.

WEDECK: The world's changed. Some of us...all of us...are making decisions based on what will happen, not what could. Makes us do things we would not ordinarily do. You'd think knowing the future would make us less concerned about it. But just the opposite has happened. The future is what all of us are living for now. It's what we're living by.

InfoTech couldn't come up with a trace on Demetri's mysterious caller. The person in question was very good at covering her tracks. Geyer has been freed, and he talks about waking up from blacking out. When he woke up in his cell, the city of Munich was on fire, and there were dead crows all over the prison yard. He hands Mark a book he had on birds of South America. He thinks Mark may need the book at some point, but he isn't sure whether or not it will be of any use. The German government will hamstring him for as long as possible to keep Geyer in prison for playing them. At least they think he's playing them.

Mark returns home, and Aaron returns to the bar. He was wrong: his daughter's remains were in that grave. This time, however, Kay was far more forgiving. At the FBI memorial, Demetri tries to take in Wedeck's words regarding having hope. Felicia sees the young boy from her flashforward: someone who is now an orphan because of what happened during that 137 seconds. At a bar following the service, Mark hears something that might have some relevance to the case. Demetri gets rid of his cold feet regarding getting married in Hawaii and agrees to marry Zoey on April 29th. As it turns out, Geyer may have given them something after all. Crows died all over the world the day of the blackout. Doing some research, a blackout occurred in Somalia in 1991 with very similar circumstances. The crow population died out that day as well. In the sky in 1991, a young boy watches a strange shape go across the sky."

People collapsing on the streets, cars crashing all over, and a bus drives into a pond. When the blackout ends, a man inside the bus, who's head remained above the waterline, helped a woman escape from the submerged bus. This same man finally makes it to the hospital, since he thought his injuries were minor at first. Ned is very friendly towards Bryce and Olivia: of course, being on a morphine drip makes everyone nice. Bryce asks about his flashforward, in which Ned is wearing leather pants and is the life of the party at a nightclub he used to be too intimidated to enter. As an aside, Ned is now black. Olivia and Bryce leave him alone, thinking it's the morphine talking about Ned's moment. Unfortunately, Olivia is not happy with Bryce's current performance; specifically the fact that he hasn't been following up with the psychiatrist he was supposed to see each week on account of his suicide attempt right before the blackout. She tells him to follow up on it if he wants his status to remain active at the hospital.

Demetri and Zoey are discussing the upcoming wedding, only Demetri isn't really up to it. Demetri claims it's work, but Zoey is already aware of the blonde woman they arrested a few days back, the ""Bin Laden meets Prada"" individual they have at the FBI office. Professionally, she wants Mrs. Bin Laden's rights protected, but personally, she'd be OK with the FBI going all Dick Cheney on her if she is involved with the blackout. (Dan Quayle must have Cheney on his Christmas card list.)

Olivia interrupts Mark's Silly Daddy Humor Theatre to tell Charlie that Nicole is returning to babysit. Nicole has been having troubles ever since the blackout, which she explains to her sponsor, Aaron. He tries to reassure her that everybody saw what they saw in their flashforward for a reason. Mark wants to head to Somalia to follow up on the information he got last week in Germany. Wedeck doesn't believe the trip to Germany was as successful as Mark claims, and he is hesitant to continue sending Mark around the world on the taxpayer's dime. Agent Al Gough (Lee Thompson Young) suggests getting satellite images from the time of the alleged Somalia blackout in 1991, if there is one. Wedeck isn't willing to go to bat for them with the CIA on such flimsy evidence, so Mark suggests a hacker that Gough picked up a few years back to have him hack into the computers at Langley.

Demetri is in the middle of interrogating Alda Hertzog, AKA Mrs. Bin Laden, who continues to stall and demands to see a lawyer. Of course, she can call the embassy of her country, depending on which of the 2 dozen passports she possesses is the right one. Since her associates are dead, she gives them ""Customer Choice Restaurant Group,"" which doesn't really lead anywhere.

DEMETRI: You're running out of time in which this remains a civil conversation.

HERTZOG: I thought it was you who was running out of time. You really should get out there before it's too late.

Demetri's case of a dirty bomb has more sway with Wedeck than a ""bunch of dead poultry."" Mark and Demetri are on their way to Indio, CA to chase after the bomb-makers. The restaurant there is the only part of the Customer Choice Restaurant Group, and obtaining a list of employees from them seems like a dead-end to Mark. That is, until the short order cook escapes at the mention of the FBI. They chase him into a trailer park and are able to capture him after a brief chase. However, a steel box with ""yellow cake"" taped on the outside is just a supply of nickelbags of pot. The man's flashforward indicates he becomes successful dealing weed, and he antagonizes Demetri enough where Demetri assaults him while the man is still handcuffed. Demetri turns on Mark for his flashforward and slugs him. Demetri finally reveals to Mark that he knows he'll be murdered on March 15th; hence losing it in front of the loser with the pot.

Olivia is met in the hospital by Lloyd Simcoe, who asks her advice on how to deal with Dylan when he has his autistic episodes, one of which led to a flying food tray and spilled coffee earlier that morning. Olivia is clearly uncomfortable with Lloyd talking to her, and he can't understand why. However, Lloyd is having too many problems trying to cope with both Dylan and the death of his wife. Olivia finally unclenches and recommends that he spend a few nights at home rather than trying to sleep in the chair next to Dylan at the hospital.

Demetri tells Mark everything after their suspect is taken away. Demetri is freaking out because he knows he is dead in 5 months. Mark all but begs him to help with his flashforward because he might be able to help Demetri, himself, and everyone else find out what happened. Demetri agrees, hoping that Mark's information might lead somewhere.

At the hospital, Bryce finally gets the CT scan results on Ned, who had a respectably-sized hematoma in his brain, and the buildup of blood would have killed him had he ignored it longer. While there, Lloyd Simcoe reveals his flashforward: the new ""how's the weather"" of society. Lloyd gets a call from someone, and he hears a voice saying ""Hi, honey."" He turns toward the voice, but his flashforward ends before he can see who the woman (Olivia) is. Olivia, who meets up with Bryce, is upset that Bryce keeps bringing up everyone's flashforwards, since she doesn't want any medical advice to hinge on the information in them. Ned seems to appreciate what happened in his, since he was no longer nervous or worried. The fact that he'll be ""this invincible black guy, like Shaft or Bryant Gumbel"", has already changed him. Unfortunately, Bryce discovers some online information regarding Ned's surgery and must stop it before the surgery kills him.

Ned has Addison's Disease: which means Ned produces melanin compounds instead of adrenaline compounds, which is the reason for his calm nature and his darker skin color in the flashforward. Olivia refuses to listen to Bryce about endangering Ned by performing surgery on him without adrenaline present in Ned's body to handle the shock. Olivia is ready to toss him out of the hospital, but he won't back down, saying her flashforward is clouding her judgment. She proceeds with the surgery anyway. Sure enough, Ned crashes. Unable to shock him back, she pushes for 100 cc's of hydrocortisone, over everyone's protests. She accepts Ned has Addison's disease, and they put it through. It works.

Mark goes back to interview Hertzog, but she is not forthcoming on answers. However, she does acknowledge she ""communes"" with some very dangerous people, ones who are willing to strap on a vest and sacrifice themselves to get what they want. She does not think Mark is one of those people. He may know the questions to ask, but he doesn't have what it takes to get what he wants. She thinks Mark is like the little boy in a Sufi fable who will tell his father where the light of a candle comes from, if his father can tell him where the light goes when the candle is blown out. Mark says nothing, but he goes to Gough, asking him to use ""Mr. Cheeto Dust"" hack into Langley to get the images of Somalia.

Ned thanks Bryce for helping him, but Bryce credits the successful surgery to Ned's flashfoward, which helped identify Addison's Disease. Olivia apologizes to Bryce and admits she didn't believe Ned's flashforward, because she didn't want to believe her own. Worse, Dylan Simcoe, who Olivia transferred to Physical Therapy, got transferred back to her.

Nicole returns to the Benford house. She visited a priest earlier, eager to do some volunteer work since her flashforward indicated someone saved her life. Nicole is still nervous, and she tells Mark about her flashforward. Someone was drowning her, and she felt like she deserved it. She saw the face of the person who tried to drown her. Mark assures her that they'll get her some help to locate the person who tried to drown her.

At the hospital, Olivia watches Lloyd play with Dylan. She leaves before he discovers her. He gets a call from someone named ""Simon,"" who Lloyd would rather not talk to. Lloyd really doesn't have a choice but to talk to Simon, who indicates the two of them are ""responsible for the single greatest disaster in human history."""

Demetri is called into a meeting room in a sub-basement of the US Senate. Even though he already told them in his affadavit that he did not see a thing in his flashforward, they don't believe him. While Mark fiddles with his 7 Years Sober coin, we see the polygraph interviews by Mark and Vreede regarding their flashforwards. Vreede was exiting the FBI office in L.A. around 10 PM through a secure door, and he did not see anybody in his. Mark's story remains the same about being in his office and seeing two men. Once completed, Mark calls Aaron, who is fixing a few things at his house. Mark is feeling the pressure of having to be right about this investigation since he started it, and Aaron suggests attending an AA meeting while in Washington. Wedeck, however, is under more pressure, as Demetri and Vreede help him gather evidence to keep the Mosaic Collective funded. Wedeck had spent some time in DC and it didn't appear to be pleasant. Wedeck flags down an old friend, Dave (Peter Coyote), for some hoops and insider information. Dave advises him to tread lightly, something Wedeck wasn't very good at in the past. With a person named Clemente chairing the funding hearings, things could go bad, in spite of Dave's assurances to the contrary. However, Dave is in the business of assuring people no matter what. He's the President of the United States, and Wedeck has 5th-row seating for one of his press conferences.

As Janis Hawk and Gough pour over satellite pictures of Somalia from the CIA from the crow-death incident of 1991, the President tells the media that they are coordinating their efforts to properly fund the correct agencies that have the best shot at providing leads to the cause of the blackout. He also, like other world leaders, has declined to reveal his own flashforward, although we see it involves a Secret Service agent waking him to tell him something has happened.

Olivia talks with Aaron, having overheard part of his conversation with Mark. The last time they went through problems that were alcohol-related, Mark was also testifying in meetings, just after he got promoted. Between the familiarity of the current situation and her flashforward, she is concerned to say the least. Aaron tells her to just keep moving and keep supporting Mark as best as she can.

Following the press conference, Wedeck meets with the President in the Oval Office. Wedeck worked waist-deep in Beltway politics a few years back and apparently ticked off the wrong people, forcing the President to send him west. It was now time for the President to bring him back into the fold, since the present situation demanded level-headed people. Wedeck is offered a cabinet position as Director of Homeland Security.

The hearings are the epitome of the famous saying ""If the opposite of pro is con, does that mean the opposite of progress is Congress?"" The CDC has ruled out anyone tampering with the water supply, outerworld alien influence is a theory being investigated, and the CIA thinks there's a plot to destroy America since China had very few per capita fatalities. The fact everybody was asleep at 2 in the morning there had nothing to do with it. Wedeck gets a not-so-subtle introduction by Senator Clemente (Barbara Williams), and she goes no-holds-barred during a break, accusing Wedeck of ruining her shot at the presidency. However, as much as she wants to shoot down what Wedeck is doing before he even gets to testify, she saw herself as President in her flashforward. Wedeck explains that his office is collecting data on the flashforwards of anybody who calls in, and the data is analyzed. Clemente isn't hearing it, but Wedeck is ready to pull out several of his ""smoking guns"" that the Mosaic and Mark have discovered. To hold off the other senators on the committee, Clemente orders Mark to take the stand for the following day.

Janis wakes up the next day after her successful date with Maya, both of whom discuss their flashforwards on a date at her restaurant. Actually, both of them lie, since Maya had a wedding ring on, and Janis didn't want to tell her she was 6 months pregnant at the time. She makes it to the office where they're going over the satellite pictures. They find the picture they were looking for, a satellite image of what looks like an asphalt road where there shouldn't be one and a tower in the middle of nowhere.

In D.C., Mark Benford reported the presence of the man in Detroit and talked about the deaths of crows the day of the blackout. Senator Noland (Glynn Turman) wants to know why the L.A. office was running their own investigations without approval from D.C. Mark described how he seemed to be the point man in the investigation in his flashforward, with names, places, and events on a giant board in his office.

SENATOR NOLAND: So, you're investigating this because you had a vision of you investigating this.

Clemente doesn't believe him until Mark describes masked gunmen trying to kill him. But there is a problem. Clemente pulls out Mark's polygraph interview, where Mark only describes roughly 30 seconds worth of visions where most other people have vivid recall of the entire 137 seconds. Mark is naturally reluctant to reveal he was drinking in his flashforward, but Clemente's gloves are off and accuses the L.A. office of fraud. Wedeck has had enough and walks out. Clemente mentioning the ex-Nazi who was repatriated certainly didn't help, either. Demetri has to admit to an outsider, what they have found thus far would look a little crazy. This would be a good time to find some new evidence, which Janis and Gough are more than happy to call in. Wajid, Somalia is where the ""towers"" were built, roughly 100 feet tall, and took five months to complete from scratch right before the crows ""did their face plant.""

Wedeck calls Janis on the side and asks her for a favor. But Janis has problems of her own. Maya found Janis' flashforward information on Mosaic about her pregnancy. The situation is, to say the least, awkward. Janis goes away. But she had done the favor for Wedeck: she found Renee Garrigos (Mieko Hillman) in D.C. for him...and the President's son. As in the son who was paid $250K by the soon-to-be-President, and delivered by Wedeck, to pretend he doesn't know him. Clearly Clemente knew, which explains her ripping anybody working for Wedeck for no good reason.

PRESIDENT: You know why I liked having you around so much, Stan? You weren't just comfortable in the mud. You enjoyed being there.

The deal is simple: the President stops Clemente from cutting off Wedeck's funding, and the Mosaic Website conveniently forgets Renee Garrigos posted on it. Wedeck leaves, but the President didn't necessarily make the deal. Instead, he makes a phone call. Demetri is hitting the bottle because he thinks he only has five months to live and wants to blow off some steam...by singing Sister Christian with Vreede at a karaoke bar. Amazingly, not even this drives Mark to drink. However, Wedeck ripping him for his poor performance in front of Clemente forces Mark to admit he was hammered in the middle of his flashforward. Wedeck had pulled out a few too many miracles for Mark and now realizes the information Mark gave him may have been compromised by alcohol. But Wedeck is obviously a much better boss than he leads on, as he doesn't tell Demetri or Vreede, even buying them some rounds and announcing they got their funding. To make matters worse, someone unknown relays this information to Olivia, but she is unable to figure out who text'ed her that Mark was drinking during his flashforward.

As they go to the garage, President Segovia brokered his deal for Wedeck by nominating Clemente to replace Vice-President Pratt, who was killed in the blackout. Wedeck isn't happy, since Clemente's flashforward could come true, but this is ""can't get something for nothing"" D.C. and he plays it off. This brings matters back to the beginning, but there's more. Janis, while on the phone with Mark, hears the crash but is assaulted by two men in Los Angeles. She is able to kill both with her gun, but she is shot in the process. Mark, Demetri, Wedeck, and Vreede barely make it out of the car before it explodes and come out guns blazing. They take out two of the hired killers, but the other two escape. As Janis lies bleeding in the street, her vision comes back to her. She will have a girl."

A stranger on a train (Dominic Monaghan) tries that line with a gorgeous blonde (Ashley Jones), who doesn't buy it. However, she looks up his information on her smartphone and is suddenly impressed by his credentials. He believes the answer lies in Quantum Mechanics. To illustrate, he talks about Schrodinger's Cat, where until you know whether or not the cat has eaten the poisoned sardine you placed in the box with her, the cat could be considered both alive and dead. This is a fitting metaphor for Olivia as she works to keep Janis Hawk alive from her gunshot wound. Thankfully, she is successful and Janis is alive.

Everybody returns from D.C. and go straight to the hospital to find out Janis' condition. Unfortunately, they have to contemplate the possibility that they could get attacked again. Wedeck sends all of them home, but Demetri refuses to let the 2 dozen agents already working on the case figure out why they were attacked. Mark tells Olivia about being attacked in D.C. and assumes the attacks there and against Janis are related. Olivia is a bit freaked out and confesses to Mark that she is scared of the blackouts. She knows about Lloyd, who is trying to convince Dylan to move to a different house after he leaves the hospital, but he doesn't want to move away, even if his mom is gone. Mark takes Charlie out trick-or-treating with Aaron, or should I say, Obi-Wan. As they go down the street, a kangaroo hops by, not too unlike one seen in the pilot episode.

Demetri goes to the morgue to check on the two stiffs who shot Janis. The lack of histories on the two and lasik surgery would indicate professional hitters. He finds a blue handstamp on one of them. The same blue hand that was on Mark's bulletin board next to Baltimore. There is a bar on Baltimore Street that uses blue handstamps, so Demetri puts aside his own denial about flashforwards to work on the case with Gough.

At the hospital, Wedeck refuses to leave Janis' side. She hates the standard hospital gown, but he likes them because he equates it with his son being born. Janis' blood pressure begins to drop, and Olivia brings her back to the O.R.

On the train, ""I know what caused the flashforwards"" won't get a woman in bed but the story of Schroedinger's Cat will. (Just ask Penny on ""The Big Bang Theory."") She talks about being at a New Year's style party on April 29th in her flashforward, and he had a vision that he was murdering someone by snapping his neck. Needless to say, she shouldn't have asked him what he saw.

At the hospital, an upset Dylan sneaks out of the hospital and ends up on a bus. He is having an autistic episode, and demands to be taken to 25696 Sawyer Court, which is house, too. A scary-looking customer on the bus intimidates the driver into taking Dylan there. His house, being Mark and Olivia's house, where he walks in right past Nicole. Upstairs, Olivia is doing a risky procedure on Janis to keep her alive and keep her uterus intact, over the objections of another doctor, who thinks she wouldn't be doing that if she didn't know Janis personally. Demetri thinks Janis will survive, since she drank him under the table at Quantico. On the good side, the clue on Mark's board appears to be panning out. There is a blue hand on Baltimore Street. There are several, which point Demetri and Gough in the direction of the club.

Mark has a busy night. He discovers three men in dark clothing and masks walking down the street. The same kinds of masks the assassins in his vision wore. He gives chase through a cemetery, but it turns out they were just kids doing some Halloween pranks. He is called home by Nicole to have him talk to Dylan. Dylan is still in his autistic episode and we see part of his vision, where he is talking to Charlie in the vision and taking a cookie out of the rooster cookie jar, just like he did when he walked in on Nicole. He also read the address ""To our friends at 25696 Sawyer Court, Los Angeles,"" just like he read it to the bus driver earlier. Lloyd Simcoe shows up and starts to freak out a bit when he sees the home he saw in his vision. He also connects Mark to Olivia Benford. He tries to play it off...until Olivia walks in.

Aaron and Nicole pull Charlie out of the soon-to-be line of fire. Mark is ready to fly off the handle, and he tells Lloyd to leave and not come back. But at least everybody lived to see another day. The three corpses Demetri and Gough found with hands painted blue can't say the same thing. Sure enough, whatever is happening has started. The assassins who tried to kill Janis were busy at that house. There is also a Scottish passport on one of them with the name Rutheford, the same case Gough was working on in his flashforward.

Mark is still upset because what happened doesn't explain how Dylan found their house. He reads her the riot act and accuses her of not being honest about what she told him concerning Lloyd. She turns it around and asks him if he's being honest. He admits drinking in his flashforward.

MARK: Don't condemn me for something I haven't done yet.

OLIVIA: Do you even care what you just said?

Olivia is understandably livid because he goes off on her imaginary relationship but his drinking is real. It's clear they don't trust each other anymore. Mark wonders if wanting to ""live in the moment,"" like they said in the hospital, should still happen, but Olivia doesn't think that's possible anymore.

Lloyd returns Dylan to the hospital, who seems to be better now. Unfortunately, Lloyd isn't. Simon, the stranger on the train and who called him previously, meets him in his car. He, and the entire group he works for, are upset that Lloyd disappeared, but Lloyd can't handle that the ""experiment"" has already killed 20 million people."

Someone out there knows something about her flashforward: the fact she didn't have one. As she returns to her car, there is a flyer with a blue hand on it with the Website www.alreadyghosts.com. Apparently, many people have come to the same conclusion as Demetri: they are dead before April 29th. Still, it doesn't stop Demetri from agreeing to choosing wedding invitations with Zoey. He's very amenable to it because he doesn't want her to see him looking at the AlreadyGhosts Website.

Mark and Olivia are practically tangoing around the incident in the house with Lloyd and Dylan. She has to work late and tries to explain why, but he says he trusts her. Mark is certainly finding a sympathetic ear from Demetri, who is having the same problems with Zoey for obviously different reasons. The good news is, there are always three corpses to take your mind off of your real problems. All the three found at the house died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, leaving Mark, Demetri, and Gough to wonder who laid out the bodies and covered them with sheets. One of them was Rutherford, the man Gough was investigating in his flashforward.

Aaron heads to work to find a Corporal Mike Willingham waiting for him. He has something to give Aaron: a pocket knife. The same pocket knife Aaron gave Tracy four years ago...and gave back to her in his flashforward. Now he has some optimism regarding seeing Tracy again. He hugs Mike for giving him hope.

Ian Rutherford was reported missing off a cargo ship and the British Embassy was notified of his suicide. This prompted Fiona Banks (Alex Kingston) of MI-6 to join the investigation. The same Fiona Banks who worked on the Rutherford case with Gough in his flashforward. Demetri confirms that the three people went on the Mosaic Website and reported not having a flashforward. There is now a growing movement of the ""blue hands"" to meet, talk about their experiences, or even call it quits. A ""book club with bullets"" that Wedeck is none too happy about since they were involved in the shooting of Janis. One is about to be hosted by Dr. Maurice Raynaud tonight. They have to go downtown and ""check the time.""

Banks had a bit more of an emotional reaction to her flashforward than Gough. After the bird hitting the window scared both of them, Gough went to take a call, and Banks saw the injured bird on the ledge. She wanted to help it, even put it out of its suffering, but she couldn't get to the bird. However, it doesn't compare to Gough's phone call to his lawyer, where he tearfully breaks down that ""he killed her"". Who he killed, we don't know, and Gough doesn't reveal any of this to Banks.

Demetri is preparing to head out to the club when Zoey comes home in full boil, because he didn't show for choosing the invitations. He tries to blame it on work, but she is upset because he has been distant since the blackout, always claiming work is the problem, and he shuts his computer down when she walks by. She demands to know what's going on, and he looks ready to reveal his lack of a flashforward. But he chooses to walk out of the apartment instead.

Nicole is trying to atone for the thing she hasn't done yet that gets her killed, by volunteering at Olivia's hospital. The very busy Olivia leaves her in Bryce's hands, and her timing is excellent, as is her skills in the Japanese language to calm down a patient. Bryce takes advantage of this to ask about a drawing he made, related to his flashforward, which she does complete. The woman in Bryce's drawing was standing in front of a Kanji, a Japanese letter that means ""believe"".

Mark, Demetri, and Gough arrive at the party, and must think it's a Halloween party, given that they're dressed up like the revival of Revenge of the Nerds. They get hand-stamped...with blue hands, natch...and are invited to a game of Russian Roulette. Gough decides to play, thinking he knows he'll be alive in six months. Fortunately he survives and gets the lone bullet in the gun for the invitation. They look for Raynaud, but Raynaud is a different person each time. Raynaud will find them; they don't find him. Mark picks up a book of matches that was on his bulletin board, and they explore the club. The club looks like a rave club designed by Tyler Durden. There are people already dead, pretending to be dead, or attempting to make themselves that way. Demetri sees that they don't care if these people go now or six months from now. At the sound of an alarm bell, everybody walks to a door chanting ""Raynaud."" Raynaud appears with his blue hands, which represent a portal from one place to another. A surrender to the inevitable. Raynaud gets ready to blow his brains out, and Mark places him under arrest.

Aaron is heading home, and Mike Willingham shows up again. He saw how optimistic Aaron was earlier, and he felt the need to set the record straight. He was there when Tracy was killed by a group named ""Jericho"" when they blew up their HumVee while chasing after a terrorist cell. Later, Mike wants to apologize for telling the truth, but Aaron thanks him for giving him some peace. He rewards the unemployed Mike with a job.

Dr. Raynaud is really Jeff Slingerland, a high school history teacher who knew about the ""blue hands"" phenomenon from the actual Dr. Raynaud's history of almost 130 years ago. They demand answers, but Slingerland goes Nietchze on them and tells them the Mosaic Website is how these people meet him. Demetri has had enough and demands Slingerland identify the man who shot Janis. But Slingerland doesn't care because none of this matters anyway. This really fazes Gough, who suggests to Fiona Banks that she tape the window so the bird sees it and doesn't crash into it. But she figures that the bird will crash into some other window, thus the bird's fate doesn't change. Given that he has apparently committed murder, the thought of his fate not changing doesn't sit well with him. Demetri is not happy about it, obviously, and not even Mark's advice of fighting it, is of any value. Sure enough, Mark is trying not to break down at home as he looks over Olivia and Charlie.

Demetri goes home and tells Zoey the truth about his lack of a flashforward. However, she insists seeing him in her vision. There are two conflicting visions, and she chooses to believe the one that is more hopeful and suggests he do the same.

Back at the office, Gough leaves a letter for Demetri and walks away, asking Demetri to give that to the right person. Demetri reads the letter...which was a suicide note. The person Gough supposedly ""kills"" was simply an accident for which he blames himself. The person is Celia, the woman at the beginning of the episode with the two kids. Everybody races to the roof to stop Gough, but he wants to change things to prove it can be done. He dives off the building.

The letter Demetri read was for Celia, who didn't have a flashforward. But Gough thought that she would now live, because he was not responsible for her death. He considered his suicide a gift to her so that she might live and take care of her boys. It hits everybody hard. Mark goes home to Olivia. Aaron comes home and ... finds Tracy, his daughter."

Al Gough's suicide has much further-reaching implications that anybody would have realized. The letter that was delivered to Celia, the woman he blamed himself for killing in his flashforward, is now a media sensation. Suddenly, people aren't taking their predictions lying down. Mark and Olivia get away for a romantic weekend, Demetri is investigating the bulletin board instead of throwing it all away, and Lloyd Simcoe has decided to send a file off to several emails to take responsibility for what happened. As the FBI welcomes back Janis, they also have to deny her resignation. She is confused about whether to accept fate as it comes, or should she take being shot as a sign that some things aren't meant to be.

WEDECK: If Al's death proved anything, it's that our choices still matter. Now, more than ever.

Lloyd's email doesn't get very far. Simon goes so far as to infringe on Lloyd's time with Dylan to try and straighten him out, but Lloyd still feels the need to go public with the experiment, since it killed 20 million people. Mark and Olivia's weekend together gets interrupted by Demetri, who relays information to Mark about a murder in Barstow. The execution-style murder was committed by one of the men who was in Mark's flashfoward, if the 3-star tattoo is any indication. Olivia doesn't like it, naturally. But Mark has to go back to work. Perhaps it's just as well. Mark got Olivia a gift, which she opens back at the hospital. It is a sexy black lingerie set. The same lingerie she was wearing in her flashforward when she saw Lloyd on the couch.

According to the reports, the man killed was an engineer from El Segundo. It was assumed to be a robbery, as the witness who shot the footage saw the engineer hand something over to the killer before being shot. Mark is determined to put this person away to prove that Al was right and the future can be changed.

Aaron is having a difficult time with Tracy. She is having nightmares about being attacked, and her post-traumatic stress is something she can't get past since she refuses to talk about what happened to her. But Aaron is running out of patience. Everybody else still think she's dead, and she had the same flashforward as him: they were both under fire in Afghanistan.

Olivia continues to be tense around Lloyd and Dylan for obvious reasons...at least to her. Bryce is wondering what is going on, but Simon, posing as a ""friend of the family"" railroads Olivia and Bryce into saying that Dylan can go home soon. Once alone, Simon tells Lloyd he'll do whatever it takes to block him from going public, or they can settle their issue in a ""civilized"" manner: a poker game. Dice, chess, Simon brags that the gods decided the lives of mortals by fate. Lloyd can't believe he thinks they're gods.

SIMON: 20 million deaths on our shoulders. That's what you said. If that doesn't qualify us for Godhood, tell me what does?

Ingrid Alvarez, the woman who filmed the murder on her mobile phone, just missed being a victim herself. Her roommate was killed, and Mark and Demetri think it's a matter of the wrong person, as does the Barstow Police. They bring Alvarez to headquarters. The item the engineer gave him was a briefcase, and she had a hazy description of the two men. It also sounded like the men were talking about ""Q.E.D."" Nobody at the FBI knew what she meant, but Simon used the phrase when talking about winning every hand of poker against Lloyd because it was fate. Or so some are led to believe.

SIMON: The future's already happened. I've already won. Fighting it is futile.

Certainly Nicole is hoping you can fight the future. She keeps thinking about her flashforward. But she reassures Olivia that things can change. It's all over the news.

Tracy finally opens up about being attacked. Jericho, it seems, is a private military contractor, and they were the ones to attack her Humvee. Because they attacked her, she doesn't think she can trust the military. She was working recon in a village where Jericho was. Jericho wiped out an entire village, and Tracy witnessed all of it. She told her superior officer about it, and she ended up being attacked with Mike. She lost her leg, but she survived it. Aaron relays this information to Mark, and he asks Mark for help. Tracy hid for two years because Jericho was...and still is...after her. Mark talks about this with Olivia, although he withholds the specifics. Both of them realize they can change things. For example, Olivia throws out the lingerie. Tracy is upset with Aaron, but he insists that they both saw the same flashforward, including giving Khamir, the man who kept Tracy alive after she was attacked, an envelope. Aaron didn't know what was in it, but Tracy left him so Jericho wouldn't attack him. Aaron insists on trusting what he saw.

Mark decides to make Ingrid bait in trapping the two killers that attacked the engineer, who may have been selling corporate secrets. Wedeck isn't comfortable, but since they are convinced there is a mole in the Bureau somewhere, pretending to release Ingrid tonight will get them to make their move. Ingrid volunteers to become the bait. Janis stays with her in the store while Mark and Demetri keep watch outside. Ingrid's flashforward showed her as a blonde instead of a brunette and working at the Bronx Zoo. She believed it so much, she put her pet store up for sale. The lack of buyers dissuaded her, as did Gough's suicide. A loud noise and loss of lights made matters even worse. Mark and Demetri come in, guns pointed. Mark's flashes are getting too much for him. The tension builds. Mark sees a man and shoots him dead in the shop. They were right, but it was only one of the two men. Ingrid will have to go into witness protection.

Simon and Lloyd's game is near it's end. Lloyd is losing badly, and Simon is beyond confident. So much so, he puts his large pile of chips against Lloyd's non-existent one, winner takes all. Simon thinks he has all of Lloyd's ""tells"" down, but apparently not. In spite of Simon getting four Kings, Lloyd beats him with a straight flush. Lloyd is ready to tell, as he loves to do magic for Dylan. He decides to let Simon write the first draft of the admission statement.

Demetri is very upset with Mark, whom he suspects for intentional killing of the man with the tattoo in order to change his vision, but he wonders just how accurate Mark's vision is. However he supports Mark's version during the debriefing, for which Mark thanks him. Mark is shaking when he gets home, but now he knows he and Olivia have a second chance. However, there is more to it than that. There are several men with the same three-star tattoo, one of whom delivers a briefcase with six rings to a mysterious man, who lodges a complaint about a missing ring... by shooting the delivery person. That same ring can be found on Suspect Zero at the baseball game in Detroit."

She was even harder on him during a surgical procedure when he was a little slow in providing information for her to do her job. We now know the reason why he attempted it. Four weeks before the blackout, Bryce was getting an update on his cancer diagnosis. He had been in treatment, but nothing worked. Given news like that, smashing the convertible of some pretentious jerk in the parking garage seems trivial by comparison. However, two weeks before the blackout, we see the woman in his flashforward in Tokyo, trying to psyche herself. Keiko Arahida is a Tokyo engineer who is trying to get a job at a robotics company. Apparently, liking salsa dancing and Jimi Hendrix helped seal the deal. Unfortunately, having a mother who tries to jumpstart your love life is clearly universal, as Keiko's mom throws her a party and invites a few guys over for Keiko to consider.

On the day of the blackout, Bryce tells someone about his diagnosis: his shrink, Dr. Fleming. Nobody at work knows, and he figures his family went though enough watching his father have lung cancer take him slowly and painfully over three years. The psychiatrist tries to convince him that he doesn't really know what the future holds, but clearly the walk onto the pier with a .38 would indicate he didn't listen to her. We see his flashforward. He sits in a Tokyo restaurant ordering food, and meets Keiko. Apparently, he had been waiting for her. Both are clearly smitten with each other, much like the ultimate first date. He sees a tattoo on her wrist: the Japanese symbol for ""believe."" He wakes up with a whole new perspective, and across the Pacific, Keiko awakens in her bathroom from the blackout, more than pleased about her side of the same flashforward.

Bryce is definitely determined, almost borderline obsessed, to meet with this woman. His apartment consists of nothing but paintings of things he saw in his flashforward, like the symbol on her t-shirt and drawings he made of her, along with a computer and Japanese language software. But Nicole is still impressed that Bryce is learning Japanese merely for the purpose of meeting that woman. In Tokyo, Keiko is a little low-key at her desk, although that must be a nice company she works for, as they don't block her access to watching a Bob Dylan concert performance. She is brought before the higher-ups... to serve them tea. Apparently, she doubles as a secretary from the 1950's. That ticks her off enough to go down to a tattoo parlor for a little bit of rebellion.

Mark's investigation into Jericho for Aaron only reveals a few things. They are based out of Santa Monica, they are a Blackwater-style private security contractor, and they have enough friends in D.C. where Mark would need some serious authorization just to park in their lot. Aaron is concerned because Tracy is hitting the bottle and won't talk very much out of fear. Mark will try to find out more, but he also has to find out why someone sent Olivia that text message that he was drinking during his flashforward. She didn't deem it important to tell him about the text message because he already admitted to the drinking. Mark is curious to know who sent it. The only two people who knew about his drinking in the flashforward are Aaron and Wedeck. He asks Aaron about it, who is already having difficulty dealing with Tracy hitting the bottle in his own house. Aaron does not take the implication well and tells Mark to find a new sponsor.

At the hospital, Bryce tries to keep quiet, but his health is starting to deteriorate. Olivia refuses to let him work because he is pale and almost passed out. She discovers the central line he had put in for his chemotherapy. He admits to having renal cell carcinoma, stage 4. He had a kidney removed before he went to work at the hospital. He didn't want to put his family or anybody else through it, hence the suicide attempt. But the thought of meeting Keiko has kept him going. He has rough days right after chemo, but he bounces back. Olivia decides to play friend instead of boss and gets him an appointment with a specialist in Houston working on an experimental drug. Bryce is uncertain because he knows he has something to live for in a few months, but she points out that he may still be alive in his flashforward because he did take this experimental drug. She practically sends him to Houston, but he goes to Tokyo instead.

Agent Levy, an NSA computer analyst, reports to the team that Suspect Zero's ring had the Greek letter Alpha on it. However, all of the cameras on him in Detroit wouldn't produce a decent shot of his face. Wedeck can smell the bullshit from her a mile away, and she indicates that one of the agents in his group was red-flagged by Homeland Security: Demetri. They intercepted a call he received where the caller did everything to hide their trail. More accurately...her trail. It was the woman who called Demetri to tell him he would be murdered on March 15th, that set off the alarm bells in the NSA. Demetri wants a copy of that message. Mark gets the message from the NSA, and he gets the same treatment from Wedeck that he got from Aaron when asking about the text message to Olivia.

In Tokyo, Bryce finds the restaurant and is able to find out that Keiko frequents the place. However, she'll have to deal with her mother being upset that she quit her job. Her mother goes ballistic that Keiko won't do any of the things they want, like marry the stuffy businessman they found for her. She gets thrown out of the house. But she is determined to find the person she saw in her flashforward: Bryce.

The FBI team analyzes the message and discovers the call came from Hong Kong. Wedeck isn't sending them because there's enough flak going on with the CIA thinking China is to blame for all of this in the first place. Of course, Mark won't let that stop him. He and Demetri are heading to Hong Kong.

Back home, Aaron continues to watch Tracy drink herself into a stupor. This makes Mark's arrival even worse. Mark tries to apologize, but Aaron is falling apart because of Tracy's behavior. He blames himself for what Tracy is doing because she always wanted to be just like him. Right now, Mark can't have him for a sponsor, but Aaron really needs a friend and Mark offers himself.

Bryce makes it to Keiko's house. (""Mom! There's a white guy at the door!""). But Keiko's mother is none too trusting of him, especially given that Bryce shows her a drawing of Keiko. She denies even knowing Keiko and shuts the door in his face. Bryce is beside himself, but Nicole tells him on the phone to be patient. He thinks that maybe it was about a fantasy rather than an actual future. He returns to L.A., not realizing that Keiko was on the same flight the whole time. Watching Bob Dylan at her workplace inspired her to come to L.A. with a guitar. It would seem the flashforward they shared didn't take place in a restaurant in Tokyo. It took place in Los Angeles."

Prominently featured in her collage is Demetri, with the code ""A561984"" underneath. Upon deplaning, the agents ignore Wedeck's repeated calls, but Marshall Vogel from the FBI approaches them in the terminal and suggests they answer the phone, since the FBI clearly can track their movements. He also cautions them that they're in a country the U.S. suspects of the blackout. They decide to stay, over Vogel's and Wedeck's protests. As it happens, Mark is protecting Demetri by taking the blame for the trip, even telling Demetri it was finally approved. Mark and Demetri trace the mystery woman's phone call signal to a restaurant area, where they find a closed restaurant that serves Persian food.

In Palo Alto, the National Linear Accelerator Project conducts a press conference, where Lloyd and Simon are ready to discuss what happened on October 6th. Simon is none too happy about it, but a deal is a deal. Proton-driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration is the concept that Lloyd introduces to the world. The idea was to re-create the energy levels present at the Big Bang on a controlled scale. A reporter demands to know if the NLAP will take responsibility for the deaths and devastation that took place on October 6th, but Simon chimes in and tries to play off the responsibility of the NLAP. While the world - including Mark, Demetri, Olivia, Wedeck,and Aaron - watches the press conference, Gordon Myhill, the project leader, tries to end the press conference, but Lloyd tries to apologize and tries to assure the crowd that there will be no more blackouts, noting his own grief over his wife's death. That doesn't satisfy one woman in the crowd, who grabs a security guard's gun and tries to shoot Lloyd. After they are rescued off the podium Simon goes ballistic at Lloyd for trying to take responsibility when neither can prove the NLAP was or was not at fault.

Wedeck is even more upset now than when he smashed the TV in his office following Mark's stunt. He wants Lloyd and Simon in the office immediately; both men have disappeared following the press conference, but Janis recognizes Lloyd's name and realizes that his son Dylan was in Olivia's hospital. Wedeck orders her to the hospital, to try and make unofficial contact with Lloyd. However, Wedeck doesn't have to worry about finding Simon, who shows up at the FBI office in Los Angeles. Simon wants to look at the Mosaic data the FBI has collected, arguing that D.C. won't fund the project anymore now that someone has stepped forward and taken the blame for the blackout. Wedeck decides to give him a little information to test him out. Simon is a bit offended by the offer, but he bites. Upon being shown the photos of the towers the satellites found in Somalia, Simon explains that they are specialized pulse lasers for a plasma afterburner, which he designed. He marvels at what he believes are computer-simulated images, but is bewildered when told that the towers are real structures, since he insists the design is still in the theoretical planning stages. Even more perplexing, he designed the laser in 1992, but the photos are from 1991. Since Simon points out that most scientists strive to be forever famous, he is intrigued and irritated that the person who actually designed the laser has to be an ultra-recluse with no interest in publicity for his work. Simon is shown the sketch of D. Gibbons and told he was awake during the blackout. Suddenly Simon is very cooperative, since this D. Gibbons already did what Simon and Lloyd were attempting... and succeeded.

Zoey attends the funeral of a co-worker's wife. Earlier, she tried to convince Demetri's parents, who have refused to meet her or attend the wedding, to change their minds since she saw them in her flashforward. However, a lily on the casket of her co-worker makes her realize something. She was wearing white because white is worn at a Korean funeral. She was carrying a lily in her flashforward as well. She realizes that the although the Nohs had refused to come to the wedding, they would never miss their son's funeral, and that Demetri was right all along: she was not getting married in her flashforward but rather mourning his death. She visits Demetri's mother, who confirms what she saw, though Mrs. Noh didn't want to believe it was actually happening; she now embraces the planned wedding, having foreseen Zoe's grief. But Zoey thinks they might be able to change the future.

At the hospital, Janis' stakeout is making Bryce nervous, but she expresses her continued desire to have a baby. If she was four months pregnant in her flashforward, she has about a month or so to get busy. As expected, Lloyd comes to the hospital, and Janis offers the FBI's protection if he cooperates. He isn't interested. However, hospital staffers decline to help him transfer Dylan to a safe facility out of resentment after seeing his speech. Olivia intervenes and offers to transfer Dylan to a children's hospital, and Lloyd is certainly grateful for her help. Olivia is actually impressed that he took responsibility for what happened, even though she thought it foolish. They discover that Olivia would have lived at Harvard in the apartment next door to Lloyd in 1998 had Mark not gotten his transfer out to L.A.; that apartment is where Lloyd met his late wife. Olivia likes the ""small world"" moment, and Lloyd talks about the multiple-universes theory where every decision is played out (which was used in ""Red Dwarf"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."")

In the Persian restaurant in Hong Kong, Mark and Demetri play the recording of the woman's phone call for the owner. He denies knowing who she is, but Mark and Demetri suspect he is not being truthful. Mark makes a thinly veiled threat of CIA capture, and they get the name Nhara Udaya. They'll stake out the Dim Sum restaurant where she eats and wait for her. Even though they don't know what she looks like, her considerable entourage of armed bodyguards is a giveaway. Although Udaya is not willing to give details, as she thinks saying something will negatively alter the future, Mark and Demetri won't budge.

At their insistence, she tells Demetri that he will be shot 3 times at close range, which he takes to mean that he knows his killer. The agents are stunned when she not only tells them the killer is at the table, but that it is Mark. He is incredulous, but she correctly tells him the serial number of his pistol, which she got from the murder report. She assumes that a situation will arise where Mark has to kill Demetri, but Mark isn't having it. He takes Udaya hostage over Demetri's protests, but they are quickly surrounded by the local authorities.

Things get even more confusing for Mark, as Vogel arrives and seems to know Nhadra. She has her bodyguards lower her weapons and convinces Mark to let her go. Mark and Demetri are placed under arrest. Vogel basically orders them back to the U.S., but Mark isn't having it. If Vogel was FBI, Mark and Demetri would never have made it off the plane in the first place. Vogel is really with the CIA, and the Mosaic collective is suddenly of great interest to more than a few agencies and countries. Wedeck gets the video of Mark busting up the restaurant from the U.S. Ambassador to China, and is furious over Mark's insubordination, breach of protocol and diplomacy. Mark gives Demetri his gun and badge. Meanwhile, Udaya is seen in her office, and is revealed to be protecting D. Gibbons, who has come to Hong Kong against her advice.

At the hospital, Janis continues to express her desire to become pregnant, but admits to Bryce that this is problematic because she is a lesbian; he gives her a referral to a sperm bank where he has contacts. Nicole gives Bryce a gift of a cat figurine which carries a traditional Japanese meaning of luck in love. Olivia says goodbye to Lloyd and Dylan. The ambulance attendants put Dylan into the van, but their harsh behavior when he struggles with them raises Olivia's concern. They shoot the security guard she summons, and are ready to shoot her as well. Lloyd steps in between them and they pull him into the ambulance, as they were after him in the first place. The ambulance drives away, leaving Olivia and a screaming Dylan behind.

What will happen next? Find out in March 2010."

Mark continues his investigation into Lloyd's kidnapping while seeing a psychiatrist.

People saw many different things during those two minutes and seventeen seconds. He talks about a window washer who was preparing to do his job for the day. He was no one of consequence, no dreams or aspirations. (""Like most of us, he was already unconscious when the blackout hit."") As he told his partner to hook up his safety harness, the blackout occurred and he fell off a skyscraper. Before the blackout occurred, the man believed in nothing. However, his safety harness caught the scaffolding, and his life was saved. He considered it the turning point in his entire life.

NARRATOR: Big or small, what if that moment affected everyone, everywhere, at the exact same time? What would that mean to you? Where would you look for answers? The answer is NEVER about just one person. Every single person's life was touched by the blackout. None of us...are alone. Each one of us is unique, but we are being stitched together in a tapestry. Something larger that can't be understood until we step back and see the whole thing. We have to make a choice. Do we walk in hope, or do we stumble around, resigning ourselves to chaos?

The narrator was that window washer, who relayed his miracle to others as we saw the principal characters from the show waking up from the blackout.

Wedeck is tearing Mark a new one as he watches the video of Mark pointing a gun in a foreign country. Wedeck wastes no time in mandating that Mark visit the Bureau psychologist a minimum of three times a week until she clears him for duty. Mark is none too happy, but he takes some photos of the bulletin board with the clues he has compiled thus far before leaving. In the meantime, while Simon Campos assists the FBI with who may be behind Lloyd Simcoe's kidnapping, which Olivia Benford also reported, Demetri Noh has a new partner, over his protests: Agent Vogel, who busted Mark and him in Hong Kong. Mark continues the investigation at home, since Charlie was at school and he doesn't play golf. Olivia wants to talk about Mark seeing her hug Lloyd before he is kidnapped. He doesn't want to talk, but he does acknowledge he hasn't been the best husband lately. She proposes moving away from everything that was happening to save their marriage, but he doesn't think they're in trouble.

Mark's first meeting with the FBI's psychologist did not go well. She demands to know what he saw in his flashforward, but he told the same story everybody already knew, which did not account for the full 2:17. She thinks he has a God complex and that the world currently revolved around him. She departs and tells him to make another appointment. During this appointment, she used a drug to help Mark remember more of his flashforward. Mark didn't want to do it at first, but Mark was driving everyone around him crazy.

Lloyd Simcoe is in a dark basement, where one of his kidnappers brings him a drink and demands answers to his questions. Lloyd refuses to talk, and the man tells him he's going to find out what hell will be like very soon. Janis Hawk takes Simon to Lloyd's house to access his computer, while Vogel brings the detectives in who searched his house previously. After more than a few derogatory comments by Simon, Janis goes to the kitchen to get him the beer he requested...only two be assaulted by two men wearing masks similar to the ones on Mark's bulletin board. Simon ends up in the same basement as Lloyd.

Olivia keeps an eye on Dylan at the hospital, over the hospital's protests, and Olivia assures him that they'll find the people who kidnapped his father. Demetri and Vogel investigate the disappearance of an ambulance that was used as a ruse for Lloyd's kidnapping. Both the ambulance and the EMT's were never found. Vogel told Demetri in no uncertain terms that he better do his job if he wants to find a way to avoid his fate on March 15th. To be fair, throwing Demetri to the ground after he tried to take a shot at Vogel was a help. They found the bodies of the EMT's in a train yard. The EMT's were poisoned, but they found the leather case to a mobile phone, which they made sure we knew was a Palm Pre. The idea is hatched to triangulate the signal on the Palm Pre. If the Palm Pre is still in the ambulance, they can find the people who killed the EMT's and took their Palm Pre.

Nicole is also at the hospital, where she sees the man who drowned her in her flashforward. She gives chase but cannot locate him. However, it was clear he knew who she was. She reported her findings to Olivia and Bryce, who tell her to talk to the FBI about it. A nurse at the hospital tells her about ""Sanctuary,"" where the window washer tells people to find a positive spin on flashforwards.

Simon and Lloyd talk in the basement, where Lloyd admits going public with the blame was not one of his brighter ideas. Among the many, many people who want to kill them is the mysterious man from ""Playing Cards with Coyote,"" who got the set of rings that Suspect Zero had on him in Detroit. ""Flosso,"" as he calls himself, proudly admits to being a villain, which he demonstrates by flicking his still-smouldering cigar ashes into Simon's eye. He demands Lloyd tell him how many electron volts were generated by the plasma wakefield experiment Lloyd conducted on October 6th at 11 AM. Simon tries to answer, but Flosso already knew Simon was at his father's funeral in Toronto, and Simon gets knocked down for his efforts. Flosso tells them they didn't cause the blackout; they simply amplified it. Flosso repeats the question, but Lloyd refuses to answer. Later, Lloyd and Simon are alone again, and each reveals their flashforwards. Lloyd talks about getting a text message from Simon, but Simon was too busy snapping someone's neck to send one. Simon is confused on how their flashforwards don't sync up, but Lloyd reminds him of Gough, who killed himself instead of accidentally killing that woman. Lloyd is able to get a small window open to leave a note for help, but it flies away. They are in some sort of industrial park.

Dr. Langer continues to help Mark recall more of his flashforward. More items can now be seen, including ""Red Panda Resources"" and the note for help Lloyd just wrote. He also takes a call, where he says ""I just wish you were standing behind the eight-ball when I came crashing through. Go to hell, Lloyd."" Mark is later sitting outside of a bar and calls Aaron for help instead of going in. He tells Aaron about the new things he knew about his flashforward from the drugs. Apparently, Lloyd was trying to help Mark with the investigation, saying he was close to cracking the Q.E.D., but Mark wasn't listening because he talked to D. Gibbons. Lloyd told him that D. Gibbons lied to Mark. Mark told him unless he could stop him, there would be another blackout.

Mark goes to Wedeck, who can't reinstate him, but he wants Mark to continue investigating his new clues on the Q.T. Wedeck warns him to keep the potential second blackout to himself unless he can come up with more information. After all, look what happened when Lloyd Simcoe went public. At home, while Mark looks over the version of the bulletin board he assembled there, Charlie suggests starting with the corners of the puzzle, like in an actual jigsaw puzzle. Mark tries that approach and investigates Red Panda Resources, which is a philanthropic organization that has been very busy making donations around the world since the blackout. Mark sees this as a chance to get into Somalia, since they do charitable work there. He asks to sneak in on one of their flights, but they refuse.

Nicole talks to Timothy, the window washer/Sanctuary founder at a coffee shop. He has been preaching about loving others since his flashforward, since he was in the middle of a rally in his. She questions why he thinks God is shining down upon us instead of the flashforwards being some sort of wake-up call for the world. Nicole tells Timothy about her flashforward, that she was dead at the end of her flashforward. She demands to know how that could be a good thing. He talks about how Jesus sacrificing himself was something that the Apostles couldn't understand, but the bigger picture made dying on the cross worth it.

TIMOTHY: It's not about fate vs. free will, it's fate AND free will. The answers to our most burning questions may be right in front of us.

Nicole returns home with Bryce, who kept an eye on her while she met with Timothy, where her mother was not in the greatest shape. That is, if burning a Bible and ""don't touch my hair; you'll scare the butterflies"" is any indication. Nicole's mother is making a wall of pennies, and Bryce donated to the cause. Nicole's mother only wants pennies from 1989, the year of Nicole's birth, as the wall is a tribute to her. Her mother can't understand people whining about their flashforwards when she has a hallucination every day. Nicole and Bryce stick around to help her with the wall.

Flosso and his goons returned for Round 2, including returning the help note that Lloyd wrote that supposedly flew away. Lloyd doesn't answer any of his questions...or that he CAN'T answer any of his questions. Flosso lets ""the wild rumpus begin,"" by cutting off Simon's finger with a cigar cutter. Several beatdowns later, Flosso shows photos of Lloyd's family to him, and Lloyd confesses they generated over one quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) volts from the experiment.

Mark finds a menu from the restaurant on his car; the same menu with Lloyd's ""Help Us"" written on it and on his bulletin board. He goes to the restaurant's new location and finds out where the old location was; the one that burned down a month prior. Mark can't get in, but it was the place where Lloyd and Simon were being kept. At first, Mark leaves, but memories of his phone call to Lloyd in his flashforward compel him to drive his car through the restaurant. Mark engages in a shootout with the bad guys and rescues Lloyd. Mark sits down with Lloyd and wants to know everything. Simon goes out the back and shoots one of his captors. Flosso was already long gone. Or so it seemed. He was in the ambulance waiting for Simon, who apparently was in cahoots with Flosso the whole time. Simon wants out, but Flosso can identify Simon as the man at the baseball game in Detroit who was awake during the blackout. Simon was Suspect Zero. He buried his father earlier that morning in Toronto, but Flosso's bosses wanted to talk to him. He was taken to Detroit, where a person on the phone that has known him since he was 13 ordered him to take his seat at the baseball game. Inside a tub of popcorn is a ring similar to the ones Flosso obtained previously. Simon is ordered to put the ring on, which prevents him from blacking out when the rest of the stadium...and the world...does. The man calls him back, telling him to walk to the nearest tunnel, where Flosso, also awake, takes the ring back.

Olivia treats Simon at the hospital and releases him into the custody of Janis Hawk. The FBI is already grilling Lloyd Simcoe and they intend to play him against Lloyd to get one or both to admit to what happened. So far, neither was bending. Mark, now reinstated for rescuing Lloyd and Simon, interrogates Lloyd. Most importantly, Mark wants to know if another blackout is coming and why Lloyd didn't say anything before now. Lloyd demands the same thing of Mark, and Mark refuses to let Lloyd play, given that Lloyd called him in the vision from Olivia's bedroom. Unfortunately, Simon fakes an allergic reaction to the penicillin he was given and escapes. However, the FBI isn't that stupid and catch him returning to Toronto. He wants to visit his sister, who ran away. Wedeck allows them to stay the night if Simon wears a tracking bracelet. It turns out Simon was telling the truth. Simon visits his mother, who blames herself for his sister running away. Simon had been returning to Toronto once a month to help look for his sister. Simon slips out of the bathroom window, masking the tracking bracelet with aluminum foil. He goes to visit an old professor, but Janis cannot be fooled. She catches him again. The professor confirms that he advised Simon on the towers he built in Somalia, and that an amplification of power could have caused everyone's flashforwards. However, the professor has no idea how to build a structure to prevent it from happening again.

Back at Simon's mother's house, Janis helps her prepare dinner while Simon gets a visit from Uncle Teddy, AKA Flosso. They kept themselves at bay during dinner. However, Simon was starting to crack a bit and looked ready to kill ""Uncle Teddy."" As it turns out, Simon's alibi for not causing the blackout, being at his father's funeral, was arranged by Flosso through a ""hunting accident."" Simon had been part of this experiment since he was 13 because of his exceptional skills in theoretical physics, and his father was killed so that people wouldn't blame him for it. Simon was told to have a story for his fake flashforward, and strangling Flosso's thug who shot his father became that story. Now, however, Flosso wants Simon to stay in and continue providing information on the experiment. Flosso shows a video on his phone of Annabelle, Simon's sister, reading a fake note with a gun to her head to make her mom think she simply ran away. Flosso also killed his old professor and thinks he has Simon under his control. However, Simon calls his bluff and knocks Flosso to the ground. He cuts off Flosso's blood supply and kills him.

SIMON: I never get pushed around...and I always get even."

Simon had been part of this experiment since he was 13 because of his exceptional skills in theoretical physics, and his father was killed so that people wouldn't blame him for it. Simon was told to have a story for his fake flashforward, and strangling Flosso 's thug who shot his father became that story. Now, however, Flosso wants Simon to stay in and continue providing information on the experiment. Flosso shows a video on his phone of Annabelle, Simon's sister, reading a fake note with a gun to her head to make her mom think she simply ran away. Flosso also killed his old professor and thinks he has Simon under his control. However, Simon calls his bluff and knocks Flosso to the ground. He cuts off Flosso's blood supply and kills him.

SIMON: I never get pushed around...and I always get even."

Aaron investigates the link between Jericho and his daughter.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Constantine Makris'],"['', '', '']",[],['one word episode title'],[],"15 YEARS AGO

Aaron (Brían F. O'Byrne) is in prison but hours away from a parole hearing. His daughter, Tracy (Genevieve Padalecki), makes sure he isn't drinking. As she leaves, a prison guard says some very unsavory things about his 13-year-old daughter and goads Aaron into hitting him, which earns Aaron a beating by several guards with batons.

PRESENT DAY

A complete 180. Tracy is now the one doing the drinking. Aaron wouldn't let her do it in the house, so he finds her in a bar. Even worse than the drinking is the fact that if Aaron can find her so quickly, what about the private army, Jericho, who wants her dead? How tough would it be for them? He brings Tracy back home and makes her favorite: grilled peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches. He talked to her about James Erskine, who is head of operations for Jericho. Tracy tells of her C.O. being killed in a helicopter crash two days after her alleged death. She snuck on a humanitarian plane back to the U.S. when she found Jericho was after her, but she now regrets putting him in danger. Aaron assures her that they'll be safe. However, the men who come in and kidnap Tracy later on would paint a different story.

Zoey (Gabrielle Union) is discussing what she now knew about her flashforward with Demetri (John Cho). Demetri tries to convince her that Mark (Joseph Fiennes) won't kill him. He's ordered the gun destroyed, and tries to convince her they will be getting married. That's not good enough for Zoey, who goes to talk to Mark. She wants to know what Mark would do to get into this situation. Mark confesses he believes someone is leaking information at the FBI. And perhaps it is (""Well, if we're playing Wild Accusations...""). Zoey leaves with a less-than-respectful attitude towards Mark. She goes to Demetri's office and hands Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) a Freedom of Information filing to get all of the data on the Mosaic Project. Wedeck doesn't want to do it, but Zoey goes full-lawyer on him, ticking off Demetri in the process. Wedeck plays hardball, but Zoey will drag him into a public courtroom if she has to, which Wedeck doesn't want. He sends Demetri to get the files.

Mark is grilling Lloyd Simcoe (Jack Davenport) about the 2nd blackout and the man who cloned D. Gibbons' credit card. Lloyd continues to play hardball and Mark is not happy. He takes Lloyd to the house to have Lloyd describe why he was in Mark's house in his vision. He wants all the details. Lloyd talks about getting a text message from Simon, with part of a formula which he had written on the mirror. With lipstick. He didn't know it was Olivia (Sonya Walger). He calls the number and asks Mark on the phone if he had been drinking. He said he was close to cracking the QED, which they figured out was some sort of formula. Lloyd then came down the stairs and heard a girl's voice...Mark's daughter. The last thing Lloyd remembered from his vision was Olivia saying ""Hi, honey,"" but he didn't know who it was. Mark asks about why Lloyd said D. Gibbons was lying, but Lloyd didn't know. Mark wants to know how Lloyd thinks D. Gibbons is a liar when he claimed not knowing D. Gibbons. Lloyd obviously knows. The man is Dyson Frost, who Lloyd saw at Oxford. That is saw him steal work Lloyd did on wave mechanics and take credit for it. However, Lloyd thought he was dead. And he doesn't have any connection to Charlie saying ""D. Gibbons is a bad man."" Mark figures out that Lloyd wasn't threatened, Dylan was. Unfortunately, Lloyd told Flosso everything, enough for Frost to cause another blackout. Mark wants to find him.

Aaron comes home to discover Tracy missing. He has only one possible lead: the young soldier he gave a job to at the power company. He had told him earlier in the day that Tracy was at his house. He goes by to see Mike, who is conveniently moving away. Aaron is clearly suspicious and tells Mike about being in prison for 2 1/2 years for being in a bar fight. ""Prison makes you a capable man."" the ""animal"" that he tries to keep inside once prison was completed has been let out. Mike puts two and two together and attacks Aaron. Aaron gets the upper hand and threatens to break Mike's arm in several places unless Mike tells him where Jericho took Tracy.

Demetri and Janis (Christine Woods) talk about their respective days. Janis had gone to a fertility clinic and convinced them to help her despite her condition. She is determined to have more than her life as an agent, since all she could think of while she was shot was that baby.

Mark brings Lloyd's findings to Wedeck, talking about the ""mirror test,"" which determines consciousness in various species, including crows. Wedeck wants to know how to sell to Washington to send agents on a trip to Somalia to study the dead crows and the towers. Surprisingly, it's Vogel who suggests not telling them, since it's easier to beg forgivness than ask for permission. However, Mark won't go, since Mark is way too important to risk on the trip. Demetri and Janis will accompany Vogel to Somalia. Vogel will take them in pretending to be Red Panda. Simon (Dominic Monaghan) insists on joining them, since he designed the towers.

At his kids' birthday party, James Erskine (James Remar) suddenly discovers the power out in his house, courtesy of Aaron. He tries to strongarm Erskine into saying where Tracy is, but Erskine isn't saying a thing.

AARON: You know the guys you need to worry about the most? The ones who have nothing to lose.

Aaron has tapped Erskine's phone lines. Sure enough, Erskine calls the man who has Tracy, who says the ""package"" is on its way to Kandahar and that the ""father"" should be dealt with. The call was made to Mike, only Mike is tied up in the trunk of Aaron's car. But clearly Aaron was not going to take that lightly. He calls Mark to say that things have 'escalated' with Tracy's friends. He tells Mark that he's going off the grid to ""go to war"" against Jericho. Hanging Mike upside down outside of Erskine's house is a good start.

Demetri goes ballistic when he finds out Zoey will represent Alda Herzog, who was the terrorist Mark and Demetri chased originally, but Zoey defends herself by saying she is withholding information about Demetri's death, and this was the only way to get it from her. Zoey is scared, and she tells him in no uncertain terms that she will do anything to stop him from being killed."

We get a big recap of everyone's flashes and what's happened since.

Ganwar Region, Somalia

The gang is on a helicopter on its way to the towers, learning Somali phrases from a genial guide. He asks Janis and Demetri about their flashes. She says she was baking bread. He claims he was waterskiing. Demetri said he thought she was supposed to be ""baking bread"" this week. She says Vogel's field trip is making that unlikely. When they land Simon wants a gun. Vogel says nope, he's just an adviser and to stay close to the security guys.

Back in L.A., Mark shows Wedeck a painting of the Hydra. He says it was done by D. Gibbons (who is a bad man) and relates to a man named Dyson Frost who Simcoe ID'ed as a brilliant, reclusive particle physicist who became a chess grand master at 15, which relates to the chess piece he found. Although Frost supposedly died in 1990, he's still kicking. This picture was on Mark's board in his vision. Wedeck tells him to go investigate Dyson Frost.

In Somalia, they find the tower. And as they walk through town they are immediately shot at. They all hit the deck. The leader of the warlords occupying the town comes forward. Vogel tells the guide to translate saying they are aide workers from Red Panda, peaceful and with a right to enter. The gum-chomping leader, whose name is Abdi Khalif, promptly shoots the guide. He introduces himself and notes that he speaks English, so they don't need their guide anymore.

Khalif and his men bring the group to a building. They pull Simon aside saying they saw him on Al-Jazeera saying he caused the blackout. Khalif punches him and says God caused the blackout. Vogel tries again saying they are aide workers.

Khalif knows they're lying, just like ""the others."" Janis asks what others. Khalif remembers, and we see, that when he was a boy people came to the town offering, as a humanitarian act, to provide the town with electricity via the towers. He says he knows they were there for some other reason.

He was outside the towers one day tending goats and, when he returned, all the people of the village were lying on the ground dead. He was scared and confused. He tried to rouse his mother but couldn't. He saw a camel--alive and kicking--nearby and ran before death could take hold of him, too. He says everything happens for a purpose. He has his men grab one of their colleagues, the helicopter pilot, drag him outside, and shoot him. He says that man has now served his purpose. He says he knows they're here for a reason and he will kill them all if they don't tell what the reason is.

In L.A., Bryce is getting sick in the restroom at the hospital. His beeper goes off. He heads off and literally bumps into Nicole making her drop her book: a medical book. She admits she's trying out a pre-med class. She doesn't want anyone to see her fail if she does. He jokes that Dr. Kirby has a nice ring to it. He jokes that his real name is Martin Goathead. He promises he won't tell anyone her secret. He coughs and she asks if he's alright. He likes that she's already diagnosing patients and says he's fine, and they part ways.

Back in Somalia, Demetri points out that the locals aren't buying the humanitarian shtick so they need to come up with a plan before they all get shot. Vogel points out that Demetri's done anyway so what difference does it make. They start fighting. Which turns out to have been a cover to attack and neutralize the men guarding them and get their guns. Mission accomplished. They head off to do the same to Khalif and his men. Vogel says if all goes well, Simon may get that gun after all.

They go to the copter and begin shooting bad guys. One of the bad guy's missile launcher goes off, destroying a nearby building. Under cover of the explosion, they take down the other men. Khalif rolls up in a tank, the Feds drop their weapons and Khalif shoots his own men. He says they failed him but the Feds will not, they will fulfill their part of ""the plan.""

At the Benford home, Mark and Olivia have lunch. Olivia's been looking at houses in Denver. There's two major hospitals that need surgeons and the FBI has a division there. He jokes about joining the ski police and coming home to her wrapped in a tiger skin. She says they don't have to decide right now, although they should pursue it.

He says it's finally time to ask Charlie about what she saw in her flash, especially if it can help the investigation. He says with the D. Gibbons issue, they can't deny that their family needs to be part of the puzzle. He wants to bring her down to the office to talk to someone who has been dealing with kids and their flashes. Olivia wants to try and talk to her first. He says okay. And she gets back to the Denver home listings.

In Somalia, Khalif, who has a huge scar across his face, complains about the lack of U.S. aid to his country where children are dying every six seconds. Janis says they already send hundreds of millions in food relief and it gets stolen by people like him. Khalif pulls a gun on one of the security dudes who promptly pukes and gives up that they are CIA. (?) Khalif whacks Simon and goes to Demetri and asks again why they are here. He says they think the flash forward may have happened before, on a smaller scale here, and that maybe those people from his village weren't dead. Khalif says they were since he saw the black camel, which is a bad sign in his culture. ""Death is a black camel that kneels at every man's gate."" He reiterates they were dead. He came back from the refugee camps changed--an older boy with a gun--and the bodies were gone and it was a ghost town. And there was only one tower left. Word spread that he had lived and others had died, and he became feared and he used that fear to become the person he is now, which was God's plan.

His flash was that he was making a speech to a huge crowd, quoting Lincoln's line about the ""better angels of our nature"" and he was telling the world that he was the new face of Somalia and it was God's plan for him to rule this country. He says they will help because they are CIA and they can get him what he needs: planes, tanks and boats. Vogel says that ain't happening. He punches him in the gut with the gun and says that yes, they will get him these things to win his war. He then shoots the security guy.

Janis tells Vogel to make the call. Vogel says he can't, there is no cavalry. Demetri says there have to be options since most of these people saw themselves alive. She points out that Khalif also saw himself as the leader of this country. ""Yeah, better angels,"" says Demetri. She muses on that phrase. When Khalif returns, he asks what it'll be. They grab Simon. She tells Khalif that his prophecy was wrong and she can prove it to him; she says that she knows about the better angels.

He drags her outside and asks what's up. She points out that the line was from Lincoln's inaugural address. He knows all about Lincoln. She says his speech was about unity. He says she doesn't know what he saw. She says no, but she thinks she knows someone who did. They go online and she finds a site that talks about prophecies, a man who saw Khalif's speech as part of his flash describes what Khalif said and what he was wearing including a necklace of Khalif's mother that he hasn't seen since the day she ""died."" We see more of the speech and Janis says it was about unity. She says Khalif doesn't need tanks or guns since his destiny is to stop the war, not start one.

Charlie is playing video bowling when Olivia comes to talk to her. She asks her to be brave and tell her what she saw in her flash. She says it's okay to be afraid but she might be able to help daddy and others and be a hero. Charlie gets tearful and says if she tells her, something bad will happen. Olivia promises nothing bad will happen.

We see her flash: she was in the kitchen and Dylan was there. She tells him to take a cookie from the jar since it's his house too. She overheard Lloyd saying ""the man you call D. Gibbons lied to you."" Dylan hears too and says liars are bad people and takes the magnetic letters on the fridge and spells out ""D. Gibbons is a bad man."" She didn't see D. Gibbons though. She says she heard something, she went to look out the back door and saw two men in suits, where one said to the other, ""Mark Benford is dead."" Charlie cries and hugs Olivia.

She relays the message to Mark who says it isn't possible since in his flash, he's at his board at work. She tells him that this is the point where she tells him that they can escape to Denver and then it's the part where he tells her they can't. He says nothing. She gets up to walk away. He says there's going to be another blackout and he has to try and stop it. She walks away.

In Somalia, they explain to a now less combative Khalif that his people weren't dead, but blacked out. They go to the tower. He explains the ""66:6"" is from a Koran passage about saving yourself and your family from the fire. He wrote it himself. All this time, he's been afraid of going in but the one thing more powerful than fear, he says, is destiny. Simon is agape. Janis says it looks like he's seen a ghost. He says it's the opposite. What he imagined only existed on paper and could maybe be built in some nebulous future. And yet it's been standing here for 18 years even though he didn't design it until a year later.

Inside Simon confirms it's his design. Demetri wonders why they left one behind for them to find. Vogel says maybe the war interrupted them. There's a chess board inside one compartment. Inside the board is a video. It has people from Khalif's village talking about their flashes and how they came true, including his mother. She was looking for him. Next up on the tape is one of the researchers--D.Gibbons--on the tape saying that the experiment in consciousness-shifting two weeks into the future worked. Demetri is perplexed that D. Gibbons was in Somalia in 1991. Vogel points out to Khalif that God had nothing to do with it, that this was a man-made phenomenon.

Simon finds a trap door and they descend and into a Hatch and find a crazy Scottish guy. (Just kidding!) It's a tunnel to a ""linear accelerator"" which created the ""beta-blackout."" Demetri points out that five towers were needed to knock out the village. Certainly just one couldn't knock out the whole world. You never know, says Simon; technology moves fast. Vogel finds another door, which opens on to a huge warehouse-like space full of skeletons. The remains of the villagers. They were all executed. Khalif finds his mother's skeleton and picks up the necklace seen in his flash. Khalif is now shifting his anger to Simon whom he claims is responsible. Simon says his plans were stolen. Khalif is about to shoot Simon when Vogel shoots Khalif first. Janis is freaked, saying Khalif had a ""better angels"" vision and this wasn't supposed to happen.

Mark comes to Olivia and she asks him yes or no, can they get away from all their visions and L.A. He can't say anything. She says he can't have both. He says this is what they signed on for, they both save lives. She says this is how it happens: the marriage dissolution. She reiterates he can't have it both ways--yes or no? He doesn't answer.

Janis is contemplative. Demetri brings in some food and rum. They toast yet another flash forward never coming true. She asks if she's okay. She says sure, so she won't have a baby, lots of people don't. He says she can have a baby later. But it won't be the one she named Willa though. She was supposed to conceive this weekend. She feels stupid, she just saw a mass grave and all she can think about is a mythical baby. Demetri says the weekend isn't over and if it's babymaking she needs ""he'll take one for the team."" She says um, you're not my type and ew, gross. He says he will make her gayer. She asks about Zoey. He says, chances are he won't be around and it would be nice if Willa was. She asks if he's serious.

Simon comes to Vogel sitting by a fire in another room. He got a gun off of one of Khalif's men by fixing their satellite TV. He says Vogel thinks he might not think Simon can handle a weapon but in his vision he was killing a man and he didn't even need a gun. (As he says this, he unwraps his hand exposing his pinky stump.) He asks what Vogel saw. We see Vogel's vision. He's the man Charlie saw saying to the other man, ""Mark Benford is dead."" Vogel doesn't say this, though. He just says he was doing his job.

Nicole is grabbing graham crackers for a patient and Bryce commends her instincts for listening. She's more worried about organic chemistry. He gifts her with his lucky calculator. She thanks him and asks if he really thinks she can do it. He says yes, he doesn't lie and he's not that nice. She talks about going into psychiatry since she's an expert in dealing with people's problems. So in twelve years they can work together! He admits that he lied earlier and that, twelve years from now, he might not be around.

Demetri looks at the video again. Simon enters. Demetri says he's packing stuff up and he's been thinking about life, death, and fate. Simon tells him not to ponder too much. Then suddenly the video, which had gone to black, crackles back to life and it's D. Gibbons who says ""Hello Demetri. My name is Dyson Frost and I'm recording this message in 1991. Got your attention, didn't I?"""

Olivia checks on Mark in the hospital - he's been shot. Just a glancing blow in the shoulder, but she's worried about his safety. She wants to know something will change. He tells her Wedeck offered him a spot on the DHS counter-terrorism task force - surveillance, but he'd be out of the line of fire. He promises that her family will always come first.

Present Day

Mark moves out of the house, telling Olivia he'll be staying at the Wedecks. Their daughter Charlie is hunkered down in his car's backseat. She asks him why he's going. He says he hopes to be back soon. She gives him back the friendship bracelet she made him that he's wearing in his flash forward.

Mark, Demetri and Wedeck watch the 1991 tape of D. Gibbons/Dyson Frost that they recovered in Somalia. He says if they're watching it in 2010, it means there's been a global blackout and a near miss in Pigeon, Utah. He tells them he's had hundreds of flash forwards, and in nearly all of them he ends up dying on March 15, like Demetri. He says the next move is Mark Benford's.

Demetri assures Wedeck the tape really is from 1991.

Mark tells Demetri they know there will be another blackout. They think preventing it is Mark's next move.

Simon admires the circuitry made from his designs, with Lloyd. There are references to tachionic dark matter, which they discovered later. Simon thinks that means they didn't cause the blackout.

Lloyd shows Simon the formula he saw on the mirror in his flash forward, something to reverse flash forwards. But there's only part of it. Simon suggests Lloyd go talk to Olivia.

Cho can't find a trace of Gibbons, but Mark is looking at chess clubs. The last guy Gibbons beat was Ian McKinnon. He hung up when Mark called him. Mark replays Gibbons' last move - the queen sacrifice - from his 1991 match, he thinks it's a message and that Gibbons knew they'd see it.

Mark's looking at the time it took Gibbons to make each move, the pauses work out to Morse code for a phone number. Mark calls the pre-paid cell. It's Gibbons/Frost saying ""well done, leave a message.""

Mark tells him it's his move.

Keiko, the Japanese woman from Bryce's flash forward, waits for him at the sushi restaurant where they're supposed to meet. The waitress knows she's been there a lot and asks if she needs a job, but she says she's looking for a new beginning.

Meanwhile, Bryce gets chemo and Nicole sits with him. They make plans for dinner later.

Mark and Demetri arrive in San Francisco to see McKinnon, but arrive to find he was just shot in the back of the head. Later, Mark catches Vogel up to speed and they conclude a leak in their investigation got McKinnon killed.

The next day, Vogel and a hoard of CIA stride into the office and start rounding everyone up. Wedeck is displeased as they take everyone's cell phone. Mark watches as Simon is herded into the conference room. Wedeck correctly guesses what's going on and explains it to FBI agent Jake Curdy (Family Guy (1999) creator Seth MacFarlane).

They sweep Mark's office for bugs and find one in his computer keyboard. (Previous sweeps didn't find it because it's voice activated and the sweeps were done in the middle of the night. Vogel sings to set it off.)

Vogel addresses the gathered troops. Demetri's first because he was part of the failed attempt to contact Ian McKinnon.

Mark and Vogel talk to Demetri but Mark says he doesn't think it's him; he just wants them to think he suspects everyone.

Back in the conference room, Agent Curdy confesses he has personal password-protected files on his computer hiding his role-playing game.

Mark comes for the next person. He shows them the microtransmitter Vogel just pulled out of his keyboard. ""Good thing the fate of the planet doesn't rely on Mark Benford finding the mole,"" Simon sneers.

Bryce's intended love wanders into a garage lot and sees gansta cars hopping and a guy trying to fix one. She offers to help, using big car words to prove she knows what she's talking about. He lets her take a look.

Back at the FBI, it's Janice's turn for the third degree. She thinks getting shot should put her above suspicion. Mark notes she's had a lot of unexplained absences from work. She tells them she's been going to a fertility clinic. But they checked, she was gone 13 days and only had 8 appointments. She tells them she's been suspicious since her shooting, she's been checking up on people.

She tells them an agent named Marcie has a dying brother who's racking up medical bills and she didn't disclose him in her file. There was an anonymous deposit to her account for $50,000 awhile ago.

Olivia takes Charlie out for a ""girl's day"" and tries to explain that both her parents love her and they'll always be a family.

Demetri tells Mark that Marcie did disclose her brother on her original form, but it just wasn't transferred to their files. Mark's rattled and angry over not knowing who to trust. He tells Demetri he moved out.

He tells Demetri to keep looking at Marcie.

Simon is among those still waiting in the conference room.

Riding a carousel, Olivia thinks she sees a man watching them. She hustles Charlie out of there, but they run into the man. He tells them he's their security, FBI, assigned by Mark.

At the garage, the manager is prepared to give Keiko a job, paying her off the books. Her engineering background should serve her well. He introduces her to the guys, telling his tattooed, thuggish employees that Keiko works there now and they should treat her with respect.

At work, Olivia leaves Mark a message thanking him for the security. Lloyd interrupts, saying they need to talk.

He tells her he needs to know what was on the mirror. She writes down the part she recognized, the formula for an anesthetic. He realizes it relates to what he and Mark were working on. The QED he saw was for Quantum Entanglement Device (sure, that clears everything right up).

At the sushi house, Keiko tells her new boss about waiting for Bryce. She tells him her flash forward was the best day of her life. He says only that he saw something different than her. They toast sake.

Bryce and Nicole walk up to a sushi restaurant and read the menu outside. They're getting along famously as usual when he suddenly kisses her. She pulls away, saying he can't kiss her while he's thinking about another woman. He apologizes, she says okay. They walk away and we see they were standing right outside the window where Keiko was seated, but they didn't see each other.

At the garage the next day, immigration suddenly busts in. They cuff Keiko along with everybody else and put her in a van.

Driving, Bryce stops at a red light and calls Nicole. He leaves a message at first apologizing then telling her he's glad he kissed her. He sees the immigration van drive by.

Mark and Demetri watch security footage of Marcie taking a coffee break outside. They realize that every time she puts sugar in her coffee, she was signaling her handlers. She sees them realize that she's the mole.

In the conference room, she leaps to her feet, grabs another agent's gun and starts shooting. Among others, she takes out Curdy. She shoots her way out of there, and Mark and Demetri chase her down the stairs. She makes it outside where someone in black leather on a motorcycle peels up just in time for her to jump on the back and speed off.

She's close to getting away when Janice runs around the side of the building and steps in their path, firing like a woman who's angry about nearly dying. She hits the driver and they veer into the fountain. Marcie runs for it but Janice jumps in and wades after her, tackling her and finishes her with a nice roundhouse to the face. Marcie, the mole, is caught.

Later, Wedeck chides Mark for leaving him out of his mole-seeking adventure. He compares it to the queen's sacrifice, Frost's move.

Mark's cell rings. It's Frost. He says now that their mole problem has been fixed, he looks forward to meeting him.

Simon and Janice walk to their cars. She tells him she reviewed his uncle Teddy's autopsy photos and the CPR he gave him could have killed him. She pauses. ""You murdered him to send a message,"" she says, adding: ""Message received.""

Simon realizes what she's acknowledging. ""I should have known: a double-blind. Two moles. In case one is caught. Brilliant, and not one person in the office would suspect it's you, not one.""

She smiles. ""Well that would be the point now, wouldn't it?"""

Agent Mark Benford (Joseph Fiennes) is addressing a new crop of FBI field agents. Demetri Noh (John Cho), Janis Hawk (Christine Woods), Al Gough (Lee Thompson Young), and Marcie Turoff. Benford is telling the new field agents that every one of them will have a story about their first day. Some are funny, some are tragic, some are boring. But the most important day for them will sneak up on them on some random Tuesday, when they're in the right place at the right time to do the right thing and help someone who won't even know their name. As the rookies gathered, Marcie is not thrilled to be working for Janis in the office doing analysis, especially since she scored higher (""in one category!"") at Quantico. Everyone is convinced Marcie will be out there ahead of all of them. And that she was.

MARCH 12, 2010

Mark and Demetri are handling Marcie's interrogation, but she refuses to say anything about who recruited her and why she shot six FBI agents during the mole hunt. She does admit to the sugar in her coffee was a signal to her handlers that she had information for them, but Mark and Demetri already knew that. Demetri is peppering her with questions with only three days to go before his supposed murder, but Mark pulls him off of the interrogation, replacing him with Janis. Janis plays it like she doesn't know anything, but Marcie is incensed because nobody ever asked her about her flashforward. In it, she's in prison and happy, since they can't execute her for murder until she tells them who recruited her. She only reveals being recruited three months before the blackout.

Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) pulls Mark out to introduce him to two liaisons from D.C. who immediately take Marcie back there for questioning instead of letting the L.A. office handle it. They also find Mark's revolver; the one that was to be Demetri's murder weapon. Someone was warming it up by performing another murder. A fiftysomething man sleeping in a shelter takes three in the chest from Mark's revolver, but the man seemed to know who the person was, since witnesses heard him say ""I knew it was you; I just didn't want to believe."" Mark is less worried about the shooter and more worried about the person who took his gun out of lockup in the first place. One of the people who had access was Marcie. They catch up to her before the FBI puts her on the plane. She didn't know who wanted the gun nor did she have a reliable phone number. All she knew is that he was to die in L.A.

Olivia (Sonya Walger) takes Charlie to a park near their house because Charlie apparently made a playdate with Dylan. Sure enough, Lloyd (Jack Davenport) is with him, and the awkwardness begins. Even with Mark out of the house, Olivia is hesitant to be near Lloyd, but his help when Charlie falls off the slide is appreciated. Later that night, Olivia comes over to Lloyd's house to thank him for his help with Charlie that day. She wants to leave, but he wanted to know why she came to his house just to thank him. Why not just call? A heart-to-heart conversation later, both talk about the mistakes they made since all of this started. She wants to walk away, but he reminds her that he was in that room, that bed with her on April 29th, and not by accident.

OLIVIA: That scares me.

LLOYD: It should. (they kiss)

Wedeck left the office for a few hours for a meeting...on Air Force Two at LAX. Having done the dirty work for the President back in the day, the Vice-President was interested in talking to him. She asks him about Jericho, since the CEO tripled the security around his Malibu house. The Vice-President knew Jericho had done some things to threaten national security in her flashforward, and she needed Wedeck, not the NSA, to do some off-the-book investigating. Whatever Jericho is doing, it's bad enough to bring down President Segovia.

VICE-PRESIDENT: These flashforwards are coming true. Segovia is going down. Do you want to be out with the old or in with the new?

Wedeck asks Mark about why he researched Jericho a few months back. He tells Wedeck about Aaron (Brían F. O'Byrne) and how his daughter might be involved. Wedeck seems to have an idea to possibly talk to Aaron and ""encourage"" a little investigation into Jericho. The only problem is, Aaron has gone off the grid, and Mark can't find him. But Demetri did find where Mark's gun...and the man who had it...were. A man named Ross, off his rocker because he thought a mobile phone salesperson caused the blackouts, takes her hostage. Demetri talks him into releasing the woman and then shoots him, stopping Ross from killing the hostage with Mark's gun.

Unfortunately, a closer examination of the gun reveals it wasn't Mark's. Now Mark wants to know why Demetri went through all of that. Demetri wanted to ask Ross before the cops came in and shot him dead. Demetri was losing it, but Mark couldn't give him any good advice, given all the bad decisions he has made as well. His only recommendation for Demetri: take Zoey (Gabrielle Union) and get lost. Don't wait for her to attend his funeral. Demetri doesn't want to run away, but Mark tells him he's being smart. We also get a look at how Demetri and Zoey met...in a courtroom, where she grilled him about his notes on a suspect. She offered to take him to dinner to make up for embarassing him on the witness stand. In the present day, he asks her to get married right then and there, perhaps go to Hawaii and stay there until well past April 29th. She says yes.

Wedeck, after searching around Echo Park, because he was also looking for a nerdy guy with a computer in his head and the hot CIA agent who protects him, found Aaron. He explains that some very powerful people want Jericho taken down, and he wants Aaron to get the proof for him. Aaron tells Wedeck about Tracy (Genevieve Padalecki) being kidnapped by Jericho and taken back to Afghanistan. He explains Tracy seeing Jericho wipe out an entire village. Wedeck puts the plans in motion to smuggle Aaron over there and equips him for the mission. He warns Aaron that this is probably a one-way trip, and the only thing he wants from Aaron is Tracy's recorded testimony or any evidence he can record. Aaron is convinced he'll see his daughter since he did in his flashforward.

After having a quick bachelor party at the nearest bar, Janis escorts a wasted Demetri home. Demetri still thinks he's scared for running off, but Janis tells him it's always good to have an exit strategy. He tries to apologize for Somalia, but she tells him she is pregnant. How is something of a mystery,

As Demetri and Zoey look over the church for their wedding (while a mysterious stranger watches out of sight), Vreede (Barry Shabaka Henley) finds a videotape of a man fitting Frost's description getting into a 1970's blue Citroen sedan, the same sedan spotted at the homeless shelter. They can't understand why Frost made a videotape for Mark 19 years ago, gave him a number to call, and yet goes to murder a homeless person. There had to be a connection, since Mark's gun was used. The connection, unfortunately, was to be found at Demetri's house, where he was attacked by Frost as he prepared to get married. Everybody is waiting for him at the church, while Frost has his body in the back of his car near a carnival at Charlie's school. Mark calls Olivia at the carnival and tells her about Demetri not showing up for his wedding. Mark warns her to be careful, but she needs to worry about Charlie even more, as Frost is with her."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1618599/?ref_=ttep_ep17,,The FBI attempts to track down the missing Demetri. Olivia discovers who texted her about Mark's flashforward. Alda Hertzog wants to strike a deal to tell Zoey information about Demetri's whereabouts.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Nick Gomez'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Demetri (John Cho), having been captured by Dyson Frost, awakens to find himself in a room with a very large writing board full of information, not too unlike Mark's wall at the FBI. Included on that wall is March 15, 2010, with his picture next to it. However, the wall is the least of his problems. A laser sight from a gun is aimed at him, and he is strapped to a chair that appeared to be rigged to the gun. No doubt the gun...Mark's gun...would fire if he attempted to move. Time was not on his side, as today was March 15th.

At the FBI, Charlie tries to tell Mark (Joseph Fiennes), Olivia (Sonya Walger), and Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) about Dyson Frost. She didn't remember a lot of details at first, and Olivia worried that Mark was pushing her too much for information. Wedeck tells Charlie to close her eyes and try to remember what she saw. We then see the conversation between Charlie and Dyson. Although she was taught not to talk to strangers, Dyson claimed he was working with Charlie's father on something very important. He asks her if she like Dr. Seuss. She likes Horton, which he agrees with, because Horton was determined to do his job, regardless of what anybody else said. Dyson asks Charlie to give Mark a picture of Oedipus, which had a meeting time and place on the back to allow Dyson to talk to them. Everybody thanks Charlie for her help, but Olivia is still worried about Charlie. Mark recommends the child psychologist on-staff at the FBI.

OLIVIA: She doesn't need therapy. She needs stability. She needs to feel protected. She needs to know there aren't scary men who are going to ask her to deliver messages to her daddy. She thinks you're going to die!

Zoey (Gabrielle Union) visits Alda Hertzog in prison to get more details about Demetri's death. Alda refuses to tell her anything, especially given she had been held for five months in prison without being charged. Zoey tried to get her a hearing but was unsuccessful. Although next to impossible, Alda demanded a hearing that day and wouldn't say another word to Zoey until she got it. Zoey manages to get her a hearing but surrounds her with marshals just to be on the safe side. Alda wasn't worried one bit, since she was apparently part of the group who tasked Dyson Frost to create the blackout. Six monts before the blackout, one of the people involved, who was one of the people to torture Lloyd Simcoe and Campos earlier, convinced her to use whatever means at her disposal to keep Dyson on a tight leash. However, upon visiting Dyson, he played a videotape of their conversation, boasting he was always six moves ahead of them. On the good side, Dyson assures them they are on schedule for October 6th, the day of the blackout. Also, one of the QED's, which are the rings that needed to be worn to prevent blacking out, was ready. The other rings would take time.

In the present, Demetri tries to test the limits of the rig holding him in place and decides it'd be better not to. With six hours to go until his death, Dyson Frost explains why he has Demetri there. It was nothing personal, but Dyson had been working with thousands of flashforwards since the 1980's. Some flashforwards went ahead 20 minutes, some 20 years. 78% of the time, Demetri died on March 15, 2010...and so did Dyson...usually killed by Demetri. With the many different pathways the future could take (hence the title ""The Garden of Forking Paths""), Demetri is actually there for insurance. Dyson simply wants to live past March 15th, the most important day on the forking paths.

DEMETRI: You're insane.

FROST: Most oracles are. They see the future and the knowledge ends up destroying them.

At the train station, where Dyson wants to meet Mark, the FBI is ready with a team, including Janis (Christine Woods) in the van watching everything over CCTV monitors. Dyson never shows, sending a kid to Mark instead to hand him a backpack. In the backpack is a photo of Demetri and a mobile phone. Mark talks to Dyson on the phone where the team can't hear it and sends Mark running, threatening to kill Demetri if he fails any of the tasks Dyson orders. Mark is instructed to slip out of the train station, lose his gun and mobile phone, and pick up a rental car in the lot. Mark drives off, leaving the team behind with only the words ""Figueroa"" and ""Pico"" to go on, which are phony clues. Dyson sends him out to the Antelope Valley. He tells Mark to walk one mile north into the Tehachapi Mountains for one mile.

Hertzog's hearing was a phony setup for her to escape, and the only new thing she tells Zoey is that they find Demetri's body in Building 7. Anothger clue was provided when an autopsy was done on the homeless man Dyson shot. He wasn't a homeless man; he was hiding out. He possessed the phone that texted Olivia about Mark's drinking during his flashforward, and the advanced hippocampus on him suggested the kind of intelligence ""savants"" have, which might include mathematical skills or photographic memory. Agent Vreede (Barry Shabaka Henley) had a box of items of the man that he wanted Olivia to go through that might lead to a clue concerning Demetri.

With 90 minutes to go, Mark meets Dyson Frost. ""So here we are again, Mark. Time for you and me to save the world."" And Dyson's first thought is to aim a gun at Mark. Dyson's associates wanted Mark dead long ago. But Dyson wanted to see it all the way through. Mark takes a drink of water from his bottle...and spits it in Dyson's face. It was actually gasoline from the car's tank, and Mark takes the gun, demanding to know where Demetri was. Dyson says he already told Charlie everything. He is slowly losing it and begs Mark to listen. Dyson notices someone followed him here...Alda Hertzog, who takes out Frost with a sniper rifle. Frost dies before he can tell Mark anything, but a series of pictures in his briefcase might lead to clues.

With 43 minutes to go, Mark gets in Dyson's car and, remembering what Vreede said about the picture given to him being by Ingres, he finds an address in the GPS with the same name. Without mobile phone service, Mark takes off and finds the address to be an old Army depot. With three minutes to go, he is able to contact Wedeck. Zoey tells him Building 7, but none of the buildings are marked. Janis checks the satellite image on the computer and finds the numbers on the rooftops. He finds Demetri and tries to mess with the rig. The only option is to force the aim of the gun away from Demetri when the clock hits zero. Six minutes of commercials later, Mark remembers that Dyson told Charlie about his favorite Seuss story: One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Mark guesses that's the sequence to pull the wires. He tries it...the gun goes off...and misses Demetri. Safe from the gun, Demetri gets up, which sends jets of water to wipe out all of Dyson's writings on the Garden of Forking Paths.

MARK: Even in death, he manages to screw us.

Or does he? While investigating how the address book of a doctor got into the belongings of the man Dyson shot, another man, Gabriel, tells Olivia he's seen her order the same coffee hundreds of times in line...even though Olivia has never been there before. Gabriel's friend told him about this, only he's dead now. The same friend who texted Olivia. And Mark did remember one thing from the Garden of Forking Paths before the data was washed clean: December 12, 2016...""The End."""
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1618600/?ref_=ttep_ep18,,Aaron infiltrates an Afghan village to find Tracy. Olivia finds a person who had several flashforwards.

She hated being a lawyer, and the concept of being part of something and doing some good had its appeal. Certainly she made a friend in Demetri Noh (John Cho), who helped her get through the tougher parts of training, especially the 6-mile obstacle course with yellow painted rocks to mark the trail: the ""Yellow Brick Road."" We see her talking to a woman two years before the blackout. It looks like she's on a date, but the woman, Lita, is actually a headhunter looking for some talent. Janis says she already has a job, but the woman thinks she can have a second job.

As Mark (Joseph Fiennes), Vreede (Barry Shabaka Henley), Vogel (Michael Ealy), and Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) pour over the information that Dyson Frost was carrying, still upset the woman who killed Frost was in their custody merely hours before, Olivia (Sonya Walger) has a visitor at her house: Gabriel (James Callis). She is going to get the FBI agent guarding her place, but Gabriel is insistent (in his condition) about telling her things, such as a drink she supposed spilled on someone and that he tried to tell her to be with Lloyd (Jack Davenport), not Mark. As she runs to get the agent, Gabriel warns her ""not to buy coffee from the guy who looks like Mr. Clean."" Had she arrived at the hospital 10 minutes sooner, she would have bought that coffee...and been killed by an out-of-control taxi.

As we see Janis being set up with her dropoff point for information two years ago...a pet store...she talks to Mark in the present about the documents Frost had, indicating Alda Hertzog's fingerprints were also on them. Mark theorizes the two must have met at some earlier point (which we saw in last week's ep). Soil traces were also detected on the documents, which Janis said originated in Afghanistan. She takes the blueprints to an antiquities professor, who theorizes they could be some sort of ancient timekeeping systm. She leaves a copy for him to study. However, the pet store owner orders her to retrieve the original blueprint and destroy all copies. She does so at the Dr. Cory's office, destroying the computer files of them in the process, but when she goes to Mark's Mosaic bulletin board to get the copy from there, he catches her.

She tries to cover for herself, but Mark isn't buying it. He lets her go...so she thinks...and pretends to think all is well. Ironically, the pressure is building, and Janis goes to the doctor for an ultrasound. The doctor tells her to get more sleep, eat a better diet, and most importantly, scale back on the job.

Janis' late-night soujourn turns out to be all for nothing. Dr. Cory took pictures with his mobile phone as a backup and tells Mark that the plans were for some sort of astronomical clock. He crunched the numbers and came up with the date October 6, 2009...the day of the blackout. We return to that day and we see more of Janis' flashforward, where she was being warned about the same thing the doctor just told her. When she comes to, she realized what she had gotten into and goes to Carline, the owner of the pet store. She wants to quit, but Carline doesn't give her that option.

In Kandahar, Afghanistan, Aaron (Brían F. O'Byrne) is trying to keep a low profile, but a contact sent by Wedeck confronts him and tells him he's sticking out like a sore thumb. So much so that someone in the cafe is calling in someone to kidnap him right now. Aaron is not happy, but he acquieses. Aaron tells Malik about Tracy and tells him about some of the people he saw in his flashforward and the doctor who was with her. Malik tells him he knows how to find that doctor.

They drive through the night. Aaron asks him about his flashforward, but Malik angrilly told him it didn't matter, since he lost his wife and daughter during the blackout, and he didn't care about the future. His was a short one as a convoy from a group he didn't recognize opens fire on the car, killing him. Aaron holds out until another group attacks them. This group is led by Dr. Khamir, who recognizes Aaron from his own flashforward.

At the hospital, Olivia talks to Vreede, because she discovered everything Gabriel told her was true, such as spilling the drink, and being at her wedding. Gabriel also brought up Raven River, which Vreede confirms was mentioned by the other man that Frost had killed. Raven River could refer to a psych hospital in Arizona, which was shut down back in the 80's under suspicious circumstances. They were the first hospital to deal with autism. They drive to the abandoned facility and Olivia runs into Gabriel, who knew she was coming. Gabriel tells them that he saw the car accident and that she should have been with Lloyd. Gabriel says ""this is where they did it."" Specifically ""the experiments."" The residents were put to sleep every other day and were sent on trips. Sometimes it was a long trip, sometimes it was a short one. But Dyson was always watching Gabriel and the others.

GABRIEL: He told us we were special because we could remember things. We could remember everything.

It's obvious that Frost needed them to go through flashforwards and write down everything they remembered, which would be, literally, everything. Gabriel then told them that Frost ordered all of them killed, and Vreede told him that Frost was dead. But why come after Olivia? Because Gabriel always saw Olivia in his flashforwards. But every time, she was always with Lloyd.

GABRIEL: You're a piece of the puzzle! They can't go on without you!

Janis tells Mark she is pregnant. She apologizes for her lax professionalism of late, and asks Mark about Frost's last words to him. (""In the end, you'll be saved by the lady you see every day."") It turns out the lady was the chess piece they confiscated back in Utah. Inside of it was a QED ring.

Back at the FBI, Mark shows the QED (Quantum Entanglement Device) ring to Wedeck, Lloyd, and Simon Campos (Dominic Monaghan). He shows the tape of the baseball game in Detroit, where Suspect Zero was wearing the same ring. Simon explains what the ring is. It keeps the wearer of the ring from blacking out and keeping their minds from moving forward during the amplification of Simon's and Lloyd's linear accelerator to crazy levels that send everybody else's minds forward. Mark and Wedeck theorize that the men who supposedly attacked Mark on the 29th were actually after the QED.

Back to two years ago, Janis Hawk met with Agent Vogel. Vogel warns her she is a potential target for recruitment by enemy agencies. She denies it, but Vogel really wants her to play up that role. The CIA is suspicious of something that might happen, which ""would make 9/11 look like a fender bender."" Vogel needs someone on the inside. Vogel wants Hawk to be a double-agent, because they suspect that a group may try to recruit Janis. Vogel asks her if she can do it. Sure enough, the organization that recruited Janis now wants her to steal the QED ring from the FBI's vault to make up for not following Mark to Frost or destroying the plans quickly enough.

JANIS: I would not make a third mistake, Janis. This is where you prove your loyalty to the cause.

But the ring is only part of the assignment. Carline wants Janis to kill Mark."

Lloyd Simcoe (Jack Davenport) and Simon Campos (Dominic Monaghan) prepare for the experiment where they simulate the Big Bang Theory. Lloyd is optimistic to find out what all of their hard work was for, but Simon is cautious. He receives a call from his mother that his father died. Simon goes to Toronto for the funeral (and other business), while Lloyd conducts the experiment. We see the plasma wakefield spread across the Earth...and run into another one. At that point, the blackouts occur.

PRESENT DAY - APRIL 22, 2010

Lloyd goes on an interview program to discuss what happened back on October 6th. He explains the visions of the future are not set in stone and are flexible, but ""the future has a way of fighting back."" The interviewer badgers him until Lloyd admits that the universe may make those futures happen regardless of what people do to stop them, like Al Gough did by committing suicide to save the life of Celia Quinones. Celia was one of the ""statistical anomalies"" that Dr. Simcoe theorized. After all, Celia was still alive.

Mark (Joseph Fiennes) and Demetri (John Cho) are watching Simcoe but are keeping the possibility of another blackout on the QT to avoid panics and rioting. Simon watches it as well, but he is interrupted by seeing his sister, Annabelle. She can't go with him, if the half-dozen laser sights aimed at her are any indication. Her captors want the QED ring back in 12 hours.

As Simon has someone at the FBI run the license plate of the van watching his sister and Bryce (Zachary Knighton) takes another round of chemo at the hospital, Demetri meets up with MI-6 Agent Fiona Banks, who is investigating the fourth murder in Los Angeles of someone who lived past their original date of death. In the case of a man who was supposed to die of a severe allergy on March 2nd, someone laced his coffee with rat poison. This was in spite of the fact the man had enough guns to make the NRA drool. Finding a flyer of the ""Blue Hands"" mob, the people who never had flashforwards because they were dead, confirms for the two of them that someone is trying to make sure these people meet their fates.

Mark confronts Simon about the license plate, because it costs more than a weekend at the Bunny Ranch to run a plate. Simon tries to hold back information from Mark, but Mark keeps calling BS on him since he has the actual meet between Simon and his sister on traffic cam. He doesn't want to do it, but after talking with Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance), Mark agrees to help Simon retrieve his sister before the deadline.

Demetri and Banks seek out Slingerland, the man whom they questioned earlier about the Blue Hands. He's back teaching history. He remembers Andy Weeks, the man who was poisoned. Unlike last time, Slingerland is very helpful, especially when Demetri and Banks tell him about the person murdering those who live past their deaths...like him.

Olivia (Sonya Walger) is treating Gabriel (James Callis) at the hospital for infections he received where they found him. Lloyd is there, and Gabriel is adamant that Lloyd and Olivia are together. (""Olivia and Lloyd, sittin' in a tree..."") Agent Vreede (Barry Shabaka Henley) asks Gabriel about one of the pictures in a notebook Gabriel had. Gabriel saw it in one of his flashfowards. It was Mark's Mosaic bulletin board.

Bryce finds out wonderful news: his cancer is in complete remission. He'll love the news Nicole (Peyton List) found out even more: she located Keiko, the woman in his flashforward. However, when Bryce goes to tell her about his news...and lays quite a kiss on her...he wants to forget out his vision and live in the moment...with Nicole. Suddenly she starts to question whether she should tell him about Keiko.

Demetri and Banks' investigation led to the coffee shop where Andy Weeks bought his coffee with a tall, geeky-looking guy who wore a horseshoe ring: Slingerland. They return to the high school, and he high-tails it out of there. Slingerland plans to do more than escape. He tries to course-correct the person who advertised cheating death: Celia. Demetri figures this out and goes to find her. He rams his car into Slingerland's before Slingerland can run over Celia. Slingerland will not be denied and chases after Celia. Demetri shoots Slingerland...and Celia gets hit by a car driven by Agent Banks. Demetri collars Slingerland.

SLINGERLAND: It's not me. It's the universe. Which never fails. It's funny. I was supposed to have an aneurysm, but you shoot me instead. It's done either way. See you soon, sport.

Back at the FBI office, Demetri is consoling Banks about running over Celia, but she remembers back to what Agent Gough suggested about the bird that hit the window in their respective visions. He suggested taping the window so the bird misses it, but Banks figured the bird would find another window. Banks gets a call from the hospital, and Celia is not expected to survive. She is devastated.

Mark tracks down the area where the van may be hidden. Simon wants to go with, but Mark has no tolerance for it because Simon has been lying to him since the beginning. Mark vows to find Annabelle and sit down with Simon right afterwards to get the truth. Mark holds up his part of the plan, locating Annabelle in an abandoned warehouse, and Simon runs after stealing the QED ring from the FBI vault.

Mark goes to Lloyd's house to tell him about Simon's disappearance. However, Olivia was over there to show him that the brain scans of people during the flashforwards were normal. Thus, he wasn't lying in his interview. Off the record, he asked her about them being together, since Gabriel was so convinced of it. Olivia certainly looked happy that they were, and they share a kiss. She goes, and Lloyd tells Mark that Simon went back for his father's funeral. What we didn't know was that Simon insisted the experiment take place at the original time, even though it could have been easily delayed.

MARK: Is Simon Campos capable of causing a global blackout.

LLOYD: Simon Campos is capable of anything. And he always has a plan.

Sure enough, the FBI confirms that Suspect Zero is Simon's size, and that a Canadian G-4 plane made an emergency maintenance landing in Detroit on October 6th, meaning no flight plans or passenger lists were needed. Simon Campos is Suspect Zero.

Mark immediately goes to talk to Annabelle, who tries to cover for Simon. Eventually, she tells Mark something she overheard from her captors.

ANNABELLE: They said he's going to cause another blackout."

FBI Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) addresses his agents...

WEDECK: On October 6th, the planet blacked out for two minutes and seventeen seconds. The world saw the future. Some of us were alarmed by what they saw. Others were elated and rejoiced. Still others saw nothing at all, and they were left confused, concerned, and otherwise, uncertain. But that uncertainty will soon be resolved. Tomorrow is D-Day, the day we catch up to the flashforwards. Our future, both as individuals and as a collective, is upon us. This building may very well come under attack tomorrow night. But we WILL NOT back down. We are the FBI, and we will be open for business.

Wedeck makes the assignments, and Mark (Joseph Fiennes) and Demetri (John Cho) will lead SWAT and sniper teams to protect the exterior. Before that happens, a few things start hitting the fan, first and foremost is that the tape of Simon (Dominic Monaghan) walking around at the baseball stadium in Detroit during the blackout is made public. It isn't the same video the FBI has, which means someone else had footage. Who was it, and more importantly to Mark and CIA Agent Vogel (Michael Ealy), why release it now?

The FBI is hell-bent on finding Simon, but it appears the lady who recruited Janis Hawk to spy on the FBI for them is quite the recruiter. She finds Simon and takes him out of the bar where he was hiding. Vogel meets with Janis separately, and she tells Vogel about Carline's order to kill Mark Benford. Vogel tells her she can't refuse Carline, or they'll just get someone else to do it and kill her. She doesn't want to kill Mark, but Vogel can't think of other alternatives. But he wants her to go through with it because they were so close. Janis tells him they want something big, and Vogel tells her to give them exactly that.

Olivia (Sonya Walger) and Gabriel (James Callis) come to the FBI office, where Gabriel wants to talk with Mark about his Mosaic bulletin board. More accurately, the things that are different on the real board than what he wrote in his notebook. Needless to say, it's a bit awkward between Olivia and Mark with Gabriel insisting she's supposed to be with Lloyd Simcoe, but they muddle through. Mark is fascinated by Gabriel's notebook and wants to study it.

As Zoey (Gabrielle Union) insisted on Demetri going with her to Hawaii, Demetri talks to Janis about her baby, and how he wants to be involved. Understandable, given that he's the father. She doesn't want him involved, but he insists. She tells him he's been given a second chance by defeating his death date, and he should make the most of it with Zoey.

Lita takes Simon to a hotel and ""occupies"" his time so Hellinger, the man in charge, has enough time to get there. Simon wants out, but both Lita and Hellinger insist he's not done working for them yet. Hellinger was an important part of the experiment, as Gabriel had a drawing of him in his notebook. He also knew about Udaya and the man Frost shot in the homeless shelter, as they were at Raven River with him. Gabriel gets spooked when he sees Demetri, because he insists that Demetri can't be alive if everything is to work out right. Gabriel also insists Lloyd Simcoe (Jack Davenport), who arrives at the FBI, to do the math and figure out the equation. Lloyd is wondering if Gabriel might have seen some of the equation he's been trying to figure out in one of his flashforwards.

Hellinger insists that Simon return home, but Simon still refuses. Hellinger points out he's a fugitive and his work is ruined, but Simon still won't bite. Hellinger gives him the full carrot/stick treatment, reminding Simon he has family out there. He leaves Hellinger and Lita behind. As Mark puts the drawing of Hellinger out in public, Demetri is worried that so many people want the future to happen as is, meaning Demetri has to die tomorrow. Mark doesn't believe Demetri should worry.

MARK: You're screwing a lot of things up, but the universe isn't one of them.

Wedeck contacts Aaron (Brían F. O'Byrne), who found exactly what Wedeck wanted: a Jericho camp, one of several in Afghanistan. They do the ""dirty work"" the U.S. government can't do, including no-holds-barred torture. Aaron sends Wedeck the incriminating evidence, and Aaron is ready to go in and get his daughter, over Wedeck's protests. Two guards drag an unconscious Tracy (Genevieve Padalecki) into a truck, and it is on. They plan to bury her, but Aaron takes out the two soldiers sniper-style. He grabs Tracy and tries to find shelter. He then insists they drive back to Kandahar. They are able to find the shelter that Aaron and Tracy both saw in their flashforwards.

Janis is stalling with Carline, and she applies pressure, specifically to the health and well-being of Janis' baby. Janis tells her about Gabriel, whom Carline already knew. Carline decides that Janis can bring Gabriel to her. Janis is able to set up the safehouse trip, but Gabriel won't go unless Olivia goes with him. Mark asks him if Olivia will be OK in the futures he saw. Gabriel assures him that she will be.

As Wedeck gives President Segovia (Peter Coyote) a chance to come clean about the photos of Joshua Base that Aaron took...and forces Wedeck to send them to Vice-President Clemente, Mark, Demetri, and a team prepare to move Gabriel to the safehouse. Janis rats out the plan to her bosses, getting a long look at herself in the mirror in the process. They are pinned by two cars with automatic weapons. One tiny problem: Mark was playing the role of Gabriel and they capture the entire group. They go to Hellinger, with Mark still pretending to be Gabriel. Hellinger is barely able to delete the work files on his computer before he and an entire warehouse of employees are arrested. Mark is ready to go Jack Bauer on Hellinger to locate Simon. Campos is sneaking away somewhere else and still has the QED ring with him.

Mark goes back to Janis and demands answers. Janis admits her involvement with the CIA and being recruited by Vogel. It turns out that Mark knew she was a double-agent already. In fact, Janis and Vogel were the ones to tip Wedeck and Mark about the planned ambush of Gabriel. She confesses that they ordered her to kill Mark. She tries to play the sympathy card, being played by the CIA and the bad guys, but Mark doesn't give a rat's ***. She begs him at least not to tell Demetri; she'll do that herself. And she did. She thought she could get away clean, and getting pregnant was a means to do that. Demetri is upset, to put it mildly. Janis insists there is no connection, but Demetri can't leave it that way. She goes home, where Simon finds her and asks for her help while pointing a gun at her.

Demetri goes to visit Gabriel in the rundown motel he was in. He asks Gabriel if he ever saw him alive in any of his futures. Gabriel didn't. The paths may be different, ""but everybody is ending up where they're supposed to be."""

Charlie wakes up in the middle of the night screaming and crying. Olivia (Sonya Walger) goes to comfort her from her bad dream.

CHARLIE: Today's the day. Today's the day Daddy's going to die.

Olivia needs comforting herself.

April 29, 2010 - 7:26 AM

Simon Campos (Dominic Monaghan) and Janis Hawk (Christine Woods) are discussing his safety and the fact that he wants to take down the people responsible for the global blackout. It would only be a matter of time before everyone knows he was the one who was awake in Detroit. Having Hellinger (Neil Jackson) in custody isn't enough. He volunteers looking through the software in the mainframe to find anything wrong, since he was the one to drop the software in on October 6th in the first place. But he wants Janis...and Janis alone...to help him. In exchange, he would turn himself in.

April 29, 2010 - 8:11 AM

Mark (Joseph Fiennes) and Demetri (John Cho) have a lot of work to do today, but Mark wants him to head to Hawaii and get married. He even provides him with a CD of ""Islands in the Stream,"" and 14 other versions of that song. Demetri wants to hide behind work, but Mark insists he should go to Hawaii and marry her.

MARK: Even with the way everything went down, even though I lost her, marrying Olivia was the best thing I ever did. Don't be afraid, especially on a day like this.

Speaking of Olivia, Lloyd (Jack Davenport) calls her and tries to talk about tonight. She's in full denial and doesn't want to talk to him. Lloyd is at the FBI, where Agent Vogel (Michael Ealy) tells Mark that Hellinger invested in dot-com businesses in the 90's and real estate in the 2000's with the classic ""buy low, sell high"" strategy, so money wasn't a problem. Vogel theorizes they used the flashforwards to earn their capital. As they contemplate the ramifications of seeing the future, Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) tells them that Hellinger will only speak to Mark.

Hellinger needs to discuss a matter concerning Mark so important he spills that he caused the blackouts. He draws in Gabriel's book the pathways this particular day took. It started with him in the FBI room as he was now. But every different version of April 29th ended the same way: Mark attacked Hellinger for not getting the answers, and Mark will be killed in his office. Mark is more interested in finding out if another blackout will occur than preserving his life, which he could do by releasing Hellinger. But in the diagram, Mark finds a clue that he thinks will lead him to the next step. He takes the notebook with him.

April 29, 2010 - 9:10 AM

Mark consults with Lloyd about a symbol Hellinger wrote on the notebook that was also in Dyson Frost's blueprints. The symbol is for a tachyon, and Hellinger wrote the word ""wipe"" next to it. Lloyd says a tachyon wipe doesn't make any sense, but Mark is convinced this is the group's next step and he wants to get ahead of them.

Nicole (Peyton List) visits Bryce (Zachary Knighton), and he's interested in a date with her tonight. She sees a drawing Bryce made of her, one page after the drawing of Keiko. Nicole is concerned, but Bryce figures he'll never meet Keiko by the time the day was done. Nicole is not so certain, especially since Keiko is in the detention center and may try to raise her bail money so she can meet Bryce.

Demetri meets Zoey (Gabrielle Union) at the airport, who is excited about going to Hawaii. But Demetri is getting cold feet...about leaving the job on D-Day. Or perhaps he has a guilty conscience, because he confesses to Zoey that he got Janis pregnant in Somalia. He did it because he thought he was going to die then and he wanted Janis future fulfilled. She can't believe she moved heaven and earth because she thought he would live and he didn't think the same thing. She leaves for Hawaii without him. He goes to Janis' apartment and runs right into Campos.

Mark figures out that the tachyon is Tachyon Offsite Information Systems, a data warehouse company in Arcadia. Mark thinks Hellinger wants to wipe the information out of the warehouse, but Wedeck and Vogel don't think Hellinger would be so stupid as to give Mark such an obvious clue. Vogel orders Mark to continue interrogating Hellinger, and Wedeck cuts off any protest by Mark.

Aaron (Brían F. O'Byrne) and Tracy (Genevieve Padalecki) bunker down in Afghanistan, although Tracy needs better medical attention than Khamir can provide. Aaron goes to work on his captured Jericho guard, giving him a taste of his own torture. The man tells Aaron that Tracy didn't see Jericho kill an entire village; they were passed out. The ""experiment"" for the global blackout had a radius of 1 kilometer, and Tracy was inside that range. Only, she didn't pass out with everybody else. And Jericho needed to know why.

April 29, 2010 - 1:34 PM

Demetri can't believe Janis is taking Simon to NLAP to work on the same computers that triggered the original blackout. Janis gets between the two pointed guns...and disarms Simon. She hands him over to Demetri to take to the FBI. At the FBI, Mark and Vogel hear the raid done by a strike team on the data warehouse. It was a trap, and the team is killed. Hellinger looks on with a smug look on his face, and Mark is ready to go the full Jack Bauer on him, but Wedeck...and a visit from Olivia and Charlie...stop him. Mark talks to his daughter while she looks at the Mosaic board. He tells her not to be afraid because Mommy and Daddy love her. He does the same thing when he has to fight the bad guys.

April 29, 2010 - 3:37 PM

Janis asks to be dropped off because she wants to walk away from everything and doesn't want Demetri to cover for her with the FBI. He drives away and then comes back to take Janis and Simon to NLAP.

Lloyd Simcoe is at home with Dylan with documents all over the carpet. Dylan starts rearranging the pages, saying everything has to be in the right place. Naturally, Lloyd is upset, but Dylan's got the right idea. Dylan's putting all of the numbers together, just like Gabriel told him.

Mark goes back to interrogating Hellinger, and Hellinger doesn't want to tell him anything because Mark doesn't care about his marriage, his life, nothing but that ""scrapbook of your failures"" that is the Mosaic bulletin board Mark keeps staring at.

HELLINGER: But there is an upside. This is going to sound harsher than it is. Deep down, you know what I mean. You're going to die, but your daughter's going to be better off when you're gone.

Mark loses it and beats the crap out of Hellinger. Several agents drag him out kicking and screaming, and Wedeck has them throw Mark out of the building.

April 29, 2010 - 4:17 PM

Nicole is definitely not enthused about the fireworks display Bryce wants to take her to this evening. She kept thinking about her flashforward where she was drowning and felt like she deserved it. She confessed to Bryce that she knew Keiko was in L.A. He's upset with Nicole for letting Keiko stay in the detention center. But if he wanted to get her, Keiko's mother beats him to it. She is taking Keiko back to Japan, but Keiko insists on being at the sushi restaurant at 10 to make her flashforward come true.

In Afghanistan, Tracy is in grave danger. Khamir begins to perform CPR on her. Aaron won't give up, but it is too late. Tracy is dead.

April 29, 2010 - 6:38 PM

L.A. is in full celebration for the moment of the flashforward, but Mark is in no mood to celebrate with everyone else. Mark goes over everything in his head. But a man who had quit drinking in his flashforward handed his flask to Mark. The same flask Mark was drinking from in the FBI office during his flashforward. He is overwhelmed by the fact that his future is coming true, anyway and starts drinking. (He was loaded, OKAY?!?!?)

April 29, 2010 - 6:46 PM

Janis and Demetri drive to Palo Alto. Demetri confessed he lost his best friend since he found out she was a double-agent. But driving Campos to NLAP sounded so much like the Janis he knew that he had to go back. He also told Janis he confessed to Zoey about the baby. She was in some pain, perhaps caused by her takedown of Campos earlier in the day.

Mark finds a bar and starts getting loaded. A patron comments on his string and comments that he was talking to Mark in his vision. Mark, of course, knows he's lying, but the patron insists he was in the vision. He's fighting fate, and Mark's already lost. And Mark beats up a second person, only the other patrons hep the guy out. Mark ends up in jail.

Lloyd calls Olivia, who decided to take off and make sure she wasn't at the house at 10PM. He was and insisted Olivia come back. Dylan comments that they weren't coming back.

And everyone awaits the final 3 hours."

We see the cast at various locations. Mark (Joseph Fiennes) is in jail, Olivia (Sonya Walger) takes Charlie to the beach to watch the fireworks, and Nicole (Peyton List) sits alone staring at Bryce's (Zachary Knighton) drawing of Keiko, while Bryce goes to the L.A. County Detention Facility to find her. Keiko's mother has already bailed her out and is taking her to the airport, against her wishes. Bryce convinces the guard (re: $$$) to tell him where she went. Demetri Noh (John Cho), Janis (Christine Woods), and Simon Campos (Dominic Monaghan) make it to NLAP in Palo Alto, where Simon will try to retrieve the software Hellinger's people put in the computer systems there. Demetri is not exactly enamored of following Simon's plans, and Janis is in pain from earlier. But both agree to play it out. Aaron (Brían F. O'Byrne) and Khamir are still in shock over Tracy's (Genevieve Padalecki) death, but Aaron won't be swayed. They check her again, and her pulse is very faint, but there.

April 29, 2010 - 9:02 PM

Wedeck (Courtney B. Vance) bails Mark out of jail because he feels partly-responsible for not keeping an eye on Mark and worrying too much about the next blackout. But now they have to worry about bombs inside the FBI office, and they rush back. Olivia and Charlie stay at the beach, but Lloyd Simcoe (Jack Davenport) and Dylan find them. Lloyd insists that Olivia come back with him to her house so he can figure out the missing parts of the formula. Olivia doesn't want to do it, but Lloyd says she's part of it and that Gabriel was right.

Bryce got the number of the sushi restaurant in L.A. from the guard at the detention facility and heads there. Nicole apologizes, but Bryce tells her that he's sorry to try to be with Nicole when fate seems to be in control. He was even wearing the same clothing he had in his flashforward without realizing it. And fate would appear to want them together, as Keiko's mother changes her mind at LAX and gets herself arrested to distract the security making sure Keiko went on the plane. Keiko slips out and heads to the restaurant.

Mark and Wedeck make it back to the FBI, but Wedeck wants him to stay in the car. He has Mark talk to Aaron, and Mark admits that he was drinking and let himself get too wrapped up in his revenge on Hellinger. Aaron reminds him that there are always decisions that can still be made. Mark makes one: he goes up to the office where his Mosaic board is. Hellinger doesn't like this, and likes the fact that he can't rile Mark even less. Fortunately, several bomb squad officers are on his payroll, and Hellinger sends them up after Mark.

April 29, 2010 - 9:32 PM

As Olivia, Lloyd, and their kids reach her house, Demetri and Simon have gotten into NLAP by having Janis fake her real pains to the guard and clone his RFID card. Janis ends up at the hospital, where she finds the woman who was giving her an ultrasound in her flashforward, and they immediately schedule one, since Janis hasn't felt the baby kick in three hours. Demetri still doesn't trust Simon, but Simon gives Demetri the QED ring as an act of good faith. Mark runs into Vogel as he goes in the building. Vogel (Michael Ealy) confirms that there were bombs set to go off in the building around 10:10 PM. Vogel promises to watch Lloyd and Olivia, just like he was doing in his flashforward. But he tells Mark he told another agent Mark was dead in his flashforward.

Olivia and Lloyd go upstairs to discover the formula written in lipstick on the mirror. Except it was Dylan who wrote it, not Lloyd. They theorized Dylan must have memorized the formula earlier that day. Lloyd tells Olivia that the formula links the QED, the blueprints, and the flashforwards. Lloyd needs to solve the Tachyon Constant and solve it right now. She reassures him the answers will come at 10 PM...because they will.

OLIVIA: It's not about the equations. It's not about us being physically here. It's about...this moment. I've fought it, I've resisted it, and yet here it is. The future happened.

They kiss.

As Mark goes in the building, Hellinger's team kills the real bomb squad platoon and dons masks to go inside. Vreede (Barry Shabaka Henley) tells Wedeck that Mark went in, and both go into the building to find him. They split up as they hear the gunfire of Hellinger's team. Bryce makes it to the restaurant, Keiko has to run because she gets caught in traffic, and an upset Nicole is almost hit on the road and swerves into a lake.

April 29, 2010 - 9:55 PM

It's New Year's Eve in L.A., but Simon can't find the software thus far. He did remember he sent Lloyd a text in his flashforward and proceeds to do so. The text he sends contains a formula Lloyd called his ""tearful goodbye,"" an old .sig file he used on his messages.

April 29, 2010 - 10:00 PM

Los Angeles celbrates. Keiko makes it to the restaurant. Nicole is drowning, but someone pulls her out, who knew he would do that in his flashforward. Janis finds out her baby is healthy, but a boy instead of a girl. Tracy wakes up in Afghanistan. Lloyd receives Simon's message with the formula. It was a single-wave formula that helps Lloyd crack the puzzle. The next blackout was to be in April, 2010. Within the next two days. Lloyd immediately calls Mark and relays this information. Mark studies the board as Vreede and Wedeck are in a firefight to keep Hellinger's men away from him. Mark discovers the strings are in the wrong places, and Mark uses Gabriel's notebook to reorganize it. The pushpins are at different letters.

T-E-N-F-O-U-R-T-E-E-N-P-M. The blackout will be in 12 minutes.

Simon figures out that Hellinger tried to clone the servers at NLAP because he knew Simon would try exactly what he was doing. He bypasses their fake system and back-doors his way in to find the necessary software to stop Hellinger. He gives the software to Demetri. But their victory is short-lived. Someone bypasses the system and starts the accelerator. Demetri thinks Simon screwed him, but Simon insists that he's trying to shut the thing down and tells Demetri to shoot him or let him do his work.

Olivia overhears Vogel say that Mark is dead. ""He ran into the building. He doesn't have a chance."" But in the building, Mark is still alive, although Hellinger's team is moving in on him. A mobile phone rings, and the team gives Mark's office and the Mosaic board the full Tony Montana treatment. Mark comes out of the air conditioning vent, breaks the neck of one of Hellinger's men and uses him as a shield to get out of the office. He goes John McClane on the rest of the squad. However, he has 8 minutes to get out. Wedeck takes out the man following him. Mark sends the elevator up, and Hellinger's men open fire on it. However, it was a diversion and Mark takes out three more with a shotgun. He calls Wedeck to relay the information about the next blackout and tells him to call every agency to get ready for it. Mark only has three minutes to exit, and there are still several men after him. Mark calls Olivia to tell her to find someplace safe and that he loves her. Mark shoots the man who came after him and find a shortcut out of the building: a helicopter hovering just outside.

As Mark is about to leap out of the window, Simon is unable to prevent the accelerator from activating, and Demetri refused to wear the QED. The world blacked out once again, although they had a slight warning of preparation this time. We see images from around the world and a flashforward to 2015. Janis' son is alive and well, several babies are baptized, and an older Charlie declares ""they found him"".

In the present, a kangaroo goes by, Lita wheels Janis out of the hospital while wearing a QED ring, and the FBI building explodes. We do not know what happened to Mark. Did they find him?"

With the house complete, Charles goes into town in search of obtaining seed and a plow. On his way to town, Charles stops to give aid to Doc Baker, whose carriage has a broken wheel. While getting a ride into town in the repaired carriage, Doc Baker explains word has gotten around town about Charles and his family, and explains the Ingalls will be a welcome addition to the town of Walnut Grove.

Without the means to pay, and unable to get credit at Olson's Mercantile, Charles seeks seed and a plow at the neighboring Feed and Seed. In exchange for free seed and a plow, Charles agrees to replace the roof of the Feed and Seed's warehouse, which had collapsed under the previous winter's snow, in addition to stacking dozens of sacks of grain once the roof work is completed. Concerned over Charles' ability to get the job done while splitting his time between the Feed and Seed and Hanson's Mill, Mr. O'Neill, the owner of the Feed and Seed, requires Charles to sign a chattel mortgage on his team of oxen. The oxen will revert to O'Neill if the work isn't completed within three weeks.

Working six hours at the Feed and Seed and six hours at the Mill each day has left Charles tired and in a foul mood, and without any time to spend with his family. To make it up to them, he agrees to take the family on an afternoon picnic. However, while attempting to get a stuck kite out of a tree, Charles falls from a great height and breaks several ribs. He's tended to back at the Ingalls farm and confined to his bed for two weeks.

With Charles unable to finish his work at the Feed and Seed, and with only a few hours left on the chattel mortgage deadline,, O'Neill pays a visit to the Ingalls farm and relieves Ma of the oxen despite her pleas for compassion. Charles, upon hearing of this, leaves his bed early and heads to town, determined to finish his work. Unbeknownst to Charles, Mary and Laura follow along behind him. Charles begins stacking the grain, but collapses soon thereafter due to his injuries. Mary and Laura attempt to step in for their father, but the task is simply too much for girls of their size.

Seeing the girls efforts, the men of the town stop what they're doing, make their way to the Feed and Seed, and pitch in to get the job done. Charles realizes that while he's new to Walnut Grove, he's already made some dear friends, and collects his oxen and heads back home with his girls."

Their mother Caroline Ingalls (Karen Grassle) complains to her husband Charles Ingalls (Michael Landon) about it, their lack of wealth being the main issue. When they hear that Laura pushed Nellie at the school playground after refusing to play to what Nellie insists, they advise patience. Caroline goes to town to sell some eggs. Mrs Oleson (Scottie MacGregor), the leading woman in town and Nellie's mother, pays Caroline half the price for all brown eggs, but sells them for the same price than white eggs.

Also, the girls buy their school tools, like boards and pens at Mr Oleson's (Richard Bull), who is a kind man. Caroline buys an expensive fabric to make herself a dress, which she can barely afford.

Time goes by. All parents visit the school to hear their children reading some compositions. Caroline uses the expensive fabric to make the girls new dresses.

Caroline Ingalls (Karen Grassle) decides to do her bit: she convinces all the farmer wives to pick up the loose shafts of corn and wheat which have survived the hailstorm. The rest are not convinced, but they finally start working on the plan. Laura and Mary (Melissa Gilbert and Melissa Sue Anderson) help their mother, learning what hard work is first hand.

When Laura tells that the mention of death in the song ""Go Tell Aunt Rhody"" makes her sad, Maddie explains that death should maybe be seen as a new beginning, and not an end.

It turns out Maddie is visiting, as a diversion to give Charles Ingalls some time to help Maddie's housemate Amy Hearn decorate the place for her surprise 80th Birthday Party. As they talk, Doc Baker stops by to deliver some mail for Maddie.

It turns out the letter is from Maddie's daughter Eliza, and upon reading it later, she grows sad that her daughter and family can't attend her party. Amy tries to cheer her friend up, but as she discusses her own children, she looks over and realizes Maddie has died.

A funeral follows shortly thereafter, attended by a number of the townsfolk, and Maddie's family who have come. Amy stands next to the Ingalls girls, and mentions how while people may miss birthdays, they almost always show up at a funeral to say goodbyes. Laura feels this is a backwards way of doing things, and feels funerals should happen while one is alive, so goodbyes can be said in person.

The Ingalls girls visit her over the next few days to give her some company, but shortly after Laura visits, she rushes into town to tell Charles that Amy is sick. Charles and Doc Baker rush to her residence, but Baker can't find anything wrong with her.

It is then that Amy asks the two men to promise to help her. She requests Charles be the one to make funeral and wake arrangements for her, and Doc Baker to contact her family to attend. Once they promise, Amy suddenly jumps out of bed, and the two realize they have been deceived! Amy tells that she wants a funeral and wake held on her birthday, and is doing this because she wants to see her own family (whom she hasn't seen in a number of years) before she really does go.

Charles shares the news with his family, but Caroline naturally finds the whole plan to be ridiculous. She goes to Amy's place to talk some sense into her, and returns having been talked into making a cake for the wake!

As part of the plan, Amy is snuck over to the Ingalls to stay, while her house is set up for the wake.

Things almost go awry when Father Gorman from Mankato shows up early to the Ingalls' place, but given he has no idea what Amy looks like, she claims to be a family friend of the deceased.

On the day of the birthday/wake, Amy dresses in black with a veil to disguise her presence. Naturally, she is overjoyed to see her daughter Bridget and her family show up, along with her son Sean.

As the wake goes on, she sneaks over near her children, listening in to their conversations, but grows surprised when her son Andy (whom she hadn't seen since he was a teenager) shows up!

Amy can't take it any longer, and finally reveals herself. Naturally, her children are shocked and upset, but she tells how desperate she was to see her family, and how she may not have many years left.

The family hugs and Charles pulls out his fiddle, turning the somber occasion into a party."

In the lower levels of Hawkins National Laboratory, a scientist in a lab coat runs down a dark hallway, frantically pushing buttons and trying to operate an elevator. When the elevator arrives, the man enters and is seemingly safe then suddenly something growls above him. Terror fills the man's face, his eyes widened. As the doors close, he is violently pulled upwards.

Meanwhile, four middle schoolers, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, and Will, play Dungeons & Dragons in Mike's basement. The four boys want to play a while longer, as they have just encountered the fearsome Demogorgon, but Mike's mother insists it's time for them to go home. While Will and Dustin are riding their bikes home, they decide to race so that if Will wins, he gets Dustin's X-Men #134. As Will pushes ahead, he rides onto ""Mirkwood"", a road near Hawkins Lab. He is frightened by a mysterious figure in the middle of the road and crashes his bike. Will hears something in the distance, which frightens him and sends him running home. But, the mysterious creature chases him. He tries to call for help, but the phone is not working. As the creature breaks in through his front door, Will runs and hides in a shed in the backyard of his house. He shakily loads a gun to fend off whatever is coming for him. The shed's dangling light bulb begins to flicker; a strange, guttural growl is heard, and Will vanishes.

Monday, November 7, 1983

The next morning, Will's mother, Joyce Byers, and his older brother, Jonathan Byers, are unable to find him. Joyce calls Mike's house to see if Will stayed there, but Karen tells her that he left the night before.

Meanwhile at Hawkins High School, Mike's sister, Nancy Wheeler, makes out with Steve Harrington in the bathroom. They make plans to meet up later.

Joyce hurries to the police station to talk to Chief Hopper, who she hopes can help her find her son. As Hawkins is a quiet town, Hopper questions Joyce's claims and doesn't take her too seriously. Hopper's first instinct is to question her ex-husband Lonnie, but Joyce insists that any potential involvement of his in Will's disappearance is unlikely - nonetheless, she agrees to call him.

At Hawkins Lab, a team of scientists, including Dr Brenner, suit up in protective suits before entering the quarantined underground subsystem. There, they find strange biologic growth spreading - originating from a mysterious fracture in the wall.

The school's principal and Chief Hopper interrupt to question them about Will's way home the previous night. He tells them to go straight home after school and to not go biking around looking for Will.

In a flashback scene, Joyce is in the woods at Castle Byers surprising Will with tickets to see Poltergeist. In the present, Joyce and Jonathan are at the fort, looking for Will.

Back at Benny's Burgers, Benny, showing some clarity despite her trying to steal from him, feeds the girl and attempts to make conversation, but she remains quiet. He realizes she has the digits ""011"" tattooed on her left forearm. When Benny asks about the number's meaning, the girl indicates that the number refers to herself. While she eats, Benny steps away to call social services; he thinks the girl has been abused. The girl becomes irritated by a noisy fan. She stares at it intensely, lowers her head and suddenly the music on the radio becomes heavily distorted and the fan jolts and stops. The girl relaxes and continues eating.

At Mirkwood, Hopper and his officers Powell and Callahan are on the road where Will crashed his bike. They find it tipped over and abandoned by the trees on the side of the road.

Joyce tries to call Lonnie, but is hung up on by his girlfriend, Cynthia. The cop shows up with Will's bike. Hopper looks around for clues and is drawn to the shed. The light flickers, and he is startled by Callahan entering the shed. He tells them they need to organise a search party.

Mike and his family sit at the dinner table. Mike wants to go look for Will, but his mother says no. Nancy asks her mother to go study at her friend Barb's house. She says that nobody leaves until Will is found. Nancy gets upset and during a fight with Mike he reveals her new boyfriend.

After finding Eleven in the woods, the boys bring her back to Mike's house for the night. Lucas thinks this is a terrible idea and suggests they all tell Mike's mom Karen Wheeler right away, but Mike points out, that would just get them all grounded, since they were not supposed to go looking for Will Byers. Mike gives her clean clothes to change into. He also nicknames her ""El"" and gives her a pillow fort to sleep in.

Tuesday, November 8, 1983

The next day, Mike brings her breakfast. He tries to get Eleven to sneak out of the house and to the front door to make it look like she stumbled upon the house and that way his mom can help. Eleven rejects his idea, telling Mike that ""bad people"" are looking for her and that revealing her whereabouts will only make things worse.

Meanwhile, Joyce talks to Chief Hopper about the creepy, static phone call she received. Hopper is reluctant to believe her story, but admits the charring on the phone from the surge of electricity is weird. Later, Joyce heads to her workplace to buy a new phone and demands two weeks' pay in advance from her boss. He shows some sympathy for Joyce after he realizes her kid is missing and gives in.

Back at Mike's house, Mike acquaints Eleven to his house, instead of going to school. Eleven notices a picture of the four boys and points at Will. She knows him, but before Mike can ask anymore questions, his mom comes home (Mike was supposed to be at school). Mike hides Eleven in his bedroom closet, which scares her. Mike promises that he won't tell his mother about her and Eleven trusts him enough to close the door. However, Mike explains the situation regarding El to Dustin and Lucas and her knowing about Will's disappearance and urges them to help her. Lucas, unconvinced, tries to tell Mike's mom about Eleven, but Eleven stops him, using her telekinetic abilities to close Mike's bedroom door. Lucas and Dustin begin to trust her too.

At night, Mike, bringing Lucas and Dustin to the basement, brings food for Eleven and asks her if she knows where their friend Will is. Eleven doesn't know what the word ""friend"" means so Mike explains it to her. Eleven then uses the Dungeons and Dragons set to show them Will is hiding from a monster. The cops find a drainpipe in the woods leading to Hawkins National Laboratory. They believe Will might have crawled through it.

Joyce receives another creepy, static call, surging with electricity and shocking her again. The lights in her house begin to turn one by one, leading to Will's bedroom. Suddenly, one wall begins to move and takes on some weird shapes. Joyce quickly runs out of the house and into her car, but later turns and goes back to the house.

At Steve's party, Nancy's friend, Barb, feels like a third wheel. Barb sits near the pool by herself. Jonathan hides in the woods near the pool and takes her picture before leaving. Jonathan fails to notice a mysterious monster as it abducts Barb."

Everything is dark and covered in vines. She calls for Nancy and then sees a monster in the pool. She tries to escape, but the monster catches hold of her. Meanwhile, Steve and Nancy are making out on Steve's bed. It is quite different from where Barb is, and there is water in the pool. Barb's voice can be heard echoing distantly, but she cannot be seen. Steve and Nancy make love as Barb is taken by the monster, screaming for help.

Joyce is talking to Will through the lamps. Jonathan tells her that the light flickering is due to faulty electricity, but Joyce is convinced that Will is there.

Mike, Dustin, and Lucas prepare to rescue Will. Dustin tells the others that Eleven is the best weapon they have because of her telekinetic powers. He asks her to make a toy Millennium Falcon fly, but she does nothing. Mike asks Eleven to meet them after school and gives her his watch. Later, while alone, Eleven is making the Falcon fly with her mind. She wanders around the house and turns on the television. This causes her to have a flashback to Hawkins Lab where she crushes a soda can with her mind as Dr. Brenner and the others observe her. Her nose bleeds, as it always does when she uses her powers. Brenner is pleased; Eleven seems upset.

Joyce takes out her Christmas lights and puts them up but realizes that she doesn't have enough and buys more at the general store where she works. Her boss is confused, but she tells him just to ring her up.

Hopper investigates at Hawkins Lab where an official tells him that Will could not have gotten in there. Hopper asks to see the security cameras and is shown footage of the night Will escaped. Hopper realizes that the officials are lying to him because it rained that night and there is no rain on the video.

Nancy sees that Barb is not at school and asks Steve, Tommy, and Carol if they saw her after the party at Steve's house. No one has seen her. While looking for rocks for their slingshots, the boys encounter Troy and James who tease them about Will and trip Mike, who scrapes his chin.

Karen Wheeler shows up at Joyce's house with a casserole as Joyce is finishing putting up all the Christmas lights. Karen is visibly confused by all the lights and Joyce tells her she put them up because Will loves Christmas. As the two women talk, Karen's young daughter Holly sees the lights blinking, and follows them. She sees a hand start to come through the wall, but Joyce discovers her and asks Karen and Holly to leave.

Hopper looks up Hawkins Lab at the library and finds articles about a woman who sued Brenner for kidnapping her daughter. Hopper starts to think that maybe Brenner is involved with Will's disappearance.

Jonathan develops the photos he took at Steve's party in the school's darkroom. A girl named Nicole sees the photos of Nancy. Nancy calls Barb's house and learns that Barb did not go home the night before and that her mother hasn't seen her. Steve, Tommy, Carol, and Nicole confront Jonathan about spying on them the previous night. They take his bag and tear up the photos. Nancy arrives and Steve takes and smashes Jonathan's camera. Nancy is visibly upset by this. She gathers the torn pieces of photos.

While waiting for the boys at the power lines, Eleven sees a cat, causing her to have a flashback to Hawkins Lab. Brenner and the other scientists seem to want her to do something to a cat, but she refuses, clearly upset. As punishment, they take Eleven into a cell as she kicks and screams for ""Papa"" (her name for Brenner). Before they can lock her in, she forces the door open with her mind and kills the two men. Brenner sees this, and seems intrigued, but not horrified. Eleven collapses and Brenner carries her away. Back in the present, the boys meet up with Eleven. She asks about what happened to Mike's chin and he tells her about the boys who tease him, calling them ""mouth breathers.""

Nancy goes back to Steve's house and finds Barb's car still there. She looks for Barb around the house and in the woods where she sees the monster that took Barb.

Joyce sees the Christmas lights illuminate along the wire going in one direction. They lead to a crawl space where Joyce is able to talk to Will with a tangle of lights. She asks him to blink the lights once for yes and two for no. She asks if he is alive and the lights blink once. She asks if he is safe and the lights blink twice. She paints the alphabet on the wall, tacking a light to each letter so that he can communicate more with her. She asks him where he is and the lights spell out ""right here."" Next, they spell out ""run."" The monster comes through the wall as Joyce runs in terror.

Thinking that Eleven can help them find Will, they ask her to lead them to him. She takes them to his house. Lucas gets upset. As they argue, sirens can be heard. They bike to the quarry where they see police drag a boy's body out of the water. Mike yells at Eleven for having deceived them about Will being alive and storms off."

She refuses to believe them, saying that she just talked to him. She tries to explain how Will communicates through the lights, but both Hopper and Jonathan dismiss her crazy sounding claims. Hopper sympathetically tells Joyce that he went through a similar type of grief when his daughter died, but Joyce insists that Will is not dead. Hopper leaves and Joyce gets an axe from the shed.

In his basement, Mike is looking through Will's drawings and Eleven is listening to static on his walkie talkie. He snaps at her to stop it and then yells at her for lying about Will being alive. Eleven continues to fiddle with the walkie talkie until they can hear Will's shaky voice singing ""Should I Stay or Should I Go.""

Jonathan wakes up Joyce (who fell asleep on the sofa with the axe) that they have to go to the morgue to identify Will's body. At the morgue, Joyce and Jonathan see the body through a window. Jonathan runs away, and Joyce yells at the coroner that whatever she is looking at is not her son's body. Hopper and Jonathan try to reason with her, but she refuses to identify the remains as Will's. Jonathan tells her that she can't fall apart and Joyce tells him she knows she sounds crazy but maintains that she heard Will talk to her.

Mike tells Karen that he doesn't think he can go to school and Karen doesn't fight him, letting him stay home alone. Once she is gone, he calls Lucas on the walkie talkie and tells him that he and Dustin need to meet with him. Lucas is skeptical, but agrees. At Mike's house, they listen to the walkie talkie but can't hear anything definite. They realize that they will need a better radio and will need to use Mr. Clarke's Heathkit radio at the school. They disguise Eleven in an old dress of Nancy's and a blonde wig. Seeing her new look, Mike calls her pretty. Eleven looks at herself in the mirror and seems pleased with her appearance.

At Hawkins Lab, a scientist named Shepard dressed in a full body hazmat suit goes into the web that leads to the other world. Dr. Brenner has him attached to a cable so he can be reeled back in. Shepard disappears into the unknown and the web wall closes behind him.

Nancy is taken out of class by police officers questioning her about Barb's disappearance. They tell her and Karen that Barb's car is no longer near Steve's house and that she probably ran away. Nancy argues that Barb wouldn't do that. They ask about what Nancy and Steve were doing together and Nancy says that they were just talking. Karen seems upset.

At the police station, Hopper asks his coworker Gary about the state troopers who brought in Will's body. Gary tells him that they claimed jurisdiction on the case and did not let Gary see the body.

The boys and Eleven bike to school and attempt to enter the radio room, but it is locked. Mr. Clarke discovers them and tells them that the assembly for Will is about to start and that they should be there. They try to argue but Mr. Clarke give them the key to the room and tells them that they can use it after the assembly. The boys introduce him to Eleven as Mike's Swedish cousin Eleanor.

At the Wheeler house, Nancy and Karen fight over what Nancy told the police. Nancy admits to Karen that she slept with Steve, but that it doesn't have anything to do with Barb's disappearance and expresses her frustration that no one seems to care that her friend is missing. She runs up to her room and looks at the ripped up photo of Barb sitting by the pool. As she puts the photo back together, she sees a strange figure off to the side. She tapes the photo back together.

At Hawkins Lab, Brenner is communicating with Shepard who describes the area as corroded. Then Shepard, clearly afraid, says that there is something else there. A deep growling can be heard and Brenner tries to reel Shepard back. The tension on the cable breaks and when the cable is reeled in, all that remains is the connector to Shepard's suit, covered in blood.

The boys and Eleven sit through the memorial assembly for Will. They hear James and Troy laughing and mocking Will. After the assembly, Mike confronts the boys who continue to insult Will. Mike pushes Troy down and Troy lunges for Mike, but stops, apparently unable to move. They all see that Troy has soiled his pants and everyone laughs at him. Mike and Eleven make eye contact and Eleven smiles, wiping her bloody nose, indicating that she caused that to happen.

Nancy finds Jonathan attempting to choose a coffin for Will. She asks him about the figure in the photo, and Jonathan has no explanation for it. He tells Nancy that Barb was there one second and then gone. Nancy confides in Jonathan about the creature she saw at Steve's house and Jonathan asks her to describe it. Jonathan realizes that the creature Nancy saw is the same one Joyce saw coming through the wall.

Hopper is having drinks at a bar and he buys a stranger a drink and tells him that his daughter just won a spelling bee. The stranger asks her name and Hopper pauses before saying her name is Sarah. Then he tells the stranger he recognizes him and the stranger explains that he is the trooper who found the body of Will Byers. Hopper asks if the quarry where Will was found is state-run and when the stranger confirms that, Hopper explains that the quarry is run by the Sattler Company and asks why the trooper is lying to him. The trooper angrily tells him to mind his own business. The shot changes to Hopper beating up the trooper outside the bar and demanding to know what the trooper was doing there. He finally confesses that he was told not to let anyone get close to the body. Hopper asks who he works for and then hears a car pull up. He runs to confront the car, which drives away. The trooper runs away.

Joyce plays ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" at her house and frustratedly yells at the lights to talk to her.

Mike, Eleven, Lucas, and Dustin go into the room with Mr. Clarke's Heathkit radio and Eleven attempts to reach Will. She has a flashback to her time in Hawkins Lab. Bruner is asking her to find a man in a photo, not to hurt him but to listen to what he says and repeat what he says back to him. Eleven closes her eyes and concentrates. She sees a man in a room reading words from a list. Bruner asks her to repeat the words and the lights flicker out as the man's voice can be heard reading random words. Back in the present, Eleven is concentrating and the light in the radio room goes out. The boys hear a clanging on the radio.

Joyce hears the same clanging and turns off the music. She hears Will whimpering and calling Mom, his voice coming from inside the wall. Joyce screams that she is there at the same time that the boys call to Will over the radio. The wallpaper parts to reveal a red window into the alternate reality. She can see Will through the red but she cannot touch him. A monster growls and Will says in terror that it is coming. Joyce begs Will to tell her how to get to him. The boys hear Will on the radio say that he is in a place that is just like home, but dark, cold, and scary. Joyce tells Will that she will find him but he has to hide. The wall closes over the portal window revealing the wall as it was before. In the radio room, a fuse blows and the radio erupts in flame. Eleven, visibly fatigued seems unable to move. The boys help her up and carry her out of the room. Joyce takes the axe and chops a hole in her wall only to reveal the normal outside of her house. The camera pans away from her house as she stares out of the hole in confusion and despair.

Jonathan and Nancy develop a zoomed in version of the photo of Barb with the creature. While they are waiting for the photo to develop, Nancy awkwardly asks Jonathan about his photography hobby. Jonathan admits that he would rather observe people than interact with them. The clearer and larger picture of the creature appears and Nancy says that that is what she saw at Steve's house. They realize that if Joyce was right about the creature, she might be right about Will still being alive and if so, Barb might also be alive.

Hopper drives back to the morgue pretending that he is there to retrieve his hat. A trooper stops him, but Hopper knocks him out and steals his key. He finds Will's body and touches it, realizing that something is not right. He cuts open the chest revealing that it is a fake body stuffed with cotton. Hopper now realizes that Joyce was right.

Lonnie comes to Joyce's house late at night. He asks her what happened to the wall and she tearfully embraces him.

Hopper drives to Hawkins Lab and cuts through the chain link fence to break in."

Joyce confides in Lonnie about being able to hear and see Will, and tearfully says that she can't hear him anymore. Lonnie suggests to Joyce that it is all in her mind and that it's a coping mechanism and he urges her to get help. The hole that Joyce chopped in the wall is now covered by a tarp.

Hopper calls for Will inside Hawkins Lab. He sees evidence of children being there - a stuffed toy on a bed and a child's drawing on the wall. The drawing shows two stick figures labeled ""11"" and ""Papa."" Hopper continues to search for Will despite the staff of Hawkins Lab now being alerted to his presence. He finds the web wall entrance to the parallel universe and gets captured before he can explore any further.

Eleven and the boys are back at Mike's house trying to make sense out of what Will was saying over the radio. Eleven says the words ""Upside down"" to describe where Will is. Mike quickly realizes that Eleven has been trying to tell that Will is on the ""other side,"" in an alternate reality. (That's why she flipped over the game board to show where he was.) They look in their Dungeons and Dragons game book for a description of ""The Vale of Shadows,"" a ""dark reflection...of our world"" where monsters live. They ask Eleven if she can get there and she shakes her head.

Jonathan comes home to find both his parents. He asks Joyce if the creature she saw came back but Lonnie shuts him down. Privately, Jonathan tells Lonnie to leave but Lonnie says that Joyce is mentally unstable. Jonathan is now starting to believe Joyce, but Lonnie argues that Jonathan is just making it worse.

Will's funeral is held at a cemetery. The boys see a girl crying at the funeral and whisper about how that will make Will feel. The coffin with the fake body is buried. In a flashback, Joyce watches Will draw a picture of Dungeons and Dragons characters. She asks him about the character and they both laugh about his needing to draw green fire because he can't find the red crayon.

Hopper wakes up back in his cabin. He runs outside with his gun, but he is alone. He then looks under all surfaces and examines all the light fixtures and electronics in his house, destroying many of his possessions in the process, and even looking inside his phone and his sofa. Finally, he discovers a bug planted in an overhead light.

At Hawkins Lab, Dr. Bruner can be seen listening into the boys conversation in Mr. Clarke's radio room. Will's voice is heard calling to Joyce, and Bruner realizes that Joyce knows something.

After the funeral, Jonathan and Nancy examine a map, marking where the creature has been. They realize that it is not going very far and make plans to find the thing and kill it. Jonathan steals a gun from the hearse but says he won't tell Joyce until the thing is dead.

Repairmen examine Mr. Clarke's fried radio. At the funeral reception, the boys ask Mr. Clarke about parallel universes and how they would get to an alternate dimension, theoretically. Mr. Clarke uses a paper plate to draw an acrobat on a tightrope, representing our dimension, which has rules - one can only move forward or backward. If there is a flea on the tightrope, it can move on top of the rope like the acrobat, but also along the side or under the rope. He says that the only way for a human to get to the Upside Down would be to create a massive amount of energy to make a tear in time and space, which would create a gate to the alternate dimension and stabs the plate with a pen to demonstrate. The boys realize that such a gate already exists, which is how Will got to the Upside Down.

Officers show up at Hoppers house to discuss a new case: two men disappeared after hunting. They were in the same place where Will disappeared, the area the boys refer to as Mirkwood. Hopper tells them that he will take care of the case. They tell him that Barb's car was discovered at a bus station, seemingly confirming that she ran away. As they drive away, the officers wonder about Hopper's odd behavior and demeanor and wonder if he is spending too much time with Joyce.

Lonnie fixes the hole in Joyce's wall by hammering boards across it. Joyce scolds him for taking down the Christmas lights, but he says that they were in the way. He mentions that he went to the quarry where Will supposedly died and there were no fences or warning signs. He says that the Sattler Company, which owns the quarry, should be held responsible.

The boys tell Eleven what Mr. Clarke told them about a gate into an alternate dimension and they ask her if she knows where it is, but she does not. Dustin is circling the room with a compass and asks to see all of their compasses. Dustin realizes that although all the compasses are not facing true north and explains that only a powerful magnetic force could make a compass point in a different direction. They realize that the gate to the Upside Down would disrupt the electromagnetic field. He hypothesizes that if they follow the compasses, they will find the gate. Eleven is visibly upset by this.

Nancy finds a bat and practices swinging it. Steve shows up and jokingly says he hopes she wasn't planning to use the bat on him. He apologizes to her for being insensitive about Barb and asks if there is any news. He suggests the two of them go see a movie but Nancy declines, tells him she will call him later, and kisses him.

Joyce has realized that Lonnie want to sue the Sattler Company and accuses him of only coming back to his family because of the money. Lonnie accuses Joyce of being a bad mother, blaming her for Will's death and calling her a mess, alluding to the Christmas lights. Joyce says she will keep them up as long as she thinks Will might still be alive. The two scream at each other, and Joyce kicks Lonnie out of the house.

Jonathan is practicing with the gun in the woods, trying to shoot cans but failing. Nancy shows up and Jonathan tells her about how his father made him kill a rabbit when he was nine years old, which was traumatizing for him. He suggests that his parents once loved each other before he could remember. Nancy confides that she doesn't think her parents ever loved each other but just married each other for convenience. She takes a turn with the gun and shoots a can on the first try.

Hopper calls his ex-wife, who seems upset that he is calling. He tells her that he doesn't regret their time together even though they lost their daughter. A baby cries and the viewer realizes that the ex-wife is remarried with a family. Hopper says goodbye and starts to leave his cabin. The phone rings, but he pulls the cord out of the wall.

Eleven and the boys are following the compasses down a railway track. Dustin suggests that Eleven is acting odd. Eleven has a flashback to being at Hawkins lab. Dr. Bruner tells her that she will go farther than she has before and Eleven asks about a bath. She is visibly afraid, but agrees. Eleven is lowered into a sensory deprivation tank. Back in the present, Eleven tells Mike that they should turn back. She says she is tired, but Mike says that they are probably almost there.

Jonathan and Nancy search the woods, Jonathan armed with the baseball bat, and Nancy carrying the gun. They have a fight over her involvement with Steve. Jonathan suggests that Nancy is pretending to be someone she is not by dating Steve. Nancy denies this and argues that Steve was just protecting her when he smashed Jonathan's camera. The two argue about him and Jonathan storms off.

Hopper shows up at Joyce's house with a sign warning her not to speak. He comes in to search the house for bugs and then sees all the Christmas lights and realizes that it could be in any of them. Later, he has examined each bulb and has determined that Joyce is probably okay. He tells her that he went to the morgue and that the body was a fake. He acknowledges that Joyce has been right the whole time.

Dustin realizes that they have gone in a circle and that they are no closer to finding the gate. Lucas accuses Eleven of using her powers to screw with the compasses and lead them away from the gate. This is confirmed when they see that she has had a recent nosebleed. Lucas accuses her of not wanting to help them find Will and Eleven, unable to accurately phrase what she is feeling, simply tells them that it's not safe. Mike and Lucas fight over Eleven. Mike says that she is helping them and Lucas accuses her of using them to get food and shelter and that maybe she is the reason Will is lost in the Upside Down. They boys fight physically and Eleven causes Lucas to be torn away from Mike, hurting him in the process. Mike and Dustin run to Lucas who is unconscious. Mike yells at Eleven, asking what is wrong with her. (Clearly, a lot!) Back in Eleven's flashback to the sensory deprivation tank, we see her in a black void listening to a man speak in Russian. Bruner and the others are able to hear him on the PA system. Eleven hears a growl and the man disappears. Eleven runs away in the void and then we see her screaming in terror in the tank. In the present, Eleven breaks down crying. Lucas wakes up, angry, but unhurt. He storms away and Mike and Dustin realize that Eleven is gone.

Jonathan and Nancy are still in the woods at night, annoyed at each other. Nancy hears a whimpering sound and they discover a severely wounded deer. Nancy realizes that she needs to shoot the deer to put it out of its misery and Jonathan says that he will do it. Clearly uncomfortable, he aims the gun at the deer, but before he can shoot, the deer is dragged away suddenly by an unseen force. They follow the trail of blood with their weapons ready. Nancy discovers a hollow at the base of a tree, dripping with blood. She calls for Jonathan who does not respond, and then crawls into the hollow to investigate. Nancy is able to crawl through the tree and out the other side where there are webs and vines everywhere and little flecks in the air, indicating that she has passed into the Upside Down. She sees the creature devouring the deer and backs away, treading on a vine, which cracks, disturbing the creature. It turns toward her and its face opens into five toothed petal-like shapes, revealing a mouth full of teeth. Nancy screams and runs back to the portal in the tree. Jonathan hears her, but doesn't know where she went. He finds her bag at the base of the tree and calls for her. As he searches, bark grows over the hollow in the tree, closing the portal to the Upside Down with Nancy trapped inside."

Lucas contacts the others on his walkie talkie and tells him that the men from Hawkins Lab are coming for Eleven. The kids flee on their bikes but are followed by the repair vans we now know are disguised vehicles for Hawkins Lab. One van comes straight for the kids, but Eleven causes it to flip over in the air and crash. The kids escape to a junkyard where they hide in an abandoned bus.

Hopper and Joyce go to the police station to get Jonathan. Jonathan and Nancy explain about the monster and Joyce reprimands Jonathan for going after it alone. At the station, Hopper encounters Troy and his mother attempting to report the girl who broke Troy's arm. Once Troy describes the girl's appearance and abilities, Hopper knows that it's Eleven. He learns that she is with the boys and they realize that they need to find the children before Brenner does. Jonathan locates Will's walkie talkie and they try to contact Mike. The boys hesitate for a while before answering, thinking it might be a trap, but ultimately tell Hopper their location.

Dr. Brenner meets with Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler and tells them that Mike has been hiding a dangerous girl and that Mike is now in danger. He asks for their trust on the matter and tells them to stay at home while he tries to find the kids. They are shaken, but agree.

The men from the lab arrive at the junkyard and nearly discover the children, but Hopper gets to them first. Back at Joyce's house, they explain to the adults about the Upside Down. Eleven tries to make contact with Will and Barb on the walkie talkie, but is weakened from flipping the van and isn't able to connect. She tells them that she can still make contact with a ""bath"" or sensory deprivation tank. Dustin calls Mr. Clarke (interrupting his date night) to ask how to build a sensory deprivation tank. They set up a kiddie pool in the Hawkins Middle School auditorium and steal hundreds of pounds of deicing salt to add to the water. Mike and Nancy have a nice moment where they agree not to keep secrets from each other anymore. Mike asks Nancy if she likes Jonathan and she denies it. Nancy asks Mike if he likes Eleven and he denies it.

Joyce thanks Eleven for her bravery and for helping her family. She reassures Eleven that she will be with her the entire time and to let her know if it gets too scary. This is the first time Eleven has been shown this kind of sympathy from an adult and it goes in direct contrast to her treatment by Dr. Brenner, who although somewhat affectionate, does not care about Eleven's mental well being and does not respond to her when she is afraid.

Eleven floats in the sensory deprivation tank and finds herself in the void. She discovers Barb's gruesome dead body and screams ""Gone!"" over and over until Joyce's voice calms her. She finds the Upside Down version of Castle Byers covered in slimy web and vines with Will inside, cold and weak, but alive. She tells him that Joyce is coming for him and he says to hurry. It is clear that he does not have much time left to live.

Hopper and Joyce leave for Hawkins Lab, leaving Nancy and Jonathan to watch the kids. Nancy realizes that Hopper and Joyce could run into the demogorgon in the Upside Down and that they need to distract it from them. They leave the kids at the school and go back to the police station where they steal back their weapons and bear trap. Hopper and Joyce break into the lab, but are captured by officials. The episode ends with a freezing Will softly singing ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go"" and hearing the demogorgon outside Castle Byers. The walls of the fort suddenly break in."

Brenner asks Joyce to help him by telling him how she made contact with Will but Joyce yells at him, saying he's the reason Will is trapped. Officials ask Hopper what he knows and he says he knows everything. He promises his silence on the matter in exchange for them letting him and Joyce find Will. Brenner also asks where Eleven is and Hopper says he will tell him if he leaves the other kids alone. Joyce and Hopper put on hazmat suits and are allowed through the gate. Brenner and Frazier leave to find Eleven, convinced that Hopper and Joyce will not come back from the Upside Down.

Jonathan and Nancy go back to Joyce's house to trap the demogorgon. They set a bear trap, pour kerosene on the floor, and hammer nails through the baseball bat and replace the Christmas lights. They cut their hands to bait the demogorgon then bandage their hands and wait for the lights to blink, signaling the demogorgon's presence. Steve shows up wanting to talk to Jonathan. Nancy and Jonathan tell him to leave, but the lights start blinking and the demogorgon comes through the ceiling. They all hide, ready to light the kerosene, but all is quiet. Steve is in disbelief and Nancy tells him he needs to leave. He goes to his car and sees that the lights are blinking again. The demogorgon attacks Jonathan and Nancy shoots it. Steve comes back and hits the demogorgon with the bat with the nails. It steps on the trap and Jonathan sets it on fire. He extinguishes the fire and they see that the demogorgon has disappeared.

Joyce and Hopper navigate the Upside Down and come to the demolished Castle Byers. Will is gone. Hopper has flashback's to his daughter suffering from cancer and her eventual death. They come to the version of Joyce's house in the Upside Down. As they walk through the house, the lights illuminate down the hallway. Jonathan and Joyce are aware of each other although they cannot see each other.

At the school, the kids are waiting for the adults to come back. Mike tells Eleven that soon she will be able to live with his family and not hide anymore. He says that he wants to take Eleven to the school dance and kisses her. Brenner and the rest from Hawkins lab arrive at the school and corner the children, but Eleven makes Frazier and two others bleed from their eyes until they fall down dead. Exhausted by the effort, Eleven faints and Brenner discovers them. As he is talking to Eleven, the lights blink. The demogorgon, drawn by Frazier's blood, appears though the wall. The kids get away and the demogorgon attacks Brenner.

Joyce and Hopper enter the library in the Upside Down. They discover Barb's body and leave her there. Joyce finds Will against the wall with a snake vine growing through his mouth. They pull out the vine, which slithers and Hopper shoots it. Will is unresponsive, but they perform CPR on him and he starts breathing again.

The kids hide in a classroom with the weak Eleven. Mike comforts her and then the demogorgon bursts through the door. Lucas fires rocks with his slingshot which is ineffective. Suddenly the demogorgon is blasted against the wall and Eleven appears, her nose bleeding. Eleven walks to the demogorgon, pushing Mike away when he tries to intervene. She says goodbye to Mike and uses her powers on the demogorgon, which disappears, and disappears with it.

Will recovers in the hospital and reunites with his family and the boys who fill him in on what has been going on.

One month later, it's Christmas Eve. The boys are playing D&D in the basement again. They finish their game and Mike looks sadly at the place where Eleven used to sleep. Nancy gives Jonathan a new camera and is seen with Steve, indicating that they are still going out. Hopper makes an appearance at an office Christmas party only to take some food and then drives to the woods where he leaves the food along with some Eggos in a wooden box. They Byers family celebrates Christmas at home without any Christmas lights. In the bathroom, Will coughs up a slug into the sink and then momentarily has a flashback of being in the Upside Down. Will tells Joyce about the D&D game as they eat Christmas dinner."

A new day, Dolores awakes. Teddy rides a train into town. A huge control room staffed by techs observe the tableau in reduced scale 3D. Elsewhere, android humans and horses are being manufactured.

Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) and a tech Elsie Hughes (Shannon Woodward) observe a hooker android, Clementine (Angela Sarafyan). He points out their boss Robert Ford has uploaded a new update into the androids, to make them have more human gestures, based on old subconscious memories. Lowe is called away, Hughes kisses the hooker android after he leaves.

Lowe goes to a meeting with the Operations Manager Theresa Cullen ( Sidse Babett Knudsen) and Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) due to some unauthorized activity, they are preparing to enter the environment, Stubbs hints that the AI are like teens, ready to rebel. Lowe says there hasn't been a critical failure in 30 years. The humans take an elevator to sub level B83 and enter a wet room, ready with guns.

In the field lab Ford restores Dolores and remarks on her artistic ability. He quizzes her and is nonplussed when Bernard shows up. Ford narrates the past, Arnold despondent over his son's death educated Dolores instead, then she killed all the hosts as requested, then murdered Arnold himself before suiciding. Ford fixed it all with a new investor and still reopened the park. Ford acknowledges he made a big mistake 35 years ago, he gives her the gun again.

Her dad doesn't want the move to be a big deal but Holly says that she's tired of having her whole world up-rooted everytime he gets a promotion.

Abigail Hobbs awakens from her coma. Graham suspects that Garrett Jacob Hobbs, dubbed the ""Minnesota Shrike"", killed eight girls, but not the one impaled on the deer's head; that, he maintains, was a victim of a copycat, who called Hobbs to warn him. Crawford harbors suspicions that Abigail was somehow complicit in her father's killing spree, despite objections from Dr. Bloom, Lecter and Graham. Lounds meets the brother of the impaled girl and reveals to him that Abigail Hobbs is out of the hospital. Lecter and Graham take Abigail to her home, where she and her neighbor Marissa are confronted by the brother of the impaled girl, Nicholas Boyle. The following day, Abigail is taken to the cabin where Marissa is found impaled on a deer's head.

Later, Crawford receives another phone call, which they trace to an old observatory, where they find Miriam's cell phone clutched in the hand of a severed arm. A final flashback reveals Miriam's fate: she visits Dr. Lecter to ask about an old patient, Jeremy Olmstead, whom he had come into contact with when working as an ER attendant, who has turned up as the latest Ripper victim.

A agitated man jumps out of his seat, and hurriedly makes his way along the aisle. When a stewardess grabs his shoulder, he turns, and looks as if his face has melted. A man in a seat tries to use a medical injector on himself.

He vomits on a woman, and other passengers start screaming and melting.

The co-pilot opens the cockpit door to see what's going on, as the captain hurriedly activates the auto-pilot.

When the co-pilot turns, his face is bubbling and oozing as well.

The plane flies silently on.

In a motel room, a couple discovers the bed creaks. Agents John Scott (Mark Valley) and Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) sneak around because bureau policy prevents on-the-job relationships. Scott tells her he loves her, but she doesn't respond. Then they both get called to a scene at Logan Airport in Boston.

Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) briefs Dunham. They lost contact with a passenger plane with 147 people on board. There are no signs of life. Logan has an autopilot system. The plane landed itself. They haven't opened the plane, at the CDC's direction.

A man drives up to the gate in a work van and asks what's going on. It look like the same guy from the plane who injected himself and presumably died.

Homeland Security dude Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) arrives and tells everyone to suit up. He leaves out Agent Dunham and scoffs at her liaison title but then tells her to put on a suit and go in.

The inside of the plane is slimy, with decimated bodies everywhere. Dunham doesn't think it's terrorism.

At the Federal Building in Boston, the office IDs victims. Every time Dunham asks Broyles a question, he mocks and barks at her. He sends her on a wild goose chase to follow a tip about two middle Eastern men giving a white guy a brief case and something about a trash can. He also calls her ""Honey"".

Outside, Dunham tells Scott that Broyles doesn't like her because she caught his best friend after he sexually assaulted three Marine privates and she put him away.

She stops walking and brings up what Scott said in the motel. She tells him she loves him.

At the storage facility, Dunham finds ammonia in the trash. Scott jimmies open the storage lockers one by one until he finds a makeshift lab with hairless rats, computers, and beakers. Dunham goes outside to make a call while Scott looks around. Airplane Guy shows up and starts running. Scott chases after him, through storage containers.

Dunham sees them pass and is behind Scott when Airplane Guy makes a call on his cell phone and a huge explosion blasts both agents.

Dunham wakes up in the hospital. She gets up to go find Scott. A doctor tells her he was exposed to some synthetic chemicals. He's not contagious, but they don't know what's affecting him. They've never seen anything like it. He's in a drug-induced coma. She goes to look at him. His skin is translucent and he's nasty colors.

Duham looks in the interagency database for info on tissue hardening and finds a scientist. She runs to tell Broyles. She has a connection between the Hamburg flight and what's happening with Scott. It's Walter Bishop (John Noble), a scientist who's been in a prison mental hospital for 17 years for a lab accident killing his assistant. Broyles points out he's only allowed visits from immediate family. She has to find his son. In Baghdad. He's a high school drop out named Peter (Joshua Jackson), who has an IQ of 190. He was also a college chemistry professor, on fake credentials.

In Iraq, Peter makes a sales pitch to two Iraqi businessmen. He speaks Farsi. They make a deal. Olivia finds him. He laughs her off when she mentions the flight.

He doesn't want anything to do with his father. She begs him. He still says No. She tells him she knows why he's there. Either he goes with her or she tells certain people where he is.

On the plane back, Peter talks about his father, brilliant but difficult. He says his father did research out of the basement of Harvard for a toothpaste company.

Olivia tells him Walter was really working in fringe science, mind-control, teleportation, astral projection, reanimation.

Peter now thinks his father was Dr. Frankenstein.

At the prison's mental hospital, Olivia goes alone to talk to Dr. Bishop. He's twitchy and odd but asking questions about what Scott looks like. He says his condition can be reversed.

He looks at her and says she came with his son because he's not allowed visitors without immediate family. He wants to see him.

Peter goes in and his father's first words in 17 years are to tell him he's not as fat as he expected. Thanks, Pops.

Dr. Bishop says he needs to see Scott. He's allowed out only with a family member as a guardian. Peter tells Olivia to be careful what she wishes for.

On the car ride, Olivia asks Walter if anyone else knew what he was up to. He mentions William Bell. Olivia and Peter recognize him as the founder of the enormous Massive Dynamics super-rich company.

At the hospital, Dunham asks Charlie to set up an interview for her with William Bell.

Scott looks grosser, everything on the inside showing through hard, glassy skin.

Dr. Bishop picks up a scalpel and takes off a piece of Scott's skin. It scoops off like butter. He wants to go to his lab, but Olivia tells him it was shut down. He freaks out.

Olivia asks Broyles to reopen Bishop's lab. Broyles asks if she's trying so hard because there was something going on with her and Agent Scott.

They go to the lab at Harvard, now used for storage. Dr. Bishop rattles off the list of supplies he needs, including a cow to test on.

As he preps, Peter asks Olivia what was in his file. There was no file. She bluffed.

Dr. Bishop has identified the compound affecting Scott, but he can't treat it without knowing exactly what was in the lab. Scott was the only one who saw the guy's face. Dr. Bishop tells Olivia he's so sorry he can't offer a less dangerous solution.

He forgot to mention: he thinks it's possible for two minds to share information in an unconscious state.

Peter mocks it, but Olivia listens. Dr. Bishop says he did it once with a corpse (which you can do for up to six hours). She'd have to be immersed in a tank and on a lot of drugs including LSD - with a metal rod in her brain. Peter says it'll kill her. She agrees, because dating again is rough.

They bring John to the lab. Charlie tells Olivia that William Bell is out of the country for two weeks, and it'll take 48 hours to get a warrant. He asks surprisingly few questions about the cow.

Olivia strips to her skivvies. Dr. Bishop implants the metal rod in her neck and injects her with the drugs. As she gets in the tank, Dr. Bishop thanks her for trusting him.

He checks his machines, waiting for their brain rhythms to be in sync. Olivia starts her wild trip: She's in a junkyard, then in a house, then she sees her uncle's kayak. Then she's in a cemetery. John Scott hears her, and they see each other standing on the FBI symbol in the middle of the desert. She tells him what happened and asks him to try to remember what the guy looked like. The scene from the storage facility replays. She sees his face and then freaks out. They yank her out of the tank.

At the office, she recreates his face using a computer model. Someone in the office IDs him as a passenger on the flight. He has a twin, Richard Steig (Jason Butler Harner). Richard sacrificed his brother, putting the disease in his insulin pen. His last employer was Massive Dynamic.

The executive director, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), meets with Olivia. She says they caught him three months ago trying to steal classified information. Sharp says she's worked there for 16 years and owes her life to the company. Bell noticed she looked odd and sent her to the hospital where they found cancer. They had to amputate her arm. She peels off her skin to reveal a mechanical arm.

Sharp asks Olivia if she thinks Steig is part of the Pattern. The Pattern? Olivia doesn't have clearance to know about whatever that is. Sharp lectures her about science advancing and tells her to be careful.

FBI agents storm Steig's apartment. The Bishops wait outside. Walter doesn't want to go back to prison. Peter sees Steig run out the back of the apartment and chases after him. They run into another apartment building and up to the roof, where Olivia has caught up. She jumps down a fire escape and gets to him just seconds after Peter tackles him and punches him, quite macho for a pretend scientist.

Olivia interviews Steig but gets nowhere. Peter watches the video. Olivia leaves the interrogation room, frustrated. Peter sneaks in. He tells Steig he could give him what John has whenever he wants. But he doesn't have the time. He smashes Steig's fingers with a coffee mug.

They all race back to the lab with the list of chemicals and start making the antidote.

Upstairs, Broyles checks in with Dunham. He tells her she's done some solid work. He says ""we're impressed."" What happened on the plane might just be one incidence of several other odd things that have happened. Kids reappearing after being missing, a tsunami after a high-pitched frequency, a person coming out of a coma and writing coordinates of their battlegroups. He says they're part of ""the pattern."" Someone is using the world as their lab for science experiments. He tells her she can have whoever she needs. She wants to go back to her normal life.

In the lab, they transfuse Scott with his treated blood. He wakes up. He tells Olivia he had a dream about her.

Back at the regular hospital, the doctor tells Olivia that John should be better in a week. Dunham visits Steig. She wants to know why he killed his own brother. He says he has a recording of a conversation in which a guy from her office threatened him.

Olivia goes to where he buried it. She finds the tape along with a passport. She plays it. It's Scott. Olivia recognizes it as the threatening call he was making as he arrived at the airport.

Scott smothers Steig in the hospital with a pillow.

Olivia races to the hospital, telling Charlie to post agents outside Scott's room and check on Steig. She pulls up as Scott is driving away. She follows him.

They race through traffic, police cars join in. She pulls alongside, and he rams her, which has got to make that whole LSD water tank thing seem like a bad idea in retrospect. John's car hits a barrier and flips. He crawls out, bloodied. She runs to him. ""Ask yourself why Broyles sent you to the storage facility,"" he croaks out. She asks him who he's working for, but he dies without answering.

Francis drives Olivia, musing on how the government trails big corporations in knowledge. He takes her to the lab.

Olivia intercepts Peter and tells him Walter needs to stay, which means he needs to stay, too. Peter asks where John is. She says she's not going to use false threats anymore. The threats are real.

Peter says Walter told him about the work he and Bell had done and the plane is just the beginning.

In an underground corridor, a man wheels Agent Scott's body down the hallway. Nina Sharp asks how long he's been dead. Five hours. ""Question him."""

A man dresses after paying for the services of a young woman. Out of her sight, he takes out a kit of scary-looking surgical tools and prepares some sort of cocktail as the hooker babbles on the bed. Then she gets up, screaming. Something is happening to her stomach. He drives her somewhere as her stomach swells and she continues screaming. He leaves her at a hospital.

They ask her how many months pregnant she is. She says she's not pregnant, but her now-huge stomach says otherwise. The doctors prepare to cut her open, and there's a tearing and ripping noise. She dies, and they cut her open. Whatever they pull out of her is so nasty, the nurse screams.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) convenes a group of people to talk about the case. Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) is among them. Broyles introduces dossiers of his new team, including Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and his son Peter (Joshua Jackson). Nina isn't thrilled he recruited Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), who was having ""an illicit affair with her partner"", she notes. John Scott. (Mark Valley) Interesting choice of words.

Dunham, at home, looks over Agent Scott's still unsolved case. She gets a call from Broyles, telling her to pick up the Bishops and meet him at the hospital. She goes to Peter's, where his dad is hiding in the closet. Seventeen years in a prison psych ward will do that to you.

They arrive at the hospital, where Peter clarifies he's not officially on the team. Broyles briefs them on the case. The baby kept growing as they transferred it to intensive care. It lived for half an hour. They see the body of a dead elderly man. Dr. Bishop has some fancy scientific analysis, but wants to go back to his lab, which he doesn't remember having.

Broyles briefs Olivia and Peter on ""the Pattern,"" the series of unexplained events.

Olivia gets word someone called about a woman at a hotel. Olivia wants Walter to go with her, but he barks at her. Peter goes instead to collect samples. He finds an orange gel on the sink.

Olivia looks at the bedsheets and notices something amiss. She tells Peter to open the cabinet; there will be sheets in it. There are. She knows the killer. It was a murderer she and Scott tracked but didn't catch.

The killer would kill five women in a short period of time, giving them a muscle paralyzer and cutting their mouth up to their brain. ""And all of this relates to Magic Old Man Baby, how?"" asks Peter. The muscle paralyzer he used was bright orange.

The same guy meets a woman at a strip club.

At FBI HQ, Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) briefs the troops on Agent Scott, who will be considered innocent until proven otherwise. Olivia arrives. Charlie wants to know why she wants to open a 12-year-old case and what Broyles has her working on. She blames herself for not stopping Scott.

Stoughton, Mass.

The creepy guy and his date arrive at a warehouse. He wants her to check out the view of the bridge. He starts to take out his tools, holding a syringe. When she finishes gazing at the bridge, they kiss and he injects her.

Harvard.

Peter drops by his father's lab. Walter is milking the cow. His tests on the man-baby are done. The DNA shows the woman was impregnated by a man who was the result of experiments he used to do. He's fuzzy on the details. He's very excited; he has remembered where he parked his car 17 years ago. They go to a garage, where he remembers the combination to the padlock. He says he has things hidden around town. He finds some files in the car.

Olivia looks over the files from the Brain Surgeon, as the killer was called. He removes women's pituitary glands.

Back at the lab, they look through the files. He says it has something to do with the pituitary. They find the name Dr. Claus Penrose in the files on the pituitary. Olivia and Peter head to his lab at Boston College.

The Brain Surgeon starts to work on the immobilized and terrified hooker.

Boston College...

Olivia shows Penrose the pictures of the Man Baby. Penrose renounces what he and Walter did and says he's tried to forget it.

At the lab, Walter examines the body of a recent victim Charlie had sent there. Her pituitary glad was removed. Walter thinks he might know why. He worked for the Defense Department years ago on a program designed to grow soldiers. It was theoretical, and the problem was how to slow the aging process once it started. He thinks the killer is a product of that experiment. Walter thinks, to slow his aging process, the killer has to inject himself with the women's pituitary gland juice. The woman who gave birth to the man baby was an accident. He impregnated her and the process took off, which is a whole new thing to worry about after a one-night stand.

At the warehouse, the killer gets a visit from Dr. Penrose who calls him ""son."" He asks him how the pain is. It's getting worse. Penrose says he just needs to get one more and killer guy/son will be OK again.

Walter talks science over a dead female body. He cites Jules Verne to Peter, who doesn't buy the Verne-posited ""last image seen by a dead person can be recreated"" theory. Walter thinks the fact she was given a muscle relaxer means the electrical impulse of the last image she saw might be stuck on her optic nerve. But they need a fancy-sounding machine to translate it into image.

Peter finds Olivia in the park and tells her their crazy idea. Only one company has the patent for the machine they need.

Massive Dynamic, NYC

Olivia and Broyles wait for Nina Sharp. Olivia tells him what Scott said about it being more than a coincidence she was recruited. He asks her if she was safe the last time she was with Scott. She starts writhing as something pokes out of her stomach.

Then she's startled back to the real world when a woman comes to tell her Nina is ready for her (and Broyles isn't there).

Nina offers her condolences for Agent Scott and makes a joke about how Olivia's male colleagues probably think she was sleeping with him. An employee arrives with the electronic pulse camera.

Back at the lab, the Bishops extract the victim's eyeball and hook up the camera.

At a noisy bar, the killer, not looking that swell, arrives to meet his next date.

He and dear old dad work on her in the warehouse.

Back at the lab, they see an image of a bridge. Astrid Farnsworth, played by (Jasika Nicole), (that female agent in the background you haven't noticed 'til now) recognizes it as being from Stoughton. They pull images and triangulate where the angle would come from, identifying a warehouse.

Olivia and Peter go to the warehouse. They find Penrose standing over the woman, who is still alive. Peter holds him at gunpoint while Olivia chases the killer. While he's calling in for field support, Penrose manages to flick the switch on the pinned hooker's IV. Peter calls Walter, asking him what to do about a young woman going into cardiac arrest. Walter asks if Peter has any cocaine. Failing that, he needs a defibrillator, which he also doesn't have.

Killer guy is running and graying at the same time.

Peter is jimmying something out of a power cord and duct tape--MacGyver-style emergency medicine. It works. The woman's heart starts beating.

Olivia follows the Brain Surgeon's coughing noises. She finds him, elderly and near death. He says they should have let him die, but Penrose kept him alive because he loved him. He croaks.

Olivia returns the camera to Nina. Nina tells her she doesn't think Olivia should be in public service. She offers her a job, citing the company's powers: the right to direct private armies overseas, developing weaponry. She thinks working at Massive Dynamic might help Olivia find answers, to the Pattern and other things.

At the Boston HQ, Broyles says Penrose is on the run. He reminds Olivia every aspect of the case is classified. He wants to know if Nina asked questions. Olivia tells him about the job offer. She tells Broyles she told Nina he was giving her a raise.

At the lab, Peter reads his contract with the FBI, which includes signing his rights away to the government. When he leaves, Walter mentions something about Peter's medical history, but it's news to her.

At the hotel, Walter wakes Peter up, saying numbers to himself, unable to sleep. Peter counters with ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat,"" the song someone in the mental ward used to sing each night. Walter drifts off to sleep.

Fade out and in to three men on beds in a white room. Two are under plastic tubes. They might not be alive."

He asks the priest if he believes God and the devil can speak to him. The man says he tries to be good, but he sees things. Cut to a bus. A man in a business suit gets on with a briefcase he's closely guarding.

Confession man says, ""It's happening again."" Back on the bus a woman puts down her backpack. Confession man says he's scared of what's going to happen on the bus.

On the bus, briefcase man takes out a gas mask and puts it on. He rolls a gas canister down the aisle and takes the woman's backpack.

Confession man says he just wants it to stop.

Briefcase man gets off the bus with the backpack.

Confession man gets up and leaves. The priest follows him. He knows it's Roy. Roy drops a drawing of people screaming on the bus.

A police officer finds the bus. The passengers appear frozen in some sort of liquid.

Mount Briar Cemetery

At a graveside, a priest conducts a funeral for Agent John Scott (Mark Valley). Agents Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) stand. Scott's mom appears to be giving Dunham the stink eye.

Storming away from the grave, Dunham tells Francis they shouldn't be burying a man who gave away government secrets like he was some sort of hero. Dunham wonders why Mom Scott was eyeballing her. Enter Broyles (Lance Reddick), requesting Dunham.

In a diner, the Bishops dine. Walter (John Noble) mixes his medication into his tea and Peter (Joshua Jackson) points out Walter's not on medication. But that's where he's wrong - Walter made himself some homemade anti-psychotics. Peter gets up and Walter answers his cell phone.

Peter accosts a guy at the counter. He's got a camera full of pictures of Peter. The guy tells Peter he was supposed to check in when he came out. Peter threatens him, saying if he tells anyone, he'll come after him. Walter takes his time, but eventually passes on the bus message.

At the bus, Broyles says the attack wasn't biological. Fringe-y. Walter says they look like mosquitoes trapped in amber.

The man from the bus and the man who picked him up go through the items from the backpack. They don't find what they're looking for. One man makes a call on what looks like a satellite phone.

Roy sits in a cubicle and sees scary things. He starts drawing. As he's finishing up the drops of blood a coworker comes over and asks him what it is. It's looks like a someone with stigmata, bloody palms.

Walter examines the gunk from the bus. He forgets Astrid's name again. Walter asks Peter who the man in the restaurant was. Peter lies.

In a warehouse, teams sort through the items from the bus. Dunham finds a video camera. They play the tape. Dunham notices the woman gripping her backpack. She notices the backpack isn't among the remaining items. She's Evelina Mendoza, she's undercover DEA.

Dunham brings in Mendoza's handler. He says she was ready to get out. She heard them discussing ""the Pattern.""

He IDs her body. He goes in to say good-bye, with his back to Olivia he seems to be caressing Mendoza's hand.

Walter plays piano in the lab. It helps him think. They've figured out what the gunk is. Guess what company makes the compounds: Massive Dynamic. Charlie Francis calls. They got a tip about Roy and go to his apartment. He doesn't seem to fit the profile of a mass murderer. But in his bedroom they find drawings of attacks that have happened in the last year. They're all dated before the incidents took place. There's a model recreation of the flight from Hamburg.

They interrogate Roy. No one thinks he's involved, but they want to know how he knew. Broyles says several of the incidents were never made public. Charlie asks him about the bus drawing.

Olivia talks with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) about the compounds used to make the gunk. She wants a list of the labs they sell the chemicals to. Olivia notes how often she keeps running into Massive Dynamic in her investigations. Nina notes how often Olivia seems to be near the incidents. Then Nina mentions the gunk was used before in Prague and says if Olivia had clearance she might know they'd already turned over the list of labs.

Broyles watches Charlie talk to Roy. Roy knows he sounds crazy. He describes the feelings he gets and that the only way to get rid of them is to try to draw or build what he sees. This has been happening for nine months.

Broyles tells the Bishops that that's about when they became aware of ""the pattern."" Peter doesn't think Roy's lying. Walter suggests Ockham's razor, everything being equal the obvious is true. The man's psychic, but has no control over his ability. Broyles doesn't buy it, so Walter prepares to prove it.

Olivia intercepts Broyles. She wants to know why she's not in the know. Broyles gives her it's-for-her-protection bit. He says she'll know when she's ready.

The Bishops observe Roy going into an MRI. Walter thinks he might be able to intercept the thoughts. Something weird happens to Roy's face, his veins start bulging. He has metal in his blood which, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) clarifies, is not normal.

The Bishops look through Walter's files. Walter finds that he and William Bell worked on this same issue, theorizing there was a ""ghost network,"" a spectrum for thought waves. Peter finds a file showing Roy was a test subject and was injected with whatever caused the problem. Peter isn't impressed his dad used the man as a guinea pig. Walter figures out Roy is just overhearing what other people are saying on the ""ghost network.""

Walter tries to catch the team up to speed on his research. He thinks they might be able to redirect the transmissions from Roy's brain. Minor brain surgery. Walter needs a specific piece of equipment. Luckily, he hid it in a wall in their old house.

No one's home at the house. Peter breaks in.

At the lab, Astrid straps Roy in for brain surgery.

At his old house, Peter removes an air vent and finds nothing. He has another idea. He pops open a hidden dumbwaiter and finds papers and stuff.

Walter preps Roy for surgery. He has to remain awake. Roy thinks Walter looks familiar.

Olivia and Peter return with the device. They strap it on Roy, it's like a head brace. Just as Walter is about to drill into Roy's brain some lost students knock on the door. They plug the machine into Roy's noggin. Walter tells Roy to tell him what he feels as he looks at some pictures. Peter holds up the pictures. No reaction to a horse, but then a car and Roy tastes dirt and gasoline. Nothing happens for the next picture but then Roy starts speaking Latin. Astrid translates. She happens to have majored in linguistics in college. There's an exchange being made at South Station in an hour. Then something that works out to ""she had it on her the whole time."" Dunham looks at the stigmata-like pictures and realizes it's Mendoza. She remembers her handler seeming to caress her hand. She goes to the morgue and takes out the woman's palm and finds that instead he sliced into it.

Olivia briefs Broyles and they converge on the station.

At the lab, Walter discovers with the proper tweaking, Roy could receive satellite TV. They're about to unhook him when Roy starts talking again. English this time. They checked to make sure the handler wasn't followed.

Olivia boards a train, looking for him. At the lab, they stare at Roy, waiting for him to talk. Roy gets a call, the handler's on the move. Back in the station, Olivia spots him. She pulls her gun but it's too late, the handler made the exchange and has been shot.

Olivia runs after the dude with the case. She and Charlie catch him. He's putting his hands in the air as they command when he suddenly takes a step backward - right into the path of an on-coming bus.

Back at the office, some lab folks open the case. There's a tiny clear object about the size of a quarter inside. They have no idea what it is.

They ID'd the shooter, who was involved in several other pattern events. Broyles shows her a file of Pattern cases.

Back at the lab, Roy's bandaged up and OK. Walter even gave him some homemade Vicodin. Peter's sitting at the piano and asks for requests. He plays ""Someone to Watch Over Me.""

Broyles meets with Nina Sharp and passes her the mystery object. They discuss Dunham. Nina says she wants nothing but the best for her. ""Of course you do,"" Broyles says.

Back to the mystery white lab. Men on tables. Nina gives the object to a man, who examines it under a microscope. He says it's not damaged and might be what they need to break the encryption. He's also made progress on something else. A computer screen shows a download labeled ""John Scott"" and, lo, there he lies, hooked up to the machine."

A creepy bald man without eyebrows sits in a diner and orders a roast beef sandwich with raw meat, room temperature water and 11 jalapenos on the side. He watches construction across the street, using spy gadgets to get up-close readings of the crew. He takes notes in backward handwriting that resembles hieroglyphics. He puts the whole shaker of pepper on his sandwich and tops it off with hot sauce. He practically inhales the sandwich. He checks on the construction again. The walls of the diner start to rattle. The street shakes. A plume of smoke shoots into the sky from the site from an explosion. The crane starts to come apart. As people flee the diner the man sits casually and takes money out of his wallet. He puts on his hat and glasses and walks into the site, briefcase in hand. He makes a call. ""It has arrived.""

At the Bishops' hotel, the Dr. babbles formulas to himself - at 3 a.m. Peter (Joshua Jackson) takes exception. He goes to sleep in the tub.

At the federal building, Peter walks without clearance to find Olivia (Anna Torv). He's irked pops kept him up all night reciting formulas for his favorite beverages - naked (he likes the breeze). Peter tells her they don't need him there. He's just a babysitter. He's getting restless. Olivia tells him Walter (John Noble) has said if Peter leaves he won't help.

The Fringies show up at a warehouse as Broyles (Lance Reddick) briefs them on the construction incident. The cover story is it was a gas main rupture. He wants them to see what really caused it.

A silver egg-shaped two-foot tall metallic object sits on a table. It's making odd vibrations. It came from underground. Walter thinks he might know what it is, but he doesn't want to talk about it yet. Broyles says Col. Henry Jacobson oversaw the investigation in 1987 the last time one of these things showed up.

Peter tells Olivia this is his last case.

Walter wants to take it to the lab. When Broyles says no, Walter uses angrily says he'll only work on it with his equipment.

Olivia visits Jacobson (Nestor Serrano), a widower, in Roseville, Virginia. She asks about Quantico in 1987.

He shows her a picture of Master Sgt. Stewart Mallick. He was watching the motion censors on the base and one night they went nuts. They found the metal egg thing, also vibrating. 48 hours after they found it there was a huge, downward explosion. And it disappeared.

Harvard Walter puts censors on the egg, using a tuning fork to get it to hum a high-pitch squeal.

In a car outside the warehouse, a man gets out with a really big gun and blows away the FBI guard. The gun seems to shoot pulses of light or sound, blowing people backward. He storms into the lab, taking everyone out along the way. He asks the remaining lab geek where it is. Fade out ominously.

Olivia gets a call in the middle of the night. There's no one there at first then she hears John Scott's voice. She calls headquarters on her landline and asks for a trace. She's told there are no records of a call in the last three hours.

Back at Harvard, Walter marvels at the egg, which Peter calls ""a gigantic metallic suppository."" Walter talks about about Project Thor, a project to make an underground torpedo. Olivia looks at a photo from 1987. She sees creepy bald guy and recognizes him from surveillance footage from two weeks ago at the hospital (she's really good at Concentration).

The blaster guy from the warehouse shows up at Jacobson's house and blasts him.

Olivia shows Broyles the photos of creepy bald guy. He takes her to a secret room, covered in photos with him in every one. It took them a year to spot him. She did it in three weeks. There are pictures of him from all over. They don't know who he is.

They've recorded him at over three dozen scenes related to the Pattern. They call him The Observer (Michael Cerveris), because that's what he seems to be doing.

Broyles gets a call.

At Harvard, Walter is ramping up another noise experiment, but not telling Peter why. He's getting really irked at his dad's silence when Olivia calls to tell him about the attack at the warehouse. Walter guesses someone has come for it. They need aluminum foil, their lives depend on it. Oh, and also, Walter would like a root beer float while Peter's out. Peter leaves and Walter asks Astrid (Jasika Nicole) to hand him a syringe, which he jams in her neck.

Peter returns to an empty lab. Astrid is out cold, Walter and the egg are gone.

At Jacobson's house, Blaster guy has Jacobson strapped down, with censors jammed in his nose and on his head. The man flips a switch and Jacobson writhes in pain. The man tells him to think about something. He finally does. The man blasts him again.

At the diner, Walter gets his root beer float. He's joined by Creepy Bald Guy. They discuss floats. Walter offers to share. The man says he wouldn't taste much anyway. The man thanks Walter for hiding the beacon, Creepy can't touch it himself.

The Fringies man the phones, looking for Walter. Olivia gets a call. Walter was picked up walking the freeway median.

Peter and Olivia pay him a visit. He won't tell them where he hid it, he tells them. He says he has to keep it safe for another four hours. His friend agrees with him. His friend Creepy Bald Guy. Olivia wants to know where he is, while Peter thinks he's making it up. Walter calls Peter ""small-minded"" and tell him not to act like his mother. Peter thanks him, it's exactly what he needed. Guilt relieved. He can leave.

Olivia briefs Broyles.

At Harvard, Peter packs up his stuff under the watchful eye of the cow. He gets a call back. He's looking for work. He goes through files, finding a photo of him with his dad. Blaster Guy lurks in the dark.

Olivia looks at photos on her computer. Astrid calls, asking what happened to Peter. She's at the lab. She says there was a struggle there.

Peter is trapped to the same apparatus Jacobson was. He tries to tell the man he doesn't know whatever it is he's looking for. The man rams censors up his nose and puts in an earpiece. The man asks him what the most pain he's ever felt in his life, then he turns the dial and answers the question for him.

Olivia shows Walter security camera footage of Blaster/Torture guy. He thinks Peter will lead him to the cylinder, even though Walter didn't tell Peter where he put it.

Back on the torture table, Peter tells the man he won't tell him. But then he seems to, as the man hears him think Walter hid it. He ratchets up the pain and realizes where Walter's hiding places are.

The man drives his car to a cemetery. He gets Peter out of the trunk. They find a grave for Robert Bishop. The man tells him to dig.

Olivia pulls up, alone. Gun out, she investigates. The man has the cylinder. He hears a footstep. He runs off, leaving Peter. Olivia checks on Peter, then follows. He blasts her, but misses. Peter saws his ropes off on a gravestone. Olivia hits Blaster guy, who leaves the cylinder on the ground. She kicks his gun away.

The cylinder starts to make noise and then whirs and digs into the earth. Olivia looks down a deep, perfect hole. The Observer observes. He makes a call: ""Departure on schedule.""

Peter tackles him from behind. They stare at each other and Peter starts asking questions. The Observer spits them out as Peter says them. Then The Observer gets ahead of Peter, saying ""do you really know my father? Did you talk to him this afternoon? Are you his friend?"" Then the Observer shoots Peter.

Peter stands up. Not dead, Olivia is relieved to see when she finds him.

Francis (Kirk Acevedo) visits Walter. He's there to take him home, but first Walter wants to see Astrid. He apologizes ""what I did to you was very untrustworthy of me."" He says he was doing what was necessary to protect us all. He offers to let her inject him, too.

Olivia and Broyles meet at the hospital. The cylinder is gone. They ID'd the shooter, wanted for a double homicide. Peter signs himself out. He tells Olivia he's starting to buy into The Pattern. He says the man in the woods knew him and knew what he was going to say before he said it. He hates to admit it, but Walter might be right. Olivia didn't see the bald guy. She tries to dismiss what he saw as due to the torture, but Peter says he's not going anywhere until he gets some answers. She gives him his credentials. Civilian consultant to Homeland Security.

At the hotel, Peter tells Walter about his day. He says the strangest thing was he answered a question he didn't know the answer to. Walter tells him ideas can be absorbed through osmosis.

Walter starts talking about the night of the accident. Peter's mother was driving. Thanksgiving night. Their car went out on the ice and it cracked. Peter thinks his dad saved them both, swimming to shore. Walter tells him, no, they died that night. A bald man saved them, a man who felt no cold. He heard his thoughts and the bald man saying he might need a favor from him someday. This was that day. He knew he had to protect the capsule for them. Walter says he knows Peter must think he's insane. ""Not nearly as much as you might think,"" says Peter.

Olivia returns home. She prepares a dinner of cereal with a Scotch chaser. She looks up to see Agent Scott (Mark Valley) standing in her kitchen. He says hello. The cereal bowl falls to the floor, shattering into a gazillion pieces."

A man lies in bed. His digital clock is flashing, the time needing to be set. He takes his pulse. His mother nags him as he leaves. He goes to work in a shipping company. He has an ad for something that says ""Unlock Your Hidden Potential"" in his locker. He moons over a woman's photo on his phone. This supervisor comes over and gives him a hard time. The package reader shorts out, the second one in a week.

He delivers a package to an office building, nervous to talk to the secretary, the woman on his phone. He tries to talk to her, noticing her Brownie patch and outing himself as a former Webelo. She found it on-line, it's kitchsy. A slick man in a suit comes over to check with her that they're still on for their date. As the delivery man looks upset her computer starts to short out.

He runs for the elevator. As he gets on, Baldy McHairless (Michael Cerveris), ""The Observer"", gets off. The secretary runs for the elevator, she pushes her floor button, knocking his phone out of his hand. It opens and she sees her picture on it. The elevator starts to fall. It stops just long enough for her to tell him to get away from her, then it freefalls, crashing in the parking garage below.

He lives. The secretary and everyone else appear dead. He gets up and walks away, unscathed. As he walks through the garage, empty cars start, their lights on. Freaked, he runs.

Boston Olivia (Anna Torv) confides in Charlie (Kirk Acevedo). She says she doesn't want him to think she's crazy, but she saw John (Mark Valley) the night before in her kitchen. She drew her gun, but he was gone. She knows he wasn't there. Charlie thinks it doesn't seem all that odd given that John and Olivia were lovers. Also, John betrayed her and his country and then died in her arms.

Harvard The Bishops wait for Olivia in the lab. Walter (John Noble) is still bothered Peter (Joshua Jackson) was tortured. He wants to tell Peter about what it was like in the mental hospital. Peter reassures him he's doing fine.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) enters, telling them about the elevator plummeting 26 floors and killed eight people. There was a power surge. It drove itself into the floor. A train in Tokyo did the same thing months ago. He wants to know if they're related.

At the building, they meet with the engineer, who describes how the elevator busted through all sorts of back-up safety measures, like another power source came on-line and drove it. Walter finds an exit wound burn on a victim, symptoms of a thermoelectric trauma. The people were electrocuted.

Walter uses Olivia's gold necklace to demonstrate the space is charged with electricity. It hangs in the air. He says the passengers were dead by the time they hit the ground.

Back at the lab he performs an autopsy, removing a victim's heart. He describes an experiment he once worked on to track humans like pigeons, using their electromagnetic signatures. The human field was too weak and they tried to amp it up, but the side effects of the subjects shorting out nearby electronics meant it couldn't work. He jumpstarts the heart he has removed and it beats, which makes him think someone has perfected the experiment and the charge came from a human being.

Sparky returns to work and finds his boss, who immediately starts chewing him out. He notices blood on the man's uniform. He fires him. The man begs. The boss says no and goes back to work on a huge machine. He sticks his arm in it. Uh oh. Soon he has a shredded arm.

At the office, Broyles brings Olivia some coffee as she works at her desk late at night. She's reading up on the Electric Man theory. Walter thinks the person would have been altered in some way. Extensive procedures, chemical therapy. Broyles tells her about companies that do experiments on people and a Dr. Jacob Fisher (Max Baker) who led the experiments. Later, she looks at Fisher's file. The power goes out in the office. Armed with a flashlight, she goes to investigate.

The elevator dings in an otherwise darkened hallway. John Scott steps out and starts talking to her. He asks her to trust him and says they don't have much time. He says he's there to help and he loved her. He says he can prove it, but not there. That's not the way it works. She has to find the mysterious Sparky. Fisher is also looking for him. She has to find him first, before Fisher can use him. As she tries to get him to tell her for what use, he says that he will prove he loves her, always, but she'll have to wait. The elevator doors close and it descends. She races down to the next floor, but it's empty when the doors open. But she notices the maximum weight capacity.

She visits the Bishops late at night, having calculated that the weight before the elevator dropped and after has a discrepancy of 165 pounds. She thinks someone else was in it and got off. As Walter shuffles his feet on the carpet, Peter spins a scientific explanation about electric cushions that could have protected the 165 pounder, suspending him like her necklace.

They think it might have been an accident, and he doesn't know what he's doing. Walter shocks Peter with static electricity to demonstrate a fraction of what they're dealing with. Fun with wool socks on carpet.

Francis and the team start looking for small events.

Sparky Man, Joseph (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), goes home to his cranky mother, Flora (Marylouise Burke). He tells her about the ad he responded to. They did tests, hypnotizing him, re-aligning the electrical impulses of his brain. He's freaking out. The lights in the apartment go out, so does is mother's presumably pacemaker-powered heart. He packs and runs. On his way out he runs into Dr. Fisher and a henchman. Fisher says they're there to adjust his medication. Before he can ask too many questions, Henchman shoots him with a dart.

The team keeps looking, someone gets a call. The conveyor malfunction at Bicoastal Parcel. Francis recognizes the name. Joseph Meegar from BCP signed into the security sheet at the elevator building.

Francis and Dunham go to his apartment and find his short-circuited mother. It was a Pacemaker, she tells Peter over the phone. Walter wants to know about nearby gadgets. He's intrigued by the boom box she mentions. Olivia can come home, Walter knows how to find him.

At the lab, Walter puts a tape in a stereo and explains the unique magnetic fingerprint Joseph has and how it would have magnetized the tape with his signature. He looks at soundwaves and isolates Joseph's. He wants to use birds to track him.

Joseph wakes up in a lab with metal nodes on his temples. He's strapped down. A man injects him with something.

At the lab, Walter attempts to program the pigeons with Joseph's signature, hopefully not Kentucky Frying them. He turns a dial and after some Frankenstein-like electric sparks, he's ready to put GPS on the pigeons. Olivia goes for a soda in the hall and sees John again. He says she listened. She says he's not real and tells him to stay the hell away from her, but he kisses her instead. He says he didn't betray her.

Peter comes around the corner to see Olivia standing there alone.

Peter and Olivia wait for the releasing of the birds. They open the cages. The birds go nowhere. Walter whistles and they fly. ""Are you sure this is going to work?"" Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) asks him. ""Of course not,"" he says with glee. Back in the lab, they watch the GPS dots on a map, telling Peter and Olivia where to go.

Meanwhile, Fisher is doing something to Joseph that hurts his head. Fisher tells him the probes can be removed later. Fisher rhapsodizes about what science hath wrought while Joseph whimpers.

The birds stop.

Henchman tells Dr. Fisher they have visitors. He tells Hench to move Joseph.

Olivia tells Peter to wait in the car. Francis breaks a window to get in while Henchman puts Joseph in a car. Joseph appears much more in tune with his power and starts the car, running over Henchman.

Olivia and the team confront Dr. Fisher, who denies knowing Joseph. As someone arrests Fisher, Olivia goes after Joseph and soon finds him. As they run through a lot full of cement mixers and other big trucks they turn on as Joseph passes. He also shorts a power line, blocking Olivia. Just when it seems like he's going to get away, Peter steps from behind a parked school bus and takes Joseph out with a crowbar.

Paramedics take Joseph away, heavily sedated. Olivia tells Joseph they're going to help him, but they can't let him go home and she's going to have a lot of questions.

In the lab, Walter forgets Farnsworth's name for the 1,000 time. He tells Olivia that Peter is returning the pigeons. He asks her if she's OK. She says she hasn't been sleeping. She starts to say something else, but stops. She turns to leave.

""You've been seeing him, your friend, John Scott,"" Walter says. He says there's a reason, but they're not hallucinations.

He says he believes when she was in the mindmeld tank part of John's consciousness crossed over into her and it's still there. He says the visions are her mind expelling John, exorcising his thoughts. But he doesn't know if John will go away.

Olivia drives home, passing John walking down the street. She pulls over and gets out, following him down dark, spooky stairs to a locked door. She shoots it open and goes in.

Through a dark hallway, she follows flashes of him, coming upon a room full of files.

With the team on site later, Broyles tells her back in the office that the files were John's, doing his own investigating into the Pattern. He knew more about Fisher than they did, even IDing seven other sparky test subjects who hadn't been activated yet. Fisher is now stewing in solitary.

Broyles gives Olivia John's personal effects, including some apparently intended for her. He leaves and she opens the tackle box. It contains childhood photos and...an engagement ring, inscribed ""Always."""

A van pulls up in the middle of the night and two men in full HAZMAT protective suits throw a woman in the middle of the street. She walks dazedly down the street and into a diner.

She sits at the counter and coughs. A man brings her some soup and tells the chef to call ""Marty"" (Wiliam Hill) because there's a woman there who might be in trouble and need help. The woman has marks on her wrists. The man asks what happened but she says nothing.

Marty, a cop, walks in and sits next to her and starts talking. She says she was born in Boston. She doesn't remember where home is, ""they did things."" She says they gave her a red medicine, but she doesn't know what it is. There was also a blue one. They confused her and hurt her. She doesn't want to go with Marty. He says she's not in trouble but when she resists, he handcuffs her. He calls it in and people in the diner start bleeding from their eyes and screaming. It happens to the woman too, and then her head explodes. Yep, that's right, explodes.

The Fringies hit the scene. Olivia (Anna Torv)'s ramped up, not entertained by Walter (John Noble)'s usual oddities. Broyles (Lance Reddick) briefs: all they know is that the people inside the now sealed off diner were exposed to high levels of radiation. The woman is Emily Kramer (Maria Dizzia), she hasn't been seen for two weeks. Her parents say she wouldn't have run away. The level of radiation coming from her body is three times higher than the others. Dr. Bishop would very much like to know where he can get a cool HAZMAT suit.

They suit up and go inside, where it's as gross as a place where a head exploded would be. Emily had some sort of rare incurable cancer which seems to be in remission, which is impossible.

Olivia meets with Emily's Dr. Patel (Alok Tewari) to ask about her treatment. It didn't include radiation. He gets her records.

At the lab, the Bishops perform an autopsy on headless Emily. They notice the marks on her wrists, indicating she was held. She has needle marks. Dr. B says she was being given drugs that he hasn't seen before.

Dr. B thinks maybe they were performing a field trial by letting her go.

Olivia gets a call as Dr. B is theorizing the people might try again with another woman.

Off to Acton, where Claire Williams (Marjan Neshat) has gone missing. She has the same disease. Olivia and Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) visit her husband. Waiting on the porch, Francis tries to empathize, noting it must be hard for her to deal with on that day, her birthday.

The husband doesn't know Emily. He describes how awful the disease was and then how it was like a miracle six weeks ago when her disease went away.

Cut to Claire in a lab with people in HAZMAT suits. They inject her with something as she lies strapped to a table.

A Goateed Man tells the woman treating her that the last one was a test, this one counts. Claire is an even better candidate, the woman says.

At the lab, Dr. B recreates the diner scene using a papaya dressed like Mr. Potato Head. He puts it under glass and it undergoes ""gooification,"" seeping fluids then exploding for a lab smoothie. It's like how a microwave cooks food, Peter (Joshua Jackson) says, declining Dr. B's offer to recreate the experiment on a gerbil.

He thinks there are microscopic capsules in Emily's blood that allowed her to cook people and also saved her life. Like time-release chemo. Olivia mentions that 83 percent of kidnapped victims are taken by someone they know. She and Peter visit Emily's parents.

In the car there Peter wonders if this using people for experiments is part of the Pattern. Peter suggests waiting because her family is mid-wake. Olivia, in a snit still, is having none of it. She goes upstairs and starts going through Emily's things. Her mom busts in, but listens when Olivia mentions Claire's name. They were in the same support group. A photo of Emily with Claire and her husband proves he was lying about knowing her.

Back at his house he says Claire and Emily were treating themselves along with other rich patients. He says they found the cure three months ago, time-release radioactive capsules. He didn't tell Olivia because he was afraid they'd stop him. Their doctor knew about it.

Back with Claire, the woman injects her red medicine, but also something blue that will ""make her special.""

Olivia revisits Dr. Patel. He says all he did was give ""them"" updates, the drug company. She wants names, instead he turns around and pulls a gun on her. He says the name ""Dr. David Esterbrook (Chris Eigemman),"" then he blows his head off.

Olivia goes back to the office, watching a suicide not making her birthday happy. She riffles through her mail. Francis tells her he found Esterbrook, with Intrepus drug company. It's Goatee Man. The company is looking into prenatal gene therapy, human-animal hybridization, all the fun stuff.

He's in Manhattan speaking on a humanitarian aid forum. Olivia doesn't expect him to confess, but wants to see it in his eyes. She introduces herself to him, pretending to be a science groupie. She chats him up about the boundaries of science being pushed and he says the only limitation isn't money, but resolve. She says she wasn't entirely honest, she knows Dr. Patel. She tells him he's dead and she already got what she wanted from her ruse. He says that she probably wants to start a family some day and it'd be shame if anything got in her way.

Broyles gets a call.

At the lab, Broyles intercepts Olivia. He's not impressed that she tried to intimidate a suspect in a high-profile place. She says Esterbrook is guilty and assumes he'll get away with it. She couldn't give a damn about politics. He says she should, because she's endangered their whole mission.

Claire, still strapped to the table, watches as someone lets a hairless rat loose in the room with her. Esterbrook walks into the observation room and asks for a progress report. The woman tells him Claire will be ready to go in the morning. He says he'll call the client. The rat explodes.

Olivia can't find anything on Esterbrook. Peter checks on her and her snideness ticks him off. She apologizes and tells him how her step-father beat her mother and she never called the police. One day when Olivia was nine, he broke her mom's nose then drove off. When she heard him coming back, she got his gun and shot him. But he lived and disappeared. Every year on her birthday he sends her a card and she blames herself for not finishing him.

Peter says all Olivia has to do to get Esterbrook is talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), Massive Dynamic must have corporate espionage on Intrepus. But she can't do that.

Peter leaves.

He finds Nina at an equestrian center. She knows who he is. He lays out his theory of human testing. He asks, hypothetically, where Intrepus might be conducting its research. She tells him she and his dad were ""quite close"" when they were much younger.

Then she offers him a deal: she'll give him the location but someday he, with his odd but valuable connections around the world, will have to return it at a future date.

In the lab, Dr. B smells the hyacinth scent he detected in headless Emily's body. He figures out the compound, it would be blue. He thinks they were using her as a weapon and the compound was the trigger. He says he can make a cure.

Peter finds Olivia and gives her the address of the facility where Claire is being held. He tells her he has a friend who tracked it down because radioactive isotopes are detectable by heat-sensing spy satellites and he has a friend who hacked in, or something. Olivia relays that bit of news to Charlie on the phone and Dr. B overhears and starts to correct her that they aren't visible from heat signatures, but Peter cuts him off. Dr. B gives her the antidote in a syringe and they prep for a tactical assault.

Later on site, they bust in shooting. Olivia finds the woman in the basement. She flips a radioactive switch. Claire starts to convulse in the other room and Olivia, sealed off from outside, puts the needle through a small door. As Claire flops around and her head starts pounding, Olivia commands her to jab the needle in her neck. When her eyes start bleeding, Claire musters the courage and jabs away. Her radiation levels return to normal.

At Intrepus, Olivia confronts Esterbrook, who denies knowing who Claire is. Olivia tells her his employee, Elizabeth (Jane Kim), confessed. He says the words of a disgruntled employee don't count for anything. She responds by telling him she's tipped off the media and his board of directors won't be pleased to see him involved in a murder investigation.

Back at the office, Olivia goes through her mail. She visits Broyles, who has heard about her stunt with Esterbrook. She defends being emotional, putting aside that it's what men always say about the woman they work with (she actually says that, awesome), but says it's what makes her good at her job. She says she hopes he won't fire her. He says she's not getting off that easy but he'll see her tomorrow.

Cut to Nina Sharp in her limo, listening to a news report about Intrepus and Esterbrook that mentions it's good news for their competitors, Massive Dynamic, whose stock has risen.

Olivia hears it and visits the Bishops. She talks with Peter, saying she knows where he got his info. She wants to know the price, what Nina wanted. He says he can handle it. She thanks him.

He says there was no letter today, was there? No.

At home, Olivia finds a letter under her door - no stamp. It's unsigned and says only: ""Thinking of You."""
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248547/?ref_=ttep_ep7,,An FBI agent experiencing huge pain is brought to a hospital where it is discovered that there is a strange parasite wrapped around his heart.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Brad Anderson'],"['', '', '']",[],"['climbing out a window', 'supernatural thriller', 'scientist', 'supernatural drama', 'supernatural mystery', 'secret', 'supernatural power', 'fbi agent', 'investigation', 'government agent', 'fbi', 'antihero', 'female agent', 'mad scientist', 'father son relationship', 'strange happening', 'female fbi agent', 'dysfunctional family', 'genius', 'heroine', 'suspense', 'intelligent man', 'conspiracy', 'parasite', 'extreme close up', 'limousine', 'adrenaline', 'cow', 'passionate kiss', 'variac', 'polaroid camera', 'drafting compass', 'rant', 'speaking german', 'frankfurt germany', 'cipher', 'glove box', 'chewing gum', 'ambulance', 'defibrillation', 'police boat', 'thought transference', 'code word']",[],"Weymouth, Mass. A boat on the water approaches its target, surveilling through night vision. A truck rounds the corner. The FBI swarms the truck. They open the back, in which they find...nothing useful.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) meets with the team leader, who briefs him on Joseph Smith, the guy involved. Agent Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly) suddenly collapses on the floor and starts convulsing. They take him to the ER. Broyles reassures Loeb's wife, Jessica (Trini Alvarado).

Doctors shock him to no avail and then open him up. They split open his ribs, his heart starts beating and then the doctor and nurses see something exceptionally gross, a bug-like parasite surrounding his heart. Ew.

Olivia (Anna Torv) and the Bishops are briefed by Broyles. The ""thing"" isn't communicable. Broyles tries to prepare Walter (John Noble) for what he's about to see. The man, Broyles' friend, is still alive.

Walter finds it ""spectacular."" It's partly organic. It looks like Audrey from ""Little Shop of Horrors"" wrapped around the dude's ticker, except gray.

They take Loeb back to Harvard. Walter can't examine the parasite until it's removed from Loeb. Also, Walter would like some gum, or perhaps a mint. Olivia speaks with Jessica Loeb, who wants to know why her husband was transferred there.

Loeb was recently on a mission in Frankfurt. Jessica gives Olivia a list of numbers he brought back with him.

Walter tries to cut into the thing, but it chomps down more on Loeb's heart. Peter (Joshua Jackson) injects him with something while Walter goes to examine a tissue sample of the parasite. Loeb stabilizes.

Walter says the parasite is of human design. He found a repeating pattern in the DNA sequence, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) thinks it might be a code, the ""Caesar shift,"" a simple alphabetical code. Astrid throws out some letters.

Olivia recognizes the sequence ZFT. Off to Broyles. She remembers something from Loeb's file. Broyles recognizes it. A man was arrested in Germany in possession of state secrets. Loeb was investigating a Mr. Jones (Jared Harris) of ZFT. (Honestly, it could be EFT, they don't enunciate.) There's a lot about the Pattern Olivia doesn't know, Broyles says. There are privately funded cells in 83 countries that traffic in scientific progress. The thing they found in Loeb could be one of those experiments. But they're not allowed to see Jones.

Olivia begs to differ. She's off to Germany.

At Harvard, Loeb is dehydrated. Peter sees something in his IV, a root of the parasite spreading up through Loeb's arm.

In Germany, Olivia meets up with Lucas Vogel (Bunya Nakamura), a man from her military past who has contacts.

Wissenchaft Prison, Germany They show up at the prison when Lucas introduces her to the warden. Lucas speaks some German. Olivia says it's very important to her and she'd sign anything. Then she speaks some German to sell her point. The warden warns her Mr. Jones speaks with no one. She asks the warden to pass him a note.

Broyles thanks Walter for his work. Walter responds by talking about fruit cocktail, which prompts Broyles to go talk to Peter, who explains that Walter becomes fixated on certain foods. He acknowledges Walter is, shall we say, a pineapple short of a fruit cocktail.

Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) calls. They discovered the paper Loeb brought back has number corresponding to cases and agents out of the Boston office. Another mole? One of the names is the same Joseph Smith whom Loeb was briefing Broyles on when he collapsed.

Broyles sents SWAT to Smith's address.

Olivia and Lucas wait at the prison. He's happy to see her again. The warden comes out. Mr. Jones will see her, but not until tomorrow morning. And only for 14 minutes. He gave her a note.

She calls Peter. Jones wants to talk to Joseph Smith first. They need him alive.

Peter races there. They're radio silent.

The SWAT team advances. Peter rolls up in his beat-up station wagon, but no one will listen to him. With Olivia on the phone, Peter watches helplessly as Smith comes out of his window, drops to the ground then pulls a gun. And is then taken out with a bullet to the head. Oh dear.

Peter briefs Broyles, explaining his men just killed their bargaining chip. Astrid calls Peter for Walter, then hands the phone over. ""Hello, Peter, this is me, your father, Walter Bishop."" ""Thank you, Walter, I know who you are."" ""Excellent,"" Walter says. He thinks they need to talk to Mr. Smith. Peter informs him he's dead. Walter inquires if Mr. Smith's head is still attached. He tells Peter to bring him in.

Lucas says good-bye to Olivia at the airport. He asks her to spend the night. Peter calls, checking if Jones knows if Smith is dead. No.

At the lab, they prep for something. But Walter's perturbed that Mr. Smith was shot in the head. He'll need to alter the procedure. They put Smith in ice and salt water, chilling him to slow degeneration. They attach wires to his brain to run an electrical current. Walter says the FBI wanted to use the procedure in 1975 on a murder victim named James, maybe Jimmy. A union leader. Jimmy Hoffa, Peter suggests. Yes, that was it. But Hoffa's electrical tolerance was low and he fried his brain. Peter remembers Walter did the same thing on him with a car battery when he was a kid.

They zap him. The circuit blows.

Olivia shares a glass of wine with Lucas. He asks who broke her heart, or is he misreading her. She tells him about Agent Scott.

Lucas says he knows he screwed up with Olivia. He was scared.

He takes her face in his hands and kisses her gently. She pulls away, starting to say she can't. But then, she can. And does.

The phone interrupts Olivia, Peter saying he thinks the dead guy will answer questions.

Olivia tells Lucas she's going back to the hotel.

The next day, Peter is hooked up to Mr. Smith's brain. They get nothing from the first two zaps.

Olivia's 14 minutes with Jones begin. He tells her she's made two incorrect assumptions: that there is nothing more valuable than his freedom and he is responsible for the infection of agent Loeb.

At the lab, Walter thinks Peter's brain functions are interfering with receiving the dead guy's thoughts. He injects his son with a sedative and something to make him euphoric.

Mr. Jones suggests he and Olivia are being manipulated and asks if she believes her people are loyal.

Broyles and Loeb's wife come into the lab to see Peter and dead guy hooked to a machine and Loeb under plastic.

Mr. Jones wants them to ask Mr. Smith where ""the gentleman lives."" Before they can ask the dead guy, Loeb starts to crash and Astrid (or ""Asteroid"" as Walter calls her) hangs up on them. Peter hears nothing after the first zap. They increase the voltage.

Peter calls for paper as Olivia is being told her time with Jones is up. Peter draws a series of lines on paper. But it means nothing to him.

Olivia is, presumably, ordered out of the cell in German. They try to make sense of the six then five sets of lines. Walter theorizes that the part of Smith's brain processing horizontal lines may be zapped. Peter fills them in and produces ""Little Hill.""

Olivia relays the message and Mr. Jones tells her the chemicals to inject Loeb with. It works.

In the car with Lucas, Olivia puzzles over Jones' insinuations about loyalty. Lucas says he has other means of getting at Jones. He offers to give it a try.

Back at the hospital, Broyles asks a recovering Loeb if he knows of any other double agents besides Scott. He doesn't.

Olivia shows up at the hospital, wanting answers about Little Hill and everything else. Broyles tells her he could tell her to quit asking questions and get some sleep. Instead, he says that's what makes her a good agent.

A woozy Peter greets her. They decide they're thirsty while soaking up the sweet reunion of the Loebs.

When they walk away, Mrs. Loeb tells her husband what they did worked. Mr. Jones asked the question. She leans close and tells him the answer: ""Little hill."""

His dad objects, saying Ben (Charlie Tahan) was supposed to take a break from the music. Dad (Adam Grupper) hears yelling and pulls over to see a woman under an umbrella. Her car is dead. He calls for a tow, reading her plate. He offers to look under her hood. He sees flashing red and green lights, flashing in time. They mesmerize him. Suddenly the tow truck driver is there and his and the woman with hers is gone. So is his son.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) tells Olivia (Anna Torv) about the man's claim time ""just jumped."" Naturally, it's not the first time it's happened. Three other cases have the same claims. The first was found, the others not so good. One victim tried to lobotomize herself with a butter knife. The other victims are academics, unlike the 10 year old. Walter (John Noble) remembers flashing red and green lights, but that's all.

Highland, Conn. They visit the father, who swears he's not crazy. Olivia tells dad the other victims were experts in their fields. He says his son was, too. He explains his wife was killed crossing the street nine months ago. Ben was hit. When he woke up... the dad puts in a DVD.

Ben plays piano like a prodigy. Doctors attributed it to brain trauma. He became fixated on music.

Ben sits, chained in a darkened room, tapping his food. A woman checks on him, asking how he's doing. He says he wants to go home. But someone else is there to see him instead. His mother, the dead one.

Harvard Walter works on the flashing red and green lights to try to jar his memory. That's not working, but he has a theory on how the boy was taken. He was once hired to create flashing lights that could hypnotize. His old experiment failed, but he thinks the green and red were key. Walter tests on Peter (Joshua Jackson), who announces it doesn't work. But then he awakes to find it's lunch time and his shirt sleeves have been cut off, Chachi-style.

Francis (Kirk Acevedo) calls Dunham, telling him the woman from the sketch, Joane Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), died 10 years ago when her car went off a bridge - eight months before any abductions. Either she survived or they're chasing a ghost.

Walter sings Christmas carols hoping it'll jog his memory about the lights. ""Dashing through the snow"" brings him to Dashiell Briggs (Randall Duk Kim), a fellow inmate from St. Claire's asylum.

Dunham tells Broyles they think Briggs might be another victim. Walter remembers him telling a story about being put to sleep by a woman with a Christmas tree. He later killed his wife. He was also a defense contract consultant, which means it'll take forever to get permission to talk to him.

The woman leads Ben down a basement hallway full of pipes and tubes to a locker room with a piano and sheet music. He turns around and sees his mom.

Olivia tells Peter about nasty Dashiell and Walter thinks of him as his ""old friend."" He recognizes an equation from the crime scene photos, scribbled on the walls. Dashiell was obsessed with it, like Ben with the music.

Peter thinks Dashiell's equation might be music, 'cuz he's smart like that. He converts the fractions to notes and plays a quiet, melancholy tune. It's Ben's song. But what are they both trying to solve?

Ben tries to figure out why he can see and hug his dead mom. She tells him to finish the song like the woman wants.

St. Claire's hospital.

Olivia returns, wanting to talk to a Dashiell. But the head dude, Dr. Sumner (William Sadler), remembers her as the one who took Walter and says he has no business being out among ""the rest of us."" He says subjecting them to interrogation isn't good for them. But he'd like to help, really.

He suggests an alternative: He'll allow Walter Bishop to talk to Briggs.

At the lab, Peter tries to keep Olivia from sending Walter back to the loony bin. They talk about Walter as if he's not in the room, which he objects to. He also says he'd rather not go back. But he will, for the little boy.

Creepy head guy greets Walter with the look of a man hoping he'll crack. He leads Walter back among the loons. He has 10 minutes with Briggs, who doesn't recognize him at first.

Walter rags on the doctors in medical-speak, which Briggs enjoys. Walter asks to hear his story about the green and red lights. Briggs says he doesn't know what Walter's referring to. He wants to finish his butterscotch pudding in peace.

Walter grabs a crayon and starts writing Briggs's formula on a table top. Briggs says mathematical formulations are not conducive to his mental stability. He starts yelling. Walter presses Briggs and they start struggling. The head guy instructs someone to sedate Walter.

Sumner explains to Peter and Olivia what he's done, saying he has a responsibility to hold Walter. They're welcome to get a court order saying otherwise.

Back in his cell, Walter reverts to singing ""Row, row your boat"" again on his lone cot.

He pictures himself talking to him.

Dunham gets a call from general counsel, who tells her the court order should be ready in the morning.

Peter has some ideas for aliases Joanne Ostler would have used, variations on hotel names. Apparently ""Ostler"" is middle English for ""inn keeper"" which gets him to Joanne Ritz, in Clarksburg.

Ben plays while his mother cheers him on. But Ben doesn't know how it ends. His mom starts bleeding and starts looking battered. Joanne tells him if he loses her again, he'll only have himself to blame. Trauma as incentive.

Walter chats with Briggs while seeing himself across the yard. He tells Briggs about the missing boy. Briggs says the woman promised him what he wanted most of all, but when he couldn't solve the equation, she took it away. Flash to Ben going through the same thing.

She filled his mind with images of people he loved and then tortured them, but he couldn't give her what she wanted. Briggs starts breaking down, saying none of it happened and it was a bad dream. He doesn't remember where he was other than a dungeon in a red castle.

Sumner tells Peter he's making a terrible mistake. He's going to petition the state to have him removed from Peter's custody. Peter replies Sumner has no idea what he's capable of. When Sumner asks if Peter is making threats, silence. However, the look of Peter's face is answer enough.

Peter goes to see his dad, who is calm and says he'd like to go now. He's haunted by talking to Dashiell. He asks Peter if that's what it's like to talk to him.

Agent Francis canvasses Clarksburg with Olivia. Peter calls her and mentions the red castle with a dungeon Walter got from Kim. Olivia turns and sees a shuttered red carousel. Inside, Francis and Olivia head downstairs. Olivia ends up in the same hallway Ben was in before.

She finds Ben strapped into a machine. She starts to look for how to unhook him when Joanne comes at her from behind. Ben wakes up to see them fight. They crash around the lab until Joanne runs off and Oliva points her gun at her. Joanne flips a remote switch and lights start flashing red and green. Olivia freezes and what seems like seconds later Francis finds her still in the hallway alone.

Back at their hotel, Walter tells Peter he thinks he's ready for his own room. Peter tells Walter what he did going back into St. Claire's was very brave.

Joanne brings the equation to parasite-free Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly).

He plugs the numbers into a computer and puts a red apple in a safe. Their black box starts humming and thumping with his hand inside it. He pulls out the apple previously in the safe. It worked.

He celebrates by killing Joanne with a shot to the chest.

He calls someone to relay the good news.

At HQ, Ben is reunited with his dad."

Walter explains psychosomatic effects, things the body does to itself. They watch old 8 mm of Walter with a test subject under hypnosis. He tells him an ice cube is a burning coal and presses it to the man's skin. It blisters.

The substance Walter couldn't ID in Mark Young was a hallucinogen from a bufo toad. Walter thinks it's a clever means of murder because the potency was 30 times the amount anyone would ingest on purpose. Astrid did a records search on the basement where Olivia found the toads but couldn't find an owner.

Olivia tells Walter about learning the address from John Scott. He says Scott's memories are trapped in her head. She wants to know how long it'll last. It could last for many years. She wants to get it out.

He suggests a form of repressed memory therapy but, she guesses, she'd have to go back in the tank. And he'd advise against that. She'll do it.

Peter watches Tess enter an apartment with a man. Astrid calls, telling him to come back.

Walter preps Olivia. He plans to put her in deep hypnosis and give her a lot of drugs. His voice will be her ""tether"" to reality to avoid becoming lost in memories. She climbs into the tank in her undies.

Walter tells her to look for signs and mentions he'll be praying she doesn't get electrocuted. He guides her through it. She hears music, but sees nothing. Walter fiddles with the charges and she sees a door. She walks through it and ends up in a restaurant vaguely familiar. It's where she and John had their first date. She sees herself and John.

Peter arrives and Walter asks for his help adjusting the drugs. Walter tells Olivia it's just a memory and they can't see her, but she sits down opposite John anyway when memory her gets up. She tells him she loved him and asks if he ever had any feelings for her. He doesn't see her. She tells him Mark Young killed himself yesterday and John looks right at her as Walter says that's impossible. She leaps into John's car, alone. She gets out and sees John with three men, a black man, a Latino and one she can't see. The fourth is Mark Young. Young leaves with the Latino. John talks to the black man and Olivia watches in horror as John stabs the man. She flips out, screaming for Walter to get her out of there. Peter throws open the tank's doors.

Out of the tank, Olivia uses facial recognition software to create the Latino guy, the only living one of the four. She wants to get the picture to Charlie for an ID.

Peter offers to go with her to Broyles. But she wants to go alone. ""If you need me, I'm here,"" Peter tells her.

Olivia briefs Broyles about the black market hallucinogen which, in its potent form, could be used as a chemical weapon. They're going to need Massive Dynamic to disclose every project Mark Young was working on. Broyles will see what he can do.

Peter walks down the street outside Tess's place. When Michael comes out, Peter jumps him, beating him soundly. He sticks a gun in Michael's face and tells him if he touches her again, he'll kill him.

At FBI HQ, they try to ID the Latino from Olivia's sketch. Broyles gives her a list of Mark Young's projects, courtesy Nina. She looks at his number 877-8-MSSDYN It gives her and idea and she dials the numbers corresponding to MONARCH.

A Latino-sounding man answers. She recognizes his voice and tells Charlie, which he finds odd. They find the number is a land line forwarded to a cell. They track it. The name on the account is George Moralez (Yul Vasquez). He bought a plane ticket to Venezuela that morning. He's a drug trafficker. They're a few hundred yards behind him when he stops. He hit traffic. Olivia and Charlie get out of the car, guns drawn and search the stopped vehicles . A man sneaks out of a taxi. Olivia sees and races after him. He steps into the path of an oncoming car and rolls up the windshield.

At the hospital, George asks Olivia for a deal, but she doesn't know what he has to trade. They have him for trafficking in chemical weapons. He wants protection from Massive Dynamic. Why would he kill Mark? ""That guy was a treasure trove of unbelievable things. Massive Dynamic killed him."" He thinks it might have been a warning to other employees. Olivia thinks he's just saying what she wants to hear. ""Did I invent ZFD, flight 627, the Northwoods group, John Scott, the Pattern? The whole thing is a hoax so Massive Dynamic can do whatever it wants to whoever it wants.""

He says MD is hell and its founder William Bell is the devil. He thinks he can trust her because John Scott told him about her.

Olivia visits Nina Sharp at MD.

In his hospital bed, George repeatedly pushes his nurse's call button. Someone answers, but not who he wants.

Olivia tells Nina she thinks her cooperation is an illusion.

George freaks out, seeing a white-washed John Scott standing over him.

Nina guesses George is blaming MD. Olivia asks if Nina is protecting William Bell. Nina seriously doubts her witness will be able to provide any ""actionable evidence.""

George is beaten by what turns out to be an imagined John Scott: a nurse enters in time to see George's throat slitting itself.

Broyles calls Olivia and gives her the bad news. She accuses Nina and he tells her to keep her unfounded accusations in check.

Olivia pays a late night visit to Walter's hotel. She wants to go back into the tank. She has too many questions. He gives her a great speech saying there's little he likes more than taking drugs and giving them to others, but going in would be a bad idea. She insists John Scott saw her, but Walter says impossible. He asks for time to develop a safer technique and says good night.

Michael visits an older, bearded man (Tom Riss Farrell) and tells him Peter Bishop is back in town. The man is very interested to hear the news.

Olivia lays awake at night. Her computer turns itself on. She has a message from John: ""I saw you in the restaurant."""

On the way out, one gets stuck mid-wall as it hardens. The team leader, Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly), now free from heart parasites, shoots the poor stuck guy in the head, execution style.

The Fringies report to the scene. Broyles (Lance Reddick) says it's the third in a string of robberies. Even weirder, Olivia (Anna Torv) knows him. Raul Lugo (Angel David). He was in her first unit of the Marines. Walter (John Noble) says they'll have to get the guy out of the wall, maybe in pieces.

After the job, the team argues. They're trying to open the safety deposit box they stole. Mitchell Loeb tells the guy who objects they've got one box to go and he should inject himself and shut up.

Wissenschaft Prison, Germany Mr. Jones (Jared Harris) welcomes a Mr. Kohl (James Frain).

Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter shop in a big box hardware store, which boggles Walter's mind. Peter picks up on Walter implying Peter travels a lot and hasn't picked a direction. Peter plays the ""you've been in a mental institution, you don't know me"" card. They're looking for a circular saw to cut through bone and tissue, Walter helpfully over-informs the clerk.

Kohl, Mr. Jones' lawyer, tells him the best he can hope for his life. Mr. Jones asks if he has any news from his people. They say the job in Philadelphia was successful. He tells Kohl to have his people wire Loeb another $100,000 and tell him the location of the next ""item.""

Jones makes a list of the things he wants Kohl to bring on his next visit including sun tan lotion and Dramamine. He asks Kohl's suit size. He gives him his personal tailor's address.

Edison, New Jersey Olivia breaks the bad news to Susan (Rosa Arredondo), Raul's wife. He moved out two years ago and they hadn't spoke in months. The robberies are news to her. She doesn't remember Olivia at all, or that they've been to each other's houses. Olivia says they had dinner at Susan's house the night Raul became first lieutenant. Susan says Olivia wasn't there, but Olivia remembers everything about the place. But Susan says no: That day it was just her, Raoul and John, his friend from Camp Pendleton. John Scott.

At the lab, Peter catches body parts while Walter saws them out of the wall. Walter says the robbers would need cutting end knowledge of quantum science. Peter asks how Olivia's visit with Susan was and can tell something's wrong. She tells them she didn't recognize Raul, John did. Walter doesn't understand it.

One of the team of robbers tries to get into the super high security safe deposit box. Loeb won't let anyone on the team see what's in them. He says they wouldn't understand anyway. He opens it, thrilled.

At Massive Dynamic, Nina (Blair Brown) wants the people working on John Scott's corpse to try harder to get into his brain. He's their only advantage against a team of highly motivated individuals.

Walter thinks the netting left at the vault might be the key. He's using rice to prove his point. High frequency vibrations disrupted the wall's structure. Use of the technology can render someone radioactive.

Olivia reports the safety deposit boxes were all paid for in cash 23 years ago. The owners are untraceable. She tells Astrid (Jasika Nicole) to make sure the hospitals alert them if anyone comes in with signs of radiation poisoning. Meanwhile, she's going to try to track down people who knew Raul, starting with someone at a bar in Cambridge. Peter decides this mission calls for his particular skill set.

With no one paying attention to his demonstration, Walter makes use of his rice, placing a beaker full on a vibrating surface. It appears solid and supports the toy man atop. But when it's vibrated it shifts and the toy slips in. Cool, if anyone had been watching.

Olivia, as Stephanie, starts in with a double shot of whiskey with her brother ""Rick."" She asks the bartender if she knows him. She pretends to recognize Drew, from Raul and Susan's wedding. He says Raul got weird. He was in the Gulf War and hung around the VA a lot when he got back.

Olivia calls Broyles to find out what VA that was. It wasn't in his records. They have an hour. When Olivia is ready to go, Peter scoffs at her for chugging and leaving. ""Is that a dare?""

Loeb's team compare notes on him over a game of chess. One went through his bag and found a map in German. Loeb walks in and says they're heading to Providence. One guy tries to light his cigarette and shakes horribly.

Peter wows Olivia with card tricks, getting a card into a bottle. She responds by showing off her amazing card-counting skills. She's got a thing for numbers, can always remember them, including the ones from the safety deposit boxes: 233, 377, 610. Peter knows the numbers.

They run home and wake up Walter. He thinks they might need the room. Instead, Peter has recognized the numbers as what Walter recites as he falls asleep each night. The Fibonacci sequence. He starts to dismiss it as a coincidence and realizes something else: the boxes are his.

He can't remember where else they are or why he did it.

Broyles finds the VA Raul stayed in. He had no visitors. She thinks he might have been recruited by another patient.

Back as Massive Dynamic, they have found memory echos in John Scott showing the memories they need might be in Dunham's mind.

Olivia travels to the VA in D.C. She and the doctor play a back and forth game of confidentiality and classification of secrets. The doctor walks off and she starts to make a call when a nurse tells her about the chess club. There were four of them. He remembers their names.

Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) finds a record that the vets bought plane tickets getting them to Providence under an hour ago. Olivia calls Peter to run it by Walter, who feels awful he can't remember. As Walter and Astrid brush the cow (that's not a euphemism, there's a cow in the lab), Peter pauses for a moment and nonchalantly asks Walter what bank he'd go to in Providence if he needed to rent a safety deposit box. He instantly comes up with a name.

Dunham and Francis arrive at the bank, which reports no alarms. They find box 987, the next in the sequence, has been opened. They figure they went through the floor into the sewer. The team is loading into their van when Francis and Dunham round the corner, firing. They take off with one guy not yet loaded in. He runs after but falls when Olivia shoots him in the leg.

Back at their headquarters, one of the team is upset to have lost another man. He refuses to do anything until Loeb shows him what the thefts are all about. He shows them. It looks like a camera or a microscope.

Loeb calls someone and tells them over the phone they're ready and someone is coming that night.

Kohl brings Mr. Jones the requested items. He tells Kohl to come back with paperwork for his appeal tomorrow at 6:30 and to wear one of his lucky suits. He wants his people to get one last thing: Dunham.

She parks her car as someone conducts surveillance on her. She interrogates Ryan Eastwick (Paul Fitzgerald), who won't talk. Peter notices Eastwick's hands won't stop shaking. He tells Francis to call her out, he has an idea.

Peter goes in, bringing a cup of coffee and saying he doesn't think Eastwick will crack. He just wants to see his hands. He lays out some symptoms: shaking hands, vomiting, and hair falling out. Eastwick asks what's wrong with him. Radiation poisoning. He doesn't know the man who hired them or what they were stealing. He only knows he's going to a field in Westwood.

Consulting the map, they find Little Hill air strip, the code word Smith gave to Jones a few weeks ago.

At the lab, Walter goes through his things trying to figure out what he hid. Peter passes the time with simple sleight-of-hand magic tricks.

Walter looks on proudly, then tells Peter he nearly died as a child. His kidneys failed. The doctors didn't know what it was. They guessed a rare form of bird flu. In his research he discovered Dr. Albert Gross was the only one who had solved a case of that illness, but he'd died in the 1930s, so Walter conceived a device to retrieve anyone from anywhere in time. He thinks that's what was in the boxes. He never got to try it - Peter got better - but in theory it could work.

Little Hill Field Olivia is 10 minutes away as Loeb and his team set up the device, like surveyors using degrees for perfect alignment. It's 12:30 a.m.

In Germany, Kohl arrives for Jones. Without preamble, Jones snaps Kohl's neck then takes the suit off his body.

On the way to the field, a black SUV cuts Olivia off. She runs from her car but men in trench coats taser her. The device, complete with a ring about three feet in diameter is set up in the field.

Jones puts in eye drops and applies suntan lotion then goes to stand in the exact corner of his cell. A bright light shoots into the sky from the device. Olivia is out cold in the SUV. Light surround Jones. Loeb watches with anticipation. The walls around Jones start to shake and he disappears in a shaft of light... and reappears in a similar light in Little Hill.

Broyles calls Nina Sharp to tell her it appears Olivia was abducted. He implies she took her, but Nina protests. She's right.

Jones wastes little time basking in his leaping-through-space glory. He needs to get into the decompression chamber and checks to make sure they have Dunham. ""She didn't even put up a fight,"" Loeb tells him."

Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds it normal. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) comes in, announcing Olivia (Anna Torv) is missing.

Olivia wakes up strapped to a gurney being wheeled down a spooky darkened hallway where a man wearing a Halloween-style old man mask stands over her. He tells her: ""This won't take long."" ""I'm sure you tell that to all the girls,"" says the damsel, calm in distress. They flip her over.

Back at FBI HQ Broyles (Lance Reddick) sends out the hounds, telling everyone they're on Olivia's case.

Strapped hanging face-down on the gurney, Olivia memorizes the Italian loafers of what soon turns out to be her doctor. He sticks a needle in her spine.

Stepping away from Olivia, Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly) takes off his mask and heads back to the office.

Olivia asks the dude who remains, ""If you're going to kill me then could I please have some water?"" The guy brings it. She needs to sit up. He undoes her restraints, as she acts weak, parched and helpless. She drinks deeply, then smashes the guy in the head with the glass he brought her. Suddenly, Olivia is Rambo, throwing a surgical implement into the back of the other man in the room and kicking the tar out of both. All while dressed in a surgical gown.

Broyles gets a call from a man named Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston), saying Internal Affairs is sending him in to do a review of the Fringe Division.

Olivia creeps her way through the lab, examining samples and gross things in jars. She grabs a handful of samples, then some keys and a cell phone. She shoots a man who tries to follow her. She makes it outside and to the car, which she finds using the alarm, because she's cool like that.

She calls Broyles.

She was in a water tower. She asks him to send her agents. He asks if she's OK. ""Not yet I'm not.""

She pulls over and gets out, digging a hole in some construction dirt and burying a canister with the samples she stole inside. She starts to cry, but doesn't have time for that.

The back-up teams arrive. They agents get out and she starts to tell where she was being held. They draw their weapons and tell her to freeze. She turns to run but is shot with a tranquilizer.

She wakes up back in a hospital gown, but in a hospital this time. She's handcuffed to the bed and Harris is in the room. He asks her if his conviction was a point of pride for her. His conviction on sexual assault she so ably prosecuted was overturned. And this is who's been assigned to review Fringe Division. So he gets to question her sanity, loyalty and worthiness to serve.

Super. At least he's not biased.

He knows about John Scott (Mark Valley). And, Peter, who she tracked down in Iraq, and Walter, who spent time in a mental hospital on manslaughter charges. Doesn't sound very good on paper. A traitor, a criminal and a lunatic, he calls them.

She asks if she's under arrest. He doesn't answer, instead telling her she's not to investigate her own abduction. He tosses her keys to cuffs and leaves.

Olivia shows up for work. Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) tells her they went to the place she was being held and it was empty. The only prints on the phone and in the car were hers. She knows Harris is after her because she sent him away on three charges of sexual assault. There's a woman named Rachel (Ari Graynor) there to see her, her sister. She's there with her niece, Ella (Lily Pilblad), who gives Olivia a Magic 8 Ball. They're going to stay with her. They totally understand she has to work.

She calls Peter. He and Walter meet her outside with cases. She tells Walter about the electrodes they put on her head and what they did, and that she took something. She takes them back to the construction site and finds the container. She gives Walter the samples. He plays Mr. Wizard in the back of the SUV. He's not pleased he knows what it is.

At Boston College, a professor lectures about bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. He takes a drink and starts to convulse, collapsing on the ground. A TA performs CPR, but he dies right there in class. And then a big disgusting worm, lizard-slime thing crawls out of his mouth and oozes across the floor. Class dismissed!

Broyles calls Olivia and the Bishops into the classroom. Walter says it appears the man suffocated from within. ""Well maybe that's because a giant, slimy, spikey slug thingy came out of his mouth,"" Peter offers.

Walter has a theory, but he's not sharing.

Miles Kimberg (Stephen Schnetzer) was an immunologist. Peter uses some sort of thermal camera and finds the slimy spiky slug thing on the camera, but it's very fast. Walter traps it with a trashcan. ""Things like this used to happen in the lab all the time,"" he says. ""Makes me nostalgic.""

Back at the lab, Walter plays with his slimy spiky slug, craving a cheese steak. The organism was developed from the material Olivia stole from her captors.

Broyles confronts Harris, telling him what he did was unacceptable. Harris says the jury's out on Dunham and while he's on an active investigation the office is under his purview.

Olivia asks the TA, a young woman, if Kimberg mentioned anything unusual happening. Olivia takes about 45 seconds to figure out they were sleeping together. The TA 'fesses up. They were together for three months. She knew he was going to take a CDC job, a classified task force to oversee the country's preparedness to fight off an epidemic.

The other scientist asked was Russell Simon (Peter Jay Fernandez) at Cambridge. She tells Broyles about the evidence and the link. ""Why kill an epidemiologist unless you're going to start an epidemic?"" she muses.

Broyles tells her he's supposed to run things by Harris. He tells her to find Simon, he'll handle Harris.

Olivia grabs Charlie for the trip. On the way out, the man coordinating the investigation into her abduction stops her to make sure everything about it was in her debrief. It's Mitchell Loeb.

Olivia finds Simon and brings him back to HQ. He says only his wife knew he was taking the job. Harris interrupts the interview, saying he hasn't approved putting Simon in protective custody. Olivia says Broyles didn't approve her request. She tells him he doesn't have to like her, just do the right thing. Harris agrees to keep Simon safe.

Peter calls. The slimy slug seems to be activated by a liquid, stomach acid. All you have to do is drink the virus and voila. Mitchell Loeb takes Simon a glass of water in the interview room. Charlie goes to check on him and the convulsions begin. Out comes to the slimy spiky slug thing. Charlie shoots it.

Back at the lab, Walter says the slug is a single cell of the virus for the common cold. Peter is stuck on why they needed Olivia. When Olivia offers she has no idea who cares about her, she just wants to find out who's killing people, Peter says he cares about her. Walter takes note.

At Olivia's house, she tries to cook for her sister. She asks Rachel if she's heard from Greg. No. She says they can stay there as long as they want. She looks at her sister for a moment and asks if there's something else she's not telling her. No. Olivia doesn't seem to believe her.

At HQ, Mitchell Loeb checks in with Olivia, reassuring her they'll find whoever responsible. He picks her Magic 8 Ball up off the desk but drops it. When she bends down to pick it up she gets a second close view of his Italian loafers.

She asks to talk to Charlie. She tells him it's Mitchell Loeb. She says she can prove it, but she needs his help.

Olivia arrives at Loeb's house. No one appears to be home. She peers in the window.

At the lab, Walter doses the slug with decongestant (""She is a giant cold virus, after all"") and Charlie stops in for Peter, telling him Olivia needs help, but he can't do it. ""Sometimes the problem with being in law enforcement,"" Charlie says, ""is you gotta obey the law yourself."" ""And you think I'm the guy to break the law for you?"" Peter deadpans. Charlie starts to apologize when Peter cuts him off, ""No, you're right, I am the guy to break the law for you, what do we need?"" A wiretap on Mitchell Loeb, FBI.

Back at Loeb's house, Olivia starts to pick the lock when Loeb's wife Samantha (Trini Alvarado) surprises her. Caught neatly red-handed, she makes up a lame story about dropping by to see how Samantha was doing after Mitchell's surgery. Samantha invites her in for some tea.

As they chat, Samantha asks what she was doing in town. Olivia says she's working on a case. Suspicion of a double agent. Samantha suddenly seems less inclined to share tea. Olivia excuses herself to the bathroom.

Peter calls a friend who used to work at the phone company to tap the phone.

Samantha calls Mitchell. The tap isn't working, so they don't hear Mitchell tell his wife she needs to kill Olivia, ""right now.""

Olivia goes through the Loeb's papers, looking for evidence. Mitchell tells his wife Olivia's already under suspicion for being unstable.

Peter tries the tap again.

Olivia finds a file with the slimy spiky slug in it. Peter taps in in time to hear Mitchell telling his wife where to find a gun in the house. Peter hangs up and calls Olivia, who quietly puts away the files she found. She sees Peter is calling and answers. He tells her Samantha is going to kill her and to get out of the house.

Mitchell leaves HQ. Samantha creeps down the hall, gun in hand. Olivia gets the drop on her and makes her drop the gun. Samantha starts crying and babbling, apologizing and advancing on Olivia, who waits just a second too long to shoot her. A chick fight breaks out. Samantha is winning until she throws Olivia across the room and both go to their guns and fire. Samantha's shot ends up in the coffee table. Olivia's ends up in Samantha's forehead.

At the office, Olivia, Broyles, Francis and the Bishops examine Mitchell's computer, which has been wiped clean.

Peter gets an idea. Mitchell doesn't know his wife is dead, he points out. She could still contact him. They send him a text to meet at a payphone. Olivia and the Bishops, Francis and Broyles wait. Walter tells Olivia that Peter was really worried about her when she was gone. Really worried.

Mitchell pulls up and goes to the phone. They pull up to apprehend him. Just to keep him in place, Olivia shoots him in the arm. Then he leers at her. Perhaps remembering his recent exploratory medical procedure on her spine, she whacks him across the face. Peter approves.

They interrogate Mitchell, who sits stone faced. He wants to see his wife.

Harris watches, sure that Olivia won't get a confession.

Olivia asks him what her spinal tap was all about. She tells him it's his last chance. ""Or what? You'll torture me?"" he says.

Olivia asks to be left alone. She takes out a photo of his wife and shows it to him. She tells him who pulled the trigger. He's looking at her. She asks again if he killed the scientists. Yes, he shouts.

""Do you not understand the rules? What we're up against? Who the two sides are? Tell me at least you understand that,"" he says. She doesn't. ""We had a plan here, lady. And you just blew it."" He tells her they saved her, they were going to let her go. ""You have no idea what you've done, not a clue."" Olivia looks like she might believe him.

Peter turns, smug on Olivia's behalf, to Harris. There's his confession.

Olivia talks to Peter about what Mitchell said about saving her. Even Walter agrees, crazy to crazy, Mitchell is off balance. Peter tells her Mitchell only said that to get a reaction. He tells her to go home. Walter says he was worried too when she was taken.

At home, Olivia is sacked out with her niece. Her sister puts a blanket over them and turns out the light."

Cut to credits.

Olivia (Anna Torv) plays Operation with her niece, Ella (Lily Pilblad), who's still saying there with her mom Rachel (Ari Graynor), Liv's sister.

At Harvard, Walter Bishop (John Noble) rags on Darwin. Peter (Joshua Jackson) half-listens as he looks at the mail. He looks at a letter hand-addressed to his dad.

Olivia calls Astrid (Jasika Nicole), telling her to get the guys outside, ready to examine a body she's dropping off. Peter tosses the letter to his dad in the trash. With the boys gone, Astrid looks at the note.

With the grieving parents, Olivia and Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) ask if they noticed anything odd. He didn't use drugs and he only had asthma. He spent all his free time on the computer. The parents mention his friend, Luke Dempsey (Noah Fleiss).

At the lab, Walter saws open the poor boy's head. Walter reports that his brain matter was completely liquefied. Astrid checks the boy's computer. She notices something wrong, the hard drive is toast. She'll keep on it.

Olivia goes to talk to Luke. She finds him at a garage, working on a car. (Possible Observer sighting behind him.) He was IM'ing with Greg (Jake O'Connor) last night.After a few hours Greg stopped answering. Their dads worked together when they were kids.

Olivia gets a call about another body.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) is there. The victim is the general manager of a car dealership. They find him with caked brains oozed out his nose. So, closed coffin. Olivia talks to the guy who found him. They were at a strip club last night. Olivia doesn't judge.

Walter jams a swab up the corpse's nose, grossing out Peter.

At the lab, Astrid shows Olivia the fused platters they found on Greg's computer are just like the toasted ones on the car salesman's computer. They both downloaded huge files before they melted.

There's a ringing. It's the lab phone. They didn't know it even worked. Peter answers, and gets upset, saying there's no one there by that name. He hangs up.

Peter has a guy who can help with the computers. Olivia doesn't want to know who. Astrid stops Olivia after Peter walks out. She thinks she might know who was on the phone. She shows Olivia the note.

Peter meets with his computer friend, who isn't exactly thrilled to see him. Peter shows him a coin. Akim (Gbenga Akinnagbe) can't believe he kept it. Akim can have it back, but first Peter needs some help.

Akim works on the computer parts.

At HQ, Olivia is intercepted by Agent Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston), who wants to know what she's up to. He wants her to pass the case on to the CDC. She's already talked to them. It doesn't look like flu. He thinks it looks like another excuse to justify the allocation of FBI resources to a rogue division. He's there to remedy that. She has 12 hours before he takes the case away.

Akim finds an ""insanely complex"" program sent by someone trying very hard to cover their tracks.

Olivia cross references the two cases.

Akim can't tell Peter where it originated, but it's being downloaded right now in Brighton, a neighborhood in Boston. He pulls up the address. Peter recognizes it. He calls Olivia.

It's happening again right now. In her apartment.

Ella turns on her computer to paint a pony.

Olivia races home, dialing. Her sister doesn't hear the phone. Ella picks a pick pony.

They're five minutes out when Ella gets the ""What's that noise?"" message. The images start flashing. Ella looks deeply. Her mom cooks in the other room, unaware. Olivia tears down the street. The hand starts to come out of the laptop. Olivia pulls up and busts in the door. She pulls her niece away from the screen, but Ella remains catatonic for a moment. Then she blinks and asks her aunt Olivia when she got there.

While Olivia talks to Charlie, Peter plays with Ella and talks to Olivia's sister. Ella remembers a ""weird, floaty and scary"" hand that came at her. Her mom doesn't believe her. Olivia checks out the laptop. There's a green light at the top but the screen is black.

Somewhere, a man looks back, telling her he's the one she's looking for. He's startled by someone coming in. It's his son Luke. Greg's friend Luke.

He asks if his dad has found a job yet. He's not looking. But he's working on a computer program that he thinks will really impress people.

At HQ, Olivia checks in with the doctor, who says Ella is doing fine. She tells Broyles and Peter she thinks someone was watching, the camera light was on. They think they might be dealing with a computer program that can kill people. Peter wants to know why.

In a house outside Chicago, a woman calls for someone named Mark (Randy Kovitz) to help her with the groceries. She checks on him and finds him slumped over at his computer, brains on his shirt.

Charlie calls Olivia, telling her the next death is a day trader nowhere near Boston. Walking across campus, Peter sees a middle-aged woman and goes to talk to her. He asks if she's Jessica Warren (Mary Beth Peil). He read the letter. He understands why she wants to see Walter, but he says Walter can't right now. Nothing will bring her daughter back. She says she needs to see him, it's between her and Walter.

In the lab, Walter thinks he's figured out how the deaths occurred. He has a long scientific explanation, but Astrid translates: ""It's like a computer virus that infects people."" The outstretched hand is a hallucination.

Peter comes in and Olivia says she thinks she knows who that woman is, the mother of the lab assistant killed in the fire 20 years ago. Peter says Walter doesn't know, he couldn't handle it. Olivia thinks he can. Peter underestimates his dad she says. Peter leaves.

Charlie finds the last victim just got married a year ago to Marian Dempsey. Luke's mother. Olivia remembers Luke said his and Greg's father worked together.

In the lab, Peter rips the telephone out of the wall. Olivia presents the suspect, Brian Dempsey (Chris Bauer). He worked for Greg's dad, until he fired him six years ago. He was a programmer. No connection yet on the car salesman.

Olivia relays the news to Charlie. There was no sign of Brian at home, they bring Luke in instead. Olivia and Charlie watch from the observation room. Harris comes in and bullies them to break him, despite the fact Olivia thinks Luke knows something up with his dad and a soft touch will work.

They go talk to him, following Harris' bad orders. Luke says he last saw his dad a few weeks ago, they aren't close. Olivia shows him the picture of his step father and Greg, mushy. Luke asks for a lawyer. Game over.

Peter asks Olivia if it's any consolation knowing she was right. Olivia tells Francis to wait five minutes, then release Luke. Screw Harris.

Luke calls for a cab from the FBI. Olivia listens in to the call and gets the address he's going to. (Yes, he's that dumb, he's 19, Olivia tells Peter.)

They follow the cab. Peter says he doesn't underestimate his father, he understands him. The woman is just going to accuse him of causing her daughter's death. Olivia thinks he might get resolution. Peter says it's none of her business.

The cab stops. Olivia tells Peter to wait in the car. She won't call for backup because Harris wants her to screw up and he'll do whatever he can to make her look bad. At HQ, he proves her right, demanding someone trace the GPS in her car.

Olivia walks up slowly on Luke confronting his father. Brian's security system goes off. He sees video of Olivia approaching and runs his son off. Olivia walks slowly into the computer central nervous center. It doesn't look like anyone is there. Suddenly, all the monitors go on with the death video then Olivia sees herself on a screen and a gun put to her head.

Peter waits anxiously in the car.

Brian disarms Olivia, telling her she ruined everything and his son hates him because of her. He holds the gun to his own head.

Peter still sits in the car.

Brian goes on about wanting people to feel the pain he felt.

In the car, Peter hears sirens approach. He gets out.

Inside, Brian starts to look at the video screens. Olivia yells at him to stop, but he wants to see his creation. Luke confronts Peter inside and they both hear a shot. They run to find Olivia with Brian. He shot himself.

Luke runs outside where Harris and his squad arrest him.

Olivia and Peter wait in the car. Peter wonders why Luke would protect a murderer like that. ""Because it's his father,"" Olivia says.

At HQ, Sanford Harris drops in on Broyles, telling Broyles his agent went against his direct orders. Broyles backs Olivia, telling Harris if he goes against her, Harris is going against Broyles too.

In the lab, Peter brings in Jessica Warren to meet Walter, telling him he'll be there if he needs him. She mentions her daughter. Walter remembers her. She wanted to see him because he was the last person to see her daughter alive and she wants to know if there's anything else he can tell her about her daughter. He remembers her smile. He misses her. He hugs her as Peter watches, changing his mind.

Olivia shares some wine with her sister, who doesn't really want to know about her day job. Her doorbell rings. It's Peter. He's had a few drinks. He wanted to say he's never had Walter in his life and now thanks to her ""insane freak show of an operation"" he does. He's sorry, she was right. He thanks her. Rachel comes to the door, happy to see Peter.

Peter will see Olivia tomorrow."

Headsets cost $4. A man writes notes to himself, including one to avoid capture. He gets a bloody nose and goes to the bathroom. He checks his eyes, tugs to make sure his teeth are intact. Then he does a mouth swab and tests. The liquid changes color. This does not appear to be good.

He demands to speak to a flight attendant. He doesn't have the time or permission to explain what's happening. He needs tranquilizers, fast. He asks what weapons they have. They have a Tazer. He says it won't work, it'll just piss him off. He tells the flight attendant he's going to lock himself in the bathroom and if he opens it and it's not him anymore, don't let him out. He locks himself in, checking his eyes again. His teeth start to fall out. There's a loud banging from in the bathroom. He sprouts spikes on his spin and continues general growling. Then, he's quiet. The flight attendants talk about what to do. Then a half-man, half-hedgehog spiky Sasquatch busts out of the bathroom and goes on an in-flight rampage.

Scarsdale, NY At a kids soccer practice. There's a loud noise overhead and the plane crashes down.

At Olivia's house, she comes home to find her niece Ella (Lily Pilblad) playing dress up. Her sister Rachel (Ari Graynor)finds an engagement ring and asks what it is. Olivia (Anna Torv) tells her he never actually proposed and it was a mistake. He was a traitor. Whatever was between them was a lie.

Liv gets a call and heads to the wreckage of flight 718.

They got a distress call from the pilot. They find something forensics thought was animal at first. They were mistaken. It's the charred spiky Sasquatch.

There were 147 passengers. Liv flips through the flight manifest. She recognizes Marshall Bowman from John's memories. The fried dog- man, as Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) calls him.

Back at the lab, Walter (John Noble) has fun dissecting. The man grew four extra nipples, which allows Walter to explain the half-nipple rule (number of off-spring is usually equal to half number of nipples).

Walter finds evidence of the nose bleed and something hard in the man/dog's paw/hand. It's a glass disk the size of a nickel.

At the FBI, Charlie turns over everything on Bowman. Liv recognizes another guy from John's memory among his associates.

They get the last 60 seconds of the flight recorder. They play it and hear the pilot saying ""something"" is on board and is killing passengers. There's loud banging and then it goes silent.

Olivia wants to bring in Daniel Hicks, an importer-exporter. She thinks it's who Bowman was going to meet. Charlie wants to know how she knows. She tells him to file it under ""crazy things happen in Walter Bishop's lab,"" and explains how she has some of John's memories. She thinks they were all working together on a weapons sale of some kind. Charlie goes with it.

Peter (Joshua Jackson) calls with DNA proving the man/dog was Bowman. Walter thinks he was dosed with a designer virus. It rewrote Bowman's DNA. He sends her a video of the glass disk. Liv says they found a similar disk on a DEA agent a few months ago.

Charlie and Liv talk to Hicks. Bowman was his banker. Liv shows him the picture of the fried dog-man remains. She thinks he knows how that happened. Hicks' nose starts bleeding.

Watching from the observation room, Walter knows they need sedatives right away. Hicks starts to bleed and twitch. Before Walter can inject him, Liv wants to know who dosed them. Conrad. The man conks out.

At the lab, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) reports finding no hits on Conrad. Liv finds nothing on him in John's files. Walter has Hicks strapped to a table, in a medically-induced coma. He's still transforming, but slowly. Walter isn't optimistic that he'll figure out how to reverse it in time. Olivia tells Walter to cut open Hicks' hand. They find a glass disk.

Liv brings the disk to Broyles (Lance Reddick), wanting to dig up John Scott's body to see if he had one. She also wants the other disk they found earlier. Broyles tells her they're data storage devices and they don't have either.

Cut to Massive Dynamic. Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) greets Liv and Broyles, telling Liv it was not her decision to keep ""this"" from her. She leads her into a room where she sees what ""this"" is. John Scott (Mark Valley), dead, but in suspended animation. They suspect the disk self-destructs when the host dies, so they kept his body pumping so they could get info off it. It looks like John was part of a bio-terrorist cell. They also found references to a Conrad, who they believe is a scientist selling weapons on the black market.

It gets worse. An informant says a major weapons sale is about to go down in Chicago. He didn't know anything about it, except that a man named Conrad is behind it.

Olivia calls Peter to catch him up. She thinks John knows who's behind the pending attack. Which means it's in her memory. Tell Walter to prep the tank.

Liv climbs in. Walter starts his machines and talks to Olivia, telling her to listen to his voice. He's going to try to guide her into John's memory to where he met Hicks.

She's in a hotel room. Where she and John used to meet. She sees them come in, making out. Walter reminds her John can't see her now, she's observing a memory. Making-out Liv goes to the bathroom. John says hi to Observer Olivia, the one he's not supposed to see. She picks up his gun and points it at him. She asks him about Conrad. She catches him up on his partners. She panics and shoots him. The machines spike. Walter can't get Olivia to respond.

In Memory Land, Olivia walks down an alley. She calls for Walter but he doesn't answer. She comes up to John. She wants answers. He turns and walks away. She follows. John shows her Conrad, a monster, John says, as a car drives by. He shows her himself, atop a nearby building with a sniper rifle. He let Conrad get away, but he didn't know it was him. He failed his mission. What mission? Bowman and Hicks are part of an NSA secret task force, and so was he. She doesn't believe him. He can't prove it, it's black ops. He doesn't know about the sale, but Hicks would know. He tells her to trust Hicks, he can help her.

They pull her out of the tank. She's OK. She calls NSA, but they can't confirm the mission, just like John said. They don't know if the antidote is working on Hicks yet. Olivia wants to wake Hicks up and trust him because John says she can.

Peter raises the possibility John is lying to her again. Astrid offers that her mother always says she sticks her nose where it doesn't belong. And she does, telling Liv she's a good judge of character, and what does her gut say?

Olivia tells them to prep Hicks. They're going to wake him up. He pops up and doesn't immediately turn into a man-dog. They need his help.

Broyles briefs his folks. They caught the prospective buyer this morning, but he isn't talking. Hicks is.

Olivia is going to pose as the buyer, taking com tips from Hicks. They're not to move until Olivia gives the signal: ""Christmas.""

Chicago The seller arrives. He makes a phone call.

Olivia tells someone they didn't have to come with her. It's Peter. He points out that ""shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels"" is his MO.

Walter monitors Hicks, who tells her to say she used to work with Anderson and Ernesto flew in but got called back to the basement and couldn't come.

They approach the seller in the lobby of a big hotel room. She uses the basement line.

They go up to a room, where they scan her and find nothing. She gives them the money. The man asks where he might recognize Peter from and Hicks feeds Olivia and Peter lines about Oxford. When he blanks on the name of a place, Peter pulls the name of a Thai place out of thin air.

A man comes in with a case and shows them two objects shaped like big light bulbs. The seller gets a call. Conrad would like to see them. Olivia doesn't give the sign. Charlie tells his men to wait. The seller mentions he's throwing in an antidote because it would take them years to design one on their own.

Hicks, who until now OK, hears this and becomes nervous. The seller tests Olivia again, asking why Ernesto wouldn't return his calls. They need a name from Hicks to placate him, but Hicks develops a nose bleed. Walter becomes worried. Hicks starts to change. Olivia and Peter sit calmly in a the hotel room listening to the grisly transformation and shouts through their earpieces, but not getting any information they can use. The seller takes out a gun and repeats his question.

Peter jumps to his feet as the men grab guns and starts yelling at Liv to just tell them already, he's not dying over Ernesto's dirty little secret. Liv catches on and says it's true, he's sick.

Conrad walks in, asking who Olivia and Peter are. Olivia says he found out the day before Christmas. Ernesto's fine, Conrad says, he spoke to him this morning. Uh oh. He tells the men to kill them both.

Just then Charlie and Co. bust in the door. Peter lays a good right on one gunman and Liv gets another. They take all the bad guys into custody. Liv leans in to Conrad: ""John Scott says hi.""

Later, Broyles tells Liv that Conrad is wanted in at least half a dozen other attacks. He's been wanted for years. Liv should at least crack a smile.

Broyles tells her despite the outcome of the case, John Scott's status with the bureau remains the same. There's no way to confirm he was telling the truth. She says it's OK. She knows the truth, and that's enough.

She goes to the Bishop's lab. It's empty. Walter comes in, saying Hicks is improving now that they administered the proper antidote.

Olivia tells him she wanted to ask him for a favor. He tells her she probably wouldn't be able to find John, her brain waves are returning to normal. She's purging him. She'd probably only have seconds. Then they need to do it now, she says.

She gets in the tank. She walks down a dock on a perfect fall lake. John appears beside her. She tells him they caught Conrad. She apologizes for not trusting him. He says it wasn't her fault. He meant to tell her, but ran out of time. There was one other thing. He takes out the ring and slips it on her finger. He knows they can't be together, not really, but maybe he won't know the difference. They kiss the kiss of the last good-bye. He says he loves her, and then disappears. In the tank, she says ""I love you, too."""

Jones (Jared Harris) sketches in prison, kills his lawyer, pops in some eye drops... We've seen this all before. Jones teleports to Boston via some device Walter (John Noble) designed.

Back in the prison, lots of frantic Germans try to figure out where the heck their guy went. How do you say ""teleport"" in German?

Harvard, two weeks later Olivia (Anna Torv) looks for Walter, who is busy doing something to the cow's udder. She tells Peter (Joshua Jackson) about Jones' mysterious escape. ""How come when nobody knows and it doesn't make sense, they come to us?"" asks Peter.

Olivia asks Walter again about his invention Loeb (Chance Kelly), who was working with Jones, stole, the transportation device. He called it ""dis-ray,"" involving disintegration and re-integration. If someone survived, they'd need time in a barometric chamber. ""If they survived that, based on what happened next, you'd likely wish you hadn't,"" Walter says. Olivia asks if he's saying Jones could have zapped himself out of prison. Yes.

Cut to a man getting out of a barometric chamber. Well, hello, Mr. Jones. Over tea he thanks his men for their sacrifice. He asks if everything is in order. They have a lab ready for him. Jones' hand shakes.

A man buys a paper with a $2 bill. We don't see his face. A young woman walks up to the newsstand after the man and the man running the newsstand starts scratching his eyes. His eyes start to close over with skin followed by his mouth (The Observer (Michael Cerveris) stands nearby). His mouth closes shut and he can't breathe. He collapses on the street.

Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) and an agent look over the records of Jones' attorney, Kohl, who was found dead in Jones' cell.

Olivia waits as a humvee pulls up and men in camo help a prisoner out of the truck. It's Loeb. She tells him she knows about David Robert Jones, and that they kidnapped her the night he escaped.

He's not feeling cooperative. She threatens him with a transfer. Loeb says it doesn't matter if they find Jones or not, he's just part of the army. ""What was written will come to pass, nothing you do can stop that,"" he says.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) calls Olivia, telling her to round up the Bishops. They stand over the body of no-holes man.

Olivia thinks Jones is involved. She gets a text.

She tells Peter what Loeb said and that someone has turned up what the initials ZFT might mean. Per her text: ""Destruction by Advancement of Technology."" It was an unpublished manuscript, destroyed after a police raid 10 years ago. She was hoping he might have one of his ""weird connections"" to find it.

Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Walter work over No Holes. Walter deflates him - cutting a hole in his non-mouth and inserting a tube to inflate a bag.

At the FBI the new agent has gotten a list of Cole's clients from an ex at the SEC.

Peter visits a bookseller, Markham, for a favor. He asks about the ZFT manuscript.

Charlie tells Broyles a warehouse nearby leased to Cole's attorney had the power turned on two weeks ago. As Broyles calls in for a search warrant an agent interrupts to say that David Robert Jones is in the lobby.

Indeed, he is. And he says he'll only talk to Olivia.

Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston), Broyles and Olivia meet in the observation room while Jones waits. They found a key on him. Harris says the U.S. doesn't negotiate with terrorists and Olivia says that's exactly the kind of arrogance Jones is expecting. ""The man was clever enough to Star Trek himself out of a maximum security prison, elude Interpol, arrive in Boston and get himself apprehended simply because he liked the idea,"" she says. She thinks he's there for a reason.

Sanford won't let her talk to him. He sends her on the raid of the warehouse.

Peter calls with the ZFT manuscript, which says scientific advances could destroy the world as we know it and it's already started.

The teams raid the warehouse. They find Jones' drawing of Olivia and his tea service.

Harris heads in to talk to Jones, who reiterates he'll only talk to Olivia. Jones coughs sickly. He wants to talk to Olivia as soon as possible to avoid any other unnecessary deaths. He'll require a standard walkie talkie with removable crystals, a metallic ball point pen, an eyeglass repair kid and an analog wrist watch. Harris isn't amused.

At the warehouse, the new agent finds a $2 bill in a drawer.

In the other room, Olivia and Charlie hear screams and run to find him with skin covering his eyes. Olivia tries to save him by ""trach""-ing him. She cuts a hole in his throat and tries to create an airway. It works for a minute until skin grows over that, too. He suffocates.

Olivia and Charlie return to HQ where she glares at Harris as he puts his analog watch in an envelope.

Harris watches from the other room as Olivia goes in to talk with Jones. She tells him about the agent that just died. ""Yes, I tried to prevent that,"" he says. ""Your agent Harris needed some convincing.""

She gives him the items he requested and he gets to MacGyvering on them. Whatever he makes emits a high-pitched whine that short out the listening equipment so they can talk in private.

He admits he has something far worse planned, but first he needs her to pass a test. He wants her to take the key and go to a park. He's left something there for her. He coughs again, wracked in pain. He says he cannot be cured. ""It seems that when one is dematerialized on a molecular level and reassembled there are certain unadvertised side effects.""

He says there is a van carrying an explosive device that will kill several hundred more people in the No Holes fashion within 16 hours. He says she'll disable it, but first there's the matter of the key. Harris busts in to break it up.

Olivia tells Harris and Broyles about the van and that she needs two hours alone.

She calls Peter. The No Holes is caused by a powder that triggers protein in skin responsible for scar tissue. Walter is working on an antidote.

Peter says the ZFT manuscript reads like a call to arms. She tells Peter she'll be back after she gets the package Jones left her. Walter has been reading the ZFT. He reads from it about a way to travel between universes. It will begin with a series of unnatural occurrences, but in the end, only one world will survive. Us or them.

Olivia fetches Jones' box. It's a set of kids' toys with directions to complete the test to prove herself.

They only have eight hours until the next attack. Peter reads the directions of the first test, in which you have to turn off lights on a lightboard using just your mind. Walter notices the same word ""recruit"" in the manuscript and the directions. The manuscript says a recruit will be unwilling at first.

Olivia stares at the lights. Her cell phone rings.

Charlie found a record of a rented white van. To Olivia Dunham.

She leaves for HQ. Harris doesn't want to let her talk to Jones again, but she reminds him the last time he got his way a good agent died. Jones is disappointed she didn't bring the test, but impressed she read the manuscript. He's looking worse and shaking.

He tells her she was among those treated with a drug called Cortexaphan, the only way to test for it is a spinal tap, which they did on her. She knows nothing about it.

She says he needs to cooperate, but he says she's the one who needs to cooperate. Jones twitches more and then collapses.

They bring him to Walter's lab. Walter says Jones' molecules are disintegrating and reintegrating.

Olivia talks to Charlie on the phone. He tells her Cortexaphan is patented but not approved by the FDA. Made by Massive Dynamic. She asks Peter if they might be able to trick Jones into thinking she passed the test.

Olivia goes to NYC to visit with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown). She looks up the drug. Her hand has been acting up. Cortexaphan was a drug Dr. Bell, Walter's old partner, invented in 1981. It was meant to prevent the natural shrinking of brain power he theorized happen during the course of someone's life. It was tested on children. But it was unsuccessful. The trials were conducted at Ohio State University, Wooster campus. Olivia asks if it was tested anywhere else. Nowhere, Sharp says.

In 1981, Olivia was three, living in Jacksonville on a military base she tells Peter. He reprogrammed the lightbox and Walter thinks he's close to reviving Jones.

Back at the lab, with two hours to go. Jones wakes up and she tells him she passed test No. 1. Jones recognizes Walter and says it's an honor to meet him.

Olivia turns on the lightbox and stares at it. Nothing happens. Then a light goes off. Then another. She stares intently, concentrating, as Jones watches. She acts exhausted. He thanks her.

Then he gives her an address. She calls in to have it evacuated. When she gets there Charlie says the bomb squad says they can't move it or diffuse it because they've never seen wiring like this before. Olivia looks at it. It looks like the lightbox.

It's on a high floor of a downtown building, by the windows. If it goes, it'll spread far. She calls back to the lab to talk to Jones. The timer counts down from under three minutes. He has confidence in her. He says there's only one way to disable it, which she knows. She tells him if he doesn't deactivate it, she'll die and he seems to think she's worth keeping alive. He has faith in her. ""There is only one way out, and it's you.""

Olivia tells everyone to clear out and prepares to stare at the lights. Peter tries to get her to leave. The timer hits one minute. Peter leaves, telling her she's out of her mind.

She stares at the lights. Peter comes back. She stares. Two lights click off, then more. Peter watches in disbelief. More lights fade out. Olivia looks serene.The last light goes out with two seconds left.

Peter asks how she did it, but she has no idea.

As they wheel Jones out of the lab, he checks that she did it. ""My girl,"" he says. She tells Peter she didn't do anything with those lights, it was all just a mind game. Jones programmed it, she thinks. Peter says she was in the zone. She thinks Jones chose her because he wanted to meet Walter. Peter asks her if she wants to get a drink. But Olivia wants to talk to Jones at the hospital.

At the lab, Astrid tells Walter she can't believe he created a teleportation machine. She says even if it kills you, it's pretty damn cool. Walter says it does something ""unthinkable,"" but it doesn't kill you.

Olivia arrives at the hospital, where an announcement is telling everyone to follow emergency guidelines. She arrives in Jones' room, where a big Hulk-like hole has been busted through the wall. He's gone. A note on the wall says: ""You passed.""

At the lab, Walter reads more ZFT, getting wrapped up in definitions of reality. He notices the ""y"" is offset.

At home, Olivia's phone rings. It's Nina. Her hand is back to normal. Nina tells Olivia she was curious if there was anywhere else Cortexaphan was tested. There was, in fact. In Jacksonville, Florida, on a military base.

At the lab, Walter pulls out an old typewriter and punches out ""Ability."" The ""y"" is offset, meaning that he wrote the book himself."

At FBI HQ, Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) takes a call. He checks the fax machine. There's a postcard advertising a brand new show in New York and Boston. It gives Charlie pause.

At Olivia's, sister Rachel (Ari Graynor) tells her they went apartment hunting yesterday. She's thinking of staying in Boston.

Charlie calls Olivia. He says the Artist is back. They got a fax. She gets another call from Broyles (Lance Reddick). He wants her at Children's Hospital. The bald child is there. The tunnels have been sealed for 70 years. No one knows how he got down there. He hasn't spoken a word.

Walter Bishop (John Noble) wants his turntable.

The doctor says the child is having difficulty breathing. She wants to give him oxygen, but Walter advises strongly against it. ""Unless you have an IQ higher than mine, I'm not interested in what you think,"" he says. The boy was in a low oxygen environment and his lungs adjusted, which is why he's having a hard time now. Instead, they need to deprive him of oxygen.

Somerville, Mass. A woman does laundry at a laundromat. A man admires her griffin tattoo, asking if it hurt. She blows him off but seems to feel bad when she sees he's in a wheelchair. Outside, she sees him trying to put his laundry in his van. She offers her help. As she leans into his van with his clothes, he stands up out of his chair behind her and jabs a needle in her.

In his van, he rises up, covered in blood. He takes out a jigsaw.

In the hospital, the child does better as they fix his oxygen levels. He's bald, deathly pale and had red, sunken eyes. Walter guesses he ate rats, moss and millipedes.

Olivia tries to talk to him. Her phone rings. It's Charlie. The boy watches as Olivia talks, everything is a haze to him. Olivia writes down Coolidge Park. The boy watches. He grabs her arm.

He takes her pen and starts writing in upside-down script. He writes: Sam Gilmore. They think it's his name.

At the park, Olivia hears the body was found a while ago. A woman is displayed in a white dress, standing, with a with a black wig. It's the woman from the tattoo parlor. Her name is Samantha Gilmore (Alicia Goranson). He worked on her after he killed her.

At the office, Charlie briefs the team on The Artist. They first encountered him three years ago when he killed four women over a period of two days. He kidnaps, sedates and kills his victims.

He bleached Samantha's skin, dyed her hair and displayed her.

Olivia tells Broyles she sent the boy's pictures to Samantha Gilmore's friends, but no one recognizes him. The hospital is doing an MRI.

Walter presents research on feral children. He says the boy lacks micro-organisms anyone above ground would have so he's been underground his whole life. Bishop guesses he could be older than the 10 years he looks. They don't know why he'd know Samantha Gilmore.

But good news, Bishop says, he found his turntable.

Someone comes in with news the artist sent another fax.

The Artist approaches a woman walking her dog.

Olivia visits with the boy. She brought him M & Ms. She eats one. He takes one and feeds it to her. She removes the yellows, as a kid they reminded her of medicine.

She talks to him about the name he wrote down. A man interrupts. Eliot Michaels Erik Palladino) from social services. He asks the boy permission to borrow Olivia. In the hall, he tells her he's arranged to have the boy moved tomorrow.

The boy starts freaking out. His heart rate spikes and he covers his ears. Olivia asks Eliot to give them a moment.

In the hall, Eliot makes a call. He tells someone he thinks they may have found another one.

The boy takes Olivia's note pad. He writes an address.

Olivia and Charlie go there. From inside his van, the Artist holds his hand clamped down over his latest victim's mouth. She's still alive. Olivia walks right by the van.

At home, Rachel asks Olivia if she likes her job. She does most days. Not today, she followed a lead that didn't pan out. She asks her sister why she's still up. Right when she's about to answer, Olivia's phone rings. Charlie says they found the second victim, outside a church. Charlie says a little while after they left the address the boy gave them, a neighbor found her dog tied to a fence, whimpering. Olivia is upset they were there and didn't find her.

Olivia visits the Bishops. She tells Walter the boy was right. He thinks since the child's been living underground for so long and is hypersensitive to light and sound, he might be sensitive to people's intentions. Like a shark, whose bioelectric field allows them to detect their prey from many miles. But he doesn't know why the boy would know what he does.

He thinks he might be able to hear his thoughts.

Olivia visits the boy. He made an arrow out of her yellow M & Ms. She tells him she wants to take him somewhere. She leads him by the hand out of the hospital to Walter's lab. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) shows him Bugs Bunny cartoons online.

Walter finds his neural stimulator. The last time he used that thing he drilled it into a guy's head. He thinks he can modify it - which might have been interesting to the last guy.

Eliot arrives at the hospital and is upset the boy is gone.

Olivia holds the boy's hand in the lab. Walter fluffs his hair and puts on a record, specifically, Al Green's ""Love & Happiness."" He does a little boogie to music with the device to relax the boy, it works. He puts it on himself as he dances. The boy smiles and lets them put the same crown-like electronic device on him. He tenses up again. Eliot Michaels comes in.

Olivia meets with him and Broyles. She says child services doesn't really have clearance to know why they need him. Michaels is really with the CIA's director of science and intelligence. They want the boy. Broyles says it's out of their hands.

Astrid interrupts, saying they got another fax from the Artist. Broyles asks Michaels for another day with the boy. They agree.

The boy watches, nervous.

Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) entertains the boy with GI Joes. Walter works on a mnemonic, trying to remember which wires go into which connections on the machine.

Olivia reports on the forensics from the second victim. She had cow's blood under her nails. Walter remembers what he needs.

Peter has a thought. He once worked as a floor sweeper at meat-processing plant. They had these huge pieces of plastic they wrapped the meat in. It fits.

The Bishops work on the boy while Olivia checks out a meat plant.

They turn on Walter's machine. There's a high pitched whine, the machine calibrating. Walter adjusts the levels. A computer voice starts talking. The boy starts shivering. He's freezing. Peter tells him to turn the machine off. It doesn't make sense, he says.

Olivia asks the meat processing manager for a copy of his employee records. She also wants a sample of their shipping plastic. He says a man came in yesterday and he sold him some plastic.

The Artist approaches a teacher outside a school.

Peter tells Olivia about his shivering. He reports back to Walter and Astrid on what Olivia says. Walter asks if the plant was refrigerated. That explains it.

The boy is an empath. He's bonded to Olivia. He's telling her because he knows the information is important to her. He's trying to help.

Olivia takes his hand and tells him she's trying to stop the man who's been hurting people. Walter thinks it's like the boy is mad at her. Astrid says it's because he doesn't want to leave. Olivia apologizes to him and says she can't stop them from taking him. If he can really feel what she's thinking, he'll know she means it.

He takes her pen. He writes York/Glenway.

Olivia arrives at that intersection, stopping drivers. She compares them to her sketch from the meat plant manager. She stops the Artist in his van. She looks at the sketch and sees the resemblance. She sees a yellow tree air freshener hanging from his rear view window. She realizes it wasn't an arrow the boy made out of M & Ms, it was that. She wants to check the back of his vehicle.

He takes off. She fires at it and runs. Charlie checks the back of the van while Olivia chases the Artist. Charlie finds the woman - alive.

Olivia follows the Artist into the dark spooky cemetery that happens to be nearby. Out of the shadows, he comes at her with a knife, but Olivia puts some FBI moves on him, disarms him and stabs him. Charlie runs up and calls for the paramedics.

Olivia calls Broyles for his help. He listens.

Olivia goes back to the hospital to talk to the boy's original doctor.

She returns to the lab, where Walter says he's doing much better. Olivia has brought the doctor with her. She tells the boy the doctor is going to take him somewhere he'll be safe, a home with people who will care for him, not a facility.

Broyles tells Michaels, sorry, the boy is gone. Oops. They still don't know how he ended up underground, there's a lot they don't know about him, Broyles says. Guess they never will, he tells Michaels.

Olivia comes home to her rowdy niece and an adorable game of ""Simon says.""

The boy is driven to his new home. He smiles in the backseat at the passing scenery. He sees a man standing on the street, holding a briefcase. It's the Observer (Michael Cerveris). He looks just like the boy."

Peter(Joshua Jackson) calls.

Rachel (Ari Graynor) giggle on the phone with him. She resumes bedtime story reading. Ella (Lily Pilblad) checks to make sure monsters aren't real. No, of course they're not, auntie assures her.

Cut to masked people breaking into a lab with caged animals and setting them free.

A man asleep in bed gets a security auto notifcation on his cell phone.

In the lab, a woman tells Jonathan (Rafi Silver) to hurry up so they can leave. But he's interested in what's in a room with red lights.

The man shows up and the protesters yell at him for experimenting on animals. He sees the red-lit room is open and worries that they opened it. He goes to check it out and is promptly chomped down on. An unseen thing races out of the room, growling. The protesters flee, leaving Jonathan behind.

As they speed away in their car they wonder what that thing was. And then they hear it growl beside their speeding car and they're flipped off the road. Overturned, they're helpless in the car as it races at them.

At Harvard. Peter arrives in the lab and sees a tasty-looking omelette. He goes to take a bite, but when Walter (John Noble) yells at him he discovers an ear in it. It wasn't breakfast, it was an experiment. Peter suggests loudly his dad give him a little more warning and be aware his actions have consequences. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) reports Olivia called.

At the protesters' car in the woods, the team checks it out. Three dead. It appears they were attacked by an animal with enormous claws. A pteradactyl, Walter suggests. The kids weren't carrying IDs. They find a lock pick device, which suggests they weren't up to any good. Olivia notices four fast food drinks in the car. But three bodies. Peter recognizes the cups from a fast food place by MIT. Olivia wants to go through the database to ID the victims.

Olivia knocks on a door, asking about Chris. Carl Bussler (Keith Nobbs) is happy to answer her questions - right after he hides the bong and puts on some pants.

Carl says Chris is involved in animal rights causes.

At the lab, Walter and Astrid look at the sliced up bodies. Walter admires the fang work. Whatever did it had the claws of a lion and the fangs of a snake.

Astrid looks into labs that do animal research to see if any reported break-ins.

Walter finds something in one of the bodies - a spike of some sort.

Animal control reports to the site of a monster sighting. They hear noises in the bush.

Peter checks in on Olivia, who tries to ask innocently about him being friends with her sister. He asks if it bothers her. She says no.

Olivia tells Astrid about the animal control call about a monster. Walter tells Olivia to be careful. Peter finds this odd.

Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) goes monster hunting. He finds the animal control van - and the officer dead and mauled inside. He hears something in the woods and goes after it, gun drawn, after calling for back-up. He finds the other officer, shredded. As he's looking at the body, a long snakelike tail drops out of the tree behind him. Olivia arrives to hear gunshots and Charlie bloody and slumped against a tree. He's hurt, but OK. Olivia asks what it was. ""Big,"" he says.

Medics pluck porcupine-like spikes out of Charlie. Walter takes one as a sample. He asks what the animal's skin was like, if it was rough like a rhino. He asks about the tail, if it was like a scorpion. Peter can tell Walter has an idea. He thinks they're dealing with a transgenic species, an organism made up of the genes of multiple species, something man made. Peter wonders why anyone would want to make a ""Franken-rhino.""

Astrid gives Olivia the name of a lab. Olivia stops by. Swift Pharmeceuticals. Dr. Swift (David Pittu) says there was no break-in. A guy with a paint roller walks by, suggesting clean up. He tells her she needs a warrant to see more.

Olivia stops by Harvard to ask Walter what he would need to make a hybrid animal. He lists a number of things, among them a house in the country and lots of time. Peter says Walter's been like that all day. Peter tries to focus him. Walter show him the book he found among his old files. It shows a giant snake creature with spider legs and a scorpion tail. Walter tried to make it 20 years ago. Peter knows Walter knew this was connected and said nothing. Olivia asks who he was working with. Astrid notices one of the bodies in the bag is moving. They open it up. Maggots. No, larvae, Walter corrects. He calls for a petri dish. The body splits open with tons of writhing larvae. ""Make it a bucket,"" he says. Astrid announces she's going to be sick. ""Two buckets!""

Walter thinks the stinger carries the eggs and plants them when it stings people. Olivia thinks of Charlie.

Charlie and his wife Sonia (Kiersten Warren) get ready for bed, watching the news, which has reports of mountain lion sightings. Charlie tells her he was cut by some drunk with a bottle. There's an urgent ring at his doorbell. It's Olivia. She tells him he might not be OK.

Walter does an ultrasound at the lab, telling Charlie he might be carrying the creature's offspring. They're hoping he's not pregnant. But the ultrasound shows a bunch of tiny little squirmies in him.

Walter doesn't know what to do next, they've already spread throughout his system.

Peter goes to talk to Walter.

Charlie asks how the things are actually born. She tells him it won't get that far.

Walter calls for supplies to poison them.

Astrid sticks a needle in Charlie's abdomen. If it doesn't work, they think Charlie has maybe 16 hours left.

A woman takes her young son to a playground. A long rattler-like tail sticks out of the play tunnel.

Broyles (Lance Reddick) gives Olivia the reports on Kelvin Genetics, where he did his hybrid research. They still can't find the fourth animal activist.

Peter calls for Olivia. The poison killed the larvae but it also poisoned Charlie. Walter thinks they're killing Charlie so they can gestate. Walter has a theory that involves mixing the mother's blood with Charlie's to trick the larvae so they'll stop feeding.

They need to find the creature.

The boy on the playground crawls near the tunnel with the monster in it. His mom senses something is amiss and grabs him just in time.

Olivia looks at a map, trying to figure out why there aren't more sightings. She wants a schematic of the sewers. All the sightings are near storm drains. Walter is upset they don't have more, feeling guilty about Charlie.

Charlie cries out in pain, writhing and holding his stomach. They see gross little bumps moving under his skin. The larvae are getting bigger.

Olivia gets a call about the sighting in the park. There's no pattern.

Carl from MIT calls Olivia. He says this kid Jonathan hasn't been to class for a few days. Jonathan Swift. Olivia goes back to Swift Pharmaceuticals, mad at Dr. Swift. She accuses him of creating dangerous genetic hybrids which killed five people. She tells him about the larvae in Charlie Francis.

Dr. Swift says Olivia is wrong, it didn't kill five people - it was seven. She says Swift was working with Cameron Dagleman - no one Walter ever worked with. She got the types of animals in the hyrbid. Walter stops her at bat. That was the missing ingredient that allowed the creature to survive. But that won't help Charlie.

Astrid suggests they bait it in the sewers. Walter says it doesn't want food, it wants its kids - bats are highly material species.

Walter says they'll need 50 caliber incendiary rounds.

Charlie lays on the stretcher in the lab, huddled under a blanket. He tells Olivia not to get hurt for him, but she says he'd do the same for her.

Walter, Peter and Olivia suit up. Walter pockets some of the poison they used before.

Underground, they follow the map to a good hunting spot.

Walter takes out the box of monster larvae babies.

Charlie calls his wife who tells him a banal joke. He chokes up listening but tries to play it off as a laugh. She asks if he'll be home for dinner. They say I loves yous but he doesn't tell her he's currently carrying a hybrid monster's babies.

In the sewer, Walter has to tinkle (his word). Peter tells him to go where ever, they're knee deep in the facilities. Walter walks off and padlocks himself on the other side of a gate from Peter and Olivia. Walter says no one else is going to get hurt. He chugs the poison. If the creature gets him it'll poison itself. Peter yells at him not to do it.

Walter says if he should happen to live through it, there's an antidote in the lab.

He walks off down the dark tunnel, singing to himself.

Peter and Olivia try to break down the gate he locked.

Walter makes his way through the dark, looking around every corner with trepidation. He reaches a dead end, but hears slime oozing behind him. He turns to see a giant lizard beast hanging from the ceiling. Suddenly it doesn't seem like such a good idea.

Peter and Olivia run up behind it. Shots ring out and the beast falls dead. Walter holds the smoking gun in his hand. He wonders if anyone happened to notice the time when he said the poison would kill him within the hour.

Back at the lab, Walter is up on his feet and making an antivenin for Charlie. They inject him with something.

Later, he looks better.

Peter tells Walter he was brave today.

They do another ultrasound on Charlie. The larvae are still in there. But they're shrinking and dying.

Olivia asks what happens next. ""Now you crap 'em,"" Walter says.

At home, Charlie climbs in bed with his wife.

Olivia checks on her sister and niece. She turns out the light and listens for monsters. She turns the light back on again and goes to sleep."

The mom reaches for it, out and up, leaning to the track. Someone walks out from behind a pillar and gives the mom a shove in front of the train. It's Olivia (Anna Torv).

She wakes up, unsettled. Her sister Rachel (Ari Graynor)and niece Ella (Lily Pilblad) say hi in the morning. On the morning news, Olivia sees a report about the same young mother she dreamed about being killed by a subway. They say she threw herself in front of it.

FBI HQ Olivia asks Broyles (Lance Reddick) for permission to go to New York to investigate the case. She tells him there may have been extraordinary circumstances. That's all she's comfortable saying. He asks if she's OK, she's seemed on edge. She says she hasn't been sleeping well. He gives her 24 hours.

Harvard Olivia tells the Bishops about it. Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was a nightmare. Walter (John Noble) asks tons of odd medical questions. He wonders if she teleported to New York in her sleep and killed her, but lack of radiation on Olivia disproves that. He also rules out astral projection, because she wouldn't have been to shove.

Olivia says she could smell the platform and see her baby staring at her. It wasn't just a dream, she says. ""New York it is,"" says Peter.

Walter is excited by the idea of catching a show. He starts doing musical numbers. He's not going, Peter says.

Grand Central Station Peter and Olivia meet a police detective. She leads them to where the woman died. They think it was a suicide. The security cameras got the whole thing. Olivia wants to see the footage. Olivia tells Peter there's going to be a balloon floating to the ceiling, a red one.

Down on the platform they look up. There it is.

Her husband holds their young daughter, saying it doesn't make any sense. He says she wouldn't kill herself.

Olivia and Peter look at the security footage. It seems to show the woman jumping. Olivia gets a copy.

Back at Harvard, Walter wonders if Olivia killed her using her mind. Peter thinks it's ridiculous. Walter says he's sure Peter's right. ""Unless, of course, it happens again.""

Olivia sits alone in a nice Italian restaurant, noticing all the couples around her. A man thanks a waitress for his dessert and his wife stands up and screams at him for cheating. She grabs a knife. Olivia walks over and stands behind the woman, taking the hand with the knife. She guides it into the husband's gut over and over.

Olivia wakes up. She calls Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) to report a murder.

St. Vincent's Hospital Peter tells Olivia she couldn't have done it, they were 300 miles away. The doctor says he's going to die, which is why they gave the wife permission to be there.

Olivia talks to the wife. Her nickname is ""Mouse."" (Johanna Day) She says suddenly she was convinced her husband was going to leave her and she got scared, then angry. ""How could I do this?"" Olivia suggests maybe someone made her do it, compelled her. Peter interrupts.

Out in the hall, Olivia tells Peter she made her do it. Peter blames her lack of sleep. Olivia wants to know what's happening to her. Peter holds her.

They go by the restaurant. Olivia wants to know who was sitting at a certain table. She grabs the manager, asking if it was her. He describes a blond man with a scar on his face.

Olivia goes to the security footage from the subway. He's on it. He was at the table where she dreamed she was sitting and on the platform where she she dreamed she was standing, but she didn't see him. Walter says she wasn't dreaming about herself, she was dreaming about him.

Back at HQ, they run facial recognition software on him. Broyles interrupts, wanting to know what's going on. They get a hit: Nick Lane (David Call). Former address, St. Jude's mental hospital.

Broyles isn't happy with Olivia. She tells him someone has been coming into her dreams, either making her kill people or making her watch. She says the things they investigate are happening to her. He says she can't unofficially investigate a case where she's the subject. He asks why she didn't come to him. She didn't want to sound crazy. She suggests taking some time off.

Broyles responds by calling Charlie and opening the case officially, with Olivia on it. Good egg, Broyles.

Olivia and Peter visit the mental hospital. Peter wonders if maybe he didn't think enough about what Walter went through. ""It must be a terrible thing to not be able to trust your own mind,"" he says.

Dr. Miller (Laurie Williams) greets them. She remembers Nick. He had a very comprehensive military insurance policy. Someone came four months ago and said he'd inherited money. She said Nick had an ""emotional brightness."" She says his moods tended to affect people. He had paranoid delusions. He thought he'd been recruited as a child for a series of experiments. As she goes on, you can feel the hairs stand up on the back of Olivia's neck as she recognizes her own childhood. According to Mr. Jones, that she was recruited as a soldier to serve in a war against invaders from a parallel universe.

They call Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and have her read from the ZFT manuscript, which describes Nick's delusions almost exactly. He's been quoting the ZFT since the mid 90s. He was born in 1979 in Jacksonville, same as Olivia. She wants to talk to Walter right away.

They drop by his hotel room. She wants to know about Cortexaphan. His former partner William Bell theorized it might enhance certain abilities, including influencing perception. So if Nick Lane was treated with Cortexaphan he might be able to control people with his thoughts. Feelings, Walter clarifies. Olivia remembers what the shrink said about Nick being suicidal. He might have been considering jumping on the platform and his emotion infected the woman. Likewise in the restaurant. Peter says that still doesn't explain how she's seeing him in her dreams.

Walter says they experimented on kids in pairs, which kept them from feeling frightened or isolated. Sometimes, an intense bond would form, a bond which could be greatly amplified by a drug like Cortexaphan. Olivia backs away as she realizes what he's saying.

Olivia says she might have been treated with Cortexaphan. Walter thinks it's good news. He might know how to find Nick.

Olivia walks into a strip club. She eyes a scrawny brunette stripper on the pole. This being Fox, the two women kiss.

Laying on a table in the lab, Olivia narrates what's happening. Nick and the stripper leave the club together, she's basically infected by his horniness. As Peter explains to Astrid that Walter's hypnosis of Olivia means she can feel what Nick's feeling, it's clear he's feeling something naked. Then he feels guilt, shame and something dirty. He's infecting the dancer with how much he hates himself. She smashes a glass on the counter and picks up the shard. Nick guides her hand as she slits her throat. Walter tries to convince Olivia to stay under the hypnosis. Walter explains it's just a dream she's seeing.

Olivia stays under long enough to see Nick go home. She snaps out of it saying she knows where he lives.

Nick Lane gets ready in the morning, taking boatloads of pills. He takes a gun out of a drawer and loads it.

Olivia and the team creep up to his door and enter his apartment. He's not there. But he has a wall filled with news clippings and photos about secret government drug trials.

Nick walks down the street. As he passes some people, they follow him.

Olivia wants to know why this is just now happening. Peter thinks it must be related to his supposed inheritance and the visit from the lawyer. They wonder if he was activated.

The group behind Nick now includes at least five people. Charlie gets a call with an ID of Nick entering a building.

In the car ride there, Walter says Olivia might be immune from Nick's abilities.

They arrive at a tall building where a police officer says they already sent someone up, but he's on the ledge, too. Olivia goes up to find a dozen people standing on the ledge of the building, looking down. Olivia talks to Nick.

He turns and is happy to see her, excited she heard him. He says she was always the strong one and would always make him feel better. He says he waited to be called up, wore the blacks and grays, but the call never came. Then a man with the glasses showed up at the hospital and spoke all the old words. He said ""what was written will come to pass."" He said he knew how to wake him up. Nick pulls his gun on Olivia. He says he wants to stop hurting people. He hands it to her. He asks her to shoot him. ""Please Olive,"" he says. ""I can't fight this much longer."" He screams as if in pain and a woman next to him plummets to the street below. He says if she doesn't shoot him, he'll jump and they'll all jump.

He begs her. He doesn't want to take them all with him. She apologizes and shoots him in the legs. All the people crumple to the rooftop, unharmed.

Broyles tells OIivia they asked Massive Dynamic for the files related to Cortexaphan, but Nina told him they were all destroyed. Nick is being kept in a drug-induced coma indefinitely.

At home, Olivia's niece asks if the vaccine she got at school can come alive. Olivia tells her it's just bad dreams.

There's a knock at her door, it's Charlie, covertly giving her Nick Lane's file.

In the lab, Walter looks through videocassette tapes.

He finds one. It's him and Dr. Bell talking to a young girl named Olive, reassuring her everything will be OK."

They check out shredded Bob. He died the same way as the victim two nights ago. Walter (John Noble) says decapitation and shredded neck reminds him of shrimp cocktail. He elaborates, but on the off chance you might eat shrimp cocktail again, we'll leave that out.

Peter (Joshua Jackson) checks to make sure Olivia's OK as Walter finds bite marks on Bob's neck. His spine's been chewed out. Walter is sure it was done by something exciting.

Olivia briefs Broyles (Lance Reddick). Bob's car is missing. Also, Olivia asks Broyles if he is satisfied with his divorce attorney. She gets the number. He guesses it's for Rachel.

At the lab, Walter does two autopsies, really enjoying himself. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) brings the lab work. Their spinal columns were drained of fluid. They also have traces of syphilis bacteria. ""Great, so the killer has syphilis,"" Peter says, ""should have worn gloves."" More interestingly, the syphilis strain is ancient.

Olivia visits the CDC. A nervous man tells her a lab ordered it four weeks ago. The lab also ordered others throughout the years. The lab ordered a compound used in bioweapons, the same compound used to kill Agent Kent (whose eyes and mouth grew shut with skin). It could be ZFT.

Olivia and an assault squad storm the lab, which is in a house in a residential neighborhood. Inside, Olivia finds a dog in a cage with the same electric blue eyes the woman who shredded Bob had. They find a man sawing on an animal.

They bring in Dr. Nicholas Boone (Jefferson Mays), a mild mannered scientist in a wheelchair. Olivia and Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) show him the pictures and ask what happened. Charlie asks how long he's been a follower of ZFT. Boone reacts like he's heard of it.

He says someone was dosed, but they have to help him. They have his wife.

He says he's being punished by ZFT because he tried to get out when he realized what his work was used for.

Olivia tells Broyles that Boone's wife hasn't been to work in three weeks. She's tired of seeing people die (81 Fringe cases so far, not counting the airplane).

Boone gives them an address where he says his wife is being held. A restaurant in Chinatown burning five times the power it should be.

The Bishops visit Boone's house lab. They check out the split open animal and blood everywhere. Walter pokes around.

Charlie and Olivia prepare to lead an assault on the restaurant. Rachel calls Olivia in tears. Her soon to be ex is suing for sole custody of her daughter Ella (Lily Pilblad). Despite the fact she's surrounded by SWAT in a moving van, Olivia takes the time to talk her down, before excusing herself for a ""meeting.""

In the restaurant they find food and cooks, as might be expected. Olivia, who it turns out speaks Chinese, asks an employee where Boone's wife is.

At HQ, Broyles tells Boone his wife isn't there. He knows. He wants to talk to Olivia. He directs her to a refrigeration unit. Inside is filled with vials of the contagion. He needs it to make an antidote. ZFT didn't kidnap his wife, they dosed her. She's the one doing the killing.

Valerie Boone lurks hungrily outside a club. She spies a young stud, whose spinal fluid must look tasty. He drives her home. As he kisses her in the car, he notices that she's burning up. She apologizes, then develops razor teeth and gnaws into his neck.

Roxbury, Mass. Police and FBI check out the latest spinal scene.

Broyles shows Olivia a video camera found in Boone's house, telling her to note the date. She brings it in for Boone. It shows him filming his wife. He's standing then running and leaping. Not in a wheelchair.

The video was taken three weeks ago. Olivia asks him to explain. He says his wife needs to feed, she can't help it. He began to feed her his spinal fluid until he couldn't give any more. The contagion burns through her spinal fluid.

He says ZFT wanted him to create a human nightmare. He also created the skin growth toxin. They wanted to show off. He made six vials. He wants to work on the antidote and then he'll tell them everything.

They take Boone to Walter's lab, where the two scientists dork out.

Charlie calls Olivia. They found Dead Bob's car. It's totally stripped.

Walter and Boone think they can kill the super syphilis with super penicillin.

When Olivia tells Peter about the stripped car, Peter says he knows a guy.

Olivia talks to Mako (Dante Nero) the fence, who tells her GPS was wiped for resale. He then says where they found the car. Walter tells Boone he's honored to have his intellect in his lab. Boone knows it's high praise. They talk science until it comes around to Walter's former partner, William Bell, head of Massive Dynamic.

Weymouth, Mass (where Mako boosted the car) Olivia and Peter try to figure out what Boone's wife was doing there. Peter looks in the bushes and finds another body.

Walter and Boone prep to try the antidote on the rat. They shoot it up as Peter wheels in two more bodies. Olivia asks Boone where his wife is getting her victims.

Astrid says one reeks of alcohol. She uses a black light to check the men for club stamps. She recognizes one. When the lights come back on they see the test rat is dead. Boone begs Olivia to capture his wife alive.

Olivia and Peter go clubbing. Valerie is there. Peter uses a heat sensor to scan for her super hot body heat.

At the lab Walter thinks they're missing something. Boone says the contagion requires cerebral spinal fluid and the antidote must as well. He says the only spinal fluid they know compatible is his. He says he's got enough left. Walter goes for it.

In the club, Peter finally finds Valerie, but they lose her.

Walter draws spinal fluid from Boone, who notices a nearby video camera and finds it interesting.

Valerie leaves the club and Charlie hits her with a tranquilizer.

Walter works on another antidote but Boone isn't doing well. Walter knows Boone lied to him about having enough spinal fluid. Boone asks him how far he'd go for someone he loves.

Peter and Olivia drive tranqued-out Valerie to lab. They think she'll be out for hours. Naturally, she isn't. She opens her eyes.

Peter and Olivia talk about the kind of love making Boone go to great lengths as Valerie pops up, bares teeth and goes after Olivia. Peter, still driving, gets Olivia's tranq gun and shoots her up again.

In the lab, Boone has had a stroke but watches as they inject his wife. She shrieks a high pitched whine, thrashes then goes limp. Walter checks her eyes. They go from freaky blue to a more normal color. Olivia checks on Boone. He has died.

As paramedics wheel Valerie away, Walter gives Olivia the video Boone asked him to give her.

She and Peter watch it. Boone held up his end of the deal. He tells her about ZFT, which includes some names he thinks she's already heard (we don't get to hear more).

Olivia goes into a bar and finds Broyles. She tells him Boone says the man funding ZFT is William Bell."

Their unpredictable acts are increasing in frequency.

A woman runs for the bus as Broyles continues his briefing, saying they recently learned William Bell may be behind the attacks. As the woman catches the bus toward the hospital, he tells the agents their goal now is to find evidence linking Bell and ZFT.

The woman has trouble breathing. She rings the bell to get off immediately. She stumbles around grasping her throat. She can't breathe. And then she bursts into flames.

Walter (John Noble) reads the ZFT manifesto -possibly his manifesto - and Peter (Joshua Jackson) asks what's up. Walter wants to show Peter something. He types the word ""prophecy"" on his busted typewriter and shows Peter about the offset key matching the manuscript. He says Bell wouldn't do these horrendous things. There are references throughout the manifesto about a chapter on ethics, but it has been removed. Walter thinks an original could still be in the lab. They get a call.

They check out the street flambe woman. Olivia (Anna Torv) says she'll call the coroner to transport the bodies. There's only one. Her vision shifts. She's seeing double but it goes away.

Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) of Massive Dynamic visits Broyles. She doesn't have her happy face on. She knows about the investigation. Broyles tells her they're investigating him for connection to biological attacks. Sharp says Bell isn't a terrorist. But he's unavailable to say so himself.

At the lab, Walter picks over the charred woman. He talks about people being full of energy at all times. Walter wants Peter to fire up the electron microscope, but Peter took it apart for a project.

Olivia visits Broyles. She thinks he moved his desk. Broyles asks about the other victim on the bus. But Olivia thought there was only one. Broyles shows her the crime scene photos -- two victims. Her vision shifts. Broyles walks in the door to his office and the conversation starts again. His desk is moved.

Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) storms in, thundering about why they're looking into William Bell. He tells them to drop it. He leaves.

Before Olivia can ask if they're really going to drop it, Broyles tells her to get more evidence.

Walter cuts apart the charred woman. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) checks her dental records. Her use of the word ""file"" makes Walter wonder if he hid the ZFT manifesto somewhere. He wants his Geiger counter but Peter used it for his experiment too.

Astrid matches the victim: Susan Pratt (Jennifer Ferrin).

Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) and OIivia check out her apartment. She was a toll booth operator. They go through her things. Olivia finds a $30,000 check from an Isaac Winters. Charlie finds her bathroom, charred to the floor.

Peter returns from the grocery store, disappointing Walter by not finding him Frankenberry cereal.

Olivia tells the Bishops about the evidence of fires in Pratt's apartment. Walter thinks it's pyrokenesis, a word made up by Stephen King for ""FireStarter"", movie Drew Barrymore. But Walter thinks it's real. He says that a myth is just a unproven fact.

Walter thinks her pyrokensis was a newfound ability she didn't know how to control, either blow herself up or blow other people up. Stress would make her blow.

Charlie calls with an address for Isaac Winters in Charlestown.

Charlie and Olivia pay him a visit. He's an attorney. No one answers. Olivia busts out her lock pick tools. Inside they listen to a message from Pratt saying something ""odd"" happened. She calls again, increasingly agitated, asking what's happening to her.

Olivia goes out on the street and sees buildings burning and the sky black with smoke. Charlie comes out behind her, her visit shifts and all goes back to normal.

The Bishops check Olivia out at the lab. Walter wants to make sure she isn't on hallucinogens. Walter assures her she's not losing her mind because if she was, she wouldn't be concerned. She tells them what she's seen. Walter suggests it might be deja vu.

Walter shows her about the various possibilities for each daily reality. Deja vu is a glimpse of the other possibilities in other realities, the road not taken. This is actually a real theory in Quantum Physics called the 'Many World theory'. Each choice made splitters our reality creating another. But he doesn't know why she's seeing them. Olivia asks about Bell's drug trials of Cortexaphan.

Walter doesn't know, but he thinks there are reasons for her visions.

Astrid shows them another victim, discovered by a web site.

Malden, Mass. Peter and Olivia visit Emmanuel Grayson (played by Clint Howard who once appeared as Balok in the The Corbomite Maneuver (1966) episode). He runs a web site called galaxytruth. He starts to blow Olivia off as a Fed. Peter interrupts, saying he's not a cop and he needs to know what happened. He says the dead man was an exchange student. He asks if they're familiar with (to be played by Star Trek (1966) alumni Leonard Nimoy in up coming episodes) and Massive Dynamic. He says it's a cover and the dead man is one of his test subjects. He thinks Bell is trying to activate his subjects. Some can handle it, some can't. He's creating super soldiers. And then he uses the word Khan. As in ""wrath of."" And then Romulans. About how Romulans have traveled back in time to change the present. (which happens to be the plot for the new Star Trek movie directed by JJ Abrams). And there goes his credibility. Peter says goodbye with the Vulcan ""Live long and prosper."" (In a shocking coincidence, [or as Jean Luc-Picard would say, ""in for a penny, in for a pound""] creator J.J. Abrams' movie ""Star Trek (2009)"" is opening this weekend, featuring a cameo by Leonard Nimoy -- and yes, WE have..., NO shame! And yes, old guys do watch FRINGE!)

Nina Sharp puts the prime minister on hold to take an urgent call in which she tells someone not to do something. Then she takes another call. Then she tell's her driver to take her to the helicopter. Then she tell's the Prime Minister something has come up, good-bye for now! The Prime Minister says good-bye to her, too!

Back at HQ, Olivia wonders if maybe Grayson was right about the non-Vulcan parts of his story. Harris comes in giving Olivia her new assignment. He tells her to get a psych exam. She tells him she won't let him undermine her ability to do her job. He says it's a direct order.

A phone rings near her. Her vision shifts. The phone changes colors. She looks around warily as things move in slo mo. She asks Charlie about the Pratt case. He says the have half of Boston under lock down and asks why she's worried about a pair of charred twins. She shifts back to the present.

She runs a search on Susan's twin. They find Nancy Lewis (Jennifer Ferrin), her twin who went missing nine years ago. Nancy lives in Boston.

Olivia goes there. But Isaac Winters gets there first.

Olivia shows up with Peter. The door is unlocked. The apartment is in disarray. The window glass has been melted. Peter has an idea.

The forensic techs are on scene. Peter paws the window before they can print it. He cuts a circle out of the glass. Walter shows up. Astrid shows up with whatever Peter has been working on.

He says they're going to find out who kidnapped Nancy.

Peter sets up his giant tube looking machine. He made it for Walter so he could reconstruct his water damaged records. It restores audio. He uses an electronic microscope to take a high resolution image of whatever, then a computer translates. He thinks the heat the twin generated when she was stressed and kidnapped would have left microscopic grooves on the glass.

He scans the glass. When he plays it the glass shatters. He slows it down. A low humming sound comes out. Then they can hear a woman screaming for help and a man talking.

They replay it. Olivia wants to hear the man dialing his phone. Her cell phone app can dial the number from the tones. It rings.

Agent Harris answers.

(after the break) Charlie answers his phone. He and Olivia watch Harris get into his SUV. They follow him. He goes to a warehouse.

They bust off the padlock and go inside.

Harris approaches a bunch of computers in a monitoring room. Isaac Winters is working on Nancy, strapped to a gurney. Harris tells Isaac ""he"" is losing patience and they need ""it"" done.

Olivia finds a room with pictures of Nancy and Susan and other cases they've investigated. And a picture of her. There's a shot in the other room behind her. A man shoots an agent and Olivia drops him. Olivia goes looking for Harris and finds Isaac. She shoots him.

Olivia runs in to help Nancy. As she tries to unstrap her from the table, Harris shuts the door behind her. Harris won't let Olivia out. If Nancy can't control her fire, she'll explode and solve two problems, Harris says. Nancy is heaving and overheated.

Harris calls someone and says they have an active.

Olivia tells Nancy what's happening and she can control it. She tells her to focus on anything. Nancy zeroes in on Harris on his phone in the other room. He starts to stagger. Nancy stares intently, calmly. And then Harris bursts into flames and keels over.

Olivia joins the Bishops in a diner. With Peter in the can, Olivia asks Walter: ""What the hell did you people do to us?"" She wants to know what he and William Bell did to them. Susan Pratt and Nancy Lewis are from Jacksonville, just like her.

He says they meant no harm. They were trying to prepare them to become capable. Something terrible is coming, but he doesn't know what. Through tears, he says he can't remember.

Peter comes back from the bathroom and Olivia is gone. He asks what happened as Walter holds Peter's hand.

Olivia gets in her car.

Nina Sharp rings Broyles' doorbell. She hands him a file. It's photos of The Observer (Michael Cerveris), all taken in the last 24 hours. She says he knows what happened the last time he appeared. They need to talk.

Walter listens to some old timey blues in the lab - his records working again. Thumbing through the box of albums he finds a manuscript. He flips through it, relieved. He thinks Astrid walks in behind him (but we can see it's a man in a suit) and he tells her he found the original manuscript with the extra pages. He reads: ""Our children are our greatest resource. We must nurture them and protect them. We must prepare them so they can one day protect us.""

He turns around. It's The Observer. ""Hello Walter,"" he says, removing his hat. ""It's time to go."" ""Is it time?"" Walter says calmly. ""I'll get my coat."" The Observer walks out of the lab and Walter follows behind.

Nina walks into an apartment lobby. She takes the elevator. When she gets off she's greeted by two masked men. One is holding a gun with a silencer. He shoots her in the chest and she drops."

They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones (Jared Harris), the ZFT mastermind. He says ""take out the camera, we can do it here.""

Olivia wants to bring William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board.

Nina Sharp is out of surgery.

Peter (Joshua Jackson) comes in to the lab. Walter (John Noble) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.

Walter visits a grave, The Observer (Michael Cerveris) watches.

Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia.

Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged.

Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her.

Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street.

Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot.

Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.

Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there.

Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue.

Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. ""There's more than one of everything,"" he says.

He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time.

At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about.

Nina calls someone for a search of Walter.

Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages.

Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself.

At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere.

Peter reaches the beach house.He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.

Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world.

Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out.

OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell.

Their cell phones all ring.

Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching.

Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.

At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off.

Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory.

Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina.

Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked.

Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.

Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally. They theorized the subjects might be able to travel to alternate worlds. Around this time, Walter says, he lost something very dear to him. He thought he could find it over there.

Nina explains finding the right place to cross over is the key. Bell proposed our world has ""soft spots,"" areas where the speed of light and protons have begun to decay, like the Bermuda Triangle, where it is easier to cross over. Their meddling with the laws of nature has increased the soft spots. She thinks Jones is looking for those.

Walter continues the explanation, saying opening the hole could let things from there cross over to here, which could be dangerous. He built a plug, a patch to close the hole. That's what the object is. And he knows where the hole is: Reiden Lake.

Nina and Olivia want to try to predict the next soft spot. They trace the oldest incidents back to Reiden Lake. Jones and his men arrive at Reiden Lake. He tells them to set up the gear. ""Come on, men, we're going to the other side,"" he says.

Peter drives Walter to the lake. Walter says they have to hurry, but he doesn't know why. He mentions his friend who visited him. Peter realizes he's talking about The Observer, the man who attacked him in the woods.

Walter says Peter probably doesn't remember, but when he was very sick as a kid he began collecting coins to calm himself. He gives Peter the one he's been holding and says it was the coin. Peter doesn't remember it.

Suddenly, their doors are opened and men grab them out of the car. Olivia runs over and calls off her agents. They're all there to plug a hole in the universe.

They see a bright light in the distance and run for it.

Jones has got the machine going. He stays focused on it as his side starts trading gunfire with FBI agents. Walter gives Peter the patch to close the hole as Olivia creeps closer to Jones and the slowly opening universe hole. The hole opens up and Jones walks towards it. She shoots him. He keeps going. She shoots him again. He walks on. Looking oozy and gross, he tells her the teleporter may be killing him, but in the meantime it's made him something special. Bullets pass through him. He walks toward the opening. Olivia runs after him and Peter, holding the patch, runs after her.

As Jones steps into the hole, Peter aims the patch at it, emitting a light. The hole closes shut, shearing Jones in half.

Back at HQ Broyles tells OIivia that Nina sends her gratitude, but they've been told to cease and desist their investigation into William Bell.

Astrid arrives at the lab. She and Peter find a note, addressed to him. He reads it: ""Stepping out for a bit, don't worry about me, son, I know where I'm going.""

Peter tells Astrid not to call the police. It's the first time Walter's left a note.

Walter stands back at the grave he visited earlier. He leaves the coin on it. It says: ""Peter Bishop, 1978-1985.""

Walter cries.

Olivia's phone rings. It's Nina Sharp, summoning her to a hotel in Manhattan, planning to hold up her end of the bargain.

On her way there, through the city, Olivia is nearly hit by a speeding car. She makes it to the hotel as planned. She waits. She calls for Nina and is told Nina is out of the country.

Olivia leaves. She rides the elevator down. She's alone. Then the lights flash and she's not, then she is again.

The doors open on an all-white hallway. A woman greets her by name and shows her to an office. There is an oxygen tank and newspapers announcing Obama's victory.

A man enters. ""I've been waiting quite a long time for this,"" he tells her. She asks where she is and who he is. The first part is complicated. The second is easy: He's William Bell.

Olivia looks out the window. She's standing in one of the towers of the World Trade Center."
