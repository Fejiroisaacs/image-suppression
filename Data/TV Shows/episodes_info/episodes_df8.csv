After meeting Leo and Sheila Mosconi, Beth Ann overhears Sheila reveal that Leo witnessed Rob kissing a waitress at a diner in Glendale.

In 1984, Simone and Karl are hosting a house party. Simone receives an mysterious envelope addressed to her, with a strip of photo booth pictures of Karl kissing a man inside. Simone confronts Karl and wordlessly confesses that there have been others. She demands that he packs. Later, Simone finds Karl slumped on a chair in the bedroom having attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. Simone swiftly calls an ambulance, with the neighbors congregating outside. Simone lies and tells them he fell down the stairs. Her friend, Wanda, who has long resented Simone for always flaunting about money and how perfect her life is while she works through a divorce and drinking problem, doesn't buy her lie. She reveals she was the one who sent the pictures of Karl kissing a man in the envelope. Simone pins her to the ground, with an EMT having to pull them apart. The next day, Naomi's son, Tommy, who was a waiter at the party, admits to Simone that he saw the photos and makes a romantic pass at her. Simone declines his advances, but Tommy states that unlike the men she married, he is in love with her.

In 2019, Taylor and her husband Eli have an open marriage. Taylor breaks the ""no hookups in the house"" rule when she lets her lover, Jade, stay for the weekend after she is threatened by a dangerous ex-boyfriend, Duke. Eli initially opposes, but eventually agrees when he finds himself becoming attracted to her, and allows her to stay longer if she wanted.

In the closing monologue, the wives Beth Ann, Simone and Taylor talk about a woman's motive for killing, who they would kill and could they get away with it."

Hampton goes on a quest to then find out what this strange utterance could mean. His journey takes him on a quest through Max's poor past, and into his huge (but scandalous) run for Class President.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Art Vitello'],"['', '', '']",[],"['marc anthony the bulldog character', 'pete puma character', '2d animation', 'cat']",[],"As the show opens, we see Montana Max in his mansion, angrily tearing up his room, and throwing his toys around. Suddenly, he chances upon a mirror, and seeing himself, mutters one word: ""Acme.""

This is followed by him throwing open his nearby window, and bellowing ""Acme!"" out into the night sky.

A newsreel is then shown, that chronicles Max's life. How from poor beginnings, Max's parents won the lottery, and his life changed, but he did as well. After having his parents arrested for making him eat broccoli, Max took charge of the family empire, and made a major move in running for Acme Looniversity Class President, which ended in a scandal that caused Max to be expelled.

The newsreel (for the Looniversity's newspaper), perplexes its reporters that it needs a hook. Hampton J Pig, Shirley the Loon, and Bookworm are perplexed by Max's 'last word,' of ""Acme.""

Hampton is put on the case, and goes on to interview people who knew Monty during his campaign.

First he visits Buster Bunny, who knew Max from long ago. Max was once a poor kid, who was kind and genial to Buster. However, once Max's family won the lottery, things changed.

From there, Hampton visits Plucky Duck, who Max hired as his campaign manager for the Looniversity's Class President election. Plucky was witness as Max purchased the Looniversity's TV studio, and made its ads lean more towards his view on things, slandering Buster in the process. Plucky also relates during an interview with Buster, how Max claimed to have found stolen test answers that Buster used, and Buster was then expelled.

From there, Hampton goes to Elmyra, who was Max's girlfriend at the time, but she provides few answers, and no clue as to what ""Acme"" means.

After this, Buster and Babs meet with Hampton, and explain how after Buster was expelled, Plucky confided in them about Max's planting of the test answers, framing Buster. With Max's victory looking assured, the three then tricked him into admitting he framed Buster, which resulted in his eventual loss for Student Body President, and expulsion from the Looniversity.

After this, the three walk down a street near Max's residence, still not sure what Max meant. Buster ponders that Max was a kid who could have had anything. Maybe ""Acme"" was something he couldn't obtain.

Suddenly, Max's voice calls down to them from his room. It is then he admits that he didn't say ""Acme,"" he said ""Acne."" He had cried out because he was distraught at having a bad case of ""Acne.""

Hampton then faints, as what he thought was an important thing, turned out to be nothing."

They discover an ancient space dumpster, and mistakenly open it, freeing the Evil Space Aliens trapped within for the past 10,000 years.

Intergalactic sorceress Rita Repulsa and her goons (Goldar, a golden armored Ape/Griffin; Baboo, a blue-furred flying monkey; Squatt, Baboo's stout blueberry-colored pal; and Finster, a white dog-like inventive creature) set their sights on the nearby planet, Earth. Luckily, the mystical sage behind Rita's original imprisonment, Zordon of Eltar, has remained there (trapped in a Time Warp, limiting him to appearing as just a transmission of his head inside of a large plasma tube), awaiting her eventual escape.

At his Command Center building, he has his robotic assistant, Alpha 5, seek out a group of five brave teenagers with attitudes to combat the aliens. Alpha plucks five friends from a Juice Bar in the town of Angel Grove, California.

They're reluctantly given Power Morphers, which enable them to transform their bodies into magical suits empowered by the spirits of dinosaurs. After facing Rita's foot-soldiers, the Putty Patrollers, the five teens are convinced of the danger, and agree to become the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Jason, the Red Tyrannosaurus Ranger; Zack, the Black Mastodon Ranger; Billy, the Blue Triceratops Ranger; Trini, the Yellow Sabertooth Tiger Ranger; and Kimberly, the Pink Pterodactyl Ranger.

Together, they can call forth massive fighting machines based on their respective dinos, and combine those into a single huge humanoid robot Megazord. They use the Megazord to run off Goldar, who attacks Angel Grove and with Rita's magic, soon grows gigantically. After the successful battle, the five teens agree to help Zordon & Alpha 5 defend the Earth for as long as it takes."

Billy makes communicators and accidently ties into the teleportation system of the Command Center. Rita opens a time trap, intending to capture the The Power Rangers the same way she once trapped Zargon. While Zargon analyzes the time trap, the Rangers must fight a group of putties who gathered outside of town. During the fight, Billy finds himself trapped on a cliff top, and Trini must overcome her fear in order to save her friend. The Rangers manage to defeat the putties without morphing. The Rangers then transform and are then sent to the amusement park, where they have to engage Ritas latest monster, Bones in battle, but he traps them and himself in the time trap. The Power Rangers must then fight Bones and some of Ritas hengemen to be able to get out of the trap. After they succeed, another enemy awaits them, but Jason (Red) uses the Tyrannosaurus dinozord and prevails. When the fighting is done, the gang relaxes at the youth center when they overhear someone gossiping about the new super heroes in town. They smile and walk over to the workout section, when Zack sneaks up on Trini while wearing a scary mask. She then unintentionally proves that she has overcome her fear of heights by climbing the rope to the ceiling."

The new kid is highly skilled and their fight is very close, ending in a draw. They shake hands on a match well done, and Kim is immediately starstruck by the young man. Jason heads to the showers while the others go to the juice bar. On the moon, Rita, watching the fight from above, hatches her latest and greatest plan; to destroy the rangers by creating one of her own.

At school the next day, the new kid steps in when Kim is accosted by Bulk and Skull, scaring them off with his karate skills. Kim thanks him and he introduces himself as Tommy Oliver. She invites him to hang out with her and her friends at the youth center after school, and he happily accepts. Rita begins a ritual, deciding to put Tommy to the test to see if he is worthy to be her ranger. She sends down an entire squad of Putties to ambush him in an alley on his way back from school. Even outnumbered, Tommy is able to defeat all of the putties on his own. Rita is impressed, and abducts him into a pocket dimension, where she starts her ritual. She imbues him with power and bewitches him into becoming her loyal thrall, revealing that she has her own power coin, the Dragon Coin. With the ritual complete, Tommy morphs into Rita's champion: The Green Ranger. Rita gives him his ultimate task, to defeat the Power Rangers. But first, she sends Tommy into the Command Center itself to eliminate Zordon and leave the rangers without support. His power coin granting him access, he disables Alpha with a computer virus, and Zordon realizes that Rita has found someone to give the Dragon Coin to. The Green Ranger declares that Rita will rule supreme, and tears the Command Center apart, breaking Zordon's connection with Earth. Rita is pleased, and begins the next phase of her plan. Deep in the forest, she uses her magic wand to grow Goldar into a giant.

At Billy's garage, the boys are cleaning Billy's flying car, the Radbug. Trini and Kim arrive, Kim looking depressed. Trini tells them that Tommy never showed up to meet Kim after school, and she's worried. The boys encourage her that something probably just came up that prevented him from coming, but just then they get a garbled message from Alpha-5. Their communicators shut down, preventing them from teleporting, and they take the Radbug to the Command Center. They find it in ruins with no power, and Alpha behaving erratically. Billy is able to remove the virus, and the rangers ask him where Zordon is, but Alpha is still on minimal power and has no memory of what happened. Trini points out that no one should be able to break into the Commander Center without a power coin. Just then they see Goldar in the viewing globe, heading for the city. They Morph and go to meet him, fighting off the Putty Patrol and summoning their Zords. The form the Megazord and battle Goldar, who suddenly disappears. Out of nowhere, the Green Ranger jumps onto the Megazord and is able to enter the cockpit, attacking the rangers from inside. The rangers are thrown from the zord, and Green Ranger follows, doing battle with them on the ground. He easily beats the Blue, Yellow, Black, and Pink Rangers all at once, and the Red Ranger challenges him to a one-on-one fight. The Green Ranger wipes the floor with Jason, and blasts all of the rangers with a wave of dark energy.

At the Commander Center, Alpha-5 is struggling to locate Zordon. The Power Rangers are able to teleport away from the battle, demorphed. They are shaken and full of questions, and tell Alpha about the new ranger. Alpha doesn't know anything about a Green Ranger, and suddenly shuts down completely, the remnants of the virus overloading his system. Jason suspects they are only just beginning the real battle, and tells the other rangers that they need to prepare to face Rita and her new ranger again, without Zordon's help."

Zack remarks that without Zordon, they have no way of knowing who the Green Ranger is, or where he came from. Billy is able to restart Alpha to the team's relief, but the computer is still too damaged to look for Zordon.

On the moon, Rita is basking in her first victory, and prepares to send the Green Ranger down for another attack. Goldar suggest that she give the ranger the Sword of Darkness, a weapon that was taken as a prize from one of Zordon's warriors millennia ago. Now corrupted by Rita's dark magic, it will not only make the Green Ranger more powerful, but will ensure her control over him never wanes. Zordon alone knew about the sword, and without him the Power Rangers will never see it coming. Rita puts Tommy back on Earth to await her next command. Bulk and Skull find him and try to intimidate him into apologizing for confronting them earlier, but his eyes glow and sparks of power send them cowering into a dumpster. At the youth center, Jason trains harder than ever, frustrated that Zordon never told them there was another ranger. Zack asks if he thinks Green Ranger is the one who destroyed the Command Center, and Jason thinks it's too big of a coincidence to ignore. Back at the Command Center, Billy is hard at work trying to repair the main systems. The Green Ranger did serious damage, leaving them without power, teleportation, and communicators. Billy thinks he can fix it given time, but Alpha worries they may not have enough.

Kimberly finds Tommy at school, and asks why he didn't meet her the other day. He behaves coldly to her, and tells her its not her business to worry about him, leaving her confused as to his changed attitude. Rita decides to once again test Tommy's abilities before giving him the Sword of Darkness, and summons him to the coast. She, Goldar, Squat, and Baboo all watch as he battles many Putties, unmorphed. After defeating them, Rita gives him the sword. Tommy swears that the rangers will be destroyed, starting with Jason. Zack and Kim wait at Billy's garage for Jason, so they can all fly to the Command Center in the Radbug. Meanwhile at school, Jason goes to find Tommy and tell him he needs to postpone their plans to train together. Tommy makes a show of understanding, but as soon as Jason's back is turned, Tommy hits him with a ray of energy from the Dragon Coin, making him disappear. Tommy smiles with satisfaction as the Red Ranger is no longer a threat. Jason appears in a dark space, surrounded by barred walls and thick fog at his feet. He tries to break out, but the bars electrocute and stun him back. Zack and Kim can no longer wait, and go to the Command Center without him.

Jason tries to call for help, but the communicators are still down. Goldar appears, and Jason reaches for his morpher, but Goldar has it. Zack and Kimberly make it to the Command Center, where Billy has finished repairing one of the generators, restoring partial power. The viewing globe shows them the Green Ranger has reappeared, and the computer has locked onto him. They decide to morph and try and take him down, but try to keep calling Jason. In Goldar's dark dimension, Jason attacks Goldar in an attempt to get his morpher, but is outmatched against the general without his powers. Goldar taunts him, and Jason keeps trying to attack, but is beaten down. Goldar strikes him, and pins him up against a pillar by the neck, telling him that the only reason he is still alive is because Rita gave Goldar permission to toy with him before killing him. Zack leads the rest of the rangers to attack the Green Ranger. Once again he matches them blow for blow, so they decide to call their zords. Forming the Megazord, they are able to blast the Green Ranger away, for the time being. Rita is furious, but Squat reminds her that she still has Jason. Rita calls for Goldar to finish the Red Ranger off. Goldar calls his sword, telling Jason that its almost time to end his fun.

At the Command Center, the rest of the rangers have won a temporary victory over the Green Ranger, but Alpha still cannot restore Zordon. On top of that, they have not been able to locate Jason, leaving the team extremely worried. Zordon flickers in for a moment, but fades again before he can tell the other what to do. Goldar drops Jason's power morpher and challenges him to grab it, if he dares. Jason distracts Goldar with a kick and lunges for it, but Goldar is too fast, almost cutting Jason's hand off, and kicking him to the ground. Goldar approaches the downed ranger menacingly, and raises his sword to deliver the killing blow."

At the last second, Jason is able to roll away and dive into the thick fog at their feet, hiding in the mist. Goldar is only too pleased to keep playing with the powerless ranger, and begins stabbing his sword into the ground in search of him. He reminds Jason that there is no way to escape. Rita is pleased that everything is going so well. While Goldar is occupied with Jason, she summons another one of her generals, Scorpina, who joins the Empress of Evil. At the command center, the rest of the teens and Alpha try to lock onto Zordon, but they lose power and he slips away again. Alpha tells them that the computer still hasn't found Jason, and the concerned rangers split up to try and find him.

Goldar gets closer and closer to Jason, coming right up to the hiding ranger. Goldar almost plunges his sword into Jason, who is able to move out of the way in time without being seen. He avoids Goldar temporarily, but is running out of energy. Desperate, Jason attacks Goldar from behind, managing to land a hit, but the monstrous general recovers quickly. When Jason attacks again, Goldar dodges and kicks him down. With nowhere to go, Jason is once again held at swordpoint. At the juice bar, Kim asks Ernie if he's seen Jason. Ernie says he hasn't, but Bulk and Skull offer to ""help"", in exchange for a kiss. Kimberly tricks them into kissing eachother, and they retreat in horror. Kimberly asks Ernie to keep an eye out, and she runs into Tommy. She asks him about Jason, and Tommy claims that he was supposed to meet him after school, but Jason never came. He mocks Kim for her concern and leaves, passing by and ignoring Zack. Zack and Kim compare notes, but no one has seen their friend. Kim tells Zack what Tommy said, but Zack knows for a fact that Jason went to see Tommy. They decide to go after him and ask him to tell them more. Rita spies on them running after Tommy in the park, and sends a group of putties down to waylay them. Kim and Zack are able to defeat the putty patrollers, but by the time they do, Tommy is gone. Kimberly notes how strange it was that the putties didn't go after the other teen, and they decide to head back to the Command Center.

In the dark dimension, Goldar is about to finish off Jason when the Green Ranger appears and orders him to stop. Rita has decided to let him destroy the Red Ranger personally, and Goldar leaves. The Green Ranger lets Jason get up, and Jason tries to get the Green Ranger to realize that Rita is evil and cannot be trusted, but Green Ranger is determined to serve his queen, and the two fight. Inside the Command Center, Zack and Kim tell Trini that they couldn't find Jason. Billy arrives with good news, he has finished fixing the communicator systems. Now they should be able to locate Jason from the computer and teleport him back, but with only partial power, it will take time to lock onto him. Meanwhile, Jason holds his own against the Green Ranger, for a while. He tries to convince Green Ranger that the rangers should all be on Zordon's side, not Rita's, but the Green Ranger will not hear it, and knocks the tired Jason to the ground. Jason is able to grab his power morpher, but the Green Ranger pins his arm down, and claims victory. At the command center, Billy has to enter Jason's coordinates manually in order to teleport him. The Green Ranger compliments Jason's skills as a warrior, but tells him that the fight is over. He summons the Sword of Darkness and lifts it directly above Jason's heart. Billy finishes inputting the coordinates and teleports Jason just as the sword buries itself into the ground. Jason appears back at the command center exhausted and shaken, but alive. The other rangers are relieved to see him, and he starts to explain what happened.

Goldar chastises the Green Ranger for letting Jason escape, and orders him to remain in the dark dimension and await further orders. Jason fills the others in on what happened to him after talking with Tommy at school. Zack and Kim wonder why Tommy lied about seeing him, but just then the alarm sounds, showing Scorpina on the viewing globe, attacking the city. They morph and go after her, doing battle with her and the Putty Patrol. They drive her back, and Goldar and Rita order her to retreat before she can be destroyed, to her annoyance. Rita sends Goldar to lure the rangers out and form the Megazord, where Rita has a plan to sap away the zord's power with a solar eclipse, leaving it vulnerable. In the dark dimension, the Green Ranger trains furiously, and asks Rita to let him rejoin the fight. She tells him that his time is coming soon, and he keeps training. Rita uses her magic wand to once again grow Goldar into a giant.

At the command center, the Power Rangers try to steel themselves for Rita's next onslaught. The computer finally gets a trace of Zordon, but the signal is too weak to understand what he's saying, and the power starts to wane again. The alarm sounds again, alerting them to Goldar attacking the city. Billy points out that it could be a trap, but Jason says they have no choice but to try and stop him."

Alpha tells them that the effort to locate Zordon is causing a power surge throughout the Morphin Grid, preventing them from transforming. On top of that, they completely lose power again, shutting down the entire command center. Meanwhile, Goldar continues to wreak havoc on the city. Rita plans to use Goldar to lure out the Power Rangers in their Megazord, before blocking out the sun with an eclipse, draining Megazord's solar power.

In the command center, the rangers are stuck in the base, and Alpha is unable to restore the computer. Billy get an idea, and opens up the main console. After a while, he rewires the entire system by hand, fixing the power and reconnecting to the Morphin Grid. The Power Rangers morph, and head out to stop Goldar. They confront the Putty Patrol and Scorpina on the ground, while Goldar tries to crush them under his gigantic heel. The battle causes earthquakes in Angel Grove, forcing Ernie to evacuate the youth center. Bulk and Skull decide to steal a bus to get out of the city.

With power back, the computer finds a trace of Zordon, who tells Alpha how to find him. Alpha sets the computer, but the Green Ranger breaks back into the command center and disables him. Rita arrives to the fight and tells the rangers to surrender. They refuse, so she orders Goldar to take hostages; the bus that Bulk and Skull are in. Jason tells Rita to leave the civilians out of it, but she has Goldar take the bus to the coast. Green Ranger confronts Zordon, who warns him that he will not win while the Power Rangers stand. Green Ranger tells Zordon that Rita has a plan to rule the world, and sends him out the their dimension for good. The rangers follow Goldar to the coast, and are forced to stop and watch as Bulk and Skull's bus is put on the edge of a cliff. Green Ranger is finishing banishing Zordon when Alpha reactivates, his backup system kicking in. He traps Green Ranger in a forcefield, and tries to restore Zordon The Green Ranger is satisfied that his mission was completed. Squat, Baboo, and the putties start to push the bus over the cliff, so the rangers call their zords and form the Megazord. They are able to catch it as it plummets to the ground, and get Bulk and Skull to safety. Goldar attacks Megazord, and Rita sets her plan in motion, casting an evil spell that starts a total eclipse. The Megazord starts to lose power, but the rangers are still able to hold their own against the giant Goldar. Rita grows Scorpina to join him, and the Megazord begins to struggle, continuing to depower. Goldar knocks Megazord down as the sun is completely blocked. On the brink of shutting down completely, Trini tells Jason to call the Power Sword to give them a boost. Meanwhile, Alpha is losing the connection with Zordon while the Green Ranger gloats. The Power Sword temporarily recharges the power cells, giving the rangers an edge against Goldar and Scorpina. Alpha cannot reconnect with Zordon, and is about to use the forcefield to demorph the Green Ranger and find out his identity. Just then, Goldar tells Rita it's time to enact the final phase of their plan, and she teleports the Green Ranger out of the command center and into the fight, growing him into a third giant. The rangers battle him, but are too low on power to defeat him. Scorpina stings the Megazord with her tail, and Goldar and Green Ranger unleash a devastating power attack, which tears the Megazord apart. The rangers are ejected from the cockpit as the remainder of the Megazord falls into a massive fiery crevasse. Jason, Zack, Kimberly, Trini, and Billy are demorphed from the impact, and watch helplessly as one by one, their faithful zords are consumed by the fire and destroyed. Rita rejoices in her victory.

In the command center, Kimberly says that the Power Rangers are finished this time, and Billy says the chances of finding Zordon a second time are next to nothing. Jason will not accept defeat, but Zack and Trini agree that it is hopeless. Suddenly, the computer indicates something to Alpha. He tells the rangers that the computer scanned the Green Ranger's biometrics while he was trapped in the forcefield, and has finally made a match. They look to the viewing globe as the image compiles, and they are shocked to see the true identity of the Green Ranger: Tommy Oliver."

Alpha-5 suggests it is likely that Rita cast a spell on him to make him do her bidding. Jason tells the team that they cannot give up, for they must save Tommy as well as the rest of the world. On the moon, Rita celebrates success with her minions, and tells Goldar to prepare to lead the final invasion. Without the Megazord to stop them, they are poised the conquer Earth once and for all. Alpha starts to panic that if the rangers give up, evil will win, Rita will rule Earth, and destroy everything in her wake. His point made, Zack, Kimberly, Billy, and Trini agree to keep fighting. Jason says their first priority should be to find Tommy and try to break Rita's curse. They split up to look for him while Alpha tries to locate Zordon.

At the youth center, Ernie watches the TV, showing that a giant Goldar has already begun to attack Earth, though he is confident that the Power Rangers will stop him. Kim arrives and asks if he's seen Tommy. As a matter of fact, the teen is at the youth gym at that very moment, working out. Kimberly goes to him and quietly confronts him about being the Green Ranger. Tommy immediately drops the act, threatening her, and reveals that he knows she is the Pink Ranger. She begs him to come with her so they can break Rita's spell, but Tommy is committed to serving his empress. He warns her to prepare for her and her friends' destruction. Rita finally gives her champion his final weapon, the Dragon Dagger, which can also be used as a flute. With it, he summons his own zord, the Dragon Zord, which rises from it's hiding place under the sea, and under Tommy's command, starts dealing destruction to everything it sees. Alpha is finally able to find a workaround in the computer, and starts a massive sweep to find Zordon. Kim goes to find the other rangers and tell them about her encounter with Tommy, including that he knows their secret identities. Trini runs up and tells them that a giant monster is attacking the Business District. They morph and go to find it, Tommy ordering it to kill them. The Dragon Zord's arsenal is formidable, blasting the rangers off the roof of a building with explosive missiles. They try to get through to Tommy, but Rita's conditioning is too strong. Without their zords, they are powerless to stop his wave of chaos.

At the command center, Alpha-5 is finally able to restore Zordon to his proper place. Zordon tells him that the rangers need to destroy the Sword of Darkness to break the spell over Tommy. He is also able to use his power to bring back the Dino Zords, and teleports the rangers into their respective beasts. Rita is furious, and Jason takes the Tyrannosaurus Zord to fight the Dragon Zord directly. The Red Ranger is able to stun the Dragon Zord long enough for the rest of the team to get to him and form the Megazord. The newly restored Megazord makes short work of Dragon Zord, and disables it. The Red Ranger goes down to battle the Green Ranger one-on-one. The sword and dagger make Tommy a dangerous enemy, but Jason is eventually able to knock the sword out of the Green Ranger's hand. Before he can recover, The Red Ranger disintegrates the Sword of Darkness. The spell is broken, and Tommy demorphs. The other rangers join Jason, and they demorph as Jason goes to help Tommy. Tommy is horrified at the things he's done under Rita's curse, but Jason tells him it was not his fault. He tells Tommy that he alone is in control of the Green Ranger power now, and asks him to join their team. Tommy is at first unsure that he can be trusted, but the others tell him that together, they can stop Rita. He accepts their invitation, and the group all morph as a single unit. Zordon and Alpha celebrate the sixth ranger finally uniting with the Power Rangers. He contacts the team, and tells Tommy how to use the Dragon Flute to control the Dragon Zord and combine it with the Mastodon, Triceratops, and Saber-Tooth Tiger Zords to create the Mega Dragon Zord. Rita is in rage over her defeat, and Goldar swears vengeance on the Power Rangers.

Later, in the command center, the rangers catch up with Zordon. He commends Alpha on his performance during the crisis, and calls Tommy forward to take the Power Ranger oath. Tommy agrees, and Billy presents him with his own communicator. Tommy takes his place on the team, and the six Power Rangers celebrate their victory, and their new friend."

Jason asks Billy's dad where his son is, and he says Billy is running late from working on a new invention. While all the parents socialize, Trini sees Kimberly's mother arrive with her boyfriend. Kim's mom can't find her, and asks Trini before noticing that Kim's father has also shown up. One of the other kids tells Trini that Kimberly is outside, and Trini goes to find her. On the moon, Rita observes the festivities. She comes up with a plan to abduct all the ranger's parents all at once and use them as leverage to force the rangers to surrender. Finster creates a creature called the Dramole monster to burrow underground and release a hypnotic gas that will incapacitate the adults before kidnapping them. Rita approves, and has the monster sent to Earth. Outside the youth center, Trini finds Kimberly, avoiding going inside. Kim's parents are recently divorced, and Kim feels that it was somehow her fault. Despite Trini's reassurances to the contrary, Kim is worried that since her parents have had no contact since the split, her dad won't even show up to Parent's Day. Trini tells her that both of Kim's parents are already inside, looking for her. This cheers Kim up, but before they can go inside, they are set upon by a large group of Putty Patrollers, who attack them. They hold their own, but are very outnumbered. Alpha-5 sees the situation on the viewing globe, and Zordon calls Jason and Zack to warn them of whats happening outside. Billy still hasn't made it, but the two other rangers run out to help. As they fight, the Dramole burrows its way under the youth center and starts emitting the gas. Everyone inside is suddenly teleported away, including the rangers' parents. Moments later, Billy arrives to the youth center, finding it empty. Rita spies the lone ranger, and has the Dramole engulf him in the hypnotic gas. Rather than kidnap him, she puts him under mind control and orders him to bring her the Dragon Dagger. He obeys, and teleports to the Command Center.

Outside, the Jason, Trini, Kimberly, and Zack defeat the last of the putties. As they make their way back inside, Billy teleports into the command center. He easily disables Alpha, and ignores Zordon's orders to stop. Billy takes the Dragon Dagger, telling Zordon he intends to return it to its ""rightful"" owner. He teleports away, and the other rangers reenter the deserted youth center. They contact Zordon, who orders them to the command center. He informs them of Billy's unwilling betrayal, and tells them their parents are safe, temporarily. Trini is able to reactivate Alpha, but the rangers are worried sick for their parents, and their friend. Zordon tells them about the Dramole monster, and that Rita plans to wreak havoc on the city using the Dragonzord. He has tracked Billy to Goldar's dark dimension, and the others go to stop him before he can hand over the dagger.

The four rangers morph, and teleport into the dark dimension, where Billy is about to give Goldar the dagger. They try to talk him down, but Rita's mind control is too strong. They attack Goldar, who summons putties to help him fight them. The rangers unsuccessfully try to stop Goldar, but he claims the Dragon Dagger from Billy. With his task complete, the control over Billy ends, and Goldar gloats in his success. He gives the rangers his ultimatum. Surrender their power coins, or he will dispose of their parents. Without the power of the Dragonzord, they will be unable to stop him. He gives them a timer to when they must make their choice, and retreats. Billy is horrified at what he's done, but Jason reminds him it wasn't his fault, and has him morph and rejoin them as they head back to Earth.

Goldar uses the dagger to summon Dragonzord and make it attack Angel Grove. The Power Rangers call their zords, and form Megazord. They battle Dragonzord, but are ultimately defeated. They retreat from the zord, and run into Goldar, who tells them their time is up, and they must make their decision. They contact Zordon for orders, but he tells them they are the only ones who can make such a personal choice. With no alternative, they all agree. One by one, they give up their power coins to Goldar, who puts them in a small chest. Jason demands the return of their parents, but Goldar double crosses them, saying he was never going to release the adults, and the world will be destroyed soon anyway. The rangers are devastated, but are powerless to stop Goldar from taking their coins with him. On the moon, Rita and her goons celebrate.

Zordon teleports the rangers back to the command center. He has located their parents in another dimension, hypnotized and dazed, but he cannot get them back. The rangers lament trusting Goldar to hold up his end of the bargain, but Zordon and Alpha say there was nothing else they could have done, and they made the right choice. Jason reminds his team that they still have one power coin left: the Dragon Coin. Elsewhere, Tommy Oliver arrives at the deserted youth center."

A technician, Gillings, is at work in 2098. Gillings is in the time travel division, and he contacts his director, Cosgrove, to tell Cosgrove that one of their time travel experiments inadvertently sent something back in time to 1971: a medical bag. They don't have a way to bring it back.

Two bums, Heppelwhite and former doctor William Fall, are walking through an alley and sit down to share a bottle of wine. They fight over the bottle, and Fall laments how he used to be a man of medicine and is now a wino. Fall explains that 20 years ago he had a problem with the county medical society. He says that he did some fee-splitting and careless misdiagnoses, and did an appendectomy drunk. Searching for scraps in a nearby garbage can, Fall finds the bag and opens it, finding advanced medical equipment inside. He figures that it's worth at least $10 and will let him buy a drink.

Fall and Heppelwhite take the bag to a pawnshop. A Puerto Rican mother comes in and asks for help with her sick daughter, and begs Fall to come help. Fall refuses to sell the bag and goes with the mother, confirms that the girl has a lymphatic infection, and treats her with the equipment from the bag. Fall has the mother step out in the hallway, then finds a card in the bag identifying the girl's infection. He gives the girl the recommended dosage and she instantly recovers. The mother comes back in and hugs her daughter, then blesses Fall. He packs up the bag and goes into the hallway with Heppelwhite. Heppelwhite is disappointed they didn't get paid, but Fall is happy that the mother blessed him and calls him ""doctor"". Fall wonders how medicine took since gargantuan steps without him knowing it, and finds a 2098 date on the bag's patent label.

Fall and Heppelwhite go to a homeless shelter and Fall works out the bag's medical database, and figures the bag has come from the future. He realizes it can be used to remove cancer, and calls for a homeless man, Charlie Peterson, dying of cancer. Fall tells the shelter manager, Ennis, that he found the bag, and Ennis says that he'll give the bag to the rightful owner if Fall gives it to him. Fall says that he's going to save Peterson, and uses the bag's recommended scalpel to cut out Peterson's cancer without touching the surrounding tissue.

When Ennis tries to intervene, Fall orders him out so the manager gets a policeman. Peterson tells Ennis that he has no more pain, and Fall proudly says that he's a doctor of medicine. Fall goes to the hotel where he stays, with Heppelwhite, and Fall smugly rehearses his future speech to the medical board. He tells Heppelwhite that he's going to solicit one of the most complicated cases from the medical board, and then cure the patient with the bag and says that the scalpel in the bag, if put in his neck, won't kill him. Fall will demonstrate on himself. Heppelwhite wants a part of the action, and explains that Fall will make millions of dollars from the bag while Heppelwhite gets nothing. Fall dismisses Heppelwhite's greed and says that they're going to use the bag to cure the incurable. Heppelwhite takes another scalpel out of the bag and advances on Fall.

Later, a dressed-up Heppelwhite meets with the medical society, posing as Fall. He repeats Fall's speech about embedding the scalpel in his throat and being unharmed. A doctor points out that he's be dead, and Heppelwhite rams the scalpel into his neck.

In 2098, Gillings gets an alert and tells Cosgrove that he's getting an alert that a homicide has been committed with one of the bag's instruments. Cosgrove orders Gilling to deactivate the bag.

After the ""demonstration"", the doctors of the society leave the room and comment on how Heppelwhite seemingly cut his own throat, and wonders why Heppelwhite didn't just kill himself at home instead of in front of them. One of the orderlies asks what to with the bag, and a doctor tells him to put it in the incinerator. The orderly does so, but first looks inside of it and discovers that the contents have self-destructed."

A ship makes its way through the fog, and the crew spot a lifeboat ahead with only one survivor in it, a woman. The captain sends another lifeboat to rescue it, and the captain is puzzled because there are no reported sinkings in the area. The fog is too thick to make out the ship's name on the lifeboat. The rescue crew bring the lifeboat to the liner, and the captain sees the name ""Titanic"" on the lifeboat. The Titanic sank three years ago, and the captain suspects that it's a prank.

The captain goes on deck to see the survivor. The survivor is a man dressed as a woman, and the captain has him taken to the infirmary. There's only a blanket in the lifeboat, and it appears that it's been afloat for three years, when the Titanic sunk.

The ship's doctor check the survivor, and tells the captain when he arrives that the survivor is thin and malnourished, and has frostbite although they are in warm weather. When the survivor wakes up, the captain questions him about what happened to the other passengers, and the name of the ship. The survivor says it was the Titanic, but can't remember his own name. He describes how the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank, and describes it in a sailor's terminology. The captain suggests the survivor dressed as a woman to gain access lifeboat. The survivor says that he doesn't remember. The captain goes, and the survivor asks the doctor if it's 1912. The doctor says that it isn't, and that it's 1915.

Our in the hallway, the doctor asks the captain what's going on. The captain figures that it's a hoax, but the survivor is a sailor and wonders who's service he's in. He figures the survivor was put adrift to draw them off-course during the ongoing war, and they walk past a buoy saying ""Lusitania"".

The nurse tells the doctor that the survivor won't eat although he appears like he's starving. The doctor goes in to talk to his patient, and the survivor asks what time it is. Once the doctor says it's 8, the survivor says that he was a stoker on the Titanic, and he was in the lifeboat for three years. He insists that it's possible, and tells the doctor that he was so frightened he would have done anything to survive. The survivor says that he tried to get into a lifeboat but they stopped him, so he put on a dress and knocked a half dozen people aside to get into the lifeboat. The lifeboat ropes snapped and capsized, but the survivor hung on and was the only one who did. He remembers the ship's band playing a hymn, and a great wailing. The survivor looked up and saw hundreds of faces at the railing, and then the Titanic went down, leaving nothing but bodies floating on the water.

The doctor insists that there's a rational explanation. The survivor tells him that Lusitania will be hit by a torpedo and will go down in 18 minutes. He figures that he's a Flying Dutchman, damned and doomed to an eternity of lifeboats and rescues.

Later, the doctor finds the captain and tells him what the survivor said. The captain figures that it's poetic justice and points out that why they are condemned along with the survivor. The doctor says that the survivor believes that they're just phantoms peopling the scene, so to speak. The captain isn't convinced, then turns to find the doctor has disappeared along with the lifeboat. He calls the bridge but gets no response, and then disappears himself.

The survivor is still in the sickbay, and runs to the deck and sees a periscope off the starboard bow. He yells a warning but there's no one to hear him. The survivor goes to the bridge and finds no one there, and calls a warning. The torpedo hits the Lusitania, sinking it.

Forty years later, a new ship, the Andrea Doria, spots a lifeboat from the Lusitania and assumes it's a hoax. They send a lifeboat to bring the survivor's lifeboat aboard."

She is saved by a man who introduces himself as ""the Doctor"" and tells her to flee the building. He then blows up the transmitter that controlled the mannequins from the store's roof, ravaging the building in the process. The Doctor visits the now unemployed Rose the next day and rescues her from a second attack by a mannequin's arm she had taken home unknowingly, but refuses to give her more explanations.

Rose talks with her boyfriend, Mickey Smith, about her experience, and they find a conspiracy theory website that claims a man fitting the Doctor's description has appeared throughout history. Rose and Mickey visit Clive, the man who runs the website. While Rose is in Clive's house, Mickey is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic replicant. When the fake Mickey attempts to question Rose about the Doctor, the Doctor shows up and beheads the replicant. The Doctor takes Rose to his TARDIS, which is disguised as a 20th century police box, and attempts to use the fake Mickey's head to locate the controlling signal. The head melts, but Rose realises that the transmitter must be the London Eye. The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an Auton, controlled by the Nestene Consciousness, and that if he cannot stop it by using a vial of ""anti-plastic"" liquid, it will destroy all humans on Earth. He also explains to her that he is an alien.

The Nestene Consciousness has taken up residence beneath the London Eye. The Doctor tries to negotiate with it, but it gets angry when he identifies himself as a Time Lord, blaming him for the destruction of its home planet during ""the time war."" The Nestene Consciousness activates all the autons at the Queens Arcade, where several shoppers are shot dead, including Clive. The Doctor is overpowered by the Autons, but Rose rescues him and drops the ""anti-plastic"" into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resided, killing it.

After fleeing the underground complex with Mickey, who was held hostage by the Nestene Consciousness, the Doctor offers Rose more adventures with him. Though Rose initially refuses as she is concerned about her mother and Mickey, she ends up joining the Doctor when he explains that the TARDIS can also travel in time as well as space."

The feedback incapacitates not only this Slitheen, but all the others. Upstairs, Harriet and Rose bolt for the door as the Slitheen that was Margaret Blaine goes into spasm; elsewhere, Mickey bursts into Jackie's flat and pulls her to safety, pausing only to snap a picture of the writhing Slitheen that was Commissioner Strickland with his cellphone.

The Doctor bolts out of the briefing room to fetch help, but Green manages to pull the ID card away from his fellow Slitheen's collar, and by the time the Doctor returns with a team of soldiers, it has disguised itself as General Asquith again. Sergeant Price examines the experts' bodies and confirms that they're dead, and Green accuses the Doctor of killing them. The Doctor in turn accuses Green of being an alien in disguise, but the soldiers don't buy it. The Doctor tries to flee, but soldiers surround him in the corridor outside, and Asquith orders them to execute him on the spot; fortunately, they've backed him up against a lift, and he pops inside and closes the doors before they can shoot. Asquith places the upper levels of 10 Downing Street under strict quarantine and orders Price to secure the ground floor and shoot the Doctor on sight. In the meantime, Asquith and Green head upstairs - and on the way, they dispose of their flatulent human disguises to revel in their glorious nudity.

Upstairs, Harriet realises that they've left the emergency protocols in the Cabinet room, but the Slitheen-Margaret has recovered and they are unable to return for them. The Doctor's lift stops briefly on the floor, distracting the Slitheen for a moment and enabling Harriet and Rose to hide in a nearby office. The Doctor takes the lift up one more floor and then descends via the staircase. Green and Asquith join Margaret, eager to purify their blood with a hunt; Margaret can scent the fear of her targets, and has been prolonging the hunt deliberately to make the smell more intoxicating. Margaret pulls aside the curtains to reveal Rose hiding behind them, but Harriet emerges from hiding, offering herself up in the young woman's place. Fortunately, the Doctor bursts in and drives the Slitheen back with a fire extinguisher, enabling them all to escape.

Harriet leads the Doctor back to the Cabinet room to fetch the emergency protocol booklet, but the Slitheen are only a few steps behind them. The Doctor holds them off with a bottle of port, threatening to use his sonic screwdriver to triple its flammability. When the Slitheen hesitate, he takes the opportunity to question them, and learns that they are not an invasion force, but a family business. Slitheen is not their race name, but their surname; ""Joseph Green"" is in fact Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen. Before the Doctor can learn their intentions for the Earth, however, ""Asquith"" calls his bluff regarding the port. As the Slitheen advance on him, the Doctor delivers a brief lecture on the history of 10 Downing Street... up to the installation of three-inch-thick steel security bulkheads, which he now activates, sealing the Slitheen out of the room. And, unfortunately, sealing himself and his friends inside.

Satisfied that the Doctor no longer poses a threat, the Slitheen summon the rest of the family to Downing Street, and Asquith orders Price to keep the ground floor secure and await an emergency address from the Acting PM to the people of the world. Outside, Andrew Marr tries to make sense of the variety of people who are showing up: Group Captain Tennant James of the RAF; Ewan McAllister, Deputy Secretary for the Scottish Parliament; and Sylvia Dillaine, Chairman of the North Sea Boating Club (""Quite what connects all these people, we have no idea""). All they seem to have in common is their remarkable girth and the fact that they've been invited to the upper levels of 10 Downing Street. Upstairs, the Slitheen strip off their skin-suits, and soon, the entire family has gathered, except for Sip Fel-Fotch, the one posing as Strickland, who has yet to finish with Jackie Tyler...

Mickey helps Jackie to slip back to his flat, unnoticed. There, he warns her that nobody can be trusted (casting a suspicious glance at his trash bin as he does so), and accuses the Doctor of dragging Rose into this dangerous lifestyle. Jackie begins to cry as the shock settles in, realising that the man she accused of killing her daughter has now saved her life - and that the monster that tried to kill her is still out there somewhere. Outside, Strickland sniffs the air and dismisses the other police, telling them that he'll finish with Jackie on his own...

In the Cabinet room, the Doctor places the PM and Ganesh's bodies in the cupboard, and Harriet sadly realises that she never knew the young secretary's name. The Doctor explains that the Slitheen's collars generate compression fields that enable them to shrink their bodies down to fit inside human skins; the gas is a side effect, and the PM's body was too slim for them to use as a disguise. It occurs to him that he knows Harriet Jones' name from somewhere, but he can't recall exactly where. Harriet reads the emergency protocol booklet but finds nothing of any help; Rose suggests that they launch a missile at the Slitheen, but due to an unfortunate incident in the UK's past, the United Nations holds the release codes for Britain's nuclear arsenal, and they can't launch a strike without UN approval. Mickey then calls Rose, and is able to reach her through the steel shielding thanks to the modifications the Doctor made to her cellphone. The Doctor swallows his pride and asks Mickey for help, giving him the secret password (""buffalo"") that will enable him to log onto UNIT's secure website. As Mickey works, however, Jackie demands to know whether her daughter will be safe with the Doctor - and the Doctor is unable to answer her question.

The UNIT website is monitoring an alien signal that the Doctor realises is being transmitted by the Slitheen. As the Doctor listens to the signal and tries to work out what it's saying, Strickland tracks Jackie down to Mickey's flat, strips off his skin-suit and begins to break down the door. Mickey offers to hold off Sip Fel-Fotch with a baseball bat while Jackie flees, but there's no other way out of the flat. For a moment, the Doctor is paralysed by indecision, but when Rose begs him to help her mother, he springs into action and starts looking for the aliens' weakness. He and his allies list all they know about the aliens, from the colour of their skin to the nature of their technology, the smell of their farts and, finally, the use of a hyphenated surname. This enables the Doctor to narrow down their planet of origin to Raxacoricofallapatorius, which means that the aliens' bodies are composed of organic calcium, weakened by the gas compression field - which leaves them vulnerable to acetic acid. Mickey and Jackie retreat to the kitchen, where Jackie pours all of Mickey's pickled onions, gherkins, and eggs into a container and flings it at the approaching Sip Fel-Fotch. He blinks in surprise for a moment and then explodes, coating Mickey's kitchen with a wet sludge. In the Cabinet rooms, Harriet recalls how Hannibal used vinegar to dissolve boulders while crossing the Alps, and she, Rose and the Doctor share a victory toast.

The death of Sip Fel-Fotch hits the other Slitheen hard, and Green storms out of Downing Street to speak to the press. Mickey and Jackie watch the live broadcast on TV while the Doctor, Harriet and Rose listen over Mickey's cellphone. Outside, Green addresses the nations of the world, claiming that Earth is under attack by hostile alien forces capable of unleashing massive weapons of destruction within 45 seconds; Britain lies directly beneath the mothership, and their only hope of survival is an immediate nuclear strike. Green thus begs the UN to pass an emergency resolution and release Britain's missile codes so they can strike first and save the planet.

The Doctor, finally understanding the truth, opens the bulkheads to speak to Margaret and confirm his suspicions. The Slitheen deliberately engineered a spectacular UFO crash in order to drive the world into a panic and convince the UN to release the nuclear codes. Once the Slitheen have those codes, they'll fire Britain's nuclear arsenal at every other country on Earth, triggering World War Three. Despite the showy splash-landing, the Slitheen's ship didn't actually crash; it's just parked, and the Slitheen intend to sit out the nuclear holocaust inside. Once the planet has been reduced to a radioactive cinder, the Slitheen will sell off bits of it as fuel to every cut-price, bargain spaceship out there. The signal they're sending out is an advertisement for the sale of the century; they'll make a hefty profit, at the cost of five billion lives. The Doctor orders the Slitheen to leave the planet immediately, or he'll stop them. Margaret and the Slitheen burst out laughing - but the Doctor isn't laughing, and as he closes the bulkheads, Margaret begins to get a little worried.

It's midnight in New York, and the UN Security Council have convened to vote on their emergency resolution. Dawn is breaking over London, and as far as anybody knows, it could be the day humanity fights its first interplanetary war. Green and Asquith leave Price in charge of keeping the ground floor secure, while they retreat to the Prime Minister's office to wait for the phone to ring. Giggling with anticipation, the Slitheen remove their skin-suits to greet victory in their glorious nudity.

Time is running out, and the Doctor reluctantly reveals that he can stop the Slitheen - but he can't guarantee Rose's safety. Rose is willing to let him do whatever he has to, but Jackie refuses to let him risk her daughter's life. The Doctor finally tells Jackie that this is what his life is about, standing up and making terrible decisions - and he doesn't want to lose Rose because of it. But Harriet then points out that she's the only duly elected representative in this room, and she's thus the only one with the authority to make this decision. On behalf of the people of Britain, she orders the Doctor to carry out his plan. The Doctor thus directs Mickey over the phone, giving him the passwords he needs to hack into the Royal Navy and launch a conventional, non-nuclear missile from the nearest offshore submarine, the HMS Taurean. Jackie can't bring herself to stop Mickey, as much as he himself might want her to... and Mickey, albeit reluctantly, presses the button and fires the missile at 10 Downing Street. The Doctor, Rose and Harriet remain trapped in the Cabinet offices, and the bulkheads may not be strong enough to protect them from a direct missile strike; nevertheless, the Doctor keeps in touch with Mickey, guiding him as he blocks the counter-defences on the coast, enabling the missile to slip through. Rose and Harriet clear all of the loose objects out of the cupboard, and they and the Doctor huddle inside and wait...

Downstairs, Price receives a report of the incoming missile, and triggers the fire alarm, evacuating the building. He rushes upstairs to warn the Prime Minister of the danger - and bursts into the office to find it filled with naked Slitheen, waiting for the red phone to ring. After an appalled pause, Price flees. Outside, the press and police scatter as the missile hurtles towards Downing Street; inside, the panic-stricken Slitheen begin fighting over their skin-suits, but they're trying to work out which disguise belongs to whom when the missile strikes, blowing 10 Downing Street to smithereens. The steel box that was the Cabinet room tumbles end over end into the street, and the Doctor, Rose and Harriet emerge, alive and intact. When Price rushes up to investigate, Harriet immediately takes charge, ordering him to contact the UN and inform them that the crisis is over. The Doctor and Rose watch happily as Harriet addresses the press, telling them that the human race has survived the crisis undefeated. She's come a long way from the flustered backbencher she was yesterday - and the Doctor now knows where he recognised her name. Harriet Jones is going to be a future three-term Prime Minister, the architect of Britain's forthcoming golden age.

Rose returns home for a tearful reunion with her mother, while the Doctor returns to the TARDIS and disperses the Slitheen's signal before any interested parties can pick it up. Jackie still doesn't trust the Doctor, but she's now willing to listen and learn more about Rose's new life. When the Doctor calls Rose on her cellphone and learns that Jackie has invited him to dinner, he turns the invitation down without hesitating and instead offers Rose a choice: stay home with her mother, or come with him to see things she's never seen before. When Jackie finishes making tea in the kitchen, she finds Rose packing up her belongings - and, though she tearfully begs her daughter to stay, Rose continues packing.

Night falls over London, and the Doctor forces the young boy who spray-painted ""BAD WOLF"" onto the TARDIS to scrub it clean again. Mickey has bought a newspaper, and is upset to find that the alien attack is already being dismissed as a hoax; it's almost enough to make him agree with the Doctor that humans are all idiots. The Doctor concedes that Mickey's not as bad as he thought, and gives him a CD-ROM containing a virus that will erase all mention of the Doctor from the Internet, thus ensuring that nobody can get into trouble by following him. He also invites Mickey to accompany him and Rose, but Mickey admits that he can't handle the pace of the Doctor's life. He asks the Doctor not to tell Rose, however, and when Rose shows up and invites Mickey to join them, the Doctor speaks up, stating that Mickey isn't invited. Jackie, upset, pleads with Rose to stay, but Rose assures Jackie that she's just going off travelling for a while - and, since she's travelling in a time machine, she can be back in ten seconds no matter how long she spends out there.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0853340/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"A band of benevolent Maximals track a pack of power-seeking Predacons to a mysterious planet. When they both crash-land, they establish themselves upon the planet and clash, commencing the Beast Wars.",[],TV-Y7,Release date,['Ian Pearson'],[''],[],"['prehistory', '24th century']",[],"Opening Titles -


It starts out in the dark, silent & empty vacuum of space. Suddenly a wormhole opens and a Predacon warship exits, the Darkside, followed by laser fire. It's the Axalon, a Maximal exploration ship, which exits from the wormhole as well. The two mighty ships keep exchanging fire while they both enter the orbit of a nearby planet, accompanied by two moons.

Due to the superior weaponry of the Darkside, the Axalon takes heavy damage. But instead of destroying the ship which the Predacon commander Megatron comments with: ""Now, where's the fun in THAT?""; he opts for ""a little torment"" first: While the Axalon catches up & swings to the side, he activates the Darkside's side guns, blowing several large holes into the flank of the Maximal ship, causing it to fall towards the planet's surface. In an act of desperation, Optimus Primal, the Maximal commander, orders all the stasis pods to be launched into a safe orbit. Further tumbling towards the surface, the Axalon fires its plasma cannons and manages to shoot down the Darkside, which gets onto a collision course with the planet as well. Heated up by the planet's atmosphere, the two ships descend like glowing meteroids and crash far away from each other in barren landscapes.

Above the edge of a waterfall, the scarred Axalon has come to a halt. The commander's request for a damage report is simply answered with: ""Believe me, you don't want to know.""

Inside a valley within a volcanic area, the Darkside rests exhaling smoke, surrounded by lava-filled cracks caused by the ship's impact. Megatron asks the ship's computer if they landed on the right planet, which can't be confirmed much to his discontent. The detection of energon however amuses him, up to the point where the computer's reports indicate that the excess of unstable energon would cause permanent damage to their robot forms, so he orders to activate the DNA scanners so that they can create alternate forms for protection, based on some the planet's inhabitants. A small device shoots in the air and scans the area, picking up DNA information from a few fossilized dinosaurs and invertebrates.

The Axalon starts to scan the area as well, and gathers DNA samples from several mammals, including a pair of cheetahs, a rhinoceros, a gorilla & a rat. Each of the Maximals reveals his new alternate form: Cheetor (a cheetah), Rattrap (a huge rat) & Rhinox (a rhinoceros). The group argues a bit about their animal forms, when Optimus Primal, in his new gorilla beast form emerges from the cryo regeneration chamber and admonishes them, as their beast forms are only for protection against long-term effects of the energon. Looking out of the window, he comments that it's ""one unusual planet, whereever [they] are"", which Rhinox adjoins with ""whenever"", as by the transwarp signature they could've gone through space AND time.

Back at the Predacon base, Dinobot (alternate form: a Velociraptor) insults Megatron (a T-Rex) for being an incompetent leader, having led them to the wrong planet and because he didn't detroy the Maximals when he had the chance (we remember that he didn't because of the lack of fun). Dinobot transforms into his robot form, challenging him for battle over the leadership of the Predacons. Megatron on the other hand scoffs at his attempt and leaves it to Scorponok (a scorpion), who quickly disposes of him by firing off two of his missiles. Glancing at Dinobot flying away in the distance, Megatron gathers the rest of the Predacons and orders the Maximals to be found and destroyed.

Meanwhile at the remains of the Axalon the Maximals are cleaning up the wreckage. While Rattrap keeps lamenting about the aftermath Optimus Prime tries to him why they need to stop the Predacons due to the information on the Golden Disk which they actually stole: The disk contains data about a major energon source which could provide the Predacons with enough energy to conquer the whole galaxy. Rattrap however doesn't want to see the bright side, as he's neither a soldier nor does he have a working spacecraft, which makes Optimus simply sigh at his attempts to please him. Cheetor on the other hand spots a pair of running cheetahs, and in order to proove his own speed he chases after them enthusiastically. Optimus tries to call him back but due to the interference of the large amount of the energon, the communication systems are rendered useless, which, in Optimus' opinion, is ""just prime"".

Cheetor catches up with the two fellow cheetahs and introduces himself, but the two are freaked out (perhaps because he's a talking cheetah), and speed off trying to shake him. Irritated, Cheetor tries to catch up with them. Following the two cheetahs, Cheetor encounters an oversize wasp, of which he suspects to be a Predacon, so he transforms & starts shooting at the insect. The wasp responds by transforming into Waspinator and returning fire.

The distant explosions alarm the other Maximals so they set off aboard Rhinox's back. On their way to the battle they traverse a natural stone bridge & a large pile of rocks. But they're no match for Rhinox's strength.

Meanwhile Cheetor has been chased into a trench by Waspinator's fire, where his gun malfunctions, so he takes cover behind a large boulder. When the rest of Maximals arrive, they are surprised by Megatron, who has gathered all the Predacons, including Tarantulas (spider) and Terrorsaur (pterosaur). Both sides transform into their robot/battle modes & open fire at each other. In the heat of the battle Cheetor gets hit and his leg gets stuck beneath a rock, immobilizing him. Optimus commands Rattrap to help Cheetor, but he refuses to get scrapped trying to do so. Enraged, Optimus activates his jets and flies off to rescue Cheetor himself, but is shot & nearly crash-lands, however succeeds to save Cheetor by blasting the rock away. Concurrently Rhinox grabs Rattrap and forces him to provide cover fire with him for Optimus & Cheetor so that they can escape the trench. The four Maximals are able to retreat while the Predacons are distracted by an energon buildup, which forces then to transform back to their beast modes.

On their way back to base Optimus Primal rants Rattrap about his disobedience in the battle, as he could've provided him with better cover fire, as the damage he sustained will take long to be repaired internally. He also begins to question why one of the Predacons was missing in the battle, but his question doesn't remain open for long: Right in the middle of the stone bridge stands Dinobot, who announces that he left the Predacons so that he can join the Maximals - as their leader...

Jeff does his morning jog. When he gets home, he sees his package. He goes to Clarence's house and Sumo's RV and wakes them up. He shows them the toy at his house and they want to play with it, but Jeff wants to put it on the shelf and never open the box so it can stay in mint condition. They go in the living room to watch the animated show based on the toy. Clarence is in a dinosaur suit and asks Sumo to come in the kitchen. Clarence tells Sumo that he can't stop thinking about the the toy and that he really wants to play with it, Sumo eventually decides to help and gives a thumbs up when the coast is clear so Clarence can go into Jeff's room to get the toy. Clarence copies the cover of the toy's box on a printer and tapes it on a tissue box, then he puts that on the shelf where Jeff's toy used to be. Sumo is watching the show when Clarence calls him to come outside. Clarence and Sumo flies the toy but it bumps the house and it's head falls off. So Clarence tries to fix it but it's no use. Jeff then comes outside and says they should play with the toy. They go into Jeff's room, but Sumo says he's hungry, so that Jeff wouldn't notice his toy is missing. Jeff and Sumo goes to the kitchen to get some food. Clarence tries to staple the toy's head back on, but ends up breaking the head into pieces. Clarence then goes into the bathroom and squirts everything he can find in there on the toy but it's still not fixed. In the kitchen, Sumo wants Jeff to get him a snack that Jeff never heard of, but he tries to find it. Then, Clarence calls Sumo into the living room, Clarence says he couldn't fix the toy, Sumo asked if he tried using glue, but Clarence didn't think of trying that, so Sumo suggested that Clarence should tell the truth. As Jeff walks in and asks who was copying his toy box, he saw that his toy was broken, then he grinded his teeth and some of his teeth came out. Clarence tried to tell a story about how a raccoon broke the toy, but Sumo just admitted that Clarence did it. Jeff angrily yelled at Clarence, and started hitting him as Clarence tries to confess Jeff, but did not listen, until Sumo called the company who made the toy and tricked them into giving him a free one. Later, all of them play court and Sumo says both Clarence and Jeff are guilty, then the episode ends with Clarence, Jeff and Sumo lying on the roof as Sumo flies the robot toy."

Penny is from Nebraska Sheldon was sent to boarding school as a boy, due to his work with lasers.

Sheldon thinks Leonard, who is immediately interested in her, is chasing a dream he will never catch. Sheldon has 212 friends on MySpace and likes them as he doesn't have to meet any of them. Sheldon is not a fan of any type of human contact and cannot understand Leonard's need to get close to Penny

Leonard invites Penny to his and Sheldon's apartment for Indian food (as a courtesy to a neighbor who has just moved in next door), where she asks to use their shower since hers is broken. Sheldon has his own spot to sit on the couch (the spot is a nice distance from the radiator (it is close enough to the radiator to be warm, but not so close to be stifling), in the middle of a cross breeze (when you open windows at both ends of the apartment) and at a nice angle to the TV (There is no glare on the TV, and Sheldon doesn't have to turn his neck to watch it)).

While wrapped in a towel (she had come out of the shower to ask for Leonard help in switching the shower to the bathtub.. the handle sticks and hence required experience to operate), she gets to meet their visiting friends Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg), a wannabe ladies' man (Caltech department of applied physics) who tries to hit on her, and Rajesh Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar), who is unable to speak to her as he suffers from Selective Mutism in the presence of women. Penny is a Sagittarius, claims to be a vegetarian but loves steak, an aspiring actress, but waitresses at the cheesecake factory. Leonard is lactose intolerant. Sheldon's unawareness of social protocols embarrasses Leonard, but he is helpless to stop it

Leonard is so infatuated with Penny that, after helping her use their shower, he agrees to retrieve her TV from her ex-boyfriend Kurt (Brian Patrick Wade). However, Kurt's physical superiority overwhelms Leonard's and Sheldon's combined IQ of 360, and they return without pants or TV. Sheldon had repeatedly warned Leonard against taking on Kurt, but Leonard underestimated the odds of being humiliated and felt that doing this favor for Penny would increase his chances of starting a relationship with her. The guys were not allowed into the building by Kurt, but then the genius duo were outsmarted by a duo of girl scouts who press every buzzer in the building and somebody simply lets them in, but pressing the door opener in their apartment. Penny, feeling bad, offers to take the guys out to dinner, initiating a friendship with them."

She gives her keys to her apartment for the same. The guys argue about whether Superman has ability to fly or is it a feat of strength. Sheldon postulates that it is a feat of strength similar to leaping tall buildings. He has energy storing Kryptonian skin cells that help him fly at night. When Sheldon and Leonard carry a box of flat pack furniture (3 flights of stairs & reasonably heavy) that came for Penny (Sheldon is sure that this favor for Penny wont increase Leonard's chances of having sex with her), Sheldon is deeply disturbed at how messy and disorganized her apartment is.

Later that night, while Penny sleeps, the obsessive-compulsive Sheldon, unable to sleep, sneaks into her apartment to organize and clean it. Leonard finds out and reluctantly helps him. Sheldon asks Leonard to speak in a lower register as evolution has made women more sensitive to higher registers so that they can hear their crying babies.

The next morning, Penny is furious to discover that the guys had been in her apartment while she was asleep in her bedroom. Sheldon tries to apologize to Penny but fails by remarking that Leonard is a ""gentle and thorough lover"". He also wants to know if Penny objects to the guys breaking in at night, while she was sleeping, or does she also object to the new organizational paradigm. Penny is speechless and shuts the door on Sheldon, after taking her keys back from Leonard. Later, Penny encounters Raj in the hallway. Though he cannot talk to Penny, she calms down whilst telling him about the issue (Raj just continues to listen to Penny, and she mistakes that for his good listening abilities), reasoning the guys were just trying to help her, and then hugs Raj.

Then Leonard apologizes to Penny, prompting Penny to forgive and hug him. Later the guys assemble Penny's entertainment center after totally ignoring Ikea's instructions. They decide that the Swedish designs are inefficient (which is why Sweden does not have a space program). The decide to use the empty space behind the flat screen TV to install a sound system. They also decide to install a liquid heat exchanging device, built from using aluminum pipes and other industrial grade materials. The guys disperse to arrange the materials and an acetylene torch and gather at Penny's apartment in an hour. In the meanwhile Penny finds the instructions self explanatory and goes about building the furniture all on her own.

Title reference: Sheldon having Big Bran cereal (with higher fiber content) after Penny finds out her apartment has been rearranged.

Leonard had created a system of taking Penny's mail on a daily basis, so he would be able to hand it over to her whenever she returned home from work and this would be his excuse to meet Penny everyday. The guys persuade him to date someone at work, so he approaches fellow scientist Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert). He proposes a bio-chemical experiment and Leslie figures that he is asking her out. In an experiment to strip the usual dating procedure to its essentials, she suggests fast forwarding to a kiss (which would eventually determine their sexual compatibility and their mutual desire to move forward to a sexual relationship). The whole exchange is very science oriented and hypothesis based.. She finds their kiss good but unexciting (she claims she had no arousal, which kind of perplexes Leonard, who takes this as an evaluation of his performance as a kisser), so she turns him down.

As Leonard becomes more depressed (Howard takes the guys to a salsa class with old women, where Howard goes to pick up desperate cougars when he needs a hook-up), thinking of buying a cat (hypoallergenic in view of Sheldon's asthma - though in later episodes Leonard is the one with asthma.. possible names include Einstein, Newton and Admiral Fuzzy Boots), Sheldon points out Leonard was not actually rejected by Penny as he never asked her out, so Leonard asks her out to dinner. As she misinterprets this as an invitation to hang out with all the guys for dinner at their apartment.

Before the ""date"" Leonard is sweating bullets. He asks Sheldon for advise, but as usual Sheldon is clueless about Leonard's nervousness and is not able to offer any useful suggestions.. Leonard is sweating so hard, that eventually he has to head back to the bathroom for another shower before his dinner with Penny.

At the dinner (at a semi-fancy restaurant), Leonard devises reasons for their absence from the date (Raj and Haword had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy). Penny says the man Leonard saw was not her boyfriend: it was only casual weekend sex (for 36 hrs straight) which helps her get over relationships. Leonard, now excited, regains his confidence, but he accidentally hurts himself and Penny has to take him home (Leonard vomits on the way back, in Penny's car.. he manages to vomit mostly outside the car and it is suggested that some of the vomit lands up on a biker on the road). Thus the date with Penny comes to a premature end and Leonard is not able to pursue the matter forward due to the awkwardness of the situation.

In the end, Leonard does not find the courage to reveal his true feelings to Penny (she asks if this was a date), though she suspected what he was up to. Title reference: One of the names Leonard was considering for his cat."

Sheldon believes that Eric has done no original research in 25 yrs and has instead written a series of books that demean physics via a series of anecdotes, meant to be read during potty.

Sheldon's change of circumstance triggers a downward spiral of depression in which he fails to improve scrambled eggs (he goes shopping with Penny and gives her a lecture about maintaining safe distance with cars while driving. Multi-vitamins are a waste (they are just a recipe for expensive urine since the human body can only absorb so much vitamins), why oranges are a vegetable yet put in the fruit section of the grocery.

Sheldon also has a business idea for creating a mail order company for bulk supplies of female hygiene products.

Worried, Leonard calls Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper (Laurie Metcalf). When she visits, the men realize she is the complete opposite of their expectations: she is sweet, down-to-earth, a devout Christian, and a loving and caring mother. Sheldon is of course livid at Leonard for calling his mother, as it seems that Sheldon is not able to ignore Mary as he does the rest of his friends Howard tries to hit on Mary, which is gently pushes back. Mary cooks chicken and asks Raj if that is one of the animals that Indians worship. She tells a story of how at 13, Sheldon built a nuclear reactor in his shed and tried to buy uranium from Africa. FBI showed up at the door and gently explained to him that it was illegal to keep yellow uranium cake in the shed.. Sheldon had a fit and built a sonic death ray to kill the neighborhood kids. The kids were not impacted by the death ray, but the dogs went crazy around it..

Sheldon is working on a DNA structure for a silicon based life-form. Mary finally forces Sheldon to apologize to Eric (she explains to Sheldon that it is fine for Sheldon to be smart, but it is not OK for him to throw this in everyone's face and making them feel bad about it), who is given his job back after she flirts with Dr. Gablehauser. Later that night at his apartment, Sheldon asks Mary if Eric is going to be his new father (to which Mary gives an ambiguous answer) and the luminous fish works..

Penny comments that Leonard and Leslie make a cute couple and Leonard drives Sheldon nuts asking what it means. Leonard is not able to decide if Penny is jealous about his possible hook-up with Leslie or is genuinely happy that Leonard is in a relationship now. Sheldon, as usual, could not care less about Leonard's predicament Meanwhile Sheldon is not happy that he is being forced to try a new burger at the cheesecake factory, as he usually he eats his burgers at the Big Boy.. it is established that Sheldon dislikes change and prefers continuity over everything else

After the quartet practice in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, Leslie seduces Leonard for the night (surprising Leonard since she turned him down earlier) (Leonard also confirms that there is nothing going on with Penny, when she asks).. Leslie and Leonard fast pace their quartet practice as a way of foreplay, and quickly retire to Leonard's room for sex Sheldon is very uneasy, and he repeatedly asks Penny's advice (there is a tie hanging on Leonard's door). Penny says everyone knows this as they went to college. Sheldon comments that he was 11 yrs old when he went to college and doesn't know what the tie stands for. Penny is happy that Leonard is ""getting busy"" when she hears Leslie exclaiming that Leonard is a beast.. She also gives the couple their privacy and moves away from Leonard's door.

Sheldon is not sure what social protocol to follow with Leonard and Leslie when they come out of their ""session"".. The next morning, while Sheldon is sleeping, Leslie corrects Sheldon's work on his board.. This makes Sheldon livid as he does not consider Leslie to be his intellectual equal, although Leonard repeatedly points out that Leslie's correction removes the issues Sheldon was having with his equations

Penny later congratulates Leonard, who again tries to figure out what she meant. He is again unsure if Penny is jealous of him and Leslie or if she is genuinely happy that he is in a relationship. Leonard decides to pursue a real relationship with Leslie rather than an imaginary one with Penny, but at her lab, Leslie makes it clear she is not interested in a relationship: she just needed him for a one-night stand to satisfy her sex drive - which is now satisfied until New Year. Leonard tries to make plans with Leslie for New Years, but she pushes him back saying that he is smothering him and that she needs her space Leonard later tells Penny, who reassures him that everything is good between them and walks away smiling.

At first all 4 dress as Flash. They all gather at Sheldon's apartment (where Sheldon chides them for not having a costume meeting to begin with), where it is decided that nobody will dress as Flash.. Raj suggests that they could stand one behind the other and seem like one flash going really fast, but Howard nicks the idea saying that he needs to go solo to impress a girl.. Leonard calls dibs on Frodo.. So, the costumes are: Leonard as Frodo, Sheldon as the Doppler effect, Howard as Robin Hood (but everyone confuses him as Peter Pan) and Raj as Thor the Norse God (not the Marvel's character)

At the party (the guys reach at 7:05 pm for a 7 pm party.. they are worried that they are late, only yo find that they are the first ones there and Penny herself is yet to take a bath and get ready for the party) they have problems socializing: Sheldon is unable to explain his Doppler effect costume since none of Penny's friends are physicists or smart enough to understand it; Raj (dressed as Thor) cannot speak to women; Howard as Robin Hood is mistaken for Peter Pan; and Leonard (dressed as Frodo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings) is insecure (he knows that this is the first time Penny is seeing him as part of her social peer group and he doesn't want to come across as a nerd). Leonard's middle name is Leaky (his dad worked with anthropologist Lewis Leaky decades ago).

Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt (underdressed as a very tall, muscular caveman) later shows up and aggressively confronts Leonard. Leonard decides to stand up to Kurt feeling confident that he can outsmart Kurt with his intellect. This goes to plan as Kurt has no understanding of the smart repartee that Leonards gives to Kurt's insults. But then Kurt gets physical and literally picks up Leonard and is about to hang him on a door nail, when Penny intervenes and gets him to drop Leonard. This causes Leonard (and later Penny) to leave. Penny goes to check on Leonard and apologizes for Kurt's behavior.

Sheldon serves Leonard a hot beverage as he is upset. Penny is very upset, but Leonard tells her she is perfect, and they kiss, though Penny confesses she is drunk and Leonard doesn't want to take advantage of her. They kiss again, in sight of Kurt, Leonard saying ""That's how we roll at the Shire!"" before locking his apartment door in panic.

Meanwhile, Howard cannot find Raj, who is at home sleeping with a girl who finds him to be a ""very good listener"". Basically Raj was not able to speak to a woman, and she mistook this for Raj's phenomenal listening abilities and then proceeded to sleep with him. Title reference: Leonard's Halloween costume."

Penny replaces Howard as a Halo 3 player and displays natural talent, to Sheldon's disbelief. She responds by blowing up Sheldon's game character multiple times during the game, causing Sheldon to quit the game commenting that ""nobody can be that attractive and talented at video games at the same time""

To avoid the noisy ""lovers"", Penny sleeps on Leonard and Sheldon's couch that night (after Sheldon explains his morning bathroom schedule and tells Penny which way to sleep on the couch - feet pointing towards the door). As Penny retires for the night, the camera pans to Raj, whom everyone had forgotten and who slowly and quietly exits the apartment Next day Sheldon complains to Leonard about missing Dr Who on TV at 6:15 am on a Saturday since Penny is sleeping on the couch.

Howard cashes his Bar Mitzvah bonds to buy her stuff).

Distraught at the odd number in the group (they need pairs of players to play Halo 3), Sheldon invites Penny to play Halo again, but she prefers to go dancing with her friends instead

The guys believe their group is falling apart and go to speak to Howard. There they hear Howard's mother (Carol Ann Susi) arguing loudly with Christy (Howard's mother calls Christy a Gold Digger, but Christy is not willing to back down either), causing her to leave. Howard, single again, goes to play Halo with the guys, and the group is restored, completely ignoring Penny and her three attractive dancing friends who briefly appear at the door and offer to have sex with them.

Koothrappali (Brian George) and Mrs. Koothrappali (Alice Amter), to his friends via webcam (Raj's parents just got broadband). His parents think that Sheldon and Leonard are in a gay relationship, which they explain that they are not. Their vehement denial of the idea convinces the Koothrappalis even more that there is something there

However, Raj is angry when his parents try to arrange him a date with Lalita Gupta (Sarayu Rao), a childhood friend and dental student, as he cannot talk to women. Also Raj thinks that Lalita is a fat woman, since she used to be very chubby as a child, when they played together back in India. Sheldon advises Raj to marry the girl his parents have arranged, since marrying for love is a relatively recent phenomenon even in Western civilizations, while arranged marriages have been the bedrock of Indian culture for thousands of years.. Raj is angry at Sheldon for lecturing him on his own culture.

To Raj's annoyance, Howard, uses a fake Indian accent to impersonate Raj, phones Lalita to set up a date for them. Meanwhile, Penny takes up bar tending at the cheesecake factory for some extra money. She practices mixing drinks with the guys, and they discover Raj is able to speak to women after drinking alcohol. Meanwhile Sheldon wont drink anything, and continues to ask Penny give him a virgin Cuba Libre (rum and coke, without the rum.. which means essentially coke, diet)

They decide his date should be at Penny's restaurant so she and the guys can keep an eye on Raj's behavior when drinking (and to ensure that he doesn't over drink). On his date, Raj becomes an obnoxious drunk (He talks about how dentists as a profession is most prune to suicides). He also comments on how Lalita used to be fat.. Lalita is forced to put up with the encounter as even her parents wanted her to meet Raj as a prospective marriage match Sheldon finds this objectionable and he flatters Lalita with compliments comparing her to Princess Panchali, an Indian fairy tale princess (with eyes fashioned from the stars and ruby lips in front of which the roses refused to bloom). Lalita is impressed with the nice way Sheldon treats her and is anyways not having a good time with Raj. Lalita takes Sheldon away for a meal, to Raj's horror.

When Raj tries to explain all this to his parents, they are angry about his drinking. They are worried how they will ever have a conversation with Lalita's parents now and how they would explain Raj's behavior. Upon returning, Sheldon does apologize to Raj for leaving with his date. Leonard asks Sheldon if he plans to see Lalita again, but he replies that he already has a dentist. The next time, Penny mixes some rum in Sheldon's diet coke and he ends up on the piano, entertaining the guests ... Penny tells Leonard that he does his experiments, and she does her own..

He is even able to switch on the stereo and control its volume from Howard's laptop. To impress Penny, Howard enables public access and now people in China are able to control their lights), and in the trash can Leonard finds an invitation to him and Sheldon to present their joint research at an academic conference.

Howard wants to go since the after parties of these conferences are legendary. Sheldon disapproves of presenting research in person (he does not want to stand in front of a room full of strangers, none of whom are his intellectual peers and explain his work to them.. He simply wants the rest of the world to take his word for his observations and conclusions, without behind subjected to reviews), but Leonard defies him and goes alone (The research was Sheldon's idea, but Leonard designed the experiment to prove the hypothesis).

This causes a rift between the two which Penny tries to mend but accidentally makes worse (Penny tells Sheldon that Leonard said that he would still be able to design his experiment without Sheldon's ""lucky hunch""). Leonard has to decide what to wear for the conference and takes Penny's help. Penny gets into Leonard's wardrobe and discards half his clothes right off the bat. She even forbids him from donating the clothes to anyone as he wont be helping anybody. Penny is also alarmed to find a corduroy suit in his wardrobe, as they don't make them anymore.. Leonard also owns a Battlestar Galactica flight suit, which he says he didn't wear to Penny's costume party, since it is a flight suit and not a costume. Finding nothing else for Leonard to wear, the duo finalize the corduroy suit.. Leonard also has a 2 sided tie which Penny abhors.

Leonard shows up to the conference with Penny, Howard and Raj. The conference has an audience of 25, which Leonard explains is ""Woodstock"" for a particle physics conference.. Leonard starts with a joke to get over his nervousness and closes strongly Sheldon appears at the conference (he was sitting hidden at the back and reveals himself at the end of Leonard's presentation) and tries to discredit Leonard's presentation (he says that Leonard skipped over the part about how Sheldon got the inspiration for the research while strolling in the park and observing behavior of randomly running kids.. Leonard says that this is simply an anecdote and not central to the hypothesis or the experiment) by attempting to ""blow up"" Leonard's head with his mind a la the movie Scanners, starting a physical altercation between the two.

Howard films the fight on his cellphone and puts it on YouTube (the video starts trending on social media), but angers Penny by also posting a photo on Facebook of her sleeping on his shoulder during the presentation, entitled ""Me and my girlfriend"". Penny also tries to ""blow up"" Howard's head with her mind

Sheldon is worried and wakes up Leonard at 2 am that Leonard's lie was inadequate. If Penny was to check the schedule on the symposium website, she would figure out that there is no symposium on the day of her performance. He devises an intricate lie about Sheldon's non-existent substance-addicted cousin ""Leopold Houston"" (or Lee) needing an intervention on the night of her play.

Sheldon aims to spin an undetectable web of lies. Leopold has a Facebook page, a blog that chronicles his descent into substance abuse, and a desperate, but hopeful, listing on e-harmony.com for a possible mate. Leonard is to take Sheldon since the intervention is in Long Beach and Sheldon doesn't drive. Now the lie from Leonard is for a noble purpose, to spare Sheldon the embarrassment of admitting that he has a substance addict for a cousin. So, now Penny is expecting Leonard to lie about going to a symposium, while Sheldon and Leonard pretend to go to the intervention in Long Beach. Penny even defends Leonard and Sheldon in front of Howard and Raj when they are angry about not being invited to the symposium.

Sheldon is very obsessed with his lie's credibility. He again wakes Leonard in the middle of the night, while Leonard insists that Penny bought the lie and Sheldon should let the matter rest. Sheldon has Toby Loobenfeld (DJ Qualls), a research assistant who double majored in Physics and Theatre, impersonate cousin ""Leo"" to convince Penny the lie is true. Sheldon says that a person in Leo's mental state would never agree to go to rehab, but they would plausibly convince cousin Leo to come home with them. Sheldon tells Penny that he was unable to convince Lee to go to rehab, but instead convinced him to leave the hotel and live with them for a few days. Tony Ad Libs by ignoring Sheldon's script. In the script, the cousin has a genetic disposition towards mental disorders, which pushed him towards substance use. But Leo invents a sexual abuse encounter (with a naval priest) in the Philippines. In the end, Leonard must still see the video of Penny's performance (which he was hoping to avoid), and Penny and ""Leo"" start flirting when Penny listens to Leo's sob stories and allows him to rest his head on her shoulders. ""Leo"" knows Leonard has a thing for Penny and hopes to lure her away from Leonard and start dating her instead.

Penny tells Leonard that the performance went well, but by the end only 2 people were left in the audience. She had hoped that the casting professionals would approach her after her performance with other offers, but this never materializes.

Sheldon, a Germophobe according to Leonard, freaks out (he takes a germ culture from his throat and considers all doctors working in hospitals as inferior to his own intellect.. he is not happy about putting his own life in their hands) and becomes sick, becoming demanding (He demands that Leonard take his throat swab, and put a pancake measuring cup in the bathroom to measure his urine output to check if his kidney's are shutting down) on top of his already obnoxious personality.

Familiar with Sheldon being sick, Leonard and the guys hide from him at a Planet of the Apes series marathon, leaving Penny to care for Sheldon. Leonard lies to Sheldon that he was called into work at 6 30 am on a Sunday. Leonard calls to warn Howard, who impersonates his own mother on the phone when Sheldon calls and says that Howard is still sleeping and to call his own mother to take care of him. This warning protocol was put in place when Sheldon had an ear infection a few yrs back. Sheldon shows up at the cheesecake factory, looking for soup. Penny has no choice but to leave her work shift and take Sheldon back home, as he was infecting her entire station

Sheldon tells Penny that he has never been sick alone before and needs someone to take care of him. The last time he was alone was in Germany, when he was 15 and a visiting professor. His mother was called back to the US when his father fell sick. Sheldon ended up getting an enema as he didn't know the local language and the local nurse misunderstood him. He makes Penny rub Vaporub on his chest and sing soft kitty (which he teaches her).

However, Leonard breaks his glasses in the cinema and has to retrieve his spare pair from the apartment, piloted by Howard and Raj using a laptop, an endoscope, and a Bluetooth helmet camera worn by the short-sighted Leonard. Leonard has to crawl on his hands and legs (and guided by Howard and Raj's directions) to get close to his room.. he tries to place a sensor in front of Sheldon's door, that would beep and warn everyone just in case Sheldon got up and started moving around.

Penny intercepts Leonard and abandons him to his fate with Sheldon. Leonard tries to escape, but runs into a wall and nearly knocks himself out. In the end, injured Leonard and sick Sheldon sit miserably on the couch. Sheldon eats a grilled cheese sandwich while Leonard applies a cold pack to his head

Kim is also the youngest winner of a prestigious scholarship, breaking an age record which was previously held by Sheldon. Howard and Leonard enjoy this turn of events as they can see that Sheldon has finally met his own match

Sheldon loses faith in his own research and annoys his friends by criticizing their work more than ever and forcing his own contributions on them (He calls Howard the Oompah Loompah of science as he is an engineer). He wants to collaborate with Howard who is working on building a space shelf for the space station (by telling him to use carbon Nano-tubes instead of titanium), who tells him to go away. He then tells his friends to abandon all their work and collaborate with him to solve the nuclear fusion problem in the next 10 years (12 years tops)

Finding his physics work useless, he aims for the Nobel Peace Prize by attempting to solve all Middle East conflicts, but he annoys everyone, including a Jewish professor, with his proposal that an exact duplicate of Jerusalem be built in the Mexican desert. He also asks Howard if an exact replica of the wailing wall in the middle of the Mexican desert would be acceptable to him.

The others, tired of Sheldon's behavior, decide to distract Kim with girls of the same age. They figure that they can restore Sheldon's confidence if they distract Kim with adolescent pleasures. Their plan unexpectedly works at Kim's welcome party (where Howard and Raj send out a memo that its bring your teenage daughter to work day.. the email had gone to all faculty members who had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16), and Kim leaves with a blonde 15-year-old. The gang is left perplexed as the entire while they were trying to figure out how to fix up Kim with a girl, while he managed to do that all on his own. Howard has memories of how a girl who preferred jocks, lured him into the back seat of his mother's car and then exposed him as the entire football team made fun of him with his pants down. Leonard has memories of how a girl made him do her homework the entire yr and made him hold her head up in the toilet, while she considered him a ""friend"" and had feelings for the other guys at school who never cared for her.

Sheldon resumes his research while the others are perplexed at how easily Kim was able to get a girl. In a park, the guys spot him drinking heavily and making out. They feel sorry at his demise, but the victorious Sheldon mocks him that he was not focused enough.

Raj suggests the Bengal tigers, but Sheldon argues that pound for pound the ants are the most ferocious warriors in the animal kingdom. Raj mocks that at least no-one can incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. He wont let anyone else on the team answer any questions. The group had asked Penny to host a mock competition for them to test their readiness, but it descends into a fight as Sheldon wont allow anyone else to answer any questions. He nominates himself as the team captain (he even suggests a Star Trek based theme uniform where Sheldon would don the Captain's Gold, while the rest would wear the crewman's red colored uniforms), and they eject him from the team.

Sheldon, upset, vows to form his own team and compete against them. The guys, in need of a fourth member, ask Leslie Winkle. She at first declines, but accepts on hearing they are opposing Sheldon, who has often criticized her research and gender. She calls Sheldon a misogynist who had suggested that Leslie leave her research for a career in housekeeping, laundry and child bearing The guys name themselves PMS (Perpetual Motion Squad, an unintentional pun on pre-menstrual syndrome). Howards gets printed shirts made for the entire team

Sheldon's team is named AA (Army Ants, an unintentional pun on Alcoholics Anonymous), and comprises Sheldon (who forbids answers from his teammates), the 3rd floor janitor, the lunch lady, and her son (or possibly her butcher). Penny also comes to witness the contest, but ends up dosing off.. The contest is really close (with both teams going head to head) and by the last question the PMS is leading the AA 1175 to 1150. The last question is worth 100 points.

The last question is an equation that needs to be solved to get the answer. Leonard presses the buzzer, but didn't know the answer. He guesses 8.4, which is wrong. All Sheldon's team had to do was to solve the equation to win the contest. But Sheldon himself was clueless on how to solve the equation. PMS win when Sheldon, unable to answer the last question, refuses to accept the janitor's answer, which is actually correct: he explains that despite working as a janitor in America, he was a physicist in the former Soviet Union. Sheldon would rather lose alone than win as part of a team. Howard is ecstatic at the win and descends into the crowd and tears off his shirt..

Leonard was hoping that it would sell for thousands of dollars and just wanted to be part of the experience and bid $800 on it. But to his surprise and horror, there were no more bids on the auction..

The guys had each put in $200 to help Leonard buy the machine for $800. When the machine arrives at their apartment lobby, they figure out its a full sized replica and not a miniature, which is why there were no bids on it. The men's efforts to move the cumbersome object into the apartment cause Penny to lose a work shift (Sheldon had proposed that Penny goes to the roof, jump to the other building and take their stairs. But the gaps was 3 feet and she scraped her knee, the door was locked, so she took the fire escape which ended at the 3rd floor. She had to enter the apartment of an Armenian family who insisted she stay for lunch. It was 8 courses of lamb and they tried to fix her up with their son), and she lashes out at them for their obsession with childish memorabilia.

This upsets Leonard, who decides to sell all his collectibles. Raj offers to buy his time machine share for $300 but wants the machine installed in his balcony. But Sheldon offers more money to Leonard to keep the machine in his apartment.

His friends try to dissuade him, but they also want his collectibles and argue over who should get what. Howard offers to pay Leonard $2600 from his Bar-Mitzvah bonds and 2 trees in Israel for his entire collection, but Leonard refuses since he knows that if he sells to any one of his friends, the other 2 will be very upset. Sheldon tries to block Leonard's way, upon which Leonard threatens to remove a mint condition Jordy action figure (without his visor) from its box, which would make it lose all its value.. The guys argue over Leonards actions, which gains Penny's attention who comes out of her apartment.

Sheldon later accuses Penny of hypocrisy, pointing out her own love of such things as Hello Kitty or Care Bears or My Little Ponies. Penny apologizes to Leonard (says she was upset the previous day) and dissuades him from abandoning the things he loves; he decides to keep his belongings. His hope of a relationship with her is thus very briefly renewed until her current boyfriend Mike (Andrew Walker) appears and pulls her into her apartment. Sheldon later has nightmares of being attacked by Morlocks (in the first nightmare, Sheldon lands in a distant future where he is attacked by Morlocks, and wakes up in the 2nd nightmare where he agrees with Leonard to remove the machine only to find that Leonard had hired Morlocks to move the machine, who again attack Sheldon), and persuades Leonard to return the time machine replica.

Predictably, the men all awkwardly flirt with her (Raj talks about how Indians invented the Kamasutra and Pyjamas and Howard says Hebrews invented circumcision), so Penny comes to her rescue (she invites her to get her nails done). Leonard, hoping for an advantage over Howard and Raj, convinces Sheldon he is Missy's guardian as concerns her choice of partner. He says that after their dad's death it is Sheldon's responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable partner. Also since Missy shares Sheldon's DNA, within her future progeny is the possibility of giving birth to another genius like Sheldon.

Sheldon agrees with Leonard hypothesis and deems all three guys to be unsuitable for her. Sheldon believes that since Missy shares his DNA, inside of her is a potential for another him (a boy genius). Leonard is lactose intolerant, Raj cant speak to women without experimental medication and Howard doesn't have a PhD and is a tiny man who lives with his mother.

Leonard wins the video game competition (a boxing match on Nintendo Wii) between the 3 and is the first to get a shot at Missy. Leonard approaches Penny's apartment (who is still dating Mike) and seeks Missy for a dinner date. She turns down Leonard, and then Howard, who fails to charm her with simple conjuring tricks.

However, on the day of the party, Penny discovers Sheldon has not yet bought a present (Sheldon finds the idea of gift giving pointless as its a never ending cycle till death, leaving one party into the debt of the other), so she has to drive him to a computer store to buy one (Howard asks Penny to tell Sheldon that its a non-optional social convention). At the computer store, Sheldon wants to buy Leonard a DVD burner, which he needs. But Penny argues that Sheldon should buy something thoughtful that Leonard not think of himself. So, Sheldon decides to buy a WiFi router for Leonard.. But in his own way, he agonizes over the choices and in the end makes Penny choose one.

Meanwhile, Howard has the task of keeping Leonard out of his apartment before the party. and Raj to make sure that the apartment is set up for the party and the guests are well looked after. Howard pretends to eat a peanut bar, to which he is allergic, so that Leonard will drive him to the emergency room.

However, Sheldon's lack of focus at the computer store (he starts helping other visitors to the computer store like a SME business owner who needs a p2p network connector with a range extender.. also a man who wants to buy a hard disk drive, but doesn't know what type of bus or even the type of computer he has) means Howard has to distract Leonard even longer, and he eventually actually eats the peanut bar at the hospital (after Penny promises to point out all the easy girls to him at the party.. Like one who was fat, and has low self esteem. One who hates her dad and sleeps around with random guys to get back at him.. One who is 2 tequila shots away from letting Howard wear her like a hat), swelling up in a severe allergic reaction.

After several hours at the hospital, Howard and Leonard arrive back at the apartment to find the party has ended, though Penny does kiss Leonard at the end of the night. Title reference: Howard's serious peanut allergy."

She even throws his iPod out of the window and it smashes to pieces. The smashed iPod is later picked up by Raj who plans to sell it on eBay marked as ""slightly used"".. Howard immediately gets searching for it on the internet, but cannot find it even after spending a lot of effort on it Sheldon, determined to prove that the Chinese restaurant uses oranges instead of tangerines in their ""Tangerine chicken"", asks Howard to teach him Mandarin. The learning doesn't go too well and Sheldon keeps testing his knowledge with Chinese origin folks at the university, by making inappropriate comments (in Mandarin that he doesn't understand) and making them uncomfortable

Leonard goes to comfort Penny, who makes him read Mike's blog. When Penny laments her choice of men (either she chooses losers or she chooses good men and then turns them into losers), Leonard kind of argues into a position (Leonard says that the blog is actually not that bad and portrays Penny as a warm and affectionate woman) where Penny realizes that she never gave Mike a chance to explain what he did (maybe that blog was his way of showing his love for her) and goes after him as she also feels that she over-reacted. Leonard is again devastated as this was not the outcome he was hoping for.

Penny comes back and yells at Leonard since Mike was already having sex with someone else. Raj is astonished that Leonard managed to screw-up the screw-up. Leonard consoles her & Penny says that she is done with the ""typical"" guys that she usually goes with, and wants to date the ""nice"" guys for a change. Seeing this as an opening, Leonard awkwardly asks her out. Penny takes a moment and agrees to go out for dinner with Leonard.

After a few days, both worry that this relationship could ruin their friendship, and each seeks Sheldon's advice. For Penny, Leonard is not the type of guy she usually goes out with. Sheldon uses the ""Schrödinger's cat"" thought experiment (A cat in a box with a vial of poison, that can break open at any time. Till the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead the same time) to explain that the date has both ""good"" and ""bad"" possible outcomes, and the only way to determine which outcome is to go on the date.

When Leonard arrives to pick up Penny, he mentions the thought experiment and kisses her passionately. She concludes that ""the cat is alive"" and they leave for dinner. Leonard and Penny go to the Chinese restaurant, but they leave before entering on seeing Sheldon arguing with the owner in Mandarin, and doing it very badly (The Sheldon says random things in Mandarin which convey no meaning and the owner thinks Sheldon is crazy), disturbing the patrons.

Title reference: The Chinese Tangerine chicken which Sheldon believed was actually prepared with oranges."

Casey takes a change from previous years, coaching only Omega Chi, and takes on the Lambda Sigs. Casey doesnt have to worry about much, as the Lambda Sigs are the most athletic frat on campus. Casey soon develops a crush on one of the Lambda guys, Shane, and by the way he looks at her, he seems to have a crush on her too. Evan notices the attention she is getting from Shane and doesnt like it. Frannie, the Omega coach, gives Evan some advice telling him he shouldnt quit yet.

Rebecca has her hands more than full over at Kappa Tau. With her bossy nature, she is trying to whip the boys into shape.

Shane in the end, ended up with the Big Cat on Campus prize. Casey was elated, Evan was worried, and Rebecca was pissed.

He doesnt understand why all she wants is sex.

Rusty meets up with his brothers and tries to figure out what kind of relationship hes in with Tina. Girlfriend, or friends with benefits? Cappie explains to Rusty that hes in a friend with benefits relationship and that he should be happy about it.

Cappie sees Evan outside the liquor stores and finds out that he is having a six way party with all the Greek houses on campus. Every house was invited but Kappa Tau. Cappie decides that he needs to have his own party despite lack of money, beer, and time.

Rusty goes to the ZBZ house looking for his sister for more advice. Rusty tells his sister that he needs to talk about sex. With the situation being too awkward, Casey recruits Ashley to help her out, and to talk to Rusty. But, the advice wasnt enough for Rusty. He talked to Beaver afterward, and he told him just to ignoring her for a few days, and she would just go away.

Back at the ZBZ house, Rebecca, and a few pledges want to attend the Kappa Tau party instead of the Omega Chi party. Even though they were formally asked to attend. Casey decided that instead of banning the girls from going to the KT party. That giving them the job of sober sisters for the event would keep them in line.

At Omega Chi, the party is in full swing. Evan notices many guys giving Casey attention. Evan asks his brother Calvin to look after Casey and make sure she doesnt get too close to any other guys, keeping the field open for him. Calvin has invited Michael to the party at his frat house. Michael does not seem impressed, and also very uncomfortable telling Calvin he had nothing in common with frat guys.

Ashley has already gotten several phone numbers and Casey with none, thanks to Evan and Calvin. Finally the guy Casey had been eyeing all night had come up to her, and started talking. Casey found out that the universe had finally answered her call knowing now that the guy she though was taken was now available.

Rebecca decides that shes not going to wait for permission to go to the Kappa Tau party. Instead, she puts on party clothes, and phones the other pledges to meet her.

Tina is still bombarding Rusty with phone calls and messages. The Kappa Tau party is dead and Cappie has come up with an idea to steal the party from the Omega Chi, along with the alcohol.

Casey is starting to get suspicious with Calvins behavior and wants to know whats going on. Calvin gives her a lane excuse, and walks away quickly. While on the way out, Calvin tells Evan that hes done with chasing after Casey. Evan then approaches Casey and asks her when things calm down if they could have a dance as friends. Casey accepts.

Behind the scenes Cappie and his brothers are in the Omega Chi house, stealing all the liquor they can.

Calvin finally catches up with his date and it is apparent that he wants to get out of there. Calvin is left standing there, while his date goes to get another drink.

Cappie, corners Casey at the Omega Chi party, and asks her why no Zeta Betas had shown up. Casey explains to Cappie, the reason none of them went is because they had already gotten an invitation from Omega Chi and that, the Kappa Tau had thrown theirs together at the last second. Cappie reminds Casey about the Great Gatsby party and how much the Kappa Taus helped. Casey explains that the ZBZs and the Omegas had made up, and that maybe in three weeks the KT and the ZBZ would have an outing together. Cappie then runs off, without saying goodbye for fear of getting caught by Evan, who is not so far away. Rusty is still in line for the bathroom, and lets a pretty girl cut in front of him. She also gives him some advice on how to dump Tina.

When Cappie gets back to the KT house, his arms are full of liquor, and Rebecca is waiting for him.

Evan sees Casey and her new male friend talking and holding hands. It seems like Evan has finally given up, and goes to find himself a drink.

Calvin goes to find his date, and they finally confront each other about what is really going on. Calvin thought the reason Michael was so uncomfortable was because he thought his brothers where homophobic, but really he was only uneasy because Michael felt so much older than everyone else. Calvin and Michael made up with a kiss.

Evan is sitting on the coach when Frannie sits down beside him. Evan spills about his feelings for Casey, and even tells Frannie, about his past attempts to keep guys away from Casey, so that he could make his move. Frannie tells Evan that instead of chasing after Casey he should find a girl to chase after him.

Casey finds out the Rebecca is not on duty, and that she will have to leave the party to deal with one of the girls, who has gotten way too drunk. Casey has to leave her new love interest but tell him shell be back soon.

Back at Rustys dorm, Rusty starts writing an email to break it off with Tina. Although he cant quite find the right words, and decides to scraps the idea.

Casey goes over to the KT house, to get Rebecca to do her job as a pledge. Although Rebecca refuses to, Casey tries to get Cappies help, but he opted out of getting in between Casey and Rebeccas fight. Casey ended up having to take her drunken sister back the ZBZ house. On her walk back, Ryan the boy she had met at the Omega house had found her. Casey apologized for everything that happened that night, but Ryan said, it was okay and that he had a great time anyways. They then both leaned in and kissed except he kissed a little too much, with his mouth fully open leaving Casey with slobber all over her face.

Back at KT the party is going fierce. Rusty has finally broken up with Tina via text message with his frat brothers help. Tina then messaged Rusty back, letting him know that she was fine but that she had Crabs."

Inside there are halls empty and dark. Eventually there is a large room containing a stargate. The gate begins to come alive and eventually a wormhole forms lighting up the room with its light. A military man carrying a gun comes tumbling quickly through the gate. He quickly recovers and scans the room for danger. Then someone else comes tumbling through the gate. He runs over to check on them an is almost hit by a suitcase which comes flying through the gate. More and more people and luggage begin to come through the gate at a breakneck pace, energetically tumbling most of them go sprawling. The man uses his radio ""This is Lt Scott, slow down the evac, we are coming in too hot!"" A woman grabs Lt Scott and demands to know where they are and why they haven't come through to Earth. Someone calls for a medic, but she's already at work treating someone. A thin man in civilian clothes ascends a staircase and calmly watches the chaos from above. Finally, after the flow of bodies has slowed down a last man comes hurtling through the gate, literally flying through the air. He crashes hard on the deck and Lt Scott and medic, TJ, go to check on him. As the injured man, Colonel Young, passes out he tells Scott ""You're in charge"".

We flash back to see Eli Wallace, a young slacker, bragging to his friend about how he is going to solve the Dakarran weapons puzzle in an MMORPG called Prometheus. However, when Eli inputs his solution to the puzzle the game simply reboots. Disappointed, Eli is visited the next day by Colonel Jack O'Neill and Dr Nicholas Rush who congratulate him on solving the puzzle and attempt to recruit him. Believing this to a be a joke, Eli refuses and shuts the door in their faces. He is then beamed aboard the space ship General Hammond, which is orbit above Earth preparing to head to the planet Icarus. Rush explains that they had put the Dakaran weapons puzzle in the game as a test to try and recruit people. Rush is the head of a project trying to dial the ""ninth chevron"" on the Stargate and promises that if Eli joins them that the government will take care of Eli's mother's medical bills. On the trip to Icarus, Eli watches a video which informs him of the history of the Stargate and befriends Chloe Armstrong, an aide to the Senator from California who is traveling to Icarus for oversight reasons.

Returning to the space ship we see the various casualties being treated as well as the desire of everyone but Rush to return home. While unconscious, Young has a memory of his leaving for the assignment, something which puts strain on his marriage. He has a seizure.

In flashback we see the General Hammond arriving at Icarus. Colonel Young calls Lt Scott to escort the arriving dignitaries and Scott breaks off a sexual encounter with a fellow airman to comply. Rush reveals that Eli's solution to the Dakaran weapons puzzle will allow them to finally dial the ninth chevron. However, when the solution is tried it fails to work for an unknown reason.

On the ship, Scott tries to organize the survivors and reveals to them that the life support systems on the ship are failing making the air become more toxic.

On Icarus, Rush puzzles over why the solution failed to dial the gate. During a dinner to welcome Senator Armstrong, the base comes under attack from the Lucian Alliance.

On Destiny, Rush has a showdown with Eli and Marine Masterseargant Ronald Greer over Rush's attempt to turn on the live support system. We see TJ tending to Colonel Young and she has a flashback to Icarus where she revealed her intention to leave the service.

On Icarus, during the attack, things are becoming critical, the attack has made it so the planet is about to explode. However, Rush still wants to try dialing the ninth chevron since this may be their last chance. After a suggestion from Eli he manages to dial the ninth chevron address rather than the planned evacuation to Earth. Rush informs Young of his decision and justifies it by saying that if the planet explodes while the wormhole is connected any blast energy could be transferred to Earth. They attempt to shut down the gate but cannot. Angry, but with no other options, Young orders the evacuation to the ninth Chevron address, telling everyone to take as much of the expedition equipment as they can.

On the ship, they turn on the computer systems. Doing so they discover that the ship is called Destiny and also discover a map showing that it has traversed dozens of galaxies over millions of years and that they are ""several billion light years from home"".

On Icarus, the people evacuate, carrying expedition equipment with them. Young is the last one through, an explosion sending him flying through the gate.

On Earth, Colonel Carter, who had been directing the space defense of Icarus, learns that the evacuees did not arrive on Earth and wonders where they are."

Scott and Eli Wallace who have solid alibis. Eli and Lt. Scott begin to search all of the rooms while the rest of the ship's group stay in the gate room. Rush communicates with Col Young and it is realized that Rush is not in the gate room with everyone else. Lt. Scott and Eli then find the gun used to kill Spencer and find it in an air vent in Col.

They report the situation to earth and Wray is put in charge by the IOA to conduct an investigation and hearing. Col. Young asks Chloe Armstrong to defend him in the questioning.

As tensions escalate, Lt. Scott continues to pressure Eli to search for any leads or information that may have been recorded on the kinos Eli has roaming around the ship. Many of the crew feel no loss as a result of Spencer's death and some consider it a good act of leadership by Col. Young but Young continues to refuse to pull rank and stop the investigation. Wray assumes command and gives Rush permission to run the science team as he sees fit. Rush immediately brings the scientists into the room where he found the interface chair in the prior episode and gives them a speech about how it is vital that they find a way to interact with the chair since it may be their only chance to return home. Eventually, one of the scientists on duty convinces Eli to go get some food and while alone, attempts to sit in the chair (or Rush may have forced him, it is unclear). The chair inserts needles into his head and he is removed from the chair in a very serious medical condition. It is not known if he will survive or whether he gained any knowledge.

When Young attempts to communicate with home, using the ancient stones, he finds himself aboard an alien space ship. This is the first encounter with the blue-grey aliens (CGI).

In space, Destiny encounters hostile aliens, who communicate one word in English, ""Surrender,"" after Eli Wallace (David Blue) sends a greeting in Ancient language. Aliens attack and the first space battle ensues between spaceships. Destiny sends the shuttle, piloted by Lt. Scott (Brian J. Smith). One of the alien crafts attaches itself to Destiny and drills through the hull. Chloe Armstrong (Elyse Levesque) investigates the sound and is abducted.

Young deduces his aliens-of-the-stones and the hostile attacks are the same aliens. He uses the stones again to gain intel on their ship.

The episode begins with an escalating fight between a male crew member and female crew member Lt. Vanessa James (Julia Benson). She throws a lantern and kills him with that blow to the head. The scene ends with his head lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood.

Later, Dr. Volker (Patrick Gilmore) is wandering the corridors. Background music is similar to Atmospheres from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). He appears to be confused. When asked by a guard if he is all right, and if he is tired, he replies that he is tired.

The guard, Scott (Brian J. Smith) sees a boy and calls out the name ""Matthew"" and ""give chase.""

Dr. Rush (Robert Carlyle) enters a room and has a heated discussion with Col. Young (Louis Ferreira) and Camile (Ming-Na Wen). (I could not hear the English soundtrack, only the Russian.)

An alert sounded and there was fight in a large common area. Several members of the Destiny crew were present, and one man appeared to be fighting an imaginary enemy and had bloody lacerations on his forearm. The boy, Matthew, reappeared, and Scott gave chase.

Both Rush and Eli (David Blue) in separate scenes appeared unable to explain the events.

Scott caught up to Matthew. Matthew asked ""Why did you leave me?""

Scott is called to sick bay. Lt. James is shocked to see him - he is the man she thought she had killed in her quarters.

Tamara Johansen (Alaina Huffman) finds something the size of a mole on the back of Scott's head. Dr. Volker is in restraints and required an injection to sedate him.

Scott sees Matthew in sick bay. Tamara starts to remove the ""mole"" from his head and he becomes unconscious and requires CPR. The mole appeared to have burrowed deeper into Scott's head. (I could not understand what Tamara said.)

Jumping ahead in the episode, Eli and Volker speak of the part of the brain that controls fear and anger, and others present all have had fearful or angry hallucinations.

Sgt. Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) appears to believe that civilians are trying to take over the ship, and wounds and takes Camile hostage. Rush leads a rescue party, and then attacks them as they subdue Greer and rescue Camile. Rush in turn is subdued.

Caine says we got the whole story right here; meaning the crash site. Calleigh Duquesne asks Horatio ""Is it is as bad as it looks"", and his reply, ""It is actually worse than it looks"", while Delko is paddling a boat through the water collecting body parts, putting the evidence in plastic bags. On firmer ground nearby, Megan Donner and Tim Speedle are talking about the site being a level two biohazard site, as Tim welcomes Megan back, but she is all business, brushing off Tim's kind greeting. She asks Horatio a question, he responds the jury is still out, welcoming her back on the job. There is tension between the two, Horatio mentioning he is sorry she did not get this job, saying let us get to work processing the evidence as the Everglades is continually moving, the scene is degrading in front of them. Coroner Alexx Woods is in the tented on-site lab examining a victim with an apparent bullet wound completely through his upper torso. Munitions expert Calleigh identifies the caliber as medium sized. Detective Delacroix interviews one of the fishermen, he claiming they left the scene and called 911. Megan says Tim sounds just like Horatio when he says he trusts his gut claiming the fishermen were likely poaching gators based on the size of the rifle in their boat. Tim is pulling in evidence floating on the water, open pilot billfold, an empty briefcase later opened by Horatio. Delko calls out he got a live victim and Horatio says don't let him go into shock. There was currency scattered in the water near the other floating evidence.

The EM crew carrying the surviving man on a stretcher is momentarily stopped by Horatio, noting there was no friction burns on the body meaning no seat belt worn. He could possibly be the shooter, prompting Horatio to ask, ""Why would you shoot your own pilot."" Megan interrupts, a body was sighted floating miles away and it is the senior accountant to the surviving company owner. Alexx exams her in the actual lab, no seat belt marks, high-blood-alcohol level, Prozac level present. The accountant was under the influence, there are unknown marks on her hand Horatio discovered while she was on the exam table; observed by Alexx close-up, with Megan present. Horatio shows the accountant's mother a picture of the briefcase, she identifies it as her daughter's, given to her as a gift upon receiving her promotion. Horatio knows the company was being investigated by the SEC, the plane was on its way to Washington D.C. to be grilled. Calleigh gets confirmation from a NTSB agent the plane exit door pins were filed down, the plane door opened in flight, as the unit went down just after takeoff. The only woman on board ended up miles from the crash because she left the plane via the exit door. Horatio says let's find out who worked on that plane. Senor Esparza worked on the plane, admitting plane repairs were with old parts, not admitting any guilt, for at 35,000 feet nobody cared about the origin of the parts. Calleigh said the airport said it reached 4,000 feet before it began its descent. Megan interrupts, saying the owner is out of a coma, able to speak.

The company owner, Scott Sommer, is being questioned by Megan and Horatio, and they want his fingerprints and a DNA sample, in order to determine what happened, his accountant fell out the exit door, which was opened from the inside. Sommer claims Christina was acting strangely, drinking and chasing the booze with pills, when she opened the door and jumped out. Sommer says he didn't hear any gun shot, as Horatio takes his prints and swabs for DNA. Megan is examining Christina lying in cold storage, grabbing hair from her head, looking at the results under a microscope, determining Christina had been using antidepressants for the past year, Prozac and Zoloft. Megan believes Christina committed suicide based on her behavior from the drugs she was taking over the last year. Horatio states whistle blowers are usually female and believes she was likely pushed off the plane after giving up Sommer. Working in the lab, Speedle and Delko disagree over Megan's behavior upon her return after her husband died. Speaking into the same lab, Horatio wants the black boxes found and Tim thinks he knows where to look. Through collaboration of fingerprint tests on the exit door, Megan and Horatio determine Christina was hanging on to the door; Sommer pushed her out. Both go to Sommer's hospital room where they learn from a nurse he checked himself out earlier.

Search warrant in hand, Speedle and Delko visit the fishermen's home where they find the black boxes among baby alligators, securing same, they return to the lab. All are listening to the recordings, the audio reveals the exit door is open, the plane is losing altitude, with no gun shots audible. Horatio has the tape slowed, determining Christina held on for 17 seconds before Sommer pushed her out. Tim searches Christina's apartment determining no evidence of suicide; she had plans to return in 24 hours, filling her prescriptions before she left, and other signs she planned on returning the next day. Alexx looked at the pilot's body, and found the pilot died from a rivet coming through the windshield killing him instantly, validated by Caleigh measuring rivet size in the mark left in the cockpit wall. Eric's focus on the number two engine revealed fabric in the turbine; Christina's shoe caught in the engine, failing the unit and bringing the plane down. Horatio has no evidence to pin Christina's death on Sommer, but remembering the marks on her hand, a re-creation of the fuselage, and locating the missing fire-extinguisher, lead to the proof in the 17 seconds Christina held on for her life. Sommer freed her hand by hitting with the extinguisher, leaving the marks on her hand, and for her to fall to her death. Conclusion is Sommer killed Christina. Detective Delacroix tells Lieutenant Caine we found Sommer; he is shown hanging from his own rope, dead by strangulation; obvious suicide. Horatio is showing Christina's mother the overnight carrier correspondence her daughter sent to the SEC implicating Sommer and a note claiming her decision to blow the whistle of the fraud."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0534816/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"A Colombian importer is found with a 'necklace bomb' around his neck. The bomb explodes, killing a bomb squad officer, Al, who is Horatio's friend.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Joe Chappelle'],"['', '', '']",[],"['murder of mentor', 'wedding ring', 'double life', 'bike', 'serial bomber', 'revenge murder', 'bomb', 'bomb squad', 'two word episode title', 'widow', 'death of mentor', 'double murder', 'reference to stevie wonder', 'murder of husband', 'death of husband', 'child in jeopardy']",[],"The neck-bomb explosion knocked out the picture window causing a cut drawing blood to Horatio standing away in the street. That was his friend and past trainer, Al, killed trying to disarm the bomb.

Alexx examines the neck-bomb man with Megan watching. There is nothing left of the man's face and his insides are soup from the blast. Chloroform was on the man before the blast, getting him to be still to attach the bomb. All hands on deck for the processing, but the action switch to the bomb is missing. The switch was carried from the house on a fireman's boot when they exited the house. The goal is to get it back from the boot that it stuck. Inspection of one boot had a photocell fragment in the tread; Horatio tells Speed that is what killed Al. Delko delivers analysis of the note paper made from sugar cane fiber, imported primarily from Columbia. There is a paper backlog, no store has any inventory, the distributor shipment is awaiting inspection on the docks by U.S. Customs.

Delko inspects the paper shipment, meeting Charlie Berenger, customs. Charlie tells Delko Aurelio Moreno was also married to another woman, Lauriana, and the wife Delko met was Julisa. Horatio explains how bombs are made. The photocell contained in the bomb was set off by the light entering the casing when Al drilled.

Aurelio had a wife in Bogota until recently, when she came to Miami. Horatio interviews a wife and Megan interviews the other wife. Both say their husband travelled a lot, but both say he was dedicated to his family. A swab is taken of both their hands, which Horatio processes. His findings he shares with Megan, the American wife has clean record, the Columbian wife had traces of chemicals indicating she was the bomber according to Horatio, but Megan asks him how many bombers in his experience were ever women? Horatio says this is his first. Megan notes Lauriana's hair, nails, makeup and hair dye contain the same chemicals prevalent in the bomb residue. Megan also saw both women get on the elevator together, neither woman batting an eye, they likely do not know the other exists. Horatio takes a call with Megan standing there, he says we got another bomb.

Horatio meets up with former colleague, Katrina Cabrera, who is disarming the new bomb on Moira Burgess. This time the tech, Katrina, and the victim, Moira, are surrounded by covers to prevent any light from entering the casing. Katrina is consoling Moira as she drills into the casing. Horatio is talking Katrina through the process as he watches from a remote device inside a vehicle. The drilling caused the casing to separate, sand came out of the casing, after precautionary measures taken, Horatio declared all clear. They exited the home, as Horatio notices a boy, his bicycle has a package in its basket.

The brown wrapping paper package was given to Connor along with the bike simply for delivering it. Connor realizes his mistake as Horatio has the remote bomb detonator come to the bike and package. Connor goes to Katrina and Megan. Horatio had brought over to the sight a device looking like a metal suitcase to jam all signals in the vicinity, preventing the bomb from detonating.

The robot gets yards away from the package, watched by Katrina and Horatio. The bomb is disarmed by the robot and Bill, the robot bomb-tech operator. Katrina retrieves the expelled device. Megan combs Connor's hair for any trace from the man handing him the package. It is agreed the man had wavy brown hair, lighter in color than Connor's. Megan asks Horatio if the bomber is after the girl, why plant the hoax in her house? Horatio states, calculate the distant from the house and the street sign. He says five hundred feet and that is where the bomb squad would set up containment and their command post. The victim is a decoy, he is after the bomb squad.

Horatio tells the staff the first bomb was to kill the victim and the bomb tech, the second was a decoy to lure them in and the third was to blow everyone to smithereens. Everyone has something to process as the remnants are all laid out on the table with a grid describing the items. Horatio is going to look for the signature, every bomb maker has one. They have a meeting looking at the common items. Concluding the bomber wears a wig, there was a foreign banned-insecticide, counterfeit parts, Aurelio Moreno and Moira Burgess were from Columbia, both importing from there. Horatio declares all evidence goes through U.S. Customs, so let's go back to that impound warehouse.

At the warehouse they meet Detective Martin Puig, filling them in with detail pointing to Charlie Berenger, customs. Horatio is aware Charlie could set off another bomb, yet he takes the risk entering the warehouse. He meets Charlie. Charlie was dismissed by Al, therefore, Charlie sought revenge. Charlie is wearing an apparent neck bomb, Horatio takes the toothpick from Charlie's mouth, inserts it in the bomb casing hole, diffusing whatever kind it was Charlie had wrapped around his neck. Detective Puig arrests him. An officer cuffs him and Horatio says ""Get him out of my sight.""

Explaining to Megan his actions earlier, Horatio said he just got hung up on the wives, Horatio pays a verbal tribute to Al, saying most people make you earn their respect, with Al, that's where you started. He thanks Megan for knowing the difference. He greets Al's wife at their door for the funeral."

The boat captain, Rick, releases the shark with the torso, along with an area sea chart. Rick gets a free pass from Horatio on the illegal GPS system he has on board his boat. The shark is bagged for Alexx to process in the lab. Location of the catch is shown on the chart Horatio confiscated.

Alexx starts processing. The torso tattoo signifies a Cuban freedom fighter flag, meaning the male was likely fleeing his country; the tat means the victim was a political prisoner. The torso also had a .45-caliber bullet in it. Blood sample sent to Megan, bullet sent to Calleigh.

The Coast Guard has the boat Delko and Speed are looking for and the tire tracks leading from where boat is docked has a rear bald tire. Initial processing of the boat provides 'artifacts and abandonment', an empty breathalyzer, an illegible note posted at the helm, and an imbedded bullet. Speed picks out the bullet for Calleigh and Delko swabs a sample of blood for Megan.

Calleigh looks at both bullets, torso and boat, both match, same gun. Megan adds, torso bullet blood type male, the boat bullet type female. Horatio affirms 'we have another victim out there ladies.'

Horatio, Delko and Speed are processing evidence on the confiscated boat; the boat name, Luna Nueva, means new moon. Speed photographs the erased registration and exits. There is a cargo hold built into the boat. Horatio says the hold could store five-hundred kilograms, Delko secures a sample and Horatio's immediate examination reveals cocaine. In the lab, Speed and Calleigh are viewing the lifted registration number. Megan says the boat is registered to a Captain Bob. Megan talked to the marina manager, and gets nowhere finding Bob. Speed is handed dockage video tapes to see when Bob shows at his boat.

Horatio is watching Alexx take pictures of a dead female, shot at close range, tourniquet applied, in a Russian raft, wearing a Cuban medal wishing safe voyage. The tourniquet-rope used to slow the bleeding is analyzed by Megan, giving DNA-proof to familial ties. Megan and Horatio lament the sadness of the female victim not making it to U.S. shore. Horatio speaks about the term wet foot/dry foot referring to the status given to a Cuban immigrant touching U.S. soil, one foot on shore, the other in the water. Once they touch U.S. shore, a green card is granted. Horatio to Megan, ready to play politics?

Horatio visits with his Cuban contact, Basillio, allowing CSI to meet relatives of the dead woman. The woman, named Elena, was the niece of the interviewed couple, Megan consoles her, as she clutches the medal, finally, Megan takes the medal back, Horatio and Megan leave, reaching a dead end with no more cooperation from the anyone else. Horatio did notice a young man in the house as they were leaving, but Basillio wouldn't allow the meeting.

Alexx believes the empty sinus-atomizer belonged to the victim, who took too heavy a dose, not making the survival from the bleeding leg easier. The bullet was near the femoral artery and the woman bled out. The gunshot from the torso had fibers contained in Elena's gunshot wound.

Megan lifts DNA from the rope, giving rise to familial connections of the person tying it, i.e. brother, like the young man in the back bedroom. Calleigh concludes a match of the Colt's bullets can be tied to the John Doe torso, the boat imbedded bullet and the one in Elena's leg. Elena was a triplet, prompting Delko to comment there must have been some massacre on that boat.

Speed is watching the tapes, Delko observes, the guy in the truck has been sitting there for over six hours. Horatio asks Speed to zoom the back tires, inquiring if they look bald. Speed agrees. Horatio says gentlemen, let's find that truck.

Horatio looks at analysis of bullets linking the events, guy(torso) shot first, Elena(raft) shot second knowing close relatives travel together, this links the boy they saw at the house. Megan states the DNA match makes him a material witness; Horatio adds that is a warrant we can get.

Horatio quips this is the only place in the nation where negotiation is necessary before the warrant is served. Detective Avilla does the negotiation serving the warrant on the same house for the victim's brother, Pedro. Megan and Horatio process his bedroom, Horatio finds a Colt .45 in the vacuum cleaner bag in Pedro's room. Pedro is cuffed and lead out.

Speed is in the truck processing as Horatio is heard telling a superior, the truck and the boat captain have been taken into custody. Speed and Horatio see trace evidence from the unloading the boat into the truck. Calleigh is firing the confiscated Colt from Pedro's room. That is an affirmative on the Colt, it is the source for all three bullets recovered. Horatio, you shoot your sister and then you try to save her life. Speedle is unmasking the note Delko found on the boat, it read NM 28-30. The code needs to be cracked.

Megan and Horatio are at the boat site, Horatio listening to her account of the trip from Cuba. Why start shooting? She asks rhetorically. We collected, catalogued all the personal property on the boat. Evidence there were twelve people on board, maybe more. The weight of the cargo, one-thousand pounds of coke in the right hull with an estimated eighteen hundred pounds of people, taking of water from the rough seas, that would panic the Captain. The boat's center of gravity was way off. Horatio says save the drugs or save the people? He asks Megan, Would you jump? She says yes if he had a gun to my head. Horatio retorts let's go put one to his.

Captain Bob is taken in for questioning where says he had to ditch his boat due to a storm. Megan says they have his boat. Horatio states they have his gun and his truck. Megan informs Bob they matched his gun to two dead bodies, there is evidence of pure cocaine in your boat and in your confiscated rental truck. Bob demands a lawyer after Horatio claims the drugs, the immigrants were not counting on the storm, so he began shooting them as he told the people to abandon ship.

Horatio says Pedro has the Cuban Johnny Cochran as his attorney, courtesy of Basillio. Horatio is questioning Pedro, playing on his feelings for his late sister. Horatio tells Pedro I know you tried to save your sister's life. Horatio said she died before reaching shore. He confesses what he did to try and save her, since he could swim to shore, Elena could not, due to her asthma. The Coast Guard boat was in sight, but never close enough. He did what he did to save her because the law requires medical attention be given to the victim. The Coast Guard would have secured doctors for her wound and kept her here. Learning at the close, the authorities never found her.

Horatio and Megan are talking outside CSI headquarters. Citizenship is granted to Pedro for testimony; heavy-heart cooperation from Pedro and the code NM 28-30, is the dates of the new moon; travel with all cargo in darkness."

Detective Fenwick fills Megan and Horatio with the details he has encountered. Fenwick says a jogger called in the incident at 6:15 AM on the two victims. A woman beaten half-unconscious, nearly drowned, was transported to St. Luke's hospital and the dead man was beaten, throat slashed, noticeably his footprints show he was running away.

Horatio states, the evidence, as always, will speak for itself.

Alexx does a preliminary exam at the beach: liver temperature indicates he died around midnight, his jugular was severed, and he experienced blunt force trauma to the head. He was cut by an irregular object and bled out and there was a burn mark on his cheek.

Megan gets a call from the SART nurse letting her know the sexual assault rescue team had completed their work. The woman now can be interviewed. As Megan departs, Delko and Speed are sifting through the sand in the area. Delko tells Calleigh, as the paramedics come through, they trample the sand, so it is worthy of a deeper search. Speed finds a green-glass fragment from the deep sand.

The SART nurse briefs Megan, saying Jane does not remember the last twelve hours. Megan consoles Jane Renshaw, female assault victim, from her hospital bed, Jane not remembering the prior evening's events. Megan asks for and gets permission to take her retainer for analysis, there is foreign matter attached to the retainer, seen by Megan as she holds it, further consoling Jane. Jane had asked about her boyfriend, Paul Varnette.

Lab processing begins. Delko swabs a nose piece from a pair of eyeglasses, picking up a trace of blood, Calleigh watches, and offers to bring it to trace for DNA testing. Horatio watches as Alexx identifies green glass from the male victim's cheek, speculating he was a bartender, based on the red rash caused by handling citrus fruits; he is also not the boyfriend described by Jane, due to hair color samples; female victim stated her boyfriend was a CPA.

Horatio and Det. Fenwick enter Jane's hotel room, where Paul Varnette is just getting in, Horatio tells him his girlfriend lies in the hospital, the guy she was with is dead. Horatio and Det. Fenwick question Paul last seeing Jane around 11 PM while Megan processes the hotel room. Paul claims consensual sex early in the day with Jane, commenting the sex was kind of rough, if you find anything. Megan takes a saliva sample, Horatio learns Paul went to school with Tyler Hamilton, as his illegal cigar is confiscated.

As the CSI team enters the Hamilton gates, Horatio confirms Calleigh got a nose-piece testing for blood today. She said it was sent to trace. They meet Drake Hamilton asking to speak with his nephew Tyler. Tyler denies all knowledge of everything, while his uncle stands nearby, Drake denying a search of the beach house without a warrant. Calleigh notices the Champaign bottle on a table, Drake says it is most common in the area residences and liquor store.

Speed has re-assembled part of a Champaign bottle, testing for prints. Paul Varnette's prints were on the bottle, the bottle was the murder weapon because Speedle discovered the float density of the particles were the same as the pieces from the victim's neck. Megan claims analysis reveals part of a penis was torn, evidence on Jane's retainer. Megan tells Speed she has to further analyze the sample to see if it was from Paul. Horatio tests a sample of Paul's illegal cigar. The burn mark on the victim was from a cigar, same as Paul's. Megan analyzes penile tissue, not Paul's. Horatio notes to Megan, while near the room with Paul, the sample cigar he analyzed were similar to the burn on the victim. Megan said she ran the penile sample, it is not a match to Paul. Paul's prints are on the murder weapon, somebody else sexually assaulted his girlfriend.

Megan and Horatio show Paul pictures of the deceased while asking questions. The watch Paul bought at the airport for fifty dollars is not on him, but a thirteen thousand dollar watch is. Ryan Cutler, an attorney for the Hamilton's, walks in on the interrogation, claiming to represent Paul, as a courtesy from the family. Horatio says this is not your attorney, and the Hamilton's will hang you out to dry if you in two seconds. Paul claims the watch was a gift from Tyler Hamilton. He asked to kiss Jane once, giving Paul his expensive watch for the favor. Paul this man is not your attorney, you did not hire him, cooperate with us. At a reception Tyler kissed Jane giving his gold watch to Paul in exchange. Jane walked away mad, Paul grabbed a bottle of champagne, and said to Jane let's go. Jane grabbed the bottle from Paul and departed. She walked off, he says he figured she went down to the beach. He says he stayed and got drunk, not following her to the beach. Horatio says to Paul, if you want me to buy your story I need to take a look at that watch. Horatio talks Paul into giving him his watch for analysis; Paul leaves with the attorney.

Megan examines the watch, finding three sets of male DNA. Horatio requests separate Paul's DNA and cross-reference Jane's retainer with the remaining two DNA sets.

Horatio confronts Drake Hamilton, asks for a DNA sample, Drake asks for a warrant, Horatio says this is the way to clear yourself. Horatio reviews the history of another meeting some fifteen years ago. Horatio shows Drake a picture of the watch, Drake identifies it as the watch he gave to his nephew Tyler. Horatio tells Drake skins cells on the watch are from a male who forced Jane to have oral sex and the other cells are from a close relative, which one are you? Horatio then talks to Tyler, Drake present. Then asks for evidence from nephew Tyler Hamilton. Tyler says it was consenting sex with Jane. Horatio wants to see Tyler's clothes from that night. They are in the guest house if his uncle says it is okay. Drake tells Horatio Tyler admitted to sex with her, let it go; the press will eat her alive, meaning Jane, if you pursue this. Horatio says to Drake you are protecting a woman. Horatio leaves, meeting Calleigh in the driveway.

Calleigh obtains a city property map. She and Horatio agree the boardwalk dock leading away from the Hamilton property line, near the beach house, is public, where they begin to collect blood samples. Lab work from Megan says the blood found is that of bartender Estevan Ordonez. Horatio gets a warrant based on the murdered Estevan.

Horatio serves the warrant to Drake while simultaneously seeing the beach house demolished, hampering the processing, but the warrant got swabs for DNA from both Hamiltons. Horatio finds a spent cigar in the rubble and heads to the lab. Calleigh finds a zipper from a man's warm-up jacket, collects it for processing, it is identical to the jacket Tyler was wearing in the pictures taken at the party. Analysis of the zipper contains glass particles, Speed says the glass particles have the same density level. Horatio reflects on the behavior on party night where Tyler clobbers the guy with the champagne bottle, raining the glass down on his jacket; Megan adds the spent cigar taken out of the beach house rubble has Tyler's DNA, same as burnt into the victim's cheek, with silica mixed, a/k/a beach sand.

Tyler is brought in for interrogation, Horatio is reflecting on the bartender seen with Jane, the old Hamilton arrogance turns into rage, beating Estevan with the champagne bottle, smashing his face into the lifeguard stand, having what he calls consensual sex, and letting the girl to die in the water. Going the extra yard, Horatio adds, you burn the man's face with your cigar. The cigar was extinguished in the sand and taken, to be disposed in the beach house fireplace; found later by Horatio.

Tyler is confronted with the evidence. Calleigh interrupts the questioning, informing Horatio the nose piece found had Estevan's blood on it; DNA tests prove it. Tyler does not wear glasses. Megan says the only way you get splatter on a nose piece is to be there when the murder is happening. Horatio adds Drake wears glasses. Drake is brought in, his glasses are analyzed by Horatio, blood is on Drake's glasses. In an attempt to wipe away the blood, Drake is told he merely wiped to the corner of the lens. Slit jugular means Drake was inches away at the time. Horatio hands Drake the picture of the lens evidence and Drake hands it to his attorney. After Drakes speaks, his attorney states you have made a statement against his counsel. What Tyler started, was completed by Drake. Drake ran the broken bottle across the Estevan's throat, killing him. Attorney Cutler tells Drake you are looking at facing murder charges. Horatio adds without parole.

Drake's story he came to the beach site hearing screams, took the broken bottle and finished Estevan. Tyler claimed a murder was committed by Estevan on Jane. Drake finished Estevan, walked away with Tyler, Drake burnt Tyler's clothes in the guest house fireplace.

Both Drake and Tyler are lead away; cuffed.

Paul tries to reconcile with Jane leaving the hotel room. She does not speak to him, walks past, luggage in hand. Megan to Paul, if you loved her, you wouldn't have traded her for a watch.

Megan joins Horatio outside the hotel as he is recounting his first encounter with Drake Hamilton. Walking away from an accident with a young woman passenger, left alone in his vehicle, while he sought refuge with attorneys, appearing for authorities, some four hours later. If a phone call had been made immediately after the accident, the girl's life could have been saved, according to the medical examiner. The victim bled out at the scene. That tragedy occurred some fifteen years ago. Megan says Horatio, you got him now. Horatio repeats, got him now."

He is lying on the rectory floor in a pool of blood, apparently dead.

The CSI team comes in to the rectory, Horatio notices a bullet hole in the wall, Alexx says ""liver temperature is eighty-two, which means he was probably killed between nine and midnight."" Megan asks ""who would want to kill a priest?"" Horatio responds, ""nowadays, any one."" Horatio checks with Megan to handle the scene, he has been called to another, he has to go. Everyone is processing. Calleigh checks the bullet in the wall; a rifle bullet, Speed shows Megan shoe prints, which differ from the priest's bloody footprints, Calleigh notices two glasses on a table, there is a lip print on the glass of water and the other glass contains scotch.

Horatio arrives at the site of the charred vehicle driven off the road. Delko states it was a female driver, bottle of booze in vehicle, reported stolen two weeks ago in Georgia, and no skid marks from brake usage. Delko shows an evidentiary partial-glass label, where Horatio adds, the car thief has expensive taste, that is a $400 bottle of cognac. Speculation from Delko, the gas line ruptured from going over the edge, exploding and starting the fire. Delko found a purse, a suitcase, no ID, some twelve feet from the car. Horatio asks why she travelled this far without an ID.

Speed and Megan are in the sanctuary, Megan tests the holy water basin, it has blood in it, indicating with her instincts they are looking for a devout Catholic; the person wanting to bless themselves after the shooting.

Alexx pulls a bullet from the priest, gives to Calleigh, she identifies the weapon as a hunting rifle, with homemade shot. Alexx shows Megan, with Calleigh's help, a bullet entry at the shoulder, a through-and-through, entering the wall afterward. The other bullet entered in the back, through the heart, ending up in the thigh, Calleigh explain that's why only two casings found at the rectory. Only two shots fired.

Speedle's lab analysis indicates the presumed lip gloss is lip balm, SPF 45, contained macadamia oil. The lip balm is used by kids that skate.

Alexx is processing the charred corpse. There are no broken bones. Horatio mentions the toxicology screen is not back, do not know if alcohol was a factor. There was soot in her lungs, meaning she was alive during the fire. Stomach yields a four-carat diamond ring.

Delko says toxicology came up. There was not a trace of alcohol, but fifteen micrograms of Demerol in system, with high levels of folic acid. Horatio adds enough Demerol to kill herself twice; folic acid content indicated she was pregnant. Delko says seven weeks along.

In the garage with the charred Jeep, Horatio notes the origin of the fire was in the back seat, travelling to the front seat. Delko adds, someone poured cognac over her, but the melted glass in the back seat was not from the cognac. Horatio further notes that someone went out of their way to make certain the victims were never identified.

Horatio, speaking to Alexx, I need something to identify the father. Alexx extracts the fetus from the victim, gives it to Horatio, who brings it to a woman to process it, he looks first under a microscope. This gives him pause, the music playing is somber strings, as he thanks the technician; he exits. There is a simulation of Father Carlos shot twice giving Meagan time to pause, reflecting on the ten seconds he was down from the first bullet, beginning to rise to meet his killer. Calleigh mentions we know the caliper of round was a 223. Megan adds in the time he was down, he lost was about a half-liter of blood, a fact equating to ten seconds.

Speed states the sole prints identify a skateboarder, with wear on one shoe caused by pushing on the ground; we are looking for a teenager, five-two, likely left-handed, because Megan claims boarder is favoring the opposite side from normal foot-position. The altar boys and girls are given lip prints and inspecting their left shoes for wear. That leads to Cameron Medina, a search warrant of his home with help from Det. Sevilla.

The house search yields items such as a Cameron skateboard pic, lip balm, cartridge loader, rifle, power chain, hair samples w/ blood. Iris Medina is questioned about the domestic calls in past, she says she does not know where husband Emilio is, and she doesn't ask. The visible chain marks on her neck indicate domestic abuse. Speed swabs Cameron. Megan asks Cameron why he visited his priest Saturday. Cameron denies being there, claims he was skateboarding, Megan states his shoe and lip prints match those found in the rectory. Pressed, he changes his story, said it was to tell him he didn't want to be an altar boy anymore. He walks from Megan when questioned about priest behavior.

Megan is in the lab reviewing pictures where she informs Calleigh and Speed that Cameron is not our shooter because his story being at the park checks out, the picture dated Saturday, with the park clock saying 10:30 PM, verifies being at the skate park.

Poignancy runs heavy when dealing with an unborn, somber music plays when Horatio is in the lab seeking answers. He tells Delko afterward how it went, ""it was worse, the CODIS search for the father's DNA was negative."" The father's DNA is taken from the fetus and it is hard to search with half a DNA, Delko recounts. Sulfuric acid, sugar, gasoline, potassium chloride made up the fire starter; an exothermic reaction started in the back seat. Horatio looks at Delko's diamond ring slide showing a microscopic inscription labeling the gem, because select clients are reserved these stones, a lesson learned from Horatio catching many diamond thieves. They know the victim's dress was drenched in cognac, the found melted glass was not from the cognac bottle, but from the bottle used to start the fire.

Calleigh alerts Megan that the guns found in the Medina shed do not match the rounds fired that killed Father Carlos; we are still missing a rifle. Calleigh says we know Emilio Medina is violent; let's see if we can find him and ask if he thought the priest was molesting Cameron.

Delko and Horatio question the buyer of the diamond ring, showing him a picture of the ring. The buyer is Jeffrey Douglas, who admits he and Lisa Valdez were in to purchase the diamond in the picture. Horatio says to according to Stewart Diamonds, Jeffrey and Lisa were in eleven weeks ago to purchase this diamond ring. He tells Delko he last saw Lisa about seven or eight weeks ago. Horatio comes back with ""purchasing a rock that large created a problem for you, didn't it?"" Jeffrey claims he gave her the ring for sex one night, but she thought it was more a permanent thing; she swallowed the ring for spite during their quarrel. Horatio asks Jeffrey while showing a picture of Lisa's burnt body, ""does this look like a suicide to you?"" He covers up, turning his head, not commenting.

Emilio's truck is found parked at a refinery. Det. Sevilla speaks with his boss, Mr. Jones, learning Emilio Medina has not been to work in days and he works in the refinery sewer. Calleigh and Megan process the truck. Megan finds dried blood and a hair on the steering wheel, Calleigh finds the pipe wrench in the tool box, the pipe-teeth covered with some foreign matter and they all spot the empty rifle rack. The truck's rifle was for sewer gators, per boss Mr. Jones.

In the lab, Horatio shows Delko a picture of Lisa Valdez, indeed a pretty woman, and Delko agrees. Horatio says everything we need to convict this guy is right here, let's find it. Items left in the burned out car were three pairs of shoes, a bottle of cognac, a dozen roses, and a charred, rubber item Horatio cuts open to the smell of strawberries. Horatio sends Delko to a guy named Artie, owner of the adult playground, with a picture of Jeffrey, asking if Artie recently sold Jeffrey strawberry teddies.

Speed informs Megan the blood found on the steering wheel belonged to Father Carlos. The pipe wrench had Emilio's brain matter, and Father Carlos did not have a head injury. Megan shows the analysis of the brain matter to Speed, she adds, he killed Father Carlos without a temporal lobe; Speed says hard to do. The steering-wheel-hair Megan found Speed will compare to the house-hair.

A search of the Medina property outside the house with scent dogs shows drag marks leading to the water's edge. Calleigh says do think if we dragged the water bottom we would find the rifle. The scent dogs find buried clothing with blood stains, a pair of boarder shorts. Speed calls Megan, reporting the steering-wheel-hair matches Mrs. Medina's hair found imbedded in Cameron's room-wall. Iris Medina drove the truck. Calleigh pulls Cameron's shirt from the hole in the ground. Megan tells Det. Sevilla, we are going to have talk with the mother.

Delko tells Horatio Artie says hello; Jeffrey purchased the teddy three days ago, proving he lied about when he last saw Lisa. Horatio asks Delko to re-check the Jeep, Delko balks, saying he has covered it. Horatio says then he is going free, for now. A tough realization for both Horatio and Delko because there is nothing left in the Jeep to connect Jeffrey to Lisa and the crime. Horatio hands a folder to Terrell, a technician, asking to create a picture for him.

Iris Medina says she killed Emilio. It has nothing to do with Cameron, she says. She is confessing to Det. Sevilla. Megan disputes Iris's confession, Cameron killed him. Megan says the clothes dug up were Cameron's; blood from his father and him were all over those clothes. He killed his father to protect you, didn't he? That same night you and Cameron dragged his body to the river. When Cameron needed to talk to someone about what he had done, he went to see Father Carlos. He told the Father what had happened, the priest said to go to the police, Cameron bolted. After driving Cameron to the skate park, Iris went to Father Carlos, pleading for him not to tell the police. She went to the truck, saw the rifle, went back, shot Father Carlos twice, killing him. She told Father Carlos you knew what Emilio was doing to her; you never told anyone.

Horatio grills Jeffrey with his lawyer present. Horatio says the baby has Jeffrey's DNA, sit down. You fed Lisa enough Demerol to kill her and the baby. You did not want the baby because it was going to cramp your style. Jeffrey leaves with his attorney. Horatio promises to haunt him until he gets a confession.

Cameron has returned to church as an altar boy. Megan is joined by Horatio at Father Carlos' funeral. Iris is at the rear, officer present. Horatio leaves a picture of Lisa's daughter at the altar."

As the investigation continues, the detectives realize that they are dealing with a serial pedophile.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Deran Sarafian'],"['', '', '']",[],"['one word episode title', 'pedophile', 'pedophilia', 'serial killer', 'girl murdered', 'murder of a child', 'dead body of a child', 'reference to malcolm x', 'reference to frankenstein', 'child pornography', 'death of daughter', 'cotton candy', 'murder of daughter', 'serial child molester', 'remote controlled toy truck', 'mascot costume', 'arcade', 'ball pit']",[],"Opening has mothers and their children having fun at a restaurant for kids, games galore. A little girl is having fun at the ball-pen, mother watching her play. She came over to her mother so mom could take her sweater for her, she went back to the pen, ducked down once, and was gone. The five year old was lured away just as she was playing with others. The place was sealed by an employee when the mother could not find her daughter; but by then, it was too late.

Horatio comments, this place is a buffet for these creeps, as he looks at the little victim lying dead on the restroom floor. Detective Bernstein says fifty witnesses, and the comeback by Horatio, saying fifty suspects. The Detective was looking at the restaurant patrons, as was Horatio, all of them huddled along a partition.

The CSI team arrives, Delko, Calleigh, Megan each receive assignments, which include surveillance cameras to be checked, to finger print everyone, including children. Horatio and Megan are in the bathroom where the body lies, Horatio noticing glitter near the victim. The killer cut her hair and he left boy's clothes lying near the body. Horatio speculates it looks like he was planning on disguising her, as though he had planned to take her out of the building, not to kill her there, but something stopped his plan. The suspect used a maintenance cone ""out of order"" to secure his privacy, closing the washroom door after putting the cone outside the door. There was trace on the male clothes brought in by the suspect. The mother tells Horatio she did not know anybody there. Alexx arrives, checks the little victim over, cause of death unknown, and the murderer took the little girl's underwear. Horatio speaks to the waiting reporters, the perpetrator left a mountain of evidence, and beneath that mountain, lies his grave.

Megan says the blue on her lips tested as candy. Alexx finds a mark on the victim, Megan is taken a print, Horatio is covering the path taken by the killer using the security video, Calleigh is watching by the CSI camera, noticing Horatio is out of view; they find a footprint.

Alexx examines the victim in the lab. She finds cracked ribs, triggering the lungs to fill with blood. He probably got on top of her, cause of death asphyxiation. Toxicology found he gave her barbiturates with her candy. Tests also found antihistamine, she had a cold and was convulsing. She went into anaphylactic shock caused by the barbiturate reaction to the antihistamine. He was not trying to restrain her, he was trying to revive her. Too much force was applied, cracking the ribs, in the effort to revive her. The shock caused him to abandon his original plan and leave.

The single-customer refusing to provide prints is a registered sex offender, Det. Bernstein cuffs him, he leads Horatio to his Caddy, in the trunk there is a child's pull-suitcase. Interrogation of the suspect, Horatio says in prison they kill child molesters before kidnappers and rapists. Suspect was married with child. Suspect was playing with himself before he came into the building. Horatio tells Calleigh he is not the suspect, but he is going back to prison.

Delko is checking prints on the cotton candy paper-holder, there are some, but multiple prints together on the holder. He checks the orange cone for prints, while Speed scrapes glitter from one of the checkered vests from the restaurant. The prints obtained are looking like the guy fell into a blender according to Delko. The shoe prints indicate the shoes are too big for person wearing them. Speed says the suspected killer got in the same way he got out, because the glitter on the vest matches that on the victim, employee vest allowed him access.

Megan and Delko figure this perpetrator has altered his fingers in such a way to alter his prints by cutting his own skin off and put them on different fingers. Megan says if we cut up his prints and reassemble them we can figure out who he is. Delko says like a human jigsaw puzzle. They work on the puzzle helping them to identify the guy, a multiple offender with a record.

The manager providing the security video to Calleigh is interrogated by Horatio, learning the security password was mistakenly in plain sight in the manager's office.

The foot print yields a butterfly residue located in the nearby park. Megan says we got a print match. The match identifies a person living near the park, long criminal record, convicted pedophile. Megan and Horatio go the suspect's house near the park. The house is clear, they enter and begin to process. Conclusion is he does not live there, but he plays there. The house is full of kid's stuff plus porn. Megan is spraying for prints. Horatio finds a vest from the place of the victim. There are photos of missing children publications; Horatio calls them headstones.

The CSI team and police dig up the yard, finding children buried; Horatio was spot on. Horatio calls Alexx to look at a child's body, determining only three-to-four weeks in the grave, concluding, he is not waiting more than a month between kills, likely accelerating kills.

Lab findings reveal blue sugary substance from cotton-candy found on underwear of child buried at house. Results show microscopic crystals of sugar in raw form, not yet heated, used for cotton-candy. The suspect makes the stuff, he likely has his own cotton-candy machine.

Horatio and Speed look for man making and selling his own cotton-candy. They find Stewart with cut fingers and a bagful of kid-place-logo clothes. Horatio interrogates him. We found your stash of porn, you troll for little girls, spraying barbiturates on cotton-candy, then offering to the little girls at places catering to kids.

The pervert is arrested for the last time."

Horatio is interviewing the party's women, entertained by male lap dancers, like the dead man. Calleigh, processing, finds mosquitoes on the body and an empty condom wrapper. There are tie marks around the wrists of the dead man as his body is removed the party house.

Detective Martin Puig is working with Megan and Delko at a marina where a man comes out of the Atlantic, only to drop dead on the Tupper's yacht. The body is lying astern, examiner Brian Fan says single stab wound to the gut, based upon his pallor, he apparently bled out. Megan asks where's the rest of the blood, as she wipes the deck, testing with positive results, but there isn't much of a sign of the victim's blood. She asks Delko to help search for any kind of weapon. Delko finds a flashlight with blood stains and hair, he examines and sneezes, contaminating the evidence.

Alexx declares the young victim Noel died of natural causes, while Horatio suspects one of the young women had something to do with his death.

Megan interrogates the Tupper's, Lisa Tupper hit the victim over the head with the flashlight, husband Mark was asleep on board when the stabbed stranger came on board. Megan tells Det. Puig she doesn't know yet if the assault had anything to do with the man's death.

Calleigh is examining the pristine mosquitoes found on Noel, not swatted, squished, just left dead, like Noel. An educated hypothesis is mosquitoes drink blood, so Horatio says let's have Alexx go over the body again, looking for something lethal. Ladies at the party are at HQ to offer a DNA swab, Noel had sex with one of them just before he died. One of the ladies, Claire Heitmann, steps forward as the one having sex with Noel. She says he was fine afterward, she tells Horatio she did not use a condom. The mosquitoes are telling nothing while Alexx shows Horatio a injection mark on Noel's body. There was nothing in his medical records indicating any injections taken to date, for any reason, also commenting this is one of the hardest crimes to solve. Horatio says poison. Horatio talks with Speed and Calleigh, Alexx is going to take a sample from the body, look at it, find out what it is, who gave it to him and why. Likely test his liver, it being the filter of blood.

Alexx is explaining the autopsy results to Megan, a compressed spleen, big heart and lungs, and she found an unknown microorganism in his wound, handing Megan the container for analysis.

Horatio with Speed and Calleigh are at the home of the party, namely the kitchen, all processing for whatever caused Noel to die. Horatio finds an injection object he analyzes for prints, it appears to be an Epinephrine injector.

Delko, looking in a microscope at the microorganisms, found barrel-sponge spores in his lungs found in deep water, indicating the victim was free diver, dropping below fifty-feet, without air-tanks. A dangerous sport Megan admits and Delko knows, he says deep water diving makes the organs contract. Det. Puig leads Delko and Megan to a contest location of free divers, at a nearby marina, a man, Carson Cassidy, thinks they are here about his brother, Adam Cassidy. The body was Adam Cassidy. There is another guy, Ignatio Pius, a Cuban diver, there commenting about the limits these divers push. Delko and Megan process all the knives and spear guns from the dive location. The spear gun with traces of human tissue belongs to Ignatio. Delko says to Speedle in a nearby processing area, we got a murder weapon and a suspect.

Speed holds up a pair of panties, DNA results prove they are Nikki Olson's, her bra clasp was on Noel.

Calleigh notices Horatio's evidence, an Epi pen, for the treatment of allergies, he says the print match is from Nikki Olson. Calleigh says there for a single dose, Horatio adds they could be reloaded, giving Noel his last few minutes alive.

Nikki Olson is brought in for questioning, admitting the Epi pen is hers, for bee stings. Nikki had relations with Noel, and she gave him the shot on purpose, the liquor he had contained shellfish which he was allergic, hence she offered the shot. Calleigh says the single shot could have caused a reaction for Noel, but it probably didn't kill him.

Ignatio is questioned by Megan, noting he is losing his hearing from dives, and had he dived to the depths Adam Cassidy did, his inner ear would have ruptured, hospitalizing him below fifty feet where Adam picked up the barrel-sponge spores. Ignatio is not the murderer. They have human tissue from the gun, but are missing a knife. Delko admits to Megan his mistake for not telling about the sneeze on the flashlight. Delko dives for the missing knife using an air tank and a metal detector; finds it.

There was chalk dust on a condom wrapper leading to a third grade teacher Sophia Ananova called in for questioning, denying sex with Noel. Horatio notices her nervous mannerisms, admitting being a smoker, with a nicotine patch on her, she says she is trying to quit.

Alexx and Horatio test the body area for residue of nicotine patches, noting as much a four or more patches would have killed Noel. Alexx discovers nicotine was introduced through penile tissue.

Megan swabs the found knife, no trace. Delko says Carson Cassidy won the 1998 diving contest and his brother won it every year since, and the trophy knife was Carson's, but no trace of blood. Delko opens the knife handle, exposing blood residue inside.

Horatio requests, hold it on the teacher's arrest, the box of patches was full, and it takes time to distill the nicotine. Speed and Calleigh ask where was the source of the nicotine. Horatio mentions the nearby flowerbed was filled with roses, roses have aphids, roses are sprayed to get rid of the aphids, explaining why the dead mosquitoes. Speed adds, nicotine is an age-old known insecticide. The gardener is on site when CSI comes calling to the party house, and the insecticide found by Speed is forty percent nicotine, with multiple prints on the bottle. Into the lab it goes, per Horatio.

Megan interrogates Carson Cassidy, his bare skin shows a scar from a barrel-sponge cut. Running on adrenaline, he shot at Adam, Cassidy then pulled his knife, stabbed his brother, primal instinct, but probably not intentional, under those conditions. Carson's attorney is present during this Megan statement along with Det. Puig.

Homeowner Melissa Starr received numerous phone calls from Noel. Horatio says Noel told Nikki he was seeing someone new, based on the phone calls, Horatio believes it was Melissa. It was Noel who wanted Melissa, and he thinks she cut it off by poisoning him, her fingerprints on the insecticide bottle, pouring it on a condom from Sophia's bag, letting Noel come to her. The nicotine from the insecticide-condom killed him. Melissa dropped the condom in the flower bed when she was picking up petals from the garden while speaking first to Det. Sevilla."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0534838/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,"A bloodied toddler walks down a street. Back at her house, her mother and three brothers are found dead. The only other survivor is her father who has a gunshot wound on his back.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Richard Pearce'],"['', '', '']",[],"['one word episode title', 'mass murder', 'postpartum depression', 'child murdered', 'death of a child', 'dead body of a child', 'murder of a child', 'death of a teenager', 'death of a teenage boy', 'murder of a teenage boy', 'murder of a teenager', 'toddler', 'blood soaked', 'murder of a family', 'widower', '16 year old boy', '9 year old boy', 'dead boy', 'dead child', 'neglect', 'father figure', 'father son relationship', 'brother brother relationship']",[],"Season 1 Episode 8 - Slaughterhouse A toddler wanders down a suburban sidewalk with obvious blood-soaked pajamas. Horatio pulls up to where the little girl was found, asking Detective Sevilla, What have you got? The detective says the child was spotted by a neighborhood gardener as she was walking down the sidewalk. Horatio asks the paramedic What have you got? The paramedic answers, there's not a mark on her. Horatio responds, my guess is someone close to this child is either dead or dying.

Processing begins with the child, as Speed works with Horatio swabbing the little girl. The pajamas are bagged for trace-processing. Horatio mentions to Sevilla the sunburn on the child is on one side of her face, indicating her line was a straight line North. Horatio searches the neighborhood for a starting point of the toddler, while processing begins with the pajamas having Megan cutting in pieces and dispensing them. Speed and Calleigh ask if they found out where the child was to start, then Speed recognizes something on the stained pajama foot, and leaves to examine it more carefully. Megan and Calleigh process blood DNA, three for three male blood types on the child. The child picked up soil with grass-killer-chemicals on her pajama-feet, indicative of an area where it has been recently re-sodded. They are looking for a house with recent re-sodding, Delko is in a copter helping search for the house. Calleigh calls Horatio with a revision, there are four different DNA's all related to the little girl.

Det. Sevilla and Horatio find the house with a blood trail down the front walk, entering with guns drawn, finding dead bodies in the house. Horatio finds a surviving male, the shot man saying his son did this. Horatio summons an ambulance for the surviving father. Horatio hears something, asking Sevilla it's origin, when they find another shot male at a bedroom-computer-desk. Horatio enters an unkempt kitchen, dirty dishes everywhere. Horatio heard the beep of the microwave oven, opening it, he sees a baby bottle. Speed meets Horatio just outside the house, body count five, one surviving and being wheeled by paramedics to the waiting ambulance. Current family member status is father was brought to the hospital, toddler is at social services, and a shotgun is found, the likely murder weapon, left on the floor with spent cartridges.

Processing begins outside by Delko while Calleigh enters the house. Det. Sevilla provides the identification of the house members, names, ages, including a newborn. Dad works at a local mall, Mom is stay-at-home, four kids, Luke 16, Tim 9, Erin 17 months and Max 6 weeks. Delko reports no forced entry, sliding glass doors open, Det. Sevilla says Mom was tired with a newborn. Horatio states the toddler belonged home, the Dad didn't, what was the dad doing home.

Alexx states TOD between 8 AM to 1 PM. Mom is the only member not shot in the back and Speed says mom was last to die. Son, headphones in use, back to door, home with a fever, based on TOD temperature being higher than the rest. Calleigh and Delko examine the master bedroom collecting black hairs in the bed and a prescription bottle full of anti-depressants, re-filled three weeks prior. The mother was a blond.

Horatio and Delko are in the kitchen see the empty fridge, the overflowing garbage, the fast-food-bag, dirty dishes all around, a family obviously living on fast food. Horatio notices the fast food bag is full, but one partially eaten fry.

Calleigh and Horatio are in the garage, Dad's keys left in the ignition, garage door closed and gun-safe rubbed with ammonia. The garage had two cars, the station-wagon mom rarely used.

Alexx is providing Horatio data on the dead. Luke, 16, shot twice, shoulder and base of the skull; Luke had gastric ulcer, teeth-enamel worn to second layer from grinding, and he bit his nails; the shotgun spray killed his infant brother lying next to him. Horatio states Lukes wounds signify he was on the move, and Alexx says it would only take a few pellets for the infant to die. Teen-age Luke's stomach contents reveals the half fry, hardly chewed, interrupted by the carnage in the house. Alexx says Luke was a sixteen-year old stress case, possibly due to his home life. Mother's wound is one shot to lower head; no GSR on mother; died instantly; nine year old Tim's wound was immediately fatal as well; one shot dead center, severed his spinal cord.

Sevilla talks to surviving father as he lies in hospital bed. He says he got a call from his wife she was upset the baby wouldn't stop crying. He felt heat in his back. Delko hands Megan a hair sample from the master bed, it is dark hair, Megan says mother was blond. Calleigh dismantles the shotgun for processing, diagramming the murder scenes throughout the house, indicating the victims and how they were shot.

DNA comes back from hair in master bedroom, dark hair traced to sister-mom is blond. Calleigh is fingerprint-fuming the shotgun and baby-bottle. Sevilla interrogates the sister, who is aware the mother was seeing a psychiatrist and on medication. She was in their bed holding her sister for comfort, she accuses husband of hiding at work, while mom was home with four kids. The sister was away on business at the time of the killings. Calleigh says no prints legible on shotgun, nine year old Timmy was warming the baby's bottle.

Speed and Delko are inside trying to find out how the toddler survived. They discover there is a bloody blanket in the doghouse and there is no dog to be found. Horatio and Calleigh re-enact the shooting of the mother on the couch by firing a shotgun into a dummy observing the spatter on the artificial ceiling. Conclusion was her body angle on the couch indicate she was taking a nap. Possible she could have pulled the trigger, but doubtful.

The blood-transfer onto the doghouse-blanket came from Mom---one source per Speed. The blanket did not contain any yard-chemicals per Delko, therefore, someone carried the toddler to the doghouse; that member would have had the yard-chemical on their shoes. The distance from the doghouse to the house entrance was eleven-feet four-inches, too far for the child not to get the chemical on the blanket. Inspecting the shoes to determine who carried the toddler indicates Luke has a trace as does Dad. Whoever carried the toddler into the yard with Mom's blood did so to save the daughter.

The killer was someone still standing after the mother died, only two members eligible, Luke and Dad. The crime is now a murder, not a murder-suicide. Speed asks do you think Luke could have done this? Horatio speculates he is a 16 year old kid with an ulcer; could he get sick of taking care everyone?

Luke brings lunch home to his siblings and walks into a massacre. Luke saves his sister, putting her in the dog house with her blanket, the killer shoots nine year old Tim. Instinctively, Luke picked up his infant-brother, thinking the killer was still in the house.

The key evidence is the gravitational blood-drops on the baby's shirt are from the father. The drops prove the father was standing over the baby when he was shot in the back by Luke. After dad fell from the shot, Luke grabbed the baby heading out the door, the father got up, shot Luke twice while Luke held the baby trying to leave the house.

Horatio and Detective Sevilla confront the father holding his daughter in his driveway. They explain to the father the significance of his blood-transfer to the baby's clothing. Horatio tells the killer exactly what occurred after the transfer where Luke shot him to prevent any more of his murders, only to be gunned down with his infant-brother, trying to escape.

The father is cuffed, put in the squad, saying he could not face them anymore. Horatio says so you shot them in the back. Horatio tells Sevilla the father is setting the groundwork for his defense, two-pronged, I didn't know what I was doing and I certainly didn't know it was wrong. The plea to be insanity, despite killing members of his family, three of four children and his wife.

Ammonia was on the father's shirt which he used to keep his prints off the gun safe. He called home for his wife to check the gun safe to see if he left it open, he came home at 11:45 AM, opened the safe without leaving prints.

Horatio laments to Speed that his surviving daughter will know everything that happened, showing a picture in the paper of the sister holding the daughter."

The intricate manner the ropes are tied suggests somebody put the victim up the tree; it was not suicide. Someone or a group performed these horrible attacks on the body of this man and hung him from the tree limb.

Processing begins with findings of a block and tackle system to lift the victim as Calleigh is taking her photos from a ladder leaning against the limb holding the body; Alexx is on the ground witnessing the wounds as is Speed. Detective Bernstein identifies the body belonging to a Professor Adam Metzger, Anthropology Department, at the university. Alexx says the victim had his eyes glued open causing retinal damage, there are puncture wounds to his torso from an ice pick with several more wounds over the body, yet he did not die of blood loss. The numerous wounds to the professor were not meant to kill him. Horatio finds the partially-buried corpse of a canine near the professor.

Detective Adell Sevilla watches a car winched by a tow, Delko shows up, meets Jerry, a police diver coming to shore, telling Eric the car had the windows open. Delko pops the trunk, finds a corpse that has been there for a few weeks, with bloating occurring having been in the trunk for a while. Detective Sevilla says it could be a mob-hit or drug-related.

Calleigh researching the hanging-rope-knots finds they are old-style military. Dean of Students walking Horatio and Det. Bernstein says the Professor was a odd-ball, his guests were controversial, his costumes the same; Horatio takes a DNA swab of each of his students.

Ned Sante is interrogated by Horatio, having his DNA appear on the professor's clothing. Ned was the product of the professor's mock lynching; Ned was humiliated, but did not kill anyone. Speed, Horatio enter the professor's house, encounter his students inside, one claiming he had an open door policy. They are looking and seeing unusual items relating to evil, i.e. a closet they open full of medieval torture items.

Alexx and Jade are imaging the corpse of the man pulled out of the submerged car-trunk, finding something struck his head. Delko inspects the car-interior finding adhesive tape usage on the dash, indicating the car was stripped of something. Megan pulls clothing from the trunk, personal items include a wad of paper, a car key, which works in the car; thinking someone drove him to the water. Delko inspects the vin number, both Megan, Delko saying something happen at the canal. Delko gets the autopsy report, the victim died from drowning.

Calleigh is processing the professor's wounds using the found medieval weapons, being she cannot identify the wounds from any conventional items. Horatio, Speed, Alexx know there were thirteen wounds from each old instrument. Calleigh's findings are none of the old-time weapons match the professor's wounds.

Det. Sevilla, Delko visit Larry Castanotto, car's owner, Larry claiming it was stolen and he got paid from the insurance company. Both police notice the dashboard bobble, adhesive missing, Larry refuses to surrender it. Det. Sevilla ponders, what kind of guy removes his bobble head from his car before dumping it into the canal? Delko quips, the same guy that puts someone in the trunk first.



The canine corpse pulled from the tree area is processed by Calleigh, Horatio finding the dog was tortured, wanting to find out who the dog belonged to when he pulls a microchip from the canine. The dog owner is student Ginny Taylor, the same person telling Horatio it was not his business what the students were doing when he and Speed entered the professor's house. Ginny is questioned in her home, she says the professor once asked for her to kiss his shoes; she says she did. She had no idea her dog was tortured, she had signs posted all over looking for the dog. She had no idea who killed the professor; she did not.

Det. Sevilla learns missing person report filed by girlfriend of deceased. Det. Sevilla, Delko discuss identifying the dead man, Doug Reed, whose girlfriend walks off the elevator as they speak. Girlfriend Caroline lived with Doug for three months, they were going to Aruba. Delko notices Doug wore ear plugs, he tells Jade Doug's work-shirt identifies his employer as Larry's, too. Delko locates box of extra ear plugs in Doug's locker, Doug's body has been cremated, per Alexx. Imaging the ear to the earplug, Delko has a positive match.

Calleigh informs Horatio the content of the rope was bamboo, native to Columbia, coinciding with the Columbian guest lecturer the professor had in his class. Horatio, Calleigh interrogate the Columbian, after which x-rays reveal the tendons in the man's hands have been severed; Calleigh says he could hardly pick up a pencil. Horatio concludes the Columbian is not our killer.

Det. Sevilla, Delko look over the paper Megan found in Doug's pocket, a travel brochure to Aruba, in the brochure they find writing, flipping the paper over is a deposit slip belonging to Larry's account. A stop at Larry's place has him confessing he and Doug defrauded the insurance company, but Larry says he did not kill Doug, when from another room appears Doug's girlfriend, Caroline. Larry claims he was at the dog track when Doug disappeared, a credit card transaction will prove his whereabouts.

Speed has assembled the shredded paper from the professor indicating his notes refer to an assistant who either typed the notes or shredded them. No prints on the professor's keyboard, Calleigh finds no prints on any other office supplies, when Horatio says the assistant was wiping down blood, not prints. Calleigh sprays the office accessories including a letter opener in dagger form, showing traces of blood evidence, image of the professor's face left on the copy machine's glass, eyes glued open from the super glue found and cotton sweater threads left on the copy machine. Horatio asks who wears cotton sweaters. A warrant search for Teresa's taser was given to Speed. The taser likely in use judging on the wounds found.

Accident re-creation software, Delko, Horatio find the software shows the car does not move on its own, it needed a push. An actual re-creation using the car with Megan noticing a trunk bolt Doug hit his head reaching for the music CD. Doug fell into the trunk by accident trying to grab the CD before pushing the car into the canal. Doug drowned in the trunk, having hit the loose bolt reaching.

Horatio interrogates Teresa revealing being tortured over the last year, concealing the scars with wearing cotton sweaters in the eighty-degree weather. Finally, she had enough abuse, tasering him, inflicting wounds with the office equipment accessories, later super-gluing his eyes open, placing his head on the open copy machine, setting it to one-hundred copies, blinding him. Horatio informs Teresa she had been an experiment of the professors all along, she finally realized it and coupled with the insulting things he said about her work, is what put her over the top to kill him, which she admitted."

Another body is found, seemingly burned from the inside.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Deran Sarafian'],"['', '', '']",[],"['two word episode title', 'death of teenage girl', 'teenage girl', 'female friendship', 'friendship between girls', 'underage drinking', 'detention camp', 'diaphragm the birth control device', 'domineering mother', 'death of daughter', 'accidental death', 'scantily clad female', 'leech', 'beer', 'reference to ferrari', 'reference to thelma and louise', 'teenage model', 'female model', 'speedboat', '15 year old', 'insect bite', 'girl wears panties', 'reference to world war two', 'villainess', 'therapy', 'punishment', 'training', 'fire', 'fraud']",[],"After an initial field examination of a body by Alexx, Horatio declares they are in search of a crime scene, since the corpse is too far from the road to be anything else; while Speedle and Delko exam a decomposed body inside a trailer where spilled milk is present. Tire tracks on the road near the teenager's body were from an ATV; victim had zero point zero blood alcohol, but the odor of alcohol on her. The man from the trailer had burns about his face, inside his lungs and stomach indicating something caustic.

Clues to the girl's murder begin at a tough-love camp for troubled teenagers. Why did the victim break into the camp and the ATV track was a match to an unauthorized unit on the grounds parked near a barracks. Two sets of prints found on the diaphragm, the victim's prints and somebody else. Female victim identified as Dara Winters, a teen model, whose mother just filed a missing persons report. The camp drill instructor offers a lie detector test, Horatio gets prints and a nasal swab. Gasoline was the cause of the young man's death, i.e. he ingested the fuel with sodium content suggesting salt water from the marina.

The gasoline was siphoned by the male victim, it being a high-octane variety used for large-bore engines, i.e. jet-ski racing engines. The victim sold 120-plus octane fuel, which had to be stored off site due to its volatility. A suspect with an altered jet-ski is questioned about the male victim, while the female's clothes are found in a submerged backpack.

Pollen taken from the victim is found to be plentiful in the water where the clothes are collected. Horatio declares the water area the primary crime scene. Sgt. Marcus, the drill instructor, is cleared of any crime, through the DNA test. Horatio determines the suspect is at the camp of cadets. Salt was found on the barracks' floor, commonly used to remove the parasites. Rolled up pant legs reveal leech bites on the senior cadet. The body was moved by senior cadet Valerie to its final location when she found cadet Julie and Dara in the barracks with beer, Julie cutting Dara's hair by consent. Valerie did not want to get into any more trouble; when making rounds, she found the body and moved it.

Interviewing the male suspect, Speedle and Delko show him the gas he purchased from the victim was cut with 89 octane from the corner pump. He claims his engine locked up due to the mixture. He automatic-speed-dialed the victim-phone and when he did answer, he hung up immediately, He claims he had a major bill to fix the engine due to the intake of the lower octane fuel mixture. The suspect swears he did not kill the victim. Milk consumption settled his stomach, but a spark generated from his cell phone likely lit the gasoline fumes that killed him.

Calleigh interviews the victim's friend Julie, finding out the second set of diaphragm prints were the mother's, telling the daughter ""choir girls don't make the A-list."" The victim, Dara, was tired of the modeling, but the mother pushed her to continue. Swabbing the mother's car seat shows a pollen match to the plant prevalent at the crime scene water. The mother is called in for questioning. Horatio tells her of the pollen match, putting both at the scene where her daughter took her last breath. The chase started by the victim running away from the demanding mother. Dara ran from her mom after a confrontation, ultimately running into the brush, falling, hitting her head, downed, unconscious, getting eating by insects because she was left overnight by her mother.

Horatio is reading Megan's resignation where he informs Detective Sevilla."

Alexx examines the corpse on the floor, Speedle scans the tub, Horatio scans the wall finding blood evidence someone tried to wipe away; Horatio also photographed the thermostat at 75°, Alexx saying time of death, per victim liver temp, is between seven and nine last evening. The victim was stabbed repeatedly with a slim sharp instrument, washed with cardamom soap, aroma noticeable on the body, and a ring around the tub remained. At the forensic lab, Alexx examines the victim, telling Horatio she bled to death from close range puncture wounds, aorta bleeding into chest cavity, diminishing blood loss noticeable at crime scene, and for Horatio to propose the question ""could the killer have known less external blood loss with puncture to the aorta?"" There was no sexual penetration, there was adhesive tape residue on mouth, wrists and ankles, prompting Horatio to ask rhetorically, ""sheer enjoyment just for the kill?"" Speed examines the bed comforter finding mold from an unknown source. Horatio examines her personal effects, finding a finger print on her belt, and the print belongs to a man in the system with a prior, some twelve years hence. Horatio telling Speed we will question the prior. Det. Brunner and Horatio serve a warrant on suspect residence, cuff him and inform spouse of his future location as they search the house.

Det. Sevilla first on scene describes initial scene to CSI personnel. Gas station has car-jacking attempt of German couple, husband shot, perpetrator chased husband, leaving trail of blood drops, but why the chase if it was a jacking? Calleigh examined the vehicle, Delko examined the garage, found shot body with fatal head wound, spatter on back of truck in garage. Video tape shows husband shot at the gas pump, perforations on the glove match the pattern of the blood smear where the shooter lost his footing and slid, explaining the floor skid marks, husband left dead on the garage floor. Alexx explains spatter from bullet entry through mouth, making him spit blood running after the killer. Calleigh says he was hiding from his assailant, spitting blood at a truck tailgate, before he collapsed and died. Lab analysis of the cam footage from the station reveals the wife ducked, then her husband was shot, yet he got out to chase the shooter. The shooter left a smudge print on the rear-view-mirror.

Calleigh asks Delko what kind of murder requires an advanced meeting, Delko responds a hired hit. Who did the hiring, because Malcom was aiming at the wife, until she ducks before the shot. Arriving in Miami two days prior how does she employ the hired gun without him flipping on her. Answer is she knew him from before the killing. Malcom has a brother Brian who knew the wife from working in Europe, and Brian was offered ten-thousand cash and a plane ticket to kill the husband. Brian went to brother Malcolm for the job. Brian told Malcom to get a fresh strap, i.e. a different gun to the job, but Malcom failed to do just that. Sevilla said ballistics found the bullet recovered pointed back to a prior convenience store robbery where the adult is still serving time, but the juvenile, Malcolm Davidson, served only a few months and is at home with grandma. The print left on the mirror contained grandma's lipstick, Malcolm had wiped with the same glove holding the gun pictured on the security camera. Malcom was in the car prior to the murder, because the security cam shows the shot fired, but no Malcom entering the car. The lipstick came from Europe, where Brian met Greta, wife of dead husband. Calleigh and Delko search the home of garage suspect, finding glove washed, worn in holdup caught on camera, suspect arrested, bullet from gun identified from prior crime with suspect doing time. Delko finds the driving glove in Malcom's closet, analysis provides blood was from the husband, lipstick was from grandma, while Caleigh's find of lipstick smudge print on the mirror was grandma's lipstick, too. Ex-husband takes children out of house while spouse speaks with Det. Brunner about prior record of current husband. Wife claims husband was at sales meeting Wednesday night, detective finds the meeting a lie. Wife also did not know of the prior assault charge.

Horatio refers to a forensic scientist proving how you could frame someone using their own fingerprint. The belt-print is an oil(stick deodorant)-based fingerprint with victim-blood on top of it, making it look like a natural fingerprint, but it is not. Horatio believes the killer left the print behind intentionally, but he left the mold spore behind by mistake. There is a link between the mold and the host, common to bathroom shower curtains and bathroom surroundings.

When CSI originally entered hotel room it was 75°, flower petals from the room indicate someone played with the air-conditioning because the petals were adversely affected by the cold room. The bound and gagged victim did not change the thermostat, someone was in the room after nine PM and changed the thermostat to very cold, waiting in the room while the body cooled. Alexx states cooling the body made death appear earlier than it was. Speed states the power company confirms the spike in usage from nine to midnight. Speed and Horatio now know time of death was altered because killer turned the A/C lower to cool the room after the killing. Speed remarks the new time of death clears Cole Judson. Horatio then places the suspicion on the ex-husband.

The criminal record information of Cole is known to the ex-husband, not to Wendy Judson. Horatio asks Speed if the new suspect purchased that information on Cole. Purchase of information was granted to the owners of Cole's building, his landlord, and the criminal record appeared. There was no evidence of the background check coming from the ex-husband. Interviewing Mrs. Bastille with Det. Brunner, Horatio asks to use her bathroom, where he scrapes the bath grout for mold, noticing the cardamom soap on the tub. Horatio finds out the Mrs. Bastille takes cardamom soap baths with her husband, Lee Bastille. Mrs. Bastille says the marriage is lacking closeness over the years, rather mundane. She claims Lee brought the soap home Wednesday. Horatio tells her the woman murdered was bathed in the same soap. She tells Horatio they ate dinner the same time, seven, and Lee was called at nine to a tenant's place for repairs; but she never heard the phone ring. Horatio asks her to leave for her own protection. Horatio and Brunner are interrogating Lee at HQ. Cole helped Lee with plumbing repairs, when Cole's print was obtained from the plumber's putty impression, Lee made an epoxy mold of the print, transferring to the belt when he killed the woman. Horatio took the putty, the soap, and scrapings of mold when he was in their bathroom. He told Lee there was a transfer of mold from Lee's bathroom to the bed spread. Horatio tells Lee he left Susan McCreary bound and gagged, returning home to his wife to eat dinner at seven establishing an alibi. Later, after Lee killed her, he dropped the room temperature significantly in order to masque the actual time of death. Horatio continues telling Lee he might have been successful without the bloody print, but he went too far by bringing home the soap from the hotel. Lee describes his life as mundane until he experienced Susan's life slip through his hands, satisfying his curiosity.

Closing scene has Horatio giving Cole Judson a ride home, meeting Wendy and the kids in the front yard of their home, one landlord short."

Horatio, Speed enter house wearing protective gear, using hand signals and in-gear-communication, find a neighbor, dead on the kitchen floor. They attempt to clean the same kitchen of deadly chemicals by bagging glassware.

Delko, Calleigh ready to process different scene where a senior citizen is found dead in her retirement-community home. They meet Det. Carrillo describing the scene as a massacre, with blood all over, leading to the victim; Alexx looks over the body, describing a fractured skull, and TOD around two AM. Calleigh, Delko take pictures, Delko lifts paper from a pool of blood near the body.

Exhaust fans are working at the drug house, Speed picking up bagged glassware putting it in buckets, all clear for explosion danger as the fans are working to clear fumes and Horatio gives an all clear to wheel out the body. Horatio finds a plastic glove which Speed bags and tags. Det. Sevilla found the owner, interrogated at HQ by Horatio. The meeting does not go well with the smug doctor explaining a group of dermatologists own a numbers of homes which are rented. The conversation with Horatio prompts the doctor to mention next time he will bring his lawyer, which Horatio adds, next time you might need one; a prophecy later to be proved true.

Alexx has the woman on the exam table reviewing with Delko her skull fracture, unable to identify the cause of the fracture, toxicology report showed blood thinner taken maybe explaining the blood pool size, and there were late stages of Alzheimer's based on tissue samples.

Speed, Horatio in lab, victim died from asphyxiation by nitric acid fumes, while they discover the formula was not followed to produce ecstasy, mistaking one ingredient for another, Horatio tells Speed we are chasing the cook, rather than Speed's the fumes or the pills.

Calleigh is interviewing Betty's sister Pearl who was out of town the night Betty was attacked; Pearl says everybody knew Betty was alone that evening, Betty could not keep a secret.

Horatio fumes the glove found at the house, identifying Gregory Kimble; Det. Sevilla adds the dermatologists use the type of glove that leaves no fingerprints. Det. Sevilla, Horatio interrogate Kimble, he asks for his attorney, having an upper-lip burn, possibly coming from mixing chemicals. Sevilla states to Kimble you drive a new Lexus, have no job, you are a student. Horatio demands his clothing be confiscated and Det. Sevilla pushes a jail-orange-jump-suit in front of him.

Delko meets returning trace employee Laura, inquiring about Betty, there was a recent sexual encounter, no sperm count, DNA to be checked. Delko ran a search for sex-offenders in the area, Keith Sewell. The convicted-rapist-gardener pulled in for interrogation, is abrasive, but provides DNA.

Speed, Horatio looking at Kimble's clothes, find chemical trace, but he is being discharged by the states attorney. Something about Horatio's brother is tied in with that attorney, as the confrontation escalates when the attorney leaves. Evidence not sufficient to hold Kimble per Florida statute.

Det. Sevilla, Horatio confront Kimble at a new house where he is unloading his cargo of chemicals, interrogated by Det. Sevilla and Horatio; Det. Sevilla gets a call a nineteen-year-old died from ecstasy. Delko, Calleigh interview all the senior men at her complex. Calleigh takes a ice-plant leaf from a suspect shoe and a swab for DNA.

Horatio, Alexx discuss the exam of the nineteen-year-old victim, Horatio takes a stomach fluid sample and Alexx searches for an undissolved pill for identification. She pulls a pill from the victim, showing it to Horatio with lettering on it. The lettering is from the target, dermatologist Welmont, but the weak-cook-Kimble is the ammunition to nail the target, per Horatio to Speed. On to Kimble's house they go.

Delko tells Calleigh there is so much gossip coming out at the complex that he doesn't know who to believe; Sewell, the sex offender is out as a suspect, alibi confirmed. Delko pulls the recovered piece of paper, processing it to reveal a letter from a law office confirming Betty's will was changed. Calleigh says Pearl did not kill her sister, Delko says somebody did.

Horatio, Det. Sevilla, Speed and an squad-officer are at Kimble's home, front door locked but Kimble is dead in the driveway vehicle. He was stabbed multiple times sitting in a vehicle with someone he knew. Horatio, Speed determine the murder was recent, bringing the vehicle to the lab for a look at what Speed cannot identify readily.

Calleigh, Delko are in Betty's bedroom, agreeing every drop of blood was Betty's, the also agree a string analysis to determine the point of origin. They walk through what they see, blunt force was at the counter-top, spatter going high, laying near creating a blood pool, got up and fell again hitting a table, got up moving down the hallway, spatter patterns around where she fell hitting another table making another pool of blood, spatter in the bedroom radiates in a complete circle, leaving no space for anyone else. Delko says all this blood indicates she laid there until she died.

Horatio, Delko review evidence from the vehicle seat. It is a bandage from a carcinoma removal, proved from imaging the doctor from behind, his attorney present and matching it to the image from the car seat. Horatio tells him catching your cancer has become your undoing. Det. Sevilla asks his attorney about his knife, saying we know he carries one for his protection. Sevilla inquires Did you bring your knife or did you lose it? Attorney adds the doctor has to travel to some dangerous neighborhoods to his properties. The lawyer produces the knife stating the doctor is cooperating all he can along this matter. Horatio quips how commendable. Sevilla doesn't believe the knife would be handed over with traces of blood on it. Horatio says he is not interested in the blood. Horatio has Speed take digital pictures at every angle and give it back asap.

Calleigh, Delko are telling Pearl her sister Betty died accidentally; she changed her will naming Pearl the sole beneficiary. Pearl accepts Betty's fate, repeating to Calleigh something she said before about Calleigh's hair being similar to Betty's, indicating Pearl is sadly losing it, too.

Horatio takes pictures of Kimble's stab wounds, he then has Speed match them to the pictures taken of Welmont's knife; the match proves Welmont killed Kimble. Horatio confronts the doctor, with his attorney, explaining the irony, had he not turned over the murder weapon, he could only be charged with negligent-homicide of the neighbor, but as it stands now, I can charge you with murder and I haven't even gotten to the nineteen-year-old who overdosed. Welmont smugly says so what are you saying and Horatio responds, thanks."

Alexx said head-wound has something metallic with the blood, Bernstein says the driveway vehicle registration, a Porsche, is different than the house title name. An engraved watch found is a third name. Question is who the hell is this poor guy?, asks Bernstein.

Detective Riboul introduces Delko, Calleigh to the crematorium, one beaten body on the floor and one or more burned bodies in the crematorium chamber. There are broken porcelain containers about the floor. Benito Ramon owned the crematorium, and he lies dead in front of the chamber. Calleigh picks up gold fillings scattered about, and a red purse on the floor belongs to Michelle Carter. Officer Torres requests everybody take a look outside. Det. Riboul states the owner did not cremate the bodies when delivered from the funeral home, instead, he had them stacked outside. Delko says they can be identified by ankle bracelets or toe tags from the funeral home.

Horatio looks on as Alexx examines the murdered man, she finds a piece of cloth in the man's throat; cause of death, suffocation. After removing the tape over his mouth, Alexx says the fabric was the murder weapon; as he began struggling for air, the fabric got sucked down to his esophagus, until it had nowhere to go. Alexx saying he was sodomized violently, likely with a foreign object, the spleen and colon are both damaged. A scar on his arm appears to have been a removed tattoo. Horatio tells Alexx we have no idea of this man, there are no prints in the system, how hard would it be to raise that tattoo. Alexx heats the area, lifting the tattoo image of a gun.

On location, Alexx examines Benito's body, she says skull crushed; Delko shows evidence of the head hitting outside of the actual crematorium chamber. Detective Riboul says they count twenty-seven bodies out back, and Michelle Carter was reported missing two weeks ago, wearing a red dress with a red purse. Delko finds blood in the chamber, Calleigh wondering if Michelle was in the chamber.

Speed is looking to identify the gun tattoo from pictures of record, but no success. He does have a match from an ex-con recently released on a robbery conviction named Danny Blue; Horatio says let's bring him in, he has a matching tattoo from the same artist that designed our victim's tat.

The fragmented skull was not Michelle's, too old, per Alexx; the blood Delko found was Benito's. Michelle remains missing and Benito is clasping a foreign object with a death grip. Alexx saws off Benito's hand, placing it in the microwave oven to access the evidence. The metal object is an entrance pass to a South Beach club, both Delko and Calleigh have been there. They pay a visit to the club and the owners, neither can identify the pictures, and the metal pass will need a warrant for the holder. Calleigh gets a call, she thinks they found Michelle.

Danny Blue comes to HQ, gives up a hair sample, shows tattoo, identifies murdered man as Thomas Carpenter, he and Thomas did some robberies together, he admits to visiting Carpenter, arguing. Carpenter is scamming, but would not let Danny in on the scam. Danny was at work the night Carpenter was killed and it is a parole violation hanging with Thomas. Danny is lead away by Det. Bernstein.

Horatio and several police are processing the house where Carpenter died. Speed adds rust was found in the victim, probably a rusty pipe. Speed bags a cloth Horatio found on a table. Det. Bernstein shows Horatio a diamond necklace belonging to a Judy Johnson, raped by Carpenter, she committed suicide a week later, married, so Horatio and Det. Bernstein pay a visit to the husband, Dean Johnson.

Michelle Carter is found buried under all the bodies at the crematorium. Det. Riboul watches as Alexx looks at Michelle in her backyard grave with rodent bites on her. Michelle is on the exam table as Alexx determines the paint found on the body is similar to that used at the club, making the owners liars not identifying her.

Det. Bernstein interrogates Dean Johnson, explaining the manner in which his wife was raped matches the Carpenter murder. Dean mentions a scissors for which Horatio orders he see. Dean Johnson is mad at the police for not finding his wife's rapist. The semen sample is a match to Carpenter, proving he raped her, but there are three more victims, each sodomized, and all left Miami after filing their reports. Speed, Horatio question whether it was Dean killing Thomas since his story has not been authenticated.

Det. Riboul introduces attorney for the club, Vincent Graziano, handing over a list of employees and guests; Benito was a member and Michelle was an employee. An owner says he never saw Benito before and yes Michelle was an employee; he lied, impeding the investigation.

Speed tells Laura the scissor striations do not match those used with Judy Johnson and Thomas Carpenter. Judy's scissors had only her blood, not matching the one used to cut Carpenter's mouth tape. That means Dean did not kill Carpenter, at least with those scissors. Speed tells Laura the murder weapon is fabric.

Alexx tells Michelle's cause of death was strangulation, Delko matches paint from Michelle's hair matches paint taken from the club. Examining pictures of Michelle reveals a mark identical to the rings of the club owners; time to bring them in for further interrogation.

Speed sees the fabric analyst, he states the cloth was man-made making it easy to trace due its nature. Fabric is from Erin and Leonard's Home Décor where the vase from Carpenter's was confiscated.

Calleigh, Delko are gloving with club owners in a room, there attorney complains, Calleigh asks for each of their rings, one owner admits he cuffed Michelle, she started to work another club, the attorney adds to the story; Calleigh remembers pulling a rose from Michelle's purse. They give up their rings for testing, there rings are clean, per Calleigh's analysis.

Det. Bernstein, Horatio, Speed visit the Murphy furniture store, see the mailing list with Thomas Carpenter, see rusty pipe assortment, see fabric like the confiscated cloth, talk to Erin Murphy requesting all scissors seen in the shop and her hair sample.

Calleigh learns there was another club partner with a ring as she and Delko head back to the club.

Erin Murphy says her husband broke the inscribed vase when he was moving items while she was on a buying trip, the mark on her arm is from her cat, and, if she was raped, she would have reported it to the police. She was not familiar with Carpenter, husband handles the front with customers.

Calleigh, Delko identify the other ring holder, it is club attorney Graziano, who is lead off in cuffs to HQ from the club. The ring is given to him, he tries it on and it fits. Reservoir on the ring contained Michelle's blood. Calleigh says he is the majority owner of the club; the other two owners combined own less than one-percent. Michelle lured customers away from his club when she started her own. Graziano hit her with his ring on, he promised Benito a club pass to get rid of her. When he went to Benito to give him the pass, he saw the purse and the crematorium was not working, so he killed Benito and buried Michelle out back. Benito's blood was on the ring along with cremated ash. The odds are in favor of conviction of the murderer based on both substances on the ring. Calleigh tells the attorney a cremated body contains no DNA, Michelle's buried body contained DNA, hence he wanted her cremated. Detective Riboul cuffs the attorney.

Speed has Horatio look at a slide showing matching striations, saying these are the scissors used to cut the tape on Thomas. Erin Murphy claims she was never raped, she was on a plane at the time of the murder, per Horatio, which leads them to another victim. Leonard Murphy admits to Horatio Thomas raped him. Carpenter walked into his store, Leonard recognized him, but he did not recognize Leonard. He asked Thomas for his name, address for their mailing list, and given the opportunity, he went to the house committing the crime for revenge. Horatio says to Leonard, justice is not for you to dispense; Leonard is lead away in cuffs."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0534787/?ref_=ttep_ep15,,An environmental lawyer is poisoned with a radioactive isotope and has only one week left to help the CSI team find her murderer.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Jeannot Szwarc'],"['', '', '']",[],"['three word episode title', 'gender in episode title', 'woman dying', 'radiation poisoning', 'unrequited crush', 'female lawyer', 'reference to david and goliath', 'reference to hamlet', ""snapping someone's neck"", 'attempted mugging', 'hourglass', 'radiation', 'syringe', 'junkie', 'radiation sickness', 'environmentalist', 'radiation suit', 'theft', 'orange juice', 'decontamination']",[],"Opening the episode at night has a junkie chasing down a person to score cash for his next fix. Detective Bernstein and Horatio find a man dead face down on the pavement, a man with a criminal record, not dead from an overdose. Alexx says the cause of death was a cervical fracture, somebody snapped his neck. The dead man is Carl Aspen, identified by Bernstein. Horatio adds, the dead man picked the wrong person to rob.

Alexx processes the dead man, inadvertently he mistook a radioactive 10cc syringe for an extra-large drug fix, exposing himself to radiation so severe as to eat through his skin. Although not apparent on the pavement, it shows in the examiner's lab, the radiation has eaten away his skin, exposing his hand bones. Delko exposes himself to the radiation handling a gnawed pencil and the currency he found under the dead man; he is provided a detector device from the police radiation team member for any further radiation exposure testing. His exposure is deemed negligible.

Horatio lifted a name off the pencil during processing, it is from an attorney practicing environmental law. The team calls on attorney Belle King, and after introductions, Delko's detector begins to react coming from Belle, readings are ten times the exposure found at the lab. Belle is escorted in protective wrapping out of her office building into an awaiting vehicle. Horatio alerts his CSI's Belle has one week to live, she is considered a murder victim; she is not contagious. Each CSI is tasked to determine the source of the poison, ultimately to find the killer. Horatio visits and tells Belle she has about a week to live, based on the amount of iodine isotope-131 she ingested. Four cancer patients six-month's dosage is found in her.

Visiting her home, Horatio asks Belle about her enemies, as he notices a hateful letter written by a Sam Carver. Belle explains it is Sam's reaction to a multi-family-settlement, and she considered it the best she could obtain for all the victims. Belle mentions Mrs. Carver drops off fresh orange juice every few days to celebrate the new clean water; leaving the containers just outside her backdoor. A search of Belle's kitchen reveals radioactive-iodine-131 in her orange juice, tested by Calleigh in view of Belle and Horatio; they take the spiked juice with them to the CSI lab.

Calleigh and Horatio agree the Carver's are innocent, despite the hard feelings left with the husband of a deceased son. Horatio, Calleigh prove the orange juice container from Belle's kitchen had a hole in it, injected from a syringe. Horatio comments we need to find someone who knows their way around a syringe; that person is not a Carver. Delko examines the cash found at the crime scene, finding a credit card number pressed into the currency, he calls the company to identify the card holder. Belle is still at CSI HQ telling Horatio there is a $128 million suit brought against Risher Pharmaceuticals she initiated for contaminating the ground water effecting one-thousand home-owners. Risher manufactures the same iodine-isotope-131 used for cancer patients.

Horatio, Bernstein, Delko, Calleigh all are at Risher. Delko, Calleigh begin to process the lab, Delko noticing a lock into the lab has been changed, Calleigh is looking at the footprint left in the lab and they both see the iodine stored in the same refrigerator as the employee beverages. Horatio, Bernstein notice a lock has been changed located right near the receptionist desk while waiting for the Risher CEO. Bernstein adds with all the trouble Risher is in, he probably did not want to report the locks to police. Horatio, Bernstein interview George Risher, identifying the iodine-131 stolen, that he failed to report, a twenty-dollar bill with Risher's credit card impression on it with a dead mugger. Risher sarcastically thanks Horatio for finding the thief. Horatio promises to make it his mission to get him, if he finds involvement; Risher is hostile during the conversation, claiming Belle does not have the evidence she claims.

Lab results show the substance found on the Risher lab floor was chicken manure, likely coming from Belle's yard, since she raised a few chickens. Speed shows Calleigh, Delko the pictures he developed taken from the rolls in Belle's office cabinet. They think Belle was there, Horatio thinks otherwise; something is not right, we are missing something, according to Horatio.

Belle is speaking to Horatio from her bed at her home, obviously very sick. He takes her sneakers for processing. She says she cannot win her cases with illegally obtained items, breaking into that bastard's lab would be against the law. He asks her about the pictures of Risher's lab found in her office. She tells Horatio she has sources she will not divulge; the same way he would not give up his sources. She says she cannot give up this person, they are helping get the bad guys. Horatio determines Belle's shoes were no match to the footprints found in the lab; furthermore, Belle was never in the Risher lab. Speed looked for any sign the photographer might have left, Horatio notes the lock is the original dead bolt, indicating there is an insider, who maybe did all the photography and stealing.

Horatio confronts Belle on her patio, saying she had a source inside the company. She says the source would not hurt her. Horatio says he believes Risher poisoned her. Inspection of Belle's camera has no fingerprints, but the existing focus setting belongs to a farsighted-person taking the Risher photos; Belle is nearsighted. Scraping the fingernails of the corpse, DNA is obtained belonging to Parker Boyd, the front desk employee, who deleted files, i.e. Belle King photos, from his work PC as CSI came to arrest him.

Horatio grills Parker, finding he loved Belle, doing favors for her inside Risher, only to learn Belle only cared about sick people. Parker spiked her orange juice to get even with her, loved her enough to love her to death. Horatio tells Parker he will have time in prison to work on forgetting about Belle. Horatio sits at Belle's bedside, stating she was right, Risher was dirty, and now he has the evidence to go get him, proof to be used in court, as he was dumping waste."

While Prince Viserys, Jaehaerys' oldest grandson, was chosen, several lords supported Princess Rhaenys, Jaehaerys' oldest living descendant.

Nine years into Viserys's reign, his wife, Queen Aemma Arryn, is again with child. After many failed pregnancies, Viserys is certain Aemma will bear a healthy son. A great tournament is organized to celebrate the impending birth. Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, insists that Prince Daemon, Viserys's brother and heir presumptive, is unfit to rule, citing his brutal methods as Commander of the City Watch, but Viserys ignores his advice.

At the tournament, Viserys's only living child, Princess Rhaenyra, and her companion, Lady Alicent Hightower, Ser Otto's daughter, are intrigued by Ser Criston Cole, a handsome, common-born knight who defeats the popular Daemon in both jousting and melee. Meanwhile, Aemma suffers a breech birth that drastically risks both her life and her baby's. Viserys allows Grand Maester Mellos to perform a cesarean section, hoping to save the child, though knowing the procedure will kill Aemma. The infant, named Baelon, dies hours after his mother. Rhaenyra's dragon Syrax cremates their remains during the funeral.

At Ser Otto's request, Alicent makes a condolence visit to Viserys. Ser Otto later informs the Small Council that, at a local brothel, Daemon mockingly referred to the deceased Baelon as ""the heir for a day."" When confronted, Daemon says Viserys never supported him and claims he is a weak king manipulated by others, particularly Ser Otto. Outraged, Viserys removes Daemon as his heir in favor of Rhaenyra and banishes Daemon from King's Landing.

Viserys tells Rhaenyra a secret passed down through the generations: their ancestor Aegon the Conqueror dreamt of a threat from the North that Westeros can only defeat if a Targaryen sits on the Iron Throne. The lords of Westeros swear fealty to Rhaenyra as crown princess, while Daemon and his lover, Mysaria, depart atop his dragon, Caraxes."

Six months have passed since Rhaenyra's anointing as heir to the Iron Throne. Master of Ships Lord Corlys Velaryon demands that the Small Council take action after the Triarchy-backed pirates destroy four Westerosi vessels. Viserys refuses, wanting to avoid open warfare with Essos. He dismisses Rhaenyra's suggestion to show force against Drahar, and instead relegates her to choosing a new Kingsguard knight. Over protests from Otto and newly-appointed Lord Commander Ser Harrold Westerling, she chooses Ser Criston, the only candidate with actual battle experience.

Lady Alicent continues to secretly console Viserys. She eventually advises that he speak with Rhaenyra about Queen Aemma's death and the expectation for a king to remarry. Ser Corlys and Rhaenys suggest that Viserys unite their Houses by marrying their twelve-year-old daughter, Lady Laena Velaryon.

The Small Council learns Daemon, who previously seized Dragonstone, stole the dragon egg that was intended for the late Prince Baelon and has declared his intentions to marry his mistress, Mysaria, who he claims is pregnant, as his second wife. Ser Otto persuades Viserys to allow him to confront Daemon.

Daemon, who is illegally occupying Dragonstone, is supported by a loyal cadre of City Watch guards. Ser Otto and a small detachment arrive to confront Daemon, demanding he return the dragon egg. As bloodshed looms, Rhaenyra arrives on her dragon, Syrax. She persuades Daemon to peacefully return the egg to her.

Rhaenyra's disobedience in going to Dragonstone angers the king, prompting a heartfelt discussion regarding his remarrying to fortify the Targaryen line of succession. Ultimately, Viserys announces his intention to wed Alicent, shocking and angering both Rhaenyra and Lord Corlys.

Lord Corlys, insulted by Viserys rejecting his daughter's hand in marriage, secretly meets with Prince Daemon. Lord Corlys proposes they form an alliance to retake the Stepstones, using the victory to their mutual advantage."

Meanwhile, Alicent Hightower, having married King Viserys and giving birth to son, Aegon, is pregnant again; Queen Alicent and Princess Rhaenyra, once close friends, have become estranged. Viserys, disinterested in the Stepstones war, leads the court on a hunt to celebrate Aegon's second nameday; he intends to kill a white hart stag, considered a royal good omen. Believing Viserys intends to replace her with Aegon as heir to the throne, Rhaenyra storms away from camp, with only her Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole, following.

Viserys dismisses Lord Jason Lannister's marriage suit for Rhaenyra, while Hand of the King Ser Otto Hightower proposes betrothing to Prince Aegon, Rhaenyra's two-year-old half-brother and Otto's grandson. Master of Laws Lord Lyonel Strong advises Viserys to wed Rhaenyra to Corlys Velaryon's son, Ser Laenor, to heal the rift between Houses Targaryen and Velaryon.

While camped overnight in the woods, a wild boar invades the campsite, trampling Criston and attacking Rhaenyra before the two kill it. Before returning to the main camp, Rhaenyra encounters the white hart and allows it to go unharmed; meanwhile, Viserys takes two attempts to slay a regular stag.

Following the hunt, Otto tells Alicent that the realm's nobles will favor Aegon as king, despite Viserys preferring Rhaenyra. Meanwhile, Viserys assures Rhaenyra she will never be replaced as his heir, but urges her to find an influential husband to bolster her claim to the Iron Throne.

Alicent advises Viserys to send reinforcements to the Stepstones. When a messenger brings word of Viserys's decision, Daemon refuses to accept his brother's aid. He feigns surrender to lure the Crabfeeder's army into the open, at which point the Velaryon infantry, led by Corlys, and his younger brother, Vaemond, launch a counterattack.

As her ship approaches King's Landing, her uncle, Prince Daemon, flies past on his dragon, Caraxes, victoriously returning from his three-year military campaign in the Stepstones.

Daemon enters the throne room, wearing a crown and claiming the title ""King of the Narrow Sea"". He gives up the crown to his brother, King Viserys, swearing his allegiance. As the reconciled brothers celebrate at a feast, Queen Alicent confides her loneliness to Rhaenyra, who also admits missing their friendship. Daemon speaks to Rhaenyra, advising her to indulge her desires while fulfilling royal duties.

Late at night, Rhaenyra, disguised as a boy, sneaks out with Daemon to explore King's Landing's seamier areas. They drink, attend a bawdy play, and visit a brothel, where Daemon removes Rhaenyra's disguise and seduces her. Although she is willing, he is unable to consummate the affair. A frustrated Daemon leaves. Returning to the Red Keep, Rhaenyra seduces Criston, who is initially reluctant due to his Kingsguard oath of chastity, but they ultimately sex.

Ser Otto Hightower learns about Daemon and Rhaenyra's exploits from a spy called the White Worm. Otto informs Viserys, who reacts angrily to the news, as well as Otto's apparent spying on Rhaenyra.

Viserys angrily confronts a disheveled and hungover Daemon, who seemingly confirms the accusations and proposes to wed Rhaenyra. Viserys claims Daemon only wants the marriage to gain the crown, and exiles his brother back to the Vale. Alicent tells Viserys her belief that Rhaenyra is still a virgin.

To avoid scandal, Viserys orders Rhaenyra to marry Ser Laenor Velaryon. In exchange, she demands her father dismiss Otto as his Hand, claiming he manipulates the king for personal ambitions.

King Viserys and Princess Rhaenyra sail to Driftmark to arrange the princess's marriage to Ser Laenor Velaryon, the son of Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys, thus uniting the Targaryens and Velaryon Houses. Knowing Laenor is gay, Rhaenyra says that, once married, they can perform their royal duties and be free to have lovers. Later, Ser Criston Cole proposes that he and Rhaenyra run away to Essos and assume new identities. Rhaenyra refuses to give up the throne and says they can continue their current relationship. Criston feels used and despairs over breaking his Kingsguard vows.

Before leaving King's Landing, Ser Otto Hightower warns Alicent that if Rhaenyra becomes queen, Alicent's children will be considered a dangerous political threat to the throne. Ser Larys Strong slyly asks Alicent about Rhaenyra's health, mentioning she was given a medicinal drink. Alicent questions Criston about allegations that Rhaenyra and Daemon had sex; Criston, misunderstanding, confesses that he slept with the princess. Criston expects execution, but Alicent merely dismisses him and keeps the secret; Rhaenyra's dishonesty distresses Alicent.

At a feast celebrating Rhaenyra and Laenor's forthcoming nuptials, Alicent interrupts Viserys' speech, entering the hall wearing a green gown matching House Hightower's signal color for a call to arms. Her uncle, Lord Hobert, promises her full political support. Daemon unexpectedly attends the feast. Ser Gerold Royce confronts him, claiming he murdered Rhea.

Alicent notes the child, like brothers Jacaerys and Lucerys, bears no resemblance to Laenor. Alicent privately insists that Rhaenyra's children are bastards, an allegation King Viserys repeatedly ignores.

Alicent's son Aegon, aided by Jacaerys and Lucerys, pranks his younger brother, Aemond, who as yet has no dragon. Alicent scolds Aegon for misbehaving and stresses family unity, saying he will one day fight Rhaenyra for the throne.

Ser Criston, now Alicent's protector and ally, trains the young princes in swordsmanship. Ser Criston taunts City Watch commander Ser Harwin Strong over his protecting Jacaerys like he was his own child, provoking Harwin to attack Criston. Lord Lyonel Strong later chastises his son Harwin's behavior, stressing it substantiates rumours about Rhaenyra's infidelity with Harwin and damages the children's legitimacy. Amid the political turmoil, Rhaenyra denies Laenor's request to fight the Triarchy. To ease family tensions, Rhaenyra proposes that Prince Jacaerys marry Helaena, Alicent's daughter. Viserys approves, while Alicent disapproves, stating that Jacaerys is a bastard.

The rumours cause Lord Strong to offer his resignation as Hand of the King, which Viserys rejects. Viserys allows Lord Strong to escort the disgraced Harwin back to Harrenhal. After Harwin bids an emotional farewell to Rhaenyra and her children, Jacaerys asks if Harwin is his biological father; Rhaenyra replies that Jacaerys is a Targaryen. Reading the political winds, Rhaenyra moves her household to Dragonstone, also bringing Laenor's lover, Ser Qarl Correy.

Alicent mentions to Harwin's brother, Larys Strong, that she wishes her father, Ser Otto, was still the king's Hand. To that purpose, Larys recruits three condemned criminals, has their tongues removed, and tasks them to set a fire at Harrenhal, killing Lord Strong and Ser Harwin.

During the night, Rhaenyra and Daemon meet on the beach and make love. Prince Aemond sneaks out and claims Laena's dragon Vhagar as his own, nearly falling off while riding it. Aemond's cousins and nephews angrily confront him, with Laena's daughter Rhaena demanding that Vhagar rightfully should be hers. An altercation results in Lucerys slashing Aemond's left eye with a knife. All the royal children are brought before King Viserys. Queen Alicent wants Lucerys' eye gouged out as retribution. When Viserys refuses, a distraught Alicent grabs Viserys' Valyrian steel dagger and lunges at Lucerys. Rhaenyra blocks her, but Alicent wounds the princess' arm.

A pregnant Princess Rhaenyra and Prince Daemon return to the capital to defend Lucerys' claim. Upon arrival, Rhaenyra notices the Red Keep is now austere and grim, reflecting the new religion that Queen Alicent embraces. King Viserys, bedridden, disfigured, and mentally muddled is gladdened to meet Rhaenyra and Daemon's sons Aegon the Younger and Viserys the Younger. All royal matters are now overseen by Alicent and the King's Hand, Ser Otto Hightower, who keep Viserys quiescent with milk of the poppy.

Meanwhile, Talya, Alicent's lady-in-waiting, frequently visits Daemon's former mistress, Mysaria, believed to be the White Worm, providing information regarding the royals.

Prince Aegon, now married to his sister, Helaena, rapes a handmaiden, which Alicent later covers up. In an attempt to gain Princess Rhaenys' support, Rhaenyra proposes that her son, Prince Jacaerys, marry Rhaenys' granddaughter, Lady Baela, who would eventually rule as king and queen-consort, as well as a marriage between Lucerys and Baela's twin sister, Lady Rhaena, she becoming the Lady of Driftmark and continuing the true Velaryon name and bloodline. Rhaenys warns her that she will have to stand alone while expecting the Hightowers to rule in favour of Vaemond. She also pleads for Viserys to defend her succession to the throne, quoting Aegon the Conqueror's prophetic dream about the Prince That Was Promised.

Vaemond presents his petition to the court, where Otto seems prepared to rule against Lucerys. As Rhaenyra begins speaking, Viserys, frail and barely ambulatory, enters, shocking the court. Viserys struggles towards the Iron Throne, but is assisted by Daemon, who returns Viserys' crown to his head, it having fallen off on the stairs. Viserys asks for Rhaenys' opinion on the matter, and she replies that Corlys wishes for Luke to succeed him as Lord of The Tides. Viserys then affirms that Lucerys is the legitimate heir to Driftmark. Enraged, Vaemond calls Rhaenyra a whore, and his supposed nephews and Rhaenyra's three elder sons bastards; Viserys declares that he will have Vaemond's tongue, keeping to his declaration in Driftmark that anyone who dares question the parentage of Rhaenyra's sons would lose their tongue. Daemon then decapitates Vaemond, declaring that he can keep his tongue.

The royal families gather for a feast at which Viserys implores everyone to make amends. In response, Rhaenyra toasts Queen Alicent for lovingly caring for Viserys. Alicent, in turn, toasts Rhaenyra, and - still angry with Aegon - says she will make a fine queen. After the exhausted king retires to bed, Aemond abruptly ends the festivities by mockingly praising Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey as being three ""Strong boys"", alluding to their deceased, biological father, Ser Harwin Strong. This results in a fight among the princes until Daemon intervenes. Amid mounting royal tensions, Rhaenyra prepares for her family's return to Dragonstone. Viserys, on his deathbed, mistakes Alicent for Rhaenyra and mutters parts of Aegon the Conqueror's dream; Alicent misinterprets it as Viserys wanting their son, Aegon, to succeed him as king.

Alicent, Ser Harrold Westerling, and Lord Lyman Beesbury are stunned that Otto and other council members have secretly plotted to crown Aegon as king. When Beesbury protests usurping Rhaenyra, Ser Criston Cole kills him. Alicent refuses to allow Rhaenyra's murder to secure the throne. Harrold resigns as the Kingsguard's Lord Commander after defying Otto's command to assassinate Rhaenyra and her family. Criston later replaces Harrold.

Otto and Alicent separately race to find and influence Aegon, who has fled the Red Keep. Otto sends Kingsguard brothers Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk Cargyll to search the city, while Criston and Prince Aemond assist Alicent, though Aemond wants to rule. In Flea Bottom, the Cargyll twins check a fighting arena Aegon frequents, where children, including Aegon's own bastard offspring, are forced into mortal combat as entertainment. An intermediary approaches the Cargylls, saying that Mysaria has Aegon and offers for Otto to meet with her. Mysaria, revealing she knows Viserys is dead, barters with Otto to end the child fighting pits in exchange for Aegon's location. The Cargylls find Aegon, but Criston and Aemond seize him by defeating Arryk, while Erryk withdraws to retrieve the Crown of Jaehaerys. With Aegon in her control, Alicent mandates that Rhaenyra and Daemon will be spared and exiled if they bend the knee.

Otto coerces nobles into swearing fealty to Aegon; those resisting are imprisoned or hanged to warn anyone wishing to support Rhaenyra.

Alicent allows Larys to eliminate the network's leader and shortly after, Mysaria's house is burned. Princess Rhaenys Targaryen refuses to support Aegon as king and remains a captive.
