Harley and the Queen are watching at the Queen's tax office and the Queen assures Harley they'll still have their weekly coffees. In response to the Queen's query, Harley says that the Legion of Doom are still ignoring her and the Queen breaks off for an appointment.

That night at the mall, Harley tells the crew that they'll steal Kord Industries' weather-changing machine, which no villain has ever stolen. King Shark figures they shouldn't try if other villains couldn't do it, and Clayface assume a disguises and does a back story until Harley irritably interrupts him. Clayface reports that the machine is protected by a thousand-ish lasers. They have to get into STAR Labs to steal a personal force field to get by the lasers, but the air duct is only four inches wide.

The news runs a report about the Queen being released by Zatanna. The judge then sentences her to serve the remainder of her time in Arkham. Harley figures that they have to do something since the Queen has been stuck in the book for 30 years, and because the Queen has been like a mentor to Harley. Ivy figures the Queen belongs there, but Harley ignores her and leaves.

Guards are taking the Queen to Arkham when Harley rams the van over and frees the Queen. The Queen breaks one guards' arm, gets her story book, and leaves.

Later at the mall, Harley introduces the Queen, who has agreed to help them break into STAR Labs. The Queen pulls out Humpty Dumpty for King Shark and then makes scrambled eggs out of him. Ivy privately warns Holly that the Queen is a legit bad guy while Harley is a good person but a bad guy. She says that Harley is going to regret teaming up with the Queen, and explains that she's going out to ""do environment"" by dressing up like a 40s housewife.

Ivy goes to a cheap apartment and finds Kite Man waiting with a bouquet of roses. He keeps making sexual innuendos, and Ivy figures they should have met at the motel again. Kite Man then suggests that they go out somewhere public for once, and Ivy suggests that they got to a very dark movie theater.

Outside of STAR Labs, the Queen summons Cinderella's mouse, and the mouse arms himself with a mini-bazooka and cigarette. The crew prepare to enter the tunnel they've dug, and discover that the Praxis family reunion is going on in the park they've chosen. A guy who kicked his soccer ball reports the crew to the rest of his family, and the Queen tells Harley to steal the force field while she keeps the family busy. The Queen goes over and summons some fairy tale characters, and a satisfied Harley goes into the tunnel.

Later, the crew run out with the force field and discover the Queen has slaughter the entire Praxis family. The Queen explains that the Big Bad Wolf tore the family apart so she killed the guy... then everyone saw her kill that guy, so she killed everyone else. Harley spots one boy, still alive and behind a picnic table, but tells the Queen she killed everyone. The Queen summons the Three Little Pigs to ""clean up"" the bodies by eating them.

Back at the mall, Ivy returns and asks Harley if she was right to be worried about the Queen. Harley admits her friend was right and she'll tell the Queen that it's over. The Queen comes over and tells Harley that it was fun shit, and says that she's going to stick around and help Harley get the weather machine. Harley hesitantly tries to suggest the Queen leave because her style is too intense, and refuses to cross the line of killing innocent people. The Queen isn't impressed and says that heroes have a line but villains don't give a fuck. She warns that the Legion gives zero fucks and if Harley wants to join them, she'd better start pole-vaulting over her lines. After a minute, the Queen says that she'll go but Harley is making a mistake.

Ivy meets Kite Man at an expensive restaurant and the host tells him that they're backed up even though Kite Man has a reservation. The villainess would rather go to a movie, but Kite Man persists.

The crew break into Kord Industries and take out the guards with tranq darts, the mouse still with them because he's a mercenary. He goes in and sets of the lasers, which reduce him to ash. Harley turns on the force field and goes in, and it protects her from the lasers. The beams bounce back, destroying the lasers, and Harley takes the machine.

Back at the mall, Harley calls Gotham's mayor and threatens to raise the city's temperature until he gives her a billion dollars. The mayor calls them a scourge, and they find the Queen and the Big Bad Wolf waiting for them. The Queen tells Harley that she messed up by pissing her off and let her walk away in one piece, and is willing to fuck over her friends. Harley refuses to hand over the machine, and a man jumps in on a lightning bolt and blasts the story book out of the Queen's hands. The Wolf disappears, and the intruder blasts everyone. He says that he's Jason Praxis, last surviving member of the Praxis family, and he's there for revenge.

At the restaurant, Kite Man complains the host that they still haven't seated him. The host seats Riddler immediately when he arrives, and Ivy tells Kite Man they should go. She'd rather not drop her name to get them a table, and he realizes she's embarrassed to be seen with him. Kite Man loudly argues with her, and loudly says who Ivy is. He walks off in disgust as their pager goes off.

At the mall, Harley admits that she saw one survivor and didn't say anything. Praxis threw himself against a nearby electrical fence and it gave him powers. He tells the villains that the only way they can make things back is to bring his family back, and Harley admits that they can't. Psycho shields them with a TK field but warns that he can't do it for long. Praxis tells them to hand over the Queen and he'll let the rest of them live. Harley immediately comes out with the Queen and tells Praxis that she's all his.

Ivy goes to Kite Man's apartment and apologizes for how she acted at the restaurant. Kite Man gets it because he understands having to live up to a superpowered reputation. Ivy admits that Kite Man doesn't care what other people think about him, and he says that he cares about what she thinks... and her ass. She says that she likes him, and Kite Man's roommate Bill comes in. Ivy admits that she's Kite Man's girlfriend.

Praxis prepares to kill the Queen, and the Queen tells Harley she doesn't have it in her to do it. Harley admits that she used to think she had a line and takes the Queen to Praxis, and Praxis knocks himself out when his lightning bounces off the force field on the Queen. Harley reveals that she secretly put it on the Queen, and says that she'd never sent a friend to her death. She's going to let the Queen go because she has the machine and won, and she's a bad guy but not a bad person. The Queen tells her she's a dumb person and will regret letting her go alive.

Praxis wakes up and asks if he avenged his family. Harley says that he did and he says he can finally get on with his life... and the Queen kills him. Harley is shocked, and the Queen leaves.

Ivy returns to find the crew trying to turn on the machine by guessing the password. After enough failed attempts, the machine self-destructs."

A guard comes up and King Shark says that he's waiting for the museum to open. Harley swims out with a treasure, and when the guards go after them, Aquaman arrives and tells them that he'll apprehend the airbreathers. Once the guards go, Clayface drops his ""Aquaman"" disguise and they go up to the boat where Psycho is waiting. The real Aquaman arrives and blasts Clayface, then tells them to return the Atlantean jewels. Clayface praises Aquaman as the ""Shakespeare of the Sea"", and Aquaman's dolphin jokes about Harley.

Harley fires a flare and Ivy emerges from the deep with a kelp tentacle monster. She grabs Aquaman with the kelp and Psycho pilots the boat away, leaving Aquaman to swear watery vengeance.

Later at the mall, Harley and her crew watch a newscast about the theft and how they made Aquaman look like an amateur. Ivy gets all of the praise, and Ivy insists that she's not part of the crew. Harley says that she got an invitation from the Legion of Doom asking all of them to come to the Legion's HQ to discuss further possibilities. Psycho figures they can finally move out of the mall, and Syd comes in and says that Gotham's Carpet King found the mall satisfactory.

The building shakes, and Syd says that he's not going with the crew. Psycho asks Harley to mention that he doesn't call women c*nts anymore to the Legion, and Ivy congratulates Harley on achieving her dream. Ivy refuses to go, insisting she's not in the group, but Harley guilts her into going anyway.

Later at the Legion HQ, Scarecrow shows the crew statues of their members. There's an aquarium with a real diver that King Shark can eat, and Scarecrow explains to Clayface that they do improve every Wednesday. He shows off their three kryptonite-powered submarines, and Lex Luthor greets Harley. Lex says that Harley is an evil rising star since she went solo. Ivy asks why they're there, and Lex explains that he nominated Harley to become a Legion member. He says that she should come to the party that night and mesh, and if goes well then she could become a member of the LODRSVP. Harley agrees and asks to get her parking validated, and Lex tells her that they don't validate.

As the others go to the gift shop, Ivy asks Lex why he's suddenly so interested in Harley. She notes that they've invited her multiple times but she doesn't want to join, and animates the nearby plants to grab Lex. Lex admits that he wants Ivy, not Harley, and they invited Harley to get Ivy to show. Ivy insists that she's not joining the Legion, and Lex tells her that if she doesn't then Harley doesn't get in either. Harley comes up and says the place is awesome.

Back at the mall, Psycho dozes until the building shakes. He goes out and Syd says at first that he didn't hear anything. He finally claims that it's just the pipes, and a monster extends a tentacle through the floor and grabs Psycho, then smashes him against the walls. It leaves him and Psycho demands an explanation, and Syd says that there's a giant tentacle monster in the basement.

That night, the crew arrive at the party and Harley worries that Joker is going to be there then says that she doesn't care. She sees her competition--KGBeast--and Ivy tells her friend that the place isn't Harley. Harley doesn't believe it and goes to mingle.

King Shark argues with the fish in the aquarium. Kite Man is there and approaches Ivy at the punch bowl, and explains that he's there catering. Harley notices that Ivy is talking to Kite Man, and Ivy says that Kite Man outclasses all the other villains. Aquaman blasts through the window and demands his family jewels from Harley and Ivy.

The monster retreats to the basement, and Syd suggests that they don't kill it like Psycho wants. He finally admits that the monster is his sister, and Psycho asks for an explanation.

Harley knocks Aquaman down and they fight. Clayface disguises himself as Superman and Aquaman cuts off his head with his trident. The other villains attack Aquaman, and Kite Man moves forward armed with his kite. However, he gets pulled outside when Aquaman knocks Black Adam through the skylight. Ivy admits to Harley that Kite Man might have called her babe.

Aquaman tells Lex to call off the villains because it's between him and the two female villains. Black Manta greets Aquaman and figures it's not not about him, and Aquaman blasts him back onto Ivy. Furious, Harley attacks Aquaman, but he shrugs off her blows and punches her into the aquarium glass. When Aquaman prepares to blast Ivy, Harley sees the cracked glass and taunts him. Aquaman throws his trident at Harley, who ducks. The trident hits the glass, breaking it, and the fish go flying everywhere. Aquaman is shocked at hurting his ""brothers"", and grabs the ones KGBeast isn't stomping on. Harley suggests he take the fish to a nearby YMCA pool, but Aquaman irritably notes that saltwater fish can't survive in chlorinated water. As Aquaman leaves with the fish, everyone applauds Harley.

Syd and Psycho go into the basement, and Syd explains that his sister Muriel and he were CIA. She was a scientist and Syd was a cleaner for the Agency. Syd asked Muriel to make him an octopus/chimpanzee hybrid--a monkeypus--to aid him. He eventually bugged her into doing it, but it went wrong and Muriel was merged with the octopus. The two men go to a janitor's closet and Syd then finds the right room next door. Inside is Muriel.

Harley tells Ivy that fighting Aquaman is getting her into the Legion. Lex fist-bumps KGBeast and glares at Ivy, who tells Harley that it's still cool to be nominated even if she doesn't get in. Harley says that she'd kill herself if she doesn't get in, and Clayface and King Shark come over. Lex tells Ivy that it's her last chance to join the Legion, and Ivy insists that Harley is good enough to get in on her own. Ivy looks over at Harley celebrating with her crew-mates.

A few minutes later, Lex announces that they have a new member. Ivy whispers to Harley to join her instead, but Harley says that she left Joker to join the Legion on Ivy's advice and she's going to join. As KGBeast gets up to accept his membership, Ivy tells Harley that the Legion were just using Harley to get to her. Lex welcomes their newest member: Harley. Angry, Harley sarcastically thanks Ivy for believing in her and goes to the podium.

The crew go back to the mall, and Ivy tells Harley to join the Legion on her own. Harley insists that the Legion is awesome, and tells Ivy not to put her insecurities on her. She figures Ivy is afraid Harley won't need her anymore, and hates it that Harley has made something of herself without Joker. Harley accuses Ivy of trying to sabotage her, and Ivy storms off.

The building shakes and Harley, Clayface, and King Shark fall through the crumbling floor. Psycho is telekinetically restraining Muriel, and Syd begs his sister to forgive him. When Harley asks for an explanation, Psycho gives her the one-sentence description. King Shark tells Syd to try and talk to Muriel, and Psycho figures Muriel understands English. Syd apologizes, and Psycho translates Muriel saying that she was angry because Syd abandoned her and she lost her best friend. Touched, Harley looks at her phone photo of her and Ivy together.

In her room, Ivy looks at the same photo.

Muriel thought that Syd would never give up on their friendship, and Syd says that he was afraid that he let it go too long and she wouldn't forgive him. His sister embraces him, and Syd releases Muriel from the room. Muriel goes out and begins a rampage, killing everyone on the street. Harley quickly closes the door so they don't have to see it.

The next day at the Legion HQ, Harley and her crew are granted access... even Psycho. Harley tells him that he can't go on any capers with a female member. She then starts to text Ivy, apologizing for overreacting. Before she can send it, Lex greets her and Harley deletes the message. Ivy, seeing the start of the messages, sighs in frustration.

Lex tells Harley that another member wanted to drop by: Joker."

Harley and her crew watch the video, and on it Black Manta beats up Psycho. Psycho not-so-convincingly says that he said nothing racist to Black Manta. Harley tells them to pull it together, and Lex comes in and ushers them out to where the other villains are waiting with a ""Welcome Harley Quinn"" banner.

Lex gives his speech and then Joker takes the podium and says that he thought no one deserves the opportunity more than Harley to join the LOD. He tells her that now Harley is killing it and applauds her, and leads the LOD in a round of applause. Clayface asks Harley not to make them her costars in her personal drama with Joker, and Harley assures them nothing can change her mind about her ex. As they go, Joker nods at Harley, who notices.

Later, Harley and Ivy meet at a café and Harley suggests that they start over after their argument. Ivy isn't interested, and Harley says that she knows Ivy was just trying to protect her and she's going to do the same for Ivy. She hopes that her being a member of the LOD doesn't affect their friendship, and Ivy says that it felt like Harley was going to abandon her. Harley assures her that she would never abandon her, and figures there's something Ivy needs smashed. Ivy shows her an ad for Planetwide Pavers and how they're destroying the environment, and says that she's going to destroy the company. Harley immediately agrees to destroy their new factory, and Harley expenses their meal with the Legion's corporate credit card before doing something evil.

Later at the Legion HQ, Lex shows Harley the Legion's gift: a case full of baseball bats. King Shark notes that there's only one chair, and Lex tells them that there are special offices for the crew. The Legion's cultural attaché Steve from Tulsa complains that Lex always calls him ""Stefan"" and leads Clayface, King Shark, and Psycho to their own offices. He takes them to the basement offices where the Legion keeps the goons and henchmen, and insists that they're not. Steve tells them that everything is broken and they can touch whatever they want, and Bane comes in and says that they work for him as well as Harley. They're blowing up a juicery barista after dinner and Bane is taking the crew with him.

The Legion has a meeting and Lex explains that it's where they get approval to use Legion resources for acts of evil. Joker wants to build a giant tower with his face on it, and says that he can do it for $600 million. Everyone approves except Harley, who says that she doesn't get it. She points out the flaws in Joker's plan, and Lex agrees with her. Joker scowls at Harley and agrees to come back with a more complete plan.

Later, Bane tells Harley that it's refreshing finally stood up to Joker. Joker comes in and pulls the plug on Bane's steroids, then thanks Harley for giving him feedback on his plan so he can improve it. He suggests they get a drink together so he can pick her brain about his plan, insisting that it's a work drink. Joker assures her that they're colleagues and he'd never have sex with her, and leaves.

When Harley goes to her office, her crew complains about the Legion putting her in the basement with the goons. Harley insists that they only work together and figures she has to game the system by talking to a colleague.

That night at a wings place, Harley and Joker meet for drinks. He complains when she says that it's hilarious but doesn't laugh, and Harley explains about Bane wanting to use her crew. Joker says that he'll convince Lex the crew doesn't have to work with Bane, because Lex wants to keep Harley happy. Harley is surprised that Lex and everyo0ne else thinks that she's a big deal and toasts her.

Ivy sits in her apartment and tells Frank that she's going to take the factory down alone even though there are no plants there. She figures Harley will show up and help her, but Frank notes Harley isn't there. Ivy points out how useless Frank is and says that she and Harley can take care of it. Frank tells her to diversify the color palette of her costume, and insists that hurtful words are another weapon in his arsenal.

Harley asks Joker how she's been, and they discuss Scrubs and their old schemes. Ivy texts to ask Harley where she is, and a waitress comes over and says that she ships them as her favorite evil couple in Gotham. She gives them drinks on the house, and Joker convinces Harley to stay for five more minutes. Harley texts Ivy at the juicery shop to say that she's busy with Legion stuff, and Frank has his new assistant Chaz bring him in to carry his pot. Ivy points out that Chaz is a marijuana dealer and Frank misread his ad, and tells Frank to have Chaz take him back to the apartment while she takes care of business. Frank realizes that Harley stood Ivy up, and Ivy tells him that Harley just had to reschedule. The plant doesn't believe it and figures that Harley thinks she's a big shot. Frank warns Ivy that Harley has changed and Ivy is on her own.

At the Legion HQ, Bane tells the crew that it's time to blow up Todd. Psycho refuses, saying Harley has taken care of it, but Bane says that he filed the proper paperwork with HR. King Shark calls Harley to sort it out, but it goes to voice mail and they go with Bane.

Harley and Joker are laughing it up over a fancy dinner on a ship, and Harley insists that it's just an extension of the business conversation they were having. They've tied up the staff, and when the staff complains the villains toss them into a lifeboat and share a laugh. Harley suggests that Joker build his tower underground and then shoot up above the surface like a jack-in-the-box. Joker is impressed, and Harley is surprised that he's accepting one of her ideas. He claims that he wishes Harley had gone solo sooner. Batman drops down from the Batwing, and Joker summons his helicopter by remote and knocks back Batman with a grenade.

Joker climbs up the rope ladder to his helicopter and says that he'd love to take Harley, and Harley remembers Joker doing the same thing before. He invites her to come with him this time, and Harley goes with him before Batman can stop them. As they fly off, Harley says that she used to dream of them escaping together. Joker says that he needs her and kisses her, and Batman flies up in the Batwing. When he sees Batman, Joker shoves Harley out and Batman rescues her before she falls into the ocean. He tells her that some things never change, and Harley throws herself into the ocean to escape.

Bane and the crew wait outside the juicery in a van, and King Shark goes inside to plant the bomb. Impatient, Bane hits the remote to detonate the bomb, and King Shark's fin hits the van. The rest of King Shark hits the van a second later, and says that Todd wasn't working that night. Clayface and Psycho take King Shark to the hospital, and Clayface rehearses a death scene for a margarine commercial. Ivy arrives and wonders where Harley is, and they set a TV news report about Joker dumping Harley after the newscaster Tawny says that they're back together.

Harley comes in and apologizes for running late. She claims that she was held up at a Legion meeting, but sees the glares and the news report and realizes they all know she's lying. Ivy is furious that Harley ditched her for Joker, and Clayface notes that some of them got their fins blown off because Harley didn't get them away from Bane. Harley tries to explain but they're not having it, and Ivy says that she's done believing in someone who doesn't believe in herself. Harley says that she made a mistake but it won't happen again, but the others don't believe her. Clayface and Psycho leave, and King Shark says that he'll leave as soon as he doesn't have a catheter in him. Ivy tells Harley that she has her own plan to focus on and she'd rather go solo on her plan. Harley runs after her but Ivy has already left the hospital.

Later, Ivy breaks into Paveways. She grows a plant from a seed she brought, but herbicide rains down from the spouts and kills it. Ivy tries to escape but there's too much herbicide and she collapses. The guards arrive and tell their boss that they got Ivy."

Later at the mall, Harley is sitting depressed. An unconscious Sy tools around on his wheelchair and Harley texts Ivy but gets no response. Harley hallucinates a sane version of herself, Dr. Harleen, that tells her Ivy isn't going to respond and says that she's there to help Harley. She tells Harley that she messed up several important relationships but there's still someone who will love her unconditionally.

Harley goes to her hometown of Bensonhurst and approaches her childhood home. She rings the bell and her mother Sharon answers the door.

The guard, Gus, explains that he's a low-level goon and doesn't have the answer to any of her questions. Gus considers letting Ivy go but admits that he needs the job. Ivy warns that she'll have to kill him first if she gets out without him, but Gus isn't impressed, says that they're harvesting Ivy in two days, and takes a call from the school where he teaches kindergarten. When he goes outside, Gus blows on a dandelion and a puff seed blows through the vent and into the lab. It lands on Ivy's hand, and she mentally controls it to find Frank and get Harley to rescue her.

Harley unpacks in her old bedroom and complains to Sharon about what happened with Ivy. Sharon points out that Harley hasn't called her in 36 months and apologizes for not staying in touch. Mother and daughter hug and Sharon suggests that Harley move back, be a psychologist, and make her life of crime a weekend deal. Harley warns the Legion isn't a weekend kind of thing, and realizes that Sharon kept the trophy she wanted her to throw away. Sharon admits that she couldn't throw it away and is still proud of Harley despite what happened.

Nick insists that he's reformed, and went to jail for almost beating an Irish to death. Harley says that she just wants to be with people who love her like Sharon, Granny, and the ashes of her brother Barry. Nick tries to get Harley to forgive him but she refuses, and he suggests that they start with a nice dinner.

Grandma says that she was just diagnosed with brain cancer, and a sniper shoots her in the head. Harley closes the drapes and the assassin enters the house, drawing a knife. Everybody is apparently dead on the dining table, but when the assassin turns Harley over, He realizes she sprayed ketchup everywhere. Harley shoves the knife into his chest and demands to know who he works for. Before he can say who, Nick shoots him in the head and says he was avenging Grandma. He explains the assassin was there to kill him, not Harley.

As the EMTs take Grandma's body away, Harley figures that Nick has been gambling again. Nick admits that he took out a loan from the Mob, and says that it isn't Harley's problem and he'll try to reason with the Mob. He figures that the last memory Harley will have of him is doing the right thing, and Harley says that she'll go with him to keep him from screwing things up so they kill Sharon next.

Nick goes to the Mama Macaroni Restaurant and meets with the Mob. Harley takes out the guard and demands to know which of them killed Grandma. The mobsters recognize her and she tells them to forgive Nick's debt or she'll kill them all. The Mob insist they're providing a vital community service and then open fire on Harley.

Back at the Quinzel home, Nick describes what Harley did to Sharon and how he was proud of her. Sharon insists that Nick has changed, and says that it's sad to see Harley going the next day.

She's glad they can all be there together, and there's a knock at the door. It's Grandpa with a bottle of wine. He heard Harley was in town and Grandma is dead, so he has two reasons to celebrate.

As Grandpa says that he's been diagnosed with high blood pressure and he doesn't have long, an assassin shoots him through the chest. Harley throws silverware at the assassin and they fight hand-to-hand, and Harley finally kills her with a steak knife. She figures the Mob is never going to stop, but is going to keep her family safe. Nick shoots her in the side and apologizes, but notes there was a $1 million bounty on her. He tipped off the second assassin to get the finder's fee, but Harley killed her.

Sharon yanks the knife out of the assassin and tells Harley that she tried to get her daughter her to change her life but she never did.

As they release her off of the gurney, she grabs one guard's security badge and cuts his throat, then drives a nearby scalpel into the other guard's eye. Two more guards arrive and figure that Ivy is harmless, and she grabs a gun from the dead guard and shoots them dead.

The villainess runs out down the hallway as the alarms go off. She kills more guards but runs out of bullets, and starts to pass out from the drugs as she finds the exit. Scarecrow and more guards are waiting for Ivy and grab her, and Scarecrow takes out a syringe and injects Ivy. She breaks free and tries to strangle Scarecrow, but collapses from the drug.

Harley and Frank scout the tower, and Harley blames herself for Ivy's capture. When she prepares to go in, Harley warns her that there are a lot of armed guards. A man drives up looking for directions and the guards gun him down on sight, and Frank tells Harley that she needs more crew.

Riddler comes on the TV to interrupt a football match and says that he's hidden a bomb somewhere in Gotham. Clayface is one of Riddler's crew, and Riddler announces a riddle for Batman to solve and find the bomb. When Clayface interrupts Riddler repeatedly to give oratory advice, Riddler has enough, announces the bomb is at a factory, and cuts the TV feed. Harley is offstage and asks if she can borrow Clayface for a minute, and Riddler tell her that she should take him.

Clayface tells Harley that he's feeling fulfilled, and she apologizes for leaving him and the others out to dry. She then goes to see Psycho, who is working at the boardwalk doing a mentalism routine. Harley then meets with King Shark, who passively-aggressively doesn't respond to Ivy. They all get together at the mall, and Harley asks for a second chance. They all refuse to rejoin her crew, but when Frank tells them that Ivy was kidnapped they all insist on saving her. They agree to help Harley... for Ivy, not Harley. Then they never want to see Harley again.

Syd comes in and asks if they're pulling a caper, and is shocked to learn they broke up a week ago. Harley tells him he was never in the crew but he can help rescue Ivy. Syd dozes off and they walk away, but he wakes up in time to drive them to the factory in a pretzel-wrapped wieners van. The guards aren't expecting wieners and prepare to shoot, but Gus arrives, wants wieners, and Harley gives him one and says it's from Scarecrow as thanks for their hard work.

Gus parks the van and the guards run up for wieners. Once they're served, the crew knock them out and toss them in the van. The crew then go in wearing the guards' ill-fitting uniforms,

Scarecrow extracts the unconscious Ivy's blood and mixes it with his fear pheromones, and then bottles it. His guards load the toxin in cylinders and store them, and when Ivy wakes up Scarecrow tells her that she's going to give birth to the destruction of Gotham. She points out that poisons don't work on her as Scarecrow prepares to dose her with his fear toxin, and he says that he used her DNA to engineer a special blend just for her.

The crew enter the building and hear Ivy screaming, and run into the lab. They realize she's been dosed with fear toxin and Psycho telepathically confirms the toxin is destroying Ivy's brain. Harley punches Ivy unconscious and says that they need Psycho to get them into Ivy's brain just like she was unconscious. Psycho points that Ivy doesn't have to be unconscious and Harley says that they should get into Ivy's brain and never mention the face-punching thing. Syd says that he'll protect their unconscious bodies, and Harley reluctantly agrees.

Psycho telepathically projects the crew into Ivy's mind, and a group of happy trees greet them. Behind the trees is a mulcher that eats the last one up and spews blood everywhere. The mulcher attacks the crew and they run from Ivy's fear, and Psycho telekinetically tosses Clayface into the mulcher to slow it down. Clayface's clay jams up the mulcher and it breaks down, and Clayface congratulates Psycho on his plan figuring Psycho knew his body would jam up the works. Psycho didn't.

Frank's dream version appears and after providing magical background music, explains that Ivy's brain is warped by the toxin and they have to destroy the thing Ivy's fears the most to save her. The mulcher monster disappears, and Frank points out a creepy mansion and reveals a door to it. The crew go through the door and finds a young Ivy crying over a birthday cake as her father Mr. Isley stands by. Mr. Isley announces that Ivy has no friends and tells young Ivy that he thought she had at least one friend but his wife knew better.

Harley yells that they're going to kick Mr. Isley's ass, but he just laughs and become a giant face. The floor tilts and everything falls into his mouth, and young Ivy cries for help. Harley tries to grab her but too late, and young Ivy yells that Harley let her die as she falls into her father's mouth. The giant Mr. Isley grabs Harley with his tongue, but King Shark bites through the tongue and Mr. Isley releases Harley and yells, blasting them all back through the door.

Frank appears and tells the crew that Ivy's death isn't her biggest fear, and her biggest fear is on the way. Kite Man walks up and says that ""he"" is coming and he couldn't stop ""him"". As Kite Man tries to fly away, he's incinerated by a fireball. A scythe-wielding Death walks up and throws a fireball at the crew.

Syd dozes in the lab, then jerks away and insists that everything is going great. He dozes off again and hits the alarm button, and a guard comes in and asks what's going on. Syd wakes up but has nothing to save.

Death keeps throwing fireballs and the crew keep dodging. Clayface turns into a bat for Harley, and she hits Death a lot. She pulls off Death's hood to reveal that Death is... Harley.

The crew wake up in the lab surrounded by the bloody bodies of the guards. Syd reveals that he killed them all with his cyborg body, and says that he killed the guards protecting the crews' bodies. Ivy wakes up and sees the corpses, and Ivy says that they have to save Gotham. Harley asks why she's Ivy's biggest fear, but Ivy refuses to discuss it. Psycho points out a Legion of Doom recycling bin and they realize it's all a Legion plot.

Scarecrow leads his men out in trucks, and a truck tows away the wiener van. Syd admits that he parked in a handicap spot. There's no cars in site, and Syd transforms himself very painfully and bloodily into a Transchanger Station Wagon. The crew get in and they drive after the trucks, and pull up to the trucks stopped at a stoplight on Harley Quinn Highway. The trucks drive off when the light turns green, and Syd races after them along the roller coaster track-shaped highway. Clayface and King Shark open fire on the trucks using Syd's built-in blasters, but the trucks are bulletproof.

Ivy grabs a vine from a nearby tree and jumps on one of the trucks, then grows the vine over the windshield. The guards, blinded, come out and Ivy throws them off the truck. As she takes control of the truck with the vine, Harley jumps on and hopes they can talk about Ivy's fear. Ivy refuses and slams the truck into the other trucks, and Harley jumps onto the cab of a neighboring car.

When Harley asks about Ivy's greatest fear, Ivy finally tells her that her biggest fear is allowing herself to count on someone and then them ditching her. She asked Harley, her one friend, for one favor, but Harley ditched her for Joker who treats her like shit. Harley wonders how they fix it, and Ivy says that she doesn't know.

All of the trucks go into a loop-over, and Harley's truck stops at the top and then falls. Ivy leaps onto Syd and Clayface catches her. They go through the loop and Harley tells them that Ivy is mad at her because of Harley's emotional neglect.

They pull up to Scarecrow's trucks, and Ivy leaps onto one of the remaining trucks. She dodges the guard's bullets and finds a leaf caught in the windshield wiper. Ivy controls it, cutting the shooter's throat, then the truck goes off the curve. Syd drives off a lower curve and Harley grabs Ivy and saves her.

Syd almost goes off a lower curve, dozes off briefly, and then goes after the last truck with Scarecrow in it. Scarecrow drives to Gotham Park and Harley has Syd drive over the weapon cache in her highway. Psycho catches the releases missile launcher, and Harley prepares to shoot Scarecrow's truck. However, instead she apologizes to Ivy and says that was the old her and it's time to blow her up. She then shoots the giant Harley statue, causing its head to fall in front of Scarecrow's truck.

Scarecrow backs up, turns around, and drives into Gotham Reservoir below. The toxin spreads and the water sprays via the sprinklers onto the plants in the nearby park. The trees animate and start eating people, and Syd screams in pain and collapses, partially transformed."

More of the darts hit Clayface, apparently killing him. Clayface does a death scene and then shrugs off the darts, which have no effect on him. The mutated trees surround them.

Gordon watches from the top of the GCPD as the trees kill citizens. He wants to bomb the entire city, but Batman shows up and points out that they can't bomb the park with the innocent civilians. He asks Gordon to be prudent, and warns he can't hold Gordon's hand because Scarecrow is crop-dusting fear pollen around Gotham's perimeter, forcing people toward the park. Batman informs Gordon that the Justice League is en route to handle the tree problem, and he needs Gordon to evacuate the park. Gordon wants to use tanks to get people out the park, and Batman forbids the idea.

Later, Gordon complains to the news reporter that they won't be using tanks to evacuate the park. The crew are trying to hold back the trees when the League arrive and handle the trees.

Clayface figures that they're saver there then in the overrun Gotham below them.

A giant emerges from the nearby castle and attacks them. Ivy uses Sy's phone to call Kite Man, who is reviewing kite designs with his roommate. She asks Kite Man to rescue them but doesn't say ""I love you"" back to him. Kite Man glides off to the rescue.

Harley wonders why Ivy has Kite Man's phone number memorized, but Ivy quickly notes that the giant has reached them to distract her. The giant squashes Clayface flat with his foot, and Ivy finally admits that she's dating Kite Man. Harley is shocked to learn about her friend dating Kite Man, and as they argue about why Ivy never told Harley, the giant grabs them. Everyone on the crew knew, but not Harley. Kite Man arrives to save them, squirting sriracha from a condiment pack into the giant's eye. He rescues the crew as they fall, and Clayface forms himself into a slide and keeps them from crashing when the extra weight drives Kite Man's kite to the dock below. Ivy and Kite Man kiss, as the crew look on and ewww.

Batman walks through the streets in a gas mask and is unable to reach the League. He Facetimes with Gordon and realizes that he's on a tank, and Gordon insists that desperate times call for tanks. Scarecrow attacks Batman, and Harley knocks out the tank crew, ties them up, and steals their tank. She drives it to her crew, waiting at the Legion HQ. They all get in and someone else blows up the HQ before Harley can fire the turret gun. A giant green-and-purple tower rises up from the wreckage revealing a screen showing Joker. Harley is surprised that Joker used her idea of a tower popping out of the ground.

On the screen, Joker announces that he destroyed the Legion and the citizens of Gotham deserve a better villain... like him. He fires a missile at the city clock, declaring Gotham RIP.

The news reports that the League are missing and Batman has disappeared. Joker's goons interrupt to have her stating doing Joker news. Harley tries to figure out a way to get the mutated trees away from the tower. Ivy spots a hose dripping Scarecrow's contaminated water and says that she'll draw the trees away. Kite Man goes with her, and Ivy drinks the water from the hose figuring it will make her huge like it did with the trees. Kite Man proposes to her first with an imaginary ring, and Ivy suggests that they circle back to it after the apocalypse and kisses him on the cheek. Kite He's happy it wasn't a ""no"".

After drinking the contaminated water, Ivy grows to 50' tall, apologizes to the trees, and beats them up. Harley and the others go into the tower, only to find Queen waiting for them. She says that she's working for Joker because he's an evil son of a bitch, and summons the Wolf disguised as Grandma to fight Harley. The crew run and the Wolf chases them.

The commissioner returns to reveal Joker has replaced his file with a musical greeting card, and Batman asks Harley what she brings to the table if he agrees to the team-up. Harley says that she brings the thing Joker wants most.

Later, Harley, Psycho, King Shark, and Sy advance on Joker's tower. Guns come out and Joker asks what they want. Joker insists on pointing out that he killed Ivy, and Harley says that Joker won and she wants to be on the winning side. She leads the tied-up Batman up, and Joker is thrilled she got him the one thing he doesn't have. Clayface, disguised as Batman, says that Joker is buying it, and Harley tells him to keep his mouth shut. Overhead, Batman ejects from his Batwing and parachutes on the tower.

At the ground level, grappler grab everyone but Harley. She dodges away from them, and Joker's automated guns open fire on her. Harley runs off, and the newspapers declare Joker the new king of Gotham.

One Week Later

Joker soldiers march through Gotham, taking Gordon and his men prisoner. The new king puts out a million dollar reward000 reward. When Harley, and when nobody brings her to her, Joker pulls out King Shark's teeth and wears them around his neck on a string. He also forces Psycho to watch videos of feminism rallies, shoves Sy down a flight of stairs, spins Clayface on a turntable to make a Joker urn out of him, and forces everyone to laugh at his televised jokes or get gunned down. As for Batman, Joker makes him the cuckoo in his giant cuckoo clock.

Harley prowls through the shadows, avoiding the Joker soldiers.

Joker soon gets bored of torturing Batman and wonders if he's having a quarter-life crisis for his 25th birthday. Scarecrow pours champagne to celebrate, and Joker reminisces about how he and Harley used to celebrate birthdays. When Scarecrow unmasks Batman he and Joker are both shocked to discover that he's billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. Joker is fu4rious that Scarecrow unmasked his nemesis, insisting that half the fun of their relationship was the mystery. He's so disappointed he can't even bring himself to torture Scarecrow. When Scarecrow says that he thought it was the kind of thing Harley would do, Joker insists that he doesn't care about Harley. Scarecrow points out that Joker kept saying Harley's name, Joker kills him with acid to the face. Turning to Batman, Joker asks where the electric car WayneTech promised that he put a deposit down on is.

Harley goes to Ivy's grave and leaves black roses that she dyed so that Ivy could have some of Harley with her. Kite Man emerges from behind the grave stone and reveals that he's been leaving there because he doesn't want to leave Ivy alone. Frank is with him, and a new bounty flyer for Harley alive blows into his face. Kite Man explains that Joker has Harley's crew captive, and is throwing a 80s party that night after the crew's execution, and Harley asks them to give her a minute alone with Ivy. Once they leave, Harley tells Ivy that she's probably going on a suicide mission and might see her on the other side. As Harley cries, one of her tears falls on the roses, and one of them grows behind her as she leaves.

Harley goes to the tower and Joker greets her on the TV screen. She tells him that there isn't going to be an execution, and threatens to blow herself up with a bomb vest if Joker doesn't do what she says. Joker lets her up to his penthouse in the tower and Harley asks what he wants from her. Joker gives her her old Harlequin costume and says that he wants her to put it on, and tells her to remember the fun she had in it. Harley insists that she didn't have fun, and once she got away from Joker she realized how deeply unfun being with Joker was.

Joker reveals the crew imprisoned nearby and points out that if Harley blows herself up, she'll kill them as well as herself and Joker. Everyone but Psycho tell Harley not to put on the costume, but Harley gets Joker promise that if she puts on the costume, he'll let the crew go. Harley puts it on and asks Joker if he's going to let her crew go. He drops them down chutes out of the tower, and they realize she sacrificed her life for them.

Harley asks what the plan is now that she's wearing the costume, and Joker tells her that he already has everything he wants but he's not happy. Once he got everything but Harley, he realized that it means nothing without Harley. Joker says that Harley is the missing piece to his happiness, and they both kiss... and stab each other in the side. They pull out the knives and fight, and Joker pins her down and says that Harley is his missing piece. He tells Harley that she's his one weakness, and he has no room for weakness so he has to get rid of her.

Joker figures that if he kills Harley, she'll live on as an emotional martyr in his soul. His goons arrive and take her with Joker, who takes her to the chemical vat where he ""created"" her. Joker explains that he's going to undo the mistake of creating her by destroying her, and the acid will make her a nobody. As Joker prepares to throw Harley into the vat, vines with roses on them grow toward the vat. Harley asks Joker to let her jump on her own so her last act can be her own, and Joker agrees.

Harley lets herself fall toward the vat, and Joker starts to walk away but realizes there was no splash. The vines lift Harley up, and she removes her Harlequin mask. Ivy lifts herself up with her vines and tosses away the goons. Joker runs for it, but Ivy garbs him and suspends him over the acid. Joker tells Harley that they can rule Gotham together, and then says that she's nothing without him. Harley tells him that it's not true, and she has f4riends who love and care about her. She's moving on with her life with the people who matter, and tells Ivy to drop Joker in the vat. Ivy is glad to do so, and Harley figures her tears brought Ivy back. They hug, and Ivy says that it was the renewing power of nature that brought her back... and maybe the tears helped a little.

As Joker sinks beneath the acid, he triggers a remote on his watch that blows up the tower. The pillar Batman is tied to comes down, releasing him. As a pipe falls on Harley and Ivy, Batman shoves them out of the way and the pipe lands on him. Harley and Ivy ride a vine out, and the exploding tower triggers an earthquake that turns most of Gotham into rubble.

Later, a news anchor reports that Joker is dead, Batman is missing, and there's no longer a Gotham for Joker to rule. The crew look over the wreckage of the city, and Psycho tells Harley that he always had faith in her. Ivy points out that the Justice League and the Legion are gone, and Gotham is in chaos, and Harley finally did it. The two of them hold each other and Harley admits the beauty of the destruction.

A laughing Joker emerges from the wreckage... his skin turned back to its normal color."

However, word has it that the launch has been delayed due to the two astronauts trained for the mission, Eric Sparkman and Frank Warren, having come down with some sort of viral infection. The head of Earth's Space Commission, Gerald Simmonds (Roy Dotrice), is presently being interviewed on the subject on a television news program. Simmonds is assuring the public that the Meta Probe mission will commence once Warren and Sparkman have recovered.

Moonbase Alpha - mankind's supreme achievement, located on the face of the moon - has a new Commander - John Koenig (Martin Landau), hand-picked by Simmonds himself - who's now on his way to the moon in one of Alpha's space shuttles called an Eagle. After watching Commissioner Simmonds on the news program while traveling in the Eagle, Koenig is contacted by Simmonds over the ship's video link with Earth, to discuss an update on the Meta situation. Controlled signals emanating from Meta (which has just been discovered to contain an atmosphere) have been relayed to Earth from the unmanned craft ""Spacefarer 9"", indicating intelligent life.

Meanwhile, on the moon's far side, resides a pair of large dump sites containing countless drums filled with nuclear waste from Earth. At the larger site, Nuclear Disposal Area #2, Professor Victor Bergman (Barry Morse) - senior scientific advisor of Moonbase Alpha, and Dr. Helena Russell (Barbara Bain) - chief of the base's Medical personnel, are overseeing a radiation check of the dump site. Several of the waste area's workers have contracted an unusual form of brain damage, and Dr. Russell theorizes that leaking radiation from this site may be the cause. As the suited figures labor on the moon's surface using instruments at the caps of the underground nuclear waste silos, Prof. Bergman and Dr. Russell are observing it on the monitors inside the Monitoring Depot. At the conclusion of the tests, the workers announce ""No radiation leakage"", baffling Helena Russell. Suddenly, one of the workers goes berserk, attacking the other, before the face plate of his space helmet ends up smashed on a rock. Consistent with one who has contracted the illness, his eyes had become an opaque white.

After Commander Koenig arrives at Alpha, he learns of the crisis on the base from Victor Bergman and Helena Russell, that has been withheld from the public, including that the Meta Probe astronauts, Sparkman and Warren (Robin Scott, David Rhys Anderson), are not going to recover. They have contracted the same affliction as the waste area workers. Koenig visits them in the Medical Department's Isolation Area, observing them hooked up to life support machines, with their eyes an opaque white. Their condition is terminal. The most baffling aspect is that the Probe astronauts have never been to Nuclear Disposal Area #2. Koenig confronts Commissioner Simmonds via video link with Earth, demanding to know why he was lied to. Simmonds insists that if the truth were to get out, they would lose the financial support for the whole Meta project. Koenig makes a deal with him; he'll get the Meta Probe launched if Simmonds delays the sending of any more atomic waste to the moon - a tall order - until he has the chance to check things out at the Disposal Area.

On September 10th, Prof. Bergman accompanies Koenig in an Eagle to visit Nuclear Disposal Area #2. They soon find themselves at Nuclear Disposal Area #1, which hasn't been used in five years. Koenig questions their pilot, Collins (Eric Carte), who explains that they always use Area One as a turning point on their way to Area Two. As Collins flies low over the waste area to give Koenig a good look, a strange sensation develops behind his eyes. At Disposal Area Two, Koenig has the nuclear monitoring team conduct the same lengthy routine out on the surface as the previous team had conducted for Helena Russell and Professor Bergman the day before, while he, Victor Bergman, Collins, and two security guards are waiting it out within the monitoring depot. At the conclusion, Koenig becomes frustrated as the results are just as innocuous as the previous day. Suddenly, Collins lashes out with a panic attack, demanding to get out of there. Koenig and Bergman are horrified to observe one of Collins' eyes is milky white. Collins uses his loose space helmet to repeatedly hammer the building's large window in a panic of claustrophobia. Koenig draws his stun weapon, rendering Collins unconscious, then they drag him out of the room and seal it off, as the fractured window gives way, causing explosive decompression in the room.

Back on Moonbase Alpha, astronauts Sparkman and Warren are now deceased, leaving the death toll at eleven.

On September 11th, a clue to the mystery finally reveals itself. Some of the personnel in Main Mission - the cavernous Control Center of the base - have been reviewing recordings of Sparkman's and Warren's training flights. They've discovered that the astronauts had experienced a communication glitch during one of their flights and have pin-pointed the location of its occurance to have been while they were flying over Nuclear Disposal Area #1. The Probe astronauts, like the Disposal Area workers, also used Area One as a landmark to guide them on their training flights. So Area One is now suspected to be the cause of the sickness. Almost on cue, reports come in that Area One is currently experiencing a sharp increase in its magnetic levels, coinciding with rising heat. Strangely, there is no radiation. The Alphans in Main Mission observe the waste area develop a spectacular heat storm on the large video monitor. Commander Koenig personally solos an Eagle loaded with detection equipment to Area One. As soon as he arrives, the whole waste site succumbs to a massive expansion of its magnetic field, causing the Commander's ship to lose control and crash. Nuclear Disposal Area #1 then burns itself out in a violent subsurface fire storm. Koenig is rescued and brought to Alpha's Medical Department.

On September 12th, Koenig releases himself from Medical, against Helena Russell's wishes. He consults with Victor Bergman, who hypothesizes that the stored nuclear waste buried on the moon has created an unpredicted effect, causing increased magnetic activity and brain damage. Worried that the same thing could occur at Disposal Area Two - which contains 140 times the amount of waste as Area One had, they send a remote-controlled Eagle to Area Two to monitor its magnetic levels. Soon after the ship had arrived there, their worst fears are confirmed as the Eagle experiences a magnetic surge, pulling it to the ground, rendering it inoperative. Koenig tells Helena that she was right about the cause of the illness - it was radiation; magnetic radiation. He concludes with the statement ""Now we're sitting on the biggest bomb man's ever made"".

On September 13th, Commissioner Simmonds arrives on Alpha, having been summoned by Koenig using an emergency code. He's briefed on the latest events and their proposed solution; they're to ""unearth"" the nuclear waste canisters at Area Two and spread them over a wide area of the moon's surface. Unfortunately, converting the entire Eagle fleet from passenger ships into utility vehicles proves to be an arduous process. When the first six Eagles have been refitted, they're sent to the waste area to begin the task. Simmonds becomes wary, stating that he has to return to Earth, but Koenig had involved his ship in the operation; having sent Chief Eagle pilot Alan Carter (Nick Tate) into lunar orbit to give them a bird's-eye view of the operation on the moon's far side. Deep into the task at the waste area, two of the six Eagles have experienced navigational failures and have had to return to base. Prof. Bergman suspects that the waste area's magnetic levels may be expanding. This was what occurred at Disposal Area One just before it erupted. Suddenly, Disposal Area Two begins to erupt. The mission is aborted, but the Eagles on the moon's far side are destroyed as a series of massive explosions occur, decimating the waste area and the surrounding landscape. The Moonbase begins to shake, then the personnel are all tossed around before being pinned to the floor due to G-forces caused by the immense explosions, which are pushing the moon out of the Earth's orbit. Alan Carter in the Commissioner's Eagle is witnessing the whole thing from orbit. The 300 or so Alphans (the later newscast will announce 311, but they were unaware of the earlier fatalities from the magnetic radiation) lay helplessly pinned to the floor, some unconcious or injured, as the moon is soaring away from Earth. Several minutes later, the ""fissioning"" on the far side subsides, ending the moon's acceleration. The G-forces wane, stabilizing the speed of the moon to a steady rate. Partial power is restored to the base as Alan Carter has managed to return to Alpha; his ship having been dragged along by lunar gravity. Commander Koenig issues a base-wide announcement, informing the hundreds on Alpha of their predicament. Without full resources (including their Eagle ships being in a disassembled state), Koenig deems an evacuation attempt out of the question. The Main Mission personnel watch a news transmission from Earth on the big screen, confirming that they're traveling into outer space with no hope of rescue. As the signal fades, Commander Koenig orders them to scan for other transmissions. They do pick up a signal; it's from the planet Meta, which they seem to be approaching. Hope arises that they could achieve rescue by evacuating to the planet, which is heading back toward the solar system. (Meta, however, is never mentioned in any future episode, so obviously that plan hadn't been exercised. According to Year Two publicity, the moon had been snatched by a space warp before reaching Meta, sending them light years away, hence Helena's status report on ""The Metamorph"" stating that they had just survived their second encounter with a space warp, also stating that there were no casualties this time, implying that lives were lost with the first one, possibly explaining the disappearance of Kano's predecessor Ouma after ""Breakaway"")."

However, their sensors indicate sophisticated structures. Attempts are made to communicate with the inhabitants, but there are no answers to their transmissions.

Without warning, three spaceships appear almost out of nowhere, heading for Moonbase Alpha. The ships are not of alien design; they're ""Hawks"" from Earth that were purposed for combat. Again, there are no answers to their communication attempts. Commander Koenig (Martin Landau) orders Alan Carter (Nick Tate) to lead a fleet of Eagles to intercept the Hawks. The base goes into Red Alert, then Commander Koenig issues a base-wide announcement informing the hundreds on Alpha of the current situation. The Hawks are faster then the Eagles, so the Alphans must act swiftly. As soon as the Hawks were in firing range, Koenig gives Carter the firing order. Each of the three Eagles choose a target and all three Hawks are destroyed. As the Main Mission personnel are celebrating, having observed the proceedings on the Big Screen, a second set of Hawks is detected, approaching from another direction. As the new Hawks move in on the base, the Alphans realize they're at war. Three Eagles are launching to join in the battle, but two are wiped out still on the launch pad. The third is annihilated while flying over Alpha, causing some internal damage inside Main Mission. The Hawks continue to blast the base. One of the base's end sections experiences explosive decompression, sucking three Alphans out into the space vacuum. The Hawks then move away to prepare for another assault wave. Koenig orders all non-essential personnel to escape to the deep shelters as Carter leads his fleet to engage in battle with the Hawks. Two of the Eagles are blown up, but Carter outmaneuvers the enemy, destroying two of their ships. However, Alan's Eagle is hit by debris, so he cuts the ship's power to ""play dead"" to give him some time to assess the ship's damage. The third Hawk heads back to Alpha on a strifing exercise, inflicting incredible damage, including decimating the base's Medical Department, sending Dr. Mathias (Anton Phillips) to his death through a shattered window. The lone Hawk then heads back toward the planet.

Sandra (Zienia Merton) alerts the Commander of a new contact; an enormous ship which dwarfs the Hawks, heading toward Moonbase Alpha. The mammoth ship's flight path takes it right into the firing sites of Carter's seemingly-dead Eagle, which Alan takes complete advantage of. The enemy craft is engulfed in an immense explosion from the Eagle's laser which rocks the base.

After Carter returns to base, Koenig convenes a meeting to hear the bad news. Reports state that there are 128 dead, and the base is unable to sustain life beyond eight days. Koenig decides that their only chance is to meet with the aliens and try to secure a place to live on the planet.

Commander Koenig and Helena Russell (Barbara Bain) travel to the alien world in an unarmed survey Eagle. Once the Eagle arrives near the alien's city, they lose contact with Alpha, then a voice announces that the ship has been brought under their control. The Eagle lands on a platform next to an elevator taking the Alphans down to the alien's control center. Two aliens materialize inside glass booths - one male and one female (Anthony Valentine, Isla Blair) - ordering the Alphans to state their case. Koenig and Helena explain why they're there, but the emotionless aliens refuse to allow the Earth people to live on the planet, who they regard as ""a contaminating organism, a plague of fear"". The Alphans learn that the war ships were created out of their own minds, and their own fears, and those fears would destroy the alien's world. The Alphans are to die on Moonbase Alpha. Koenig violently smashed some nearby equipment, causing the aliens to strike him dead with an energy weapon.

Meanwhile, the Alpha personnel are preparing to evacuate to the planet per Koenig's previous orders.

Helena has been ""entombed"" inside one of the alien's glass booths and is told not to be afraid. The aliens then share their amazing thought power with her, which carries out her wish that Koenig was alive. The Commander revives, then discovers there's a force field surrounding Helena's booth. He races to the Eagle to collect reinforcements. The aliens are aware of Koenig's plans. Helena's trapped inside her booth, but the aliens tell her that she's free to leave here if her mind can find a way.

Koenig docks his Eagle with Carter's, who was ahead of the evacuation group. Koenig takes control and speeds Carter's laser-equipped ship toward the planet. Enormous waves of energy emerge from the planet which plays havoc with the Eagle. Koenig and Carter eject as the ship is destroyed. Carter's lifeless body drifts away as Koenig floats through space, knowing he's next as soon as his suit's oxygen is depleted.

The aliens explain to Helena that they have created, over generations of time, an immortal mental force that they refer to as a ""brain"", in which they're all linked to. They have conquered their fears and all live in perfect harmony. They invite Helena into their ""brain"" and she too feels the bliss, but it also enables her to learn of Koenig's plight. She uses the power to cause Koenig to appear on the planet, and he finds himself once again in the alien's control room. He immediately fires his laser at the male alien's glass booth. It explodes, which causes a chain reaction through the whole building. Helena has been thrown from her booth, and as Koenig tends to her, there's destruction all around them which has spread through the planet itself. The entire alien world disrupts into a massive mushroom cloud...

We are brought back to the beginning as Carter is leading his Eagles toward the first set of Hawks. Whereas the first time, Koenig had given Carter the order to fire, this time he tells Alan to hold his fire. Koenig is just as surprised as the others to hear those words come out of his mouth. Suddenly, the three Hawks vanish. As the Alphans attempt to make sense of it, an alien voice rings out explaining that in a moment of time, the Alphans have been shown the consequences of a decision they hope the Alphans will not make. Nobody understands except for Helena. She remembers her experience on the planet. Koenig vaguely remembers, and realizes that the aliens pose no threat as long as their world is not approached."

After the Eagle docks with the gargantuan ""Spaceship Daria"", the team loses contact with Alpha, then their ship becomes unresponsive, leaving them stranded away from the Moonbase. Analysis of the Spaceship Daria's interior indicates a breathable atmosphere within and an operating power source somewhere inside. Life-signs are also confirmed. Victor explains that their communications have been disrupted by radiation that is saturated throughout the alien ship, but not powerful enough to harm them.

The team enters the Daria's reception area, revealing the interior to be in extreme disarray, showing evidence of the disaster on the recorded message. There are two open corridors traveling in different directions; Commander Koenig deciding for he and Victor follow one, and Carter and Morrow to follow the other one, while Helena and Lowry remain here. Koenig sets a time limit, ordering them all back here if they haven't made contact with the Darians by then.

Left alone in the reception area, Helena and Bill Lowry discover a doorway hidden behind debris and Lowry manages to get it open. As soon as they entered this debris-strewn area, they came face-to-face with a pair of bare-footed dwarf-sized humanoid aliens; one male and one female (Gerald Stadden, Jackie Horton), wearing rags, who have been running, with terrified looks on their faces. They seem incapable of speech. A large barbaric man (Robert Russell) in similar garb appears around a corner and clubs Lowry unconscious. This is obviously what the dwarves were running from.

Meanwhile, while traveling their chosen corridor, which is near pristine condition, Koenig and Bergman are suddenly ""gunned down"" by laser weapons wielded by a pair of tall silvery-suited beings wearing space helmets.

Carter and Morrow found their corridor impassable; debris completely blocking their way. When they returned to the reception area, they find that Helena and Lowry are nowhere in sight, but discover the male dwarf hiding in the Eagle. Even though he can't speak, he understands them. They manage to talk him into showing them where their missing people are.

As Helena, Lowry, and the female dwarf are being dragged through various dilapidated sections of the alien vessel by a large mob of barbarians (who can speak), Koenig revives inside a clean and functional area of the Spaceship Daria. A beautiful, well-dressed woman introduces herself as Kara (Joan Collins), Director of Reconstruction of the Daria. She explains that this vessel has been the victim of a nuclear disaster that took place nine-hundred years ago. She informs the Commander that the Alphans may be of assistance.

Carter and Morrow have been led to a vast jungle of mostly dead shrubs. Hiding among them, they observe a bizarre ritual being performed by the ragtag mob, with the three captives as the center of attention. The male dwarf who led them here then runs off in terror. Carter and Morrow witness a wild-eyed Darian (Aubrey Morris), seemingly equivalent to a priest beginning a ceremony which results in the female dwarf being declared a ""mutant"". She's locked inside a booth, then machinery is activated, followed by her body being consumed in a burst of light. The priest then turns to Lowry. Upon examination, the ""priest"" discovers that one of Lowry's fingers had been cut off at the knuckle, which was due to some type of accident years earlier. Lowry's declared a ""mutant"", resulting in him also being dematerialized inside the booth. A fear-stricken Helena is next to be examined, but the results are the priest declaring her to be ""clear"" and summons the spirits. An opening appears in the wall, allowing the entry of two suited figures (who resemble the pair that had incapacitated Koenig and Bergman) to take Helena away. Carter and Morrow finally come out of hiding and brawl with the aliens. One suited ""spirit"" is laid out stunned while the other one drags Helena through the large opening in the wall, which now begins to close back up. Carter is captured while Paul takes a diving leap through the closing wall, landing safely on the other side, now cut off from the barbarian mob.

Koenig has met Neman (Dennis Burgess), the Daria's Commander, who has explained that in another hundred years this ship will arrive at a virgin planet concluding a thousand-year journey. He asks Koenig for material aid to secure their people's survival for the next hundred years.

Within the barbarian's shrine, Carter is being beaten for incapacitating one of their ""spirits"". Suddenly Carter breaks free and seizes the suited Darian's weapon. He rips the helmet off of the ""spirit"" (Michael Boothe), revealing the man inside. He offers to bring the mob into the part of the ship where this man came from to prove that they are not spirits - just ordinary people like them - who have been deceiving them. Carter wins the mob over and forces the Darian to show them the way.

Victor Bergman has been given access to the Darian computer to assess the compatibility between the Darians and the Alphans; Koenig having been invited to evacuate the Moonbase personnel here where they will all pool their resources; the Alphans can raise families on this ship whose future generations will arrive at the new world at the end of the hundred-year journey. However, Victor stumbles upon a secret relating to the elite Darians' survival; exercising a form of cannibalism, using the nutrients of the bodies of others to survive (utilizing the disintegration chamber in the Shrine). They immediately confront Kara, who explains that when the disaster struck, only this section of the ship was shielded. The rest of their people had become barbaric mutants. Koenig and Bergman learn of the descendants of the original mutated survivors of the long-ago disaster who now occupy the ruins, who are supplying the executive Darians with their bodily needs. Kara explains that when they first discovered the mutants, they would've been overwhelmed by their numbers, but without revealing themselves, managed to teach them how to survive; even giving them a god (in the form of a mural of Neman in the shrine containing the disintegration chamber). Neman introduces Koenig and Bergman to their prized ""gene bank"" which will revitalize their race once the ship arrives at the new planet. He begs Koenig to go through with the evacuation of Alpha to ensure their survival for the next hundred years. Koenig intends to do nothing until the rest of his party is located.

As Carter is being led through the vast ship by the helpless suited Darian, Paul Morrow has been following the trail of the suited figure who had abducted Helena. He has arrived at the ship's operation center and ends up stunning a robed Darian he had confronted, who attempted to flee. Koenig and Bergman were right around the corner, finally meeting up with one of their missing party. After hearing of the recent events from Morrow, Koenig quietly confronts Kara, not wanting to alert the other Darians. Holding her at gun point with a hidden laser, he quietly promises that he'll tear this place apart unless she takes him to Helena.

Kara leads the three Alphans into a special room piled with bodies of the healthier survivors (who have been announced as ""clear"" as Helena had), who were brought here to have their organs harvested, which was how Kara and the rest of the fourteen executive Darians have lasted all these years. The next to be processed was Helena, lying on a table, her mind neutralized by a device over her forehead. Kara frantically revives her, then Koenig realizes this to be the real reason the Alphans were to evacuate to the Daria. Suddenly Neman shows up with two other Darians, holding the Alphans at gunpoint.

Carter has finally arrived at the Darians' operation center, sending the robed executives fleeing in terror at the sight of the barbaric survivors. Neman is alerted, who finds the leader of the barbarian tribe eyeing the gene bank with bad intent. Neman runs over to protect it from harm and ends up having his head smashed through the gene bank, destroying it and killing him. As an all-out slaughter is about to commence, Koenig jumps between them, lecturing them that either they work together or perish. He succeeds in the beginnings of a co-existence between the two factions before the Alphans return home."

Suddenly, Alpha's sensors trigger a collision alarm as the asteroid's direction had changed, as though it had been pulled off its course. With less than a minute before it'll impact right into the heart of Alpha, the asteroid changes course again, moving away from them. The asteroid then begins twisting out of shape, followed by it ceasing to exist. Paul Morrow (Prentis Hancock) informs Commander Koenig (Martin Landau) that sensors indicate the moon is now changing course. A view on the Big Screen is focused on something ahead of them on their new course; an enormous circular black entity with refracted light from behind it surrounding its rim.

Professor Bergman (Barry Morse) has retreated to his quarters to try and calculate the identity of this unusual space entity, with help from computer.

In the meantime, Commander Koenig has sent an Eagle out ahead of them to try and gain information. Pilot Mike Ryan (Paul Jones) - who's been seeing Sandra (Zienia Merton) - arrives at the point where the asteroid was first pulled off its course. He sends multiple radio signals toward the entity, but nothing's bouncing back; the signals are being absorbed by the huge black mass. As Ryan's holding his position, visual communication with the ship's pilot section is becoming covered with static. No fault is registering; it's as though the ship's power is being drawn. Ryan fires a laser beam into the object and that becomes absorbed by it as well. Against Koenig's advice, Ryan moves in closer to the object; determined to learn what it is, as Alpha is headed right for it. As Professor Bergman returns to Main Mission to report to Commander Koenig that he's discovered the object's identity, he arrives in time to witness Ryan's Eagle on the Big Screen being drawn toward the entity with no escape. The ship then begins bending and twisting out of shape as the asteroid had, before it blinks out of existence. Sandra faints.

The object is a black hole (termed ""black sun"" throughout the episode). Estimates indicate that Alpha has three more days of existence.

Using the eight towers surrounding the Moonbase which create the artificial gravity on Alpha, Professor Bergman has devised an anti-gravity forcefield which - when activated - should negate the gravitational power of the black hole to protect the base. If tests prove successful, it offers a slim hope of the Moonbase holding together once the moon enters the entity. To power the forcefield, the nuclear generators from the Eagles have been removed. Kano (Clifton Jones) is not pleased that Alpha's main computer will have to be deactivated when the anti-gravity screen is switched on to also aid in its powering.

Commander Koenig and Professor Bergman have travelled out to the lunar surface right under one of the gravity towers. The forcefield is activated for the first time, resembling a green dome of light covering the Moonbase. Alan Carter (Nick Tate), flying the one Eagle that has been left intact, moves in and fires a bolt of laser energy right above Koenig and Bergman. The forcefield repels the blast. Everyone celebrates, except for Helena (Barbara Bain), who berates the two Alphans for needlessly risking their lives in such a display. Koenig explains it was to boost morale.

Despite the results, Commander Koenig's faith in the forcefield saving them from the overwhelming force of the black hole is shaky at best, so he announces his plans for the one intact Eagle. It's to be a survival ship for six individuals - three women and three men - to be sent out into space equipped with six months of supplies in the hope that they'll find something in space that'll save their lives.

As the moon is drawn closer to the black hole, the base's interior is getting colder; the entity draining their power. When there are twelve hours left before the moon was previously calculated to be entering the black hole, computer readings indicate that there are actually six hours to go. The moon is being drawn towards it faster as it gets closer. Koenig decides to activate the forcefield immediately in the hope that it will slow the black sun's draw on the moon. Victor enters the base's power room to monitor the levels during the forcefield's operation. After it powers up, a glitch is detected in one of the towers. Bergman opens up a wall panel to check the circuits associated with the gravity towers and ends up getting zapped. The power is drained from his mechanical heart, incapacitating him.

While Victor recovers in the Medical Department, Helena informs him that his mechanical heart saved his life; anyone else would've been electrocuted.

The forcefield is now being repaired with less than four hours before the moon enters the black hole. The survival ship has been prepared and it is now time for the computer to choose the six passengers. It turns out that Alan Carter, Helena, and Sandra are among the crew. Helena refuses to go, but Koenig orders her to. As the ship lifts off, the forcefield is switched on.

With death a real possibility, the Alpha personnel find ways to pass the time; Koenig and Bergman becoming the only occupants of Main Mission. Victor breaks out a 50-year-old bottle of brandy for he and Koenig to indulge in to prepare for the end. ""Whatever happens, I just hope it's interesting"", Bergman remarking.

As the moon enters the black hole, the Alphans find themselves becoming transparent. Koenig observes his surroundings and realizes with astonishment that the forcefield is holding.

Even though the survival ship is out in space, the Eagle and its occupants have also become transparent. The ship's crew then fades out of existence.

Koenig and Bergman are suddenly surrounded by a shimmering light and no longer feel the biting cold of the Moonbase interior. Within moments they become eons old (it is unknown whether this had occurred to all of the Alphans or if Koenig and Bergman had been singled out). They cease to speak aloud but are able to hear one another's thoughts. The two Alphans are then contacted by a God-like female voice which engages in a brief philosophical conversation with Professor Bergman as to the existence of the universe. Bergman asks why she's never spoken with him before; the unseen being explaining that time moves much slowly for it; only thinking a thought perhaps every thousand years. Victor asks if she's God, but doesn't receive an answer as the voice has faded away.

Koenig and Bergman soon find themselves back to normal within an intact and fully functioning Main Mission. The forcefield has been deactivated (by persons unknown) and sensors indicate that the moon is surrounded by stars with the black hole nowhere in sight. Their current position in space is not known; they could be anywhere in the universe.

As the personnel are returning to normal routines, there's no sign of the survival ship. Suddenly, out of nowhere it shows up on Alpha's screens. Everyone is mystified at its appearance as it had not followed the moon into the black hole. Some of them are seriously starting to suspect a benevolent force has assisted them as the celebratory homecoming ensues."

When the Eagle is brought back to Alpha by remote control, in addition to pilots Parks and Bannion (Stuart Damon, John Oxley), an unfamiliar man is found aboard wearing a uniform not of Alpha design. This stranger is quickly identified when Helena (Barbara Bain) announces that it's her husband Lee (Richard Johnson), who has been presumed dead since his spaceship had disintegrated in Jupiter's gravity five years before the moon left Earth.

The three occupants of the reconnaissance ship have been placed in Alpha's care unit, hooked up to medical monitors. All three remain unconscious, but unlike Parks and Bannion, the medical instruments are failing to record Russell's life signs. Dr. Mathias (Anton Phillips) is baffled, and Helena has no answers.

In the meantime, Alpha's personnel are becoming impatient with the sudden delay in investigating the planet for possible colonization. Commander Koenig (Martin Landau) insists that their first priority at this point is to try and come up with answers as to what happened with the reconnaissance Eagle, as well as Lee Russell's inexplicable appearance.

While Helena tends to Lee alone, he partially revives, struggling to get something out. However, he remains too weak to speak.

Prof. Bergman (Barry Morse) speculates that Lee's physical nature has undergone a radical change since presumably residing on the planet for the past five years, resulting in their instruments being unable to record his vital signs. Desperate for answers, Koenig convinces Helena to administer Lee with a powerful stimulant to revive him for interrogation. Once awakened, Russell insists on speaking with his wife alone. After the others depart, Helena gives Lee an update on their travels through space and current hope of settling on the planet. Lee suddenly becomes alarmed to hear this, and finally seems eager to provide information, placing his hands on her shoulders. However, the physical contact between the two causes an electrical discharge which throws Helena across the room, rendering her unconscious.

As Helena lay in bed, recovering in her quarters, Bergman brings Koenig into his quarters for a private discussion. He shows the Commander the results of three thermographic scans he's taken of Lee Russell; two of which display the thermal image of a normal living person, that had been taken when Helena was present. But the third scan, taken in Helena's absence, shows the image of a dead person, lacking any body heat. Victor concludes that Lee seems to be drawing his life force from Helena.

Meanwhile, in the care unit, as Parks and Bannion continue to lay unconscious, Lee rises out of bed. Dr. Mathias enters and tries to get Russell to lay back down. Lee insists on talking with Helena and becomes violent when Mathias persists with trying to restrain him. Russell throws Mathias into a display of medical supplies, leading to security guards holding Russell down.

Finally, Koenig finds himself with the opportunity to interrogate Russell. He had ordered Helena to stay away from her husband, so now he can question the man with no distractions. Lee warns the Alphans to avoid the planet or face annihilation. Koenig insists on knowing what the danger is and Lee simply answers ""your opposite"". Koenig expresses his insistence on sending down a landing party to determine whether the planet can support them. Lee realizes his warnings will not be heeded, and loses all of his energy, slumping into a chair. Dr. Mathias announces that he's dead.

Koenig's gung-ho with assembling the landing party, believing Lee Russell's presence no longer has any bearing on them now. However, Victor forcefully persuades the Commander to hold off on the launch until after he's had time to perform some skin tests on Russell's body. Koenig reluctantly relents.

With time suddenly on his hands, Koenig visits Helena to see how Russell's death has affected her. She calmly states that she's just ""numb"", as though she never really had him back.

The results of Lee Russell's skin tests, according to the particle analyzer, indicates that since his death, his cells have been changing, reversing polarity. Victor believes that his body is transforming into antimatter, which will lead to annihilation once completed. Koenig stresses that these are just theories and is insistent on seeing with his own eyes whether that planet is habitable.

Commander Koenig conducts a base-wide announcement informing the Alphans that the landing party is about to depart and to prepare for evacuation once he gives the word. Victor is left in command of the Moonbase, with instructions to retain command if for some reason the landing party doesn't make it back. As the countdown to launch is under way, Victor worriedly informs the Commander that as Lee Russell's autopsy was being prepared, his body suddenly vanished. Bergman urges Koenig to abort the launch due to Lee Russell's warning, but the Commander remains determined to follow through with the probe of the planet.

The Eagle lands, containing the Commander, Helena, Alan Carter, Paul Morrow (Prentis Hancock), and Sandra (Zienia Merton). The planet appears as a paradise, with breathable air, trees, grass, and animal life in the form of docile parrots. Koenig orders Carter to remain on the ship while the others split into two pairs to conduct surveys.

The Commander and Dr. Russell come across a large orange-colored water hole and set up their testing equipment. When the water, as well as some nearby fruit, pass the tests with flying colors, Koenig and Helena send a live video to the elated Alphans in Main Mission of the two sampling the planet's spoils. Koenig contacts Paul and Sandra for an update, and they report not finding any dangerous elements so far.

As John and Helena continue to pack away collected plant samples, Victor interrupts their bliss with grim news; all of Alpha's atmosphere seals are weakening (apparently, the planet has a very extended atmosphere), and the plastics aboard their Eagle are being affected. Koenig contacts Carter for an update, who reports that the ship's insulation is beginning to act up a bit.

As Koenig abruptly recalls the landing party, Victor reports that Alpha's situation continues to worsen. Koenig hustles Paul and Sandra to hurry back to the Eagle, then checks back with Carter in mid-stride. The comm-lock view screen shows Carter trapped in the ship's pilot section surrounded in smoke. Alan urgently reports that the ship's systems are failing. As Koenig informs him they're on their way, a nearby explosion occurs. It turns out that Paul's holstered laser has exploded. As Koenig hastily disposes of the rest of their lasers, Helena informs him that Paul is dead. As they both react with shock, Sandra hysterically announces that she's blind. They're within view of the Eagle, which Koenig observes to be billowing in smoke. The ship explodes.

While Koenig attempts to achieve contact with Alpha; receiving distorted sound and visuals on his comm-lock, Helena frantically tries to draw his attention to the sky. The moon, which seems to be engulfed by the planet's orange atmosphere, is being shrouded by a white energy field. This leads to their moon violently exploding.

When the shock wave from the moon's demise reaches the planet's surface, a fierce dust storm ensues. Helena and Koenig lose sight of Sandra while attempting to seek shelter, but their cries are drowned out by the wind. They then stumble up to a cliff-side, and become victim to a rock-slide. Koenig protects Helena and ends up getting pummeled. Finally, as the storm subsided, Koenig lay on the ground and perishes.

As Helena sits on a rock sobbing, in utter anguish, Lee suddenly appears. He explains to the distraught Helena how he had originally arrived here, as well as what he has become; his material ""opposite"". He states that she cannot survive here and must leave. Obviously she can't under the current circumstances, so he endows her with the power to ""see what she wants to see"". Lee then disappears and the planet returns to the paradise it had been when the Eagle landed. Koenig approaches Helena, alive and well. They both possess the memory of the horrifying events. Koenig recalls the landing party."

Commander Koenig (Martin Landau) insists that it's scientifically impossible, but Simmonds contends that the ""impossible"" simply takes a little longer. The argument is broken up when Alpha's sensors detect an ""unidentified powered object"" approaching the base which the computer reports is manned.

Two Eagles are sent out to intercept the craft; Alan Carter (Nick Tate), piloting one one them, reporting to Main Mission that the approaching vessel is on a collision course with the moon. However, at the last minute, the ship fires retro rockets, initiating a hard landing in the lunar soil. Kano (Clifton Jones) reports that there are no life readings within it.

Koenig assembles a boarding party consisting of himself, Dr. Russell (Barbara Bain), Professor Bergman (Barry Morse) and a security guard - named Tony (Tony Allyn). Simmonds is miffed that Koenig had omitted him from the team. Victor believes that the alien ship was not on a random course; it had seeked them out.

Carter transports the party to the oddly-shaped alien vessel, where the Eagle successfully docks with the spacecraft. Once secured, Alan separates the Eagle's passenger module, leaving it on the lunar surface while he returns the rest of the ship back to the base.

Kano informs the Commander that the alien ship's interior contains no atmosphere and has lunar gravity. The party enters the docking tube and they manage to manipulate a control panel on the alien ship's exterior, gaining entry. Inside, they find six transparent compartments, each containing a humanoid alien body. Using the Eagle's control systems, the alien craft is given atmosphere and artificial gravity. As the Alphans observe the prone robed aliens, Commander Koenig sends the security guard back into the Eagle to round up lights and the rest of Dr. Russell's medical equipment. Helena studies the read-outs of their hand-held sensors, confirming their earlier readings of no life-signs. She surmises that if the aliens had been in suspended animation, the crash may have killed them.

The next scientific step is to exhume one of the bodies. However, as soon as the chosen compartment is penetrated by the drilling tool, the body within is enveloped in light, then becomes a pile of ash. Some sort of alarm sounds, followed by flashing lights all around them. The Alphan trio watches in amazement as the remaining five bodies simultaneously come to life, all sitting up within their sealed compartments. Panels slide open in each container; the five figures slowly exiting their ""sleep chambers"". The long-haired robed aliens, who tower over the Alphans, slowly circle around the Alphan group; the apparent leader gazing from the charred remains of his deceased comrade to the wary Alphans.

Breaking the silence, Koenig and Helena explain that only when they were certain that no life existed did they compromise the seal on the compartment in question. The lead alien (Christopher Lee) silently begins a death ritual, drawing everyone - including the Alphans - into forming a circle around the remains of their fallen comrade, then folding their arms in apparent prayer.

Though the alien ship is currently running on half-power due to certain systems failures resulting from the rough landing, the aliens manage to fly it onto a launch pad to enable them to conduct the repairs within one of Alpha's Eagle bays.

As Commander Koenig leads the alien party through the Moonbase, having arranged quarters for them, Commissioner Simmonds blocks their way, insisting that Koenig formerly introduce him to the aliens, throwing his weight around as the base's representative of Earth authority. Simmonds then diplomatically assures their leader, Captain Zantor, that the parties responsible for the death of their crew member will be held accountable. Zantor informs him that the Alphan party had acted out of ignorance - not malice, so judicial revenge will not be necessary.

Later, Koenig convenes a meeting within his office with the Kaldoreans, along with Dr. Russell, Professor Bergman and Simmonds (who had invited himself). Captain Zantor explains that their home world - Kaldor - was dying; all of its life-forms having become sterile. Their people then sent out many ships such as theirs, each one targeting a planet that they know can support them in the hope that they be granted asylum where they can spend the remainder of their days in peace. Their ship had been traveling approximately three and a half centuries, programmed to orbit Earth's moon - where they would re-animate and prepare to reach their destination - Earth. In the event that they were not welcome there, they were prepared to take their own lives. However, when their ship had encountered the moon sooner than was expected, it caused their computer to err, resulting in the crash-landing. Koenig finds it remarkable that the computer had found the moon at all. Zantor states that it merely did what it was programmed to do. The aliens plan to continue their journey to Earth once their repairs are completed. Helena arranges to conduct tests to learn whether the Kaldorean race is physically compatible with those of Earth.

In private, Sinmonds reveals his true colors to Koenig. He suggests that they seize the aliens' ship so six of them can go home; regarding the Kaldoreans as expendable.

While Helena conducts her tests on Captain Zantor, he explains that their brand of suspended animation differs from the inferior Cryogenic variety; their procedure holding their bodies' cells in stasis, perfectly preserving them. Helena declares the Kaldoreans to be sufficiently human, recommending that they complete their voyage to Earth, which will take seventy-five years. Zantor then points out that there's a vacant space on his ship for one Alphan.

Meanwhile, Simmonds continues to try and convince Koenig to seize the aliens' ship. The Commander informs the Commissioner that Alpha's computer will select the one Alphan to join the Kaldoreans on the journey to Earth once he's convinced that the suspended animation process will work on humans.

Helena has volunteered to be Captain Zantor's guinea pig with the suspended animation tests. During the procedure, Koenig is urgently summoned to the alien spaceship. Captain Zantor explains that Helena has been put into a deeper ""sleep"" than was intended, warning the disgruntled Commander that re-animating a subject from such a deep sleep could result in cell damage to the brain. The error has derived from Zantor accepting information from Alpha's computer regarding the human ""spirit"", but it turns out that it doesn't seem to have understood it, as the Kaldoreans' computer is capable. With much struggling, Zantor eventually managed to revive Helena with no side-effects.

Commissioner Simmonds again confronts Koenig, insisting that he allow him to join the aliens on their journey to Earth, especially as he has no function here on Alpha. Koenig would love to get rid of him, but informs the Commissioner that he'll have to take his chances along with the rest.

With the repairs finally completed on the alien ship, Helena and Captain Zantor meet with the Commander to assure him that their suspended animation procedure will work on humans. They explain that the Kaldorean computer will have to outline a complete matrix of its human subject. It's presently set up for Helena, but will have to be reconfigured for the individual who Alpha's computer chooses. At the start of the discussion, Simmonds had deviously swapped his commlock with Koenig's and has snuck away. With the countdown to launch now underway, Koenig instructs Kano to have the computer choose the lucky Alphan.

Simmonds has acquired a laser, using it and Koenig's commlock to gain access to Alpha's Power Station. Removing the tube-like power converter from its housing, Simmonds succeeds in shutting down the entire base. As no one will survive beyond the next thirty minutes, Simmonds attempts to blackmail Koenig into allowing him to join the Kaldoreans back to Earth. Koenig points out that Alpha's computer has yet to release the name of the chosen Alphan, but Simmonds states that he's been a politician all of his life and doesn't believe in chance. He demands that Koenig give him what he wants, or Alpha freezes over.

When Captain Zantor learns of the present situation, he volunteers himself to be Simmonds' hostage, agreeing to take him to Earth, for the sake of Alpha.

Koenig, Helena, and Bergman bid Captain Zantor farewell, then the ship launches with the six occupants in suspended animation.

A few hours later, Commander Koenig is alerted that they're receiving a communication from the Kaldorean ship. It seems that Simmonds has ""awakened"" and is attempting to contact Earth, apparently thinking he's arrived there.

Frustrated at the lack of response from his hails, Simmonds - the only crew member who has revived from stasis - is hitting buttons on his commlock, discovering to his horror that he's still within communication range of Moonbase Alpha, and that they've only been traveling a few hours. He contacts Alpha, desperately requesting that Koenig send out an Eagle to retrieve him.

In Main Mission, the Alphans helplessly leave Simmonds' pleas unanswered, as the ship is too far out into space to conduct a rescue. Victor correctly surmises that the distrusting Simmonds neglected to give Zantor a chance to have the Kaldorean computer outline a matrix for him, resulting in the failure of his suspended animation.

Within his sealed compartment on the alien ship, Simmonds frantically thrashes about in vain, trying to break out of his chamber. Using up his air, he collapses within his ""coffin"".

Out of curiosity, Helena asks Koenig who the computer had chosen to join the Kaldoreans, becoming astonished to learn that it was Simmonds."

The Alphans have come across a very habitable planet that they've named ""Retha"" (an anagram of Earth). Eagle Six is sent to Retha with seven passengers to conduct feasibility studies of colonizing the planet. However, Moonbase Alpha has mysteriously lost contact with the landing party, who haven't checked in for the past two hours. Commander Koenig orders the ship to be brought back to Alpha by remote control, and the only occupant found aboard is the dead body of what appears to be a Cro Magnon man dressed in animal skins.

Professor Bergman is left in charge of the base while Koenig leads a search party on the planet's jungle-covered surface. Meanwhile, Alan Carter and Sandra Benes are conducting a low altitude aerial search in Eagle Two.

The Commander and Helena Russell are leading the ground search party in a Moonbuggy, attempting to locate the trail of electronic markers left by the Eagle Six crew, while the rest of the party are following Koenig's path on foot. When the Moonbuggy arrives at one of the missing party's markers, Koenig and Helena switch to foot travel. They eventually arrive at a swamp and find footprints of a huge reptilian creature while the shrieking of a smaller animal can be heard hiding among bushes. Koenig adds a fresh marker to the one left by the original landing party, then the pair moves on.

While the rest of the search party arrives at the resting Moonbuggy, continuing to follow the Commander's trail, Koenig and Helena have arrived at a swirling patch of thick mist between two large outcrops of rock. The trail of the Eagle Six crew leads straight into it, so the pair enters it intrepidly.

When night falls, Carter contacts Alpha, reporting that he's lost contact with the landing party. Bergman informs him that they have also. Carter's last message was from the support party following Koenig's trail into an area of mist. Bergman informs Alan that the night will last about two hours, so Carter decides to land the ship and resume the search at daybreak. He ""parks"" his ship next to the search party's empty Eagle.

After sunrise, Sandra awakens to find that Alan has left the Eagle. She contacts him on her commlock and he explains that he's having a look around. He's just reached the Moonbuggy and he's following the electronic markers. After Sandra signs off, Alan manages to fall into a sizable animal trap and loses consciousness.

Meanwhile, Professor Bergman and Kano have commandeered an Eagle to try and learn the whereabouts of the two missing landing parties.

When Carter awakens at the bottom of the large pit, he witnesses a trio of stone-aged figures observing him from the ground above. One of them, armed with a spear, jumps into the pit and engages in battle with Carter. Alan is unable to draw his laser while attempting to counteract the caveman's movements. The battle ends with Carter again losing consciousness after being violently slammed onto the ground. As the Spearman is about to finish Carter off with his weapon, he's suddenly distracted by the beeping of the commlock lying on the ground. He picks up the device, accidentally activating audio contact. Sandra's face appears on the small screen, enthralling the caveman. After receiving no vocal response to her monologue, Sandra fearfully deactivates her device. The screen goes blank on Carter's commlock, so the Spearman signals to his comrades, who lower a large branch into the pit for him to climb out.

Eagle Three has just entered the planet's orbit, so Bergman informs Sandra - who has updated the list of the missing to include Carter - that their ETA is ten minutes. While she begins to prepare a meal for the newcomers, Alan again revives at the bottom of the pit. This time, he has a way out, as the Cro Magnons had left the tree branch.

In the Eagle, Sandra opens the ship's exterior door, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Bergman's ship. However, she finds herself standing face-to-face with the Spearman, who recognizes her from the commlock. A chase ensues inside the ship before the Spearman renders her unconscious and carries her home.

Eagle Three lands as Carter hops into the Moonbuggy to race it back to the landing site. Bergman and Kano find Sandra's ship empty, but there are signs of a struggle all around.

Inside a series of caves, the Cro Magnon tribe has retired as night has fallen again. Fire pits and torches provide some light inside the caverns. The Spearman enters with an unconscious Sandra over his shoulders, which draws the attention of the group. A fight breaks out between the Spearman and the leader of the tribe, as the spectators react with a series of grunts. This time, the Spearman is not the victor, having lost possession of Sandra to the Tribe Chief, whose mate responds with violent jealousy. After the defeated Spearman scurries away, the now-conscious Sandra retreats to a remote recess in the cavern, terrified.

Out in the dark wilderness, Bergman, Kano, and Carter are stationed silently around their camp sight, Alan disgruntled to have to wait until daybreak before searching for Sandra.

Meanwhile, the Cave Chief and his mate have approached Sandra with a flaming torch to get a better look at her, and in the improved lighting, Sandra suddenly realizes that the pair bears an uncanny resemblance to Commander Koenig and Helena Russell. She lets out a loud shriek, then shakenly tries to communicate with the pair. She realizes they're unable to speak. Later on, when the rest of the cave people are asleep, the Spearman approaches Sandra with an animal skin for her to put on, determined for her to become his mate. Sandra's unresponsive, so the impatient Spearman rips her uniform open, since she won't remove it herself. She screams, awakening the surrounding sleepers, causing the Cave Chief to resume battle with the Spearman. The Chief (who's apparently a bigamist) once again defeats the Spearman and forces Sandra to don the animal skin. When he notices her medical monitor (which resembles a wristwatch that all Alphans wear), he reaches for it. Sandra swiftly picks up a heavy rock with both hands, repeatedly slamming it into the Chief's head. Now unconscious with blood on his face, which also spattered onto her discarded uniform, Sandra finally has the opportunity to flee the caves. When the Chief's mate learns what had just transpired, she becomes a blood-thirsty animal. Sandra has escaped outside, making a bare-footed break for it in terror as some of the tribe have emerged from the caves in pursuit.

At daybreak, the Alphan trio hops into the Moonbuggy to search for their people. Following the markers, Kano - who's driving - is about to plow the vehicle into the cloud of mist, causing Carter to yell for him to stop. He explains that everyone who has entered the mist have never been heard from again. Bergman suggests they abandon the Moonbuggy and make their way around the area, avoiding the mist.

Within the caves, the primitive tribe are all chanting, swaying in unison, performing their version of funeral service, preparing to bury their dying Chief, apparently while he's still breathing. They're disrupted by the voices of the approaching Alphans who have found the cave entrance located near the backside of the mist, causing the tribe to flee, abandoning the dying Chief. Victor observes the severely injured caveman, who then starts to attack. After Victor prevents Alan from destroying him with a laser, the Chief runs out of the cave. Kano picks up Sandra's blood-spattered uniform off the ground, which sets Carter off. He grabs a lit torch with one hand while holding his laser with the other, disappearing into the deeper caverns. Victor informs Kano that he thinks he recognized the injured caveman as the Commander, so the two race outside to find out, back the way they came.

Meanwhile, the tribe scouts have located Sandra, who had fallen asleep after cowering behind a large tree.

The two Alphans find Koenig unconscious by the moonbuggy, right in front of the cloud of mist that he'd apparently just emerged from, wearing his usual uniform, but suffering a huge contusion on his forehead. After Koenig revives on Moonbase, he learns that the autopsy performed on the body found on Eagle Six proves him to have been a Cro Magnon, but caps on his teeth lead to further tests. It turns out that he was the pilot of Eagle Six. When Koenig realizes that the other cave people could also be Alphans, Victor becomes alarmed, explaining about Carter vengefully searching for Sandra with a laser. Despite his condition, Koenig jumps out of bed and heads for an Eagle. Victor and Kano follow.

In the meantime, the Cave Chief's grave will soon contain a different body. Sandra's been bound to a primitively-made vertical rack used to dry fresh animal skins, surrounded by the tribe who will witness her public execution by the vengeful Cave Helena.

While Koenig's ship lands on the planet, Carter has finally located Sandra in one of the caverns. On a landing overlooking the bloodthirsty tribe, he observes that the Chief's mate is about to do away with Sandra with a sharp wooden stake. The fear-stricken Alphan notices Carter in the shadows, who motions for her not to give him away. Alan has his laser aimed right at the Cave Helena as the three Alphans suddenly pile into the cave. Koenig notices Carter and stuns him to prevent anyone from getting hurt. They manage to take Sandra outside, where they use tactics to force the attacking cavemen back into the mist. They re-emerge as their Alphan selves.

Back on Alpha, the landing party members are examined, but fortunately no side-effects are found."

It sent a burst of orange light which flashed about Clifford's head. When the light vanished, Clifford stood upright and blank-faced, walking zombie-like to the computer terminals on the opposite side of the room. Several personnel observed Clifford - who was not known for his computer expertise - using both hands to punch the keys on the keypad panel on the wall with lightning speed. Clifford exhibited superhuman strength; subduing Kano, and then Paul Morrow when they tried to physically remove him from the computer panel. As Clifford resumed his manic keypad-punching, Commander Koenig exited his office, observed Clifford's unusual actions, and attempted to restrain him. Koenig ended up pinned to the wall by Clifford's hand around his throat. Clifford then let go, displaying a look of intense pain on his face. He asked the Alphans to help him before collapsing dead on the floor. Suddenly, the moon became the victim of a sudden jolt, almost knocking the personnel off their feet. Unseen by the Alphans, the gargantuan sphere had enveloped the entire moon in a powerful orange beam. The Alphans finally realized their predicament as a whispering alien voice contacted them, informing them that they are the captives of the planet Triton.

The Alphans are unable to contact the sphere, then Paul Morrow announces that there are scattered localized power losses throughout the base. Also, all but four of their Eagles are mysteriously damaged, leaving them defenseless.

It is learned that Ted Clifford had been transmitting classified information to the sphere. Commander Koenig decides to send out an Eagle to their visitors. Professor Bergman doubts they'll arrive unnoticed; believing they're being watched.

Commander Koenig visits Medical to learn the results of Ted Clifford's autopsy. Helena and Dr. Mathias describe seeing a weak pulsating ball of orange light at the base of his brain and cerebellum which then faded away. There was very little brain tissue left to examine; it had melted. Parts of his brain, including the cerebrum, had become enlarged and were performing at a thousand times their normal speed before his death, which enabled him to see and act as though he were a computer.

Carter and co-Pilot Donovan fly an Eagle toward the sphere, which sends out a beam of orange light, engulfing the ship and sending it flailing back to the lunar surface where it crashes.

The ship had only landed about seven hundred meters from the base, but due to rough terrain, a moonbuggy would be unable to make it there. Koenig leads a rescue team, including Helena, on foot toward the crash site. As they're traversing, Dr. Mathias informs the Commander that Donovan is dead but Carter is still alive. Paul Morrow then reports to Koenig that the base's scanner systems have all gone dead, possibly indicating an oncoming attack. Suddenly a ball of orange light forms around Helena's space helmet. Koenig runs toward her, but is knocked roughly to the lunar surface by the aliens' powerful force. Helena's entire body becomes surrounded by orange light, then she vanishes.

When the Commander revives within the Medical Department, Victor informs him that the aliens have abducted Helena.

Koenig and Alan Carter commandeer an Eagle, equipped with a modified anti-gravity shield which will hopefully counteract the alien's forcefield beam. Predictably, a beam of orange light is sent out toward the ship, but the anti-gravity shield proves effective. However, the beam is retracted and the forcefield reverses, sending the Eagle speeding toward the sphere. G-forces pin the two Alphans to their seats, but manage to cut the power to the ship's engines as they both become incapacitated. The Eagle is brought back to Alpha by remote-control.

Meanwhile, Alpha has a new arrival; Helena materializes in a ball of orange light outside one of their airlocks, still wearing her spacesuit.

Dr. Mathias examines Helena, finding her unharmed with the exception of her optic nerve; tests indicate she should be blind, but she obviously isn't. Helena suspects that some of her functions are under the aliens' control. As Helena's explaining her experiences aboard the alien sphere - not seeing any actual beings, only communicating with the same voice they had all heard in Main Mission - she suddenly becomes briefly enveloped in orange light, then starts behaving as Ted Clifford had. She walks toward the room's closed door, then dematerializes. She instantaneously appears in a corridor, then enters Main Mission. When she begins speed-typing into the keypad on the wall panel, Kano informs Commander Koenig that she's transmitting detailed information to the sphere regarding their life-support system. A minute later, Helena stops typing, temporarily released from the aliens' control.

After Helena's been taken over several times in this manner, Victor points out that it would seem that their people are transmitting information because the aliens are unable to leave their sphere. Taking into account Helena's experience within the alien vessel, Koenig suspects that there are no alien beings, only an intelligence. He becomes determined to board their ship.

Dr. Mathias has summoned Koenig and Bergman, explaining that one of Helena's recent medical scans has detected a ball of orange light within her brain - a stronger form than had been found within Clifford. Bergman realizes that the aliens needed to bring Helena aboard the sphere for it to be implanted, which was why it didn't work with Ted Clifford. Mathias warns Koenig that at the rate the aliens have been using Helena, her body won't last too much longer.

Victor has been researching the aliens' origin. Using the computer, current star charts, and a past incident where ancient astronomers recorded evidence of a supernova in the night sky, Bergman comes to believe that the planet Triton no longer exists. Koenig becomes hopeful that if the aliens were made aware of this fact, they may release Helena.

Kano has found a way to jam computer - which should deactivate the forcefield surrounding the moon - just long enough for an Eagle to be safely sent to the sphere.

As soon as Helena's reactivated again by the aliens and begins transmitting more information to the sphere, Koenig lifts off his Eagle which also contains Alan Carter and four security men. As the ship approached the sphere, the usual beam of light is sent toward the Eagle. Koenig orders Kano to start the computer jamming process, which immediately releases Helena as well as the moon itself. The Eagle flies freely into the sphere, which seems to be made of light. Ironically, it appears pitch black inside the sphere.

Kano sets up the computer's memory banks with the only data that Helena will be able to transmit to the sphere.

The Eagle lands on some type of surface and there's a breathable atmosphere outside the ship. Koenig then leads the security team out into the darkness.

Meanwhile, Alpha's computer has just succeeded in clearing the jam Kano had set up, which reactivates Helena. She resumes with her manic high-speed typing.

Koenig is suddenly enveloped in orange light and transported to the aliens' control center. The whispering voice informs him that they were aware that Alpha's computer would be jammed and had allowed the Eagle to arrive here so Koenig could receive the brain implant; also knowing that Helena's not going to last much longer. The alien intelligence also informs the Commander that their current mission is to learn everything they can about Earth man to prepare for Earth's eventual invasion of their planet, despite the two worlds residing countless light years apart.

Using the information that Helena had been set up to transmit, Commander Koenig successfully convinces the aliens that Triton no longer exists, making their mission obsolete.

Koenig finds himself once again at the Eagle, so he hustles the security team back inside. They hastily lift off as the sphere begins to break up. The aliens destroy themselves as the ship returns to Alpha.

Helena is examined and found to be back to normal, with no sign of the alien implant."

Ricky and Lucy continue singing and are surprised to receive a phone call from Ethel, telling them to be quiet. Although puzzled by her about-face attitude, Lucy and Ricky decide it's time for bed.

Lucy likes the bedroom window to be open but Ricky prefers it closed. They argue about it, loudly opening and closing the window, and Ethel calls again. She and Fred are trying to sleep.

The losers of the bet must each pay the other two $50 if they are the first pair to slip up and use a modern convenience. Ricky objects when Lucy wants to use her oven, but relents when Lucy tries to fill the oven with wood to burn like back into the day.

Lucy makes Ricky take a bath in a tub she put in the kitchen from water heated on the stove. Ethel tries to make butter but was trying to churn milk instead of cream. After Lucy corrects her, Ethel comes back with a pound of freshly churned butter that she says only cost her $23.

Lucy tries to make bread. Her dough contains 13 cloves of yeast. Ethel reads the recipe and corrects Lucy by telling her that she only needed 3 cloves. Lucy replies that she'll just bake a few more loaves and won't have to bake for a couple of weeks.

Once she lets the dough rise, Lucy finds that she needs to put it in a larger bowl. An hour later, the dough is so much larger that she and Ethel barely can lift it into an even larger bowl. Finally, Lucy puts the large clump of dough onto a cookie sheet and pops it in the preheated oven.

Later when Lucy returns, she wonders why the oven door is slightly ajar. When she opens the door, an 18 foot loaf of bread pushes out and pins her against the sink!

Lucy and Ethel dress in turn-of-the-century clothes and expect to win the bet if they can catch Ricky returning from work in a cab, off the bus or from the subway. He rides up on a horse! Lucy insists that Ricky and Fred wear old clothes too, figuring that the girls can win because Ricky won't walk in public dressed in the old clothes. Ricky says he'll make it part of a publicity stunt for a new 1890's skit at the club. Fred comes in singing in his old duds. Lucy asks why Fred is so happy. Ethel explains that he likes those clothes. Fred says that it reminds him of when he was young and gay.

A telegram arrives that informs Lucy and Ethel that they are invited to be interviewed for a high class women's social club on Friday. Lucy wants to visit her salon to have her hair and nails done, but realizes that she will lose the bet if she does. A knock on the door turns out to be a surprise visit by two of the social club's interviewers. They have come unannounced to see how Lucy really lives while Fred, Ethel, Ricky and Lucy are dressed in their outdated clothes. The women call Lucy's kitchen ""primitive,"" and Ricky comes to Lucy's aid by saying that they are rehearsing for his club. One of the women ask why he does it. He replies that he has a bad habit of eating. So she concludes that they are show people.

The social club woman says that they have strict standards against show people. The other social club woman corrects her by saying that they have made allowances last year when they needed money. Lucy speaks up and says that she has been evaluating the social club and would not join a club that has disdain for show people. Fred, Ethel and Ricky cheer her, and Ricky says that he will pay the bet so that they can all go out to eat. Lucy says that they can only go after they eat a slice of her bread. She brings out a 2 square feet by 6 inches thick slice of her loaf with Ethel's butter on it. The four then bite all at once into the huge slice of bread."

Ricky is about to do a television show and is about to head to an rehearsal when he receives a phone call from his agent saying he must find a girl to do a commercial slated to air during the show. Lucy overhears the conversation and ask Ricky if she could be in the commercial only to be met with a prompt rejection. Soon after Ricky leaves, Fred (William Frawley) shows up seeing some work needs to be done in the Ricardos' apartment due to the absent Ethel (Vivian Vance). Lucy explains to Fred about the television opportunity and enlist his help in her scheme, SHOW Ricky how wonderful she could be in the commercial. The plan backfires when Ricky plugs in the television set and nearly electrocutes Lucy. Ricky then becomes angry when he discovers she took out the chasie for the tv piece by piece instead of one piece, making for an expensive repair. With the couple not speaking, Ricky phones Fred to come to the apartment and relay a phone message for him to the girl he hired to do the commercial. Lucy overhears Fred and Ricky's conversation and once Ricky leaves, dismisses Fred, making it seem as though the couple IS speaking and covers up for overhearing the conversation by saying the location and time of the rehearsal is the same for all of Ricky's programs. Fred leaves and soon after, the actress phones and Lucy tells her that the role had be recast. It's later that afternoon and we are now a rehearsal for the commercial. The director and script clerk are discussing the product, a new tonic called Vitameatavegamin and discover it contains everything but the kitchen sink including 23% alcohol. Lucy comes out to do a rehearsal and, having never tasted the product before, has a less than desirable facial reaction for the director's liking. After several attempts and run throughs, each a big disaster then the one before with the star fumbling her lines with each taste and becoming more intoxicated, Lucy finally acquires a taste for the tonic and the alcohol content. After noticing his star has become aloof and out of sorts, the director becomes concerned, asking if she will be well enough to do the live taping for the commercial and invited her to rest until showtime. The moment of truth finally has arrived and the only problem is, the star of the commercial is no where to be found. Ricky is called to start the program and after an introduction to the show, burst into a song. Mid song, a now hungover Lucy is seen stumbling backstage and cast an adoring gaze at her husband from the wings and stumbles on stage to show some affection to her still singing man. Ricky resumes singing only to be joined by Lucy who sings nothing but jibberish and uses her time to say hi to her best friends, Fred and Ethel, and even does her tv commercial spot, slurred words and all. A mortified Ricky carries her offstage, fearing for the worse that his career is now over."

In a house, a young man has his way with a woman, but notices bite marks on her thighs. She tells him a vampire offered her $1,000 once to let him bite her. He wants to know what it's like. She says it was way too rough. He's about to leave when she tells him she video taped it.

Back at the restaurant, Tara and Sookie talk to Sam the owner. He has a crush on Sookie. She's distracted when a mysterious man walks in and the lights dim. It's clear that he's a vampire. Sookie goes to wait on him, flirting and giggling to have her first vamp since they ""came out of the coffin"" two years ago. A slimy couple sitting nearby ooze over to talk to the vampire, hot for him.

Back at the house, the young man watches the vampire sex tape as the woman keeps him occupied. The vampire starts to shape shift.

At the bar, Sookie hears the thoughts of the couple planning to drain the vampire of blood. She wants to stop them, but they disappear with him. She runs out after them. She grabs a length of chain from the back of a truck, vigilante waitress.

At the house o' sex, the man is ravishing the woman, calling her dirty vampire-sex related names. He wraps his hands around her neck as a camera records everything, throttling her as he finishes.

Outside the bar, the couple has pinned the vamp to the ground and is draining him. He sees Sookie coming up. She whacks the man with the chain and it wraps around his neck. She runs the woman off with a knife as she threatens to kill Sookie.

Sookie lets the vampire up, slowly lifting the small silver chain that held him in place, burned into his flesh. A dog runs up and licks Sookie. She thinks the vampire is not happy to have been rescued by a woman. She tries to hear what he's thinking and is excited to realize she can't. He offers her his blood, to sell or drink (it makes humans feel healthier and improves their sex lives), but she declines, since she has no sex life to speak of. He's intrigued. His name is Bill. She thinks it's funny he has such a normal name. She says good-bye and goes back to work.

Sam is waiting for her, nervous. Tara wants a job, but he doesn't want her to run off his customers. She bargains with him as it being a way to watch out for Sookie. He agrees.

Sex boy walks in -- turns out he's Sookie's brother, Jason. Tara flirts hello but he's not interested. On the other hand, he's excited to see another waitress, Dawn. She turns him down but he follows her out.

Sookie goes home and tells her grandmother about the vampire that came into the bar. She goes to bed but wakes up in the middle of the night. She looks out the window and sees Bill standing on her lawn. She puts on a robe and goes out to see him, like any young girl would when finding a strange blood-sucker on her lawn. He's gone when she gets out there but then reappears behind her. She says hello and he starts undressing. She says she never thought she'd be having sex with him. ""Who said anything about sex?"" he says menacingly. And then she wakes up.

The next day, she's sunning on the lawn when her brother Jason walks up, having heard about what the Rattrays pulled last night. When he learns she was defending a vampire he warns her to stay away from their kind. He checks to make sure it's not the one from the sex tape, not bald, no tattoos.

Inside, Grandma gets a call that Maudette Pickens has been found strangled in her own home. Jason reacts like it might be the woman he was with last night. He calls her a ""fang banger,"" someone who likes to have sex with vampires. They wants to know why he knows that. He fills them in on vampire hookers. And then says good-bye to his grandmother.

Sookie walks over to him and tries to listen in. She hears: ""How could this be happening to me, how could I lose control?"" before he realizes what she's doing and stops her.

He sits on a lawn chair later, at work supervising on a road crew. On the phone, he tries to talk Dawn into meeting up with him later when two sheriff's deputies pull up. They ask him about Maudette. He denies knowing her or knowing that she was murdered. Then he says he did know. He denies ever having been there, but then says he was there last night. They ask about the nature of the sex, but then tell him they've already seen the tape. They ask him to come with them.

At Sookie's house, her grandmother wants her to invite the vampire to come talk about the Civil War at the library. Sookie promises to ask him if he ever comes in again.

At the bar, Tara is giving a customer lip when Lafayette tells her Jason was arrested. Dawn tells Sookie, who isn't pleased to be the last to know. Dawn starts to say they figured she'd know, but stops. Sookie angrily blurts that she's not psychic and storms off.

Sookie finds two guys from the road crew in the bar and asks what happened. They tell her.

She turns around and sees Bill. In hear head she hears Tara judge her, Sam thinking that he wants to protect her and customers mock her as she floats over to say hi. He takes her hand and the voices silence. He asks her what she is. She tells him again, a waitress. But he says she's something more than human. He asks if he can call on her. She says she has a favor to ask for her grandmother. They make plans to meet after work. He scoots closer and asks if she realizes that every person in there is staring at them. She doesn't care what they think. He says he's going to make Bon Temps his home, so he cares. He walks away and the voices resume.

Sam grabs her arm and takes her to the back room, telling her not to act like a vigilante. He makes her cry, which has the added benefit of meaning he gets to comfort her. She hears his dirty thoughts and then Tara busts in, reading her the same riot act. She tells them she's a grown woman and can make her own decisions. After work at Merlotte's, she waits for Bill. She hears a noise in the woods and goes to investigate -- and it's the Rattrays. They knock her down and start kicking her, violently. As the episode ends, Sookie lays there, helpless and bloody."

Something swoops across the night, picking them off her. A hand reaches down to pull her to her feet.

At the sheriff's station, Jason watches the end of his sex tape with Maudette in which he chokes her and runs out when he realizes what he's done. He starts to cry watching it but then the tape keeps playing. She opens her eyes and laughs, calling him a moron. He's excited to learn he didn't kill her. He suggests it was a vampire.

Bill carries Sookie through the woods.

Jason describes the vampire he saw on Maudette's sex tape. But Jason's tape was the only one they found. The vampire was bald and crazy and tattooed.

Bill carries Sookie to the river, she's in bad shape. He bites open his wrist and tells her to drink. She asks if it'll make her a vampire. He says no, but to do it if she wants to live. She drinks, lustily.

Tara goes home to find her mom passed out on the couch. (A gossip mag has a headline that says Angelina adopts vampire baby.) Tara calls Lafayette to come get her.

Dawn wakes up to loud knocking on her door. Its a very traumatized Jason. He tells Dawn what happened, looking for comfort in one woman's arms after having nearly killed another during sex. But she goes along with it.

At the riverbank, Bill asks Sookie again what she is. She tells him she can hear people's thoughts, but not his. She tells him it's peaceful. She tells him she doesn't date and flashes back to dates where hearing a man's thoughts ruined it. She tells Bill only the people closest to her know. He leans in but she says she should be getting home. She notices she feels completely healed. Doctors don't know that v-juice can do that.

Tara sits on a couch by herself while Lafayette, her cousin, works the crowd. A man tries to pick her up, but she makes up a story about her husband being a mercenary just back from Iraq.

At Dawn's house, she's consoling Jason using the booty method following his recent brush with the law, knocking over things and shrieking a lot.

Bill and Sookie walk chastely down a moonlit street. He was made a vampire in 1865 when he was 30. He was in the Civil War. She asks him if he'd speak to her grandmother's group. He asks if it would make her happy. She says yes. He asks again to call on her. She's off work tomorrow, she'll see him just after dark. Bill disappears.

Jason wakes up in bed next to Dawn, who now has her shirt off. He sees bite marks on her chest and isn't happy about it.

Sookie watches a shouting news program between a Reverend and a woman from the American Vampire League. Her grandmother comes in and they decide Jesus wouldn't mind if someone was a vampire. Sookie eats sausage, tasting more flavors in it than usual. She describes it to her grandmother, who seems to know what happened. Tara comes in, demanding info on her vampire date. Jason comes in in time to hear grandma's news: a tornado turned over a trailer. The one where the Rattrays lived. They were crushed to death.

Sookie drives over there. The trailer is demolished. A van pulls up, and it's the sheriff and the coroner, the one who buried her parents. The sheriff has heard she didn't like the Rattrays much. He also tells her about the vampire living in the old Compton place across the field from her house. He says no one heard anything like a tornado.

Sookie comes home to her grandmother cleaning. She smells rotten food and finds a tiny crumb under the chair. Gran tells Sookie that Jason and Tara are coming over that night to meet the vampire, too.

Later, Bill sneaks up to Sookie on the porch. She has to invite him in before he can enter. She does. As he greets everyone, Jason stuffs his face and stares him down. Bill talks about where he's from. He says he came back because the last of his Compton line died and he's living in their old place. He says he expects the vampire rights act to pass. Jason gives him some vampire prejudice. Tara asks if he owned slaves. He didn't, but his father did. He charms Gran with stories of the olden days.

Bill asks Sookie to go for a walk. Jason tries to forbid her, but Gran shuts him down.

Outside, Sookie tells him she went to the Rattrays' trailer. He says that vampires get stronger over time and learn to cover their tracks. She asks if he ever killed anyone. Yes, by accident. He says he fed on the Rattrays because she drank a lot of his blood. She asks what it'll do to her. She'll have heightened senses, a stronger libido and he'll be able to sense her, especially if she's in trouble.

At the house, Tara cozies up to Jason, talking about wanting to be seen and to matter. They snuggle on the couch and Jason remembers he was supposed to pick up Dawn from work.

Walking through a graveyard, Bill tells Sookie about glamoring people, which is sort of like hypnosis. She wants him to try on her. She goads him into it. He looks deep into her eyes, trying to take hold of her thoughts. She busts up laughing. He has no effect on her. Usually people are more squeamish about vampires, he says. Who is she to be squeamish about something out of the ordinary? She flashes back to her childhood, hearing her mom thoughts as she worries about bills and then getting talked to by a teacher who is resolved to disprove she can read minds. She hears her mom anxious thoughts about her, being scared by her. She tells Bill they diagnosed her with ADD. He asks when she lost them. When she was eight, in a flash flood. He talks about losing his wife and children after he turned.

She quizzes him on his skills. He can't levitate, change form or turn invisible.

They stare deeply at each other, she lets her hair down. He nuzzles her neck and soon it's a vampire-human make-out. But he pushes her away, his fangs out. He tries to calm down and says he'd better walk her home.

Jason lays tied up in Dawn's bed as she gets ready for work. He quickly realizes she plans to leave him like that.

At the bar, a woman orders another drink from Tara, who tells her off and then talks her way out of wearing a uniform.

Sookie waits on four rude guys who think lewd things. The road crew guy runs them off. Sam asks to talk to Sookie in his office and asks her about reading people's thoughts. He says she should read his sometime. She says she doesn't want to; she's had to quit every job she's ever had because she could read her boss' thoughts.

Tara asks Dawn about Jason, in a way that doesn't come across as completely innocent.

Sookie sees something on the news about the anti-Vampire Reverend and his wife having been killed in a car accident. She drives to Bill's house. There's a car with a license plate that says FANGS 1 out front. Two creepy vampires meet her at the door and the bad tattooed guy from the sex tape sneaks up behind her. They bare their fangs and hiss."

She surprises them by asking if they're trying to glamour her. When the dark-haired male vampire admits they are, she tells them it doesn't work on her. They're taken aback; a voice from inside calls them off.

There are two other people lounging around on couches inside Bill's house. One, a woman who looks like she's been fed on (we find out later shes called Janella), and a shirtless man named Jerry. Bill is sitting in a shadowed corner.

Dianne, a vampire that Malcolm (the dark-haired vampire) mentions once had sex with Bill, says Sookie smells like a virgin, and virgins have the best tasting blood. After babies, adds Liam (the tattooed vampire from Maudettes sex tape).

They're about to bite into her neck when Bill shouts for them to stop. ""Sookie's mine.""

The male vampires start engaging with their sex/blood slaves. Malcolm offers Bill some of Jerry. Bill is closing in to bite Jerry, when Sookie hears Jerry's thoughts. He's daring Bill to take a gulp and catch his ""Hep D."" She stops Bill just in time. Dianne asks if shes the only one who wants to know how Sookie knew about Jerry's infection, but before she's answered, Bill runs them off.

Bill tells Sookie he's sorry she had to see that.

Sookie asks what Hep D is. Bill explains that its a hepatitis mutation that makes vampires weak for a month, which puts them at greater risk for getting staked.

Sookie's offended that Bill claimed her as his. He explains that he did it to protect her. If he hadn't, they would have seen her as fair game and he wouldn't have been able to fight them off, especially Malcolm, who is much older than Bill. So, sort of chivalrous.

Sookies grossed out that Bill had sex with Dianne. He says it was back in the 1930s, just after Dianne was turned.

Bill tells Sookie the three vampires are mean and vicious because they live together in a nest. Vampires that live alone, like him, are more likely to retain some amount of humanity.

He asks to kiss her good-night and she immediately says, ""No! I couldn't stand it after them.""

At the bar, Tara stays after and talks to Sam. She tells him about Bill stopping by last night. She tells him he's only got himself to blame for not initiating a romantic relationship with Sookie. Sam asks Tara why she never started anything with Jason, but Tara changes the subject back to Sam.

When Sam tells Tara that Sookie told him that she can't hear Bill's thoughts, Tara suddenly understands his appeal and tells Sam that, unfortunately, he doesn't stand a chance.

Dawn goes home, eager to untie Jason. But he's not on the bed. A masked man grabs her from behind and growls at her. She starts to freak out as he paws at her, but then she gets into it when she thinks it's a vampire. He says he drained the guy she left tied up and thanks her for it, while he gropes her some more. Then the man takes the stocking off of his face, revealing himself to be Jason. Dawn's mad at first, but quickly forgives him and shows him - using her lady parts.

Sookie drives home, freaked out and sad.

She walks up to her porch and Bill appears. She yells at him for popping up again. He says he just wanted to make sure she was safe.

She asks him why she can't hear her thoughts. He guesses it's because he doesn't have brainwaves and then talks about the magic that keeps him alive.

Sookie says they should stop seeing each other. When Bill asks why she says because his friends tried to eat her, and vampires killed the preacher and his family. He says that Sookie will never find a human man she can be herself with. She turns and goes inside.

Tara hangs out at Sams house, not wanting to go home to her passed-out drunk mother. They bond over booze. She asks him why he doesn't have a girlfriend. Sam says he has a hard time opening up. Tara starts quizzing him about sex. They trade ""how long it's been"" stories. He goes for more drinks and she takes her hair down and follows him inside. She matter-of-factly suggests they have sex. Sam says no, that it's a terrible idea. She's his employee. Then he thinks about it

He tells her if things got weird he'd have to fire her. Tara's fine with that. It's a deal.

Back to Jason and Dawn - doing what they do best. Jason is romping away like crazy when he suddenly pictures Liam beneath him. The mood is killed. He tells Dawn he's creeped out that she had sex with a vampire. She's not ashamed, but he thinks she should be. She says it was the best sex she ever had. Jason's clearly jealous.

He gives her enough grief that Dawn tells him to leave. When he refuses, she goes in the other room for a cigarette but comes back with a gun. She runs Jason off, pants half-on, by shooting at her floor.

A neighbor sees Jason leave.

At Bill's house, someone sneaks up behind him and he whirls around, fangs bared. It's Sookie.

She confesses awkwardly that she's never been with a man before but feels drawn to him and even though it might be a mistake she wants to get it out of the way so she can relax and get some sleep. ""Just don't bite me, OK?"" she says. Bill kisses her and starts to take her clothes off.

Sookie wakes up, alone, in her own bed.

Jason comes home and chugs a beer. He turns on the TV and everything is vampire programming.

Dianne, Liam, and Malcolm are hanging out at their nest, plotting their next feeding. Bill knocks at the door. He tells them to stay away from him and Sookie. They tell him not everyone wants to play human. ""Honey, if we can't kill people, what's the point of being a vampire?"", says Malcolm, the elder of the group.

Bill threatens to go to a higher power, someone (named Eric) who outranks Malcolm [also mentioned is an as-yet unnamed female vampire who outranks Eric]. He warns them again and leaves.

Sam wakes up alone.

Tara walks in her house and gets whacked on the back of the head by a Bible-wielding drunk mother who scolds her for staying out all night. Tara insults her mom and then feels bad, moving in to help her off the floor. Her mom whacks her again, this time with a liquor bottle.

Tara tells her she's on her own and leaves.

Sookie takes her pent-up frustrations out on the lawn, pushing the mower. Her grandmother brings her some fresh-squeezed lemonade. Sensing Sookies feeling anxious, Gran asks her if the vampire did something untoward. Sookie tells her grandmother how shes feeling in her head, versus her loin. From the edge of the yard, the dog watches over Sookie.

Tara goes to Lafayette's house. Inspecting her head wound, he doesn't think she needs stitches. He gives her two Vicodin, a shot of liquor, and some weed to take the pain away. Lafayette's date, a scrawny white dude who tries to pull off the name ""Duke,"" leaves, vaguely saying he left the money on the nightstand. ""He's a state senator,"" Lafayette says after the man leaves.

Tara tells Lafayette she slept with Sam, and that Sam barks in his sleep.

On his front porch, Sam is reading the paper and discovers that Marthaville is getting a Starbucks. He wonders out loud if he should buy a cappuccino machine as the dog runs up to him. He tells the dog what he really wants in Marthaville is a vampire killer to take care of Mr. Bill Compton.

In Gran's kitchen, Sookie also reads in the paper that Marthaville is getting a Starbucks. She asks her grandmother if she should keep seeing Bill. Gran says he's polite and handsome. Sookie says he scares her. Not that he'd hurt her, but that she doesn't know what he's thinking.

Gran tells Sookie her grandfather used to know things about people, personal things, that they would have never told anyone. She tells Sookie about him stopping his brother from killing himself, somehow knowing what the brother was about to do. Then Sookie remembers her great-uncle did kill himself, with a shotgun. Gran waves the statement off, saying that was years later.

Jason visits Lafayette, in search of Viagra. Lafayette says he doesn't have any (Viagra's legal), but he does have something that would have the same effect, only better. Unlike Viagra, Lafayettes impotency-fighter is $600 for a ¼ of an ounce. It's vampire blood (a.k.a. V or V-juice). Lafayette explains he has a deal with a vampire, trading booty for blood.

Lafayette warns Jason not to take more than a drop at a time or it'll be too intense. Jason asks if he can just bring the money later, as he gets up to leave. Lafayette grabs Jason and tells him theres nothing free. Apparently in trade for the V, we see Jason dancing around for Lafayette's video camera wearing only his underpants and a Laura Bush mask. Tara, clearly shocked, watches from another room.

Sookie goes to Bill's house during the daytime. She walks around a bit and finally sits on his front steps. All the colors in the trees seem very intense and, apparently, turn her on. Her cell phone rings, shaking her back to reality. It's Sam asking her to go by Dawn's and wake her up. Dawn's late for her shift and Sam thinks she probably overslept.

Sookie goes to Dawn's, walking in when no one answers the door. Inside, the alarm clock is going off. Sookie finds Dawn is in bed, clearly dead. Sookie screams."

The neighbor who saw him running away the night before comes over and accuses Jason, who denies he had anything to do with it. They call the police.

Outside, neighbors gossip, excited that something has happened. Sookie talks to the sheriff, saying the door was open when she got there. She hears Jason wondering how he's going to get out of the mess, he's too pretty to go to prison. Detective Andy Bellefleur interviews the neighbor, Mrs. Lafeve, who recounts the fight. He leads Jason away in handcuffs like he was the last man to sleep with two women who are now dead, i.e. bashing him into stuff. As Andy leaves Jason in the backseat to wait, Jason realizes he has a vial of highly illegal vampire blood on him. He chugs the whole thing.

Sam joins Sookie on the steps, saying he's sorry she found Dawn. He asks her if he should shut down the bar. ""All that'd do is deny people a good stiff drink when they need it most,"" she says. A cop asks Sam for keys to Dawn's storage locker since he was her landlord. Sookie watches the coroner bring out Dawn's body.

At the station, sheriff Bud and detective Andy are trying to trip up Jason. It's working. They've got him saying he found the body. He becomes distracted by a swelling in his pants. He rushes like a 13-year-old boy to the restroom trying to, uh, deal with it. Andy and the sheriff discuss, the sheriff doesn't think Jason did it. Jason seems to resolve his issue, but screams in pain as he does so. Andy and the sheriff go to investigate. As they knock on the door, Tara storms in and gives Jason an alibi, saying he was with her. They let him go.

Sookie goes to visit Gran, who implores her to listen to people's thoughts to find out who might really be responsible.

Working at Merlotte's, Sookie hears all sorts of dirty thoughts and judgments. Arlene is peeved at Dawn for inconveniently dying on them. She says it wouldn't have happened if Dawn didn't spend her nights at the vampire bar in Shreveport.

Tara arrives late and Sam wants to talk about last night. She tells him to forget about it because she told the police she was with Jason. (Presumably trying to put the fact he barked like a dog in his sleep out of her mind.)

Meanwhile, at home, Jason is tending to his crotch problem, which keeps coming back with a vengeance. It also seems to have done something to him that he finds distressing.

At Merlotte's, Sookie thanks Hoyt Fortenberry for being the only person in the bar not thinking nasty things about Dawn. Jason comes in, still distressed. Sookie asks him point blank if he killed Dawn. He says no and rushes off to see Lafayette for input on his record-setting manhood triumph.

Lafayette tells him there's nothing he can do.

Bill comes in. Arlene waits on him, rudely, not giving him what he wants. Sookie fixes it and brings him the Tru Blood he likes. She takes him outside to tell him about Dawn. She wants to know about the vampire bar in Shreveport. He knows it. It's called Fangtasia. (He reminds her vampires are old and puns used to be he highest form of humor.) She asks him to take her, but clarifies it's not a date. Sookie tells Sam why she wants to leave early. They have a tedious conversation about separate but equal as Sam rails against vampires.

In the car, Sookie has worn a bosomy dress for her non-date. She asks Bill what he's thinking. He tells her she looks like vampire bait. She tries to find the compliment in it.

Tara brings food into the walk-in fridge and finds Jason with a steak on his privates. He shows her his issue and she insists they go to a hospital to deal with whats medically known as priapism.

At Fangtasia, Sookie thinks the red walls and leather-clad crowd make it look like a Disneyland version of a vampire bar. Several of the vamps recognize Bill. Sookie shows the bartender, Longshadow, pictures of Maudette and Dawn. He says they both had been there. He says Maudette wanted to die. Sookie notices a blond, longhaired man in the corner. She asks who it is. Eric, the oldest thing in there.

At the hospital, the doctor inspecting Jason's pants tent asks Jason if he's taken any drugs. He vehemently dies it. The doctor wants to drain the blood out of Jason's manpart. Tara wants to leave but Jason puppy-dog eyes her to stay. The doctor pops Jason's tent.

Back at Merlotte's, Arlene asks Sam to walk her to her car. Sam says sure, and stuffs a latex glove in his pocket. We see a picture of him with Dawn at the bar.

Back at Fangtasia, Sookie hears 100 different versions of people hoping to get laid. Bill sees Eric is about to summon them. He does. They have no choice but to go over. Eric says he heard that Bill was ""mainstreaming."" Eric tells Sookie if she has questions she should ask him. She shows him the pictures. He says one offered herself to him, but he found her too pathetic. The other one, he tasted. When Sookie mouths off to him, Bill gets nervous, gripping her hand. Sookie hears an undercover cop wondering where his back-up is. She warns them, adding that a woman is feeding on the man who Eric kicked earlier. When Eric asks how she knows, Bill shakes his head at her to keep quiet. She does, just as the cops storm in.

Bill whisks her off and Eric also escapes.

Tara drives a very spent Jason home, remembering a time when they were kids when Jason protected her from her drunk mom on a rampage. She smiles at the thought, apparently over that whole draining-Jason's-penis thing.

Bill drives Sookie home. She asks him to pull over, she needs a few minutes of quiet. As they're about to kiss, a cop pulls up. He asks if they were at Fangtasia. He asks if he can shine his light on Sookie's neck. He does and Bill shows him his fangs. The cop pulls out his gun. Bill glamours him into giving him his gun. He points it at the cop, giving him etiquette lessons. The audience is hit over the head with a driving-while-black analogy. Bill tells the man he's going to keep his gun. Sookie is freaked out. After they drive off, the cop pees down his leg.

Sam, wearing latex gloves, uses his keys to get into Dawn's house. He looks around her bedroom, smelling her sheets. He buries his face in her pillow and writhes on her bed because, hey, everybody grieves differently."

She lectures him about threatening police officers, telling him that's not very good mainstreaming. Neither, she notes, is hosting orgies. Chastened, he says he won't call on her again.

From the bushes, the ever-present dog watches.

Lafayette gets up to loud knocking on his door. It's Tara, yelling at him for dealing V. She says giving Jason V is like giving H- Hos to a diabetic.

Gran listens to someone on the phone ranting about Jason. She tells Sookie that everyone is excited about meeting the town vampire that night. Sookie tells Gran that Bill isn't all that nice. She says she doesn't think they have much in common. He doesn't think or feel like they do. The phone rings again. Gran doesn't answer.

Jason recreates his procedure for Lafayette using a sausage and a meat thermometer. He tells Lafayette to stop dealing V. He says Tara will be damaged forever, but Lafayette tells him her enduring love for Jason will help her get over it. It's news to oblivious Jason. Jaosn swears off V but Lafayette says if Jason can learn to control it, it might open him up to everything around him. Lafayette brings out his V kit and waxes poetic about its powers. He drips blood drops on squares of tissue as Jason watches, rapt. Lafayette says it's from a new vampire. He can feel him in his muscles, making him strong. He says it might affect Jason differently. Jason takes a square and puts it in his mouth, having sworn off vampire drugs for less than a full day.

At Merlotte's, Sam eavesdrops on Sookie telling Arlene that she won't be going out with Bill again. Seizing his moment, Sam asks Sookie to go to Bill's talk with him that night. Sookie sees everyone staring and says yes. Andy Belflour asks Sookie about Tara and Jason. When she says there's nothing going on, she hears Andy's suspicions about Tara lying confirmed, swearing in his head about it. When Sookie tells him to watch his mouth he realizes she heard it and the rumors about her must be true.

Sookie goes to find Tara, who tells her about giving Jason an alibi. Sookie asks Tara if there's something else she's not telling her. Sookie tries to listen in, but hears Tara going la,la,la,la. Sookie tries to resell Tara and Jason to Andy, who knows she's lying. She tells him if he's going to accuse her, he should at least do it outloud, leaving Andy dumbfounded.

At the church, the town waits to hear from Bill. Rene and Arlene show up, as does the mayor, sheriff Bud and Andy. Bill waits in the dark, drinking the Tru Blood Gran gave him. Hoyt tries to remove the cross on stage, just in case. Sookie arrives with Sam and they sit next to Tara.

Jason wanders around outside, seeing the world for the first time while hopped on V. Jason comes in and sits next to Tara. He tells her he's feeling strong and alive.

Gran introduces Bill, saying his family was among the first to settle in Bon Temps. Bill comes out. The first thing he does is remove the flag Hoyt's mom draped over the cross, returning it to its flagpole. He teaches the crowd a thing or two about vampires, that they can stand before crosses and in churches. He tells them they can coexist. Then he talks about serving in the infantry in 1862. Andy and Bud pontificate on Bill's guilt. Jason hears Bill's talk in 3D. Sookie sees three goof-offs in the audience crush garlic.

In the back, Hoyt empties the fridge and takes a whiff of the Tru Blood, curious.

A man in the audience asks Bill if he remembers his great-grandfather who was in the 28th. Bill says they fought together and Tolliver Humphries was a brave man.

Flashback to a battlefield, as Bill tried to stop Tolliver from rescuing an injured young soldier, only to be shot down. The boy lived. In the audience, Andy's cousin Terry, an Iraq war vet, seems affected by the battlefield tales. Mayor Norris asks a question. He shows Bill a tintype he found inscribed W. T. Compton and family. Bill looks at it. It's his family. He last saw them when he left for war. Rene asks why he couldn't go back to his family after he became a vampire. Bill says it wouldn't have been possible. Bill gets choked up and Sookie seems moved. (He dabs blood away from his eyes.) Terry finds Bills after and hugs him, vet to vet, telling him to stay strong. Mrs. Foytenberry asks for a picture. Sookie congratulates Bill and Sam gets possessive, putting his arm around her.

At Merlotte's, Hoyt, Jason and Rene shares drinks. Jason looks at Tara and sees a veritable Venus de Milo goddess. He goes over to her and touches her arm, saying the sparks feel like he's peeing on an electric fence. From this terribly romantic declaration she deduces he's high again. He acknowledges he is, but then says he's realized how he feels about her. She tells him to come to her when he's sober. He takes her hand and asks for one chance. She seems to consider it.

Over coffee, Sam asks her if she has listened to his thoughts. She says that unlike with other people, from him she just gets odd sounds. She asks him why no one knows anything about him. He continues to be generally charming.

Arlene brings Lafayette back a burger ordered by the three rabble-rousers from the church. They sent it back saying it might have AIDS. He confronts the idiots, dumping the food in their laps.

Leaving the coffee shop, Sam says hes glad Sookie can't hear his thoughts because she'd know what was coming. He kisses her. He asks if he's going to fast. She says its too soon since.... Sam puts it together and is upset when she says she kissed Bill. He gets angrier, pinning her against the car and saying there's nothing he won't do to keep Bill from hurting her. She says they're not like humans, they can turn on you. Sookie points out he's doing a pretty good job of that himself. She storms back into the restaurant and says she'll call a cab.

Hoyt goes to talk to a randy divorcee. She rubs on him and he walks away, thinking about her offer to come home with him. He tries some Tru Blood, served at 98 degrees, and finds it nasty. He succeeds in alienating the chick when she sees him with it.

Bill goes home and sees his late family on his porch. Andy and sheriff Bud show up, asking to speak with him. He's surprised to hear Andy's last name Belleflour. He invites them in and offers them a Fresca.

Bill says he didn't know Maudette, but had seen Dawn. They ask him for an alibi. He asks them if the girls were exsanguinated and tells them no vampire would have left those women with a drop in them.

Flashback to Bill stumbling through the dark during the war, knocking on a cottage door asking for help. He breaks in and a woman puts a rifle to his head. Then she feeds him. He says he look a shortcut but got lost. She's the widow of a colonel Gibson. She wipes the blood off Bill and suggest he spend the night. She goes into kiss him and he pulls away, saying he has a wife waiting. She says he's an honorable man but the others haven't always been. He thanks her again but says he wants to leave. She cuts him off at the door, fangs bared. She feasts. He wakes up in bed with puncture wounds in his neck, the prim widow sitting over him and the corpses of the others laying around. She climbs on top of him and cuts her throat, telling him he has to drink if he wants to live. He does and she says he's hers.

He returns to his home as the vampire tells him he can't ever go in and that his family is as good as dead. He cries a bloody tear.

Tara takes the trash out and hears panting. He finds Jason on the ground with the divorcee bent over in front of him. He graciously invites Tara to join them. Tara can't believe what she's seeing and douses them both in the garbage she's carrying. Unfazed, they continue.

Sookie stands, barefoot, in shock. Bill comes up behind her and grabs her, trying to calm her. As he holds onto her, someone enters the front of the house. It's Sam. Bill grabs him by the throat. He says he was making sure Sookie got home safe, the door was open. He sees the blood and asks what happened.

Sam puts a blanket around her shoulders and suggests she go upstairs and lie down. Sookie hears Andy Bellefleur with the other police from the kitchen, disturbed and saying the Stackhouse kids, while crazy, didn't deserve this. He thinks they have a serial killer.

Sookie goes outside for air. Sam follows her and sits next to her on the porch. She hears him saying he's so, so sorry in a way that sounds more like lust than sympathy. She tells him some other time and asks what happened to Bill.

Sam goes to get him from inside.

Sam tells Bill to stay away from her. Bill says Sookie doesn't take kindly to people telling her what to do. Sam says he doesn't need Bill to tell him about her; he's known her a long, long time.

Sam says Gran would be alive if it weren't for Bill. He tells Bill if anything ever happens to Sookie, he'll stake him.

Bill notices the screen in the window is slashed.

Down in the kitchen, the coroner notes Gran put up a hell of a fight. Andy thinks Jason might have done it. The sheriff thinks Gran might have upset someone by having ""Vampire Bill"" in the church.

The sheriff has questions for Bill. He got there right after Sookie found the body. He heard a car from his place.

Bill thinks whoever did this is targeting women who associate with vampires. He doesn't think Adele was the intended victim.

Outside, Sookie realizes she should call Jason. Sam volunteers to do it for her. Jason's cell phone rings as he sleeps in bed with his latest conquest. He partially awakens and groggily hurls the phone through the window.

The coroner brings out the body. Sookie says she's staying in the house. She hears the thoughts of the coroner's young assistant, hoping that she doesn't recognize him from the vampire bar. The sheriff thinks she's lucky it wasn't her and that she's next.

Bill has to leave. It's almost dawn.

Sookie sends Sam for the mop so she can clean up. She wipes up her grandmothers blood, on her hands and knees in the kitchen.

The next day neighbors come with food and gossip. Mrs. Fortenberry brings tuna and cheese casserole and Sookie hears that she's disappointed to have missed seeing the blood.

A few moments later, Sookie snaps at her when she sees Mrs. Fortenberry moving a pie Gran made. Everyone judges Sookie, some thinking she did it and most thinking she's crazy.

Tara and Lafayette take her upstairs for some quiet. Sookie doesn't know what shes going to do. She's numb. Tara tells her to quit worrying about being appropriate.

Sookie can't block the voices out. Lafayette gives her a valium for later.

Jason drives to work, late. He's still feeling the after-effects of the V. Rene and Hoyt realize he doesn't know.

Sookie talks to Tara about Bill, and how she got through last night because of him.

Enter Jason who angrily storms up the stairs and busts into Sookies room, slapping her across the face. He says it should have been Sookie and it's her fault because she's sleeping with a vampire.

Tara intervenes, yelling at him and shoving him out of the room.

Andy stops Jason outside, asking him where he was last night. People gather on the porch to watch. When Jason realizes what Andy's accusing him of, he shoves him into his truck, with V-juiced super strength. The gossiping resumes downstairs and Tara comes down to run everyone off, including Sam.

Tara and Lafayette eat leftovers downstairs while Sookie rests upstairs.

She wakes up with hands around her throat, strangling her. She cries out for Bill, who wakes up, hearing her. But he can't come for her because it's daylight. When it's night, he busts into her house and runs upstairs, shaking her. She wakes up. She's fine.

He promises he'll watch over her. He stands outside on the lawn, drinking Tru Blood. The friendly dog strolls up and joins him.

At Adele's funeral, Jason sits next to Sookie and the town people listen. Sookie sees an elderly man being wheeled up by Jason. It's her Uncle Bartlett. Sookie asks him what he's doing there, saying he hasn't been part of the family for a long time. Jason tells her to give him a break.

Sookie says a few words about her grandmother, who she describes as everything to her. The gathered masses judge her, saying it's her fault Adele is dead and it should be her. As the voices continue Sookie yells at them, telling them to ""shut the f--- up!"" This doesn't exactly stop the noise. Sookie runs off.

Tara's drunk mother gets up to say something. Tara worries, but she holds it together and says Adele took care of Tara when she couldn't.

Jason catches up with Sookie. He apologizes, but Sookie is furious Jason invited Uncle Bartlett. He says whatever his problems were, family forgives each other. She says he has no idea what he's talking about. He says they're all each other has. She says they have nothing.

Tara accosts her mother after the service. She doesn't seem to remember beating Tara with a bottle. Tara says she had no right to speak for Adele. She reminds her mom of all the bad things she's done, her mom says it wasn't her, but her demon. Tara laughs at her. Her mother begs for a second chance, she wants to get the demon out of her, but it's expensive. Tara walks away.

Sookie strolls through the gravestones and finds one marked William Thomas Compton.

Jason, sweating and disturbed, tries to hold it together as the mourners leave. He gets in his truck and takes out another square of V. He throws it out the window, then thinks twice and gets out to look for it. He can't find it.

Sookie watches Adele's coffin as it's lowered into the ground. Sam joins her. He says he liked the part of her speech where she told the whole town to shut the F*** up. He offers to walk her home.

At her house she suggest she take a bath while he finds them a movie to watch. She tells him she needs to be alone.

As he walks away he runs into Tara coming up the drive. Neither of them want to be alone.

In her kitchen, Sookie takes out her grandmother's pecan pie. She mourns as she eats it, crying over each pecan bite.

Tara takes Sam to the motel where she's staying. She offers him a warm beer. He tries to talk to her, but she is rude and snide. He gets up to leave but she asks him to stay. He says he wants something real in his life. ""If we do this, we really did this,"" he tells her. They kiss.

At Sookie's, the pie is gone.

When it's dark out she runs out of her house in her nightgown. Bill opens his door, sensing her coming. They run to each other and start kissing.

Tara and Sam finish and the afterglow lasts for mere seconds before Tara jumps up, dresses, and says she has to go.

Meanwhile, Jason is being ridden by some woman, who says she loves him. This is how he mourns. He starts to cry.

At Bill's, with candles lit, they sit on the floor and go slowly. She brings out the vampire in him as his fangs emerge, but she pulls him close to kiss her.

Tara goes to see her mother.

When they finish, they take a bath. He sets her straight on some vampire myths: they can reflect in mirrors, crucifixes do nothing. She says she never thought she'd find someone to do the naked stuff with.

She flashes back to when she was a child, when her Uncle Bartlett abused her. Gran, his sister, ran him off and never spoke to him again. She hates that in that otherwise perfect moment, she can't help but think about him.

Lafayette strips for his Web cam. Jason busts in mid-strip. He wants more V. He's willing to pay however Lafayette wants. Laf says no. Jason asks him what he's going to do, call the police? He goes for Lafayette's stash and Lafayette grabs him and throws him out.

Bill shows Sookie his underground bed. No one else knows where it is. It's time for him to sleep. The sun rises.

Tara helps her mom figure out how to dodge bills. Her mom wants $445 to exorcise her demon, which also told her to drink all the booze in the house, including the booze in her coffee cup. Tara tries to take it from her and when it spills, her mom sucks the booze from her clothes.

Sookie returns home to find Jason wandering off with silver candlesticks and a bag of other things.

He sees the bites on her neck and condemns her for it. He says he's taking half of what's his. He won't tell her what it's for. Sookie rips the bag he's carrying and Adele's jewelry spills out. He leaves with the candlesticks.

Tara stops by Sam's. The friendly dog is outside. He's angry over how she left him and telling her she's not very good at the relationship thing. She hasn't had much practice. ""Maybe I'm un-boyfriendable."" He's trying to fix something and she tells him which tool he needs. She gets a call.

Her mother is at the bank, trying to get a loan for an exorcism. She accuses the loan officer of being prejudiced against her because she's a Christian. She tries everything to get the money, including sitting in his lap. Tara comes to get her. Her mom screams that she can't take the demon inside her much longer. She takes her home. Tara takes some money out from under the sink.

At Merlotte's, Sookie wears a scarf around her neck and is in a terrific mood.

Tara calls in and says she's not coming. Jason's one-nighter calls him and tries to get him to come to the bar, but he's heading to Shreveport to the vampire bar.

Sam tells Lafayette not to mess with the AIDS-burger guys when they come in, but he gets back at them by roasting a spoon over the open fire and putting it in their soup.

Arlene can tell something is different about Sookie. She guesses what has happened, but hopes it was with Sam and not Bill. Sookie says it was Bill and she thinks she might be in love with him. She asks Arlene not to tell anyone and Arlene immediately tells her husband Rene and Sam overhears. Arlene hopes Sookie doesn't get pregnant. How will she nurse a baby with fangs?

Sam walks over to Sookie and rips the scarf off her neck. Seeing the bite marks, he calls her a damn fool and she responds by telling the entire bar that yes, she had sex with Bill, and it was great.

A very agitated Jason goes to the vampire bar, where the vamp at the door recognizes his last name on his ID. He's clearly jonesing. She glamours him and he says the reason he's there is to get some vampire blood. She lets him in, but wishes him luck getting out. Uncle Bartlett takes out his trash, confined to his wheelchair. Bill waits for him. He says he's there for Sookie, and chomps down.

Tara and her mother meet Ms. Jeannette in the woods for her exorcism. Tara gives her the cash. They head into Ms. Jeannette's trailer where all sorts of talismans hang. She tells Tara's mom to strip.

Sookie raves about her night with Bill to Lafayette, who says he was always too scared to let them bite him. He congratulates her for crossing that line, but calls her a skank when she walks away.

At the vampire bar, Jason clumsily tries to get vampire blood from the bartender. A girl overhears him and rescues him, saying she has what he's looking for.

Bill's three vampire acquaintances bust into Merlotte's. Malcolm says he's going to drain Sookie. Bill, disposing of her uncle's body, hears her distress.

Tara watches nervously as Ms. Jeannette places rocks on her mother. Tara's not taking it seriously, but Ms. J says she needs to. She has an opossum on standby for the demon to flee to. She starts humming and banging a drum as she chants. Tara watches as mom starts breathing heavily and heaving. When her mom is silent the opossum starts screeching in its cage. Ms. J picks it up and dunks it in a tub of water, drowning it.

The AIDS burger guys plan to go to Bill's house and ambush the vampires. Sookie wants Sam to stop them, but he says he doesn't care what happens to them. And he doesn't want Bill back in his bar. Sookie says he only went with them to get them away from the bar.

Back at his house, Amy is babbling about the earth and Jason is anxious to do the V. She slowly takes the stuff out, preparing it with aspirin for a fuller effect. She calls it nature's greatest gift. She grinds the blood on aspirin into a powder and puts it on a tray like its cocaine. She prays over it, honoring the earth. Jason plays along to get high. She snorts a line. Then Jason.

They hear birds chirping and everything goes out of focus. She kisses him.

Sookie calls Bill and leaves a message, warning him that a lynch mob is coming.

Jason hallucinates in his bedroom. Amy joins him in bed. They have slow, trippy sex, where each touch seems to send sparks between them. Ms. Jeannette tells Tara's mom her demon is gone, but they have to do something about Tara's demon. Tara's not buying it, but Ms. Jeannette asks her if she has many friends, has trouble keeping a job, has her own place and how long she's been with the same man. She tells Tara to find her when she's ready.

Sookie goes to Bill's house. She looks for him in his secret sleeping place. He's not there. She sits and waits. At daybreak, the lynch mob arrives at the vampire nest, where Sookie believes Bill is sleeping, the four idiots are armed with Molotov cocktails. They surround the house and toss their bottles in. One of them catches his arm on fire. His buddy puts him out as the house burns. They run.

Andy and Terry Bellefleur fish. Terry sees something and signals Andy to be quiet. They see Sam Merlotte running naked through the woods. They think that seems about right.

Andy gets a call. He's not happy at the news.

At Tara's house, her newly unpossessed mother is taking out all her old bottles of ""demon juice."" She hasn't had a drink all day, and she made ho' cakes.

Jason wakes up in bed with the V pusher chick, basking in their afterglow. They agree they felt something in each other. She thinks he's wise, which he points out no one who knows him has ever called him. He doesn't want her to leave, he suggests they lay in bed all day and have sex and do V. She tells him they'll have to wait on the sex, which he finds confusing because he's pretty sure that's what they did all night. But no, her underwear is still on. It was the V.

Tara goes to Sookie's house and finds her with her head in the oven - cleaning it. Tara starts talking about her changed mother, oblivious to what Sookie has just gone through. When Tara sees Sookie's bite marks and judges her for them it quickly leads to Sookie swearing at her and telling her to leave.

Jason, with the V chick, is really excited to not have sex with her again. But she's out of V. Cold pizza tides him over. She asks how his parents died. He hesitates, but says it was a flash flood, they were carried out to the river. He and Sookie were at their grandmother's. They were on their way to pick them up, and Jason blames himself because if he'd been a better kid they would have trusted him to watch Sookie and wouldn't have been on the bridge to pick them up. He starts spilling, saying he's the worst brother in the world. But she's seen who he is inside and thinks he's good. They kiss.

Terry stops by Sam's and soon asks him if by chance he was out running naked in the woods that morning. Sam says he was working on his car, but Terry thinks it looked a lot like him. Terry thinks maybe he's seeing things again, but usually when he sees things it's insurgents.

At night, it rains and Sookie sits around her house. She gets flowers and, as it dries up, she takes them in the dark to the cemetery where she lays them on Bill's old grave, crying over it.

She walks barefoot among the graves until a hand reaches out grabs her, zombie style. A man starts clawing his way out of the dirt and she struggles to get away. Then he says her name. It's Bill. He's covered in dirt but with her down on the ground with him she goes from being attacked form the grave to having dirty vampire sex in record time. When he goes to bite her she tells him ""not the neck.""

Jason and V chick visit Merlotte's, where she's into all the dead animals on the wall. She talks about the circle of life and Jason proclaims: ""I wanna lick your mind.""

Sookie runs into work late, apologizing to Sam for being late. He gives her his condolences for Bill, but she's giddy. Bill's alive and she's great. Sam's less excited. She hugs Arlene, telling her she loves her, even if she is a bigot. She tells Hoyt and Rene that Bill got her voice mails that something might be brewing and decided to sleep in the cemetery. Rene wonders who the fourth body was. Sookie says they think it was a fang-banger, someone the vamps kept around for sex and blood. For someone who can hear what people are thinking, she doesn't seem to register the disapproving looks on their faces.

Jason's V chick, Amy, delivers Sookie's order while she's busy gabbing. Sookie isn't happy to see her brother, but he really wants her to like Amy. She charms Arlene, who tells Sam she thinks they might have found a replacement for Dawn. ""Looks like you did, too,"" Sookie tells him.

At Tara's house, her mother is dressed up for church with clean laundry drying in the back. Tara is dubious about her mother's transformation, and responds profanely to the churchwoman's suggestion she go sometime.

At Merlotte's, Arlene's babysitter falls through and Terry offers. She brushes him off and he compliments her clavicles in a way that makes her need to be somewhere else.

Amy and Sookie chitchat as they clear tables until Sookie tells Amy her brother is a dog and will stop calling as soon as he's tired of her. She tells Amy she seems like a sweet girl and she doesn't want her to get hurt. Amy says Jason hasn't realized half of his potential.

Arlene apologizes to Sookie if she said some things she didn't mean. And Sookie says yes, she'll babysit.

Hoyt tries to compliment Tara, who tells him to eff off in response. Sam, when he finishes pouring out bottles of Tru Blood, asks to talk to Tara, who's five kinds of angry, in his office. She goes in expecting to get chewed out. Instead he tells her they're the only ones that get it. And then the making out against the door begins.

Lying in bed with Bill, Sookie asks him if making love for more than 100 years ever gets old. Not with her it doesn't. They cuddle. She asks him what it's like to sleep in the ground. Not entirely comfortable, but safe. The doorbell rings, it's Arlene with the kids. Sookie tells Bill to stay, it'll do Arlene good.

Arlene's not thrilled to see Bill. She makes the kids each put on a silver bracelet and tells them to stick close to Sookie.

In another bed somewhere, Tara and Sam also bask. When his praise for her naked skills is less than effusive, she asks what she's doing wrong. He says it's minor, she grunts. Somehow this warps into her sounding like Serena Williams playing tennis and her calling him racist. She's up and putting her clothes on in no time flat, cursing the world.

Sookie and Bill, who's great with children, entertain Arlene's kids over ice cream (Bill's ""lactose intolerant""). When they ask to see his fangs, he puts chips in the corners of his mouth and vamps for them, harmless. The kids eat it up.

Arlene and Rene are stopped in the woods. She's in a rush to get back to the kids, but he needs to change the tire. He asks her to bring him the flashlight. When it doesn't work he tells her to check the batteries. There's a ring inside. He proposes.

Back at Sookie's, Arlene's excited. ""I know I've done it four other times, but it never gets old,"" she says. She asks Sookie to be a bridesmaid again. Rene says maybe they'll be next, then pauses awkwardly. When it's legal, he means.

Sookie comes down for breakfast, sun streams through the windows as Bill reads the paper. He's cooked her a huge breakfast. When she points out it's daylight, Bill turns and the side of his face starts bubbling. He bursts into flames and Sookie wakes up, alone.

The coroner gets a call from the sheriff, telling him that his assistant Neil was ID'd as the fang banger they found. The coroner sobs over the news.

The sheriff and Andy talk to Sam, who has little information on the night the men set out to torch the vampire house. He suggests they work on the murders of Maudette, Dawn and Adele. Andy leaves then comes back in, asking Sam if he recalls spending any time in the woods lately. Sam says yes, but Andy already knew that. Sam says he comes from a family of ""naturists,"" which is a clothing-optional lifestyle. His parents spent most of their life at a nudist colony in Texas. He says ever since they died he honors their memory once a year by running naked through the woods.

Lafayette tells Tara she got conned, but Tara says the messed up thing is that her mom's exorcism worked. ""Compared to a lifetime of Zoloft, $445's a bargain,"" he says.

Sam walks in on Sookie taking a vitamin and is upset when he finds out it's B-12.

Jason picks up Amy, who is jonesing hard for V. But Lafayette won't sell it to him.

Cut to Bill's. He comes home and senses someone's in his house. He goes upstairs to find Eric in his tub surrounded by candles. He has a favor to ask. Bill asks if it's a favor or an order. ""Honestly, did you think you could keep her to yourself?"" Eric asks him.

Amy and Jason wait for Lafayette to leave his house. Amy is starting to tweak. She tells him the best way to follow Lafayette's car.

There's a knock at the door of a man's house, it's Lafayette, asking if the man is ready to party. He's a slightly dorky, middle-aged...vampire. He pours Lafayette some wine, nervously. He starts to nuzzle Lafayette, who stops him, saying he needs his juice first, then they'll party. He takes out his syringe. ""I always look forward to Monday nights, first I watch 'Heroes' then I have you,"" Eddie says. He asks Lafayette if he'd still want him even without the blood, Lafayette says of course. They start kissing (as the Bangles ""Eternal Flame"" plays on the stereo).

Bill takes Sookie to Fangtasia, at Eric's request. He tells Sookie why they're there and that Eric is sheriff of Area 5 and they do not want to anger him. As long as his requests are reasonable, they should go along with them. She tells him about her dream. He says it wouldn't happen quite like that, he wouldn't immediately burst into flames. ""So I guess we'll never have breakfast together,"" she says.

Tara visits the voo doo woman, who was expecting her.

Andy checks up on Sam's naturist story, where the naked man who answers the phone says they've never had any Merlottes.

Inside Fangtasia, which is closed for the night, Eric asks Sookie to listen to their accountant. They think he stole $60,000 from them. Eric says it would be a favor to him and Bill if she'd listen to him. It's humbling to have to ask a human for help, glamoring him didn't work. She agrees, but only if they promise to turn the guilty person over to the police. She listens.The accountant is innocent.

When Lafayette leaves Eddie's house, Amy and Jason prep to go in. She takes off her long, lariat silver necklace. Jason sees something she has and asks what the hell it is.

Inside, Eddie watches right wing TV condemn vampires on a pro-vampire talk show. His doorbell rings. Jason says he's a friend of Lafayette's and Eddie opens the door. Amy throws a chainmail silver hood over him and he falls down, screaming with the sound of flesh sizzling. Amy orders Jason to tie up his feet with her necklace. Jason is shocked but helps her carry him to the car.

Sookie listens to the last of the human employees, a woman named Ginger. Sookie hears her honestly think it wasn't her, but she knows who did it. When Sookie asks who, the name has been erased from Ginger's mind. The vamps figure out she was glamored by a vampire and just then the bartender lunges across the bar at Sookie - fangs out - and grabs her by the throat."

Bill reacts by snapping off a beer tap and staking him through the back to protect her. Longshadow spews blood all over Sookie, creating a ""Carrie"" moment as she ends up drenched. Eric and Pam watch, unconcerned as the bartender's face melts and shrivels. One dead vampire.

Ginger, the human employee whose thoughts lead Sookie to Longshadow, cleans up the soupy remains, freaked to be down among the ick. Eric commands Pam to glamour Ginger when she's done. Pam's worried there might not be anything left in Ginger, but Eric says the alternative is to turn her and Pam agrees they're not that desperate.

Eric buys Bill a blood as Sookie cleans up. Eric isn't pleased Bill killed a vampire for a human. He has to pay for it. Eric wants the girl. Bill objects and Eric suspects he's in love with Sookie. Eric agrees he would have made Longshadow pay, but not in front of non-vampire witnesses.

Jason drives with Amy and the vampire Eddie in the trunk. He's freaked out by their recent and on-going kidnapping and she's calm.

At the bar, Pam brings Sookie a change of clothes. She tells Sookie she's not going anywhere until Eric is done with Bill. There's vampire in Sookie's cleavage.

Ginger re-meets Sookie, glamoured.

Jason carries his vampire booty into a basement with Amy. Both Jason and Eddie want to know what Amy has planned as she ties him to a lawn chair and drains Eddie's blood. She tries to placate Jason with blood, but he's unnerved. Amy drinks it straight out of a thimble poured form Eddie's arm and Jason, watching her enter her happy place, seems to become less worried. Eddie tells him not too, but Jason takes a swig.

Tara tries to get exorcism answers. She gets a quote: $799.95, because Tara's demon is worse than her mother's. She tells Tara not to wait, her loneliness is spreading to her eyes. She tells her to count backwards from 10 when she's alone to see if she can stand herself.

Bill brings Sookie home, dressed in leather. He tells her everything's fine with Eric, but at home, it isn't. There's blood on the walls and Sookie's cat is hanging from the ceiling fan.

Amy and Jason pause mid-sex to thank the vampire for his gifts. As they proceed to do it in front of him, he doesn't seem to appreciate the gratitude. A trippy dreamlike sex sequence shows them frolicking through woods and fairylands. Meanwhile, Eddie continues to bleed.

Bill wraps around Sookie, clothed, in bed. He tells her he'll protect her because the trouble she's in is his fault. She says it's hers because she chose it. Sookie closes her eyes and sees her grandmother.

Amy and Jason frolic in a sun-drenched meadow. She tells him to lie down and listen to the trees. Jason feels light-headed and is talking funny. Amy feeds him an almond, telling him raw food makes the experience better, even better than last night.

Jason worries someone will hear Eddie yelling from inside his basement. He thinks they should feed him. He's worried Eddie is going to die. ""So what?"" says Amy. Her plan is that things will work out because they have to. She deserves to have something good happen, she says. She tells Jason she loves him. He turns away like a big dork and grabs a beer. She repeats it, seeming sweet for a girl who just kidnapped a vampire. Jason tells her he loves her, too.

Tara counts backwards in the mirror but is interrupted by her mother, telling her Sam is at the door with flowers. Her mother assumes she slept with him. He came to apologize.

Tara tells him they're not going to work and asks him if he's a masochist. As proof of her unsuitability she tells him about the exorcism she's starting to think she needs but how she doesn't have the money for it. She runs him off.

At the bar, Arlene finagles an engagement party from Sam.

Sookie comes to work, saying there's nothing good about the morning.

Jason sits on the road crew, staring at the trees. Renee jackhammers a tree and Jason tackles him to prevent him from hurting it. Rene does not share Jason's newfound nature love as the running jackhammer nearly hits him. Hoyt tries to talk to Jason, but calls him ""Jay,"" which prompts Jason to ask if he was on the football team and throw him to the ground. Jason does not seem to be handling his V well.

At Merlotte's, Sookie waits on Andy Bellefleur, who wants to talk to Sam. While he decides what to order, Sookie tells him to hurry up and figure out who's trying to kill her. She tells him about her cat. Amy interrupts, suggesting Sookie take a break.

Amy checks on her outside. Soon they're talking about Arlene and marriage and then what Amy intends with Jason. She tells Sookie Jason misses her and loves her. Sookie concludes Amy is way too good for Jason.

Jason arrives home and flips on the TV. He's aggravated by vampire advocate Nan Flanagan on TV. He hears whimpering from the basement and checks on Eddie, who's in pain from sitting in the same spot. Jason moves him, but hurts his back.

Tara finds $800 in an envelope and goes to ask Sam about it. He tells her they'll talk after work.

Bill golfs. (Yes, golfs.) But on a Wii. The doorbell rings. It's Eric, Pam and a new guy, Chow, Longshadow's replacement. Bill says he takes it it couldn't be avoided (we don't know what yet). He says he has to stop by the bar and tell Sookie he'll be gone for a while.

In his basement with Eddie, Jason has recovered and is feeling good. He asks about Eddie, who used to be an accountant. He tells Jason he used to be married, and only recently realized he was gay. Jason is sympathetic, and tells him he doesn't look that gay. He tells Jason about seeing an unattractive gay vampire surrounded by pretty young things and making up his mind then to turn. Jason says that's crazy.

Bill and his entourage arrive at Merlotte's. Bill needs to talk to Sam. He tells Sam he's been called away and he needs Sam to watch over Sookie. Sam's not happy Bill's asking, but he'll do it for Sookie.

Eric and Pam pass out brochures for Fangtasia. Eric announces that vampires know when a human has wronged them. Amy freezes.

Bill tells Sookie he has to stand trial. She realizes he lied to her about everything being OK. Sookie's upset he has to leave and cries as she kisses him good-bye while Eric yells at him to hurry up.

Tara, having seen the whole thing, tries to talk to Sookie. She starts to apologize for their earlier fight and Sookie tells her she can't even remember what she's supposed to be mad about. Tara gives her a hug.

Jason tells Eddie about the death of his parents. Eddie lends a sympathetic ear. He feels bad that Jason had to grow up without a male influence, like Eddie's son now that he's gone. Jason worries that Eddie might glamour him but Eddie says he hasn't learned that yet. He asks Jason if he's going to marry Amy. When Jason says she might be the one, Eddie tells him not to, that she's a psychopath. Jason swears at him and leaves for more beer.

Tara tries to return Sam's money, but he's not taking it. He says people didn't even know vampires existed two years ago, so an exorcism isn't the craziest thing in the world. She softens and thanks him, then kisses him. Sookie sees them making out.

She asks Amy to cover the rest of her shift. When Amy asks if it's a good idea to go home, Sookie says she's going to stay at Bill's because no one will look for her there.

Sam comes out, zipping up, and asks Amy where Sookie is. When she tells him, he runs out, but is stopped by an increasingly suspicious Andy Bellefleur in the lot. He calls Sam on his naturalist story and says they need to talk. Sam says he forgot something in the bar and will be right back.

Sookie drives, checking her mirrors nervously.

The watchful dog runs out of Merlotte's by Andy.

Seconds later he's at Bill's front door. Sookie greets him and welcomes him inside for the night. He looks away as she changes, a gentlemanly dog.

Sookie invites him on the bed with her, deciding to call him Dean.

Jason returns home with beer...and blood. He feeds it to Eddie.

Sookie wakes up in the middle of the night, thinking Dean's sleeping on her feet. She sits up to see something is on her feet... naked Sam. They both scream."

Tara meets with the voodoo woman, Ms. Jeannette, in the woods. They sit next to a campfire and Tara asks a million questions. The woman spits in Tara's hand and puts something in her hand and makes her hold it over the fire then rub it on her face as she talks about demons traveling via cell phone and microwave, which is why she lives in the woods. Tara drinks from a vial - ""snake juice.""

In Jason's basement, Eddie wakes up as Amy drains him, explaining she's a good person because she's an organic vegan and her carbon footprint is minuscule. She punches his arm because he has a clot forming. Amy goes to look for tape and finds the empty Tru Bloods Jason gave Eddie. She thinks it's beneath them to lie to each other. Eddie tells Amy that Jason loves her and thinks she might be the one. He tells her if he dies there Jason will never forgive her.

Sam explains shape-shifting to Sookie. It's hereditary, but he was adopted. He can turn into almost anything, including birds, but flying's hard. He can't turn into people, they're too complex. It wears off if he falls asleep and on a full moon he can't control the shift (which explains what Terry and Andy saw). But don't call him a werewolf, they're nasty- and real. Sookie tries to process the fact that all these things exist. ""Life is just getting too weird too fast,"" she says.

He tries to put his arm around her but she yells at him. He thought she of all people would understand. He wanted to tell her for years. She's grossed out that she kissed him and he wanted to do more.

Voodoo Woman chants and Tara convulses on the ground, holding her stomach in pain. She feels sick and voodoo woman tells her to let the anger and hate go. She throws up. She sees a younger version of herself standing nearby. Voodoo Woman tells her a demon will take any form to stay alive, only she can destroy it. She gives Tara a knife and Tara approaches the girl. She swings the knife through the air into seemingly nothing. But it comes up bloody. The voodoo woman tells her the demon is gone forever.

Jason primps in the mirror. Amy wants to talk about Eddie, she thinks the way they've been treating him is really uncivilized. He agrees. She wants them to make him love them, help him develop Stockholm Syndrome so they can keep him in the house forever and sell his blood when they need money.

Tara goes home and tells her mom about her exorcism. They decide to celebrate.

Sam, Terry and Sookie prepare for Arlene's engagement party. Arlene shows up and suggests they redo the decorations. The real dog that Sam modeled himself on watches. Sam thinks back to his childhood, when he shifted and his mother saw him.

The politician stops by Lafayette's. He wants V juice, but Lafayette is sold out. He can't restock until after dark. The politician has a speech that night and gets stage fright. Lafayette finds another way to calm him.

Tara and her mom drive back from getting food out of town, but her mom feels sick. Tara stops at a drugstore to get her some Pepto. The employee looks like Ms. Jeannette, but with hair and glasses. And not living in the woods. Tara confronts her and she 'fesses up. The snake juice was ipecac and peyote. Tara's furious and feels stupid. She says her mom will start drinking again when she finds out. Ms. Jeannette suggests she not find out, faith is a powerful thing.

Everyone parties at Merlotte's. Terry tries to talk to Sookie, who wishes Bill was there. ""There's some dead people I wish was still around, too,"" he says.

The vampires gather. A head vampire presides over a tribunal. They rip out the fangs of a vamp who fed on another vamp's human. His punishment is three months of starving until his fangs grow back.

Eric presents Bill.

Jason feeds Eddie Tru Blood, happy not to have to sneak. He tells Eddie about their plan to have Eddie live with them. Eddie asks if Amy told him she found his Tru Blood. He says Amy is playing him.

Lafayette calls Eddie from his house, where the door is knocked down. He finds something and knows Jason is involved

At the party, Arlene tells Rene to ask Sookie to dance. Rene tells Sookie she deserves better than a vampire, although he says he has nothing against them. Sam cuts in. He asks for a truce. She's mad he didn't trust her enough to tell her, and that he didn't tell her about Tara. He says there's nothing to tell. He says he didn't tell her because he knew this is how she'd react.

Jason sort of ignores Amy and tells Hoyt and Rene he met Amy at Fangtasia. He talks about how he feels about her, but says he might have lost the upper hand in the relationship. Rene tells him to take it back.

Bill tries to defend himself, but the head vamp, the Magister, isn't hearing it. Bill tells him Longshadow was stealing from Eric, who backs him up. Bill tells him the human exposed Longshadow, which Eric also backs up. Eric tries to cool Bill off when he speaks too well of humans and upsets the Magister. The usual sentence is five years in a coffin chained with silver, during which time he'd probably go insane and waste away. But the Magister is feeling creative.

Arlene raves about Rene to Amy and Sookie, saying he's just so decent and nice to her and the kids. Amy raves about Jason and Sookie complains that you can't really trust anyone, the wet blanket at the love fest. Tara struts up, loaded, and when Sookie tells her she shouldn't be with Sam, she says ""at least he doesn't drink my blood.""

Andy, still looking for answers, asks Sam what his story is. He was adopted and on his own by 15 -- the truth. Andy asks who took him in. He wants to know what his life was like before he moved to Bon Temps and people started getting killed.

Flashback to teen Sam coming home from school to a completely empty house, except for his bedroom.

Andy says he has no record before he moved there. Tara spills beer on Andy and goes over to Sam, kissing him and pulling him away from Andy.

Tara takes him in the office and tries to get Sam to have sex with her. He stops her, asking what she wants from him. She turns back to angry Tara and storms out.

Lafayette, angry, finds Jason at the party, telling him his supplier is missing. He chews Jason out for always acting like everything's fine, even when people are dying around him. He shoves Jason to the ground, saying he won't be next.

The Magister tells Bill he owes them a life. They take a teenage girl named Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) out of the trunk of a car. Bill says he'll take the coffin instead. Jessica begs for her life, promising to be a good Christian.

Sookie goes inside to get ice. The lights go out. She flashes to the scene of a woman being attacked somewhere. Someone springs from the dark and tries to choke Sookie. She hits him with the ice bucket and runs, hiding in the walk-in fridge. The person follows. She flashes to a woman dying as a man strangles her. Sookie manages to escape and runs back into the bar and into Sam. She asks him not to leave her and he holds her tight.

Tara speeds down the road, drinking. Suddenly, she comes upon a woman standing in the middle of the road next to a pig and swerves to avoid them.

At Jason's, Amy and Jason argue as he tries to be the boss. Amy tells Jason that Eddie will kill them. Jason runs to free him from the silver chains telling Amy that he won't. As Jason starts to undo the ties, Amy grabs a fence post and spikes Eddie through the chest, killing him.

Bill says if they want to torture someone, torture him. The Magister counters that according to their records Bill's never been a maker. He asks if Bill knows the procedure. Yes. ""Then proceed.""

Bill approaches Jessica, taking her hand. She says Jesus will take her home to Heaven. Bill asks her name and glamors her, trying to calm her. But glamor is not permitted. The Magister tells Bill to do as he's told. Bill grabs Jessica, staring at her neck, asking for forgiveness. He chomps down. Jessica screams as Bill feasts and the other vampires look on lustily."

At Sookie's, Sam leaves a message for Tara asking where she is, worried about her. Sookie makes Sam a bed. She didn't get any sense of who the killer was, just pictures. His thoughts were red and black and snarly. There was something familiar, but she didn't recognize him. She saw a woman die in his thoughts, a waitress maybe.

Sookie thinks Bill isn't coming back because he would have felt how scared she was and still didn't come for her. Sookie asks if he heard from Tara. He rubs her shoulder. She says good-night.

Sam loads his rifle.

Tara tells a police officer about the naked lady and a huge pig in the middle of the road. The woman knows Tara's drunk and takes her in.

Jason and Amy clean up the mess that remains of Eddie. Jason looks at Amy like the psycho she is and tells her it was going to be OK his way. They start screaming at each other as Amy says Jason was there the whole way and knew it was going to end badly. As he starts to clean he throws up and Amy tries to comfort him, telling him Eddie was already dead and was a predator. She tells him not to let a vampire come between them. She says what they have is beautiful, as they sit in a basement surround by vampire blood and guts.

Sam comes down to Sookie's and eats breakfast. Sookie doesn't want to wait for the killer to come for her. She's looking through the Yellow Pages. In her sleep, she remembered the woman's name tag. Cindy, and she worked somewhere with the word ""pie"" in the name. Sam recognizes the name. He's going with her.

Amy feeds Eddie guck into the disposal. Jason comes in, angry. He smashes the vials of V and tells Amy he wants every drop out of his house. If she doesn't like it, she can pack her bags and go.

Lafayette paints his toes at the bar, angrily watching his politician lover, a state senator, make an anti-vampire rights speech on TV. They announce where he's staying that night. Amy comes in, looking rough. Lafayette asks if Jason dragged her into his b.s.

At the pie place, Sookie and Sam get nothing from a dumb waitress, but a man at the counter knows her. He tells them she was killed and they don't know who did it. She has a brother, but he's gone: Drew Marshall. He says people said she was carrying on with the vampires.

Tara calls her mom from jail for bail money.

At work on the road crew, Jason tries to get Rene and Hoyt to party with him that night. Hoyt asks why he wants to hang with them when he's got Amy. He thinks about it for a minute and then confesses that Amy likes V. Rene asks if she sleeps with vampires, too. Jason says she says she doesn't. Rene says they'll go out tomorrow. ""These things have a way of working out,"" he tells Jason.

Sookie and Sam visit a police station where she hears the cop thinking about his mistress. The cop becomes unhelpful when he sees Sookie's vampire bites. She suggests she'll tell his wife about his affair and call the Vampire League of America. He says he can fax a photo of Drew to the Bon Temps police.

Lafayette, dressed in a slick, respectable suit, goes to shake hands with his hypocritical politician lover. He shakes his hand and smiles through threats, commending the man for taking a stand against vampires and gays and praising him for the risk he's taking because, after all, so many things can happen to someone such as himself for taking a stand.

Jason arrives home to a candlelit dinner. Amy says it was all her fault and she's sorry. She say's shed do anything for him. Jason, thought of vampire guck wiped away by a home cooked meal, relents. They hug.

Bill waits graveside for Jessica the new vampire to rise. She digs her way out of the ground. She comes up screaming, asking for help.

Sam and Sookie drive home, bonding. Sookie asks him if he loves Tara. He says he likes her and cares about her, but she doesn't make it easy to love her. They're friends.

Sam says he's not that easy to love either and Sookie tells him he's wrong. Sam asks if she loves Bill. She thinks she does, but where is he?

Jason unbuttons his pants, for eatin' room, and raves about Amy's fantastic homecooked meal. She has something she wants to show him, but doesn't want him to get mad. She saved one drop of V. She talks about V being how they started their relationship, so that's how they should end it, to complete the circle. Jason resists for a minute, but then agrees to one last time.

Bill tries to explain to petulant young Jessica that she's a vampire now. She can't go home.

She thinks being a vampire means she can kill anyone she wants. She whines like a teenager. He tries to feed her Tru Blood. She thinks it tastes terrible. She calls him the worst maker ever. She pouts.

She thinks Tara's on the road to Hell and she's a danger to her soul and she can't have her in her house. Tara's the only reason she has a house, Tara points out. She put up with her mom beating her and taking her money and sending her to school dirty. And now she's turning her back on Tara. Tara tells her to leave. When her mom says she loves her, she says she doesn't, and never did.

Jason and Amy lounge in bed. It seems to start raining on them. Suddenly they're outside, running. Someone enters their house. He's wearing boots. As they romp in their V dreams he approaches them, asleep in bed. We don't see his face. He's wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He takes off his belt and wraps it around Amy's neck. In their V dream, they dance. Amy doesn't seem to notice she's being choked. Then in the V trip she flies away. Jason laughs. Then he wakes up next to her corpse.

He doesn't realize it at first. Then he sees the marks on her neck. He cries, confused. He calls 911.

Bill takes Jessica to Eric, wanting help. She doesn't want to stay with Bill. Eric bosses her effectively. Bill says he needs to get back. Bill tells Eric he'd be in his debt and return the favor if Eric would take her.

A woman pays Tara's bail. She doesn't know her. She's Mary Ann Forrester. She's some kind of social worker, Tara guesses. Tara doesn't want a ride home. Mary Ann says Tara can come home with her. Tara checks that she's not a ""Jesus person."" She's about to leave when Tara stops her. They walk out to Mary Ann's extremely nice car. Andy Bellefleur pulls up and tells her to move her car. They drive off.

Andy takes Jason in.

Sookie and Sam watch TV close on the couch. Sookie tells him she had a good day with him. Sam says the day she walked in looking for a job was probably the best day of his life. She believes him. They start to kiss.

Just then, Bill busts in. He rips Sam off Sookie and starts to fight him. She breaks it up, yelling at Bill for leaving her with no promise to return and then attacking the man who's protecting her. He says if she knew what he'd done to return to her.... She rescinds his invitation to enter her house. He has to leave. Back inside, Sam asks her why she can't see what he's really like. ""Sam, my living room's wrecked, I've got a killer, a vampire and a shape-shifter on my plate, right about now, I'm not thinking about being with anybody.""

Mary Ann's house is enormous. She invites Tara in.

At the police station, Andy gloats, saying he knew Jason was the killer from the beginning. Jason is resigned. He says he doesn't remember what he's done, to any of them. But they keep dying around him, so it must be him, right? He tells him he took V with Amy and when he woke up, she was dead. They were alone, he thinks he must have done it. But he doesn't know why, he loved her. Andy screams at him that he hated Dawn and Maudette, Jason denies it.

Andy accuses him of killing his grandmother, but Jason denies it. Andy says its the worst confession he's ever heard. But that's all Jason has. He says he doesn't want to hurt anyone else. He asks them to lock him up.

The fax of Drew Marshall arrives at the police station and a secretary careless covers it up with files. But we see who it is: Rene."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226625/?ref_=ttep_ep12,,Sookie comes face-to-face with the killer as Jason's fate is up in the air.

(Rene gets the truck.) Rene says it's not like Jason killed a bunch of ""innocent women."" Jason objects to the characterization of his grandmother as a ""fangbanger.""

Sookie bullies her way back to see Jason, telling him she wishes she'd gotten there sooner before he confessed to something he didn't do. She tells him to shut up because she's real close to finding out who the real killer is. Rene, the real killer, stands 10 feet behind her.

(Seriously, how good are these credits?)

She tells Sookie about Drew Marshall and how he killed his sister Cindy. She hears Rene wonder why she doesn't go to the cops if she knows all this. She tells him she doesn't know what he looks like, but she's been in his head. She asks Andy Bellefleur if she got the fax with a photo of the real killer. He says he knows nothing about a fax, and why bother since he's got the real killer? She tells Andy he's a poor excuse for a cop and a human being and it's a matter of time before everyone knows it.

Tara wakes up in a plush bed, with a robe laid out for her. A man makes her breakfast. Maryann joins her for breakfast. Tara is figuring out she's not just a social worker. Maryann sees Tara's situation as an opportunity. She has room to rebuild her life. Tara, feeling awkward, makes an excuse to leave, but Maryann says they both know she's got nowhere to go. She says she just wants to help.

The manservant, making Tara's bed, picks up her ringing phone. It's Sam. The manservant hangs up and pockets Tara's phone.

Sookie comes into work, telling Sam she plans to hire a PI to find out who Drew Marshall is.

Jason gets a visitor, Orry Dawson. He's there on behalf of the Fellowship of the Sun - as Jason calls it, the ""vampire-hating church."" Orry says what Jason did was a service to his race and to Jesus and he should be proud of it. The church has started a fund for Jason's defense. In the meantime, the man slips him some church literature and calls him a ""brave soldier.""

At Maryann's mansion, Tara goes swimming, beginning with a cannonball. She comes inside to find an enormous spread of food laid out. A young, attractive black man is playing guitar on the couch. His name is Benedict, but he goes by ""Eggs."" He's staying there until he gets back on her feet. ""So, collecting stray black people, that's some sort of hobby of hers?"" Tara says.

When Maryann found him he was worse off than Tara. He calls Maryann a ""miracle worker."" He starts strumming his guitar again and Tara tries to relax.

Outside, Maryann vibrates. She sits in a chair outside, moving in place at hyperspeed.

Rene, enjoying Jason's truck, drives to Merlotte's. Sookie hears Andy loudly telling the story of Jason's confession, but Sheriff Bud corrects him, saying that Jason didn't exactly confess. Bud excuses himself. The cute girl sitting next to Andy offers to buy him a beer and he laps up the adoration.

Sookie hears everyone looking at her, judging her for being Jason's sister. Drew/Rene is sitting nearby, but she hears nothing. She tells Sam she needs to get out of there. She gives him a hug, thanking him for everything.

Sookie gets in her car but it won't start. Rene surprises her, asking if everything's OK. He offers to take a look, but later confesses he doesn't know much about cars. He offers to give her a ride and stay with her until Sam gets off work when she says she can't be alone. Terry drives up, telling Sookie that he told Andy he's known killers and Jason ain't one. ""No one ever listens to me, but they should,"" Terry says.

Before Rene closes Sookie's hood he glances at the sabotaged part.

Rene gives Sookie a ride and when he asks her if she can really hear what he's thinking she hears him thinking that he should think about nothing. She tells him not to bother, you always eventually think of something. She tells him it's weird, but his thoughts don't have an accent.

She talks about how hard it is to hear people think horrible things. She tells Rene that Jason is all she's got left, she's lost everyone.

Rene/Drew says he's lost people too. It doesn't get easier, but you find ways to cope.

Arlene walks into the living room to find her two young daughters watching the Maudette vampire sex tape. One says it's Rene's; they found it in the garage. Arlene looks at the box of video tapes and finds a cassette on perfecting the Cajun dialect.

Rene looks around the house, noticing a rifle leaned against the fire place.

Lafayette cleans up, tossing Sam Rene's work vest that he left behind. Sam takes a whiff of it and finally we understand why Sam rolled around sniffing Dawn's sheets after she was found dead. He recognizes the scent. Sam runs outside, where Terry tells him Sookie left with Rene 23 minutes ago.

At her house, Sookie makes iced tea and Rene fails at thinking of nothing. Sookie sees Rene thinking about Gran and how he came in to find her and started saying she wasn't supposed to be there and attacking her. Sookie sees Rene go after her grandmother and she drops her pitcher of iced tea. She tries telling Rene she's just jumpy as she calmly walks into the other room to the shotgun.

Rene lets her get to it and point it at him, as he tells her she's not going to shoot him. She tries to, but he's removed the shots. She hears him switch voices in his head, cursing, condemning her for sex with vampires. Sookie hauls off and whacks him upside the head with the shotgun and he drops to the ground. She runs outside. Rene chases her through the woods near her house, seeing Drew noticing his sister Cindy's bite marks and then attacking her. As she keeps running, Rene stops, screaming that he can feel her in his head. Sookie sees Rene attacking Dawn, then him sneaking in to kill Amy as she lay next to Jason.

Bill wakes up in his coffin. It's broad daylight outside, but he can hear Sookie screaming and terrified. Sam arrives at her house and sees a belt and signs of a struggle. He runs outside. Bill gets up from his coffin and his skin immediately starts sizzling in the sunlight.

Rene stops running, trying to lure her out saying he didn't mean it. His thoughts list all the vile things he's going to do to her. Sookie hides in the cemetery in a spot dug for a grave. She hears Rene think that he must have lost her in the woods and should go back and check and so Sookie turns to peek her head out of the ground - but he's standing above her. He slugs her. He yanks her out of the ground and throws her against a gravestone and starts strangling her. Bill stumbles onward in the daylight, all of his hair gone and his skin almost completely blistered off. Sam the dog comes running, biting Rene's neck, but Rene manages to get the dog off and starts kicking it. He watches as the dog, hurt, changes into naked Sam. Bill, smoldering nearby, can't quite make it to where Rene is kicking the daylights out of Sam, ""the freak of nature."" Sookie regains her senses and grabs a nearby shovel. She whacks Rene to the ground. When he starts to come back up she takes the shovel and digs deep, almost completely severing his head.

Sam gets up behind her, apparently OK. Sookie, not yet taking in the trauma, sees a smoking pile of man nearby and runs to Bill. His flesh is charred black and he can barely move. He tells her he's sorry. Naked Sam comes to help, picking Bill up as Sookie sobs. Sam puts Bill in the dug grave and covers him with dirt.

Sookie wakes up, bruised and battered, to find Tara standing over her with Sam and Lafayette. Sookie's on pain meds. She asks Tara if Sam told them he saved her life. She explains how he turned into dog, but they chalk it up to pain meds. She tells Sam to let people see the real him because there's nothing there not to love. ""Right back at you,"" he says as Tara sits there somewhat awkwardly.

Arlene comes in with an enormous bouquet of flowers and burst into tears.

Sheriff Bud tells Andy the D.A. is dropping the charges. The marks on Amy's neck match Rene's belt and he, Drew Marshall, nearly killed Sookie. Bud tells Andy to let Jason go. Andy goes back to let Jason out, angry and cussing. He tells Jason, who has been reading church literature all day, that his release is a miracle.

Arlene apologizes for that whole ""sorry my fiance was a serial killer and murdered your grandmother and friends and tried to kill you"" thing. She can't believe she didn't know. Sookie says no one did.

Sookie says Rene kept that part of himself locked away in some dark corner of his mind. Arlene, sobbing, can't stop apologizing. Arlene says if she ever finds another man she wants Sookie to look in his head and tell her everything, ""'cause I have the worst taste in men."" Arlene asks if Bill is going to be OK. Sookie says she doesn't think so and starts crying.

Lafayette says his good-byes, leaving Tara and Sam on the porch alone. Sam asks Tara where she's been, saying he left her five messages. She says she didn't get them. She tells him she's glad he was there for Sookie. Tara says Sookie's right, he is a good guy and he deserves to get everything he wants, and so does she. Maryann pulls up in her shiny sports car and Tara introduces them. But it's unnecessary.

With Tara out of earshot, Sam asks Maryann what she's doing there. ""Did you think I wasn't going to find you? You silly, silly dog,"" she tells him, leaving.

Arlene tells Sookie she should have known, because there were things he liked to do in bed that ""no normal man ever does.""

Jason comes in. Seeing how bruised Sookie is, he says he can't believe he gave Rene his truck. When he says if Rene was still alive he'd kill him again, Arlene excuses herself.

Jason tells Sookie that he had a lot of time in jail to think about how he's never done anything with his life. He says when he was in jail, he was saved and he thinks the bad stuff happened for a reason. He just isn't sure what that is yet. He thinks he's meant to do something important with his life, and as soon as he figures out what it is, he's not going to screw it up.

Lafayette takes out the garbage at Merlotte's. Something swoops out of the trees, freaking him out. He jumps on the Dumpster as it comes at him.

The swooping comes to Sookie's front door. Her doorbell rings. It's Bill. ""You're alive,"" she says. ""Well, technically, no."" He says he fed. He looks completely healed. She invites him in. They hug. He sees her bruises and starts to bite his wrist for her, but she says she wants to feel human, even if that means healing slowly. She can't believe he was willing to sacrifice himself for her. Her life is too short to be angry. They start to kiss.

Two weeks later

A news report announces Vermont has legalized vampire marriage. Arlene teases Sookie that maybe she and Bill should get married now. Sam, back to being bitter, chimes in that he could throw the party because it'd be cheap without food or drinks. Tara tells him he's about as subtle as a flying brick and starts quoting Maryann to him, which he doesn't appreciate. Sam asks her if she's heard from Lafayette. She hasn't. Terry smiles awkwardly at Arlene and sweetly tells her that people disappear but the good parts of them stick around. Then he tells her her hair is ""like a sunset after a bomb went off, pretty."" Then he walks away awkwardly while Arlene is charmed.

Jason attends church with Orry, where the preacher says they won't rest until they've brought God's light onto each and every ""blood sucking abomination.""

At the bar, Tara tells Andy to head on home, but he's deep into feeling sorry for himself. She pours him an extra shot and tell him it's easier for her not to hate him, because that takes too much energy.

Sookie brings Hoyt his food, telling him she's celebrating with Bill later. Hoyt says he'd marry a nice vampire girl if he could find one.

Bill plays the piano and Jessica the bratty vamp strides in, followed by a beaten down Eric and Pam. Pam proclaims Jessica ""extremely annoying."" They're turning her back over to Bill. They wish him luck and leave.

Andy is deep into self pity and Sookie tries to get him to leave. She hears him feeling sorry for himself, thinking she must be happy she was right about him failing and she smiles kindly, saying she's going to call his sister to pick him up and calling him Detective Bellefleur.

Sam, in a snit, goes to his office safe and starts loading stacks of money into a garbage bag.

Out in the parking lot, Andy thinks someone stole his car, but then Tara points it out a few yards over. The three of them walk over to it. Andy opens the back door and a leg with painted toenails the same color as Lafayette's plops out. Tara and Sookie scream."

While Danny is stuck with doing his make up test, Sam and Tucker are trying to slow down Technus.

He wakes and gets out of bed asking, ""Where am I? ... Where the f**k am I?"" He is looking for the bathroom, in the dark, and when he thinks he's found it he begins urinating. His wife calls out his name and opens a door shedding a little light on the situation. We meet Logan Roy (Brian Cox) wearing a gray tank top, again asking ""Where am I?"" His wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass) assures her husband, ""It's okay. We're in the new place."" It is now morning in New York City and Logan's second son, Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) is riding to work in a limousine. He is listening to music on headphones. He is dropped off at the Waystar-Royco headquarters building.

[Credits Roll]

Kendall greets the company CFO, Frank Vernon (Peter Friedman). They are completing negotiations for an acquisition of Vaulter, a web/tech company, to add to the Waystar-Royco portfolio. Lawrence Yee (Rob Yang) is sitting with his team in a conference room. Ken thinks everything is ready to sign when Yee informs him, ""Look, uh, I'm really sorry, but it looks like there's an issue. I can deliver a lot more value for our shareholders."" Lawrence concludes the meeting, and leaves the conference room. Ken chases after the Vaulter founder and CEO, but Lawrence makes his position clear, ""I'm not letting you Neanderthals in to rape my company, ever."" After shaking Ken's hand goodbye, he gets into the elevator and promptly washes his hands with hand sanitizer. Ken is adamant about the acquisition and tells his team he'll push the bid to 120.

At the Amusement Park, Cousin Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) is sitting in his car enjoying a joint. Greg has joined the Waystar-Royco ""family"" of employees at the bottom most rung. Greg puts his costume head on and wanders around the park. He is Doderick, a brown dog character that sports a necktie. A small group of children surrounds Greg and begins attacking him. Greg manages to swear at the children before vomiting out the eye holes of his costume head. Needless to say this ends his career at the park. He calls his mother to explain what happened. Marianne Hirsch (Mary Birdsong) tells her son to get on an airplane and come to New York. She will make arrangements with Marcia for Greg to attend his great-uncle Logan's birthday party.

As Ken discusses the Vaulter acquisition with his team, his younger brother, Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) arrives with a ""Business Alchemist"" to burn sage in the conference room - presumably to scare off evil spirits. Roman has recently been relocated to New York from the Studios out in Los Angeles. Ken informs his brother they are up to 125 for Vaulter. Roman is satisfied to let Ken call the shots on the deal, then lets slip that Ken will soon be ""captain of the ship."" This is supposed to be a secret from the employees and the world outside. At the Roy apartment, Marcia is seeing to the birthday lunch details in the dining room. Logan, slightly befuddled and bored, wanders around the apartment. Out on the streets of New York, we meet Logan's only daughter, Siobhan (Sarah Snook). Shiv, as she is known to the family, is out with her fiancé, Tom Wambsgans (Matthew MacFadyen). Tom is agonizing over a birthday gift for his soon to be father-in-law and asks Shiv's advice. Shiv advises, ""So make sure it looks like 10 to 15 grand's worth and you're good.""

Ken is still working with the acquisition team when Logan shows up. He has an alteration to the family trust involving his third wife, Marcia, and asks Ken to sign off, which Ken does without reading the document. Logan runs into Greg in the lobby of his apartment building. Logan's bodyguard, Colin (Scott Nicholson), sees the package in Greg's hand and assumes the worst. Greg is manhandled until Logan calls Colin off. In the apartment we meet Logan's oldest son, from his first marriage, Connor (Alan Ruck). Connor lives out in New Mexico and has distanced himself from any involvement in company business. Logan asks Roman about the Vaulter proceedings. Dad's little spy reports that, ""Not so good. It's a s**tshow."" Ken and Frank deal with another Vaulter problem, a potential bidder in the wings. Ken is desperate to make this deal happen because he is sure Logan is going to announce his retirement and Ken's elevation to the top spot. Ken briefs Logan on progress and again asks about his new role at the company. Ken's wife Rava Roy (Natalie Gold) and children arrive at the party. It becomes clear their marriage is over and Ken's drug problem is the cause.

Before lunch, Logan asks his children to meet with him in private on the trust changes. He wants his children to agree to Marcia being added to the trust and that his seat would go to her upon Logan's death. Then Logan drops the second bomb - he is not retiring and will stay on as head of Waystar-Royco. Ken is dumbfounded and can't believe what his dad just said, so Logan spells it out for him, ""I just said, son, or were you not listening, as usual?"" Ken clears the dining room and has it out with his father. Logan reminds Ken that three years ago he was in rehab, but Logan prefers to call it the nuthouse. Next Logan expresses, in rather crude street language, that the Vaulter acquisition was handled poorly, ""Is that why you're paying a billion dollars for a gay little website?"" Logan makes it clear to Ken that it is his company and he has, and had over the years the vision to build it into the fifth largest media conglomerate in the world. Lunch is served. After lunch Frank makes a speech about Logan and reiterates his thirty year friendship. Logan announces he wants to play ""the game"". The game it seems involves the family flying on three of the company helicopters to a baseball field for a few innings. On the ride, Shiv reviews the trust document and shakes her head no to Ken. Roman gets his alone time with Dad and expresses his interest in a COO position and his issues with Frank's oversight of his every move.

On the baseball field Logan asks Shiv if she'd consider coming into the firm. For both Shiv and Roman this is serious negotiating time. Logan desperately wants the changes to the trust and he must have his children's signature on same. Shiv suggests the top job, but Logan counters with running the non-U.S. operations. Tom makes his move, he presents Logan with his birthday gift. It is a Patek Philippe watch. It is clear Logan has little regard for Tom, despite the fact that he will sometime soon be his son-in-law. The game starts and Ken gets a hit, but leaves to take a phone call. The gardener's son substitutes. Ken takes the helicopter back to the city to meet with Lawrence Yee. He ups the purchase price to 140 and a board seat. The baseball game is over, and Colin meets with the gardener and his family. They get the watch as a gift from Logan. Frank gets a surprise himself - ""light duties"", in other words the axe. The children are ordered to accompany Logan on his helicopter for the ride back to the city. Logan wants those trust papers signed, but Shiv and Roman decline to sign. Connor will go along with his half-siblings. Logan internalizes his anger and frustration with his two youngest children and begins to mumble incoherently. He slumps over into Connor's lap.

Ken, in the boardroom, is congratulating himself and the team when Lawrence tells him about the news regarding Logan, ""Your Dad just had a brain hemorrhage."" Ken is shocked and dismayed that Lawrence would concoct such a cruel joke. It is no joke. Lawrence Yee then assures Ken that, ""You just invited me into the chicken coop. And without Daddy around to protect you, I'm gonna eat you all. One by f**king one."" Ken gets a phone call from his sister, Shiv, confirming that Logan is in the hospital. Marcia is just outside Logan's room, while the children wait outside in the ward hallway. We close with a shot of the city skyline at dusk with news reporters' overlapping coverage of Logan's condition.

Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) and his Personal Assistant, Jess Jordan (Juliana Canfield) are being driven to the hospital. Ken is on the phone talking to his soon to be ex-wife, Rava. A medical team is working on Logan Roy (Brian Cox). Standing off to the side is his third wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), when Kendall and his older brother, Connor (Alan Ruck) approach. Closely behind the pair are Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) and Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin). The Roy children question the medical staff. The doctor escorts them out of the ICU, while Marcia apologizes to the doctor for the ill manners of her step children.

[Credits Roll]

Ken demands answers from the medical staff and gets the brush off. Logan's Bodyguard/Fixer, Colin (Scott Nicholson), enters and informs the children there is an area prepared for them to wait. Ken asks Roman exactly what precipitated the stroke. Roman suggests Shiv's hardball tactics on the trust played a major part. Ken is trying to take charge, but is facing sibling resistance. Connor is obsessing over cryogenically preserving Logan. In another part of the hospital, Greg (Nicholas Braun) is talking to his mother on the phone. Marianne Hirsh (Mary Birdsong), Greg's mother is at home. Greg is not sure if he has a job or not, but his mother reminds him that he will get no more money from her. Shiv takes his last $20 for the vending machine. Ken is watching a draft broadcast of his father's obituary from ATN. Jess brings in a rather sad looking fruit basket and informs Ken that it is from Lawrence Yee at Vaulter. Ken is not amused.

The company attorney, Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron) and Karl (David Rasche) arrive and express concerns over company succession. They pull Ken aside to discuss the board's concern over the situation with Logan. The company execs have talked to the hospital trustees and have obtained space to set up a ""war room"". The IT staff is setting up computers and the company PR executive, Karolina (Dagmara Dominczyk) is already on site. On a conference call, Ken is informed that he has been selected as acting CEO, and Frank (whom Logan fired earlier in the day) stays on as COO. It is a surprise to Ken that Frank was fired by Logan and Roman was promoted to COO. Ken directs the staff to behave as if nothing that Logan did during the day happened. Roman pulls Shiv aside to talk, but the only place available is an empty auditorium. Roman is feeling guilty and asks Shiv to sign the trust papers as their father wanted. Shiv declines the offer and a slap fest and roll on the ground tussle ensues.

In the waiting area Marcia asks Greg to go to the apartment and retrieve some bed things and slippers. Shiv reminds her step mother that Colin or the driver can manage this little task. Marcia then reveals her real intention, ""I don't need this fly buzzing in my face."" Roman adds the trust paperwork to Greg's errand. Connor returns with his steady whore/girlfriend, Willa (Justine Lupe). Ken informs Roman and Shiv that he and Frank will take over, per the board, but Shiv refuses to even discuss the matter while Logan is still alive. Greg takes a cab to Logan's apartment. When he arrives he has no money to pay for the cab and Logan's doorman doesn't recognize him. Fortunately, Marcia calls the doorman and Greg is allowed to go up and collect the slippers. Greg finds the trust documents.

Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) brings Marcia a cup of coffee as she waits by Logan's bedside. Tom discusses his intention to marry Shiv and explains that he wanted Logan's permission. The doctor explains to Marcia and the children that Logan has had a hemorrhagic stroke and that at his age surgery is contraindicated. They will wait and observe. Shiv is not in favor of this approach and suggests moving him to NYU, but Marcia as spouse is clear, and sets Shiv straight. ""No. He stays here. He gets better here,"" she states. Then she reminds Shiv who makes the decisions for Logan, ""No. No discussion. I am his next of kin. I am his proxy. I am in charge. Thank you."" On the street outside the hospital, Frank Vernon (Peter Friedman) meets with Ken. Ken asks Frank to stay on as COO, but to Ken's surprise, Frank declines. He tells Ken there is a huge mess to be cleaned up but Ken can do it.

Roman makes a final appeal to Shiv to sign the trust papers Greg will pick up and return to the hospital. Shiv calls Greg and tells him NOT to bring the trust papers back to the hospital. When Ken returns from his meeting with Frank, he approves of the Greenberg suite for his father's recovery. Ken again brings up succession with Roman and Shiv with the same lack of agreement. Karolina is consulted on a statement regarding Logan. Greg decides to call his mother and ask for advice. It is now very late night or early morning, and Ken calls Lawrence Yee of Vaulter. Lawrence (Rob Yang) is in bed on his iPad with his sleeping companion/lover Tatsuya (Jake Choi) when the phone rings. ""Hey. What's up, Kendall? You mix me up with your sponsor?"" Ken tells Yee to keep a lid on reporting about Logan's condition, but Lawrence reminds Ken of the editorial independence clause on the contract. He is very annoyed at Ken's marching orders and decides a full frontal attack is in order. He immediately calls a contact at Vaulter and suggests we, ""run something about Logan Roy and the Roy family s**tshow."" Shiv and Roman decide that Ken is an unacceptable CEO and ask Gerri to consider stepping up. Roman says, ""For me and Shiv, the whole Kendall thing doesn't work. So we were thinking, general counsel, you know where the bodies are buried. You probably buried them yourself. So, you would have the family's support to step in and take the reins."" Gerri declines the very generous offer.

Ken receives a text message. News from Vaulter and the headline reads, ""S**t Show at the F**k Factory."" He again meets with his siblings, then finally concludes, ""Look, the board are offering this to me. I don't actually needs your backing."" Shiv mentions something about a court action, and Ken leaves the waiting room. Roman calls Greg at the apartment to remind him about the trust papers. It is now 4:00 a.m. and Rava Roy (Natalie Gold) shows up at the hospital to see Ken. Ken summarizes the day's events and his disagreements with Shiv and Roman. Rava sums up her observation of the Roy family, ""Oh, your family is so f**ked. I'm sorry, but ... wow."" She comforts her soon to be ex. Tom picks the worst possible time to propose marriage to Siobhan. Greg returns to the hospital with the slippers. He talks to Tom and is assured Tom will help him. Ken and Roman come to an understanding, CEO and COO and Shiv remains out. Ken and Roman present their agreement to Shiv and Connor. The four then meet with Gerri and Karl in the War Room. It is now dawn and Gerri pulls Ken outside to the rooftop to officially brief him on a serious financial matter. ""There's a huge debt problem. Three billion dollars,"" she explains. ""In 1985, Logan needed cash badly for the expansion into Parks, so he took out a loan through the family holding company ... And then he added that loan to the company's already considerable debt."" She then goes on to explain that the debt is secured against Waystar's stock and when the stock hits 130, they [the Lender] can pursue repayment in full."" Then as an aside and a joke, Gerri tells Ken not to jump off the building.

The hospital war room is packed up and emptied. The doctor briefs the family and assures them that while Logan has shown no improvement, he is in stable condition. The family disperses, but Marcia waits in a chair by Logan's bedside. The scene closes with a close-up of Logan barely opening his eyes.

Marcia Roy (Hiam Abbass) exits the bedroom and asks the butler, ""Richard, can you get me the price of the Waystar stock? At close last night, please."" At their apartment Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) and Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) share, Shiv is eating breakfast. She asks Tom, ""Have you seen the numbers? Man, poor Ken. He's like dysentery for the stock price. You are walking into a burning barn."" Shiv mentions that she is going to visit Logan and asks Tom to accompany her. Ken calls his wife, Rava Roy (Natalie Gold) to ask her advice on how to deal with the bank [ICBC] holding the Waystar note.

Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) is working out with his personal trainer, Brex (Brock Yurich). The trainer explains to Roman that he expects a commitment to being serious about getting in shape. Shiv and Tom go to visit Logan. When they arrive, two of Logan's caregivers exit, one of them crying. Colin (Scott Nicholson) escorts the women down in the elevator. Shiv insists on seeing her father and Marcia is just as insistent she does not. Shiv and Tom elicit some information from one of Logan's caregivers, but that doesn't pan out. Ken and Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron) watch the computer screen stock price profile cratering when Gerri assures Ken, ""It'll stabilize."" Ken tells Gerri his approach with the bank will be ""Go F**k Yourself."" Gerri is unimpressed with the proposed approach. Mr. Polk (voice of John Ottavino) calls Ken on the telephone. Polk reminds Ken that the bank is owed $3.25 billion. Polk calmly tells Ken, ""If it reaches 130, you've broken the covenant, and we will want repayment."" He goes on to explain that they don't like the media sector or Logan's treatment of them, so they want their money back, period. This is followed by a very long and uncomfortable silence. Polk finally explains that he doesn't care for the foul language or Ken's attitude. Polk hangs up the phone. Roman enters Logan's office where Ken and Gerri just finished the phone call with the bank. He explains that he was listening in, as a COO is entitled to do, and tells Ken that he handled the matter poorly.

Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) shows up in the lobby of Waystar-Royco to check in, but of course the receptionist cannot find anything of his employment on the computer. While Tom addresses the Greg situation, Shiv goes upstairs to talk to her brothers about Logan. Shiv fears the worst, ""Yeah, no one has seen him since we took him home from the hospital Thursday."" Shiv asks that Ken intervene with Marcia. Lawrence Yee (Rob Yang) and the other division heads are preparing for an address by Ken on the company situation. The PR exec, Karolina (Dagmara Dominczyk) advises Ken not to be too aggressive. Karl (David Rasche), Gerri and Roman follow Ken to the meeting. Ken starts with a pep talk, then announces the strategy. It is, ""The Strategy of a Thousand Lifeboats."" Roman is with Ken's PA, Jess (Juliana Canfield). She reports, ""Down three points, and there's an AP headline, 'CEO tells staff Waystar headed for Iceberg.'"" Roman heads for his new office. It is sparse and looks unoccupied. After closing the shades to the outside office space, he walks over to the window. While looking out on the cityscape he begins to masturbate. In a coffee shop Ken meets with an old college chum, Stewy Hosseini (Arian Moayed). Ken is seeking advice, but explains to Stewy that it must remain confidential. He explains the loan and stock price problem. Spotting an opportunity and desperation, Stewy suggests, ""... but what if we came in took the whole thing off your family's hands?"" Kendall is not amused or interested. Stewy points out that Ken and his siblings could cash out and be very rich.

Shiv has an afternoon rendezvous with a fellow political advisor, and one time fling, Nathaniel 'Nate' Sofrelli (Ashley Zuckerman). Shiv insists it is work related and they trade barbs over the politicians they are working for at the moment. Shiv asks for some background information on her step mother, Marcia. You see, Nate, knows a guy. Ken calls Gerri for a stock price status. She informs him that the stock is down two more points and that Sandy Furness is in the building and wants to talk. Ken meets, secretly, with Sandy Furness (Larry Pine) a competitor in the media business. Sandy offers to provide Ken any advice if needed. He alludes to a merger or acquisition, then congratulates Ken on the Vaulter acquisition. Roman informs his brother, ""Have you heard? Stock's gone below 130."" Ken stops by to see Logan. Rava and the children complain that Marcia won't let them see Logan. Marcia stops Ken from seeing his father. Ken again meets with Stewy at the coffee shop. Ken has a proposal, he asks for $4 billion and to remain CEO. Stewy requests some nose candy for old time's sake. In the bathroom, Stewy asks for voting stock and a board seat. Ken asks for an answer. Stewy's answer is cryptic, ""I'm not necessarily totally opposed to this notion."" Ken interprets this as a yes.

Tom takes Greg to his first meeting. Shiv calls to let Tom know her brother, Connor is coming to town. Tom and Shiv meet with Connor (Alan Ruck) on the street to inform him of the background check on Marcia. They are outside Logan's apartment. They take the elevator up and encounter Marcia waiting for them at the door. Shiv tries to strong arm Marcia into a visit with her father. Shiv pushes past her step mother and goes up to see Logan (Brian Cox) in his room. She dismisses Logan's medical assistant, Joan (Lynne McCollough). Shiv explains to Logan that she and Tom will move permanently to New York and that they are engaged to be married. Logan tells Shiv, ""I love you."" Shiv takes her father's hand, which he promptly moves down to his crotch. Shiv pulls her hand back in surprise. Flustered, she tells Logan, ""I'm gonna go get Joan, okay?"" Shiv returns downstairs and encounters Marcia. Marcia tells her step daughter, ""Shiv, I'm a private person. Not all of us are born into good ease. So, if you want to know anything about me, just ask me and I will tell you."" Shiv throws a glance towards Colin on her way out. Marcia it seems has her sources too.

Ken, Roman, and Gerri talk again with Mr. Polk on a telephone conference call. Ken infers that the newly negotiated restructure terms offered by the bank are extortion. Ken tells Polk, ""We don't need you ... I'll be looking elsewhere for a banking partner as we go supersonic. Good bye. And f**k you."" Ken hangs up the phone. Ken has dinner out with his wife, Rava. He is in the mood to celebrate. She asks if the celebration is with the Stewy money. Ken explains, ""I solved the debt issue with private equity money."" Ken is trying for a reconciliation with Rava, but she confesses that she isn't interested. After dinner, they return to Ken's apartment and have sex, but Rava's position on the marriage is the same. Roman meets with his personal trainer, Brex and informs him that his back is out. He asks his trainer if he's insured [for professional liability]. Rava wakes up the next morning in Ken's bed. Ken thinks he can sweet talk Rava into a reconciliation until Rava explains she's gotten a lawyer and wants to keep the divorce on a friendly basis. As Rava leaves, Marcia calls Ken to tell him Logan wants to see him.

Logan is out of bed, sitting in a chair watching the news. Ken kisses his father hello. Ken explains that the stock tanked after Logan's stroke and that there were no good options. He explains that he found a private equity solution. Logan sums up his position by telling Kendall, ""F**king Idiot."" He reiterates, slowly, ""You ... are ... a ... f**king idiot."" Crestfallen, Ken turns and leaves his father's room. Greg walks through the park and sees a familiar face. He saw Ken meeting with Stewy in the coffee shop a few days earlier, now he sees Stewy again, but this time he talking to Sandy Furness. Ken takes the elevator to the lobby. The doorman opens the door and we close with Ken outside on the stoop with people walking on the sidewalk.

Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) is on the company jet reviewing notes. A limo is at the airport to meet him. Ken calls Rava to ask about her attendance at a soiree tomorrow night. Jess Jordan (Juliana Canfield), Ken's Personal Assistant greets him with coffee and asks about his Los Angeles trip. Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron), the company attorney joins Ken and Jess. Logan made an unexpected visit to see Ken. Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) is at home in the bathroom when Grace Roy (Molly Griggs) enters and tries to get intimate but Roman throws cold water on it. Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) and Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) are having breakfast and discussing the upcoming charity dinner, the Roy Endowment Creative New York ball. Roman calls Shiv with news that the senate candidate she's working for has a husband that posted intimate pictures of a part of his anatomy and ATN has it ready to broadcast. Eva (Judy Reyes) and the news director are discussing the picture and how to present the story. Logan is on the phone when Ken enters his father's office. They chat briefly. Logan calls his attendant, Joseph (uncredited) to bring the wheelchair. Ken returns to his office and calls Roman to let him know Logan is in the building. Roman is surprised to find Frank Vernon (Peter Friedman) waiting in his office for him to arrive. Frank explains that Logan asked him to return to Waystar, ""He wants me to show you the ropes."" Shiv meets with Joyce Miller (Eisa Davis), the senate candidate, to get details in order to handle the fallout from the scandal. Joyce suggests Shiv talk to her father.

Preparations are underway at the RECNY venue. Connor Roy (Alan Ruck), Logan's oldest son, is working with the event coordinator on last minute details. Tom and Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) attend the office retirement party for Bill Lockhart (Mark Blum). Bill tells Tom he has one final task before he leaves, then promptly dismisses Greg from his office. Bill explains that he shut off the Wi-Fi and will create a temporary document and print it out, adding mysteriously that he doesn't want to leave anything with his fingerprints on it. This both intrigues and frightens Tom. Bill gives Tom a number to a set of storage files in the depository. Before final disclosure, Bill gives Tom a choice: Full briefing which will make Tom an accessory, or no information and plausible deniability. Roman visits Ken in his office and tells him that Frank is back. Roman resents having a babysitter. Then they discuss the charity event. Ken admits he has no date, but would like to take Anna Newman, the ATN broadcast personality. Tom, crawling around on his office floor, is immersed in the documents Bill left. Joan and Joseph are helping Logan with his PT as Karolina (Dagmara Dominczyk) enters Logan's room. She tells Logan that Ken will announce that Logan will be stepping down from public duties. Logan is upset, and demands the source of the announcement. Connor and Logan take the limo to the venue. Connor suggests he take over and change the charity's recipients.

Shiv meets with Eva regarding the news story. She wants the story ""spiked"" and tries to convince Eva that it is not a good idea to air the story, but Eva believes it is legitimate news and ATN isn't the only outlet airing it. Shiv tries to leverage the Roy name, but Eva responds, ""You know, I wouldn't let any other strategist in the building, let alone this floor. Good to bear in mind that you're only here because your name matches the one carved on the building."" Eva then walks away. Ken meets privately with Stewy Hosseini (Arian Moayed). Before Ken leaves to meet with Stewy, Tom tries to explain the situation at Parks and Cruises, but Ken reminds his soon to be brother-in-law that the best employees are the ones who handle problems without bothering higher management. Ken greets Stewy, when Logan walks in and announces, ""So you're the little schmuck who owns such a big chunk of me."" After an unpleasant exchange, Stewy asks Ken, ""Who's in charge right now?"" Ken assures Stewy that ""Legally and Effectively"" he's in charge. Logan wanders into Ken's office and urinates on the floor.

Tom meets with his personal attorney, then calls Greg into his office to review the ""Death Pit"" documents. Tom reminds Greg that he is family, then insists Greg review the documents that outline a systematic pattern of cover-up of crimes - including: Theft, Sexual Assault, Rape and Murder. Logan returns to the Ken/Stewy meeting insisting that Ken buy a data mining company. Logan asks for Stewy's thoughts. While retrieving some documents in his office, Ken discovers the urine stain on the carpet. Back with his father and Stewy he learns that Logan will be attending the charity event. Ken has Gerri, Frank and Roman witness the urine stain. Frank expresses concern that Logan will be attending RECNY because major shareholders and the press will see Logan's condition, and hear Logan if he should blurt out something inappropriate. While getting dressed for the event, Tom tries to tell Shiv his plan to deal with the Parks and Cruises problem.

The RECNY charity event is underway. People mingle and chat, cocktails are mixed and hors d'oeuvres are served. It is a black-tie event. Logan and his wife arrive and a wheelchair is waiting. When Logan settles into the chair he admits to Marcia, ""I don't think I can do this."" She assures her husband he can. Connor is obsessing over every little detail. Willa (Justine Lupe) is trying not to get too involved. Kendall is chatting with Anna Newman (Annika Boras). Connor is reviewing the teleprompter scroll when he notices something labeled, ""Surprise Logan Retirement Announcement."" Gerri corners Tom and tells him not to proceed with his press announcement on Park & Cruises. Connor talks to Logan to verify that he plans to announce his retirement, ""Just wanted to check that you're aware of Kendall announcing your retirement this evening."" A surprised Logan tells his oldest son, ""There's been a change of plan. Kendall's not speaking. I am."" Connor watches Marcia trying to butter a roll and freaks out about the butter being frozen. Mark Ravenhead (Zack Robidas), an ATN commentator, opens the ceremonies. In the kitchen prep area Connor berates the serving staff. Tom blames Greg for talking to Gerry about his plan to go public with the Parks & Cruises story. Logan sets Roman straight on his role at the company and where he sits with Frank. At their table, Grace Roy is chatting with a waiter, much to Roman's annoyance. Connor informs Ken that Logan will be doing his speech. In a panic Ken consults with Gerri. He asks the company counsel to intervene to prevent Logan from possibly making a fool of himself, but Gerri tells Logan that he will do fine. After a dance number, Ravenhead introduces Logan Roy. Marcia helps Logan to the stage. Logan thanks Marcia for her support and welcomes Tom to the family mentioning his daughter's engagement. To set the record straight about his own role, Logan says, ""And now for one last announcement of the night. I'm officially announcing ... I'm back."" Applause and a standing ovation follows the announcement. As he leaves the lectern he tells Marcia, ""Get me out of here."" Ken tries to talk to his father, but is put in his place by Logan in no uncertain terms. As Marcia leads Logan back to the car, Kendall returns to his date and accuses her of being cold and distant. Anna confesses that her boss, Eva, ordered her to accept Ken's invitation and show him a good time. She explains that she is seeing someone, but since Ken is the boss she felt obligated. Anna walks away and Ken walks over to talk to Eva. Tom and Shiv drive home as Gerri thanks Greg for his wise decision to take her into his confidence. ""Good kid. Smart move. Keep talking,"" she tells Greg. Greg replies, ""I aim to please, ma'am."" Back at Roman's apartment, he and Grace get intimate, while Kendall takes the limo home alone. We close with Marcia and Logan taking their limo through the streets of New York at night.

Frank Vernon (Peter Friedman) enters Kendall Roy's (Jeremy Strong) office and tells him, ""I think your dad might appreciate your input."" Ken snags his brother, Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) to join him. Logan Roy (Brian Cox) is meeting with Karl (David Rasche) and Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron) about acquiring some local TV stations. Roman and Ken both pour cold water on the idea of ""Local News"". Ken reminds his father of involvement by the Justice Department, FCC and the anti-trust issues. When Roman can't answer a simple question regarding the population of Indonesia, Logan tells his youngest son, ""Roman, you're a moron."" Logan calls the meeting over and all but Frank and Roman depart. They witness Logan pouring himself coffee and overfilling his cup, apparently unaware of what he's done. Frank is accumulating these things mentally, as possible ammunition. Greg tries, unsuccessfully, to make small talk with his grandfather. It seems Ewan does not like to fly and tells his only grandson, ""No music. No chatter. Keep your mind on the driving."" It is going to be a long twelve hour drive. Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) and Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) are having coffee at the breakfast table. Tom notices some papers on the table and Shiv tells him it is the pre-nuptial agreement. Tom tells Shiv he doesn't need to read the document, just sign it. Shiv is not amused, ""Tom, you have to look at it."" After a bit of back and forth he agrees to have his lawyer review it.

Tom is meeting in his office with someone who is coordinating the document destruction and removal. He discusses the removal of data files, email, and servers. He suggests the shredding be done on Thanksgiving Day. This man tells Tom to get a person who is both dependable and expendable. Tom calls Greg on his cell phone and learns Greg is in Canada and driving his grandfather to the city. Tom lets Greg know he has a little job for him when he gets back into town. Roman is exercising with his personal trainer when Kendall demands to know about the Logan pouring coffee incident. Roman advises trying to destroy Logan - a family tradition. Logan arrives home and is greeted by his third wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass) who informs him that, ""Ewan is definitely coming to Thanksgiving."" Logan doesn't believe it, but Marcia assures him it is true. She tells Logan she spoke to his brother. She adds, ""It's not good to have rifts in the family."" Kendall is at his apartment and asks Frank, ""Look, so, we both know you didn't come back out of love for my father ... what's your plan?"" Kendall reminds Frank that his father's recent behavior and business decisions indicates he's incapable of running the company. On the drive over to Logan's apartment, Tom calls his mother on the phone to wish her a Happy Thanksgiving, and apologize for not being there in person this year. Shiv shakes her head no to a suggestion they will visit Minnesota for Christmas or New Years. Shiv chides Tom about his lawyer being his mother. Tom reminds Shiv that she is a highly respected lawyer in the Twin Cities. Tom informs Shiv that his mother, ""says that the pre-nup is a little unconscionable."" Frank makes notes as Kendall counts the votes to remove Logan as CEO. Frank reminds Ken that, ""Ewan is never there, so he's not voting."" They agree they can't count on Gerri for support. It is clear Frank doesn't like the direction the move is taking. Marcia is seeing to the details in the dining room, then greets Tom and Shiv who've just arrived. Ewan and Greg arrive. Out on the balcony Roman, Grace Roy (Molly Griggs) and Greg are sharing a joint. It seems the movie that the studio produced is a major flop at the box office, just as Roman had predicted. His time at the studios was an unpleasant one for Roman, and this movie reminds him again how much so. Tom informs Greg, ""I need you to go to the office today."" Greg is told, ""Sign out some boxes, do a little shredding, meet some lovely guys."" Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) arrives with his girlfriend Willa (Justine Lupe) and Gerri. Ken questions the wisdom of Connor's choice to bring Willa - the prostitute. Shiv adds, ""Do you think she charges overtime for holidays?"" Frank asks Kendall, ""What the f**k is Ewan doing here?"" He informs Ken that it complicates any plan for a no confidence vote. They now suspect Marcia is exercising an undue influence over Logan. Ken talks to his Uncle Ewan and explains that Logan isn't completely himself. Shiv strolls into the living room to chat with an obviously drunk Grace and Roman. It is clear Shiv has little respect or regard for Roman's wife. Marcia's son, Amir (Darius Homayoun) arrives. Greg is surprised to learn that Connor's date is a prostitute and the entire family knows. Tom gives Greg the details of his task. Connor tells Willa he wants to help her with her writing career, ""And the financial aspect of this isn't even a concern."" He proposes an exclusive arrangement to give her, ""More free time for the theater.""

Greg arrives at the Waystar-Royco headquarters building. Logan walks downstairs and greets his brother Ewan. Ewan tells Logan, ""You look terrible. Haggard."" Marcia calls everyone to the table. Greg goes to the archive and gives the clerk the list of boxes and his pass. Greg asks about the record keeping procedure for document retrieval. Marcia proclaims that dinner will be ""family style"". Roman can't help but opine, ""Ooh! Family style. What, almost like we're a family."" Logan makes the ceremonial cut into the turkey before the kitchen staff takes the bird back to the kitchen to cut it up. Rava Roy (Natalie Gold) and the children arrive late. Her son, Iverson (Quentin Morales) prefers not to join the family at the table, but Sophie Roy (Swayan Bhatia) does. This sets Logan off - he demands his grandson's presence, ""Get him in here. He has to do as he's told."" Greg calls Tom. He is having second thoughts about the legality of this task. Tom hangs up on Greg. Greg stares at over a dozen boxes of documents. Ken and Rava are upset with Logan and each other. Marcia urges them to join the rest for dinner. Greg starts the shredding but decides that making copies of key documents could be useful insurance. After dinner, Logan shows Willa his collection of WWI medals. This starts an unpleasant exchange between Logan and Ewan that escalates. Ewan expresses his embarrassment of ATN and all that Logan stands for politically. The rest of the family observes the exchange with slack-jawed awe. Then Ewan springs it, ""I was told that you were ready to apologize."" Ewan looks directly at Marcia, then turns his gaze to Logan and adds, ""You lied to me. And you humiliated me."" Ewan walks away. Roman's sarcastic comment, ""But other than that, you had a nice time?"" gets a pithy reply, ""Go f**k yourself."" Logan looks at Marcia and says, ""Your idea."" Greg is finished. He has a stack of empty boxes, a bin full of plastic bags full of shredded paper, and places the copies of documents in his backpack. In the basement, a black van pulls up, and two men exit and fill the van with the bags of shredded paper.

Ewan gets his hat and coat. He tells Ken, ""I knew this was a mistake. I'm going home."" Ken follows Ewan down in the elevator. Ken confides to his uncle that Logan is erratic and making bad decisions. He tells Ewan that, ""at the next board meeting, there's going to be a vote of no confidence."" Ken is shocked to learn that Ewan will not back any such move, adding, ""... but he's still my brother."" Tom and Shiv discuss the pre-nup in the kitchen. Tom mentions that there is no provision for infidelity. She is more pragmatic and realistic than mid-western values Tom and infers that if something does happen they should be adult about it. Roman was eavesdropping and counsels caution. He tells Tom that Shiv advises professional liars - politicians - and that he should keep that in mind. Ewan returns to the apartment to get his walking stick. As Ewan walks towards the elevator, Greg exits. He tells his grandson, ""We're leaving."" After an exchange, Ewan departs and Greg remains. Ken makes arrangements for a company driver to take Ewan back to Canada. Logan now turns his attention to his moody grandson. He orders the child into the dining room. Rava and Kendall object. Upstairs, Grace and the children are watching a movie. Roman freaks out. It is the Thanksgiving movie the studio released, despite Roman's best efforts to kill before it was made. He asks to speak to his wife. After a testy exchange of issues, she brings up the fact that they only have sex every six months.

Tom discretely asks Greg if everything is done. Marcia calls the family into the Dining Room for pie. At Tom's suggestion, each person at the table is asked to express what they are thankful for. To Ken and Roman's surprise, Marcia's son, Amir, expresses his thanks to Logan for appointing him the head of one of the European divisions - Animation - an under performing one. This pretty much clinches the ""undue influence"" evidence. Marcia suggests a game with the children. The game is called ""I went to Market"" and each person adds an item to the list of things they've bought. The next person in turn adds an item and must repeat everything on the list the previous persons have added. When it comes to Logan he blanks out. Iverson is next, and tries to grab the can in Logan's hand. Logan strikes the child in the face with the can. All hell breaks loose. This is the final straw for both Ken and Rava. Out on the balcony, Gerri joins Ken and asks about Ewan. Ken does not trust Gerri, and does not want to tip his hand. While Gerri expresses her love for Logan, she adds, ""I work for Waystar, not Logan Roy. Are you thinking of moving against him? Because if you are, I've spoken to Frank and I've seen all I need to see. Good night."" While Ewan takes a Waystar limo back home, Grace packs her bags and leaves Roman. We close with Kendall out in a park having a cigarette.

Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass) are on the company jet flying to Washington, D.C. to see the President of the United States. Karl (David Rasche) is reviewing some paperwork. Logan complains that he has to go down to see the man, instead of the other way around. Ken stops at a restaurant where his brother, Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin), the company CFO, Frank Vernon (Peter Friedman), and company general counsel, Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron) are waiting. Ken tells Frank that Stewy is in. The four again review the votes and where each member of the board is likely to side. Roman thinks it is time to proceed, but Frank counsels caution and advises Ken to get a guarantee from three board members: Lawrence Yee, Uncle Ewan Roy, and Ilona. Ken should make a personal appeal to all three. Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) gets a phone call confirming the Park & Cruises situation is fully contained. He tells Shiv (Sarah Snook) the good news, although Shiv is still unaware of the details [this gives her plausible deniability if asked.] Shiv is watching a news conference with her boss, Senator Joyce Miller (Eisa Davis). She asks Tom, ""Should I stick with her? Is that a president?"" While Shiv weighs the pros and cons of sticking with someone she thinks has no political future, Tom asks about the wedding plans and arrangements. Shiv informs Tom that after a call with her mother, she decided to have the wedding in England. Roman agrees to talk to Lawrence, while Ken will handle the others. Logan and Karl discuss strategy of the TV stations acquisition approach they plan to propose to the president. Shiv calls Tom to inform him she's flying to Washington, D.C. On his way to his office, Tom passes Greg (Nicholas Braun) and invites him out to dinner. Greg is suspicious, as he and Tom have a very strained relationship. A White House aide (Esther Chen) shows Karl and Logan to a waiting area. Before the pair can sit, another aide (Bret Lada) informs Logan, ""Mr. Roy. I am so sorry, but the president passes on his sincere apologies. He is currently dealing with a matter of homeland security."" Logan has been snubbed, and he is furious.

Roman meets with Lawrence Yee (Rob Yang) and his boyfriend Tatsuya (Jake Choi) at a restaurant. Roman gets to the point quickly, ""What would you say if I told you that there was gonna be a vote of no confidence tomorrow? Kick out the old man, in with the new guard. Romey and the homey."" Lawrence expresses only mild surprise. Shiv meets with an old acquaintance, Nate Sofrelli (Ashley Zukerman) at a restaurant. They trade barbs over their respective bosses. Nate works for Senator Gil Eavis. Nate knows Shiv from way back and asks, ""So, go on, Shiv, what is this?"" Shiv proposes that Nate join her on team-Joyce. Of course, Shiv never states what is really on her mind or her motivations, but Nate knows how she operates. Greg is having dinner out with his grandfather, Ewan Roy (James Cromwell). Greg asks Ewan why he's in town and Ewan explains that Ken is calling a vote of no confidence, and as a board member he is in town to vote. Ewan plans to distance himself from the palace coup and advises Greg to do the same. Marcia calls Kendall and invites him to dine with his father, as she has another commitment. Ken agrees. Greg joins Tom for a second meal. Lawrence asks Roman, ""If I was going to come in with you, what's your vision?"" The best Roman can articulate of his vision of the future is, ""Tasty morsels from groovy hubs."" Lawrence is unimpressed by the Roy brothers, but does agree that, ""I'm on the side of change."" Both Roman and Ken have been so sure of their reading of Stewy and Lawrence, that they see and hear what they want, rather than the non-committal responses they've been hearing. Ken calls Roman to inform him about his dinner with Dad. He asks Roman where Lawrence stands and is assured by his brother that Lawrence is in.

Greg tells Tom that he really isn't hungry because he already had dinner with his grandfather. He tells Tom that Ewan is in town for the no confidence vote against Logan. Tom registers surprise, but Greg assumed that Tom knew of the Roy brother's machinations against their father. Richard (Richard Vernon) meets Ken at the door of his father's apartment, and informs him that his father is on a call in the den and will join him shortly. Tom calls Ken to inform him of Ewan's presence in town. Ken meets with Logan, unsure what the old man knows about the vote tomorrow. Logan tells Ken about the presidential snub. Ken joins Logan for dinner - a hamburger. Tom and Greg go to a pop-up nightclub. On the drive home, Ken calls Frank to sum up the votes. He expresses some reluctance to actually proceed. Ken even suggests putting it off until the next quarter, but Frank reminds him, ""Ken. You made this happen. You might never get another shot."" Ken calls Sarita Shenoy (Surina Jindal) to confirm that her mother, Ilona Shenoy (Jacqueline Antaramian) will not attend the board meeting tomorrow. Ilona has been very sick [cancer] lately and Ken suspects that she will vote for Logan, so her absence is sort of a vote for Ken. Back at Nate's apartment, he and Shiv continue their discussion, which includes both of them getting married soon. The topic turns to sex for old time's sake, but by the next morning when Shiv is ready to leave, it is clear they decided not to indulge. Nate makes a final pitch for Shiv to join team-Gil. Nate suspected all along that Shiv was thinking about jumping ship and joining what he considers the winning team.

The next morning, Ken and Frank discuss the vote while taking the limo on the way to the office. Jess calls Ken. She informs him that Ilona Shenoy is on the line. Ilona tells Ken she will be dialing in for the board meeting. This puts Ken in a panic. Ken wants to meet face to face with Ilona to convince her to vote with his bloc. Frank asks if there is time for Ken to go to Long Island and get back in time for the board meeting. Ken takes the company helicopter out to see Ilona. Sitting in a chair next to her hospital bed, he explains his plan. Ken discovers when he gets back to the helicopter they are grounded. The pilot (Julian Wheeler) explains, ""Sorry, Mr. Roy, the skies are closed. Temporary Flight Restriction. There's a possible terror threat."" Ken tries to cajole the pilot, but is informed, ""Sir, if we take off now, we can be shot down by an F-16."" Ken chases down the departing limo and asks how long to get back to the city.

The members of the board are congregating, waiting for the meeting to start. Ken is stuck in a tunnel in traffic. He calls Gerri to ask her to stall the start of the meeting. It is now noon, and Logan arrives. As Frank calls roll, Kendall jumps out of his limo and runs through the tunnel. Late to the meeting is Ewan Roy. Logan notices a vague item noted as ""performance issues"". Ken has called in and is walking through the city in gridlock. Ken calls for the vote of no confidence and Frank informs Logan he must recuse himself from the vote and leave the meeting. Logan refuses. Frank calls for the vote, but the board sits quietly looking around uncomfortably. Ken votes yes, followed by Frank. Asha (Bisserat Tseggai) votes yes. When Stewy is asked, he explains, ""... that this is a family matter, and abstain."" A few vote no, then Ilona phones in her vote of yes. To everyone's surprise, Ewan votes to support his brother, Logan. Next up is Lawrence, who like Stewy tells the board, ""I don't have a dog in this fight, Kendall. I abstain."" Roman is now on the spot and shows his true colors - feckless and cowardly. In an outright betrayal of his brother, and under intense psychological pressure from his father, he votes no. Ken runs into the room, breathlessly, and asks about the vote. He is informed by Logan that he lost the vote. Logan immediately informs Kendall, Frank, Asha and Ilona that they are fired from the board. Security escorts Ken out of the building. Finally, Logan directs his wrath at Roman and asks, ""And what the f**k am I gonna do with you?""

Shiv gets back to the apartment and is surprised to find Tom in bed. He claims he's working from home and must have been poisoned. Shiv detects alcohol. She takes a call on her phone and is informed of the board action at Waystar-Royco. Greg stumbles downstairs to join Tom. Shiv gets a call from Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) who is back in New Mexico. Shiv is upset, not at the vote, but the fact that she wasn't privy to the plot. She is especially disappointed that Tom didn't tell her and storms off. The President calls Logan, but still miffed, he puts the president on hold. Logan tells the president he took care of his own terrorist, his son Kendall, then asks for help with the FCC.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660914/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,Roman faces technical difficulties. Tom marks his territory. Kendall hits rock bottom with tragic consequences.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Mark Mylod'],"['', '']",[],"['wedding', 'hostile takeover', 'rocket launch', 'car crash', 'reference to machiavelli', 'stuttering']",[],"Guests arrive for Shiv and Tom's wedding reception at a historic English castle. While photographers snap outdoor pictures of the wedding party, Ken and Stewy converse about their planned corporate overthrow of Ken's father Logan. Connor wants his girlfriend Willa to be in the photos. Shiv doesn't like it; she thinks Willa's presence in the photos will look bad in the future, if Willa's reputation sours. Connor insists.

In a private room, Ken reviews Stewy's conditions for takeover. They argue about who will break the news to Logan; neither of them wants to do it. Their assistant, Jess, accidentally prints the takeover document to the wrong printer, somewhere on the castle grounds. Ken becomes highly agitated at this, then has to apologize to his pre-teen son after yelling at him not to come into the room, before realizing who it was. Ken's estranged wife Rava suspects, out loud, that he might be high, but Ken assures her otherwise. Jess finds the mislocated printout. Stewy gives it to Ken and he carries it through the ornate castle rooms full of animated wedding partiers, and knocks on the door of Logan's suite.

Logan's wife Marcia answers; she invites Ken in. Logan is grooming in the bathroom in his underwear. Nervously, Ken delivers the news. Logan angrily crumples the document and throws it in the toilet. He demands to know why Ken is doing this. Flustered, Ken can't explain himself adequately, and exits the suite. Logan retrieves the wet document and talks with Marcia about the situation. Logan is worried that he can't stop the takeover.

Gerri, the Roys' general counsel, is talking to Senator Eavis. An aide summons her to go meet with Logan. Connor walks up and smilingly confronts Eavis about his support for socialism, hyper-inflation, and dead babies. Eavis politely excuses himself and walks away. Shiv saw the whole thing and didn't like it; she says Eavis will be the next U.S. president. Then Roman confronts her about being on the wrong political side. Roman gets a call about his Japanese satellite launch. He goes to a bathroom alone and watches the livestream. The rocket explodes on the launchpad.

Back in their private room, Ken and Stewy talk. Ken is a little shaken, but Stewy is pleased that they did it, and gets drinks for both of them. He asks Jess to leave them, then breaks out some cocaine for Ken.

Logan talks with Marcia about whether he should leave the party early to handle the takeover threat.

Connor takes Willa aside and tells her he wants to run for U.S. president. She's stunned, and asks him if this will take money away from the funding of her play.

Logan's ex-wife Caroline introduces Roman to a top U.K. police commissioner, and old friend of the family. Tabitha asks how the rocket launch went; Roman says great.

Logan joins the party and approaches Ken and Stewy. Stewy wants to keep it civil; Logan responds sarcastically. A young, male member of the catering staff tries to refill Logan's drink, but accidentally spills on him. Logan responds angrily and tells him to get out of the event and don't come back.

Gerri confronts Roman about the rocket explosion; Roman pretends he didn't already know. Roman tells her that he pushed the launch forward despite others' concerns; she says that's not good, legally, especially if anyone died.

The waiter who spilled on Logan appears to be fired by the staffing company; they give him a cash severance.

Night has fallen; the formal reception begins. Logan gives a speech in which he doesn't mention Ken's plan, but slyly swipes at Ken in a manner no one but Ken will notice. After the music resumes, Gerri has a whispering huddle with Logan and Marcia about how they plan to deal with the hostile takeover. The party goes on, with funny, happy speeches by Roman, Shiv, Caroline, and Tom.

Nate tries to talk with Shiv; she becomes hostile and tells him to shove off. As she walks away, Logan intercepts her and tells her she needs to come talk with Ken.

Connor takes Ken to a private room. Shiv and Roman are already there; they and Connor confront Ken about the takeover. They argue bitterly; Ken says we have to do this. Shiv is especially offended that he did this on her wedding day. Logan arrives, and the argument continues with acrimony. Ken leaves and goes to his suite where Stewy is hanging out alone. Ken finds that the cocaine has run out. He asks Stewy for more, but Stewy suggests restraint, and besides he doesn't have any.

Back at the party, Roman tries to talk Connor out of running for president. Roman consults with Gerri and finds to his elated relief that no one died in the rocket disaster, there were just a few serious injuries.

Outside in the dark, Greg wishes Ken good luck with his takeover, and starts to talk about the cruise-line coverup. All Ken wants to know is where to find some coke. Greg doesn't know anything about that, but tells Ken about the coverup document copies he secretly kept. Ken smiles and compliments him on his smarts. Greg points Ken to some guys around back who might have drugs.

Shiv and Tom are alone in their suite. Shiv tries to talk about the takeover, but Tom just wants to talk romantically about her. Shiv emotionally breaks the news that she had a fling with Nate while she and Tom were a couple. Tom gets her permission to eject Nate from the party. Shiv also says that maybe monogamy isn't for her. Tom's a little taken aback, but they both still want to be married. They make love.

The waiter who spilled on Logan smokes a joint behind the castle. Ken approaches and asks about it, and about the firing. The waiter tells him that he isn't fired, and in fact was paid for the whole night and then some, so it's no big deal. Ken asks if the waiter can hook him up with some ""powder.""

A light rain has begun. Tom coldly accosts Nate at the party, threatens to break his legs if he doesn't stay away from Shiv, makes him pour his glass of wine back into the bottle, then tells him to leave the party and not come back. Nate, intimidated and a little drunk, does as he's told. Then Tom relaxes and joins the dance floor.

Ken and the waiter sit in a car. The waiter does a line of white powder. He offers some to Ken, but Ken realizes it's ketamine, not cocaine. He asks where he can get coke; the waiter says he knows a guy not far away. The waiter is too stoned to drive, so Ken takes the wheel. They drive onto a dark winding road in the countryside. Ken informs the waiter that he's rich, and they joke that the waiter should kidnap Ken for money. Ken is not an experienced driver, and is even more unfamiliar with the British car. As he becomes distracted trying to work the stickshift, the waiter sees a deer directly ahead of them. He grabs the wheel and makes the car swerve; it crashes through a fence and into a pond. The car quickly sinks, but Ken manages to get out. He tries to dive down a few times to save the waiter, but cannot.

Soaked and stunned, walking and running through the muddy, bog-like countryside, Ken makes his way back to the castle, hiding from view when a car drives by. He is startled when fireworks and British fanfares go off in the sky above the castle. He manages to sneak back to the outdoor entrance of his suite, then discovers his keycard is missing. He breaks a tiny window at the top of the door, cutting his arm while reaching in to release the latch. Inside, he strips, bathes, washes his clothes, and dresses in dry clothes. Pocketing his duplicate keycard, he returns to the party, doing his best to seem normal and cheerful, and making sure to be seen by people he knows. His cut bleeds a little through his white shirt sleeve, but no one notices. His children and ex-wife get him to dance.

The next morning, Ken wakes up and stares at the cut on his arm. He dresses and goes to the breakfast buffet, where Greg informs him that a possibly high waiter died the previous night in a car accident. One of Logan's security men quietly tells Ken to come talk with Logan. In a richly decorated lounge, Logan is waiting with Marcia and Amir. Logan tells Ken about the caterer's death. Ken acts innocent, but then Logan tells him about discovering a keycard to Ken's room near the accident site. Marcia and Logan suggest that maybe the waiter broke into Ken's room and took the card. Ken very nervously plays along, trying not to say much. Logan says Amir saw Ken ""rather damp."" Logan dismisses Marcia and Amir so he can talk privately with Ken.

While Ken starts to cry, Logan tells Ken that his takeover plan must now end, and he must go to rehab: if anyone finds out that he was involved in this accident, he'll be ruined for life. But Logan is happy to make the whole thing disappear, to keep Ken's future bright, and the family together. He hugs Ken while Ken sobs uncontrollably."

Bowen failed to appear for sentencing, and authorities found a note indicating that he was on the run. He said that he was not going to prison for a crime he had not committed. The FBI was immediately brought on to the case.

Bowen purchased books on how to disappear and how to create false identifications. He decided to erase his fingerprints with acid from a pool supply store. He then befriended homeless men and assumed their identities. This way he could get both an ID and a job.

Bowen found work as a contractor. he found comfort in a relationship with a woman. His girlfriend, however, had a best friend who disliked Bowen. When the relationship ended, Bowen moved on. But his ex-girlfriend's pal did not.

On December 22, 2004, the friend spotted Bowen's picture on the ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and contacted authorities.

He flees to Florida and embraces his fugitive life. He funds his hobbies by robbing banks. It is his love of karoake that gets him caught.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Evan Cecil'],"['', '']",[],['investigation'],[],"After forty years of marriage, Joe Crouch wakes up one morning and unable to bring himself to tell his wife of their financial ruin shoots her while she sleeps.

After a phone call confession, he flees to Florida and with his new identity of a retired widower, he is able to evade the Feds for months. Crouch embraces his life as a fugitive and begins to fund his hobbies of golf and karaoke by robbing banks. Ultimately, it is his love of karaoke that gets him caught and puts an end to his life on the run.

His wife, Betsy, followed him into the lights. She knew the drill. She was his prop for a sappy ballad of love's regrets that Elvis recorded in 1972, and he reached his arm around her as the piano tinkled the opening chords.

Crouch gazed at his wife of 40 years and sang as though he meant it:

""Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have. And maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should have .... But you were always on my mind. You were always on my mind.""

About 30 hours later, at 6 a.m. on June 25, 2001, Crouch, 58, positioned a pillow over Betsy's head as she slept in their bed in North Memphis. He pushed a .25-caliber revolver into the fluffiness and pulled the trigger four times.

He then put his golf clubs in the trunk of Betsy's new Mercury, as though leaving for vacation. As he drove away that morning, he called his son-in-law and said, ""I just shot Betsy. I'm sorry.""

Young love gone wrong

Betsy and Joe Crouch were high school sweethearts, marrying when she was just 16. She went to work as a medical receptionist after their two children were in school, and he built a successful Memphis mortgage and loan company, Metro Credit Center.

In the late 1980s, after their children were grown, Crouch began to avidly pursue adult pleasures. As often as four nights a week, he and Betsy could be found singing karaoke around Memphis, his mettle lubricated with gin-and-tonics.

He was a decent singer and generous tipper, so k-jays on his regular karaoke circuit gave him plenty of stage time.

Crouch's repertoire featured heavy-hearted ballads, including ""You Were Always on My Mind"" and ""Stand By Me,"" as well as a rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" straight out of Elvis' jumpsuit era. Betsy's talent and élan did not match her husband's, but she managed a passable version of her signature tune, Patsy Cline's ""Crazy.""

At about the same time, Joe Crouch began to indulge in less wholesome passions: gambling and hookers.

He lived like a high roller on solo getaways to Las Vegas, Atlantic City, New Orleans and nearby Tunica, Miss., hiring prostitutes to join him at the gaming tables and in his hotel bed.

And when he wasn't handing money to croupiers, card dealers and comely hired hands, he was losing as much as $100 a hole on golf matches with buddies.

His jones for the lush life began to catch up with him in 2000. He was broke, and Metro Credit was sinking from Crouch's under-the-desk borrowing.

By spring 2001 he had begun papering Memphis with bad checks - some $30,000 worth in all. He gave one excuse after another when checks bounced, but on Wednesday, June 20, a terse letter from the Tennessee attorney general warned him that he faced prosecution.

Crouch serenaded his wife the following Saturday night and murdered her early Monday morning.

His motivation was a head-scratcher.

""That's the missing piece of the puzzle,"" police Lt. Mickey Williams told the Memphis Flyer newspaper. ""He could have just left. People do that all the time.""

While on the lam, he sent his son and daughter a series of self-serving confessional letters, first insisting that Betsy was dying of cancer anyway. The mercy-killing excuse proved to be hogwash, so he next claimed that he simply couldn't allow her to learn that he was a financial failure.

One letter to his daughter, Teresa Wampler, signed ""With deep love,"" noted, ""Some would say that what I did was selfish and was a coward's way out.""

That bizarre missive was trumped some months later when she received a karaoke CD from her father - 10 songs that he had titled ""Just for You and Maybe Just for Me."" The accompanying note read, ""Who knows, maybe [my grandson] will enjoy them someday.""

For 20 months, Crouch eluded arrest while gambling, golfing and singing his way along the Gulf Coast, sometimes wearing a gaudy fake mustache but more often with no attempt at disguise.

On the small screen

In February 2003, Crouch was a featured fugitive in an episode of TV's ""America's Most Wanted.""

Detectives believed Crouch's karaoke habit would get him caught, and they played that angle hard on the show. Wherever he's living, they said, Crouch is singing karaoke.

They were right. Karaoke enthusiasts in Daytona Beach, Fla., who saw the show realized the wanted man, known as Jay Nelson, had been performing at the area's karaoke clubs for nearly a year. He had been telling everyone that he was a widower - from cancer, not spousal homicide.

A karaoke promoter, Lloyd Eaton, dropped a dime, and Joe Crouch was arrested at his Daytona apartment on March 15, 2003.

""He never missed a show,"" Eaton told the Memphis Commercial Appeal. ""He was an avid karaoke person.""

It turned out Crouch had supported himself with robbery. Police searching his apartment found a legal pad with his own notes on 40 stickups he had pulled across Florida. He kept the log to avoid returning to the same location. He had begun with meager holdups of mom-and-pop stores but progressed into a series of six bank jobs that netted him $88,000.

Cops found Betsy's purse in the Mercury's trunk, pinned under golf clubs.

He didn't seem troubled about being arrested for his wife's murder. But he said he'd miss golf. He whimsically told a cop, ""At least I parred my last hole.""

Crouch pleaded guilty a few months later and got a life sentence. He would be eligible for parole in 2060, if he lives to be 118.

That, he said in court, ""is not likely to happen.""

But after 13 months of successful robberies, Loya's luck runs out when one robbery goes wrong. It's the latest in money tracking technology that leads investigators to Loya and ends his spree.

There was a slew of real-life takeover bank robberies right after the movie Heist, with everyone made to lie down so the thieves could get straight to the money. But passing a note is still the most common method in the States, followed by telling the cashier Give me the money or Ill blow your head off! I used notes for my first two robberies, then realised they were a distraction."

He saw his life disappear all in one sentencing. Silvers decided to escape. Using a roll of toilet paper, a black permanent marker and some tape, Silvers fashioned what could pass as a gun. Along with two other prisoners, they overpowered a few guards and were able to calmly walk out of prison.

Silvers tried to keep his nose clean and stay out of trouble on the outside. His face often appeared on the news for the get away especially as the two other escapees were captured.

Silvers fled to Mexico where he set up an Internet cafe and computer repair shop, and started teaching English at a nearby school. He fell in love and thought he was in the clear for good. Then, US Marshal Jason Wojdylo found inspiration to track him down. He got confirmation from family members that Silvers was probably somewhere in Mexico, but they wouldn't share where. On a tip, the Marshals sent an agent to Veracruz. Once there, he started asking around about who the gringo in the area was and where he lived.

The Marshal soon knocked on Silver's door, asking about teaching his child English. A positive ID was made, and soon after, Kerry Silvers was captured on his way to drop off some rented videos at his local video store. Surprised by the capture, Silvers resisted and started to fight back, but when agents explained who they were and why they were there, Silvers gave up the fight and was quietly escorted back to prison."

A disagreement over some stolen motorcycle parts developed between Marvin and Richard Hawk. The argument was settled one night when Carson came through the open door of Hawk's mobile home carrying an AK-47. Carson opened fire, killing Hawk.

Witnesses immediately identified Carson as the shooter. With authorities and the rival biker gang close on his heels, Carson decided it was time to get out of the state. Carson cut his hair and shaved his beard. He traded in his usual uniform of jeans and black Harley Davidson t-shirts for Bermuda shorts, tank tops, and flip flops. He even lost 44 pounds. Carson had friends sell off his guns, motorcycles, and boat and send him money to live on.

In October of 1992, Carson became tired of life on the run and was no longer fearful of doing the time in prison, Carson decided to risk returning to Florida. He headed back to his home town. Lt. Farmer received a tip as to where Carson was living which he passed on to local law enforcement. Local sheriff's deputies put the house under surveillance. Finally saw him come out of the house and surrounded Carson. The deputy asked him for his ID. Carson responded, ""You know who I am."" The deputies drew their guns and arrested Carson. After 18 months on the run, they finally had their man."

Ray and Ann try to send them back to where they were before they burn up, and Merlin the Magician appears in the control room and tells them to stop. Everyone in the control room freezes as Merlin stops time, and he flies down He looks around and dismisses the equipment as simple toys, then cause Doug and Tony to appear with a gesture. The two men appear, froze, and Merlin welcomes them home.

Merlin says that they'll do, and introduces himself as soon to be the court wizard for King Arthur. He plans to press Doug and Tony into service helping Arthur, and warns that they could die. He says that when they next meet, they won't remember their meeting but will do whatever he asks. Merlin makes them disappears and tells the team that they shall meet again. He disappears and time restores flowing normally, and they see Doug and Tony appear in the past. The two men see a castle in the distance and figure they're in Europe in the Middle Ages. As they look for a place to stay out of sight, two Viking approach them. The four men fight, and Doug and Tony triumph. The Vikings run off, and Doug figures they'll be back with reinforcements.

A young Arthur steps out and tells Tony to put down the spear he's grabbed. Tony refuses, and Arthur figures they're warriors. He says that the land is being invaded by Viking and Arthur can use strong men. When Doug refuses, Arthur calls them cowards. Merlin appears and tells Arthur that he's there to help him. Arthur doesn't know who Merlin is, and Merlin says that they will be allies in the future. Doug and Tony find Merlin familiar but don't remember their earlier encounter with him. Merlin says that they will fight for Arthur, and Doug and Tony agree.

Merlin disappears, and the crew in the control room watch them. Ray and Ann tell Kirk that they're building power to shift Doug and Tony, and it will take at least fifteen minutes. Ann determines they're on the Coast of Cornwall in 544 AD. In the past, Doug asks Arthur why he's leading them away from the castle. Arthur says that the Viking have taken the castle, and they're his ""army"" to retake it. More Vikings attack them, and the Viking leader Wotan watches. The Vikings stab Doug in the chest, apparently killing him, and the others outnumber and surround Arthur and Tony.

Wotan tells his men to hold, and realize who Arthur is. When Arthur says that he's sworn an oath of vengeance against Wotan for killing his father, Wotan laughs and slaps Arthur, then promises that they'll beg for a merciful death from him.

Ann and Ray tell Kirk that Doug is dead, and his body was dragged away. Now that their friends are lost, they've lost their fix. Kirk tells Ann to restore the fix on Tony, then tells Kirk that Tony and Doug dropped into a Viking raid that common in that period. Ann gets a signal on Tony, who is chained to a wall in the castle. He manages to grab a nearby torch and starts burning the chain, weakening the links. Once he's free, he sets fire to the hay on the floor and yells ""Fire!"" When a Viking runs in to put the fire out, Tony knocks him out.

Kirk and Ray see Arthur nearby, and Kirk wonders if he's the miracle they need. They have enough power and Ray wants to switch Tony, but Kirk tells her not to and to start a probe for Doug. Ann warns that they might lose Tony, but Kirk figures that it's worth the risk to save Doug. They get a reaction in the monitors.

Doug wakes up and find his wound being tended to by a woman and Merlin. He vaguely remembers Merlin, and the woman says that Doug in the castle of King Leodegran, and she's his daughter, Guinevere. Merlin brought Doug there, and Doug realizes that Guinevere is the ""real"" Guinevere. Doug admits that he's indebted to Merlin, and Merlin agree. He tells Guinevere to get Doug clothing and they've no time to waste. Merlin commands Doug to sit up, and Doug discovers that his wound is gone thanks to Merlin. The wizard tells Doug that his name is well-known in Doug's time, and he knows everything about Doug and Tony. With that, he disappears.

Tony slips through the castle and chokes a Viking, forcing him to say where Arthur is. Once the Viking says where Arthur and passes out, Tony takes his keys and goes to the dungeon where Arthur is. He knocks out the guard at the door, then goes in and cuts Arthur free. Arthur is too fatigues from his long captivity to move, and he tells Tony that there's a secret room where they can hide. Tony helps him up and Arthur takes them to the secret room. They go in, closing the door behind them... unaware that a guard saw them.

A messenger arrive at Guinevere's castle and reports that Tony and Arthur were seen at the castle. Doug wants to go to them, and Guinevere warns that he'll need a plan. He figures that he'll go to the castle, scout the place, and come up with a place, and tells Guinevere that she should stay.

In the control room. Kirk figures that Doug was saved by a miracle. Ann figures that she can keep the hold on Doug, and establish one on Tony.

Tony tells Arthur that he knows Arthur will eventually escape.

Ann gets a fix on Tony, and Kirk tells her to switch both of them. Merlin appears and tells them to stop. When Kirk tells Ann to do it, the controls spark and knock her back, but don't harm her. Merlin demands a name from Kirk, and says that he's Merlin. He explains that his job is to make sure that prophecy is fulfilled, and Kirk suggests that he does the same thing. Merlin says that Doug and Tony must stay where they are, and Ann is forbidden to move them. Ray isn't impressed by Merlin's magic, and he says that he will convince them. Merlin makes Ray disappear and then makes him reappear atop a nearby console. Kirk asks why Merlin came there, and says that Doug and Tony won't die unless Kirk wastes more of his time. When Ray threatens to move Tony and Doug, Merlin advises him not to and disappears.

The Viking takes Wotan and his men to the hidden room. They go in and capture Tony and Arthur.

Doug goes to the castle, and hides when he realizes someone is following him. Guinevere is there, and Doug steps out and grabs her. Vikings approach, and one grabs Guinevere while the others overwhelm Doug.

In the control room, Kirk and Ray tell Ann to switch the two men now that they have a fix. Ann is reluctant to disobey Merlin's orders, but Ray figures that Merlin can't affect them as long as he's not there. Ann still refuses, and Ray brushes her aside to do it. The controls spark, knocking Ray unconscious, and Kirk sends Ann to get medics.

The Vikings take Doug to the cell where Tony and Arthur are, and chain him to the wall like they are. Meanwhile, the Vikings take a tied-up Guinevere to Wotan and leave them. Wotan says when he's King of England, he will barter her off to a nobleman in return for his loyalty. He says that he will crush all resistance in England, but first he must be crowned. Wotan cuts Guinevere free and tells her to make herself comfortable, then leaves, locking the door behind him.

Arthur is unconscious and Tony wakes up. Doug figures that Merlin will help them escape. Wotan and two of his men come, in, and one of the men throws water on Arthur, waking him up. Doug warns that Guinevere's father will come to rescue her, but Wotan is eager to have them come so he can defeat them. Wotan tells his bowman to shoot them and leaves, and the bowman shoots Arthur in the chest.

Merlin appears and tells Tony that he was detained, and reverses time to save Arthur. The panicked bowman runs out, locking the door behind him, and Merlin says that he didn't want to reverse time and there is still much to be done. He frees the three men and says that a throne must be won by men, not magic. Merlin says that he's used up most of his magic and only has enough for one more spell, tells Doug and Tony to use their future knowledge and teleports away.

Tony and Doug use thumbscrews to anchor down a pot on the door, fill the pot with water, and wait for it to overheat. Arthur wants to stay and fight, and Doug figures that Guinevere's father would send an army if they can get him. Tony tells Doug to go to Guinevere's father, while Tony and Arthur will search for Guinevere. The pot explodes, blowing the door open.

At the project, Kirk tells Ann that Ray is in the infirmary. He says that an emergency crew of electricians are checking the control to make sure they're safe.

Arthur and Tony sneak through the castle and Arthur finds Guinevere and takes Tony there via a secret way. Outside, Doug finds the king's men and leads them to the castle, where he says they will attack. Merlin appears and asks what Doug plans to attack with. The wizard warns that Viking only fear other Vikings, and he has Vikings. Merlin says that they will storm the castle with Vikings, and gives Doug and the knights Viking clothing. He warns that he's out of miracles and the rest is up to Doug, and teleports away.

Doug and Tony go to the turret of the tower where Guinevere is, dispose of the guards, and Arthur swings down to Guinevere's chamber on a rope. He tells her that the guards outside the door will go to join the battle, and someone will come to get her. He then climbs back up to the top of the turret, and tells Tony to signal Doug and his men while he goes to make the Vikings' defenses worthless.

Doug sees Tony's signal and tells his men to attack. Tony leaves and one of the Vikings wakes up and sounds the alarm. Tony hides as the Vikings run past, then goes to Guinevere's chamber and leads them out. Wotan arrives and draws his sword, and the two men fight. Tony finally runs Wotan through, while Arthur drops a portcullis, sealing the Viking in a courtyard until Doug and his men break in.

At the project, the electricians confirm the controls are safe to use. Kirk tells Ann to switch Doug and Tony.

Merlin joins Doug and Tony, and they watch Arthur sit with Guinevere. The wizard tells the two travels that the king was very grateful to Arthur for driving away the Vikings, and his giving him Guinevere's hand in marriage as well as a round table. Merlin say that Arthur also told him that Tony and Doug will be the first Knights of his Round Table. Doug and Tony are switched away, and Merlin shrugs and says that the age of miracles has just begun."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0568456/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"A stockbroker recently evicted by his wife starts receiving tomorrow's edition of the Chicago Sun-Times. This offers the opportunity to win at gambling, or to use the foreknowledge to help people.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Michael Dinner'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"""What if you knew, beyond a doubt, what was going to happen tomorrow?""

Gary Hobson (Kyle Chandler) is on a Chicago train, he has a bag full of groceries and roses. He arrives home and tries to open the door with his key, but finds it does not fit into the lock. He calls up to his wife, Marcia, telling her ""Happy Anniversary!"" She calls back down to him, ""Head's up!"" and throws out a suitcase full of his clothing.

Some days later, Gary awakens in a hotel to the radio discussing politics, and Gary's friend Chuck Fishman (Fisher Stevens) arrives, asking if he'd heard from Marcia. Gary tells him she won't take his calls. He tells him to face it, she threw him out, he's living in a hotel, and Gary needs to face the fact that it is over. They hear a cat meow, and a thud at the door. Upon opening the door, they see a cat sitting on top of a newspaper in front of Gary's room. Gary finds it strange, since he did not order the newspaper. He looks at the headline, which says the President agreed to trade talks with Japan, but Gary mutters that he heard on the radio earlier that the President was refusing the talks. He turns the paper over to see the score of a basketball game, opens the paper and sees financial information about the price of wheat that seems odd, as well as a headline about a homeless man who won twenty-three million dollars from the lottery. ""Some guys have all the luck"", he mutters. He grabs his coat and keys and leaves for work, throwing the newspaper in the trash as he walks out the door.

On the way to work, he stops at a newsstand on the street, but tells the owner, Sherman (Milo O'Shea), that he already read the paper. Sherman gives him a paper anyway, and as Gary walks away, Sherman asks him who he thinks will win the basketball game. When Gary tells him who already won last night, Sherman looks confused, and looks at his paper which clearly say that the game is happening that evening.

Gary arrives at work, and greets the receptionist, a blind woman named Marissa (Shanesia Davis-Williams). He asks her if she got her seeing-eye dog, and she says that it fell through and she is back on the waiting list. Gary's boss Phil Pritchard (Marc Vann) arrives, berating him for arriving late, and baiting him about the lack of profits he has been making as a stockbroker. While he and Chuck are talking about life, Chuck's attention is caught by the price of wheat, which is going up. Gary tells him ""Don't buy it, it went up thirty points yesterday"". Chuck reminds Gary that yesterday was Sunday, and the market was closed. Gary says that he read it in the paper just this morning, and as they watch the stock ticker, they both look at each other and wonder what is going on.

They arrive at Gary's hotel room looking for the newspaper, but his trash has been emptied with the maid service. As they rush to the alley that has the dumpsters, a trash collection truck is driving away. Later, in a bar, Chuck admonishes Gary for losing the paper, and while Gary is skeptical, Chuck asks how the events Gary read that morning could be unfolding just as he read them, sports scores they saw on the television, the price of wheat, and when Gary asks where the paper could have come from, Chuck theorizes that the ""newspaper fairy"" left it. Gary shakes his head, obviously thinking his friend is nuts, and says he wants to call his wife. As Gary gets up, a man walks up to him and serves him with divorce papers.

Walking home that night, Gary stops by a store with televisions in the window, advertising the Illinois lottery. A bum walks up to him, begging for change, and as Gary gives him some coins, he watches the lottery broadcast. A homeless man stands next to the lottery presenter, and is given a giant check for twenty-three million dollars, the very same photograph that Gary saw in the newspaper that morning...

The next morning, Gary hears a thunk at the door, but opens it and there is nothing there. As he closes the door and goes back into his room, he hears a cat meowing, and another thunk. He opens the door to find the same cat sitting on top of the newspaper as the previous morning. Standing in the hall, he opens the paper and reads the date: It is tomorrow's date. ""Anything can happen..."" he mutters as he walks back to his room.

As he greets Sherman on his way to work, Sherman asks him if he wants a paper, showing him the headline about the trade talks with Japan. ""Nope, saw that one already"", Gary replies. Sherman remarks that Gary looks much better, his clothes are pressed and clean, and asks Gary what the change is. ""Don't know exactly yet, but I'll find out"", Gary replies. He tells a passing citizen not to believe the weather on his boom box that is reporting zero chance of rain, telling him ""You're going to need an umbrella"".

At the office, Chuck walks up to Gary, telling him how sorry he is that Gary has been going through such a hard time, what with Marcia and all, and then takes a second look at Gary, noticing he is holding the newspaper, looking at the financial section. ""It came?"" he asks. ""It came"", Gary replies. Chuck shouts and celebrates, asking about the financial information in the paper, and the trades Gary is doing. Mr. Pritchard arrives and when Gary cannot explain why he's making the trades he is, tells him to cancel them, but they already went through. He tells Gary that his employment is not looking ""rosy"", and asks how much money they lost. Chuck tells him they lost nothing, all the trades Gary made went up in value. Mr. Pritchard asks how big they bought into the stocks, and Gary says ""one share each"". Pritchard tells Gary that he'll be fired for such a joke, and Gary tells him he quits, and walks out.

As Gary leaves, he invites Marissa to lunch. They arrive at a horse racing track, where Marissa places a two dollar bet, and the two of them have lunch. Marissa tells him she places the same bet every day, a shot at a dream. Gary looks thoughtful, and reading the paper, goes to make a bet before the race begins. As he watches the race unfold, he is astonished when his horse, a longshot, wins the race. ""Incredible..."" He places another bet on the next race, another longshot, and he wins even more money with that race. He puts all his winnings on another horse for the next race, but everyone behind him hears what bet he placed, and they all bet on the same horse. As he watches the race, his horse loses. He cannot believe it. After a few moments of disbelief, the announcer says that the winner was disqualified, and his horse becomes the winner. He gives the winnings to Marissa as she boards the train home, telling her ""get the dog you've been waiting for.""

That night at a bar, he and Chuck argue about the newspaper. Chuck cannot believe that he gave all his money to Marissa. Chuck tells him this paper is a powerful tool for getting rich, and Gary cannot let it get away. As they walk home, the two discuss possibilities, wondering if more than one person gets the paper, and Chuck still insists it is an opportunity to make money. As they walk towards the newsstand, they see Sherman, lying on the ground, with police and EMTs around him. As the EMTs place him on a stretcher, Gary tries to cross the police tape at the scene, and shouts to an officer, ""What happened!"" The officer replies, ""You want to know, read tomorrow's newspaper."" Gary, visibly distraught, opens his paper, and finds a headline that reads ""Local News Dealer Accident Victim"". As it begins to rain, Gary is upset, saying ""I missed it. I missed it.""

Morning arrives, and finds Gary sitting on a bench overlooking the water. He appears to have been sitting there all night. Disheveled, he returns to his hotel room and finds the cat and the newspaper at his door. Entering, he finds Marissa sitting there with a very large German Shepherd. ""It's about time"", she says and asks what's wrong with him. He asks her what she named the dog, ""Spike"" she said, and asks what his cat's name is. ""That's not my cat"" he replies. She admonishes him for treating her like she's stupid instead of blind, after quitting his job, taking her to a lunch he didn't eat, and shoving money into her hands. She knows something is wrong, and insists that Gary tell her. As he explains, she wonders where the paper comes from, wondering aloud ""maybe it comes from God."" adding ""The world is full of miracles Gary, you don't always need eyes to see them."" Gary, still bothered by Sherman's accident, is bitter, saying he's not too big on miracles right now, and wonders ""why me?"" He tells Marissa he doesn't want the responsibility of this news, doesn't want to be a hero, and asks her what he's supposed to do with it. ""You're supposed to do whatever you can"", she replies, handing him the new paper that arrived that morning. Looking at the headline, which reads ""9 Killed in Bank Holdup"", Gary reads the article, detailing the events of the bank robbery. He adamantly tells Marissa he can't get involved in a murderous robbery attempt, asking her what he's supposed to do about it. She suggests he go to the police. ""I'm not going to the police!"" he firmly states as they leave his hotel room.

Later, Gary walks into the police department, with Marissa and Chuck, telling the desk Sergeant that he wants to report a ""future situation"". After being sent to see Detective Tagliatti, (Felicity Huffman) he tries to explain about the robbery, without sounding insane. As he describes what ""will happen"", the detective begins to look at him oddly, and asks him how he knows what will happen in the future. Gary tells her he cannot explain. She dismisses his report, sending him on his way. As he leaves, she looks at him with a suspicious expression on her face.

Gary, Marissa, and Chuck go to a diner, where Marissa is disappointed that Gary doesn't try harder to stop the tragedy, and Chuck tries to get his hands on the paper to see sports scores. After the paper falls to the floor, Chuck picks it up, sneaking peeks at it, and rushes off. Marissa leaves as well, disgusted with Gary's lack of action. Gary sits in the booth, and as he looks down at the paper, notices the headline changed... it now reports that ten people die in the robbery. ""Marissa!"" he whispers. As he tries to find the page that has the full story, he realizes it is gone, and Chuck took it. He rushes out of the diner looking for Chuck, who is gone.

Chuck is in a sports bar, he's made bets on sports scores, and has won thousands of dollars. Gary finds him, and orders him to hand over the newspaper page he took. Gary grabs it and runs out. Chuck races after him, Gary says it is important, and asks Chuck how much money he made. Chuck tells him he has a few thousand in his briefcase from his bets. Gary takes Chuck's money, and rushes off to the bank. He finds Marissa and her dog there, and tries to get her to leave. Marissa tells Gary to relax, that she told the bank to be on the look out. They turn, and see the man who is supposed to rob the bank. As the man moves to pull a gun out of his pocket, Gary steps forwards and shouts ""Alright, nobody move!"" The man who was originally going to rob the bank looks confused, and Gary looks at him, telling him not to do this. The man runs, and Gary follows him into an elevator where the man points a gun at Gary's face.

Frank (Tom Noonan), the bank robber, takes Gary to the roof, ordering him to get out of the elevator. Frank is clearly panicking, as his plan has gone wrong. The police arrive, along with Detective Tagliatti. The police have Marissa, thinking she is a lookout for the robbers, although the police are clearly confused as to who is robbing the bank, and who is the hostage the bystanders are reporting. Chuck arrives and makes a scene, but Tagliatti sees him and recognizing him from earlier, tells the officers to let him through. She tells the officer in charge to ""keep an open mind"" about what is going to happen. She asks Marissa and Chuck what is going on. They tell her about the newspaper article, and the officer in charge shakes his head, and walks away in disgust.

On the roof, Frank asks Gary if he's cop, and why he's there. ""Because people were going to die!"" Gary shouts. He tells Frank he knows all about him, about his troubles, why he was going to rob the bank, and that Gary knows that he didn't mean to hurt anyone. Frank asks Gary how he could know about losing everything, to which Gary replies ""Try me.""

On the ground, the officer in charge orders his officers to take the shot if they get it. Frank and Gary sit on the roof, discussing life, Gary tells Frank it would be a shame to lose his wife, his children, everything he has, just by making a mistake. Gary assures Frank that nobody saw his gun, and hands him the money from Chuck, telling him to take it if it will help. Frank asks Gary if money helped him, and Gary says no, it didn't. Frank lays the gun on the ground, sighs, and asks what they do now. Gary stands up, leans over the roof's ledge, and shouts down to the police to hold their fire. Gary empties the briefcase of money into the air, and he and Frank watch as money falls down all over the bystanders. Chuck is frantic, ""That's my money!"" he shouts as he tries to catch it, while Marissa smiles. Frank and Gary are both arrested, and Tagliatti tells him she's going to find out what's going on. Gary is later released, as they have no reason to hold him. Tagliatti asks Gary if he wants to change his story, ""to what?"" Gary asks. ""To anything remotely believable"", she replies. ""Nope."" he answers.

Later in the hotel's lobby, Gary turns in his keys, and when Marissa asks where he's going, Gary replies ""Where they can't deliver"". Chuck takes the key, and sits in Gary's old room all night waiting. In the morning, there is a knock on his door, and as he rushes to it, expecting the paper, he finds a pest control employee that enters saying he has to spray the room for roaches.

At a remote cabin in the woods, Gary sleeps, his phone off the hook, clearly wanting no contact with anyone. He awakens in the morning and hears a cat meow. As he opens the screen door, he sees the cat, and the newspaper...

Later, Marissa walks along a street, and Gary shouts her name. ""What took you so long?"" she asks. She tells him Sherman is fine, and will be back at the newsstand soon. Gary tells her he needs to find a new place to live, one that takes cats..."

Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['handgun', 'answering service', 'waitress', 'hooded man', 'redhead', 'motel', 'movie star', 'ballistics test', 'season premiere', 'series premiere', 'cigarette case', 'gun', 'pillow case', 'blue eyed woman', 'movie studio', 'preliminary hearing', 'identical guns', 'confession to murder', 'motel owner', 'scene of the crime', 'car']",[],"Waitress Evelyn Bagby (Whitney Blake), the titular restless redhead, is being spied on by a hooded man as she enters her apartment building. In her apartment, she opens a cigarette box and finds a .38 revolver, so she calls Perry. He explains how to check if the gun has been fired recently - it hasn't. Evelyn wants help because she was recently acquitted of stealing jewelry from movie star Helene Chaney (Gloria Henry) at a motel in Riverside, CA. Perry tells her to go to a hotel, but on the way a car driven by the hooded man tries to force her off the road, so she fires the gun, although not aiming at him. The car with the mystery driver veers off the road.

Evelyn arrives at Perry's office convinced that she just escaped a murder attempt. Perry calls Paul to trace the gun's ownership and goes to the scene of Evelyn's escape to find a crash scene and LAPD Homicide already there. He gets a peek at the hood found on the victim. It's a pillow from the apartment building where Evelyn was staying. When Perry is back at his office, Lt. Tragg storms in, asking who sent Perry to the murder scene. He reveals that the victim was named Harry Merrill, and he died from a .38 bullet in his head. Tragg leaves without seeing Perry's client, but promises ""I'll be back."" Once he's gone, Evelyn explains that Merrill, originally named Lester Gladden, was a man who stole $1500 from her five years ago in a ""you ought to be in pictures"" scam. Two months ago, Merrill walked into the cafe where Evelyn works, and she demanded her money back. He said she should come to the Eucalyptus Grove motel in Riverside, but instead of getting her money, she walked into trumped-up charges of stealing jewelry.

The next morning, Paul reveals that the gun was one of an identical pair bought in Riverside by movie mogul Mervin Aldritch (Ralph Clanton). Tragg arrests Evelyn, and soon after Paul shows Perry a marriage certificate for Gladden/Merrill and Hester Charles (now famous as Helene Chaney). Aldritch, who is now engaged to Helene, admits that he paid Merrill $10,000 not to make trouble by claiming he hadn't been properly served papers in his divorce. Perry hands Aldritch the .38, on which he had earlier put a small file mark, and asks Aldritch if it's his personal gun, or its mate, which he bought for Helene. Aldritch goes to check if his own gun is in the glove compartment where he left it, then returns saying that gun is missing. He hands a revolver back to Perry, but it's the other one, which Perry hadn't marked. Perry then goes to the crime scene and manufactures false evidence by firing the new gun into a post and a tree. On his way to the office, Perry is met by Tragg, who takes the gun, and says that Merrill's pillow hood had no bullet hole, so he'd been shot, then planted in the crashed car.

At the preliminary hearing, Perry takes advantage of the fake evidence he planted to convince the court that the gun without a file mark, which he truthfully claims was never in Evelyn's possession, was the murder weapon. He calls the manager of Evelyn's apartment building to the stand and asks her if anyone else in the court had rented a room from her. She points to Louis Boles (Vaughn Taylor), hen-pecked manager of the Eucalyptus Grove motel, but states that he used the place not to sleep in but to watch Evelyn's apartment. On the stand, Boles denies a series of accusations from Perry, but then lets slip that there was no registration card for Merrill on the night of the jewelry theft because he'd never signed one. After that, he confesses that he was in league with Merrill to frame Evelyn, but Merrill reneged on the bribe he'd promised. Boles then schemed to murder Merrill for the $10,000 payment he'd received from Aldritch, so he could get away from his shrewish wife. In the office, Perry explains to Della and a relieved Evelyn that Boles shot Merrill, planted the gun in Evelyn's apartment, became the hooded driver in the hope that Evelyn would fire the gun but not hit him, then set up the fake crime scene."

His wife Doris (Hillary Brooke) is afraid and decides the next day to file for divorce. 364 days later, when the divorce is about to be finalized, Frank Maddox (John Archer), Pete's business partner, meets with Doris Cole at her home in Santa Barbara. Together they arrange to force Pete to pay Maddox $500K (more than double the fair price) to buy his share of the business, or Doris will stop the divorce, thus preventing Pete from marrying his true love, Lucille Mays (Helen Mowery). Pete's niece and secretary Edna Hammar (Nancy Hadley) calls in Perry, who arranges a meeting with Maddox and his lawyer Ralph Duncan (Thomas Browne Henry), in an attempt to stall while the divorce decree goes through. Also present are Pete's half-brother and partner Phillip Kendall (Harry Hickox), and Edna's fiancé Steve Harris (Darryl Hickman). The haggling stretches into the night, so Perry suggests that Maddox and Duncan spend the night at Pete's house. Perry returns to his office, and Steve volunteers to go to Santa Barbara to keep an eye on any comings and goings at Doris's house. Meanwhile, Pete and Lucille prepare to fly to Las Vegas so they can get married the instant the divorce decree is final.

Later that night, Edna encounters Maddox in a hallway. He explains that he is exchanging bedrooms with Phil Kendall, because the bed in the guest room was too small for him. At 11 PM, Maddox goes out to a pay phone to call Doris, bringing her up to date on the progress of the deal and promising to call again at 9:30 AM. The next morning, Perry returns to Pete's house, but it's Lt. Tragg who answers the door. Phil has been found stabbed to death in the guest bed, and Tragg is very interested in Pete's whereabouts. Perry learns that the divorce decree went through. Steve reports that around 3 AM, he overheard Doris's end of a phone call from lawyer Duncan, who apparently just rehashed what Maddox had discussed with Doris at 11. Perry tracks down Pete in Vegas, where Tragg appears and arrests him, with the aid of local police.

In court, Maddox testifies that he saw Pete wide awake and holding a knife at 3:05 AM. Perry pokes holes in the credibility of his account. Duncan testifies about the little he knows, and Perry pelts him with questions about the ethics of a lawyer dealing in what is essentially a blackmail scheme. Duncan words his responses carefully, claiming innocence while avoiding anything that could be perjury. He does state categorically that he never had any contact with Doris. Steve is called as a hostile witness and has to testify that he noticed a carving knife missing from the sideboard around 10 PM, when Pete was still up. On cross-examination, Steve testifies about the 3 AM phone call, pointing out on a photograph where he stood in order to overhear Doris. Perry accuses Steve of making the phone call himself, posing as Duncan, in order to give the impression he was in Santa Barbara all night. Instead, he came back to Pete's house just long enough to murder Phil in a way that framed Pete. Thus, his fiancée Edna would inherit the business, and he would eventually get control of the money. Steve denies all this, but then Perry reveals that the photo on which Steve identified his precise location wasn't even of Doris's house! Later, as Pete and Lucille leave on their honeymoon, Perry explains that Duncan's testimony, so firm about not contacting Doris although he was slippery about everything else, made Perry suspect that Steve was the liar."

They see Sybil's husband Bruce (William Roerick) kissing flashy blonde Roxy Howard (Greta Thyssen). Sybil explains that the house is a model home on land owned by Sylvan Glade, a housing development company. They've stopped work on building houses because they think they've found oil on the land. Roxy has a friend in the company who's letting her live in the model home while she tries to get Bruce to financially back drilling for oil. Sybil wants her husband back and thinks that if Perry can block the oil deal, Roxy will become a nag about it and she can win Bruce back by being understanding. Sybil will put up money so Perry can become a stockholder, and he agrees.

Attending a Sylvan Glade board meeting are company president George Lutts (Richard Hale), his son-in-law Herbert Dean (Robert Cornthwaite), Sam Elkins (Tyler McVey), Bruce, Roxy, ... and a new stockholder. Perry points out that the company charter prohibits going into a business other than home building without unanimous approval of stockholders. He says he's unalterably opposed and then leaves. Bruce tells Roxy that means the deal is off, but she insists he not give up so easily, threatening to tell Sybil about what they've been doing.

George Lutts now realizes he made a big mistake in selling stock to Perry. When he discusses it with Herbert and George's daughter Vinnie Dean (Jean Howell), she tells him what she's learned from Herbert about Bruce and Roxy at the model home, and Sybil spying on them. He realizes how this connects to Perry, and the next day he approaches Sybil while she's spying again. He threatens to tell Bruce, but a gunshot is heard (although not very loud). George grabs his throat and falls, dead. Sybil frantically runs to her car and speeds off, but she soon drives into a ditch and can't get the car to move.

Later, Sybil has been explaining events to Perry in his office, having taken a cab there. Perry asks to see the cab receipt for $2.95, then drives Sybil to her car. A gun that should be in her glove compartment is missing. Perry involves Paul, some of his operatives, and Sybil's good friend Ruth Marvel (Claudia Bryar) in a scheme to obtain another cab receipt from the same driver and for the same fare, but innocently driving around Beverly Hills. Sybil keeps that receipt in her purse.

At Sybil's preliminary hearing, Lt. Tragg testifies that powder burns prove that Lutts was shot from 18 to 24 inches away. Sybil insists to Perry that it was a distant shot. The cabby, Jerome Keddie (James Gavin), testifies about picking up Sybil at her car and identifies the receipt police found when they arrested her. On cross-examination, Perry makes Keddie identify his trip sheet, which shows a different trip number that the one on the receipt (due to Perry's earlier scheme). Perry asks if he can unequivocally identify Sybil as the fare on the first trip, and he admits he can't. The judge declares the Keddie's testimony is compromised. Burger is furious and moves for a dismissal of this hearing until he can obtain more evidence.

Paul has discovered that the one location with a clear shot at where George Lutts had been standing is a Sylvan Glade tool shack. It's locked, so Perry goes to Herbert Dean, but he says he doesn't have the key either. While Perry's there, Vinnie Dean admits that her father was hard to work for due to his stinginess, but Herbert kept the job for her sake.

Back in court, ballistics expert Alexander Redfield (Norman Leavitt) testifies that two shots, with different types of cartridge, were recently fired from Sybil's gun. The first shot matched the fatal bullet, but no bullet was found from the second. Perry questions how a that shot could have possibly missed from close range. He proposes that the first, fatal, shot could have been fired from a distance, and the second shot fired a bit later at close distance with a blank, to create the power burns. Redfield admits this would work, except that the paper wadding used to keep the blank's power in place would have penetrated the skin and been found by the coroner. Perry produces a gun (which Redfield silently pushes away when Perry inadvertently points it at him) and fires it at a piece of fabric. It produces a pattern of powder marks, but no hole from the wadding, to the amazement of Redfield. Burger calls Ruth Marvel as a hostile witness, and gets her to admit that Sybil had asked for her help in obtaining the second cab receipt. Perry uses his cross-examination to claim that this was all just a test of whether cabby Keddie could really recognize Sybil.

Paul reports that Roxy unlocked the shack, removed a bunch of junk (including small sandbags, iron pipes, clamps, two-by-fours, and a stool), and dumped it in a gully near the model home. The stuff isn't there now, so Perry asks Paul to obtain a similar collection of items.

Bruce takes the stand and testifies that he owns several guns. He had loaned one to Roxy, who later returned it. Perry is about to ask Bruce to check serial numbers of his guns when loud squeaking disrupts the court. It's Paul, bringing in the duplicate junk, covered up and on an old hand-pushed truck. The judge (Morris Ankrum) castigates Perry for not waiting for a recess to bring this in, or at least using a less squeaky truck, then calls the recess. Paul says he felt like an idiot, but Perry says he intended the noise to further upset a nervous witness.

When the hearing resumes, Bruce testifies that he checked his serial numbers, and one of the guns in his possession isn't his. It could have been the one he lent to Roxy. She's called to the stand, clearly unhappy about it, and denies having switched guns. Perry uncovers the junk, now revealed to be assembled into a makeshift shooting stand. He repeatedly presses her about why she threw out the stand (not the same one, but Roxy doesn't know that). Finally, she breaks down and says that Sybil was the intended target, to stop her from blocking the oil deal, which would have made Roxy rich. However, she wasn't the shooter. Perry says that the real murderer was someone who was followed back to his own garage and found the disassembled stand still there, but didn't get a chance to warn Roxy. She points to her accomplice and the real killer, Herbert!

Back in Perry's office, we learn that Sybil and Bruce have reunited and gone to Mexico for a second honeymoon. Tragg arrives with Perry's shooting stand and points out that it's his responsibility and he can't just put it in the trash. However, Tragg will handle the matter for a price. Perry guesses that the price is revealing how he shot that fabric without making a hole. He just used a little chalk instead of paper wadding. The power would have blasted it away, leaving no trace. Tragg stalks out, telling his officer, ""Get me out of here before I use that thing (the stand) on myself."" Perry, Della, and Paul get a good laugh."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0673246/?ref_=ttep_ep4,,"Perry Mason, Della Street, and Paul Drake head to a small town to defend a young man who is charged with poisoning a blackmailer. They learn the man's father was executed for killing a man in the same town eighteen years earlier.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"It's a hot day (like pretty much every day) in Logan City as Lois Reed (Carol Kelly) arrives on the bus and is met by private investigator Donald Briggs (Harry Landers). He has hired her just to show up in the town, and takes her to her room at the Sands Motel, next door to his own room. Later, Briggs visits Wilma Adams (Olive Blakeney) , who was also summoned to Logan City and is staying at a boarding house. He's there because Wilma's son Marv (Gary Vinson), a chemical engineering student, is engaged to Helen Waters (Carolyn Craig), daughter of local big-shot Clyde Waters (Victor Sutherland). Briggs says he knows part of a secret about Marv's father, and will uncover the rest of it thanks to the presence of Lois Reed. He says that $5000 will make him less curious. Marv arrives, having learned that his mother is in town. Briggs leaves, but Marv quickly sees that the P.I. has upset Wilma, so he follows Briggs outside and they get into a fight. It's broken up by Police Chief Glass (Rusty Lane).

Briggs next reports to Clyde, who initially hired him to look into the mystery surrounding his prospective son-in-law's father. Briggs tells him that Marv's father was actually Ben Devereux, a local man who was executed for murder. Clyde pays Briggs for his services, but Briggs wants another $5000 to keep the matter quiet, and again mentions that Lois Reed is in town. Later, Clyde visits Perry in L.A. and explains that he has nothing against Marv, but merely wondered why the boy seemed to know so little about his father. With Briggs intent on blackmail, it seems matters have spun out of control, so he needs help from Perry and Paul. He adds that Devereux was convicted of murdering his partner 18 years earlier. Perry will look into the trial record, while Paul looks up Briggs.

In Logan City, Perry returns the transcript of the Devereux trial that he has borrowed from Judge Meeham (Nolan Leary), who was the prosecutor in that case. Perry questions why both Meeham and the defense attorney permitted a ""Miss X"" who was mention several times in the case, was allowed to remain anonymous. The judge replies that she wasn't involved in the murder or its motive, so it was agreed not to have her suffer embarrassment. Perry is at a filling station intending to return to L.A. when Chief Glass drives up and insists that he follow him to the Norris ranch. There, meets retiree George Norris (Don Beddoe) and his wife Martha (Paula Winslowe). She says that the man Devereux killed was her first husband, David Latwell, and she doesn't want all this mess dug up again.

Perry next goes to the Waters ranch, where he, Clyde, and Helen observe Marv entertaining some schoolchildren. He pours some ""magic water"" on a duck and sets the bird in a water trough. After a moment, it sinks, and one of the children quickly rescues it. Marv reveals to the adults that what he poured on the duck was a chemical that removes oil from the duck's feathers. Perry gets a call from Paul, who has tracked Briggs to Logan City, and they agree to visit Briggs that evening. When they arrive at the Sands Motel, they encounter Lois, who heard them drive up and thought it was her cab. She says that she heard someone visiting Briggs half an hour earlier and believe they may have left together. Once she returns to her room, Perry and Paul enter Briggs' unlatched door. They find some old newspaper clippings and notice a strange odor. Then they spot the man himself - dead.

Later, as the police investigate, Dr. Creel (Joseph Forte) says that Briggs was killed with poison gas - potassium cyanide pellets tossed into a container of hydrochloric acid would do the trick. The Chief, adding this bit of chemistry to Marv's earlier fight with Briggs, plus Lois having spotted Wilma's truck (which her son had been borrowing), decides that the young man is his chief suspect. He heads to the Waters ranch, where Marv had been staying, but Perry knows that Marv was about to return to school. He and Paul drive to the bus stop and find Marv there. Perry drives off with him, and hears from Marv that he never saw Briggs again after their brief fight. Chief Glass pulls them over, arrests Marv, and admonishes Perry for his interference.

In jail, Perry can't get Marv to take interest in his own defense. He suggests that Marv is afraid the proving his own innocence will shift blame for the murder to his mother. After that, Marv won't talk to Perry any more. Perry gets a call from Lois, who tells him to ask Judge Meeham who really defended Devereux. He does just that, and learns that while another man handled the case in court, the defense was prepared by George Norris. He's the one who agreed with Meeham to leave ""Miss X"" unidentified.

Perry calls on George, who first explains that what is now the Norris ranch was at the time of the murder co-owned by Devereux and Latwell. However, they argued constantly. Perry asks if George agreed to leave Miss X anonymous to sabotage his own case, but George admits that that was merely the result of his shortcomings as a lawyer. He still doesn't know if Devereux was guilty or innocent. The motive for protecting Miss X was that her father was the beloved Reverend Logan, for whom the town was later named. However, Miss X left town at the time of the trial and didn't even return for either her father's funeral or the town renaming ceremony. She's been married and divorced, and is now Lois Reed. Perry visits Lois, who tells him that Briggs offered her $1000 just to show up in town for a couple days. About two hours before his body was found, he visited her and she told him she quit. He wrote down three names on a piece of paper and circled one, calling it the ""murdering goose who laid a golden egg"". Lois never got a look at what he wrote.

In court, pompous D.A. Harry Cortland (Philip Tonge) is having Helen testify to Marv's knowledge of chemical tricks. When Clyde testifies to the ""drowning duck"" trick, Cortland suggests that Marv might have let the duck drown if the boy hadn't intervened, but Perry objects and Judge Meeham sustains him. During a recess, Paul gives Perry a report on Wilma's bad heart - it's surprising that she's lived even as long as she has. Perry uses this fact to get Marv to cooperate at least to the extent of telling his attorney where Wilma has been staying.

Paul and Della go there, but find her dead (from natural causes). Next to the body is a small strongbox, which Paul and Perry later open with Marv's permission. Inside are various papers that Wilma had collected from Ben's desk, with photos of Lois and an incomplete letter that basically says ""My Dear, We both know our marriage is over. I love someone else. We can discuss a settlement after I return from my weekend trip."" Perry visits Lois, who's a bit drunk. She laughs at the idea that she'd marry the short, dumpy, square, and bald Ben Devereux. Her affair was with Latwell, who shared a desk with his partner. 18 years late, she sounds like she's still in love with him.

The next day, Lois testifies in court about how Briggs brought her to Logan City in what she finally learned was a blackmail scheme against multiple people, but she doesn't know whom. Dr. Creel testifies about poisoning with HCl and KCN. He says that these are commonly found around a farm for pest control, and that using them would not require a chemist's special knowledge. Paul enters with a copy of a newspaper clipping from Briggs' room at the Sands. Perry calls Martha Norris to the stand. She repeats her testimony from the Devereux trial: When her husband was murdered, she was laid up with a self-treated sprained ankle from a tractor accident. When she claims she and Latwell were in love, Perry introduces the incomplete letter, which was never shown in the earlier trial because it would have required calling ""Miss X"" to explain its significance. Perry suggests that Briggs was murdered because he discovered that Martha killed her husband and intended to blackmail her. She repeats her ankle alibi, but Perry introduces the newspaper clipping into evidence. It's dated the day of the murder and has a photo of Lois and Latwell at the county fair, with Martha standing in the background. Martha breaks down, but says that her husband was better off dead than with someone like Lois.

Later, Marv complains that the town refused to believe his father. Perry sets he shouldn't let his resentment color the rest of his life. Marv asks how it could not, when the whole town also turned against him. Perry reminds him that Helen is part of the town. The couple look into each other's eyes, just smiling, until Della says ""Don't just stand there. Do something!"" As they kiss, Della looks satisfied with herself, while Perry and Paul examine some papers."

Fran barges into Perry's office and says that she wants Perry to break the ""spendthrift trust"" of over $1,000,000 that her father set up, leaving Norton in complete control of Fran's money. He'll use his power to cut Fran off if she marries before age 25 (in about a year and a half), but Fran wants to marry now. Perry says he'll need a day or two to investigate. Later, Paul reports that 5 years earlier Fran's widowed father had to track her down when she ran off with a bellman. Convinced that his daughter was too impulsive, he set up the trust - and died not long afterward. Lately, Fran has been seen in the company of artist Rod Gleason (Brian G. Hutton). Perry visits Rod and surmises not only that he was that bellman, but that he and Fran have secretly married. Fran emerges from hiding and admits that Perry is right. He has also correctly guessed that they can't keep the marriage secret for another 18 months - Fran is pregant.

Perry visits Norton and says that a court might have something to say about Norton's arbitrary use of his power as trustee, but he gets nowhere. He reports the discouraging news to Fran and leaves. At 11:06, Rod is walking outside the mansion when a car pulls up. It's Judge Purley, who is giving Crinston a ride. Since Crinston doesn't expect to be very long, the judge decides to wait in the car so he can keep listening to a prize fight. Graves lets Crinston in, and a few minutes later the lawyer returns to Purley's car. Over the noise of the radio, a voice is heard, and Crinston asks Norton what he wants. The reply is that he wants some papers Crinston has at home, and will send Graves along in the judge's car to retrieve them. Graves squeezes into the front seat, and as they start to drive off he turns around to put a briefcase in the back. He suddenly shouts to stop the car, saying that through the study window he saw a man come up behind Norton. They return, and the police arrive.

Later, the police surgeon (Larry Thor) tells Lt. Tragg that Norton never knew what hit him, and ""an ash tray got him over the left ear."" Crinston, Purley, and Graves tell what they know. Graves doesn't know what to say when Tragg asks him if he could recognize the killer. Fran and Perry are also in the mansion, and she tells him that Rod was there to take her bags - she was moving in with him. She admits Rod was angry with Norton and insisted on talking to him - but insists that Rod would never have committed murder. At his apartment, Rod tells Perry that he headed to the study, but heard voices so went out to the garden to wait until Norton was alone. After the exchange of voices between the house and Judge Purley's car, he went back to the study and found Norton dead. He panicked and ran. Perry thinks Burger will have a field day with this case, but agrees to defend Rod.

Paul observes the police making a same-conditions test of Graves's ability to recognize people in the study from his location in the car, and he definitely passes. However, Lt. Tragg calls Paul into his office, reveals the he knows of Paul's unauthorized attendance at the test, and hands him a subpoena. If Perry tries to challenge Graves's account then Paul, obviously not biased toward the prosecution, will have to testify that he saw Graves proving his visual acuity.

At the trial, Burger parades his witnesses before the jury, all recounting the events we've seen. On cross-examination, Judge Purley says that he didn't know Norton and had never even spoken with him on the phone. Crinston testifies that his 11 PM meeting with Norton was to be about a tax matter, but Norton was too upset about Fran to discuss anything. Clara Mayfield (Lillian Bronson), the housekeeper who had helped care for Fran after her mother died, testifies that she saw Rod come in from the garden and go into the house. On cross, she admits that Norton threatened to fire her unless she stayed away from Fran.

Perry has Paul maneuver Judge Purley so he'll hear the upcoming testimony from just outside the courtroom. He calls Crinston, accusing him of embezzlement and then killing Norton, who had caught on. Crinston firmly denies everything that Perry said. Next, he calls Graves and asks him to read aloud some sentences - a few old adages ending with ""Crinston, I want Graves to go with you."" Perry then recalls the judge, who testifies that the voice he heard that night was the same one he just heard: not Norton, but Graves. The secretary admits it, but says that this was his only part in the crime - Crinston was the killer. The latter holds his head in despair.

Later, Perry agrees with Clara that Graves only abetted the murder for a share of the embezzlement profits. However, they differ on whether Fran's baby will be a boy or a girl."

Harry Marlow (Dan Seymour), ex-con and now a florist, drops by to suggest that he'd make a good silent partner in Mildred's business. She wants nothing to do with him, but his manner hints that he's confident he'll get what he wants. Mildred, who is recovering from a recent heart attack, collapses and sends Tulloch running to fetch her pills.

In his office at Club Eldorado, owner Sam Lynk (Michael Emmet) is playing poker with Harry and Bob Kimber (Mark Roberts), with club hostess Lola Florey (Peggy Maley) in attendance. Bob has a full house, and - seen only by Lola - a gun and set of stock certificates in his coat pocket. The hand is interrupted by a phone call, which Lola answers. It's Miss Carling (Jann Darlyn), the woman for whom Sam dumped Lola, who's obviously not pleased. Back in the game, Sam keeps raising Bob until the pot is huge. Bob calls, but Sam's four deuces have him beat. In all, Bob now owes $37,000, and has to pledge his stock. Harry manages to find an offensive way of saying that Mildred has entrusted Bob with 49% of Orchids Unlimited. Bob punches him, but Sam pulls him off and sends him to the bar. Harry expects Sam to hand over the stock, for which Sam has already been payed $40,000. However, Sam says he now wants an additional $10,000, as he charges more for his services to people he dislikes.

At their apartment, Mildred learns from a drunk Bob that Sam now has the stock. She calls Perry, who's in the middle of vital work, so she has to settle for an appointment at 10:30 next morning. She goes to the club, where Lola privately tells her that the game was rigged and about the deal with Harry. Admitting that she's acting as a woman scorned, Lola agrees to come to Perry's office next morning, bringing one of Sam's marked decks as evidence. Mildred leaves, and later Lola is about to do likewise when a cigarette girl (Dawn Richard) hands her a box of chocolates that had been left anonymously for her shortly before.

Perry and Della are still working late when he gets a call from Lola, weakly saying that she's eaten poisoned candy. Then she stops talking, but the line is still open, so Perry hopes they can get it traced, but no sooner does he say this than it's disconnected. He immediately calls Lt. Tragg but can't tell him much because Lola isn't listed in the phone book. Luckily, her name is familiar to Tragg, who gets her address from the police registry of night club employees. He sends an ambulance and meets Perry at Lola's house. They find her barely alive, six candies gone from the box, and the receiver of the phone back on the hook. Perry has Della peek into the trash, but she sees nothing but some used tissues.

At her apartment, Mildred looks unwell again. A gun falls out of her coat and she puts it back. Perry and Della are at the door. She tells him that Bob has returned, exhausted from business travel, and is now asleep. It's all a lie, as are her claim that her urgent problem has been cleared up and her denial of knowing Lola. As they leave, Perry speculates that there's a link from Mildred to her husband (a known gambler) to Sam (another gambler) to Lola (Sam's employee). Therefore, he goes to Sam's house but finds him on the floor, shot dead. The phone is off the hook, and near the body Perry finds Mildred's pill prescription. He returns to Mildred's apartment and finds the gun in her coat. She tells Perry about her meeting with Lola and that she went to Sam's, found him dead and Bob's gun on the floor, so she took it, but couldn't find the stock. She had a blackout while there, which is how she must have dropped her prescription. Perry warns her not to lie, because they'll give her a paraffin test to show if she's fired a gun recently. The police pound on the door, and Mildred realizes that Bob's fingerprints must be on the gun, so she grabs it and wipes it, but fires a wild shot in the process. As Lt. Tragg bursts in to arrest her, she collapses.

Later, her doctor (Henry Hunter) has put an oxygen tent around her bed. He's says that she'll never live through the stress of a murder trial. Her husband should be with her, but the police are still looking for him. Downstairs, Burger has arrived and said he won't let Mildred evade justice. Perry says that if he questions her and she suffers a fatal relapse, he'll accuse the prosecutor of manslaughter. Burger replies that he's instructed the city medical officer to examine her, which can't be medically objectionable, and let the D.A.'s office know as soon as Mildred is fit to be arraigned. He adds that he also intends to charge Perry with malfeasance, for telling Mildred to fire the gun in her apartment, the rendering a paraffin test pointless.

In Perry's office, Paul reports that Lola is recovering and soon will be discharged. The poison was Veronal, and a few more pieces would have killed her. Harry Marlow show up, still after the stock. He threatens to testify that he was on the phone with Sam when he was murdered, and Sam told him Bob was there. Perry throws him out, but soon bumps into him again leaving Lola's hospital room. Perry tells her that she's still in danger from her poisoner, who is also Sam's killer, so she should tell the D.A. what she told Mildred. Lola won't cooperate, and after Perry presses her she indicates that Harry made threats. Perry convinces Tragg to put a stakeout on Lola's house, despite Burger's possible ire at being left out of the loop. Perry decides to go there himself, and Tragg goes too.

We see some rags thrown on the floor and splashed with what must be a flammable liquid, since a lit match thrown into the pile instantly results in a roaring fire. Outside, the police see the flames and call the fire department as Lola runs out, screaming. Perry arrives and calms the hysterical Lola. She says that she saw Harry, who hit her and set the fire. Tragg congratulates Perry, who explains to Lola that at his suggestion, Harry had been jailed on extortion charges earlier that day. She tries again, saying it was actually Bob that she saw, but the police have him too. Defeated, she admits that she lifted Bob's gun at the poker game and used it to kill Sam. She set the fire herself.

Back at the office, Perry explains that Lola poisoned herself to set up an alibi and points out the clue: When Perry and Della looked around Lola's place when she was found poisoned, where were the wrappers of the six candies she'd eaten? She hadn't called Perry from home at all, but from a phone booth near Sam's house, giving her time to shoot him, rush home, and collapse. The only remaining question is who was really on the phone with Sam at the time of the murder, and Tragg enters, announcing that it was just Tulloch, Mildred's nurseryman, in a vain attempt to get the stock back for her. The lieutenant adds that he comes with a present from Lola, who wants to show there are no hard feelings. It's a box of chocolates, so Perry offers Tragg a piece. He replies, ""After you."""

Through binoculars they spy Belle Adrian prowling about the house. Fortunately, Perry Mason on vacation comes to Belle's aid when she is charged with murder.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['tire tracks', 'broken mirror', 'mother daughter relationship', 'neighbor neighbor relationship', 'man wears a bathrobe', 'man uses a wheelchair', 'awakened by a scream']",[],"On a rainy Friday night at his lakeside cabin in Bear Valley, Mark Cushing (Eric Sinclair) is showing home movies of him waterskiing to Carla Adrian (Barbara Eden). He ended up in a wheelchair with a broken leg, but that doesn't stop him from making a determined grab for Carla. He tears her blouse, and gets a good slap in return. A couple cabins away, Sam Burris (Malcolm Atterbury) rouses his wife Betsy (Dorothy Adams) from bed, telling her that he heard a shot and the sound of broken glass. Soon, they hear a scream, and use binoculars to check what's going on at the Cushing cabin. They spot Belle Adrian (Sylvia Field), Carla's mother, and Betsy convinces Sam to call the sheriff.

The next morning, Sheriff Elmore (James Westerfield) is conducting a crime scene investigation of Cushing's place. He's dead, and the main clue seems to be broken glass from a mirror. Sam arrives, at the sheriff's instructions, but doesn't have much to tell. He still hasn't spilled the beans about seeing Belle and Elmore can tell he's holding something back. He knows that Sam disliked Cushing. Sam admits that he's convinced he was once cheated in a business deal with Cushing, but says that something like this - murder - is an entirely different matter. Perry is vacationing at a neighboring cabin, so Belle calls on him to ask for assistance. She explains how Carla figures in what has happened, including the fact that Carla had a flat tire later that night. However, Belle omits any mention of her own late-night visit to Cushing's cabin. She wants Perry to find whoever it was who screamed that night, so Perry puts Paul on the job. The sheriff also comes calling, and is very suspicious of Belle's story, since it doesn't fit the evidence of the various tracks of footprints left is the rain-soaked ground.

Later, Perry goes to Belle's cabin, meets Carla and her boyfriend Harvey Delano (Peter Nelson), and learns from Belle that the sheriff has been by with a search warrant. He's taken a pair of Belle's shoes, Carla's torn blouse, and a woman's gold compact, inscribed ""From Mark to Carla with love"", which was found hidden in a boot. It seems that the broken mirror found at the murder scene is a good fit for this compact. Sheriff Elmore reappears, and with his help Perry draws a diagram of the location of the relevant cabins, plus Carla's car and the various footprint paths between them all. The sheriff mentions finding fingerprints on the car, mostly of people with legitimate reasons to touch the car, but also a single print he couldn't identify. He found a gun near the car, which Harvey recognizes as one he lent to Carla so she could learn to shoot. Others knew she was doing this, so there was no point in trying to keep it secret. Finally, the sheriff reveals that Belle's shoes had traces of blood and glass particles on them, so he arrests her for murder.

Paul gets a report from an operative who had been assigned to check out Cushing's funeral, looking for any candidates for the mystery screamer among the mourners. He's tracked down a Marion Keats (Joan Weldon). Perry visits her, but she's hostile and uncooperative. Perry serves her a subpoena for the upcoming hearing. Meanwhile, by bribing a desk clerk, Paul has learned that on the murder night Marion received a phone call, in which the party at the other end said merely ""Yes"" and hung up. Then Marion got her car and drove off, later checking into a hotel in Bear Valley. She could have been in the area as early as 1:30 AM.

At the hearing, Sheriff Elmore admits that the evidence of Belle's shoes isn't as conclusive as he thought, since there's no glass that could have only come from Cushing's cabin. Betsy Burris testifies about seeing Belle that night, a fact that Belle had still kept from Perry. In a recess, Belle gets a lecture from Perry, then admits that she went there when she heard the scream and tried to cover up anything that would connect Carla to the murder. She took the compact, wiped away fingerprints, washed glasses, etc. Back in court, Sam describes the murder scene as he saw it the next day - the body, the evidence that two people had been watching home movies, etc. The D.A. (Paul Fix) berates him for his earlier reticence about Belle, and says he'll sit back and watch Perry rip him apart in cross-examination. However, Perry has no questions at this time. Della reports that Paul has learned who left the mystery fingerprint on Carla's car. It was Nora Fleming (Eve McVeagh), Cushing's cook/housekeeper.

Perry now calls Marion, but her lawyer George Lansing (Addison Richards) intervenes, accusing Perry of harassing his client. Perry insists on his right to question her, but after his first question both the D.A. and Lansing object, saying that Perry has no specific and relevant purpose to his question and is on a fishing expedition. This gives Perry the opening he needs to lay out exactly what he aims to show. Marion was Cushing's jealous girlfriend and had made arrangements with Nora to call her if Cushing brought a girl to his cabin. Nora is the one who called that night, and off Marion went to Cushing's cabin. Marion blurts out ""He was dead when I got there!"". She explained that when she arrived in the area, the first thing she saw was Carla's car, which angered her, and she took Carla's compact from the car. Then she went to Cushing's cabin, saw the body, screamed, dropped the compact, and left. Perry recalls Sam, and notes that in his description of the crime scene, he mentioned seeing a glass with lipstick on it. But he couldn't have seen that the day after the murder - Belle had cleaned it up! Sam knew about Carla's borrowed gun and used it to kill Cushing. Then he went to bed and roused his wife, pretending that he had just heard a shot and broken glass. Marion's scream coming then was a lucky coincidence."

Meanwhile, outside apartment 604, Fay Allison (Sue England) sends her fiancé Dane Grover (Douglas Dick) off to his bachelor party, then takes over doing the dishes from her roommate Anita Bonsal (Jean Willes). Anita says she doesn't resent her for marrying Dane, who had dated Anita first. Anita announces she's going to be out late, then secretly goes up to 702. Carver is supposedly getting a divorce so that he and Anita can marry, but for now she insists on going out, as it's only 9:15. She says she'll wait in the car, but not for long. However, it's 9:58 when she finally gives up. When she returns to 604, she suggests hot chocolate. While Fay is making it, Anita grabs a box from the medicine cabinet, and eyes a pile of Fay's clothes.

At 1:30 A.M., Fay's aunt Louise Marlow (Frances Bavier) arrives for the wedding, using a key she was sent, only to find both girls unconscious. She calls her old family friend Perry, who informs Dr. Hawley (Howard Culver) of the emergency. He and Della arrive to learn that Fay has suffered a severe overdose of barbiturates, and Anita a moderate overdose. Perry is sure this couldn't be an accident, so he and Della look for clues. They find keys to both 604 and 702 in Fay's purse. They to go 702, where Shirley Tanner (Gloria McGehee) emerges from 704 across the hall and complains about the noise from all the comings and goings. Perry and Della enter, to find Carver dead, with a vivid lip mark from a kiss on his forehead. As they leave, they encounter Don Rolston (Douglas Evans) and Vera Payson (Joi Lansing) on the way to visit Carver. Shirley comes out again to complain about even more people going into 702. Vera seizes on the fact that Carver already has company to insist to Don that they should leave. From the lobby, Perry calls Louise and tells her to arrange for an ambulance to take Fay and Anita to a private sanitarium. Della goes outside to check the name on the buzzer for 702, but then needs Perry to let her back in because the door is locked.

Later, Lt. Tragg arrives with police officers and police lab technician George Harlan (John Harmon). The homicide lieutenant has questions for Perry, but also some answers. Carver has been dead since 9 or 10, from what turns out to be cyanide in his drink. Tragg wonders why Carver doesn't have a key to his own apartment. He finds clothes, which are identified by dry cleaning marks as belonging to Fay. The next day, at the sanitarium, Anita tells Tragg and Perry that she never used sleeping pills, but Fay sometimes did. She also denies knowing Carver. Fay makes the same denial, and also insists she didn't drug the chocolate.

Back at the office, Paul reports that the poisoned glass in 702 had been wiped clean, but a second glass had Fay's fingerprints. Don did Carver's taxes, and Vera's a party girl. Perry wonders how they got into the building, since Carver certainly didn't buzz them in. He tells Paul to check out all the tenants in the building. Fay's fiancé Dane arrives with money to pay for her defense, which Perry accepts, but tells him he'll need to help in other ways. Dane agrees, and warns Perry that the police are sure to find out that Fay was at his family's house on a day when the gardener was using cyanide.

In court, Don testifies that he and Vera rang 702 and were buzzed in, then they spent several minutes in the lobby arguing about whether to go up and see Carver. During this time, the elevator doors closed and it went up, so when they were finally ready to use it, they had to call it and wait for it to come down. When it did, no one was in it. Burger objects to all this testimony about elevator movements, since they could be caused by any tenant visiting any other tenant. For once, Burger is sustained, but Perry doesn't appear to be bothered by it. Shirley testifies about seeing Perry outside her apartment. She states that she had sublet apartment 704 about a week before the murder, from Jerome Hill, who was leaving town. Della has to testify that she and Perry found the key to 702 in Fay's purse. Lab technician Harlan testifies about the fingerprints, and on cross-examination says that lip prints are as distinctive as fingerprints. Perry has him compare Fay's to ones of Carver in a crime scene photo, and they don't match.

During a recess, Perry frets that he doesn't yet have the answers that will conclusively exonerate Fay, Paul reports that Jerome Hill never left town after subletting his apartment to Shirley. Back in court, Anita testifies that she didn't know Carver, but Perry produces charge account records signed by him, paying for expensive gifts with the monogram ""AB"". He accuses her of giving Fay a dangerous dose of sleeping pills, hoping to kill her, and also moving her clothes and a glass with her fingerprints into 702 so she'd be blamed for the murder. Her motive was that she wanted Dane for herself. Hysterical, Anita runs out of the witness stand to a window, threatening to jump.

Burger moves for a mistrial due to all the melodrama, but Perry says that if given some leeway he can clear everything up. He begins to question Shirley, but suddenly presses a paper to her lips and asks for Harlan to check the lip print. Shirley says that won't be necessary. Carver had dumped her for Anita, so she moved across the hall and waited for an opportunity to poison him (apparently thinking Anita would be blamed, since her clothes were in the apartment). She buzzed in Don and Vera and returned to 704 a little before Perry and Della arrived. Anita confesses that she came back to 702, found Carver dead, and hatched her plan to shift the blame to a dead Fay. This included taking Carver's apartment key and putting it in Fay's purse.

Fay and Dane leave for their honeymoon, and she kisses Perry goodbye. He reveals what set him after Shirley. Hill had vacated his apartment because Shirley paid him a $500 bonus to sublease it, when other apartments in the building were for rent. Della wipes a big smooch mark from Perry's cheek. He seems very pleased with himself."

He's sure Edgar will pick her up, and soon ""get friendly"", so he leaves. Edgar acts as predicted. He's a movie producer, senior partner in Fidelity Studios, and says that maybe he can find a job for Veronica. He takes her to a beach house owned by the studio, which uses its elaborate grounds for shooting films. Inside, Edgar starts to play host when another car drives up, so he sends Veronica out the back way. Outside, she hears a gunshot and runs about a mile to a service station with a phone booth. She tries to call Pete at their rendezvous point, but he's not there. As she leaves the booth, John Addison (Robert Ellenstein) drives up, seems about to make his own call, but turns back, and agrees to give Veronica a ride.

The next day, Addison, who is also a partner in Fidelity Studios, sees Perry at his office. He says that after he dropped Veronica off she was arrested for vagrancy, and he wants Perry to bail her out. When he does, Veronica tells him that she was living with her mother in Albuquerque but grew bored and hitchhiked to L.A. Perry gives her a little money and suggests that she return home. She says she will. When Perry returns to the office, Della tells him that Veronica's mother stopped by and paid $100 to handle the cost of getting Veronica out of trouble. Also, Veronica now has a job as a contract player at Fidelity.

That evening, Perry stops by Addison's office, where he's working late with screenwriter Lorraine Ferrell (Catherine McLeod), Edgar's unhappy wife. She leaves, and Addison explains that he hired Veronica - leaving the details to his assistant Myrtle Northrup (Peggy Converse) - because ""she seemed like a nice girl"". Unfortunately, Pete knows about this and wants $10,000 to keep it out of the scandal sheets. Perry has Addison sign his name on a piece of paper, then write a check for $2000 but instead of signing it normally, trace his first signature onto the check. Perry leaves with the check, telling Addison to have Pete come to the law office. He gives Pete the check, but afterward has Paul arrange to put out the word to all the banks that someone is forging high-profile people's names on checks.

Perry goes to the beach house in response to a summons by Addison, who wants to show him something inside. Perry explains that if he sees evidence of a crime, he must report it immediately, but if Addison just tells him something, it's a privileged communication. Addison says he went to the house to rest after scouting nearby shooting locations, and found Edgar's body, dead a few days. Perry immediately figures that Edgar died Tuesday night, when Addison was in the area (having picked up Veronica then), and that's when he really found the body. Addison admits that's what happened, and he was about to enter the gas station phone booth to call the police when he realized that Veronica could identify him. Perry tells him that if he wants a witness to his ""stumbling across the body a few days later"" ploy, he'll need a better companion than his own attorney.

The next day, Addison takes Myrtle to the beach house to ""take inventory"", and arranges that she be the one to see the body first. She volunteers to call the police as if she came there alone, hoping to keep Addison's name out of it, but he insists he has nothing to hide and makes the call. Perry is summoned to the office of Sgt. Bent, who works forgery cases. The check with Addison's traced signature has surfaced, and Pete is in custody. Perry warns him that by claiming that he didn't forge the check, he'll have to admit to being a paid-off extortionist. Lt. Tragg enters, already aware that Pete could have helpful knowledge concerning Edgar's murder. Sgt. Bent, now suspecting that Perry may have passed the check with the traced signature calls Addison about it, at Perry's insistence. He's astonished to hear Addison say he really signed the check. Tragg immediately catches on to how Perry trapped Pete while avoiding being guilty of passing a forged check. He takes Pete away to meet with Burger.

In court, a police fingerprint expert (Perry Ivins) testifies that along with prints of people known to be in the beach house, there were prints of an unidentified woman. There's no way to know when any of the prints were left. Tragg testifies that ballistics show that bullets from the missing murder gun matched ones Addison had used on practice targets, so the gun had been in his possession at one time. Pete, under immunity from prosecution, testifies to taking the $2000 as hush money concerning Addison's whereabouts on the murder night. He also admits to being a convicted blackmailer, but Burger objects when Perry wants details about his doings with Veronica. The judge says he'll rule when court resumes the next day.

Paul has brought Martha Dale (Barbara Pepper), Veronica's mother, from Albuquerque and put her up in a hotel. Della is surprised to see that this isn't the same Mrs. Dale she met earlier. The real Martha says that Veronica has quite a history of running away, and she hadn't heard from her daughter in 10 months. Paul reports that once Veronica checked out of her room on Burger's instructions, a Drake Agency operative entered the room and retrieved a booklet filled with pages of numbers.

Back in court, Veronica is on the stand, perjuring herself every time she opens her mouth: She was at the gas station because a rancher dropped her off there. She doesn't know Pete. She'd been living with her mother until about four days before the murder, when she headed to L.A. to better herself. She stops the parade of lies when she sees that her mother has entered the courtroom. Perry produces her booklet. It's a list of license plate numbers and dates. She claims that's just a hobby, but Perry thinks she keeps it so diligently for purposes of extortion. Furthermore, the license plate just before Addison's doesn't belong to some unknown rancher but to a studio car used by Edgar! Trapped, Veronica admits the truth about her shady practices and about what happened with Edgar. She only briefly saw the car that drove up the the beach house that night, but could testify that it wasn't Addison's. Pete adds that he and Veronica had been working together for at least 6 months. He explains the scheme against Edgar, but has no idea why anyone was posing as Veronica's mother.

Perry and Paul go to the beach house to reenact the murder, bringing along Myrtle, who has a key to the place. Their attempts accomplish nothing, and Perry says the best thing will be to plea bargain down to 2nd degree murder - a 20 year sentence for Addison. Myrtle is shocked at the idea of taking away 20 years from the life of such a great man. Finally, she says that she overheard that Edgar was going to the beach house, so she went there herself, taking Addison's gun for protection. She confronted him there and started to call Lorraine when Edgar grabbed a poker to stop her. The gun went off in their struggle. Perry acts unconvinced, so Myrtle proves her confession by taking him to an urn on the property where she hid the gun.

In the courthouse, Perry learns that there's a mob of reporters waiting to question him about the case, so he and Della sneak out a back way, leaving Paul to deal with the fourth estate. Perry tells Paul that it was Myrtle who impersonated Veronica's mother, hoping to keep anyone from learning the vixen's connection to Addison. Della thinks that a good lawyer can get Myrtle off with a plea of self-defense, and Perry agrees. He tells Paul to warn the reporters against picking up a lady on the highway. ""If she's no lady, it could be murder."""

When Ed arrives, Mitchell reports on the sandwiches Ed provided, saying that his wife made them. They were loaded with arsenic. He returns home, where he confronts his wife Myrna (June Dayton) and her cousin Louise Ansel (Sarah Selby) with the news, and adds that he suspects Myrna poisoned her Uncle Charlie.. He's leaving on a business trip to Bakerstown, and Myrna has packed his bags, including a package of chocolates. However, he has left a letter with the poisoning accusations at his real estate office to be read in case of his death. If he dies, Myrna will soon follow him, via the gas chamber!

After driving about an hour, Ed pulls into the Vista Motel. He seems very tired or weak. At 11:30, he calls the motel office from his bed, saying he's sick. Dr. Renault (James Maloney) lives around the corner, so he arrives quickly. After putting Ed under an oxygen tent, he tries to call Myrna. Louise takes the call but doesn't mention it to Myrna. Her priority is to convince her cousin to see an attorney about Ed's charges. At Perry's office, Myrna and Louise provide a key to Ed's office, plus a letter of authorization for him to retrieve the letter. Perry says the letter could be very damaging, particularly since Myrna got a large inheritance from Uncle Charlie, whom she's accused of having poisoned. However, he can't touch the letter while Ed is alive. Louise finally reveals Ed's current lstate of health. When she and Myrna go to the motel, Ed accuses Myrna of poisoning the chocolates, then begins gasping. Dr. Renault checks the oxygen tent, gives Ed a shot, then examines him. He pulls the bed sheet over Ed's head and tells Myrna ""I'm sorry."" Then he goes to call the police. Louise says they should call Perry and have him retrieve the letter before it's too late.

At Ed's office, Perry and Della find an envelope addressed to the police in the event of his death, plus a withdrawal slip for $17,300 from Ed's checking account, written in a feminine hand. Meanwhile, Rita Norge (Rebecca Welles), Ed's secretary, arrives outside the office, notices Perry's car, peeks inside, sees him, and leaves. Della answers the phone, thinking Myrna might be calling, but hears only ""Unit 13. Desert Motel. Bakerstown."" Perry tells Della to have Paul go there immediately. They steam open the envelope, but it contains nothing but blank pages - no invisible ink either. They reseal it.

When Lt. Tragg arrives at the Vista Motel, all are shocked to discover that Ed's body is gone. At the real estate office, Rita has returned with a police officer (Keith Alan). Perry shows his letter of authorization, and the policeman takes possession of the envelope. Perry gets a call from Myrna, who says it appears that Ed was only unconscious, as he's gone off and hasn't been found. When Paul goes to the Desert Motel, he finds reason to believe that Ed reserved Unit 13 under the name John Stokes.

Perry is reporting this to Myrna at home when Tragg arrives to question her about Uncle Charlie's death. He's already been exhumed, and the coroner reports he dies of arsenic poisoning. There's arsenic plant spray at the house, and Ed's candy was full of the stuff. Louise exclaims that Myrna bought the candy and also had vetoed Louise's idea that they hire a nurse for Uncle Charlie. She tells Tragg about the lab report Ed had obtained, and ends by accusing Myrna of two murders. Tragg says ""Burger's going to love this case. With a witness like this, how can he lose?""

In Burger's office, the two attorney's argue about the opened envelope and whether Ed is dead. Tragg calls to report that the body has been found again. Two boys came upon an open grave a couple days earlier, and when they later saw it filled in, they dug for a bit until they found a corpse. The coroner reports it contains arsenic. Burger offers no death penalty in exchange for a guilty plea, but Perry rejects the idea since it wouldn't apply to the charge of murdering Uncle Charlie. Burger says they'll see how Perry's destruction of vital evidence will sit with a jury.

Paul tells Della that Beckmeyer, Ed's private eye, has been watching Unit 13 at the Desert Motel. Della gets a call from Gertie the receptionist that Beckmeyer himself is in the outer office. He tells Della he'd like to get paid for his latest work for Ed. He thinks he's spotted the mysterious John Stokes, but his description matches Paul. A call comes in from a Drake Detective Agency operative who was tailing Rita. She's back at the real estate office, in violation of Tragg's orders for everyone to stay away. Perry and Paul find her there, throwing out papers. She's hostile, but does mention that Ed sold all his investments a few months ago. She won't answer questions about the $17,300, and when Perry says he wants to protect Myrna's property, Rita replies that she's sure Myrna will get everything she deserves.

Perry goes to Tragg to report his suspicions about Rita. The lieutenant, who tends to smirk when things aren't gong well for Perry, is practically beaming as he pulls out a copy of the receipt he gave Rita when she turned over the $17,300. In court, Deputy Coroner Hoxie (Michael Fox) testifies that Ed died of heart failure caused by arsenic he had ingested. He had eaten about an hour before death, and candy in the room tested positive for arsenic. On cross, Dr. Hoxie testifies that Ed had a .15% blood alcohol level - ""the beginning of intoxication"". (This was 1957.) He says that he found Ed had eaten bacon and eggs - not chocolate. Dr. Renault testifies that Ed told him he'd eaten poisoned chocolates from Myrna, so he pumped Ed's stomach. That explains why Dr. Hoxie found no chocolate in the body, but not how the bacon and eggs got there. Renault declared Ed to have died at 5:15 PM.

Perry and Della visit the site where the boys had found first an empty grave then a couple days later a filled-in one with a corpse. He wants to figure out why the grave was dug in advance. Also, where did Ed get eggs, bacon, and an alcoholic beverage an hour before he died? He wouldn't have walked into a diner in his pajamas. They search for clues, and a jackrabbit draws Della's attention to an area where a car and trailer had been parked for a long time.

Back on the stand, Dr. Renault admits he may have met Ed prior to encountering him at the Vista Motel. When pressed for details, he claims doctor-patient privilege. Perry makes him admit that he just has a diploma mill degree in ""Health Medicine"". When Perry asks him if he conspired with Ed to fake the latter's death, Renault pleads the Fifth. Beckmeyer testifies that one of his jobs for Ed was to find a quack who lived near a motor court. He set up a meeting of Ed and Renault one week before the death. He admits that he opened up several bank accounts into which Ed siphoned money. Perry gets him to admit he owns a trailer, and that Ed might have been in it at some point. Perry accuses him of having given Ed the bacon and eggs and poisoned wine there, having already dug Ed's grave. Beckmeyer starts to deny it, but Perry produces a receipt that shows he bought a shovel the same day the grave had been dug. The private eye confesses that Ed kept bragging about his perfect plan to disappear with Myrna's money, framing her. Beckmeyer figured he could make the plan more perfect with a couple additions, but now realizes he was wrong.

In the office, Della is trying unsuccessfully to hang a painting. Perry says that Beckmeyer had taken $210,000 from the accounts he'd set up. He reveals that the clue that pointed to the culprit was the ""Unit 13. Desert Motel. Bakerstown."" phone call. It was intended to lure Rita there, and could only have come from Beckmeyer, who wanted that last $17,300. Ed had poisoned Uncle Charlie, so Myrna would inherit a fortune he could steal. He's also the one who left blank pages in the envelope - something that would convince the police there was tampering of evidence."

They even have keys to the same house. At the office of his land investment company, boss Joe Bradford (Bruce Cowling) tells subordinate Jack Harper (Robert Clarke) to get his boat, the Mary Belle, ready to be sailed to San Diego for an important business deal. Martha calls, but Joe puts her off by arranging a rendezvous he has no intention of keeping. He tells Jack to remember whose wife Martha is.

That night, Martha's in bed when she hears a prowler, so she comes downstairs with a gun. She sees muddy prints from a woman's shoes on the floor, and goes back upstairs, dresses, and goes out. Rita is hiding in the house and sees this. The next day, Martha tells her story to Perry. He tries to call Joe but gets Jack, who after sending Perry and Martha on a wild goose chase admits Joe's plans to use the Mary Belle. She (the boat) is at La Cuesta harbor, where old salt Captain Noble (Francis McDonald) takes them out to the her in his boat. Boarding, they find Joe face down, dead. There's also a broken hurricane lamp with a candle that's tilting to one side, although it had been burning evenly. Back at the Bradford home, Lt. Tragg arrives and takes Martha in for questioning.

At the office, Paul reports that Rita was Joe's first wife, but he got a Mexican divorce before marrying Martha. Rita arrives, still insisting that she's the one and only Mrs. Bradford. Perry takes her to Burger's office, where she says that she went out to the boat to talk to Joe but found him dead. He was face up, not the way Perry found him. After she leaves, Burger tells Perry he's charging Martha with the murder. He produces a pair of her shoes, with blood on them that matches Joe's type.

Jack is on the Mary Belle, gathering up his personal possessions. The police are finished with her, having gone over her with a fine tooth comb). Company surveyor Larry Sands (Whit Bissell) arrives, wondering if he can find anything that will help Martha. Jack is even more anxious, since he and Martha are romantically involved. At least he has an alibi, as around the time of the murder he bought gas with a credit card, miles away from the harbor. Larry says he has no alibi. In fact, he soon goes to Perry and confesses to the murder. They go to Burger, who wonders how Larry killed a much larger man. Larry says he brought a rock from the beach and hit Joe on the head before he could move. In falling, Joe hit the table, breaking the hurricane lamp and putting out the candle, which he relit. Burger asks if there was anything unusual about the candle, but Larry can't think of anything. ""Wasn't it crooked?"" asks the D.A. ""Come to think of it, yes"" answers Larry. Burger immediately calls him a liar, since he's wrong about the murder weapon and the time of death.

In court, Tragg identifies the actual murder weapon, a small fire axe with traces of Joe's hair and blood, but no fingerprints. However, Martha's prints are on the candle, which is still stuck to what's left of the hurricane lamp at the same odd tilt. Rita testifies that she now realizes Joe had divorced her, but has no memory of it or anything for two years up to just before she went to the beauty shop. She also tells of entering her former house that night, seeing Martha leave, and finding Joe's body. Perry and Della spend that night aboard the Mary Belle, along with a dummy they put in the face-up position that Rita had described for Joe's body. Some hours later, everything in the cabin starts to tilt to one side. The dummy falls over to the position Perry found. The candle has burned out, and Della lights a new one. To keep it straight up and down, she has to put it at an angle to the slanted table.

Jack testifies that he bought the hurricane lamp and candles as part of outfitting the Mary Belle for the trip to San Diego. She had developed electrical problems, so these were now needed to light the cabin. Capt. Noble explains that at low tide, the boat would list to starboard in the shallow harbor. Using a model, Perry shows how this relates to the crooked candle. Low tide was at 1:17 AM, so Martha must have been on the boat and replaced the candle (leaving her prints) around then, 8 hours after the murder. Larry testifies about his false confession, mentioning out his errors. Perry accuses him of making the mistakes intentionally. The hurricane lamp and candles were new, hadn't been mentioned in public, and had been removed when he met Jack on the boat. Therefore, he had no way of knowing about the hurricane lamp or candles, crooked or not. He breaks down and confesses. He killed Joe because he loved Martha, but when he learned she loved Jack, he lied to protect himself and make Martha look more guilty.

In the office, Della gets a call from Martha, who is mailing in her check. She wants to avoid Perry, who's spoiling to lecture her about the folly of clients who don't tell their lawyer the truth. Paul comes in and borrows $75 for his date with his new client, Rita, who wants to know about her two missing years. Paul figures that until he can help with her past, he might as well try to make her present memorable."

In his office at his estate, George Alder (David Lewis) has his secretary Sally Fenner (Peggie Castle) show in Dorian, who enters, note in hand. It states it's from Agatha Alder, George's aunt, and dated the night she disappeared off her yacht, the Sea Witch, in a violent storm. It says that she believes George is about to murder her. He knows she's going to disinherit him over his mistreatment of his wife, Karen (Joan Banks). The final sentence begins ""If he pushes me through the porthole..."" and no more. Dorian asks for $50, and while George is getting out the money, Karen walks in. She's clearly drunk, and has come in to get more liquor. George orders Sally to take Karen back to her room, and when Karen complains, he slaps her. Later, Sally expresses her disgust at George's behavior and says she's quitting. George mentions that $10,000 the Agatha withdrew from the bank is missing, and that Sally could easily have taken it.

That night, Sally sneaks back into the house to fetch the note. She gets it, but fails to see George's body lying on floor. Moreover, she knocks over a lamp, alerting Hess the guard (John Cliff) and his dog. She flees the house, running to the beach and then swimming for it, with the dog in hot pursuit. Perry and Paul are in a boat, finishing up a long day of bass fishing, and rescue her. She shows Perry the note, and they take her to a jetty near where her car is parked. They return the boat to where they're parked and are about to leave when the police arrive and ask if they've seen an attractive blonde - she's wanted for George's murder.

Sally comes to see Perry at his office the next day. He thinks she may be in danger from the murderer, who may have killed George to cover up the murder of Agatha. The note incriminating George is obviously a fake. It was supposedly typed during a raging storm, but doesn't have a single error. Perry has Della take Sally to his apartment. Perry goes to the Alder estate, where Karen admits she's glad to be free of her abusive husband. She believes George murdered Agatha, and mentions that on board the Sea Witch that night with Agatha were George, Sally, the ship's captain, and Agatha's maid Nina Santos. Karen was left ashore because the others were ashamed of her - except for Sally, who was always sympathetic.

Later, Paul says he's discovered that Nina is now a hostess at a local cantina, so he and Perry interview her there. Nina says the note confirms her own suspicions, as Agatha was too good a sailor to let herself be accidentally swept overboard. Paul misjudges his tolerance for hot chili, and needs to down an entire pitcher of water. Meanwhile, Lt. Tragg arrives at Perry's apartment and arrests Sally for murder and Della for aiding a fugitive from justice. At Burger's office, Perry gets Della off by saying she was acting on his instructions and he avoids charges against himself, at least for the time being, by reminding the D.A. that he's sworn to service the cause of justice, not get as many convictions as possible. After they leave, Tragg brings in Dorian with the original note. The one he gave George was a copy that he'd made. Tragg also has the typewriter on which this note was made - it was at Sally's apartment.

In court, Tragg identifies a poker as the murder weapon. He found the french doors to George's office had been jimmied, and there were footprints outside that matched a pair of Sally's shoes. Sally's fingerprints were on the poker and George's cash box. On cross-examination, Perry gets Tragg to admit that her fingerprints were to be expected since she worked there, and that the lieutenant had found a key to the place on her key ring. If she had the key, why would she jimmy the french doors? Nina voices suspicions of Sally regarding the $10,000, but Perry produces evidence that she and her husband had bought the cantina for exactly that amount. Nina only pretented to be nothing more than a hostess there. She says the money was a gift from Agatha, who was always kind to her. She was afraid no one would believe her after Agatha's death, so she lied about it.

Coroner's physician Dr. Murray (Forrest Lewis) testifies that Agatha died from drowning, and there were no marks on her body to suggest violent treatment. Perry specifically asks about her being pushed through a porthole, as mentioned in the note. He replies that although the portholes were wider than usual on the Sea Witch, Agatha's hips were even wider. Burger next calls Karen, but gets a surprise when she testifies that from her bedroom she saw a man run out of the office and onto the beach that night. (Her description sounds like Dorian.) Burger accuses her of perjury and asks why she didn't mention that earlier. She says that, with George as her husband, she had to drink to forget - and sometimes it worked.

After a recess, Burger puts Karen back on the stand and confronts her with a photo of the view from her bedroom. You can see trees, but no beach. On cross, she discusses entering the office as George was paying off Dorian, and mentions the incriminating note and bottle. After proving she has excellent eyesight, she identifies the bottle on the prosecutor's table as the one she saw. However, Perry points out that Dorian had only brought a copy of the note, not the original or the bottle. The only reason she could identify the bottle is because she drank it contents, then put the note she had faked into it and threw it in the cove so it would wash up and be found. Karen admits it, and also confesses to killing George. It had made her feel free for a little while, but now she really needs a drink.

At the cantina, Perry explains that he suspected Karen because the fact that Agatha's death had to be accidental tended to eliminate the suspects who'd been on the Sea Witch that night. Paul is paying attention to an attractive dancer and doesn't notice the waitress putting sauce on the ham and eggs he ordered. Soon he is downing another pitcher of water."

However, when tough-looking customer George Fayette (Marc Krah) enters, waitress Dixie Dayton (Kay Faylen) is frightened. She flees out the back, but is chased by a car. Someone in the car shoots at her. Dixie runs - right into another car. Inside, Morey learns that she's been sent to the hospital. He immediately goes to her locker, takes out a mink coat, and gives it to Perry and Della. As the police arrive to investigate what happened to Dixie, Morey pleads that they help him. The mink, the worse for a couple moth holes but still a mink, is Dixie's legitimate property. However, if the police see it they might suspect that Morey's is the kind of place where waitresses are encouraged to ""get friendly"" with customers. If that got into the press, it would ruin him, so Perry takes it. Inside, he finds a ticket from a pawn shop in Portland. Perry noticed that Dixie left right after Fayette entered, so he asks Morey what he knows about the man. Morey claims ignorance, but he asks for Perry's legal help, without specifying for what. Perry, believing that Dixie is in danger, calls Lt. Tragg and asks that he tell the hospital to put her in a private room and allow no visitors. Tragg agrees to this - and also to sending the hospital bill to Perry's office.

By the next morning, Paul's man in Portland has reported about the pawn ticket. It was for a gun - a 38 caliber police special. Paul also warns that the police know Della left the restaurant wearing Dixie's mink. At the hospital, Perry encounters Tragg, who's somewhat miffed that Perry is being uncooperative after Tragg did him a favor. Perry is about to go see Dixie when the lieutenant tells him the she has disappeared from the hospital. Back at the office, Paul has learned that Fayette was once arrested as a bookie, but never brought to trial. Apparently, he had very good connections. Also, the gun Dixie pawned was the service revolver of Detective Claremont, who was shot and killed with it about a year earlier. Ever since, the police have been looking for Tom Sedgewick, another bookie who had been seen talking to Claremont shortly before the murder. Paul warns Perry that the police will pull out all the stops to catch a cop killer, and he'd be better off staying out of their way by dropping Morey as a client. However, Perry refuses to take the easy way out. Perry gets a call from Della. Tragg is at the office and wants the mink. Perry tells her to give him the receipt from the storage company where they left it.

Late that night, Perry is awakened by a call from Morey. He and Dixie are at the Keymont Hotel, room 721 and need Perry to come. Perry calls Paul, saying to join him there. Perry gets there first, but finds no one in the room. He notices a lipstick on the floor, and its texture shows that it was most recently used on a rough surface rather than lips. This soon leads him to look under a table, where he finds the message ""262 V3 L15 Mason Help"". Paul arrives, and Perry tells him about the message, and that it's a trap. If someone really tried to write that while pretending just to be sitting at the table, it would come out in mirror writing. Next, they decipher the message. In Volume 3 of the phone book in the room, on page 262, line 15, they find the name, number, and address of one Herbert Granton. Paul recognizes this as a name Fayette had used in the past. Since the message is a trap, they don't head there. Instead, Paul uses a hall phone to call the front desk and pretend to have airline reservation information for Fayette, but the room number on his paper is illegible. The night clerk, Frank Hoxie (Than Wyenn), obligingly tells him that Fayette doesn't answer, but the room number is 815.

Perry and Paul go there only to find Fayette shot dead. They are soon followed into the room by Tragg and Sgt. Jaffrey (Douglas Kennedy), a vice detective and Claremont's superior at the time of his murder. They had arrived because the guest in the next room had heard arguing and a shot, and called Hoxie who called the police. Hoxie was also cooperating with them when he gave Paul the room number. The detectives wanted to find out what would be done with the information. Now that they've caught Perry and Paul, they press for more information. Jaffrey wants to get rough, but Tragg restrains him and points out that they can take Paul's private investigator's license from him for failing to cooperate. Paul's uncertain what to do, but Perry ends his dilemma by revealing the call from Morey and Dixie. Tragg demands that Perry hand over the pair by noon. Perry says he's unable, but Tragg insists, saying that Perry's status as an officer of the court requires him to cooperate. If Perry doesn't give him the two suspects, Tragg will ask the D.A. to begin disbarment proceedings against him.

However, this is soon rendered moot, as the police pick up Morey and Dixie on their own. In jail, Morey tells Perry that Tom Sedgewick is his half brother and is engaged to Dixie. Tom's connection to the ""Mr. Big"" of the bookmaking operation was through Fayette. Det. Claremont wanted to use Tom in a plan to uncover the top man. When the detective was killed, Tom left and ended up in Portland with Dixie. Perry points out that they had the murder gun with them in Portland, and Morey is shocked to think that his half-brother is guilty after all. He needed to return to the dry climate of L.A. because of tuberculosis, even though he'd been warned by Fayette that this would have fatal consequences. That's why Dixie fled when Fayette showed up at the restaurant. She feared she'd be tortured into revealing Tom's hiding place. While she was hospitalized, she got a call from a woman who said she knew who was Claremont's actual killer and that Dixie should come to the Keymont Hotel. Dixie called Morey to come with her, and he brought his gun for protection. They checked into room 721, but noticed they were being observed. That's when Morey called Perry to come there, but shortly after he hung up, two thugs entered the room at gunpoint, took Morey's gun, and left. Of course, his gun had been found by the police and proved to have been used to kill Fayette.

In court, Hoxie testifies about Morey and Dixie checking into the hotel and asking about room 815. On cross-examination, he admits that he's an ex-con, and he got the hotel job through the help of a sympathetic law officer. He had been working their steadily every since, except for one month the previous year when hotel management sent him to Mexico City to collect on a bill. Perry shows him a photo of Claremont, which Hoxie identifies as a man he saw go to Fayette's room just before the Mexico trip. On recess, Perry tells Paul to find out everything about the ownership of the Keymont hotel. Why would a third-rate hotel fly an employee to Mexico City for a month just to collect on an unpaid bill?

Later, Perry is alone in his office when Sgt. Jaffrey enters. He senses that Perry has worked out a solution, and wants to know if Perry can tell him who killed his subordinate, so he can bring the cop killer to justice. Perry says the sergeant can do that easily just by giving himself up! Jaffrey was the higher-up whom Claremont was trying to track down. Hoxie can testify to Jaffrey's presence at the Keymont, and probably would have blown the whistle earlier if Jaffrey hadn't arranged for him to go to Mexico until the murder was out of the papers. Jaffrey killed Claremont and planted the gun on Tom. Later, he killed Fayette, who started to panic when Dixie disappeared. Perry produces a copy of the Keymont's incorporation papers, showing Jaffrey's signature as owner under a fake name, but in his handwriting. Jaffrey pulls his gun. He plans to say that Perry resisted when Jaffrey was arresting him for attempted bribery. As he prepares to shoot, Tragg, looking in from the next room through a slightly open door, shouts ""Hold it, Jaffrey."" Shots are exchanged and Jaffrey goes down with a bullet to his arm. Tragg is unwounded, but disgusted by the sight of a cop who killed one of his own men. Perry says he should call an ambulance. Tragg agrees but adds, ""Don't hurry.""

Back at Morey's, Perry relates that Jaffrey gave himself away by his astounding lack of curiosity when Perry was pointing out the message under the table. He didn't bother to cross the room to see the message, because he had written it himself. Also, a policeman is far more likely to shoot it out even in unfavorable circumstances rather than give up his gun. However, he would turn over his weapon to a superior officer. When they all order dessert, Perry says he'll take anything Morey has - except for a moth-eaten mink."

Tydings amits he embezzled it, but he has a file that prevents Dawson from doing anything. After he leaves, Tydings tells the company clerk, Richard Ellis (Al Hopson), that he himself took only $60,000 and gives Ellis a day to return the extra $20,000. He takes a call for Bob from Carol and arranges for her to come to the office at 10 PM to discuss her account. He seems pleased, but his secretary, Enid Shaw (Mary Castle) looks resentful.

Outside, a policeman tickets Carol's car, which is parked to close to a fire hydrant. Bob (not revealing his identity) and Carol (going him one better with a thick veil) go to Perry's apartment. Bob gives him two ""Grovers"" ($1000 bills) as a retainer. Then he takes out a $10,000 bill, which Perry says he hasn't seen before. (They were very rare even in 1957, and bore the image of Salmon P. Chase, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary.) Bob tears it in half, giving one half to Perry and the other to the disguised Carol. Perry will get Carol's half if the need arises for him to represent her, or return the retainer if he declines the case.

The next morning the no-nonsense Miss Abigail Leeds (Geraldine Wall) barges into Perry's office. She says that in 1939 she was asked to take Carol (then known as Katrina) out of Poland and look after her until her parents could follow. They never made it out. Being single, she put Carol in what she thought was a respectable welfare home, but turned out to be a baby farm, i.e., an adoption-for-pay racket. Luckily, Carol was acquired by the Stanleys, who turned out to be kind. They adopted her legally and left her a six-figure trust fund when they were killed in a car crash. Unluckily, Tydings was named trustee. Abigail knows about his thievery, but only Carol has legal standing to start an investigation, so Abigail will bring Carol to the office that afternoon.

Paul reports that he traced the serial number on the $10,000 bill, and it had been issued to Tydings. Perry wonders if he's been retained by both sides of the same dispute. The pair go to Tydings' house and find blood both inside and out. The trail leads them to a closet, and when they open it, Tydings himself falls out, face forward. Paul calls the police. Back at the office, Perry tells Abigail and Carol that Tydings is dead. Abigail volunteers to be the new trustee, serving at no fee. Lt. Tragg arrives to question Abigail about an unpleasant meeting she'd had with Tydings. She says ""Whoever murdered him did a civic service."" Tragg admires her frankness.

Perry goes to the Tydings and Dawson office. With Tydings dead and Bob having left town last night, Ellis is in charge. He claims professional ethics prevent him from helping Perry. Perry wants to talk to Enid, but is told that she usually comes in late. Paul reports that Bob's car has been found, wrecked, by a lake. While the police are dragging for a body, Paul and Perry join them and don't correct the conclusion to which Officer Duggan (Lyle Latell) has jumped, that they are from the press. Perry points out that no one was driving when the car crashed, as the gas pedal has been wired down. So there's probably no body to find.

That evening, as soon as all the investment office staff have left, Perry and Della sneak in, with Paul as lookout. Perry examines the ledger of Carol's account, which he has a court order to do, and finds evidence of Tydings' defalcations. On the floor he finds the empty shell of a small-caliber bullet, perhaps from a Beretta. If Tydings was shot in his office, why was the body moved miles away to his house? Perry speculates that if a woman shot Tydings and Bob was involved with her, he might move the body to protect her. Perry notes that on his daily calendar for 10 PM the night he was murdered, Tydings made a sketch of a female torso. If Tydings was expecting something to happen, perhaps the woman involved is Enid, as there must be some reason she can come into the office late. Perry gets a frantic phone call from Paul, who had trouble getting through. Tragg is on his way up! They duck out a window onto the fire escape, and evade capture.

Back at the office, they learn that Bob is wanted for murder. Blood found in his car matched Tydings' blood found in his office. Paul's man tailing Carol calls in. She's led him to a motel where Bob is hiding. Paul and Perry go there to question him. However, Tragg has been following Perry (perhaps the fire escape ploy was less effective than Perry thought?) and arrests Bob and Carol. She hands Perry her half of the ""Salmon"". Eventually, the D.A. charges Carol with murder and Bob as an accessory, because the record of the parking ticket shows she was at the office building at that time.

Perry and Della go to Abigail and Carol's house. They find cancelled checks for $150 payments from Abigail to Ellis, going back five years. Perry goes to the T&D office and uses one of the checks, plus a court order, to put an end to Ellis' stalling. The clerk reluctantly hands over Tydings' blackmail file. Perry tells Ellis that he'll no longer have money problems, because by the time he gets out of prison for extortion and grand larceny, he'll be getting his old age pension. Perry tells Abigail that Burger is charging Carol with 1st degree murder, which means the gas chamber if she's convicted. He mentions that he knows who killed Tydings, but can't prove it to a jury. She realizes that he means her, but wonders if he's just a good guesser. He produces Carol's birth certificate, which shows that Abigail is the mother. Unwilling to risk her daughter's fate any more, she confesses. Tragg is waiting in the next office to arrest her, and Perry says he'll defend her. Tragg and Abigail leave, arm in arm. (If you'll forgive an editorial comment that doesn't really belong in a plot synopsis, this is perhaps the lieutenant's finest moment in the entire run of the series.)

Later at Perry's apartment, he has a bad cold and Della is mothering him. Della brings up the case, and Perry mentions that Carol had found out about her parentage while in high school and didn't care. She only avoided mentioning it to her mother to avoid embarrassing her. Della concludes that the murder to protect that secret turned out to be futile and senseless. ""All murders are,"" replies Perry."

Not only does another fan dancer show up, but so does her husband...dead, leaving Perry confused.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['ranch', 'overturned car', 'stabbed in the chest', 'stabbed to death', 'japanese sword', 'ostrich feather', 'horse', 'fan dancer', 'hotel', 'wall safe', 'landlady', 'telephone booth', 'pay phone', 'record store', 'nightclub', 'car crash', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"At night, a man on horseback rides up to the house at the Callender Ranch. He goes through a window and goes to a wall safe. A watchman sees his flashlight and shouts ""Who's there?"" The would-be burglar flees on his horse, and the watchman shoots at him. The next day, Perry and Della are driving home when they see an old car forced to crash by a reckless driver. They help an old woman out, but have trouble aiding her because she only speaks Spanish. A bilingual driver stops to assist, and takes her off to the hospital before Perry can get more information or give the woman the contents of her car. These prove to be an ostrich-feather fan with the initials ""L.F."" and a pair of high-heeled shoes. The woman in the car was certainly no fan dancer, so Perry assumes she must have been delivering it to someone else.

To keep this from getting too confusing, it needs to be noted now that two women bear the legal name Lois Fenton and stage name Cherie Chi Chi. The one who was born Lois Fenton (Susan Cummings) is always referred to as Lois in the episode. The one who was born Irene Kilby (Judy Tyler) and later changed her name to Lois Fenton is called Irene in court but otherwise is always called Cherie Chi Chi, so that name will be used here.

The next day, rancher John Callender (Hugh Sanders) arrives at Perry's office in response to an ad in the paper: ""If the 'fan dancer' who lost certain property wishes to recover it, write to Box #9052, L.A., Cal."" Callender explains how he tricked the paper's ad office into revealing Perry's identify and produces a letter from ""Lois Fenton, stage name Cherie Chi Chi"" authorizing Callender to pick up her property. He describes the property as a palomino quarter horse, which of course Perry says is completely wrong. Callender accuses him of a shakedown, and gives Perry until the next morning to surrender the horse. He's staying in Room 511 at the Richmel Hotel. Gertie (Connie Cezon) enters with a note from Arthur Sheldon (Scott Elliott), who's also looking for a horse belonging to ""the real Lois Fenton"". He wants Perry to come to Room 510 at the Richmel.

That evening, Perry and Della are at a club where Cherie Chi Chi is doing her fan dancing act. She comes to their table, and Perry says what he found wasn't a horse. She correctly describes the fan and shoes, so he agrees that the waiter can pick them up for her from Perry's car. She kisses him and leaves. Perry goes to the Richmel to see Arthur. Lois is hiding in the bathroom. Arthur says that Lois is married to Callender, but he mistreated her and she's left him. To force her back, the rancher says he has checks that her brother Jasper (John Brinkley) forged. The burglary at Callender Ranch was a botched attempt to retrieve the checks. Jasper stole Lois' horse for the effort, and the watchman is sure that his shot wounded the animal. Callender wants the horse so he can accuse Jasper of burglary. Perry orders Arthur to check out of the room immediately and bring Lois to his office the following day.

Perry calls Paul and tells him to put a man in Room 510 immediately and have another tail Arthur. Also, he needs Paul to start looking for the missing horse. The next morning, Perry and Paul knock on Callender's door. They get no answer, but the room is unlocked. Callender has been run through with a sword. Returning to 510, Paul calls the police, and Perry gets a report from Paul's man, Frank Faulkner (Robert Bice): He arrived at 2:20, but Arthur hadn't checked out yet, so he bribed Meeker the house detective (James Nolan) to let him hide in a broom closet. As he did so, Arthur ran out of Room 511 back to 510. At 2:23, a woman carrying a violin case went into 511 and came out at 2:32, still with the violin case. Later, a ""character"" wearing a buttoned-up overcoat in midsummer went into 511 and popped out again ten seconds later. When Lt. Tragg arrives, Paul goes to him and says he happened to have the room under surveillance. Tragg immediately thinks this is a Perry Mason case, and Paul grudgingly confirms Perry's interest, but states he doesn't know where Perry is at the moment. Tragg warns Paul that is Perry is holding back information, he'll throw the book at both of them. Tragg then marches over to 510, but Perry has already left.

Perry meets Della at a diner and warns her that Tragg has a man following him. The lieutenant thinks Lois killed Callender and Perry is harboring her. Della reports that Paul has found the horse. Perry tells Della to have Lois meet him at a record shop later. He next visits Cherie at her apartment. She explains that she received the Cherie Chi Chi act when Lois retired to marry Callender. She made herself as much like Lois as possible with clothes, etc., and even changed her legal name. She insists she visited Room 511 at 2 AM, not 2:23, to show him that Perry had returned her fan. However, Callender still thought Perry had the horse. At the record shop, Perry finally meets Lois face-to-face. She admits to hiding from Perry when he visited Arthur, and after he left impulsively going over to 511 to tell her husband she'd ""get back"" at him if he kept making trouble. When he laughed at this, she got frightened, ran out of the room and down the stairs, and did not return to the hotel that night. She also explains that at the time she left Callender, she intended to go back to fan dancing, as she'd made an agreement with her replacement that she could re-assume the Cherie Chi Chi act whenever she wanted. Unfortunately, the rancher had the only copy of that agreement. Perry, not wanting her to give the appearance of hiding, tells her to check into a motel near where Starlight is now stabled. In the flight from the burglary attempt, the horse only suffered a scratch, because the bullet went into the saddle.

Later, Perry and Lois visit the stables, and Perry has the stable hand (Dennis Moore) put the saddle in his car. Lois says that Arthur rented a room at a cheap boarding house as a place for Jasper, but he never appeared, so Arthur went there when he left the Richmel. He found a bloody fan there. When Lois arrived, she tried to wash it out and then threw it away. Perry thinks she's holding back from him, and decides they should go to the police. While he's dealing with stable paperwork, Lois rushes to his car and drives off.

The next day's newspaper headline reveals that she's been arrested, and things look bad for her. The police have two witnesses, house detective Meeker and Paul's operative Faulkner, who identified Lois as the woman who entered Room 511 at 2:23. Jasper has confessed that he took Starlight and attempted the burglary. The police have the saddle with the bullet. A bellboy says he saw the sword among Callender's possessions when he checked into the Richmel, so Jasper couldn't have seen and grabbed it and used it to stab Callender during his ten-second stay in the room. The police found Cherie, assured themselves that it wasn't her but Lois that the two witnesses identified, and released her.

In court, Dr. Lambert (Herbert Lytton) testifies that he found portions of an ostrich plume in Callender's stab wound. Meeker testifies that he saw Lois in the lobby at 2:20 - he pointed her out at the police shadow box. Faulkner explains the workings of the shadow box (basically an early version of the one-way mirror) and says that he, too, identified Lois - both times. Questioned by Perry, Faulkner says that Lois was very sulky the first time in the shadow box and that Sgt. Holcomb (Rusty Wescoatt) had them repeat the identification 20 minutes later. When court is recessed, Lois confirms that she was taken into the shadow box twice, but firmly denies that she was sulky the first time. Faulkner, feeling guilty for being forced to testify against the people he's working for, gives Perry a tip: Cherie is being voluntarily held in police custody.

When the trial resumes, Perry complains to the judge (Sydney Smith) that Cherie is being held incommunicado. Burger claims he has the right to hold material witnesses and doesn't even have to prove that he'll actually call them. However, he does agree to produce Cherie. Meanwhile, Jasper testifies that he did see the dead Callender when he popped into room 511. He told no one at the time, but the next day he went to the police and gave them a written statement. When Cherie enters the courtroom, the judge has her and Lois stand side-by-side. They clearly aren't identical twins, but look very similar in a general way. As Perry begins to question Cherie about the shadow box, Burger objects, and Perry explains to the judge what happened. The police had arrested Cherie under her new legal name of ""Lois Fenton"", and it was she whom Faulkner and Meeker identified on the first time in the shadow box. Realizing their mistake, they had the witnesses come back and make the identification again, this time with the original Lois. Finally, they had Lois come back again to the shadow box, with no identifying witnesses, just so she would confirm that she'd gone there twice. Burger catches Sgt. Holcomb before he can leave the court and vows to get to the bottom of this. In any case, Perry can now continue his examination of Cherie. She testifies that she's the one who entered Room 511 at 2:23, but Callender was already dead. Jasper's earlier ten-second visit to the room tends to confirm this. The judge says that unless Burger has some refuting evidence, he'll direct the jury to acquit.

Later, at a club, Perry admits that lawyers can get too cynical about their clients. He would have been better off if he'd believed from the first everything Lois told him. He explained that around 2 AM, Callender was showing Jasper the fan, illustrating that's what Perry had found so the horse (and the threat it represented to Jasper) still remained to be found. As the rancher held the fan in front of him, Jasper took up the sword and stabbed him right through the fan. He came back later to remove the fan, having realized that it could incriminate his sister. Arthur's peculiar movements that night were also just an attempt to deflect the police from Lois. Cherie had spent ten minutes in a room with a murdered man looking for that agreement that she'd relinquish the fan dancing act to Lois. As the night club act comes on - we see it's now Lois - the waiter delivers a memento from her to Perry - an ostrich-feather fan."

Hugo (Clem Bevans) and an engagement ring. She's to wed John Locke (Sherwood Price), who has a small chemical lab. Hugo tells her she should inform her uncle Martin Wellman (Alexander Campbell). The dictatorial uncle tells her she can't get married and has her look at papers he threatens to show her fiancé. With a nasty laugh he asks her ""Do you plan to have a big family? What if the kids take after your side?"" Nadine is reduced to tears. Later she visits John in his lab and tells him perhaps having a wife at this early stage in his career would be a burden. He reassures her that he loves her. While he's distracted, she steals some KCN (potassium cyanide) tablets, putting them in a saccharine bottle. After she leaves, John notices that his bottle of KCN has been moved.

When she returns home, Martin is asking for his nightly hot chocolate. He has spent the day with his lawyer and tells his other relative Marian Newburn (Fay Baker) and her husband Lester (Walter Coy) that he's going to leave all his money to the medical foundation that has been helping him. In the kitchen, Marian sees Nadine's ""saccharine"" bottle and sniffs it suspiciously. Elsewhere, Lester tells Nadine he was worried about her, but couldn't phone because Marian would misunderstand. When the hot chocolate is ready, Nadine takes it to her uncle. Soon she is summoned back to find him in death throes. He manages to say ""You poisoned me, you devil!"". Nadine screams.

Dr. Robert Denair (Barry Atwater), a psychiatrist, plays a tape recording of Nadine while under a truth serum. She talks about poisoning her uncle and throwing the pill bottle in Westside Lake after weighing it down with short from a shotgun shell. Denair has been treating her since three days after Uncle Martin's death, as she's been on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Perry wonders if what she says under the drug is necessarily true. Furthermore, Martin's death certificate listed the cause of death as coronary thrombosis. Perry tells the doctor he's under an obligation to report a crime to the police, but if it turns out there is no crime, he could be sued. To be better able to advise the psychiatrist, Perry sees Nadine at the hospital. He takes the tape and tape recorder from Denair, so no one will stumble on them. As he leaves, Nurse Wilson (Lida Piazza), who knows all about Nadine's case, is on the phone, spilling the beans to Lt. Tragg.

At Westside Lake, Perry has a snack at a hotdog stand while two children are in the lake. One of them, Arthur (Rickie Sorensen), shouts ""I found it!"" and shows Perry a saccharine bottle. At an analysis lab, Perry instructs Arthur to hand the bottle to Dr. Korbell (Steven Geray), who will check the contents for cyanide. Perry returns to his office to learn that Nadine has disappeared from the hospital. Dr. Korbell calls, reporting that Tragg arrived to take the bottle. Now the police want Perry for evidence tampering, so Perry goes to Tragg's office with Arthur, who says that Perry never had possession of the bottle. When The lieutenant checks with the crime lab, which reports that the bottle only contained saccharine. Tragg lets Perry leave with the tape recorder seized from his office, but keeps the tape of Nadine.

At Perry's apartment, Paul reports that police divers have found another bottle in Westside Lake, and it does contain KCN. Tragg now thinks that Perry planted the bottle of saccharine to confuse things, as the lakeside hot dog vendor swears he saw Perry throw something in the lake. Perry and Della intercept John as he leaves a market with two bags filled with groceries. He denies that Nadine stole any KCN, but Perry warns him that Burger will break down any attempt to lie on the stand. Della says it's a shame he and Nadine aren't married, since a husband can't testify against his wife. As a police officer approaches, John suddenly gets in his car and speeds off.

At the Newburn house, Perry is talking to Lester, who lets slip that he knows two bottles were found in the lake, which hadn't been made public. He claims he planted the saccharine bottle because he felt sorry for Nadine. However, he vows that he won't repeat his admission, even on the witness stand. After Perry leaves, Marian snaps at her husband, showing her jealousy of Nadine. She reminds Lester that Martin left all his money to her. Paul has learned that the police caught Nadine and John at the Mexican border - they're not married. In jail, Nadine tells Perry that the papers with which Martin threatened Nadine's marriage showed that her father had been committed to an institution for the criminally insane. She told John about this when he insisted on trying to get a quicky marriage. He told her, as does Perry, that experts agree there's no such thing as a ""bad seed"" that she could have inherited. Nadine doesn't know what to believe.

On the witness stand in Nadine's trial, John tries to avoid perjury while not accusing Nadine of stealing KCN, but his prevarications are transparent. Martin's physician Dr. Granby (Maurice Manson) testifies that although he had put coronary thrombosis on the death certificate, mainly because Martin had a history of heart disease, he has changed his mind since the autopsy. He now believes the cause of death was poisoning. On cross, he admits that while the autopsy proved there wasn't a coronary, it couldn't actually confirm cyanide poisoning because the body had previously been embalmed. Other than lack of other explanation, the main reason to cite poisoning as cause of death was Nadine's taped confession. Perry says that means his testimony is hearsay.

The time has arrived to hear arguments on the admissibility of the tape, so the judge (Morris Ankrum) has the jury retire. Burger says a confession, no matter how obtained, is admissible as long as he can corroborate it with other evidence, which he proceeds to do. He introduces (A) a shotgun shell from which shot has been removed,; (B) the bottle containing KCN and shot, and (C) the bottle of saccharine, also with shot. Perry calls Lester to refute prosecution claims that the defense attorney planted Exhibit C. However, Lester denies everything, just as he said he would. Perry requests that he be allowed to take the stand to impeach his own witness. He's holding the two bottles and becomes absorbed in them until the judge calls him out of his reverie. Perry then withdraws his objection to admitting the tape, saying he doesn't want his client to be labelled a murderess who got off on a technicality. The judge says he can't just waive his client's right and asks Nadine if she'd prefer new representation. She says that she trusts Perry.

With the jury back, Perry points out that while the shot in the shotgun shell A and in the saccharine bottle C are the same type, the shot in the poison bottle B is larger. Sgt. Davis (Paul Hahn), a police ballistics expert, confirms this, saying that the shot in Exhibit B was coated with what appeared to be ink. Perry introduces an old-fashioned pen holder, which Paul had taken from Lester's house while Sgt. Davis was being summoned. This type of pen holder contains shot, which helps keep the pen clean. Back on the stand, Lester now admits to throwing the bottle of poison in the lake, to protect his wife, who was the murderer. Marian shouts ""That's a lie!"" Lester says that Capt. Hugo told him he saw Marian put the cyanide in the chocolate. Over Marian's continued protests, the judge orders her held on suspicion of murder and Lester arrested for perjury.

At the Wellman house, Perry accuses Capt. Hugo of being the murderer. John had called the house right after noticing that some KCN was missing and told Hugo about it. So the Captain knew about the poison Nadine had taken and put it in the chocolate. The old salt admits it. Della wonders why, if he was out to protect Nadine, he didn't come forward when she was arrested. He replies that he had faith in Perry. They need to turn Hugo in, but he figures that he'll still come out ahead."

He finds her trailer a short distance away, just far enough for him to hook it up to his own vehicle and drive off with it, undetected. When Arlene discovers her trailer is gone, she seems to have nothing but her towel to cover herself, but somehow she makes it back to civilization intact, and engages Perry Mason to recover the trailer. Its greatest importance to her is the diary hidden in it, which records everything she has discovered in her efforts to clear her father, currently in prison for having stolen a large amount of cash while employed at a bank. She is being helped in her researches by her father's friend George Ballard (Ralph Moody), a bank examiner at the time of the defalcation, who wishes he could clear Dad, but didn't have his eyes on him the whole time.

Perry finds the trailer by placing an ad in the paper. Arlene is shocked by such a prosaic move, but George tells her that Mason is being clever, because what matters is success. Mason receives a call to go to a used car lot, and in turns calls Arlene to join him there. They find the trailer, and while Mason deals with the lot owner, pointing out that he's trying to sell stolen property, Arlene enters the trailer, only to find the diary missing. She pays off Mason, but later he receives another payment anonymously by mail. Perry decides he better keep looking into the case. The leads him to Dr. Chandler (Carl Betz), who provides medical services for bank employees, and is also romantically involved with Arlene, and thus ready to help however he can. Perry also encounters Chandler's nurse, Helen Rucker (Gertrude Michael), and a former bank employee now reduced to hustling pool for a living, Bill Emory (Peter Leeds).

Finally, Perry decides it's time to talk directly to Arlene's friend George, who is quite cooperative even though Perry's arrival interrupted George as he listened to his favorite radio show, featuring a sports commentator. As their conversation covers what George knows, he mentions in passing that he remembers the serial number of one particular bill, because it corresponded to a bet in a horse race which George made, and won a tidy sum. Perry realizes that this serial number appears on one of the bills with which he was paid through the mail - obviously a trap. As George is in the kitchen, Perry rolls down a window shade, puts the bill inside, and rolls it up again.

Outside, two plainclothesmen are staking out George's house. Detective Myers (Walter Reed) spots the window shade going up and down, shortly followed by Arlene entering. He thinks the man at the window looks familiar, and when his partner Sgt. Neil (Marc Pickard) asks if it could be Perry Mason, Myers says yes. Soon, it turns out that George has been murdered, Arlene is suspected, and Perry is on the hot seat as a possible accessory. D.A. Burger thinks the raising and lowering of the shade was some kind of signal to his client. Perry does manage to track down Arlene (thanks to the rather lame efforts of Dr. Chandler to keep her hidden) and convince her to turn herself in, but he's still in trouble.

At the trial, various secrets are revealed. George, of course, was the real culprit behind the original theft of the bank's money. Detective Myers didn't see Perry raise and lower the shade after all, that was a coincidence: The radio sports show on ended over half an hour before the time reported by the detectives, and Perry was only in George's house for a few minutes. Nurse Rucker was heavily involved in a scheme to get the money, working behind the back of the clueless Dr. Chandler, but she had an alibi for the murder. By process of elimination, the ringleader of the plot, the one who murdered George, was the pool hustler, Bill Emory.

Later, at a restaurant, Burger sees Perry and apologizes about the accusations he made. Perry offers to buy the D.A. a meal to show there are no hard feelings. He asks the waitress to bring Burger a serving of crow."

He gives her a week to pay him off, or he'll reveal their marriage to Elaine's rich boyfriend Ross Hollister (James Seay). Later, Elaine is swimming with Ross at his pool when his business partner Sheila Cromwell (Virginia Gregg) drops by. Ross has been checking the company books, but won't be finished until the next day. Ross is about to leave town, and the easiest way for Sheila to get the books - and Ross's report on them - is for Ross to take Elaine's spare apartment key so he can drop off the books and report there even if Elaine is asleep or away. He'll leave the key under the mat so Sheila can pick them up, also independently of Elaine's presence. Sheila and Elaine leave, and Ross reads his mail - a report from a private investigator that Harry has been visiting Elaine.

At his office, Perry gets a letter, stating that by going to Elaine's apartment he can find the license number of the car involved in the hit-and-run of his client Robert Finchley (Brett Halsey). A key is enclosed so he can let himself in. Perry goes there and cautiously uses the key. Inside, he finds Elaine asleep in her bed, so he goes back out and rings the doorbell. She lets him in and professes to know nothing about the hit-and-run, but while she's making coffee, Perry finds a license number written down. Elaine says she may need Perry's help, but he just calls her a good actress and leaves. Paul Drake traces the license number to Stephen Argyle (Donald Randolph), who claims to have been at his country club from well before to well after the time of the hit-and-run. For corroboration, he calls in his chauffeur, who turns out to be Harry Pitkin! Later, Harry goes to the country club and bribes the doorman to lie, backing up Argyle's alibi. However, insurance adjuster Francis Bates (Chet Stratton) discovers this dodge almost immediately. Argyle's and Harry's handling of the matter have ended up making him look obviously guilty of the hit-and-run. Bates suggests to Argyle that they bypass Perry and settle directly with Finchley.

Perry is grumbling about this shady dealing when he gets a call from Elaine, begging him to come to her apartment. There, she shows him Harry's corpse, with her revolver lying nearby. Charged with murdering Harry, she tells Perry about the arrangement involving her spare key. She doesn't understand how it ended up being sent to Perry. From Sheila, Perry learns that she and Ross were also in business with Argyle. She also says that Ross is doing business at various places in Canada, and she doesn't know where he'll be until he calls her.

At the preliminary hearing, with Sheila on the stand, Perry goes over the complicated scheme for dropping off the company books, then asks Sheila why she did nothing when she couldn't get into Elaine's apartment to pick them up. (The spare key went to Perry, not under the mat.) She tries denying that the books were important, but Perry counters that Ross must have been looking for a major problem with the accounting. Sheila then breaks down, prompting the judge to call a recess until the next day. In the interim, Sheila sends a telegram to Ross in Halsey, California. Paul is tailing her and soon knows about a whole series of telegrams that Sheila has been sending him there. When Sheila is back on the stand, Perry confronts her with this, but she still won't explain. Burger calls an Orange Country deputy sheriff (Ed Hinton), who testifies that Ross's body was found on the beach, shot about a week before Harry's murder.

The next day, Argyle is reading a newspaper with the headline ""HOLLISTER MURDERED - Mason's Theory Boomerangs"". Sheila enters, wielding a gun. She accuses Argyle of embezzling $187,000 from the business, murdering Ross when he discovered it, framing himself for hit-and-run as an alibi, then murdering Harry to cover that up. Argyle throws his drink in Sheila's face and grabs the gun. He can barely get his threat to her out when Lt. Tragg enters and arrests him. The gun wasn't loaded because people can get hurt that way, he explains. Perry congratulates Sheila on her performance. She was glad to help, since she was only lying because she thought she was protecting Ross, whom she loved.

In his office, Perry explains that once he knew the sequence of events, he concluded that Argyle murdered Ross, took the key from him, and sent it to Perry as part of framing himself for hit and run. He's interrupted by the appearance of Bates, whose insurance company is upset with him for paying off an incorrect claim. (Argyle may be a double murderer, but he didn't commit the hit and run.) Perry points out that the standard release form Bates used when he paid off Finchley admitted no liability, so Finchley gets to keep the money, and Bates should leave now. Perry, Della, and Paul toast Bates as he slouches off, probably to start looking for a new job."

On the way to stay with her friend Doris Stephanak (Karen Steele) in Los Angeles, her purse is stolen in Fresno and she's reduced to hitchhiking. She's picked up in a Lincoln driven by Michael Greeley (John Hubbard) (but Carol doesn't know his name). He drunkenly grabs at her, and in their struggle, he sideswipes a truck. In his office, D.A. Burger receives a report from his subordinate Hanley (Harlan Warde). The truck driver was killed, but Claire was just knocked out and awoke with cuts and bruises. Greeley has apparently vanished, as the prosecutors assume she was the drunk driver, and plan to charge her with theft and manslaughter.

Doris goes to Perry's office to get help for her friend, who has been arrested. Perry, going by the newspaper report, doesn't think this is his kind of case, but at Della's urging, he listens to Doris, who explains what really happened to Claire. Later, Paul has learned that the car the unknown man was driving is owned by Jerry Heywood (Grant Richards), the wunderkind of Magnum Studios, where he makes the magnificent (in 1958) salary of $3,000 per week. He denies being the driver or having loaned his car to anyone, but this is suspect because he recently had argued with his insurance company over a claim and as a result is currently uninsured.

Perry goes to see Heywood, but just gets a repetition of what Heywood told the police and is shown out by Heywood's butler and general factotum, Ernie Tanner (Fredd Wayne). Heywood calls the Greeley home and is told by Marcia Greeley (Helen Westcott) that her husband is out. They agree that he could cause trouble for them. Tanner tells Heywood he wants a raise, and alludes to Heywood having lied about being home the entire day of the crash. Angry, Heywood pushes him out of the room.

In jail, Claire recounts her encounter in the Lincoln, adding a detail she'd forgotten before - in the struggle, she got lipstick on the driver's shirt. Perry says he'll arrange bail and pays for Claire and Doris to stay at the Gateview Hotel under the name ""Joan Lewis"". They do so, but we see Greeley bribing a desk clerk at the Gateview to show him ""Joan's"" registration card. It occurs to Perry that the drunk driver might be desperate enough to go after Carol. Della calls her room at the hotel, but there's no answer. At the hotel, Perry peeks through the transom window and sees a body on the floor. Paul calls Lt. Tragg, and they enter the room together. The body is identified as Michael Greeley, a public relations worker at Magnum Studios. Tragg immediately suspects Claire.

Perry interviews Marcia without mentioned her husband's death. She says that Michael was at a premiere that night, and that her husband might give a ride to a woman but isn't the sort who'd leave her in the lurch. The discussion ends when Tragg calls Marcia with the grim news. Doris tells Perry that Carol had left the room because her arm was bothering her and she went to a drug store for aspirin. When she returned and saw the dead Greeley, she panicked and went to Doris' apartment, where the police found her. They've pieced together what happened and have dropped the theft and manslaughter charges against Carol, but Burger is going to try her for 1st degree murder.

Tanner calls to leave a tip - Heywood has a lodge near Fresno. Perry wants more information out of Tanner, who has an eye for the ladies. Paul's usual operative for this sort of thing isn't available, so Doris volunteers. Meeting Tanner at his regular bar and getting friendly with him, she learns that Heywood's car was apparently driven nearly 700 miles between the day before the crash, when it was serviced, and the crash.Tanner adds that he got fed up with Heywood, socked him, and quit. He's not afraid because he has something on Heywood - something that relates to Greeley.

Meanwhile, Perry gets a call from Marcia, saying she's coming to the office to give him something that belonged to her husband, but won't say what. Perry guesses that it's the lipstick-stained shirt, which would have helped confirm Carol's story when she was charged with theft and manslaughter, but now will just help Burger. He hopes he can figure out a way not to accept it from Marcia. Before she arrives, Perry gets a call from Doris. She had left Tanner's hotel room to get him some coffee and returned to find him collapsing in the bathtub. Perry goes there, finds Tanner shot dead, with a pillow having been used as a makeshift silencer. After he takes Doris home, he returns to the office to deal with Marcia, but his quandary is solved when Tragg barges in and takes possession of the shirt. It's a rainy night, and Tragg notices that Perry's shoes are wet. The lieutenant also spots a pillow feather on the office floor. Later in the police lab, Tragg tells Burger that the shirt isn't Greely's size and doesn't share the laundry mark of his actual shirts. Burger thinks Perry planted it to trip up the prosecution. He'll reverse the situation by simply doing nothing about the shirt.

In court, Perry is surprised when Burger doesn't introduce it as evidence. He cross-examines Heywood, who claims the car sat unused between when it was service and when it was stolen. Using the odometer data, Perry points out that this meant it was driven over 600 miles during a 9-hour period, in traffic. The drive is consistent with a round trip to the Fresno lodge (assuming he left earlier, not when he said the car was stolen). Heywood denies it. Perry gets the shirt from Burger and shows that it's laundry mark matches the one the Heywood is wearing. He claims that Greeley hired Tanner to spy on Heywood. When Heywood left for his lodge with Marcia, Tanner told Greeley, who went to the lodge and stole the car to strand them there, intending to blackmail Heywood to avoid a scandal. Marcia panicked when they found the car gone, which is why she accidentally packed Heywood's shirt in her own bag. Perry then accuses Heywood of the murder, but Marcia rises to his defense and confesses that she killed both men. She even apologizes to Heywood for causing him so much trouble.

Later, Tragg tells Perry that he was very lucky that Marcia confessed, because there was no way he could have linked her to the killings. Perry asks if, in their long acquaintance, Tragg had ever thought him stupid. Tragg says he thought Perry was unscrupulous, conniving, and unprincipled - but never stupid. Perry then asks what the lieutenant would call someone who was at a murder scene in wet shoes with feathers spread around but didn't check his shoes for them. ""Stupid"", answers Tragg, and he immediately concludes that the feather in Perry's office got there on someone else. Eliminating Perry and himself, he realizes it had to be Marcia. ""Oy gevalt!"" he says as he leaves, somewhat abashed."

Agnes Sims (Betty Lou Gerson) sees him and tells her partner Edmund Arthur Lacey (Robert H. Harris) about it. Lacey tries to follow George, but gets a powerful sock in the face for his trouble. He goes to Paul Drake's office and explains his lonely-hearts magazine to Paul, drawing attention to an ad from an attractive 23-year-old woman with a big inheritance. Lacey needs to prove to the postal authorities that this isn't a fraud, and his own efforts to find her have been unsuccessful (and painful). Paul charges him $200, then composes a letter in which he frankly admits he's writing because she's rich, and which he'll mail to Box 96.

In her home, Marilyn Clark (Kathleen Crowley) reads a letter that sounds like Paul's to George, her step-brother. However, this letter is from a Charles B. Bartleby. Despite George's doubts, she answers it with an invitation to meet. When she meets Charlie, he's unsure of himself and something of a rube, but Marilyn is charmed. Later, Lacey phones Paul to call him off, saying that Marilyn has revealed herself, and the postal authorities are satisfied. In fact, Lacey is with Charlie, who has dropped his rustic accent, and Charlie's accomplice Delores (Anna Navarro), who plays the jealous other woman in the ""blow off"" of their con game. Although Marilyn might be good for up to $75,000, Charlie will only let Lacey have $1000. Lacey can't go to the police, because he interfered with the U.S. mails when he substituted Charlie's letter for Paul's original one.

The con game enters its next stage as Charlie tells Marilyn that he needs money to pay for drilling for oil on his land, or he'll lose everything. Her solution is that they get married, and they kiss. Paul goes to Perry, worried that Lacey's shenanigans could cost him his license. Deciding he needed to know what was going on, he tailed Marilyn (who really is a wealthy heiress) and saw her getting a certified check for $50,000 from her bank. Marilyn also met Charlie, whom Paul recognized as a well-known con man. Paul saw Charlie purchase a wedding ring, then pick up two airline tickets to Rio at a travel agency. Perry recommends that Paul inform the bunco squad.

Lacey is lurking around outside Charlie's motel bungalow when Marilyn arrives and enters. They're about to get married, and Marilyn gives Charlie the certified check. Charlie brings out some champagne, but he's still doing his bumbling act and has to hunt around for glasses. Delores enters and goes into her screaming, furniture wrecking act, which frightens Marilyn off. As she's leaving, Delores gives Charlie a good whack on the head, and he falls to the floor. Lt. Kramer (Robert B. Williams) of the bunco squad enters, expecting to arrest Charlie and Delores, but Charlie is dead.

A distraught Delores confesses to Lt. Tragg, who informs her that Charlie wasn't kill by the blow, but by poison. He orders an APB for the arrest of Marilyn. George asks Perry for help and brings her to Marilyn. She explains that a year ago, her sister fell for Charlie's con game, became pregnant by him, and committed suicide after he left with her money. She left a diary with the detailed story, giving Marilyn the information she needed to lure Charlie into trying the same thing with her, so she could turn him over to the authorities. Poison was never part of the plan. Marilyn doesn't want to turn herself in, but Perry makes it a condition for helping her.

Perry interviews Delores and points out that she and Lacey are also possible suspects in the murder. On his way out, he has to dodge an ashtray thrown at him by the temperamental Delores. A little later, Lacey is taking money from the safe in his private office, when Delores starts shooting at the door from the outside, shouting ""Assassino!"". She enters, but has exhausted her rounds. Tragg enters and arrests both her and Lacey. They were tipped off about Lacey by Agnes, who realized that he was absconding with her share of the lonely-hearts profits as well as his own.

In court, Lacey can't explain what he was doing outside Charlie's bungalow on the night of the murder. George admits that if anything happened to Marilyn, he would inherit her fortune. Delores testifies that on the day the blow off concluding the con game was to occur, she followed their standard procedure. She packed, paid off the motel bill, picked up airline tickets, then waited out of sight until the moment for her betrayed woman act came. She refuses to answer Perry's cross-examination questions, so Perry agrees to defer them until after Burger has a chance to explain the consequences to her. The autopsy surgeon (Robert McQueeney) testifies that Charlie was killed with prussic acid, which was in the champagne bottle. After adjournment, Paul and Della go to the motel to reenact how the poisoning could have occurred. Perry's unhappy, because Marilyn could have added the poison while Charlie was getting glasses, and he can't find an alternative. Della draws a comparison to a ship in a bottle, which gives Perry an idea.

Delores is back on the stand, now prepared to answer Perry. He goes on the attack immediately, pointing out that when she picked up tickets (to Hawaii) at the travel agency, she could have found out about the two to Rio that Charlie had already picked up. He was planning on abandoning her and really going off with Marilyn. He produces a hypodermic syringe like one that Delores bought the day before the murder. She responds that she's a diabetic, as her doctor can verify. Perry seems nonplussed for moment, but then points out that a diabetic's syringe would have a needle much shorter than the 2-inch needle on the one Delores bought. However, it's perfect for injecting poison through the cork of a champagne bottle. Delores breaks down and confesses. ""If I don't have him, nobody can!""

In his office, Perry explains that Delores shot at Lacey just to avert suspicion from herself. She had no intention of hitting him. The one thing that got Perry thinking about her was the wedding ring Charlie bought, which he wouldn't need unless he planned to really marry Marilyn."

Her wealthy but ailing father is being blackmailed by a disreputable private investigator for embezzling and she's afraid if her fiancé finds out, he'll break off their engagement.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Christian Nyby'],"['', '', '']",[],"['blackmail', 'degaussing', 'fingerprint', 'estimating time of death', 'bus station locker', 'ice pick', 'tape recording', 'water thrown in face', 'rooming house', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"Private investigator Arthur West (Dan Riss) has tracked down derelict J.J. Stanley (James Bell) at a flophouse to discuss the $50,000 J.J. embezzled from the Texas National Bank ten years earlier. J.J.'s partner Ned Bain (Carl Benton Reid) is now rich and respectable. West insists that J.J. help blackmail Ned. Later, a car parks in front of the Colegrove Apartments and Harriet Bain (Virginia Vincent) - looking what in 1958 would probably be called ""mousy"" - gets out and goes to Apartment 2A, West's residence. He plays a tape recording of J.J. and her father discussing a payoff to cover up the embezzlement. Harriet refuses to believe it and runs out in tears.

She goes to Perry's office and tells her tale to Della, as Perry is in court. Harriet knows about the tape because her father has heart trouble and needs her help with things like handling phone calls. She explains that she wants to avoid bad publicity because of Addison Doyle (Robin Hughes), a friend of her stepsister Sylvia (Tina Carver), with whom she is now engaged. Even Harriet is surprised that Addison picked her over the more glamorous Sylvia. Since Addison is from a conservative old Boston family, a scandal could ruin things for her. Although Perry is set to fly to London for a law conference, Della talks him into delaying his departure to help Harriet. Paul knows West as a slick and unscrupulous operator and will put a tail on him in the hopes of leading to J.J. Perry also needs Della to purchase a small magnet for him.

When West plays the tape for Perry, the attorney insists on examining it to check that it hasn't been spliced together. As West shows him the tape, Perry takes out a cigarette from his cigarette case, which also has the magnet hidden inside. In this way he degausses the tape and when West tries to play it again, there's just silence. West says he'll need time to figure out what's wrong, so Perry leaves, having succeeded in delaying West's plans. West takes the tape recorder and a bottle of booze across the hall to 2B, where J.J. is now staying. Later, he calls Perry and says he has another copy of the tape.

Harriet tells Perry that Ned now knows about the tape and insists it's a fake, so they go to see him. He explains that he was an oil wildcatter who got financing from J.J. When he struck it rich, J.J. was paid back and got his share of the profits, but later turned to drink. The last Ned saw of him was when he gave him a handout six months ago. Ned refuses to pay blackmail, but authorizes Perry to get the tape back however else he can, in order to protect Harriet and her impending nuptials. Perry could use help tracking down J.J., but Ned says he doesn't have an address or even a phone number for him. On his way out, Perry passes Addison and Sylvia, who seem to be acting rather friendlier toward each other than one might expect of prospective in-laws.

That night, Ned gets out of bed, already fully dressed. He takes a bag engraved with his initials with him and sneaks out of the house, but Harriet notices him go. He goes to J.J. at his apartment and tells him that his motto is ""Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today - or tonight."" Downstairs, a cab is waiting and the driver (Leonard Bell) notices a car park behind him. The car is the one we saw Harriet driving earlier. Ned comes out, no longer carrying his case, goes to the cab, and tells the driver to return him to the corner where he picked him up.

Paul has learned that J.J. is staying in 2B. Perry and Della go to meet West. There's a note for Perry on the door to 2A saying that West is out and they should come in and wait. Perry is doubtful, and then Harriet screams and rushes out of 2A, saying she found a body in the kitchen which she thinks is J.J.'s. Perry says ""It's a trap!"" (Cf. ) He decides to check out 2B, telling Della to ring the bell if anyone is coming up on the elevator. Inside J.J.'s apartment, Perry finds nothing particularly suspicious, but he seems oddly interested in the food contained in a deep freezer. He gets the signal from Della and notices West leading her and Harriet into his apartment. Perry comes in behind them, pretending he just got there. West says he's been away much of the night, playing poker. When he sees the body in his kitchen, he seems surprised and worried. He calls the police. When they arrive, Lt. Tragg learns from Dr. Hanover (Dennis King Jr.) of the Coroner's office that death was caused by bleeding from puncture wounds, caused by something like an ice pick. From the body temperature, he estimates death occurred no later than 3 AM, but will know more later. Tragg's men find an ice pick.

In the office, Paul reports that Tragg knows all about Perry's sojourn into Apartment 2B. West had left a tape recorder set to start recording sounds in the hallway at 9 AM, and it picked up everything Perry, Della, and Harriet had said. Tragg has had everyone in the Bain household fingerprinted. After learning that Ned has suffered a heart attack he rushes to him at home. He learns from Ned's doctor (Alan Gifford) that Ned will pull through although with great difficulty and that the attack must have been caused by severe strain of some sort. He also hands Harriet a tape reel in its metal case that he found under Ned's pillow. Perry takes it and asks Harriet if she left the house that night or knows if her father left the house. She lies on both counts. Addison says Sylvia was at his place that night, but it was all ""perfectly proper"". Tragg arrives, takes the tape from Perry, and arrests Harriet on suspicion of murder - her fingerprints were all over the ice pick found in 2A.

In court, Tragg is testifying about the ice pick, which he says originally came from the Bain house. On cross-examination, he acknowledges that members of the Bain family might be expected to have their prints on their own ice pick. More reluctantly, he admits that since the police were able to take the pick to their lab without disturbing the fingerprints, someone wanting to frame Harriet might be able to transport it from the Bain house to 2A also without marring the prints. Dr. Hanover testifies that blood of J.J.'s relatively rare type, AB, was found on the ice pick. Based on post-mortem lividity, rigor mortis, and body temperature, he has narrowed the time of death to between 2 and 3 AM. He admits that changes in the ambient temperature would affect these findings, but he carefully checked the apartments temperature, and it was normal.

Armed with a doctor's statement that Ned is able to testify, Burger calls him as a hostile witness, and he's wheeled in on a stretcher. When asked if the embezzlement charge against him is true, he doesn't answer. Burger then asks if Harriet knew the charge to be true, and Ned is again silent. From the defense table, Harriet shouts ""Leave him alone! I knew it was true!"" Burger has a final question for Ned - When did he last see J.J.? - and this time Ned answers: 11:30 the night he died. On cross, Ned says that J.J. called him hoping to make a deal that cut West out. Harriet withdrew the money from the bank, knowing it was to pay off J.J.

The next prosecution witness, West, perjures himself by claiming that J.J. came to him with the blackmail tape, and West merely informed the Bane family about it. When Burger is finished, Perry seems absorbed in a book that Paul brought into court for him, and he needs to be prodded to begin cross-examination. He gets West to admit that he was paying J.J.'s rent for 2B and other expenses. Perry suddenly accuses him of putting J.J.'s body in the freezer in order to confuse the time of death. Type AB blood in the freezer would corroborate this, so the judge (Morris Ankrum) moves the trial to Apartment 2B. They do find blood stains in the freezer, and Dr. Hanover confirms that this ruins his time-of-death calculations. The judge orders further investigation of the blood stains and the arrest of West on suspicion of murder.

At the Bain house, headlines in a paper Addison is holding recap these events, as Perry and Sylvia arrive. Perry gets a call from Della and announces that Harriet was released and is on her way home. Sylvia and Addison agree that it would be tactful if he's not there when Harriet arrives, so he leaves. He goes to a bus depot and opens a locker that contains the case with initials N.B. He checks inside, and it's full of cash. Suddenly, he's surrounded by police and Perry, who tells Tragg, ""Here's your killer.""

Perry is hoping to finally leave for London and catch at least part of the conference, and asks Paul to take him to the airport. Paul knows that the key clue had to due with the book on criminal investigation that he brought Perry from the Bain house, but wonders what exactly it was. Perry says that he caught Addison looking at that book, and it cited a case of using a freezer to confuse time of death. Addison's motive was the $75,000 bribe, which was a sure thing compared to the risk of Harriet losing her money (statute of limitations didn't apply to the bank suing for return of Bain's ill-gotten gains) or just refusing to marry him over Addison's inability to resist Sylvia. It turns out the Sylvia didn't even really want him. She was just trying to get Harriet free of his influence. Della enters with Harriet, who is now ""all dolled up"". Della has arranged for her to leave on a vacation on the same flight to London Perry is taking. She figures that the new Harriet will need a reliable escort. Perry escorts them both out, leaving Paul holding the bag."

Janet Morris (Bethel Leslie) accuses him of stealing from her husband. He says he'd never do anything against Dr. Morris, but he is carrying a wad of bills - $92,000! He says he's delivering it to Morris. At the police station, Morris (Shepperd Strudwick) confirms Dave's story, but isn't very forthcoming about why he's been renting that apartment under the name ""M. Morris"". The Robbery Division lieutenant (Arthur Hanson) returns the cash to Morris, but says he'll inform the Treasury Department about the suspicious amount of cash. Morris accuses Janet of spying on him, but she denies it, and says she didn't know Dave was his friend.

In Perry's office, Janet admits that her marriage is an unhappy one, and that her husband has turned to his nurse, Gladys Strome (Maxine Cooper) for the affection lacking at home. Now that there may be trouble with the government over the $92,000, she wants Perry to defend her community property interest in the cash. Meanwhile, Dr. Morris decides the time has come to act and calls Dave, who is now back home in Loganville CA, where his wife (Jeanette Nolan) runs a diner. He agrees to come back to L.A., and after hanging up takes another drink from his flask.

At a tiny airport, Morris is preparing for a flight in his private plane when Janet arrives. She has a thermos of coffee for him and says she's now ready to give him a divorce. Morris says he thinks that's just some scheme that will cost him more money. Airport manager Phil Reese (Woodrow Chambliss) has been observing this exchange. Later, we see the doctor's plane flying erratically and crashing, then a newspaper with the headlines ""Prominent physician in plane crash. Cause of fatal accident unknown."" Lt. Tragg visits Reese, who tells him that a radio operator heard the pilot report being very tired, then mumbling unintelligibly. He gives Tragg the thermos that Janet put in the plane and was found in the wreckage. The lieutenant goes to Janet and tells her that even though all that was left in the plane was an almost completely destroyed corpse, the coroner was able to detect morphine sulfate in the stomach.He tells her that she better get a good lawyer because the D.A. wants to talk to her. She doesn't know Perry's number, but Tragg tells it to her. Later, he tells Perry that in addition to community property, Janet is the sole beneficiary of a $125,000 life insurance policy Morris took out. ""Guys have been murdered for less,"" he says.

Paul reports that Gladys is the sole support of her mother and younger brother, but has left on vacation. Morris left her $50,000 in his will. Also, the $92,000 in cash is missing. Perry goes to the diner in Loganville, where he finds Mrs. Kirby castigating a workman for dropping screws, which she assumes she'd end up being charged for. She tells Perry that as far as she knows, Dave has hit the bottle again and is on skid row in L.A. The last she saw of him was when he got the call from Morris. He vanished, along with $154 in sales tax money. She interrupts the interview to tell the cook to use halves of pickles instead of whole pickles as a garnish on sandwiches, to save money. Then she tells Perry that the two of them are wasting each other's time.

Later, Mrs. Kirby comes to L.A. and reports her husband as a missing person. She's brought to the D.A.'s office, where Burger and Tragg insinuate that the $92,000 might have been a motive for Dave to kill Morris. Mrs. Kirby angrily denies the possibility, saying that Dave has loved Morris since they were pilots together in World War 2. After she leaves, Burger says that the fact that Dave was also a pilot was news to him. He sends Tragg and a team to comb the plane crash site. When they arrive, they find Paul and his men, who have just found a good luck medallion inscribed with the name Dave Kirby. Perry had the same idea as Burger, but sooner. Tragg points out that this only served to save him a lot of work, as he makes Paul hand over the medallion.

Janet is on trial for murdering Dave while attempting to murder her husband. Phil Reese testifies about what he observed, and is amazingly specific about times, the number of people at the airport, even the license plate numbers of Janet's car and the car she parked next to. On Perry's cross-examination, he explains that he has a ""photographic memory"" and illustrates it with a detailed description of Burger's dress, down to a loose button on one sleeve of his jacket. However, he was elsewhere when the plane took off and didn't observe that.

During a weekend recess, Perry visits Gladys' whiny mother (Helen Brown) and oafish brother Arthur (Al Lettieri). For a $100 bribe, Arthur reveals that Gladys is living in Boca de Oro, Mexico under an alias. Perry flies there and finds her with Morris. He admits changing plans at the last minute, having Dave fly the plane to Salt Lake City in order to throw Janet off the scent while he and Gladys went south. They took the $92,000 in cash, on which Morris had already paid the tax. He got a divorce in Mexico and married Gladys. He has no intention of returning, but after some goading by Perry, he says that the next day they'll take the first plane out of Boca de Oro. After Perry leaves, Gladys doesn't understand until Morris points out that he didn't tell Perry what direction that plane would be taking.

Back in court, Perry is cross-examining Lt. Tragg and asks why the police, with all their facilities, couldn't find Morris. The lieutenant answers is ""We have"", as the doctor and nurse enter the courtroom, looking unhappy. When Burger calls Morris to the stand, Perry objects, arguing that California law doesn't recognize Morris' Mexican divorce, so he's legally married to Janet and therefore can't testify against her. The judge (Owen Cunningham) agrees, so Burger calls Gladys. She testifies that Janet once told her that only death would set Morris free from her. Perry asks her if Morris ever prescribed morphine for Dave, to deal with the aftermath of his alcoholic binges. She doesn't remember.

Burger's next witness is Mrs. Kirby, who identifies the medallion as one she bought as a gift for Dave. She knew nothing about Dave flying the plane in place of Morris until the D.A. informed her. On cross-examination, she testifies that Morris did in fact prescribe morphine sulfate for Dave. She admits that she has filed life insurance claims totaling $15,000. Perry has jeweler's records showing that the medallion (platinum, so it wouldn't be consumed by a fire) was only delivered to her the morning of the crash, so she must have taken it to him at the airport that day. He says she also brought him a bottle of whiskey loaded with morphine. She tries to deny having gone to the airport, but Perry points out that the license number Reese mentioned as parked next to Janet's is for her car. He asks if Reese is in the courtroom, but Mrs. Kirby shouts ""Don't bother!"" and confesses. Dave was no good to her alive, so she thought maybe he'd be worth something dead.

Later, Paul asks what tipped Perry off. He mentions that it was very out of character for the penny-pinching Mrs. Kirby to buy her husband an expensive present. She must have had an ulterior motive. Della enters with bread and cold cuts to make sandwiches, since she's been losing weight from always working late on cases. Perry and Paul dig in, and Della seems resigned to going hungry again."

He reminds her that her next monthly $1000 payment is due tomorrow, and offers to leave her alone and turn over the Gallagher files to her for a lump-sum payment of $10,000. They arrange to meet at Ferrold's, a French restaurant, the next evening, and Marian abandons her trip. As they leave, we see that they have been observed by another man. Marian goes home and confesses to her husband Arthur (Peter Adams) that she's being blackmailed over Gallagher. Meanwhile, the mystery man at the terminal turns out to be a P.I. hired by Charles Gallagher (Paul Picerni). He tells his client about Carlin, but he didn't overhear his conversation with Marion.

At Ferrold's, headwaiter Pierre (Jan Arvan) gets a call from Carlin, cancelling the reservation and requesting him to tell Marian to come to his home instead. Marian arrives, and as she is getting this message, she happens to hear Perry and Della arrive and claim their reservations. Perry and Della are seated, and Perry is shocked to discover that coffee costs $1. Pierre comes over with a phone with a call from a woman unknown to Perry, but we see is Marian, calling from inside the restaurant. She retains him to take the pay-off to Carlin, which she has a waiter deliver to him. Perry and Della go to the Carlin house, but Carlin claims complete ignorance of what they're talking about. After they leave, Arthur Fargo emerges from another room, and we learn that he and Carlin are partners in the blackmail scheme. However, Arthur has learned from Marian that she's been paying twice what he and Carlin had agreed. He demands his share of the extra money and leaves, saying he'll be back for it in a couple hours. Perry has remained across the street, and observes a woman walk up to Carlin's house and enter. Later, Paul arrives to help, but as Perry is filling him in, there's a big explosion and fire at the Carlin place.

Later, the fire department takes a corpse out of the house. It's burned beyond recognition but Paul describes the build of the body and Perry says ""That's Carlin."" Paul mentions that there was a bullet in his head. The next day, Paul talks to a waiter (Jean Del Val) at Ferrold's and learns that Pierre quit his job the previous night. He also gets a look at the reservation book, and learns enough to identify Perry's mystery client as Marian. Perry and Paul go to the Fargo home, where they first notice a dry spot on the drive, indicating that the car had only been driven away within the past hour, when it finally stopped raining. Next, they look in a window and see a man's body. Going inside, they see he was murdered, and find a note from Marian to Arthur saying she's taking the bus to Harristown. Perry works out that the bus left L.A. too early for Marian to have committed the murder - if she was on it.

Paul flies to Harristown, intending to confirm Marian's alibi. He arrives at the station just before the bus and has Marian paged. However, the police are there too, and they arrest her for the murder of her husband. Another arriving passenger, Diana Maynard (Dorothy Green), offers to help, once she has put a patch on her mildly infected eye that's bothering her. She agrees to dictate a statement that she and Marian rode together on the bus all the way from L.A. Perry is glad to have this, but is troubled that there are other witnesses who claimed she got on later, at Wayne City. Gallagher arrives at Perry's office, but Della tells him he's left. Gallagher, Marian's brother, was an escaped convict in his youth. Since then he became prosperous, but Carlin knew his background. He wants to help by turning himself in, but Della says coming clean would give the D.A. a motive for Marion, so he decides to keep out of sight.

In court, Perry easily demolishes the testimony of an airport parking attendant who claims to identify Marian as the woman he briefly saw while she was wearing dark glasses and a floppy hat. However, he's unable to shake the story of a charter pilot who testifies that he took Marian to Wayne City in time for her to catch the Harristown bus from there. Later, D.A. Burger receives an anonymous call, tipping him off to the significance and whereabouts of Diana Maynard. From the French-sounding accent, Burger guesses that it's Pierre, whom he like to have picked up. Lt. Tragg tells him that the police have been looking and Pierre is nowhere to be found, but he has no trouble following the tip and arresting Diana at the hotel where Perry has been hiding her. Burger interviews her, points out inconsistencies in her account, and advises her not to commit perjury.

At the next court session, Perry calls Diana to the stand, but only asks her about arriving in Harristown. He then objects to Burger's attempt to cross-examine her about when Marian got on the bus. The judge agrees that cross-examination must relate to matters brought up in direct examination. So Burger calls Diana as a prosecution witness and gets Diana to tell her new story, that Marian got on at Wayne City. Now it's Perry's turn to cross-examine, and since she testified about what she saw and is still using her eye patch, Perry challenges her ability to identify people. While being tested, she correctly identifies Lt. Tragg, the P.I. who baby-sat her for Perry, and the parking lot attendant. However, she wasn't in court when the attendant testified and had been kept away from news of the trial. The only way she could recognize him was because she was the one who drove Marian's car to the airport, where she took the charter plane to Wayne City and boarded the bus there. Caught in a lie, Diana admits her role, but points to another man in court as the murderer. That man tries to leave to court, but he's caught and his disguise is removed. It's the supposedly dead Samuel Carlin!

Later, we learn that Gallagher has been pardoned for his earlier crimes. The body identified as Carlin was actually Pierre, who was making money as Carlin's errand boy. The phone call to Burger was made by Carlin, adopting a fake French accent. Perry and Della then head back to Ferrold's to solve the remaining mystery: What could make a cup of coffee be worth a dollar?"

McLaglen'],"['', '', '']",[],"['taxi driver', 'gun', 'handbag', 'confession to murder', 'split personality', 'psychiatrist', 'mink stole', 'nightclub', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"At Reed Industries, junior partner Harry Vance (Paul Langton) is heatedly defending the merits of the proposed Anderson deal to doubtful senior partner Dave Reed (Carleton G. Young) when Dave's ex-wife Helen (Constance Ford) arrives with her brother Bob Kramer (Denver Pyle) to pick up the Reeds' young son Tommy (Kelly Junge Jr.). Dave tells Bob that he wants sole custody of Tommy, and he can prove Helen is an unfit mother. Bob replies that if Dave tries anything, he'll ""not live to appear in court.""

That night, a somewhat drunk, fur-clad woman saunters into the Burgundy Club. She's either Helen Reed or her twin, but is known there as Joyce Martel. Johnny Hale (Murray Hamilton), the club's owner, takes her into his private office. He's unhappy that he hasn't seen her for a week, but she's in a good mood, emphasizing that she needs to be herself. She gives Johnny a playful kiss, which he returns with passion.

Later, Bob arrives at Helen's apartment, having been informed that she's sick again. She describes a nightmare in which she was wearing daring clothes and a mink, even though she's very allergic to fur. She also remembers smoking and drinking, things she never does. Worst of all, she recalls going into an apartment and seeing Dave lying on the floor with a bullet hole in his head and a gun nearby. She asks her maid Sarah (Louise Truax) to get her pills from her purse, but the purse isn't hers - it's monogrammed ""J.M."" and contains a gun. Helen says the purse and gun are from her nightmare.

The next day, Helen and Bob repeat their story to Perry, with one additional detail - the gun belongs to Bob. They're worried that there might be truth in Helen's dream and if so, Bob could be charged with the murder. (Because of the death threat he made in front of Harry, of course. Where does Perry get these clients?) Perry goes to Reed Industries where he's made an appointment with Dave, whose private secretary Cora Dunbar (Carole Mathews) tells him the boss hasn't come in yet. He's going to wait, but he gets a call from Della that Paul needs to see him immediately at 622 South Barry, Westwood. (Barry is a real street in the Westwood area, but it doesn't have addresses in the 600s.)

Perry arrives to find this is the Crest Apartments, and Paul has discovered that a key in the ""J.M."" purse is to Apartment 310, which is registered to a Joyce Martel. Using the need to return the purse to its owner as an excuse, they enter the apartment with the key and discover Dave's body. They look around a bit, and find plenty of items with the ""J.M."" monogram. Paul also finds a photo of ""Joyce"", and when he later shows it to Perry, the attorney learns that Joyce and Helen are the same person. Lt. Tragg arrives and notes that no self-respecting private eye would carry that purse with a daytime suit, so he takes it.

When Perry arrives at Helen's actual apartment, he finds a cab driver (Frank Jenks) shouting through the door that he needs to return the mink stole he's carrying to her, or he'll be in trouble. She left it in his cab last night when he drove her from her place to the Burgundy Club and later to the Crest Apartments. The allergic Helen vehemently denies the fur is hers, but the cabby recognizes Sarah from when he first picked up Helen. He knows he couldn't have mistaken two people. To Perry, this means that there's a witness to Helen having been in the area of Dave's murder around the relevant time.

Back at the law office, Bob explains that Joyce Martel was originally Helen's imaginary playmate, some of whose imaginary actions started becoming real. There's a knock on the back door Paul always uses, but it's Tragg. He announces that Bob's gun was indeed the murder weapon, and Dave was shot between 9 and 11 PM. He say's that Bob received a note from Cora saying that Dave asked him to come to Apartment 310. Sure enough, Bob has the note in his coat, but says he never read it. Just as he received it, he got the phone call that Helen was sick, and forgot about the note. Tragg is unimpressed and arrests Bob.

Paul has informed Perry about Joyce's trips to the Burgundy Club, so he goes there and barges into Johnny's private office, where he finds the club owner in the company of Helen-as-Joyce, complete with mink stole and sassy attitude. Later, Dr. Maitland (Abraham Sofaer), a psychiatrist who recently started treating Helen, explains the concept of multiple personalities. Helen perceives Joyce's actions as nightmares, but Joyce is fully aware that she and Helen inhabit the same body. Joyce's lack of a fur allergy isn't their only big difference - the doctor believes Joyce might be fully capable of committing murder.

In court, Burger is presenting his case. Sarah testifies about seeing Bob's gun in the purse. Cora explains that she sent that note to Bob on Dave's instructions. He told her that he knew of Helen's indiscretions through detectives he'd hired, and intended to prove them to Bob. If they didn't relinquish custody of Tommy, Dave planned to pillory Helen in the press. On cross-examination, Perry asks about Cora's relationship with Harry. She admits that Harry bought her a ticket for a vacation in Mexico, but she was ""going to reimburse him later"". She denies leaking to Harry information that Dave wanted kept from him, but in the process starts to refer him as ""Harry"" before correcting herself to ""Mr. Vance"". Harry testifies about Bob's death threat to Dave. On cross, he relates that Dave had summoned him to Apartment 310 to be a witness to his encounter with Bob, but when he arrived around 10, Dave was already there. He delayed reporting the death, and even bought Cora the ticket to Mexico, so that a check Dave had signed to seal the Anderson deal would clear.

Johnny testifies that he'd known Helen for two years, but on cross clarifies that he knew her only as Joyce. This opens up the issue of Helen's multiple personalities, despite Burger's customary sputtering about Perry's courtroom theatrics. First, Dr. Maitland explains that Helen is a ""true schizophrenic"". With Helen on the stand, he demonstrates her strong allergic reaction to the mink stole. Then Dr. Maitland talks to her and educes the Joyce personality. She's delighted to have her fur again, and doesn't mind admitting that she took Bob's gun, wanting to make Bob think that Helen did it. Perry accuses Joyce of the murder, but Johnny protests that he won't let her take the blame for his crime. He had a jealous rage when he saw Dave with Joyce, not realizing that they meant nothing to each other.

Later, Perry announces that Dr. Maitland holds out strong hopes for Helen's complete cure. Della thinks it's a shame that this means she'll remain allergic to fur."

Contact Elston Carr, 123 North Renuda Drive, Los Angeles California. WARNING Impostors will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" In his camera shop in San Francisco, Mr. Lowell (Otto Waldis) and Doris Hocksley Jackson (Toni Gerry), who lives in the apartment building next door, read this personal ad from a local paper. Lowell says there can't be that many Hocksleys around, and they should try for it.

At the home of Elston Carr (Anthony Jochim), his nephew Alan Neil (Warren Stevens) checks his messages with secretary Rebecca Gentrie (Olive Deering). Several women have called, but Alan tells Rebecca that he loves only her. Doris is waiting for him in Carr's study to state her claim. She says her father was Adam Hocksley and produces her birth certificate, evidence of where she's lived, etc., but Alan is interested in things like photographs and letters. She says the only thing she has like that was a book she received from Peiping (the pre-1949 name for Beijing), along with a photograph with a note on the back. The note was gloomy, talking about a partner turning Judas, and Doris asks if her father died in Peiping. Alan says that Adam Hocksley died there. Then he asks who supplied her with the material she presented, accusing her of being a fraud. She wants to see Carr himself, but Alan says he'd just turn her over to the D.A. because she's missing two critical pieces of evidence. Even Alan doesn't know exactly what they are, and the answer to that is locked up in the nearby safe. Alan says he'll help Doris for half the fortune.

Doris goes to Perry, wanting him to represent her, but he's undecided. He makes an appointment to see Carr, and when he arrives the old man is wheelchair-bound and helped by Gow Loong (Benson Fong). Carr is dictatorial and cynical, pointing out that the $2.2 million is legally his own money to give away or not, as he pleases. He, Hocksley, and John Lowell were partners in gun-running and related activities in China, where they made a fortune, kept in U.S. banks. Lowell was the Judas, turning his partners over to the Communists. Hocksley was killed and Carr was wounded, lucky to escape with the help of Gow Loong, who hates Lowell and is still trying to track him down. Carr thinks Perry could do a better job of the search for Hocksley's daughter and offers him a $10,000 retainer, but Perry refuses since he may represent a Miss Hocksley. Carr asks if he means Miriam Hocksley (Mary Shipp), another claimant whom Adam apparently favors. Perry explains he means Doris Hocksley and gets the address where Miriam is staying in L.A. so he can visit her. Miriam tells Perry that she has no certain knowledge of being the rightful claimant, but if she is, she wants the money. She knows the vital evidence has something to do with books and photographs, so she's having some sent from her home in Palm Beach.

That night, Perry is at home when he gets a call from Della, asking if she can give Rebecca his home number, as she wants to call him directly. Perry permits it, and soon gets a frantic call. She came home, heard a shot from the study, looked in, and saw Carr's body sprawled on the floor with a gun nearby. She heard the noise of someone still in the study, so she locked the door, trapping the person inside. She asks what to do, so Perry tells her to call Lt. Tragg. When the police arrive, they go in guns drawn and find Carr as Rebecca described him, and Doris nearby, holding a book and wearing a blank expression. Carr's pocket watch has written on the inside ""17L-42R-13L-4R"". The dial of Carr's safe is set to 13, and turning it right to 4 unlocks it. To Tragg, this means someone was interrupted opening the safe, presumably by Carr, so the intruder shot him. The only thing inside the safe is an empty tin container. Tragg asks Doris about the bible and photograph of three men that she's holding, but she's in shock. Tragg orders her taken away, first for medical examination, then for booking. Rebecca explains that Alan and Gow Loong had left earlier in the evening, leaving her alone with Carr, who told her to go ahead and see a show to which she had a ticket. When she returned, events transpired as she'd told Perry. Tragg questions why she locked the door when Carr might still have been alive, but she said she was certain at first glance that he was dead. Perry demonstrates that the bible, which has rounded corners, fits perfectly in the empty tin. The photo has square, unbent corners, so was never kept in the tin.

The next day, Paul is back from San Francisco and reports that Doris is a widow and has a six-year-old daughter with polio. Care for the girl is costing her $100 per month although she only nets $48 per week. He heard about, but did not meet, the helpful neighbor. When Perry hears the man's name is Lowell, he recalls the John Lowell who was ""Judas"" to Hocksley and Carr. Perry visits Doris in her hospital room, which has iron bars on the window, and they review what she already told Tragg. Carr had called and invited her over. When she arrived, no one let her in, but the door was open. In the study, she found the dead Carr and the gun, which she picked up, accidentally firing it. Perry asks about Lowell, and Doris says she's known him about four months, ever since he opened the photo shop next door to where she lived. He provided the photo she brought, but has no idea how he could have a copy of the photo that came with the bible. Doris had kept the bible but tossed out the photo years ago.

At trial, Dr. Morton (Bert Holland) of the coroner's office testifies that Carr was shot twice from six to nine feet away. One bullet entered his heart and was instantly fatal, the other was lodged in the spine. Rebecca relates what she previously told Perry and Tragg. On cross-examination, she confirms that the house was unlocked when she returned, and that she only heard one shot. Tragg testifies that tests show the gun that fired the bullets is the one found at the scene, and it has Doris' fingerprints on it. He also identifies the bible, photo, and tin. On cross, he says that three bullets had been fired from the gun, including one that was found in the floor. He calls it a miss, but has to admit that Doris' explanation of accidental firing is a possibility.

Alan and Miriam address each other as ""darling"" as she prepares for testifying that afternoon. Alan warns her not to volunteer anything about what happened the night of Harry Foster's party. She agrees it might give people the wrong idea. On the stand, she testifies about her conversation with Perry, who apparently knew from Doris that the key to the vital evidence was in Carr's safe. (Perry objects to hearsay, but Burger successfully argues the exception to the hearsay rule involving the establishment of the defendant's knowledge facts.) On cross, she says that she did not have a bible with rounded corners or a photo like Doris' as part of her evidence supporting her claim. Perry reads a note that Paul brings him, then asks Miriam where she was on the night of the murder. (Burger objects, as this is utterly unrelated to direct examination, but Perry successfully uses the cross-examiner's catchall of attempting to show bias of the witness.) Miriam answers that she was at a party in Beverly Hills, hosted by people named Foster.

On Burger's direct examination, Alan recounts the innocent part of his encounter with Doris. On cross, he denies the part about offering to help Doris for half the money. However, he admits to also being at the Foster party, that he and Miriam were away from the party from about 11 to 1, and that he and Miriam used that time to wed, having obtained a marriage license a week earlier. Perry now declares that the key to everything is the empty tin, so he rips it open. Inside a hidden panel is another copy of the photo of three men, this one trimmed to fit. The bible that also fit and the photo that matched were the objects that were to identify Adam Hocksley's daughter, so it really is Doris.

Late that night, Perry is home when he gets a phone call: ""It's Miriam. I killed Alan because he was no good. He killed his uncle. Now Doris can go free. I'm going to kill myself."" There's the sound of a gunshot. Perry calls the police and rushes to Miriam's apartment. Medics are carrying her away and Tragg says she has a 40/60 chance of pulling through, but Alan is dead. Perry says that Miriam was completely honest through the whole case. She didn't care all that much about the money, but loved Alan and didn't kill him. This surprises Tragg, in view of her confession, but Perry says the detective is jumping to conclusions. He points to a bullet in the wall, which couldn't have been from a shot fired from where someone shooting at Alan would stand. Perry, Tragg, and Burger go to Carr's house and announce Alan's death to Rebecca and Gow Loong. Rebecca acts shocked, but Perry says she made two mistakes. One is that Miriam is alive, which Burger confirms. Now Rebecca is really frantic. She'd loved Alan, who said he loved her too, but was lying, so she killed him. As Tragg takes her away, Perry and Burger agree that they both need a drink.

Later, Perry says that Rebecca's big blunder was calling him at home. None of the other people connected with the case, including Miriam, had his home phone number, so Perry knew the call was a fake. The bullet hole in the wall was made by Rebecca to produce the required gunshot sound. Rebecca had also been the one caught opening the safe, out of her misplaced love for Alan, when she was found by Carr and shot him. She was in the process of arranging a cover-up when Doris blundered on the scene and made it easy. From all this, Paul draws the moral ""What some women will do for a man is just plain murder."" Della and Perry are quite unimpressed."

She's pleased with his helpfulness, but her husband Scott (Tom Palmer), observing from the bushes, is clearly not. He storms back into the house, loads both barrels of shotgun (avoiding getting his prints on the shells), and puts it in his golf bag. He drives to a remote location, fires it once, then returns it to his gun rack. Marion enters the room and shrugs off his remark about what she does with the help. He gets a call from his Ellen Waring (Barbara Lawrence), his partner in the real estate business. She was expected to come to the Shelby's that evening, but says she and her friend Arthur Williams (Jonathan Hole) can't make it. Shelby is disappointed, but says he'll call her tomorrow.

Perry and Della are working late again when a telegram arrives: ""Need help desperately. Expect to be arrested any moment. Contact me in care of Shelby, Pinewood Lake. Frank Lawton."" During World War II, Perry and Frank served in the same company (implying Perry was in the Army, contradicting other episodes that had him in the Navy). Frank was shot twice in the war, after which his wife was killed in an accident, and he's seemed to be jinxed ever since.

Meanwhile, Shelby, in his pajamas, takes wire cutters and a flashlight from his car and walks down to the dock, which has a phone. He calls Frank, who lives in a bungalow on the property, and says ""This is Shelby. I'm at the dock. Bring my shotgun. Hurry!"" He disconnects the phone's handset with the wire cutters, which he then throws in the lake. Frank hastily gets dressed, grabs a set of keys, and runs to the main house. As he unlocks the door, he hears ""No! Don't! No!"" followed by a gunshot. He grabs the shotgun and runs to the dock, where he finds the flashlight but no Shelby and no response to his repeated calls. Marion arrives, asks Frank ""Where's my husband?"", and breaks into sobs.

The next day, Detective Sgt. Dix (Claude Akins) questions Frank's account, and shows him that the phone from which he said Shelby called was disconnected. Perry and Della arrive to find that the police are searching for Shelby's body, presumably in the lake. Dix notes that the shotgun Frank had was fired very recently. Frank is surprised to see Perry and denies sending the telegram. Dix gives the suspect a few minutes with his attorney. When Perry asks if there was a romance between Shelby and Ellen, Frank admits he can't be sure. Ellen often visited, sometimes alone but often with Arthur, and occasionally Arthur came alone. He's an accountant who had done work for the partnership, and also is quite the camera bug. Frank says that Shelby's appearance of wealth was just a front, used to impress people so he could con them out of their money. Frank says he could have been in love with Marion with some encouragement, but she never gave him any. Dix returns, having found Frank's notebook, and quotes a passage in which Frank wonders why someone like Shelby is permitted to remain alive.

Later, Perry tells Paul that he suspects Shelby is alive. He was being hounded by creditors, so he could have engineered his disappearance to elude them. Paul says he couldn't have just rowed away, since no boats were missing from the dock. Perry thinks Shelby could have had a confederate, perhaps Ellen, waiting in a boat for him. They go to Ellen's apartment building and look in the garage for her unit. The passenger seat of her car is soaking wet, as are a blanket and men's shoes they also find there.They call Sgt. Dix, and when he arrives Paul mentions that as they waited outside he spotted a man through the window of Ellen's apartment. Ellen lets them in and lets them look into the bedroom, where a woman is sleeping. Ellen says it's her mother. The man Paul saw was Arthur, who lives in another unit in the building and had dropped by for coffee. Arthur comes to the door and needs to be told what's going on, as he hadn't heard about Shelby. Asked about the wet things in her garage, Ellen explains that she and Arthur went on a lakeside picnic the previous day, to celebrate their upcoming wedding. Arthur tried to do some fishing, but slipped and fell in the lake. Sgt. Dix calls his headquarters, and learns that Shelby's body has been found in the lake, his head blasted with a shotgun.

In court, D.A. Howard Black (Peter Hansen) has Dix identify Frank's notebook and the shotgun. On cross-examination, Perry makes him admit that he couldn't swear that this shotgun was the murder weapon. Marion testifies that, half asleep, she heard loud voices, then a gunshot. Now fully awake, she went to the dock and found Frank calling out for Shelby, holding the shotgun. On cross, she says her marriage lacked affection, because of her husbands flagrant affair with Ellen. On her turn on the stand, Ellen, now Mrs. Williams, denies this accusation. She describes the picnic and mentions that Arthur took photographs, which he hands over to Black and Perry. The D.A. intends to call Arthur so he can introduce the photos into evidence, but first there's a recess. Paul and Perry use the time to visit the site of Ellen and Arthur's picnic.

When the trial resumes, Arthur identifies the photos and produces a receipt from the camera shop where he took the film to be developed. It's dated 10 AM the day after the murder, and Arthur explains that the shop was closed by the time they returned from the picnic and opened at 10 the next day. On cross, Perry questions him about what he found in the course of his accounting duties, and he admits that there was a ""slight"" discrepancy of about $120,000 in Shelby's books. Perry introduces a bank statement that shows Shelby withdrew $121,700 the day before his murder. He also shows Arthur a receipt that he and Paul got from the same camera shop, and there's no time shown on it. Arthur admits that he specifically asked for the time to be included. He says that he took the picnic photos between 2 and 5:30 the afternoon before the murder, but Perry shows that the shadows point west, implying the photos were taken in the morning. With his fake alibi exposed, Arthur admits that Shelby had hired him to help him vanish. However, Marion paid him more to double-cross him, but he just stood by while she shot him. She screams a denial, but Arthur says that to protect himself, he brought along his camera, loaded with infrared film. Ellen hands over a photo of Marion kneeling over Shelby's corpse on the dock. Marion collapses.

Later, Perry is with Frank, as he packs to move out of the bungalow and ponders his own ability to misjudge women. Perry says that Marion never particularly wanted to frame Frank. That was Shelby's plan, and Marion merely took advantage of the opportunity it created. Sgt. Dix enters and says that the missing money and murder gun were found under a plank in the dock. Frank also gets his notebook back, but he tears out the pages and says that in the future he'll leave all the writing to guys like Hemingway. He won't even write telegrams, and if he ever needs Perry's help again, he'll send smoke signals."

Gary's the foreman at Bannister Farms, and needs to leave soon to give the bosses wife, Lisa Bannister (Osa Massen), a ride. He's approached by Stefan Riker (Werner Klemperer, famous as ), who shows him the photograph of a woman. Gary claims he doesn't recognize her, but later, in the car, we see that it's Lisa. He tells her how he has protected her and claims his rewarded by forcibly kissing her, which earns him a slap.

At home, Edward Bannister (Robert F. Simon), who needs to use two canes to walk, complains about his wife having another of her headaches, but his daughter (and Lisa's stepdaughter) Doris (Gigi Perreau) is quick to defend her. Riker appears at the door and says he's Lisa's cousin. He tells Edward he recently arrived from East Germany. When Lisa enters, Riker acts like a happily reunited relative, but Lisa is clearly stunned and distressed. Edward says this is because she'd told him she had no living relatives. Later, Doris stops Lisa from taking an overdose of pills. The stepmother reveals that Riker is a friend of her father, who isn't dead but is in fact Hans Gebhardt, the real head of the Communist Party in East Germany. (For the purposes of this story, we need to assume that the notorious was a figurehead.) Riker may know that Lisa entered the U.S. on a forged passport. Doris promises to find a way to deal with the problem. Doris goes to Riker's apartment and throws herself at him. Three months after his arrival, Riker has clearly prospered, with a nice new car and spiffy clothes. Edward tells him he better leave town, but the German doesn't care.

Della returns to the law office to find a disheveled Doris, who says she can't remember her name. She found a torn piece of paper with Perry's name and office address on it, and thought that he might know who she was. Perry arrives and doesn't recognize her. She manages to say that she might have been on Sunset Canyon Road when she awoke from whatever happened to her, then she collapses. Perry takes her to the hospital. The following afternoon, the late-rising Edward sees the morning paper, with a photo of Doris and the headline ""Amnesia Victim Found by Prominent Attorney"". He calls Perry and asks for his help in getting her home. When Perry asks about Sunset Canyon Road, Edward says he thinks Riker, whom Doris had been seeing, lives around there. Della looks up Riker in the phone book, as Perry wonders why Riker hadn't called to identify Doris.

That question is immediately answered for the viewer, as we see Riker's dead body sprawled on the floor of his apartment. Lt. Tragg and his men are there, and find a stack of letters from Doris, full of declarations of love and jealousy. Outside they find a gun and a stepladder hear the rear window of Riker's apartment. Directly under the window are two indentations in the ground, as if the ladder had been placed there so someone could look in the window, then moved to the side. Perry and Della, observing the homicide detectives going back and forth, don't go to the apartment. Instead, Perry goes to the hospital, where Dr. Forbes (Wendell Holmes) gives a diagnosis of ""general amnesia"". Perry starts to make arrangements to move Doris to a private sanitarium, when Tragg arrives and posts a police guard.

Paul has little to report. The police obviously think that Riker was two-timing Doris, so she killed him out of jealousy. Perry goes to Hennessy's and talks to Gary, who's sympathetic but unhelpful. After he leaves, Helene mentions that Gary, who denied knowing Riker, had actually met him frequently at the lounge. Paul summons Perry to a gully off Sunset Canyon Road, where he's found Doris' wrecked car. It's in neutral gear, so could have been pushed. In the car is the paper from which the scrap with Perry's address was torn, so she presumably wrote it herself. Perry and Paul don't need to worry about what to do with all these indications that Doris faked her accident, as Tragg immediately arrives, having spotted Perry's car parked along the road above.

In court, Dr. Forbes testifies that he now believes Doris was faking amnesia, because her physical condition and behavioral symptoms don't match general amnesia. On cross-examination, Perry gets him to admit she could have had partial amnesia, and it was the doctor, not the patient, who claimed it was general amnesia. Tragg takes the stand and identifies the ladder, which has Doris' fingerprints, and a plaster cast of the ground beneath Riker's window. Burger demonstrates that the spacing between the indentations in the cast matches that of the rear legs of the ladder, although the shape of the indentations is just a good fit, not an exact one. The lieutenant explains that when there was weight on the ladder, the legs would have wiggled around, thus changing the shape of the imprints. Burger next calls Lisa as a hostile witness and forces her to identify Doris' handwriting on a note from Riker's apartment. It says, ""I saw you with her again. It's times like this I get so mad I could kill you."" On cross, she testifies that she hated Riker, but Perry accuses her of being the ""her"" in the note and of lying.

During a recess, Perry tells Doris that, despite his attempts, no one in court is going to believe her amnesia story. She finally drops that lie, telling him that she did use the ladder to spy on Riker, saw him with that woman again (no one she knew), waited for her to leave, then went in and shot him. Perry accuses her of trying to protect Lisa. She admits that she found Riker dead, and in his hand was a medallion she often wore suspended from a gold string necklace, a gift from Edward. Doris took it from the dead hand and threw it away, assuming that Lisa was the killer. They both hated Riker, Doris' protestations of love and jealousy just being an act, attempting to frighten Riker away from Lisa. She won't tell Perry what Riker had on Lisa, and if Perry tries to use the admissions she just made to him in court, she'll deny everything.

Perry calls Edward and asks him to bring Lisa's medallion or a copy to Paul in a lot near the court the next day. However, on that day he arrives and tells Paul that he couldn't get a copy that fast. When the trial resumes, Burger has Edward on the stand and uses registration data to show that the murder gun was his. It was kept in Gary's desk in the tack room, and Edward admits that Doris knew this. On cross, Perry has Edward describe the medallion, then claims that it had been in the hand of his corpse. This starts a row among Perry, Burger, and Doris, which requires some sternness from the judge (Pierre Watkin) to put down. Perry then asks Edward if he had any idea where the medallion went after it left his home. Burger objects to this as calling for hearsay, but Perry counters that it's best evidence, since Edward himself put the medallion in Riker's dead hand. Wrongly thinking the German was having an affair with Lisa, Edward murdered him and tried to frame her. Edward tries to deny it, but Perry shows that the ground impressions from below Riker's window perfectly match his two canes, down to the irregularity caused by a tack in one of the canes.

Later, Perry explains to Della what started him to suspect Edward. If Riker had actually ripped Lisa's medallion off her, it would be impossible for her to fail to notice that, and therefore wouldn't have left it. The most logical other person to have access to the medallion, when Lisa wasn't wearing it, was Edward. Della, curious about what hold Riker had on Lisa, starts to speculate about when Lisa entered the country. Perry stops her, saying that since Doris was willing to go to the gas chamber to protect Lisa's secret, they shouldn't pry. Della agrees, saying that every woman is entitled to at least one secret. ""What's yours?"" he asks, getting the reply ""You'll never know."""

Wynant), president of Cal-Texas Explorations returns to his office to find his secretary out but Rose Calvert (Pamela Duncan),an employee who doesn't belong there, snooping around his desk. He immediately suspects that she's working for former Cal-Texas executive Warner Griffith (Johnny Mack Brown). She denies this, but we soon see her calling Warner, informing him that she has possession of confidential reports. Working late, Dan can't find documents relating to a Texas project, and is certain Rose took them. Amelia Armitage (Jacqueline Scott) barges in, introduces herself, and says she knows all about Warner's plan to take the company away from him through a proxy fight. She believes he would bleed the company, thus hurting the stockholders. After she leaves, Dan gets a call from an unidentified woman. She has a list of the proxies Warner has obtained, but because Dan is being followed and his phone may be tapped, insists on an elaborate plan. Dan is to go to a phone booth at a nearby drug store. The phone will ring at 8:15 and he'll get further directions.

Dan proceeds as instructed, and the phone does indeed ring at about 8:13. He's told to go to Room 709 of the Hotel Redfern. This being 1958, the hotel actually has a human elevator operator, Mavis Jordan (Natalie Norwick). She's absorbed in a book, so doesn't look up when Dan asks for the 7th floor. There's no answer at Room 709, but the door is open so he goes inside, finding Rose lying dead on the floor. He takes the gun lying near her body and wipes his prints off surfaces he touched. He takes the stairs to the 6th floor and summons the elevator from there. Mavis, still not looking up, comments that he walked down from 7. As he exits the elevator, he brushes past Lt. Tragg, who's headed in the opposite direction.

Later, Dan and Cal-Texas attorney Varnell (Donald Foster) explain the situation to Perry. They show him the gun, which Perry says he'll have Paul send to the police, as it's evidence. Dan says he thinks he now knows who called him - Linda Griffith (Marie Windsor), Warner's wife. Perry tells Dan that he should stay out of circulation, but not by fleeing town or hiding under an assumed name. He should drive his own car to a nondescript motel and register under his own name. Perry visits Linda and asks why she lured Dan into a trap. She admits making the first phone call, but when she called at 8:15 to have Dan meet her, he didn't answer. When Perry describes the second call Dan did get, she realizes that she was right - Dan's phone was tapped, and whoever tapped it set up the fake second call. She was quite sincere about helping Dan with the proxy fight, as she's planning on divorcing Warner. She's convinced he's having an affair with Rose, who's helping him obtain proxies. Hearing there's been a murder, she's too nervous to hand Dan the proxy information now, but she does give Perry a photo of Rose that she discovered her husband had taken. She mentions that Rose is married but separated. She also knows that Rose had been using Room 709 at the Redfern for the work she was doing for Warner, but actually lived at the Serrano Arms.

Perry finds a letter stuck partway into Rose's mailbox at the Serrano, and sees on it the return address of Fred Calvert (Jack Weston) in Ellendale, about an hour's drive from L.A. Perry goes there, and Fred says that Rose left her about 7 months ago. She wanted more fun than she could have with Fred, but he thinks she'll eventually return to him and the security provided by their house, which is completely free of mortgage. Perry shows him the photo, which Fred identifies as Rose, and tells him that she may have been murdered. When Perry gets back to the office, Warner is there. Perry voices suspicions that after Rose delivered her material against Dan, and Linda started accusing him of an affair with her, Rose turned from asset to liability, giving him a motive for murder. Unfortunately, the murder took place between 7:30 and 8:30 PM, and Warner didn't get back from a day in Phoenix until around 1 AM.

Perry enters Burger's office, in response to an ""invitation"" delivered by Tragg. The D.A. says that the gun he sent was indeed the murder weapon, and then goes into one of his typical tirades about Perry's shady behavior. However, this time Burger and Tragg have duplicated his reasoning about avoiding flight or hiding. Tragg opens a side door, and beckons Dan into the room. As Dan's trial nears, Amelia comes to Perry with a story of having eavesdropped on the phone call Dan received after she had supposedly left, and then having followed him to the drug store, where she heard the pay phone ring. This would prove that Dan was telling the truth about those calls, but Perry immediately realizes she made the whole thing up out of information that had been made public. He tells her that help like that could get his client the gas chamber.

In court, Fred testifies to coming to the morgue the day after the murder and identifying Rose's remains. Tragg testifies that he went to Room 709 based on an anonymous tip. He found a set of Dan's prints on a chair. Mavis testifies that she saw Dan in her elevator, despite being absorbed in the book ""You'll Die Laughing"". She remembers him in particular, because he went to 7 and came back from 6. On cross, Perry questions how she could recognize anyone if she was looking down at her book. She reveals that she's an expert at identifying people by looking at their feet. She mentions tests at Stanford at which her ability was declared ""phenomenal - a quirk of nature"" and is ready to cite other academic references when she's excused.

Warner describes his spying with Rose's help as an investigation of Dan - attempting to show that he was releasing valuable information to competitors. He claims that Dan learned that she kept her documentation in Room 709 and says ""She could have ruined him. That's why he killer her!"" On cross, Perry forces him to admit that the ""release of information to competitors"" really just consisted of partnering with a group of smaller companies to make land purchases for Cal-Texas, to avoid the spurt in prices that would have resulted from one big offer. This was a perfectly natural business practice, which Warner as a candidate to take over the company ought to know. In fact, Rose's ""evidence"" was merely a cheap trick, and not a motive for her murder. Warner admits he knew that Rose had taken a company-owned gun from the Cal-Texas offices. However, he denies having chartered a private plane to take him to L.A. and back to Phoenix in order to commit the crime while apparently out of state. He says that he really did return around 1 AM and went to her residence at the Serrano Arms, but no one was there. He denies having taken the letter from Fred that Perry had seen but is now missing.

Back on the stand, Perry questions Fred about the time gap between when he learned his wife might have been murdered around midnight and his visit to LAPD the following morning. Fred finally admits that he had driven to the Serrano Arms to retrieve the letter then back to Ellendale, so he could tell the local sheriff about his wife's possible murder and have him accompany Fred on his trip to the L.A. police. He wanted the letter back because in it he'd given Rose the deed to his house in an attempt to win her back. If she was dead, he didn't want her relatives getting the house. He insists he had no motive to kill her, as he just wanted her back. Perry badgers him with accusations that he went to Room 709, pleaded with her, and when she kept rejecting him, killed her in the heat of the moment or accidentally. Fred keeps saying ""No"" to all this, so Perry has him stand up so Mavis can identify his feet. Before she can say anything, Fred admits that everything happened exactly as Perry had said.

Perry and Della are out celebrating with Dan, and they reveal to him that Mavis couldn't have actually identified Fred, because he was wearing different shoes in court than on the murder night. Amelia drops by, and Dan belatedly recognizes her name as belonging to the family that controls 37% of Cal-Texas stock. Given her obvious sympathy for Dan, the proxy fight is a dead issue. Perry and Della leave Dan and Amelia. Looking back at them, Della remarks that Dan is a good age match for Amelia. Perry asks what she has in mind. She answers that with them both caring so much about Cal-Texas, it would be a good time for a merger."

Fred tells her she can pick up the money at 5 PM tomorrow, at the apartment, and says there's now nothing between them. ""Nothing but money,"" says Kim. Later that night, Inez Kaylor (Karen Sharpe), finds her drunk roommate and fellow hostess Kim contemplating future prosperity. Inez calls being a hostess ""The best way I know to get a massage to music,"" but she does enjoy the occasional overseas modeling assignments that come with the job. Kim says that's part of the operation, and that when Inez figures out what she's talking about, she'll have security. The next day, Danceland boss Martha Rayburn (June Vincent) asks Inez why she's trying to see Fred, who's just the club's landlord. Inez replies that Kim is missing, and Fred might know about it, as they had been dating. Martha responds that Fred is a happily married man. Inez repeats some of Kim's disconnected comments from the night before, and Martha tells her to forget about it and get back to work. Just as she exits Martha's office, Fred enters it. Inez lingers near the closed door long enough to hear him tell Martha that while he was stopped at a red light, someone came up and robbed him at gunpoint.

The following morning, the police come to Albert's trailer, roust him out of bed, and arrest for robbing Archer. Perry comes to him in jail and says he'll defend him pro bono, as he's aware of Albert's problems. Eight years earlier, Albert was driving 36 hours straight to be on time for a new job. He fell asleep at the wheel, and his wife and two children were killed in the resulting accident. When Perry meets Fred and Martha, he asks why they didn't report the robbery, which was in fact reported by a chance witness. Martha lies, claiming that she wasn't feeling well at Danceland and Fred agreed to drive her home. When the robbery occurred, she wasn't up to dealing with the police, so convinced Fred to forget about it and take her home.

Perry and Paul don't have much success getting more information from Danceland employees. However, Paul mentions that Larry the bouncer heard from Inez that she'd been fired by Martha, in the club, at a time after the robbery. Inez has moved to Las Vegas, so Paul dispatches his man Ralph Faulkner (Gil Frye) to find her. Later, in a hallway of the court building, Ralph brings Inez to Paul and leaves. She's quite willing to help catch Martha in a lie. Paul goes into the courtroom to tell Perry, and the second he's out of sight a tough customer who later turns out to be Joe Gibbs (Ned Wever) approaches Inez. In court, Martha has just testified for A.D.A. Walsh (John Alvin) that she recognizes Albert as the robber. On cross-examination Perry sets up the confrontation with Inez, but when Paul goes back to retrieve her, she's vanished. Perry gets a recess until the following Monday.

Lt. Tragg drops by Perry's office and announces that Kim's body has been found, and a search under Albert's trailer uncovered her purse and jewelry. Now that it's a murder case, Burger will be prosecuting personally. Paul finds Inez, but now she's completely unwilling to cooperate, so Paul serves her with a subpoena. She fakes taking an overdose of sleeping pills to distract him, then goes through a window, down a fire escape, and drives off. Perry wants to look around Inez's apartment, and to make this legal he buys up a contract under which Kim had made a time purchase of a mink, which Inez now has. She took it out of state, which triggers the right of the seller (or his assignee, Perry) to enter her premises to repossess the merchandise.

Perry and Della go to the Vegas apartment, but Inez isn't there. They are let in by Mr. Wickett (George Cisar), who, after being sufficiently tipped, leaves them alone. They find a postcard from the Universal Modeling Agency, telling Kim to report for a new job on the 20th of the month. As Della is checking out the bathroom, Joe enters with his key, draws a gun, and takes the postcard. Della gets a look at him, but is herself unseen. Back in L.A., Della applies for a job at UMA and is told by Marge (Robin Raymond), the company secretary, to wait for the boss. Christine (Jacqueline Holt), a model, enters and reports her return from abroad. After Christine leaves and Marge briefly steps out, Della gets a quick chance to snoop through UMA's contact information. She manages to look innocent when the door to the boss's office opens and out steps Joe. He's favorably impressed by her potential as a model, until she says she's married. Pointing out that the UMA ad said ""unattached models only,"" Joe shows her the door.

In court, Della tells Perry that the UMA records she saw listed the Danceland Ballroom as the phone number for most of the models. She also identifies Joe as the man who pulled a gun on Perry in Las Vegas. She notices that Martha's purse is just like one that Christine had when she was at UMA. Perry says that he's seen one like it too. He resumes his cross-examination of Martha, and she testifies that she doesn't believe in handing out gifts or bonuses to her hostesses. Asked about her purse, she says that it was design for her and has to be specially ordered. Perry points out that the purse that the police found matched it exactly, so Martha has to contradict herself and say that she gave such a purse to Kim. In Perry's office, Paul brings in Kim's purse, but he'll need to get it back to his police contact in an hour. Perry finds a secret compartment behind a mirror built into the purse. It contains traces of white powder, which Perry tastes. He notices the manufacturer's tag, and tells Della to go shopping.

In court, Perry shows Martha a bag and asks ""What if I told you it belonged to Kim Lane?"" Burger is furious, but the judge (Fay Roope) lets Perry continue. He makes Martha open the compartment behind the mirror and observe traces of white powder. Perry says it has the taste of heroin, and recommends that the D.A. investigate her and Fred for drug smuggling.Perry tells Martha that he can subpoena UMA records and the purses of all the models. He warns her that by sticking to her story regarding the robbery, she can increase her risk from years in prison as a drug smuggler to the gas chamber as an accomplice to murder. She admits that she was lying to help Fred, because the witness who reported the crime had seen a woman in the car. He failed to notice that the woman was dead - it was Kim, but Fred didn't kill her. He paid blackmail to her at the apartment used for their trysts, then told her to clear out. As she was packing, he went out for cigarettes, and returned to find her dead. He decided to drive off with her body and dump it.

Joe's testimony about the smuggling operations is rather matter-of-fact. The secret compartments of the purses were loaded and unloaded while the models were being photographed, so they were unaware of the smuggling. Perry says that a model who did figure it out would be in a great position to demand blackmail. Joe insists that none ever did, not even Kim. After all, she got her $5,000 from Fred to keep her from revealing their amour to his family. Perry has the court stenographer (Charles Zacha Jr.) read back the relevant part of Martha's testimony, and there was no mention of an exact amount of money. The only reason Joe knew it was because he killed Kim for it. The judge dismisses the case, and Perry shows Burger that he hadn't stolen state's evidence (and he doesn't mention ""borrowing"" it) - he was bluffing Martha with a copy bag that Della had obtained, containing not heroin but flour.

In Perry's office, Della wonders who was the actual robber, and Perry says he'll turn up sooner or later. The fact that the robber threw Fred's wallet in the same general area as Joe threw Kim's purse and jewelry was just a coincidence. Paul enters, announcing that a job at a record shop is all arranged for Albert. It should be good for him, as he likes listening to music. The police have found Inez and she's OK. She wants to go to business school, so Paul is taking her out so he can recommend a good one. He claims he used to be a teacher at one of the best. Perry says he was the track coach - any gal he couldn't catch in three laps around the desk is ready for the business world. (This is a reference to an old cliché, mainly seen in cartoons drawn before the 1970s, about a lecherous boss chasing his secretary around and around his desk.)"

They find the door to the office bolted, but are finally let in by an intruder, gossip columnist Mary K. Davis (Marian Seldes). They realize she has stolen a book of patient records from the office, but before they can do anything about it, Mary pulls a gun on them. She says the only way they'll get the book back is if they give Mary a baby. She's told everyone, including her husband, that she's pregnant. Mary gives Barnes and Walsh until 10 AM to accept her terms.

Back in her own office, Mary prepares the story, based on the patient records, that she'll publish if she doesn't get her baby. Mary's assistant Connie Cooper (Ruta Lee) is shocked, but Mary puts her in her place by threatening to make public the terrible secret of who is the real mother of Connie's fiancé, Bob Shroeder (Don Garner). Mary reveals that she's adamant about her plan because her supposed pregnancy is her only way of prying her husband Ralph (Philip Ober) away from his girlfriend. Dr. Barnes calls, and Mary gives him another 24 hours.

Later, Laura Walsh visits Perry's office and asks him to recover the record book. She admits that she and Dr. Barnes have been arranging off-the-books adoptions of the children of single mothers, not for money but to provide good homes for the children. Perry explains that he can't simply steal the book back from Mary, so Laura leaves in frustration. Perry tries to call Mary Davis, but Lt. Tragg answers. Mary has been murdered. Later on, Tragg and D.A. Burger are discussing the case in the latter's office when Laura enters and confesses to the killing.

Perry is frustrated with his client's actions, but nevertheless pursues every avenue of investigation that he can. This includes talking to Connie and Bob, but they aren't much help. Connie blames herself for much of what has happened, as she had naively confided what she knew about Barnes' operation to Mary. The ever-trusty Paul Drake is more helpful. He has pored through trash to recover an envelope that Mary had addressed to herself under her maiden name at another address. It seems she ruined the envelope and had to do a new one, discarding the one Paul found. Perry learns that the address is of an apartment that Mary had recently rented, obviously as a place she could mail the record book for safekeeping.

Perry guesses that the book hasn't been delivered yet, so he sends Della to rent the apartment (as Mary has failed to pay the latest weekly rent). When the mail carrier arrives, Della follows Perry's instructions to avoid identifying herself as Mary, then tries to hide the package within the apartment. (Perry doesn't want it found, but doesn't want to involve Della in interfering with the mails either.) However, a noise a bit like pottery being broken interrupts her, and she hides behind a door from an intruder. We only see the shadow of an arm holding a gun, which is then withdrawn. Della runs out the door, taking the package with her in her panic. Back at Perry's office, she's afraid her actions will get her sent to jail.

Mary's lawyer, Arthur Jarech (Berry Kroeger), has duplicated some of Perry's reasoning and comes to offer Perry the opportunity to share the blackmail possibilities created by the record book. Perry rejects the offer with scorn, and Jarech says he'll go to the D.A. Perry takes the record book to Dr. Barnes, and pointedly leaves him alone with it while he gets a drink of water. Barnes takes the hint, and burns the book.

In court, it's clear that Jarech went through with his threat, as Burger puts Della on the stand and begins to question her about the intercepted package. However, Perry stops every one of Burger's questions with a laundry list of objections, including the old standbys, ""assuming facts not in evidence"" and ""incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial"". The judge (Morris Ankrum), commenting that these ""mere technicalities"" exist to protect the constitutional rights of the accused, sustains every one of the objections. Burger will be forced to produce the proper chain of evidence through a laborious process, so he asks for an adjournment.

Back at the office, Della is still fretting about what happened at Mary's apartment. She mentions the something-breaking sound that alerted her to an intruder, and Perry has a brainstorm. He and Paul go back to the apartment building, where the manager shows him the junk he had removed from Mary's room when she missed a rental payment. It includes a number of broken dictaphone cylinders and a dictaphone machine. The broken cylinders aren't of much use, so Perry hires an actress (who seems a little too attractive for Della's taste) to record a new cylinder, copying Mary's voice. She has barely left when Tragg comes in and seizes the dictaphone, broken cylinders, and new fake one, as stolen evidence. It turns out that there was an anonymous tip that Perry had a recording that would solve the case.

In court, Burger presents these items as evidence, despite Perry's assurance that they are incompetent, etc. As he starts to play the one intact cylinder, Connie jumps up and screams that they have to stop it. She admits she killed Mary, but they must not play that cylinder. She tells Bob that she didn't want his mother's secret revealed, and ended up killing Mary in a struggle. Bob says they could have lived with it. Ralph Davis and Perry also express their sorrow over Connie's unfortunate actions.

In the wrap-up, we learn that Bob's mother was a murderess who gave birth while on the run from the law. Tragg enters and mentions that Burger is planning on charging her with 2nd degree murder, since there was a struggle. He also says that Burger realizes the source of the ""anonymous tip"" and would like to charge Perry with something. However, Tragg pointed out to the D.A. that Perry had correctly told him the cylinder wasn't proper evidence. The lieutenant reveals the formerly intact cylinder now in pieces to show how mad Burger got. However, says, Tragg, the D.A. shouldn't get mad: ""He missed me by nearly two feet!"""

He fears his wife Louise (Susan Dorn) has found Charlotte's letters to him, and she might even be listening in on another phone. He's right, and Louise confronts him about the affair, trying to slap him. They struggle, and she tumbles down the stairs. A month after getting out of the hospital, she's crippled and won't leave her bedroom. George pleads with Louise's cousin and companion Vicky Braxton (Mary LaRoche) to ask Louise to see him. As Louise leaves, he's stunned to see the new maid - it's Charlotte, working under the name Martha Baxter. He thinks it's too risky for her to be there, but soon they're kissing.

Vicky passes on George's request, but Louise is adamant that she'll see no one but Vicky and Nora Mae Quincey (Lenore Shanewise), the practical nurse. Louise thinks George tried to kill her, and she also suspects him of taking some of her jewelry to give to his girlfriend. Due to her religious beliefs, she can't divorce George, but she can cut him out of her will, leaving everything to the Wayne Medical Foundation. She reassures Vicky that she won't change the $350 monthly stipend left to her in the existing will.

George peeks into Nora Mae's room and sees her playing a bizarre amalgam of chess and checkers, her ""opponent"" being an empty chair. She also responds to the imaginary companion's admiration for the jewelry she's wearing. Having seen enough, George closes the door and knocks. Before answering the door, Nora Mae puts away her chess set and hides the rings and bracelet with it. George tells her he talked to a doctor who gave him some new pills to help Louise. She tells him the only thing she ever gives Louise is a tonic Dr. Williams (Charles Lane) in some milk and honey. George gives her the pills anyway.

When Perry arrives at his office, Nora Mae is waiting for him. She reported her suspicions that George's pills are poisoned to the police, but they were too busy to help. Perry takes one pill to have analyzed and Nora Mae negotiates a $5 consulting fee. Once she leaves, Della remarks that the jewelry Nora Mae was wearing made her fingers look practically on fire. Perry agrees that they looked expensive, and says there's more to Nora Mae than meets the eye. When Nora gets home, George confronts her about the jewelry and insists that she give Louise those pills. Later, George is again spying on her as she puts the pills into the milk and takes it into Louise's room.

Vicky is in bed when she gets called over the intercom by a distressed Louise. She calls in Dr. Williams, who begins to treat her but soon declares that it's too late. Soon, Homicide is combing over the place, and with George's help have found Nora Mae's chess set, with hidden jewelry. Lt. Tragg confronts her about it, and she says that she couldn't resist borrowing (albeit without asking) what she was sure was just inexpensive costume jewelry. Tragg estimates its value at around $25,000 (a figure Burger would raise to $40,000).

In Perry's office, Paul reports that the pill Perry gave him was just a sedative. Louise was killed by arsenic in the milk. George's first wife, Grace Gordon, died of a heart attack induced by food poisoning. She left George $53,000, which he lost in a business venture. Since his second marriage, he's living on handouts from Louise. In jail, Nora Mae explains that she put the pills in the milk, took it into Louise's room, waited for George to leave, went to the kitchen, poured that milk down the sink and replaced with with a new milk/honey/tonic concoction. She tells Perry to try not to worry.

In court, Dr. Williams testifies about testing the milk for arsenic. He also mentions that while Grace's tumble down stairs left her crippled, it did not reduce her life expectancy. In cross-examination, he notes that the honey in the milk would have masked the sweet taste of arsenic. Tragg discusses the thorough search he made of the home. He identifies a bottle of poison found in the kitchen and says that Nora Mae's fingerprints were on it. Under cross-examination, he admits that the poison was next to various household cleaners that Nora Mae would have naturally handled when performing her duty of keeping Louise's room clean.

George testifies that he wanted Louise to take a sedative so he could search her room for the letters. After he saw Nora Mae take the drugged milk into Louise's room, he checked several times, but she was always awake. He also says that Nora Mae was eager to put the pills in the milk. On cross, he claims not to know a Charlotte and that the letters were from a Mary Smith who moved to Texas a couple of months ago. Perry brings up George's first wife, and gets him to admit that Louise left an estate of around a million dollars. Perry requests an autopsy of Grace Gordon, but Burger's next witness, Dr. Meecham (Charles Davis), testifies that this has already occurred. No arsenic was found. It was impossible to check for cyanide, because the body had been embalmed before the autopsy. (Formaldehyde in embalming fluid destroys cyanide.)

During a recess, following a request from Perry, Vicky produces the missing letters, including Charlotte's signed photo, saying she found them taped to the back of the mirror in Louise's room. They recognize Charlotte as Martha the maid. Vicky explains that while Louise would have of course seen the photo, she never had the opportunity to recognize ""Martha"" because only Vicky and Nora Mae were allowed to enter Louise's room. Back in court, she repeats all this on the stand, and admits she was careless in not checking out the phony maid's references, because the household was desperate for help. Perry counters that she had the letters all along and hired Charlotte intentionally, to involve George. She wanted to frame him, because if convicted he'd be barred from inheriting and the money (under Louise's earlier will, still in effect) would go to Vicky as nearest living relative. She confesses, saying that Louise constantly wore her wealth like a badge and treated Vicky as nothing but a poor relative.

Later, Perry explains to Della and Nora Mae that he knew Vicky had the letters all along. The claim of finding them behind the mirror had to be a lie, because if Tragg says he's done a thorough search, you know it was extremely thorough. Nora Mae again negotiates her fee and pays Perry $25 for defending her."

He takes his family on a ship cruise where his wife consults Perry about the cash, but when Carl apparently goes overboard, she is charged with murder.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['William D. Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['asking for an autograph', 'accountant', 'dress', 'money belt', 'man uses a wheelchair', 'speaking on the telephone through a handkerchief', 'fingerprint', 'purser', 'ship captain', 'storm at sea', 'man overboard', 'ocean liner', 'courtroom spectator', 'title spoken by character']",[],"In his office, Andrew Dale (Maurice Wells), president of State National Savings & Loan, is reluctant to lose bookkeeper Carl Houser (Theodore Newton), but wishes him well. In a store room, Carl secretly loads up a money belt.

On the cruise ship Westminster, Perry and Della are returning from a contested will case in British Columbia. The meet come fellow passengers: Carl; his wife Anna (Lurene Tuttle); their daughter Laura (Maureen Cassidy); nurse Evelyn Whiting (Joan Tabor); Roger Cartman (Alec Cawthorne), her wheelchair bound and heavily bandaged patient who is unable to speak due to a broken neck; L.A. realtor Roland Carter (Ralph Dumke); and Roland's secretary Daniel James (Donald Lawton). In her cabin, Anna tells Perry about cash, originally $100,000, in the money belt, which Carl told her came from winning a lottery, but she believes was stolen. Perry has Paul investigate the matter, and soon he is in the office of the S&L president, trying to keep Dale from jumping to conclusions about Carl. Sure enough, the accountants report that the books balance perfectly.

On the ship, there's been a report of a man overboard. Perry goes to Anna's cabin, where a photo of Anna and Laura has been replaced by one of Carl. Captain Walters (Gavin Gordon) and ship's purser Buchanan (Noel Drayton) enter. They've found Carl's gun and believe he was washed overboard. A search of the cabin produces a dress Anna was wearing earlier, now very wet, and the money belt, which still has $91,500 in it. In jail, Anna says that Carl took off his money belt and left the cabin. She followed him to the boat deck, getting wet, but Carl kissed her and told her to leave. She also mentions that they moved to L.A. from Chicago about a year ago, the impetus apparently being a blizzard. Della informs Perry that daughter Laura has disappeared.

In court, Burger produces the ship's log to prove that Westminster was in California territorial waters, so the court has jurisdiction. Purser Buchanan testifies about finding the wet dress and the money belt. On cross-examination, he states that the last time he saw Carl alive was when he handed him a note from nurse Evelyn. She gave it to him when she and her patient Roger were exiting the lift that goes to the ship's hospital. During a recess, Paul brings Perry to a house in Pacific Palisades where Evelyn and her patient went after docking. Evelyn's address on the ship's passenger list was phony, and Paul couldn't find anything about Roger Cartman. They've both left the house, but the wheelchair is still inside. The house is owned by Chicago gambling figure Morgan Shreeves, who recently walked on a tax evasion charge. Perry decides he and Paul should enter the house through a window and leave their fingerprints.

Later, Paul calls Burger, disguising his voice, and tells Burger that Evelyn and her patient saw everything from the ship's hospital, and that they've left a house where Perry has left fingerprints. Burger of course thinks this means Perry bribed them to disappear, but it's really a scheme to get the police to track Evelyn down. In court, Burger calls Laura as his next witness. The police arrested her at LAX when she returned from San Francisco. She testifies that she was on 'A' Deck of the ship when she heard a gunshot on the boat deck immediately above. She looked up and saw what she thought was a woman pushing a man over the guard rail and the man falling into the sea. Burger gets her to admit that she thought the people she saw were her mother and father. On cross-examination, Perry gets her to recall that she reported over ship's radio that ""a man"" went overboard, not her father. She realizes that the notion that she saw her parents entered her mind later, when her father was reported missing. Before court recesses, Burger announces that Carl's body has been found.

Paul reports to Perry with details. The body was found floating a mile offshore and died of a gunshot, but not from Carl's gun, which had been found on the ship. Also, Carl was on the jury in Chicago that acquitted Shreeves. Back in court, Burger, openly out to get Perry, calls fingerprint expert Christopher Walsh (Bill Quinn). He produces prints found at the house in Pacific Palisades and testifies that they match Evelyn Whiting, an unknown person many of whose prints were on the wheelchair and thus assumed to be Roger Cartman, homeowner Morgan Shreeves, Perry Mason, and Paul Drake. On cross, Perry asks if he also has Carl Houser's prints from having recently identified the body, and he does. Perry then gets him to demonstrate identifying the prints without seeing the names written on the cards. In doing so, he finds prints on two cards that are identical - those of Carl and the man assumed to be Roger. (By now it should be obvious that there isn't a Roger Cartman, or an Alec Cawthorne.) So Carl was in the Pacific Palisades house at a time well after when he supposedly died aboard Westminster. Burger suspects trickery in all this and requests a recess, but Perry asks for the opportunity to examine Evelyn first, and Burger agrees.

She admits she and her husband worked for Shreeves and that Carl was bribed to hold out for his acquittal. That, not embezzlement, was the source of the $100,000. Shreeves was nervous about loose ends, so got Carl to agree to disappear. The ""body"" that Laura saw go overboard was actually a dummy, and the man in the wheelchair whom Perry and Della had seen with Evelyn earlier was Shreeves himself. The plan went wrong when Anna was accused of murder, as Carl wouldn't allow that to stand. Shreeves needed him dead. Knowing she's now suspected of murder, Evelyn screams for Shreeves to come forward. Her husband Roland Carter stands, shouts ""You want Morgan Shreeves? Well, here he is!"", and pulls Daniel James out of his seat.

At night in Perry's office, Paul looks out into rain, which makes him hungry. Luckily, Della arrives with food. Perry explains that a key clue was the substitution of Carl's photo for the one of Anna and Laura. Only Carl had a motive to do that, wanting a memento of the family he was reluctantly leaving - and that made sense only if he didn't expect to die. Della still credits Perry with mental telepathy, saying she was floored when James, not Carter, turned out to be Shreeves. Perry admits that he was floored too, which makes Paul choke on his sandwich."

Castle is murdered and Stephanie is charged. The case becomes confusing when not one but three identical guns are involved.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Anton Leader'],"['', '', '']",[],"['las vegas nevada', 'gambling debt', 'slot machine', 'gun', 'newspaper headline', 'used car lot', 'pay phone', 'telephone booth', 'punched in the stomach', 'motel', 'shooting craps', 'casino', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"At a Vegas casino, George Castle (Joe De Santis) looks on as Glenn Faulkner (Russell Thorson) loses at craps and has no more money to gamble away. At the office of the motel Glenn owns, Castle enters and tells Glenn he wants him to pay up on $8000 in promissory notes. He'd promised Glenn more times, but the only thing in writing is ""payable on demand"", and he's demanding. Glenn realizes that Castle's plan all along was to force him to sell his motel. Some investors want to put a casino on the property, and Castle promised he could get it for them. He even put of $50,000 as a guarantee. Castle decides Glenn is too tough to deal with, so he shoots him dead, hoping to fare better with his daughter Stephanie (Peggy McCay). However, when he goes to her in L.A., she puts him off. She won't do anything until she gets advice from her friend Mike Garvin (Sr.) (Lyle Talbot).

Michael Garvin, Jr. (William Swan), who was once engaged to Stephanie, goes to Castle to warn him off. Castle tells Junior he should go back to his used-car lot or his new bride, ex-model Margo Garvin (Ann McCrea). Then he slugs Junior and tosses him out. Castle next pays a call on Eva Elliott (Alix Talton), now working as Mike's secretary, and accuses her of telling Junior about his designs on Stephanie. He warns her that he knows about checks she forged back in Kansas. They're interrupted by a call from Stephanie, wanting to talk to Mike. Eva says he's away and she doesn't know when he'll be back. After Castle takes his leave, Eva calls Stephanie back and says that Mike is coming in from Vegas and that he left a message for Stephanie to meet him next morning in Perry's office. After hanging up, Castle lets Eva know that he was eavesdropping at the door, and repeats his threats to expose her.

In Perry's office, Mike says that Castle's offer of $90,000 is only half what the land is worth. He suspects Castle murdered Glenn. He mentions that he's well protected with three revolvers (with proper permits). He keeps one in his vault, one with his son Junior, and one in a holster he wears at all times. Perry tells him he should go to the Las Vegas police with his suspicions about Castle. The talk of her father's death upsets Stephanie, and Mike attempts to comfort her. After they leave, Della says she thinks Mike is in love with her.

Perry goes to see Castle and demands an offer of $225,000 for the land. Castle tries desperately to bargain, but Perry knows when someone is over a barrel. Castle finally agrees, and Perry tells him to come to the office next morning. He leaves the apartment building and calls Paul from a phone booth. As they discuss Castle, Perry sees Stephanie drive up and enter the building. Then the police arrive and Perry notices Stephanie attempting to sneak out a back way. He intercepts her and offers her a ride. As he's turning his car around, Lt. Tragg steps up and begins a friendly chat. Stephanie won't say a word. After Tragg leaves, Perry tells Stephanie that Castle has been murdered. She asks how he knows, and he says that nothing else would get the homicide lieutenant out late at night. She's still unwilling to talk about what happened.

The next day, Margo visits her husband at Junior's Used Cars to give him the gun he forgot to take with him. Mike calls Perry and asks him to defend Stephanie, even if it conflicts with his own interests. Perry visits Stephanie, who shows him the gun Mike gave her for her protection, after they left Perry's office. She says she's never fired it, but Perry checks and finds that it has been fired recently. She admits she visited Castle in the hope of learning something about her father's murder, but found him already dead. Perry visit's Junior's office, asks to see his gun and ""accidentally"" fires it, damaging Junior's desk. Perry hands the gun back to him and has him bring it to Stephanie. If she's ever asked, she's to say that Michael Garvin gave it to her. Perry and Della are dining al fresco when a tired Tragg shows up. He has arrested Stephanie, and ballistics tests show that the gun they found with her was the murder weapon. Now Perry worries that he may have framed his own client.

In court, Eva testifies that she saw Mike with no gun in his holster the night of the murder. She knows of the three guns, but couldn't possible tell one from another, as they are identical except for serial number. During a recess, Paul reports that Castle secretly owned 40% of Julie's, a swanky dress shop in Vegas. Della calls it the kind of place where expensive (in 1958 dollars) merchandise is shown by long-legged models. Both Eva and Margo were formerly among these, and Paul is surprised when Mike claims he never knew that about his secretary and daughter-in-law. Back in court, Junior testifies about Perry's visit to the lot, and angrily accuses him of switching guns. He points out that the gun that was originally in his possession could be identified by the initials he had scratched on the handle. It's not the one proved to be the murder weapon. On cross-examination, he admits to Margo having brought him a gun when he forgot it. Perry suggests that she would have had time to shoot Castle with it. Now Junior gets really mad, until the judge (Frank Wilcox) reins him in with the threat of a contempt citation.

Burger tries to rectify confusion over three guns by calling them the ""vault gun"", ""Junior gun"", and ""holster gun"" and attempting to trace their movements. Having ballistics check the bullet Perry fired into Junior's desk would have helped, but the bullet ricocheted out a window and couldn't be found. Perry wonders if Eva thinks of Mike as a father figure, but she insists he's ""much younger"" than her father. (This was obviously just her perception. Lyle Talbot was four years older than Russell Thorson.) She thinks his questions are irrelevant, but he says they may hold the answer to the mystery of the guns.

Perry recalls Mike, who testifies that he visited Stephanie late that night (after the murder) and switched the gun he'd previously given Stephanie (""holster gun"") with his spare (""vault gun""), which he'd just retrieved. He explains that he made the switch out of fear that Stephanie had shot Castle in self-defense. Only he and Eva had the combination to the vault. Perry says that since Mike's office is close to Castle's apartment building, Eva had time in the half-hour that Mike was away to remove the ""vault gun"", kill Castle with in, then return it to the vault, following which Mike took it. She confesses, explaining that she was trying to get out from under the hold that Castle had on her.

At the used-car lot, Junior is getting the new desk that Perry is going to pay for. The movement of the three guns still doesn't make sense, but we learn that Stephanie, fearing that Mike might have shot Castle, hid the ""Junior gun"" and let the police find the ""vault gun"", which was still in her possession. She and Mike are at the Hall of Records at the moment, getting a marriage license.

To review: (1) Initially, the three guns are in their rightful places. (2) Mike gives Stephanie the ""holster gun"". (3) Eva takes the ""vault gun"" from the vault, shoots Castle with it, and returns it. (3) Mike takes the ""vault gun"" and switches it with the ""holster gun"". He thinks he's just taken a possible murder weapon from her and replaced it with an innocent gun. However, from this point until her arrest, Stephanie possesses the murder weapon. (4) The next day, Junior forgets to take the ""Junior gun"" with him, but Margo brings it to him. (5) Stephanie shows Perry the ""vault gun"" and he finds that it's been fired. He gives it back to her. (6) Perry borrows the ""Junior gun"" from Junior and fires it, then has Stephanie accept it from Junior. (7) Stephanie, willing to sacrifice herself to protect Mike, hides the ""Junior gun"" but leaves the ""vault gun"" in plain sight. (8) The police find it and identify it as the murder weapon. (9) At some point, the police also find the ""Junior gun"", since it's introduced as evidence at trial. They'd know it was fired, and might be evidence of Perry's shenanigans, but it wasn't the murder weapon. (10) Presumably, they verify that the ""holster gun"" hadn't been fired and was where it should be, in Mike's possession."

Stewart Brent marries Miss Anne Rowan in Las Vegas"". She goes to tell her roommate and fellow blonde Enid Griffin (Barbara Baxley), but finds her unconscious. She's taken an overdose of sleeping pills, but Sheila found her in time and Enid will be O.K. She tells Sheila she was upset over the marriage, as she's now in love with Stewart, for whom she works as private secretary. She regrets the suicide attempt and vows to fight for Stewart.

Stewart (Grant Withers) arrives at the Brent Building, which he owns, and runs into Perry, whose offices are there. He invites Perry and Della to a reception in honor of his bride. After Stewart gets to his office, where Sheila also works as a secretary-receptionist, Arthur Binney (Richard Erdman) enters and asks to see Stewart. Sheila hands him over to Enid, who soon after enters Stewart's office and says that Binney wants to see him on a private matter concerning his wife. While there, she surreptitiously turns on the intercom, then leaves as Binney enters. He claims to represent a scandal magazine, but it's just a cover for a blackmail scheme. He gives Stewart a copy of a mugshot indicating that Anne spent a year in jail on insurance fraud. He wants $30,000 in one week. Enid hears all this, but Stewart notices that the intercom is already on when he uses it to have Enid contact the Paul Drake Detective Agency. Paul comes to see him, and Stewart admits he'd met Anne in Vegas and had only known her for two weeks when they got married. Paul will need Anne's fingerprints to check the validity of the mugshot, so Stewart invites him to the reception.

At the reception, Anne (Mari Aldon), another blonde, tells the bartender to make new martinis with less vermouth, despite Enid's mention that the first Mrs. Brent liked them that way. Anne is clearly trying to win over the reluctant Enid. She candidly admits to habitually misplacing earrings, and lights Enid's cigarette. Much to their surprise, Della and Perry see Paul swipe the lighter that Anne just put down. After the party, Paul meets Stewart at the latter's office and says Anne's prints match the mugshot. She really did spend a year in jail in Tacoma, WA. After Paul leaves, Stewart grabs several packets of bills and a gun from the desk and puts them in his briefcase. He gets a call from Binney, who tells him the week is up and directs him to the Valley Motel, telling him to register as Thomas Walsh.

At the motel, Binney tells his female partner (whom we never see clearly) that she needs to leave because Stewart is on his way. She drops a towel she was using and goes. Binney apparently knows that Stewart will be given the unit adjoining his own, since he comes through the connecting door and hides behind the outer door to Stewart's unit. Once Stewart enters, Binney knocks him on the head with a blunt instrument and grabs the briefcase from the unconscious body. He dumps the contents on the bed and takes the money, but avoids touching the gun. When Stewart wakes up, he goes to the bathroom shared by the two units to deal with his head wound. He picks up the towel and his gun falls out. There's a small hole encircled with a black substance on the towel. The phone in Binney's room starts ringing, and when Stewart looks in, he sees a dead Binney. The money is gone, but Stewart finds an earring next to the body. He wraps it in the towel and puts it in his coat pocket. Motel manager Harry Mitchell (Wally Brown), who has been calling for Binney, enters and catches Stewart with the gun in his hand. Later, Lt. Tragg has arrived and Stewart freely confesses to the murder. He's put in Tragg's police car, but the lieutenant is delayed by a call from Burger, so there's no one in the back seat with Stewart. He takes opportunity to cram the towel down into the seat.

When Perry visits Anne, she refuses to believe Stewart's confession that Binney was blackmailing him for involvement in a hit-and-run, so Stewart killed him. Perry says that a false confession means Stewart is shielding someone, and Anne is the most likely. It follows that Binney would try blackmailing her too. She admits to her year in Tacoma jail and that she'd given Binney a $2500 pair of earrings to buy him off, but swears that she's never been to the Valley Motel. In jail, Stewart admits to Perry that his confession was a like and gives him a summary of the events at the motel. He says Enid can prove he had her withdraw $30,000 from his bank account.

In Perry's office, Paul reports that Binney was an experienced blackmailer, having recently arrived from Tacoma. In the past, he had always worked solo. Enid arrives with the bank book that shows the $30,000 withdrawal. She mentions that when she saw Stewart in jail, he told her about the towel and earring he hid in Tragg's car. She says they have to find it before the police do, but this is one of the days when Perry is against evidence tampering. Later, at the police garage, the attendant (Cy Malis) wishes Tragg a happy birthday. Asked what makes him think that, he says a woman came by asking to leave a surprise birthday present in the lieutenant's car. She was quite upset when she wasn't allowed to do this. This gives Tragg an idea, so he and Sgt. Brice (Lee Miller) search the car and find the towel.

At the motel, Harry has let Perry and Della access to the crime scene. Perry examines a hole in the wall, from which the police have already extracted a bullet. Harry mentions that Binney was periodically visited by a blonde, and there was also a woman who called him nearly every day. She was calling when Harry came into the room, wondering why Binney didn't answer, and encountered Stewart. Later, Perry gets a call from an unidentified woman. She tips him off about Enid's suicide attempt.

In court, Enid identifies Stewart's briefcase. Burger mentions a statement Stewart made about finding his intercom open, which forces Enid to testify to the blackmail threat she overheard. She also discusses withdrawing the $30,000 and giving it to Stewart, but has to admit that she can't know whether he actually took it with him. Tragg testifies that the police tracked the path of the bullet, and concluded that the shot was fired from the doorway between Binney's unit and the one Stewart rented as Thomas Walsh. He also identifies the towel and earring he found in his car, and reports that it was one of a pair Stewart had purchased. Dr. Cortley (Alan Dexter), a consultant to the LAPD crime lab, testifies that tests prove that the towel was used normally, as indicated by traces of lipstick, etc., However, it was also used as a silencer, thus explaining why no one heard a gunshot at the time of the murder. On cross-examination, he says that traces of hair on the towel were from a peroxide blonde who was originally a light brunette. He says it's possible that the bullet tracking was off by as much as a few feet, making it possible that the gun was fired from near the bathroom.

During a recess, Paul confirms Enid's suicide attempt. Perry has him take photos of the three blonde women involve in the case to Harry, in the hope that some time to study them will make it easier for him to identify Binney's visitor in court. The next day, Harry testifies that no woman was with Binney near the time of the murder, but there was a blonde visitor to his room 2 or 3 times a week. He identifies Sheila as the visitor. She admits to being Binney's partner, but vehemently insists that he was alive when she left.

Later, Anne goes to the Valley Motel and asks to register in Binney's old unit, saying she's going to play ""Button, button, who's got the button?"" She tells Harry that she was the real mastermind of the blackmail scheme, Sheila just being a go-between. She decided to get $30,000 from Stewart because the marriage couldn't last long. She asks him where the money is, pointing out that she'd given Binney two earrings ""to make the plot look good"", so Harry must have taken them both but dropped one while moving the money. She says that Harry is entitled to $1,000 for his part in the plot, but he disagrees and pulls a gun. Tragg and his men enter and arrest Harry. Perry and Stewart follow, and the latter runs to Anne, clearly delighted with the success of her charade. Perry tells Tragg that Harry was the person best positioned to enter Binney's unit while Stewart was unconscious. Stewart and Anne are apparently busy congratulating each other on the outcome, so Tragg suggests he and Perry wait in the car."

Russell'],"['', '', '']",[],"['hedge', 'car', 'motel', 'dog', 'footprint', 'cigarette smoking', 'amnesia', 'pay phone', 'telephone booth', 'courtroom spectator']",[],"Bertie Allred (Neil Hamilton, Commissioner Gordon on ""Batman"") asks his wife Lucille (Ann Lee) if dinner can be delayed, as his employee Bob Fleetwood (Harry Townes) is coming. His stepdaughter Pat Faxon (Yvonne Craig, Barbara Gordon on ""Batman"") says Bertie should move his car, which is partially blocking the driveway. She clipped the hedge while maneuvering around it. When Bertie does so, he finds a collapsed Bob near the hedge and brings him into the house.

On Monday morning, Della brings Perry a check for $2500 and a letter from Lucille asking him to represent Pat or her if it should become necessary. Perry visits Pat, who explains about possibly hitting Bob with her car. Luckily, he wasn't dead, just unconscious, but he woke with amnesia. Bertie and Lucille took him out of the house, but Pat doesn't know where. She mentions that Lucille plans to get a divorce, which upsets the greedy Bertie, since her wealth isn't community property. Perry suggests an alternate explanation: someone slugged Bob to frame Lucille. If it's Bertie, that makes him dangerous.

Paul has learned that Lucille is at the Mountain View Hotel, so he and Perry drive there in heavy rain. The door to her unit is open and there are signs that a man and a woman were there until recently. Perry finds Lucille at her home. She says that she and Bob were waiting for Bertie in her unit, but eventually Bob went back to his adjoining unit and when she checked on him discovered he'd left and driven off in her car. She called Pat to pick her up. Lt. Tragg arrives with the news that Lucille's car has been found at the bottom of a canyon, with a dead Bob. The car was in neutral, so it's murder. He says that Lucille was seen to have left with Bob, then returned on foot before Pat came to take her home. After getting word from another detective, Tragg makes a revision: despite having Bob's identification, the corpse is definitely not him, but Bertie.

Paul has learned that Bob is staying at the ranch of P. E. Overbrook (James Bell) a few miles from the hotel. Perry and Della go there, with Della posing as the amnesiac's wife Mabel. He denies ever having seen her before. When Perry asks how would he know, he says it's just a feeling. They manage to get him to leave with them, and turn him over to LAPD, where he's questioned and then sent to the hospital. Tragg tells Perry that Bob remembers walking along the hedge when something hit him, but nothing after that.

Lucille denies going in the car with Bob. She says she walked down to the road from the hotel to attempt to hitchhike, but changed her mind and came back, where Pat found her. She says that Bertie was a liar and a cheat. He might have gone as far as murdering her to prevent her threatened divorce. Perry notes that Burger can use that as a motive for her to kill him first. Paul reports that Bob was visited at the hospital by his girlfriend, Bernice Archer (Frances Helm). They visit her, and she says she wasn't worried because Bob had experienced bouts of amnesia before, and when he called from the hospital he said he wasn't mixed up in anything.

At the hospital, Perry and Tragg confront Bob with inconsistencies in his supposed amnesia. He says that at his job he'd discovered papers showing that Bertie had forged a survey on mining property in order to swindle his partner out of a fortune. Unfortunately, he exclaimed ""What's this?"" on seeing the evidence - Bertie heard this, figured out what it was about, and knocked Bob unconscious. On Monday night, Bertie came back to the hotel with a gun, obviously intending to murder him, and perhaps Lucille too. He forced Lucille to get into the trunk of the car and made Bob drive. On the steep road, Bob suddenly accelerated then slammed on the brakes, causing Bertie to bump his head on the dashboard and drop the gun. Bob grabbed it and conked him on the head with it. He went to Overbrook's ranch because he was aware that Overbrook was another person Bertie had swindled. At the ranch, he parked the car between the road and the house, and area that was muddy after the earlier rain. Then Lucille somehow got the trunk open, or maybe it wasn't closed all the way. She jumped out and ran toward the road, ignoring Bob. Once they leave the room, Tragg tells Perry that the police have secret information that confirms Bob's story, and even Bob doesn't know about it yet.

In court, Bob tells his story. On cross-examination, Perry merely asks Bob why Bertie was found with his personal possessions and ID. Bob says Bertie must have taken them for reasons of his own. Burger now reveals the source of the secret information. It turns out that Overbrook is an experienced tracker. Using a detailed diagram made by the police, he recounts how the morning after Bob's arrival he backtracked along the route Bob had left, leading him to where Lucille's car had been left. He found tracks of a woman's shoes, running from near where the trunk would have been to the road, and walking from another part of the road to the car. There are also tire tracks of the car being turned around and driven back on the road. There are also prints Overbrook made when he walked from this area to the farm road, from which he gathered boards he set down so investigators could walk from the farm road to the car's location without disturbing things. Lucille tells Perry that she didn't make any of the tracks.

During a recess, Perry, Della, and Paul go to the Overbrook farm. Della notices the gap between the two sets of woman's footprints. ""Coming and going"" says Perry. Paul's worried that there's nothing there to contradict Bob's account. Bernice couldn't have made the tracks Monday night, because her whereabouts have been confirmed. Perry has Della try running in the mud, but ultimately concludes that something Paul said is the key to the mystery.

Back in court, Perry calls Bernice. He has a record of a phone call to her from Bob on the murder night. He suggests that early Tuesday morning, by which time knowledge of all her movements was no longer certain, she could have made false prints to frame Lucille. She denies it, so Perry calls Overbrook for the purpose of proving his suggestion. He gets the tracking expert to admit that there's nothing in the prints that shows that the track from the car to the road was made first. Someone could have walked from the road to where the car had been then run back to the road. Overbrook admits it, and adds that there was a bush squashed by the car that the woman could have stepped on to avoid leaving prints in the gap between the two sets of prints. So the tracks don't confirm Bob's improbably story of Lucille escaping from the trunk after all. Perry then asks him to explain his dog Prince's footprints, which are also on the police diagram. They show that Prince made lots of prints between the car area and the farm road, but did not accompany Overbrook when he backtracked Bob from the house to the farm. So these prints were the result of separate occasions. Perry suggests that Overbrook did the backtracking while leaving Prince to guard Bob, found the car with an unconscious Bertie, a man he hated. He took the car and ran it into the canyon, then returned. Later, he realized there were prints of him going to the car but not leaving the area. Therefore, he got the boards and laid them to cover up his approach to the car area, then stepped off and walked back to the farm road. On this occasion, Prince was with him. Overbrook admits his actions, but says that Bertie was already dead when he found him. Bob shouts ""That's a lie! He was all right!""

Leaving court, Perry says Paul gave him the key to the solution when he talked about the woman's prints ""coming and going"" - the opposite order from what everyone was assuming. (However, it was Perry himself who used those words, not Paul.) Burger thanks Perry for handing him the guilty party - it had to be Overbrook. Perry counters with some alternative assumptions that make it credible that Bob is guilty, and Burger leaves, annoyed. Perry admits to Paul and Della that Burger had it right. He just doesn't want to establish the precedent of agreeing with the D.A."

With Joe in serious difficulty, Ethel asks Perry Mason to defend him, then disappears.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Arthur Marks'],"['', '', '']",[],"['16mm film', 'confession to murder', 'framed for murder', 'woman uses a wheelchair', 'speaking on the telephone through a handkerchief', 'home movie', 'wiping off fingerprints', 'courtroom spectator', 'death of son', 'jail visit', 'male police officer', 'police', 'police officer', 'jewelry store']",[],"At the Larkin Import/Export company, secretary Lorraine Stevens (Andra Martin) is working late when company executive George Durell (Herbert Rudley) apologetically gives her an extra bit of filing to do. As he heads for the office of the boss, Philip Larkin (Terry Becker), Philip comes out and tells George to wait for him. Philip then proceeds to invite himself to Lorraine's place, but she says no. She angrily ended their relationship due to ""cruel accusations"" that Philip made. Philip waves an envelope in her face, saying it contains proof, which he intends to use to force her back to him. He's in the middle of an ""If I can't have you, no one will"" threat when senior secretary Irene Collaro (Virginia Field) reminds him that George is waiting.

Lorraine gets a note - she assumes it's from George - telling her to go to Alcorn's Jewelers and pick up a package. She arrives just before their 9 PM closing, and Mr. Alcorn (Chet Stratton) has no record of such a package. She tries calling George, but the phone is answered by George's wheelchair-bound wife Claire, who believes any woman who communicates with George is having an affair with him. She yells at Lorraine, calling her a trollop, but hangs up when George enters the room. Lorraine next tries calling Philip, but Philip can't answer because he's lying on the floor of his room, dead. Next to him are a gun and a nervous Joseph Harrison (John Hoyt). Handkerchief in hand, he picks up the phone and puts it back down, then leaves the house. This has the effect of making Lorraine give up on dealing with the supposed package, so she apologizes for keeping Alcorn past closing time and leaves the store.

A couple hours later, Joseph returns to the house to find Lt. Tragg and his men in mid-investigation. Someone must have given them a tip almost immediately after the murder. Joseph tells Tragg he has come to see his ex-wife, Ethel (Fay Wray), who is Philip's mother by her first husband. Tragg produces the murder weapon, a World War I German gun, and Joseph admits it's his. Tragg already knows that for 6 months Joseph was under a doctor's care in Utah, up until 2 weeks ago. Joseph confirms this and says he spent the past two weeks at Lake Tahoe and just drove back to L.A.

The next day, Tragg shows Burger that Joseph's fingerprints are on the gun case, despite his claim that he'd just arrived. They couldn't be old prints, as the Harrison's maid, Sarah Winslow (Nancy Kulp), reported that she'd polished the case earlier that day. There were no identifiable prints on the gun itself. She also told Tragg that Philip resented Joseph, who when he married Ethel took over management of the company her first husband had founded, dissolving his own smaller company. Philip somehow worked on his mother until she finally agreed to divorce Joseph and let Philip take over the company. This is enough for Burger - he tells Tragg to bring in Joseph.

In Perry's office, Ethel asks Perry to represent Joseph, who has been arrested. It's clear to Perry that she's still in love with her ex-husband. In jail, Joseph admits to Perry that he went to Philip's room arount 9 PM and found him dead. He guesses that he must have touched the gun case in a moment of panic after seeing his gun on the floor. Lorraine tells Perry about her fruitless trip to the jewelry and unavailing phone calls. This sounds like an arranged alibi to Perry, but Paul reports that Alcorn confirms it. Paul hasn't been able to learn why Lorraine stopped seeing Philip. What he does know, from a source he won't even tell Perry, is that Burger apparently has secret evidence that will send Joseph straight to the gas chamber.

Ethel has disappeared, and both Perry and Burger want her found. Paul goes to Irene's apartment posing as a gas company man. Unfortunately, Irene just had a visit from the real gas man two days ago. She says Ethel isn't there and won't let Paul inside. Meanwhile, Sarah visits Burger and tells him that Ethel packed and left shortly after talking to Perry. Burger, true to form, jumps to the conclusion that Perry is guilty of professional misconduct.

In court, Sarah recounts what has she already told. On cross-examination, she explains that she was in the kitchen at the time, therefore at a distant part of a large, solidly-built house. No phone near her location rang when Lorraine called, because Philip had a separate line. Perry asks about her prints being on a door to Philip's room. She says she must have opened the door to air out the room, but doesn't remember when. Burger forces Lorraine to admit that Joseph was affectionate to her in a fatherly way, and objected to Philip as unworthy of her. Burger then plays a silent home movie, although it's admissibility is subject to later voir dire. (The term can refer not only to jury selection but to things like establishing the qualifications of an expert witness. Apparently, something like that is intended here, with the film instead of an expert.) The film shows Joseph and Lorraine as she tries on a necklace. They laugh and smile at the camera, until Philip enters. There is angry arguing and pointing at the camera, climaxing with Joseph punching Philip, knocking him into a hedge.

During a recess, Joseph refuses to say what the fight was about. Meanwhile, Claire finds a torn-up letter from Ethel to George and draws her usual conclusion. Unconvincingly attempting to disguise her voice, she calls Perry and tells him to investigate Ethel, because she's in love with George. Perry points out that he doesn't know where Ethel is, so Claire reads the return address on Ethel's letter. It's Irene's apartment. Perry finds Ethel there, and she explains that the letter was just information she wanted George to pass on to Joseph. Perry says he needs Ethel in court, but Irene insists that this could hurt an innocent party. Perry realizes that Irene was the one behind the camera on that home movie. Tragg arrives, ending any debate about where Ethel will be tomorrow.

In court, Irene reveals that in the film, Philip was accusing Joseph of being Lorraine's father. Perry insists on his right to go beyond normal cross-examination rules because they're in a voir dire. He notes Irene's foreign accent and asks how she got her job. She says that while scouting for possible European branch offices, they came to where she was working in Paris, and she ended up working for Joseph. She never heard any hint that Joseph was Lorraine's father. Perry says there are records of Irene's monthly checks to Lorraine's childhood foster parents, and she got Lorraine her job. He concludes that all that pointing at the camera in the movie was because Philip was also accusing Irene, behind the camera, of being Lorraine's mother. She admits it's true. Perry has the court reporter (Richard Bull) read back the part of Irene's testimony where she said ""they came"", so it wasn't just Joseph. Who is she protecting? George confesses to being Lorraine's father and to murdering Philip, which was his way of finally trying to protect her.

Later, Della tells Paul that George didn't intend to frame Joseph by using his gun. He did this merely to confuse the case because, unaware of Joseph's departure from Utah, he thought the police would find that Joseph was a thousand miles away at the time. It was his note that sent Lorraine on the errand to the jewelry store, establishing her alibi around 9. He also tipped the police to the murder soon afterward, so they'd arrive soon enough to get a good fix on the time of death and rule out Lorraine as a suspect."

Diana grabs the gun, but in the struggle it goes off, sending a bullet into the wall and bringing in building superintendent Otto Kessler (Ludwig Stössel). Diana only stays at the apartment on her days off from her secretarial job at the home of wealthy Matthew Bartlett (R.G. Armstrong), where she also has a room. On her next day at work, Matthew's stepson Tony Davis (Jan Merlin) makes a pass at Diana, annoying her. He's the cause of the friction between her and Marian, whom he's seeing. It amuses the smug Tony to tell Marian that Diana keeps throwing herself at him. Diana leaves the room, giving Tony a chance to snoop. He finds an anonymous letter to Matthew claiming that his late son Robert and Robert's wife Norma Carter (Adventures of Superman (1952)'s Phyllis Coates) had a son, Bobby (Casey Peters), and that Norma is an unfit mother to Matthew's grandson. Later, Tony shows the letter to his mother, now Helen Bartlett (Irene Hervey), who only married Matthew to provide security for ne'er-do-well Tony. Helen knows the claim in the letter is plausible, so she sends Tony to visit Bobby and his mom at her house. He's useless as a spy, and Norma tells him to get out.

Helen and Tony decide to get rid of Diana by planting ""stolen"" jewelry in Diana's room at the Bartlett house shortly before Matthew returns from a trip. Diana says she intends to tell Matthew about the stolen anonymous letter, so they forcibly throw her out. In the process, Tony strikes her, giving her the titular black eye. Diana goes to Perry, who has Della take a photo of Diana's injury, then they drive her to her apartment. The next day, Perry goes to see Matthew, who doesn't need any convincing that Diana is the injured party. He regrets his marriage to Helen, which was the result of an emotional tailspin after the death of his son. He already knew about Bobby, as the anonymous letter writer had previously called him with the same information, which Matthew pretended to disbelieve. The letter was obviously a second attempt by the same source. Unexpectedly, Lt. Tragg enters and says that Diana has been murdered, her body and car having been found outside Norma's house. However, when they arrive at the scene, Matthew recognizes the body as Marian's. When Norma returns home, she says that she and Marian were good friends.

Diana is missing, but before long comes to Perry's office and explains: That night, she received a call that her car had been involved in an accident. This lures Diana to the scene, leaving footprints for the police to later identify, of course. She finds no one home, but then discovers Marian's body. Panicking, she finds her car won't start, so she hitches a ride to Union Station and spends the night there. Tragg arrives to arrest her as a suspected murderer. Perry interviews Diana in jail, and from her account of how she got her job, gets her to realize that Matthew only hired her as a pipeline to information about Bobby, who often visited his mother's friend Marian.

In court, D.A. Burger brings out the footprint evidence and Kessler's misleading account of the gun incident. Tony testifies that he and Marian were engaged, and that Diana was angry about it. Perry cross-examines him aggressively, bringing up the black eye. After court is adjourned, Matthew meets with Norma, begs her to let him bring up Bobby, and offers her $100,000 to make up for his earlier shabby treatment of her. At first, Norma rejects the money, but takes it when Matthew asks her to do it for Bobby's sake. Back in court, Burger introduces Marian's diary, which the police found in her apartment, to show the tension between her and Diana over Tony. Perry insists that he has the right to look over the diary, to check whether the parts that Burger had read were taken out of context. The judge lets him do so during an adjournment.

Soon, Perry and Della make a call on Norma. There were entries in the diary that meant nothing to the police or Burger, who didn't know about the situation with Bobby, but revealed much to Perry. He tells Norma he knows that she is not Bobby's mother, Marian was. (The father isn't named, but he wasn't Robert Bartlett.) Norma took the child from her unwed friend, supposedly out of kindness, but actually with the long-range goal of selling him to Matthew. She even was the source of the anonymous messages, and called herself an unfit mother to plant the seed in Matthew's mind that he should take Bobby. However, Marian's return to L.A. complicated things, so Norma murdered her to keep her from interfering. Norma leaves her house and drives off, with the police in pursuit. She swerves to avoid a bus and crashes. Dying in the hospital, she confesses. Burger moves to have Tony arrested for perjury.

In the epilogue, Perry decides not to reveal to Matthew that Bobby is unrelated to him. He does point out that raising a small boy may be a job for more than just a grandfather. Matthew takes the hint and decides to call Diana to see if she'd like to help out. Helen is apparently out of the picture. Della wonders whether Perry is doing the right thing, but when he asks her if she can think of one good reason for spilling the beans about Bobby, she admits that she can't even think of a bad reason."

Lumis and his partner (Alan Marshal) leave the office for the airport to meet their South African partner, George Baxter (Jack Raine). A woman (Joanna Moore) - the ""Terrified Typist"" of the title - enters the office and starts searching for something. She's caught by Baxter, who has arrived early. She escapes him, and enters Perry's outer office. Gertie (Connie Cezon), the rarely-seen receptionist, assumes this is the typist Della requested from a temp agency, and the woman plays along. In Perry's private office, Paul mentions the police search for a would-be burglar of the SADC offices. Della realizes that the description fits her new typist, who has suddenly left.

Perry goes up to the SADC offices, on the way encountering an attractive woman (Joan Elan). (Much later, he'll learn this is Mrs. Lumis). Mr. Lumis tells Perry that after reporting the attempted burglary, Baxter disappeared. A ""wharf rat"" named Jack Gillly (Hank Patterson) sees a man dumping a body in the water, recovers it, and reports to Lt. Tragg. The corpse is Baxter, and in a line-up, Gilly points out the man he saw dumping it, identified as Duane Johnson, who quickly becomes Perry's client. As usual, Perry is faced with a client who's less than forthcoming, saying he has an alibi, but because it was a married lady, he won't identify her.

Meanwhile, Paul has tracked down the typist - she's Patricia Taylor, a senator's wife. Perry and Paul interview her, and she admits that when she first met her future husband, she found him pompous and drew some mocking cartoons which she sent to Duane Johnson, whom she thought was a friend. Later, she wrote to get them back and Johnson wrote that he'd hand them over, but at a meeting on the night of Baxter's murder, she's told that the letters could be used against the senator, unless some payment was forthcoming. Perry pressures her to come forward, so she does - to D.A. Burger.

In the People v. Jefferson jury trial, Heinrich (Harold Dyrenforth), a servant at the house Baxter had rented, testifies that he heard Baxter in an argument earlier in the evening of the murder. Perry gets him to admit that people could have come and gone without him knowing, and that he didn't see or hear any actual violence. The defendant takes the stand but still refuses to name his alibi. Patricia testifies she was at the restaurant to discuss the cartoons for about 15 minutes. A photo of the meeting was taken by a restaurant photographer. There's another photo of the defendant there with a different woman. Burger is more interested in bringing out details of the attempted blackmail, including introducing apparently friendly letters from Johnson to Patricia. He also points out that the meeting at the restaurant was short enough that it allowed the defendant time to commit the murder and dump the body. The jury returns a verdict of guilty on the charge of 1st degree murder.

The papers are full of predictions that Perry's going to lose a client to the gas chamber, but he's more preoccupied by that second photo. The woman in it looks familiar, and he finally places her as the one he saw exiting the SADC offices. He correctly guesses it might be Mrs. Lumis, and she's the one his client is protecting. She agrees to testify, but once Perry leaves, we learn that this will require her to stay behind while Mr. Lumis heads to Mexico with a ""package"". Then Lumis goes to retrieve a man he's been keeping prisoner, but Paul and Perry catch him.

In court, Perry reveals that the kidnapped man he just rescued is the real Duane Jefferson (Steve Carruthers), and the man he's been defending is an imposter, James Kincaid. Perry moves to have the entire case thrown out on a technicality. Some of the evidence Burger had produced (the letters to Patricia) were from the real Jefferson, not Kincaid. So this was false evidence with respect to the defendant, even though Burger had acted in good faith (since he believed that the real Jefferson was on trial). With the entire case thrown into confusion, the judge continues the hearing to a later day.

In Perry's office, he explains how Lumis wanted to steal diamonds from Baxter. When the real Jefferson wouldn't go along, he conspired with Kincaid - who decided to add some blackmail and murder into what Lumis expected to be mere larceny. Because of the identity confusion, Burger is going to have to try the entire case over again, but Perry is sure he'll win in the end. It's clear that Perry feels no obligation at all to Kincaid, because he agreed to defend a man named Duane Jefferson. Perry, Paul, and Della are on their way to dinner with the real Jefferson, a treat by Senator and Mrs. Taylor, who are grateful that Perry didn't introduce Patricia's cartoons in the trial."

Willard's wife Arlene (Mary Anderson) takes charge and says not to honor the check and to tell Donna the truth - that Daniel is as crazy as they come. Daniel enters, takes the call, and insists the bank honor the check.

Donna brings the cash to Maury, who takes $500 to pay off former private investigator Dave Kemp (Alan Lee), who helped track down Daniel. Dave was promised half, but he can't even finish threatening Maury before Donna pulls a gun on him. Dave goes to Arlene and Willard, telling them that Maury and Donna will take Daniel ""for every dime they have"" (sic). He doesn't know what they have on Daniel to use for blackmail. Arlene's the one who knows what to do. They take an extremely unwilling Daniel to the Norris sanitarium, and tell Dr. Norris (Richard Aherne) that Daniel has been giving money to strangers. Norris diagnoses senile dementia.

In Perry's office, Millie Foster (Kitty Kelly), saying she's Daniel's fiancée, ask for help in getting him released. Perry petitions for a writ of habeas corpus. At the hearing, the Scotts' attorney George Metcalf (Simon Scott) explains to a skeptical Judge Treadwell (Richard Gaines) that Daniel is physically unable to be in court, as ordered. Norris explains than Daniel's absence was under his orders, because Daniel would be over-excited by the hearing. He explains that his diagnosis was based on Daniel's violent behavior and an arcus senilis (a crescent ring on the cornea) in his right eye. Perry points out that the judge also has this symptom. Norris tries to explain that he evaluated the combination of symptoms, but the judge interrupts. It's clear to him that if he'd objected to being kidnapped and manhandled, having this thing in his eye, he'd have been declared senile too. He orders the court to reconvene at the sanitarium, but when they get there, Daniel has cleverly escaped. He knocked out an attendant with a bar of soap inside a sock, then left, disguised as a laundryman. The judge has heard enough. He grants the writ of habeas corpus and says Norris will have to answer to contempt of court charges. Perry wonders where Daniel has gone.

As it happens, Daniel is in Maury's hotel room, bending over the blackmailer's corpse. He calls Millie and tells her to meet him at the usual place. As he leaves, janitor Victor Kowalski (Sid Tomack), in the process of carrying away a broken sand jar, sees Daniel, who is still pretending to be a laundryman. Later, the hunt is on for Daniel, and Paul reports that Millie is missing too. Dave calls Perry and tells him about Donna's relationship with Maury. Perry heads to her apartment, but Lt. Tragg gets there first. She's drinking to forget, but it's not working and she decides that revenge is better. She's quite willing to cooperate with the police in any way that will put Maury's killer in the gas chamber.

Millie calls and says that she and Daniel are in Reno. Paul and Perry go there and here Daniel's story. 30 years ago, he was in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he first met Millie. He and his partner Monty Siwel (sp?) discovered a gold mine. The greedy Monty tried to kill his partner, but Daniel was hot. He fired the first shot. He buried Monty in the snow, told people that Monty had to go to Seattle on business, and disappeared from Fairbanks by buying tickets to Seattle in Monty's name, which he used with Millie. They were married there, but she left him because he wouldn't go to the police about Monty. Later, Maury found the body, figured out what had happened, and eventually showed up to blackmail Daniel. Tragg enters with Nevada state troopers, and Daniel agrees to waive extradition.

After they leave, Perry and Paul discuss Tragg's surprisingly opportune arrivals. He suspects his office is bugged. He has Paul get a message to Della, so she'll know what Perry has in mind to confuse the police and Burger. The next day, he calls her at the office and makes up a story that Monty Siwel and Maury Lewis are the same person. He mentions that one surname spelled backwards is similar to the other (suggesting that Monty's last name is something other than ""Siwel"", as reported on IMDb, but not included on the episode credits). Daniel had a stronger motive than just blackmail to kill the partner he cheated out of a fortune. When Paul and Perry fly back to L.A., they are greeted by Della, who says that Perry's invented tale turns out to be completely true. Police in Alaska had Monty's fingerprints on file, and they match Maury's. In jail, Daniel tells Perry that he really thought at the time that he'd killed Monty, unaware that native trappers found him and nursed him back to health. He found out 3 months ago when Maury showed up for blackmail.

In court, Tragg testifies about switchboard records at Maury's hotel showing the call to Millie. On cross-examination, Perry asks him about what Tragg learned of the victim's movements after leaving Alaska. Tragg says Monty went from Fairbanks to Seattle where he married Millie, to various places, ending in a hotel in Phoenix before coming to L.A. Perry then asks about what Tragg learned from the Phoenix hotel manager, forcing Tragg to give a description that obviously matches Daniel, not Monty. Tragg has no explanation for the discrepancy. Victor testifies about seeing Daniel leave Maury's room at 9:26, saying that he checked his pocket watch. Perry points out that, by his own testimony, he had his hands full with a heavy broken sand jar at the time. Dave, the ex-P.I., visits Perry's office and says that Donna took the missing $20,000. Asked about his own whereabouts at the time of the murder, he says that he was discussing business with Arlene then. After he leaves, a dejected Perry tells Della that he'll just have to call Willard to testify about Daniel's mental incapacity, and hope for the best.

It's Burger who calls Willard, getting him to testify how the sanitarium visit ended with a writ of habeas corpus, effectively proving that Daniel was responsible for his actions. On cross, Perry asks him why, while supposedly working with family lawyer Metcalf for joint custody of Daniel's affairs with Arlene, he was also going behind her back with another lawyer to petition for sole guardianship. He doesn't have a good answer, so Perry asks him where he was at the time of the murder. Willard answers that he was at home with Arlene, but it turns out that Dave's claim that he was with Arlene at a nightspot is true, verified by the club's manager. Willard confesses to murdering Maury, claiming he thought Daniel would merely be put away somewhere rather than getting the gas chamber. His motive was a desperate desire to get away from Arlene and her constant nagging.

Back at the office, Tragg pulls apart Perry's phone, revealing a bug. He explains that he just learned of its existence. Dave planted it, then fed information to an eager beaver in Homicide in the hopes of getting his P.I. license back. Tragg promises that he won't. Perry mentions that it was Millie who shot Monty in Alaska, and Daniel was merely covering up for her. He also admits that his talk of having to call Willard as a witness was just an act for the D.A.'s benefit. Tragg suggests that Perry not invite Burger to his next performance."
