https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1585426/?ref_=ttep_ep14,,"A TV reporter accompanies a group of ATF agents on a raid of suspected gunrunners; on the deck they find the bodies of five civilian men, already dead, two of whom (career criminals) wear authentic uniforms of the US Marine Corps and bear counterfeit ID cards; Director Vance orders the Callen team to investigate. G and Sam find dead birds and squirrels; Eric and Kensi... Read all",[],TV-14,Release date,['Jonathan Frakes'],"['', '', '']",[],['false identity'],[],"A warehouse with five dead bodies, two of whom were apparently Marines, draws the attention of NCIS. The ""Marines"" were wearing authentic uniforms, but weren't Marines, so NCIS is intending to oversee the investigation to make sure there is no military connection. Sam and Callen visit the crime scene and find several other victims - animals surrounding the facility. When extensive tox reports come back, the cause of death is determined to be Botulinum poisoning. Botulinum is a deadly neurotoxin and bio-weapon.

Sam and Callen pursue their first lead, an elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer's (Esther) -- turns out she was a military chemist and she was approached by people she thought were Marines to help them isolate, purify and weaponize the toxin. Though her disease makes her an unreliable witness, the rote memory of her job has not been destroyed and she successfully produces enough biotoxin to kill millions of people.

Callen recognized one of the dead bodies as a former security guard for Dallas (from Breach, the strip club owner with high-powered connections) and through him, they discover that a weapons dealer named ""The Dutchman"" is holding an auction for the poison. Sam goes undercover as an interested buyer, he is armed with an arms resistant briefcase with a knife handle and an experimental antidote pen. He also has a button cam that can be turned on and off remotely. At the meeting, he discovers there's going to be a demonstration at the Beverly Center. When informed that he needed to stall for time, he comments about how it was ""stupid"" to have all of the extremists in the same room because they have beef with each other. This starts a fight that allows Sam to retrieve the toxin that was being sold.

Callen and Kensi race to the Beverly Center and manage to find the man with the neurotoxin a little help from Esther. The man with the neurotoxin is knocked down, but tips the toxin from floors above. Callen races and manages to catch the toxin before it hits the ground. However in the process his finger is cut and toxin gets in it. Sam tackles Callen into a fountain and injects him with an experimental antidote. He orders Callen to keep his hand under the water until hazmat arrives. In the end, everyone is safe and NCIS is billed for the dead fish in the fountain."

The Brothers Grimm, 1812



PORTLAND

A young woman, Sylvia Oster (Joy Flatz), is seen walking out of the double doors of a large building. Dressed in a red hooded sweatshirt, black cropped jogging bottoms and pink Nike running shoes she proceeds to insert earphones from her iPod before starting her jog, Sweet Dreams by The Eurythmics plays .

A weathered sign indicates the route of two trails, Talon Creek and Sweetbriar. Sylvia takes the Talon Creek trail, a dirt pathway in a densely wooded area. She stops when she sees a small Hummel figurine, of a girl, on a lichen covered log by the side of the trail. Looking around, and seeing no-one, Sylvia picks the figurine up, a look of consternation on her face as she gazes at it. Suddenly a dark unclear figure rushes in from the right bearing Sylvia away. Animal growling and fading, dying, screams are heard from off screen. The camera pans the moss covered trees in the surrounding area finally coming to rest on Sylvias still playing iPod which lies on the ground.

A busy city street. Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) is seen exiting a Jewellery store, a small box with an engagement ring held up in his left hand as he approaches his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) standing by their car. After some harmless banter and joking, where we find out Hank has been married four times while this will be Nicks first, they both turn to look at a pretty young blonde woman (Claire Coffee) who, coffee in hand, laughs and chats with another woman before proceeding on her way. Hank asks his friend ""Detective what are you looking at, you just bought a ring.."" Nick responds by giving Hank a description of what he sees ""She wears Armani, makes low six figures, drives a BMW and is falling for a senior partner at her law firm."" Hank ribs him for not just seeing a pretty young woman. As Hank turns away to get into the car Nick continues to watch the woman. Noticing his attention the woman smiles, then her face suddenly morphs into a grotesque vision, which Nick sees. The woman senses a change in Nicks demeanour and head down continues, unsmiling, on her way, while Nick looks on thoughtfully.

Nick and Hank walk down a wood lined pathway in company with a Forest Service Office (Burl Ross), who gives details pertaining to the discovery of the crime by a hiker. They stop, Nick kneeling to view a bloodied, fly covered, severed limb. The Forest Service Office informs them that ""the rest of her is off trail."" They proceed off to an area with fluorescent indicators scattered all around, and enquire as to how the officer knows the victim is a female. The Officer indicates a pink Nike running shoe. The officer tells the pair that normally they could recognize the animal which attacked, bear, cougar or wolf, by its tracks, however in this case it is interesting that the only track found is that of a boot. Nick shouts to the investigation teams that a cast be made of the imprint. Hank comments to the Officer that DNA would tell them whether ""this is your case or ours."" Retracing their steps Nick says to Hank that the case is reminiscent of one he heard occurring a month ago in Munson(?) Creek Falls. Hank agrees ""a hiker and a Bob cat"" to which Nick replies""except the Bob cat wasn't wearing boots."" Stopping suddenly Nick asks Hank if he hears music and proceeds outside the cordoned off area to find the joggers iPod, still playing Sweet Dreams, at the side of the path. He calls out his discovery to the investigators and then confirms the song playing for Hanks benefit.

Nick and Hank enter the Police station discussing what to do until they receive the DNA results; compiling a list of violent (human) predators in the area and getting more information on the Munson Creek Falls attack. Hank turns into a room leaving Nick to continue walking on down the corridor. Nick enters the main squad room and sees a seated, handcuffed angry young perp (Casey Vann) being processed by a colleague. The young man looks at Nick and his face changes, mouth widening and a forked tongue showing, he hisses at Nick. Nick, his attention looking at the perp in disbelief, collides with Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) who after a smart comment continues on his way.

A pale bald sick looking woman is seen behind the wheel of a vehicle as it makes its slow way down a tree lined suburban street. Looking in the direction of a well maintained house she turns down a road so she can access and park to the rear. Her vehicle is shown to be towing an old, although well maintained, travel Trailer. She gets out the car, and with the use of a stick, makes her way to the door where she peers into the lounge via the door window.

In the squad room Nick and Hank discuss the number, 25, of violent predators in a five mile radius of the crime scene, unfortunately none of them have MO's indicative of this crime. Replacing the phone Hank says they have a hit on the ID of the victim, Sylvia Oster, who went out jogging but did not return.

Standing outside, Nick and Hank take details of Sylvias disappearance from her friend (Tierra Valentine). They view a picture of the missing girl on her friends phone and confirm that she was wearing pink Nikes when she left for her run at 7.30am that morning.

Nick and Hank, back in the squad room, bring up Sylvias Oregon driving licence on the computer, confirming they now have a positive ID of the victim they decide to call it a day and go home. Nick picks up his jacket and the ring box falls out and is picked up by Hank who passes it back to him while commenting on Nicks ""Big night"".

Night time and Nick draws up in front of the house seen earlier. He exits the vehicle, stares at the house and then looks around and listens to the sounds of dogs yelping in the local area. He enters the house into a darkened hallway and calls out to Juliette Silverton (Elizabeth Tulloch), with whom he shares the home. Looking in the dining room he sees the bald woman seated at the table preparing vegetables, her back turned to him, it is his Aunt Marie Kessler (Kate Burton) whom he seems happy, but surprised, to see. Juliette states Aunt Marie was here when she got home and asks if Nick knew she was coming. Aunt Marie says she meant to call but that sometimes she forgets things and assumes she has done them. During a welcome hug Marie whispers to Nick ""We need to talk"".

Nick and Marie walk along the darkened street and discuss how long Marie has left to live, ""2 mths, 2 wks or 2 days, nobody knows"" she states. Marie says she has things to tell Nick about his family and then asks if he has been seeing strange things. Without being specific she comments that things are happening too fast, faster than she expected and that the family legacy is passing to him. That if he loves Juliette he must leave her as it is far too dangerous for Juliette to be around him. Suddenly Maries attention is drawn to a parked car and she announces that ""He is here - Hulda"" (Danny Hernandez). A humanoid creature carrying a scythe jumps out and battle ensues. Despite her illness Marie does her best to defeat the creature however it is finally killed when Nick shoots it. The dead creature reverts to its human physique.

Nick kneels by Marie at the Kerb, she asks if the Hulda is dead and confirms that 'they' had been following her and she thought she had lost them before coming to Nicks. She takes a decorative green locket on a chain from around her neck and gives it to Nick telling him to never lose it and to guard it with his life, that 'they' would be looking for it. Before losing consciousness she tells Nick that his parents did not die in a crash but were killed.

Marie is seen on a stretcher being loaded onto an ambulance, while Juliette looks on. Nick explains the attack to Hank but does not mention that Hulda was a creature at the time. Hank leaves to run Huldas prints and make further enquiries. Nick travels in the ambulance to the hospital with Marie after saying goodbye to Juliette.

Nick sits on a chair outside Maries room sketching the face of the creature he killed before being called in by Dr Rose (Ayanna Berkshire) when Marie regains consciousness. Surrounded by machines Marie holds Nicks hand and confirms that Nick saw the Hulda in his creature form. She explains that as the creatures lose control 'we' have the ability to see what they really are. That fairytales are real and that what the brothers Grimm wrote about aren't just tales, but very real. Nick is one of the last Grimms and he is vulnerable now. She wishes she had more time but everything is in her trailer. Nick asks about his parents but does not receive any answers as Dr Rose asks him to leave while confirming that he can see his Aunt tomorrow. Walking down the hospital corridor he takes out the green locket and examines it, and discovers it is in fact a key.

Nick returns to the squad room and examines the inscribed blade of the scythe; he has flashbacks to the Hulda creature and the perp creature he had seen earlier. Hank comes in, asking if Nick has had the scythe translated and Nick confirms that it says ""Reapers of the Grimms"".

Walking down the station stairs Hank confirms that Huldas prints connect him to several violent assaults and deaths in various States; Florida, Alabama as well as Chicago. Passing them on the stairs Sgt. Wu tells Nick that Cpt. Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz) wants to see him.

Capt. Renard confirms that if Nick had to shoot anyone he picked the right one. He asks how Nick is holding up after his first shooting and advises him that after an incident of this nature he is required to speak to a Police Psychologist, and after confirming that Nick will do so tells Nick to take care of himself before leaving.

A dark misty forest, a woman in a long red silk dress runs in slow motion. It is Juliette, she stops and turns with a look of fear on her face. A close up of the Huldas face as it hisses.

Nick sits up suddenly in bed, Juliette sleeping beside him. Woken by the dream he looks out the bedroom window to the trailer.

Using a torch Nick enters the trailer and looks around seeing a table, chair and various pieces of equipment as well as books and herbs. The trailer has obviously been redesigned for storage and study rather than living in. He looks at the strange green key in his hand, obviously intent on finding the lock to which it fits. Drawings are pinned to ceiling and walls, map charts are rolled, various pieces of scientific equipment are scattered around on surrounding surfaces. Nick opens a cupboard to reveal various antiquated weapons; swords, maces, axes, bows, daggers, axes etc. some unrecognizable. He closes the cupboard then seats himself at the table where a large book lies open. He flicks through the pages which show medallion diagrams, sketches of creatures and old photographs until he comes to a picture of a 'Hag' and is reminded of the young blonde woman he saw earlier. He hears a noise and raises the torch to dazzle Juliette who has followed him down. He quickly ushers Juliette out of the trailer and when asked says he couldn't sleep and will deal with the strange trailer later. Nick explains that he was brought up by Marie after the death of his parents, from age 12. That he knew nothing about the trailer. They hear a cat and looking around see nothing, re-entering the house. They are seen from an overlooking point between the trees; a strange animal sound is heard.

Hank walks down a station corridor, talking on the phone ""This is what we're looking for; if its an exact match of the boot prints its going to be very helpful."". Nick intercepts him as he finishes the call and informs him that the DNA results of the attacker are inconclusive and that they still don't know if they are looking for man or beast. Hank shows Nick a picture of the type of boot which matches the plaster cast taken at the scene.

A pair of feet, encased in boots similar to those from the picture, below blue trousers walk down a wet sidewalk. The back of a man is shown, Blue jacket, cap and brown satchel, as he places a brown envelope in a mail box, 7122. He continues to walk down the sidewalk, passing a young girl walking in the opposite direction. The girl is wearing red hoodie, purple leggings and has a pink and purple backpack. The mailman pauses, turns, and proceeds to follow the young girl, his face remaining hidden from the view.

Nick, at the hospital, is informed by Dr Rose that Marie remains in a deep coma. She enquires if Nick knew about the scars, from knife wounds, that cover Maries body, he did not, and confirms that she was a librarian. Nick answers his phone then rushes from the room.

A suburban street where police cars are parked and officers walk around. On the porch of a house Mrs Howell ([link-=nm2365770]) sobs and explains to Sgt Wu that her daughter Robin (Sophia Mitri Schloss) was supposed to go to her grandfathers house directly after school. The grandfather (Mark Lewis) explains that she never turned up and after checking the neighbourhood decided they should alert the police. Sgt Wu turns, intercepts Nick and Hank as they arrive, and updates them. Sgt Wu says he will check out the grandfather and then hands them a photograph of Robin.

Capt. Renard briefs detectives on the case, an enlarged projected picture of Robin behind him. The projected image changes to the route she would take to the grandfathers house. The Point A to Point B route goes around a green area, with many paths, identified as Berkeley Park. Capt. Renard instructs that alternate routes should be checked and then gives a description of her clothing at which point Nick turns to look at Hank. Nick and Hank speak to Renard as the meeting adjourns and the other officers leave. They point out to Renard that the jogger also wore a red hoodie. Renard hopes that it isn't the same guy, given the type of death the student suffered.

A white van with red and blue stripes drives down a leaf covered road. Nick and Hank walk down a road and discuss Robins route. Hank points out that while Mrs Howell may have been specific about the route, children did not always follow the rules and it would be natural for a child to take the shorter, more direct, route across the park.

Nick and Hank enter the wooded park, at a route marker they split up. Nick takes the Hollyberry Trail and Hank the Mill Pond. Nick is nervous as he walks the path, turning at every sound and remembering Maries words ""You need to be careful...you're vulnerable now...this isn't a fairytale"". Hank spots a pink and purple backpack discarded and partially hidden by a large fern and calls to Nick, who rushes over. The backpack bears the initials RH, Robin Howell. Nick starts to search around as Hank reports the crime scene by phone. Nick quickly finds a boot print, and calls to Hank, then swiftly begins to follow boot prints through the overgrown wood, off-trail. Eventually he arrives at a street. A man emerges from the small house directly opposite, a yellow VW beetle parked in its drive. The man opens and removes mail from his box as three children riding bikes pass him on the sidewalk. The man turns to look after the children, his eyes turn red, his ears elongate and turn pointed as his face sprouts hair. He sniffs the air then turns and sees Nick in the wood, shows pointed uneven teeth and growls in his direction. Nick stops and stares intently before calling ""Hank, I got him!"" The man shakes off the visage and bolts for his house as first Nick and then Hank follow. Nick chases him inside, grabs and then pushes him down shouting ""Where is she? Where is she?""

Outside the house various police cars and officers are seen. Nick and Hank are in the lounge along with Sgt Wu who is searching for evidence, and finding nothing. Hank escorts Nick out onto the porch, pulling him by the arm. Hank asks what they are doing and what Nick sees about the man that no-one else does as he has no priors and is clean. The man, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) is seen sitting in the rear of a police car. Nick says he fits the profile ""he's a loner, never been married and lives across the street from the park"". Hank points out that without evidence that won't get the man into court unless he sues them. Hank walks away as Nick returns the stare of Monroe, still seated in the back of the car.

Juliette looks down from the bedroom window onto the trailer which is lit from within by a torch. Nick is seen sitting at the table flicking through pages of the large book, finally stopping at a sketch resembling Monroes creature form.

A lamp lit window, through which Monroe can be seen eating while he stands. Nick positioned opposite stares intently. Nick receives a call from Juliette which he ignores when he sees Monroe exiting the house and walking to the rear of the property where he relieves himself at various points along the fence. Nick, having followed, watches him from the opposite side of the building. Monroe turns slightly and sniffs the air before returning to the house. Nick turns to retrace his foot steps, the lights go off inside the house. Nick sneaks below the window. The glass smashes as Monroe in his creature form attacks Nick, stands, and then tells him he ""shouldn't have come back"" before shaking his head and reverting to human appearance. Nick starts to reach for something at his side, before Monroe good naturedly tells Nick to ""lighten up, I'm just making a point"" and then proceeds to invite Nick in for a brew while telling him he is paying for the broken window. Monroe then turns away, leaving Nick to follow.

Inside the house Monroe passes Nick a bottle of beer while commenting, and peering closely into Nicks face. that he had ""never thought to see one of you before..a Grimm. Well whatd'ya know"". Nick is surprised and asks for further information. Monroe tells of how he was scared, as a kid, by stories told to him by his mother of the Grimms. Then wonders aloud how long Nick has been at this as he seems 'kinda new to it'. When Nick asks what he knows the man says that someone in Nicks family must have just died which would explain it. Nick mentions the comatose Marie Kessler and Monroe looks serious having heard of her and then turns away saying he doesn't want any trouble, that he is a Blutbad, but hasn't killed in years. A Blutbad being the big bad wolf. Monroe knows about the books as do all the Wessen or creatures, the Grimms having been profiling the Wessen for over 200 yrs. He stays good through a strict regimen of diet, drugs and palates. He is a ""reformed Blutbad, a weiner Blutbad, a different church altogether."". Monroe informs Nick that he can't stop from being a Grimm, it is who he is. Nick explains that the only reason he is at Monroes is because he is still looking for Robin, and Monroe tells Nick he is not aware of where she is. That Blutbaden (pl.) don't socialize much; as bad things happen when a pack gets together, especially when they see the colour red. That he is a clockmaker and he was marking his territory when pissing against the fence. Nick elicits the information that Monroe knows of other Blutbaden in the area, that he knows who took Robin and that Monroe had better help him find her. Monroe warns Nick not to threaten him but maintains his control when Nick physically pushes and holds him against a wall.

A dark river flows beneath a wooden bridge in a forest. A VW Campervan is seen driving across the bridge before stopping in front of a small solitary cottage covered in moss, a light glows on the porch. The driver gets out, it is the postman. Going to the rear of the campervan he removes a large sack which he carries into the cottage, the whimpering of a child is heard. Inside the cottage the postman passes a shelf on which stands the Hummel figurine of the little girl. The postman places the sack on the floor, it wriggles, he moves a coffee table, lifts the rug and opens a trap door hidden beneath. His feet and lower legs are seen as they descend some well worn wooden steps. He empties the sack onto a pretty, linen covered, four-poster bed. Robin tumbles from the sack and then quickly scoots to the head of the bed, her arms wrapped around her knees. The postmans face is now seen (Tim Bagley), an average middle aged and harmless looking man. Robin asks to go home and the postman tells her she is home and offers to take and hang up her hoodie. Frightened Robin lets him, and he is seen placing it on a hanger in a small wardrobe where several similar red hoodies hang. He asks if Robin would like a chicken pot pie, to which she shakes her head as a negative, before he runs up the stairs and slams the trapdoor shut, leaving Robin rocking back and forth in the light of a bedside lamp.

A Yellow VW Beetle is seen driving erratically and at speed along a darkened forest track. Monroe, driving, hangs partially out the window as he casts around for the postmans scent. Nick offers to drive but Monroe continues on. Monroe tells Nick that if the Blutbad had fed the day before then he is good for a week, maybe 10 days tops, giving him time to fatten Robin up. Monroe suddenly picks up the scent and says they are really close, and re-seats himself within the vehicle.

Inside the cottage the postman looks closely at his boots, covered in mud. He looks around, stands and moves off screen.

The Beetle is seen to stop in the middle of the wooden bridge, above the river, a Dead End sign caught in its headlights. Monroe removes the keys and indicates that this is as far as they can go by car, before both he and Nick get out. Monroe brings out a packet of wolfsbane which he proceeds to smear on his clothing indicating that Nick should do the same if he wants to stay alive. Nick starts to head the rest of the way across the bridge but Monroe calls him back and heads in the opposite direction, they must go a less obvious route. They go down the bank into the river and then walk closer to the cottage. Monroe starts to change into his Blutbad visage but fights it. On seeing the cottage Monroe changes fully, but again is able to maintain his control and revert back to his human physique. He tells Nick that he cannot go any further as he can't guarantee what will happen, he could be on Nicks side but on the other hand he could join with the other Blutbad or even go after the girl. Monroe then leaves returning back the way they came. Nick remains and looks toward the cottage.

Hank is awoken by his phone ringing. Nick informs him he has found the girl.

The postman is seen standing in front of a roaring fire before turning, sniffing the air, and making his way to the window where he looks out onto the dark moonlit forest. A knocking sound is heard, and looking toward the coffee table the postman sees the vase of flowers moving. The postman opens the trapdoor to see Robin who asks to go home and he again tells her that she is home before slamming the trapdoor shut.

Nick stands on the bridge by the Dead End sign as Hank arrives in his car and gets out. There is no sign of Monroes vehicle. After telling Hank where the cottage is Nick smears Hank with wolfsbane and tells him it is so he won't be smelled. Hank tells him they aren't hunting deer and asks about their backup. Nick admits that he, Hank, is the only one he called. Having already cried wolf once he doesn't believe anyone will take him seriously. Nick takes Hank via the same route he was shown by Monroe, down the bank and across the stream. Nick is vague with information when asked by Hank how he found the place, saying it was something to do with the boots, this was one of the addresses and that he has forgotten the owners name. They come to the edge of the woods and view the well lit cottage, with its now smoking chimney. Nick is still waiting for details on the vehicles plates. Hank tells him he better not be wrong this time, and Nick asks for his trust.

Inside the extremely neat and tidy cottage the postman is seen replacing the rug and coffee table. Standing up he sniffs the air and turns in the direction of the door. Nicks hand is seen using the knocker. The postman opens the door and greets them asking if he can help them. Hank and Nick look down at the mocassin type slippers on the postmans feet, then Hank introduces them and asks if the postman has a few minutes. The postman invites them in and they enter the lounge and look around. Hank picks up a cushion and the postman admits to having done the needlepoint himself. A kitchen timer rings and the postman excuses himself so he can go and remove a pot pie from the oven, before they talk. The postman appears so harmless and unimposing that Hank finds it hard to comprehend that Nick can be serious in believing he is guilty. Nick confirms he does.

Hank follows the postman into the kitchen trailed by Nick. The postman is seen taking the pie out of the oven then placing it on the counter and taking a deep sniff, his eyes momentarily turning blood red. He turns to the pair with a smile and apologizes for taking so long. Hank asks what the postman does and then what he was doing when Robin went missing. He tells them he was on his round and asks why they are asking. Nick shows him a picture of Robin and the postman expresses false dismay at hearing what has happened and hopes they don't believe he had anything to do with it. Hank says they have to explore every possibility, the boots being the main one, and the postman gives them permission to search anywhere they want, the boots having been destroyed on the fire.

Nick is seen opening the wardrobe of the bedroom, he looks at the clothes neatly folded and the shoes on their racks. There are no boots of any type. From the doorway Hank tells Nick that if the postman had anything to hide he would have kicked them out, that he is leaving as he wants to keep his job. To the sounds of the postmans humming Nick follows Hank out the bedroom, down a short hall to the lounge where the postman asks if he can offer any further help. Hank leaves as does Nick, after a final backward glance toward the postman.

Outside Nick follows an angry Hank, apologizing as he does so, because he truly believed he was correct, he is quickly cut off by Hank as he swiftly turns round to face Nick. ""The song. He was humming the same song"". says Hank ""The one on the dead girls iPod"". They both turn to see they are being observed from the window by the postman, who suddenly turns away out of sight. The lights in the cabin are suddenly extinguished. Nick and Hank rush toward the door.

Entering the doorway, with weapons drawn, the two detectives quickly fan out and use torches to look for the postman. Hank is knocked over by the postman who then proceeds to attack Nick in his Blutbad form, unseen by Hank, before making his escape through the open cottage door. Hank having recovered shoots the postman four times in the back. The Blutbad is seen falling to the ground, once again changing into the form of the human postman. Nick turns him over and asks ""Where is she? Where is she?"" to which the postmans final word of reply is ""Grimm"", before he dies.

Nick and Hank re-enter the cottage shouting Robins name throughout the rooms. Hank leaves to 'call it in' but goes to find the electricity breaker first. Nick looks around the lounge at the mess caused by the struggle and notices water from a toppled vase seeping through the floor boards. Squatting down he hears muffled sounds so lifts the rug to find the trap door. He opens it and calls out to Hank as he descends the stairs to find Robin bound and gagged on the bed. Nick unbinds Robin and tells her they are the police. Robin wraps her arms around Nicks neck, is hugged in return, and is told she is safe, while Hank looks on from the stairs. Nick turns to face Hank as his partner says ""I don't know how you did it, but you did."" and holsters his weapon. Nick tells Robin they are going to take her home.

Nick sits at the side of Maries hospital bed talking to her as he holds her hand. Marie, still comatose, has respirator tubes attached and lines running from her arms. Nick tells Marie that there are many things he doesn't understand and things he needs to ask her. He loves Juliette and doesn't want anything to happen to her. A doctor is seen entering the room and moving to the other side of a bed. A syringe of liquid is seen being prepared as Nick looks up and recognizes the Doctor as being the young blonde woman he saw earlier. He prevents her from administering the drug to Marie but is accidently injected with it during the struggle. Falling to the floor, into unconsciousness, Nick sees the young woman fleetingly change to the visage of the Hag as she exits the room.

The young woman is seen exiting the hospital via the employee entrance, removing her white doctors coat as she does so. Lightning flashes overhead as she gets into a black SUV driven by Capt. Renard. On hearing that the blonde was unsuccessful at killing Marie because of Nicks interference Renard says it is ""unfortunate, but we will just have to try again, and hope that Marie does not wake up first."" The car drives off down a wet street.

Marie is shown opening her eyes, as she wakes from her coma."

and then peeped through the

keyhole;

seeing nobody in the house,

she lifted the latch.



The camera pans through darkened woods, coming to rest on an extensive, palatial, wooded house all in darkness. Two figures, breathing heavily, dash across the lawn in front of the building toward the front door. The glass of the door window is smashed by an elbow allowing a hand to gain entry to unlock it. A dark haired man and a blonde woman enter with flashlights in hand. Checking the area the couple turn to their right down a passageway. The camera comes to rest on a the wooden carved animal head of the banister.

The couple, Gilda Darner (Amy Gumenick) and Rocky Babb (Alexander Mendeluk) enter an expensive and beautiful kitchen. Gilda exclaims in awe and asks ""why weren't we born rich?"" as she opens the door to the refrigerator and views the shelves stocked with various luxury foods.""Because our parents didn't have any money."" replies Rocky as he selects an expensive bottle of wine from the well stocked shelves.

Gilda and Rocky, now dressed in the house owners clothes, drink wine and joke about going on their yacht, while standing in the main lounge with a roaring fire behind them. Finally they throw their empty wine glasses into the fire. Gilda runs up the stairs laughing as Rocky follows. They emerge into a bedroom the walls and shelves decorated with frightening looking masks and primitive pottery. The couple fall onto the single bed entwined. Gilda gets up and leaves. Rocky again follows Gilda to an expensive and tastefully decorated bedroom where he falls backwards onto the bed calling out to Gilda. Gilda appears, dressed in a rich luxurious fur coat and hat. She opens the coat to reveal she has only pink underwear on beneath, before diving on top of Rocky.

The, now lit, house is shown, a carved bestial totem pole is picked out in the headlights of a vehicle. An SUV with multiple spot lights and a dead deer tied to its hood makes its way up the drive to stop before the house.

Gilda sits up in bed on hearing the vehicle arrive. Rocky cuddles her, sure she has made a mistake. Gilda insists he check from the window. Looking down from the window he spots the SUV, and they rush to get dressed and leave the house before they are discovered. Gilda indicates they should go out the window rather than use the staircase and proceeds onto a small balcony, over the rail to land in a heap on the ground. As Gilda tells Rocky to ""hurry up"", he is suddenly pulled backwards into the room while Gilda looks on. Sounds of fighting and cries of pain are heard as shadows of a fight are seen on the bedroom ceiling. The sounds of fighting and pain follow Gilda as she runs across the lawn to the pickup they arrived in. Growling animal sounds are heard and an indistinct figure chases after her. Gilda gets in the vehicle, guns the engine and races down the road away from the house.

A Doctor (Eric Schniewind), holding medical paperwork, enters a room where Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) sits on the end of an examination bed. He proceeds to tell Nick that his results show he has an enzyme in his blood stream normally associated with spider bites and that luckily he did not get a higher dose as it would have paralyzed his lungs and that should he feel unwell he should return to the hospital.

Walking down the hospital corridor Nick tells Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) that a few toxins were found in his blood and that he will be okay. They proceed to Marie Kesslers (Kate Burton) room and are informed by Dr Rose (Ayanna Berkshire) that they need to stabilize Marie as they can't afford for her to fall back into a coma and that Nick should visit again in the morning. Marie looks at Nick from her bed, her eyes closing. Capt. Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz) joins Nick as he looks into Maries room and confirms the details of the attack on Marie and Nick. Hank confirms that he has the security tapes, which are on the way to the precinct, in hopes of identifying their assailant. Cpt. Renard and Hank walk away leaving Nick to follow.

A video tape of hospital corridors and rooms is being played, split screen. Nick is seen entering his Aunt Maries room. Cpt. Renard viewing the tapes asks details of the last time Nick saw his Aunt. Nick says a couple of years and doesn't know what she has been up to. Cutting back to the video we see a young blonde woman (Claire Coffee) in a doctors white coat entering Maries room. Nick stands and confirms that she is the assailant. The woman is seen from the back so recognition is impossible and Renard leaves. Hank queries what Marie could have done to piss of so many people. They are interrupted by an officer (Rich Cashin) informing them that he has stopped a DUI on the highway who has a weird story about her boyfriend being attacked. Her name is Gilda Darner. Nick and Hank scoot their seats backward so they can see the woman seated at a desk in the main squad room. Nick gives a description of what he sees to Hank ""Grown up way too fast, single parent if she has any, takes way too many chances and looks for excitement in all the wrong places."". Hank and Nick then rise and approach Gilda.

Daylight, Nick and Hank, with Gilda in the back of the car draw up to the previously seen house, Gilda confirming it is the correct one. A squad car is parked, the two officers standing on the porch. The pair are met by Sgt Wu (Reggie Lee) who advances from the porch asking what they are doing there as he had not called it in yet. He gives details of a breaking and entering, reported by the house owners Mr and Mrs Rabe who had returned from Seattle 2 hours previously. The fridge was raided, wine drunk, clothes worn and a couple of beds tested. There are no signs of violence; no blood and no body parts. Hank, Nick and Wu walk around the house to the door with the broken window while telling Wu they are trying to confirm how much of Gildas story is true. They agree she is ""copping to the B&E"" so some of the story is.

Upstairs Diane Rabe {Jodie Harwood) and her husband Frank Rabe (Currie Graham) confirm someone having slept in their bed, that they have an alarm system but have been lax in using it due to the house being somewhat remote and never having had a problem before. Looking out the window Nick notices some scratch marks on the inner window frame when Wu tells him he should see the living room.

Nick examines a coffee table in the lounge; scattered food and empty bottles litter its surface. Frank confirms that they haven't had a chance to check for any thefts, although nothing obvious has been taken. Hank comments on and shows knowledge of the couples collection of rare and expensive aboriginal art, including glass covered weapons. He points out one item he has never encountered before, a paw shaped weapon with bone claws, leather wrapped grip and carved bear shape at the end, which Diane explains as ""Germanic, very rare, dating from circa 900 AD"". She further explains that they are ""members of organizations which protect native lands from development. There is a lot of rich cultural heritage disappearing and we are trying to protect what's left both locally and globally."" She is interrupted by Frank who believes that they are getting sidetracked. Diane agrees but says the you have to respect your ancestors, to which Hank agrees. Nick during this time has been looking around the other various tribal masks and statues on display in the room finally taking a closer, extended, look at the clawed club, during which he confirms who else had access to the house while they were away; cleaning crew, son Barry who was staying with friends and some neighbours who check on their house when they are away.

Leaving the house Hank tells Nick his second wife was an anthropologist. Gilda watches from the back of the car as they approach. They agree two people were in the house but there is no sign of Gildas boyfriend, who Hank believes is probably at home sleeping it off.

A darkened cave. A fire burning, the light flickers off the walls. Rocky is shown tied up with a blindfold on at the back of the cave. Growling animal sounds can be heard. A heavily furred creature approaches Rocky, scratches his cheek with its claws then sniffs his face. The screen darkens and scream is heard.

Back at the station and Nick and Hank question Gilda about the events of the night before, going over her statement of events. Gilda cries as she admits it is her fault, that she left him (Rocky) there and that she should have gone back for him. She begs Nick to do something. Sgt Wu taps on the glass of the interview room beckoning Hank who then leaves. Nick offers Gilda a handkerchief and takes the opportunity, during Hanks absence, to ask Gilda about the animal chasing her the previous night. She has no idea, she was scared and just wanted to escape so took no time to look around at her pursuer. Nick looks on as she continues to cry, and tells him she knows something terrible happened to Rocky.

On the station stairs Nick joins Hank and Wu. Rocky is not at home and his father, a truck driver, hasn't seen him since he arrived home two days ago. Rocky no longer has a cell phone, as they were cutting back on expenses. The father says that find his pickup and that is where the son will be. Nick confirms the vehicle has been impounded as Gilda was driving it when she was arrested. Wu leaves after telling them that is all the information he has on Rocky. Hank theorizes that possibly the party got out of hand...Rocky got hurt...he fell down the stairs or Gilda pushed him...he broke his neck...Gilda got scared...pushed his body in a river or the woods and now she is trying to make out she is innocent. Nick doesn't agree with Hanks scenario and believes Gilda is not trying to cover up but is pushing them to find him. Nick believes they should take another look at the house they broke into. Nicks phone rings and it is Marie who tells Nick that she needs to see him now.

Dr Rose tells Nick that Marie is very weak and that she may not have much time left. Two police officers guard Maries room as Nick enters, sits and takes her hand. He says how afraid he was that he had nearly lost her as she is the only family he has left, to which Marie replies Not yet. She tries to reassure Nick that he will be alright despite the confusion he feels with everything that is happening to him and the things he sees. She tells him to be strong and not doubt himself. That he has a responsibility that he cannot ignore to ""hunt down the bad ones"" as his ancestors did before him. She tells him the Reapers followed her here and that there could be more, their numbers are unknown. The Reapers are a secret organization dedicated to killing the Grimms. Nick now knows that he is not the only Grimm in the world however Marie does not have contact with them. Marie warns that there are more creatures in the books than she has ever seen and that he must keep the trailer a secret as they don't know about it. Dr Rose rushes in and asks Nick to leave as Marie show signs of agonizing pain.

In the hospital car park Hank asks after Marie to be told that ""Shes dying of cancer and had two attempts made on her life, apart from that she is doing alright."" They get in the car and Hank comments that she is a tough old lady. Nick then enquires about the Rabe residence. Hank informs him that their house sits on 200 acres and backs up onto a national forest which is 500 miles of trees behind them and lots of places for Rocky to get lost. Hank starts the car.

The car Nick and Hank are travelling in drives a meandering, forested, road. Suddenly three off-road motorcycles crash out of the woods onto the road in front of them. Hank punches the breaks then eases on down the road as the motorcyclists perform wheelies in front of them. Eventually everyone parks outside the Rabe residence. Nick and Hank approach the tree youths on the bikes, criticizing their driving and pointing out that they could have caused an accident. The youths turns out to be Barry Rabe (Parker Bagley), Jason Colbert (Robbie Clark) and T.B. Colbert (Ethan Atkinson). Hank shows the boys pictures of Gilda and Rocky but they deny ever having seen them, even in school. Diane Rabe then calls the boys in for Dinner and tells them to go and wash up. Diane then asks Hank and Nick if they have found out who broke into her house. Nick confirms that they have and Diane calls Frank out. Hank passes Diane the photos, as Frank arrives, and they both look at the images but deny ever having seen Gilda or Rocky. Nick then enquires of Barry if he happened to come home last night, to which Diane replies that he was staying over at Jason and TBs house. Hank tells her they have to ask just in case he saw the boy (Rocky) leave. Barry tells them that he didn't get back until this morning after his parents arrived back. Suddenly his face morphs into a thickly haired creature similar to a bear, then quickly changes back to human. Nick gulps on viewing the change. Frank Rabe notices Nicks sudden apprehension. Hank asks where the Colberts live and is swiftly interrupted by Frank asking why they need to know, and the reason for their questions. Nick tells him that they are trying to figure out where everyone was the previous night. Hank telling them that they know the two in the pictures broke into the house but that no-one had seen Rocky since. Nick gives them an account of Rockys last minutes and Diane interjects that rather than believe Gildas story Nick and Hank should remember that she and her family are the victims. Diane then ushers the boys into the house. Frank tells Nick and hank that if they want to speak to him they can call him at his law firm, before he turns and enters the house. Hank comments that they really hit a nerve with their questioning. Frank is seen peering out at them as they stand by their car. Nick tells Hank they should run down some phone records so that they can pin down where everyone was the previous night. Hank gets in the car while Nick stares at the bestial totem pole.

A blonde woman approaches an SUV which is parked below a freeway. Standing by the driver window Cpt. Renard tells her that Marie has awakened from her coma, and that she now has police guards. The woman (Claire Coffee) asks Renard what he wants her to do about the situation. Renard says that ""We cant allow her (Marie) to tell him(Nick) anything more, we need him with us."". Renard instructs the woman not to take care of it personally but to find the right people (human) to do the job of getting rid of Marie, as they can't take the chance of the excitement blowing the attackers cover should they change in front of Marie. Suddenly a young thug (Jake Street) bangs a metal bar on a trash can and asks the woman and Renard if they know that this is a bad neighbourhood asking how much they will pay not to get hurt. The woman turns to him with a smile and tells Renard she will take care of this situation, as she proceeds toward the thug. The womans face changes into that of a Hag and screams are heard from the thug after she has walked off screen and Renard looks on.

At home Nick is looking at Animal Totem Poles and figures on his computer screen as Juliette calls his name. She has brought home Chinese food and voodoo doughnuts. She admonishes him when he tries to take one as they are for dessert. Looking at the computer screen Juliette asks if they are buying a totem pole. Nick tells her he was just curious having seen one outside the house of a case he is working on. Juliette proceeds to read from the screen, as Nick brushes hair from her face ""Some kind of clan of the bear. The bear is the messenger to the supernatural world, his position of dominance in the totemic hierarchy is the result of a common ancestorial belief in the sanctity of their territory."" Juliette discusses her visit to the hospital to see Marie, the police guards and that she can't even die in peace. She asks how Nick is doing but isn't convinced by his happy manner.

Barry, Jason and TB enter the clearing of a densely wooded area. TB and Jason carry flaming wood torches; a clothed body appears to be slung over Barrys shoulder. Barry throws the body forward and it is seen to be a clothed mock-up now impaled on sharp wooden stakes within a dug out pit.

Nick is seen sitting at the trailer table, sketching the figure at the top of the Rabes totem pole. The door to the trailer opens and Marie enters, still wearing her hospital gown as Nicks look on in disbelief. She moves to the table and gazes down at the sketch and comments A bit more red. She moves to a cupboard containing various antiquated weaponry; swords, axes, daggers etc. and takes out dagger. Moving to the table she says ""When the sun goes down."" then stabs Nick through the left had pinning him to the table.

Nick sits up in bed with a gasp, having awoken from the dream. Juliette asks if he is okay. He responds by telling her it was just a bad dream and then continues with the details. Looking at his hand there is no sign of injury. Juliette says even she couldn't interpret that dream. She is leaving early for work as she has a Bulldog to operate on at 7 am.

Nick enters the trailer then turns to look around and examine some of the strange items on display. He opens the weapon cupboard and removes a paw shaped weapon similar to the one he had seen at the Rabe residence. He hears Maries words ""You have to hunt down the bad ones."" then has a flash of Barrys morphing face.

Eddie Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) is seen using an exercise machine. He hears a knock at his door and turns to look at a clock; 6.28 am. He resumes his exercise but the door is knocked again and he gets up to answer it with a sigh. Nick is standing on the doorstep. He tells Monroe they have to talk to which Monroe replies ""Not at 6.30 in the morning we don't."" and then tries to close the door. Nick forces his way in a brown bag held in his arms. Monroe makes some sarcastic remarks about coffee, bagels etc. Nick thanks him for his help on his previous case which involved a Blutbad, and hands him the bag asking if he has ever seen the item it contains, the paw weapon. He tells Nick that he hasn't seen one up close as Jägerbars use them for disembowelling. Nick asks Monroe if he has any information on Jägerbars. Monroe does not take kindly to Nick comparing Blutbaden, of which he is one, with Jägerbars. Nick explains that the weapon belongs to Marie at which point Monroe tells Nick he has had nothing but nightmares for the last two nights thinking Marie was coming to cut off his head. Nick tells him Marie is still in the hospital. Monroe then goes on to tell Nick about the weapon; it is used in the roh-hatz which is a form of bar mitzvah for Jägerbar involving a lot of pounding of chests and wailing which is supposed to connect with the primitive beast in everyone including humans. Monroe mentions a chase which involves camping out etc. at which point Nick leaves in a hurry.

Sitting beside Maries bed Nick is seen sketching the head of a Jägerbar. Marie in the bed behind him wears an oxygen mask. Marie recognizes the drawing as a Jägerbar and asks if Nick has seen one. Nick confirms that he has met a family but that the boy, Barry, is the only one he saw transform. Marie asks the boys age and is told he is 18. Marie says that it could be a problem if they are traditional and asks if anyone died. Nick tells her there is no death but he has got a missing person. She tells him that the roh-hatz is a right of passage, from boy to man, and that it isn't pretty and occurs at sunset.

Nick enters the squad room where Hank informs him they have the phone records and have triangulated several of them including those of Barry Rabe which puts him at the family home at 11.30 pm on the night that Rocky went missing. Barry is therefore lying and dad as a lawyer is running interference. Cpt. Renard then approaches and tells Nick that he had to remove the police guarding Marie at the hospital as he couldn't prove the second attack so wasn't able to justify the expense to the chief etc.

Monroe is seen repairing a clock when his phone rings and he hesitantly answers it and asks Now what?.

At the hospital Monroe tells Nick that he must be out of his mind asking him to guard a Grimm given that he is a Blutbad. Nick tells him it is only for a short period until he can figure something else out. After a little arguing Monroe finally agrees to help although he is not a cop and he was stupid to ever speak to Nick. Nick tells Monroe that he trusts him. After leaving Monroe says quietly that ""maybe he shouldn't.""

Hank calls Nick to let him know that Gilda had made bail, went over to Rockys dads house, took a gun and told the father that she would get Rocky back or kill the people who took him.

Gilda drives up to the Rabe residence, gets out and threatens Diane with the gun asking where Rocky is. Diane says she knows nothing about Rocky and pleads with Gilda not to hurt her. Suddenly Barry in his Jägerbar form attacks and disables Gilda. Diane then says ""Well done son. Hunting two is better than one, you make your ancestors proud."" She then moves over and kicks Gilda in the head as she starts to regain consciousness while Instructing Barry to get rid of her pickup.

Frank arrives home and greets his wife who is pruning roses. She tells him that Barry is out with friends, riding their bikes. Nick and Hank arrive and inform Frank and Diane that Gilda is on her way to their house with a gun. Looking around Hank determines that she hasn't arrived yet and on the way to the car tells them he will block off the road in case she arrives. Nick then tells Diane and Frank that they need to talk now as he knows what they are and they know what he is. Frank says that he knows that Nick is a Grimm and a danger to his family, that wearing a badge won't protect him. Nick tells him that it isn't about his being a Grimm and then goes on to look at Diane and say he knows about the hunt, Frank wonders what he is talking about. And exclaims that no-one does the roh-hatz any more looking at Diane in with genuine disbelief. Looking at his wife Frank suddenly realizes that what Nick is saying is the truth. He asks Diane where the boys are, but she refuses to answer instead telling Frank to ask to see Nicks Warrant before walking off into the house. Frank exclaims that he had no idea. Nick invites Frank to help him find them before it is too late to which Frank agrees exclaiming that they will need to take his 4 wheeler. Both men head off as Diane watches from the doorway. In the vehicle Frank asks Nick not to hurt the boys should they find them. Nick tells him he won't if he doesn't have to.

Frank is seen blocking the road and requesting backup. He notices a grassed lane and walks down to investigate and finding Gildas hidden Vehicle. A call from Nick and he confirms that Gilda has already arrived. Nick tells him he is with Frank and they are going to get the boys.

Inside the cave Gilda is heard sobbing. Both she and Rocky are bound and blindfolded. The three bare chested and tattooed boys drag Rocky to his feet and tear off his t-shirt. Barry cuts his own arm and smears the blood on Rockys face. Rocky begs them to let Gilda go. The boys inform him that they will, and she will even be given a head start as will he.

Monroe paces outside Maries room, finally entering. He speaks to her apparently unconscious face telling her that his family would never forgive him if they found out he was this close to her and didn't avenge his family, some of whom had been killed by Grimms for admittedly legitimate reasons. Marie opens her eyes and tells him to take his best shot at which time Monroes eyes turn to blood red as he stares at her. He then turns to the room entrance and sees a thuggish man (Keith Cox) approaching who suddenly veers away. Monroe follows him as Marie looks on.

Frank and Nick stop the vehicle in the woods having to take a foot trail. Frank admits he can't guarantee the boys will be where he thinks they are.

Monroe follows the thug through a doorway in a boiler room. The thug steps out from behind a pillar an attacks him. Standing up Monroe is grabbed from behind, his arms pinned to his sides. A second thug (J.J. Morris) starts to lay into him and Monroe falls to the floor with the thugs continue to kick him. Temper raised Monroe turns into his Blutbad form, grabs the larger thug and raises him above his head to impact large pipes attached to the ceiling. The smaller thug brings out a gun and Monroe grabs and slams him into a pillar before grabbing his right arm and tearing the limb off at the shoulder. Monroe then reverts to his human form. Looking down on the thugs he admits ""That went a little too far."" before turning and running from the scene.

Nick and Frank enter the now empty cave. Frank picks up Rockys t-shirt, sniffs it and turns into his Jägerbar form and telling Nick that it (roh-hatz) has already started. Nick who had drawn his weapon as Frank changed watches as Frank follows Rockys scent out of the cave. Nick gives chase.

Gilda and Rocky are seen running through the forest, a roaring Jägerbar a short distance behind them, followed by a second. They come to a sudden stop as another Jägerbar appears ahead of them. Nick crashes out of the undergrowth between them. Repelling the attack of 2 of the Jägerbars, before raising his weapon and shooting into the air. He levels his gun at the remaining Jägerbar who carries a paw weapon and tells him ""This isn't going to get any better unless you stop."" The final Jägerbar reverts to the form of Barry and is intercepted by his father, now in human form, who tells them the hunt is over and it all stops now. Barry suddenly moves forward shouting ""No. Mom. Dont!"" Nick turns in time to see a large brown bear charging at him from the opposite direction. The bear jumps over a log, lands and disappears. Sounds of animal pain are heard. Walking over to the pit the boys had earlier dug they see the bear turning into Dianes human form, her body speared by sharpened stake.

Diane is seen being stretchered to an ambulance. Barry in handcuffs apologizes to her and is told he did no wrong. Frank disagrees and tells her that their son did do wrong and now they are all going to pay for it. She replies by saying you have to respect your ancestors. ""Not like this."" says Frank. Barry is placed in the rear seat of a squad car beside Jason and TB as Frank explains to Nick that Diane just wanted the boys to know their heritage.

Nick receives a call from Monroe, who shows signs of the beating he has taken at the hands of the two thugs. He explains to Nick that he protected Marie but may have gone too far. He turns into the wall as a wheeled stretcher containing the thug whose limb he tore off goes by, a wheeled box containing the severed limb follows. He tells Nick he can't stay around the hospital given what he has done and that Nick needs to return quickly as he can't be sure he got all of them.

Nick makes his way to the hospital.

A priest (Matt Baker) walks down the corridor toward Maries room, a scalpel held in his hand. On entering he draws the curtains around her bed and then leans over her with the intention of cutting her throat. Maries eyes open and she grabs his arm and forces him backwards are she jumps out of bed and they both crash through the curtains and tussle in the corridor. Marie gains the upper hand turning the scalpel in the priests hand and forcing it into his chest. Nick arrives in time to catch Marie before she collapses. Marie tells Nick ""Remember who you are and trust your instincts and nothing else."" before she dies.

Nick drives from the house with the trailer attached as Juliette looks on from the window.

Kneeling by a grave, Nick lays a bunch of flowers. Juliette asks if he is okay and he replies ""No, but it will be."" they both walk away from the grave as they are spied upon by a creature hidden in the surrounding bushes, its shape indistinct.

A view is shown of the grave Marker:

PORTLAND

The camera pans over a river and bridge then cuts to a scene of an electric tram, its doors opening as it comes to a standstill. The lower legs and feet of a woman are shown, wearing black patent stiletto heels with red soles. The woman, now seen to have long dark hair and wearing a black suit, joins the queue and gets on the tram.

The pretty young woman holds onto a grab strap as a young clean shaven male traveller passes by, a large long green canvas bag clutched to him. Sitting the woman looks toward the young man and sees him looking around the tram. The young man then nods, in the womans direction, and she quickly turns to see a bearded man, wearing glasses, acknowledge the nod with one of his own. The young man then reaches down and begins to open the top of his bag and takes out a large boom box. Held in the air the song 'YMCA by the Village People' is blasted out. The people in the carriage begin to sing along and do the actions, the young woman smiles as a look of relief passes over her face. The tram driver (Wrick Jones) is shown, muttering something unintelligible. The smile quickly disappears from the womans face as she is jostled by her fellow travellers, when she stands to make exit from the vehicle. The tram stops and the revellers disembark quickly laughing and high fiving as they all leave.

The tram driver having turned to watch everyone disembark then rises from his seat and makes his way down the passageway shouting ""Miss"". The camera viewpoint changes to reveal a body lying on the floor with the upper half obscured by a seat. The corpse is recognizable as being that of the young woman by the black patent heels with red soles.

Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) walk toward a now taped off area around the tram. They discuss the sudden death, assuming that the young woman was part of the flash mob, and that it was ""a crappy way to go"". Sgt Wu (Reggie Lee) identifies the young woman as ""Serena Dunbrook"" (Mary Ann Jarou) ""aged 34"" who was on her way to work, as a lawyer for Berman, Rautbort & Associates. Wu then passes Nick Serenas Drivers license, which he obtained from her purse. Nick looks at the picture and makes comment only to be told by Wu that is ""what she used to look like"". Wu leans down and removes the sheet from the victim. Serenas face is revealed, a grotesque transformation of her pretty features having taken place. The face is swollen, eyes wide open and protruding and the skin has an unhealthy and discoloured mottled effect. Nick , kneeling, looks at her features intently.

Wu says that, although unofficial, they believe that Serena has died of anaphylactic shock. Hank finds it hard to believe that ""one little bee sting"" could have killed her. Still examining the body Nick says that they should get the ME to check her medical records to see if there is anything in them to indicate any severe allergies. He also points out that as yet they cannot be sure that that it was an accident, while Wu makes a tasteless joke about it being a killer bee as well as telling them that it is just a waste of their time. Hank reminds them of a dog which was attacked in Cathedral Park by a swarm of bees the previous week. Wu, unconvinced, decides to bet them $20 dollars that there is no foul play involved, a bet that Nick takes as he exposes the victims neck to show them a large puncture wound just below the left ear which was made by something larger than a bee stinger.

Dr Harper (Sharon Sachs), Nick and Hank enter a hospital examination room. Harper confirms that Serena died of Anaphylactic shock, from bee venom. She informs Nick and Hank that she has sent a sample away to a local Apiarist, Bee Keeper, for further analysis. Nick asks about the wound and Harper admits that she doesnt know what caused the wound as it is too big for even the largest syringe. The medical records do not show any record of an allergy, however given the amount of venom, 50mg, in her system it was unsurprising that Serena died as that of a normal bee sting would only be 0.1mg. Nick and Hank then run through a scenario of the chain of events leading to the death which was committed by an unknown person injecting Serena with the venom. Harper confirms that it is a homicide.

CCTV images play on a computer screen: HILLSBORO *226/07:13. The screen shows passengers inside the tram, Serena entering and moving out of view as everyone suddenly does the YMCA hand gestures. Nick instructs WU to get it on the news in the hope of witnesses coming forward. Rising to leave Nick and Hank are intercepted by Capt. Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz) who tells them that he wants their full attention on the case as he doesnt want the city population to fear travelling on public transport. He confirms with the pair that it wasn't a random killing.

Nick and Hank are in a large office contained within the Berman, Rautbort & Associates building where they interview Harrison Rautbort (Shelly Lipkin) and Camilla Gotlieb (Linn Bjornland). Both confirm that she was a good lawyer and a nice person with no known boyfriend. Nick and Hank enquire if she had any enemies or if the cases she was working on could have contributed to her death. Harrison does not think so but offers them full access to case files which he will message over to their office for them to check out. Camilla is tearful throughout the interview and says that Selena took her under her wing. On leaving the office Hank checks his cell phone and says ""Harpers Bee man just buzzed me."". A look from Nick and he says ""Yeah, I went there.""

Blue flowers in a garden with bees buzzing around happily as they feed on the nectar. Hank and Nick are seen examining empty bee hives and other paraphernalia. A bee lands on Nicks hand and Prof. Elliot Spinella (Michael J. Prosser) tells them that it is a Queen and that she must like Nick as she is fiercely protective of her nest and almost never shows herself. Spinella clothed in protective gear then removes the bee from Nick and places her back in her hive, thereafter removing his bee hood. Nick asks if he has had any luck analyzing the toxin Harper had sent over. Spinella confirms that he did and that it is not synthetic but naturally occurring, that it must have been harvested. Spinella explains that each toxin is individual and has markers for a specific region or country, however in this case he is unable to specify the region due to its unusual chemical balance which he has never seen before and therefore has no known origin. He also tells them that if they were considering him as a suspect he does not have the equipment to harvest that amount of toxin and that he has an alibi for the time of murder with 11 witnesses.

Back at the station Wu informs them that their appeal for witnesses from the flash mob has paid off, as they turn a corner and make their way through a group of people, he confirms that 22 people have so far come forward. Wu also lets them know that Renard is taking a keen interest in the case. Hank asks Wu to check out Professor Spinellas alibi while he and Nick interview the flash mob witnesses. Each of the witnesses #1 (Michelle Danilson), #2 (Claire Doody), #3 (Austin Hillebrecht) and #4 (Marzell Sampson) confirms that they received a tweet with the date, time and venue of the flash mob and that they did not know the other participants or who sent the tweet. No-one witnessed the murder. Nick finally interviews Doug Shellow (Rich Morris), who has placed his cell on the interview table, and asks Shellow to show him a copy of the tweet which was sent, but he is refused. Nick then asks him to repeat his version of events and trips up as the details are no longer the same as his previous statement. Nick then asks to see the tweet again and reaches for the cell. Shellows hand covers the cell before Nick can reach it and then hand and arm morph into a spike covered appendage. Nick and Shellow stare at each other before being interrupted by Hank knocking on the glass windowed door as he looks in. As Nick leaves the room we see that Shellows hand and forearm have now returned to normal. Hank informs Nick that the text was sent from a spam email address so no other details can be found of who sent it. During the conversation Nick is looking through the window at Shellow whose face morphs into that of a strange insect with large dark eyes, small antennae, sharp teeth and two small moveable mouth type parts on the chin. Nick turns in time to see another of the witnesses, John Coleman (Stephen Lange), who is seated outside the room, also morph into one of the strange insect Wesen. Nick then returns his attention to Shellow who proceeds to return to normal. Nick then confirms with Hank that he believes that Shellow is involved in the murder.

A vehicle is seen entering the gates of the Primrose Paper Mill, a sign declares that the paper mill is closed and that no trespassing is allowed. Hank and Nick drive up in time to see the car drive through into the factory grounds. They comment that this doesn't look like a place to call home as we see Shellow ascending stairs to a door in the factory building. The site of Shellows legs walking in the door clearly show the floor of the building which is strewn with small pieces of paper suitable for paper making. Nick watches from the corner of an opposite building and it becomes clear that Nick and Hank had been following Shellows vehicle. Nick and Hank make their way down the rubbish strewn road to the doorway while discussing the Primrose Paper Mills history as having been a family business and being there forever. The pair enter the building where they see, from a hidden position,Shellow and Coleman talking before being joined by a woman whose face is hidden from their view. A bee suddenly lands on a wire in front of them and is quickly joined by the full swarm which proceeds to chase them. The noise of the bees as well as the sounds Nick and Hank make while retreating from the bees alerts the three conspirators to their presence causing them to scatter and make a hurried escape. Nick and Hank dash through the factory until they find an isolated office which they lock themselves inside. The swarm of bees covering the windows and door as they try to block any entrance points. The bees disappear as quickly as they arrived and Nick and Hank leave the safety of the office. Once again walking through the factory Hank comments on the coincidence of Selenas death by bee venom and that they have been swarmed. Nick says he doesn't think it is a coincidence as the bees have completely disappeared. Nick hurries Hank out of the building on the premise of finding his partner help for his bee stings having noticed white footmarks on the ground belonging to the three conspirators.

Back at Nick and Juliette Silvetons (Elizabeth Tulloch) home. Juliete applies a stick cream to Hanks wounds. Nick enters the room with two beers and a water for Hank. Juliette explains that bees normally have to be provoked before they sting and enquires as to whether Hank kicked their hive or something. Hank says no and then Juliette continues to explain that bees are highly effective communicators with the scout flying around until they find the perfect flower when they buzz back to the hive and communicate with the colony to follow them. Nick tells Hank that he has put out an APB for Shellow and Coleman as they are the best bet for solving the crime. John and Doug reporting to her shows a connection to Serenas murder. Hank suggests taking a look at the case files Berman, Rautbort & Associates had sent them and stands to get them. Juliette disagrees telling Hank he must rest and not scratch the stings for the next eight hours as she has tranquilized him with her remedy. Nick agrees with Juliette so Hank goes home for the night. Juliette and Nick kiss as she tells him she understands that he has to work. Nick tells her he just has to do some research and that he will not be too long. Juliette walks away, hands in pocket looking slightly unhappy but resigned to the situation.

Forest Hill Storage Yard where an old fashioned silver trailer is parked up. Nick parks to the rear of the trailer, gets out and enters it. Nick is viewed through the skylight sitting at a desk poring over a large book containing hand drawn images and text. A bee is seen on the skylight as he does so. A closer look at the page shows the drawn image of the insect Wesen that Shellow and Coleman turn into as well as a needled weaponlike device.

BOOK INFORMATION: Mellifer Is the messenger among all. They balance the ecotone of our world. I have found that we should treat a Mellifer with respect for they pose no threat to a Grimm.

The stinger is used as a weapon of self defence by the Mellifers. I have witnessed it used on Hexenbiests.

Nick turns the page of the book and sees a picture of a Hexenbiest. His memory returns to a young woman (Claire Coffee) he had previously seen for the first time outside a jewellery store (EP1-Pilot) and later in the hospital when she was trying to kill Aunt Marie Kessler (Kate Burton) (EP2-Bears will be Bears). Her visage changing the first time to that of the one in the book, this being his first sighting of a Wesen and prior to his learning of the Grimm legacy from Aunt Marie. He reads aloud The Hexenbiest mark can be found under the tongue in both human form and morphed form. ""The drawing shows a tongue with a crescent shaped mark."" Turning another page he views another drawing, of The Mellischwuler (sp?) The Queen Bee. A drawing of a Queen Honey Bee is shown opposite. Nick takes out his cell and makes a call. He asks the other person if he/she had heard of the tram incident?

The scene changes to that of the darkened paper mill factory. A shadowed figure walks between machinery a torch lighting their way. The person suddenly turns a corner and comes into the light where we recognize him as Nick. Turning to light the area from which he just came a short sharp scream is heard as Nick turns the torch on Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), a Blutbad (werewolf) Wesen. Monroe tells Nick to calm down as he is at the factory at Nicks request. Having already been informed of the tram case by cell phone, Monroe comments that murder is not something he would expect of a Mellifer. Nick says that he read in the book that they generally only attack when defending themselves, which Monroe confirms then informs Nick that they act as the gossip section of the Wesen world. Nick tells Monroe about the bee attack on Hank and himself before bending to kneel beside the white footprints he had seen on his earlier visit. Nick then informs Monroe that he needs him not for the knowledge he may have of Mellifers but for his nose, in the hope that he can follow the scent of the two men who earlier escaped from the factory. As a bribe, when Monroe does not seem keen, Nick offers Monroe a bottle of '78 Bordeaux which he has in his car. Nick asks Monroe if Mellifers are messengers why they would then murder an innocent girl. Monroe replies that she perhaps wasn't so innocent.

Monroe moves off up some steps, sniffing the air, as he tracks the two men. Nick follows closely behind him. Monroe confirms that Mellifer have only one natural enemy The Hexenbiest. Monroe stops and tells Nick he can smell a female, 'Undeniable' being the perfume she is wearing. He then leads Nick into an office. Monroe continues to sniff around the office, seats and computer keyboard, as Nick checks a filing cabinet, and draws out a file telling Monroe the woman is Melissa Wincroft (Nana Visitor). Monroe asks if Nick just 'Grimmed' that information but Nick says he got it off an envelope sitting on the desk.

Nick and Monroe walk in darkness toward the entrance of a large white, pillared, mansion. Nick tries the door while Monroe hangs back still sniffing for the females scent or perfume. Unable to gain entry they make their way to an open glass door where torch in hand Nick enters with Monroe following closely on his heels. Nick steps on something crunchy and shining the torch downward sees a multitude of dead honey bees on the floor. Hearing a strange sound they make their way to the front hall before starting to ascend the main staircase, the weird sound obviously emanating from the upper levels. Monroe stops and questions Nicks sanity in going in that direction, but nevertheless follows him. As they pass below the upper edge of the staircase we can see liquid dripping from the upper level, and they continue onward. The turn to the right and ascend a smaller workaday staircase leading to the attic with a closed door shown at the top of the stairs. Nick continues to ascend and then opens the door slowly and quietly. He shines the torch into the room and sees some large stalactite structures dripping liquid into buckets.

Morning and Police cars and officers have cordoned off the house. Inside Hank and Nick examine the structures more closely, they resemble huge honey combs. Nick says he found the house through examining Serenas Legal Files which had been sent over as promised. He confirms that Melissa Wincroft owns the property and the liquid was similar to that which killed Serena. Hank notes that it looks like she left the property suddenly without choosing to sell it or buy another. Nick tells Hank that he did not call him as he was supposed to be resting from the bee stings he suffered the previous day. Hank asks Nick to connect the dots for him. Nick explains: a messy class action suit the previous year, Serena represented a hostile company takeover of Primrose Paper Mill, the employees fought it, including Coleman and Shellow, however they lost. Melissa Wincroft was their boss, her family having operated and owned the paper plant for over a century and therefore having the most to lose. Melissa then took revenge on Serena for causing the loss of the company. Nick and Hank are interrupted by an officer who informs them that Sgt. Wu says that there has been another flash mob murder in Chapman Square.

Walking toward a cordoned off area of park Wu tells them the details of the murder: the victim doing yoga, the flash mob occurring, the victim dying in the same way Serena did. All of which was caught on an overhead camera. Shellow and Coleman were not involved as they had been arrested and where in a cell at the station at the time. Neither of them will say anything until they Lawyer up. Approaching the victim Renard is seen kneeling down looking at the swollen face of the victim. Nick and Hank confirm that they have a solid lead on the perp, Melissa Wincroft, whom they are zeroing in on. Looking down at the victim Nick recognizes her as being Camilla Gotleib, from her large gold locket, and the other lawyer involved in the Primrose Paper Mill class action suit. Renard says that they now definitely have a pattern. Nick turns, cell phone ready to use, as he comments that there was a third lawyer on the case and that they have to get to them before they are also murdered. Calling the police station he asks that Police be deployed to the Legal firm to take the third lawyer, Adalind Schade (Claire Coffee) into protective custody.

Renard, Nick and Hank walk into the captains office to speak to the third lawyer. As Adalind turns and faces the doorway Nick recognizes the woman as the one who tried to kill his Aunt Marie. He also knows her to be a Hexenbiest. Adalind does not let on that they have met before although on leaving the office and moving past Nick that she is wary and anxious. Renard noticing Nicks scrutiny asks a number of questions, in order to find out if Nick is telling more than he has said and/or to see if Nick has made Adalinds connection to himself (EP1- Pilot). Nick says he doesnt know her and so Renard finishes his questioning by telling Nick to look after Adalind as they wouldnt want a third lawyer murdered.

Nick is seen rushing into Dr Harpers autopy room and asking to see the 2 previous victims tongues. Harper removes them from the fridge and explains they were so swollen it was the only way she could examine them. On examination Nick sees the mark of the Hexenbiest on each of the tongues. Not tattoos according to Harper.

Hank and Adalind are seen viewing a screen where Melissa Wincroft (Nana Visitor) is answering questions regarding her companies earnings. She then goes on to stress that it was more than a company, it was a family that they were trying to tear down and that they are just using the case to get them out of the way. The woman says she knows who is behind it and that they are not going to get away with it. Hank then turns to Adalind and says that it sounds like a threat to him but Adalind cannot believe that she would have done it to Serena and Camilla. Nick enters the room and comments that it seemed a lot more personal than professional which Adalind refutes by stating she was just doing her job. Both make veiled comments to each other regarding their hidden identities; Grimm and Hexenbiest. After some more comments between then Hank decides to excuse both Nick and himself from the room. Walking down the hall Hank queries Nick questioning technique by treating her like a perp to which Nick replies that he does not trust her. Hank however says that all they have to do is protect her and first on the agenda is hunting down Melissa Wincroft.

The camera cuts back to Adalind as she rises and comes to the door of the interview room to speak with Renard. She lets him know Nick recognizes her from the Hospital. Renard tells her that Nick isn't letting on and that he (Renard) will protect her. Adalind says she can look after herself but that Renard had better find The Queen or she won't be the only person to get stung.

Hank comes off his cell phone to tell Nick that Melissa as no activity on a credit card, cell, travel, bank account and can not be found in the system. Nick replies that she has no known family and the only known friends she has are Shellow and Coleman. Nick points out that they do not need Melissa to get in touch with either Shellow or Coleman that all they need is for Shellow to communicate with her, by text, and they can intercept the call and track her down. Neither of them knowing that Nick and Hank are protecting Adalind Schade.

Nick enters an interview room to speak to Shellow. Nick sits down and produces Shellows cell phone explaining that he, Shellow, was about to show him some tweets. Nick lays out how much time Shellow is already due to get for conspiracy to murder and that they can put him at the murder scene. He then wants to know who he is trying to protect and if there is another victim, and drops Melissas name. Hank then rushes into the room telling Nick that Renard wants to see him urgently. Nick leaves the room and Shellow quickly picks up the cell phone Nick had left on the table. Checking that no-one is looking through the door window he then looks suspiciously at the two way mirror where Renard, Wu, Nick and Hank return his stare. Shellow begins to type then send a text/tweet which Wu intercepts via a computer. The message reads ""They don't know AS open."". Nick deciphers it as Adalind Schade being open to being murdered.

A young woman, blonde hair with a handkerchief held to her mouth alights from a yellow cab and makes her way into a modern building, closely watched by a man in a parked car. On entering the buildings Reception she ignores the security guard, when he offers a good morning, but continues to the lift. The security guard lets an unknown person know she has arrived via his radio headset. The woman then enters the lift and is quickly joined by a male traveller. On turning we realize the male is Wu and the woman is an undercover policewoman made up to look like Adalind. Wu lets Nick and Hank know that the trap has been set to catch Melissa, if she shows herself.

Putting his cell away we see that Nick, Hank and Adalind are in a hotel room. Hank reassures Adalind that all eyes are on her apartment and that this is the easiest way to flush her out. Adalind comments on the inconvenience it is to them and Nick replies somewhat acerbically that they are just doing their jobs. It is clear that after trying to kill his Aunt Marie Nick does not believe Adalind deserves the protection, but is unable to confide and legitimize his reasons to the others involved including Hank. Hank breaks the difficult situation by asking if they want room service. Hank leaves to make/get some coffee leaving Adalind and Nick in the room together. Nick then tells her he knows she is a Hexenbiest like Serena and Camilla and that she had tried to kill his aunt in the hospital, that he has seen the marks on their tongues. Despite the questioning that follows Adalind remiains silent with just the pressure of her nails in the chair fabric showing her stress. He asks why the Mellifers want her dead and she tells him to figure it out. He replies that while he doesn't like it it is his duty to protect her but that she better hope he better not have a good reason or a bad day at work as it won't save her.

A parked car within which is Melissa and Dr Spinella. He asks why Melissa involved him as he is clean and doesn't want to go to jail, morphing under stress into a Mellifer as he does so. Melissa explains that he has as much to lose as the rest of them. Melissa slides open the door of the minivan and a swarm of bees fly out.

Hank, in the kitchen, sees a bee then turns and notices a few more. Following them he sees they are entering via an open window in the bathroom.

Back in the living room Adalind tells Nick he doesn't know what he is getting himself into. Nick then taunts her by saying it would therefore be understandable if a Queen Mellifer was to kill another Hexenbiest. This causes her to lose control and morph into a Hexenbiest. Nick finally smiles at her as she fights to regain her control. She then points out that it won't be a Grimm killing a Hexenbiest but a cop letting an innocent young woman die in everyone elses eyes.

A call from Hank and Nick swiftly joins him in the bathroom. Unable to close the window Hank is fighting a losing battle with the bees. Neither he nor Nick can budge the window.

Adalind turns around in her seat the light from the window quickly being occluded.

Back in the Bathroom the bees begin to fly up and away from the window. Nick rushes through to the living room and Adalind, followed by Hank. On arriving in the room Adalinds seat is vacant, and bees cover the entirety of the outer window.

Hank and Nick rush it into the hall, there is no sign of forced entry and the lift is still on their floor. They open the door to the stairwell with Nick going down and Hank up, shouting Adalinds name as they go. Nick spots Adalind on the stairwell below him and shouts out, but she ignores him and keeps descending.

Nick reaches the basement, opens the door and is presented by swarms of bees and Melissa with a stinger in hand. She tells him she has to kill Adalind and that he doesn't understand. Nick has drawn his gun and has it aimed at Melissa as she talks. She claims they killed Serena and Camilla to protect Nick, that they closed the paper mill down so that the Mellifers couldn't pass on their message to him. Nick says that they still killed two people which Melissa refutes as they were Hexenbiests. Melissa says she has to finish it, the killing of Adalind, then turns and flees. Melissa is then seen grabbing Adalind and they both fight. Nick is unable to get a clear shot. Adalind grabs Melissas arm which morphs causing Melissa to withdraw her hand and the pain causing her to morph as well. Both woman shout things to Nick; do your job, don't listen to her, act like a Grimm etc. Nick moves closer as Hank arrives. Adalind calls out frailly, acting the innocent, to Hank for help. Nick warns Melissa to back away before he finally shoots her twice in the back. Hank helps Adalind as Melissa stumbles toward Nick in her morphed form. Melissa falls to her knees, features returning to normal and passes on a final message ""Hes coming for you...Hes close"". Melissa then dies and all the bees fall to the ground. Adalind gives him a final sneaky smile, crouched in Hanks arms.

In bed, alongside Juliette, Nick remembers something his Aunt Marie told him ""You have to hunt down the bad ones, just like your ancestors did"". Juliette turns over and snuggles to his chest before raising herself and looking in his face. She comforts him by saying that Hank said that he (Nick) did the right thing. Nick says that sometimes it isn't that simple. She tries to comfort him by saying that he made a difference to Hank and the woman he saved, without realizing that it may not have been the correct decision for these particular circumstances but is unable to say so. Juliette then says that she is cold but Nick insists on closing the window for her. He sees what looks like a queen bee which alights and crawls on his hand and then suddenly stings him. He quickly closes the window."

She is accidentally hit by a car driven by a man who is quite shaken up by the event. As he approaches the victim to check on her, another man appears and verifies that she is still breathing and instructs the driver to call 911. While he is back at his car making the call, another man the unknown man kills the woman and leaves unnoticed. Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive on the scene and, after the CSI is finished, observe that the barefooted woman has no injuries to her feet but does have glass in cuts on her arm.

A reaper comes to Portland and checks into a small hotel, the Joyce Hotel. He receives a call on his cell phone and tells the caller he will call when it's finished. He looks at a newspaper article about the death of Hulda and opens up a Scythe and Woges into a Hässlich.

The two detectives confer with Doctor Harper, the medical examiner, who tells them that the victim was murdered by asphyxiation. Using fingerprints, Hank identifies the young woman as Faith Collins. Nick and Hank interview Faith's husband, Roy Collins, who has a record of spousal abuse. Roy admits to having argued with Faith, but denies any wrongdoing. He admitted he was upset when he came home from work hungry, and Faith wouldn't get off the computer due to her ""322 friends"" online. He says she left their home but that he waited for her to return as she always does. 104 Capra Morphs Garden

Billy Capra morphing.

After conferring with Captain Renard, Nick and Hank check Faith's page on a social networking site and find a picture taken in the garden of the Bramble Haus, a bed and breakfast. They check with the owner and operator, Billy Capra, just as a young man and woman are checking out. Capra says he showed a room to Faith but that she did not stay. The detectives visit the garden where Hank inadvertently steps on and kills a toad. Capra says the toad is an endangered species and picks up the remains. Nick sees Capra woge into a creature form he does not recognize. As the detectives leave the garden, Capra eats the toad.

The reaper goes to the police station and asks to talk with the detective who shot his friend. Sergeant Wu takes the request to Renard who tells him to get the reaper's personal information and tell him that someone will get back to him.

Nick and Hank decide that they have to look into Billy Capra's background; as they enter the squad room, they pass the reaper.

Nick goes to Marie's Trailer and reads about Ziegevolk. He then goes to ask Monroe some questions. Monroe tells him that Ziegevolk secrete a special pheromone in their sweat that makes woman fall in love with them.

Nick and Juliette are shopping and he tells her he has been wondering why people are attracted to each other.

Back at work, Nick tells Hank that the glass pieces from Faith Collins's cuts are regular window glass and that she must have broken a window right before she died. They discuss the fact that three women from out of town have disappeared in Portland since Capra arrived and bought the Bramble Haus. They also find that a similar situation has occurred in three other cities in the U.S. Together, they brief Captain Renard. Of the 17 women found in these cases, 14 were found pregnant and the DNA showed they all had the same father.

Billy Capra feeds three women kept in cages in the basement of his inn.

While staking out the inn, Hank Griffin installs a tracking device on Billy Capra's car; the detectives are dismayed when Capra goes out for the evening and leaves the car at home. Hank searches the premises of the inn while Nick follows Capra on foot and sees him consume a toad before entering a bar. Hank finds broken glass in the inn's garden and uses that as an excuse to enter the building. Nick calls Monroe and asks for help. Upon learning that Nick just wants him to hang out at the bar and watch Billy, he gladly agrees as long as Nick is paying for the drinks. He notes that a Ziegevolk who eats toads is a breeder, and that their pheromones are even more powerful and can even make men fall for them. He sees Billy talking to a woman and tells Nick.

The reaper returns to his hotel room and finds Captain Renard waiting for him. Renard reminds the reaper that he should not have come to Renard's city without permission and that he should kneel before Renard. The captain denies the reaper's demand for vengeance in the death of Hulda and uses the reaper's own scythe to slice off his outer ear. Renard tells the reaper to leave and never to return.

Meanwhile, Hank is inside the bed and breakfast when he hears a noise. He goes into the basement and finds a hidden room. Inside, he finds three women in cages. He passes out from the gas that Capra has installed to prevent escape, so he doesn't answer his phone when Nick calls to warn him that Capra is coming back.

Billy Capra returns to his Inn and turns off the gas in the basement. He goes upstairs and soon Lisa enters. He is about to take her on a garden tour when Nick enters and asks her to go with him. Outside, he tells her she walked into a police investigation and requests that she leave the premises. Nick had requested a tracking of Hank's phone when Hank hadn't answered his calls and learns that Hank's phone is inside the inn. Nick dials Hank's number, follows the sound, and enters the basement. Seeing Hank lying there, he rushes in to help him. Billy, who had been upstairs packing, shuts and locks the door behind Nick and turns the gas back on. He flees to his car, taking Lisa with him.

Nick and Hank manage to break out, despite the vivid visual hallucinations Hank is having. The women are rescued, but Billy managed to get away. Returning to the car, Hank picks up his laptop to check for info from the tracking device they had planted on Billy's car. Luckily, it works and they track him to a park. Once there, they spot Billy and Lisa and call for Billy to halt. Billy woges into a Ziegevolk and runs for it, until he is hit by a bus. He is alive but injured. Nick wonders how Billy is going to like being caged up the rest of his life, as a Female Paramedic who is putting an oxygen mask on Billy, shows signs of response to Billy's pheromones."

Nick and Hank are led to a expelled music prodigy who has a strange sort for vengeance against those who wronged him.,[],TV-14,Release date,['David Solomon'],"['', '', '']",[],"['cage', 'bully', 'party', 'rascal', 'execution', 'embarrassment', 'dancing', 'adolescent']",[],"A rave is being held somewhere in Portland, Oregon where a popular DJ, Retchid Kat, is disc jockeying. At the same time, a string quartet consisting of Sarah Jennings, Carter Brimley, Trey Harrison and Marvin is practicing Saint-Saëns's Danse macabre (translating as ""Dance of Death"") under the direction of Paul Lawson at the Von Hamelin Music Institute. Later that evening Lawson enters his car and finds many rats inside. The rats attack. The next morning, the school principal, Grace Kaplan finds Lawson dead in his car with rats walking on his partially eaten body. The police find cages labelled with ""Geiger Pest Control"" in the bushes.

While interrogating the members of the quartet, Nick and Hank learn that there was a student called Roddy Geiger that was suspended a few days earlier, though Sarah says that Roddy wouldn't do something like that.

When they get to the Geiger home, Nick and Hank hear violin music which leads them to Roddy playing in a shed where rats are pressed up to the cages, listening. His father, Ephram Geiger, accuses them of coming to arrest and hurt them, woging into a Reinigen just before he tries to strike Hank for grabbing Roddy (who was probably about to run away). Roddy sees that Nick is a Grimm and instantly distrusts him, accusing Nick of wanting to kill him before attacking (which is stopped by Nick punching him in the face). Both Geigers are arrested.

Ephram Geiger says that he was in the mountains during the time of attack while also saying the cages were stolen and that the students at the school never let his son forget their lack of wealth. He also says that Roddy is a prodigy. During Roddy's interrogation, details about his suspension surface. He was suspended for attacking Carter and Trey, though he claims that ""Yeah, I attacked after they jumped me."" He also admits that he was at the rave the night before and says that one person can alibi him. That person reveals that Roddy is DJ Retchid Kat and Roddy goes free though his dad stays.

Doctor Harper calls them and tells them that Dr. Lawson did not die of the rats; he died of a heart attack. Harper also shows green and red nylon fibers that she found in a rat's stomach which could have come from the car.

Sarah Jennings This then goes back to Roddy who is watching a car and obviously aggravated as he woges into his other form. Sarah gets out of the car and Roddy tells her that the cops have his dad and that the person who did this wanted them (the police) to think it was one of the Geigers. Sarah says that everyone thinks that and says that it makes sense and that Lawson was the one that got him out of the quartet. Roddy says that it's bogus and she knows it. She says that they're her friends, and when he asks her what he is, she claims that he's someone she used to care about. Roddy kisses her and says that she still loves him, but Sarah says that she can't keep sneaking out to be with him before pushing him away. She asks if he didn't put the rats in the car then who did and Roddy accuses Carter. She refuses to believe it, however, and they are interrupted by Sarah's mother who tells Roddy to stay away from her daughter. He meets Carter on his way out and steps forward threateningly, but Carter has his phone already dialed to 911. Roddy hits the car window before stalking away.

Hank comes in with the report that says the fibers came from blankets and an expensive German car. Sarah's mother walks in at the end of the discussion and demands to know why Roddy hasn't been arrested, accusing him of harassing Sarah and saying that he's ""out of control"". She then says that they should get evidence that Roddy was guilty of the murder. When she says that he doesn't belong at the school, Hank asks ""Or your neighborhood?"" and she avoids the subject by saying that they should be writing this down because she was filing a report. Hank later says that he hasn't ""had that much fun since that drunk threw up on [him] at the Christmas party.""

Nick goes to Monroe who tells him about how Reinigen are at the bottom of the food chain and Nick shows that he already knows a bit about them by saying that they're only violent when pushed to the limit. Nick then asks Monroe to talk to Roddy and convinces him to by describing Roddy's musical talent.

Hank and Sgt. Wu go out drinking and Hank admits that Nick's instincts are often right. Hank leaves and meets Adalind Schade who asks to buy him dinner. Captain Renard is watching them from his car.

The camera shows a picture of the quartet minus Carter with Roddy in his place. Roddy is playing a Brahms concerto which Monroe comments on (""You were kicking some butt on that Brahms concerto, man!""). When Monroe says that he is a friend of Detective Burkhardt, Roddy tries to close the door. Monroe catches it, partially woging and revealing his Wesen form. This causes Roddy to back away in fear. Monroe tells Roddy about how Nick isn't like other Grimms and that he's worried about Roddy. Monroe then proceeds to try to lecture Roddy on ""not being stupid"" and how he has talent. Monroe leaves feeling proud of himself.

Unbeknownst to him and Nick, Roddy gets a call from Officer Clay who says that Roddy's father was injured when he refused to enter the cell. Roddy destroys his room (including smashing the picture) in anger. The next day, he unleashes the rats and packs up his violin and Retchid Kat head before heading off to a warehouse with the rats following, accidentally leaving a set fire behind.

Hank and Nick are telling Renard about the results they found with the fibers and it is discovered that Carter drives a car of the description they're looking for. Renard grants them a search warrant.

Carter, Trey, and Marvin are talking about the rats and how Sarah is now suspicious of them. They each get messages about Retchid Kat playing. They all decide to go.

Nick and Hank search Carter's SUV (while being badgered by an indignant father) and find a school banner that matches the fibers as well as a rat dropping. They then go to Sarah's house and find a text on her phone that says that Retchid Kat would be at a warehouse on Front Street.

When the quartet arrive, they think that they might be early and decide to just follow the music which leads them downstairs, Nick and Hank arriving just as they start heading down. In the warehouse, Retchid Kat stops the music and says how they were the ones who killed Lawson which causes Sarah to realize the truth. He then starts to play the violin showing that it's Roddy, and the rats start to attack. The boys run away and Sarah is alone and still being attacked, so Roddy stops the music just before Hank comes in and shoots his gun upwards so that rats will disperse. Nick rushes to Sarah and gets the remaining rats off her.

The boys admit to the police that they did it, but they only meant to scare Dr. Lawson and make it seem Roddy did it. Sarah bluntly says that Roddy was better than all of them and asks them to tell Roddy she's sorry. Hank says that she should tell him herself.

While trying to write the report, they decide to let Roddy off the hook seeing as it was doubtful anyone would believe them and no one forced the four to go down there.

Nick also learns that his presence is beginning to affect the creature world when his refrigerator repairman turns out to be an Eisbiber who is terrified of Nick."

The man, Hap Lasser, is watching an exercise video on TV, and he lifts a Shake Weight, shaking it in spastic bursts. Hap loses his grip, sending the Shake Weight flying through a window. Hap sighs and heads for the door. Hap goes outside to retrieve the Shake Weight. As he bends down to pick it up, in a split second, his home explodes in a fireball behind him. Hap slowly turns and stares back in disbelief at his burning home. Dawn breaks on the crime scene, as a bomb squad and Fire & Rescue root through the smoldering wreckage.

Nick and Hank try to get a statement from Hap, who's staring at what's left of his home, picking up pieces of his shattered life. Hap makes it clear that he's not involved in any shady activities that would result in his home exploding. As he gets emotional, Nick sees Hap morph to reveal himself as a Blutbad, though he doesn't realize Nick is a Grimm. Hap reveals that his brother died in a similar house fire last month, but he doesn't worry about a connection between the two fires. Nick and Hank aren't convinced; this is too strange to be a coincidence.

As Hank and Nick question Hap in an attempt to make a connection between the two fires, Monroe pays a surprise visit to the station. Apparently, he's Hap's emergency contact, and he has begrudgingly agreed to take in Hap during his time of need. Hap excitedly hugs Monroe who is uncomfortably trying to resist. Nick asks Monroe to keep an eye on him for a couple days to make sure he stays out of trouble.

Hap's home is now abandoned until an unknown roar of a motorcycle approaches. The female helmeted rider approaches the wreckage, sniffing until she picks up a scent. Finally, the rider hones in on a plume of vapor around a burst and twisted propane line. The frustrated rider gives a creature-like growl and tears off on her motorcycle. Nick and Hank go over the arson case files with the arson investigator, Lt. Orson. The lieutenant explains that despite the fact that these ""accidents"" look like foul play, it seems to be a true coincidence; both fires can be explained by electrical issues. Despite the evidence, Nick refuses to believe that this was by chance, and he suspects that maybe the beneficiaries were responsible.

Back at Monroe's place, Monroe is less than thrilled at the idea of having Hap as a house guest, putting a damper on his very organized way of life. Meanwhile, Nick drives up to Monroe's house. As he pulls to the curb and kills the engine, the window suddenly shatters, and a ferocious female Blutbad attacks him ruthlessly. When she realizes he's a Grimm, she suddenly jumps back, unnerved for a moment. Monroe and Hap rush out just in time as Hap screams for the fighting to stop; the Blutbad is Hap's sister, and Monroe's ex-girlfriend, Angelina. Now in Monroe's house, Monroe explains the situation to a furious Angelina. She questions how they could be friendly with a Grimm after what he's done to their ancestors, and the fact that he's a Grimm and a cop. Angelina believes that her behavior was warranted; she was protecting her brother and Monroe. When Nick discovers that Angelina is the sole beneficiary in the event that both Rolf and Hap die, he grows suspicious of her involvement in the fire, but Monroe pleads with Nick that despite her hotheaded nature, he knows Angelina, and she would never do that to Rolf.

Angelina tears through the park, running wild and free. Monroe takes after her with pure glee across his face. Monroe gives in to the chase, and falls on top of her and the two tumble to the ground. Angelina wildly licks the side of Monroe's cheek bringing out his Blutbad side and they make love. As dawn breaks, Monroe and Angelina wake in the forest. Monroe's alarmed to find bloodstains on his hand and mouth and the bloody remains of a rabbit close by. Meanwhile, Hap is awakened by someone knocking on the door, claiming to be a rib delivery. When he opens the door, he's met by the sound of multiple bullets from a silenced pistol that hit him in the chest. With dying eyes, he looks up at the silhouette of a fearsome pig creature before being shot in the head. When Angelina and Monroe return to the house, the police have already arrived. Their late arrival made the cops suspicious. In thinking that the two were the killers, the two are brought in for questioning.

As Hank questions Angelina, he notices the blood on her shirt. She aggressively throws her shirt at Hank, telling him to test it. As Monroe and Angelina leave the police station, Angelina voices her frustration with Monroe for being friends with cops, who are trying to pin Hap's murder on her.

After investigating, Nick and Hank come to find that Lt. Orson is thought to be a serious suspect after seeing in his profile that his two brothers in Eugene were murdered two years ago, and they believe that Angelina was responsible. In their theory, Lt. Orson killed hers for payback. Since he's an arson expert, he knows better than anyone how to make an explosion look like an accident. Nick and Hank take up their theory with the captain, who tells them to make sure it's solid before throwing around accusations. Nick talks to the lieutenant, letting him know that they're getting a second opinion on the files. The nervous lieutenant woges into a pig creature, or Bauerschwein. Nick calls him out as a Bauerschwein, revealing that he's a Grimm. Lt. Orson tells Nick he has nothing against him and would hate to stir up trouble now.

Nick shows up at Monroe's, searching for Angelina. Angelina stopped by earlier looking for Monroe's help in tracking down the pig that killed her brothers, but he refused to take part. Monroe tells Nick the same thing he told her; he's staying out of it. Because the Blutbad-Bauerschwein Feud goes back centuries, they get blamed for every Bauerschwein death. Angelina arrives at the precinct in a sundress to track down Lt. Orson's office and sifts through files, looking for his home address and is interrupted by an officer. Angelina attacks the officer with her Blutbad strength and takes off on her bike. After hearing about the attack when he arrives at the station, Nick rushes to Lt. Orson's home, worried that Angelina may beat him there.

Nick arrives at the Lieutenant's house to find him relaxing in a mud bath. Orson explains that it's a comforting activity for Bauerschwein. He tries to reason with Nick, making the argument that they're actually on the same side. He states that Angelina is a monster, Rolf was the same, all Blutbaden are animals, and Angelina is the one they should be after. Nick asks if Hap was an animal, knowing Orson doesn't have a comeback for that. Orson instead tells him that the only reason Angelina murdered his hard-working brothers was that it ""was something to do on a Saturday night."" Nick tells Orson that regardless of her actions, he still killed two people and is under arrest. Before they can argue further, Angelina arrives on the scene, wrestling Orson to the couch. Both are woged, and a vicious fight ensues. Nick finds himself in quite the predicament, unsure of whom to shoot. When presented with an opportunity to hit Angelina's lower back, he takes it, remembering reading about Blutbadens' vulnerability relating to a nerve cluster in the lower spine from the Grimm diaries. When Angelina recovers and goes for Nick, Orson picks up his gun and shoots Angelina. Orson makes a move to fire again but is stopped when Nick knocks the gun out of his hand. Nick turns back to Angelina, but she has already run off into the night, leaving only a blood trail.

After other officers arrive at Orson's home, Orson is being taken away by paramedics when he tells Nick that sometimes being a cop gets in the way of what you have to do. At home, Monroe goes through pictures of himself with Angelina and Hap on his computer, reminiscing. Nick calls and updates him that Orson has been arrested and Angelina was shot. He believes that Monroe can help find her, but Monroe tells him to not push it and hangs up. Hearing a noise outside, he goes out to investigate and finds the framed Lasser sibling photo near the front door. As he looks out into the night, Angelina can be heard howling in the distance."

He takes them to his camp at gunpoint and is about to kill both of them when he hears a strange noise from the woods. The drug dealer goes to investigate the sound, but a rope wraps around his neck and pulls him out of sight. The couple hear an animal growl and see a shadow tearing through the contents of the drug dealer's tent, before they loosen their bonds and escape into the woods.

Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive at the crime scene. They examine the drug dealer's body. The neck is badly bruised and bent at a grotesque angle, clearly broken. The crime scene techs find brown hair on the body, which clearly does not belong to the bald drug dealer. DEA Agent Langford identifies the dealer as Delmar Blake, whom the DEA has been investigating for some time, but never been able to convict. Langford also makes clear that the DEA is solely concerned with Blake's drug operation, not finding his killer, who, he figures, ""did the planet a favor."" After the detectives talk with the Forest Service Ranger, Nick goes back to the body and discovers buckshot in a tree. As he searches for more evidence, a dark figure drops from the trees and flees from Nick. Nick chases after the figure, and it turns to growl at him, revealing it to be a female Blutbad with hair longer than her height. The Blutbad runs away.

Interviewed at their home, Dustin and Lauren relate what they saw, swearing that they never got a clear look at who (or what) attacked the drug dealer and tore through his tent, but whatever it was, it saved both their lives.

Nick and Hank brief Captain Renard, who notes several odd aspects of the crime: if the killer was a rival drug dealer, he would have taken the several million dollars worth of marijuana plants that Blake was growing; instead, he simply stole some food and a sleeping bag.

Micah and Roland Blake, the deceased Delmar's brothers, arrive at the police station and demand to see their brother's body. Hank and Nick tell them that they will all have to meet at the morgue. At the morgue, Micah and Roland act in a threatening manner but refrain from actually making any threats.

Nick and Hank return to the station. The brown hair found at the crime scene has been analyzed. Sergeant Wu tells Hank that the hair matches the DNA of Holly Clark, a girl who disappeared nine years ago at the age of seven.

Meanwhile, Micah and Roland abduct Dustin, and take him captive. They suspect he was after Delmar's drugs or knows what happened to him. He tells them exactly what happened, but they leave him tied up until they can determine if he is telling the truth.

Nick, completely baffled, seeks the help of Monroe, who is decorating for Christmas. Monroe tells Nick that Christmas is a big tradition in his family, and suggests that Santa Claus is not only real, but a Wesen to boot. Nick shows Holly's picture and Monroe says he can't tell from a photo whether she really is a Blutbad, but agrees that if she was, she'd have a better chance to survive on her own in the woods for nine years than a normal human would. Nick also explains that Holly was adopted as a young age, and doesn't know yet if her adoptive parents were Blutbaden, and asks what that could mean for Holly's development. Monroe explains that a Blutbad typically doesn't experience his or her own animal side until later in his childhood, and his own first morph ""scared the crap out of me."" If Holly did not have parents who understood what was happening to her, like Monroe did, then that could definitely explain why she disappeared into the woods. Nick says he needs Monroe's help to search the crime scene, and Monroe warily agrees, but not until the morning. He warns Nick that, whatever he may have in common with the girl, neither of them is prepared to deal with a Blutbad who has been living wild for nine years.

Nick goes home for the night and is perplexed about a car that speeds past his house. As he and Juliette prepare for sleep that night, they discuss Holly's situation.

Hank, who worked on the Holly Clark case before, gets permission to re-open the investigation. He sees Holly's adoptive mother to inform her the case has been re-opened. Hank asks her if she and her husband used to take her camping, and Holly's mother reveals they had taken Holly a few times and borrowed camping equipment from their former neighbor, James Addison. Hank has Wu get information on Addison, and Wu reports that of all the neighbors questioned about Holly's disappearance, Addison had the best alibi: he was in the hospital following a wild dog attack. However, on reading the report it was discovered that Addison reported he had been hiking near Mount Hood when the attack occurred, but he was hospitalized at Community Hospital in Beaverton, which would have been an hour's drive away. Hank and Officer Wu agree they should visit his home to question him. Mr. Addison, still needing a cane to walk, confirms that on the day Holly disappeared he had been in the hospital being treated for a wild dog bite, but when questioned why he drove such a long distance to be treated, he grows defensive. Hank requests that Mr. Addison accompany them to the station for a formal statement.

In the woods, Monroe picks up Holly's scent and he and Nick chase her through the woods and discover her refuge, a tree-house built in the forest's canopy. Monroe and Nick climb the tree and quietly enter, finding her passed out on her cot. Monroe cautiously approaches her and sees a spread of buckshot wounds in her lower abdomen. She awakens and growls defensively at Monroe. He shows her his Blutbad form, and she relaxes a little. Nick attempts to treat Holly's wounds, but she again growls in self-defense, unsure of Nick. Monroe explains to her that Nick can be trusted and she relaxes and lets Nick tend to her wounds. Nick fears that Holly needs more complete medical treatment and says they need to get her to a hospital. Monroe objects that Holly could hurt someone, but Nick says they have no other choice but to leave her there, which he refuses to do. Since his cell phone isn't receiving, Nick leaves to get help.

Monroe comforts Holly and feels her forehead, which is burning hot. He then says he'll go and get her some Burdock Root, a medicinal plant, to help her fever. Frightened of him leaving and never returning, Holly grabs his hand and whimpers. He promises he will return and she lies back down.

When Nick reaches the edge of the forest, he reaches Hank on his cell phone, requesting paramedics. He also asks Hank to run a name that Nick saw on some old camping gear in Holly's tree house: Addison.

At the station, Hank hangs up his phone, turns and asks Addison to explain how his camping gear turned up in Holly's hideout. Addison panics and throws a punch at Hank, which Hank blocks and punches Addison in the throat, dropping him. As he is restrained, Addison yells that Holly almost killed him and begs the police to keep him safe from her, clearly more terrified of her than of going to jail.

As Monroe digs up the Burdock Root, Micah and Roland, who were searching the site of their brother's murder, catch sight of him and follow him back to the treehouse. As Monroe is helping Holly chew the root, the brothers fire a warning shot and tell Monroe to come down. He obeys, but then they hear Holly in the tree house. Monroe insists no one is there, but one brother goes to look, and tells the other brother to shoot Monroe if he sees anyone. Holly has escaped, and Monroe breathes a sigh of relief, until the brother sees Delmar's camping gear in the tree house. Nick returns and tries to control the situation, but Holly intervenes and using her long braid to wrap around the neck of one brother, killing him, while Nick shoots the other one. Holly collapses after she saves Nick and Monroe.

Nick and Monroe take Holly to the hospital, and Hank informs her shocked mother that her daughter has been found alive. Nick drops off Monroe before taking Holly home, but she doesn't want him to go. He holds her hand and tells her to remember that she will never be alone.

At first, Holly barely recognizes her mother, but then holds up the plastic hair bow she was wearing the day she was abducted, and hugs her tearfully.

Captain Renard announces to the media that Holly has been found, alive and well, and that they have a suspect in custody on suspicion of abducting her.

Holly, along with her mother, Nick, Hank, and Renard, looks at a line of possible suspects in her case, and points directly at Addison. Her hair has been cut and her clothes are new and clean, but as she points, her eyes glow bright red."

Sergeant Wu responds to the alarm and find Patterson's body. Detectives Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin arrive at the crime scene soon after. After Captain Renard arrives, the crime scene investigator announces that they have recovered a fingerprint from the gavel used in the judge's murder. Elsewhere in Portland, the unidentified man is seen throwing a severed hand into a body of water.

Back at the precinct, Hank is talking to Captain Renard when he gets a call that the fingerprint on the gavel matches that of Vince Chilton. Hank, Renard, and Nick accompany a tactical team to Chilton's apartment. The lead officer secures the area and reports to Renard that there is a dead body in the apartment. The body is identified as Vince Chilton and is missing its right hand. On the stump of the right arm is a very old woman's watch. Hank remembers that Nick knows a watchmaker. The detectives go to Monroe's Home, where Monroe examines the watch and finds that the movement was glued to stop it at 10:15 on March 11th. Monroe traces the watch and finds that it last belonged to Mary Robinson. Hank recognizes the name as that of a retired assistant district attorney, and admits to having a bad feeling about the situation. Uniformed police, including Sergeant Wu, respond to Robinson's house, where they find her dead, her tongue having been cut out and placed on a set of scales. When Hank sees the body, he realizes that he knows the identity of the killer.

Back at the station, Hank explains to Renard and Nick that the killer is Oleg Stark, who was convicted of murder in the deaths of Jack Lambert, his wife, and child. They discuss how Stark escaped from prison in California and that he is insensitive to pain and has very dense bones. Hank explains that Judge Patterson presided, Mary Robinson prosecuted and Vince Chilton was the jury foreman. The verdict was handed down at 10:15 on March 11th. Renard puts Hank into protective custody and tells Nick to trace Stark's movements.

Evidence of Stark is found nearby where Hank used to live and Nick and Capt. Renard rush over. While they investigate the area, Stark watches from afar to see if Hank will appear. Nick begins to sense something... like someone is watching him but when he turns, no one is there.

Nick heads to Aunt Marie's trailer and begins to see if he can find a creature that matches Stark's medical condition. Unable to find anything, Nick begins to look around. Inside the weapons cabinet, he finds a case and inside is a rifle with an engraving on how to use it.

Nick gets home and hears a noise outside which he attributes to raccoons but when he hears it again, he cautiously approaches the doors from where the noise came. When he gets close enough, Stark crashes through the window and begins to attack Nick. Stark demands to know where Hank is. He slowly closes in on Nick and as he does, Nick sees Stark's face change into a creature. Stark continues to pressure Nick who fights back demanding to know where Hank is. When Stark realizes that Nick is a Grimm, his anger amplifies and he is intent on killing him. Juliette happens to walk in as Stark is about to finish him off. Nick warns her to run and Stark goes after her. She flees to the kitchen to find something for her safety and as Stark follows her, she takes a pot of water that was boiling on the stove and throws it at him which his eyes. Unable to see clearly, Stark stumbles out of the house as Nick tries to guns him down.

At the hospital, the doctor tells Captain Renard and Juliette of Nick's condition, saying that he has bruised ribs, a dislocated shoulder, and a mild concussion, but no broken bones. The Captain assures Juliette that Nick will have round the clock protection, as will she. Nick begins to realize how dangerous being a Grimm can be and how close Juliette was to getting hurt. After she leaves, Nick calls Monroe and tells him what happened.

Sgt. Wu informs Hank of what happened to Nick. Angry, Hank decides to take matters in his own hands but instead Wu devises a plan to get Stark using Hank as bait. They realize Stark attacked Nick to draw out Hank so he decides to bait Stark by visiting Nick at the hospital.

While Monroe visits Nick, Nick describes to Monroe his attacker. Monroe is able to identify him as a Siegbarste (otherwise known as an ogre) and tells him they are very rare but the worst of their creature kind. Apparently, he once had a childhood friend named Freddy whose father was brutally murdered by one, and that Nick was very lucky to still be alive. They carry grudges and are very hard to kill unless you have Siegbarste Gift (a poison) which was very rare. It calcifies an ogre's bones so that you can shatter the ogre from the inside out. The trick is to get it into the ogre. Nick remembers there was a bottle in the trailer labeled as such and the rifle in the case was made to get it inside them. Nick asks Monroe to get the poison and rifle for him.

As Monroe gathers the items needed to fight Stark, Hank goes and visits Nick. Stark is nearby and watches him enter the hospital. Hank tells Nick about the plan to ambush Stark but Nick tries to tell him that it won't work. It is then that Hank confesses that during the trial he ""misplaced"" bogus evidence that had the jury seen it may have given Stark a chance to walk. Although he and the assistant DA knew it was a set up by Stark, they didn't want to give the jury any reason for reasonable doubt and it became ""lost"" on its way to court. Hank tells Nick that he intends to stop Stark and instead of following through with the Captain's plans, he was going to lead Stark to the quarry where it all started. Nick calls Monroe and tells him to give Hank the gun but Hank had already left the hospital. Nick implores him to follow and somehow give it to him to use.

At the quarry, Hank confronts Stark and Monroe sees he's too late. He sees that Hank is aiming a rifle at Stark and knows that won't stop him. He opens the case and starts putting the Siegbarste Gewehr together. Monroe watches as Stark and Hank fight. As Stark is about to smash a piece of concrete over Hank, Monroe shoots and kills Stark, saving Hank who wonders where the shot came from. Monroe discreetly gets out of the area.

Monroe calls Nick and tells him that Hank is safe. Hank visits Nick and tells him that someone shot Stark but he doesn't know who did it. At the precinct, Captain Renard chastises Hank for trying to be a lone cowboy, then tells him that the bullets taken out of Stark's body were made in England over 100 years ago and was fired from a very old and rare elephant gun made for royalty. They both wonder who in the world would own something like that."
