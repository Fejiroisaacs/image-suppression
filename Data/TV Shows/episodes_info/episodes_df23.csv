https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0654536/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,"Reporter Tim O'Hara, while covering a flight of the Air Force X-15, finds a spaceship that contains a genuine martian. The martian is a professor who specializes in the planet Earth and now has to repair his spaceship before he can go home.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Sheldon Leonard'],[''],[],"['pilot episode', 'breaking the fourth wall', 'ufo crash site', 'ufo believer', 'nosy landlady', 'military secret', 'reference to flying saucer', 'alarm clock', 'surrogate uncle', 'woman wears a short nightie', 'character name in title']",[],"[ This is the very first (pilot) episode of this TV sitcom. ]

Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby), a newspaper reporter, is awakened in the morning by his three separate alarm clocks. But after he turns them off, he immediately goes back to sleep and takes the phone off the hook so he can't be disturbed. His angry newspaper editor, Harry Burns (J. Pat O'Malley) telephones Tim's next-door neighbor and landlady, Mrs. Lorelai Brown (Pamela Britton). Her phone is answered by her teenage daughter Angela (Ann Marshall), who takes the message. Mrs. Brown enters. Her visiting niece, Annabelle (Ina Victor), who is wearing a baby-doll nightgown, volunteers to wake up Tim, but her aunt reminds her that her nightie is too provocative to greet Tim, and brings her a robe to cover up. Lorelai and the two girls go upstairs to Tim's apartment. They knock on his bedroom door and he comes hurrying out. Angela tells him that his editor called and that he wants Tim to go out to Edwards Air Force Base to cover the test flight of the X-15, which has been moved up a day. Both girls seem to be romantically interested in Tim, but he seems to only have eyes for the older Annabelle. Mrs. Brown steps between them to head off any contact between the bachelor and her niece.

The scene cuts to footage of the X-15 rocket-plane detaching from the wing of a B-52 mother ship. It then switches to the interior of an Air Force control room, where a group of military men are monitoring a radar scope tracking the X-15 during its test flight. Suddenly, a second blip appears on the radar screen, and the radarman says it is on a collision course with the X-15 and traveling over 9,000 miles per hour. The pilot reports that something just went by him like he was standing still, and refers to the unknown object as ""a flying saucer"". This upsets the commanding officer, Colonel Whitehead (Herbert Rudley), who tells the pilot to stop talking nonsense. The Colonel says that he is just happy that the reporter (Tim) wasn't around to hear their pilot talking about flying saucers or to report that their radar is picking up ""things that aren't even there"". As the Colonel starts to leave, he encounters Tim just arriving, and the officer quickly escorts him out and bars the door, refusing to let him interview the pilot. Tim is curious about why there is so much secrecy for what is supposed to be a routine flight.

The scene cuts to Tim driving back home on a mountain road in the woods. He hears an unusual sound and looks up to see some sort of craft speeding across the sky, and he watches as it appears to crash. Leaping from his convertible sports car, Tim hurries down to the crash site, where he finds a small silver spacecraft. Examining the ship, he accidentally opens a hatch and discovers the unconscious body of a middle-aged man clothed in a shiny chrome flight suit. While he is checking for a heartbeat, the injured man wakes up and tells Tim that he is a professor of anthropology from the Mars, specializing in ""this primitive planet"". Tim doesn't believe him. The man says he crashed because he had to avoid colliding with the ""antique"" X-15, and is now marooned on this planet until he can repair his ship. Since the man from Mars is hurt, and hasn't yet adapted to the Earth's heavier gravity, Tim has to carry him back to the car.

The scene cuts again, back to Tim's house, where he arrives with the injured man sitting in the passenger seat. When Tim asks how they are going to get him inside without Mrs. Brown spotting them, the man suddenly sprouts two antennas from his head and vanishes, becoming invisible. While Tim is carrying the now-invisible man into the house, a small dog arrives, barking at them. The man from Mars says he'll take care of the dog, and immediately the dog stops barking, salutes, and walks away on its hind legs, amazing Tim. Mrs. Brown comes out of her house and asks what Tim is doing, and Tim improvises that he is ""pretending to carry an invisible man"", as he staggers up the stairs with his arms awkwardly held out in front of him.

Inside Tim's apartment, we see that he has put the man from Mars to bed so he can recover from the crash, and they have a conversation. When Tim asks the man how he could know details about Earth if he's from Mars, the man tells him that he is ""the greatest living authority on your planet"", and has visited earth many times, ""especially in the last 150 years"". Tim is flabbergasted, and asks if he has been here before why the visit didn't make headlines. The man points out that (since he looks perfectly human from the outside) unless he points it out, who would ever know that he's a Martian? He mentions meeting Thomas Jefferson. He says that humans are handicapped because we only use a small portion of our brain, while Martians use all of theirs. He says that humans are illogical and emotional, and that while Earth is all right for a visit, he wouldn't want to live here. And he says he will leave as soon as he can repair his spaceship. Tim tells him that he can't leave until Tim gets the news story and pictures, because he believes he will win the Pulitzer Prize with this story. But the man assures Tim that he would never be believed if he told people he had found a real-life Martian, and threatens to disappear if Tim brings anyone there to see him.

Suddenly, the man raises his fingers to his temples and tells Tim that ""there's a very attractive brunette walking up your steps right now"" and that ""she is thinking very warm thoughts about you"". Tim realizes that the Martian can read minds, and the man confirms this (""unless there is a conscious effort to shut me out."") Tim answers the door and Annabelle enters, carrying a newspaper (The Los Angeles Sun). The headline reads ""X-15 SMASHES RECORD - PILOT SIGHTS FLYING SAUCER"". The story has Tim's name as the author. As Tim and Annabelle embrace, he hears the man from Mars in his head warning him that he is about to have visitors. Abruptly, two men in suits barge into the house without knocking, frisk Tim, flash their credentials, and tell him the Air Force wants to know where he got his information on the X-15 flight. The men walk into the bedroom and find the Martian still in bed. They ask Tim who he is. Tim at first starts to say that he is a Martian, but quickly corrects himself to say that his name is Martin, and that he is his visiting uncle. As the two men take him away, Tim keeps quiet about the Martian's secret, but gives ""Uncle Martin"" some cash, in case he needs it, and unselfishly wishes him a pleasant trip home. Martin is impressed by Tim's kindness. Annabelle says she and her aunt will take care of him. Martin reads her mind and recites details about her Aunt Lorelai, pretending that Tim spoke with him about her.

Back at the Air Force Base, Tim stands before the angry Colonel who tells him that he isn't going to be freed until he reveals who gave him the information about the secret X-15 flight. Tim refuses to reveal his sources, and winds up behind bars. Uncle Martin suddenly appears in Tim's jail cell, having snuck in while invisible when the guard opened the cell door. He suggests that Tim tell them that he picked up their control center communications on his car radio, and offers a few made-up details that might convince the authorities to believe it. He disappears again when the guard returns to the cell. The guard is curious about who Tim was talking to, but Tim convinces him that he is a ventriloquist, demonstrating both voices (with the help of the invisible Martin).

The scene cuts back to Tim's house, where Tim gets out of a car driven by the Air Force authorities. The Colonel insists that it's impossible that Tim's car radio could have picked up their control center, but Uncle Martin has rigged Tim's radio so that it starts broadcasting what sounds like a conversation from the control center. They take Tim's radio from his car, threatening to send Tim to prison if they find any unauthorized equipment he has placed inside the radio to make it pick up their secret frequencies. But as the Colonel walks away, a concealed Uncle Martin trips him up (via a levitated garden hose), making him drop Tim's radio. It smashes when it hits the ground. During the confusion, Martin levitates away the special part he put in the radio that allowed him to create the fake control center broadcast. Tim realizes that Martin is behind the trick, and smugly smiles as the Colonel and his men leave.

Back in the house, Martin tells Tim that he didn't let him know in advance about the radio trick, because he wanted him to act naturally, so as not to arouse the Colonel's suspicion. Martin says he will need a number of very scarce items to repair his spaceship. Tim observes that it sounds expensive, and asks him where he will get the money to pay for the parts. Martin says he's been reading about Las Vegas, and suggests that with his ""special talents"", and Tim rolling the dice, they ought to do all right. Tim is reluctant, but Martin reminds him that with Martin 's mind-reading ability he could be extremely helpful providing inside information to Tim for his job as a newspaper reporter. The episode concludes with the two men agreeing to work together for their mutual benefit."

Teddy laments that his son can't hear the beautiful music and puts the headphones on him, turning the music louder and louder in an aggressive attempt to get Teddy to hear it.

Theo uses binoculars to spy on Charles, Oliver, and Mabel as they plan their next move. Later, he breaks in to Charles' apartment and takes a picture of their clue board, which includes his father as a prime suspect. He shows his father the picture and warns that the trio of podcasters is onto him. Teddy says that it's his job to look after Theo, not the other way around, and that he believes in the old adage of keeping your friends close but your enemies closer.

Oliver lures Teddy out of his apartment under the pretext of a lunch meeting about the podcast. While he's gone, Charles and Mabel break into the apartment. They find a hidden closet filled with urns from the Shine On Funeral Home. When Theo unexpectedly comes home, the two hide and manage to sneak out, although they leave behind one of the gloves they had worn. Theo flashes back to ten years earlier. Mabel and her Hardy Boys had broken into the apartment and Theo hid in the closet. Observing Mabel and her friends through a peep hole, he saw Zoe say that she thinks he's hot. She steals a ring and puts it on her finger. Theo makes a noise and Zoe sees the peephole and realizes he's watching. She discretely signs to him ""I meant it when I said you're hot"". On New Years Eve, Oscar and Zoe share an elevator with Theo and his father on the way to the party. Zoe discretely gropes Theo during the ride. When they get off the elevator, Zoe signs ""Happy New Year"" to Theo. Teddy sees the ring on her finger and confronts Theo.

While Charles is on a date with Jan, Oliver and Mabel attend a service at the Shine on Funeral Home. Seeing urns similar to those in the Dimas' apartment, they sneak into the basement and discover a secret storage room containing jars of jewelry and what appear to be gold fillings. Teddy comes down into the basement. Mabel and Oliver secretly observe him removing jewelry from a dead body. Teddy discovers them and they try to flee but find the door locked. Ten years earlier, at the New Years party, Theo observes Oscar and Zoe arguing. After Oscar leaves he goes and talks to Zoe, telling her that Oscar is no good for her. He asks for the ring back. Zoe signs that ""It's not like you proposed with it."" Theo replies that ""I'll get you a ring one day, if you want."" Realizing that Theo has feelings for her, Zoe laughs in his face, and apologizes for leading him on. When Theo advises her to stop trying to find happiness in other people she gets angry at him, signing that ""you're very confused about which way the pity flows here."" She angrily takes off the ring and gives it back to Theo. She begins hitting him and as he tries to restrain her he accidentally pushes her off the roof. A horrified Theo sees Tim looking on. A tearful Theo goes to his father, who asks him three questions: how bad is it? Are you responsible? Did anyone see you? Teddy confronts Tim Kono, advising him to stay quiet about what he saw or that he and Mabel might meet the same fate as Zoe.

Theo drives a van through the city. In the back are Mabel and Oliver, bound and gagged. He texts his father, warning Teddy that Mabel and Oliver know and have seen everything. Charles wakes up after having spent the night with Jan. There are a slew of text messages from Mabel and Oliver. Mabel tells him that the password to Tim's phone might be ""Theo"". Charles tries it and the phone unlocks. He says ""we did it."""

When there's no answer at his door, Oliver tries to break down the door and fails hilariously. Charles arrives from the symphony. Oliver and Mabel lay out their theory, but Charles rejects it, choosing to side with Jan and saying that he doesn't want to be part of their crazy theories. Mabel asks Charles to look at the evidence and she and Oliver leave. Realizing that Jan's apartment will be empty since she's at the symphony, the two of them decide to search it.

Jan arrives at Charles' apartment and apologizes for lying about being first chair. She and Charles sit and have a drink. She sees the bassoon cleaner on the table and asks about it. Charles tells her it was found in Tim's apartment. Jan wonders if Tim played the bassoon too and if the killer is targeting bassoonists. Then she asks if Charles thinks she's a suspect. Charles says that he doesn't but that Mabel and Oliver do. Jan and Charles confess their love for each other. Charles tells Jan that he'd love her even if she killed Tim. Jan comments that Charles isn't drinking as much as she is. He says he's not drinking at all, but merely taking stage sips, because the drink is poisoned.

In Jan's apartment, Oliver and Mabel find a box labeled ""Jan's toxins"" and realize that they were right: Jan poisoned Tim Kono. In Charles' apartment, Jan admits to killing Tim. She had met Tim in the elevator and had begun a sexual relationship with him since she is attracted to ""lonely men with a big age difference"" with her. The night of the murder, she had lured Tim to her place for a last drink, which she had poisoned. It was Jan's trash which Mabel, Oliver and Charles had seen Tim carrying that night. Charles realizes that Jan's bassoon had sounded different that night and that she must have used a recording to help give herself an alibi. Jan asks how Charles figured it out and he points out that the killer's handwriting matched that on a note she had left for him. Charles begins slurring his words. Jan says that she didn't poison the drink this time, but rather Charle's handkerchief. As Charles collapses on the floor, Jan talks about returning to Tim's apartment and shooting him as he lay dying from the poison. She says that this time she's going to do something more spectacular and opens the gas valve on the fireplace to flood the room with gas. As Mabel and Oliver head to Charles' apartment they encounter a tenant who complains of feeling dizzy. They realize that Jan intends to destroy the building to cover her tracks.

After Jan leaves, Charles rises from the floor, having exaggerated how incapacitated he is. Extremely woozy, Charles crawls to the couch and removes his phone from under a pillow. He had been taping the entire conversation, and has Jan's confession. Charles stumbles out of the apartment in an attempt to make it to safety and manages to get on the elevator. There he encounters several other tenants including Bunny, Dr Stanley, and Howard, but since they all hate him, they merely assume he's drunk and do nothing. Lester the doorman, assuming the same thing, but more solicitous of Charles' welfare, puts him back on the elevator and sends it up to his floor. Mabel and Oliver find him there and load the now immobile Charles into Oliver's dog stroller.

Traveling to the basement, they discover that Jan has rigged the gas system to explode and dismantle her changes. Jan arrives and holds Oliver and Charles at gunpoint. Charles stands up and delivers a moving and lucid monologue about his friendship with Mabel and Oliver. This turns out to be all in his mind, as Charles is still incapacitated and his speech is gibberish. Oliver rams Jan with the stroller and Mabel knocks her out. The authorities arrive and arrest Jan. Having saved everyone in the building from death, and caught the murderer of Tim Kono, the three friends enjoy renewed popularity among the tenants. Bunny arrives and tells them that their evictions will be rescinded, but promises to evict Oliver sooner or later. Mabel calls Bunny a ""cranky bitch"".

Some time later, the trio finishes the final episode of Only Murders in the Building. They celebrate with drinks on the building's roof. Mabel excuses herself and heads downstairs. As Charles and Oliver discuss their next move they hear sirens approaching the building. They get a warning text from an unknown number and race downstairs to find Mabel. They discover Mabel kneeling over a dead body in a tie-dyed ""Only Murders in the Building"" hoodie, an enormous bloodstain on her shirt. Mabel tells them ""It's not what you think!"" Rolling the body over, she shows them that it's Bunny and says that the woman stumbled into her apartment already dying. Oliver identifies the apparent murder weapon as one of Mabel's knitting needles. Just then, the police break in, holding all three at gunpoint. The police arrest the friends and lead them out of the building, past the scornful residents, a worried Oscar, and podcast host Cinda Canning. Cinda's assistant, who is taping audio of the events, says ""Coming next fall, 'Only Murderers in the building'."" Cinda steals the idea for her own."

He has some sleep paralysis from not being able to invite others. All the other people arrive. Eva Gutowski and Shane Dawson go and sneak off to look around. They see the maid dragging a body to a room, before being escorted back downstairs. The others ask where they were. They say they just needed to use the bathroom. The others are skeptical, but they continue with their dinner. They all have a small drink, before Shane finds out he's been poisoned. The group starts to find clues to find the antidote. The antidote is discovered to be dispersed between three bottles and they have a total of fifteen minutes to unlock all of the antidotes to save Shane. There are three puzzles and they are all spread out. Joey, Eva and GloZell Green find a key within a painting and unlock the first. The other two groups with the other two puzzles fail the time, ending with Shane's final death. Joey looks through Shane's pockets and finds a letter handwritten by Shane. They find out there is a dark magic throughout the house and the Society Against Evil put their symbol around the house for the clues. They find out one of them has to die in the end, but really, multiple people have to die for each challenge in order to have a couple people advance out of the house. They find out they have to gather artifacts. The episode ends with them trying to escape but the car they took blows up before they can get to it. So they had no escape out of the certain timeframe.

Justine Ezarik reads the invocation and they ask for the spirit to speak to them. The spirit spells out ""B-O-O-K-S"" through the Ouija board and they go find 8 different books all around the first floor. When they find the books, they also get a code and unlock a message in the hand that leads to a chest with chess pieces and they have to play on a chessboard in a specific arrangement. Once completed, they go to the Ballroom and find the Fire, Water, Earth and Air symbols that associate with the numbers necessary for a code. The code is 2358 and the cabinet is unlocked. The group finds out that they have to go to the Basement to unleash an Ungodly Machine. Unable to decide who goes down, Arthur suggests a vote, the results pulled out of a hat. The two voted to go down are Lele Pons and Andrea Brooks. Both have to choose a partner. Lele picks Eva Gutowski and Andrea picks Justine. Arthur leads them to the Basement. They must solve 3 puzzles. The aim is to drive the machine into malfunction. The first puzzle is to decode a blueprint and place the 4 levers on the machine either up or down in a specific pattern. The second puzzle is to unscrew a screw in a tube of iced water. The third and final puzzle is to rewire the control panel. Justine struggles throughout while Eva moves quickly. However, Eva gets stuck on the third puzzle, giving Justine time to catch up. Before she can finish, though, Eva gets the machine to malfunction and gets Lele out of her capsule. Andrea gets asphyxiated by the gas in her capsule. An artifact comes out and they go back up. Justine pleads her case and concludes that maybe Andrea should've died anyway, because she wasn't being of much use. The group accuses her of purposefully sabotaging Andrea. After Lele places the first artifact on the shelf, Oli White finds a note that says one among them is in league with the evil of the house. Everyone is suspicious of Joey."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5899844/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,The ritual to bind the evil failed and they soon realize that they did the wrong one. Matt and Sierra must go in the basement to try to exersize a demon.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Adam Lawson'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"The guests have all four artifacts. Arthur gives them a sheet. He says it's a ritual from Shane's jacket. They vote Sierra Furtado to do the centre artifact. She must wrap black coil around it seven times while Matt Haag does the invocation, but the ritual doesn't work. Joey and Timothy DelaGhetto find a black box with a key and a note. The note says the house is evil and the note's author is trapped in the back basement. They go to the basement and find David Santos. He says the house gains its strength from its five former owners. When they are freed, the demon will be weak enough to banish. He says he lost his faith when he could not exorcise a girl and they need to exorcise her to regain his faith and free him. The group needs a rosary and holy water for the exorcism. They go upstairs and split into two groups, to search the different rooms. Joey, Eva Gutowski and Oli White go into the guest room to get the rosary. Lele Pons, Matt, Sierra and Tim go to the window room to get the holy water. Joey's group find a cabinet that says REVELATIONS on it. They find seven demon names around the room. The names were RAUM, DANTALION, INCUBUS, XAPHAN, BELIAL and MOLOCH. On the cabinet are 13 devils and 1 angel. It is a reference to the verse REVELATIONS 13:1 in the Bible. They turn to this verse and are given the code and the cabinet opens. Now they have to arrange the names in alphabetical order. They do it and the rosary comes out. During this, both groups are scared by demons who know they're going to perform the exorcism. In the window room, the other group finds normal water and a note which says to look to Saint Peter and put the number of cups in the basin along with the dust of the tabernacle. They find the basin. Lele sees Roman numerals on the painting of Saint Peter and plus and minus signs. They solve the equation and are given the answer of five. They put five cups of water in the basin and find tabernacle dust in the envelope with the note. They put it in the basin and get the holy water. Both groups meet back downstairs. They find out they need to vote two people to exorcise the girl in the basement. Matt volunteers because he feels knowledgeable in the subject of exorcisms. However before voting starts, Matt says he made a mistake and doesn't want to volunteer. This angers the rest of the group. As a result, some of them vote for him. In the end, his name is drawn, along with Sierra's name. Sierra is scared as they go to the basement. Sierra has to say a prayer repeatedly while holding down the girl. If she lets go, she dies. Matt has to do three things. The last step will reveal itself to him. They go in. Sierra holds down the girl and starts praying. As Matt goes through his steps, which include placing candles into a star pattern on the floor and drawing an alpha and omega symbol, things start falling down all around the room. He is in a hurry and reads the first few words from the last step. It says to pour the holy water over the girl and place the rosary on top of Sierra. He does both those things. However, when he places the rosary on Sierra she dies. He is confused and reads it again. It says he could put it on Sierra and she would die or he could put it on himself, meaning he would die and Sierra would live. The girl gives him a cross. Matt goes back upstairs. The group is shocked that he killed Sierra and they go downstairs again. They give the cross to David. He is freed. The episode ends with them searching for the next owner."

It says the key to her room can only be opened by opening the world. They break two globes but there is no key. Fortunately, they find the key in a little gold world. They go upstairs and open her room. Inside, she is chained up. They find out she is a former owner. She says they need to get her daughter's doll to free her. She the tells them to weigh her husband's name in coins. They retrieve three bodies of her victims from the pool, which is guarded by her mermaid sisters. They need to play a song to lure them away. They go downstairs again and try finding the coins. They find a locked safe and use the spirit board. It says FLOOR. Eva Gutowski finds a vent on the floor that opens and finds the coins. Timothy DelaGhetto finds out that you put the names of her victims by counting the number of coins in how many letters are in their name on a scale. The weight is the code. They get the song to lure the mermaids then put a record player in the pool house and play it. The mermaids come out of the pool and go into the pool house. The group quickly locks them inside. They run to the pool. Joey and Lele Pons go into the pool and get the three bodies. There is also a chest they pull up. They must find something with the transformation of the moon's phases. They find turtle statues surrounding the pool with moon phases on them. They count them and get the code. Matt isn't helping since the exorcism. Everyone is mad at him for not helping. Inside the safe is a rock tablet. It says two guests must be chosen to do a challenge on the third floor in the doll room, which will haunt them forever. Matt and Tim are chosen. They go into the room. There is a doll house in each side of the room and tons of dolls around the room. They have to drink to know more. They both take a sip and a note comes under the door. It says they've been poisoned and they will get three nursery rooms. They have to copy with the doll that fits the description. They do it in their dollhouse. If they get it wrong, they will get more poison. If they get it right, they will get the antidote. They both finish and a vial of liquid comes out of both of their drawers. Matt says he's 100 percent sure he's right. He takes a sip of the vial he received. However, the vial turns out to be poison, which causes Matt to die. Tim receives a note that neither of them had the antidote and that it was on the back of the drawer. Tim gets the doll and goes downstairs. The others are happy that Matt is finally gone. Madison is given the doll and is set free. The remaining 5 can now find the next owner. The episode ends with Tim asking who the next owner is."

They all find out about a soldier who's obsessed with his gold. They receive a bar of gold and they head upstairs. They run into Collin, the soldier they read about. They give him the block of gold. He says he'll help them. Both Eva Gutowski and Lele Pons are attracted to him, without expecting he would be some old dude. Collin told them they had to leave because they were in a war zone. Collin had his gun and starts aiming out into the backyard. The other five huddle around the radio. They hear instructions and information and slowly head out into the backyard. There's a building and Collin gives Eva a grenade. He tells her to throw it into the window. Once Eva knows what to do, he pulls the trigger and she runs, scared it'll blow up in her face. She throws it into the building. It explodes and leaves the outside intact. All of them head over and get the briefcase. However, Collin starts smoking. Joey investigates the case, and tries to burn it with Collin's lighter. They find a code on the box and unlock the box. They find the key for the box of gold and have to go into a challenge. All of them go into little groups. Lele joins Joey and Timothy DelaGhetto, while Oli White joins Eva. Oli tells Eva that Joey plans on voting her in. Once voting was done, Eva and Tim's names were drawn. They go into the East Side Guest House and sit down across from each other. They hear the instructions from the radio about the challenge. It's a combination of Battleship and Russian Roulette. They have to set up their troops in their own strategic way. Each time one of them hit, they'd have to shoot themselves in the head. Tim went once, didn't get shot. Eva went once, didn't get shot. Tim went again and it went off. Terrified, Eva grabs the case with all the gold and runs outside, drops it and the key is on the ground. She asks Collin ""Was it worth it???"" Collin replies ""Yes"" in a hypnotized tone. Eva walks back to the estate. They all meet up again. The episode ends with them discussing about the next and second to last owner."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5965852/?ref_=ttep_ep9,,"The guests find another former owner of the house, Vincent; A schizophrenic who was driven insane by the house. They must dive into his hallucinations to find the three keys to free him from his straight jacket.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Adam Lawson'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"Months before the Guests arrived In a Sanatorium, a psychologist is using a Rorschach test to see how the mind of his patient is faring. As the patient talks about disturbing visions, he is shocked as a form of ""learning."" The testing continues on, with the patient getting shocked more and more as he describes his visions at length. His doctor does not believe in the hallucinations, and the patient, Vincent, slips the bonds of his chair, grabbing a scalpel and attacking the doctor where he sat, eventually making his way back to the Manor.

Present Day After placing the memento of Collin, the gold bar, on the mantle, the guests look in the Priest's notebook for the next owner, who was Vincent, with the clue being that he could be found in the attic, a floor they have not explored yet. Hesitating slightly, the Guests enter his room, finding Vincent inside, bound in a straitjacket. He told the guests that to free him from the house, they needed to face three of his hallucinations, and he gave them a map to the Manor grounds, the map showing them the three locations that they had to go through. The map led them to the Greenhouse, where they had to sift through the potted plants in order to recover body parts to create a ""Plant Man,"" all the while a zombie was reaching through the holes in the Greenhouse walls to scare them. Once the monster was created, it easily dispatched the zombie, and the guests claimed the first key. They were then directed to a circle of stones, where a masked swords woman stood, with masks hanging from the rocks around her. The guests had to find five masks that fit the riddle that was read on the inside of the mask, but if they got the wrong one, they were forcibly removed from the hallucination and had to wait for the others to return to the real world. They missed on the first mask, but had a second chance in exchange for the burlap sack that hid Oli's face. They got the next three right before picking another wrong mask, and Oli was forcibly removed from the hallucination. The remaining members found the next to last mask before realizing that the final mask was on the swords woman. They removed her mask, and all that she had were eyes: her ears, nose and mouth were gone. Having been unmasked, the swordsmen chased the group from her grotto and back to the house, where Oli rejoined them. They then found the last clue which brought the party back down to the basement for Vincent's most deadly hallucination. Each party guest put their own name into the hat to discourage any hard feelings, with Lele and Oli being chosen; Joey teamed with Lele while Eva teamed with Oli. They were brought down to the doctor's electroshock chamber, where two ""learning"" chairs were set up. Lele and Oli sat in the chairs while Joey and Eva tried to toss metal rings into the posts in front of the chairs. Every miss shocked the occupants of the chairs, and if one team did not complete before the time limit of a half-hour, both Lele and Oli would die due to the short-circuiting of the chairs. It was a hard fought duel, but in the end, Eva and Oli won, Lele's chair overloading and killing her. The three remaining guests brought the keys back to Vincent, unlocking the straitjacket and freeing him, not before Vincent called out Arthur, the chief of staff at the Manor. Vincent turned to Joey and said that he warned the group which leads back to a flashback from Ungodly Machine and Vincent's note. Arthur is in league with the evil, and as the episode closes, the guests are running for their lives."

Arthur narrates his flashback with his wife. He explains he is a confidence man, his current mark being his wealthy socialite wife. He is pouring tea. He secretly poisons hers. He serves her the poisonous drink, smiles and wishes her a happy anniversary with a toast. She sips and cries out in pain, succumbing to the tea as Arthur pulls off his wedding band and flips it onto her corpse. He walks over to the window of their bedroom and contemplates his next job when he receives a call from someone (presumably the Demon controlling the Mansion). He arrives at the mansion, intent on owning the cursed residence and controlling the evil within.

Present Day

The three remaining guests were captured by the house staff, terrified as to what has befallen them in the past 9 hours. Arthur finally reveals his greatest scheme: he needed the artifacts and the previous owners gone so he could control the house. As he gloated, he dropped the diagram for the TRUE ritual, the one the guests needed during 'Did Someone Call For An Exorcist?' being the wrong one. The staff proceeded to chloroform the guests and place them in the Torture Room which was hidden inside the Butler's chambers. Joey was the first to wake up from his drugged condition, followed by Eva Gutowski and Oli White. Joey was also the first to notice an ornate wood box next to him and a V shaped poker. However, the key didn't fit the lock on his box. Oli tried to use Joey's key on his chest. He then passed the poker to Eva. She was able to open her chest and free herself from her chains. She was also shouted at by a man who had gone insane who shouted nonsense at them. Once they were all freed, they opened one more lockbox, which contained a note, as well as a pocket watch. The note said that by sunrise at 6:00, if they didn't leave the house, the serum that injected them would make them complacent and turn them into servants in the house. They head into the Butler's Chambers. It had the key to escape the room and Arthur's police file and the first clue to the last puzzle. They take the clue to the first step of the puzzle and the diagram to the ritual. Joey led the way out of the Manor grounds. Their escape triggers an alarm that alerts Arthur and his accomplices. Arthur, Marvin and Sarah split up to chase the guests: Sarah patrolled the house, Marvin guarded the sides of the house and Arthur guarded the back. The guests had to remain out to sight to stay safe. If they were caught, they would die. They headed to the pool to look for the next clue to their puzzle. Oli remembered where another reflecting pool was: the fountain at the front of the house. The guests got away from Arthur and Marvin to secure the chest hidden in the fountain and three diamonds which fit the chest. After they opened the chest, they received two rubies. The clue told them to look for a winged guardian protecting the second floor of the house that overlooked the front yard. After discussing, they knew they had to get to the second floor and the gargoyle, avoiding Sarah. After a few escapes, they get to the gargoyle and insert the rubies into his ""eyes,"" unlocking the box for their next clue and the emerald for the offering. They had to walk up a ""spiral of pain"" to feed a demon who ""bathed in a pool of blood."" They deduced that they had to get to the spiral staircase in the back of the house and once again avoided capture. Eva was nearly caught, but they managed to retrieve the key to Arthur's brother's cell. They head to the wine cellar to free him. Arthur's brother wanted revenge. He was the FINAL owner of the house to be freed and went on a killing spree to free the guests from the horrific game Arthur made them play. Sarah was the first to be killed by him, followed by Marvin. Arthur wounded his brother but died as well. Revenge was done and Arthur's brother scared the guests back into the house to perform the ritual and finally escape the nightmare. Eva and Oli grabbed the artifacts and the sand, while Joey spotted the deed to the manor. He pocketed it so the house would not fall into the wrong hands. They draw the circle. Joey went into the centre to bind the fourth artifact. Oli read the spell. The ritual worked and the evil was banished. However, the guests had to move fast as they only had 5 minutes to bury the artifacts and leave. With their objectives complete, the three surviving guests left the house. As they left, Joey had a crack within his face and his eyes turned black, before going back to normal and finally walking off and that's where the episode ends."

But they all have less time than they think.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Uta Briesewitz'],"['', '', '']",[],[],[],"Evoking The Lord of the Rings, the series starts with a narration. Morraine Damodred, blue ajah of the Aes Sedai, explains that the Dragon has been reborn. The Dragon is the most powerful channeler, a type of sorcerer, to ever live, who has been prophesied to either save or break the world. It is the Aes Sedai's mission to find this Dragon before the Dark One does. Flash to two men fleeing on foot from mounted women dressed in red. They make for a narrow mountain pass, but before they can enter it, one of the women pursuing them appears to cause a rock slide that blocks the pass and nearly kills them. A blonde woman dismounts and approaches them. One of the men asks the woman to leave the other man alone. She informs him that the other man doesn't exist. The man turns, and sure enough, the other man is gone. She tells the man that he is already going mad. She tells him that the power he has is not meant for him. It is only meant for women, and what she is going to do for him is a gift. He begins to scream. Morraine Sedai and her Warder, Lan, are above the scene on a cliff, watching. Morraine tells Lan that this man is not the one they are looking for. She has heard that there are four ta'veren in a mountain region called the Two Rivers. She believes one of them might be what they are looking for. After the show's intro, we get to the real beginning of the series. On the banks of a mountain stream, a group of women are gathered. Two younger women are talking, one in a thin blue dress, one in green. They stand. After telling the other woman to trust herself, the woman in the green shoves the woman in the blue dress into the flowing mountain stream. The submerged woman struggles against the flow for a while before relaxing and allowing herself to float with the current. A tall young man with short red hair and an older one walk a mountain road. There is a disturbance in the woods next to the trail causing the young man to string an arrow to his bow, but it is only a rock rolling down the mountainside. The older man advises there have been wolves about, explaining their unease. The young man drops his bow and removes some rocks from the paths so that the horse drawn cart they are pulling can continue on. We move forward to the main inn for the village of Emonds Field. The older man and another are bringing in casks of brandy and mention that it is time for the Bel Tine Festival. There is quite a party going on inside. Three young men, including the red head from earlier, are sitting at a table with several women. The red-head's name is Rand. His dark haired friend Matt is holding court for a game of dice. Rand's other friend, Perrin, is a large man with short black hair and a ready smile. They obviously enjoy Matt's antics, but his luck has been bad and he is out of money. Matt informs us that Perrin is married and that Rand pines for a girl named Egwene. Matt then goes to join the young woman he was dicing against. As he does, the young woman in the light blue dress appears in the doorway to the inn. Everyone stands up and cheers. It is Egwene. She has her hair braided, which is customary for women coming of age. Older women grab Egwene to escort her to a drinking table. It is night and the party is stronger than ever within the inn. Rand watches Egwene as she serves patrons. Then a cloaked and hooded, and armed, stranger walks in and stands just within the doorway. Nynaeve approaches him and asks who he is. The man lowers his hood, revealing it is Lan, he names himself Lan Mandodragon and introduces Morraine, who walks in dramatically. The inn is completely silent with all eyes on Morraine. She walks directly to a woman who runs the inn and asks for a room. She flashes a large ring on her hand. The innkeeper sees the ring and tells Morraine - ""Of course, Morraine Sedai."" Morraine then goes to the fire and appears to warm herself. She turns and gazes at Matt, Nynaeve, and then Rand and Perrin before being escorted upstairs by the innkeeper. Perrin leaves the inn to find his wife, Dayla, who is working along at the forge. Dayla seems troubled. Perrin puts his hand on her belly and tells her he loves her. She Han Solo's him by saying - ""I know."" Matt finds his mother drunk outside. She is ranting about his father, who appears to be hitting on another woman. Matt carries his mother and puts her to bed. His two young sisters are there. He comforts them. Back the inn, Rand, Egwene and their parents are cleaning up the otherwise empty commons. The others conveniently leave so that Rand and Egwene finally get some alone time. They attempt to wash the dishes but don't get far before Rand catches her in a kiss and they begin to make out. Egwene is later sitting by the fire. Rand comes over with a bare chest. Egwene tells him Nynaeve asked her to be a Wisdom. That would mean never marrying. Rand is upset and leaves. Outside, a hooded figure on a horse approaches the inn. Its the next day and the peddler, Padan Fain, is rolling into town. Matt approaches him and wants to pawn a bracelet that we saw on the arm of the woman he was talking to last night. Fain knows it is stolen and gives Matt a couple lanterns for Bel Tine. Egwene finds Rand sitting on a rock overlooking a mountain valley. Rand tells her he always imagined his wife and kids when up there. Egwene begins to say she is going to be a Wisdom, but Rand tells her he already knows. She cries. Later Egwene is still crying while standing on a bridge. Nynaeve comes up to her and notes something different about the wind. Lan is walking the woods and finds slaughtered sheep in the shape of the male half of the One Power. Rand and Tam arrive back at their farm. They light their lantern for Bel Tine. The townspeople do the same in the stream. The lanterns are to help bring the spirits of those they've lost back. Dancing back in the town square starts afterwards. Everyone is having a good time dancing in pairs until a pack of Trollocs attack. Trollocs are eight foot tall combinations of rams and men. They ruthlessly begin to butcher the townfolk while everyone screams and scrambles for safety. Back at the farm, a Trolloc breaks in on Tam and Rand. Tam pulls a sword out and begins to slice up the Trolloc. Rand watches him, amazed. The Trolloc is able to pin Tam against the wall, however, and stabs him in the shoulder. Rand sticks the Trolloc from behind with a spear, and the Trolloc dies. Tam tells Rand to leave him, but Rand says he'll get Tam to Nynaeve. Chaos still reigns in town. Egwene and Nynaeve save an old man, only for him to die anyway. Perrin and Dayla shelter some people in the smithy, but two Trollocs break in and engage in a bloody fight. The Trollocs are both killed, but as Perrin is furiously hacking at his Trolloc, Dayla walks up to him and takes Perrin's axe to her chest. She dies in Perrin's arms. A Trolloc drags Nynaeve off to Egwene's horror. Egwene is in trouble until a weave of air from Morraine cuts the Trolloc attacking her in two. Morraine and Lan are in the middle of the town square and begin killing Trollocs: Lan with his sword, Morraine with weaves of Power. The battle looks over until a new fist of Trollocs appears. Morraine begins pulling stone blocks out of the inn to crush the Trollocs. Eventually, she gets them all, but the inn collapses behind her. The next day Rand rolls back into town with Tam laying on his horse. Egwene runs to him and embraces him. Egwene retrieves Morraine who heals Tam. Rand points out that the Trollocs arrived right after Morraine and Lan did. Morraine says that is because they are after the same thing- the four of them: Mat, Egwene and Perrin conveniently come near. The Dark One is waking. The Dragon has been reborn. Morraine believes it is one of them. Horns blare from the mountainside. It is another Trolloc army approaching. Morraine says the army is after the four of them. The only way to save Emonds Field is for the four of them to leave, immediately. They will go to the White Tower. Rand, Egwene, Matt and Perrin all mount horses and ride off with Morraine and Lan."

Nell and Julie are in the living room of the Kanisky home. Julie is standing on the living room table as Nell is fitting Julie's dress. The Chief enters and Nell asks why he is home in the middle of the afternoon. The Chief responds that he had some trouble showing the rookies how to ink the fingerprint pad as he turns to reveal a large ink stain on the right-hand side of his jacket. He asks Nell if she can remove the stain; she replies that she will need a pair of scissors. The Chief takes off his jacket to reveal another large ink stain, this one on his shirt. Julie comments that he had better change his shirt too.

The Chief ask them what they are doing. Julie tells the Chief that Nell is fitting her dress. The Chief comments disapprovingly on the length of the dress and mentions that it is revealing. Nell asks whether it is because one can see Julie's head and feet. The Chief motions toward the top and then the bottom of the dress. Nell responds that Nancy Reagan flashes more in church. Julie accuses the Chief of being old-fashioned, which he quickly denies. He says that he is a pretty with-it guy who does not like to see his daughter look like a hussy. Nell says that using ""with it"" and ""hussy"" in the same sentence is like putting a purple wig on Walter Cronkite.

Sam bounds down the stairs, greets the Chief, and comments on his shirt. She continues on to the television and turns on a soap opera. Nell mentions that she missed the last episode and Julie gives her a quick summary of the missed episode. Nell, Julie, and Sam sit together on the sofa and watch the show. A woman's voice from the television mentions a doctor's appointment and being ""six weeks late."" Sam naively asks whether the woman was six weeks late for her doctor's appointment.

The Chief comes down the stairs and is ready to return to work. He looks at the television and asks what trash they are watching. He reminisces about whatever happened to Kermit and Miss Porkie. Nell quips, ""Frankly chief, I don't give an oink."" Katie arrives home and asks what the chief is doing home. She asks if they have anything for an upset stomach and the Chief responds that they are probably having it for dinner. As the Chief leaves, he tells Nell that he would like to have dinner ready at 6 o'clock. She makes a witty response about how the meal items will be undone. The Chief leaves and Katie returns to the living room and says that she is not feeling well. Katie doubles over in pain and Nell takes her to the emergency room.

Hospital Scene

A man with his arm in sling is speaking with a nurse. Nell, Katie, and Sam arrive at the hospital and take a seat. Nell walks to the nurse's station and tells the nurse to call her a doctor; the nurse retorts ""OK you're a doctor."" Nell becomes impatient as the nurse delays getting a doctor.The nurse gives Nell forms to complete. Nell angrily shows a fist to the nurse and demands to see a doctor. A doctor walks out of a room and Nell asks for his help and he comes over to check Katie. He calls an orderly who takes Katie to an exam room by wheelchair.

Nell is upset and Sam asks her whether Katie will be all right. Nell comforts Sam and then returns to the nurse's station. She politely asks the nurse for the forms and a pen. Nell has Sam help her complete the forms. The man with his arm in a sling talks to the nurse about his wait. Nell returns the paperwork to the nurse who looks it over and says that everything seems to be in order. Sam asks Nell what they do next and Nell tells her to pray. Sam comments that she feels terrible that Katie is sick and that Sam had done a crummy thing to her. Nell inquires and Sam tells her that she took Katie's bra and stretched it out of shape while using it as a slingshot. Nell assures Sam that Katie will be all right.

They try to purchase a soda from a vending machine, but nothing comes out of the machine. Nell hits the machine and the soda flows without a cup. Nell tells Sam to go get some water instead of a soda, but Sam responds that she hates water because fish ""do bad things in it"" because they have no bathrooms. Sam departs and the doctor returns and Nell asks about Katie's condition. He wants Katie to stay overnight and continues that Katie took too many unnecessary risks at her age using an IUD for birth control. Nell is surprised by the news that Katie was using an IUD.

Nell wants to use the hospital pay phone to call home but a woman is on the phone and insists that Nell wait until she is done with her call. Nell tells the woman that she might have to have the phone surgically removed and then pleads with the woman who still will not give up the phone. The woman returns to her phone call and refers to Nell as some pushy woman to the woman on the other end of the call. Nell takes takes the woman's purse and puts it on a hook on a gurney which is being wheeled through the hospital and then draws the woman's attention to the missing purse. The woman chases purse and leaves the phone dangling. Nell talks to woman on phone that she never wants to talk to her again and then hangs up.

Nell calls Julie and tells her that Katie is all right. She asks if Julie got a hold of the Chief just as he arrives at the hospital and asks about Katie. Nell tries to get the Chief to relax, but he wants to know what is wrong with Katie. Nell convinces the chief to sit down for the news. She informs the Chief thatKatie is not sick afterall. The Chief presses Nell for more information. Nell asks about his feelings about birth control and then tells him that Katie is having a problem with an IUD. She explains that an IUD is an intra-uterine device and that Katie is having a problem with it. The Chief is incredulous and angrily leaves the hospital without seeing Katie.

Katie's Hospital Room Scene

Nell walks into Katie's hospital room after having taken Sam home. She brought Katie something to read. Nell tries to convince Katie to eat some of the food on the tray in front of her, but Katie says that she is not hungry.Nell comments on the appearance of the food and they discuss the contents of the plate. Katie says that it is some kind of meat., but not sure what kind. Nell lifts the entire scoop of mashed potates with a spoon and puts it back on the plate. Nell tells Katie to cheer up because she can go home tomorrow. Katie seems down and Nell asks her what is wrong. Katie asks about the Chief and Nell tells him that he was at the hospital but that he walked out. Katie says that she is glad that he is not there because she would not know what to tell him. Nell tells her that she has to tell him the truth and that she needs to be a woman, rather than just play a woman.

There is a knock at Katie's hospital room door. It is the Chief who arrives right before visiting hours are over. Nell exits after commenting on Julie and Sam's cooking. Nell attempts to offer the Chief advice then leaves. The Chief walks to the window and comments on the view. Katie asks what he can see and he says that he can see the Whole parking lot. He comments on an accident. He asks Katie if she is ok. He tells her that the doctor says that she can come home tomorrow and that the hospital visit is covered by his department medical plan. He then asks Katie how she could do what she did noting that she is just a kid. Katie says that in some cultures she could already have kids and that she did not want to get pregnant. The Chief comments that there are better ways such as never having sex on a first date and never going out with anyone twice.

Katie tells the Chief not to be be upset, and he responds that he is bordering on berzerk. They discuss her use of the IUD. The Chief wonders aloud What Katie's mother would say if she knew? Katie tells him that she did know and that they had talked about it before she died. The Chief cannot believe that she would approve of such a thing. Katie says that her mother was not crazy about the idea, but knew that she was not going to be around. The Chief wonders where he was for that conversation, and Katie tells him that they knew how he would react. He comments that she is 17 and that maybe he is old-fashioned. They discuss growing up, and the Chief says that sex was something special between two people.

The Chief moves next to Katie's hopsital bed. She tells him that she is not cheap and that it is not how he is making it sound. He comments on her youth, and she responds that there are some things that he cannot protect her from. She apologizes and says that she cannot stay a little girl forever. The Chief says that he does not want her to stay a little girl forever, only the next 30 or 40 years.

The nurse comes into the room and informs them that visiting hours are over.The Chief tells the nurse to ""go to a blood bank and suck on somebody's neck.""The nurse leaves and Katie tells the Chief that he loves her and the Chief returns the sentiment. The Chief tells Katie that he had better leave before the nurse, whom he refers to as ""the battle-axe,"" returns. The Chief and Katie embrace and the episode ends.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529897/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,Bones is called on to identify the body of a suicide bomber.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Allan Kroeker'],"['', '', '']",[],"['squint', 'secretion', 'remnant', 'slime', 'forensic entomologist', 'car', 'terrorist', 'terrorism', 'car bomb', 'bomb', 'exploding car']",[],"When a Middle Eastern diplomat is killed in a car bomb explosion, Bressan and Booth must determine whether he was a terrorist suicide bomber or a murder victim.

when a suicide car bomber kills 13, brennan & booth show up to pick up the pieces - literally - & gather evidence. cut to the lab, where hodges expounds on his conspiracy schtick - he refers to booth as a government stooge; booth, who had just arrived, says he no more likes having squints on his team than hodges likes having him around.

they have a tentative id - Hamid Masruk - but need more info; so they interview his wife & brother, sahar & farid masruk, who insist he would not have done this, as they are americans & love this country. they provide an envelope w/ some medical history. said medical history proves definitively that the driver was hamid.

brennan goes to booth's apt to tell him the news, where she finds him in a disheveled state w/ tess, a lawyer. they smooch & tess leaves, whereupon brennan sticks foot in mouth, saying she didn't expect booth to be in a relationship. he wants to know if she thinks there's something wrong w/ him.

booth, brennan & sahar get into a heated discussion about racial profiling; while brennan initially takes the hard line - saying that assuming he was a terrorist only makes sense since radical muslims have waged a war on the u.s. & their conclusion was only the result of the evidence - she ends by impressing sahar w/ her knowledge of & respect for muslim burial practices. & booth, who initially took the pc line - no profiling going on here! - ends up saying after she leaves that he thinks sahar was having an affair. he & bones argue about this & his insensitivity re: women...angela agrees w/ booth.

meanwhile, back at the lab...they're finding that hamid either had a medical condition or was exposed to a toxin that was causing some physical deterioration. bones does her usual clueless insensitive thing, & hodges complains that w/ all his knowledge, intelligence & degrees, she can still make him feel inferior. zack says she apologized to him...hehehe

b&b meet w/ farid, who says he is a christian, which caused friction between the brothers. booth says sahar was having an affair, & farid sort of agrees, saying he tried to help keep their mariage from falling apart.

back at the lab again, angela gossips about booth's relationship w/ tess & says bones is attracted to him. there is some discussion as to whether this intrusion into booth's personal life is inappropriate...no, she says, & so what? hodges says something about gypsum trace in the evidence...what does this mean? stay tuned..

the guy having the affair w/ sahar - Ali Ladjavardi - says they love each other & he knows nothing about a bomb. the government agent w/ him says he's clean & a mole for his agency. the agent & booth argue about what that has to do with his guilt or innocence...this is, of course, rhetorical, as there is no clear resolution to this argument.

in the car, b&b get into a theological discussion, which goes nowhere, then a discussion of the dead, again nowhere...basically they agree not to talk about such things, because they can't agree...silence ensues...until hodges calls w/ news from the lab. more discussion back at the lab about the medical condition of hamid & maybe farid...dioxin poisonoing is the culprit, but why? again, stay tuned

angela stalks tess, trying to ascertain the status of her & booth's relationship. she says tess is not secure in the relationship, citing several obscure observations to back up this supposition. the question arises...is she spying for bones?...NO, of course not! booth enters & everyone clams up, making booth suspicious about their conversation. there are some beetles in the evidence; if they also ingested the dioxin, then the squints can extrapolate a timeline - you are what you eat, after all. unfortunately, this means the beetles must be sacrificed for the greater good, which makes zack sad...they have names!

done & done...the beetles were poisoned by dioxin. which means they can indeed get a timeline & angela needs to reconstruct hamid's face, all of which has something to do w/ proving where & when the bomb was made. high dioxin levels in the beetles/hamid & angelas reconstruction show initial dioxin contact was about 4 months ago. they go to see ali, the affair guy; booth is concerned b/c he was told to stay away from him, but bones says she was not. he is indeed angry & starts to call his agent friends, whereupon bones throws him to the ground, placing her boot on his throat, thereby getting him to talk, albeit hoarsely.

hodges & zack determine that gypsum is the key to finding the building where the bomb was made, & hey, find the building, find the bomber, right? right, & b&b are once again in the car, arguing whether the wife is the perp & did she poison both hamid & farid to hide her affair? bones uses booth's relationship w/ tess to debunk booth's theories. booth gives up & tells bones she needs to stop using words like segue & eschew & wants to know why she's so obsessed w/ his sex life, at one point implying it's b/c she hasn't one of her own. hodges calls w/ the info that the building where the bomb was made is near the brother's (farid's) apt. they arrive there to find bomb-making supplies & a prayer rug...HAH! he's no christian, the lying so-&-so. hodges tells bones that the amount of chemicals missing would make a bomb w/ a very large dispersal area & that the long-term effects on the public would be very nasty indeed.

the squints are checking bus schedules to figure where farid may be going...aha! there is a peace conference at the hamilton cultural ctr, so b&b are on their way. so why, you may ask - & they do - did farid kill his brother? well, hamid's poisoning was becoming apparent & would tip off whomever that he'd (farid) been messing around w/ bombs, & that just would not do.

b&b arrive at the center, arguing abt shooting farid w/o knowing for sure if he has the bomb...bones for, booth against. they see him, & bones pushes for shooting him, giving some convincing arguments, but booth still hesitates...after all, he's the one who'll be responsible if they're wrong...oops, my bad. it becomes apparent to even booth that he has no other choice. a bullet in the forehead later, the evidence proves them right.

b&b are in a bar later, discussing the philosophy of what happened, w/ booth finishing by saying that killing is not a reason to celebrate. bones tells him he should go home, that tess will worry. he leaves, she stays. alternating scenes of bones back in the lab & booth having dinner w/ tess indicate the events fester. we see bones cataloging the remains of one william donohue w/ the dates 1900-1918...what does this mean?"

In need of back-up, he brings on a talented young chef to help.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Christopher Storer'],"['', '', '']",[],"['bear', 'dream sequence', 'overdue bill', 'montage', 'debt', 'arcade video game', 'bleeding finger', 'finger cut', 'cut finger', 'mass brawl', 'firing pistol', 'video game tournament', 'season premiere', 'series premiere']",[],"Carmen Berzatto, also known as Carmy or Bear, is a highly talented chef who was awarded the James Beard Foundation of Rising Star Chef of the Year. He comes home to his family's restaurant in Chicago, called The Original Beef or The Beef, which is willed to him after his brother's abrupt death - Michael, who is commonly referred to as Mikey. The restaurant is struggling heavily on finances, is lacking infrastructure, and has a team of uninspired cooks. Carmy must reorganize every system to avoid its imminent closure. An alarm wakes him up from a nightmare involving him releasing a caged bear that ends up attacking him. He is greeted by a delivery driver who delivers a small portion of his meat order due to lack of payment.

While speaking to an older Hispanic Chef named Tina, Carmy has an idea to host an arcade tournament to boost sales in the restaurant, but is required to find alternative ways to source his ingredients. He calls in favors from his friends in the restaurant industry but finds himself trading most of his vintage denim jacket collection in exchange for meat. He promises to trade a jacket that was gifted to him by Mikey, which pains him as it is one of the last reminders of his brother.

As Carmy is given different cuts of meat than usual, he changes the cooking method which takes longer. Tina ridicules Carmy for his fine-dining workflow and is confused when he refers to her as ""Chef"". Carmy is so overwhelmed with work that he forgets that he organized an interview with a highly skilled, young chef named Sydney, who applied for the Sous Chef position. Sydney has a culinary school education and has worked at many renowned restaurants in Chicago which baffles Carmy that she would want to work in his run-down sandwich restaurant. Sydney refers to Carmy as the most excellent Chef de Cuisine in the most excellent restaurant in the entire United States and wants to learn from him. In the meantime, she is a stagiaire who is an unpaid intern so they can learn how the restaurant operates and to be evaluated. Her first duty is to cook the pre-service family meal for the staff.

Ebraheim is an older chef from Africa who is a part of the team. He becomes frustrated with Carmy's new systems and is reluctant to embrace change. It is clear that Carmy is unfamiliar in this environment and lacks the respect of his colleagues. Even Sydney has a hard time establishing herself as the other chefs bully her.

Carmy checks on Marcus, who is in charge of making the bread but is struggling to meet quotas due to equipment being broken.

Gary Woods is a front of house staff member who also handles miscellaneous tasks throughout the kitchen. He is also known as Sweeps, as he swept the St Louis baseball team three times and had a no hitter.

Richard Jeremovich, also known as Richie, colloquially refers to himself as Carmy's cousin. He also pretends to have an Italian heritage, much to Carmy's chagrin. He was also Mikey's best friend and worked alongside him as an unofficial assistant manager at The Beef.

Richie arrives to work late due to having shared custody of his child and berates Carmy for changing the systems. Things become personal when Richie blames his own divorce on supporting Carmy's family before and after Mikey's death, as Carmy was absent. Carmy responds by asking Richie why Mikey didn't leave him the restaurant instead.

As Carmy has been frustrating his staff, they retaliate by sabotaging his equipment which forces him to use the dull house knives. Carmy continually educates his chefs on new restaurant lingo, techniques and efficient workflow. He is also chastised for removing spaghetti from the menu, which was very popular among guests. After a heated argument, Richie takes control and orders the kitchen to ignore Carmy's instructions.

Neil Fak, commonly referred to as Fak, is one of Carmy's closest friends and does freelance maintenance work at the restaurant. He points out that Carmy has been bleeding from accidentally cutting himself during preparation. As Carmy rushes back to the kitchen for first aid, he bumps into Ebraheim carrying a tray and is unable to control his temper.

As he calms down, he stares at a framed picture that he drew which is a concept for a fine-dining restaurant. When attempting to commence a pre-service team meeting, he is unable to get their attention and is overshadowed by Richie telling a story.

Carmy takes a break to collect Mikey's jacket from his sister, Natalie, also known as Sugar. She is uncomfortable being around the restaurant due to bad memories and is hurt that Carmy has abandoned their family in recent years. She urges Carmy to sell the restaurant, but Carmy is adamant in fixing it. When going through Carmy's books, Marcus stumbles across his awards. When he also receives feedback from Carmy that improves his own workflow, he gains a newfound respect.

Carmy gathers the team to try his new method of braising beef where everybody loves the flavors, but Richie refuses to acknowledge him.

Sydney is also eager to impress with her beef stew served with rice, plantains and fennel salad as the family meal. The team has a nice bonding moment where they show gratitude and have banter. Meanwhile, Carmy attempts to calm down the crowd queuing up for the arcade tournament, but is assaulted in a brawl. Richie breaks up the scuffle by firing a gun into the air and takes control of the situation with his authoritative demeanor. As Carmy realizes that he is unprepared to run this restaurant by himself, Richie orders him to stick to the status quo and cook the spaghetti. When Richie is alone, he finally tries Carmy's beef sandwich and quietly remarks on its brilliance.

As Carmy begins to open a can of tomatoes to prepare the spaghetti, he changes his mind and throws it in the trash."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16953538/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,A surprise health inspection reveals the cracks in the restaurant's foundation. Carmy goes head-to-head with Richie.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Christopher Storer'],"['', '', '']",[],"['montage', 'debt', 'flashback', 'abusive boss', 'new york city', 'health inspection', 'health code violation', 'smoke break', 'cigarette smoking', 'cleaning a kitchen', 'health inspector', 'uncle nephew relationship', 'telephone call']",[],"A year ago, Carmy was the Chef de Cuisine at a prestigious fine dining restaurant in New York. He was in charge of a large team who heeded his every command in a silent and orchestrated kitchen. He is seen cleanly shaven, hair slicked back, dressed in impeccable chef whites and is highly focused while plating refined gourmet dishes. A line chef brings Carmy a broken sauce and he politely asks for a new one. When she presents with a second broken sauce, the Executive Chef intimidates her before sending her home. The Executive Chef then torments Carmy for his poor judgment, work ethic, and attacks his personal insecurities. He relentlessly insults Carmy, diminishes his self-worth and triggers his anxiety. Carmy endures the abuse without retaliation and suffers in silence.

At the present day at The Beef in Chicago, Carmy's kitchen is in squalor, his cooks ignore his requests and the environment is very noisy. His current surroundings are a stark contrast to the high level of operation he was accustomed to in fine dining establishments. After service, the staff commence a deep clean of every surface using toothbrushes. Carmy attempts tell stories of his time working in Michelin-starred restaurants, but is dismissed by his staff as being pretentious. Carmy retaliates by saying that he wanted to work at The Beef, but Mikey did not allow him to. After news of the ice cream machine being broken, the staff begin to realize the sources of waste and lost revenue.

As everyone heads home, Carmy stays behind to finish the cleaning. He then goes home late in the evening to an unhealthy dinner of peanut butter and jelly sandwich and junk food. He falls asleep watching a cooking channel and wakes up from a nightmare to find he has been cooking while sleepwalking and has started a fire. Carmy finally acknowledges that he has deep-rooted underlying issues that need to be addressed and that he cannot sustain his current lifestyle without assistance.

After a week, Sydney tells Carmy that she would like more responsibility at The Beef and prepares a business analysis document that outlines improvements and cost-saving measures. She also advocates for a food delivery system which Carmy immediately dismisses. Before they can discuss it, he is interrupted by a surprise health inspection. The usual care-free health inspector has passed away and the replacement inspector is more strict. Richie is hostile towards her while Carmy allows her full access to the restaurant.

Sydney resumes her incessant business proposals which frustrates Carmy. Once again, they are interrupted by the health inspector who discovers violations of structural damage, cross contamination and lack of hot water access for hygiene reasons. The worst offense is that a pack of cigarettes was left on a stove-top. The Beef is then awarded a C grade from the health department. Despite their pleas, the health inspector cannot re-evaluate the restaurant for at least 30 days. Carmy is infuriated and immediately blames Richie where they have to be separated from an altercation. As Richie has an expired driver's license, Sydney is then pressured to drive him to the hardware store to find materials to fix the restaurant. Richie goes on a rant and reveals to Sydney that he is not related to Carmy and is only a close family-friend. He also reveals that Mikey committed suicide by shooting himself in the head four months prior.

Back at The Beef, Carmy has a meeting with his Uncle Jimmy, also known as Cicero. He is the key investor who provides financing to the restaurant. Jimmy encourages Carmy to give up on the impossible task of fixing the restaurant and to sell it. He then reveals that Mikey borrowed $300K from Jimmy based on false promises and that it mysteriously disappeared and was never paid back. Carmy is reluctant to sell the restaurant, then assumes Mikey's debt and assures that he will pay it back.

Sydney and Richie continue to argue where she tries to convince him that the restaurant has potential for culinary success and expresses her admiration for Carmy. They are interrupted when Richie's ex-wife calls him in regards to their five-year-old daughter being upset when starting at a new school. He then tries to comfort her through the phone. Upon hearing this, Sydney pities Richie and is able to fix his mistakes at the restaurant without being asked.

When Sugar doesn't pick up her phone, Carmy calls Pete, who is Sugar's husband. Pete seems flustered and tries to avoid conversation, but Carmy apologizes to him for a previous altercation. Pete brushes it off and hands the phone over to Sugar. Pete only refers to his wife as ""Nat"" and never ""Sugar"" which implies that he has a different relationship with her than her immediate family. Carmy tries to process his erratic behavior and his sister suggests that he should attend an Al Anon meeting which is a support group for family members of those with substance abuse issues. Carmy makes snide remarks about Pete, but Pete is never offended due to his good nature and people-pleasing tendencies. Sugar shows genuine concern about Carmy's shortness of breath, nausea and sleepwalking. He reveals that it began during his time in New York, presumably due to the torment from his overbearing Executive Chef. Despite being abused, Carmy admits that he loved his high-stress jobs at fine-dining restaurants. Sugar urges Carmy to take care of himself and seek help.

When Richie is fixing the tile damage in the locker room, he discovers a letter that Mikey wrote for Carmy, which had dropped into a hidden spot. He contemplates whether to give it to Carmy, but decides to return it to the place nobody would see, thereby denying Carmy of closure.

When the dinner service starts, Sydney takes on the responsibility of expediting the orders and providing feedback to the staff. Ebraheim begins to adapt to the new system but takes time to fix his errors. Carmy thanks Sydney for her help and officially hires her as the Sous Chef. Richie and Carmy appear to be amicable again and find out that Jimmy was able to use his unethical connections to have an immediate reassessment from the health department.

When Carmy has a cigarette break, he realizes that he was the one who left the packet of cigarettes on the stove-top and had forgotten about it. This is the impetus for him to finally seek help and attend the Al Anon meeting."

Sydney struggles to gain the respect of the staff.,[],TV-MA,Release date,['Joanna Calo'],"['', '', '']",[],"['al anon meeting', 'montage', 'finger cut', 'cut finger', 'telephone call', 'reference to al anon', 'panic attack', 'sabotage', 'food preparation', 'voicemail message']",[],"Carmy walks around Chicago alone, mustering the courage to attend the Al-Anon meeting for family members of drug and alcohol addicts. At the meeting, a woman gives a speech acknowledging that she was not a victim and that she could not change her alcoholic husband's chaotic behaviour. She blames herself for contributing to her husband's alcohol abuse. However, it made her realise that she had to remove herself from any situation that could become toxic. Carmy listens intently as he ponders his own situation at his restaurant.

During a very busy lunch service at The Beef, Richie is infuriated and yells at the staff for missing the orders. Sydney retorts that they are behind on schedule due to Richie not helping in the kitchen and not inputting the orders through the Point of Service system. The long queue of diners awkwardly wait in line as the staff bicker and Carmy is unable to de-escalate the situation. Marcus also contributes to the noise as he complains that somebody has taken his tray of bread, but Sydney reassures him that she had already prepared them for him. Carmy also realises that his team is disorganised and do not have sufficient ingredients prepared for service.

After a long day of work, Carmy takes the elevated train home and wakes up from his short sleep, still exhausted. He reads an Al-Anon pamphlet that emphasies that he needs to forgive, be honest, be humble, avoid tension, find hobbies, and to keep doing his best despite failing. Importantly, it advises Carmy to frequently attend support meetings.

As Carmy cannot sleep, he returns to the restaurant to find the walls plastered with pictures of desserts that were on the menu in his previous restaurants. Marcus explains that he put the pictures on the wall as inspiration. Sydney then joins them. Carmy explains the process behind making a plum dessert that took the labour of 12 people. It involved a reduction of plum wine; a plum consommé made of black plums cooked in black vinegar, salt, and sugar; compressed plums of thinly sliced squares of plum that are vacuum sealed with the plum wine reduction; and a gelee that had a thick and squishy consistency which was difficult to achieve. Before Carmy can explain how the gelee was made, Sydney answers first that it was made with veal fat which impresses Carmy.

As Ebraheim walks by, Carmy asks why his brother Michael ordered the smaller 28-ounce cans of tomatoes instead of the larger and cheaper 102-ounce cans. Ebraheim admits that the more he learns about Michael, the less he understands about his decisions.

In the office, Carmy requests that Sydney implements a French Brigade system for The Beef, which would involve a hierarchy of staff. Sydney respectfully declines as she thinks the system will fail and is already struggling to gain the respect of her colleagues. Carmy ignores her feedback and insists, as he desperately wants to change his toxic environment. He states that he will run the administrative business while Sydney runs the kitchen. Sydney reluctantly agrees.

Carmy calls a team meeting and hands out matching aprons to the staff, where some are resistant to conform. He acknowledges his staff's current workflow and wants to organise it rather than change it. Meanwhile, Richie interrupts the meeting and undermines Carmy's authority by making fun of him. Sydney unconfidently explains the systems and delegates the roles. Tina continues to pretend that she does not speak English whenever she wants to avoid responsibility. Despite it, she is assigned the Gard Manger role who takes care of cold dishes and garnishes. Ebraheim is assigned Chef de Partie and his role is to prepare meats; he accepts the role graciously.

Carmy answers the phone which had been ringing constantly, only to find out that it is somebody named Nico was wanting to speak to his deceased brother. He then tells Richie who offers to take care of the situation. Carmy has a panic attack as he felt like his brother was still alive but faces the grim reality that he is dead.

In the meeting, Marcus is assigned to be Pâtissier and suggests that they outsource the bread so that he can begin making desserts. He admits that he does not yet have the skills but is eager to learn. Sydney assigns herself to the Sous Chef and Saucier positions where she makes stocks, sauces and gravies. She assigns Richie to an ambiguous role as nobody knows what he truly does. She also implements daily pre-service meetings, front-of-house walkthrough and an end-of-day review for feedback to promote a more efficient workload. Carmy barges through the kitchen and abandons the team to attend an Al-Anon meeting.

As the chefs adapt to their new roles, Sydney shows signs of stress by briefly hiding in the walk-in fridge. During her walkthrough, she reprimands Tina for not following the system and for insubordination. Ebraheim's duty is to cook the family pre-service meal that does not use too many pots. Ebraheim makes Chicken Suqaar, a dish from Somalia. As she scorns Marcus for being distracted in the kitchen, she accidentally cuts herself on an improperly stored boxcutter. Tina feels resentment toward Sydney and secretly sabotages the veal stock by turning the heat from low to high.

As Carmy returns to the restaurant a few hours later, he sees Richie making a surreptitious deal in the alleyway but ignores it. In Sydney's absence, Carmy does his own walkthrough and discovers the pot of boiling stock. He then chastises Sydney for her lack of technique despite her explaining that she left the heat on low. Richie exacerbates the situation by giving negative feedback. Sydney proposes to use the ruined veal stock to make a jus, but Carmy orders her to further reduce it into a demi-glace. He also yells at her for not preparing the onions and ignores that it was originally Tina's duty. With a domineering attitude, he expects her to submit without resistance, which frustrates her. As Sydney hastily prepares a large amount of onions, her previous cut reopens through her glove.

Sydney does another walkthrough where she takes out her anger by providing unconstructive criticism, and unclear instructions to clean the stations and lowboy fridges. She also rebukes Gary for the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant. Sydney then provides passive-aggressive comments on the quality of Marcus' bread. She returns to her station and panics when she discovers that her prepared onions have gone missing. She asks Richie, the staff and Carmy, but nobody knows where they have gone. Carmy states that the other chefs take her preparations as a part of her paying her dues.

Marcus returns with the cambros of Sydney's prepared onions and states that he hid them as a prank. This infuriates Sydney and she swears at the staff. In her anger, she rejects help to reach a heavy container of veal stock stored on the top shelf of the walk-in fridge. As she does not have a ladder or proper manual handling techniques, the container drops onto the floor, wasting a significant amount of stock. Marcus sees it, immediately helps her clean it up and provides reassurance.

Back in the office, Carmy reviews the finances of the restaurant and is confused at Michael's bookkeeping systems.

Sydney attends to the open wound on her finger and Marcus quietly offers a truce. As Sydney sits outside by herself, Carmy brings her a plate of the family meal and urges her to explain her behaviour. Sydney provides feedback by saying that Carmy allows the staff to have a poor work ethic while only yelling at her. Carmy admits that he holds Sydney to a higher standard and to remind her that being a Sous Chef is about following orders. Sydney also says that Carmy's inability to listen to feedback himself was a point of friction. Her rationale for wanting to work with Carmy is to be able to utlise her skills to make the restaurant stand out. She refuses to work at other establishments with a lack of creative freedom, or to resort to working at a brunch restaurant. Carmen acknowledges his fault for leaving the restaurant and reveals to Sydney that he attended an Al-Anon meeting due to his brother being a drug addict. He tries not to use it as an excuse.

Carmen has been ignoring help from his sister and finally listens to the voicemail which states that it was supposed to be Michael's birthday. Carmy continues to spend time alone as he walks through the coast of Chicago and stares across the empty ocean."

From the batter being mixed, the icings being made, donuts being deep fried and dusted in sugar and glazed, then garnished before being displayed at the front. He is gaining inspiration after accepting more responsibility to become the Pastry Chef at the Beef restaurant.

At the restaurant, Carmy and Richie load up the car for a catering job at a children's party in order to pay off the debt that Michael had accrued to Uncle Jimmy. Richie attempts to put a small shirt on an oversized inflatable hotdog. Carmy does not see the humour in Richie's actions and states that he does not want his legs broken by Uncle Jimmy. Richie is reluctant to help out as he states that he would be set back on his administrative duties at the restaurant. Carmy laughs at Richie incredulously and they have a tussle which ends up popping the inflatable hotdog.

Marcus revels in his new duties of being able to bake a chocolate cake instead of having to bake bread. He asks Sydney to try his cake and she is impressed which means a lot to him. Sydney checks in on Tina to ensure that she understands the new procedures and recipes, but Tina remains stubborn and disregards her advice, especially to ensure that the heat is not too high. Sydney tries to relate to Tina by explaining that her duty is to follow somebody else's orders and understands the struggles of being a woman working in hospitality. This does not make an impression on Tina, who argues that she has more experience in the kitchen than Sydney has been alive.

As Carmy and Richie drive to the birthday party, Richie tells Carmy that Uncle Jimmy has moved houses since Carmy was last in Chicago and that they have been going the wrong way. Richie brings up the deep-seated animosity between him and Uncle Jimmy and states that he hates being called Rick. He tells Carmy that he will keep the peace. However, when they arrive, Richie and Uncle Jimmy immediately get into a heated argument about a previous work incident where Richie is blamed for not picking up the phone and losing a contract. Uncle Jimmy also lauds over Richie that he always has to do him favours, then ends the argument by calling Richie ""Rick"".

While Carmy is slicing oranges, an elderly family friend mistakes him for Michael, who had committed suicide. Richie continues to rant about Uncle Jimmy, stating that he feigns his Italian heritage and is actually Polish. Carmy rebuffs Richie by stating Richie is also feigning an Italian heritage. Before continuing with work, Richie chews on prescription anxiety medication and leaves the bottle on the table. Carmy is frustrated when he discovers Richie did not pack ketchup due to philosophical differences on what condiments should go on a hot dog.

At the restaurant, Marcus and Ebraheim discuss the perfect donut. Marcus' idea is a jelly-filled, bright purple, sweet and tangy combination. Marcus' roommate, Chester who is a designer, delivers a book of pantone colour references. Marcus has a goal to make his own perfect donut, as he is inspired by Carmy's plum dessert, and wants to serve it at the restaurant. Sydney supports his aspirations despite The Beef not having the necessary equipment.

Sydney checks in on the dish washers and asks their preferences for the pre-service family meal. Fak asks Sydney if he can have some food but is denied. Ebraheim compliments Sydney for inspiring confidence in Marcus but Tina remains unimpressed. Marcus continues to draw prototypes of his vision of the donuts. He also purchases two dozen different flavoured donuts to research their texture with Fak.

As Carmy walks through the house to find more equipment, he is warmly greeted by other family members. Jimmy's adolescent son is mad that the other children at the party are behaving wildly and opening his presents. Carmy is ridiculed by his family friends who are condescending toward his occupation in the hospitality industry. Pete, Natalie's husband, is also attending the party and immediately defends Carmy. He states that Carmy was the Head Chef at the literal best restaurant in the world. Carmy remains ambivalent.

As Richie continues to grill the hot dogs, Jimmy joins him to escape the mayhem that the children are causing. Richie and Jimmy are still upset at each other, but bond over a mutual hatred of Pete. Jimmy feels like Pete will report them to the police. When Richie has an awkward encounter with another party guest, Jimmy makes fun of him for his poor work ethic, especially for not answering his phone. Richie is adamant that he never received phone calls, so Jimmy reads a message from a client who states a phone number. Richie tells Jimmy that it was Michael's number and not his. Afterwards, they both bond over their mutual anguish over Michael's death.

In the restaurant kitchen, Tina is behind on her work and has ignored Sydney's instructions. But Sydney continues to provide feedback to use a salt bed when roasting the potatoes and to use a knife to peel the hot skins instead of a dirty rag. Marcus begins to make a frosting for his cake.

As Carmy is making hotdogs, Jimmy and Richie are laughing together. When Pete interrupts, the mood is ruined and Jimmy leaves immediately. Nobody laughs at Pete's jokes and are uncomfortable in his presence. He helps himself to Carmy's Ghostbuster-inspired Ecto Cooler drink. Pete makes a remark that all the children have suddenly fallen asleep in the backyard. As he continues to drink the Ecto Cooler, he yawns and becomes drowsy himself. He tries to compliment Carmy by stating that he followed all of Carmy's achievements while he was cooking in restaurants overseas. Pete also tells Carmy that Natalie was also proud of him and misses him a lot but that she resents Carmy for ignoring her. Before Pete leaves, he laughs at the inflatable hotdog with a shirt duct-taped onto it. When Carmy refills the container of Ecto Cooler drink, he realises that the bottle of Richie's anxiety medication was accidentally placed inside. Carmy is hesitant, but informs Jimmy of the situation. Jimmy is amused and instead of being angry, he compliments Carmy for bringing peace and quiet.

Back at the restaurant, Tina allows the pot of milk to boil over on the stove and has to dispose of it. She is immensely frustrated at herself. When she comes back, she sees that a new pot of milk and herbs are placed onto the stove. She is angry that Sydney has been watching her, but Sydney states that she does not have time to waste. As Tina finishes the mashed potatoes, she tastes it and is impressed at the new recipe.

As Carmy is cleaning up after the party, he sees a picture of his father and Uncle Jimmy from 1992. Carmy admits that he did not know his father enough to miss him. Jimmy states that he saw Carmy's father as more of a friend than family as they were of similar age and had similar problems. He says that it had been 20 years since the last time he had spoken to Carmy's dad because they had grown apart after Carmy's dad lacked a direction in life and career. After the seeing the success of the Ed Debevic's diner, Carmy's dad copied the trend and opened The Original Beef restaurant. Jimmy admits that he hates going into the restaurant due to bad memories and cannot understand why Carmy wants to fix it. He lacks faith in the restaurant's success. Jimmy tells an allegory of a near-miss accident during a road trip when Carmy's dad was launched through the windshield due to refusing to wear a seatbelt. He then tells Carmy that after catering the party, that he has subtracted $2000 from the original debt of $300 000.

At the restaurant, Tina doubts herself as she is asked to present the mashed potatoes. To Tina's surprise, Sydney compliments her food. This instils a confidence in her and she finally thanks Sydney. Marcus is in his own world as he garnishes his completed chocolate cake in orange zest. When it is time to leave the birthday party, Jimmy finally shakes Richie's hand and calls him ""Richard"" out of respect. Richie reciprocates. They find Pete sleeping in the living room and have to drive him home. In his intoxicated stupor, he thanks Carmy and Richie for being allowed to be a part of the family and creating memories. Richie refuses to acknowledge Pete, but Carmy apologises to Pete, presumably for the way he had treated him poorly in the past. Carmy and Richie arrive in the restaurant at night for the pre-service dessert during family meal which is Marcus' chocolate cake. Carmy personally compliments Marcus which makes him smile. Tina is exhausted while she eats her food alone and ponders the things she learned throughout the day."

The amber lights flashing through her window remind her of her failed solo-venture catering business of barbecued foods, called Sheridan Road Catering. She is haunted by memories of rejected bank loan applications, immense amounts of ingredients and herself as a young girl developing her passion for food.

As a part of her morning routine, Sydney takes anti-reflux medication. She accidentally bumps into the table in the cramped apartment which wakes up her dad. Sydney takes the train to the restaurant to find Carmy already there, developing a new dish. Carmy reviews Sydney's Cost of Goods Sold report and admits that she is right that they have poor averages on sales per table due to serving sandwiches during dinner service. The price is too low and barely covers labour costs. Carmy proposes a new dinner menu. Sydney wants to cook a braised short-rib with a risotto, as her variation on ""tongue and cheek"". Carmy is not convinced, but tells her that he will consider it.

Marcus interrupts as he tells them about The Noma Guide to Fermentation book. Carmy tells Marcus to get the cakes done quickly, as Marcus is distracted by his obsession with developing donuts. Marcus tells Carmy that all that is left to do is to bake the cakes. As Marcus carelessly tears off a piece of tape, Carmy instructs him to use scissors to create a clean edge. Carmy's philosophy is that all aspects of the kitchen must be maintained in order to have a neat presentation. Meanwhile, Carmy investigates a gurgling from the toilet. There is a sign above it reminding customers not to flush women's hygiene products. Before he is able to tell the team, the toilet explodes in his face and floods the restaurant. Sydney is adamant that they need to close the restaurant in order to clean up and make repairs. However, Carmy wants to stay open for lunch service. He also reminds Marcus to work on the cakes.

Carmy holds a demonstration on how to cook Chicken Piccata, but the new recipe with multiple steps frightens Ebraheim. Carmy reassures Ebraheim that the revenue from the new dinner menu will allow them to hire more chefs for more help. Carmy finds himself having to alter his vernacular, as he realises that most of his chefs have not had a culinary school background to understand. Carmy starts by sauteing onions and garlic until browned, then adds capers and white wine to be reduced before deglazing the pan with chicken stock. He finishes the sauce by whisking in butter and adding seasoning with lemon juice and parsley. The sauce is then spooned on top of a chicken schnitzel. Tina is allowed to taste the dish and she is amazed by the flavours. Fak arrives at the restaurant to fix the leaking toilet and is monitored by Richie. Richie is overly critical of Fak and sexually harasses him. Fak then asks Richie for a job as a chef.

Chester, Marcus' roommate, is back in the restaurant while Marcus sets up a temperature-controlled chamber for fermentation. Marcus admits to Carmy that he does not know what he is doing and is learning as he goes. Carmy reminds Marcus again to work on the cakes and not to get distracted by his projects. Gary educates the dishwasher, Angel, about a baseball player Minnie Minosa and meticulously lists his statistics.

Carmy gives feedback to Tina on how to properly get a maillard reaction on the roasted onions. He asks her the last time Michael made Chicken Piccata for her. Tina tells Carmy that it was during the family Christmas Dinner at his mother's house. He also asks if his mother is still deranged, but Tina gives a diplomatic answer. Carmy exhibits signs of anxiety as he has bad memories of his family.

As Fak and Richie continue the job interview in the bathroom, Fak states that he graduated high school and brings the right attitude to the team. Richie insults his intellect and questions his other skills, to which Fak responds by saying he is able to play the keyboard. The argument escalates with Richie chasing Fak through the restaurant and tackling him onto the ground. Gary asks whether to break up the fight, but Richie refuses until Fak admits defeat by saying ""Matae"", a quote from a Jean Claude Van Damme movie, called Bloodsport. Carmy breaks up the fight by throwing water onto them. In a moment of exasperation, Fak tells Carmy that Richie has been selling cocaine at the back of the restaurant. This angers Carmy.

In the kitchen, Marcus has not yet started the cake batter and rushes through the steps. He dumps the unmixed batter into the stand mixer at maximum speed and panics at his lack of time management. Meanwhile, Richie admits that he only sells small quantities of drugs and that the idea was from Michael to earn revenue from the restaurant during the COVID-19 closures. Richie chides Fak and states that he will never be hired at the restaurant after their fight. Carmy loses his temper and threatens Richie. Before things escalate, Marcus overloads the electrical system and causes a blackout in the restaurant.

As the refrigerators do not work, the team is sent to purchase ice to keep the meats cold while they transport it elsewhere. Fak assesses the systems and states that the condenser is damaged beyond repair and must be replaced. He promises a connection to a supplier at a reasonable cost.

Carmy circumvents his sister and asks his brother-in-law, Pete, for permission to store the restaurant food in their garage. When Natalie finds out, she is angered and hurt that Carmy continues to ignore her even after their brother's death. Richie continues to bully Pete by insulting his following of the Cubs baseball team and questions his knowledge, but is impressed when Pete is a true fan. Carmy admits to Natalie that he does not call her as she only talks about negative things and he does not want to get into a fight. She retorts by saying he only calls her when he is having a panic attack, that he never attended the Al-Anon meeting, spending all his time at the restaurant, and taking advantage of her husband. Natalie also hates that Richie is in her house. Carmy finally admits that he went to the Al-Anon meeting which de-escalates the fight.

At the restaurant, Sydney devises a plan to construct a wood-fire stove out of construction materials to prepare for lunch service. As Sydney lights the fires, she has haunting flashbacks of her failed barbecue business. When Carmy returns, he is impressed by Sydney's proactive thinking. The restaurant is able to stay open by serving the sandwiches outside and accepting cash only.

When Carmy has a cigarette break, he finds Marcus hiding in the alleyway. Marcus admits that he caused the blackout by being behind on his cakes. Without getting angry, Carmy calmly explains to Marcus that he must prioritise his restaurant duties. Marcus admits that his first job was working in a fast food restaurant and that he never had a chance to be creative. He promises to never make mistakes again. Carmy reassures him that setbacks are a normal part of the restaurant business. Carmy tells a story about how after he won the Food & Wine award for The Best New Chef, he accidentally started a fire that almost burned down his place of employment. Carmy admits that he had a moment of catharsis that if the restaurant burned down, his anxiety would be destroyed with it, but then he puts the fire out. He lightens the mood and makes Marcus laugh before asking him to join the team. The guests at the restaurant enjoy the food and compliment Sydney.

Fak admits to Carmy that the cost of fixing the electrical system was significantly more than anticipated and that he lied about having a supplier. He suggests that the only solution to generate the money is to ask Richie to sell drugs. Richie revels in the hypocrisy displayed by Carmy but states that he will only help if Fak admits defeat. Fak is reluctant but sadly concedes and finally says ""Matae"". Carmy makes Richie promise that this would be the final time he sells drugs and Richie delivers on his duties. The power is restored and the restaurant is put back in order.

Carmy compliments Sydney on her work, and she tells him about how her catering business failed. She states that her business gained popularity too quickly without having enough capital to open a restaurant. Running the business from her garage was unsustainable and she defaulted on her loans. She says that the allure of being able to be independent without an overbearing boss was a dangerous fantasy that led her to financial ruin and diminished mental health. Carmy listens without providing judgement or unsolicited suggestions.

Marcus returns to the kitchen and carefully measures his ingredients while neatly labelling them. At the end of the night, Sydney returns to the apartment and continues to have dreams about food. This time, she is able to use her experience as inspiration for developing her cola-braised beef dish."

Michael has a naturally boisterous, charismatic and colloquial demeanour. He captivates the room with his presence. In the kitchen, Richie watches as Natalie, Carmy and Michael prepare Beef Braciole and a tomato sauce. Carmy listens closely in admiration of his brother and is honoured that he is allowed to cook alongside him. Michael has excellent rapport with his siblings and friends where he is able to play along with jokes and take control of the kitchen. Michael alters his mother's Braciole recipe as he refuses to add raisins.

Michael continues with his story that he and Richie stumbled into a bar called Ceres at 6:45AM and the place remained packed full of guests, including famous Ice Hockey players like Denis Savard, Chris Chelios and Ed Belfour. Michael recalls the busy service was because Savard was inducted into the Hall of Fame the night before. Richie, while drunk, tried to record a new voicemail message while reading from a pamphlet about the Goddess of Agriculture. Meanwhile, a voice approaches them from behind questioning what they are doing. Michael and Richie were bewildered to discover that Bill Murray was speaking to them. Bill Murray then offered to record a new voicemail for Richie.

In the present day, it is Richie telling the rest of the story to his date at a fine dining restaurant. However, Richie is not able to capture the charm that Michael had telling this story. Richie playfully asks his date to call him so that she can hear the voicemail message from Bill Murray, but she does not humour him. She seems unimpressed that Richie was at a bar in the early morning which spoils the mood. The date turns out to be a failure as Richie walks home alone.

The next day at the restaurant, Richie complains to Tina about his failed date but is getting in the way of the chefs. He is in denial about being rejected by stating he didn't like his date due to her lack of appreciation for Chicago history. They are startled by the dishwasher, Manny, who yells to get their attention. At first, he seems unsure about his tone of voice, but Carmy reassures him that it is necessary. Manny requests that the chefs take the tape labels off their containers before sending them to be washed. This is due to the dishwashers' wrinkly and wet fingers being unable to peel off the tape themselves which affects the efficiency. The chefs all agree and he thanks them for their time.

Sydney incessantly pesters Carmy to allow her to make her new risotto and braised beef dish which would be perfect for their takeaway service as it uses ingredients that the restaurants would otherwise waste. Carmy is unconvinced that the dish is ready nor is the restaurant capable of sustaining takeaway options. Carmy sternly tells Sydney that he had called her work references before hiring her. She appears baffled, but Carmy explains that Sydney's curriculum vitae was excellent but that The Beef restaurant was not, which is why he had to verify why she wanted to take a downgrade by working with him. He learned that she is very talented but also too eager and impatient to learn what it takes to run a restaurant.

Sydney takes offence at the feedback and insinuates that Carmy is insulting her for her failed independent catering business. Carmy dismisses this notion and requests for more time to consider adding a new dish to the menu. Carmy asks whether Sydney can cook her new dish without obstructing the workflow of the kitchen while also gaining approval from the dishwashers with the new messes being made. Sydney has already thought ahead and has cleared those obstacles. Carmy tries to make Sydney empathise with him by reflecting on the new-found relaxed nature of the restaurant and that he does not want to lose it. They are interrupted by Natalie banging on the back door of the restaurant.

Carmy is pulled away from the discussion with Sydney to be yelled at by his sister regarding the restaurant owing taxes for the previous five years. As Natalie agreed to be a co-owner of the restaurant, she is being threatened with having her house seized by the Internal Revenue Service unless they make a payment plan. She is stressed by having to do her usual work at the bank while also having to organise the chaotic records kept by their brother Michael when he was running the restaurant. Richie overhears the conversation but they do not take solace in his sympathies. Natalie reluctantly enters the restaurant office to review the documents they have.

Richie walks to the front of the restaurant to have a cigarette and sees that the adjacent bar, The Green Door Tavern, has closed down. He feels uneasy about his environment rapidly changing around him and about losing his identity.

Gary inspects Marcus' fermentation set up and is worried about it being hazardous to his health. He asks who made the pastries on the pictures on the walls. Marcus explains that the pictures are from Richard Hart, the founder of Hart Bageri in Copenhagen, Denmark. Gary also shows concern for Marcus, thinking he is homeless from noticing a pillow and blanket under his work station. Gary offers him a place to stay, after telling him a story about how he was homeless himself while trying out for the Cubs baseball team in the past. Marcus explains that he has been sleeping at the restaurant to save time on his commute because he wants more time to work on his donuts in the kitchen. Gary suggests that Marcus' obsession is psychopathic and suggests that he take a shower. Marcus is astonished that Gary was formerly a professional baseball player.

At the front counter, Richie is dejected and stares out the window. Sydney is worried about Richie as his usual upbeat attitude has disappeared. Richie laments the closing of the bar next door despite never patronising the venue. He enjoyed knowing about its existence as it was a landmark fixture in his area. Sydney tries to relate by naming some of her favourite places, such as Logan, Wicker, and Pilsen. Richie disagrees and states that the aforementioned establishments had changed for the worse. This is why he wants The Beef restaurant to remain the same in order to preserve history. He also values the principles of love and respect.

Richie tells a story about how the architect John Storrs did not see the point in carving a face in the Goddess statue on top of the Board of Trade because it was the tallest building at the time. It looks unusual in the modern day because every building is taller than the one preceding it. The story is interrupted by gunshots in the window of the Beef, but nobody is hurt due to the glass being bulletproof and it being from a small pistol.

Richie goes outside to investigate and sees a bunch of gangsters down the street. Richie is already acquainted with them and condones their illegal activities, but asks them to move their business elsewhere. The gangsters object because the construction of a new fast casual restaurant chain, Sweetgreen, poses a safety hazard. He requests that the gangsters find out who shot the restaurant.

Natalie suggests calling the police but there is an overwhelming negative response. She is also stressed about being exposed to violence, and the prospect of losing her home due to the fault of her drug-addicted brother. Carmy refuses to acknowledge her feelings and blames her for co-signing the finances of the restaurant. Natalie accuses Carmy of suppressing his trauma but his angers them both.

Carmy joins Richie outside and they both realise that they have no skills in accounting despite both being working in the hospitality industry for a long time. Richie asks Carmy about a burn scar on his arm. Carmy states that it was not from an oven, but from Michael's 15th birthday party when he fell into the barbecue while trying to break up a fight between Jan-Carlo and Fak. Carmy admits that he is afraid of something good happening in fear that something bad will happen in return. Richie then tells a story about how his daughter has a warped view of him due to noticing negative traits from his ex-wife. He is hurt that his wife called him contagious and bad news. This is one of the reasons for Richie's current low mood.

Marcus tests out a compote from the fermented strawberries and records his experiments. Despite Richie feeling depressed, he forces himself to feign happiness as he is Head Waiter at the restaurant. The regular patrons genuinely enjoy his company.

As the chefs are busy during dinner service, Sydney manages to make test runs of her risotto and cola-braised beef short ribs. Tina tastes it and is impressed. Carmy does a walkthrough and rearranges staff to assist Richie at the front, provides feedback on shortening the cooking time of the chicken, and suggests that the grease traps get cleaned.

Carmy appreciates that Sydney has waited for a quiet moment to ask for him to try her new dish. He thinks that the risotto is tremendous but that the sauce is not yet perfect. Ebraheim and Alex, the dishwasher, interrupt and try some of the dish. Sydney pushes for the dish to be placed on the menu, but Carmy does not provide her with a timeframe which frustrates her. Sydney has a rash moment where she offers her dish to a guest as a complimentary meal.

Carmy and Natalie continue to look for the proper documents in the office. Carmy stumbles upon a bottle of prescription medication, presumably the ones his brother was abusing. He then admits to Natalie that he would have co-signed for the restaurant with Michael as well. They finally discuss their feelings and she confronts Carmy about him never asking her about how she is doing. Carmy thinks that Natalie blames the restaurant instead of the people who wronged her, such as their mother or Michael. He compares Natalie to their emotionally-unstable mother. Carmy explains his lack of empathy on not knowing how to process his own emotions, let alone somebody else's. He finally is able to ask his sister how she is feeling. In a moment of luck, they are able to find the proper tax documents in an unclearly labelled folder.

Sydney does a walkthrough of the kitchen and notices that the chefs are starting to change their attitudes and work ethics. One example being the lowboy fridges being organised neatly. As Sydney glances at the guest enjoying her risotto, she feels motivated and enlightened, but this is quickly disrupted by a ruckus outside from rival gangs arguing. She provides feedback for Ebraheim to sharpen his knife, but Richie frantically searches the restaurant for his gun to manage the situation outside. As the guests inside the restaurant are frightened, Sydney reassured them before confronting the gang with assistance from Tina and Gary. Richie searches inside the dishwashing area and the workers of colour are offended that Richie insinuated that they took his weapon. He is finally able to find his gun in the boot of his car, but sees that Sydney has already reached a diplomatic solution with the gangs. She offers them leftover Italian Beef sandwiches every Tuesday and they negotiate for extra soft drinks. Richie is astonished at how issues can be resolved without his input.

During a busy rush in the kitchen, Richie annoys the chefs by telling a long-winded story but nobody is listening. When Sydney continually tells him to go back to the front, he swears at her and Tina intervenes. Richie has a tantrum and throws kitchen equipment on the floor. Tina suggests that Richie goes home to calm down. She acknowledges Michael and the history of the restaurant, but takes pride in the new direction and growth. Richie is on the verge of tears as he feels betrayed that his values are being phased out by Sydney, who is much younger than him. He threatens to quit but Tina chastises him that he has nowhere else to go. Richie's once-happy memories of Michael and old times become a haunting reminder that he is holding onto the past. Richie is desperately losing his sense of purpose.

Back in the kitchen, everybody has a symbiotic workflow. Sydney is the Expediter and instructs the chefs through their stations. Carmy focuses on his own station and uses a cake tester to gauge the doneness of the chicken. Carmy apologises to Sydney for being blunt with her when they were discussing the risotto being placed on the menu. Sydney announces that a local weatherman, Tom Skilling is dining at the restaurant and requests Marcus for a special dessert. However, Marcus is distracted by his donut experiments. Carmy is pleased at how the restaurant is operating but requests more urgency from his staff.

Outside, the gangsters are dispersed by lights and sirens from police officers. Richie looks away in shame, implying that he reported them to gain a modicum of control over his life."

The relaxing music plays through multiple camera angles of the city including many diverse buildings and elevated trains during the morning. Sydney takes the train, while Manny takes the bus to work. The classic restaurants of Chicago are shown, such as Parky's Hot Dogs, Johnnie's Beef, Pequod Pizzeria, Gene's & Jude's, Superdawg Drive-In, and the baseball stadium, Wrigley Field.

In the restaurant, Marcus has a small setup where he deep fries a donut.

Iconic people and events from Chicago are shown, such as The Great Migration, African-American working class, the gangster Al Capone, former Governor Rod Blagojevich, protests, fans of basketball and Michael Jordan, and former President Barack Obama.

Ebraheim rides a bicycle to work, and Carmy walks from the train station to the restaurant. Once he enters, the entire sequence is completed in one camera take without any interruptions.

Ebraheim slightly struggles while reading a review written by a food critic about The Beef restaurant. The review describes the restaurant as previously being reliable, but is now considered elegant. Meanwhile, Marcus fills the fried donut with a fermented cherry compote. Carmy tells Ebraheim to stop reading because the restaurant is busy preparing for opening in 20 minutes, but Ebraheim continues reading the positive feedback.

Tina has not yet arrived for her shift and Sydney is covering her preparation. Sydney is nervous around Carmy, and tries to stop Ebraheim from reading the next passage that compliments her risotto dish that Carmy told her not to serve. Sydney had unknowingly given the leftover risotto to a random guest who coincidentally was the food critic who wrote the review. Carmy questions Sydney, but then tells her that he harbours no animosity towards her. He then insults the food critic by calling him a hack, as the sandwiches are different to the risotto. Today is the anticipated day that the restaurant offers takeaway orders, but the systems are not yet ready.

Tina finally arrives and brings her teenage son, Louie, to the kitchen. The reason she is late is because her son was suspended from highschool. Tina asks Carmy to provide work experience for her son, but Carmy is hesitant due to being busy with the new systems. Carmy then passes the responsibility to Sydney. Sydney questions Tina why she brought her son, and Tina explains that he has delinquent tendencies and a lack of direction in life. Tina's logic is that Sydney has transformed her negative mindset and is hoping Sydney can do the same for her son.

Richie walks into the kitchen, also reading the review and insults the critic by calling him a hack. Carmy immediately agrees. Richie does not like the idea of having Risotto on the menu and sexually harasses Sydney by implying that she had sexual relations with somebody in the newspaper industry to have the review published. Fak also reads the review but does not understand the terminology used by the critic.

Carmy does an inventory count to ascertain that they have a maximum of 25 salads, 32 chickens, and 100 beef sandwiches. Marcus is distracted and is unable to answer regarding his number of cakes. Carmy threatens Marcus that if he is still working on the donuts that he will be punished. Sydney tries to show Louie how to work in the front-of-house section, but Richie refuses. She then tries to update Richie on how the takeaway system will operate.

Richie continues to bully Sydney by insinuating that Sydney's plan was to take over the restaurant and implement her new methods thereby eliminating the blue-collar demographic in favour of white-collar patrons. Sydney denies the allegations and states that she only wants to increase business and insults Richie on his principles. Richie is offended and retorts that Sydney does not have to be mean-spirited. She tells him not to speak to her and also insults the regular customers, stating that they are the least paying yet most condescending patrons of the restaurant. Sydney is tired of bickering and realises they have not discussed how to operate the new takeaway system. Carmy has to de-escalate their argument and tells them that he has activated the systems before they were ready. Sydney confronts Carmy and points out that she feels they are not amicable, but Carmy does not acknowledge her concerns.

Tina calls them back into the kitchen and is panicked at the sight of an endless wave of tickets being printed from the takeaway orders. Carmy blames Sydney for not turning off the pre-order option on the takeaway system and realises that they have insurmountable orders of 78 slices of chocolate cake, 99 serves of french fries, 54 chickens, 38 salads, and 255 beef sandwiches that are due in 8 minutes when the restaurant opens. Richie exacerbates the situation by ridiculing Sydney, which infuriates her.

Carmy spirals out of control and is angry at Sydney for serving her dish. She is baffled at his true feelings towards her. In a rash moment of stress, Carmy orders the chefs to gather all available food and to prepare it immediately. He also orders Fak to assist, despite him not having experience in the hospitality industry. Carmy restructures the kitchen roles from the brigade system to now be three sections of wet, hot, and sweet foods.

Richie tosses the fries in seasoning, Louie is the food runner, Gary is in charge of labelling the bags and organising the tickets. Sydney is frustrated and dislikes that Richie is doing kitchen duties without proper training. When Sydney checks on Marcus, she discovers he has still been working on his donuts and has ignored all instructions. He fails to understand the sense of urgency in the kitchen and surmises that while the cakes are baking, he has free time for himself.

Carmy fails to understand Sydney's Expediter workflow, but as she tries to explain herself, he screams at her to leave. He yells new instructions at the kitchen to prepare 76 beef sandwiches, 34 chickens, 12 french fries, and 12 mashed potatoes.

As Marcus has not yet sliced the cakes, Sydney rushes through the kitchen but forgets to alert staff that she is coming around the corner. She crashes into Richie, who was appropriately alerting the staff, and drops two cakes onto the floor. Richie absolves himself of blame by stating that Sydney did not alert him of her presence. She insults him but he retorts that the frantic state of the kitchen was Sydney's fault. Tina provides reassurance to Sydney and tells her that she is behaving uncharacteristically. Instead of taking support, Sydney insults Tina and her son, the restaurant, and tells her to get back to work.

Carmy updates the orders that they are waiting on 55 beef, 24 chickens, 41 hot dogs, and 6 Greek salads, but his permanent marker has run out of ink. Tina reports that they are out of giardiniera relish, so Carmy orders Sydney to prepare it. Suddenly, he also tells Richie to prepare it. Richie tells Carmy that another two orders of cakes have been processed, but Carmy tells him to cancel them. Fak comments on how Carmy is furious.

When Richie assists Sydney with the salads, she refuses his help and Richie tells her that she has a deep-seated vicious personality. Sydney is offended and she retaliates by insulting his self-worth and parenting skills. This angers Richie as he walks close to her face where Sydney keeps the distance by pointing at him with her knife. Richie asks Sydney if she will stab him, and she threatens that maybe she will.

Carmy tells them to shut up and is interrupted by Marcus who shows him that he has finally perfected a yeast donut instead of making a cake donut. This sends Carmy into a rage and he slaps the donut out of Marcus' hands.

In turn, Richie tells Carmy to calm down but as he walks backwards to his station, he feels Sydney's knife pierce the right side of his gluteal region. Fak is overwhelmed by the gruesome sight and the hectic environment. Things are made worse when a customer enters the restaurant. Carmy checks on Louie and commends him on his work.

Embraheim is the first-aid officer and dresses the wound on Richie's leg. Richie blocks out the pain by listening to Ebraheim educating him about the Somali civil war which was the inspiration behind the movie, Black Hawk Down. In his story, he mentions how things were exacerbated when the factions disallowed foreign intervention.

As Marcus is upset at the outburst from Carmy, he destroys his donuts in the dining room and walks out. Carmy continues the carnage when he screams at the staff to cook more food that has long been out of stock.

Presumably, a customer asks Louie if the restaurant serves risotto, to which everyone exclaims no. Carmy sees Sydney sitting alone in the locker room and she quits in the middle of service. She states that Carmy is an excellent chef, but a horrible human being. Carmy is irate to the point where he is lost for words. To calm himself down, he takes a bite from Marcus' donut that he slapped onto the ground and is impressed by the flavours. When Richie asks Carmy whether the restaurant is open for business, he smashes the ticket printer, and walks out of the kitchen."

He tells the story of how his drug-addicted brother, Michael, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head while on the State Street Bridge in Chicago. Carmy resents that his brother did not leave a letter or say goodbye. Instead, his brother gave Carmy the restaurant in his will which Carmy finds insulting. Michael never allowed Carmy to work there with him, despite Carmy being overqualified. Before Carmy is able to prepare the food, his ingredients disappear and he burns himself on a smoking pot. As he is flustered, he begs the cackling audience and producers of the show to stop filming. He also has flashbacks to his nightmare of a literal bear attacking him on the bridge.

Carmy frantically wakes up to discover that those experiences were only bad dreams. He sees on his phone that Uncle Jimmy wants to meet with him which makes him feel worse. In his head, Carmy can hear Michael's soothing voice giving him encouraging words. Carmy continues to be haunted by the previous day's disastrous service involving the takeaway system, his former Executive Chef in New York who tormented him, and visions of wild bears.

As Carmy stares at his enormous collection of cookbooks, he hears Michael incessantly telling him that he is too good to be working at The Beef restaurant. To calm himself down, he thinks back to dishes like Shrimp and Grits, Pig's Ears with Accoutrements, Miso Black Cod, Casarecce in Tomato Sauce with Green Asparagus, Black Truffle Risotto, and a beetroot rose dish. Carmy takes the most inspiration from highly acclaimed chefs, Alain Ducasse of Le Louis XV and Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park.

Carmy attends an Al-Anon meeting and finally accepts the invitation to speak, as he has been to fewer than 15 meetings. He introduces himself by his real name and tells his story involving his brother being addicted to painkillers. Carmy also tells the group about his experiences as a chef, and cooking alongside Michael since they were children. He cherishes that their love for food was a commonality. They both had aspirations to open a restaurant together. He appreciates that his brother was there to support him during times of anxiety with his phrase of ""Let it rip."" Carmy remembers his brother being boisterous and hilarious, while also having great social awareness. He reflects that his own personality was the opposite. Carmy did not have many friends in his youth, had a speech impediment, and was poor in academics. He also did not have any amorous relationships and lacks a sense of humour. Carmy thought of his brother as his best friend, and comments that Michael also made others feel like he was their best friend purely from his charisma. Carmy is hurt that he did not know his brother was abusing drugs, as he thought they knew everything about each other. However, as they grew older, Carmy realised that he knew nothing about his brother. Carmy is bitter that his brother abruptly denied him entry to The Bear restaurants in recent years. Carmy used the rejection as an unhealthy motivation to excel in his career as a chef in fine dining establishments to spite his brother.

In his pursuit, he admits that it took a drastic toll on him physically and mentally. He gives examples of doing menial tasks of separating herbs, shucking shellfish, getting cut, having ingredients lodged into his fingernails, having dry and oily skin simultaneously, having callouses on his fingers, and having a disrupted gastrointestinal system due to frequently vomiting from anxiety. Despite the high pressure environments, Carmy was engulfed in his work.

Carmy states that it took him years before he felt comfortable as a chef and was able to work quickly and fearlessly. He had developed a strong palate, knowledge of flavour pairings, food theory, and technical skills. He had rivalries in the kitchen and was hostile towards his colleagues. He took pride in expressing his confidence through his food and creativity, all in the hopes that Michael would acknowledge his efforts. However, when he never received recognition from his brother, he continued to become antisocial and obsessed with his passion for cooking. As Carmy devoted all of his time to the restaurant industry, he was unable to see the signs of his brother struggling with his own issues where his brother eventually died.

Carmy now realises that his efforts in trying to fix his family's failing restaurant was a proxy for him trying to repair the damage done to his family in the wake of his brother's death. He acknowledges that the restaurant has significance for many people including the staff, his family and especially for himself. However, Carmy is in suspense if the restaurant held any meaning to his brother.

Back at the restaurant, the mood has shifted with an eerie quietness. Nobody has spoken to Marcus since he walked out. Richie is recovering from the stab wound from Sydney that narrowly missed his orifice. Ebraheim comments that he has had to provide first aid in many gruelling situations. During the pre-service meeting, Carmy regrettably informs the team that the restaurant will be closed at night in order to host a Bachelor party as a favour for Uncle Jimmy's friend. The staff are disappointed.

Sydney hosts a dinner in her house for Marcus so they can process their emotions after leaving the restaurant. Sydney has not used her time to relax and has constantly been cooking at home. Marcus and Sydney share stories that both of their parents were very driven people. Sydney reassures Marcus when he feels guilty for nearly having a mental breakdown, and states that it is normal in the restaurant industry. Sydney cooks him a pan-seared sea bass with tomato confit, garnished with herbs and lemon zest. She tells stories of when she was in culinary school and spent her meagre savings to dine at fine-dining restaurants in New York, but she avoids sharing her favourite restaurant experience. Sydney speaks about her work experience where a Head Chef only allowed her to grate lemon zest as her sole duty for eight months.

At the restaurant, Carmy reviews Michael's financial bookkeeping systems again and Tina asks him how he is doing. She is concerned as Carmy is not as animated as usual. Carmy notices that Tina has finally embraced the blue apron team uniform that she used to avoid in the beginning. He asks Tina if she knows about a company called KBL Electric, but Tina answers that she had no idea what Michael was doing. In the account-keeping books, Carmy notices large transactions each month which totals the $330 000 that Uncle Jimmy had loaned him. Tina tells the story of how Michael refused to pay vendors, especially for napkins, as he felt it was futile due to struggling on finances. The depressed and cynical attitude was highly uncharacteristic of Michael which concerned Tina at the time. Tina tells Carmy that she loved Michael a lot.

Back at Sydney's house, she tells Marcus that she tried some of his donut that was on the floor of the restaurant, and thought that it was amazing. They both make fun of Carmy for his temperament, but Marcus contemplates going back to work at the restaurant. Sydney admits that the stress of being a delivery driver was worse than being a chef. She mentions that her family did not go to restaurants often, which made every occasion feel special, likewise in Marcus' situation. Sydney uses her life experience as her career goals; she wants to make people happy with her food and provide them with the best dining experience. Sydney is unsure of where to work next and is constrained by her financial debt, making it difficult to pursue her dreams. Marcus thanks Sydney and Carmy for teaching him invaluable skills in the restaurant. Sydney finally reveals that her favourite dining experience was in Carmy's restaurant when he worked in New York. She acknowledges his culinary skills but insults his character.

As The Beef hosts the Bachelor party, there are strippers, illicit substances and guests behaving wildly. While Richie and Carmy have a cigarette break outside, Richie expresses his resentment that Michael's poor management put them in this situation. He regrets not forcing Michael to seek help for his addiction despite Michael making promises. Richie expresses disbelief that Carmy had not realised that Michael was addicted to drugs. Carmy defends his own ignorance and blames the fact that he never saw Michael, and that Michael rejected his phone calls. Richie comments that Michael's larger-than-life personality made Richie believe that he was never capable of committing suicide.

An altercation inside the restaurant interrupts their conversation and they run inside to intervene. Richie punches a guest in the face which causes the guest to hit their head on the counter, being knocked unconscious. Richie is placed into police custody as the guest was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. He is fearful that he will be charged with manslaughter if the guest dies. Richie exercises his right to make a phone call; instead of calling for help, he calls his ex-wife and leaves an unrelated message apologising for having a poor relationship with her father. Richie is awoken with good news from the police officer that the victim has regained consciousness and that the charges were downgraded to aggravated assault.

Carmy picks Richie up from the police station and discovers that Carmy had used the restaurant's emergency funds as bail. Richie thanks him, and Carmy tells him to prepare the arcade game machines in order to raise revenue. Richie breaks into tears and tells Carmy that he is the only family he has remaining, as they both sit in silence.

At the restaurant, Carmy and Richie clean up the mess from the party the night before. Carmy sees Marcus in the kitchen and apologises for the way that he treated him and is glad that Marcus has returned. Marcus accepts his apology. Ebraheim feels disrespected when he finds a stripper's garment on his workstation, but Gary takes it away. When Tina sees Richie after being bailed out, she is elated and gives him a hug. Gary gives Richie the stripper garment as a present which makes him laugh.

Fak fixes the Ballbreaker arcade game and imagines the in-game character giving him advice to bottle up his emotions when he is upset. The staff do a full clean of the kitchen and begin their preparation. Carmy is in charge of completing Sydney's duties in her absence. Tina jokingly warns Carmy that if he treats her in the same manner that he did with Sydney, she will annihilate him. As there is the Taste of River North Festival, Carmy instructs everyone to prepare extra ingredients for the increased demand.

Carmy stumbles upon Sydney's notebook that she left behind and sees her recipe for the cola-braised beef short rib risotto. The meat delivery man arrives but brings pork instead of beef. He refuses to fix the error and tells Carmy to contact the distributor.

Carmy realises that the restaurant has no beef remaining and laughs at his misfortune. Carmy has flashbacks at how the restaurant previously operated in squalor, had unpaid invoices, and had broken equipment. As he turns on the stove to light his cigarette, there is an eruption of flames. Carmy has another moment of catharsis as he stares at the flames engulfing the stovetop, thinking about how his anxiety will disappear if the restaurant is destroyed. Tina and Gary intervene and extinguish the flames. Richie slaps him out of his daze and shows genuine concern.

As Carmy takes a break in the locker room, Richie takes out the hidden letter from Michael and finally gives it to Carmy. Richie admits that he hid the letter from Carmy and wanted to spare him the pain of having to read a potential suicide note from his brother. Carmy quietly forgives Richie and steps outside to read it alone. Before he opens the envelope, he sends a message to Sydney to give feedback that her braised beef needed an acidic component. Sydney is continuing to experiment with recipes in her home kitchen as she responds to the text messages. Carmy apologises for his abusive behaviour but she does not accept it. He tells her to come to the restaurant to pick up her final paycheck.

When Carmy opens the letter from Michael, the words ""I love you dude. Let it rip."" brings him to tears, as he still resents Michael for abandoning him. On the other side of the letter, there is a recipe for the Spaghetti meal that involves the 28-ounce cans of tomatoes. Michael thinks the smaller cans of tomatoes taste better than the large ones which makes Carmy laugh.

Ebraheim tells stories, reminiscing about being a grill master when he lived in Somalia. It is Carmy's turn to cook the pre-service family meal and he decides to cook Michael's Spaghetti. However, he chooses the 108-ounce cans of tomatoes instead of the smaller ones that Michael suggested.

Marcus is making another chocolate cake and applies a dark chocolate ganache on top. This cake looks like a noticeable improvement over the first few cakes that he baked, which shows his progress.

Richie monitors Fak as he is repairing the soda machine and offers him an opportunity to become a full-time employee instead of a contractor. Fak compliments Richie on how he was able to valiantly handle being stabbed by Sydney.

Carmy reminds the chefs to keep up the hygiene in the kitchen while he is preparing the family meal. When he pours the canned tomatoes into the pan, he notices a tightly-wrapped roll of cash. He opens it to discover a significant amount of money and screams for help from Richie. All of the staff members grab the cans of tomatoes to open, each revealing a roll of cash inside as they dump it on the floor. Everybody is in awe and makes jokes.

When Sydney arrives at the restaurant, she is astonished by the money and the mess on the floor. Richie tacitly forgives Sydney by telling her to join in and grab a can opener. Carmy also offers a truce by suggesting ideas on how to renovate the restaurant, such as having a new restaurant with two-seat tables and booths while serving the food in an unpretentious manner. Sydney accepts his apology as she suggests her own ideas of a Danish design fine dining restaurant, which concentrates on a functional and sleek decor, with a tasting menu at the bar. Carmy agrees and suggests continuing to serve Italian Beef sandwiches as a takeaway option by having a window where guests can collect their food. When Sydney asks Carmy what they should call their new restaurant, he takes time to consider it. After taking one last look at the restaurant from the outside, he puts up a sign stating that The Beef is closed and thanks the customers for their patronage. There is another note that reveals that the new restaurant will be called ""The Bear"" which is a reference to the restaurant that he wanted to open with Michael.

The staff enjoy the family meal of spaghetti with tomato sauce. Friends and family are also invited, including Pete, Natalie and Chester. Everyone banters and shares a joyful moment together, including Carmy who has a big smile on his face. Carmy is finally able to heal after all the moments of anguish, and begins to associate good memories with his family's restaurant and his brother."
