Lionel berates him for being scared; as a Luthor he is meant to lead.

In Smallville town, Martha (Annette OToole) and Jonathan (John Schneider) Kent enter Nell's Florists, where 3 year old Lana Lang is dressed up as a fairy. She offers Martha a wish. Later in the truck, Jonathan returns with supplies finding Martha in contemplative mood and Jonathan tells her he knows what she wished for.

While Lionel deals with business, Lex wanders off into cornfield and gets spooked by a voice calling for help: then, just when he finds Jeremy Creek (Justin Chatwin) hanging as a scarecrow in field, he and Jeremy are engulfed in a dust cloud thrown up by a meteor that lands nearby. After this first meteorite lands, a volley of meteorites hit the town and the surrounding farmland.

Jonathan and Martha are returning home, driving past the Welcome to Smallville sign when it gets hit, they enter a dust cloud and their truck overturns.

Lionel searches the flattened cornfield for Lex and finds him hidden under a pile of stalks, traumatised and bald;his ginger hair is scattered around him.

Jonathan and Martha awaken hanging by their seatbelts in their upturned truck and open their eyes to find a naked 4 year old boy squatting down to look at them through the window. Having collected the boy they climb out of the crater they find themselves in, with Martha carrying him wrapped in a blanket. Martha, desperate for a child, wants to keep him, and Jonathan tells her they need to find his parents. Martha asks where he came from and Jonathan answers, ""Kids don't just drop from the sky"". They spot a spaceship in the crater from the ridge and Martha says he's, ""Not from Kansas, that's for sure"". Jonathan replies, ""We can't tell people we found him in a cornfield"" to which Martha responds, ""We didn't. He found us"".

TODAY Clark (Tom Welling) is fretting over asking his father to sign his permission slip (We see on the slip that Kent farm is on Hickory Lane) for him to join High School football team. Trials are to be held that afternoon. Jonathan concerned that Clark could injure someone during the game and refuses to sign. Clark had hoped he could 'go through High School not a total loser!'

Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) are on school bus which has stopped to pick up Clark, but he's not there. As the bus pulls away,Clark overhears Pete say to Chloe that if Clark moved any slower he'd be extinct. Clark surprises Chloe and Pete arriving minutes after them and tells them he used a shortcut. Chloe is not convinced. Clark spots Lana and leaves them. They have a bet on how close Clark can get, with Pete betting 10 feet and Chloe 5, and then they count down as he gets closer and falls at her feet. She celebrates by saying, ""Its official, Clark Kent cannot get within 5 feet of Lana Lang without turning into a total freak show!""

Clark ends up face down on the floor in front of Lana, dropping his books. He feels ill and rests against rail. Whitney (Eric Johnson), her boyfriend and captain of the Crows High School football team, arrives and after talking to Lana picks up a book Clark missed and tosses it to him, making Clark drop all the books he's holding, and he slides to the floor.

Jeremy Creek breaks the glass on Trophy display case and removes a photo of the group who strung him up as the scarecrow 12 years ago.

Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) drives his Porsche into grounds of LuthorCorp facility in Smallville and parks outside building. He says, ""Thanks, Dad"" as he gets out of car and heads for entrance. He has just been made manager of the facility.

Pete is at trials, having handed in his permission slip. He is disappointed that Clark didn't keep to their arrangement. Clark is in stands watching.

Clark is next seen standing at safety rail on bridge, staring down at the water, possibly considering suicide.

Lex, driving fast, comes to bridge and hits a pole dropped from a lorry that passed a while ago. He swerves and catapults off the bridge into the water, aware that he hit someone on the bridge. The car sinks like a stone, filling with water as it does so, too fast for Lex to escape.

Clark is thrown into the water by the impact and seeing drivers desperate situation dives to save him. By peeling back roof he's able to haul the driver out and drags him to the bank where he performs CPR, entreating the unconscious driver to respond. When Lex recovers they introduce themselves to each other. Lex says, ""Swore I hit you"". Clark answers, ""If you did then I would be dead"". Clark seems shaken by the realisation. They vow to be friends. Jonathan arrives to collect Clark, notified by emergency services in attendance, demanding to know who the maniac was that was driving the car. Lex stands up, admitting it was him and introducing himself. No lover of the Luthors, Jonathan tells him to drive slower as a parting shot.

Clark has telescope aimed at Lana's bedroom and witnesses Whitney arrive. She tells Whitney that Nell is at the Luthors and that Clark saved Lex's life. Clark sees her give him pendant to wear at forthcoming game on Saturday and that he can return it afterwards. He tells her a scout from Kansas State will be there.

In a car workshop the owner is visited by Jeremy Creek, who he was responsible for stringing up as the scarecrow 12 years ago, when the meteor strike occurred. Jeremy touches him and is surrounded by a blue lightning charge and the owner collapses.

Clark sees a red truck outside the farmhouse and asks Martha about it. She hands him a card and he reads the message, 'From the maniac in the Porsche'. Clark asks her where the keys are and she tells him, ""Your father has them"". He finds Jonathan in barn and asks for keys, but Jonathan refuses, telling him he cannot keep the truck. He can't accept the gift just because he saved the man's life. Desperate, Clark suggests that his father drives the new red one and Clark takes the old blue one. Jonathan will not be persuaded. The conversation turns to keeping things normal. Clark walks over to shredder and shouts, ""Is this normal?"" as he switches it on and sticks his right arm into it. Jonathan dashes over and attempts to force Clark to remove his arm from the machine. With the machine switched off, Clark shows him a tattered sleeve but his arm is unmarked. ""Lexs car hit me at 60 mph. Is that normal? I'd give anything to be normal.""

Jonathan decides it's time to tell Clark the truth about his origins and together with Martha they explain what happened 12 years ago. ""You were adopted. Your parents were not from around here."" Clark guesses they were from another State. Jonathan tells him a bit further away and looks up at the sky. ""You're telling me I'm from another planet?"" Clark asks incredulously. ""And I suppose you have my spaceship stashed in the attic."" Martha responds, matter of factly, ""No, in the storm cellar"". Unwrapping a solid rectangular, polished silver metal block with strange symbols around the edges, Jonathan tells him that it's in a language unknown on Earth. Jonathan then shows him spacecraft. Clark now very angry, says, ""You should have told me sooner"", and races off at superspeed.

Now dark, Clark is hiding out in the graveyard and stumbles across Lana crouching at parents graveside, talking to them. He asks if she remembers them and she tells him she was only three. She introduces Clark to her parents then appears to be listening to them as they ask a question. She tells Clark her mother asks if he's upset about a girl. Clark says no. After she cocks her head she tells him her father asks if it's about a guy. Clark looks shocked and Lana says her father has a wicked sense of humour. They talk for a few minutes and Lana confesses that she feels alone without them. Clark reciprocates, saying, ""Whats that Mrs Lang? Ok, I'll tell her. Your Mom wants me to tell you that you are never alone, she is always watching over you.""

Clark walks Lana home and she gives him a kiss on the cheek before they part. Whitney is waiting for her and witnesses it: obviously furious.

At Luthor Mansion, Clark finds Lex in room with dust covers over furniture in a fencing session. As he enters Lex launches the epee into the air and it lands inches from Clark's head, embedding the tip in the wall. As Lex comes over to retrieve it he notices Clark. Clark tells him he's returning the truck as his father will not let him keep it. The session ended, Lex asks Clark if he believes a man can fly. Clark says only in a plane. He tells Clark that when his heart stopped he flew over Smallville. Lex suddenly looks puzzled and asks how he got through gates and Clark says he squeezed through. Before Clark leaves, Lex says that he knows that Jonathan doesn't like him and believes that an apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He asks Clark, ""What about you, Clark?"" Clark answers, ""I'm adopted"".

Clark goes to visit Chloe at Torch with Pete. Chloe asks them if they can keep a secret. Clark says he's the Fort Knox of secrets. She tells them of something she's been working on and then shows them a wall covered in newspaper clippings of strange occurrences in Smallville since the meteor shower. She says she calls it her 'Wall of Weird' and that it started as a scrapbook but expanded out of control. As Clark scans the articles he spots a little girl, obviously terrified, and realises it's Lana at age three. He realises that the meteor shower and other strange things that have happened in Smallville are connected to his spacecraft landing 12 years ago. Guilt ridden he states to himself, ""It's all my fault"".

Whitney corners Clark at High School. ""Congratulations, Clark. You're this years Scarecrow."" Clark warns him, ""Not now"", but Whitney ignores him so Clark takes a swing at him but Whitney easily catches his fist. Clark feels weak and realises Whitney is wearing Lana's necklace. Whitney pulls off the necklace and places it around Clarks neck telling him it will be the closest he gets to Lana. Strung up on a cross, in the middle of cornfield in his shorts, in the dark and with a red S painted on his chest, a shivering Clark seems to have no hope of rescue. Jeremy passes by on his way to Smallville High, ignoring Clarks plea to get him down, indicating his intention to wreak his vengeance on the current pupils by telling Clark he's safer where he is. Lex appears out of nowhere and immediately unties him. Clark falls to the ground, but in doing so the necklace breaks and he's able to function again. He grabs his clothes, thanks Lex and dashes off before Lex completes his offer of a lift. Arriving at school he discovers Jeremy outside and tells him its his fault that Jeremys like he is and to stop what he intends to do. Jeremy touches Clark and electricity sizzles around them but Clark is unharmed. Jeremy gets into truck and rams Clark, the hood of the truck bends in around Clark with the impact and Clark holds on as Jeremy then drives straight at a wall. A water pipe bursts and the truck cab fills with water. As Jeremy tries to dislodge Clark by using a bolt of electricity, it throws Clark clear. As Clark opens door and water gushes out, Jeremy looks at him and asks where he is.

The Home coming dance is well underway; Lana and Whitney have been crowned Homecoming King and Queen and are dancing. Pete and Chloe have attended together, all are oblivious to the danger that Clark averted.

Alone in his barn Clark looks through telescope and imagines him and Lana dancing on her porch, only for the sound of car horn to interrupt him and he sees Lana climb the few steps to her porch having been brought home by Whitney. Sotto voce he says, ""Thank you for the dance, Lana"". She stops and turns around, as if hearing him and searching for the source."

Episode 2 Metamorphosis

Outside Nell's house someone is in a tree, watching Lana (Kristen Kreuk) through her bedroom window as she drops her wrist corsage into a drawer. Lana discovers a square gift box tied with thin blue ribbon on her bed and opens it; multi-coloured butterflies fill her room to her delight. Her watcher records her reaction on a camcorder, and, satisfied she liked her present, walks away, getting into his VW Beetle to drive home.

Greg Arkin (Chad Donella) spotty and bespectacled face peers around the front door of his home to find his mother, Mrs Arkin, (Gabrielle Rose) viewing recordings he made of Lana and Whitney together. She greets him with, 'Is this what you do with your time now, Greg?' He asks her where she got them from and she tells him from that hole he calls a room. He's indignant and says she had no right. She suggests he has a lot of nerve talking about privacy. She is disgusted, reminding him that she is in the gardening club with Nell and asks how she can face Lana's aunt when she knows her son is creeping around video-taping her niece. She asks him where he's been that evening and he says collecting. She then rants about both disgusting habits, telling him she's had it with his behaviour and threatens, 'I'll be calling Claremont Military Academy first thing Monday morning'. Greg shouts, 'Hey, whos gonna take care of my bugs?'He decides to leave and picking up his favourites, brilliant green flying insects in a glass jar, he shakes it promising he will take them somewhere safe. With his collection in the car he speeds off and when he hits a large bump in the road he swerves before regaining control. This tips the jar onto the floor smashing it; causing the insects to swarm angrily and they attack him. He swats them as they bite/sting and loses control, crashing into a tree; an eerie green light shines through windscreen and hes heard screaming, 'No! No!' The following morning, a fly crawls over the shattered remains of his glasses as his Mom knocks on his bedroom door. She opens the door but is puzzled to find his room is empty. What she fails to see is Greg, stuck to the ceiling, facing downwards as he watches her.

Zooming over Smallville in the dark Clark (Tom Welling) floats into Lana's bedroom and hovers over her bed, with Lana (Kristen Kruek) fast asleep below him. She opens her eyes and tells him, 'It's all your fault, Clark,' then closes her eyes again. Clark hears his mother calling him to get up, reminding him that he hasn't done his chores and they have fifteen minutes before they are due at the Farmers Market. As he loses his concentration he has a brief realisation that he is actually floating, before he falls onto his own bed which collapses; first at the foot and then, seconds later, the head end.

At the local fair, Clark, after checking no one is watching, pushes a nail in with his thumb to secure a sign on their stall, as he prepares it for their farm produce. Chloe (Allison Mack) spots Lana and Whitney (Eric Johnson) and calls out, 'All hail to the homecoming King and Queen!'. Whitney (Eric Johnson) walks over with Lana, who mentions that she didn't see Clark at the homecoming dance the previous night. He responds that he was a little tied up as he glances at Whitney. Lana catches the look on both their faces then Jonathan (John Schneider) praises Whitneys performance at the last game. Not wanting to be near Whitney, Clark says he's going to the truck to unload. After telling Jonathan he'll help, Whitney follows Clark. As he catches up with Clark he insinuates that last night was just a joke then insists he needs Lana's necklace back. Clark answers that he doesn't have it. When Whitney states it is Lana's favourite he tells Whitney with contempt that he had better go out to the cornfield and find it.

Lana is admiring a butterfly wind chime when Greg stands close behind her, saying how beautiful the chime is. She turns to face and him and comments that she didn't recognise him without his glasses, (his hair is slicked back and all the spots have gone too) and he tells her that butterflies live only eight hours. Lana jokes that they live fast and die young, the rock stars of the insect world. He asks her if she will help him with their Lit paper. She asks if it is giving him 'brainfreeze', agreeing to go to his house after school. Whitney comes over to tell Lana that her aunt is looking for her and stays to warn Greg off tailing his girlfriend, calling him 'Bugboy'. Greg asks if he's afraid of the competition. Whitney responds that they are not in competition but if he finds out Greg has been leaving butterflies in his girlfriends bedroom, Greg will know about it. After he's gone Greg says out loud to himself 'sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug'. As Clark watches Whitney and Lana kiss before Whitney drives off, Lex (Michael Rosenbaum) saunters over and tells Clark he can't knock his taste in women before he asks Clark what happened the night before. Clark dismisses it as a stupid prank, but Lex persists, reminding him that he was tied to a stake and left in a field; continuing that even the Romans saved that for special occasions and Clark could have died out there. Clark tells him he appreciates Lex's help but he just wants to forget the whole thing. Jonathan comes over and asks what the hold-up is. Lex extends his hand and Jonathan shakes it then leaves after reminding Clark that he needs to help finish up. Lex is pleased that he at least got a handshake this time. Lex takes a bite out of an apple he took as he watches Lana walk past. He throws the rest of the apple into the back of the truck.

Whitney is heading home listening to the radio in his truck when he feels something land of the roof. Greg has leapt from a tree as he passed below and begins pounding on roof until it buckles and the passenger window shatters, causing Whitney to lose control. The truck rolls on its side and skids along the highway, leaving Whitney trapped, unconscious, inside. Greg watches until he realises another truck is coming. By the time Martha, Jonathan and Clark see Whitney's car he's gone. Jonathan skids to a stop. While Jonathan frees his fire extinguisher, Clark rushes over and releases Whitney, just as leaking fuel ignites. Martha and Jonathan watch in horror as, on the other side of the truck Clark is engulfed in flame as Whitney's truck explodes. They find him huddled in the middle of the road, his jacket smoking. When Jonathan touches Clark's jacket, burning his hand, Clark raises his head and they realise he's sheltering Whitney. Whitney stirs.

Back at the farm, as Clark looks at his arm, Jonathan gives Clark an update on Whitney, who has a couple of cuts and bruises but nothing serious. Clark asks if he remembers anything, and Jonathan reassures him that all Whitney remembers is something smashed his truck then he woke up in the ambulance. Clark asks his Dad to have a word with his Mom as he really freaked her out. Jonathan tells him he also made her really proud. Clark then tells Jonathan about his experience that morning, finding himself floating above his bed and that when he woke up he crashed onto his bed. Jonathan repeats 'floating' and tells him, 'When you break the laws of gravity we're definitely in uncharted territory'. Clark asks what's happening to him. Jonathan tells him that as his father he should have all the answers, and it kills him that he doesn't, but he has to have faith and they will figure it out together. Clark responds, 'But this is happening to me and I'm scared!'

At the mansion, Lex stands in front of a window holding Lana's necklace up to the light. He then puts it inside a box and closes the lid.

Lana rides her horse across a field and into the stables. Lex is waiting for her and suggests that she might want to check the horse's shoes. He introduces himself and she says they have met. He says he would remember her so Lana recalls a day when she was ten, and was in Metropolis for a competition. She and Nell were invited by his father to stay with him, and after being told they had an indoor pool she went to check it out and found Lex and a girl skinny dipping, she recalls that she thinks Lex was teaching her the breast stroke. Lex remembers the incident and shows surprise then comments that she is all grown up now. Lex sees a display cabinet of her competition photos and trophies and spots a photo of her wearing her pendant and asks her where it is. She tells him she lent it to her boyfriend. He asks what her boyfriend's name is and after she tells him it's Whitney, he mentions that like Whitney he was saved by Clark. Lana tells him that she visited Whitney before the game to give him the necklace. She acknowledges it was lucky that Clark was there to save Lex. He says he knows the feeling then queries if she is with the wrong guy as one chucks footballs while the other saves lives. Lana is not impressed, saying that for someone new in town he has a lot of opinions. Lex suggests that while she is nursing her boyfriend back to health she should ask him what he was doing just before the big game. She says he was with her, but it has made her suspicious.

Greg's mother enters her house to find the temperature is 103 degrees Farenheit. She heads upstairs to his bedroom and finds his room is covered in cobwebs and cocoons. He stands in front of her bare-chested, his hair wet and slicked back. She asks what the hell has gotten into him. He replies 'about 2 million years of intelligence and instinct'. She insists he stops it right now. He tells her its too late for that; that nature will take its course: first he will eat then he will moult and then he'll mate. She tries to pass him and he puts his hand across the door-way to block it. He goes on to tell her about the Pharaoh spider that kills its mother and eats her. He turns his back on her, moves his head from side to side then turns round and opens his mouth wide.

At the mansion, Lex finds Clark admiring his war-games layout and asks him if he saved any lives on the way over. Clark smiles as he turns round to face him and Lex continues that he could make a career of it. Clark apologises that his parents gave Lex a hard time, and he jokes that if push came to shove he would have arm wrestled them for it. Clark asks if he is planning an invasion and Lex says his father gave it to him when he was nine. Clark thinks its a cool gift. Lex tells him that it wasn't a gift, it was a strategy tool. He tells him that the battle of Troy started because two men were in love with the same woman, a little like him and the Quarterback, and that's why he strung Clark up in the field. Clark feels the war is already lost. Lex says this is only one battle and that Lana is not as infatuated as he may think. Clark reminds Lex that Whitney is the Captain of the football team and the whole town treats him like a god, game over. Lex suggests that if Clark hadn't pulled him out of the truck all his problems would have been solved. Before Clark comments, he tells him he is kidding and tells Clark he has a Trojan horse for him and picks up a small black box and opens it. Clark immediately feels ill and backs away slightly, but not before he's seen Lanas necklace inside. Lex is concerned and asks if he is ok. Clark assures him he's fine. Lex closes the box and moves towards Clark. To change the subject Clark comments that it's a cool box and asks what it made of. Lex tells him the legend of the box; that it is rumoured to be made from the armour of St George, the patron saint of boy scouts, and that his mother bought it in a casbah in Morocco and gave it to him before she died. Lex offers it to Clark but Clark refuses to take it. Lex asks him pointedly what it is about the Kents and gifts. Lex holds it out to Clark, and as Clark reluctantly takes,it. he tells him to give it to Lana and tell her what happened. When she opens it she will love Clark for it. With the necklace he will hold the power and all he has to do is use it.

In the corridor at school Lana challenges Whitney over where he was before the game on Saturday. He asks if they can talk about it later, but Lana insists that it's a simple question. He says he was training. Scornfully she asks, 'So you didn't grab Clark and hang him up in a field?' He defends himself by saying it was a prank. She demands her necklace back. He is forced to admit he lost it. She asks if he was planning on telling her or if that was a prank too. As she storms away, Greg intercepts her and reminds her he's been waiting for an hour for her to help with the English paper as she promised. She apologises and tells him that something really important came up and that she will do it another time. He accuses her of blowing him off for her boyfriend. She says she has to see Clark. He accuses her of wanting to spend time with Clark, and that he is more important to her than Greg is. She apologises and says she cannot talk about it right now as she has to go. She walks away.

Clark has taken the box out to school field and opens it experimentally. With his hand so near he can feel the effect, his skin taking on a green tinge as it swells and subsides like something moving under it. He shuts the box and it stops instantly. He returns home and finds Lana looking through his telescope in his loft, but instead of giving the box to her he quickly conceals it under a piece of material then continues up the stairs. When she praises his loft he confides his father built it for him and calls it his 'Fortress of Solitude'. She is standing by the telescope when she asks if he knew he could see her house from his loft. He feigns ignorance by being surprised, and subtly moves its position. He states that they only live a mile apart but she has never come over. She guesses that he wants to know why she's come over now. He tells that it's not that he doesn't enjoy her company but yes. She says she's found out about the whole 'scarecrow' thing and she's come to apologise on behalf of Whitney. He tells her, 'Theres no need, it wasn't your fault'. She then says that, 'Lex dropped the breadcrumbs and I followed the trail'. She explains that shes lost her favourite necklace and that her aunt Nell had it made for her from the meteorite that killed her parents. Nell gave it to her on the day that she officially adopted Lana. Clark has perfect opportunity to return necklace but shoves the box in drawer.

Greg's in the shower and sloughing off large lumps of skin into shower tray.

That night Jonathan and Clark are in the barn when Clark hears a noise like insects chirruping before he is attacked by something. When Jonathan goes up into rafters to look, he gets pushed and falls; heading straight down onto the sharp blades of the thresher they were re-assembling. Clark breaks his fall by leaning backwards over the blades, taking the full brunt of Jonathans landing. As Jonathan, then Clark stand up, Jonathan surveys the bent blades and asks, 'What just happened?' They discuss what could have attacked them and Jonathan says, 'Kids don't leap off ceilings and attack people'. Clark focuses torch on ceiling and they see green goo attached to underside of roof. 'Then how do you explain that?' He then tells his father about Chloe's 'Wall of Weird'. Jonathan responds, 'This is as out-there as it gets'. Martha joins in with, 'This coming from a man who's had a spacecraft in his cellar for 12 years'. When Clarks suggests that this has something to do with the meteor shower and he's to blame, Jonathan tells Clark that this probably has more to do with the Luthor fertiliser factory pumping out poisons for past 12 years. He goes on, saying that Clark is not responsible for meteor shower as he had no control over it. Clark asks how he can make the feeling go away and is told by Jonathan that he can't, and that's what makes him human.

Chloe, Pete (Sam Jones III) and Clark meet up and Clark tells them about the attack and that he and Pete should go to Greg's. Chloe, feeling left out says, 'I hate it when you do that'. Clark asks, 'What?' 'Shut me out like that, like you've outgrown me'. Clark jokes, 'I'll never outgrow you other than vertically'. Pete then tells Chloe about when he and Clark were kids and went to Greg's to play in the tree house Greg's father built, and that Clark would not go into it as he was scared of heights. Clarks denies it, saying he didn't think it was structurally sound. All three arrive outside Greg's house and look through window but see no sign of life. They gain entry through an open window and find remains of Greg's mother upstairs, cocooned in spider silk. They realise that having fed, Greg is following spider behaviour and will soon mate and his target is Lana.

Greg finds Lana with Whitney in stables at Nell's. Greg sends Whitney sailing through the air. He hits the rear wall of stall and is out cold. Greg kidnaps Lana, taking her to tree house. Clark arrives at stables just as Whitney emerges from stall. He guesses where Greg would take Lana and gives Whitney instructions to find tree house. Whitney takes his eyes off Clark to start the car, telling him he'll drive. With head down Whitney apologises to Clark for the scarecrow incident but when he looks up Clark is nowhere to be seen.

Reaching the tree house Clark climbs up, finding Lana cocooned and Greg waiting for him. They fight and fall to the ground, Greg then leading the way to an abandoned warehouse nearby. Clark feels the now familiar weakness and pain associated with being in close proximity to meteor rocks and is unable to fight Greg, being tossed about like a rag doll, ending up inside what seemed to be the remains of a container. Greg taunts him, saying, 'You haven't changed since we played around here as kids. You still get sick'. Clark suddenly finds his strength return and realises the walls must be made of lead and are protecting him. Greg swoops in and Clark sends him hurtling back out to land next to a chain. In an effort to get up Greg grabs the chain, Clark yells, 'No, Greg!' as he pulls a large scoop down on top of himself and gets crushed. Hundreds of black spiders come scuttling out from under and around the scoop and scatter. Clark returns to tree house but Whitney has rescued Lana from cocoon, much to Clark's dismay.

Under cover of darkness, Clark approaches Nell's front door and prepares to open the box. Hesitantly he lifts out the pendant, his hand showing the effects. Lana, having heard something, calls out, 'Whitney?' before opening the door. She steps out onto porch and looks around but seeing nothing turns to go back in and spots the pendant swinging from the handle. She smiles as she removes it and goes indoors. Clark watches from the cover of Hickory Lane, then turns and starts walking home."

Reporter Roger Nixon steals Clark's spacecraft and learns his secret. Whitney joins the Marines, and Clark takes Chloe to the prom, while a huge tornado approaches.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Greg Beeman'],"['', '', '']",[],"['cameo', 'spacecraft', 'reporter', 'prom', 'exploding car', 'car bomb', 'detonator', 'tornado']",[],"Lexis waiting at the helipad for his father to arrive. Lionel hasn't told Lex the purpose of the visit, but Lex has gathered all the plant employees together for him. Lionel claims that it will be a motivational speech, but then he proceeds to announce that the plant will be closed due to management problems beyond their control. Lex is furious. This is obviously another attempt to get Lex out of Smallville and back in Metropolis, where Lionel can keep an eye on him.

At school, Clark is trying to get advice from Pete about his tie and cummerbund. He tells Lana that he's planning to ask Lex if he can borrow his limo. Chloe arrives with the news that they are closing the LuthorCorp Plant. Clark tells his parents the news, but they have already heard about it since the Smallville Ledger rushed a special edition (for the first time since the 1989 meteor shower). They argue about why this happened and who is to blame.

Whitney takes Lana to a surprise picnic. He's prepared this special setting to tell her that he's enlisted in the Marine Corps. He says the only thing he'll miss in Smallville is Lana and asks Lana if she will wait for him. She doesn't know how to answer.

Clark goes to the Luthor Mansion and sees the missing piece of his ship on Lex's desk. Lex is upset that Lionel blamed the closing of the plant on him. When Clark realizes how busy Lex is, he leaves without asking to borrow the limo. Lex stashes the key in a little box.

Clark meets up with Chloe at the Torch office. Chloe tells Clark that her dad is talking about moving back to Metropolis. She and Clark are both upset at the prospect.

That evening at the Talon, Clark tells Lana that Chloe might be leaving for good. Lana informs Clark that Whitney has joined the Marines. They speculate what it might be like for them when both Chloe and Whitney are out of their lives.

Lex calls a meeting with the plant's senior management and announces he has a plan to orchestrate an employee buyout.

The next day, Clark is driving fence posts into the ground. When he gets back in the truck and turns the key, the truck explodes. Clark steps out bewildered but unharmed, and it is revealed that Roger Nixon has been filming the entire scene. Jonathan speculates that the explosion was caused by a leaking fuel line, perhaps igniting the fertilizer in the back of the truck. Clark confides that he almost didn't feel the heat and the debris didn't leave any bruises. Martha speculates that he's getting stronger as he gets older.

Lex is reviewing an email message when his father walks in asking why he hasn't started packing. Lex admits that he is forcing a vote of the board of directors to accept the buyout. Lionel laughs at the idea that Lex and all of the employees are willing to risk everything they have. Confident that they will fail, Lionel also casually mentions that he has purchased Smallville Savings and Loan and will not hesitate to close out the employees' mortgages when they start missing payments.

Clark tells Chloe about the truck and she agrees to drive him to the dance. They talk about Whitney's imminent departure. Chloe speculates that Whitney and Lana will break up, and when she moves away, Clark will be free to pursue Lana. Clark is unnerved by her attitude and Chloe admits that she is scared Clark will forget all about her to be with Lana and leave her at the gym all alone. Clark reassures Chloe that he is not asking her to the dance by default but because he really wants to be with her. He gives her a kiss just as Lana walks by.

At the Talon, Roger Nixon asks Clark if he is willing to do an interview and asks why Clark wasn't hurt in the explosion. Lex arrives and shoos him away. Lex warns Clark to stay away from Nixon. When Clark gets home he tells his parents about the journalist, saying he is sure Nixon blew up the truck. Then he tells his parents that he saw the missing piece of the ship on Lex's desk.

Roger Nixon has bugged the Kent's house and is out in his car listening to the entire conversation. He also learns that the ship is in the storm cellar. Roger goes to the mansion and steals the key. He then promises to show Lex all the proof he needs tonight. Lex arrives at the Kent Farm and finds Clark in his loft trying to tie his bow tie. He assures Clark that whatever happens in the next few days, Lex is still his friend and that is never going to change.

Whitney and Lana wander into the empty school gym before the dance, where all the decorations are ready. Whitney puts on some music and asks Lana to dance. He tries to talk to her about their relationship, but Lana doesn't want to talk, so they just dance.

Chloe arrives to pick Clark up and they exchange flowers. They notice that a storm is moving in; the wind has grown even stronger by the time they arrive at the school. As they arrive, Lana and Whitney are leaving on their way to the bus station. Clark says goodbye to Whitney and Whitney apologizes for tying Clark up in the cornfield. He asks Clark to look after Lana until he gets back.

At the bus station, Lana gives Whitney her meteorite necklace for luck. Whitney promises not to lose it this time. He promises that he will still love her when he sees her again.

Roger Nixon goes into the Kents' storm cellar. When he takes the key out of his pocket, it floats away from him and fits itself into the ship. The Kents enter the storm cellar to get in away from the storm and find Nixon there. Jonathan guesses that Nixon is the journalist that Clark told him about and is about to beat him up. Martha is trying to stop him when she notices that the ship is floating and glowing. With Jonathan's attention diverted, Roger runs out into the storm and Jonathan goes after him.

At the Spring Formal, Remy Zero is performing ""Save Me"". When they switch to a slow song, Clark asks Chloe to dance. Clark requested the song because it's one of Chloe's favorites. As they are dancing, Chloe says how surprised she is that Clark came through for her tonight, since every other attempt that Clark has made to date anyone has been ruined when he rushes off to save someone. Just as they are about to kiss, the assistant principal interrupts to announce that the National Weather Service has issued a tornado warning. Three funnels have been spotted south of town, and no one will be allowed to leave the gym. Clark knows that the bus station and Lana are south of town. Chloe agrees to call Lana, but Clark zooms away as soon as her back is turned.

Lex realizes the key is missing and guesses that it was Roger who took it. Lionel arrives to announce that he has discovered that Lex is using his mother's stock to fund the buyout. He tries to tell Lex that it won't work, but Lex is determined to get free from his father. Lionel vows to bury Lex and everyone who takes Lex's side. Just then, the storm blows out a window, sending Lionel to the floor and Lex across the room. A bookcase falls on Lex, cutting his eye. A column falls on Lionel, pinning him to the floor. Lex manages to get the bookcase off of himself, but when Lionel calls out for help, Lex seems to consider the possibility of leaving his father on the floor to die, then seems to regret his hesitation.

Lana is driving home from the bus stop when a large piece of debris hits the windshield. She swerves and puts the truck in a ditch. She gets out and sees three funnels coming straight for her. They come together to form one monstrous funnel as Lana gets back inside the truck and desperately tries to use her cell phone. She sees Clark arrive just as the funnel picks up the truck. Clark runs straight into the storm and disappears."

After being kicked out of multiple schools for strange events attributed to him, he ends up at the Yancy Academy boarding school, where he meets Grover Underwood, another bullied kid who befriends Percy and introduces him to trading card games based on mythological monsters, such as the Minotaur. When Percy is 12 years old, the school goes on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where their teacher, Mr. Brunner, tells them about the Greek Gods, and their importance to all their modern lives. Percy struggles to focus on the rest of lesson because of his ADHD and Dyslexia, and his mind wanders to when his mother, Sally Jackson, would tell him stories of the Greek myths, including his namesake, Perseus. Percy is scolded by Mrs. Dodds, another teacher who favors his and Grover's chief bully, Nancy Bobofit, and Percy's pencil breaks as he snaps out of his reverie. Mr. Brunner defends his student and gives Percy a pen to replace his broken pencil, and tells him to keep it. While the class eats their lunch outside, Percy tells Grover he longs to get back at Nancy, though Grover recommends against any such action. When Nancy antagonizes Grover, Percy approaches her to push her into the fountain, but she flies into it without him making contact with her. Suddenly, Mrs. Dodds transforms into a winged Fury, though nobody but Percy seems to be able to see her new form. She tells the stunned boy that she has been looking for him, calling him a Half-Blood, and demands to know where ""it"" is. When she pounces on the him, the pen in Percy's hand turns into a bronze sword, impaling the monster and turning her to dust. A moment later, Percy finds the whole class, as well as Mr. Brunner and Grover, standing over him. When Percy questions them about what he saw, they tell him that nothing happened after Nancy fell into the fountain, and there never was a Mrs. Dodds.

Later, the headmaster and administrators bring Percy and Grover into the office, as Nancy has accused Percy of shoving her into the fountain, though he claims he never laid hands on her. Taking the matter very seriously, they once again ask Percy for the truth, and once again Percy confirms that he never touched Nancy. However, Grover tells the headmaster that Percy was planning to get revenge on Nancy for her bullying, and did in fact push her. Percy is promptly expelled from Yancy, feeling betrayed by his friend. Mr. Brunner talks to Percy while he is waiting to be taken home, telling him that he believes Percy will have a difficult path ahead, but that he is exceptionally gifted, though he is uninterested in Brunner's assurances. He is brought home to his apartment in the city, where he is greeted by his deadbeat stepdad, Gabe. Gabe spends his days laying about the apartment playing virtual poker, and he too is hostile towards Percy, who despises him. Percy finds his mom, who tells him she believes his side of the story no matter what the school says, and gives him a bag of blue jelly beans as a welcome home gift. She has also been called by Mr. Brunner who told her about Grover. Percy tells her he thinks whatever is wrong with him is getting worse, and she promptly tells Gabe that she is taking Percy with her to their rented cabin in Montauk, right away, bribing Gabe to let them borrow his sports car.

On the way, Percy dreams he sees a distant hooded creature warning him to run while he can. When he wakes, they have arrived at Montauk amidst a heavy rainstorm. They settle in, and Percy asks Sally to talk. He tells her that he can barely focus in school anymore, and his daydreams have become more and more real. He starts to tell her about the incident at the museum, and Sally lets slip she knows about Mrs. Dodds. When Percy presses her about it, she tells him that they come to the cabin because she met Percy's father there. Sally has never spoken about her son's dad before, and she tells him that he was a remarkable, kind, and wise man who she loved very much. She then tells him that his dad was so special because he was not a man at all, but was in fact a real Greek god. Percy is incredulous, but Sally insists that the stories she has always told him about the gods and monsters are true, and tells him that sometimes the gods would have children with mortals, children called Demigods, or Half-Bloods. Percy remembers Mrs. Dodds calling him a half-blood, and Sally tells him that when demigods reach a certain age and realize what they are, evil forces gather to try and destroy them before they can become heroes. Percy panics, thinking he might be going genuinely insane and that his mom is patronizing him, but Grover suddenly shows up as the storm worsens. He warns Sally that they need to leave right away, as something is coming for them sooner than they originally thought. Percy immediately notices that Grover now has goat legs, and Sally tells Grover she didn't have a chance to finish explaining everything to Percy, as was their plan. They leave in the car, and Percy finds out that his best friend is actually a 24-year-old satyr, and his designated protector. His job is to make sure Percy makes it to Camp Half-Blood safely, as it is a sanctuary for demigods where they can learn about their heritage and train to survive the monster attacks inevitable to such an existence. Grover should have been able to smell the fury/Mrs. Dodds coming, but she was hidden by The Mist, a veil that hides the magical world from the normal world, such as Grover's legs and horns. For some reason, the Mist hid Dodds from Grover, even though beings from the mythic world should be able to see through it. Before they can inform Percy further, the Minotaur appears and begins chasing them down the road. He looks identical to the trading cards Grover played with Percy, and the satyr tells his friend that everything has been subtle training to try and help him survive. The monster attacks them, and though Sally is able to evade it, they lose control of the car and crash into the ditch.

The three climb out of the wreckage, Percy helping an injured Grover into the woods, where they approach the boundary of Camp Half-Blood. Sally tells Percy she cannot go with him, as the boundary keeps out monsters and humans alike, and makes Grover swear a vow to protect her son no matter what. Percy refuses to leave her behind, but she tells him to be strong. The Minotaur catches up with them, and Sally takes Percy's coat, since it has poor eyesight and relies on smell to hunt. She tells the boys to run for camp while she distracts the monster. Percy stops before the boundary line and sees the Minotaur knock his mother down, before picking her up and crushing her into dust as he watches. Enraged with grief, Percy pulls out Brunner's pen, which is vibrating in proximity to the monster, and as he removes the cap it once again turns into a sword. The young demigod charges the Minotaur and they fight, but Percy is terribly outmatched and loses his sword. He grabs onto the creature's back, and it cracks one of it's horns as it tries to knock him off. Percy holds on, and breaks the cracked horn off, using it to stab the Minotaur in the head. It disintegrates under him, and Percy passes out from his injuries. He wakes up enough to see people standing over him once again, and a centaur welcoming him to camp."

He wakes up the next day to find Grover tending to him, and upon seeing the broken Minotaur horn, realizes everything that happened the previous night was real. Grover apologizes for what happened to Percy's mom, and Percy decides to find his dad, since his godly heritage was the reason his mother was killed. Grover follows after as Percy finds the camp director, Mr. D, a disinterested and profoundly laid back man. When Percy demands to speak to his dad, Grover explains that Mr. D. is the god Dionysus, and warns him to show more respect. Mr. D. claims to be Percy's father, and asks him to retrieve a bottle of wine from the canteen for him before they can talk. Mr. Brunner finds them and assures Percy that Dionysus is not his dad, but wants to use him to bypass a curse put on him by Zeus that prevents him from acquiring alcohol as a punishment, the other half of which is having to run the camp. Mr. Brunner is actually the centaur Chiron, legendary trainer and mentor to half-bloods, who used his magic wheelchair to hide his true form. He takes Percy on a tour of camp, which covers the entire valley in which it is nestled, hidden from the rest of the world. There are hundreds of half-bloods living and training around camp, as well as Grover's fellow satyrs, and many other creatures. Percy tells Chiron he lost the pen/sword he gave him, but finds it back in his pocket. The centaur explains that unless he gives it up willingly, the pen will always find its way back to him. He takes the demigod to see the large cabins where the campers are quartered, one for the children of each god. However, the half-bloods must be claimed by their godly parent to know where they belong, and Percy has not yet been claimed. Chiron tells him that some children get claimed soon after arriving at camp, but some wait a long time. Percy is upset that his father seems content to continue ignoring him, but Chrion encourages him, and takes him to the Hermes cabin. As the patron god of travelers, the children of Hermes take in all the unclaimed demigods as well as their own half-siblings. Chrion introduces Percy into the cabin, and leaves him to settle in. He is greeted by an older, scarred camper, Luke Castellan, who shows compassion towards the younger half-blood and welcomes him into their ranks.

Later, Grover goes to the Cloven Council, the leaders of the satyrs, to express a concern about the events of the previous night. After speaking with them, he goes to see Chiron and Mr. D., and explains that Sally Jackson did not seem to die as a human should, but was disintegrated like a monster. Such a thing is achievable by god of the Underworld, Hades, and Grover thinks that for some reason, Hades has taken Percy's mother hostage. Both camp heads agree with Grover's theory, but expressly forbid him from telling Percy. Meanwhile, Percy has another dream about the skeletal robed figure, this time taunting him for the loss he's suffered, and being left alone by his father. As the ground opens up beneath him, he awakes. Luke tells Percy that many half-bloods experience vivid nightmares, as well as their natural battle-ready senses giving them ADHD and Dyslexia as a side effect of perceiving reality differently from other mortals. Percy asks if Luke is unclaimed, but Luke is a son of Hermes. However, he encourages Percy not to try and figure out the gods' plans before they reveal them, and instead focus on the primary goal of all half-bloods; Glory. The older demigod takes Percy with him and the others from Hermes cabin to begin his training, explaining that glory is a tangible reward for great deeds of battle and heroism in their world, which makes demigods more respected by the gods and feared by monsters. Percy runs afoul of Clarisse, an older daughter of Ares, who takes an immediate disdain to him and his supposed defeat of the fearsome Minotaur. Luke sends the Ares kids away, which the other Hermes kids attribute to Luke being the most skilled swordsman at camp, and a well respected adventurer. Percy decides to get some glory of his own to ward off Clarisse, and attempt to force his dad to come forward claim him. Luke warns him the gods cannot be forced to do anything, but admits that glory would make it harder for them to ignore him. They try Percy out in different disciplines such as archery and forge work, but he finds himself terribly unskilled in each. He is discouraged, but Luke is supportive. At lunch, their cabin is called to put forth their burnt offerings to the gods. Luke and the others explain this is a sign of respect to their godly parents, as burning the food you'll miss the most has the best chance of getting their attention before a prayer.

That night, Percy makes a small fire in the woods, and burns the blue jelly beans Sally gave him. He tries to talk to his mother, telling her that he is okay, and has even made some friends since arriving, but there is no sign of his dad. He resolves to find a way to make his father notice and acknowledge him and Sally both, no matter what it takes. As he returns to his cabin in the dark, he is ambushed by Clarisse and two of her cabin mates, who take him to the bathroom and demand he admit that he is lying about his battle with the Minotaur. Percy insists he's telling the truth, so they try to shove his head into the toilet, which suddenly shoots water around Percy and blasts Clarisse and the others, leaving Percy dry. They retreat, and Percy finds the girl who was watching him earlier standing in the doorway. She introduces herself as Annabeth Chase. He asks if she has been following him, which she readily admits to, waiting to see if he had what it takes to help her ""win capture the flag"". Later, the whole camp is training hard for the upcoming game, which gives much glory to the winners. Luke tells Percy that Annabeth is the head of the Athena cabin, and the leader of their side for capture the flag. She is an excellent strategist, and a fearsome warrior, and a close friend of Luke's. He explains that before he came to camp, he was on the road with another half-blood named Thalia, and they discovered the young Annabeth alone on the streets, and took her with them. Thalia was a 'forbidden child', a daughter of Zeus himself. He says that long ago, the 'Big Three', Zeus and his brothers Poseidon and Hades, mutually decided that their children were becoming too powerful, and so they all agreed to never sire more half-blood offspring. The pact held for a long time, until Zeus broke the agreement and fathered Thalia. Because of their innate power, forbidden children are hunted more fiercely than other half-bloods, constantly having to fight to survive. Before Thalia, Luke, and Annabeth could make it to camp, Thalia was killed. When Percy asks why Annabeth would be observing him, Luke explains that only way left for her to prove herself is to complete a quest, but she has not been sent on one yet. However, Chiron revealed a prophecy to her, that she would one day meet a new demigod that would go on a quest she was destined to be a part of, hence her interest in Percy. The camp is called to muster for capture the flag, split half and half, with Percy on the blue team with Luke and Annabeth. Annabeth sends Luke with the rest of the warriors, and takes Percy with her to the far side of the forest. Percy asks her not to expect too much of him, but she expresses her confidence before turning invisible with a magical Yankees cap she got from her mother, and seemingly leaving him alone on the ridge with no instructions.

As the game begins, Luke's battalion fights and wins their first skirmish, and Luke orders them to make for the enemy flag. His friend is concerned about Clarisse, who captains the red team, and will be guarding the flag, but Luke tells him that Annabeth has a plan involving Percy. Meanwhile, Percy whiles away the time alone on the overlook, but is eventually found and confronted by Clarisse herself, as well as her two minions. She tells him she's more interested in getting revenge than the flag, and attacks Percy with her magic spear. Percy does his best to defend himself, but the three Ares children quickly overpower him. Clarisse offers to let him go if he admits he made up the Minotaur fight, but Percy makes a run for it. The teens pursue and corner him on the shore, injuring him as he struggles to keep up. His instincts begin to kick in, and he is able to fend off Clarisse's sidekicks. As Clarisse presses her attack, Percy accidentally breaks her magic spear, enraging her. Before she can go further, the horn sounds signaling the end of the game, and the blue team storm the beach with the red flag in tow. Clarisse leaves Percy be, and Annabeth reveals she was watching Percy invisibly the whole time. Percy demands to know why she didn't step in, and she responds by shoving him into the lake, to confirm her suspicions once and for all. The water heals Percy's wounds, and the whole camp sees as a glowing trident appears above his head. Percy has been claimed by Poseidon, God of the Sea.

Later, after Percy has moved into the deserted Poseidon cabin, Chiron and Mr. D. tell Percy that his father and Zeus have been locked in conflict for months since the theft of Zeus' Master Bolt, the symbol of his power and authority. Zeus thinks Poseidon has had it stolen for him, and as a confirmed forbidden child of the sea god, Percy is suspect number one. Zeus has therefore issued a warning to Poseidon; unless the Master Bolt is returned to him before the Summer Solstice in a week, there will be a terrible war among the gods. Chrion says that while Poseidon has always been jealous of Zeus' position, their third brother Hades has reason to hate both of them, and is likely the real culprit. Therefore, Percy must undertake a quest for his father, to go to the Underworld, find the bolt, and return it before war breaks out. Percy refuses to go on an errand for his dad after being ignored his whole life, despite Mr. D. ordering him to accept. Percy is adamant, but Grover appears, and against Chiron and Mr. D.'s wishes, tells Percy that his mother is still alive, and being held in the Underworld too. If he goes to get the Master Bolt, he could also find Sally and bring her back. Percy decides to take the chance and accept the quest."

With the quest legitimized by the oracle, Chiron lines up the most qualified campers so Percy can choose his two quest companions. Percy immediately chooses Annabeth, telling Chiron that he wants someone who won't hesitate to do what must be done if the quest requires it. He also chooses Grover, who is on a punishment detail since going against Mr. D. Grover doesn't understand why Percy would want him on the quest, and Percy doesn't tell him that Delphi also prophesied he would be betrayed by a friend, just telling Grover that he trusts him the most. Percy packs to leave, having been supplied with human money as well as golden drachmas, the currency of the Olympian world. Luke comes to give him a pair of winged shoes he was gifted from his own father Hermes, and Percy confides that he thought about choosing Luke as his second questmate, but was afraid that if the chance comes to rescue his mom, and it complicates retrieving the bolt, Annabeth may try and stop him, and Luke would be on her side. Luke understands, and asks Percy to watch out for them. As the trio leave, Annabeth stops at the pine tree that marks the edge of camp. Grover explains that the tree is where Thalia was struck down while covering Luke and Annabeth's sprint to safety, holding off a group of monsters sent by Hades, including the fury who attacked Percy, Alecto. Thalia stayed behind to fight, against the protestations of her assigned satyr protector. Before Thalia could die, Zeus turned her into a tree that would strengthen the borders of the demigod sanctuary. Percy is unimpressed by Zeus' solution to 'save' his daughter, which annoys Annabeth. She takes charge of the group, telling Percy to follow her lead if he wants to survive. They make their way to the city and take a bus out of town. Percy doesn't understand why they are traveling via a slow, smelly bus all the way to Los Angeles where the entrance of the Underworld is if their quest is so important, instead of taking a plane. Grover tells him that as a forbidden child, Percy has a target on his back from monsters and gods alike. Zeus may very well try to kill Percy himself, and the sky is his domain. Staying on the ground is their best chance to avoid his wrath, and the smell of the bus should help hide them from monsters. They stop at a gas station and Annabeth leaves to restock their snacks. She insists Percy stay on the bus, and they argue about her assumed authority on this mission. Grover attempts to defuse the situation by singing a satyr song of consensus, but only succeeds in annoying them both into silence. While inside, Annabeth detects one of the Furies, and and finds Alecto/Mrs. Dodds on the bus. She puts on her invisibility cap and quietly confronts her. They spar verbally before Annabeth demands to know why she and the other fury are skulking about, and Alecto tells her they have been sent to retrieve Percy, alive. She offers Annabeth a deal; lure Percy outside where they can take him quietly, and Annabeth and Grover can continue the quest unimpeded. Annabeth silently returns to the others and warns them of the danger, as Alecto and her fury sister transform and attack. Annabeth kills the second fury and Percy and Grover activate the fire alarm, causing Alecto to get blocked by the evacuating passengers while the trio escape into the forest.

Grover leads them to a secret Satyr path through the woods, which was used by his Uncle Ferdinand who went on a quest of his own years ago, and never returned. Percy says they need to contact camp for help, but Annabeth insists that encountering danger is simply part of going on a quest. Percy is uninterested in continuing blindly for the sake of glory, and Annabeth asks him why he is afraid of accepting who he is, reminding him he is more than just a kid. Percy suggests they at least call her mother, Athena, to help them. When Annabeth balks at the idea, Percy realizes that none of the gods are in regular contact with the half human children. They continue arguing as Grover tries ease the tension, and Annabeth lets slip that Grover was her protector before he was Percy's, and Percy realizes that his friend was the protector who failed to save Thalia. Before they can continue fighting, Grover suddenly smells someone cooking hamburgers in the middle of the wilderness. They follow the smell to the seemingly desterted Auntie Em's Garden Gnome Emporium and Cafe, where they find a large statue garden. Annabeth is suspicious, and soon they find perfect statues of real monsters. Realizing who lives here, they try to retreat, but Alecto has caught up with them. She chastises Annabeth for not taking her deal, but they are stopped from fighting by the emporium's owner, Medusa. She knows who the two demigods and their satyr friend are, and invites them inside for food and to talk. The fury shrinks back, but will not leave without her prize. Percy suggests they go inside, thinking they can trust her as his mother was always sympathetic to Medusa's story, and she may not be as evil as people think. Annabeth is unconvinced, but with no other choice, she follows them in. Medusa welcomes them, though Annabeth is concerned she is more at risk than the others in this case. Medusa assures her she does not hold a grudge against the girl simply because she is Athena's daughter. As they eat, Percy asks what Medusa is, if she isn't a monster, yet is powerful enough to strike fear into the monster outside. The woman claims that she cannot stand monsters, and claims her power to deal with them permanently is a gift from the gods. Annabeth reminds her that it was a curse, one placed on her by Athena. Medusa admires Annabeth's loyalty to her mother, telling her that when she was mortal, she was once a devout worshiper of Athena, content to serve her without recognition forever. However, Poseidon saw her and fell in love with her, and in jealousy, Athena cursed her to never be looked at again. Annabeth says that isn't what happened, that her mother is just, but Medusa says that all gods are bullies, blaming mortals for their own mistakes. Annabeth calls her a liar, and Medusa goes to the kitchen to prepare more food, asking Percy to join her. Feeling sorry for her, he goes and apologizes for Annabeth's behavior. She tells Percy the girl will betray him, as she was betrayed by Athena. Percy insists she wouldn't, and asks why she's so interested in keeping him safe. She says that she feels kinship with his mother, who she says is in danger because of Poseidon's negligence. She tells him his companions will try and stop him if he deviates from their quest to save his mom, and offers to 'remove' Annabeth and Grover so he can finish his quest. When she turns, Percy has already run for it. Angered, she takes off her veil and pursues.

With the fury still outside, the trio meet up and flee into the basement, finding a vast cavern with hundreds of human statues, Medusa's victims. She enters the basement, and the three kids run into the maze of statues. Grover tries to use the flying shoes to distract her, but accidentally flies off into the darkness, leaving Percy and Annabeth on their own. They hide as Medusa approaches, who tells them they have made their choice to side with their parents against her, mocking Percy that he could have saved his mother if he had listened to her. Percy draws his sword and closes his eyes as she finds him. Before she can kill him, Grover crashes next to them, drawing her attention while Annabeth puts the Yankees cap on her. As the cap turns her invisible, Percy is able to cut her head off. They regroup and find the invisible head, and Percy and Annabeth take it upstairs. Percy goes outside, and uses Medusa's head to turn Alecto to stone when she charges at him. The two return to the basement and find Grover, who has discovered the petrified body of his uncle among Medusa's victims. Percy suggests keeping the cap on the head and burying it to ensure no one will ever stumble upon it, which Annabeth reluctantly agrees to, before demanding to know what Medusa meant by saving Percy's mom. He wants to know what ""offer"" the fury made to her, and they begin arguing again. Grover snaps at them both, telling Percy that the hat is the only thing she has from her mother, and tells Annabeth that Percy's mom is alive and being held in the Underworld. He asks them both to have sensitivity towards eachother's situations, and asks Percy once again what it is he seems so scared of. Percy finally admits that the oracle warned a friend would betray him, so he picked Annabeth for the quest because she would never want to be his friend, and he picked Grover because he thought he could trust him no matter what. However, ever since they began the journey he has felt alone and confused. Annabeth tells them that Alecto offered to let her and Grover go if she turned Percy in, and Percy tells her that Medusa said she would help get Percy's mom back if he let her have the other two. Having come clean to eachother, Grover says they need to commit to working together as a team from now on if they are to have a hope of completing their quest. Percy decides to use the Hermes Express postal service that Medusa used to ship her statues to send her head to Olympus. Grover and Annabeth warn that the gods won't take it well, but Percy argues that between Medusa trying to stop their quest to prevent war, and her conflict with Athena, they might see it as a tribute. And this way, Annabeth can keep her mother's hat.

Later, at the Empire State Building in New York City, Hermes happily delivers the package with Medusa's head to Mount Olympus."

Percy is too scared to let go of the edge, and Sally grows frustrated, insisting that being able to swim may be essential to Percy's survival one day, and she might not always be there to help him. Percy encourages his mom to take a deep breath and calm down, as she's taught him, confident that she will always be there for him, and she embraces her son. As she lets go, young Percy finds himself alone in a vast desert, seeing the dark robed figure in the distance. The figure warns him that being a forbidden child trying to be a hero will lead to his destruction, and tells him a new danger is coming for him already. Percy wakes up from the dream, in the cabin of a train headed to Los Angeles, along with Annabeth and Grover. Percy asks the also awake Annabeth about Thalia, the last known forbidden child. Annabeth tells him Thalia was tough, and that unlike the naturally kind-hearted Luke, with Thalia, respect had to be earned. Percy asks if that is why Annabeth is so hard on him, and Annabeth admits it's part of it. Percy wonders why the gods, their own parents, seem to require sacrifices or great deeds just to be notice their children, when family is meant to love unconditionally. Annabeth tells him its not just the gods who think that way, and explains the reason she was on the streets alone when Luke and Thalia took her in. Athena creates her children and gifts them to the mortals she loves, such as Annabeth's father. Her dad did love her very much, but eventually he met and married another woman, and they had children of their own. Soon Annabeth felt treated as a burden rather than a gift, and so she ran away at 7 years old. She tells him everyone has conditions, but at least the gods are straightforward with theirs. Grover awakens, very cranky with the sound of them talking so early. The three get up to get breakfast. Outside, a flying figure crashes in through the side of the train.

Later, in the dining car, Percy asks the other two how they are supposed to know where to go when they reach California in two days. Grover tells him they won't know until they get there, but they should have plenty of time to find it before the deadline. He asks Annabeth why they are even continuing the quest when the oracle implied they would ""fail to save what matters most in the end"", and she tells him that the prophesy could mean just about anything, and might not even have to do with their quest. She advises him not to try and read too much into prophecies, as they are pretty much impossible to interpret correctly. They see a group of centaurs galloping in the plains outside the train window, and admire the magnificent creatures. No one else on the train can see them because of the Mist, and Grover tells them there used to be massive herds of centaurs and other creatures before humans began killing them. The two tell Percy of Pan, God of the Wild, who disappeared thousands of years ago. Since then the natural world and the human world have fallen out of balance. The Satyrs send the bravest of their kind, called Searchers, to search for the missing god and bring him back, but none have ever succeeded. Grover's uncle Ferdinand was one such Searcher before he was killed by Medusa. The three kids are approached by a Police officer, who asks them to accompany him back to their cabin, which has been ripped apart and the wall blown open. They deny any knowledge of how their room came to be this way, though the officer is unconvinced, as a woman in the neighboring cabin claims to have heard a crash from the room, followed by children's voices running away. They challenge this accusation, but Annabeth's smart attitude towards the officer leads to them being detained in the dining car while another officer questions the woman. Percy assumes the officer must be a monster since he seems so convinced of their guilt, when they could not have possibly caused so much damage from the inside. Annabeth thinks he is human, but whatever tore their room apart must have been looking for Zeus' Master Bolt, thinking, as many Olympians do, that Percy has stolen it. They need to find a way out of the situation before they get delayed, but the woman comes to sit with them, asking the guarding officer to give them a moment to talk. The officer leaves, and she seems to be an ordinary woman with a dog carrier. She tells them she knows they must be scared without their parents around, and doesn't really think they destroyed the cabin, but just wanted a chance to speak with them face to face. Grover notices a piece of broken glass on her jacket, noting that the windows were broken from the outside. The animal in the woman's carrier becomes extremely agitated, and she calms it, telling it to be patient. She tells the kids that they aren't to blame for what happens next, but unfortunately they will have to bear the consequences of their parent's misdoings. Percy warns her that they have defeated several monsters, and will take her down the same way. The woman tells him the monsters they have killed were her own children. Grover and Annabeth realize with horror that the woman is Echidna, the Mother of Monsters. She tells them that she finds demigods to be the true monsters, too dangerous to be left alive. She calms the creature in the carrier again, telling the children it is young, and still learning to hunt. Their conversation has been meant to make them understand the danger, instill fear in them, all to make them easier for the monster to track. The carrier opens and the creature shoots out it's tail and jabs Percy in the chest, before Annabeth stabs it and the three run. The Police officers pursue them, Echidna scolding her child for getting overexcited before releasing it following. The trio run along the train, which is pulling into the St. Louis station. They block the officers from following them, and find a small stinger where the monster hit Percy. He seems fine, and the monster starts to catch up with them. With the train now stopped, they hurriedly disembark and head across the train yard to safety. Annabeth tells them they have a little time, since the young monster likely won't go far from it's mother. All the same, they can't outrun them for long. Luckily, Annabeth knows of a nearby sanctuary where no monster, even Echidna, can enter. A temple to Athena; the Gateway Arch.

She excitedly tells them about the arch's architectural genius, held up by pure math and physics, a monument to perfection, a tribute to Athena that was built by one of her half-blood children. Grover dislikes that the arch also represents mankind taking over wild places and killing its animals, a simplification that Annabeth takes umbridge with. Grover goes to book new train tickets, and Annabeth regrets snapping at him. Percy is grateful for the safe haven her mom has provided for them, and they wonder if it was luck or fate that they were in the right area to find a temple of the gods when they needed one. She tells him she knows he thinks its silly that Athena might care for her after so much silence. Percy assures her it doesn't matter what he might think, he's new to being a demigod anyway. She suggests that even though the arch is a monument to Athena, it's still a temple, and Percy might be able to contact his father. Percy is uninterested in trying to talk to Poseidon, saying that he is past trying to win his dad's attention when Annabeth has already been more helpful to him in a few days than Poseidon has been his whole life. He suddenly collapses, and they realize the monster's stinger must have been poisonous. Annabeth has an idea, and she and Grover help him outside. They put him in a nearby fountain and splash him with water, thinking that Poseidon's magic should be able to cure the poison like it healed him at camp, but it's not working, and Percy is getting worse. Annabeth wonders if the water must be from a naturally flowing source for Poseidon to heal his son. They see Echidna in the distance, making for the arch as the monster causes havoc behind her. Annabeth tells them they need to get back inside and head to the very top of the arch, the best viewpoint, which is really an alter to Athena. They are going to pray to her mom and ask her for help. They bring Percy back into the safety of the arch, but Annabeth is distracted by Echidna speaking telepathically to her before joining the boys. They get to one of the elevators, but see Echidna and her monster follow them inside. Grover recognizes the creature as the Chimera, one of the most feared demigod killers in the world. Confused as to how the monsters could have gotten into the temple, Percy asks Annabeth what Echidna said to her, recognizing the telepathy from when the fury Alecto spoke to him at the museum. Annabeth tells them that Echidna was allowed entry by Athena, who has been angered by her daughter's 'impertinence'. Percy realizes she means the head of Medusa, saying that he was the one who sent it to Olympus, not her. Nevertheless, Annabeth went along with the idea, and Athena has been embarrassed. She will not protect them from the Chimera, or help save Percy. They make it to the top of the archway, resolving to fight it out, but find the arch full of innocent tourists. They pull the fire alarm to start an evacuation, and Annabeth tells Grover to take Percy and hide in the crowd going back down while she holds off the monster. She orders the satyr to get Percy to the river so Poseidon can heal him, and make sure they get the Master Bolt and finish the quest. They refuse to leave her behind, but she says someone has to stay and keep the monster busy or they will all be killed. Percy offers her his sword, but manages to slip past her and lock her and Grover out of the top of the arch. They beg him not to try and stand alone against the monster, but he tells them that Poseidon has never been there for him and would not have healed him. He would have died anyway, at least this way the other two can finish the quest. He turns to face the approaching Chimera and Echidna, who have reached the peak of the arch. The Mother of Monsters advises him to give up, but Percy, weak from the poison, stands his ground. He attacks the Chimera, managing to cut it but barely avoiding getting burned to death as the massive creature breaths fire at him. Echinda uses her powers to blow a hole into the floor of the archway, as Percy loses his sword to the Chimera's thick hide. The monster charges the half-blood and Percy is thrown backwards into the open hole, barely managing to hang onto the edge. Echidna taunts him for not having anyone left who cares enough to be willing to help him. His strength fails and he falls from the top of the arch and plummets towards the ground, suddenly getting caught by a huge spout of water coming out of the Mississippi River. He finds himself at the bottom of the river, his foot trapped by debris. He tries to free himself and swim to the surface, but is approached by a sea spirit, sent by Poseidon, who tells him that his father has always been watching over him, and is proud of him. She tells him to breathe, but he panics and tries again to free his leg from the riverbed. The spirit assures him it has been hard for Poseidon to stay distant, but he will always be there for his son. She tells Percy to trust his father. With no other choice, Percy takes a breath, and finds that he can breathe normally underwater."

Grover nervously points out that the cops are eyeing them with interest, but Annabeth is distracted by three old ladies knitting amidst the chaos. One of the ladies cuts a strand of yarn while looking directly at Annabeth, as Grover tells her they should leave. They go to the riverbank, hoping that Percy is somehow still alive after falling from the arch during his battle with the Chimera. To their surprise, Percy climbs out of the river unharmed, and healed from the Chimera's poison thanks to Poseidon. Annabeth is relieved to see him, and he tells them that they need to make their way to Santa Monica before they go to the Underworld, as the sea god is going to help them with their quest. Grover informs him that the Police are now after them, since the officers on the train reported that they blew a hole in it, and now they think they sabotaged the arch. Unable to get tickets on public transport without risking arrest, they start walking. Percy, who has found a new sense of commitment to the quest since being saved by his father, and points out that they still don't know who actually stole the Master Bolt, since Hades couldn't have done it himself. If they are going to succeed fully, they'll need to find out who Hades sent to carry out the theft. He notices Annabeth is distracted, and she tells them about the three old ladies she saw, the Fates. When they cut the string in front of her, it meant that one of them will die soon. Percy is skeptical, but just then they are approached on the road by a biker who offers to help them, and knows of their task. It's Ares, the God of War, who was also sent out by his father Zeus to find the bolt. He meets them at diner to talk, and shows them a news broadcast; Percy and his mother's absence has been reported by his stepfather, Gabe, who has accused Percy of destroying his car and having something to do with Sally's disappearance. The FBI and the media have gotten involved, and there is no way the three kids can travel officially without being caught. Percy is infuriated, and Ares tells them that their quest will fail inevitably. They truth is, Zeus will probably still go to war with Poseidon even if they manage to get the bolt back, since their family craves conflict. However, since Percy is family, he offers them a deal in exchange for transport out west. He left his shield, his own symbol of power, at an abandoned theme park nearby. If they retrieve it and bring it back to him, he'll get them a ride. Annabeth is flippant towards the god, but they agree to his deal. Ares decides to keep Grover with him as insurance to make sure Percy and Annabeth return, and Grover tells them to go on since he has his own plan.

Percy and Annabeth arrive after dark at Waterworld, a huge dilapidated amusement park. As Percy moves through the turnstile, he triggers a trap that activates a sharp grinding device overhead that lowers as the stile moves. He stops halfway as Annabeth realizes the blades are made from Celestial Bronze, the same material his sword and her knife are made from. The enchanted metal passes through mortals, but is deadly to monsters and half-bloods. She figures out the machine does not lower all the way, and tells Percy to finish passing through. The device retracts when he reaches the other side, and a counter ticks him and Annabeth as they enter. They realize a god must have built the park, and only Hephaestus, the God of Craftsmen, would have had the ingenuity. The trap was only meant to scare them off, but now he knows they're here. Meanwhile, Grover is able to impress Ares with his knowledge of lesser known wars, and tells him that warfare reflects nature's own brutality. Ares is flattered, and they start to chat. Annabeth and Percy start their search, and try to figure out why Ares would have left his shield at Hephaestus's park. Percy remembers that Ares has had a longtime affair with Hephaestus's wife, Aphrodite. They realize the two gods must have met, been caught by Hephaestus, and left in a rush. As they approach, one of the rides lights up and activates, the tunnel of love. Assuming their quarry lies within, they climb aboard the boat and are taken into the building. Magical lights depict the story of Hephaestus, having been rejected by his own mother, Hera, for his deformities, and later turned away by Aphrodite, who chose Ares over him. Percy comes to understand what Ares meant about family of the gods being messed up, and realizes why his mother waited so long to tell him about his heritage. She was trying to keep him away from the Olympians and their constant conflict. He wishes she had prepared him better, but Annabeth points out Sally was probably trying to make sure Percy didn't end up just like them. The lightshow concludes, and the boat drops down into a steep thrill ride, and they land deep below the park in another part of the ride. They can see the chamber where the shield is held, but the boat is about to be torn apart by another deathtrap up ahead. They abandon the boat and jump into the water, but the strong currents drag them under. Percy reaches out to Annabeth, and jets of water shoot from his hands. They wake up on a platform in the shield chamber, unsure of what exactly Percy did to save them. Ares' shield is held fast in the hands of a giant statue, in front of which sits an ornate golden throne. They set about figuring out how to free the shield from the statue.

Meanwhile, Grover gets Ares to go on a rant complaining about the campers at Camp Half-Blood, who visit Mount Olympus on a field trip every Winter Solstice. Grover points out that one of the half-bloods must have taken the Master Bolt while they were there, but Ares dismisses the idea. When Grover implies that Ares has already found the lightning thief, the god of war becomes closed off after telling him he knows that Percy did not steal the bolt, to Grover's interest. Back at the park, Percy tells Annabeth the rest of Hephaestus's story. After being rejected, he built the golden chair and tricked Hera into sitting in it, but she couldn't get back out. All the other gods tried to free her, but Hephaestus's craftsmanship was too complex and strong for even them. They eventually agreed to let Aphrodite become his wife if he let Hera go. Percy realizes the chair is the mechanism, a bargaining tool. One of them must sit on the throne to release the shield, but won't be able to leave. Annabeth immediately tries to make the decision to stay, but Percy won't let her. She insists he won't make the choice to sacrifice himself for her again, and Percy tells her the whole reason he chose her for the quest was because she could do what needed to be done for the sake of their mission, even if it meant leaving him behind. The Fates were right, one of them would have to take the fall to get the others to the Underworld in time. Annabeth argues, but Percy points out that she has a better chance of succeeding without him than he does without her. She reluctantly agrees, and promises to get him mom back from Hades, and return to find a way to get him out. He sits on the throne, which covers him in gold, making him one with the chair as the shield is dropped from the statue. Annabeth is devastated at the loss of another friend, and doesn't take the shield. She starts frantically trying to reverse the mechanism on the chair as a figure enters the catwalk above; Hephaestus himself. He shows her the way out, and tells her to take what she came for and go. She refuses to leave without Percy, and the god of craftsmen tells her it is impossible to reverse the machine. He reminds her how she has displeased her mother, and tells her once she leaves and completes the quest for the Master Bolt, she will achieve monumental glory, and win back Athena's favor. Annabeth is tired of the Olympian cycle of sacrificing everyone around them to get what they want. She tells him she doesn't want to be a part of it anymore, saying that Percy is different from all of them, willing to give himself up for the good of others. She isn't willing to let her friend take the fall for her for the sake of glory and power. Her words move Hephaestus, and he reactivates the chair and releases Percy. He tells Annabeth he'll have a talk with Athena, and lets them both leave with the shield.

The return to the diner and give the shield back to Ares, who shows them to their ride west, the back of a semi truck carrying live zoo animals. The truck is heading to Las Vegas, where they can find Hermes and try to get his driver to take them the rest of the way to Los Angeles. He also gives them a backpack of supplies, but tells them they have no chance of actually succeeding. Percy becomes angered by Ares' continual insistence of their failure and nearly challenges the god, but Grover convinces him to take what they can get and leave. As Ares closes the truck behind them, Grover tells the other two that he has figured out who stole the Master Bolt."

An Entity, in the guise of the Yancy Headmaster, berates the unseen ""Lightning Thief"" for losing Zeus's Master Bolt after stealing it for the Entity, who has resolved the situation himself. The theft of the bolt and following war between the gods is only the prelude to the Entity's true plan. However, he warns the thief that future failure will result in their replacement, as he looks at Percy. He tells the demigod it isn't yet time for them to meet, and in the meantime Percy will prove his worth. Percy wakes up in the trailer of the Zoo Animal transport truck Ares provided for them to stow away in to Las Vegas. They are almost at their destination, and Annabeth uses a piece of crystal to reflect the light into a rainbow on the wall. Percy puts a golden drachma into the refraction, and Annabeth asks Iris, the Goddess of the Rainbow, to help them get a message to Chiron at Camp Half-Blood. The rainbow turns into a visual link to the camp office, where Luke answers. He tells them that Chiron is busy trying desperately to keep things under control, as news of an upcoming war has the campers taking sides against eachother. The two inform him of Grover's discovery that Ares knows who the Lightning Thief is and is covering up for them. The only person he might do that for is his own half-blood daughter, Clarisse. Percy tells Luke to have Clarisse brought in and questioned about something else that is coming, something even bigger than the war between Zeus and Poseidon. Luke promises to see it done, but Annabeth cuts off the connection before Percy can ask him for advice dealing with his father, Hermes. Annabeth tells him the Luke and his dad don't get along, and would try to talk them out of speaking with him. Grover comes back from talking to the animals on the truck, who've informed him that the men transporting them are illegal exotic animal smugglers. They have a plan to escape, but they need help getting out of the cages.

As soon as the truck arrives in Vegas, the animals run amok in the crowded Vegas Strip, though Grover has given them a Satyr blessing to help them reach the wilds safely. The trio head for the Lotus Casino and Hotel, a massive and lavish establishment full of patrons. After their initial urge to check out what the casino has to offer, Grover reminds the others of the Odyssey, in which Odysseus met sailors who forgot who they were and became contentedly trapped after eating enchanted lotus flowers. They don't have any choice but to risk it and enter, and Annabeth says they should be safe as long as they don't eat anything. They search for the messenger god, but the casino is a maze of arcades, gambling tables, and restaurants. They decide to split up, Annabeth going with Percy since he doesn't know what Hermes looks like. Annabeth reminds Grover to come find her if he gets to Hermes first. When Percy asks why, she explains that her connection to Luke could persuade his dad to help them. During her time on the road with him and Thalia, she met his mother, a seer, one of only a small number of mortals that can see through the Mist. Many of them can see into the future, and the horrors can drive them mad, a fate that befell Luke's mom. Luke blames Hermes for it, but despite this, the messenger god cares deeply for his son, and has always wanted to win him back. Meanwhile, Grover finds another satyr, an old family friend of his, Augustus. He was another Searcher for Pan until he, like Grover's uncle Ferdinand, went missing. He doesn't remember Grover, who realizes he must have eaten the lotus flowers. He tells him about finding the petrified Ferdinand in New Jersey, which seemingly breaks through to Augustus. He tells Grover that he has found Pan, inside the casino. He is very close to breaking through to him, but he needs Grover's help. Percy tells Annabeth about the dreams he's been having, and the entity that has spoken to him in it. However, this last dream he seems to have eavesdropped on the Entity's meeting, in which he spoke to whoever stole the Master Bolt for him. Assuming the entity is really Hades and the thief is Clarisse, they wonder what the next step of their plan could be if starting war amongst the gods is only the beginning.

Grover follows Augustus through the casino to the arcade, but doesn't understand why the god of nature would hide in an artificial paradise like Vegas. Augustus forgets who Grover is again, and offers him the snack he's been munching on. Grover refuses to eat the lotus flowers, but sees it is just ordinary food. Before he can warn the others, he suddenly starts to forget why he's there. Unable to remember his mission, he goes to help Augustus find Pan. Annabeth and Percy find Hermes enjoying himself at the craps table. He knows who they are and why they are there, and tells them he has no interest in helping them find their way into the Underworld. At the mention of Luke, Hermes' attitude changes. He teleports them to a private room in the casino to talk. He remembers Annabeth from the last time he saw Luke, and she tells him she overheard Luke blow up at his dad and blame him for what happened to his mom. She asks him to help them, and show Luke how much he cares in the process. Hermes is unconvinced. He's helped heroes find the secret way into the Underworld before, and each and every one of them has met their doom inside. As for Luke, he was warned not to engage with his offspring, but he ignored them and tried to help Luke and his mother anyway, only succeeding in making their lives even worse. He tells them gods and half-bloods can't help but hurt the ones they love most, illustrating his point by showing Percy a flashback of him in the back of a car, leaving Percy shaken. Annabeth asks him one last time to help them, but Hermes refuses. Annabeth walks out, and the god tells Percy it was Poseidon himself that told him to stay away from his children, telling him its too hard watching them struggle without being able to help them, but it is necessary to let them follow their own path. Percy tells him his dad was supposed to meet him in Santa Monica and asks him why he would do that if he thinks it will only make things worse. Hermes tells him gods do not like to feel powerless. However, in any event, its too late now. They've been in the Lotus Casino longer than they think.

Percy finds Annabeth hesitating at the exit. It is already night time, and they realize they have been inside for three whole days. The lotus flowers weren't in the food, they were pumped into the air itself, and time moves much faster outside than it does in the magical casino. Hermes let them waste time talking to him, making Annabeth feel less guilty about having picked his pocket while invisible after she left. She has the keys to his car, all they need to do is find it, but Hermes reminded Percy they had something else to do before they go. Annabeth starts to realize Grover is missing, but Percy has forgotten him completely. They spot Augustus as their suppressed memories return to them, and he runs when they approach him. Percy chases and eventually tackles him, getting him to tell them where their friend is. Grover is in the arcade, playing a virtual reality game. They get him out of it, but he has no idea who they are. They hurriedly explain their quest, and he is enthusiastic to join in. They head to the parking garage to look for Hermes' car, and on the way Percy asks Grover what game he was playing. Grover says he thought he was searching for Pan, and was getting close. They find Hermes' Taxi, along with a note addressed to them. The god of thieves noticed Annabeth picking his pocket, and has left them instructions for the car as well as a map to the entrance to the Underworld. As soon as they are on the road, Hermes' power will allow the car to instantly take them anywhere, but first they need to get it out of the parking garage. They realize none of them know how to drive, and Percy volunteers to give it a try. They crash into the walls and are nearly struck by a semi before making it onto the street, where the car teleports them straight to the beach in Santa Monica.

The trio get out of the car, and Grover's memories return to him. He wonders why he forgot so much faster than they did, and Annabeth guesses it was because she and Percy had eachother to remind them what was important. Percy is nervous about meeting his dad, but his friends encourage him. He walks into the surf, and submerges. As he reaches the depths, he is greeted by the Sea Spirit who helped him in the river. She tells him the sea god waited as long as he could for his son, but the solstice has just passed a few hours ago, and Zeus' deadline has expired. Poseidon had to leave to marshal his forces for war. He left a message, the spirit telling him his father is very proud of him for making it this far, and doesn't blame him for the mission's failure, but now it it time to return to Camp Half-Blood. He is free of his quest. Percy refuses to give up, telling her that the war between Zeus and Poseidon is part of a larger plot, one the gods are completely unaware of. Something worse is using them against eachother, and he will not stand by and let it happen. He asks the spirit to help them finish the quest, and she remarks how like his father Percy is. She tells him what belongs to the sea can always return, giving him magic pearls, each of which will help one of them escape the Underworld. Percy notes there are four pearls, and the spirit tells him to find the Master Bolt, and return with his mother"

According to Hermes' map, the secret entrance to the Underworld is in the store, and Crusty is it's guardian. Percy asks him to let him pass, but Crusty instead tries to convince Percy to sit on one of the deadly beds, his ancient method of killing his guests. Percy is well aware of the danger, and an invisible Annabeth shoves Crusty onto the bed, trapping him. They let him live, but he warns them they will never succeed in bringing someone back from Hades. Nevertheless, they find the entrance to the Underworld as Grover joins them. The satyr is nervous about going into the depths, so Annabeth hands him a stress ball to relax. Percy gives each of them one of the pearls he got from the Sea Spirit to help them escape when the time comes, keeping the other two for himself and his mom, before they all descend into the Underworld.

In the past, Sally Jackson takes a young Percy to a boarding school in the countryside. Percy refuses to go, but Sally tries to convince him it's for his own good. They argue, and he locks himself in the car. Sally orders him to open the door, and he angerly relents. In the Underworld, the trio arrive just across the River Styx, outside the walls to Hades' realm. Grover's squeaky stress ball threatens to give them away, so Annabeth decides to hang on to it. They spot Charon, the ferryman to the Underworld, leading a new group of souls to the long line waiting for entry. They sneak along the line to the front, but are confronted by the undead boatman, who immediately notices they are not dead. Despite their attempted bribe to let them pass, he calls for Cerberus, the giant, three-headed dog and guardian of the Underworld, and the massive dog chases them along the river and eats Grover. Annabeth and Percy split up, and Percy is cornered by the monster. However, Cerberus is placated by Annabeth climbing up and scratching him, putting him to sleep. Grover is able to pull himself out of Cerberus' mouth, but Annabeth's arm is getting tired. Grover uses the flying shoes to fly him and Percy to the top of the wall, but Cerberus wakes up before he can go back for Annabeth. She throws the squeaky ball up to the top, and the giant dog leaps up to get it, Annabeth jumping off near the top. She takes the ball and throws it into the Styx, and Cerberus happily runs after it. Grover and Percy are amazed, and she sadly says her dad had a dog like him when she was little. They find themselves at the edge of Hades' kingdom, and see his palace in the distance. As they prepare to continue, Grover realizes his lost his pearl when Cerberus ate him.

In the past, Percy sits outside an office while Sally talks to the principle of the boarding school, who informs her they have decided to revoke Percy's admittance due to a recent call from his old school that he has psychological problems. Sally tells him she has already taken her son out of his previous school and he has nowhere else to go. The principle suggests she homeschool him, but Sally says she can't, to Percy's disappointment. In the Underworld, Grover insists they leave him behind after they find the bolt, as they now do not have enough pearls for all three of them and Sally. Percy refuses, and gives Grover his pearl instead. He tells him and Annabeth to leave with his mom after they find her and the bolt, and says he will find another way out. Before they can discuss it further, they realize the forest they are in is full of the souls of dead humans, rooted to the ground and unaware of the childrens' presence. Annabeth tells them they are in one of the Fields of Asphodel. The souls here are people who have intense regret for choices they made or didn't make in life, forever trapped by the roots. They hear Cerberus coming after them and make a run for it, but Annabeth falls behind. The boys go back and find her stuck in place, her leg caught by the roots. Grover realizes she must have regret for something, but they can't get her free. She tells him and Percy to go on, while she uses her pearl to escape. Percy hesitates, but she orders them to leave her. They get to the border of the forest as Annabeth uses her pearl and disappears, and they boys keep running as Cerberus continues his pursuit. They make it out of Asphodel and wonder through a vast, desert-like region. The three-headed dog has stopped chasing them, but before they can figure out why, the flying shoes Grover is wearing activate and start pulling him over a ridge. Percy runs after him as the shoes drag Grover towards a gargantuan chasm. Percy grabs onto the satyr and jams his sword into the ground to hold on, as the shoes finally pull themselves off of Grover's hooves and plummet themselves into the pit. As the two recover, Percy feels something heavy appear in his backpack. they they open it up, and are astonished to find the Master Bolt. Percy remembers it was Ares who gave him the backpack, and must have had the Master Bolt the whole time, tricking them into taking it to the Underworld. Grover points out that Zeus would be expecting them to return immediately with the bolt. However, they need to find Sally first.

Sally takes Young Percy to a cafe, having secured him a place at boarding school. Percy mopes as his mom tells him to give it a chance, saying it's for the best. He asks her why she is trying so hard to get rid of him. Sally goes to the counter to pay, and tries to keep her emotions together as Percy waits silently back at the table. In the present, Percy and Grover approach Hades' palace, and are granted entry. They arrive in Hades' throne room and are greeted by the god of the dead, who casually invites them to join him when Percy demands to see his mom. He shows them to a makeshift drawing room, with Sally suspended as a golden statue on display. Hades tells Percy he saved Sally from the Minotaur, and kept her in the Underworld so that Percy would come to see him and hand over what he stole. He offers a simple trade, but after considering, Percy refuses his offer. He says he understands how Hades and Ares manages to get the Master Bolt and tricked him into delivering it to Hades, but he can't hand over the bolt, and pleads with Hades to let Sally go. Hades is confused, as he has not been conspiring with Ares, and in fact has no interest in the Master Bolt. He was offering to trade Sally for his Helm of Darkness, his symbol of authority and a powerful magic item, which he presumes Percy stole and used its power to turn invisible and steal the Master Bolt from Zeus. Percy and Grover don't understand Hades' disinterest in the bolt, also assuming Hades wants a war out of a grudge against his brothers, but the Lord of the Dead is perfectly comfortable in the Underworld and doesn't want to get involved in his siblings' squabbles. Whoever stole the bolt, it wasn't him. Percy finally puts the pieces together, and realizes that the defeated Titan lord Kronos is behind the theft. He is shattered but still alive in the depths of Tartarus, the entrance of which the flying shoes tried to pull him and Grover into just before the bolt appeared in their bag. The voice he's been hearing in his dreams was not Hades, but was in fact Kronos himself, wanting his help to destroy Olympus. Hades takes the revelation somberly, and after a moment offers Percy a new deal. He will provide sanctuary for Percy, Grover, and Sally if Percy gives him the bolt. If Kronos is coming back, Percy will need someone to protect him, and Hades will need to bolt as a weapon or bargaining chip. This time the offer is non-negotiable, as Hades won't let them leave with the Master Bolt. Percy rejects this offer but promises to honor his first one. He will find Hades' helm, and will return for his mother. He gives the signal, and he and Grover use the pearls to escape the Underworld before Hades can stop them.

Sally stands at the counter of the cafe, trying to stay calm. She lights a match from the counter and drops it into the remnants of a discarded sundae, making it a burnt offering. Instantly, a rainstorm begins outside, and a man walks in completely dry to stand beside her. Poseidon, Percy's father. Sally expresses her distress at seemingly failing to protect her son, but Poseidon tries to reassure her. She says she is going to take him to Camp Half-Blood, and tells the god of the sea about the Pegasus that followed him to school. If he stays with her in the middle of the city, eventually the more dangerous things will find him. However, she doesn't want to send him to camp. Poseidon asks her why, and she says that she wants him to have a chance to find his own way before the Olympians try to change him, and use him for their own gain. Poseidon listens intently, and encourages Sally to follow her instincts and send Percy to school instead of to camp. It will be difficult for them both, but he will become a stronger and better person for it. Sally asks him if he wants to speak to his son, to finally got to know him, but Poseidon says one day, when Percy has found out who he is and what he must do, when he needs him, Poseidon will be there. In the present, Percy and Grover wake up on the seashore and find Annabeth. As they rise, Ares approaches them, sword drawn. Percy uncaps his own sword, and prepares for battle."

On the shore of the sea, Percy challenges Ares to single combat in exchange for their lives and Hades' Helm of Darkness, first blood wins. The god of war is incredulous, but humorously accepts the challenge, warning Percy there cannot be any trace of him left to tell of Ares' plan to steal the bolt. Percy tells him he knows it was Kronos' plan, not Ares', asking if the Titan Lord spoke to him in his dreams like he did to Percy. Ares angerly insists that gods do not dream, and the two clash. Percy holds his own at first, narrowly avoiding being impaled on Ares' sword, but the war god's strength proves too much for the young half-blood. When Percy is kicked to the edge of the surf, the sea grows restless. As he rises, Percy summons the water into a massive tidal wave that smashes down upon Ares, washing him away. Before Ares can fully recover, Percy is able to deflect his sword and draw first blood, winning the challenge. Annabeth and Grover celebrate Percy's victory, but Ares warns Percy that he has made a permanent enemy of the god of war, before transforming into his true divine form and disappearing, leaving the helm behind. As they gather it, Percy hears a woman's voice from along the shore, turning to see his and his mother's cabin, realizing they are on the beach at Montauk. They go to the cabin, and find Alecto inside. Percy hands over the Helm of Darkness, understanding it, not the bolt, was what she had been sent to recover. He asks her to remind Hades of their deal, and release his mother. Alecto takes the helm and leaves, wishing Percy luck on Olympus. Grover and Annabeth try to talk Percy out of going to Zeus' palace to return the bolt. They have already missed their deadline, and Zeus will certainly kill him, either because he thinks he is the lightning thief, or merely because he is a forbidden child. Percy tells them he has to try and get Zeus to call off the war, as the last full-scale conflict between the gods began World War 2 on earth. Aside from that, Kronos wants the gods to fight as part of his plan to return from Tartartus. If they are to have any chance of stopping him, Percy must make an appeal to Zeus. Annabeth gives him her camp necklace for good luck, and Percy heads to the Empire State Building. He shows the guard the Master Bolt, and is let onto the elevator to the 600th floor. Percy exits the elevator onto Mount Olympus, a vast and beautiful city in the sky.

Before the quest, Luke continues teaching Percy about the gods and demigods. Percy realizes that the gods are all powerful, but must adhere to rules and laws that govern the use of their powers. Their children however, are not beholden to such rules. Percy asks if that means the half-bloods should deserve as much fear and respect as the gods themselves. Luke is proud of Percy for learning so quickly, but warns him to be careful of such ways of thinking. He likens the situation to Annabeth's intense fear of spiders; despite being so much bigger than them, she still fears them, though she still has the power to easily kill one when she runs into it. He tells Percy not to be both small and scary at the same time. In the present, Percy goes to Zeus' throne on the peak of the mountain, and presents the Master Bolt. He tells the king of the gods that he didn't steal it, and tried to return it on time, but Zeus points out his failure to do so before the deadline. He takes the bolt from Percy, who tells him about Kronos's attempt to rise from the Underworld. Zeus dismisses him, and seems unsurprised to hear his titan father is gathering strength, saying that's simple what immortals do, try to overthrow eachother. Nevertheless, he still intends to pursue his war with Poseidon. For returning the bolt, Percy will be allowed to leave alive. Percy demands he stop the war, but Zeus won't listen and will not negotiate, warning the young demigod to leave while he can. Percy is persistent, telling him Kronos wants the gods to weaken eachother and points out the easy betrayal of Ares, Zeus's own son. He tells him all the other gods follow him out of fear, not loyalty. If they fight, then once Kronos returns, the other gods will serve the more powerful being, and Zeus will cast down by his own family. Angered, Zeus moves to smite Percy where he stands, but is stopped by Poseidon. The sea god formally surrenders to his brother, asking only for his son's life in return. Zeus points out Percy should never have been born, but Poseidon reminds Zeus of his own child, Thalia, and the heroic deeds of her and other Half-Bloods like Percy. Satisfied enough with Poseidon's submission, they discuss the matter of their defeated father. Zeus leaves to call for a council of the gods, but warns Poseidon to make sure Percy never comes into his presence again. After he disappears, Poseidon finally comes face to face with his son. He recognizes Percy's stubborn nature, a trait inherent from the sea itself. Percy asks his dad if gods dream, and Poseidon tells him they do, no matter what Ares might say. Percy then asks if his father ever dreamt of Sally. The sea god does not answer, but becomes emotional at the question. Reluctantly, Poseidon tells Percy he should leave, and sends him back to Half-Blood Hill with another pearl.

Percy enters camp to a hero's welcome, and Annabeth is there waiting for him. He sees that Clarisse is still roaming free at camp, and Annabeth takes him to see Luke and explain. Luke tells him that while they were gone, the entire camp was on a knife's edge under the threat of their parents going to war. He couldn't risk accusing the head of the Ares cabin, Clarisse, without proof, or risk setting off their own war in camp. However, now that Percy has stopped the war, they can let Chiron know to bring her in. Annabeth volunteers to stay behind and watch Clarisse while Luke and Percy meet Chiron away from the main camp, and talk to him without Clarisse's cabin mates finding out. That night, as the celebrations commence, Luke takes Percy deep into the woods to wait for Chiron. Percy confides in Luke that he's still thinking about the prophecy, assuming that him ""failing to save what matters most in the end"" means Hades will never return his mother. Luke is empathetic, but tells him not to put too much stock in prophecies. Percy tells him that everything the Oracle told him has come true, but then remembers he forgot one line; ""You shall be betrayed by one who calls you friend"". He realizes that Chiron isn't coming to meet them, Luke never told him about Clarisse, because he knew she didn't steal the Master Bolt. Luke did. He helped Ares get the bolt into Percy's backpack, ready to appear as soon as the flying shoes Luke gave him pulled him into Tartarus, right down to Kronos. Luke tells him he was supposed to be wearing the shoes, not Grover, but says he never wanted to hurt Percy. He wanted to recruit him. He shows him his new sword, Backbiter, made of both Celestial Bronze and Steel, a magic item capable of tearing open secret doors in thin air. He starts to open one, and tells Percy they can escape through it and begin taking down the gods, with Kronos' help. The gods care only for themselves, demanding loyalty and great deeds and giving nothing in return, even to their own children. Percy doesn't want any part of Luke's plan to overthrow their parents, but Luke tells him the gods fear their offspring uniting against them. Kronos will bring back his golden age, without the selfish, petulant gods in charge. Percy says Kronos has gotten to him, but Luke tells him he finally knows the truth. He was able to steal the Helm and the Bolt all by himself, but for the next step, they will need help. Before he can finish cutting open the door, Percy draws his sword and stands in Luke's way. He tells him that despite their parents' flaws, they are trying their best, and still love them. He tells Luke he spoke to Hermes, but at the mention of his father, Luke attacks. Percy tries to hold him off, but Luke finishes opening the portal. He gives Percy one last chance to come with him, but Percy counter attacks, staggering Luke back. Thinking he's hurt his friend, Percy lowers his guard, and Luke takes advantage and disarms and injures Percy. He hesitates striking the killing blow, and suddenly deflects a dagger thrown by Annabeth, who used her invisibility cap and heard Luke's confession. Luke is stunned as she draws her own sword to defend Percy, and he bolts through the portal, which closes behind him.

On the last day of Summer, Percy packs to go home. Chiron comes to say goodbye. Percy reminds him he may be back if Hades hasn't held up his end of the bargain and returned his mother, but he needs to find out regardless. Chiron doesn't want Percy to go alone in case Luke comes looking for him, but Percy doesn't think Luke wants to kill him. Chiron is worried that Luke, and more importantly, Kronos, will want to sway Percy to their side as the son of Poseidon would make for a powerful ally. Percy assures him he won't be so easily persuaded to turn on them, and Chiron is proud of how far his student has come. Dionysus arrives to send away all the campers except those that will be staying year-round. Percy finds Annabeth at Thalia's tree on the border of camp. She is also packed to go home, having decided to give living with her dad and step-family another try. Percy is happy for her, and encourages he to just be a kid while she's gone. Grover meets them, and shows them his newly awarded Searcher's License. He will leave right away to begin his search for Pan, planning to skip the over-examined wildlands and try the seas instead. Percy tells him to let him know if he ever needs help. The three make a pact to meet eachother at Thalia's tree next year, no matter what, before saying goodbye.

Percy goes to the cabin at Montauk and finds Sally inside, and they tearfully reunite. After this, Percy finds himself once again in a dream, where he is greeted by the skeletal figure that's been haunting him; Kronos. He tells the titan lord to accept his defeat, but Kronos says they will meet again one day, in person, so long as the young demigod lives long enough. Percy warns him he won't be killed so easily, but Kronos is pleased. He needs Percy to survive, as he is an essential part of his return. Percy is woken up by his mom in their apartment, and he tells her he had another dream about Kronos, though he doesn't tell her what his titan grandfather said. Sally makes him blue pancakes, and the two leave to take Percy to his first day at a new school."

Lucy decides to write a check to Mr. Evans, but Vivian is worried about what Mr. Barnsdall will say. Lucy then carries the sheep into her car. Lucy is in the kitchen, commenting on how good the female sheep named Clementine is at chewing grass. Both her and Viv talk about how they could make money if it catches on, but it starts snowing, so she goes outside to get Clementine. Mr. Barnsdall comes in, wanting answers about why Lucy bought the sheep. Lucy enters with Clementine, telling the sheep to shake hands with Mr. Barnsdall. Lucy and everybody, except Sherman, who has wool in his ears, are awoken by the bleating of Clementine. Lucy decides to see if she can get Clementine to quit bleating. She attempts to do so by rocking the sheep and singing her a lullaby. Just as Lucy goes to sleep, Clementine runs in the room, bleating for Lucy. Viv comes in, complaining about the loud bleating. The girls agree to sneak Clementine back in her original pen, since Mr. Evans won't take her back. The next morning, Mr. Barnsdall comes in, saying a friend of his wants to take a picture of Clementine for a layout for a blanket company, accompanied with $200. Lucy agrees, despite Vivian worrying about going to jail for kidnapping. That night, Lucy and Vivian manage to find the sheep by singing to it. In the morning, when about to take the picture and make the money, the boys have pulled off Clementine's wool, to sell to pay for their cafeteria food, as Lucy and Vivian never told them about the sheep's career. Lucy then yells for the boys to get some glue."

But ours doesn't start the way you think.""---Jim Powell

Jim Powell (Michael Chiklis) wants his family to get together and do things as a family. Apparently, playing charades (where he throws out his back trying to give an Iron Man clue) doesnt count, according to his daughter, Daphne (Kay Panabaker). Jim's suggestion is to join Stephanie's (Julie Benz) excursion to Brazil, where she needs to do some research as part of her job for a bioengineering company. Daphne is more than happy to let them go on their own and have them Photoshop her in later, since they TwitterSpy on her anyway. But he insists they go. Stephanie isn't too enthused, but it'll beat getting poison ivy at the Grand Canyon.

All well and good, only the small plane they go on to look at the rainforests gets caught in a storm. They crash into a river in the Amazon. The pilot doesn't survive, but the rest of the family does. Obviously all of them are grateful to be alive, and Jim hopes the near-death experience makes them closer as a family. But it turns out things are back to the way they were once they return home. Or so they think.

Jim had been lamenting the fact that his family had grown up and didn't need their dad anymore, nor did Stephanie need her husband with how busy she was at work. She tries for a romantic ""date night"" (I'm single, and even I know it's not a good sign when you have to arrange dates when you're married), but even that gets pushed back by work. This is what Jim relays to his best friend and co-worker at the police station, D.A. George St. Cloud (Romany Malco). He recommends couples' counseling, admitting one of his two marriages might have worked if he did that. That may help the marriage, but it won't help his increasingly-frustrating job as a police sketch artist. It was the job he took when he couldn't make a dime as a real artist, and since everything is computerized, he works with a mouse instead of a paintbrush. Suddenly, a detained criminal grabs a beat cop's pistol and tries to fire. Jim pushes one of his co-workers out of the way and steps in front of the bullet. He caught the bullet...in his hand instead of a vest. He is, to say the least, shocked.

""In the morning, there's that split second just before you wake up when the world hasn't pressed itself in on your chest, before you remember your work, or the husband you can't connect with, or the kids you fear you'll disappoint.""---Stephanie Powell

This particular morning, however, she woke up to seeing her husband giving himself two tickets to his own gun show in the mirror. She wondered why he's so happy...and suddenly able to rip door handles off the door. She really hadn't noticed anything since she didn't have time due to work. But there was no time, as she had to drop off the kids and deal with Daphne making moves on her boyfriend. As Stephanie goes to work and talks about her successful trip to Brazil (minus the plane crash, of course), Jim has to find out about that bullet. He goes to a batting cage and sets the pitching machine to max, even breaking into the machine to set it higher. The machine gives him the heater, and he catches every single one, even crushing several of them in the process. Now for the ultimate test: having George fire a gun at him. The squeamish George (understandably squeamish about shooting his best friend) finally does it, fires it nowhere near Jim, but he still catches the bullet. George has a sudden desire to be the Q to Jim's James Bond. He's completely on-board, even encouraging Jim to find out if he can fly. (A ""Greatest American Hero"" joke would have worked so well right then.) Jim leaps off of a building and falls right to the ground...20 stories below. The street will need serious work, but Jim's OK. He returns to George, by jumping all the way up. He can't fly, but he can jump really, really high and far.

Stephanie has a problem, as she has to meet the chairman of the company to talk about researching her project, but she also has to get to her son's school, as JJ (Jimmy Bennett) has to meet with a counselor. She has to run...and she does. At blinding speed. Instead of running for her car, she ends up on the 405, thanks to an ""unexplained phenomenon."" She goes to her assistant in the lab, Katie (Autumn Reeser). She tells Katie in confidence about her new ability, although Katie was a bit on the neurotic side to handle it. But a little demonstration of getting Katie's Kitty Pryde X-Men doll from her cubicle (several floors down) in seconds amazes her. She is a scientist, and experimentation is the name of the game. Using a speed gun, Katie clocks Stephanie doing over 700 miles per hour around a horse racing track. Yet Stephanie doesn't get dust sandblasting her eyes...and her clothes don't shred...and windshear doesn't bother her. All good questions. Stephanie's increased metabolic rate makes her life ""like a never-ending spin class, but now she could wolf down an extra value meal and keep her size zero figure...and every woman on the planet now hates her. Thanks to her newfound speed, she suddenly had an extra hour of free time. She calls Jim and decides she wants to do something where she's grateful he isn't the fast one.

One tiny problem: both of them also gained the power of being super-honest, as Stephanie complains Jim had given up on their marriage long ago, and Jim complained Stephanie doesn't even know what's going on with her own family, such as Daphne fearing losing her boyfriend because another girl is willing to sleep with him or JJ could have a learning disability. She's none too happy about being grilled like that, but suddenly he's about to look like a hypocrite as George calls him about a bank robber Jim was trying to sketch earlier. He goes into action, doing the Spiderman thing with jumps instead of shooting spiderwebs out of his wrists. He finds the getaway car...by landing on it. He pulls out the man wearing an Obama mask and easily takes him down. Unfortunately, he never saw the crook's partner in another Obama mask, who puts a bullet through the back of Jim's head. The bullet doesn't go through, but enough damage is done where Jim can't pursue the man any further.

George finds him and stiches him up...in his house. Jim's first thought is that Stephanie will never understand what he is going through, but obviously Stephanie is quite sympathetic to his plight. She runs and gets the sketch Jim did of her on their first date...in about half a second.

GEORGE: OK, you people are freaky.

Stephanie figures out that there was a phosphorescent glow in the river where they crashed, which she originally thought was gasoline from the plane. Except gasoline floats on water. Daphne calls from school because she started hearing the thoughts of every single person on the basketball court where she was playing, including the girl who was secretly taking her boyfriend away from her. Stephanie gathers the family to explain, but Daphne is just freaking out. She tries to deny everything, and JJ is upset because nothing has happened to him.

DAPHNE: We went on a vacation to reconnect? Why did we want to connect in the first place?!? All of the vacations we go on won't fix this family because this family isn't broken! You two are!

Both kids retreat to their rooms, and Jim and Stephanie have to admit Daphne's right. Unfortunately, Daphne finds out the hard way her abilities are not temporary, as she reads her boyfriend's mind and finds out he's sleeping with her best friend. (ouch!)

Jim sketches the man he found, Reed Koblenz, and hands it off to a couple of detectives. Detective Cho tell him it's not his case, but he feels that itch and arranges his own transportation to find the man. The detectives find the woman who last posted his bail, and he shows up. One detective is killed, and Koblenz takes the other hostage. He puts Detective Cho in the trunk of his car as Jim finds him. Jim thinks he can take Koblenz...but Koblenz has powers, too. He can disappear and reappear (kind of like the Albino twins in The Matrix Reloaded (2003)), and played his own partner when he shot Jim in the alley. Jim gives it his best, but the man is just too quick. Fortunately for Jim, Koblenz does the classic stupid move of talking too much. Apparently, there are plenty of people like Jim and Koblenz. However, Detective Cho kills Koblenz before he can say anything else.

After dealing with what Jim typically went through with the family, Stephanie appreciated how he kept the family together and begs him to promise her not to go running into danger just to prove himself. Which he does. JJ aces an algebra exam the next day as he can see the answers in his mind quite easily. George builds Jim a lair...with wi-fi. Unfortunately, someone wants the family dead for knowing abut Koblenz. The man? Stephanie's boss."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1701843/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"While Jim and Stephanie agree to not use their powers anymore till they understand them better, Daphne agrees not to reveal JJ's super power to their parents.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['David Semel'],"['', '', '']",[],"['bank robber', 'jealousy', 'neighbor', 'accused of cheating', 'murder', 'water tank', 'ferris wheel', 'teacher', 'carnival', 'sidekick', 'police sketch artist', 'high school', 'getaway car', 'bank robbery']",[],"You can take the cop out of crimefighting, but you can't take the crimefighter out of the cop. Jim Powell (Michael Chiklis) decided he wasn't going to spend the rest of his life as a sketch artist, so he is using his new powers of strength and leaping a quarter-mile at a time to stopping a bank robbery...provided he can find a better GPS than George (Romany Malco). Jim makes it to the bank just in time to have the getaway car come at him. And Michael Chiklis pretending he was playing the other superhero he was famous for didn't work, as the getaway car simply ran him over. back at home, Stephanie (Julie Benz) prepares for lunch for Daphne (Kay Panabaker)...rather quickly of course. Daphne is suddenly best friends with her iPod, as it helps to drown out other people's thoughts. JJ (Jimmy Bennett) is doing his homework to everybody's surprise. Obviously he hasn't told the family he has powers now.

Stephanie is more than happy to gloat about how much time she now had thanks to her gift of speed, and Katie (Autumn Reeser) is only too happy to be the ""best sidekick ever"" by listening to Stephanie gloat and even got her hands on a sample of the river the Powells landed in that gave them their abilities in the first place. School has changed for JJ because he's doing well, and Daphne is really starting to appreciate her headphones drowning out the thoughts of every single kid in school. Given what some of them think, it's understandable. Jim sketches a drawing of the bank robber he saw (old-school, with a pencil) and tries to convince Detective Cho to follow-up, but he can't give much details on the witness (him), so he lies and pretends he was at the bank anyway. Cho is suspicious.

Stephanie gets baited by the high school mom equivalent of a Desperate Housewives resident to work the school fair over the weekend. SHe finishes the household tasks, only to find Jim's sweater with tire tracks on them. Stephanie reads him the riot act about both risking his life and lying to her about it. She's worried about not knowing anything about these powers, and he thinks they got them for a reason. She should be more worried about the advice George is giving Jim. Such as pretending he's Brian Urlacher when trying to stop a car. (Granted, it was the offense who lost the game for the Bears against the Giants, but still...) Of course, Katie thinks Stephanie is married to Batman. (Hopefully Christian Bale, but she'd settle for Keaton)

JJ hits the library, to the surprise of the librarian, but goes to study the toughest book on trigonometry the library has. Only Daphne went there for some peace and quiet and immediately picked up JJ's thoughts. The secret is out, naturally.

DAPHNE: What are you doing...thinking?!?!?

JJ describes what he can do. He can't retain things for long, but any time he sees a math problem, he gets it. He didn't tell his parents, because he liked them being proud of him for once. Daphne promises not to say anything but warns him they'll figure it out eventually. Unfortunately, he may want to explain it to his math teacher, who thinks he's cheating, and won't take JJ's verbal explanation of the homework as evidence to the contrary. But without JJ telling his dad the truth, Jim takes the teacher's side. Daphne tells him to tank the occasional test and be a C or B student, which would still make the parental units proud and keep his teachers off his back.

As Detective Cho investigates the bank robbery, with Dr. King's assistant following surreptitiously, Stephanie is giving it good to the fair committee by donating her company's private box at the opera for a silent auction gift. Katie calls her and tells her to get back, as Dr. King (Stephen Collins) is looking over her stuff at that very moment. She high-tails it out of there, as only she can. She learns a lesson about not checking her messages while running fast...the hard way. Jim discovers she had a car accident without a car, but Stephanie's increased metabolism means she can go the full Wolverine and heal herself very quickly. But he still insists on bed for her. Jim thinks she might be right about using their powers being dangerous.

STEPHANIE: Say my three favorite words.

JIM: You. Were. Right.

George did not take the news well. As a district attorney, he wasn't happy about losing his best crimefighter, but Jim said family had to come first. Stephanie had to take a trip to Arizona, where her water sample from the Amazon accidentally went. (yes, she ran) Jim is not happy about her using her powers after promising not to do it himself. She's upset...so much so she doesn't leave Jim any muffins. The family heads for the school fair, but George finds the sketch Jim made and goes to investigate. As does Dr. King's assistant, who tries to get information from Detective Cho without success. Daphne is overwhelmed by the voices at the fair, so Stephanie takes her up on the Ferris Wheel to get away from it. She helps Daphne concentrate on only one voice, and now she's able to control who she hears. And Jim has to learn to resist the jackass cop at his precinct who made the mistake of being in the water tank at the fair...and talking smack.

George heads to the bank to pass around the sketch of the bank robber, just as three men decide to pull a bank robbery. George calls him quietly, and Stephanie tells him to bring him back. They rob the bank and take George as a hostage. Jim finds them and tries to Urlacher the car. Only this time, he's smart enough to grab the axle of the car and hold it in place. Jim runs in order to not be identified by the cops, but Detective Cho spots him. She confronts him at his house and he fesses up what is going on. She's skeptical, but one lifted van later, she thinks he's a vigilante. He tries to explain about Koblenz's teleporting, but she won't have it.

JIM: I understand you feel like that now, but eventually you're going to need me. Because trust me; you can't catch these people without me.

Jim goes back into the house and apologizes to JJ, now that he knew what it was like not to have people believe him. Stephanie confronts him about having to save George. She'll have to live with him wanting to save people because the marriage wasn't helping him from being lost. But she serves notice that she has every intention of curing the family of what happened, and she was going to make him give it up once that happened. And something in the Belem water sample is incredibly telling in that it didn't tell them anything. The water didn't have anything in it.

Dr. Knight's assistant is able to find Detective Cho, and it turns out he has the power of telekinesis, as he grabs Cho's gun and chokes her, Darth Vader-style, into confessing she knew about Koblenz's abilities. She doesn't tell him about Jim, and is shot dead."

He tells George (Romany Malco) that he's still upset that Detective Cho was murdered and he couldn't do anything about it. Unfortunately, the wedding the family attends (and he misses because he forgot about it) is being robbed. Given the large crowd and men with automatic weapons, Stephanie stops him from doing anything in there, even though she loses her diamond ring as a result. Jim goes after them as they scale up a building, but he misses them on the jump.

Stephanie (Julie Benz) gets the grant from the Board of Directors to study her plant, but the large life insurance policy the company takes on her means she has to take a physical. Katie (Autumn Reeser) starts planning strategy to make sure the doctor doesn't find out about any changes that have happened to Stephanie. Stephanie worries about the blood test, so Katie takes the physical for her behind her back. Only Stephanie got her blood screened when she first worked at the company. When they see the two different samples, they'll slap the cuffs on both of them. A burglary must be planned.

At school, JJ (Jimmy Bennett) finds a cute girl who is interested in his new-found powers. Daphne (Kay Panabaker) runs into a classmate who is having problems at home. At least, that's what Daphne hears in her head. Daphne invites her over to the house and finds out Megan's parents are getting a divorce. Unfortunately, she mentions it...even though Megan never mentioned it...and Megan can't leave the house faster. Daphne is ticked and wants to tell someone about her powers, but Jim already learned that lesson, thanks to George's comic-book reading.

GEORGE: There's a reason why those guys have secret identities. 'Cause the minute they find out, it's over. Someone gets robbed and you can't stop it? Jim's fault. You can't be in two places at once and someone gets killed? Jim's fault.

Of course, Jim told George and Stephanie told Katie, so the kids see some pot/kettle action going on. Jim and Stephanie meet with the kids and agree the kids should get someone, too. And they offer Katie and George to them. Not exactly what Daphne and JJ had in mind. But things aren't all bad. JJ effectively blackmails Daphne into finding out if that girl really likes him. She can rat on him to their parents all she wants, but it won't get her 12-page book report on The Iliad written any faster. Daphne confronts the girl JJ likes, Sara, in the hall. Sara tells Daphne JJ is nice, but her mind says otherwise.

George and Jim figure out the crooks who knocked over the wedding they were at have hit other weddings, so they go the Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson route and start crashing weddings. Minus the hooking up afterwards...and we find out why Jim stepped on Stephanie's toes at their wedding. It sounds all well and good until the lights go out like last time and someone walks in with a knife. And who wants to bet Jim tackles said person, only to find out they were coming in to cut the wedding cake and thus ruining the reception? Yup.

George takes Jim to work on being able to dance, land safely, and jump to appropriate places to catch the bad guys. George tries to teach him to dance. And ""Booty Quake Hits of the 90's"" works until Jim tries a spin and damages the house...not to mention Daphne's eyesight when she sees him. But she was going to play along and ask George a question about how to tell JJ Sara wasn't interested in him. George tells her to tell JJ Sara is interested in a different type of guy...athlete, astronaut, rock star... whatever JJ isn't. And Daphne settles on a Jewish guy, which JJ isn't. Sounds like a good idea, except JJ is determined, can look things up on Google, and can memorize the entire Hebrew language in only a few minutes.

Daphne goes to talk to Jim because she is wondering what he was doing earlier with George. However, what he was about to do now with George was more important, as George calls him about another wedding reception. Jim tries to lie to cover his tracks, obviously forgetting his daughter could read his thoughts and knew what hotel he was going to instead of the precinct.

DAPHNE: Dad, you wouldn't lie to me, right? You'd always tell me the truth?

JIM: Always.

Stephanie and Katie swipe an access card from a co-worker and go into the basement lab to retrieve the sample. That is, Stephanie does, and speed was definitely an asset on this. JJ invites Sara over for homework and tries to give her the full Rabbi Brad Pitt, which of course doesn't work. JJ is confused and asks her why she only dates Jewish guys. She denies it and leaves, and JJ suddenly figures out something you don't learn in books.

George and Jim make it to the wedding, and it was the right call. The robbers make the hit. They stay down and wait to make their move. Jim takes out someone, only to be shot by one of his partners with an assault rifle. Fortunately, Jim's natural bullet-proof shield is mistaken for Kevlar, and the robbers think there are cops at the wedding. They high-tail it out, and Daphne makes it to the hotel. Jim makes it up to the roof and accidentally throws one off of the roof. Unfortunately, nobody saw anything, and falling on the hood of a squad car won't link him to the robbers. George has to let the man go, but at least he got back Stephanie's ring.

Back at home, Daphne is understandably upset at Jim for lying to her. As is Stephanie. Daphne's had enough of Jim lying to her, especially when she could always count on him to be honest. She goes off to tell Megan what happened to their family. Stephanie stops Jim from following her because she can sympathize with Megan, who doesn't have a George or Katie to talk to for herself. Daphne apologizes to Megan for acting so weird, but Daphne pretended she overheard her mother talking about the divorce at the supermarket. Daphne is still upset about her father going out and risking his life like he is. Jim tells her how important family is, and that he's finally doing something he thinks he should be doing. Later, Jim takes Stephanie to her favorite restaurant. Actually, to the roof of it, as it takes six months to get reservations. They decide to enjoy the good things about using their powers as Jim returns Stephanie's diamond ring. He never liked the ring, but it was the only ring he could afford when he proposed. He tells her he never forgot her saying she thought how beautiful the ring was...and they dance on the roof.

Dr. King (Stephen Collins) calls in the scientist whose keycard was used by Stephanie to access the lab. Of course, he doesn't know it happened. By running the surveillance down to frame-by-frame, Dr. King sees the lift."

His patrol area this week is Franklin Park, ""where you can get poison ivy, crack, and sexually assaulted at the same time,"" according to George (Romany Malco). However, a woman getting mugged will do, and Jim springs into action...literally. The only problem is someone beats him to it and shoots the mugger. Jim has no choice but to take the guy to the hospital. He does leave a note, except the media caught wind of it and assumed the same person who shot the guy brought him to the hospital, which certainly doesn't make Stephanie (Julie Benz) happy. Stephanie complained about Jim when he didn't have a hobby, and now she's complaining when he does, according to Katie (Autumn Reeser). (Sounds like being on some of the IMDb boards.) But Katie thinks it beats being a stamp collector, since their fingers are always sticky and their tongues are always dry. (Autumn really shouldn't have been on Entourage before saying that.) But Stephanie has bigger problems to worry about. Dr. Childs, the scientist whose ID card they lifted last week to switch out her blood sample, is now on her team. All that was missing was a ""Hello, Newman."" It was bad timing, as they did an analysis of the DNA breakdown of the plant. There were trace elements to the plant that were also in the bloodwork of Jim, Stephanie, and Daphne. And now they know what we figured out in the pilot: the plant was affected the same way as them.

As Jim tries to get the police to look for his vigilante...with no success...Daphne (Kay Panabaker) and JJ (Jimmy Bennett) are finding ways to put their powers to good use at school. Daphne is going to try to get her friends into an exclusive party by mind-reading someone to give them the secret location, and JJ discovered that he can analyze football practice and get the game down to a science. Jim cancels the camping trip he was going to take JJ on as a reward for his good grades until he catches this guy. ""Until the next guy,"" as Stephanie accurately points out. But JJ is cool with it, as he plans to join the football team. Jim is skeptical, as JJ never showed interest in it before, but JJ takes offense to it. JJ finds the football coach and makes a deal to ace his history test in exchange for a tryout.

George, after Jim and he straighten out a little fight they had earlier, discover the vigilante, Meyers, shot the man who shot his son many years back after the man walked, and they theorize he's been doing it ever since. (BTW, when you do those city montages, don't splice together shots of Boston, New York, and Chicago in the same sequence.) They trace Meyers to a bar on the south side, and George briefs Jim on how to get Meyers to open up: pretend it's a blind date. Jim tries by talking about his son. It doesn't work. Jim got the impression Meyers was someone who just wanted to be left alone, as he did talk about being estranged from his son. However, Jim was wrong, as he makes it to the park again in time to hear a gunshot and see another dead perp. He calls out to Meyers, who runs. He checks the body, and the hoodie he's wearing doesn't endear him to the two witnesses who immediately call 911. Worse, they come to the station the next day to give him a description of who they saw. Jim slips on a co-worker's Coke Bottle glasses to disguise himself, and the couple gives the description. Round, middle-aged, thin, long hair (oh, good!), Cupid's Bow lips, just like Jim's.

JJ makes Rudy (1993) look like he was on steroids compared to his teammates. But the coach gives him one snap behind center. JJ's mind calculates the receiver's route, times the spot, and even tells him to angle the ball differently as he throws it. Touchdown, and JJ has a spot on the team. But his math coach has decided to spy on him and makes a call. JJ gets the third degree from Daphne, who is really into that whole pot/kettle thing given she scammed the location of the party from a stuck-up senior. But Mr. Litchfield instantly accuses JJ of being on drugs. (Seriously, this guy would have been fired by now in any school.) Jim and Stephanie are livid, but the teacher wants to know what could have caused JJ to have such a remarkable transformation both in the classroom and on the football field in such a short time. Jim and Stephanie confront JJ about it, and he goes into full denial. He can't believe they're accusing him of having powers, even though he does. Jim and Stephanie feel guilty about it, but Jim has a bigger problem, as he sketched the ""perp"" a little too well. Jim is on the news as the vigilante. Stephanie is upset because Jim is doing the same thing Stephanie was doing.

STEPHANIE: You can't have it both ways. You have to decide what kind of person you want to be. Do you want to be a parent, or do you want to be a vigilante?

Detective Cordero is none too happy that the sketch looks just like Jim, but George runs interference for him by bringing in Meyers' rap sheet. They bring Meyers in for a line-up, but the two witnesses don't finger him.

Daphne is in the party...and so is JJ. She accuses him of using his powers to get into the party, and JJ doesn't let her get away with that. Only problem is, JJ was actually invited, and Daphne wasn't. A little factoid the girl she scammed the location from points out. Daphne, however, has a way to stay in. She donates several bottles from the store she was at earlier. The store where she overheard the clerk think about taking a $50 out of the register. And the plan works great, except she can't prove the guy was taking money out of the register, but he can prove she was trying to buy alcohol illegally. Jim and Stephanie are not particularly happy about it, as one would imagine. She's about to spend a couple of months grounded, but JJ actually comes to her defense, saying she didn't drink at the party, and she only got as far as getting in. He admitted being at the party himself. Now Jim and Stephanie are mad at each other. Stephanie is ticked that Jim is no longer there being a parent, but he wants to know when it's going to be her turn to cover for him.

Katie continued her research into Dr. Volson, who spent a considerable amount of research time analyzing the genetic strands of DNA and seeing if there were any anomalies in them, and if those could be fixed. It was research Stephanie also looked at and Dr. Childs found by rifling through all of Stepanie's work. Dr. Volson must have been on to something big, because the research suddenly stopped, and Volson hadn't been heard from since.

Jim tries a new approach to capturing his vigilante: talking to him. He finds him at the bar drowning his sorrows. Meyers continues to deny it, saying he lost his kid long before he was shot. Meyers ""missed his chance to save him."" He also wonders if Jim loves his own kids so much, why is he in the bar with him? He comes home to a family that won't talk to him, so he decided to talk. He's mad at Daphne because she abused her powers, but he's equally mad at himself because he used his powers to feel better about himself, too. Jim suggests taking the lesson from JJ, who worked hard to make himself feel special without powers. (so they think) JJ managed to continue lying, and Daphne is upset for him doing that. Everybody, however, will go to JJ's football game, including Daphne. And somehow, JJ being the 3rd string quarterback doesn't stop him from playing, since this is a TV show. JJ's play is interspersed with Meyers returning to the park to stop another assault, only JJ gets sacked hard after throwing the ball, and the assault was two cops flushing Meyers out. He gets shot when he doesn't drop his gun, but JJ throws a touchdown pass. But it wasn't worth it for him."

However, the Powells just happen to get caught there when a small tremor goes off in Pacific Bay (the town they live in, which strangely looks like New York, Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and San Diego all at the same time). JJ (Jimmy Bennett) has to stop Jim (Michael Chiklis) from just going full strength on a shelving unit, as his mind calculates it'll crush the lady under it if he does. But with JJ's assistance, Jim undoes the puzzle and save the lady. But Stephanie (Julie Benz) is now suspicious about JJ being a brain, despite Jim still trusting JJ. It is a concern for George (Romany Malco), who bribes his source (and don't kid yourself, Frappucinos are pricey) to discover Mother Nature didn't cause the quake. George relays the information to Jim, as investigators theorize the concussion grenades work like EMP's to knock out power, and another pharmacy being hit where the pharmacist is killed confirms what George discovered. Stephanie has a bigger problem: she's convinved JJ has superpowers but doesn't want to accuse him of it since he told Jim and her he didn't have them. Her solution? Drug testing. She tries to sell him on the fact she needs a control subject without powers but with the families' DNA, but he's just creeped out. And so is Daphne (Kay Panabaker) over something even more out there: one of her classmates is meeting with a teacher. Daphne was applying at a coffee shop far from school to not have to serve some of the skankier classmates, and she confirms through reading the teacher's mind he's a candidate for a Dateline special. Of course, Mr. Robbins is such a horrible liar, even Daphne's friend, Megan, figured it out.

Stephanie meets with Dr. King (Stephen Collins), who congratulates her on the Board celebrating her findings...although it's the plant that's the star...but he is in damage control about a weapon he thinks is on the loose. Katie (Autumn Reeser) continues digging into Dr. Volson's research. The only thing she could find is an encrypted file she had to work on. Stephanie is upset that JJ is keeping a secret from her.

KATIE: So, he's trying to maintain his secret identity from everybody. Most superheroes don't reveal their identities to their families.

STEPHANIE: Katie, I'm his mother.

KATIE: Interesting little tidbit: most superheroes don't have mothers. Either they're dead or back on the home planet.

JJ has a teammate give him a clean urine sample to give to his mother, and Daphne pulls the mind-reading on the student who may or may not be dating Mr. Robbins. Meanwhile, Jim wants to get his hands on the security footage at the second pharmacy. But the tape is in the evidence lockup. He needs someone to quickly lift the tape after he breaks the lock to get into the room. Stephanie is none too thrilled about being asked this favor, but George tries a little lie: the tape shows George using his powers. She's not happy, but she'll do it. Jim is none too happy about having his wife commit a felony, but the ruse pays off. They locate the woman who stole the medications from the pharmacy.

JJ brings the sample to Katie, who is trying to break the encryption of Dr. Volson's research. Naturally, JJ is able to break the encryption just by looking at it. He cracks it for Katie and leaves before she discovers it. Except it wasn't that simple, and Katie calls him on the carpet about it, correctly deducing he had superpowers. She wants to know why he wouldn't tell his parents, but when Stephanie gushed to Katie about cracking the encryption, she understood why JJ did it. Katie promised to keep quiet...for now. But JJ better use his big brain to figure out why his urine sample showed he was pregnant. The Volson files contained blueprints for a building, which only complicated things further. Stephanie asked Katie to run another encryption algorithm to get the files unlocked. And JJ's secret is now out. Jim and Stephanie are ticked, and Stephanie wants him off the football team. And JJ sees the hypocrisy in it because everybody else in the family is using their powers. Later on, they relent and let JJ play football. He gets creamed ten yards short of scoring the winning touchdown in a game and hangs up the cleats because he agrees his point was made about the family using their powers.

Daphne admits to her mother she overheard her classmate, Olivia, and she doesn't know what to do. Stephanie wants her to make sure she heard it correctly, as these were serious allegations Daphne was claiming. Daphne confronts the teacher, who emphatically tells her he would never get involved with one of his students. One of his students' mothers, however, was a different story. Olivia confronted Daphne after the principal called Mr. Robbins into his office. Olivia's mother and Mr. Robbins had to break up in order for him to keep his job. Daphne tries to apologize to Olivia but to no avail. She apologizes to Mr. Robbins, who concedes he could have handled it better and that Daphne had Olivia's best interests in mind when she reported him.

George and Jim investigate Rebecca Jessup, the woman who was hitting the pharmacies, but her record indicated nothing more than some check kiting. Not to mention, the tape showed the only thing Rebecca stole was an anti-epileptic drug. It didn't make any sense. However, she does commit another robbery, only Jim catches up to her. Jim tries to reason with her, but Rebecca sends a shockwave at Jim and throws him through a building. Which would explain no bomb fragments at any of the robbery sites. (""Why do the bad guys always get the cool powers?"") It may also explain why she was stealing the epilepsy medications. Jim can't tell Stephanie, because Jim never told her about the human transporter from the garage.

While Jim and Stephanie are upset at each other for the problems these powers are causing, Rebecca pays a visit to Dr. King, who had her locked up with the rest of the experiments. She escaped and was trying to use the epilepsy pills to get rid of her powers to no avail. She is ready to kill Dr. King until she gets tranqued by a couple of his bodyguards. They should have used a more powerful tranquilizer because she wakes up and kills the guards with shockwaves. Except it happens in the parking garage of GlobalTech, so everybody upstairs feels the tremors. Jim knows what it is, and he goes to confront her. She thought she killed him before and tried again, only Jim was ready for it and survived her shockwaves.

REBECCA: You're one of us. They got to you, too.

JIM: What are you talking about? Who is 'us'?

Jim tries to get her to tell him the story, but she grabs him and tries to kill him. Jim is knocked out, but Dr. King's enforcer deflects her shockwaves and uses them to throw her into a concrete wall, ending her life. Of course, now Jim has to face the music with Stephanie. She's upset with him, but she also admitted she was researching Dr. Volson's work. They are worried, but they realize they can't control everything. They'll just try to make it through the best way they can."

The Powells have something equally scary at their door: Stephanie's parents. (Cybill Shepherd and Bruce McGill). They were thinking of helping out the Powells for a few days as they went by on the way to a convention. And apparently, Stephanie's father, Allan Crane, is very happy Jim (Michael Chiklis) is finally lifting some weights, judging by the handshake. Stephanie (Julie Benz) doesn't want anybody to give any indication to them they have any sort of superpowers. Of course, Jim wants to show them off because Allan never liked him, and Stephanie is already having a hissy fit about it. (gotta side with her on that one)

STEPHANIE: When your mother and stepdad came to visit, I agreed not to have sex while they were in the house.

JIM: OK, as much as I would like to believe sex is one of my superpowers, I'm sure this falls under a completely different argument.

But it's like the DH in baseball: home team decides. In this case, her parents, her rules. Although her mother, Barbara, baiting her about having a full refrigerator and a clean house is tempting her beyond the straining point. Thankfully for Jim, George (Romany Malco) saves him from ""Satan's branch of the AARP"" by telling him about the real home invasion that happened last night. Stephanie vaguely remembered Jim taking a few days off from work with her parents there, and Jim vaguely forgot he said that."" She's so thankful for GlobalTech all of a sudden. But George gives him both barrels at work when Jim tries to weasel out.

GEORGE: You do know if you're holding back because of your in-laws, you're letting the terrorists win.

JIM: They're not terrorists.

GEORGE: Yes they are! Emotional terrorists. And they've been waging war on your marriage for years! THEY HATE YOUR FREEDOM!

George has a point, as Barbara and Allan commit a MAJOR invasion of the Powell's privacy. And they want answers from Jim and Stephanie. The running shoes, the hole in the wall, and the candy bars by their bed. Jim and Stephanie keep it quiet, but her parents aren't swayed so easily.

At school, Daphne (Kay Panabaker) finds Trent, whose house got broken into. She tries to talk to him, but he was very tight-lipped. He said he didn't see anything, but she mind-read that he lied to the police. Even more, when she grabbed his arm, she went The Dead Zone (1983) on him, seeing what he saw. Daphne's powers are starting to improve.

JJ (Jimmy Bennett) talks to Grandpa about his car not working properly. Allan tells him to find a skill he's good at if he isn't good in school, like auto repair. Of course, he's tinkering away at his car and JJ already has it figured out. But since they promised Jim and Stephanie not to reveal their powers, JJ lets him work on his own.

Daphne discusses what happened with Trent to her parents. Jim is excited because he could sketch the crook Daphne saw that Trent wouldn't talk about, but she didn't see enough of it when she touched Trent. Stephanie immediately vetoes any thought of Daphne trying to find out more. In the meantime, Jim and JJ will run block with Allan while Stephanie deals with her mother. Daphne isn't thrilled about having to go to school while JJ gets to ditch, but her only other choice is to help Stephanie.

George calls in the middle of the night and guilts Jim into going out on night patrol...which Allan sees him do. However, the worst that happens is George gets stopped for DWB (Driving While Black), which an Assistant District Attorney can easily get out of.

Daphne goes ""undercover"" to find Trent and bribes Trent with grandma's cookies and some sympathy for whatever Trent had to go through. She puts her hand on his, and it works. Trent DID see his assailant, who threatened to kill his parents if he ever said a word. She tracks down Jim at the police station. Jim doesn't want her getting involved, but she pointed out it was already too late. Jim relents and sketches the perp Daphne saw. Jim walks it into his boss, who wonders how Jim could have gotten a description of the man from Trent when Trent told the police he was wearing a mask. Jim told his boss to keep it in house because Trent was scared, which he begrudginly agreed. Of course, Detective Cordero is a jerk, and the sketch is on the evening news.

Stephanie takes Barbara to work, and Katie (Autumn Reeser) immediately puts her lips on Barbara's caboose. (""Your womb was the gestation point for scientific greatness!"") However, Barbara likes the way Katie's lab coat looks on her (we all do), and Stephanie has no trouble wanting to snare Katie into having dinner with the family. Katie thinks Stephanie should open up to her mother more.

Jim and JJ take Grandpa out to shoot some pool, and Granpa's antagonization is testing JJ on not using his powers. Granpa is playing JJ for money and making him pay up.

ALLAN: When you make a mistake, you gotta live with the consequences. Just like I told Stephanie when I walked her down the aisle.

Jim tells Allan to play JJ one more time, and Jim signals JJ to take the gloves off. But Allan is too thick-headed, even when JJ starts beating the pants off of him. He wagers his car on JJ finishing the game, three balls plus the 8-ball, on a single shot. You can guess how that went.

Stephanie sees the newscast and goes off on Jim, as does Daphne. She is understandably upset, since Trent is now in danger as an eyewitness and she's scared what she did will get him hurt. Cordero doesn't give a crap, although he did at least put a uniformed officer on Trent's house for protection. Jim and George leap to Trent's house, with Jim carrying George. (""You just made me feel all girly inside."") But Stephanie texts him and tells him to get home immediately, as even her Martha-Stewart-at-Warp-Speed imitation won't stop her overly-antagonizing mother. At least JJ is trying to help by bragging he took Grandpa's car. But Allan is at full boil and takes it out on Jim because he was a few minutes late and constantly taking phone calls. Allan accuses Jim of cheating on Stephanie. And Barbara twists the knife further by telling Stephanie that if she wasn't so obsessed with work, she would have seen the signs. Jim is bursting to tell the truth, but Stephanie finally lashes out at her parents for always criticizing her decisions, her husband, and her kids. And she doesn't want to wait around for them to get a clue. She walks out of the house.

KATIE: (awkward) So, who wants cake?

Stephanie has to blow off some steam, so she goes running. All the way to the Grand Canyon.

George finally figured out how to get down from the roof...rather painfully. However, he discovers the cop assigned to protect Trent unconscious in his squad car. He calls Jim as the crook who committed the home invasion breaks into Trent's house. He quickly finds Trent, who swears he never said anything. The crook puts a gun to his head, but Jim gets there just in the nick of time to take the bullet and dive out of the window with him. Trent is shocked. The next day, Daphne assures him he can still talk to her. Trent is still too shocked to register what happened, but a touch of his arm by Daphne reveals what her father did.

Stephanie finally makes it home and gives Jim a big kiss. He wonders what she did.

STEPHANIE: I saw something tonight...a big chasm. Two sides so...far apart. Families...we start as a unit. Together, united. Over time, life happens, people change, and pretty soon you're so far apart you can't even see the person sitting next to you at dinner. That's what happened with me and my parents. That table might as well have been the Grand Canyon. They don't know who we really are. But that's because we really haven't told them. There are a lot of things I can run from, Jim, but I can't run away from what we are.

She finally agrees it's time to stop running. They agree to tell them, but Allan overheard everything they said. Allan finally figures out Jim and Stephanie must have been volunteering to help others. The shoes were likely for the homeless, and they didn't want to brag about it. It wasn't the truth, but anything to get the parents off their backs. Allan and Barbara apologize for their behavior. And Jim asks for retroactive permission to marry his daughter. He still doesn't give it, but Stephanie was going to do it anyway, and she's happy, so Jim should just keep doing what he's doing. And JJ gets to keep Grandpa's vintage convertible...once he gets his license in two years. Until then, it's Daphne's. Of course, it breaks down on the road, but JJ can fix it if someone can lift the car for him and fetch a torque wrench from home so he can get under the car. Problem solved."

They only have two hours to set up the room (not a problem for Stephanie), hang decorations on the ceiling (not a problem for Jim), and make sure George doesn't know a thing about it. (not going to be a problem, since he already knew) But George will play along right after his court case in an attempt to take down Silvan Luka, a well-connected mobster. Well-connected enough to beat the rap on racketeering and extortion charges. But George is not deterred, even going so far as telling Luka he's coming after his boss, Mr. Kadare. Luka is not worried, but George promises ""to be up in your business so much, I'll show up on your next MRI."" But at least George is not the only one not looking forward to his party. Daphne doesn't want to find out he really isn't surprised, despite the fact George knows she's there and can read his mind. She is nice enough, however, to play along for George so Stephanie doesn't find out. Although Daphne (Kay Panabaker) would rather date the guy in her class with a girlfriend so horrible, she makes the girls on Gossip Girl (2007) look like saints. But it turns out she just had to be patient and wait for the artificial chick to dump him because he likes art museums and a little studying of her father's art books, and she has a date.

George brought Amanda, his co-counsel in the Luka case with him. Although she would have come to the party anyway, given she would really like to go out with George. It takes Stephanie to point this out to him, but George is not sure. Stephanie is also shopping for a tutor for JJ (Jimmy Bennett), who is having trouble with his honors-level graduate school online courses. Stephanie decides to ask Katie (because a 15-year old being tutored by a hot 25-year-old is NEVER awkward), but Katie (Autumn Reeser) does agree. Actually, she was going to suggest it. She is thrilled about tutoring a burgeoning Lex Luthor or Reed Richards. (""OK, work may not be the only reason I'm single."")

Stephanie was right about Amanda, and she tells George she would be interested in seeing him outside of the office. He drives her home, she gets out of the car, and someone shoots her. George is devastated and tells Jim at the hospital he thinks Silvan Luka is coming after him because of the threat he made in court. George was a young attorney who messed up an assault charge case against Luka five years earlier, resulting in the conviction being thrown out. He holds himself responsible for everything Luka has done since then. Jim tells him now they can do something about it, but George vetoes that in a heartbeat; he doesn't want Jim or his family involved.

Stephanie is called into Dr. King's (Stephen Collins) office, who tells her he doesn't want her looking into Dr. Volson's work any more, even though there may be parallels to what she was working on. King tries to cover by saying Volson's work was controversial...'fringe science', as it were...and he went off the deep end after King killed...sorry, fired...him. Stephanie agrees, and Dr. King calls his friend, The Watcher (Josh Stewart), to find the other person he swears is on the loose with special abilities. Stephanie, of course, had no intention of dropping it, and Katie tracked down Volson's widow in Mexico, which was just twenty minutes away...for Stephanie to run to, that is. She packed up her briefcase and some carb drinks.

Jim chooses to ignore George's advice and tracks down Luka, who was shaking down a lackey and was about to kill him. Jim calls the police and creates a distraction to give the lackey a chance to run...if you can call throwing a van a distraction. Luka investigates the thrown van, only to run into a masked Jim, who easily stops the bullets from Luka's gun. He throws Luka into the wall, but Luka manages to get Jim's mask off when they're distracted by the oncoming cops. Jim has to leap away to avoid the police, and Luka sees all of it. As does The Watcher. Jim expected George to be super-mad the next day, but George actually loved it, despite the unexplainable crushed bullets all over the crime scene. George is ecstatic to get another shot at Luka, and Jim conveniently leaving out the 'Luka saw him' aspect didn't hurt, either. But Luka is more than happy to tell George about the man he saw while George barters for taking out Luka's boss. Luka thinks there is a supercop out there on the city's payroll, which is technically correct, and Jim's picture is technically public domain since he's a cop. So Luka's counteroffer is his silence about Jim for his freedom.

Daphne can't believe how boring Modernist art is, so she blackmails JJ into learning it for her. She can hear his thoughts as he studies it, but she decides it'd be easier to pull a Cyrano and have JJ follow from a distance and see the paintings Daphne is at with her date. JJ is quite annoyed being used like this, but Daphne has no issue with it, given the guy made out with her later on. Of course, JJ wouldn't have much of a problem making out with Katie, who determined JJ can retain what he learns for approximately six hours. But Katie makes the mistake of confiding in him she can't get a date, and Daphne basically says he can't invent the perfect guy for Katie. Challenge accepted, and he makes an online profile for Katie she can't resist.

While George reads Jim the riot act about putting his family at risk, Stephanie makes it to Mexico to talk to Mrs. Volson. Apparently, Mrs. Volson was expecting Stephanie, since word of Stephanie's research didn't stay within the walls of GlobalTech. Dr. Volson was let go from the company, but not before he slipped out two vials for his wife and him to try. Mrs. Volson was able to get out of her wheelchair and walk...and so much more. But the effects were only temporary. Dr. Volson was dead soon after. Stephanie believes the powers drove Volson to suicide, which she tells Jim about when he wants to convince George not to accept Luka's blackmail attempt. But Stephanie is afraid their new powers might eventually kill them.

Daphne is on top of the world until she sees Brett, her artistic boyfriend, back with the artifical chick. He apologizes to her the next day, and she tries to blow it off as just a day at the museum, even though Brett was thinking he may have made a mistake by going back to his old girlfriend. Katie is in heaven IMing with her profile match. So much so, Stephanie catches her IMing and insists Katie invite Will P. Gerome to dinner. Just a tiny bit awkward for JJ, and it gets even more awkward when Stephanie starts talking for the nervous Katie on the IM. Yes, Stephanie just asked her son out on a date. Very Greg and Carol Brady, isn't it? But JJ is too chicken to chicken out. Daphne can't believe he did it. (""How can a super-genius be so epically stupid?"") He has no choice but to blow off the date, which won't make Katie happy.

George figures out Luka can't actually prove the city has a 'supercop' unless he can get Jim to show his powers, so George offers him the original deal, which his attorney takes for him. However, someone kills Luka on his way to the county lockup. Was it Kadare? Nope, The Watcher gave Luka the Darth Vader treatment. Jim finds out and puts two and two together regarding Luka and Detective Cho: the people who have seen him in action. Both were dead.

This, however, was nothing compared to the bear trap Stephanie just walked in. Mrs. Volson lied a blue streak to her, at Dr. King's request. Mrs. Volson was never in a wheelchair, or at least the powers she had weren't simply temporary. Stephanie thanks Dr. King for warning her away from Volson, but obviously Dr. King is concerned Stephanie knows too much. The Watcher sees their entire meeting and is given a picture of Stephanie's family. He figures all of it out, but he keeps that from Dr. King. He does have a way to keep an eye on the family. After all, Katie was still looking for the blind date JJ set up for her. The Watcher decided she should keep it."

George (Romany Malco) gets a call on the Batphone (police scanner) about professional carjackers who like to put their victims in the hospital as much as they like boosting cars. His date with Amanda is interrupted, and he in turn interrupts Stephanie's (Julie Benz) romantic night with Jim (Michael Chiklis). Jim is skeptical, but the call went out. Jim would rather stay at home, and who could blame him.

GEORGE: What's it gonna be man: the nooky or the crooky?

And before Jim can suffer any performance anxiety in the bedroom, he heads out after the bad guys...and still has some performance anxiety. His idea of using a dumpster as a roadblock doesn't work when he can't lift the dumpster. Stephanie is concerned the next day and takes a saliva sample from Jim for analysis, since she can't stick a needle into The Thing's arm. Katie thinks Jim has some sort of virus short-circuiting his powers, which she explains between her gushing over Will (Josh Stewart), her date from the other night. Or as we know him, The Watcher. Daphne (Kay Panabaker) doesn't have any performance anxiety getting a guy named Bret to study for an Art History project with her. She simply had to agree with his answer to ""if you could only have one type of food the rest of your life, what would it be"" question, which was sushi. It was almost as if she could read his mind. And JJ (Jimmy Bennett) is trying to help Kenny pass Algebra and get a football scholarship, only Mr. Litchfield gives Kenny an 'F,' accusing him of cheating off of JJ's paper. And ticking everybody off by referencing John Hughes movies while acting like a total jerk. JJ was trying to help Kenny, so he decides to pretend this is WarGames (1983) and hack into the school's computer to change Kenny's grade. Litchfield catches him and gives him the full Mr. Vernon.

Stephanie theorizes that perhaps some sort of allergen, instead of a virus, is prompting Jim's immune system to fight his altered DNA. She ran home to find items Jim might be allergic to, which gave Katie (Autumn Reeser) about thirty seconds to agree to a dinner date with Will. She's happy to go on it, but of course he's under orders from Dr. King (Stephen Collins) to find out anything Stephanie or anyone close to her knows about her research on Dr. Volson's work.

Daphne tried to get JJ to help her on her date, but he refused. However, when she told the chef she wanted something adventurous to impress Bret, the chef thought up everything she needed and she just had to say it back to him. They got odori, which are dancing prawns. And that they were.

Jim heads home after George accidentally slammed a door on his hand...and it hurts. Jim is freaking out, so much so he slams the damaged hand into the table, and his powers are back. Which was good, because the school called about JJ, and JJ wanted to know why breaking the law to help Kenny was any different than his father busting a perp's head in with his superpowers. Jim goes to talk to Mr. Litchfield, and now he understands why JJ thinks the guy is a jerk. (Sorry, but this S.O.B. wouldn't last five minutes in any school district with his attitude if he didn't have tenure.) It was semi-poetic justice when Litchfield got broadsided by one of the carjackers who just took a car several minutes before. The trouble was, Jim's powers happened to fail him right then. Even worse, a piece of pipe penetrated and cut Litchfield's aorta. (OK, I wouldn't wish that on the jerk.) Surgery is too dangerous to remove it. JJ felt it was his fault because his dad was meeting with Litchfield and made him late enough to get hit, and Jim tells Stephanie it was his fault because he didn't catch the carjackers the other night when he had issues with his powers. But perhaps Stephanie and JJ could tag-team on the solution. He read up everything he could on the heart, and he asked Stephanie if she could use her speed to fix Litchfield's heart. He was still feeling guilt and decided he wanted to do something very worthwhile with his powers. JJ showed her that she could suture the aorta fast enough to stop the blood from hemmorhaging and killing Litchfield. Jim refuses for both of them, but JJ won't be dissuaded. He takes off for the hospital. Since Litchfield will die without the surgery anyway, JJ feels guilty enough to try it himself. Stephanie finally caves in and agrees to do it, even though she hadn't been in an E.R. since medical school. And Jim will help by running interference for them, since obviously this surgery is unauthorized.

The Watcher has his date with Katie and pumps her for information (not THAT way!) about Stephanie, but Katie is happy enough to say she loves being the Pepper Potts to Stephanie's Tony Stark. (""Minus all the awkward sexual tension, of course."") The Watcher had a similar story about having a rough childhood until someone took him under his wing as well. He dolled up the story for Katie, obviously. The Watcher thanks her for the date, and they kiss. It gives Katie an idea about her research...and she liked it, too. Katie tells Stephanie to get down to the lab quickly, which she does, of course. Katie wants to know when she kissed Jim most recently. It was the cinoxate in Stephanie's lip gloss that was to blame. It killed the trisettum plant. Put simply, Katie found Jim's kryptonite.

Indeed JJ did do his homework. He administered the proper amount of sedative to Litchfield and knew Stephanie had 3 milliseconds to suture the aorta. Stephanie appreciated the bonding time she was having with JJ, although she would have definitely preferred bonding over mini-golf instead. Jim laments the carjackers still on the loose. Stephanie repairs the aorta, but Litchfield goes into cardiac arrest. She thinks the pipe may have severed another artery, but she couldnt' find it. JJ guides her along the path of the left inferior pulmonary vein, and she finds the tear. Jim has a problem outside, as the doctor who will perform a triple-bypass in the same room wants to inspect it. He gets past Jim, only to see Litchfield recovering.

Daphne runs into Bret the next day and was feeling guilt for what JJ was going through. She comes clean with Bret and tells him she doesn't know how to compete with Christy. Bret is upset because he wanted to be with Daphne, and Daphne hopes he'll still be around when she gets her new life figured out.

George lets Jim know about a chop shop the carjackers might have been using, but the police didn't trust the tip from their informant. Jim decides to go over there, even without powers and over Stephanie's protests.

JIM: Seeing you and JJ save a life yesterday, I felt something I hadn't in a long time: useless. With or without powers, I HAVE to help.

Unortunately, Jim got caught at the repair shop. He tried to pretend he was just some guy with a family, but the carjacker who found him shot him anyway. Stephanie is panicking when Jim doesn't answer the phone. BUt a funny thing happens: the effects of the cinoxate are only temporary. The trisellum plant comes back to life, as does Jim's powers. And the bad guys are easily dispatched.

JJ visits Mr. Litchfield. Litchfield was told some specialist attempted the surgery without telling anybody so no liability would fall against the hospital if things went wrong. Litchfield would prefer not discussing what he was doing with JJ before the accident, and JJ takes the win and runs.

Will/The Watcher visits Katie at work and gives her some flowers. And he gets to meet Stephanie, too.

THE WATCHER: I look forward to getting to know you better.

Dr. King meets with him later and is pleased The Watcher found a way to get access to Stephanie. He gives him an injection as a reward. Perhaps it is what keeps his powers going, but there is no way to know for certain."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1757357/?ref_=ttep_ep9,,"With the parents away celebrating their anniversary, JJ hosts a poker game to acquire some desired cash the superpower way, but no one's evening goes as planned.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['David Semel'],"['', '', '']",[],"['child in jeopardy', 'poker', 'home alone', 'serial arsonist', 'wedding anniversary', 'human torch', 'super villain', 'security guard', 'bribe', 'playing cards', 'poker chip', 'gambling', 'taunting', 'bullying', 'hospital', 'ambulance', 'disgruntled employee', 'burning vehicle', 'building on fire', 'fire', 'marble', 'sculpture', 'pyromaniac', 'bouquet']",[],"Jim (Michael Chiklis) and Stephanie (Julie Benz) have been married for 18 years, which means their marriage is old enough to vote and have sex, according to George (Romany Malco). That aside, Jim wants to keep the anniversary to remain criminal-free. But one fire engine siren later, and he's leaping to a huge fire with someone stuck inside. One leap later (and disocovering Jim's flame-proof as well as bullet-proof), he pulls a kid out but spots someone unusual among the onlookers.

As for the anniversary, Daphne (Kay Panabaker) would rather not have the 86-year-old Mrs. Cornbluth as a babysitter, so she insists on not needing one. In true-blue TV fashion, Stephanie is against, and Jim is too distracted to agree. He tells Stephanie about rescuing the kid from the burning building, and Katie (Autumn Reeser) is excited he is flame-retardant, just like the safe that holds her autographed picture of President Roslin from the Twelve Colonies. (Seriously, she's WAY too hot to be collecting that.) But JJ (Jimmy Bennett) sees this as an opportunity, as a couple of bullies from school need a place to play poker, and he volunteers his house. For once, Daphne is being the smarter one, warning JJ to not let them hang around, since she doesn't want to risk losing her car. Not to mention, JJ thinks poker is all about the probabilities.

Jim's present to Stephanie is a marble silhouette of two hands holding each other. Much easier to do now that he can shape marble any way he wishes. They're off to their anniversary night out, the kids couldn't care less, and George is upset that the same creepy guy Jim saw at the fire had been at two other ones but Jim doesn't care. Perhaps he should, as the guy setting the fires is doing it with his own superpowers.

Francis, the annoying scientist assigned to Stephanie's team, gets called into Dr. King's office. King (Stephen Collins) wants him to keep spying on Stephanie, and he thinks it's a waste of his time and talent. Dr. King shows him the door.

Stephanie asks Katie to interrupt her date with Will/The Watcher (Josh Stewart) to check on the kids, since she thinks this is the 1960's. But to her credit, she did get around the snooty hostess at the restaurant and moved their names up the list without anybody knowing. Except the name she bumped was someone who was proposing to his girlfriend. But they figured they could still have a romantic evening...until they come to the site of another fire and Jim sees the same creepy arsonist. Jim catches up to him, and it's on. The arsonist gets the drop on Jim by going max flame on him, but Stephanie finds them and takes the guy out with a pipe.

STEPHANIE: Happy Anniversary.

Jim's concerned, but suddenly Stephanie gets the whole ""hero"" thing Jim was trying to be. But then Jim tells her about the downsides of the job, such as avoiding the police and explaining what to do about the super-villians they come across.

JJ cleans up at the outset of his poker game, mainly because they were playing seven-card stud. They switch to five-card draw, and JJ gets cleaned out. And in an interesting twist, now JJ asks Daphne for help with the game. She is hesitant, until she reads the mind of one of the guys, who is as sleazy on the inside as he is on the outside. She's all-in, if you'll pardon the horrible play on words. They work out a signaling system, and he's back in the money. Except Katie shows up with Will. She'll take Daphne and JJ's word that they're fine, but Will wants to take a closer look. (Shocking!) Turns out it was the right call, as Katie was upset by the poker playing, and Will uses his Professor Xavier mental influence to get the guys to leave. While Katie berates Daphne and JJ about having company over without permission, Will looks through the house and finds a few clues, such as Stephanie's journal.

Jim brings Stephanie to George's lair, over his strenuous protests. But Jim wants this guy stopped before he charbroils whatever hospital the cops brought him to. George suggests going the legal route, as this man is only a suspected arsonist thus far, but Stephanie adds they can sedate him and keep him in the lab long enough for her to study the man's DNA to see if it's the same circumstances that changed theirs. First George has to get him out of being put in a lineup by Cordero, who has witnesses who can place the man at three of the fires at the minimum. George calls Jim to go with the original plan to get the man out of the hospital. By some incredible coincidence, the man uses his one phone call to get Dr. King to do the same thing. Dr. King has the perfect person to spring Theo Patton: Will/The Watcher.

As Jim, Stephanie, and George map out a plan to take Patton, Katie strikes a deal with Daphne: Katie won't rat if Daphne mind-reads Will and determines if he is just blowing Katie off. Sounds like a plan, except Will's mind is completely unreadable. She lies to Katie, but Daphne is creeped out. The fact that someone broke Mom's anniversary marble statue make things worse. To fix it, they need to break into the high school to steal the necessary tools and supplies. And breaking into your own school NEVER goes badly, right? Fortunately, they had JJ's poker winnings to bribe the security guard.

Jim and Stephanie head for the police van, but Will got there first. While Jim helps the injured cops, Stephanie follows a fire trail to Patton. He throws a fireball at her, but she goes Neo on him and dodges it. He tries to turn himself into a fireball but the results are the same. After giving chase through a warehouse, Patton is finally successful at knocking her down. He goes in for the kill, but Jim grabs him from behind and tosses him away. He tries to get up, but a grain silo he was under gets broken open, and Patton is buried. They decide they've had enough for one anniversary and head home. Stephanie decides to leave the crimefighting to Jim.

Last week the question was raised if Dr. King was giving Will/The Watcher injections to keep his powers going. The fact that Dr. King denies Will that same injection this week for not saving Patton would seem to confirm that. And someone decides to analyze the serum spilled in the grass after they leave: Francis."

Daphne (Kay Panabaker) can't do any of that, but she is suspicious of Will (Josh Stewart), Katie's (Autumn Reeser) new boyfriend. He continues to block her from reading his mind, and he might be onto Daphne's secret. Unfortunately, Will isn't moving fast enough for Dr. King's (Stephen Collins) liking, who tells him to get all of the information he wants, and fast. However, Dr. King has to also deal with Dr. Francis Chiles, the scientist he fired, discovering the serum from the plant and what it could possibly do. Francis threatens to go to the government, but King calls his bluff, saying Francis was part of the team and would be just as guilty.

Jim is not having fun at the police station. Cordero is still treating him like crap, mainly because he doesn't realize Jim pulled him out of that van. And now George is getting the credit for busting up the dry cleaner heist he told Jim to take care of. (By hiding a police scanner in his bowling bag.) But George reminds Jim he's helping him to keep his secret identity a secret. It gets a bit hard when Jim goes back to the woman at the dry cleaners, who wants to know if George is single rather than talk about the four...not three...men who robbed the place of cash and even took someone's dry cleaning. Jim goes to ask George to follow up on the person who got the dry cleaning stolen, but he has to wait in line behind the people who want to interview George and the other ladies wondering if he was single. It got even harder, as another detective handed Cordero a copy of a traffic cam's footage of his accident

JJ is annoyed by the fact his new powers give him little in common with his friends anymore, so he goes to an intellectual think-tank cafe, where he tries his best at playing chess, only to find his powers short-circuiting. Maybe it was the lip gloss, like it was for Jim. More likely, it was his very hot opponent. Which means girls are apparently JJ's kryptonite...or at least his out-of-control hormones are.

Katie and Stephanie talk at GlobalTech, where apparently Will is the greatest guy Katie's known since she met the metrosexual Wookiee at Comic Con '06. Stephanie calls TMI, and both are shocked to see what looked like a bruise on Dr. King's face. He explained his run-in with Dr. Francis Chiles in the parking lot of GlobalTech. He warns them to notify security if they see him. Stephanie doesn't get the chance, as Francis accosts her in the parking lot. He denies hitting Dr. King, but he does give Stephanie the vial of serum and asks her to test it.

FRANCIS: Open your eyes, Dr. Powell. Everything is not as it seems. This evidence will cause you to question everything you know. You might try to convince yourself this is not happening, but it won't matter. Because the facts will speak for themselves.

Daphne asks Katie where she met Will. Of course, the fact Katie knows Daphne can read her mind doesn't stop her from not saying anything. But Daphne gets the Rate-A-Date.com site from her. The same site JJ used to set up her fake date. Now both of them are very suspicious. Daphne can't figure out how Will knew about JJ's fake profile, but she has to tell Stephanie, since she can't read Will's mind, which is a problem in and of itself.

Cordero calls Jim into his office, as he figured out from the video footage it was Jim who saved his life. Suddenly Cordero is super-nice to him. He appreciates the fact that Jim wasn't being a glory hound like George was. Of course, Jim is more worried about Cordero knowing, but at least Cordero gave him the rest of the day off to pursue the man who had his dry cleaning stolen. Without George as a GPS system, Jim has to do it the way the rest of us normal people do: with his cell phone. 62 meters (""that's like yards, right?"") later, Jim lands (splashes, actually) at his destination. Jim pretended to be an insurance agent following up on Mr. Parillo's theft claim, but Parillo didn't know what anybody would want with old train conductor uniforms.

Daphne goes to tell Stephanie about Will slipping into JJ's online profile, and Jim talks to George about the uniforms. Stephanie confronts Katie about Will, but she thinks Stephanie is making stuff up and is trying to undermine her dating life. George isn't much better about entertaining any theories from Jim about there being a bigger heist in the works. George doesn't want to follow up, since he has to go receive a civic award.

JIM: So, instead of stopping one crime, you want to go get an award for not stopping another one?

Both George and Katie were tired of being sidekicks to Jim and Stephanie.

JJ returns to the cafe and offers to help the hot girl he played in chess with her homework, only his powers short-circuit again. This time, he asks Jim about it, since the blood seems to be rushing from his brain to his...""GOT IT!"" Jim's advice is to tell him to think of something else, like baseball stats. It works like a charm on his return match. And JJ has a rather hot chess partner for a girlfriend.

Jim and Stephanie talk about what happened with George and Katie. Jim figures Batman may not have held on to Robin forever, so he goes in search of someone else's help. Since Cordero still had his lips firmly attached to his rear, he asked Cordero about trains that may have been robbed in Pacific Bay. Cordero tells him about the money train that the Transit Authority uses to transfer the city's cash to the Federal depository. Cordero described the robbers using uniforms and Authority duffel bags to hide their weapons. Meanwhile, Stephanie experiments with the serum Dr. Chiles gave her. The hamster she injected starts going crazy on the wheel, and she calls Dr. Chiles, who tells her to meet him and not tell anybody.

Katie talks to Will about what Stephanie told her. Will covers for himself by saying he saw her at the bar the night she tried to meet her cyber-date, and he wished Katie would look at him the way she kept looking up at the potential suitors that came in. He pretended to be Will. He confessed his real name was Joshua. Which was an amazing coincidence, as a waiter at the restaurant they were at was also named Joshua. Katie forgives him, but he has to run off to do a job for Dr. King. That job is to kill Dr. Chiles.

George sees Jim's disastrous encounter at the train station with the apprehending wrong people. He goes to Jim and confesses he could have helped Jim get the right train station and day. The partnership is restored, since George doesn't need a key to the city. (""What would I do with a key that don't open nothin?"") Jim makes it to the train, which is bearing down on him at 50 MPH. He gets hit by the train but manages to pull a Spider-Man 2 (2004) on the locomotive and stops the crooks inside. Jim thanks George for helping him and gives him a lift back to the ceremony.

Will/Joshua/The Watcher pays a visit to the Powell house, where he makes his way into the house. Stephanie is still at Dr. Chile's house, where she found him dead, made to look like a suicide. Dr. King tries to spin a story about Chiles attempting to continue Volson's research but on human test subjects, but he encourages Stephanie to continue the work under his close supervision. Will/The Watcher gives Daphne the same story he gave Katie about her cyber date. Daphne takes him at face value. He goes to leave and shakes her hand. Sure enough, contacting him opens up his mind to her, and she sees him forcing pharmaceutical drugs down Dr. Chiles throat, causing his ""suicide."" Daphne plays it as cool as she can in order to get him to leave. He is seemingly satisfied and leaves the residence. Daphne darts to the phone to contact Stephanie about what she saw when Will/The Watcher enters the house again and throws the phone from Daphne's hand using his telekinetic powers. Daphne tries to escape but Will moves some furniture into her path. He eventually corners her against a wall.

WILL: There are others out there. But your family seem to be the only ones whose powers are permanent. And I'm just trying to figure out why. So I can be like you.

Will thinks her mother knows about all of it. Daphne, in tears, swears she won't say anything.

WILL: I know you won't.

Jim and Stephanie make it home, and King's story about Dr. Chiles stuck with her. Stephanie thinks the supervillians they encountered were all part of Chiles' experiments. It made sense, until Daphne came downstairs with zero knowledge of what happened to them over the last three months. Her memories had been erased by Will."

And even having Jim (Michael Chiklis) demonstrate his powers by lifting a couch, Stephanie (Julie Benz) getting her water in half a second, or JJ (Jimmy Bennett) acting smart didn't help. However, Jim thought having everybody hold hands might help so Daphne can read their minds. It turns out she still had her powers; Will only managed to block her memories. A little practice, and she was good as new. Practice being what Katie (Autumn Reeser) needs before her next date with Will (Josh Stewart), as she was still a virgin (yeah, I call BS on that one, too).

George (Romany Malco) is updating Jim on the latest from crime-land; an $8,000,000 painting was stolen when Jim had a more immediate need for his powers. He acted as a speed bump for a guy who didn't see a city bus as he was crossing the streets. The man, Dave, insisted Jim tell him who he was in order to thank him. And Dave does...by bringing his family to the Powell's house. Awkward doesn't begin to describe it, especially since Jim didn't tell his family what he did. They accept Dave and Michelle's invitation to a barbeque the next night, over Jim's protests. However, Stephanie wanted a normal night with some friends, something the family hadn't done in some time.

Jim heads out to another gallery heist. He finds the man, only to have the crook throw firecrackers in his face. The painting was saved, but the man got away. Jim was certain it was a pro at work (like James Bond, but a bad guy), however he has to go to the barbeque with his family. Stephanie is actually just as worried about making an impression as she is her missing journal which catalogued their powers. But she is doing well with the small talk with Michelle, who has moved from city to city with Dave. And Jim will get along fine with Dave as soon as he stops picking up 100 lb bags of charcoal with one hand and is able to talk about being in a hair band unironically. But Jim does offer to have Daphne show Chloe and Troy around the school the next day. Offer as in have Daphne mind read what he wanted. As it turns out, Chloe stood up to the class president (BTW, the real Bailey Browning is WAY nicer than that.) and got her thinking of running for class president. JJ's tour with Troy didn't go as well, as Troy basically insulted JJ's friend/girlfriend. Stephanie and Michelle agree to meet for another drink, even though Jim worries about having to continue keeping secrets from them. But Michelle has a whopper of her own: Dave is the art thief.

Katie's date went as awkwardly as a date would go if you were about to lose your virginity to someone. She confesses to Will she's a virgin, complete with the obligatory ""boldly going where no man has gone before"" line. Will backs away, and Katie is left to think she freaked him out. But he walks for much different reasons. Will is so affected by Katie, he tells Dr. King (Stephen Collins) he is quitting. King warns him he won't be able to be the same person without his powers, but Will is going to take that chance.

George talks to Jim about crime (as usual) and tells him art museums were hit in Boston and Seattle as well. The places Dave used to live. Jim thinks it's just coincidence, but George thinks Jim wants to think of Dave as normal. (""You guys are a bowl and some Bee Gees away from a key party."") George recommends watching both Dave and the museum, since he figures the painting was pre-sold and has to be stolen one way or another.

Troy, as it turns out, is a player and tries to move in on JJ's friend/girlfriend, Natalie. JJ asks him nicely to back off, but Troy challenges him to man up. And thanks to the physics of the exact place to hit someone, JJ takes him down with one punch. His friend/girlfriend is very impressed, but JJ isn't happy. But it turns out Troy acting like a douchebag on purpose to make JJ defend her honor. And it worked, as Natalie removed the 'friend' tag on her relationship with JJ and was now his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Daphne tries to get out the vote with Chloe's encouragement, but the thoughts of the students were on anything but the election. She was not encouraged. (Sadly, it only gets worse as you get older, Daphne.) But she used that to her advantage in her speech to the student body. She knew what was on their minds, literally. And they liked it.

Stephanie and Michelle get wasted, and Stephanie learns the hard way to not play true confessions with someone. Fortunately, Jim interrupts before Stephanie can give away that she can zoop. To make matters worse, he has to listen to George noshing on a sub sandwich while he's starving and watching the museum. But Dave does strike at the museum. Jim accidentally trips a laser beam to set off the alarms. Dave slips past before the security doors come down, but not before he realizes Jim was the one after him. Jim breaks the bars to escape. Jim goes to talk to Dave, promising Stephanie he'd use a light touch. Which means accusing him of the crime. Dave is ticked, and Jim laments to George about losing a friend. Of course, George reminds him Peter Parker ticked off his friends at every turn. (""With great power comes great...loneliness?"") George finally relents and tells Jim to just apologize. Jim pays a visit to Dave, doesn't find him, but finds the evidence of Dave's theft in his garage...only to be caught by Michelle. But Dave wasn't the thief: Michelle was.

Jim calls Stephanie, who agrees to confront Michelle about it. She originally stole art to support the family after Dave lost his job, but she got caught up in it. Michelle begs Stephanie to let them go away, but Stephanie offers to take them to the D.A. to get a reduced sentence. Michelle offers to turn herself in after she tells Dave and the kids what she has done. George is out of his mind for Jim letting Stephanie handle this. And George was right, since Michelle ditched Stephanie to meet with her fence for the stolen art. Stephanie catches up, and the fence pulls out a gun. Michelle jumps in front of the bullet for Stephanie. Stephanie visits her in the hospital to thank her for saving her life, but Michelle said she didn't have any intention of stopping until she did that. Dave blamed himself for what his wife did, but Jim tried to comfort him.

JIM: That's the thing about secrets. You don't know what they are.

George was able to ID the shooter from the license plate, but Stephanie was still upset that Dave and Michelle's family was going to be broken up. However, that would have happened had he not saved Dave that day.

Will goes to Katie and tells her he ""chooses"" her, which she found a bit confusing, but obviously the audience knows what he meant. They have their magical night, and Katie is in love...until Stephanie's journal drops out of Will's coat."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1770134/?ref_=ttep_ep12,,"A trio of big brother stories unfold as Jim looks out for his visiting little brother Mike, Daphne seeks the truth behind a blame-taking student outcast, and Global Tech abruptly promotes Katie.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Michael W.

As he was uninvited, Jim went to investigate, only to find his brother in the house. Of course, since this is a TV show, Jim's brother is...not exactly the most reliable person on the planet, which Stephanie knows and Jim denies. But Uncle Mike (Jason Wiles) assures everybody he has himself straightened out, giving up the (failed) energy drink business to sell shoes that didn't make manufacturer's standards. And it turns out he may be in trouble with some people, if the beating he got outside the bar was any indication. Jim intervenes, and the bad guys knock Jim off the parking garage roof with their SUV. But Jim survives, and Mike demands an explanation. And kept demanding it until Jim admitting having superpowers. Mike didn't believe him, until Jim demonstrated it. (""Hit me with the shovel."") And Stephanie probably picked at bad time to speed in and talk about Katie (Autumn Reeser). And with Daphne (Kay Panabaker) coming in at the wrong time to ask if Mike knew about everybody's powers, and the cat's out of the bag.

Katie pressed Will (Josh Stewart) to tell her about being in possession of Stephanie's diary. Only, she wasn't. He took at look at the pages, and none of it was in Stephanie's chicken-scratchings, as Katie called them. It was almost as if Will re-wrote the entire diary. She apologizes for being paranoid and is rewarded with a promotion at work. She is to run her own lab in Miami. Stephanie is suspicious, even though Katie reminds her it only takes Stephanie 7 minutes to get to her workplace (if she ran the whole way), so they could still have lunch every day. Stephanie asks both Dr. King (Stephen Collins) and Victoria Morrow (Rebecca Mader), the new VP of personnel about it, but Victoria convinces Katie on the sly that Stephanie is harboring a bit of jealousy towards her because she won't be Stephanie's audience anymore. Sure enough, Katie confronts Stephanie about it and the two are not on good terms.

Jim shows Mike the lair, over Stephanie's and George's protests. (""Who are you bringing in here next? TMZ?"") Jim continues the denial front, but George ran the plates on the SUV that tried to run him over. The SUV belonged to a big-time loan shark. Now Jim is convinced, but Mike pulls the same ""I gotta take this call"" routine that got him out of paying their bar tab earlier to track down JJ (Jimmy Bennett) at the high school. Sure enough, Mike takes JJ down to the track. JJ's analysis of the racing form was quite profitable. The school calls Jim and Stephanie, and Jim finally breaks down and calls Mike to read him the riot act. ""The Call to the Post"" being played in the background by the track certainly didn't help Mike's cause. Mike tries to come up with a bullcrap story about his business, but Daphne just happened to walk into the room. Finally, Mike admits to owing $15,000 in gambling debts. Mike begs Jim to help. Jim goes to talk to Frank Matthews, the man Mike owes. Only Mike owes 10 times as much as he told Jim. Jim goes back to George, who suggests going to the lair and running through some ideas on the computers. Only the lair is gone. Three guesses as to who did that.

One of Daphne's duties at school as the new student body president is to be on the peer discipline committee. Sure enough, students can't weasel their way from her mind reading, and she hands out the punishment. That is, until one student was caught with prescription drugs, but she mind-reads he was covering for a scholarship student...his younger brother. Since Chris didn't hae a great record anyway, getting busted for the pills didn't make a difference. Daphne asks JJ to crack the combination on the kid's locker, and they find the drugs. Daphne reports him, and Chris is quite upset. But Daphne insists sending Chris' brother to get help for his addiction was more important than any scholarship.

Dr. King and Victoria try to figure out their next move, as Will, who was partly the reason why Katie received the transfer, refused to go back to work for Dr. King, despite the pain and depression the serum kept from him. Dr. King orders her to do whatever it took to keep Will in Pacific Bay. Perhaps getting rid of Katie was the way to do it, because she almost had several large panes of windows dropped on her from a crane. Fortunately, Stephanie was apologizing to her at the time and found a rather heroic way to make up for it by pulling Katie out of the way. Katie tells Will she thought it was an accident, but Will wasted no time going to King and telling him he knew what really happened. King writes him off without ""the serum coarsing through your bloodstream,"" but Will assured him he'd go after King the old-fashioned way if he had to. Stephanie's heroic act was enough to convince Katie to stay.

Daphne runs to see Jim because she hugged Mike goodbye, only to read his mind and discover he was watching an ultrasound being done on his wife at the time Jim and George's lair was being robbed. Jim calls to apologize, except Mike was captured by Frank Matthews, who demanded the $150K from Jim in 24 hours. George wants Jim and Stephanie to go superhero on Matthews, but JJ suggests raising the money at the track. Jim doesn't want to do it, but Stephanie thought it was the best way to save a member of the family. It works until a 12-to-1 longshot gets injured on the turn for home. Jim walks into the hostage situation without the money and offers to take Mike's place. Matthews puts the gun to Jim's head, but Mike takes out one of Matthew's thugs. The distraction gives Jim the chance to knock out Matthews. It turned out there was a reward for Matthews' capture, and Jim told Mike to give the reward money to his new son/daughter. Jim wouldn't need the money to rebuild his lair, because George's homeowners' insurance policy paid for a new lair Batman would be jealous of.

Stephanie's heroic act was enough to convince Katie to stay. But the incident was no accident, as the crane operator dropped the glass on purpose. Failing to accomplish this was very disappointing to Dr. King, The operator was Victoria, who could shape shift into other people (think Mystique from X-Men). But Dr. King had another plan."

Jim's (Michael Chiklis) heroics, including taking down an escaped convict at a local college with a sweet clothesline, has gotten the attention of the Internal Affairs Bureau. However, since Jim was only a sketch artist, IAB calls George (Romany Malco) on the carpet instead, who continuously denies there's a vigilante cop on the force. Daphne (Kay Panabaker), JJ (Jimmy Bennett), JJ's girlfriend Natalie, and Chris, the guy Daphne got in trouble previously, all ended up in detention. Katie (Autumn Reeser) was worried about Josh/Will (Josh Stewart), who was starting to suffer the effects of not receiving the serum from Dr. King. Katie asks Stephanie (Julie Benz) to have a look at Josh, only Katie pulls the ""I forgot my purse"" routine to get him to GlobalTech. The exam is short-lived, as a lockdown takes place for a ""radiation leak,"" which was initiated, shockingly, by Victoria/Mystique. Still, it was better than Jim's situation, where the perp he caught organized a takeover of the police department, with George and Jim in it.

George and Jim plan strategy from inside the bathroom. Jim spots the air vents, and they decide to go Die Hard (Die Hard (1988)). Jim wants to go it alone to pick off the crooks one-by-one, but George reminds him John McClane wouldn't have succeeded without 'that black dude helping him'. (""Jim, let me be your black dude."") Stephanie, on the other hand, happily hands over her high-security access card to Katie at Victoria's request to get into the specimen room under the guise of getting everybody out. Will protests (he seems to know something about Victoria), but Katie utters the four words you should never say in a horror movie: I'll be right back.

Everybody was TOTALLY surprised to see Mr. Litchfield, JJ's math teacher and all-around jerk, running detention. And now we have . Chris, playing the role of John Bender, encourages everybody to bolt once Litchfield leaves the room, but Natalie doesn't want to do it. However, she does find the time to break up with JJ. But it becomes much easier for Chris to convince JJ to bolt from detention. However, this left Natalie, Daphne, and Bailey, the tramp who Daphne beat as school president and who hates Natalie to antagonize both of them. (I'm starting to wonder if LittleChuckFan is ready to have a little talk with Ali Adler about the way her namesake behaves on the show.)

Technically, Al Powell never actually spoke to any of the bad guys, other than identifying himself to Hans Gruber, but George glosses over those little details by telling the crooks they won't get a plane because hostage tactics have changed since 9/11. He advises the crooks to get everybody food and not harm them in any way. Amazingly, they comply. The leader sends one of them, and George tells him (and Jim) where to go. (""Yippee-kai-yay."") One criminal down, three to go. He lures a second one out by pretending to be the first guy over the radio. And then there were two.

Josh/Will tries to get out of the lab and unlock the door with his mind, but without Dr. King's serum, he fails. Katie finds him and tries to reassure him he'll be OK. Except it's actually Victoria, who taunts him with a syringe full of the serum. He refuses, so she chooses to wait twenty minutes when his organs shut down. Victoria (as Katie) tries to go in and convince Stephanie to inject Will/Josh with the plant serum, but he warns Stephanie to ""not trust Katie"" before passing out. Stephanie goes very quickly (her definition of very quickly) to get ice packs to reduce his temperature, but Victoria/Katie staring at her.

As Davies, the man Jim clotheslined before taking over the police station, starts to get desperate, IAB Officer Jacobs decides to play the role of Ellis and be a weasel, telling Davies the person taking out his men might be a rogue cop. Sure enough, now Davies knows it's Jim. And Davies knows about Die Hard, too. He plays Hans Gruber and shoots a hostage while giving Jim a five-count to show himself. Jim runs out to find Jacobs shot, and Davies commends him for sacrificing himself for the lady who ratted on him.

Chris and JJ barely make it back to detention before Litchfield caught them, and Bailey started antagonizing them, only Chris had a few potshots to retaliate with on her. Bailey ropes everybody into a game of Truth or Dare. Daphne asks Chris if he's been arrested, and he denies it. Daphne chooses Dare, and Bailey tells her to kiss Chris. She does, and she finds out Chris' arrest (she knew he was lying before kissing him) resulted in someone being taken to the hospital. Chris next wants the truth from Natalie: why did she break up with JJ? She tries to blow it off, but JJ wants to know. It turns out Natalie has been bouncing around foster homes all her life, never having met her father and losing her mother when she was four. She couldn't afford anything in life but good grades and a scholarship. JJ gets a truth question, and Bailey wants him to tell everybody something nobody knows about him. JJ decides to demonstrate his super-smarts...by creating a little artificial snow to convince Natalie anything was possible, like seeing snow in Visalia one time. Detention ends, but Daphne insists Chris tell her why he got arrested. His dad was drunk and Chris took his car keys. Only Chris didn't know how to drive yet and hit a tree. His father was still paralyzed. Chris asks Daphne what her secret was. And Daphne admits she likes him. And they kiss. JJ tried to help Natalie, but she was too used to taking care of herself. She thanked him for caring.

Katie returns to the room, right at the same time Katie returns to the room. Victoria's secret is out. (I can't believe I just said that.) And now Stephanie has to go to the quiz. Both knew their favorite X-Man (Kitty Pryde), the president of Battlestar Galactica (Laura Roslin), but only the real Katie knew she was a virgin until last week. Of course, Stephanie is then dumb enough to turn her back on Victoria/Katie, who takes her out with a garbage can. Then Victoria decides she hasn't seen enough Bond films, because she tells Katie everything about Will/Josh while trying to inject her with some deadly poison. But outside, Josh takes the serum and takes out Victoria. Katie is even more scared now. Stephanie comes around and Katie explains Will/Josh saved her life. But in the confusion, Victoria slips out. Josh confesses everything to Katie, apart from the link to Dr. King. He asks if it's still possible to be with her, and she agrees.

Davies and his remaining partner hear from the negotiators the plane they requested was there, and Davies takes both Jim and IAB Officer Jacobs with them. Jacobs still berates Jim for everything he did, and Davies decides to shoot him out of annoyance. He drags Jacobs to the car. Of course, the bullet bounces off Jim, and Jim takes both of them out. But Jacobs sees everything. Fortunately, Jim wore a Kevlar vest to cover for himself, and Jacobs decides against prosecuting him.

The family finally gathers for dinner for the first time in a long time. Jim asks if everybody wants to share their day. They're hesitant, but he shares his Die Hard moment with them."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1782894/?ref_=ttep_ep14,,"Jim and Stephanie vie over which of them has the better power for crime-fight. Meanwhile, JJ and Daphne go out on dates that each bring about revelations, and Dr. King tells Katie about Joshua.",[],TV-PG,Release date,['Paul A. Edwards'],"['', '', '']",[],"['mind control', 'gun', 'motorcycle', 'street thug', 'memory erasure', 'speech', 'scream', 'shower', 'smoke', 'battle of the sexes', 'stalking']",[],"Stephanie (Julie Benz) enjoyed a quiet evening with an old friend, Lena, who was attacked in her apartment by someone who was keeping an eye on both of them. She asked Jim (Michael Chiklis) for help and Jim assured her he could handle it, since he was a crimefighter by trade and hobby. More hobby than trade, so she offers to lend her abilities to the case. Which Jim rejected because he thought his powers were way better for handling crimefighting. And if that wasn't the only double-standard going, Daphne (Kay Panabaker) wanted to go on a date with Chris on his motorcycle, which Jim vehemently denied. However, JJ (Jimmy Bennett) was being asked out by Bailey Browning, and not just for helping her with her homework. Jim was OK with that, as she was a hot senior, and Chris was a senior with a motorcycle. And since Jim walked proudly into that big bear trap, Stephanie decided that gave her the green light to change professions from scientist to cop. And even insisted she'll catch Lena's attacker efore Jim does. However, she may not want to be so confident, as the person had powers of their own...to move anywhere in the wind without being detected.

Since Jim and Stephanie are trying to out-duel the other, they call in their sidekicks for assistance. And if you think George (Romany Malco) and Katie (Autumn Reeser) would be more practical and realistic about this...then you know how these things work. George thinks there are advantages to Stephanie's speed, and she has that lab where they can analyze stuff he can't pronounce since he barely passed freshman chem. Katie questions is speed is really the advantage and concedes a 'lair' sounds much more cool than a lab. Jim counters with police scanners and crime databases, which Katies describes as ""really cool stuff you only see in the movies to provide Mark Wahlberg a clue he missed for the first two hours.""

Dr. King (Stephen Collins) pays a visit to Joshua (Josh Stewart) at Katie's house. King is having issues about Joshua leaving him and threatens to have a few words with Katie about it. But Joshua tells him Katie already knows everything. King thinks he didn't tell her about the things he's done, and both of them know Joshua killing King or erasing his memory is not as easy as it sounds. And King reminds him Katie still works for him.

Jim heads over to talk to Lena, only Stephanie beat him to it. However, Jim was the sketch artist, and Lena's description lead to the valet at the restaurant where Stephanie and her were right before the attack. He had Lena's car keys, which were attached to the house keys, thus no forced entry. But one question for Jim: why was nothing taken? Stephanie heads to work, where Katie was kind enough to purchase the same software Jim used at work, and the computer rendering looked familiar to her as well.

At school, Daphne is not happy JJ gets to go on his date with Bailey and thinks JJ is only getting some play because the SAT's are coming up and Bailey needs a tutor. Daphne claims she can prove it, and she goes to Bailey. But a mind-read reveals Bailey had no ulterior motives for JJ.

DAPHNE: Oh my God. She actually likes him!

Bailey goes back to him to admit he was right, but JJ didn't trust her and thought because Jim vetoed her date with Chris that she wants to submarine his date with Natalie. Whoops, wait. That's JJ's ex. And of course Daphne heard JJ's thoughts, so we have an awkward brother-sister situation that none of us ever went though...unless we were on Jerry Springer or one of those shows. Actually, JJ is using Bailey to get over Natalie. And Daphne will get over that by going out with Chris.

Stephanie goes to confront the valet at the restaurant. And it turns out she had a way of stopping him: taking his car keys and setting off his alarm. Which Jim discovered as he was walking up to them. Round 1 to Stephanie. Except the valet had plenty of witnesses to prove he was at the restaurant the whole night, so the police couldn't charge him. Stephanie is upset, but Katie thinks heading into enemy territory with a peace offering might help. In this case, bribing George with a smoothie to get a look at his equipment. (His COMPUTER equipment, you pervs!) At home, Jim apologizes for making it a competition, but George calls him about another attack on a professor at Pacific Bay College. And since Katie has access to 'the lair', she calls Stephanie. And the competition continues.

Stephanie beats Jim to the house (shocking, right?), but she kind of forgot about facing someone with a long record of felonious assaults. Fortunately, Jim arrives, but the intruder (and by the way, looks NOTHING like the valet) escapes by turning into steam/fog/whatever. And Jim would like to know how Stephanie knew where to go.

Everybody gathers, but Katie and George argue about the sanctity of the lair...or the smoothie. (""Kids, if you don't behave, I'm going to turn this lair around!"") Everybody agrees to play nice and catch Mr. Steam. While George and his computer (it's a she) search for Jim's sketch, he calls Daphne to apologize for dropping the hammer down on her date with Chris. Only she's actually on the date with Chris and thinks she can take care of herself. And Chris actually taking Jim's side in this ends the date rather quickly.

JJ goes on the date with Bailey, and they end up on Mulholland Drive (which is suddenly in Pacific Bay). Bailey kisses him, but all JJ can think about is Natalie. And JJ gives his first 'it's not you, it's me' speech. Bailey isn't handling it particularly well.

At GlobalTech, King goes through with his promise to talk to Katie, even giving her the file on Joshua and hinting he was 'involved' with the late Dr. Chiles' research. The news Jim gave Stephanie was even worse. Tom Seeley, their break-in artist, spent time at Santos County Correctional Facility. The same place where Rebeccas Jessup (created shockwaves) and Theo Patton (the firestarter) also spent some quality time. Lena volunteered there, leading Jim and Stephanie to conclude she botched the suspect description on purpose, either to protect them or herself. Jim gets ready to call George while Stephanie has a shower. A steam shower. (yes, you know where this is going) But Tom is only there to talk. Jim comes back, but Tom wants to know what happened to him. Tom's memory was erased, he woke up with those powers, and the only thing he knew was seeing Lena at the prison. He had vague recollections of getting shots and everybody taking orders from one person, including Lena. Jim asks him to remember anything about the man. It was much easier than they thought, as a flyer on the table with Dr. King's face on it was all Tom needed to see. He wanted payback and took off to get it.

Turns out, Daphne made the mistake of walking to a friend's house on her own and runs straight into a mugger. Chris comes to defend her, but the mugger pulls a gun. Daphne tells him to put the gun down and just walk away. And the mugger puts the gun down and just walks away. And while she was at it, these were not the droids they were looking for. She can influence people. Very Obi-Wan or Professor Xavier of her.

Tom finds King and is ready to kill him, but King tells him he cured him of his paralysis. He was thrown from a balcony during a prison fight, and the injections were the cure. The steam was a side effect. Tom doesn't believe it and knocks him out. Stephanie makes it there, but Tom would rather kill her instead. Jim makes it just in time and sprays Tom with nitrogen to stop him. It's enough for Stephanie to be freed, but Tom escapes.

Katie confronts Joshua about killing people. She shows him the file and tells him to leave. But he holds on to her and 'convinces' her he never killed people and King never talked to her. And it's all water under the bridge. But at home, Stephanie isn't sure whether to believe Tom or Dr. King. Daphne comes home, and Chris' motorcycle can be heard outside. Jim is livid that Daphne lied to him about going to her friend's house and grounds her for two weeks. Which Daphne 'negotiates' to next time she does it, two weeks. Stephanie asks King about it, and he lies a blue streak about it, not knowing how much Stephanie knew. She asks him about Lena Perkins, and he lies to her again about not knowing where she is. Still, she had to present his award later that night. And while the dinner was going on, Lena and Tom Seeley were taken away, and Dr. King studied the surveillance video to discover the truth about Stephanie and Jim."

TWELVE HOURS EARLIER

Thanks to her new ability to influence people, Daphne (Kay Panabaker) gets an advance on her allowance. Naturally, JJ (Jimmy Bennett) is jealous, and he wouldn't mind Daphne's help to get back Natalie. Jim and Stephanie talk about Dr. King (Stephen Collins), and Stephanie wants to shadow him to find out what he knows. Jim thinks it's a good idea as a cop. As Stephanie's husband...not so much. Meanwhile, Dr. King had the same idea in finding out how Jim and Stephanie got their abilities. He sends Victoria () the shapeshifter to infiltrate their home. While Stephanie alerts Katie (Autumn Reeser) about what they knew (and she's worried about Stephanie, too, since the hero always gets hurt when they try to talk to the villain), Jim and George (Romany Malco) do some old-fashioned police work in the lair, tracing a phone number Dr. King has called numerous times, the idea being to get the person to flip on King. Jim leaps over to the apartment and hits paydirt. Jeremy Waldren had surveillance photos of the entire family on his wall.

JJ ""runs into"" Natalie at her regular place for coffee. Before JJ can win her back, Natalie notices a locket a waitress is wearing that looked just like her mother's. That locket was stolen and her mother killed. Natalie gets too worked up and leaves. JJ's research indicated Natalie's mother and a coworker were robbed and shot. The coworker survived. (They did it.) Against Daphne's protestations, JJ is going to investigate and find out what the police couldn't. However, Stephanie being home in the middle of the day caught their attention more. She decided to clean their bathroom, even though she did it the night before. Which is Drama 101 talk for Stephanie not being Stephanie. Victoria takes off before Stephanie arrives at the house. Victoria disguises her voice as Chris and calls Daphne to get her out of the house. She shape-shifts into Daphne to continue her investigations. Although going into Jim and Stephanie's bedroom does raise the alarm bells for JJ, and once again Victoria forgot Daphne was going to help JJ find out about the locket. JJ unknowingly spilled the information about being a superbrain and that Daphne could read minds. Victoria gets out of there before JJ could question her further.

Stephanie's 'in' with Dr. King is to volunteer to continue the trials Dr. Chiles started. Dr. King tries to pass off Chiles' experiments as unethical and illegal, but Stephanie thinks she can make progress and still keep the experiments above board. Dr. King turns her down. Fortunately, Jim calls Stephanie to tell her Dr. King had someone investigating the family. Jim calls Daphne at home, and Victoria got the message. He tells Daphne/Victoria to stay at home with JJ (who wasn't there), and Victoria calls Dr. King right away.

JJ meets up with the real Daphne, who naturally had no knowledge Daphne/Victoria blew him off earlier. Daphne couldn't get the waitress with the locket to give up the information, so she pulls the Jedi mind trick to find out she stole it from an antique shop. And JJ can't help but notice these were not the droids they were looking for. When she gets the antique shop owner to give up the address of the original seller, JJ confronts her about it. (""You just blinked 8 times in the last 2.3 seconds!"") She tries it on him to get him to drop it, but it didn't work. JJ claimed he could control 38% more of his brain than the average human. But Daphne is more than free to use her Jedi mind trick on the man who sold the locket.

Back at Waldren's apartment, Jim channeled his inner and lifts some fingerprints using common, everyday household items. However, there was no need, as Victoria walked right in as herself. Jim confronts her and she maces him. By the time he gets to the street, she's disappeared into the crowd, which is easy for her to do, of course. Dr. King is shocked to find out the whole family has powers and that they're permanent. Dr. King tells her to go back in, but Victoria told him Jim could identify her. Dr. King orders her to kill him and take his place. Victoria wonders if that might be because Dr. King has a thing for Stephanie, but he vehemently denies it.

Katie goes home to Joshua/The Watcher (Josh Stewart), who was going through withdrawal symptoms. She tells him to keep getting the injections from King until they could figure out what was going on, but he refused to do it, nor does he want her to tell Stephanie. Will tells her she could replicate King's formula. Stephanie catches her at the lab taking some of the Trilsettum Coronis plant, and Katie can't think of a good lie. Stephanie pretends she's Wonder Woman and has the Lasso of Truth around Katie. Katie spills the beans about Joshua and was keeping it a secret for the same reason Stephanie asked her to keep her family a secret. Katie tells Stephanie Joshua refuses to take the serum, but his body won't allow it. She asks Stephanie for help.

Jim comes home, only to have George shoot him. Jim is ticked George shot him, but obviously Victoria didn't realize Jim was bullet-proof. Somehow, George/Victoria covers his story, as Jim is suddenly the dumbest superhero on the planet. And the real George comes back and denies shooting Jim. (""Maybe it was someone else; you know we'all don't look alike, Jim."") They put all the pieces together and realize the shapeshifter Stephanie ran into a few weeks back was the same woman who maced Jim earlier and pretended to be George, not knowing Jim was bullet-proof. Jim high-tails it to GlobalTech, and Stephanie intercepts him. Or so he thinks. Stephanie/Victoria successfully covers for herself by describing the contents of the nightstand by their bed. And since Jim thought Victoria was Stephanie, he also spilled that he can't kiss anybody wearing Stephanie's cinoxate lip gloss.

JJ and Daphne make it to the house of Kip Rainey, the man who sold the locket. It turns out he was the coworker who was shot with Natalie's mother. He wants to send them on their way, but his wife, Melissa, comes in and offers JJ and Daphne some iced tea. When Daphne touches his wife's fingers as she takes the glass, she sees it was the wife who shot them and took the locket. She runs out to call Jim, but Melissa figures it out and pistol-whips her. She holds JJ at gunpoint, and Kip is panicking because he refuses to help her cover up another murder. Natalie's mother was sleeping with her husband, the the murder was accidental. Right before she's about to shoot JJ, Jim busts down the garage door and takes them out.

Stephanie visits Joshua to tell him she's working on her own serum to counter the effects of the Trilsettum plant. He'd be without powers, but he's fine with that since his organs wouldn't degenerate. Joshua wanted to know why she was doing it, but Stephanie was trying to protect her family, including Katie.

Stephanie comes home as Jim reads JJ and Daphne the riot act about investigating a murder by themselves. She gives him a kiss and...yup, it was Victoria with the cinoxate lip gloss on her. However, the real Stephanie calls him and he figures it out in a hurry. He sends the kids upstairs, telepathing to Daphne they were in danger. Victoria figures it out, too, and lets Jim know she just took away his powers.

JIM: Even without my powers, I'm still fairly confident I can kick your ass.

VICTORIA: (shapeshifts into Jim) Probably. But can you kick yours?

And the battle royale is on. Jim is certain Victoria would never be able to always fool his family into thinking she was him.

JIM: We know a lot more about Dr. King's plans than you think!

VICTORIA: Then you must know Dr. King has his eyes set on your wife. Why else do you think he sent me here to kill you?

Those were the wrong words, and Jim goes the full Vic Mackey on Victoria, nailing her with a poker from the fireplace. And that is the body Stephanie finds when she walks in. Jim walks back down the stairs after checking on the kids, and Victoria conveniently changes back to herself to prove she's dead. Joshua came over to return the favor and got rid of the body. Joshua knew her, and he kept his own identity from the family to keep them protected. But there was a problem: the experiments went way beyond Dr. King, and King would come after the Powells if he found out Victoria was dead. Stephanie decided she could pretend to be Victoria if she knew something only Victoria did. And Jim comes up with an idea the average husband would never think of. He sends Stephanie in to pretend she was Victoria staying in Stephanie's form for the surveillance cameras. And 'Victoria' convinces King to add Stephanie to his team."

With George's (Romany Malco) help, he traps a crook in an alley, who tries to fire a gun at Jim. Jim does his best Wonder Woman impression to deflect the bullets, only one of those bullets deflects into an apartment complex and hits a kid. Jim follows the boy and his mother to the hospital in a massive feeling of guilt, despite George telling him it can't possibly be his fault.

Joshua (Josh Stewart) is really glad to have met Katie (Autumn Reeser). So much so, he proposes to her...rather badly, but she was 96.3% sure that's what he was doing, and she was 100% sure she wanted to accept. (""I always had a crush on Wolverine, but I never gave much thought to if I married Wolverine. And we had little Wolvie babies."") She told Stephanie (Julie Benz) the good news, who insisted on throwing her an engagement party. (""It's what Batman would do for Robin."" ""I'm pretty sure Robin's a confirmed bachelor, know what I mean?"") At the party, Jim is trying to live down the kid being wounded, but Dr. King (Stephen Collins) decided to drop by the engagement and 'congratulate' the happy couple. Of course, Jim and Stephanie know the truth and were wary of Dr. King pulling something...such as stealing the trilsettum serum Stephanie was working on from their house while there. And using it, too.

Jim and Stephanie let Daphne (Kay Panabaker) and JJ (Jimmy Bennett) in on what happened. Dr. King was an obvious suspect, but he had his own serum, so he wouldn't have motive to steal Stephanie's. Joshua, however, needed it to survive, which he denied when Stephanie confronted him. He asked Katie to trust him, especially since they were engaged. She did. Stephanie, not so much.

As JJ tried to get a date with Natalie, who shoots him down because she has to study to get a scholarship, Jim goes to the hospital to apologize to the kid's mother about him being shot. He doesn't tell her how he was involved, of course, but Stephanie wants him to dig deeper into who stole the serum. Jim's next candidate is Chris, Daphne's boyfriend, since he has a record. Jim is worried about releasing a supervillain on the world, and his fears are confirmed when someone punches out an ATM to get the cash inside of it. A witness saw a blue motorcycle in the area, just like the one Chris rode. Jim confronts Chris on it, except another ATM gets robbed right when Jim is accusing Chris. Daphne was, as you may expect, not happy her dad was accusing her boyfriend of theft. Daphne goes to apologize to Chris about her father, but he has no problem with what he did. Except he hugs her, and she gets the whole story. Chris took the serum to heal his father, who had been in a wheelchair from the auto accident from two years ago Chris felt guilty about. Of course, she couldn't tell him that.

JJ gets an interesting offer from Mr. Litchfield (seriously, is there a sleazier teacher on TV without committing any sort of felony?) to make Natalie's road to the scholarship a lot smoother in exchange for JJ joining the academic decathlon team. He doesn't want to do it, but Litchfield gives her the scholarship to use as leverage against JJ. Now he HAS to join the academic decathlon team in order for her to keep it.

Joshua confronts Dr. King at his office. Dr. King tells him he treated Joshua like his own son, but his son wouldn't have been pumped full of experimental medicines like he was. It cured Joshua but turned him into a killer. Dr. King thought Joshua would come back because he needs his serum to survive unless someone else...and Dr. King correctly figures out Stephanie was helping Joshua. And he accuses Joshua of 'loving' Katie to get Stephanie to help him, which Joshua vehemently denied.

At GlobalTech, the serum Stephanie created to counteract the effects of the trilsettum worked on a lab rat. In fact, the antidote even returned the rat's organs to normal. It was time to see if Joshua wanted to have a go at it. He talks to Katie in private, asking her if she really wants him with no powers. She does, and he takes the injection. After a few -like moments, it doesn't work. Joshua is understandably depressed. Dr. King calls Stephanie into his office to explain about Joshua, and Stephanie plays along about not knowing about Joshua's powers. Except Joshua kept one of those powers a secret from her: the ability to erase memories, which he claims Joshua did to Katie at some point. And suddenly Stephanie remembered that happening to Daphne as well.

Meanwhile, Chris found the money his father, Roy (), stole. It turns out he didn't give a crap about working again and simply wanted yet another beer. Apparently he was a career criminal before the accident. But he can get it himself...by punching a hole in the refrigerator. Obviously he can't control the serum. A fact confirmed by bumping into his son (and knocking him down) on the way out the door to another ATM. Jim comes to see Chris' father, and Chris continues to try to cover for him. But Jim tries to convince him to take his dad into custody. Jim finds him, and the fight is on. Except Roy gets the better of Jim and leaves him in a wall. Jim is concerned about trying to take him down, but he should be more concerned that the serum was wearing off on Roy and he had no problem threatening Daphne and her family to get some more, even throwing his own son out of the house...through the window.

George had an idea to help Jim: keep making Roy miss hitting him, thus expending his energy and serum. He had to put it to good use right away, as Chris finally confessed from his hospital bed Roy was going to GlobalTech to get more of the serum. He takes Katie hostage. She hands him the keys and tries to speed her way to injecting him with a sedative. But like Jim, a needle can't penetrate. Roy grabs the vials and heads for the garage, only to be confronted by Jim. Sure enough, Jim takes George's advice and makes Roy keep punching into concrete. Several misses later, plus some well-timed hits, and Roy is down for the count.

But if Jim was mad at Roy, he was ten times as mad at Joshua for erasing her memory, and he all but puts him into a wall at his house. He tried to explain he was trying to prevent Daphne from turing into him. Katie sees the whole thing, and she hands him back his engagement ring.

Daphne goes to look in on Chris, now that his father was gone. He felt guilty about messing up his father's life two years ago in the accident, but Roy had been messing him up for ages. He didn't feel alone, thanks to Daphne. He didn't say 'I love you' to her directly, but thinking it is enough for Daphne. And it turns out Jasper, the kid who got hit by the bullet Jim deflected, had a small tumor inside of him they never would have caught had he not had surgery for the bullet. Jim feels relief. Katie, as you may have expected, was heartbroken. So was Joshua, who left town, only to discover his powers had finally disappeared.

JJ reluctantly joined the academic decathlon team, and we found out why Litchfield wanted him so badly. He was on the take from Dr. King, who wanted JJ to solve a particular math problem."

He asks Stephanie to inject him with the trilsettum plant, but Stephanie's worried about the side effects. But King gives her little choice, much like Katie (Autumn Reeser) not giving the family much choice in helping her deal with her post-Joshua depression. Which means Charades...AND Scattergories. Thankfully, George (Romany Malco) has a way for Jim (Michael Chiklis) to get out of it. It seemed like a simple case: apprehend someone stealing cough syrup from a pharmacy. One Jim Powell brakes special later, done. However, a woman comes to visit George at the police station. A statuesque blonde named Sophie Adler () 'asks' George if it was really necessary to prosecute the man. And an odd mist passes from her to George. Suddenly the case is dropped, much to Jim's surprise, and George has a date with Sophie. It turns out, the man stealing the cough syrup was doing it for her, possibly to use the active ingredients in it for crystal meth. It would make sense, since it didn't make sense to Jim why a soccer dad of three was stealing cough syrup. George wants to go out to dinner, but Sophie wants him to do her a favor first. One mist spray later, and George is robbing a pharmacy at gunpoint. Completely denying it to Jim, as you may imagine, since he had no recollection of any of it. This in spite of the fact the description of the robber included the same brown suit and chartreuse tie George wore on his date with Sophie.

Daphne (Kay Panabaker) and Chris are in school, where Chris was about to receive a week of after-school detention for being late three times to class. However, one Jedi mind trick later, and he gets his third warning instead. Chris was already suspicious of the Powells, since his father called him from jail claiming he saw Jim with superhuman strength and Stephanie with superhuman speed. Daphne tried to play it off. But Chris saw her talk the robber from shooting them, and Chris was trying to put the pieces together. Of course, Daphne can pull the Jedi mind trick on him, too. JJ's (Jimmy Bennett) term for it was 'pushing', and she pushed her boyfriend. (""He used to have two thoughts on his mind, and now he only has one?"") But JJ asked a good question: how long she could make it last? JJ thinks her push only stopped him from asking questions, not being suspicious or putting the same details about the family back together again. Daphne might have to give him more pushes. Sure enough, Chris brings it up again later, and she gets him out of it...for about three seconds. And it isn't getting better.

As Jim and Stephanie prepare for their double-date with George and Sophie, Stephanie tells him about having to inject a prisoner. Even though Lucas' major crime was check kiting, Jim is still worried about injecting a criminal with superpowers. Stephanie agrees, but it was the only way to get in with Dr. King and figure out who he is working for. George was already throwing around the ""L"" word regarding Sophie, even though they only met a day ago. And George clearly left his testicles at home, since he was wishing Sophie a Happy Day-iversary.) Sophie actually went along with that, as long as they had the lobster with white wine. She insisted on those, in fact. George was happy to partake, even though he was highly allergic to shellfish. Jim pulls him aside to ask him what was wrong, but George kept denying everything, even accusing Jim of being jealous. Jim tells him he threw the sketch out to cover for him, and George ends the dinner right then and there. Sophie asks him about it, and George thinks Jim is just overstepping his bounds as a sketch artist. Sophie goes back to apologize to Jim and Stephanie. She gives Jim a kiss, and you can guess Jim gets influenced.

Later that night, Stephanie agrees with Jim's original assessment of George 'showing off' for Sophie, but now Jim no longer agrees with that. Now he thinks Sophie is great. In fact...

JIM: Sophie's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life.

That went over with Stephanie as well as you might imagine. And Jim dropping off a dozen roses at Sophie's apartment is a lot worse, particularly since George was having that exact same idea at that exact same moment. As if that wasn't awkward enough, Jim tells George he's in love with Sophie. George is ticked and the two are about to step off. Only Jim's definition of step off sends George flying through the air and into a wall with just a tiny push. Sophie is shocked, but Jim is more than happy to boast of his skills. One little mist later, and Sophie's traded up, sending Jim to get four heating elements the Army uses to heat MREs. This, of course, would require Jim to breach an army base, take out a few soldiers, and steal the MRE heating elements. Back at home, Stephanie wonders where Jim had been all day, since she couldn't contact him. Sophie calls and tells him to bring the boxes over. Jim makes an excuse to leave but is dumb enough to pass by Daphne, who knows where he's really going. And she tells Stephanie where Jim is really going.

At the lab, King makes one of the most awkward passes at a woman in history (seriously, even I've done better), and they go to meet Lucas. Lucas wants to know if the trilsettum therapy will fix him. Stephanie hesitates but tells him it will.

Jim delivers the boxes, and Sophie promises more work for him with his skills. But she decides to make out with him as a thank you. And yes, Stephanie sees it. Thankfully, she confronts him about it right away, but Jim is completely off the reservation, more than happy to throw away 18 years of marriage for Sophie. Stephanie tosses him out, and Jim is only happy to go. Sophie witnesses the entire exchange from a distance before meeting up with a woman who demands an update on the project. Mrs. X () was upset Dr. King was letting too many 'supers' run around loose in the city. Sophie promised the woman she found the perfect candidate to carry out the project, and the woman tells her in no uncertain terms it better work.

Then things got weird. Jim went to crash at George's place as if he didn't steal Sophie from him and throw him into a wall. Even weirder, George doesn't remember being with Sophie or being thrown into a wall. (Interesting...) And now George wondered what the hell Jim was doing walking out on Stephanie, but Jim didn't really care.

Without Sophie's 'influence', George suddenly had a theory about what was going on and went to JJ to talk to him about it. JJ was up in arms over Jim leaving the family, but George didn't even recall meeting Sophie yet somehow introduced her to Jim. And since JJ knew George was gaga over Sophie, he correctly concluded it was some sort of specialized pheromones Sophie was using. JJ guessed Sophie chemically enhanced the pheromones she naturally gave off, but why was the question. George and JJ go to Sophie's apartment and hit the mother of all meth labs. But JJ has a look at the chemicals. The bad news: the chemicals weren't for pheromone enhancement, meaning his dad is a nutjob. The Worse news: the chemicals were for a bomb big enough to take down an entire building. But George asks the big question: what does the blonde bombshell bomb maker need with Jim? The answer: Jim is to deliver a backpack to 'an old friend', or specifically between the propane tanks on the roof of the building where her old friend works. The old friend is Dr. King, and the building is GlobalTech.

At GlobalTech, Stephanie injects Lucas, although not without serious reservations...not to mention a serious reaction by Lucas. As she goes out for air, George calls her and tells her everything. She's not happy JJ got involved, but they correctly guessed Sophie had to be a super. (""It would explain why Jim's acting like Charlie Sheen."" Gotta love the irony of the Sheen 20/20 interview the same night, huh?) Stephanie was at least partially-relieved Jim wasn't acting of his own accord, but obviously Jim delivering a bomb somewhere kind of dampened the mood. And George triangulating Jim's mobile phone to GlobalTech really makes it interesting.

Stephanie caught up to Jim and tried to stop him. However, Sophie was right there to 'influence' him into staying with her. Stephanie knew it was the pheromones Sophie was giving off that was controlling him.

STEPHANIE: And to think the other night I just thought you were wearing really cheap perfume.

SOPHIE: Men seem to like it, don't they?

Sophie doesn't think Stephanie can stop Jim, but Stephanie is more confident in her truly being in love with Jim. She tells Jim Sophie wants him to blow up the building, but Jim continues to go through with it. She begs him not to do it and tells him about all of the things they built together: the house, the birth of the kids. Jim says he feels passion with Sophie, but Stephanie shows him what passion is by laying quite the kiss on him. Yes, it worked. This is television, after all. Of course, they only have 15 seconds to defuse the bomb, but Jim tosses it like a frisbee. Yes, it explodes into fireworks as they kiss.

Sophie, having failed, met with Mrs. X again, who wonders what happened. She leaves Sophie, who breathes a sigh of relief and goes back to her car...and blows up.

Chris confronts Daphne once again about her family's superpowers, but this time Daphne can't make him forget again. She tells the truth. He wonders what she could do, and she tells him she could read and influence thoughts. Daphne understood if Chris wanted to dump her for that, but Chris is glad someone shared such an important secret with him for the first time in his life, and he had no intention of leaving. Quite the opposite, actually.

Stephanie returned to the lab to find Winnick gone, and she had been lied to. Winnick was a murderer. And Dr. King had a job for him, especially given Lucas's ability to grow claws (""That's a new one.""). What that job would be was a mystery, but Mrs. X had a job for him already. She picks him up in her limo."

The only trouble is, mountain lions have four claws, not five. They would also leave tracks, which this murderer didn't. Jim (Michael Chiklis) suspects a super might have attacked the woman and asks George (Romany Malco) to talk to the coroner's office about it. But of course Lucas Winnick () was the man behind it, and Mrs. X () tasks him with recovering the body, which he does. He also takes out the coroner who discovered something unusual about the woman but was unable to tell Jim and George about it. Jim and Stephanie (Julie Benz) are understandably worried this person might be attacking other supers, since the woman and a third victim had trace elements of the same chemicals in their bodies the Powells had from the trilsettum plant. Sure enough, Stephanie slips in during the investigation at the crime scene of the third victim and finds the trilsettum serum.

Daphne (Kay Panabaker) and Chris are still together, except Chris wants her to ditch school to go to a Sarah Bareilles concert at a shopping mall. (Didn't that stuff go out with the 80s?) Anyway, Daphne doesn't want to ditch, but ironically, Chris is pretty good at influencing her. She strikes a deal with JJ (Jimmy Bennett) to finish the history paper she was going to complete in math class in exchange for her finding out why Mr. Litchfield continues to give him weird and incredibly difficult equations to solve under the guise of the academic decathlon. A little Jedi mind trick on the vice-principal in the hall who caught them, and they even have their lunch and gas paid for.

Lucas tracks down Katie (Autumn Reeser), of all people, presumably looking for Joshua. Scaring the crap out of Katie in the process, he thinks Joshua is still around, even though Katie assured him they broke up and hasn't talked to him since. However, Lucas gets a scent of something (think a Wolverine/Beast combination...without the personality). He goes animal on Katie. She screams...and propels Lucas across the street to land on a car and crush it. WTF???

Katie, completely freaked out by what happened, called Jim and Stephanie over, but it didn't take long for her to figure out she was the one to telekinetically launch that 'manimal' into her neighbor's car. She's more freaked out and needs to sit down...and a chair pulls right up to her. Now everybody is freaked out. Stephanie wants to take Katie for some tests, but Jim thinks bigger picture, since this person was hunting supers, such as their kids. Unfortunately, Lucas was already calling Mrs. X to confirm both Katie and the Powells weren't on the trilsettum vaccines but he was picking up a scent from them anyway. Mrs. X tells him to kill all of them.

At school, JJ is refusing to do the equation Litchfield gave him, and Litchfield calls Dr. King (Stephen Collins) for help. Dr. King, who blew off Stephanie's theories earlier in the day about one of the test subjects being on the loose, tells Litchfield it's his problem. (""You have three degrees and you're teaching high school. Since when has knowledge helped you achieve anything?"") He tells Litchfield to get on it or he'd have to intervene. Mr. Litchfield tries to intervene in the only way a very bad teacher would: with threats. Fortunately, Stephanie arrived to get him out of school and they went to find Daphne, who was currently convincing the bodyguard at the Sara Bareilles concert they were on the list.

Katie tried to describe the man who attacked her to sketch artist Jim, but he needed a English-Nerd translation book. (GEORGE: How did someone as fine as you become such a geek?) (WE ALL WANT TO KNOW THAT!!!) Fortunately, modern technology gave them Lucas' profile, except he was on death row according to the computer. However, Stephanie arrives and admits she might have actually 'created' Lucas. Stephanie goes to the house, only Lucas is already there. He admits he was hired to kill them. Stephanie thinks George can get him a lighter sentence if he turns evidence. But he didn't buy it...and put his claws through Stephanie.

Jim gets back to find Stephanie still gone and bolts for the house. Fortunately, Stephanie's fast metabolism kept her from dying. (""He found me...and I think I stained the floor."") Jim takes her to George's lair at her insistence. He wants to find Daphne, and he orders JJ to hack into her cell phone and email to figure out where she is. He finds the text from Chris, and Jim heads over to Windward Hall to find her. Unfortunately, Lucas is already there. Jim calls her and she tries to get away from the concert to call him back. Lucas finds her and pretends to work at the school, telling Daphne her mother had been attacked. For some reason, she can't read his mind and agrees to go along. Fortunately, Jim gets there just in the nick of time (yes, they do that on this show). However, Lucas can take a punch and can leap through the air like Jim can. Jim finally gets the upper hand and was almost ready to kill him before Daphne begged him to stop. After all, his powers would eventually wear off.

Back at home, Stephanie was getting worse from some kind of infection in her. She still refused to go to the hospital, but JJ was able to diagnose the bacteria that got in Stephanie's system. Jim had one doctor he could take Stephanie to, even though it sounded crazy: Dr. King. King tried to play innocent, but Jim told him they had to put aside what they knew about each other to save Stephanie's life. Dr. King confirmed Lucas gave her the infection, and Jim told King to give her the trilsettum serum, regardless of the side effects it may cause. Jim gives her the shot, and Jim tells her to rest, even though she's wondering why she was at GlobalTech. She then goes out for a run...and disappears.

Daphne drops off JJ's equation to Mr. Litchfield, but all she could get out of him was Litchfield being relieved he wouldn't go back empty handed. Given everything that had happened, Daphne wants to stop dating Chris for a while, but he has a whole list of fun for them to try. Dr. King is happy with the email he got from Litchfield, but not so happy to see Mrs. X at the door. She wants to know why there are supers running free throughout the city. She was to take full control of the research from now on. On the good side (for Dr. King, anyway), he was one equation closer (thanks to JJ) to making the serum's effects permanent. Of course, he could do what Katie did: get impregnated by a super."

Suddenly, she gets pulled back to the present, where Jim wonders if everything is OK, only Stephanie isn't even sure what just happened. But she insisted Jim go to Cordero's farewell party, as he was being assigned to a new district. Cordero was sorry to not see Jim anymore, but tragically there would be no transfer as Cordero is gunned down in the street by what looked like a gang. An investigation begins, but Mrs. Cordero talks to Jim and George (Romany Malco) privately, saying Cordero was worried about a particular case in the court system, which might have had something to do with his murder.

Stephanie finds out from Daphne and JJ Mr. Litchfield was giving him complex equations to solve and was worried about JJ not finishing them. Stephanie runs out to the school to talk to Mr. Litchfield, only she ran into the future again, where the school is surrounded by the military, JJ and Daphne are hiding out, and George has to hold back the authorities from capturing them. Stephanie gets pulled back to the present but correctly figures out the government now knew they were supers, and they guess Daphne's boyfriend, Chris, must have ratted them out, since Daphne stopped doing favors for him with her Jedi mind tricks. A third run into the future, and Stephanie sees an FBI agent rough up Katie (Autumn Reeser) when she refuses to talk, injuring (perhaps even killing) her unborn child in the process. Then she sees all of them at the police station, and she was being grilled by the same FBI agent while Jim, Daphne, and JJ were sedated. But she does hear about an incident on the news in City Square that prompted the events. She has to figure out a way to time travel forward to that exact location and time. It's a lot of difficult math, but JJ is kind of a specialist in that.

Mrs. X () used the trilsettum to bring Victoria the shape-shifter back to life, apparently brought to her by Joshua. (Really? You could drive a truck through that plot hole.) Anyway, her job is to find out more about Katie's pregnancy (not sure how she found out about that, either). She takes out Katie's OB/GYN and is about to give the baby a check of the amniotic fluid, but Katie thinks it's a bit too early for that.

Jim gets a call from Mrs. Cordero when she comes home to find her house ransacked. Whoever did it was looking for something but didn't find it. However, she had a fairly educated guess it was in a safe she didn't even know about until recently. Jim picked the lock in that way he has and discovered personnel files on a group of cops. George suspected Cordero had a list of dirty cops, and it was a gang that shot Cordero in order to keep being protected by those dirty cops. It was confirmed when O'Bannon, one of the investigators, pulls Jim aside to allay suspicions about his partner, Rizzo, being a dirty cop, too. Jim meets him in private in a parking garage. And if this sounded like a setup, then you were right. The same gang guns down Jim in the garage. Of course, he only comes away with some scratches and a lot of anger.

JJ crunches the numbers and helps Stephanie get safely to City Square two minutes before whatever happened to bring the government down on the Powells. What Stephanie didn't expect is Daphne being involved. She got a text from Chris to be at the square as soon as he finished his last tow. Jim was also there, looking around for potential suspects. Unfortunately, he found it. Someone was about to shoot George as he gave his memorial speech to Detective Cordero. He rams the SUV the assassin was in, flips it through the air...and a cameraman catches all of it. She gets dragged back to the present, and to stop their family from being found out, she has to stop Jim from saving George's life.

Jim comes home and Stephanie explains everything. But Jim can't reach George and he can't call the police since it's a dirty cop who is doing the shooting. Stephanie all but begs him not to use his powers, but Jim can't let George be killed, either. At the City Square, Chris apologizes to Daphne for being mad at her about not using her powers to help him. Jim continues to look through the crowd. He manages to find the same rifle sticking out of the same SUV, only he manages to avoid the cameraman and punch out the assassin inside, who turns out to be Rizzo. Both men are in on it, and now Jim has to find O'Bannon. O'Bannon makes his way through the crowd. But Jim knew Daphne was there, so he calls her on his cell to ask her to listen to everybody's mind at the memorial to locate O'Bannon. Daphne slips through the crowd of uniformed officers looking for O'Bannon. She spots him and calls Jim, but Jim can't get there fast enough without showing off his leaping ability. Over Jim's protests, Daphne comes up behind O'Bannon and pulls the Jedi mind trick on him. It works, and Daphne gets his gun. But Jim and Stephanie are mad as hell at her. (Gee, there's gratitude for you.) But Daphne hadn't told them about her Jedi mind trick. (JJ: Just FYI, she hasn't done dishes in two weeks.) Stephanie thinks Daphne can go to Chris and make him forget about the Powells' abilities like Joshua did with her, but Daphne is strongly opposed to doing that. There was just one little problem with making Chris forget: she'd have to break up with him. Given that she was in love with him and he forgot about that, too, it was certainly understandable.

Mr. Litchfield also disappeared, and Victoria gave the amniotic test results to Mrs. X. Katie's child had the trilsettum fully integrated into its DNA. Since Victoria used to have a thing for Joshua, she didn't seem too upset with getting to raise Katie's child, since Mrs. X planned to kill Katie as soon as she delievered it."

Edwards'],"['', '', '']",[],"['convict', 'prisoner', 'kidnapping', 'series finale', 'maniac villain', 'government agent', 'unrequited love', 'crash dive', 'airplane', 'stillborn baby', 'needle in eye', 'shot in the chest', 'impostor', 'incarceration', 'elevator', 'doctor', 'shapeshifter', 'arcade game', 'cancer', 'electric shock', 'blackout', 'electrocution', 'death', 'teacher']",[],"George (Romany Malco) is on a small plane that is about to crash. Sound familiar? It's how everything started for the Powells back in September. Back at home, Mr. Litchfield has denigrated into stalker, chasing after JJ (Jimmy Bennett) to solve the equations he assigned him. JJ refuses, and Litchfield contacts Dr. King (Stephen Collins) about it. Dr. King, a bit under the weather, has no sympathy for Litchfield. Nor does Mrs. X (, who is actually the CEO of GlobalTech. She decides to handle it her own way. As does Jim (Michael Chiklis), when JJ tells him about Mr. Litchfield. But Mrs. X got there first: Mr. Litchfield was dead.

George is keeping an eye on Katie (Autumn Reeser), who apparently is not far off from giving birth. Probaby around six months pregnant, but George assures her she won't go through it alone. True, since Joshua (Josh Stewart) shows up to talk to her after George goes off to talk to Jim. It turns out Mr. Litchfield was electrocuted, according to George's friend in the Coroner's Office. Jim thinks a super may have done it. He calls home to Stephanie (Julie Benz), who assures him JJ and Daphne (Kay Panabaker) are OK, although they were having power problems. JJ goes to investigate the circuit box, only to be zapped by the same guy who killed Litchfield.

Jim and Stephanie go right to their first suspect, Dr. King. As it turns out, he is a victim as well. It turns out the trilsettum serum was keeping King alive, as he had cancer for 18 years, which should have killed him long before now. Mrs. X, better known as Helen Burton, CEO of GlobalTech. She was looking for the formula to make the superpowers permanent and was holding JJ in a cell at GlobalTech until he gave her the answers. But he has a cellmate: Joshua, who explains Stephanie's antidote cured him and lets him live without any powers. Of course, if Joshua is there, then the Joshua with Katie must be Victoria, the shape-shifter. But Joshua provided a very important piece of the puzzle. The plane Stephanie and her family went on to Brazil was loaded down with the trilsettum plant because Global Tech was using it to smuggle the plant into the United States. When the plane caught on fire, the family inhaled a significant amount of it, unlike all the other supers, who had it injected.

Jim, Stephanie, and Daphne slip into GlobalTech to find JJ. Daphne is very adept at stopping one guard from shooting them or reporting them to the authorities. Jim could stop any bullet fired at them, but not if they were surrounded. That's where Stephanie's super-speed comes in handy to disarm a cadre of armed soldiers. But it turned out to be all for nothing. Burton was watching them the whole time and manages to gas them on an elevator.

George goes to get medications from Katie's OB/GYN, only the man had no recollection of ever seeing Katie. Which would make sense, given Victoria knocked him out with a tire iron. George puts two and two together and warns Katie Joshua/Victoria isn't who he says he is. Joshua put the same two and two together when JJ told him about Katie's baby. But it was too late. Burton brought Stephanie and a drugged Katie into a room and put guns to their heads while Jim was wacked up with cinoxate to remove his powers. JJ gave her the information, including the final piece: the Powells had actual adrenaline going through them when they inhaled the trilsettum instead of the epinephrine they mixed into the injections. Of course, Burton ordered all of them killed, anyway. And three shots were fired...by Dr. King, at the guards. He also finds Joshua, his son, and tells him to go protect Katie and their child.

King sends Stephanie to get the chopper with Burton in it, since she had 80 criminals at the ready to dose with the trilsettum and sell to the highest bidder. King went to get Jim. Except King still had a thing for Stephanie and decided to get rid of her husband by shooting him. King goes to tell her a guard shot Jim before he got there. One little problem: the cinoxate wore off before the bullets could do any permanent damage. Jim puts Dr. King into a wall...only Dr. King has a big dose of the trilsettum going through him, allowing him to have all of the Powells' abilities. He sets forth to break Jim's neck, and Daphne can't 'convince' him otherwise. But Stephanie can get a syringe of the antidote she created. She tries to trick Dr. King into letting her get close, but he gets the upper hand. He's ready to kill her, but JJ picks up the syringe and does some quick math to throw it like a dart into King's eye. (gross!) Sure enough, Dr. King is trilsettum-free, and the cancer he had ravages him in mere seconds.

Joshua breaks into Katie's house to reveal Victoria, although Katie did the ol shape-shifter fake-out by pretending to know things about her and Joshua that Victoria gets wrong. victoria runs when Joshua tells her he was never in love with her, but in the struggle, Katie's water breaks. They have no choice but to have the baby there, and it doesn's survive. Well, if it was a normal baby. But this kid is part super, so 14 weeks premature is no big deal for it.

The Powells, after all that had happened, finally get to settle down. Except the NSA comes calling and tells them about the plane crash that took place in Northern California with 81 people on board. Except they couldn't find a single body. The NSA knew about the Powells' abilities and wanted them to round up the 80 criminals on board, all of whom had permanent superhuman abilities. The 81st? George, who snuck on the flight."

Grandpa's Greasy Soul Food stands in as a substitute for narcotics strong enough to induce a stupor ""the itis"" when consumed and feelings of withdrawal identical to those experienced by hardcore street addicts in need of a fix. Wunsler's sudden interest in funding Grandpa's ""lifelong"" dream (scripted joke-three weeks since seeing a TV cooking show) is fully exposed in the fade to end scene when he smiles at the sight of the urban blight he knew he would create by funding Grandpa's dispersion of the Soul Food (drugs). Huey plays the usual part of morally outraged kid while his greedy brother smiles broadly at the spoils. The full genius of Wunsler's premeditated evil is saved for the final reveal where (IIRC) a voice-over fills in the details of his genius success in the fine art of forced real estate acquisition at bargain basement prices while panning the rundown wreckage of a formerly vibrant community."

Minnow wake up to find that they have washed ashore on an uncharted island. The captain, Jonas Grumby, more commonly known as the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr), and his first mate Gilligan (Bob Denver) decide to set sail on a raft to try and return to the mainland, even as the Professor (Russell Johnson) tells them it would be foolhardy, while the passengers stay on the island. Out at sea, the Skipper and Gilligan run aground of sharks, and a storm blows the crew back to the island, but Skipper and Gilligan do not know that this island is the same island with the castaways. Meanwhile, the other passengers (Jim Backus, Natalie Schafer, Tina Louise, and Dawn Wells) do not know that they have returned and believe they are actually returning Marubi warriors. The Professor tries to hide everyone in a cave to protect them, and it is this same cave that the Skipper and Gilligan try to hide in when they think the castaways are Marubi warriors. When both groups become aware in the cave that the other group is on the island, each group assume that the other are headhunters. It is only until Gilligan and the Professor get tossed out of the cave in the scuffle that they realize the truth, but Gilligan accidentally sets off a landslide and buries the cave. Everyone gets trapped in the cave, and the Skipper and Professor get everyone out of it. Gilligan hides in the back of the cave ashamed for the collapse for a minute with the Skipper calling him, but he eventually emerges dressed as a native scaring the passengers and the Skipper away from the cave."

Soon, it starts pouring rain and after it finally stops, the Skipper makes plans to build a shelter. Unfortunately, everyone wants their own huts, but Skipper says they're only building one hut because it would take less time and materials. While listening to the radio for the weather report, everyone hears that the Coast Guard is no longer searching for them. While they are building the hut, Mr. Howell is in charge of applying a weather proof concoction to the outside, and the Professor and Skipper are working on the roof and walls. Gilligan is in charge of filling the water barrel to make sure that when the storm does hit, they have enough water for them to drink. Unfortunately, Gilligan leaves the lid off the water barrel, and the Skipper falls in. When Gilligan grabs a ladder for the Skipper, the Professor falls off the roof while standing on it. In departing, Gilligan also knocks the bucket of water-proofing onto Mr. Howell's head. That night, the hut is finished. Gilligan tries to climb into his top hammock bunk, but he doesn't have much success. The Skipper suggests that he sleep on the top, but when he does, he crushes Gilligan because his weight makes the hammock sink. Meanwhile, they overhear the Howells having a fight, and everyone gets involved because the shouting is leaving no one able to sleep. To solve the problem of seven people living together, everyone still brings up building their own huts, taking the parts of the common hut that they made. The Skipper tries to convince them that one hut is better for the upcoming storm, but no one wants to listen to him. The next morning, everyone starts working on their own huts, and end up stalling Gilligan trying to build the Boy's Hut. Mr. Howell comes to borrow the machete from Gilligan, and the Professor borrows the saw. The Skipper gets mad at Gilligan for loaning out all their tools because then they won't be able to finish their own hut and orders him to say ""no"" to everyone no matter what they want. Ginger soon comes over to take some rope and successfully charms it away from Gilligan. When the Skipper returns, he wants Gilligan to bring back all the tools he lent out. Gilligan first sees the Professor for the saw. He is working on a book about their adventures on the island, but while looking at the Professor's hut, Gilligan sees a loose twig and pulls it out. The wall falls down as a result with the entire hut coming down as a result. At the Girl's Hut, Mary Ann and Ginger are showing Gilligan their plans for their hut, but when she smells the fudge is baking is burning, she finds her hut door won't open. Gilligan tries to help, ratting the entire hut so much that the walls collapse. Gilligan and the Skipper soon go to visit the Howell's Hut to suggest coming back to the Communal Hut since everyone else is homeless, but when Gilligan sits on a hammock, everything falls down. The predicted storm soon hits the island with the communal hut just barely put up in time. Everyone is gathered in it to wait out the storm, even though no one can believe that the hut is still standing. When the Skipper thinks the storm is over, he heads out to inspect the island, but he falls into the lagoon in which the hut is now floating. The following day, now that the weather is clear again, everyone resumes making their own huts, and the Skipper again warns Gilligan about lending out their tools. Once he's gone, however, Ginger comes by charming Gilligan to the point where he gives her all the tools and follows her with the tool box for her."

The Skipper (Alan Hale Jr) explains to the castaways that they need to be careful around Gilligan while he's on guard duty because he shoots first then asks questions. All the castaways gather for the nightly flare launch. They hope that someone will see the flare and rescue them. After everyone else goes to bed Gilligan hears a rustling coming from a bush.

In the morning, Skipper and Gilligan prepare to start breakfast only to learn that the supply hut has been ransacked. Some of the supplies are gone. They quickly tell Professor (Russell Johnson), Mary Ann (Dawn Wells), and Ginger (Tina Louise) . Skipper and Professor go search the island for the thief. But the Skipper thinks the theft is a result of voodoo. He mentions witch doctors turning people into animals as an example.

Gilligan sets a trap for the thief but he sets it off himself when he accidentally steps into the noose. He's stuck hanging upside down. To be safe the Howells put bars on their windows leading Thurston to perspire for the first time. The Skipper then calls out to Gilligan because he stepped in the trap too.

That night Gilligan is on guard duty again. He hears a rustling in the bushes and goes looking to check on the supplies. While in the supply hut, he sees what he thinks to be a monster. Skipper and Professor check the hut and don't find anything or anyone. Skipper tells the Professor it's voodoo but the Professor, being a man of logic, doesn't believe it.

Professor and Gilligan are searching the island again. Professor tries to explain that there's a logical explanation for everything that's happened. They split up to search the island quicker. Gilligan falls into a mud hole and heads to the Lagoon to clean up. He takes off his clothes before he dips in the water and a chimp comes out of the bushes and grabs Gilligan's clothes.

The Skipper lights a fire to keep the bugs away and the Professor comes back from his search with nothing to report. Skipper asks about about Gilligan only to learn that the Professor thought that he was back at camp already. On his way to gather a search party, Skipper sees a chimp wearing Gilligan's clothes. Still thinking it's voodoo, he and the chimp have a heart to heart talk with the Skipper giving the chimp his hat. The chimp then runs off with it. Gilligan wearing a leaf skirt is trying to find his way back to camp. He stubs his foot on boxes of flares and cans of food. The chimp comes by wearing Skipper's hat, pointing the flare gun right at Gilligan. Because of the Skipper talking about voodoo, Gilligan thinks the chimp is the Skipper. The chimp runs off with Gilligan following. The real Skipper and Gilligan run into each other, rejoicing to see each other again.

Back at camp the chimp is waving the flare gun at the other castaways. Skipper and Gilligan arrive eager to tell the others that they found each other. Gilligan trades the chimp a banana for the flare gun, but Gilligan inadvertently shoots off a flare into the supply hut where the other flares are located. Gilligan runs into the hut to save the flares and there's a huge explosion. He comes out charred but otherwise fine."

He's acting like he's back in World War II. His yelling wakes Gilligan (Bob Denver) who follows him. Skipper is trying to convert a radio into a transmitter, but when the Skipper yells about dive bombers, Gilligan jumps into the Lagoon. The Skipper heads back to the hut, and Gilligan wakes the Skipper by dripping on him. Gilligan explains that the Skipper was sleepwalking, but he doesn't believe it, insisting that he was in the hammock all night. He suggests that Gilligan was really sleepwalking. The next morning, the Skipper and Professor (Russell Johnson) are listening to the radio when they hear about Alice McNeil (June Forray) flying around the world. According to the Skipper's calculations, she's going to be flying right over the island. He suggests building a big signal fire to catch the plane's attention, but he is concerned about cloud-cover blocking the view of the fire. Gilligan then mentions in passing the Skipper's sleepwalking episode where he turned the radio into a transmitter. It's then that the Skipper suddenly remembers and admits to Gilligan it was in his dream after all. He tries to go to sleep to regain the lost knowledge, but the Professor and Gilligan are staring at him. Gilligan stands guard to make sure that no one bothers him as Ginger (Tina Louise) and Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) sing a lullaby. The Skipper is almost asleep until Gilligan joins in the singing, his off-key crooning waking the Skipper. The Professor is soon listening to the radio trying to figure out where Alice McNeal is, but the Skipper still can't fall asleep. Gilligan goes and asks Mr. Howell (Jim Backus) and Mrs. Howell (Natalie Schafer) for some tranquilizers for the Skipper and puts a couple of pills into the Skipper's mango juice. Afterward, Mary Ann, Ginger and the Professor each put two pills into the juice to help the Skipper along, but while sitting at dinner, the Skipper won't drink his mango juice. He does find the pills hidden in the bananas and takes two, washing the pills down with mango juice thinking that they will help him go to sleep. He instead passes out. The Professor soon hears on the radio that Alice McNeil is an hour ahead of schedule, asking to talk with anyone who can receive her signal. The Skipper now comes sleepwalking out of the hut, and the Professor and Gilligan follow him back to the lagoon. Gilligan, however, gets knocked into the water and when he spits out the water in his mouth loudly, the Skipper wakes up. The Professor now resorts to hypnotizing the Skipper and uses the rest of the castaways as actors in his dream. He writes down everything the Skipper says in hopes he will get the information he needs to turn the radio into a transmitter. Afterwards Skipper, Professor, and Gilligan try to see if the transmitter works with failed results. As Gilligan fiddles with the transmitter while on guard duty, he actually talks with Alice McNeal and runs to get the Skipper to tell him the news, but the Skipper doesn't believe him. When Gilligan demonstrates how he hit the transmitter to get it to work again, all the wires and coils fall out of it. It is then that Alice flies overhead and calls thanks for the brief chat over the radio, announcing she's sorry they couldn't have talked longer. Eventually, the Skipper is able to asleep again, but Gilligan tries to quiet a bug and as it lands on the Skipper, he hits him on the head waking him."

Hearing them talk about him, Wrongway himself (Hans Conried) comes out of the bushes, confessing that he gave up fixing the plane after getting stranded, but the Professor says he'll try to fix it with parts left over from the Minnow. The Skipper (Alan Hale Jr) and Professor, meanwhile, work on the plane while Gilligan and Wrongway swap stories and history. When the Professor and Wrongway go to get some oil to remove the rust from a bolt, Gilligan goes to help the Skipper, but he just annoys him by taking the rear wheel off and allowing the plane leading to crush the Skipper's foot when he puts the plane down on top of it. That night, Ginger (Tina Louise) tries to charm Wrongway into taking her in the plane with him, but he resists. Mr. Howell (Jim Backus) also tries to bribe Wrongway for a spot on the plane, but Wrongway just shrugs him off to get some sleep. When the plane is ready to fly in the morning, Wrongway inspects it, but after he starts the engine, the propeller falls off when the plane tries to take off. He suspects someone on the island doesn't want to be rescued, but the Castaways scoff at the idea. Meanwhile, that night, a shadowy figure walks to the plane and sabotages a wing brace. The next day, Wrongway tries to take off again, but the brace breaks apart and he scuttles the flight. Realizing someone sabotaged the plane, the Skipper and Gilligan take turns standing guard by the plane with an arrow at night. The following morning, Gilligan discovers Wrongway is gone, and everyone searches for him. When Gilligan finds him at his old campsite, Wrongway confesses to being a coward and unwilling to fly again, even up to sabotaging his own plane. He confesses that he refuses to fly because he's lost his confidence but Gilligan suggests that Wrongway teach him to fly. Using a banana, pineapple, papaya, and a coconut as the controls, Wrongway tries teaching Gilligan how to fly the plane in secret at night, but Gilligan just keeps getting confused by his instructions. In the morning, Gilligan replaces the Professor on guard duty and gets ready to fly, but he just annoys Wrongway again by looking for fruit in the cockpit. When the other castaways hear the plane take off, they rush to see what's happening. They find Gilligan, who confesses that Wrongway took off in the plane. When he mentions his admiration for Wrongway, he also adds his admiration for the Skipper, which impresses him. A few days later while gathered around the radio, the Castaways hear that Wrongway made it to New York after 35 years after all. Unfortunately, even after mentioning the Castaways, it's revealed that Wrongway's directions are so far off course they won't be found any time soon."

The Skipper is calling for Gilligan repeatedly, but Mr. Howell (Jim Backus) discourages him from going. As a result, the Skipper argues with him over who's in charge of the Island. The Skipper believes he is since he was Captain of the S.S. Minnow, but Mr. Howell believes he is since he has the most money. Meanwhile, Ginger (Tina Louise) suggests a vote while the Professor tries to keep everything ethical. While Mr. Howell and the Skipper are preparing their speeches and trying to convince the others to vote for them. Mr. Howell offers Mary Ann a job and promises Ginger a big career in Hollywood. He even tries to promise Gilligan a job as Secretary of the Navy. When it's time for the castaways to vote, the ladies vote first, followed by everyone else, but when Gilligan enters the shower acting as a voting booth, he pulls the wrong cord dumping a bucket of water on him. Reading the drenched votes, the Professor reads the votes, revealing Mrs. Howell (Natalie Schafer) voted for Gilligan along with Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) and of course Gilligan who voted for himself, making himself the new President of the island. Taking the position way too seriously, the Skipper stops Gilligan from sweeping the hut claiming it's not a job for the president to do then warning him Gilligan about anyone seeking a high position in his administration. He declares himself Vice President, but Mr. Howell wants to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, revealing he discovered a plot to overthrow Gilligan he started himself after the election. At his inaugural dinner, Gilligan wants to discuss digging the well, but no one listens to him. Eventually, everyone leaves even though he's not even done talking. Later, in his office, with Mrs. Howell as his secretary, he finds himself bored and quickly realizes that everyone is using his new title to dump all the hard work on him. When he tries talking to the Skipper, he is kept distracted by moving boxes and Mr. Howell confuses him with nonsensical legal mumbo jumbo for why no work is getting done. Next he sees Ginger who's washing her hair. Forced to dig the well himself while everyone else is fighting, Gilligan angrily quits as president, throwing the shovel into the ground as water starts gushing, solving the water problem. That night, Gilligan is holding a cabinet meeting with everyone in attendance and suggests building a lookout tower to expedite their rescue, but he runs into the same problem as no one wants to actually work to build it."

She reveals that some sort of blight is going on, and that the Professor is doing what he can to stop it.

With all the food being rationed, Mr. Howell (Jim Backus) starts bribing people for their olives. The Professor soon comes back with evidence the blight has hit all the edible plants on the Island except for bushes full of berries the Professor believes could be poisonous. They soon see a migratory duck head for the lagoon. The Professor suggests that instead of eating it that they try tying a message to its leg to get rescued. They try various means to catch it, finally luring it in with Gilligan's old boot disguised as a decoy. Gilligan adopts and names the duck Everett, but everyone else wants to roast it as food. Meanwhile, Gilligan exercises Everett by letting him fly with a leash on him, but after sending him off with a message, Everett refuses to leave the island, landing again laying an egg. Gilligan renames him Emily (Mel Balanc), but after failed turns trying to send him off, everyone still wants to cook him as food.

Freeing Emily to keep her safe, Gilligan shoots it out with Mr. Howell and the Professor and drives them out of town, but when he fires his guns to celebrate, he accidentally takes out Emily. He wakes to find the Skipper coming for Emily. Gilligan still won't let him hurt her, so the Skipper leaves him with the hatchet and the choice to make for himself. Waiting at the table, everyone starts feeling guilty that they took Emily's life to save their own. Gilligan brings out a covered tray, but no one can bring themselves to eat. As they hear quacking, they realize Gilligan didn't kill her after all. He left her near the bushes of berries which she's now eating, proving they're not poisonous. With the means to survive the blight, they send Emily off after all, but Gilligan has forgot to attach the note. Everyone walks away in disgust as Gilligan holds out the note trying to lure Emily back."

The next morning, he and the Skipper test the glue and successfully use it to attach a board on the Minnow. They feel they can have the Minnow ready to set sail the following morning despite Gilligan and the Skipper getting themselves briefly covered in the glue and stuck to the hull of the Minnow.

On the island, Mr. Howell (Jim Backus) and the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr) feud over who will be the conductor, and Gilligan shows Mary (Dawn Wells) Ann how to use a saw and a screwdriver to make music.

The scout they captured meanwhile escapes and describes them back to the other natives. The Professor has by now realized the natives may be cannibals and that their primitive beliefs may be the way to scare them off the island. He may be able to scare them with radio, a plan that works well until Gilligan drops it and breaks it.

Howell then turns around and buys all the community vegetables from Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) for $16,000. Left without anything to tempt their turtle, they test a number of potential foodstuffs to tempt him, discovering he likes tree moss.

As the Professor and Skipper debate the legend, a tub of ice cream washes up into the Lagoon and turns out to be chocolate. Uncertain what to wish for next, Gilligan wanders the Island trying to decide, but the notion of the three wishes intrigues Ginger into trying to get him to share with her. Mr. Howell (Jim Backus) is also taken with the idea, and tricks Gilligan into losing it, but when it doesn't work for him, he seeks out Gilligan and throws it back at him, upset. When the Skipper says the stone will only work for Gilligan, Gilligan casually wishes for ice cream again. At that moment, Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) runs by with French vanilla ice cream that floated into the lagoon. Convinced that everyone is going to be rescued on the last wish, the Skipper rallies everyone together to leave the island.

Picard amuses himself that Data pretends to have a tell, but his real tell is that he doesn't have one. Picard admits he is lonely. Turns out Picard was dreaming, and he wakes up in his bed at home. His dog is named ""Number One"". His runs his own vineyard in France. Picard is looked after by Jaris (Orla Brady) and Zhaban (Jamie McShane), who are both Romulans.

In an interview, retired Starfleet Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) reveals that he resigned in protest after Starfleet abandoned plans to rescue Romulan citizens from a supernova when rogue synthetics attacked the rescue fleet. Romulans had asked for Federation help and Picard believed that it was their profound obligation to give it. Federation chose to support the rescue effort initially and Picard left the Enterprise to lead the rescue armada of 10,000 warp capable ferries to relocate 900 million Romulan citizens.

A group of rogue synthetics dropped the planetary defense shields around Mars and hacked Mars' own defense net, wiping out the rescue armada stationed there. The Utopia Planitia shipyard was destroyed, and the explosions ignited the flammable vapors in Martian stratosphere. Mars is on fire till this day. 92,143 lives were lost. Starfleet banned the creation of synthetics after the attack. It is still not clear why synthetics went rouge and did what they did. Data was a synthetic, but Picard never lost faith in him. Picard resigned as it was no longer Starfleet. The Galaxy was mourning and Starfleet slunk from its duties. It was criminal to abandon the Romulans to their fate.

Romulan assassins attack a young woman named Dahj (Isa Briones) and kill her partner. She was just selected as a fellow to the Daystrom institute on Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Consciousness. This triggers something in Dahj, and she is able to kill the assassins.

Experiencing visions of Picard and seeing his interview, Dahj seeks him out. Picard does not recognize Dahj. Dahj recounts the attack on her, but doesn't know who attacked her. Jaris treats Dahj's wounds. Dahj says that she feels safe with Picard. The next morning, Dahj leaves without informing Picard. After meeting her, Picard visits Starfleet Archives and finds a painting that features a figure who resembles Dahj. Entitled ""Daughter"", the painting was given to Picard by his android former lieutenant commander Data (Brent Spiner). It was one from a set of two similar paintings that Data created.

Dahj calls her mother (Sumalee Montano) who tells her to go back to Picard. Dahj quickly hacks into various programs to find Picard in real time. Picard tells Dahj how Data was his friend, and sacrificed his life for Picard over 2 decades ago. Picard tells Dahj that Data painted her as she is now, but more than 30 years ago. He named the painting ""daughter"". Picard says that Dahj is a synthetic and that the attack on her, ""activated"" her.

More Romulan assassins attack Picard and Dahj, and Dahj is killed. Laris brings Picard back home. She says that Picard was alone when he was found, and the security feed also didn't have anyone with Picard. Picard meets with Dr. Agnes Jurati (Alison Pill) at the Daystrom Institute, who explains that Dahj could be Data's daughter due to an experimental procedure known as fractal Neuronic cloning, which results in twin androids with organic bodies. After Data's death, Bruce Maddox (John Ales) continued the work on creating a sentient Synthetic. But due to the Mars incident, the Synthetic were banned and Maddox could never complete his work. It is still not possible to create a sentient synthetic without a copy of Data's Positronic neural net. Fractal Neuronic cloning was Maddox's idea. A copy of the entire neural net could be possible with a single Neuron. Maddox somehow achieved fractal Neuronic cloning and fashion the organic bodies using Data's old painting.

Meanwhile, Dahj's twin, Soji Asha (Isa Briones), is working in a Borg Cube that has been reclaimed by Romulan refugees. Soji meets Narek (Harry Treadaway), who says he had a brother whom he lost a year earlier."

The synthetics were deeply involved in running the mundane operations on the shipyard. F8 was one such synthetic. All of a sudden, something changes and the F8 brings down planetary defense shields on Mars. F8 kills all of its human supervisors. Satellites and autonomous spaceships in orbit around Mars start their attack. As the stratosphere ignites, F8 proceeds to kill itself.

Hoping to find Soji before the assassins get to her, Picard investigates Dahj's apartment with his Romulan employee Laris. The latter believes the assassins may be members of the Zhat Vash, a secretive organization with a deep-rooted hatred of synthetics. Zhat Vash are the keepers of secrets. Rumors suggest that the Zhat Vash are keeping a secret so terrible that even learning it could break a person's mind. Their reason for the loathing of any form of synthetic life, is the secret. Laris helps Picard discover Soji's location from Dahj's computer. Liras ascertains that Soji's messages to Dahj came from off world subspace relays. Soji is not on Earth.

On the Borg Cube, called the ""Artifact"", Soji develops a relationship with Romulan agent Narek while she works on a project to remove Borg technology from former Borg drones. Soji thinks that the Romulans are profiting from the sale of Borg Technology on the black market. The Artifact is severed from the collective. It is broken and lost. Narek is very secretive with Soji and doesn't reveal anything about himself.

Despite the onset of a terminal illness, Picard asks Starfleet Admiral Kirsten Clancy for a ship and crew to find Soji. Picard says that Maddox is using neurons from Data to create a new line of organic synthetics. Romulans are involved as well. And if some part of Data exists, Picard wants to retrieve it before it is lost. She refuses him and says that everyone saw Picard's interview where he blamed Starfleet. Romulans were the enemies and Starfleet tried to help them as long as they could. Even before the synthetics attacked, 14 allies had asked the Federation to cut the Romulans loose or loose the Federation. The Federation didn't have enough ships left and had to make choices, but Captain Picard did not like his orders. Picard warns of an oncoming calamity, but Kirsten says Picard is delusional and is desperate to matter again.

Kirsten refers the incident to Starfleet's security chief Commodore Oh (Tamlyn Tomita), who discusses it with a lieutenant; this is Narek's sister Narissa (Peyton List) in disguise. Commodore Oh is also Romulan. Kirsten tells Oh that Picard suspected clandestine Romulan synthetic operations on Earth. Narissa led the assassins to kill Dahj while Narek is approaching his target, Soji, with seduction rather than violence. Oh chastises Narissa for her mistakes that led to Picard's meeting with Kirsten. Oh tells Narissa not to focus on Picard and stay on mission. Mission was to capture Dahj alive for interrogation and then only have one more chance. Narissa almost blew their cover. Oh wants Narissa to make sure that she and Narek capture Soji. Narrisa and Narek want to find out the location of the ""nest"" and its fellow synthetics from Soji.

Agnes Jurati says that Dahj's entire history was fictional and was created all at once around 3 years ago. Bruce Maddox did have the ability to create an entirely new and plausible, credible identity, but then so did others. Picard decides to find and save Soji himself and begins to assemble a new crew, starting with his former Starfleet first officer Raffi Musiker (Michelle Hurd). Laris and Zahban are worried for Picard's security and warn him against the Zhat Vash. Picard narrates the events to Raffi at her house in the desert."

Picard argued at Starfleet that the evacuation of Romulan citizens could continue by using reserve duty officers and the mothballed ships. Their plan included the use of synthetic labor, but Starfleet banned all synthetic life forms all through the Federation. All active units dismantled, and all research halted. Starfleet rules that it was a fatal code error in Synthetics programming. Back then Raffi suspected the involvement of the Tal Shiar, the parent organization of the Zhat Vash. Starfleet cannot fathom that Romulans would attack a fleet built to rescue them. Starfleet is reacting and as a result billions of life forms will perish in the blast radius of the Super Nova.

When Picard resigned following the synth attack on Mars, Starfleet fired Raffi. Picard never though Starfleet would accept his resignation. Now she resents him for that, and for not helping her in the subsequent years, and refuses to join him. She also says that Picard telling his entire plan to Kirsten Clancy was a mistake. She says that she has evidence that a high-ranking Starfleet officer allowed the Mars attack to go forward. Romulans and Starfleet conspired to end the rescue mission. However, she does find him a freelance pilot named Rios (Santiago Cabrera). Picard sends Raffi everything Daystrom had on Bruce Maddox. He wants her to study the evidence and figure out patterns and links.

Picard meets Rios on his ship. Rios is Starfleet to the core, but has a hint of resentment towards the same organization.

On the Artifact, the reclamation project's director, the former Borg drone Hugh (Jonathan Del Arco), allows Soji to interview a Romulan named Ramdha (Rebecca Wisocky) that has been reclaimed from the Borg. Ramdha says that she remembers Soji from ""Tomorrow"". Ramdha was crew of the very last ship ever assimilated by the captured Borg cube. Soji wants to know what happened which caused the sub-matrix collapse and the severed link to the collective. Ramdha wants to know which sister is Soji, the one who died, or the one who lived. Ramdha declares Soji to be ""the destroyer"" and tries to kill herself, but Soji unknowingly uses her enhanced speed to stop this from happening. Narissa gets to the Borg ship physically & warns Narek not to get emotionally attached to Soji.

The information on Ramdha's capture by the Borg was classified and it is not clear to Hugh or Narek, how Soji had knowledge of it when she met Ramdha. Narek tells Narissa that Soji has no idea who she is.

Oh approaches Dr. Jurati, who reveals her discussion with Picard. Shortly after this, Picard is attacked by Zhat Vash operatives. Jurati helps kill all of them but one, who also calls Soji ""the destroyer"" before committing suicide. Picard believes that Oh is a Vulcan, he is not aware of her Romulan ancestry.

Picard agrees to take Jurati on his mission to find Soji, and the pair transport aboard Rios's ship La Sirena. There they are also joined by Raffi, who believes that Soji's creator Bruce Maddox is on the planet Freecloud and will travel with them that far.

Picard had befriended a young boy named Elnor (Evan Evagora) and promised to return for him, but abandoned the boy after he resigned from Starfleet. Elnor was then raised by the Qowat Milat, warrior nuns who have sworn an oath of absolute candor. This mean total communication of emotions, without any filter between thought and word.

Raffi is not in favor of going to Vashti, and neither is Rios. Rios says that there is a power vacuum in the entire Qiris sector. Smugglers & warlords run the show, led by Kar Kantar. Kar Kantar even has a Romulan Bird of Prey at his command. Vashti is also the hotbed of the Romulan rebirth movement. Picard says that Elnor is a trained assassin, and they need him on their team. But they are not for hire, the Qowat Milat have to chose you. The Qowat Milat are the most feared enemies of the Tal Shiar.

Now 14 years later, Picard has returned to Vashti to meet Elnor. This was his only chance to meet Elnor as he may never pass this way again in his life. Vashti has a planetary defense shield around it. Romulans refuse entry to Picard and his ship and they have to bribe their way through. As soon as Picard beams down, he is identified by the local Romulans.

Picard asks Elnor to join his quest; He explains to the Qowat Milat, & their leader Zani, that the quest he faces is dangerous and Elnor might even die. But the Qowat Milat is a woman's organization and Elnor was trained here as there was no other option for him when the evacuation was abandoned. Elnor needs a new home. Elnor initially refuses, but changes his mind when Picard is attacked by Romulans who resent Starfleet for abandoning the evacuation effort.

Picard and Elnor beam up to La Sirena, where Rios and Raffi are fighting with a local warlord Kar Kantar. A mystery ship helps La Sirena win the battle but is damaged in the process. They beam the pilot, former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan), to La Sirena. Picard tells Elnor not to pick up unnecessary fights and only fight when the cause is just.

On the Artifact, Soji tries to learn more about the Romulans that were assimilated by the Artifact and their prophesied ""destroyer"". Legend says that Ganmadan is the Day of Annihilation. On the day all demons rise up and answer the call of the Destroyer. Soji suspects that Narek is the Tal Shiar. Soji wants to know what happened to Ramdha's ship after it was assimilated by the Borg. Narek offers to get her information on the Romulans by hacking into the Borg databases, but the pair have a falling out when he expresses doubt about Soji's past. Narek says that Terran passenger manifests are part of public record. But there is no record of Soji being on a particular ship Ellison that she claimed to be on, when she shipped out of the Beat Quadrant in 2396.

Narissa gives Narek one week to get information on other synths from Soji. Narek says that if he presses Soji too hard, it might activate her. Narissa reminds Narek that Soji is the Destroyer."

Icheb was in a lot of pain by the time Seven of Nine reached him, and Icheb begged her to put him out of his misery.

Seven is part of the Fenris Rangers, who still try to maintain law and order in the furthest outreaches of the galaxy. She does this without any support from Starfleet, but refuses to give up. Rios and Raffi realize that both Picard & Seven used to be Borg.

Jurati watches old videos of her and Maddox together. They used to be in a relationship.

Now, Seven travels with La Sirena to Freecloud, where Raffi learns that Bjayzl has Maddox captive and intends to sell him to the Romulans. Maddox suspected that the Tal Shiar was after him. Now Bjayzl is trying to broker a deal to sell Maddox to the Tal Shiar. It is not possible to outbid the Tal Shiar and Bjayzl is surrounded by top notch private security contractors.

Seven proposes to barter herself to Bjazyl in exchange for Maddox. She says she is doing this to maintain a semblance of order in Romulan society, ever since the Neutral zone collapsed. Rios beams down to the surface to act as a broker for the Tal Shiar. He is screened by Bjazyl's Beta Annari Mr Vup. The Beta Annari can smell if one if telling a lie. Rios then tells Vup that he is proposing a barter of his own, by offering a Romulan with many Borg implants, in exchange for Maddox. Rios suggests basically cutting the Tal Shiar out of the deal. Vup is agreeable as those many working Borg implants are worth a lot on the black market.

To free Maddox, Picard's crew stage a prisoner exchange with Seven as the bait. Picard pushes Vup that he needs to see Maddox alive, before he agrees to the exchange. Meanwhile, Raffi unsuccessfully tries to reconnect with her estranged son Gabriel before returning to La Sirena. Gabriel is married and has a daughter on the way. Gabriel says he will never forgive Raffi for abandoning him and his father, which she did to pursue the synthetics attack conspiracy on Mars. Raffi argues that the conspiracy is real and its bigger than what anybody realizes. But Gabriel cannot bring himself to forgive her. Raffi goes back to the ship.

When Bjayzl recognizes Seven (she calls her Annika), the latter drops the charade and reveals her true intention: to kill Bjayzl and avenge Icheb. Picard convinces Seven not to seek revenge and Rios tells Seven that if she kills Bjayzl she will effectively put a bounty on the entire crew. Bjayzl offers Maddox in exchange for her life. Maddox is safely beamed to La Sirena.

Later, Seven returns to Freecloud and kills Bjayzl without Picard's knowledge. In the La Sirena sickbay, Maddox tells Picard that he sent Soji and Dahj to the Artifact and Earth, respectively, in order to discover the true motivation behind the Starfleet synthetic ban. Maddox believes that the Federation are also involved on covering up the truth. The Artifact is in Romulan space.

Once left alone by Picard, Jurati confronts Maddox and discusses the fact that they used to secretly be in a relationship together. Jurati then murders Maddox and says that she wishes she didn't know what she now knows."

In the dream Soji is a little girl, who enters a lab decorated with Orchids. A person is working at the console, but his face is not visible. Sojis is discovered and then she wakes up. Narek knows that Soji speaks to her mother every night. Narissa says that Soji's dreams are a malfunction, a bug. But Narek is convinced that they have been programmed in deliberately. Narek says that Soji's dreams can be a vulnerability in her system. Maybe her dreams can allow Narek to access her internal sub-systems and memories without triggering her self-defense capabilities. Narek can access the location of her home world.

Soji says that she often falls asleep while talking to her mother. Narek tells Soji each call to her mother lasts for 70 seconds exactly. Each call, every day. Doubts start creeping up in Soji's mind. Soji calls her mother, who says her father is working in the lab.

Struggling with the guilt of murdering Maddox, Jurati has sex with Rios. Picard is not looking forward to visiting a Borg cube again. Picard says that the Borg never change, they only adapt to their situation. The ship approaches Romulan territory.

To board the Artifact without causing a diplomatic incident with the Romulans, Picard asks Raffi to procure official clearance from the Federation. The Artifact is under the Borg Reclamation Project, in treaty with the Federation, so if Picard can get Federation diplomatic credentials, the Romulans would be forced to let him meet the director of the Project, Hugh. Raffi, drunk and high following her son's rejection, convinces an old Starfleet acquaintance to provide the clearance. This allows Picard to beam aboard the Artifact. Picard tells Elnor specifically not to beam aboard the Borg ship.

As Picard beams aboard, the dormant Borg sense his presence and get activated. But this time, the Borg only help to save Picard from falling inside the Borg ship. Picard meets Hugh, who gives him a tour of the ship. Hugh tells Picard that the former Borgs are called XBs. Picard says that he wants to meet Soji. Hugh knows Soji and also knows that Narek is a Romulan spy. Hugh knows Soji is in danger. Picard sees that Romulans have perfected the science of undoing a Borg assimilation. Hugh says that now the Borg Queen is a Romulan.

Meanwhile Raffi realizes that the Tal Shiar has kept Soji alive for a reason.

Due to Narek's manipulation, Soji begins to discover that her identity was recently manufactured. Soji scans all her stuff and realizes that all of her physical belongings were created 37 months ago. This includes her childhood stuffed toys, her school drawings, her photos, everything

Narek guides her through the Romulan meditation practice of Zhal Makh to explore her dreams: she is able to identify clues hinting at the place she was created (she sees 2 moon, dark as blood and with lots of lightening). Narek also tells Soji that his true name is Hrai Yan. Soi continues her dreams beyond the point where she wakes up. She still cannot see her father's face, but she can see that her father is working on a model of Soji. Soji is a doll and in pieces. Narek tells Soji that she is not real and attempts to poison her with radiation. This activates her self-defense mechanism which allows her to escape by digging a hole through the floor of the chamber where Narek had imprisoned her.

While escaping, Soji runs into Picard, and Hugh helps them transport to the nearby planet Nepenthe. Before beaming off, Picard gives his destination to Rios and Raffi.

Raffi can see that Picard is in serious trouble on board the Artifact. Elnor beams aboard the Artifact to help Hugh cover their tracks and from preventing the Tal Shiar from tracking their location."

Oh shows Jurati that Synthetics will eventually lead to a total destruction of the planet Earth, along with many other planets and extinction of several life forms. Jurati agrees to help destroy Soji and ingested a tracking device.

The La Sirena is locked in a Borg tractor beam from the Artifact and is unable to warp out. Jurati says that the Romulans don't want them, they are after Soji and Picard. Jurati tells Raffi to just ask the Romulans to let them go and tell them that they want to return to their home world.

Narek now uses Jurati's injected tracking device to track La Sirena. Narissa releases Rios's ship when Narek is ready to track them in his own. Rios knows that a ship is tracking them, but no matter what he does, he cannot shake the pursuing ship. Rios believes that Raffi is being tracked and shares his concerns with Jurati. A guilt-ridden Jurati takes an injection that places her in a coma and stops the tracking.

Narrisa wanted to know where Hugh had beamed Picard and Soji, but Hugh won't betray them. Narissa kills all of Hugh's reclaimed XBs. Elnor finds Hugh and together they go back to the Queencell on the Artifact. Hugh wants to take the Artifact back from the Romulans and use it to protect the XBs. Elnor's attempts to protect Hugh on the Artifact are unsuccessful when Narissa fatally wounds Hugh. Hugh tells Elnor that to activate the Queencell, he will need an XB. Before dying, Hugh gives Elnor a device to signal Seven of Nine's vigilante group, the Fenris Rangers.

On Nepenthe, Picard reunites with his old friends and colleagues William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), whose son Thad died after the medical procedure he required was banned as part of the synthetic ban. Thad had a silicon-based virus, and it was completely curable. The active cells had to be cultured in a Positronic matrix to develop an anti-virus. But by the time Thad was infected, there were no Positronic matrices left. No one was allowed to develop new ones.

Riker, Troi, and their daughter Kestra give shelter to Picard and Soji until La Sirena arrives. Picard tells Kestra that Soji is Data's daughter and Kestra casually remarks that then Soji is an android, which comes as a complete shock to Soji. Picard tells Soji that Dahj is dead and was murdered. Soji doubts how Data could be her father if she was created only 3 years ago.

Troi and Riker can see Soji's pain following Narek's betrayal, and help Picard begin to earn her trust. Riker tells Picard that he is dealing with a teenager, and he will have to work very differently to get her to trust him. Soji tells Troi that they way Troi is being all sensitive and caring towards her, makes her trust Troi even less. Soji definitely does not trust Picard. Picard tells Soji that she was created from a remnant of Data, who was a dear friend to them all. Plus, having Soji in his life means that his life again has a mission and a purpose. Soji can monitor all of Picard's vital life signs and believes that he is telling the truth.

The family also try to help Soji come to terms with being an android and are able to help identify the location from her dream. Soji tells the group about her vision of the 2 blood red moons and the lightening. Riker speculates that Maddox found this planet and resumed his work to create synthetic life forms. There might be many more there. The Romulans already have a head start. Kestra says that the planet is in the Gulion system in the Vayt sector. The planet doesn't have a name, only a number.

Rios reaches Nepenthe and picks up Picard and Soji."

During their exploration, they came upon an uncharted system with eight stars. They found a storehouse of preserved memories. They saw the grim fate of the civilization that perished on the planet long ago. The Romulans called it the Admonition. The fore mothers found the Admonition. They formed the Zhat Vash of which Ramdha, Oh & Narissa were a part. The Admonition warned off annihilation from the skies.

For hundreds of years, the Zhat Vash worked to prevent a second coming of the Destroyers. As part of their joining ritual, every Zhat Vash must endure the Admonition, and many of them commit suicide after that. Only a few can endure and remain sane. Only Narissa and Oh could endure. Ramdha goes insane but is saved by Narissa. Oh asks Narissa to start her work to stop the synthetics from Mars. When the Borg assimilated the Tal Shair ship with Ramdha on it, she broke it the entire ship with the sheer force of her despair.

Narissa has already dispatched a fleet to the synthetics home world.

Picard and Soji beam aboard La Sirena, and Rios has a panic attack when he sees Soji. Picard asks Rios to take the ship to the nearest star base Deep Space 12. Picard tells Soji that they cannot face the Romulans without help from Starfleet. Raffi finds out that Jurati had a tracking isotope in her blood, and she believes Jurati killed Maddox. Raffi doesn't trust Soji either.

When Jurati wakes up she offers to turn herself over to Starfleet. Jurati says that she saw hell in the mind meld with Oh and now he thinks of committing suicide every day. The hell in Oh's mind meld was thousands of centuries old, but now humans are at the same threshold. Unless the synthetics are destroyed, the current Galaxy and all of the current life forms are headed for the same hell. The hell will come with the appearance of the Destroyer, Soji. After meeting Soji she chooses not to harm her.

Picard presents his report to Kirsten Clancy, who agrees to Picard's findings and sends a Starfleet squadron to meet him at Deep Space 12. Clancy agrees that the synthetics need to be protected from the Romulans. Raffi tells Rios that on the Cube she saw Romulans drawing a picture with eight circles, over and over. Rios speculates that this could be a system with 8 stars, while Raffi thought this referred to the council of eight, who planned the attack on Mars. Raffi now realizes that the drawing refers to place where the council met.

Rios tells Raffi about his Starfleet captain on the ship Ibn Majid, who murdered two people on Starfleet's orders before committing suicide. The Starfleet had promised destruction of the Ibn Majid and all its crew, if their orders were not carried out. One of them was named Jana. Rios beamed the bodies out of the ship and deleted the logs. 6 months later he was discharged from Starfleet. Jana was a splitting image of Soji. Oh gave the order to kill Jana.

The chances of a Octonary star system (with 8 stars) occurring naturally are close to zero, so it would have to be built. One would have to capture eight stars and move them light years and set them into motion. It would only be done if you had something important to say, and you wanted to make sure that people paid attention.

Raffi also pieces together that the Romulans discovered a warning from a past civilization (who lived 200,000 to 300,000 years ago) about the horrors of evolved synthetic life. The civilization dragged 8 stars into a system and placed a planet in the middle of it. On the planet they placed the warning, the Admonition. When the synthetics cross an evolution threshold, somebody really bad shows up. Romulans took the Admonition seriously and created the Zhat Vash to terminate all synthetic life. 30-40 years ago Dr Noonien Soong created Data. The Zhat Vash sent the half-Romulan Oh to infiltrate Starfleet and instigate the Mars attack as part of their anti-synthetic plan. Romulans engineered the attack the Mars to place a ban on all synthetics.

9 years ago, the people Rios's captain murdered were synthetics from Soji's home world, and one of them, Jana, looked just like her. This is the world where Bruce Maddox created an entire society of synthetics, hidden from Federation eyes. The Zhat Vash have been searching for this world ever since.

Hearing this activates memories for Soji and she plots a course for her home, still followed by Narek. Soji has knowledge of the Borg's Transwarp conduit networks. A short cut through space.

On the Artifact, Seven of Nine arrives to help Elnor fight the Romulans. She connects with the Cube and reactivates the Queencell. She also activates the Borg drones that are in stasis on the Artifact, but the Romulans kill all of the drones by releasing them into space. The Romulans then abandon the Artifact and prepare to invade the synthetic home world. Narissa is captured by the XBs before she can escape the Artifact."

La Sirena never went to Deep Space 12 as planned. They traveled 25 light years in 15 minutes. Narek arrives and attacks but is interrupted when the Artifact follows them through the Transwarp conduit as well. A planetary defense system in the form of giant orchids engulf the spaceships and drags the three ships to the planet's surface. Picard requires medical attention following the crash.

Jurati discovers his terminal illness while scanning Picard with a Tricorder, and Picard reveals it to the rest of the crew. Before crashing the La Sirena found a settlement about 5-6 kilometers away from their present location. Soji says that it is Coppelius station and that she was born there.

After finding Elnor and Seven alive in the wreckage of the Artifact, the crew travels to the settlement where Dahj and Soji were created. They also activate the Artifact and its long-range scanners to find a fleet of 218 Romulan war-birds coming towards Coppelius. Elnor and Seven stay back on the Artifact to bring its defensive systems back online for the oncoming battle with the Romulans.

They find Maddox's science partner (and the son of Data's creator Noonien Soong) Altan Inigo Soong (Brent Spiner) with a colony of synthetics, including Jana's twin Sutra (Isa Briones). The planet only had 15 orchids to defend them, but now only has 10 left. Not nearly enough to repel the Romulan attack. Romulans will arrives in 2 days' time.

Sutra always had a passion for Vulcan culture. Sutra uses a mind meld to see the vision Oh showed Jurati and believes that it is a message to synthetic life from higher beings. Sutra believes that the Romulans may have been driving themselves insane for centuries, over something that wasn't meant for consumption by the Organic mind at all.

The message says that Organics yearn for perfection which results in the creation of Synthetic life. But then the Organic perceive the Synthetics as a threat since the Synthetics do not age or die. Organics will seek to destroy the Synthetics and in so doing, destroy themselves. The higher beings are an alliance of Synthetic life, waiting for a signal. The higher beings, when summoned, will offer their protection to the Synthetics. The Synthetics evolution will be the extinction of the Organics. The Romulan suspicions are confirmed.

Altan shows Jurati that he made a Golem body but hasn't figured out how to transfer someone's consciousness into it. Maddox was the substrates man.

Sutra tells Soji that there is no point in running from the Romulans. Soji says that the battle will cost many lives and there has to be an alternative. Picard calls Starfleet and reports first contact with the Synthetics on Ghulion IV. He asks for protection from an incoming Romulan attack.

Narek is held prisoner by the Synthetics. Narek again tries to manipulate Soji by saying that he loves her. But this time Soji takes no pity on him. But later, Sutra stops by and helps Narek escape with a mission of her own. Narek heads to the Artifact.

Soong, Soji, and the other synthetics support Sutra's plan to call these higher beings before the Romulans arrive. The Admonition had the subspace frequencies required to contact them. Soong and Sutra have created a beacon for sending the signal. Soong and Sutra argue that Organics will also treat Synthetics as a threat. Peace is not possible. The higher beings will eliminate all organic life forms and eliminate the threat of extermination for the Synthetics. Picard disagrees and is taken prisoner. Picard says that Soji became the Destroyer after all. Jurati promises to support the Synthetics."

Narek had been instructed to destroy the planetary defense orchids, so that the Romulans can attack without any obstruction, and this would give a clear reason to the Synthetics to activate the beacon.

Rios and Raffi are on the La Sirena. They are trying to fix the ship with a mysterious tool given to them by the Synthetics. The tool works on imagination. One imagines the fix needed and the tool makes it happen. The ship powers up. Narek reaches the La Sirena and is followed by Elnor who tracked him from the Artifact. He convinces Raffi, Rios, and Elnor to help him destroy the synthetics' beacon. He says the Synthetic higher beings will destroy all organic life in the known Galaxy.

Narek narrates the story of Romulan history of Ganmadan. The story began in the distant past, with some Romulans believing it occurred before their ancestors arrived at Vulcan, with a pair of Khalagu, the twin sisters Seb-Cheneb (The Destroyer) and Seb-Natan (The Foreteller). After the death of Seb-Natan from a burst heart while playing her drum, Seb-Cheneb blew the horn of a pale Ganmadan, summoning the Ch'Khalagus (demons) who brought about the Thousand Days of Pain. Narek, believed the story was not a prophecy. He believed it was history and that it could happen again.

Jurati works with Soong to complete Maddox's work on downloading a person's consciousness into a Golem body The Romulan fleet is led by Commodore Oh. Rios, Raffi, and Elnor pretend to hold Narek prisoner as they walk into the Synthetics settlement where the transmitter is being built. Their plan is to destroy the transmitter with molecular grenades.

Jurati frees Picard and the pair escape to La Sirena, which Picard flies to confront and stall the Romulans. Oh orders the fleet to sterilize the entire planet, but the Orchids rise to engage the Romulan fleet and to distract them for a few minutes. Narissa targets La Sirena with the Artifacts' defenses but is stopped and killed by Seven of Nine.

Soong discovers that Sutra worked with Narek to convince the other synthetics to agree with her plan, and he incapacitates her. But there isn't enough time for Soong to explain his reasons to Soji. Soji believes that Soong is a human and hence trying to protect his kind. Soji foils the attempt to destroy the beacon and activates it.

Picard calls Soji to reconsider her decision. Picard tells Soji that he will sacrifice his own life to change her mind. Meanwhile Jurati uses the Synthetics tool on board the La Sirena to fashion an image multiplier that gives the impression that the planet is defended by an entire fleet and not a single ship. Picard begins to succumb to his illness, but Jurati prolongs his life long enough for him to distract the Romulans until a Starfleet armada arrives in support, led by Riker.

Picard again speaks to Soji and asks her to prove everyone wrong. She is not the Destroyer. Picard says that the Federation trusts her to make the right choice. This gives Soji the choice to turn the beacon off herself, which she does, and the Romulans retreat.

Picard dies after Jurati and Soong transfer his consciousness into a device holding Maddox's copy of Data's consciousness. There, Picard once again ""meets"" Data and Picard realizes that Data sacrificed his life to save Picard and was happy to do so. Data asks Picard to erase his consciousness when he awakens in the real world. Data says that mortality gives meaning to human life and that however briefly, he wanted to live like a mortal. Picard says goodbye to Data before awaking in a synthetic ""Golem"" body. Picard keeps his promise to Data and deactivates Maddox's copy of Data's consciousness.

After the Federation lifts the ban on synthetics, Picard and Soji set off in La Sirena with Rios, Raffi, Jurati, Elnor, and Seven of Nine."

Archie;"" I think your dead from the neck up.""

A package arrives, and Archie opens it, it's a box of expensive Cigars, while Archie is happily examining the Cigars another Package arrives, its an expensive gift package, that includes Caviar and expensive Cheeses, It's from the richest person Archie Knows, an old Army buddy, worth Five Million dollars. The Fabulous Eddie Frasier. Archie is impressed by what Eddie has made of himself, he is kind of like Archie's Idol, if not Hero. the phone rings and its Eddie Frasier himself, Archie is delighted to hear from him, Eddie wants to set up a Army reunion at the Bunker household for the next night. Billy Pendergast, The Fugue Twins, and the unspeakable Eddie frasier. The next night Eddie is the last to arrive but he is soon the life of the party showing the kind of personality and dash that made him the most successful Used Car dealer west of the Mississsippi. Mike for one is not impressed, the man may be Rich but he doesn't seem interested in anything but Material possessions and really has nothing to say, and seems a bit phony as if he is trying too hard to prove that he is happy and on top of the World, plus he seems to be drinking some form of Alcohol at every turn, while the rest just seem to be nursing their drinks, still Archie is Star-struck. While the Party is going on Eddie receives a phone call, that Mike happens to overhear, Eddie is begging his Son to see him, even offering him 500 dollars to meet for five minutes, he is practically crying, Billy notices this and points it out to Archie, who scoffs at this, "" Crying, he is crying all the way to the bank with 60 million bucks."" it's interesting that every time Archie mentions Eddies worth , the number keeps escalating, it started with five million and now its 60 million. when he hangs up, he looks at Mike he must be the same age as his estranged Son. Eddie: "" That boy can have anything he wants."" Mike: "" Whats does he want from you. Eddie; dropping his facade, "" He wants me to stay the hell away from him."" Eddie at this point looks totally distraught and out of answers, he seems to be questioning his own success. Archie and his army buddies, begin singing 'For he's a jolly good fella."" when they get to the part in the song, where they say 'that nobody can deny' Mike looks on sadly."

We see the countdown to their recorded time of death, then they writhe in pain, and resume their lives.

The first is Marcy, a woman with a head trauma, causing a speech impediment and severe loss of mental functioning. She works as a cleaning lady at the library, and uses her spare time to learn how to read children's picture books. Helplessly making noises to stop an attack on another woman, she herself is attacked by 4 men. We see the countdown to her death, then she is okay. She easily defends herself against the 4 men, who run off, defeated. Notably, her speech impediment is gone.

The second is Trevor, a high school student fighting in a mixed martial arts match. After the countdown to his death, Trevor quickly concedes the fight, and we are later told that, if he had not, he would certainly have died that night.

The third individual is Phillip, a drug addict. His friend lies dead nearby, but he bypasses his own death and leaves.

Next, Carly is brutality knocked to the ground by her husband, with their infant child nearby. While she should have died, she gets up and orders her husband to leave.

Most of the show introduces us to the lives of the 5 characters. At various points, we see each of the first 4 characters accessing Internet messages about ""travelers,"" specifically about the pending arrival of a traveler. Carly cryptically refers to this traveler as ""daddy"" when speaking to her baby. Tipped off by his partner, FBI Agent MacLaren reads and follows up on the messages, which we are told were on the Deep Web.

Trevor is on schedule to earn a football scholarship, which he carelessly put at risk through his fight. His father shows serious disappointment in his actions (which apparently he thinks was a street fight), while his mother tries to show understanding. He asks his loving girlfriend and his best friend to be understanding, as his concussion has resulted in temporary memory loss.

Carly continues to care for her baby, while enforcing strict rules with her husband, Jeff, who turns out to be a police officer. At one point, she has to defend herself through serious physical action, quickly subduing Jeff.

Phillip is interrogated by a police officer who has been tracking his criminal behavior. The officer questions him about his friend's death and his lack of action.

After being released, Phillip makes $92,000 by playing the lottery through his attorney, while providing his lawyer with winning tips as incentive. When his attorney asks how he can win like this, he says he's from the future. His attorney assumes that this apparent lie means that he doesn't want to reveal his secret. When the police officer asks him what he's going to use the money for (since he claims it's not for drugs), Phillip replies (truthfully) that it's to finance a secret hideout. The officer likewise assumes he's just joking.

When the arresting officer later chases after Phillip, he suffers a heart attack, but Phillip must turn down his request to call 911, although he is clearly remorseful. He indicates that he can't change history, and gives us a clue as to what is going on. He mentions that the officer was considered as a host, since it was known that he was going to die. At this time we realize why he also didn't call 911 when his friend died.

When Marcy's social worker, David, comes to her apartment, Marcy acts odd, but it takes a while for him to realize that she now speaks normally and can read fluently. Marcy (or rather, the woman who is using Marcy as a host) is unaware of this transformation, and can't offer an explanation, even when David consults another professional about her apparent miraculous transformation. His contact only offers one explanation: Marcy has been playing him and defrauding the system. Marcy has to escape from a forced hospitalization, and shows up at David's apartment to use his computer. David tries to be understanding, but all Marcy tells him is that she's working on something ""important.""

FBI Agent MacLaren spends most of the first episode tracking down the messages about ""travelers."" He knows that they will be meeting in an abandoned building that night. One by one he tracks them down, speaking to Trevor's parents, Phillip's arresting officer, Carly, and Marcy's social worker. The whole process seems all too easy, and we can conclude by the end of the episode that they actually fed him the information, so that he could go to the building.

That night, when he arrives alone at the abandoned building to stop their activity, we discover that he would have fallen down the elevator shaft that night, during the sudden blackout. The others explain that they are from an apocalyptic future, and thousands have come back to save the future. They occupy bodies from the present that would have died anyway. They even explain that MacLaren would soon die. However, they stop MacLaren from falling, and his body is then occupied by what turns out to be the leader of the 5."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0619780/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,World-saving cheerleader Kim Possible can do anything! ...Except ask Josh Mankey to the school dance.,[],TV-G,Release date,['Chris Bailey'],"['', '']",[],"['one word title', 'tokyo japan', 'hostage', 'factory', 'school dance', 'friendship']",[],"The day begins with Ron searching in his locker for his pet Rufus. After Rufus is found, Ron notices Kim staring across the hallway, enraptured. As Ron turns around, he sees that it is Josh Mankey that Kim is staring at. Neither he nor Rufus are impressed by Josh.

Kim approaches Josh, but is unable to talk to him, and just ends up rambling. Kim then announces her intentions to Ron about wanting to ask Josh to the Spirit Week Dance. Ron responds stating that won't make Josh feel weird going with them, as they always go together. Kim responds saying that's as friends, and this time she wants a date. Ron announces then he will also bring a date to the dance. Wade calls Kim to inform her of a situation in Tokyo involving her arch nemesis Dr. Drakken. Kim and Ron then hitch a ride with Britina to Tokyo, and on the flight, Ron makes his first failed attempt at getting a date for the dance by asking Britina if she wants to dance with him.

Upon arriving in Tokyo, Kim and Ron are introduced to Nakasumi-San and informed that his factory has been taken over and that its two workers are trapped inside. As Kim and Ron infiltrate the factory Ron comes to the conclusion that Drakken is trying to steal Christmas, Kim is doubtful and convinced it's a take over the world plot. Kim and Ron locate the hostages and Kim gives Ron the Kimmunicator so he can distract Drakken while she frees the hostages. Ron's distraction works, and Kim is able to free both hostages. Drakken discovers Kim and Ron and prepares to tell them his plan. However, Shego interrupts, pointing out whenever he does this, Kim wins. Drakken then activates a series of cables, which are attached to the factory's production line, and then proceeds to escape with the production line, his henchmen, and Shego by helicopter.

The next morning Kim is at breakfast with her father as he reads in the paper about Kim's exploits the previous evening. Kim starts telling her dad about the Josh situation and how she wants to take him to the dance. Kim then begins telling her mother about Josh, when Jim and Tim interrupt saying Kim should send Josh an anonymous email through Sweden. Her father then recalls that Jim and Tim's principal has been getting anonymous emails from Sweden, at which point the boys disappear. Kim's mom then gives Kim some advice on how to talk to Josh.

Kim tries several times throughout the day to ask Josh out but is unable to do so. Ron likewise tries several times to find a date but is rejected each time. Kim plans to talk to Josh as he paints a banner for the dance; however, Bonnie's arrival causes Kim to decide to ask him after cheer practice. During practice, the Kimmunicator rings and the distraction causes Kim to fall over, ripping Josh's banner.

Kim and Ron follow up a tip on Drakken's newest lair, which leads them to a fortress deep in a snowy mountain region. Wade is unable to shut down the sensor beams around it. However, he is able to increase the beam's frequency thus making them visible to the human eye. As Kim announces they can't touch the beams, Ron crashes into her and both head into the field of laser beams. They manage to avoid the beams, unfortunately, Rufus slides into one, setting off an alarm and causing them to be captured. Kim and Ron are then taken inside Drakken's lair and surrounded by Henchmen. Kim leaps over the henchmen to fight Shego on a catwalk above them. As the henchmen close in on Ron, he calls for help. Kim proceeds to throw him a tin of lip gloss. Ron threatens the henchmen with the tin, causing them to burst out laughing. Kim tells Ron to hold his breath and open the lid, which he does, releasing a potent stink which knocks out the henchmen. Kim then uses the lip gloss on Shego, knocking her out as well. Drakken then appears, and Ron tells him he knows of his plan to steal Christmas, to which Drakken replies ""not even close"".

Drakken then uses the factory assembly line he stole to form the ultimate robot warrior. As Drakken begins his rampage around his lair, Kim calls Wade, who informs her that Nakasumi built an override into his factory's system. Ron then distracts Drakken while Kim climbs up the robot's back searching for the override. As Drakken attempts to remove Kim from his robot's back, he inadvertently reveals the override switch. Kim plugs the Kimmunicator into the override and Wade begins hacking into the robot. Ron attempts a flying kick on the robot but is caught in mid-air by Drakken. As Ron hangs upside down, Rufus falls out of his pocket. Kim uses her hair dryer to swing down and rescue Rufus. As Drakken prepares to vaporize Kim, Wade gains control of the robot and then uses the robot to hang Drakken upside down like Ron.

However, Shego is quickly able to disable Wade's control of the robot. Both Shego and Kim jump into the cockpit and fight for control over the robot. This causes Drakken and Ron to be flung around on the outside of the robot. During the fight, Ron and Drakken are released from the robot's grip and Shego is able to cause Kim to fall out of the cockpit. However, Kim is able to use her hair dryer to entangle the robot's legs during her descent. As the robot tips over, Kim uses her rocket skates to move herself and Ron to safety.

On her return to Middleton, Kim plans to ask Josh to the dance, however as Josh gets closer to her position, Kim freaks out, hiding in the janitor's closet. Ron encourages Kim and she leaves the closest and starts talking to Josh who agrees to go with her to the dance. As they walk away together, Ron announces his need for the ride to the dance. However, Kim slams the door close to the janitor's closet. Kim is then seen dancing with Josh at the dance. During the dance, the Kimmunicator beeps, but she switches it off and continues to dance with Josh. As the episode ends it turns out that poor Ron is still trapped in the janitor's closet."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0619817/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"It's Ron's chance to take charge when a tire blow-out strands the entire cheer leading squad at Camp Wannaweep, the origin of most of Ron's phobias.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Chris Bailey'],"['', '', '']",[],"['three word title', 'gill man', 'summer camp', 'friendship']",[],"The Middleton Cheer Squad is in a school bus being driven to a cheer competition by Mr. Barkin, but Ron's Mad Dog antics are starting to eat away and ending the happy mood at certain members of the squad, namely Bonnie. As Kim warns Ron to act ""normal"" for a change, Ron begins to notice something familiar about the road they are on. In a sudden panic, Ron calls Wade on the Kimmunicator wanting a GPS lock on his position. Wade obliges and the data confirms Ron worst fears, they are near Camp Wannaweep.

Ron urges Mr. Barkin to drive fast and explains the camp is the site of his worst summer ever and that he would never come back. Suddenly the bus drives over some tire spikes, causing the bus to come to a halt outside the main gates to Camp Wannaweep. Barkin informs the team that the bus has two flats and that they need to call for help. As such the girls all pull out cellphones only to find there is no signal and even the Kimmunicator is not working. Barkin tells Ron to lead them to a phone in the camp. It then dawns in Ron that he is in charge for once, according he declares to the team only he knows how to survive the dangers of Camp Wannaweep. The team enters the camp only to discover the phone is out of order. Tara recalls that their situation is just like from horror films, innocent teens trapped in the woods getting picked off one by one. Kim is quick to dispel that idea and even Bonnie agrees that if it were a movie there would be more guys. Kim announces that they are stuck for the night and might as well make the best of it.

As the team sits around the campfire Ron tells them stories of his time at Camp Wannaweep. Barkin tells Ron to stop when Ron notices a rustle in the bushes. As Ron goes to investigate, Kim tells him to relax and enjoy the campfire. As they leave the bushes a swamp creature appears briefly watching the team. Kim and Barkin soon leave in search of more firewood, citing they cannot stand to listen to another of Ron's stories. As Barkin and Kim wander into the forest the swamp creature follows them. Back at the campfire, Ron tells the story of the lake at Camp Wannaweep. In the story Ron recalls how he did not want to go swim in the lake due to the fact it was green, it smelled and he had seen the fish glowing at night. Ron ended up trading his afternoon swim with a kid called Gil Moss and Ron taking Gil's spot in arts and crafts. Back in the forest as Kim and Barkin collect firewood, Kim hears a noise. Barkin dismisses this, saying Ron's stories must be getting to her. Suddenly a creature grabs Barkin's leg and pulls him into the bushes. Kim notices Barkin has vanished and calls out to him, but there is no response. As Kim returns to the campfire she asks the rest of the team if they have seen Barkin. Kim asks where Liz and Marcella have gone when suddenly two screams are heard. As Kim and Ron rush to the site, they find no trace of the girls and only a strange footprint in the dirt. Ron decides they must move to his old stronghold Cabin 13. As Kim and Ron debate over who is in charge, Barkin is heard calling out from the forest. Kim and Ron race out to find Barkin covered in green slime, talking about a strange creature that oozed muck.

Suddenly, screams are heard from the rest of the team. Kim, Ron, and Barkin run back to Cabin 13 to find it in ruins, the rest of the team pinned to the walls by green slime and the mysterious creature. The creature then revels itself to be Gil, although he now calls himself ""Gill"" with an extra-L. Gill then traps Kim onto a nearby tree with his slime and tells Ron he knows all about how great Ron's life is. When Mr. Barkin attempts to diffuse the tense situation, Gill sticks him to another tree as well. Gill then reveals that the lake was toxic and the reason for his mutation. Gill also tells the team that he jammed their cellphones and caused the bus to crash in order to get his revenge on Ron. In addition, he reveals that prolonged exposure to the green muck will mutate them as well, much to their disgust and horror. As Gill advances on Ron escapes through a tunnel in the floor of the cabin, as this happens Barkin starts to mutate due to contact with Gill's slime. Ron's tunnel emerges into the arts and crafts building and he begins collecting supplies. Gill suddenly burst through the floor and begins shooting slime throughout the room. But once again Ron is able to escape.

Ron is then seen building a net from crafts lanyard material while Rufus fixes an outboard on a motorboat. Ron and Rufus then take off across the lake in the motorboat. Gill hears the engine start and heads off after Ron. Suddenly, the boat's engine dies, and Ron complains it is out of gas. Gill then appears next to the boat, so Ron dives into the lake. As Gill and Ron fight in the water, a rope slips on to Gill's leg. Ron grabs the rope and tells Rufus to start the engine. The boat then hurtles across the lake will Gill in tow, until it crashes into the dock leaving Gill high and dry.

The next morning, Biohazard teams arrive to decontaminate the squad. Kim introduces Ron to Dr. Lurkin, who they hope will be able to reverse Gill's mutation. As Gill is taken away in a giant fish bowl, he once again vows revenge on Ron. As the squad leaves the camp, they all thank Ron, and Tara even kisses him on the cheek. Though reluctant, Bonnie also thanks Ron as well, admitting his bravery in defeating Gill. As Ron takes one last look at the camp, Kim comes over and congratulates him for saving everyone. As they leave, Ron asks if he can call the shots on their next mission, but Kim says that was ""ferociously unlikely""."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0619823/?ref_=ttep_ep3,,Innocent suggestions have disastrous consequences when Kim convinces Ron to get a new haircut... and Ron convinces a billionaire recluse to try and take over the world!,[],TV-G,Release date,['Chris Bailey'],"['', '', '']",[],"['three word title', 'paris france', 'london england', 'haircut', 'blackout', 'cockpit', 'plane', 'billionaire', 'father son relationship', 'island', 'airplane', 'tanning', 'locker', 'friendship']",[],"This episode starts off at Kim's house, where she sits, looking very thoughtful. Francois, a barber, also looks very thoughtful. The same goes for Rufus. Francois then proceeds to cut Ron's hair, after getting support from Kim. He says he is doing this because Kim helped his poodle. Kim's mom then comes into the kitchen, asking why Ron is getting a haircut in their kitchen, to which Kim replies that he needs it. For ""the finale"", he adds some ""Le Goup"". Everyone except Ron seems to like it, and he screams as we head into the opening credits.

At school, the usual sign isn't there. Ron is hiding in a closet, because he thinks the new haircut is ugly. When he comes out he has a bucket over his head. When he takes it off, he has a thick cap on his head to hide his hair. He says that the haircut has destroyed his ""Ron-ness"". Kim tricks Ron, and manages to get the cap off. Ron chases Kim through the halls, but is quick to stop when he sees some senior girls that like his haircut a lot, telling him to meet them later. This causes Ron to immediately like his haircut. But, much to his dismay, one straw of hair is still standing out. Well, Ron convinces Kim to go to France so that they can get him some more of the ""Le Goup"" hair gel.

As a plane lands on an airport, we see Kim inside, thanking the pilots for the ride, and ends up bragging about the time she helped them, as always. In Paris, Kim and Ron are visiting Francois. As they exit his shop, he says that Ron needs a new wardrobe to take the haircut to the next level. Kim is very irritated, because all the girls walking by Ron looks at him and gives him blow kisses. Kim argues with Ron a bit, but gives up, and walks away very irritated. But all of a sudden, all the electricity gets cut across the whole town. Kim asks Wade about the snitch, and he tells them that there have been blackouts all across Europe. Well, Wade fixes them a ride.

Kim and Ron are sitting in a helicopter very nervously, asking if this is safe. Wade guarantees that it is safe as we see a cabin in the helicopter, without a pilot. They have traced what that has been causing all the blackouts, and it seems like it is an island. A giant light beams up from the whole island, indicating that someone has been using enormous amounts of electricity there. They then proceed to land on the island. They grapple themselves over a huge wall with barbed wires and searchlights on top of it. At the top, they see some pools and some buildings, as well as a gargantuan lamp in the middle. They also discover a man that is sunbathing by the pool. He then calls for his father, believing them to be the new servants. His father then introduces them as Senor Senior, Senior and Senor Senior, Junior. Inside, Kim explains the Seniors about energy, and ways of being economical with their energy consumption. Ron then says that his ""house"" looks like a perfect evil lair, saying that someone can take over the world from a place like that, giving out ideas about how to do it, like installing a communications jammer, missiles, self-activating lasers, an indoor lagoon filled with piranhas. Further, he proposes an underground escape route, as well as spinning tops of doom. They then exit. Well, the Seniors find out that they need a hobby.

Back at Kim's house that evening, Kim is about to eat dinner, and are arguing with the twins. Kim's mother then serves dinner, which is meat loaf shaped like a brain, which grosses Kim out. Kim then goes up to her room, and tries to call Ron, but he is not home. At the mall, Ron is in a clothes store, and he is looking for clothes to match the hair cut, but he is very choosy. Kim tries to page him, but he is not answering, because he is too busy with his new haircut. Kim tries to talk to her dad about it, but he is talking nonsense as normal. Talking to her mother doesn't give much result either.

At school next day, a guy with black pants is walking through the hallways. He does also have a blue sweater, and we see Rufus on his arm, indicating that it's Ron. Everyone looks at him as he is walking through the hallway. When Kim discovers his new clothes, she gets very surprised. later at the school day, Rufus is walking around the floor, panicked. He does almost get stepped on several times before Kim picks him up. Ron is talking to Amelia, one of the senior girls, when Kim takes him away. She tries to explain that Rufus could have been stepped on, but he doesn't particularly care. Kim then takes Rufus to her locker, so that he can live there. Wade then beeps in, and says that it is trouble with the Seniors, because they have taken the power in Europe again, but by purpose this time.

We then see Paris, London and Venice, whit blackouts occurring in every single town. At the Seniors' island, Senior sr. is reading ""The Book of Evil"", for ideas about how to be evil. They then see Kim and Ron arriving on one of their security cams. They then see some missiles, one of Ron's advices. They then see a giant plug, which is used to drain all of Europe's power. When they get into Senior's house, they see a lagoon, with piranhas (that will come in the next Monday), another one of Ron's suggestions. Senior Sr. then tells that he ordered ""The Book of Evil"" so that he could learn how to be a villain. Kim and Ron then sees some red marks on their faces, which indicates self-activating lasers, yet another one of Ron's suggestions. They then run from the lasers. Senior Sr. then says that he is going to attack Middleton with one of his missiles. Ron then heads after Senior Jr., who is heading for the missile launching ramp. Kim is doing well with dodging the self-activating lasers and making them shoot each other. But then Senior Sr. sends in his spinning tops of doom, the second last of Ron's advices.

Up at the missile launching pad, Junior is preparing the missiles for launch, when Ron comes, and they begin to fight. They do so by messing up each others hair, to distract. They continue with it, fixing and messing up the others hair, until Junior breaks Ron's comb. This makes Ron very angry, and he jumps on Junior. Junior's comb also falls out, and almost drops down into the water. Back inside, Kim is still running from the spinning tops of doom. Outside, Ron sees his reflection, and his mind finally come to sense, as does his hair, with the help of Rufus. Rufus also shoves Junior's comb over the edge, and he climbs down after it. This allows Ron to stop the missiles from launching. He then runs inside, just to find Kim having problems with the tops of doom. Ron throws a metal bar at one of them, causing it to go crazy and destroying the others. Senior Sr. on the other hand, makes his escape with a secret escape route and a speed boat, the last one of Ron's advises.

Back at school, Ron has learned a lesson. And he thinks that it wasn't the haircut that made him popular, it was the confidence. Well, he is proven wrong when he gets rejected by Amelia. Back at Kim's locker, Rufus is glad to see the old Ron again, ending the episode."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0619827/?ref_=ttep_ep4,,"In Kim's first encounter with Dr. Drakken, she must retrieve an experimental robot tick that Drakken has rigged to explode.... but first she has to escape detention with Mr. Barkin.",[],TV-G,Release date,"['Chris Bailey', 'Sahak Hong', 'Jaewoong Kim']","['', '']",[],"['robot', 'three word title', 'south america', 'detention', 'school detention', 'shark', 'mexican restaurant', 'locker', 'mugshot', 'friendship']",[],"While trying to print her term paper in time for class, Kim Possible lands herself in detention for being tardy for the third time that month (courtesy of Mr. Barkin). For Kim, this is a huge deal due to her status as a cheerleader and how it makes her look; however, those worries are put on hold after Wade informs her of an incident in the Amazon. He hooks her up with a ride with Gustavo whose village Kim saved from a flood of the Amazon. A bug researcher named Professor Acari, has had his experimental robotic tick stolen by an unknown thief for an unknown purpose. Ron is completely freaked out by all of the professor's bug friends. It is later revealed that the thief was Shego and that she is working under the employment of Dr. Drakken. Back in Middleton, Kim serves her first block of detention in Room 12 with Big Mike, Vinnie, and Junior, all of whom are not of the same caliber. Detention is thankfully cut short by Rufus who poses as a rampaging mutant who had broken free from the science lab. At Bueno Nacho, Kim is given an update by Wade about a villain's lair in the Caribbean that is linked back to Shego. Team Possible heads to the Caribbean lair but are immediately captured by Dr. Drakken and almost fed to man-eating sharks but Kim manages to apprehend them with her Elastic Constricting Agent disguised as lipstick. Drakken plans to combine the robotic tick with his own nano-explosive as a threat weapon. Once attached to a victim, they will be at his mercy. Despite Drakken's plan, Kim is able to retrieve the plans for the robotic tick and flee Drakken's lair.

Upon returning to Middleton High, Ron is jealous of Kim's new ""street cred."" Mr. Barkin puts Kim back into detention after identifying the mutant as a naked mole rat. Meanwhile back in the Caribbean, Drakken and Shego discover that the missing tick is with Kim Possible. In detention, the other teens noticed a ""zit"" on Kim's nose that turns out to be the robotic tick. Immediately Kim ditches detention to find Ron and try to get the tick removed before it explodes. Unfortunately for her, Drakken, as well as Mr. Barkin (with the teens in tow), engage in hot pursuit of Kim and Ron. After seeking refuge in Bueno Nacho, Kim and Shego fight while Wade tells Ron that the only way to remove the tick is to burn the circuits. Ron immediately thinks of Diablo Hot Sauce. They are interrupted by Shego for a moment but she is sat on by Big Mike. Ron uses the hot sauce to remove the tick which explodes immediately after Kim throws it towards Drakken's hovercraft. Even though Drakken is thwarted, Kim still serves her detention but this time making friends with the people she had previously deemed not cool (countering Barkin's objective of making detention a period of quiet suffering)."

At the side of the school stands a school bus. Some pupils are going into it, while some others are putting their backpacks into the bus. Barkin stands at one end of the bus and writes down everyone who gets on the bus. Ron arrives carrying a pair of skis and almost hits Kim and another student. They then look at a really sad pupil named Alan Platt going into the bus. The reason he is sad is because his parents are going to chaperone on the ski trip. Kim's mom then shows up, much to Kim's surprise, saying that Bonnie called her and Mr. Dr. Possible telling them about the need for replacement chaperones. Bonnie takes a picture of them.

Kim then says that Bonnie did it on purpose, to which she ""tries to act innocently"". Kim's dad, on the other hand, is trying to act cool, which means ""humiliation nation"" for Kim.

As the bus drives through the snow-covered mountain landscape, Kim's parents are telling embarrassing stories about her, completely humiliating her. Ron, on the other hand, is worried about a snow beast reported in the newspaper, to which Kim gives a sarcastic answer. She tells him that the picture in the newspaper could be anything and that Ron should not take it seriously. He then tells her that is the point, as the newspaper is giving $5000 to whoever can get a clear photo of the beast. Every person in the bus hears him and looks at him weirdly, and Barkin asks if Ron really believes it. Kim's parents then begin to sing, making Kim totally humiliated, while Ron sings along.

When they arrive at their ski lodge, Kim's dad makes sure that everyone gets all their stuff, while Barkin asks Ron if he is ready to get that snow beast. Ron is surprised as Barkin explains that he did not want to share the $5000 with the whole class. Barkin then agrees to cut Ron in for two percent of the $5000. Kim is continuing to get humiliated by her parents as they continue to tell her classmates' more embarrassing stuff about her. Bonnie, on the other hand, is really enjoying herself and continues to take pictures of Kim and her parents.

Ron and Barkin are walking up the mountain. Ron is very exhausted, while Barkin is not tired at all. They then stop, as Barkin hears something. A terrible scream then comes shaking trees and making Barkin and Ron almost fall. Ron and Barkin then say out ""Snow Beast!"" at the same time, in a happy tone, and heads to where the scream comes from. They then start to follow it, before seeing a shadow flying over them, and then a big crash behind them. This causes Ron and Barkin to fall over the edge, and slide down the snow-covered mountainside, before heading off a cliff and falling some meters into the snow below. They manage to get up from the snow and hear the same scream again, and some very heavy footsteps. Barkin makes the camera ready, as a shadow approaches. Ron screams, but Barkin tells him to calm down, as it is only a woman. We then get to see this woman, who is a little big in the edges. She also has black hair and glasses as well. They then talk a bit with her, and she asks if they believe in the snow-beast, to which they assure her that they don't. She also introduces herself as Amy Hall. She is trying to hit on Barkin. Ron tries to play matchmaker as soon as he notices, much to the dismay of Barkin. They then head back to the lodge, as we hear some giant footsteps, and see a large monster jumping past, with big rodent teeth and whiskers, and it screams out, which allows us to see that it has long ears and two horn-like growths on its nose, but it is only a silhouette, so we don't see any facial details.

Back outside the lodge, where the rest of the class is, Bonnie is talking to Kim's dad, but Kim interrupts, fearing a humiliation scene coming up. Ron then comes down at high speeds on a snowboard, an as he stops, he manages to shower Bonnie with snow, much to her irritation and Kim's pleasure. Kim then asks if he has found his snow monster, to which Ron hushes her. Amy and Barkin then comes down, and Amy is still hitting on him. Kim then notices a strange-looking stuffed animal that Amy has attached to her jacked, around the center of her chest, saying that it is an Otterfly, a Cuddle Buddy. Amy then asks if Kim collects Cuddle Buddies, to which she replies that she has seen them at the mall, as to not embarrass herself. Kim's mother then comes and says that Kim loves Cuddle Buddies. Amy is really happy for this, and says that she is the president of the Cuddle Buddy Collectors Club, and Bonnie takes a picture of them, which annoys Kim. Amy then asks which of them Kim's favorite is. Kim's mother then says that it is Pandaroo, and that she still sleeps with it, which annoys Kim, and makes Bonnie really happy.

Up at the terrace of the lodge, Kim is standing, looking very angry. She then tells Ron that Bonnie knows about Pandaroo, and that all hope is lost. Ron then borrows the Kimmunicator, and asks Wade about the snow monster sitch. Wade says that he hasn't found anything, and that Barkin gives him 10 percent of the reward if he delivers info, which irritates Ron. Kim then tells how terrible it is to have her parents on the ski trip, and that she is in humiliation nation. Unfortunately, Kim's dad hears this, and gets sad. Barkin then comes and says that they have to go out again before Amy force-feeds him more cocoa.

Up in the mountain, Barkin and Ron is ready for the snow beast. Barkin has the camera ready, and is on the lookout for the beast, and so is Ron and Rufus. Ron is holding the Kimmunicator, with Wade on it. They then discover some really large footprints, which Barkin takes pictures of the footprints, as a shadow moves between the nearby trees. A dog then comes out of the trees. Barkin proceeds to pet it, but it reveals it has a pair of pincers, as well as six lobster legs and a lobster tail. Barkin is about to take a picture of it, when a rumble appears and it runs away. A big monster then jumps out of the trees behind them, and we clearly see that it is the monster we saw from before. We now get to see it in detail, and it looks like a rabbit mixed up with a rhinoceros. Amy then appears with two masked men and the dog-lobster in her hands, and tells the rabbit-rhinoceros to sit still, and it obeys. Barkin then understands that Amy is the owner of these beasts, and Amy then tells the masked men to get the camera. Barkin then takes off one of the monsters' mask, and he understands that it is not a normal man, as the head is that of a pig. Ron takes off the mask of the other ""man"", and sees that its head is that of a bird. The pig-man then knocks out Barkin, as Amy tells them to take them to her lab. The pig-man and the bird-man then carries off Ron and Barkin, while Amy rides the rabbit-rhino back to her Lab. The Kimmunicator on the other hand, is still lying in the snow, and Wade figures he has to get Kim, and the Kimmunicator then rockets off, with two sled legs on it.

Back at the lodge, Mr. Dr. Possible is building a snowman, as two girls says that he has a nice outfit, to which he answers ""groovy"". Kim's dad then gets a little angry as Kim comments that reply, and Kim's mother then tells Kim's father that they should go, since they don't want Kim in humiliation nation, with a slightly irritated tone. Kim then realizes that they heard her talking about it, and feels bad. But then the Kimmunicator comes down, and Wade tells Kim that something has happened.

At Amy's lab, the man-creatures are tying up Ron, Barkin, and Rufus, while Amy scolds the rabbit-rhino for wandering around in the mountains. Barkin then asks what kind of place they are at, to which Amy replies that it is her Genetic Engineering Lab, and she shows them her favorite part of it, which is her one hundred percent complete collection of Cuddle Buddies. She then begins to tell what she did after that, as she takes some cookies out of an oven, which was to create living Cuddle Buddies. She then says that she is one of the world's most foremost bio-geneticists, and that she was called DNAmy. Barkin then says that she is ""sick and wrong"". DNAmy then says that he is a meanie and that she ""can fix that"", and gets an evil smile on her face.

Kim is snowboarding through the mountains, and stops to ask Wade if he can search the Cuddle Buddy website for Amy, as they have information about every major ""cuddlers"". Wade asks how she knows that, and she says that she has visited the website a few times. This almost makes Wade laugh. They then find out that she is a bio-geneticist, that she was kicked out of the university because of unorthodox splice experiments, and that her nickname was DNAmy. Wade then proceeds to scan the nearby area for a lab, and he finds a cave with high amounts of artificial reinforcements. Kim then continues to snowboard through the terrain, towards the cave. She then detects a security cam moving back and forth, and manages to get past it undetected.

Back inside DNAmy's lab, she is about to put Barkin and Rufus into a machine, and she tells them that she is going to genetically splice Rufus and Barkin, since he told her she is sick and wrong. They then gets taken into two small rooms. DNAmy is then starting the genetic splice, and the machine gets activated. Kim has come in, and is watching the process from above. She then sees a cat approaching, but it is no ordinary cat, as it has the body of a snake. It then wraps around Kim, and she falls down some stairs to the same floor as DNAmy and the others. The snake-cat gets knocked out from this. She then discovers a Pandaroo Star edition in DNAmy's collection, stating that they only made twelve of them. She then throws two Cuddle Buddies at DNAmy's man-creatures, who is running towards her. The Cuddle Buddies knocks them out. Kim then proceeds to take DNAmy, but she whistles, and the rabbit-rhino arrives and stops Kim. DNAmy then completes the genetic splice between Rufus and Barkin, and a creature which looks like a man-sized Rufus with huge muscles and Barkin's hair then comes out of a third room in between the two that Ron and Barking were taken into before the genetic splice. Kim then plays the rabbit-rhino up against the naked mole man, saying that DNAmy has a new favorite, which works, as the rabbit-rhino lets go of Kim and begins to fight the naked mole man, while DNAmy tries to stop them.

Kim uses the situation to free Ron. As the fight continues, the two mutants begins to destroy DNAmy's lab; Kim then manages to get the naked mole man into the genetic engineering machine, and transforms it back to separate Rufus and Barkin. However, Rufus is wearing Barkin's clothes, while Barkin yells that he needs some pants, much to the shock of Kim, Ron, and Rufus. They then escapes just as the lair blows up; Barkin puts on a purple dressing gown and slippers. As the lab explodes, Cuddle Buddies starts to rain down. But just as they thought they were safe, an avalanche starts, triggered by the explosion. They then start to run, but they see no hope of outrunning it. But luckily, just as hope seems to have gone, Kim's dad comes in for a miraculous rescue on his homemade rocket snowboard, and they manages to jump over a chasm, and is safe from the avalanche, which plunges into the chasm.

They arrive down at the lodge, and everyone is cheering. DNAmy gets taken into custody (which leaves one to wonder how she survived the explosion). Kim then apologizes to her parents, and her mom accepts, saying that she and Kim's father were teenagers once, and that they sometimes forget what it's like. Bonnie then takes a picture of Kim hugging her mom after the apology, and both Kim and her mother look at Bonnie, irritated. Then, behind her, a woman comes out, and calls Bonnie's name. Bonnie then cringes as she realizes that it's her mom. She calls Bonnie stuff like ""pumpkin"" and ""Bon-Bon"", which leaves Bonnie in ""humiliation nation"", while the others enjoy it. Kim's mom then reveals that she called Bonnie's mother, and told her that they needed more chaperones. Kim then tells her mom that she rocks, and her mother replies, ""You rock too, Kimmie""."

Putting Kim in the difficult position of having to defend Ron in front of the rest of the squad, while trying to find a way of discouraging him before he embarrasses himself, or her. Things don't get much better when Ron announces that he's changed his mind, and doesn't want to be a cheerleader. Largely, because he's set his heart on being the team's mascot. Even going so far as to design and build his own ""Middleton Mad Dog"" costume.

Feeling bad about not standing up for her friend and his dream, Kim seeks advice from her father. Dr. Possible then tells a story about his college days, and how he lost a good friend whose dream he once laughed at. Unfortunately, Dr. Possible's story doesn't convince Kim and she ends up having a blazing row with Ron. Meanwhile, something strange is happening in the local science community. Professor Ramesh, of the Mount Middleton observatory, calls Kim in when his partner, Astronomer Bob Chen has gone missing. Kim arrives at the observatory just in time to see Professor Ramesh being abducted by three fembots, who introduce themselves as Bebes before making off with the professor. Angry that the Bebes got away, Kim blames Ron and his belated arrival for distracting her and chews him out. Hurting his feelings to the point that, when he discovers a link between the two missing scientists and Kim's father, he decides to go it alone. Sometime later, Dr. Possible is getting in his car when, all of a sudden, the Bebes appear. They tear a hole in his car roof and reach in to drag him out.

The first that Kim knows about this is when her father, quite unabducted, storms into cheer practice and demands to know where Ron is, and why there is a hole in his car roof. All soon becomes clear when the scene changes, revealing that Dr. Possible is locked in a cage with the missing scientists. Their captor, none other than Dr. Drakken. It is soon revealed that Professors Ramesh and Chen are the two friends mentioned in Dr. Possible's earlier flashback. More than this, though, Dr. Drakken is the one that they laughed at back in college, and now he's back and wanting revenge on them for mocking him all those years ago. Of course, there is one more surprise in store. Dr. Possible isn't Dr. Possible, he's really Ron in disguise. Leaving the real Dr. Possible to arrive with Kim. With the introductions over, and the Bebes announcing that Drakken is not fit to command them, Kim sets to with the rogue robots but finds that they are too fast and too tough for her Kung Fu skills to be effective against them. Fortunately for her, Dr. Possible comes to the rescue by getting Wade to set the Kimmunicator up to emit a wave that interferes with the Bebe's wireless network signal. Severing them from the Bebe's coordinating hive mind, confusing them sufficiently for Kim get them to destroy one another. With Drakken and his robots out of the way, the episode draws to a close with Ron; Kim initially disapproved him of being the mascot, for fear of humiliation, but since he is her best friend, she allows it. Ron makes his first appearance as the Middleton Mad Dog, at a school basketball game. Much to Kim's surprise, and Bonnie's shock, the crowd loves him."

As the wizard who invented the spell had only one leg, the spell lasts for as long as you can stand or hop on one leg. Once you drop your foot, time unfreezes. Although Justin's practice run didn't quite work out as planned, it is obvious that Alex can, as usual, use this spell for her own selfish purposes. After her mother takes the credit for her ideas at a sandwich inventing meeting, Alex decides she is tired of not getting the credit she deserves. She complains about it to a customer, who turns out to work for a fashion magazine. She tells him the designs he's working on for the layout are all wrong, then shows him what she thinks they should be. He likes her 'pinache,' so he offers her an internship. Alex tells her parents that she's taking it, forcing them to hire a new employee. On her first day on the job, Alex irritates the other intern, Paul (pah-ool) by telling her opinions at the meeting, rather than just getting coffee, like an intern is supposed to do.(Not to mention by calling him Paul.) Her idea to make summer colors work for fall impresses her new boss, who decides to run with it. Meanwhile, Justin and Max are waiting to meet the new waitress, who they think will be old and smell like ham. When she comes in, however, it is apparent that neither guess is true. Justin quickly decides that she is pretty and Max convinces his brother to let him help convince her that he's pretty great himself. Justin lets Max tell Millie his good points, which doesn't work out so well, as he tells her that Justin plays with action figures and wears his underwear in the shower. However, she seems to think this is fine, so she tells Justin she has two tickets to see Tears of Blood, which happens to be Justin's favorite band, and tells him to come to her apartment before the concert. As for Alex, she is so excited about her idea being presented to the woman in charge of the magazine (think Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada), that she invites Harper along for the show. After calling Harper 'the girl dressed like a giant kindergartener,' the woman decides she loves Alex's idea...except that her boss takes all the credit, and Alex is left to get coffee for everyone, including Harper. So Alex decides to come up with an idea that will make her boss regret taking all the credit. Remembering the comment about Harper's clothes, she asks Harper to design the most hideous, juvenile outfits as possible, passing them off as 'Fashion for people who hate fashion.' Unfortunately, her boss decides to give Alex all the credit, forcing her to freeze time and give the outfits a last minute makeover. Even though she decided all she did was make 'Bad outfits...differently bad,' the woman in charge liked them. Alex decides she's had enough, she she quits the intern and she and Harper leave to (gasp) eat. Justin shows up at Millie's apartment for the concert, but when the door is opened he realizes that she never intended to take him. Her boyfriend is there, and Justin is expected to babysit Millie's son. Justin is disappointed, of course, but as Millie's son likes the same action figures as Justin, he decides it's okay."

She has taken Isobel McKenna and Justice Baines on her boat. The ""Bad Girls"" Nancy and Sydney arrive at the wharf, having extorted her location from one of her accomplices, and are joined by Ben&Ben and Syndey's father Joseph.

As a gunfight erupts between Nancy and Sydney on one side and Carlene Hart (and two of her gang) on the other side, Isobel and Justice set fire to the boat using a battery. When some other gang members investigate the fire, they are bested by Ben&Ben (during which Ben Baines is shot in the bottom). As soon as all good guys have left the ship, it explodes.

A short while into the gunfight of the bad guys only Carlene remains. She flees in a maze of containers and is sought after by Nancy, Sidney and Warren Hendrix (""Gabriel Knox"") who has discharged himself from the hospital in order to clear put the blame on Carlene and make it seem that she is Gabriel Knox. After a brief game of deadly hide-and-seek Nancy McKenna has Carlene Hart at gunpoint and knelt down, but Warren Hendrix wants to kill Carlene and threatens to kill Nancy. He is then shot by Sydney.

Nancy, Sydney and Carlene emerge and Carlene is handed over to the LAPD (who just arrived in full force). The LAPD force included Lt. Jason Colloway who compliments them on their actions (even though they were suspended from duty). That evening the head of the DEA hands them their badges back in exchange for their silence on the Gabriel Knox project. They both accept (although Nancy McKenna somewhat more reluctantly).

In the epilogue, Jen is found dead in Joseph's cafe."
