Mike allows Kimble to take up residence in his home, where he bumps into Mike's wife, Paula (Nan Martin) who is also a true believer in Kimble's innocence but also clashes with Mike over his efforts at helping people in general and Kimble in particular. Paula has a drinking problem, and fearing she could tell the police of Kimble's presence Mike gets Paula drunk.

Mike gets the editor of his newpaper, Connelley (Addison Richards) to give him $5,000 in expense money, but does so only on the promise if he does not find the one-arm man, he wants a story on Kimble's capture. Decker uses all of his resources and informants to try and find the suspect, and one of his informants, Cogen (Lewis Charles) finds the one arm man and sets up and appointment, but he gets picked up by the police for routine questioning before they can meet.

Decker demands that Cogen try and to locate the one-armed man again, but Lt. Gerard is in town and puts presure on Decker to turn Kimble in. At Decker's home, Cogen has returned to report the one-arm man will be getting on a bus in one hour. Kimble learns this from a drunken Paula and rushes in a cab to the bus station and sees the one armed man, eye to eye, just as the bus was takes off.

Kimble intercepts the bus at its first stop only to find that the one-armed man had fled shortly after it left the station. While this happens Lt. Gerard and local police Sergeant De Santis interrogate Paula, and she accidentally reveals that Kimble was in her and Mike's apartment. Cornered, Decker sets up Kimble to be captured at his apartment, getting the chance when Kimble phones to report seeing the one-armed man."

While shooting hoops in the driveway, Leia meets her next door neighbor Gwen Runck (Ashley Aufderheide). Gwen lives in Donna's old room. Leia is in the debate club, while Gwen is into rock and roll. Nate (Maxwell Acee Donovan) is Gwen's step-brother. Gwen gives Leia a nose ring.

The group nominates Leia to buy the tap as she is from out of town and Mama doesn't know her. The group dresses Leia as a pregnant woman, but Mama sees right through her. Leia blackmails mama since it was her son Wade (Luke Millington-Drake), who gave the keg to underage kids. If Leia complains, Mama loses the liquor license.

Nikki assures that there is nothing between her and Trevor. Plus, she is going to college so she can have a future. Nate wants to know if he is in that future, but Nikki says that the future is not set. She says that she loves Nate and hopes that that is enough for the time being.

Kitty sobers up and panics that she has a tattoo as she does not even wear waterproof mascara. Kitty knows that Red is going to be mad. But Jay refuses to leave as he knows that Leia will have to take all the blame. Red finds out about the tattoo. He kicks Jay out and sends Leia to her room. He yells at Sherri as it was her job to get Kitty back from the dentist. Instead Sherri pawned it off to the kids and turned it into a circus. Sherri sees that Red's criticism of her resembles her own father and she tells Red to back off. Sherri says that she respects herself and doesn't need Red's validation of her life.

Kitty helps Red understand that Jay could have run off and let Leia take all the blame. But he stood up for her and took responsibility for his actions. They never gave Jay a chance. Red even likes the tattoo. Red meets Leia and tells him that he is willing to give Jay a chance. Red even finds Jay already hiding in Leia's closet."

Red now has to use a cane to walk around the house. It is raining very heavily in Point Place. Kitty wanted to host a yard sale, but now she can't due to the rain. Plus, Red won't allow Kitty to sell away anything. He keeps piling up the old trash.

Sherri tells Red that her house needs fixing. The doorknob is broken, there is a dead fish that needs to be flushed down the toilet, and the toilet itself is clogged. Red is excited as he can be busy for several hours, and Kitty is excited as now she can get rid of some of the trash.

Leia has a hickey on her neck from Jay. Nikki wants to know if she has touched ""it"" yet, as she was sharing a blanket with Jay on a bean bag. Nikki says that there are certain rules of being together in a relationship and being on a bean bag under a blanket usually means touching it.

Leia doesn't want to touch it and wonders if Jay expects her to touch it. Nate's father plays baseball in Japan and is the oldest player in the league. Kitty comes by the basement to pick up some trash and also picks up a box of dog treats, which is where the gang stores their stash of weed. The gang blames Jay for hiding all their stash in the dog treats box. Jay decides to get it back but cannot as Kitty many identical boxes filled with trash and Jay will have to go through each one to figure out which one has the dog treats box. The gang decides to split up and search all the boxes in the garage and in the living room to get their stash back. Kitty thinks that the gang has come to help her. She gets Nate to bring down a wooden moose that Red keeps in his closet upstairs.

Ozzie and Jay manage to find the stash in one of the boxes in the garage before Red walks in. Jay hides the stash in a jacket that he was wearing that he also found in the boxes. Red asks the boys to leave and asks Jay to leave the jacket behind, since he paid full price for it at sears in 1964.

Meanwhile, Nikki has now gotten into Leia's head, and she is very unsure of her movements around Jay. She does not know what to touch or when. Nikki tells Leia not to overthink it. But also, not to touch Jay's hair, as when she touches Nate's hair, it flips a switch in his pants. Leia feels that boys are too complicated. Nikki tells Leia to put her hands on his hips, which is close enough to look like she is interested, but not close enough to be making a move on him.

Jay tells the gang that Red has the stash, but he doesn't know that he has it yet. Leia is close to panicking. Jay consoles Leia and she kisses him, but Ozzie startles Jay which makes him turn just as he was about to kiss Leia. As such, Leia hands which were headed for his hips, ended up right smack on his junk.

Nate and Gwen get into a fight when Gwen wears the t-shirt that Nate's father sent him. So, Nate steals the blanket that Gwen sleeps in. Kitty gets Gwen and Nate to talk to each other and they do. They both share how they feel connected to their dad through the stuff they left behind. They get very emotional and hug it out.

To keep Red busy Sherri tells Red that there are rats all over her house, so Red sets rat traps. When Ozzie and Jay come over to steal the stash, they are stung by the rat traps set by Red. But they finally manage to get back the stash. Leia tells Jay that she wants things to be fun and comfortable between them and he also agrees.

As Red returns, Kitty asks Nate and Gwen to move the wooden moose out of the house. The wooden moose joins the gang's circle when they smoke up the stash. As it stops raining, the gang heads outside and Leia shares a kiss with Jay. But then Sherri announces that school schedules are out and summer is coming to an end."

Leia is upset as her summer of freedom is coming to an end.

Nate had to bulk up for football season, but he didn't. Jay offers that Nate can use his gym to exercise and get in shape just in time. This is Leia's last weekend in Point Place, so Jay has traded shifts to spend time with her and he promises to take her to his special place in the woods for a picnic.

For the picnic Leia is blowing off Gwen as she had promised her to sneak into the Country Club over the weekend. Gwen is angry since it is Leia and her last Saturday together too. Leia promises to cancel the date with Jay.

Leia has to pick between her best friend and her boyfriend. She is a dirty double-Booker.

Meanwhile a teacher at school is going on maternity leave and Kitty has received a call to interview for her replacement. Kitty says that Leia will be gone soon, and she loved being close to the kids. Red tries to discourage Kitty by saying that with age she has gotten older, slower and softer, which offends her. Nikki helps Kitty with her resume. She was the head nurse, and her bosses all loved her, but they are all dead now.

Nate and Jay go to Jay's gym and have an intense workout session. But now, Nate's entire body is badly sore. Nate tried to fit an entire summer's worth of workouts in one day.

At the picnic, Leia is in a hurry, while Jay wants to savor every waking moment with Leia. Leia reveals that she might have to leave early to spend time with Gwen. But then Jay reveals that they are lost in woods. They find Leo wandering the woods. Jay is upset that Leia double booked on him. Leo then remembers that he has his car parked nearby on a road that goes right into town. Jay and Leia return pronto.

Gwen finds out about the double booking, when Leia is late returning from her date with Jay. Ozzie and Gwen break into the Country Club without Leia. Leia rushes to the club to meet Gwen. Gwen is ignoring Leia. Gwen tells the staff that Leia is not a member of the club and the security drags Leia out.

Kitty goes to her interview with Nikki, but Kitty forgets her resume. Kitty thinks this is a sign that she is not meant to go back to work. But that's when Red walks in with her resume that she had forgotten at her house. Kitty is nervous as all the other applicants are young. Red tells Kitty that she can accomplish anything that she sets her mind to. Red tells Kitty to go in and get the job. Kitty knows that Red supports her fully now. Kitty gets the job.

Nate tells Leia that Gwen is not herself at school, as she is the one ignored, and she is not popular. So, Gwen is going to miss Leia more than she realizes. Nate encourages Leia to tell Gwen that she Is her best friend, and that Leia will visit as much as she can. Leia reaches out to Gwen at her room and assures her that she is Leia's best friend. And nothing will ever change that. Gwen hugs Leia as she is going to miss Gwen.

Jay tells Nate that he is not sure about Leia. The picnic was complicated, and it will get tougher when Leia is all the way in Chicago."

It has only 24 shots, so Leia's every picture has to be perfect.

Jay organizes a party and Nate brings the keg from the 4th of July party. The gang drinks the old, warm beer and gets wasted. Nikki takes the pictures on Leia's camera. Nate comments to Jay that him breaking things off with Leia did not dampen the party, but Jay says that he hadn't told Leia yet. Leia hears everything as she is standing right next to them both and is stunned. Leia thinks that Jay sees her as one of his summer flings. Jay argues that they will be apart for 9 months and long-distance relationships are hard.

Nikki supports Jay and says that he is making a lot of sense. Ozzie also says that long distance calls are expenses, as he frequently calls his boyfriend in Canada. Gwen also supports Jay but says that she is looking out for Leia. Gwen argues that it is a long time apart and Jay is more likely to cheat on Leia than not.

Kitty is confident that Leia will be back, since her boyfriend lives in town, her best friend is next door, and she loves her potato salad. Kitty is devastated to learn that Jay has broken up with Leia. Leia is livid that her friends have abandoned her after weeks of spending time in her basement and eating her food. She vows never to return. Donna comes a day early to pick up Leia. Donna consoles Leia that breakups are messy. Donna says that she and Eric broke up all the time and she even dated a Kelso in between. Donna encourages Leia to talk to her friend Gwen.

Meanwhile Sherri is back with Fez. A tree was rotting in her backyard and Red had been asking her to take care of it for months. Now the tree has rotted to a point that it broke in half and fell into Red's driveway. Red asks Sherri to call her landlord and get rid of it. Turns out Sherri's landlord is Fenton (Jim Rash). Fez and Fenton hate each other. Fenton refuses to take care of the tree until Sherri pays rent and he increases Sherri rent due to Fez. Fe realizes that he has to let go of his grudge with Fenton to fix his relationship with Sherri. Fez buries the hatchet with Fenton, and he cleans up the driveway and re-carpets the house.

Kitty reaches out to Jay. Kitty says that Leia is so upset that she might not return the following summer. Jay says that Leia might find someone, or he may get to star as the next Karate Kid. Kitty tries convincing Jay to make the long-distance work with Leia. Nate tells Leia that Jay is his best friend, so he had to support him, but he agrees with Leia. Nate admits that he is a hopeless romantic like Leia, but Jay and Nikki are much more practical. Leia and Nate realize that they have more in common with each other and lean in to kiss. That's when Gwen walks in and is horrified. Leia runs away.

Leia goes to the water tower and Gwen meets her there. Gwen says that the first time Leia came to Point Place, she had never kissed, never had beer and was a nerd. But now she is a proper agent of chaos. Gwen says that Leia didn't kiss Nate and so she doesn't owe Jay anything. They paint the water tower and Leia promises to visit the following summer.

Jay catches Leia before she leaves. Jay says he was wrong and wants to make long distance work. Leia drives off with Donna before committing to Jay."

""One side, buster,"" says Popeye, as he pours charcoal into his new barbecue. The coal dust blackens Brutus. Popeye pours gasoline over the coal. Brutus helpfully offers to light it, but when he throws on the match, the coal explodes and singes off the hair on his head and beard (though it instantly grows back).

""Hamburgers!"" cries Brutus, when he sees Popeye carrying a pile of them on a plate. ""Yummy, yummy!""

""Yeah, but no yummy for you, dummy.""

The scent of the hamburgers wafts through the neighborhood. A sound like a jet tears through the air. ""What's that?"" asks a panicky Brutus. ""A plane, a train, a rocket?""

It's Wimpy. Suddenly, Popeye finds himself beckoned by Swee' Pea, who wants to swing on his swing set, and by Brutus and Wimpy, who pound their forks on the picnic table demanding hamburgers.

Popeye grabs Brutus and Wimpy and tosses them over his shoulder; grabs Swee' Pea and puts him under his arm; then drops all three when Olive appears, crying, ""Oh, a party!"" Sadly, she loves big parties. Worse, she's smitten with Brutus, a ""handsome brute.""

Popeye is furious, but now he has a party to host. Swee' Pea cries to be pushed on his swing, Wimpy demands more hamburgers, medium rare. And Brutus is pitching the woo to Olive. He has her shoe, and playfully asks how many lumps she wants in it. Swooning, Olive pushes her first two toes out of her sock and says, ""Two."" He drops in two lumps of sugar before Popeye asks him how many lumps he wants. ""Just one,"" says Brutus. And Popeye knocks him into the air.

Now Popeye plays Olive some accordion music, but Brutus ruins the recital by taking one end of it, pulling it and letting it go, so that it slaps Olive and knocks her out of her chair.

""He did it!"" says Brutus, pointing to Popeye.

""But, but, but, but, but--"" Puffs of smoke rise out of Popeye's pipe with each ""but.""

""Popeye!"" cries Olive. ""You are no gentleman. And if there's nothing I like the least, no gentleman is the most."" Besides, she doesn't like ""corny music."" She likes rock and roll. Suddenly, Brutus is on his guitar, singing, ""Don't Drop No Mustard on My Clean White Shirt, Baby"" (the title and the only lyrics). Meanwhile, Swee' Pea and Wimpy are both demanding his attention. He'd gladly ignore them, but Olive demands he attend to his guests, so that she can hear Brutus sing.

Popeye frantically delivers Wimpy his hamburgers, swings Swee' Pea and then tries to stop Brutus, who kicks him onto the barbecue. As his behind smokes, he leaps off the barbecue and into the air. Brutus uses his guitar like a baseball bat and knocks Popeye through the wall of his house and through his refrigerator. He rests on the floor with a can of frozen spinach resting on his pipe. Popeye uses his pipe to open it, toss it in the air and pour it into his mouth.

We hear the triumphant Popeye Just Ate His Spinach music, as Popeye appears in the backyard, red with rage. A bawling Swee' Pea, and a shouting Wimpy, instantly shut up. Both sneak past Popeye, tipping their hats and wearing panicked looks on their faces.

""Junior,"" says Popeye, crooking his finger at Brutus.

""Junior! Don't call me a sissy name like that! My name is --"" Instead of giving his name, he lets out an ear-splitting roar as he rushes toward Popeye like a mad bull. Popeye socks him with a tremendous crash that gives off a blinding light. Brutus flies from the west coast of the U.S. to the east where he crashes down, causing the world to tip and Olive to fall into Popeye's arms. He's glad to have her there, but she reminds him that she hasn't ""et"" yet.

Popeye happily whips up a mass of hamburgers, as Olive happily eats. A happy ending for them. A sad ending for Swee' Pea, Wimpy, Brutus and the east coast."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976939/?ref_=ttep_ep6,,"Popeye and Olive take shelter from a thunderstorm in Mad Mueller's castle. But Mueller's monster, Irving, takes a shine to Olive.",[],TV-G,Release date,['Paul Fennell'],[''],[],"['thunderstorm', 'monster', 'castle', 'laboratory', 'juice', 'appeal', 'romantic rivalry', 'monster loves woman', 'thunder', 'motor scooter', 'mad scientist', 'machine monster', 'kiss', 'fistfight', 'electricity', 'surprise ending']",[],"""Popeye!"" cries Olive over the thunder, as she rides on the back of Popeye's motor scooter. ""We've got to get out of this storm!""

""Right, Olive. It ain't a fit night out for man nor beask.""

Olive spots a house, as she calls it. Most observers would describe it as a sinister-looking castle.

Meanwhile, inside the castle, a scientist with German accent, is looking over his enormous and crazy-looking machine, which is hooked up to some kind of creature with what looks like a diving helmet over his head. ""Now, I push the little button,"" he says. ""That looks like a good button."" He does so, and the machine buzzes with electricity and cause the lights to go on and off. Finally, the diving helmet rises off the creature's head, and we see it's a huge, green human-like thing with bolts for ears.

""Oh! What a keen monster!"" The scientist walks up to it. ""I will call you Irving.""

""Irving!"" it replies in an echoing voice. ""Shee!""

Just then, Popeye knocks on the castle door. ""Hello? Anybody home?""

""Goody!"" exclaims the scientist. ""See who it is, Irving.""

With a devilish look on its face, Irving goes to the door and opens it.

""Welcome to Horace Heights,"" says the scientist, once Popeye and Olive are inside. ""I am Mad Mueller: scientist.""

Popeye introduces himself and Olive. Suddenly, Irving pops up from behind the door, looks at Olive and laughs dopily. Mad Mueller introduces Irving, his ""home-made monster.""

""Well, howdy, Mr. Monsker. Me name's Pop--"" The monster knocks Popeye's head below his collar. ""--eye."" Irving runs off and grabs Olive.

""Irving!"" cries Mueller. ""Be a good boy, Irving!""

""Yeah,"" says Popeye. ""Mind your manners, Mr. Monsker.""

The monster pays him no mind as he carries Olive off. ""Put me down, Oiving,"" she says with a notable absence of hysteria.

""Yeah, put down me, Olive. It's the only goil I got.""

""Help, Popeye!"" Olive cries, becoming more frightened.

""Come on and fights like a man, you monsker!""

Irving immediately drops Olive and runs to Popeye. He pounds Popeye on the head. ""I dares you to do that again."" Irving does it again. ""Okay, Mr. Monsker,"" Popeye says, pointing at him. ""You're cruisin' for a bruisin'!"" Irving bites his finger and then punches him.

""I has had enoughk!"" he says from the floor. ""And enoughk is too much! As one monsker to another, let's settle this fair and square. May the best monsker win.""

Irving laughs mockingly. But Popeye asks him if he'd like to laugh out of the other side of his face. And then he hits him, knocking his head, which is still connected by an expanding neck, into the air. The head snaps back down on its shoulders and spins around, until Irving's head is facing backwards.

Irving puts his head on straight and attacks. Popeye and Irving are nearly invisible within the cloud of dust they've kicked up.

Olive appeals to Mad Mueller. ""You're monster is beating up my monster. You've got to stop that fight.""

""But how?""

""Have you got any spinach?"" Mad Mueller runs off to his laboratory and creates his own spinach juice.

Meanwhile, Irving is winning the fight. He pounds Popeye into the floor, as Popeye declares he's lucky to have such a strong head bone. Olive runs back to Popeye and tells him to drink it. ""Thanks, but I doesn't drinksk!"" She tells him it's spinach juice and pours it into his mouth. It immediately ""resuskitates"" him, giving him the strength to knock Irving into a pile of nuts and bolts. ""They just don't makes monskers like they used to.""

""My poor Irving! He is kaput!"" Popeye obligingly puts him back together. But he makes Irving a little too good looking. ""Kiss me!"" says Olive, calling him Alvin. ""But when she does, she is run through with electricity.

Popeye had turned on the power switch. As he turns it off, he says, ""That's my Olive!"" and laughs as the picture fades to black."

They're joined by a dog named Bernie, who despite his appearance, is evidently a St. Bernard. He even carries the requisite barrel of brandy around his neck (though it turns out to be something other than brandy).

Popeye, Swee'Pea and the dog ski down the mountain, but Olive refuses to join, afraid she might ruin her beautiful new raccoon coat. Olive goes skipping along the snowy terrain, picking a stray flower here and there when suddenly she walks behind a tree and emerges without her coat. Enraged, she follows a set of footprints that lead from the tree to a cave, saying ""Grr! Grr!"" every step of the way.

She rings the doorbell of the cave and then sneezes. A miniature avalanche covers her in snow. A mysterious hand from within the cave has a saw, which it uses to cut out a block of ice with Olive inside it.

Later, Popeye, Swee'Pea and Bernie look for Olive. They follow her to the same cave. Popeye rings the doorbell. Swee'Pea sneezes and ends up covered in snow like Olive. The mysterious hand hands Popeye a saw, and Popeye uses it to cut out a block of ice with Swee'Pea inside it. Popeye promises Swee'Pea he'll get him out, but the hand knocks Popeye over the head with a hammer and pulls him and the frozen Swee'Pea inside the cave. The unknown occupant slams the door in the face of Bernie, who pounds on it, trying to get in.

Inside, Popeye is helplessly bound in ropes. He learns the cave belongs to Quasimodo, the Half-Back of Notre Dame (his football helmet and jersey confirm it). He is the official echo in the area, which explains why everyone's echo comes back with a French accent. Quasimodo is delighted with the coat he has stolen from Olive and refuses to give it back. Popeye asks why doesn't he just light a fire. Quasimodo demonstrates the impossibility of it by lighting a fire on a barbecue grill, which melts the icicles hanging from the roof of the cave, which dowse the fire. Quasimodo pours water over Popeye, and promises that everyone will thaw out in the spring. But Popeye sneezes, which causes a real avalanche that covers them all in snow.

Faithful Bernie digs his way into the cave and pours spinach--that was what was really in the barrel--into Popeye's pipe. The spinach revitalizes Popeye, who smashes out of the ice and snow and then punches off the ice that was encasing Olive and Swee'Pea. Olive immediately resumes growling about her stolen fur coat. She finds Quasimodo and snatches the coat away from him. Quasimodo bawls, and Olive, suddenly sympathetic, asks him what's the matter. Quasimodo cries that he'll never be warm again.

But Olive has an idea, which she whispers into Bernie's ear. Bernie zips out on skis and returns in a flash with several barrels of spinach. Quasimodo is thrilled. Popeye sings, ""You'll be warm at the finish / Eatin' your spinach / Says Popeye the sailor man!"""

Bryan sees the handwriting on the wall that the family business is a dead-end job, and if he doesn't escape it soon to go on to greater pursuits, his job will be the death of him. Bryan's miserable life flashes before his eyes as he is cut down by a drive-by shooter. His nightmares are spent wallowing in the futility of opposing his parents, and how Beefy Boy has become more than a second home... but a ball-and-chain.

In the second story, Bryan's girlfriend Karen (Lar Park Lincoln) is also struck down by the same shooter and spends an eternity confronting her fear of hospitals. She keeps alternating between seeing her dead boyfriend, to being shuffled around from room to room by incompetent doctors and nurses, to encountering her killer.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1814409/?ref_=ttep_ep10,,"Monica's return wreaks havoc on the Gallagher clan, while Frank hits a new low to stop a disability worker from tampering with his benefits.",[],TV-MA,Release date,['Adam Bernstein'],"['', '', '']",[],"['vomiting', 'interrupted sex', 'caught having sex', 'bare chested male', 'gay sex', 'snowing', 'theft', 'shot in the leg', 'gunfire', 'gun', 'ex husband ex wife relationship', 'quarrel', 'estranged mother', 'bad mother', 'absent mother', 'truck', 'pancake batter', 'cooking', 'car chase', 'lesbian couple', 'female truck driver', 'flip phone', 'cell phone', 'text message', 'north side chicago', 'sexual favor', 'jealousy', 'drinking beer', 'telephone call', 'pay phone', 'public phone', 'winter', 'teenage mother', 'sex scene', 'internet research', 'split screen', 'library', 'talking after sex', 'male orgasm', 'female orgasm', 'orgasm', 'missionary position', 'sex in a car', 'rear nudity', 'male rear nudity', 'bar', 'one breast exposed', 'implied sex', 'earplugs', 'prayer']",[],"Lip overhears Monica and Roberta plotting in the bathroom....DNA results are coming back soon to prove Liam is not Frank's kid and they'll be able to take him no matter what.

Fiona and Steve are in the new house with a baby monitor to communicate back to the house with all the other kids.

Next morning, Monica is trying to fill in as Fiona. She can't seem to handle the struggle of all the motherly details. Roberta is just barking orders from the table. Fiona is listening to the racket from the window in the next door house and gets irate about how poor of a mother Monica is/was. Steve gives Fiona a cell phone and money for her to go out and buy them a couch.

Roberta tells the kids she and Monica won't be there when they get home from school. Lip stays behind to confront Monica and Roberta about the DNA test. He says there is no way that they're taking Liam and starts to get into it with Roberta. He storms out after Monica stops the confrontation and she runs after him, begging forgiveness. He doesn't fall for her tears (thankfully).

Karen has agreed to go to the Purity Ball so her dad will give her the car. Frank and Shiela argue about Monica. She's jealous and he's....well, he's Frank. He leaves and there's a car following him down the street.

Roberta and Monica are talking in the kitchen between themselves about leaving the next day. Monica is saying how she wants to stay though and finally be a mom. Roberta talks ""sense"" into her and convinces her that leaving after the DNA results come back is the right thing to do. Frank comes in....Roberta tells him he gets no money unless he convinces the kids to get on board with them taking Liam. They threaten him with claiming spousal support, etc...He goes next door to break into Steve and Fiona's house.

V and Fi move a couch into the house and find Frank having broken in, drinking in her kitchen. He screams at her telling her the kids are none of her business - basically he's just interested in the money. He leaves; goes down to Alibi (the bar).

Fiona and V are looking up attorneys dealing with children's rights or adoption, etc. Lip and Ian are sitting in a car watching movement of Roberta and Monica, chatting. Ian explains to Lip that Mickey is gay and they're fooling around on the DL, Cash's wife found out about Ian and Cash and forced him to knock her up again and Mickey is in juve rather than admit he's gay.

DNA results show that Frank is Liam's father....hence, Nana Gallagher had an affair and the genes are actually Frank's to pass on and Monica is still his mother. But Roberta is on a rampage and says they're still gonna get Frank to sign over his parental rights and they leave.

Frank starts messing with the guy in the car who's following him and recording him. Its someone from the insurance company and they're trying to catch him from lying and getting more money from them. He's sitting at home when Carl comes in having hurt himself from a bike trick gone wrong. Frank gets an insurance scam idea and finally is interested in Carl's situation.

Lip and Ian take DNA swabs of their own, hoping to find they aren't Frank's kids.

Frank and Carl stage an accident to make it look like the insurance follower hits Carl on his bike. He actually does and Carl smiles real big knowing he's got another scam going.

Karen is home getting ready for the Purity Ball and Shiela invites Karen's dad to stay for dinner before they leave. Frank is at home with his ""wife"". They take come pictures after and Karen actually looks happy and interested.

Ian goes to juve to talk with Mickey through the glass. Steve gets pulled by Tony the cop. Awkward moment....Tony congratulates Steve on the new house. Steve tries to make small talk. Tony sends a message, basically, to take care of Fiona or else.

Fiona, Lip and Debs confront Frank at Alibi and tell him not to sign anything from Monica regarding his parental rights. Lip punches him and they leave.

At the Purity Ball, girls are confessing their ""sins of the flesh"" in round robin fashion. Also in round robin fashion, all the kids are sitting back at the family home passing a doobie and contemplating the benefits of not actually being Frank's kids. Back at the Purity Ball, its Karen's turn to share her sins and she goes into so much detail or guy and girl ""interaction"" that her father stands up and calls her a whore!!

Lip and Ian's DNA results come back....and good news for Ian - not Franks. Frank is only a bit concerned that Ian isn't his, but its likely that Ian is the child of one of Frank's brothers. Of course, with Monica. A family argument ensues with a bunch of semantics about who left who versus who drove who out, etc etc. Fiona aptly ends the discussion by telling her to get the heck out of dodge - with Bob, without Liam.

Karen comes crying and screaming back home and goes to the cellar to bash in her father's things. Shiela tells him to get out and pushes him outside.....yeah...she goes outside. Where Frank sees her and tells her she's out of the house. She freaks out in a good way and starts waving at the train going by.

The kids are all at Steve's place watching the family house. They see Monica and Bob come out to leave and Monica is carrying Liam. She walks over to the kids and starts to cry. She kisses Liam and hands him to Fiona before retreating to leave for one last time with Roberta. Once again, Fiona is back in charge."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1273629/?ref_=ttep_ep8,,"Baloo's bad spelling hampers Rebecca's attempt to go into the skywriting business. Meanwhile, a notorious criminal uses the skywriting to attempt to send coded messages to his henchmen and hold Cape Suzette for ransom.",[],TV-Y,Release date,['Ed Ghertner'],"['', '', '']",[],"['two word title', 'skywriting', 'spelling', 'friends who live together']",[],"In school, Kit is having trouble spelling the word ""spinach,"" saying he doesn't like eating it, let alone spelling it. Back at Higher for Hire, Kit soaks his aching hand, saying he finally got it right after his ""two zillionth try."" Baloo downplays the importance of proper spelling, saying it's like playing darts -- close is good enough. Rebecca tells Baloo to stop filling Kit's head with nonsense, as Higher for Hire is going into the skywriting business. Baloo tries to discourage Rebecca, but just then a customer walks in requesting some skywriting.

Baloo and Kit take off in the Sea Duck, but when Baloo pulls out the paper that has the message ""Happy Birthday To You"" on it, a gust of wind blows it out of his hand and out of the plane. Kit asks Baloo if he can write the message without the note. Baloo says that ""any idiot can spell 'Happy Birthday.'"" Rebecca uses that same line to scold Baloo when the message gets misspelled as ""Hapee Burthday 2 U."" Baloo says it's the thought that counts. Rebecca says that thanks to Baloo's bad spelling, they won't get another customer.

Just then, another customer by the name of Weazel walks in, asking for the message ""Chicken Soup"" to be skywritten. Though suspicious of Weazel, Baloo goes ahead with skywriting the message, but the note falls out of his pocket as he walks out the door and he misspells the phrase as ""Chicken Soop."" Meanwhile, in Cape Suzette, two bank robbers look up in the sky and see the message. One robber asks who spells ""chicken soup"" with two O's, but the other one says it doesn't matter, it's the second letter of the first word -- H -- that's important. The letter tells the robbers to report to their launch sites.

Weazel goes to his boss, Heimlich Menudo, who explains that he's using skywriting to communicate to his henchmen so that the police can't track him. Meanwhile, Detective Thursday of the Cape Suzette Police Department meets with his men, noting that there hasn't been a major crime in days. He suspects that something's happening, but the criminals are communicating in a unique way that they can't trace.

Back at Higher for Hire, Rebecca scolds Baloo for his bad spelling. Baloo says they aren't getting any complaints, and Rebecca replies that they aren't getting any repeat business either. Weazel then walks in with another message, ""Eat At Joe's,"" which he wants skywritten at exactly 3:00 that afternoon. Confused, Baloo says that Joe went out of business last week. Weazel tells him to skywrite the message anyway, jumping up and down in a mini-tantrum and dropping a code book in the process. After Weazel exits, Baloo finds and picks up the code book.

Baloo and Kit take off to skywrite Weazel's message, but Baloo again loses the message when he tries to read it. Meanwhile, Thursday and one of his men notice the skywriting. Thursday comments that not only is the message oddly spelled, but Joe went out of business last week, and suspects the crooks are using the skywriting to communicate. He orders his men to track down the plane.

When Baloo and Kit return, Rebecca again scolds Baloo for his spelling, saying the way he spells is a crime. Baloo tries to downplay the incident. Thursday shows up, asks if Baloo is the skywriting pilot, then promptly arrests him when he says he is. Thursday takes Baloo and Rebecca to police headquarters, asking about the messages. Baloo confesses to being a bad speller, but Thursday mistakes him as one of the crooks involved. Rebecca tells Thursday that Baloo is telling the truth and asks him to give Baloo a spelling test to prove it.

Meanwhile, Heimlich's henchmen prepare their blimps as they get ready to execute the Heimlich Maneuver. At police headquarters, Baloo fails Thursday's test, but Thursday says he could be faking. Kit shows up with Baloo's report cards and gives them to Thursday, who can't believe how bad Baloo's grades were. Baloo says he proved he was a bad speller, and all he did was write messages for a Mr. Weazel. Hearing Weazel's name, Thursday describes him to Baloo, who confirms they met, showing the code book as evidence. Rebecca says they'll refuse the next time Weazel shows up with a skywriting request, but Thursday tells them to play along now that he has the code book.

As Baloo, Rebecca, Kit, and Thursday leave the station, they see the blimps. Heimlich addresses Cape Suzette through speakers in his blimps, saying he wants all the diamonds in Cape Suzette. Furthermore, the blimps are filled with explosive hydrogen gas -- any attempt to shoot them down will result in Cape Suzette's destruction.

Back in his office, Heimlich learns that the police have refused his demands. He tells Weazel to have the message ""Wait Until Dark"" skywritten. The message will tell the blimps to attack Cape Suzette. Weazel gives the message to Baloo, but after he leaves, Thursday changes it to read ""Weight Until Dark."" Thursday says the new spelling of ""weight"" will tell the blimps to scrub their mission. He tells Baloo that the message has to be spelled correctly and to also maintain radio silence, as the crooks may be listening in. To further ensure Baloo doesn't lose the message, Rebecca firmly attaches it to his shirt, to Kit and Thursday's amusement.

When Baloo and Kit head off to skywrite the message, Kit asks Baloo what the message is. Unable to read the message because Rebecca put it on his shirt upside down (from his point of view), Baloo takes his shirt off, but a gust of wind blows it out the window. Kit asks Baloo if he remembers the code, and after a bit of pondering Baloo remembers ""Weight Until Dark."" They skywrite the first letter, but then Baloo says the word they want is ""weight,"" as in ""how much does it weigh."" Kit asks Baloo how they spell it, confessing that he didn't do his homework because Baloo said spelling wasn't important. Baloo says it's either spelled with an ""e-i"" or ""i-e,"" but can't remember which.

Kit remembers a poem he learned in school -- ""i before e, except after c."" They end up skywriting the word ""wieght,"" which tells the blimps to attack City Hall. Rebecca wonders how Baloo got it wrong, but just then Baloo's shirt -- with the note attached -- falls on Thursday. As Baloo and Kit finish the message, Kit remembers the rest of the rhyme -- ""i before e, except after c, and when sounding like a, as in neighbor or weigh."" Kit helps Baloo correct the message to ""Weight Until Dark,"" and the blimps abort their mission. Heimlich and Weazel fly out to try to stop the blimps, but when that fails, Heimlich attacks the Sea Duck. Baloo uses the skywriting smoke to blind Heimlich and Weazel, and they crash, where they are picked up by Thursday's men. Rebecca and Thursday thank Baloo for his work. Baloo then takes Kit with him to study, saying that when it comes to spelling, ""close is not good enough."""

Concerned for Baloo as his friend, Rebecca learns that the ""accidents"" on Kitten's set are no accidents.",[],TV-Y,Release date,['Larry Latham'],[''],[],"['movie star', 'stunt pilot', 'accidents', 'friends who live together']",[],"Rebecca and Baloo are leaving a restaurant one evening when she starts to lecture him about embarrassing her, then loosens up and starts chuckling when she starts talking about the food fight he started in the restaurant. Baloo tells Rebecca to be careful, as someone might think they're friends. She says that maybe they are.

Just then, Baloo sees a movie set and runs over to get a closer look. He goes nuts when he discovers that the set features Kitten Caboodle, an attractive movie actress. As the cameras roll, a light fixture starts to come loose. Baloo rushes in to help, saving Kitten from the light fixture. Baloo and Kitten are surrounded by paparazzi who take photos, then disappear.

The next morning, Kit rushes into Higher for Hire with a newspaper asking if they've read it, but stops when he sees stacks of newspapers piled around the office. Baloo asks Rebecca if he can get his hands bronzed, and she says she'll get his head bronzed if he doesn't get to work. He accuses her of being jealous. Meanwhile, Kit takes a phone call, telling Baloo that Tantamount Studios wants him to fly a big important stunt in Kitten Caboodle's latest film. Rebecca stops them, asking when they accepted jobs without asking her first. She relents when Kit tells her they're paying ""three big ones"" for the stunt.

Kitten greets Baloo, Wildcat, and Kit, but slams the car door in Rebecca's face. She takes Baloo, Wildcat, and Kit on a studio tour, while Rebecca is forced to follow on foot. Rebecca sees someone in bandages and asks if he's acting in a horror movie. He says he's the cameraman on the Kitten Caboodle movie, saying that there have been a series of accidents on set. Rebecca brushes it off, but has second thoughts when a set facade falls on her and the cameraman, injuring him further but leaving her unscathed.

Rebecca tries to alert Baloo of what she heard, but Kitten interrupts, dragging Baloo off to a private lunch. She tries to tell Kit, but he runs off, saying he has an audition. Just then, she sees another accident, this one happening to the accountant for the Kitten Caboodle film. The accountant tells her that whoever is flying the final stunt is sure to be a goner. Knowing that Baloo is flying the stunt, Rebecca tracks him down, sneaking into the restaurant where he and Kitten are eating. She overhears Baloo telling Kitten that Rebecca is just his boss and dumps a plate of spaghetti on him, getting herself promptly ejected.

Baloo finds Rebecca outside the restaurant. She tells him about the accidents and suggests that someone might be sabotaging the film. Baloo goes to find Kitten to talk to her about the accidents, but she finds him first, seduces him, and takes him away in her limo. Meanwhile, Rebecca does some investigating and overhears the director saying the accidents are causing great publicity for the film. Thinking the director is behind the accidents, she charges into his office and accuses him, but he orders his assistant to get her into costume, thinking she's the actress he hired to do a stunt involving a large mechanical gorilla.

During the filming, the director calls ""cut,"" but his staff is unable to stop the gorilla. He tries to stop it himself, but the set crashes down on him. Rebecca thinks that maybe he isn't the one behind the accidents after all. Just then, she spots a mysterious hooded figure and tries to tell Baloo, but Kitten reappears and drags him off.

Rebecca guards Baloo's stunt plane, eventually falling asleep inside. Meanwhile, Baloo and Kitten are having dinner when Kitten excuses herself. Out at the plane, Rebecca hears a noise and discovers the hooded figure removing some parts from the plane. She chases the figure throughout the studio before finally tackling the figure.

Removing the hood, Rebecca discovers that Kitten is the one behind all the accidents. Kitten says she staged the accidents because she wanted the publicity to revive her sagging career. Rebecca threatens to tell Baloo everything, but Kitten tells her to go ahead, as she has Baloo wrapped around her finger. True to Kitten's words, Baloo refuses to believe Rebecca and heads off to do the stunt. Rebecca follows, and when the director jumps in to ask what's holding everything up, she grabs his megaphone, slams it on Baloo's head, and flies off in his plane.

Removing the megaphone, Baloo grumbles, thinking Rebecca just stole his stunt, but then Kit and Wildcat show up with a part that fell off the stunt plane. Wildcat says that without the part, there's no way Baloo could have done the stunt -- he'd crash. Realizing Rebecca is in danger, Baloo commandeers another plane and flies off to rescue her. Baloo positions his plane and asks Rebecca to grab his hand. She refuses to grab it until they talk, and Baloo asks if they can't wait until they get on the ground.

Rebecca insists they talk now, and Baloo hastily agrees. Rebecca says that Baloo said they were friends, but never treated her like one. Baloo apologizes and asks Rebecca if it's too late to try again. She grabs his hand and escapes just in time. Kitten throws a tantrum, saying Baloo ruined her accident. The paparazzi surround her, taking pictures, as she is hauled off and placed under arrest.

On the ground, Baloo and Rebecca agree to be friends, even if Baloo gets starstruck by an attractive actress. Kit says he was worried about them, but Baloo says they had everything under control. Kit then runs off, saying he has an audition for the new Bumphrey Hogart film. Rebecca, now herself starstruck, tells Kit to wait as she runs after him. Wildcat follows. Groaning, Baloo wonders what's up with them."

To save time, Kit suggests a shortcut -- Mirkl Pass, but Baloo is hesitant to take it, saying the pass got its name because it's a miracle if they make it through. Kit says the other alternative is to get an earful from Rebecca when they return. Baloo decides to take the shortcut, heavily damaging the Sea Duck and causing a piece of equipment to come loose and knock him unconscious. When he recovers, he appears to have no memory of the Sea Duck, Rebecca, or flying.

The next day, Kit, Baloo, and Wildcat go on a cargo run, with Wildcat showing Baloo how to fly. When they encounter a thunderstorm, however, one of the engines becomes damaged. Kit and Wildcat parachute from the plane, but Baloo is unable to follow. He hears a voice on the radio and is able to land the plane with help from the voice on the radio. Upon landing, he meets an old pilot, who tells him he landed just in time -- thirty seconds later, his good engine would have failed and he would have crashed.

Kit and Wildcat manage to land near a town, where they go to get help. Meanwhile, Baloo learns that his new friend is a flying ace named Joe Magee. Joe fixes the Sea Duck and says that the plane is good to go except for the radio. He also says that the only way out is to fly out through an extremely narrow opening, the remnants of a cave-in. Baloo asks if he can get to a phone or a radio, but Joe says there's neither -- the only way out is to fly out.

Baloo tells Joe he forgot how to fly. Joe says Baloo's in luck, as he's running a flying school and can give Baloo a refresher course on how to fly. Joe puts Baloo in a trainer, but when Baloo crashes, he says he'll walk out. Joe says it's 20 miles, plus sagebrush and rattlesnakes, to the next town. Reluctantly, Baloo goes back in the trainer and slowly regains his flying skills.

Joe takes Baloo up in a glider and tells him he's got his skills back, but he's forgotten what flying is about. Baloo remembers the fun he and Kit had when flying and regains both his skills and confidence, but shies away when Joe tells him he's now ready to solo. Baloo heads off in the Sea Duck, but at the last minute turns off before flying through the opening. Meanwhile, Kit and Wildcat look for Baloo, without any success.

The next day, Baloo pretends to be sick, but Joe sees through his deception. Joe pretends to be badly hurt, and when Baloo comes to see him, tells him to get the doctor in town. Baloo manages to fly through the opening and reaches town. Kit and Wildcat see Baloo and manage to climb aboard just as he gets the doctor. Kit realizes that Baloo is able to fly again, but when he asks why, Baloo says he'll explain later.

Baloo returns to Joe's flight school, but finds no sign of Joe. Baloo frantically looks for him, but when the doctor learns that Baloo is looking for Joe Magee, he says that Joe opened the flight school after having been injured in combat. Furthermore, Joe passed away over twenty years ago. Seeing a photo on the bulletin board, Baloo takes it, saying, ""Thanks, Joe.""

As they fly back home, Kit asks Baloo about the photo, which is of Baloo and Joe. Kit asks Baloo if that's a friend of his. Baloo says it's more than a friend -- more like a guardian angel."

Enjoying the ride, Kit asks Baloo if he can fly the plane, but Baloo tells Kit that at 12 years old, he's too young to fly the plane, even though he knows the flight manual and has even done some of the simpler maneuvers, like taxiing.

Baloo and Kit land at Louie's, where Baloo offers to have Louie fix Kit a mango shake. Disappointed with not getting a chance to fly, Kit says he'll wait in the plane instead. While Baloo hangs out with Louie, Kit starts the Sea Duck's engines and taxis around the water. Kit then gives the Sea Duck full throttle, loses control, and slams into a rock in front of Louie's place just as Baloo, Louie, and a Thembrian pilot come out of the bar. Kit apologizes for his actions, and Baloo reminds him that this is why 12-year-olds aren't allowed to fly. Just then, the Thembrian pilot mentions that the flying age has been lowered to 12 in Thembria. Hearing the news, Kit eagerly heads there.

At the Thembrian recruit center, Kit meets Bobbo, a Thembrian kid about his age (and height). Sergeant Dunder brings in the first potential recruit, but Colonel Spigot turns him down, saying that at 5'1"", he's too tall. Next up is Bobbo, who is selected because he's only 3'2"". Kit is also selected as he's only 3'9"" tall.

Spigot addresses the group of kids, saying that they will all be flying in the Great Patriotic Flounder Day Air Show that weekend. He unveils the plane they will be flying -- the ThunderYak. Dunder mentions that the plane looked bigger in the catalog. Spigot pulls him aside and says that the factory delivered the wrong size planes, which is why they had been spending a week recruiting 12-year-olds -- the hope is that the kids will help disguise the planes' real size when they are presented to the Thembrian High Marshal.

Spigot teaches the kids how to salute, then has Dunder instruct them on saluting Thembria's Great Patriotic Flounder. Kit says he wants to fly, causing Spigot to send him to peel turnips instead. Bobbo comes in to check up on Kit, and Kit says that flying was the whole reason he came to Thembria. He tells Bobbo that something's not right and he's going to investigate. Bobbo tells Kit to be careful, as he might get into trouble if he snoops around too much.

Kit makes his way to the roof of the hangar where the planes are kept. He overhears Spigot and Dunder discussing their plans to bolt the planes together, with an experienced midget Thembrian pilot flying the lead plane in the formation. Back in the barracks, Kit tells the others that they won't actually be flying, but when he tries to rally them, they all go back to their bunks. Bobbo says they're only boys, and that flying is too dangerous. Unwilling to accept Bobbo's answer, Kit sneaks back to the hangar, where he climbs into one of the planes and starts the engine. Dunder tries to stop Kit, but he escapes. Surrounded by Thembrian tanks, Kit finally manages to take off, but immediately afterward crashes into the wall surrounding the compound.

Spigot punishes Kit by making him clean all the planes twice. Exhausted, Kit returns to the barracks. Bobbo offers to arrange for Kit's escape, but Kit says he's not going to sneak out... he's going to fly out. Meanwhile, back at Louie's, Baloo receives a postcard from Kit saying that he's going to do a Baloo corkscrew in the big airshow that weekend. Concerned that Kit will seriously injure or kill himself, Baloo heads to Thembria.

At the airshow, Kit tells Bobbo that he's going to detach his plane from the formation, do a Baloo corkscrew, and fly out. Bobbo wishes him luck, and the kids start the planes' engines. Baloo arrives just as the formation takes off. He chases the formation, but crashes into the ceremonial flounder, with its head sticking to the nose of the Sea Duck.

Once airborne, Kit detaches his plane from the formation but almost immediately loses control. He realizes that flying is much harder than it looks. Pursued by Thembrian planes, Baloo uses the flounder head to dispatch them, then helps Kit clear a mountain by giving him directions over the radio. Baloo congratulates Kit, but Kit says Baloo was the one who really did it. Baloo tells Kit that he'll be a great pilot one day, but asks him to land so he can fly them home.

Watching from the ground, Bobbo says he'll always remember Kit as the kid who flew a plane -- sort of. The Thembrian High Marshal overhears Bobbo and sentences Spigot to peeling turnips as punishment."

A-list actor Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins) is performing cowboy-themed stunts with his daughter Janey Howard (Teagan Meredith), a gig he's recently taken up in order to afford alimony payments, as implied by Bob Spencer (Mike Doyle) and Frank (Jamal Thomas). Shortly after finishing his performance and acquiring a slice of birthday cake for his daughter, a nuclear bomb strikes the city of Los Angeles. Janey, seeing the bomb, holds out her thumb to measure the size of the mushroom cloud before being joined by her father, who initially believes the blast to be a large fire. Within seconds, the blast's shockwave shatters all surrounding windows, sending the partygoers into chaos. The Spencers retire to their family bomb shelter, while Cooper grabs Janey and flees on horseback as bombs ignite in the distance.

The show then cuts to Vault 33, 219 years in the future. The audience finds Hank MacLean's (Kyle MacLachlan) daughter, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), sitting before the Vault governing council regarding her application for a breeder from neighboring Vault 32. In an effort to ease her nerves, Hank tells his daughter how he left his native home of Vault 31 to marry her mother and he's been happy ever since. Lucy's cousin, Chester (Dave Register), the vault gatekeeper, attempts to stall the process as he is secretly in love with Lucy, however, Lucy rejects his advances, emphasizing the disastrous effects long-term inbreeding has on future generations. As the door to Vault 32 opens, Overseer Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury) introduces herself alongside Monty (Cameron Cowperthwaite), Lucy's selected breeder. At the wedding, Overseer Hank announces that current studies suggest they will be able to begin repopulating the surface within the next generation. Lucy and Monty retire to their unit, where Monty undresses and initiates sexual intercourse with Lucy. The perspective again changes, this time to Lucy's brother, Norm MacLean (Moisés Arias), who decides to sneak into Vault 32. Inside he discovers an array of dead crops and decaying corpses, causing him to flee. After Lucy and Monty finish, Lucy picks up her Pip-Boy to discover Monty's radiation levels are exceptionally high, suggesting he's from the surface, not a vault. Upon her discovery, Monty slashes Lucy's face, stabs her, and begins to asphyxiate her, before being smashed over the head with a glass pitcher and heavily cut. Lucy, armed with a tranquilizer gun, escapes her suite to discover the entirety of Vault 33 is under attack. Stephanie Harper's (Annabel O'Hagan) husband, Bert (Diego Borborema) is killed during the raid while she is stabbed in the eye with a fork, causing permanent vision loss. During the chaos, Lucy is able to assist her brother in hiding from the raiders, but while helping her brother get into a storage unit she is grabbed by a heavily wounded Monty who attempts to strangle Lucy yet again, before being beaten with a shovel by Hank and drowned in a barrel of vinegar. The Vault-door alarm begins sounding, causing Lucy and her father to run towards the door to Vault 32 where Moldaver and multiple hostages are waiting. Moldaver forces Hank to choose between the hostages or Lucy, however, Hank responds by locking Lucy in a nearby janitorial closet before being tranquilized and abducted by Moldaver's goons. Moldaver tells Lucy she resembles her mother before detonating a bomb rigged to the vault door, starting a countdown. The hostages are able to escape before the bomb detonates while Moldaver and her men escape with Hank. The show then cuts to the vault dwellers conducting necessary tasks around their vault: nursing survivors, composting their dead and repairing destroyed tech. Lucy pleads to the council to send a team of four dwellers to the surface to find her father, however, the idea is instantly rejected, with the idea of opening the door being deemed ""too dangerous,"" however, Norm argues it's because they know they'll lose their power if the overseer returns. With the assistance of Norm and Chet, Lucy is able to escape via the main vault door, tranquilizing Chet to prevent him from following her. Council member Reg McPhee (Rodrigo Luzzi) and resident Davey (Leer Leary) arrive at the door as Lucy is leaving in an unsuccessful bid to get her to stay. As she steps into the desertified ruins of Los Angeles, Lucy is greeted by the countless skeletons of those who attempted to enter the vault the day the bombs fell. As Lucy steps out she gazes upon the Pacific Ocean and the destroyed remnants of the Santa Monica pier.

Shifting narratives once again, the show introduces Maximus (Aaron Moten), a Brotherhood of Steel aspirant. In one of his classes, Cleric Felix (Jacinto Riddick) reveals the Brotherhood's mission to gain a strategic monopoly on all pre-war technology. Maximus, after watching the arrival of a massive Brotherhood airship and seeing dozens of sets of T-60 power armor is overcome with memories of being saved by a Brotherhood night as a child after his hometown was destroyed. Max's friend, Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) is promoted to serve as Knight Titus' squire, however, the following morning Dane suffers a gruesome foot injury after someone places razor blades in his boots. Max is accused of being the perpetrator of this incident, with Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer) assigning him to replace Dane as Titus' squire. Maximus and Taitus are sent to capture Doctor Siggi Wilzig (Michael Emerson), a former Enclave scientist in possession of an artifact valuable to the Brotherhood.

The show changes to follow three bounty hunters tasked with sneaking into a fortress owned by Dom Pedro. The group's leader, Honcho (Mykelti Williamson) reveals the men are attempting to rescue a bounty hunter being held captive by Pedro. The hunters find the buried coffin of the prisoner and begin to unearth it, placing a caged chicken nearby in case the captured hunter has turned feral, as ferals will attack the chicken before attacking them. Once the hunters finish digging, they unseal the coffin, revealing a glorified Cooper Howard. Honcho proposes Cooper work with him and his two men in order to secure Moldaver's bounty, the same artifact the Brotherhood is in search of, with Honcho mentioning the ghoul has ties to Los Angeles. Enraged by the mention of California, Howard kills Honcho's two men before pushing Honcho into his coffin, leaving him to die. Howard then embarks towards California on his own, set on securing Moldaver's bounty."

No blackboard joke or couch gag.

Act One:

The episode begins as Homer hastily drives Marge and Maggie, in the family car, through snow covered streets. They are late for Bart and Lisa's Christmas pageant at the school. Once at the school, Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats; everyone looks on stage at the pageant that has already begun. Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduces the second grade The does a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world, and Lisa steals the show as Towanga, the Santa Claus of the South Seas. Cut to Skinner introducing the fourth grade singing a medley of Christmas carols. As they all sing Jingle Bells, Bart can be heard singing rude, alternate lyrics to the song(Jingle Bells, Batman Smells) and Principal Skinner quickly yanks him from the performance with intent for a vicious reprimand. Homer is upset that Bart has once again misbehaved at the Christmas pageant by embarrassing his family, although Marge took no notice of it. The pageant continues on, as a bored Homer wonders aloud how long the pageant will last.

Afterwards, at the Simpson home, Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards, as Homer gets out Christmas decorations, and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists. In the letter Marge describes how everyone is doing and as she reads the letter in her head the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names. Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists. However, Marge is upset when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas and hoped that Bart's letter would make more sense. However, she's dismayed and insulted when he proves to be just as unreasonable as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo. Both Homer and arge refuses to allow him to get one until he's old enough and making his own money. Just then Marges sister Patty calls; a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans for getting together on Christmas Eve.

Cut to Homer, who is outside putting the finishing touches on the Christmas lights on the roof, as the kids watch from the sidewalk. After Homer falls from the roof, he calls out to Marge plug the lights in. Only a few of the lights actually light up, and Homer admires his handy work, while the kids are less than impressed. Ned Flanders is also outside, and ready to plug in his lights for the first time, he calls out to Homer and tells him to check it out. As he plugs the lights in his entire house lights up, including a talking Santa Claus on the roof. The lights illuminate everyones face and much to Homers dismay; his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights.

At breakfast the next morning, Marge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the mall. As the excited kids run off to get their money, Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings. She makes him turn around and she pulls a big jar of money out of her hair. Homer is impressed at the amount of money they have for Christmas this year. Later at the mall, as Marge, Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together; Bart is off by himself, and comes across a tattoo parlor. In the window, he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word mother written across it. He daydreams that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo, so he runs inside the parlor, lies to the tattoo artist about his age, and hops into the chair.

Meanwhile, at the nuclear power plant, Mr. Burns announces over the loud speaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers; this includes Homer. Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents.

Back at the mall, Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo halfway finished on his arm. She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to a tattoo removal clinic. The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front. Marge has to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal, but she sighs when she remembers they still can use Homers Christmas bonus. Back at home, Marge tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out. She tells him to calm down, and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus a little further this year. Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus, he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk. Once outside he looks up at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece. A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair.

Act Two:

That night in bed, Marge senses something is amiss with Homer and she asks what is wrong. Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus, but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping, so she doesnt have to. Marge agrees and seems satisfied that there is nothing wrong and they both go to bed. The next day Homer does some Christmas shopping alone at a cheap thrift store. He purchases pantyhose for Marge, pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie. On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned who has an armful of fancily wrapped packages. All the presents are spilled onto the ground, and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought, he becomes sad and depressed and heads over to Moes. At Moes, Homer drinks a beer alone, when a cheerful Barney walks in wearing a Santa Claus suit. Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a part time job acting as Santa Claus at the mall. Homer suddenly has an idea. Cut to the personnel office in the mall, as Homer fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa. After reviewing Homers application, and interviewing him, the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training s. A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues.

Homer finally makes it home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been. Homer ignores her and heads upstairs, but Marge tells him that her sisters are here and that he needs to visit with them. As Homer talks with Patty and Selma, they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet. Homer tells them he was just on his way out to get one, and he angrily hurries out the door. In the car, Homer drives past several expensive Christmas tree lots and finally stops at a private tree farm and uses a chain saw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family. Back at home, Homer stands up the tree, and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma. On Christmas Eve at the mall, Homer works as Santa Claus, while children wait in line to sit on his lap. From a distance, Bart and Milhouse watch the kids line up to sit on Santas lap, they comment on how they cant believe that these kids are falling for the fake Santa bit. Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees. Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap. Not knowing that Santa is really Homer, Bart yanks off his beard. Bart is shocked at what he has uncovered, and an angry Homer escorts Bart inside Santas workshop to speak with him in private. Homer explains the situation to Bart, who understands and feels bad for yanking off Homers beard. At the end of the Homers shift, Bart goes with Homer as he picks up his check. Homer is surprised to learn that he has only made 13 dollars. When he questions the cashier, she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit, social security, and etc. While a depressed Homer sits down to figure out what to do with the 13 dollars, an excited Barney tells Homer that he is going to the dog track to place a bet with his 13 dollars. He invites Homer to come along with him, Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go, citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family Christmas.

Act Three:

Back at the Simpson home everyone including Patty, Selma and Grandpa Simpson, wait for Homer and Bart to come home. Cut to the dog track, where Barney gives Homer a tip on a dog named Whirlwind. After seeing what Whirlwind looks like, Homer is reluctant to bet on him. Just then an announcement plays over the P.A. system, announcing that a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing another dog in the fourth race. Homer senses that the announcement is an omen, and decides to bet on him even though Bart recommends not to, and despite the fact that the odds are 99 to 1. Homer puts down all 13 dollars on Santas Little Helper. Meanwhile at home, Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer, while everyone still waits for him and Bart. Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race. As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper, but Whirlwind, Barneys pick, is out to an early lead with Santas Little Helper bringing up the rear. Homer and Bart quickly realize their chances at winning any money are dashed, as Santas Little Helper doesnt even finish the race. Cut to Homer and Bart, out in the parking lot of the dog track, looking for discarded betting slips hoping to find that someone has thrown away a winner. Barney drives by in a convertible with a woman in the passenger seat, and gloats to Bart and Homer about his pick for the race: Whirlwind.

A dejected Bart and Homer head back to their car, when off in the distance they see a racing dog owner yelling and chasing off Santas Little Helper for losing once again. Santas Little Helper jumps up into Homers arms. Bart asks to keep Homer if they can keep the dog. Homer, reluctant at first, quickly warms up to the dog and decides to take him home. Cut back to the Simpson home, where everyone still awaits Bart and Homers return. Suddenly, a sad looking Homer enters in and starts to confess to everyone about the fact that he didn't receive his Christmas bonus, and apologizes for the lack of presents; when Bart bursts in, along with a barking Santas Little Helper. Everyone falls in love with the dog, and Homer realizes that in the end he has done a good job providing gifts at Christmas.

End Credits: The credits roll as the entire Simpson family including Patty, Selma, and Grandpa Simpson, sing Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Near the end of the song, Homer ends up strangling Bart for adding unofficial, rude alternate lyrics to Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer."

Couch gag: The family runs in and sits on the couch, Bart is squeezed out and up into the air and doesnt come down until the camera cuts to the TV.

Act One:

The episode begins as the Simpson family plays Scrabble, in the living room, in an effort to build Bart's vocabulary for his aptitude test tomorrow at school. The game ends when Bart cheats and makes up an imaginary word, Kwyjibo, and defines it as, A big, dumb, balding, North American ape with no chin. Homer is instantly angered and chases Bart out of the room.

The next day before class, in the schoolyard, Martin Prince, the school genius aside from Lisa, tattles on Bart, for spray painting graffiti that defames Principal Skinner on the school building(Principal Skinner, ""I Am A Weiner"" even though he misspelled weiner with wiener). Skinner orders Bart to see him after school. As the children file into class, Mrs. Krabappel hands out aptitude tests to everyone. When she instructs the class on taking the timed intelligence test, Martin raises his hand, and reminds her that Bart is supposed to face the window during any test so he cant cheat. A grumbling, Bart turns his desk to face the window and the test begins. In an attempt to figure out a lengthy math word problem, Bart tries to visualize the problem so he can solve it. The visualization turns into a daydream and when Bart finally comes back to reality, Martin announces that he has finished his test already. Mrs. Krabappel sends Martin outside to read a book, during the remainder of the testing period. While Bart is still taking his test, he looks out the window to see a smug Martin sticking his tongue out at him. In retaliation, Bart makes faces back at Martin; Mrs. Krabappel spots Bart making faces and looks out the window to see what Bart is looking at. While her back is turned, Bart, who is seated at the front of the class, reaches over to Mrs. Krabappels desk and steals Martin's test, replaces his name with Bart's own own and then puts the test back on her desk. Bart then quickly fills out random answers on his own test and then writes Martin's name at the top and turns it in.

Later, after school, Marge and Homer are called to Principal Skinners office for a meeting about Barts behavior at school. Skinner informs Marge and Homer about Barts graffiti from earlier that morning. As he reaches for Barts rather extensive permanent record, and is about to suggest something along the lines of expulsion for Bart, his secretary buzzes in and says that Dr. J. Loren Pryor, the school psychiatrist is waiting to see him. Dr. Pryor walks in on the meeting, and surprises everyone when he tells them that Bart is a gifted child, and according to the aptitude test from earlier, Bart has an I.Q. of 216. Dr. Pryor suggests that Barts history of bad behavior stems from a lack of interest in his school work, due to the fact that it is too easy for him. Skinner wants Bart retested, but when Dr. Pryor suggests moving Bart to a school for gifted children Skinner jumps on board with the idea, and Bart quickly agrees when he hears that the school doesnt have much structure and that you get to make your own rules. Dr. Pryor hands Bart some paperwork for the gifted children school, and he, Homer and Marge leave the meeting stunned.

Act Two:

The next morning at the breakfast table, Marge and Homer hover around their new genius child and Homer tells Lisa to start eating what Bart eats for breakfast, so she can become a genius too. Unfortunately for him, she isn't fooled by Bart and knows that he is still just a dimwit. She mentions that no aptitude test can change the awful truth that he cheated by copying off of Martin Prince.

After breakfast, Homer takes Bart to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children. Once inside the school they find Barts class, and after peeking in, they see that all the boys are wearing ties. So Homer gives Bart the tie he is wearing, and he gives Bart a little pep talk about his first day at the new school and shoves him in the classroom door. Once inside the class, Ms.Melon, the teacher introduces herself and the new classmates to Bart and shows him around the classroom. She tells Bart about the independent learning and that the only rule is for him to make his own rules. Class begins with a debate on the topic of free will and the paradoxes that it creates; Bart struggles to understand the discussion. Later at lunch, his classmates realize that Bart isnt really that smart when he accepts their ridiculously uneven trade offers. (Ex: 1000 Pico liters of milk for 4 gills worth. A gill is much, much larger than a Pico liter.) He dejectedly walks away from the lunch table as the other kids laugh at him since he's the laughing stok of the school. Bart soon comes to regret cheating off of Martin during the aptitude test.

Act Three:

After school, Bart relaxes in his room, when Homer walks in to see about his first day at the new school. Homer suggests they all go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes and Bart agrees. Just then Marge walks by, and tells Homer and Bart that she bought tickets to the opera in an effort to try to help nurture his brain, even though Lisa has previously warned her not to because she still suspects Bart cheating off of Martin. Despite that, she went through with her mother's plan to see if he would crack under pressure and confess to the family. Later during the opera, a bored and impatient Homer and Bart goof off and cut each other up, even though they are continually shushed by an upset Marge.

Cut to the next day at school where Bart feels even more stupid and left out when he cant understand a calculus problem on the chalkboard. Later, as he sadly walks home from school, he passes by the playground of his old school, where Richard, Lewis, and Milhouse are shooting marbles. When Bart greets them and tries to talk to them, they treat him like a nerd, call him names and tell him to get lost. Cut to later at dinner, as a depressed Bart eats, Marge reminds everyone that they cant be late for the film festival that she bought tickets for, as another way to nurture Bart's brain. He is reluctant to go to the festival and Homer tells him they dont have to. Just as Bart is about to tell Homer what is on his mind and confess about the false I.Q. test, Homer insists on going outside to play catch. After playing catch, Bart sees how much being a genius means to Homer and decides not to confess about what he has done, out of fear of disappointing him.

The Final Act:

The next day at the gifted children school, while performing a chemistry experiment, Bart accidentally causes an explosion, which results in green goo everywhere. Cut to Dr. Pryors office, where a green stained Bart meets, with Dr. Pryor. They discuss the reasoning behind his recent failings at the new school, and Dr. Pryor thinks that once again Bart isnt being challenged enough, while Bart suggests that he just go back to Springfield Elementary again. When Dr. Pryor wants to know why, Bart makes up an excuse and tells him that he would like to go undercover and study regular kids and their school environment, to see what makes em tick. Dr. Pryor agrees and tells Bart to write up a proposal to present to Principal Skinner while he goes to talk to him. Bart struggles to write a proposal and instead changes his mind and writes his confession. When Dr. Pryor comes back in the office and reads Barts confession he suddenly realizes that he was never a genius to begin with and Martin was the genius all along.

Later at home, a still green stained Bart greets his parents and Homer offers to give him a turpentine bath to wash off the green. Out in the backyard, as his father gives him a bath, Bart confesses about cheating on the aptitude test and tells Homer that he loves him and that he has enjoyed the extra attention from being a genius. He tells Homer that he doesnt think something that has brought them closer than they ever were before could be bad. But, Homer doesnt see it his way, and he chases Bart out of the tub, trying to choke him. Bart is too quick for Homer and runs into his bedroom and locks the door. An angry Homer pounds on Barts door, and tries to coax him to come out, while Bart taunts him from inside his room. Everything is back to normal in the Simpson home."

During the trip, Bart sees Homer, and gets his attention. However, this causes Homer to crash the cart he's driving, causing a major mishap at the plant. Homer's Supervisor then has Homer fired for his negligence.

Homer attempts to find another job in the wake of his firing, but all his attempts lead to nothing. Feeling he's a failure, Homer attempts to throw himself off the Springfield bridge. However, his family finds out about his attempt, and rush to his aid...almost getting hit by a car! In the aftermath, Homer then declares that the intersection they were at is dangerous, and needs a stop sign.

Homer next appears before the city council, and gets his stop sign proposal passed. This then leads to Homer becoming safety-conscious, and eventually, leading a group to protest better safety conditions at the Nuclear Plant.

This catches the attention of the plant's owner, C Montgomery Burns, who requests an audience with Homer. Burns is willing to make Homer in charge of safety at the plant, if he will tell the crowd that the plant is actually safe. Homer considers this, but claims that to say that would violate his moral principles. This impresses Burns enough that he is willing to give Homer the position, and Homer tells his followers outside about his good fortune, as they cheer him on."

He tells them to get the bad behavior out of their system, because they are going to Mr. Burns' company picnic, and he doesn't want his family to embarrass him in front of Mr. Burns.

When the family arrives at Mr. Burns' mansion for the picnic, Homer once again reminds his family that they have to behave in a normal manner. Bart and Lisa quickly run off to play in the water fountain and Homer chases after them leaving Marge and Maggie behind. Another woman carrying a baby approaches Marge and suggests to place the babies in the nursery and grab a drink together. Marge is reluctant of drinking, but then after seeing Homer chase Bart and Lisa around the backyard, she chooses to have a glass of punch.

It's soon time for the father-son sack race, and Homer pressures Bart to not have them beating Mr. Burns. Meanwhile, Marge is conversing with all the wives of the workers; she becomes tipsy from the amount of punch she drank. Back to the sack race, where Smithers gives Mr. Burns a head start and then fires the starting gun. Mr. Burns is out in front of everyone, when suddenly Bart plans to make a break for the finish line. Homer quickly hops up ahead and tackles Bart just short of the finish line, allowing Mr. Burns to finish first. Meanwhile, Marge, intoxicated, leads all the women in a song and dance number, when Homer, runs by and is shocked at Marge's behavior. He quickly whisks her away from the punch and tells her to keep it together because Mr. Burns is about to give a toast.

Everyone at the picnic gathers as Mr. Burns gives a toast, he thanks everyone for coming, but tells them all to leave immediately as he threatens to release the hounds in ten minutes. Everyone heads out, and Homer notices the family ahead of them; the son gives the father a kiss and tells him he had a great time. Mr. Burns is impressed by this family, but is insulted by Homer's pathetic attempt to gain his favor. Later on, Homer confronts the man from the ""perfect"" family ahead of him and tells him he can stop the fake cornball routine. However, the man reveals his family are actually nice normal people in real life and don't act like this only at gatherings. When the man admits pitying him, Homer finally realizes the truth--that his own family has a problem (evident when Marge, Bart and Lisa misbehave and is embarrassed by it).

The next day, Marge and the kids eat TV dinners in the living room and watch TV together when Homer walks in and plans that tonight they are all going to eat at the dinner table like a normal family. At the dinner table, the rest of the Simpsons are not taking Homer's attempt to get them to eat like a normal family seriously and continue eating like cavemen. During his prayer, Homer expresses his dissatisfaction with his troubled family's behavior and ponders why he was cursed with those who disrespect him. When Marge and the kids claim there is nothing is wrong with the family, Homer chooses to prove that there is something wrong with them. He leads the family in a tour around the neighborhood, peeking into random houses to observe their neighbors' normal family life. However, the rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior in the tour. Marge tells him that she thinks the trip is unnecessary because she and the kids feel like stalkers in invading their entire neighborhood's privacies with their families. They quickly retreat to the safety of their own home to continue watching TV.

Depressed by this matter, Homer visits Moe's Tavern for a drink and to get away from his problems. Two patrolmen enter the bar, claiming they received reports of a neighborhood stalker. The dog suspects Homer and growls at them to pay attention. Luckily for him, the two cops are too dumb to notice anything and drag the dog away. After getting into a brief fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees ""family bliss or double your money back"". and he gets an idea to make his family normal.

Marge and the kids watch an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon when Homer walks in the living room and announces he has made an appointment at Dr. Monroe's Family Therapy Center. The family is reluctant to the idea, but Homer is on a mission to make his family better. Marge tries to claim that there's still nothing wrong with their family, but Homer doesn't listen.

The therapy treatment begins as Dr. Monroe brings them into another room and sits them down. He encourages them each to draw a picture that represents the source of their unhappiness. Most of the Simpsons vent their anger out by drawing Homer as they see him, while Homer gets lost in the exercise by drawing airplanes dropping bombs on his family. When Dr. Monroe sees this, he points out to Homer that had he been paying attention, he would've known his family sees him as an abusive and stern disciplinarian. Monroe also calls him an ogre, a word that Marge and Lisa disagree with, claiming ogre is too much. Bart agrees with Monroe, making Homer furious enough to attack him. Dr. Monroe calms Homer down and asks the family to try different exercises, ex. the foam padded aversion mallets that Bart turns into a hard weapon by removing the foam padding from his mallet and striking Dr. Monroe with it. Soon, Dr. Monroe sees that the Simpson family is not responding to conventional treatment, so his next exercise becomes different. He places each of the Simpsons in their own chair, hooked up to deliver an electric shock. Each chair has buttons that when pressed will deliver an electric shock to another corresponding chair. With all of the Simpsons strapped in, Dr. Monroe instructs them only to shock someone else if that person hurts them emotionally. However, the family members quickly start shocking each other over minor slights, and then things go totally off the rails when Maggie starts hitting all the buttons at random, leading to a power brownout across the entire city, much to Mr. Burns' joy as this increased use of electricity means more money for his company.

Dr. Monroe soon tires of the Simpsons and tries to remove them from his office, but Homer refuses to leave until he gets double his money back (it was $250 to attend a session, so it would be $500 that Homer is asking for). Dr. Monroe, at first refuses, but then, seeing as how the family acted as one, he gives Homer the money and tells them to leave and never tell anyone they were ever there. The family leaves, then uses the money to buy a new TV (the old one was cashed in to help pay for the session), seeing as how they reconnected with each other."

Cut to Homer shopping at the mall for a present.

Back at the house Marge is on the phone with her sisters Patty and Selma talking about Homer's lousy gift giving history and deciding on where to go for her birthday dinner. At the mall, Homer eyes up a bowling ball and has an idea. Cut back to the house where Homer hides Marge's present and she informs Homer about dinner at The Singing Sirloin with the kids and her sisters which makes him shiver in disgust. Later at the restaurant, she receives a bottle of French perfume from Bart and a dried macaroni art piece from Lisa. She loves both and thanks her children for her gifts, Bart for buying her an expensive perfume that she wanted and Lisa for her home made art. When it comes time for Homer to give Marge, his present. His present is a thoughtless gift, a bowling ball complete with drilled holes and his name engraved on it drops onto her cake.

However, Patty and Selma aren't surprised by it and knew that he had been thoughtless again.

Act Two:

Back at the house, before going to bed, Homer tries to defend his reasoning for getting Marge the bowling ball. She doesn't buy it and decides to go ahead and use the bowling ball just to spite him for his insensitive gift. Homer is upset because his plan for a new bowling ball has now backfired. The next day at Barney's Bowlarama, Marge goes bowling by herself and clearly does not know what she is doing. A French accented man named Jacques, bowling in the lane next to her, comes over and offers bowling lessons to her and she accepts. It is clear that Jacques is to trying to seduce Marge and she is very flattered.

Back at the house Homer does his fatherly duties and provides pizza for dinner and puts the kids to bed. Later on with everyone asleep, Marge finally comes home. When she tells Homer she will be going bowling again the next night he becomes suspicious but doesn't say anything to her about it.

Bart doesn't understand and denies the situation even exists.

At brunch with Jacques, Marge is visibly nervous about being seen with another man, and Helen Lovejoy, the Reverend's wife, and local gossip, stops by to chat. She starts feeling even more uncomfortable, and when Jacques asks her to meet with him at his apartment she faints. During her fainting spell, she dreams about the encounter with Jacques at his apartment. In the dream, Marge in a gown and Jacques in a tux dance together and just as Jacques leans in for a kiss, she wakes up from her dream.

When he admited to her she was right, Lisa does rub it in his face before advising Bart to talk to their father about his problems. He offers Homer some advice and tells him to keep his mouth shut to Marge about the situation and maybe it won't get any worse. The next morning while she is making the kids lunches for school, Homer tells her how much he likes her sandwiches and mentions he doesn't believe in keeping feelings bottled up inside. Marge is touched by his words as he heads out to go to work.

While doing so, he finds he has one cherry bomb left.

Taking it to school, he flushes it down a toilet in the boy's room. The explosion causes the toilet's to backflow in both the boy's and girl's rooms. It just so happens that Principal Skinner's mother (who is visiting her son) was in the girl's room at the time and is injured when a geyser of water launches her off the commode.

Principal Skinner takes Bart home where he has a talk with Homer and Marge. Feeling any normal form of punishment will not do, he suggests deportation, or to put it in other terms, making Bart part of a student exchange program for several months in France. Bart eagerly agrees to go, and is soon jetted off to France.

However, the family that is taking Bart in are actually a pair of French crooks. Bart is soon subjected to backbreaking and tedious work on their winery, as they starve him, make him sleep on the floor and sell off almost all of his things.

Meanwhile, the Simpsons have accepted an Albanian exchange student into their household, named Adil Hoxha. Adil proves to be a considerate boy, but secretly is an Albanian spy, who begins sending coded messages to his country regarding Springfield's Nuclear Plant, tricking Homer into taking him to the plant. Sensing that unlike Bart, Adil is interested in his work, Homer happily shows the boy restricted equipment and areas, which Adil photographs.

Back in France, Bart notices his exchange family adding anti-freeze in their wine to age it more rapidly. They force Bart to drink a small amount to prove that it won't hurt him before sending him out to buy more anti-freeze. Bart attempts to ask an officer for help, but gets nowhere when the Gendarme doesn't understand his English. As Bart wanders away, he suddenly begins to speak French, after having been immersed in the culture. Bart talks again to the Gendarme and explains about what the men have been doing. They are arrested, and Bart is considered a hero for his efforts.

In Springfield, Adil is soon caught by the authorities, and sent back to Albania...exchanged for a young American spy who was doing the same over there.

As Adil leaves, Bart returns, bearing gifts for his family. They all agree it's great to see Bart back, as Homer struggles with a bottle of French champagne, complaining ""that some wise guy stuck a cork in the thing.""

Bart then (in French) claims that his father is ""a buffoon,"" leading Homer to happily proclaim that Bart now speaks French (unaware of the insult that was just laid on him)."

Homer relays why he's unhappy to buy ice cream is because he and his family has to watch a slide show starring none other than his sisters-in-law, whom he unlovingly dubs them the ""Gruesome Twosome"". He and Apu laugh for a bit unaware that Krusty is standing behind him with a mask covering his eyes. When he's about to leave, Homer accidentally steps on his clown shoes. This causes Krusty to curse at Homer for not watching where he was going in stepping on his foot. Just before he had a chance to apologize, he sees that Krusty is armed with a gun and quickly jumps in the pile of potato chips in terror as he witness the clown rob Apu at gunpoint.

Cut quickly to the Simpson house, as the rest of the family watches Patty and Selma's slides. Cut back to Homer, who gives a description of Krusty to the police. Meanwhile at Krusty's apartment, he's relaxing with a drink when a SWAT team busts down his door and take him into custody. At the police station, Homer identifies Krusty as the armed robber. He finally makes it home just as the news report about Krusty's arrest comes on the air. While watching the news, Marge is embarrased that he called her sisters that on National TV. However, it was Patty and Selma that were infuriated him for calling them that on the security cam of the Kwik-E-Mart. Bart is devastated that his idol Krusty could have done such a thing. Marge tries to tell him that it was a misunderstanding, but Homer is convinced that he guilty and wants his son to see it the same way. However, a devistated Bart refuses to believe that Krusty's guilty without proof.

Act Two:

On the news, Kent Brockman reports on the upcoming trial and history of Krusty the Clown including the fact that Krusty has a pacemaker. Reverend Lovejoy calls for a public burning of all Krusty merchandise. The next day, as Krusty walks up the steps to the courthouse Bart and Lisa watch in disbelief and they noticed that Krusty has small feet. Inside the courtroom during the trial, even after he begs his father not to, Homer points him out to the jury as the armed robber.

Later back at the house, Homer and a reluctant, Marge gather up all the Krusty merchandise in the house and head to the public burning. An irate and hurt, Bart watches as the pile of merchandise goes up in flames. Marge tries to sympathize with him, but Homer will have none of it and convinces him to join the winning team. Bart angrilly refuses his father's demand and tells him off he will prove Krusty's innocence even if it means going against his wishes. The next day at the trial, it is revealed after being asked to identify some evidence that Krusty is illiterate. Later, the jury reaches a guilty verdict.

At the Simpson house, Lisa and Maggie watch Sideshow Bob who has now taken over for Krusty on TV with a more scholastic affair. When Bart walks in and sees this, he is upset. Lisa tells him that he should be thankful that Sideshow Bob is keeping the Itchy and Scratchy show. Bart quickly snaps and tells her off that he knows that Krusty is innocent for a crime he didn't commit. He convinces Lisa to help him prove his innocence by going to the Kwik-E-Mart, which was the scene of the armed robbery the night Homer had to get some ice cream for Patty and Selma's slide show of their vacation, because she's smart and he needs her.

Bart and Lisa go to the Kwik-E-Mart to examine the crime scene after they convinced a reluctant Apu, they just need to look around. They immediately noticed that the microwave at the check-out counter that has a sign warning that people with pacemakers and clown shoes should keep away. Lisa recalls that in the security camera footage Krusty was reading a magazine, but that couldn't be true since he is illiterate, even remembering a ""Get Well Soon"" card she and Bart given him. She also recalls that while she watching the footage, she noticed that when Homer had previously stepped on the robber's clown shoes, he adamantly yelped in pain and he cursed at their father for his clumsiness in not watching where he was going. That was an indication that the robber had big feet, not small ones like Krusty has. Lisa finally realises Bart was right all along about Krusty the Clown in being framed for a crime he didn't commit and was innocent the whole time.

Cut to Sideshow Bob who after just finishing taping of his show enters his changing room and emits an evil diabolical laugh, knowing that Krusty is now in jail for the armed robbery he did.

Act Three:

At the television studio Bart, Lisa, and Maggie pay a visit to Sideshow Bob, he dismisses them because his show is about to start, but he offers them free tickets. While in Bob's room, they noticed his enormous feet. In the audience, a visibly saddened Bart watches the show. When Sideshow Bob notices his sadness he invites him on stage for a new psychological segment called Choices. While on stage, Bart reveals he is sad because he thinks that Krusty was framed and wrongfully jailed. However, Sideshow Bob tries to convince him otherwise and as he continues talking to Bart and the audience, he confesses that he has ""big shoes to fill."" as he replaced the Krusty the Clown Show.

The phrase ""Big shoes,"" echos through Bart's mind as he remembers that Homer stepped on the thief's foot and he yelped in pain, yet Krusty has small feet. On the other hand, Sideshow Bob has large feet and he realises the truth. His sidekick on the now cancelled ""Krusty The Clown Show"" show was truly responsible for the armed robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart that night.

Bart's emotions immediately changes from sadness into anger, embarrassment and irriation as he rightfully levels his accusation towards Sideshow Bob. Then, he jumps to his feet, snatches the microphone from Bob and faces the kids in the audince. Bart makes a truthful and heartfelt announcement to the audience that Krusty didn't rob the Kwik-E-Mart that night, his sidekick, Sideshow Bob, framed him and has evidence to show it. He proves it well by whomping Bob's feet with a comedy mallet causing him to fall down to the floor and grabbing his feet in pain. The kids are disgusted and horrified by the truth as Sideshow Bob angrilly continued cursing at him on the air, as indication to the words utter on the security cam footage. Bart honestly continued relaying that even though Krusty had worn clown shoes on his show all the time, he always has little feet like all good hearted people. He also mentions that Bob had the most to gain in framing him for the armed robbery by filling his hero's clown shoes with ""his big feet"". To prove his point, Bart removes Sideshow Bob's clown shoes to reveal his big, ugly feet on the air, angering him further.

At the Springfield Police Station, Chief Wiggim and the police officers are seen eating donuts and are watching the show. While they were watching Bart's announcement on Sideshow Bob's new show, they realized that he was right because they missed one key piece of evidence that could've kept Krusty out of jail. After watching the show to hear his heartfelt, truthful accusation and his proof of evidence, Chief Wiggim orders the officers to go down to the studio and arrest Sideshow Bob for the Kwik-E-Mart Armed Robbery.

The final act:

At the studio parking lot, Sideshow Bob is humilated and moritified beyond belief as he's arrested and handcuffed by the police. He immediately, although iratedly, confesses to his crime in committing the armed robbery at the Kwik-E-Mart on the night Homer witnessed it. He dramatically reveals that he framed Krusty for the armed robbery, because he couldn't stand being the constant victim to the clown's antics: including all of his pranks on the show, just to garner more ratings. Sideshow Bob felt his intelligence was being wasted away and wanted ""The Krusty The Clown Show"" gone because he wanted to make a more scholastic show where his intelligence can be appreciated, rather than laughed at and considered a joke. While he was being taken away to jail, Sideshow Bob swears a personal vendetta against Bart and warn those to treat children like equals because they're people who were smart to catch him and they'll be smart to catch them too.

Later at the Springfield Prison, Krusty's released from prison and he's in full clown make up as everyone cheered for him. Immediately, Homer and all the other residents of Springfield gave him a heartfelt apology for their poor judgment against him. He eventually forgives them for their misjudgment. However, Krusty thanks Bart for his help, since he was the only one who beleived in his innocence. He knew that his faith for him never waivered and kept supporting him thoughout the tough times he was in jail.

The handshake is captured in a photo, which Bart proudly tacks on his wall of his bedroom. The picture is inscribed in shaky handwriting, ``To my best pal Bart, Krusty''. That night, Bart goes to bed much happier in his newly refurnished bedroom, with all the Krusty the Clown merchandise(that his hero gave out for free)."

Couch Gag: The family runs in and sits on the couch, nothing happens.

Act One:

The episode begins with the family eating breakfast in the morning. Just as the school bus pulls up, Bart and Lisa run off to get on the bus. Marge asks them not to forget about the special lunches she made for them. Lisa tells her it's ok as she and Bart took money from their father's wallet for their lunch. Homer looks down at his watch and realizes he is late for work. When Marge leans in for a kiss, Homer is oblivious to her, and instead drinks the last of his coffee. He quickly hurries away, leaving her feeling depressed and with a mess in the kitchen. As she sits in the kitchen she hears an ad on the radio for a call-in therapy talk show hosted by Dr. Marvin Monroe. Marge decides to call, and she explains to him that she feels Homer doesn't appreciate her anymore and that he isnt romantic like he used to be. Dr. Monroe tells Marge to give him an ultimatum when he comes home from work: either he starts loving you or you leave him. Meanwhile, at the power plant, everyone laughs at Homer as they are all listening to the call on the radio.

After school, Bart plays a prank call on Moe's Tavern and asks him for Al Coholic. Once Moe calls for Al Coholic, the bar denizens quickly laugh at him and he threatens mayhem to whoever prank called him. Bart and Lisa both laugh as he hangs up the phone. Homer just happens to be there, because he is too afraid to come home to an angry Marge and eats a pickled egg. He asks Barney and Moe for their opinion, if he's a loveless dirtbag who likes taking his wife for granted and mistreats her. They both agree he is, since they heard Marge's call in radio to Dr.Monroe about her complaints towards him in not loving her. Homer asks Moe for advice on how to be more romantic towards her. Moe tells him to buy her some flowers, take her out to dinner and spend the evening at a motel with her. Homer takes his advice and heads to the flower shop. He purchases a rose and chcolates for her. Back at the house Marge gets madder by the minute waiting for Homer to come home. Bart, Lisa and Maggie wisely stays away from their irate mother as she waits for their father to come home

Act Two:

While an enraged Marge waits at the front door for Homer, he stands in the driveway, figuring out exactly what to say to her. Marge hears Homers keys rattle when opening the front door, so she opens the door for him, about to blow up in rage. But when he holds up some chocolates and the rose and tells her he loves her, Marge's rage melts away and she forgives him.

Bart once again prank calls Moe again, this time looking for Oliver Clozoff and laughs with Lisa when he's fooled again. Homer lays out his plan for the evening with Marge. She calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service, after she hung up the phone upon hearing Moe, thinking it was a crosswire. Unfortunately, the receptionist immediately refuses the services of their babysitters when she identified herself as Mrs.Simpson. This was because, her kids are on the ""No! No! No!"" poster due to their prevous misbehavior to their babysitters and as a result the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service has decided to refuse service of their babysitters to the Simpson family. However, Homer successfully call for a babysitter as Mr.Samson and the receptionist aks him if his wife called in earlier. Homer says no and tells her that it's Samson, not Simpson. The receptionist is relieved as she complains about the Simpson kids and their scary father, irritating him. Continuing to pretend to be Mr.Samson, Homer calmly convinces her that the Simpsons are their neighbors and they're just misunderstood, but highly respectful people. After getting a babysitter, Lisa watches Marge get ready, and Bart watches Homer get ready for their date. A 6-foot tall, frightening looking and intimidating lady named Ms.Botz, their baby sitter, arrives with her own suitcases. Marge tells her that Maggie needs to be put to bed right away, but Lisa and Bart can stay up for an extra hour watching ""The Happy Little Elves Meets The Curious Cub"" After that, they head out for their romantic night in the town while the kids are safe with their babysitter. In the living room, Bart tries to get Ms.Botz to agree to alternate TV show viewing other than the elves since they've seen it too many times. However, she quickly puts him in his place with her menacing threat because she has dealt with children like him before. Bart is forced to watch ""The Happy Little Elves"" with Lisa, while Ms.Botz puts Maggie to bed.

At the restaurant, Homer picks out his lobster for dinner. While at the house Bart can't stand The Happy Little Elves anymore and turns on the TV. Back at the restaurant Marge and Homer enjoy their dinner and Mambo dancing. At the house, Bart and Lisa watch a report about the Baby Sitter Bandit on Americas Most Armed and Dangerous. They start to get scared right away as the reporter tells of a baby sitter who ties up the children and then ransacks the house. Bart and Lisas fears come true when a picture of Ms. Botz as the Baby Sitter Bandit is shown as Lucille Botzcowski. Just then Ms.Botz walks in the living room with rope to tie up a screaming Bart and Lisa.

Act Three:

Bart runs downstairs to the basement while Lisa runs to the kitchen to call the toll free fugitive hotline, but the phone lines are busy. Meanwhile, Marge and Homer make their way to the motel. Back at the house, Bart is captured in the basement by Ms.Botz and Lisa finally makes it through the busy hotline. Just as she is about to report Ms. Botz, Lisa is also captured and tied up. Ms Botz places a tied up Bart and Lisa on the couch and goes to ransack the house.

Meanwhile, Marge and Homer have made it to the motel and are enjoying each others company. At the house, Maggie wakes up, while Ms.Botz ransacks Homer and Marges room, and heads downstairs. Once in the living room, Maggie unties Bart and Lisa. While Ms. Botz ransacks another room Maggie crawls by and Ms. Botz follows her to tie her up as well. Maggie leads Ms Botz into another room where Bart is waiting with a baseball bat, he knocks Ms.Botz out. The kids quickly escape from the house just as Marge calls from the motel. When no one answers the phone, Marge gets worried and she and Homer decide to head back home. The kids make their way to a pay phone and call the fugitive hotline to inform them of their capture of the Baby Sitter Bandit.

Meanwhile, Homer and Marge arrive back home to find Ms.Botz tied up in the living room. They unite her and Homer pays her triple her fee as she quickly drives away. Just as Ms.Botz drives off, the police arrive to arrest her. As Homer realizes what he has done, microphones and cameras are shoved in his face, and he makes a fool of himself as he quickly tries to lie and explain how the Baby Sitter Bandit got away from him. Marge consoles Homer, who feels stupid, as they watch his interview on the news before going to bed."

While the family struggles to get by without Lois' income, Malcolm has problems of his own, with starting puberty and mixed emotions for Julie Houlerman. Confused by mixed signals by Julie, Malcolm accidentally blurts out that he is poor, with Julie overhearing it. As Lois is trying to make a point by doing ""the right thing"", Francis charmingly gets closer to the participants of the pageant and Malcolm is surprised by the whole school with a food collection, which Julie organized, feeling bad for Malcolm. Francis finds out that the reason why the girls at the pageant get so intimate with him is because they think he is homosexual. Francis tries to play this card to his favor, acting as if he could be ""turned"" and actually gets away with it. But the ""cure"" turns out to be more spiritual then sexual. Lois finally gets over her pride and asks Mr. Pinter for her job back, but her former boss pushes her over the edge with degrading remarks and so Lois lets him know, what she really knows and leaves him stranded to the whim of her former co-workers, who overheard all the dirty little secrets. Which leaves Mr. Pinter leaving Lucky Aide and Lois with her former job."

Hastings and Arnott attend the ceremony where Hastings explains that Gates is their next target. Gates runs a unit called TO-20 which deals with ""big sexy"" cases and has extraordinary clearance rates. Hastings thinks that Gates is ""laddering"", or improperly charging offenses in order to make his unit's statistics look good.

While at the ceremony, Gates gets a hysterical call from Jackie. When he arrives at her house she explains that she had been drinking with some friends that night and hit something on the way home. When Gates asks her what she hit she claims it was a dog. Gates is relieved until Jackie tells him that she had panicked and reported her car stolen. She then explains that she has had a previous conviction for drink driving and that another arrest will lead to jail time. Reluctantly, Gates fabricates physical evidence to corroborate her story about the stolen car.

The next day DC Kate Fleming, who works in the same squad room as TO-20 but is not part of the team, is interviewing a victim about two men who attacked him. When she writes up her findings her boss tells her to reclassify the crimes so that the statistics don't look so bad. Fleming watches as TO-20 sorts through cases which they might take, growing frustrated at the mundane work she has been assigned. DS Leah Janson informs Fleming that Gates has been officially reprimanded for having an all male squad and will be looking to hire a female officer soon. Janson expects it to be her.

As his unit reviews cases which it might take, Gates is startled to hear about a dead body found on the roadside in the area Jackie was driving the night before. He meets with Jackie and tells her to turn herself in and confess to the crime, noting that trying to cover up the hit and run will be worse than admitting to it. Later, Gates receives word that AC-12 has received a complaint against him. Hastings and Arnott arrive to conduct an interview and Arnott has a brief encounter with Kate Fleming. During the interview, Hastings reveals to Gates that the complaint is related to Gates' failure to report the free breakfast which he had receives earlier and implies that the complaintants are the muggers who Gates arrested. Hastings later admits to Arnott that this is a smoke screen meant to cover their real investigation. Arnott, however, argues that Gates might be posting legitimate statistics.

Jackie arrives at the police station and gives a statement to a civilian employee that coincides with her claim that the car was stolen. Gates later scolds her for refusing to follow the plan he suggested and putting him at risk. Gates then returns home to his wife and two daughters. Hastings and Arnott go a pub where they see Kate Fleming and her colleagues drinking. Arnott follows her and tries to initiate a conversation but she rebukes him for targeting Gates. After reviewing Gates record, Arnott approaches him and offers to try and get Hastings to back off.

Gates approaches Rita, the unit's civilian assistant and asks her to send any updates on the hit and run case directly to him. Fleming then meets with Gates and makes the case for her being added to TO-20. Gates invites her to come drinking with the unit. Gates is called back into AC-12 for an interview where Hastings informs him of the true scope of the laddering investigation. Afterwards Hasting upbraids Arnott for failure to dig into Gates' background and urges him to act like an anti-corruption officer.

Kate arrives at the pub for drinks and Gates introduces her to the rest of TO-20: Nige Morton, an older officer who walks with a cane, ""Dot"" Cotton a young white officer, and Deepak Kapoor an Asian officer. Together they all allow Gates to fill various demographic boxes for his unit. Hastings takes Arnott to the roof of AC-12 where he introduces him to Kate Fleming who is, in reality, an undercover AC-12 officer. She again tries to convince Arnott of the value of investigating Gates. The next day Arnott finds a piece of excrement on the drivers seat of his car. He angrily confronts Gates and informs him that he knows he's dirty. Afterwards, TO-20 begins a new case involving surveillance of drug dealers in a housing project. Gates informs Fleming that he's going to get her officially appointed to the squad.

Gates meets with Jackie and informs her that her case is being filed as an unsolved hit and run. Meanwhile, Arnott begins reviewing Gate's case files, including the hit and run case, for evidence of laddering. While surveiling the apartment at the center of their case Dot and Deepak, concerned about minimizing overtime, leave despite the next team not being there yet. The next morning they find the dealers who lived in the apartment tortured and murdered.

Rita, the civilian worker, informs Gates that an ID has been made on the hit and run victim. He is an accountant who had worked for Laverty Holdings, Jackie's company. Rita has also linked the hit and run with the report of Jackie's stolen car. Gates gets on her computer and deletes the files. Coincidentally at the same time Arnott is reviewing the file over at AC-12 and he notices the deletion."

Aidan calls someone and they help him get rid of the body. The next morning, Josh wakes up naked, and covered in blood. He takes a dress from a nearby house, puts it on and meets Aidan, who is waiting for him in his car.

As they get dressed at the hospital they work at, they talk about their desire of being normal. Aidan tells Josh to think about his idea of moving into an apartment together. In the hallway, they meet a new nurse who is covering for Rebecca (Sarah Allen), the girl Aidan had killed the night before. She tells them Rebecca did not show up for work that day.

Aidan spots a man in a suit and follows him to a patient's room. Aidan and the man seem to know eachother. The man, Marcus (Vincent Leclerc), 'welcomes' Aidan back and tells him that Bishop is recruiting. They then break into a fight where it is revealed that Marcus is also a vampire. A nurse interrups the fight, the man leaves, and Aidan goes back to work.

Later that day Josh tells Aidan that he agrees with the apartment idea. Aidan and Josh visit an aparment. Josh loves the apartment but Aidan doesn't seem too interested. Danny, the man selling the apartment, tells Aidan and Josh that his fiance died in the apartment so he is desperate to sell it. At first Josh and Aidan don't seem too happy about it but once Danny says he will not check for credit, they take it.

Back at the hospital, Aidan shows Josh a room in the basement, where Josh can transform while being contained. Aidan removes the inside door handle so that the door can only be opened from the outside. Josh calls it his own personal cage and goes with the idea.

At the new apartment, Josh and Aidan find the ghost of Danny's fiance, Sally. She tells them that as much as she tires, she cannot get herself to leave.

In the hospital hallway, Josh sees a girl who he seems to know. When she turns to look at him, he runs away.

Once again, Aiden comes across the nurse replacing Rebecca who tells him that the police are there to investigate Rebecca's dissappearence. Aidan talks to two cops. One of them is Bishop, a vampire. Bishop commands the other cop to go to the car and wait there. Bishop tells Aidan that he is worried about him and that he must come back to him for his own good. Aidan ignores this, telling him he no longer follows that lifestyle.

Josh accidently walks into a room where his sister, who he had seen in the hallway earlier, is kissing a patient. Josh tries to leave but his sister recognizes him and calls for him. His sister asks him why he left the people that loved him most. He tells her its complicated and that she wouldn't understand.

That night, while Aidan is walking home, Bishop pulls up and tells him that the police know he killed Rebecca. Aidan gets in the car thinking they are going to settle the Rebecca problem, but instead is taken to a vampire lair. Aidan gives into temptation and sucks another girl's blood while Bishop watches in delight.

It is the night of a full moon. Josh goes to the hospital and heads down to the basement where he is going to transform. As he is walking through the hospital with his earphones on, his sister sees him and follows him down to the basement. Josh doesn't notice her there until he is in the room getting ready to transform. He urges her to leave but she insists on talking and shuts the door, which cannot be opened from the inside. Josh immediately starts to panic and calls Aidan who cannot answer his phone because he is too busy at the vampire lair. Josh then calls home and asks Sally to leave the house and tell Aidan that he is trapped in the room with his sister.

The episode ends as Josh is on the floor beginning to transform."

Sally had to watch her own memorial in silence while everyone looked right through her. Aidan was turned by Bishop during the Civil War and first woke up as a vampire in a pile of dead bodies. Josh was attacked by what he thought was a wolf until the next full moon caught him by surprise and he endured his first, painful transformation.

Picking up from the cliffhanger of the last episode, even though Aidan has given in to Bishops temptations and is indulging in fresh blood given willingly at a secret vampire club, the voicemail indicator on his cell phone jars him from his reverie. After hearing Joshs frantic message, Aidan is able (just barely) to save Emily by using his vampire speed to get to the hospital and let her out before Josh completes his transformation.

Forced into an uncomfortable position, Aidan refuses to explain Joshs disorder to her, even though she tries to pry it out of him. He leaves it up to Josh to tell her, if he wants. Emily wants Josh to come back home so the family can help him but he refuses, feeling like the horror of his life is too much of a strain for his family.

Back at the house, Sally has become obsessed with seeing her ex-fiancé Danny so Aidan calls Danny over to repair the plumbing (which wont work as long as Sally is upset). While Danny is there, Aidan and Josh ask him questions that they think Sally would want to know, including how she diedsomething Sally cant seem to remember.

At the hospital, Cara, the new nurse, continues to take an interest in Aidanironic, since she has unwittingly taken the place of Rebecca, the nurse Aidan killed. When Josh sees a woman who looks like Rebecca, he gives chase and finds out that Rebecca is aliveas a vampire. Naturally, Josh is furious with Aidan but when he confronts him, Aidan is just as surprised. It was Bishop who turned Rebecca, straining his already fragile relationship with Aidan.

Aidan tries to help Rebecca get clean but she seems to love the thrill and power of being a vampire. Disgusted with Rebecca, Bishop and, most of all, himself, Aidan has a drink with Cara but he immediately regrets it and asks Josh to come to the bar and chaperone. Before Josh can get there, Rebecca interrupts Aidan and Caras date and, when Aidan doesnt respond the way she wants, she attacks Cara, leaving her dying in an alley.

The only way Aidan can save her is to turn her into a vampire but he cant bring himself to do it. Cara dies in Joshs arms. Once again, its up to Bishop to clean up Aidan s mess in order to protect the vampire clans secrets."

Aidan invited her fiancé, and shes too excited about seeing him to be rational.

Joshs fears seem unfounded, though. The evening goes well and soon Josh even discovers an unexpected friendship with two of the neighborhood watch members. Officer Garity, the groups police liaison does take a keen interest in Aidan, though. Aidan blows it off but when Bishop shows up at the hospital to tell him that Garity looked Aidan up on the police computer, Aidan knows he needs to take care of it, or Bishop will.

Aidan tracks Garity down to a local bar where he tries to talk to him but it doesnt go well. It turns out that years prior, before hed stopped being a predator, Aidan killed Officers Garitys fathersomething Officer Garity is not likely to forget. Garity even remembers the tattoo that he saw on Aidans chest all those years ago. When Garity tries to see if Aidan has the same tattoo, the two of them struggle. Garity accidentally kills Aidan and gets the scare of his life when he sees Aidan comes back to life.

Bishop wants to recruit Officer Garity to the vampire clan but Aidan thinks it would be more humane to compel him to forget everythingnot that hes ever been good at compelling. When Garity doesnt accept Bishops offer to become a vampire willingly, Aidan tries his hand at compelling him to forget. It seems to work at first but Garitys mind cant take the mental strain and Aidan nearly kills him in the process.

Hes fun and helpful but he turns out to be a bit too flirty for Sallys tastes. Nevertheless, hes able to teach Sally a bit about love and loss and the magic door that will appear for her when its time for her to move on from earth.

The plan, however, seems like a bad one when he cant find a place secluded enough to transform. Even more upsetting, when he awakens in the morning, he finds one of the people he ran into in the woods watching him.

After the man tells Josh that he sucks at being a werewolf, Josh learns that the mans name is Ray and hes also a werewolf. It turns out that Ray has been tracking Josh and wants to become friends and helpmates but Josh hates his werewolf self too much to accept another werewolf into his life. When Aidan reminds Josh that he may need a supernatural support system, Josh gives Ray a try and the two quickly bond.

Unexpectedly, Rebecca returns to Aidan to ask for his help living a clean, non-predatory life. Although he was eager to help her before, Aidan seems to have had a change of heart. Rebecca plays on his guilt for putting her in this situation in the first place and he finally agrees. Soon, they start dating and instead of keeping Rebecca clean, her raw, uncontrolled urges seduce him back towards the life of a typical vampire.

Now that Sally knows her best friend Bridget might be in Dannys life, she cant help but haunt both of their houses, watching helplessly as their relationship begins to blossom. She hates the idea at first, and derails it by knocking over a wine glass at just the right moment, but after she talks to Aidan she sets about trying to bring them together so that both she and Danny can move on.

After Ray shows Josh the ropes of being a werewolf, Josh takes to him so much that he invites him to crash at the housean arrangement that Aidan isnt so sure about, especially since Ray seems to have some serious hate for any and all vampires. Sally, however, likes Ray, especially since he helps her move objects by channeling her anger.

AIDAN: It turns out that Father Gates, the priest shown at the start of the episode, has turned Aidans patient into a vampire. Aidan later discovers that Gates was instructed by Bishop to turn the patient because he was wealthy. Of course, Aidan still doesnt want Bishop recruiting at the hospital so he confronts him. They fight, but because Aidan doesnt drink live blood, he is no match for Bishop. Before he can leave the funeral home, Bishop tells Aidan that his roommate Josh beat up Marcus. Later, Aidan confronts Father Gates and when Gates refuses to back down, Aidan smashes the priests fangshe knows that vampire fangs dont grow back.

At the hospital, Josh runs into Nora, a woman he tried to seduce by using Rays advice. It was an epic fail and now she loathes him but shes shocked to find out that he visits sick patients on his days off. Maybe hes not as much of a jerk as he seemed at first. Ray and Josh meet at the remote cabin as planned but things start to go south when Ray confesses that he was the werewolf that attacked Josh two years ago, turning Josh into a werewolf too. The two fight, first as men and then as werewolves but the score is far from settled. Josh wants Ray out of his house.

SALLY: At the house, the plumbing is not working, which usually means Sally is upset about something.

Bishop and Marcus are hoping that Rebecca can bring Aidan back into the vampire fold.

Of course, Josh cant tell her that vampires had kidnapped him but, no matter, Nora has news of her own: shes pregnant. Josh is so shocked by the news that he doesnt take it well but Aidan thinks its a good thing.

Meanwhile, Sally has her own problems. Danny and Bridget have shown up at the house with an exorcist to remove her spirit. Without Aidan and Josh to help her, Sally fights the exorcist but, in the end, she just cant hold outthe exorcist is too strong.

Marcus, unnerved by the fact that Bishop is suspicious, tries to work a deal with the Dutch to take over Boston but they are unmoved by his arguments so he tries to form an alliance with Rebecca. The Dutch ask Bishop to take a fifty-year leave of absence from Boston and to render his decision at dinner. Bishop, however, has one last ace up his sleeve.

Once Josh is able to get Nora to sit still for a moment, he confesses that he didnt think he could get anyone pregnant. That softens her up, but he doesnt tell her whats really on his mindthe fact that the child could be a werewolf too.

Half dead, Sally dives into the exorcists body allowing the exorcist to see her memories. Immediately, the exorcist knows that Danny killed Sally and she stops the exorcism. When the exorcist leaves, Bridget leaves too, leaving Danny in the house alone with a very angry spirit.

After Bishop turns the tables on the Dutch, all hell breaks loose and, in the heat of the moment, Aidan turns on the Dutch to help save Bishop. Marcus stops Aidan and is about to kill him, but Rebecca gets the drop on him and drives a stake through Marcuss heart. The Dutch flees but not before warning Aidan to prepare for whats next. Rebecca, certain that the vampires will seek revenge on her for killing Marcus, begs Aidan to set her free by killing her and he reluctantly obliges."

When they get to the hospital, Aidan runs into Celine, the Canadian love of his life and finds out shes come to his hospital to die peacefully.

Sally, still weak and deformed from the near-successful exorcism, isnt speaking. At a loss for how to regain her strength, Sally teleports to Dannys house where she finds him shaving. She hurts him and, just like that, she returns to normal leading her to believe that she has to kill Danny to stop being imprisoned on earth.

Meanwhile, Nora has noticed some abnormalities about her pregnancy, which makes Josh fear the worst but he stands by her and tries to hide whats really on his mind. When Noras ultrasound comes back normal, Josh is relievedmaybe his child wont be a werewolf after all. There is a question mark Josh will have to explore later, thoughthe doctor says Nora is fourteen weeks pregnant, not seven.

Somehow Danny knows it was Sally that hurt him shaving and he wants revenge. He shows up at the house with a gas can, ready to burn the whole place down. Sally cant stop him but she has enough power to trap Danny in the burning house with her. Luckily, Aidan and Josh get home in time to put out the blaze. Aidan and Sally want to kill him but, instead, they threaten to make his life miserable unless he confesses to the police. With a confession for arson and accidental murder, its likely that Danny will go to jail for a long time. Then, almost as soon as hes arrested, Sallys door to the beyond appears.

Later on, when a disguised nurse tries to kill Aidan in the stairway, Josh finally realizes how serious the vampire war is. Aidan survives, thanks to Josh and spends as much time with Celine as he can. He offers to turn her, something she used to beg him for, but he refusedshe doesnt want to watch her children grow old and die while she lives on forever. She also doesnt want to tell Aidan that she disappeared from his life because Bishop kidnapped her and threatened her family.

At the house, just as Sally is about to step through her door, Bishop leaps through the window and drives a stake into Aidans chest before fleeing. Meanwhile, Josh and Sally watch helplessly as Aidan lay dying on the living room floor."

Josh was working in a diner when Marcus attacked him. Aiden saved Josh, and then got him a job at the hospital where he was already working. After a year of getting to know each other, they decided to become roommates.

In present tense, Josh has moved the critically injured Aiden to the basement of the hospital and recruited Nora to bring them blood from the blood bank. Nora, of course, wants to operate but Josh and Aiden won't allow it. Sally wants to stick around to see him through but Aiden insists that she go through her door while she can, and leave Josh to watch over him.

When Celine unexpectedly relieves Josh so he can get some rest, she begs Aiden to drink her blood because she knows that it will make him heal fasterbut this time it's Aiden who refuses. He knows he'd have to drain her to regain his strength.

Before Josh can leave the hospital, he runs into Nora. He thanks her for her help and her silence but, since he still won't tell her what's going on, she breaks it off. She's finally run out of patience with his secrets and apologies. Josh understands but he writes her a long letter to alleviate some of her hurt.

Back at the house, Sally is shocked to find that her door has vanished and, worse, she's become more solid. Might she have missed her only opportunity to escape this world? She has no choice but to wait and see. For now, at least, she's stuck.

Bishop is able to heal himself by draining a co-worker and, afterward, he promptly issues a challenge to Aiden. He wants the two of them to meet alone and fight to the death. Sally and Josh refuse to stand idly by. They hatch a plan to trap Bishop in the hospital basement, so that Josh, as a werewolf, can kill him. It's a good plan but it violates Aiden's code of honor so Sally locks Josh up alone instead.

In order to fight Bishop, Aiden needs his full strength so he finally takes Celine up on her offer to drink her blood. They both know she'll die but she says she'd rather give her life to Aiden than to her lung cancer. Fully healed, Aiden faces Bishop and with Sally's help, kills him. Finally, Aiden is free, at least until the escaped Dutch vampire shows up calling for Aiden to be the new ruler of Boston and to meet a mysterious vampire that neither of them will name.

In an odd twist of fate, Nora sees Josh on his way to the hospital basement and follows him. She's just in time to see Josh transform and learn his true secret. In the morning, they talk about it and Nora is surprisingly willing to deal with his ""problem."" What Josh doesn't know is that he scratched Nora while trying to push her out of the room. But was that scratch enough to turn her into a werewolf too?"

It's all a big hoax, it's a surprise going away party from her fellow cops.

She heads home with the blow-up doll. Her house is in the middle of being packed up and her fiance Rick kisses her sweetly. The movers are on the way. Her son Jack is with a friend. He asks if she's ready to do this: sell her condo, quit her job, move her kid away, and marry him. She kisses him and shows him she is. He takes off, he has an earlier flight. As he leaves she says she does want to marry him. He leaves. She looks around a little less sure perhaps. She grabs some of her son's art and photos from the fridge.

Back at her office, Linden is interrupted by the new detective moving into her office, Holder. She's just finishing up packing. She tells him she's moving to Sonoma. They make small talk. Her boss comes in and gives her a case and tells her to take Holder and show him how to work a scene. He says he knows how. The boss says she can hand off the case at the end of her shift and still make her flight.

They drive to the crime scene in the rain and talk about the angst of the homicide beat and his previous work as a narc. They arrive. It's no longer raining. No body yet, but bloody clothes found in a field where meth heads hang out. There's also an ATM card belonging to a Stanley Larsen. Linden surveys the field. She tells the beat cop to hold down the fort and tells Holder he can take it if he wants, she has packing to do. He tells her to keep on it and he won't let her miss her flight. He says they should go talk to Stanley Larsen.

We meet Larsen, he arrives to pick up some meat from a meat locker at a market. He gets a call from his wife saying he needs to get home right now.

In an establishing flashback: A woman mops the floor as Stan fixes some plumbing with duct tape. It's Stan's wife, Mitch. He has not fixed anything. They banter and bicker and he drops her on the wet kitchen floor and kisses her. She sends him off with a kiss. Mitch tells Stan that their daughter Rosie has applied for college. The wife says it's good even though it's out of state. She says they need to let her grow up sometime since she's almost 18. They start making out again and he walks off with a smile towards a moving and storage truck with his name on the side.

He drives by posters for a political campaign for a Darren Richmond, a suave, hot politician. We move to a shot of him in a graveyard paying respects to someone. He gets a call and tells someone he is on his way. We cut to him meeting with his campaign staff, he's a councilman with an election for mayor nearing and they're all nervous. It's implied that he's sleeping with his female campaign manager/aide Gwen. In a meeting they feel confident that they're going to win with several chits on their side including an endorsement from a councilwoman Yitanes.

Linden and Holder interview Mrs. Larsen who says she's sure Stan stayed in last night after getting in late from a camping trip. Linden notices a pink bike in the Larsen garage and asks if Mrs. Larsen has a daughter. She has, Rosie, who she hasn't heard from her since Friday night, she was supposedly staying with friends.

One of those friends is at school furiously texting Rosie asking where she is. Her name is Sterling and she tells school officials that Rosie stayed with her but didn't come to school with her. Sterling gets a nosebleed. (Apparently, the council candidates are coming to the school to do a Q&A with the kids). Her teacher knows she was lying and asks for the truth.

Back at the Larsen house, Mitch is going over her last encounters with Rosie and her knowledge of her plans. She says she was wearing a pink sweater, like the kind they found. She says her daughter doesn't have a history of running away but she wasn't worried when she didn't hear from her since they were camping out of cell phone range. She said it's not like they left a little kid home alone. Linden looks at Rosie's room, the happy pictures and collages and pink bedspread. They get a call from the school, Sterling admitted Rosie wasn't with her and the last time anyone saw Rosie was Friday at a Halloween dance.

Richmond preps for his school appearance. He asks his Gwen to move in with him. She says he can break hearts after he gets the single female vote. She says she knows where he was this morning and he wishes that he would talk to her about ""her."" (I'm guessing his dead wife?) He is informed the police have arrived. They cancel the candidates' appearance because they have to investigate Rosie's disappearance. His opponent, the current mayor, Adams tells him to not count on the councilwoman's endorsement.

The kids are sent back to their home rooms. Sterling sees the police in the distance and heads the other way. The cops can't find her. The teacher tells them that Rosie was with Sterling at the party, where she was dressed as a witch. The cop tries to bait the teacher into saying Rosie was a ""hot piece."" He doesn't take the bait. Linden tells Holder to keep up with the case, she got a call from her son's school asking to come pick him up.

Sterling rides her bike to an alley to find a bunch of teen boys hanging out. She's looking for someone named Jasper. She finds another skate kid, he tells her Jasper scored some X and took Rosie to an island to ""bone"" her.

We cut to this Jasper playing video games in some swanky pad. A woman writhes and moans upstairs on a bed, it's hard to tell if it's from pain or pleasure. Jasper seems unconcerned either way.

Linden picked up Jack who got caught smoking at school. She drops him off at someone named Regi's house. Jack seems disgruntled about the move and Rick, his future stepdad. She says Rick is trying his best and that they're going to be happy in California. She gets a call from Holder who's sweeping the field. She says she has to go.

Mitch is calling Stan leaving messages. Her other two kids, two little boys. come home calling out to Rosie. She tells the babysitter, her sister Terry, she doesn't know anything about Rosie. The boys are looking for Rosie and Terry says she'll take them out and Mitch apologizes to her saying she's crazy right now and Rosie's going to get the ass-kicking of her life when she gets home.

Stan comes home and he and Mitch worry about Rosie and the cops asking about birthmarks and scars. Stan worries that it's that ""rich jack-off"" she's dating and that she's 17 and just being a teenager. He says he'll find her and leaves and tells Mitch to stay home and wait for her.

The field search turns up a trail through the woods thanks to the K-9 unit. Holder says the dad's alibi checked out. Linden says they still need to talk to him. She seems very invested in the scene now and less interested in her flight. She gets a call for a possible murder site.

At Richmond's headquarters, his aides try to convince him to jump on the Larsen thing as a way to say ""campaign be damned."" Richmond dismisses this saying he won't use a family tragedy as a soundbite. He says his opponent Adams, who released a press release while they were supposed to be at the school meeting, knew about the endorsement from the councilwoman Yitanes, that's what they need to worry about. He gets a call from someone who is worried about a reporter calling her and asking about his ""trips."" Trips only they and Gwen, and his other aide Jamie, know about.

Stan finds Sterling and asks where Rosie is. She says she's at Jasper's house.

Stan calls Mitch and tells her and that's he going to the island to pick her up. Mitch is relieved.

Linden gets a call from her boss saying they found Rosie. He doesn't confirm that he actually spoke with her. Linden tells the other cops to wrap it up, they're done.

Stan arrives at Jasper's swanky island pad. (It's his parents, they're out of town.) Stan manhandles him even though Jasper says she's not there. He uncovers the woman in the bed, it's not Rosie.

Back in the field Linden gets a call from Rick who proposes pizza after he picks them up at the airport. He proposes a barbecue to let Jack get to know the neigborhood kids. All the while Holder is honking the horn and yelling at her it's time to go. She notices some kids walking down a road with fishing poles and wonders where it leads. Puget Sound. There's also a lake on the other side. A search of the lake turns up a car. A search of the car turns up Rosie in the trunk.

Stan calls Mitch to tell her he's at the park because he heard they found her sweater there. She tells the boys to go watch videos. He says he doesn't know where else to go. As he approaches he sees the police roadblock. He leaves Mitch hanging on the phone. The police try to hold him back. He arrives just as, in the distance, they find her body. Linden goes to break the news, without really breaking it. The cops hold him back in his grief, which Mitch hears over the phone in the kitchen, freaking out in front of the now freaked out boys yelling ""Stan!!""

The plates of the car say it belongs to Richmond.

We cut to Richmond chatting at an evening fundraiser, then cut back to the scene with photos being taken of the body and Stan Larsen crumpling to his knees. Linden is clearly going to miss her flight.

Mitch arrives at the morgue. She meets Stan. They embrace and cry as Linden and Holder watch. They ID the body.

Linden interrogates Stan. He remembers seeing her Friday before school and says she didn't seem any different than normal, he was on the phone taking an order and she waved. Holder interrogates Mitch who can't think of anyone who might've done this to Rosie. She's still in shock talking about her daughters broken fingernails.

Stan says his daughter wasn't involved in politics, she mostly hung with her brothers and Sterling. Jasper was a short-term boyfriend.

The boss says the coroner has no cause of death yet. He tells Linden to call the campaign and to dot her i's on this. She says she's done and has a wedding to plan. He says she's on the clock until he says she isn't. Rick calls and she tells him that she's being told to stay. He's very understanding and says to get home soon.

Linden tells Stan and Mitch to go home, get rest, and keep it within the family for now. He asks why she asked if Rosie was into politics. She says they're looking at every angle. Stan asks if they'll find who did this. She says they'll do their best. He asks Holder. Holder says yeah.

Richmond is on his way home with Gwen. He took in $24k at the fundraiser and they're on their way home to a nice Pinot. Gwen gets a call from the police. She tells Richmond about Rosie being found in a campaign car. He tells Linden and Holder he will totally cooperate. He says he doesn't understand how his campaign could be involved. They ask about his alibi. He's got one, he was in Tacoma at an inn. They ask if there's anyone else can vouch for him Friday night. Gwen can, of course. They want to issue a press release. Linden wants until midnight at least since the killer probably doesn't know they found her. The police leave. Gwen and Jamie tell him to call a press conference immediately and ignore the police, the election is a month away and this could sink it. Jamie says to make a play to get close to the family saying he knows what they're going through. Richmond declines saying they will send out a press release at noon the next day and hire a PI and find out what happened with the car. He says he's not using his dead wife for his campaign. Gwen convinces him to tell Yitanes before the police news blindsides her so as not to lose her endorsement. He tells her that the reporter called him yesterday with a tip from inside their office. He tells her to follow it up and find out who's leaking.

Linden checks in with her son. She and Holder find out that the last driver of the car was a female volunteer and then it was carjacked. The keys were in the ignition to begin with.

The Larsens awake the next morning. It is raining. Terry offers to cook and then breaks down crying thinking Rosie is still just missing. She says she didn't tell the boys anything. Stan tells Mitch to get some sleep. Instead she looks into Rosie's room and then shuts the door.

Stan goes to work, a zombie. His work buddy asks what's up, says the police called and asked some of the guys to come to the station.

Sterling arrives at school and Jasper accosts her. He says he's not ""sticking it"" to Rosie anymore and is mad Sterling said they were together. The teacher comes out and says the police want to talk to them both.

Sterling tells Holder they went to the dance and then couldn't find her after and figured she went to Jasper's. She says she doesn't know where she went. Sterling is very upset. Holder tells her it's not her fault.

Jasper says he picked up some ""old lady"" Friday night at a bar and offers her phone number as an alibi. He says he and Rosie didn't date, but hooked up for like two seconds. Jasper's dad arrives in a huff since he can't be talked to without an attorney. He asks the cops and the principal to leave him alone with his son. He promptly slaps him and asks what he did this time.

Holder and Linden go over the video from the dance, while Jack sits in the corner. Holder likes Jasper for the perp. Linden wonders why him, how would he have access to a Richmond campaign car? Linden wonders what a good girl like Rosie was doing with a boy like Jasper. Turns out he has a previous auto theft, a joy ride in a Ferrari, no charges pressed since his dad's a big wig property owner on Mercer Island. Most other potential perps are cleared which makes Jasper their best bet. They get word that Richmond is releasing his press release in an hour.

At Richmond's campaign they hear the staff is in the clear and the car was carjacked. Councilman Ruth Yitanes arrives and Richmond's going to spill but then Linden arrives to tell him to hold off on the release and she promises to tell the press how cooperative he was in putting this family's tragedy ahead of his campaign. She makes herself forcefully clear. He tells her she has until midnight. Linden gets a call and thanks him for his help. Richmond tells Gwen to call a reporter and tell him he'll get the scoop.

He goes back and tells Yitanes that he smoked pot in college in case it comes out. She laughs it off and says not to get caught with some intern's face in his crotch. She can't believe that's all he needed to tell her. He says ""scout's honor.""

Mitch and Stan go to pick up their boys. Stan gets a call saying the cops are at the house. They go to take the boys to fly a kite. One of them can tell something is up.

Linden meets Holder at a dumpster where he found Rosie's wig from the dance.

Linden addresses some kids at the school. She asks if any of them saw her at the dance or after. She gets nothing from any of them. Apparently, she's addressing several groups of kids.

Richmond is going door to door canvassing for the vote.

Jamie tries to get Richmond to tell Yitanes the truth. Richmond says she will have already given her endorsement by the time the news come out. They're waiting.

The boys ask about Rosie. Stan tells them, he tries to tell them as gently as possible, saying Rosie went to heaven like grandma. One of them, Tommy, gets very upset. Stan reassures the other one that they're going to be okay, he doesn't look so sure.

Richmond checks in with another campaign aide, Nathan, about checking the campaign email accounts for leaks. He says they all checked out but he didn't check Gwen and Jamie. Richmond tells him to do it and get back to him.

Linden uses the restroom at the school and sees ""Rosie"" scrawled in a mirror. She has to go pick up Jack and Holder says he's going to stay and do some more digging. He says it's not her case anymore and he'll take care of it. She goes to leave.

The Larsens arrive home and Terry is cleaning up after the cops. Terry asks Mitch why she didn't call Rosie to check in all weekend.

Holder hangs at the soccer field smoking pot and talks with two girls. They're surprised since he's a cop. He offers them a hit and promises not to arrest them. It's weird he makes sure that one of them inhales. One of them claims to be high immediately. He asks if they're going to party. The ""high"" one says yes. He asks how old she is, she says old enough. He says he's going to leave since there's no place to party. They suggest ""the cage"" in the basement. He goes to investigate.

Linden looks at the video again from the party as Jack waits. He wants to stay through the weekend to go to a friend's party. She says Rick is waiting and he has to go to school. She reiterates that she knows the move is hard but it's going to be great and they're leaving in five minutes. Her boss arrives with COD, drowning, Rosie was alive when the car went in the water, ripped off her own fingernails trying to get out of the trunk. They couldn't tell if she was raped. Linden says she's not staying. Her boss says he'll have someone drive her and Jack to the airport.

Stan is working late in his office. He turns off the news just as something about Richmond comes on. He notices a yellowed child's drawing on his file cabinet made by Rosie. He heads home. The boys are watching TV and don't know where their mother is.

Richmond is on his way to the union meeting where Yitanes is going to give her endorsement. Gwen and Jamie pump him up. Richmond gets a call and gives a no comment. It was a reporter calling for confirmation that Rosie was found in his campaign car.

Linden arrives at ""the cage."" Holder says it's where the ""real"" Halloween party went down. There appears to be a mattress, maybe covered in blood, with Rosie's witch hat on the floor next to it. Linden has missed her flight.

Richmond and his aides ride in silence.

Stan opens his bedroom door to see Mitch lying on the bed, curled up, catatonic.

Linden watches as the crime scene guys take pictures of bloody handprints on the wall."

Cutting between her run we see flashes of a young brunette being chased by someone with a flashlight through the woods. She seems terrified. Linden arrives on a beach and finds a dead seal. She gets a call.

Linden arrives at the call and tells the officer it's her last day. But it turns out to be Linden's co-workers giving her a surprise party for her last day.

Linden goes home and spends a few minutes with fiancé Rick. We learn they are moving to California and she and son Jack will fly out that night to meet Rick, who is taking an earlier flight. We learn teenager Jack doesn't love the idea of the move.

At the office the guy who is going to replace Linden, Stephen Holder, shows up earlier than expected. She tells him she's moving to the San Francisco area. Lieutenant Oakes shows up and gives her a call to check out.

Linden takes Holder along to the call. On the way he tells Linden he's coming to homicide from working undercover narcotics with the county.

Holder says the scene is a park known to be frequented by drug addicts. They are shown a bloody, dry-cleaned pink sweater and an ATM card with the name Stanley Larsen on it. With no body, Linden wants to hand it off to the sex crimes unit. Holder wants them to look into it.

We cut to Stan Holder (a mover) at a job. His wife Mitch calls him home with a plumbing emergency. Before he heads back out for work Mitch tells him 17-year old daughter Rosie has finally said she'll apply for colleges, provided they are out-of-state.

We see city councilman and mayoral candidate Darren Richmond by himself at a cemetery. He's called away by Jamie, his campaign manager. At headquarters he is greeted by Jamie and Gwen Eaton, his top advisor. It sounds like Richmond and Gwen are lovers. During a campaign meeting Richmond tells his staff that he's been told he's getting an endorsement from Ruth Yitanes an influential councilwoman. We're less than a month from the election and the sense is that Richmond has a good chance to win.

Linden and Holder show up at the Larsen's looking for Stan. Mitch tells them her husband was home all weekend. On the way out Linden notices a pink bike and asks if they have a daughter. Mitch said Rosie was at a friend's house all weekend but hasn't spoken with her since Friday.

At school Rosie's friend Sterling is panicking trying to find out of if anyone knows where Rosie is. In the hall the principal and Bennett, her teacher, ask her about Rosie. She says Rose was with her but Bennett immediately knows she is lying.

Mitch tells Holder Rosie may have been wearing a pink sweater. Mitch gets a call with confirmation that Rosie did not stay at Sterling's house like she told her parents. Linden glances into Rosie's room and sees a huge butterfly collage on the wall. No one has seen Rosie since a Halloween dance Friday night.

Just before going on stage for a debate at Rosie's school with the mayor, Richmond asks Gwen to move in with him. She won't, using the single female vote as part of the reason. She adds that she knows where he was that morning and ""I wish you'd talk to me about her.""

When Richmond and the mayor find out about the police investigation they decide to cancel a scheduled assembly. The mayor takes Richmond aside and mentions Yitanes' endorsement which Richmond had told his staff to keep hush-hush.

Bennett tells Linden and Holder that Rosie was dressed as a witch for the dance. Linden gets a call from Jack's school.

Sterling asks a kid about someone named Jasper. She asks if Rosie was with him. The friend says Jasper's parents were out of town and thinks she might have been over there.

We cut to a shirtless kid on the couch of a nice house playing video games and ignoring his phone. He looks back and we see a girl with dark hair tossing and turning up in the bedroom.

Jack was caught smoking cigarettes. She drops him off with friend before getting a call from Holder. Jack's doesn't want to move and hasn't fully accepted Rick.

Mitch's sister Terry and the Larsen's two young sons come home from school. Mitch finally tracks down Stan to tell him about Rosie.

Mitch tells Stan she though Rosie was no longer dating Jasper.

The K-9 unit found a scent in the wooded area from the opening chase scene but nothing has been found. Holder thinks the area is a dead-end but Linden isn't so sure.

Richmond tells Jamie and Gwen about the endorsement information getting out. Jamie want them to take advantage of missing girl was He gets a call from an old girlfriend and staffer who says a reporter is asking about ""trips"" he took that nobody besides she, Gwen and Jamie know about. And she hasn't told anyone.

Stan tracks down Sterling, who tells him she thinks Rosie is at Jasper's house. Stan calls Mitch to say he's on his way to pick her up. She's relieved.

Linden gets a call from Oakes about Rosie apparently being with an old boyfriend. He wants to shut down the investigation. The still aren't finding anything near where the scent was located.

Stan bursts into Jasper's home (the video game kid) looking for Rosie. He barges upstairs and sees the girl Jasper has in his bed is not Rosie.

Rick gives Linden a call to talk about that night. While she listens she seems to notice something on the map. She then spots kids headed somewhere with fishing poles. There is a nearby lake. We cut to the police pulling a car out of the lake.

Stan calls Mitch with news about Rosie not being at Jasper's. He's headed to the place they found Rosie's sweater and happens upon a police road block. With Mitch still listening on his phone he runs up the check point and is stopped by officers. Up the road an officer tells Linden the car was registered to the Richmond campaign. The trunk of the car is popped and Linden looks down at a girl's body. She tells Stan only that he can't be there, but he (and Mitch via the phone) clearly knows what has happened.

Stan and Mitch identify Rosie's body at the morgue. Afterwards they are questioned by Linden and Holder. Stan says Rosie was a quite girl who liked spending time with her brothers and was usually home on the weekends. Rosie has no political connections they were aware of.

Oakes tells the detectives there is no cause of death and asks Linden if she will stick around another day because of the delicacy of the political component. Linden tells Rick she have to miss her flight and he's good-natured about the change.

Linden and Holder ask the Larsen's not tell anyone about Rosie's death for at least another day or so. Stan asks if they will find who killed Rosie. Much to Linden's dismay Holder promises ""yes.""

Richmond and Gwen are called to his office to meet with Linden and Holder. They learn about the car and about Rosie, who after a check has no connection with Richmond whatsoever. Richmond agrees to help the investigation by not announcing anything related until the next night. Once the police leave Jamie and Gwen want Richmond to ignore his promise, in part because they don't want Yitanes to hear the news from someone else. He agrees to a press conference the next day at noon just after a short meeting with the councilwoman. When the room has cleared Richmond tells Gwen a reporter told him he was tipped off about the Yitanes endorsement. Someone sent an email from the office but the reporter wouldn't say whom.

It turn out the campaign vehicle had been reported stolen on Saturday morning. The workers were known to leave the keys inside the cars.

Mitch and Stan have a sleepless night. They tell Terry (who doesn't yet know Rosie is dead) they will try and keep the boys away from the police investigation as much as possible.

Jasper grabs Sterling outside the school, pissed that she told Stan Rosie was with him. Bennett tells them the police are at school to question some of the kids.

Sterling tells Holder she doesn't have any idea where Rosie went and Jasper did not go the dance. Jasper tells Linden he picked up an older woman at a bar on Friday night. During questioning Jasper's important-looking father shows up and shuts down the process. After clearing the room he slaps Jasper violently across the face, asking ""what did you do this time?""

Linden and Holder watch video the school took of the dance. Rosie was dressed as a witch, having lied to her parents about the costume which featured $2,000 shoes. Rosie was a good girl ""with no secrets"" and Linden can't figure out why she was with Jasper. Jasper's only criminal background is a stolen car/joy ride, but because his father is incredibly wealthy no charges were pressed. Oakes says the Richmond campaign is about to issue a press release.

While the leaks have turned up empty, Jamie has learned the campaing car was stolen. Councilwoman Yitanes arrives, but before Richmond call tell her about Rosie's murder Gwen pulls him out into the hall to speak with Linden. She convinced him that if he issues the release he'll be ""the candidate who obstructed a child's murder investigation."" He agrees to wait until midnight. After Linden leaves Richmond suggests they tell a reporter about him helping the investigation with the condition being the story doesn't come out until after midnight. He tells Yitanes a bogus story.

Holder finds Rosie's wig in a dumpster outside the school. Inside the detectives get no help from the students, none of whom say they even saw Rosie at the dance.

Mitch and Stan tell their sons that Rosie has died.

Richmond meets privately with the investigator who looked at the campaign e-mail accounts. The investigator initially never checked Jamie or Gwen's account and Richmond instructs him to do so.

Holder tells Linden he's going to stay at the school and do some more digging. It's technically now his case. Linden leaves to pick-up Jack, essentially resigned from the case.

The Larsen's arrive home to Terry cleaning up after the cops. When they're alone Terry asks Mitch ""Why didn't you call her? All weekend?""

Holder lingers after the girls team's soccer practice, smoking what appears to be weed off the side. Two girls approach him and he offers them a few hits. He starts talking about wanting to find a play to ""party."" The second they mention something ""in the basement, the cage,"" he walks away.

We see Holder walking through the basement with a flashlight. He comes to a chain link fence and starts straight ahead.

Linden and Jack sit in her office while she watches footage of Rosie. After Jack leaves Oakes walks in and tells Linden Rosie was still alive when the car was run into the lake, and that the drowning girl ripped off her fingernails trying to get out of the trunk. Linden repeats that she's not going to stay, but then is intrigued after walking into the hallway and seeing the crime scene unit head out.

At work Stan stares at a picture Rosie made for him as a child. When he returns home Mitch is nowhere to be found and the boys haven't been fed.

On the way to a political appearance Richmond gets a call from a reporter asking him to confirm that Rosie's body was found in one of his campaign cars. He says ""No comment"" and hangs up.

Linden shows up in the school basement and asks Holder what is going on: ""This is where the real Halloween party went down,"" he says, pointing to a corner. She looks over and sees a filthy mattress lying on the floor. Next to it appears to be Rosie's witch hat.

Stan opens Rosie's door and finds Mitch curled up in the bed starting straight ahead at the wall.

Linden looks closely at the wall next to the mattress and sees a bloody handprint."

Councilman Richmond is confronted by the press about his car's connection to the Rosie Larsen murder. He talks about cooperating with the police about this senseless and brutal crime and he offers condolences to the Larsen family.

Holder and Sarah investigate the weird crime scene in the cage. There is drug paraphernalia. Sarah wonders if it's an OD that went wrong, then notices a peephole in the wall and looks through it. Her boss tells her it's still her problem at least until the end of the week even though she's already resigned. The principal comes down to the basement and surveys the scene with horror.

Richmond is pissed when he arrives at his event. Then Yitanes marches in, also pissed that he didn't tell her. He says the police told him not to. She pulls her endorsement saying ""We are over!""

The principal brings Sarah and Holder further into ""the cage"" in the basement. The peephole goes into a storage area that looks out onto the bed where Rosie was presumably killed. The custodian had keys to the area.

At the Larsen house Stan is struggling to take care of the boys in the wake of the murder. They want chocolate chip pancakes for dinner. Stan is game and says not to wake Mitch. One of the boys asks how Rosie died. The other assures Stan it's okay, that he doesn't have to talk about it.

Holder asks how long Sarah is staying. She says a week and tells him to chill out. They go to look for the custodian, Linden Johnson Rosales, from the school at a rundown apartment. They talk to a woman who speaks Spanish and says he is not there and doesn't live there. Sarah looks around.and finds copies of ""Nasty Cheerleaders"" magazine. The suspect is there, however, and attacks Sarah with an edged weapon, then leaps out the three story window and fractures his skull.

At the hospital Sarah sees Richmond on the evening news. She gets stitched up from the attack. Holder discovers Linden's got warrants but he's not their guy because he spent the weekend in the drunk tank. Sarah says to keep an eye on him and call her when he wakes up.

She calls Rick and tells him she's staying through the weekend and has been asked to see it through. He's annoyed. She says they'll be there Sunday for the party and that she still wants to get married. He hangs up without responding to her ""I love you."" She goes to pick up Jack from Reggie's. He's out cold. Reggie is a female friend of Sarah's who owns a boat. She talks about hoping for a fresh start for Jack in California. Sarah thanks her for letting her and Jack stay. Reggie calls them her two favorite people in the world and is happy to do it. Sarah gets in bed with Jack and falls asleep, even though she said she had to get back to work. Reggie lets her sleep.

Day Three

Mitch wakes to the sound of Rosie's voice on the outgoing answering machine message. Meanwhile Stan is staring at the rain and despairing. He picks up the morning paper and Rosie's murder is the lead story. He sees that Councilman Richmond has been questioned. Mitch plays the message again. Stan finds her kneeling over the machine and listening. He kneels down with her hugs her.

Richmond goes to see the mayor, his opponent, who tells him the race is clearly over now and so he should bow out and in four years get his endorsement. Richmond declines saying Adams will just get on his knees for the developers for four more years. Adams taunts Richmond, musing if his opponent really thought the police would keep it secret for him.

Richmond goes to Sarah, livid. She says the leak didn't come from them. She asks what she can do. He says ""make an arrest.""

Back at the high school the teacher gets the class under control -- by confiscating a 'phone from a student -- and starts talking about Rosie and grief counselors. Sterling runs from the class. So does Jasper.

Sarah meets up with Holder at the hospital. Rosales is out of surgery but hazy from drugs. Holder distracts the guard and Sarah goes to talk to Rosales. She apologizes and tells him the real reason she needs to talk to him. She shows him a picture of Rosie and asks if he saw her in the basement Friday night. He nods. Sarah shows him a page from Rosie's yearbook and asks which boy she was with. He points to Jasper and another boy, Kris Echols. The nurse comes in and freaks that Rosales is in critical condition and they're bothering him and demanding that leave. As Sarah departs, Rosales whispers to her ""El Diablo.""

Richmond tells his staff that they're doing everything to cooperate with the police and they need to take a deep breath and stay the course. He tells them to commit to winning this campaign. Gwen and Jamie have got stuff worked up for Richmond to address the press. First he goes to talk to his guy Nathan investigating the leaked E-mails. There's nothing on Rosie Larsen but there is a leak on the Yitanes endorsement.

Holder learns that Kris Echols is a meth-dealing skater boy, kicked out of school, reported as a runaway by his mom. He and Sarah and the lieutenant talk about the case. Holder goes to talk to Echols' family while Sarah plans to talk to the Larsens' about the cause of death. Going over the party video one more time they realize how Echols got into the party, he wore a devil's mask: ""El Diablo.""

Echols skates up to a dumpster and pulls out a newspaper with the news about Rosie's body being found.

On a TV, the mayor crows about his new 44.6 million dollar waterfront renewal project.

Gwen switches it off saying she can't believe he didn't throw in a jab about Rosie's murder. Richmond says he didn't have to, the damage is done. Gwen says Yitanes hasn't endorsed him yet and they need to stay on message. He says to spare him the soundbite, he's found their leak, the person who went to the press about Yitanes. It was Jamie. Gwen can't understand. They wonder if he's playing both sides, if Richmond doesn't win than maybe Adams will give him an appointment. At the moment Jamie enters and asks about the rest of the day's agenda. He suggests sending flowers to the Larsen's. Richmond says no, since flowers die.

Sarah goes to speak to the Larsens. She explains that Rosie drowned. That she was alive in the trunk of the car when it went in the water. Sarah says she thought they should know. They are understandably upset, about that and finding out about Richmond in the paper. She says they are working on an arrest. She asks about Kris Echols. They had been friends. She asks if Rosie drank or used drugs. They say no and are wondering why she's asking. She says they're casting a wide net. Stan says Kris seemed like a good kid. Mitch asks if she suffered. Sarah says they think she was unconscious when the car went in, not disclosing the information about her shredded findertips from trying to claw her way out of the truck.

Richmond has a photo op playing basketball against a young black kid. He loses. It's part of an ""all-stars"" program that is supposed to be part of Richmond's anti-gang campaign. The press asks again about Rosie. They offer little. Jamie tells him to stop giving them anything. Richmond mentions the leak. Jamie says it was the cops, that everyone is playing both sides. Richmond doesn't tip his hand.

Holder interviews Kris' heart-broken mom who says he started using drugs at 13. She hasn't seen him in awhile, most recently at a horrible area near a bridge where the lost boys hang out.

Holder goes down there and smokes some ""pot,"" mingling with the kids. He asks around about Kris as if he's looking for drugs. A girl asks if he's a cop. He asks if he looks like a cop, countering by asking if she's a cop. She says Kris isn't around but will be later.

He heads back to Sarah in the car, who smells the pot. He tells her it's ""narc scent,"" smells and tastes like weed but isn't. They note the skate park is walking distance from the campaign parking lot and Kris could've stolen the car. They decide to wait it out.

Jamie suggests a way to get Yitanes' endorsement back, hire her husband, a plumber, for a job that she can't hire him for. Bribery, essentially. Gwen shows him the incriminating E-mail. He sputters his account must have been hacked. They aren't having it. Jamie says Richmond is letting sex -- i.e. his relationship with Gwen -- cloud his judgement. Richmond isn't having that either. Jamie says ""screw both of you"" and angrily leaves.

Sarah calls Jack with the news she won't be home for dinner, as she and Holder still wait in the car. Echols arrives at the skate park. Holder and Sarah go to talk to him. He tries to take off, they try to question him. Holder puts the grab on him and Sarah says to let him go. As Kris takes off, Holder tells him that his mom is worried about him.

Yitanes goes to Richmond mad that he said in the papers she's still considering endorsing him. She says she thought she made herself clear. He offers his proposition, for her and her husband. She is shocked by his flagrant attempt at bribery. He says he needs her sway with the union and her husband needs a job. She says he must think she's easy. He says nothing's easy with her.

The 'phone that the teacher confiscated earlier rings in his desk. He looks at it, concerned.

Kris goes and finds Jasper at the school and punches him out, thinking he ratted him out to the police about being at the dance. Jasper says he didn't tell them anything. Kris says ""they know"" and takes off. Sarah and Holder watch this. Sarah notes that Rosie wouldn't have gone in the basement alone with Kris, but she would've gone with someone she trusted like Jasper. Holder wants to grab him but Sarah says they have nothing. Her 'phone rings -- it's news from the teacher.

Stan is working on the chocolate chip pancakes, when Mitch comes out and offers to help. He says he's got it and tells her to take a bath and relax before they eat. Stan keeps making the pancakes. The older boy Tommy sets a place for Rosie and then apologizes, saying he forgot. Stan says it's okay and tells him to leave it. Mitch runs her bath and looks in the mirror. Stan and the boys sit down to eat. Mitch gets in the bath and lets herself sink under, she comes up gasping for air and begins to cry.

At the police station the cops watch video from the confiscated phone. It is Jasper and Kris having rough sex with Rosie on the bed in ""the cage,"" it does not appear to be consensual. At the very least it is very rough and cruel. The Lieutenant tells them to pick the boys up. That's called RAPE.

At a photo op, Yitanes gives her endorsement to Richmond, just as Jamie's walking out in the background, his personal effects in a cardboard box.

Stan and the boys eat pancakes. Mitch cries in the bathroom.

Sarah re-watches the video of the boys with Rosie in the basement."

He appears to be going through withdrawal symptoms. Echols tells Linden he did nothing wrong as Holder brings in a TV. He says he had nothing to do with Rosie's death and Linden puts on a video of Rosie talking about the future. ""Tell her you didn't kill her,"" Linden says.

Jasper is brought in with his attorney. The plan is for Linden to question Jasper and Holder to stick with Echols.

Jasper's lawyer tells Linden to direct questions to him. Jasper responds ""What video?"" when Linden says they have a video with him and Rose taken the night of her murder.

We see Stan and Mitch shopping for Rosie's coffin. Mitch takes a liking to one of the more expensive ones.

Richmond and Gwen meet with a pollster who tells them he's getting killed by Mayor Adams in the latest polls despite getting the Yitanes endorsement. He suggests a large ad buy. After he leaves Gwen thinks they should help their financially struggling campaign by visiting Tom Drexler, a man Richmond calls a ""rich lunatic."" Richmond doesn't want to go to him but Gwen reminds him how much Drexler hates Adams. Richmond asks only for her to get his donors list.

After the video plays Jasper says ""It's not what you think.""

Holder works on ""breaking"" Echols, who has good things to say about Rosie. Linden pops in to tell him something but Holder sends her away before putting on the video. Echols says ""That's what you got?""

We see Adams meet with Jamie in a bar. He asks Jamie to join his campaign and get with ""a winning team for once.""

Richmond is having no luck with donors. We see in another Gwen make a call to a ""Senator Eaton.""

Linden sits down with Sterling and asks why she didn't tell them it was her on the video in the cage with Jasper and Echols. The blood was from one of her nose bleeds and she put on Rosie's costume from that night because Jasper ""thought it would be funny."" Rosie had already left the dance when they went downstairs. Sterling didn't know where she went and says Rosie changed dramatically after breaking up with Jasper. She saw her get on the 108 bus a number of times and thinks Rosie met someone ""she couldn't tell anyone about.""

As Linden and Holder leave the school they wonder about places Rosie might have hid love letters. Linden is supposed to meet the Larsens later and Holder will check the bus route -- which doesn't go near the Larsens' home.

Gwen meets with Senator Eaton, her father. She has him work on a meeting with Drexler.

The Larsens tell Linden they don't recognize the key or expensive shoes Rose had with her and they don't think she would date an adult -- ""she's not like that."" When Linden leaves to take a call the Larsens accidentally see some of Rosie's crime scene photos.

Richmond brings Gwen to a function attended by both Drexler (who appears to own the city's basketball team) and Adams. The obnoxious Drexler throws a basketball to Richmond and suggests he play the mayor for the office. Richmond isn't happy.

The bus driver doesn't recognize the picture of Rosie but Linden convinces him to keep looking.

Linden goes to Regi's boat looking for Jack and is surprised by Rick. He apologizes for how he acted on the phone and they fool around.

Stan and Mitch meet with the priest who will be conducting Rosie's funeral service. After the priest assures Mitch that Rosie is with God, Mitch responds ""My daughter, she was out there alone. She was hurt and she was alone. Tell me: Where was God then?""

Out on the patio Drexler tells Richmond he likes him. He hands him a check for $50,000 despite the fact Richmond says he can't offer him anything. Drexler doesn't seem to mind as long as he can play a part in the defeat of Adams.

Stan takes his employee Belko to a home. Stan says he recently bought the house as a surprise for the family but realizes now he must sell it. Belko offers to help him ""take care of"" Richmond like they did back in the old days. Stan curtly says ""I don't do that anymore.""

In school we see that Sterling is having a rough time of it. She runs into Mitch in the hallway and the two embrace. Sterling says Rosie looked happy the night of the dance and thinks ""maybe"" Rosie could have been seeing someone secretly. Stan goes to see a man who appears to be a higher-up in some type of organized crime. Stan mentions his debts and asks for help. Despite reminding him that for 17 years Stan ignored him on the street, he peels off a bunch of cash. The man tells Stan ""family comes first,"" but Stan tells him they were never family before taking the money.

The bus changes drivers and the new guy tells Holder he does recognize Rosie, as few white people ever traveled to the end of his route, where she would get off.

Linden notices a pack of cigarettes Jack hid in his pillow case.

As Mitch sits across from Rosie's locker she is approached by her teacher Ahmed. He has overwhelmingly positive things to say about Rosie. Kids like her were ""why I got into teaching in the first place.""

Stan goes into Rosie's room and looks around. He smells some of Rosie's clothes but is disturbed by Linden who let herself in the home when she found the front door open. She needs to search Rosie's room. On his way out Stan tells Linden she never should have lied to them about Rosie not suffering. Linden goes right for Rosie's pillow but finds nothing.

In Ahmed's classroom he tells Mitch about a favorite author of Rosie's and gives her Rosie's favorite book.

Rick comes home to find Jack alone on the boat. The two appear to be bonding.

At the end of the line Holder follows a kid in a letterman's jacket down a flight of stairs.

In a remote parking lot Richmond meets with Jamie. Jamie is ""in"" with the Adams but we see he's clearly still with Richmond. Richmond is sure Adams planted the leak within his campaign, but the mayor hasn't admitted it to Jamie yet.

Holder walks into an after school program covered with signs for the Richmond campaign. A man recognizes Rosie's picture and says she would come in with a certain guy. He points Holder to a picture in a trophy case.

A dejected Linden absent-mindedly turns on a globe and sees that it is filled with letters. She starts reading what seem to be love letters.

Richmond is using Drexler's money for advertising.

We see Stan stash the new cash in a drawer at his office.

Holder looks at the picture of a youth basketball team. The coach has hair just like Rosie's teacher Ahmed.

He sent his wife out of town because a flooring company was supposed to come to the house and do work. Ahmed says the company cancelled on him. He had access to Richmond campaign cars but never used them. He gives them an envelope which contains evidence of her talent as a student.

Noticing the family is out of milk for his cereal, we see Denny Larsen grab cash out of his father's wallet. Tommy Larsen is wetting his bed. Denny walks to the store. When Tommy notices Denny is eating Rosie's favorite cereal he says he'll tell their parents: ""Go ahead,"" Denny says. ""They don't care about us.""

Gwen tells Richmond they've pulled to within five points of the mayor. She's booked a big-time director for his new TV spot. He's still being hurt by Rosie's story and she wants him to ask the Larsen's to appear with him.

Richmond meets with Jamie, who is being taken to the mayor's special place that day. Richmond wants him to get the mayor drunk. Jamie is worried because he doesn't drink. He tells Richmond he still thinks Gwen was the mole.

Linden and Holder watch the video Ahmed gave them. It is something Rosie made. Linden wonders if during her filming she might have ""seen something she shouldn't have seen.""

Mitch tells Terry she'll go the store for some groceries.

A roof issue has come up with the home Stan purchased. Clients are cancelling on Stan because they've worried about the awkwardness of dealing with him. Belko says he has a friend who works at Rosie's school and offers to see if he can get some info about who the cops are looking into. Stan isn't interested.

Rick is heading back to California. He asks whether she'll take an interest in Rosie the same way he did the kid with drawings. He doesn't expect her to drop the case in time for a barbecue with his family.

Mitch runs into Richmond at the grocery store. He references his wife, but can't bring himself to ask her about appearing with him.

Richmond gets into a car in the parking lot and lies to Gwen, telling her Mitch wasn't there.

Jamie sits with the mayor and one of his top aides at a lodge significant to the mayor's family. The drinks are poured and the mayor tells Jamie he'd be the last person he'd tell if he had someone inside Richmond's campaign.

Linden orders non-refundable plane tickets to California for her and Jack.

Holder (who is counting cash he says he won at blackjack) tells Linden that Ahmed lied about the flooring company canceled on him. It was the other way around.

A drunk Jamie tells he left because he got tired of Richmond's ethics. Jamie goes to the bathroom to puke. The mayor joins him in there and references Yitanes having a background with planting people inside his campaign. The mayor doesn't seem to suspect Jamie.

Belko helps Tommy cover-up his bed-wetting and tells him he won't tell his parents.

Mitch and Stan drop off the dress Rosie will be buried in. The funeral director tells them they can see her in it if they wait.

Jaime tells Richmond the plant came from Yitanes. Richmond thinks her goal was to make sure her husband got the contact. Jaime points out that Gwen used to work for Yitanes. Richmond asks Jamie to cross-check his staff E-mails with Yitanes.

After seeing Rosie in her dress Mitch and Stan stop at a gas station. Stan says he needs to get oil, but goes to the bathroom and weeps. He returns to the car and tells Mitch they were out of oil.

Gwen meets with the hotshot director. He makes reference to their having a sexual history together and wonders if that's why he's there.

Holder suggests to Linden a scenario where Ahmed has Rosie over that night and something happened.

Principal Meyers tells Linden and Holder that Ahmed and Rosie's relationship was professional, but references his having an incident with a student at his last school. She also says that Ahmed's wife was one of his former students.

Linden and Holder visit Amber Ahmed at her home. She is very pregnant. Amber says that Ahmed wrote her notes when she was an 18-year old senior. Amber is due in a week and tells Holder the night of the dance Ahmed called her at 10pm on his cell phone. Linden excuses herself to use the bathroom and find chemicals in the nursery. One of them is ammonium hydroxide.

Holder wants to pick-up Ahmed. Linden says they need to link Rosie's apartment first. She asks the lab to check Rosie's file for ammonium hydroxide.

Jamie sends Richmond a file with Yitanes' plant. It turns out to be Nathan, the same staffer he earlier had looking into everybody's E-mails.

Later than day Yitanes comes to see Richmond. He confronts her about Nathan and says she will continue to endorse him or he'll turn her in for what is a felony. On her way out she tells Gwen that Richmond had Nathan look into her E-mails as well. Gwen is pissed.

Mitch returns home when Denny is in the bath. She walks into the show and yells at him to get out of the tub. Denny looks terrified.

Richmond arrives at his commercial shoot. Gwen has replaced the director.

Linden learns that Rosie had ammonium hydroxide on her hands, nails and even in her lungs. The stuff is used for flooring, but could also be used to cover-up sexual assault and other evidence. Whoever used the stuff is probably experienced.

Stan tells Belko he wants to know who the cops are looking at.

Linden tells Oakes she's looking into the possibility Ahmed could be a serial killer. Okes tell Linden and Holder there still isn't enough evidence to charge Ahmed and sends them off to canvas his neighborhood.

Mitch and Stan discuss exactly when he got the cufflinks from Rosie. They begin to argue over Rosie's age at the time.

Richmond apologizes to Gwen for not trusting her and tells her about Jamie being back. His new spot has begun airing that morning. He has a debate with that mayor that night and Jamie feels it is a huge opportunity. Principal Meyers shows up and tells Richmond that the cops are looking into Ahmed. She's eyeing a school board gig down the road. Richmond walks back into the room and sees the new spot featuring him with his arm around Ahmed.

Holder finds a man across the street from the Ahmeds who says he saw Rosie knocking on their door at 10 pm the night of the dance.

He says she was there returning a book but when Linden asks to look for the book he says no unless they have a search warrant.

Outside Holder thinks they should pick him up. Linden says it's still circumstantial and thinks Ahmed was lying when he says he was the one to let Rosie in the house that night.

Richmond's ad has been pulled. Jamie and Gwen want him to distance himself from Ahmed. But former attorney Richmond doesn't want to effectively convict a man who hasn't been charged.

Linden is at the funeral church.

A conflicted Holder meets with what seems to be a former partner. The guy tells him Stan used to be a hit man for a mob and had a serious gambling problem.

Linden gets a call confirming the time Ahmed stayed at the dance that night.

Rosie's body is brought into the church and one of her brother's asks to help as a pall bearer. Linden is not allowed in.

Linden calls Holder and tells him video from the dance proves Ahmed couldn't have let Rosie in at 10pm. They think it must have been Amber. Richmond pulls up and asks Linden whether she thinks Ahmed is guilty. She doesn't answer him.

Holder interviews Amber's sister. She says Amber didn't show up until 1 am that night, and was crying, upset because Ahmed had ""been keeping secrets."" The sister doesn't seem thrilled with Ahmed's religion.

The Ahmeds' downstairs neighbor calls Linden to complain about a neighbor who spies on them with a telescope. Linden speaks with the man, who seems like a paranoid with some force of mild mental illness. He says that around midnight the night of the dance he saw Ahmed and a woman carrying a woman who was wrapped in a blanket and ""not moving.""

Linden and Holder walk over to the Ahmeds' place. No one answers and we see that Amber is inside holding a hammer.

Linden and Holder head to the reception to pick up Ahmed. At this point Holder tells Linden about Stan's background in organized crime. She tells him to immediately call Ahmed.

We see an eerily calm Stan offer to give Ahmed a ride home from the reception. Ahmed leaves his phone behind.

While Holder yells at the agents for detaining homicide Linden looks around and notices the room has been setup for a girl to live there. She spots a pink sweater. One of the agents tells them they may have compromised a terrorism investigation.

In the street outside Oakes rips them a new one for breaking into the room without a warrant. Linden thinks the room may be where Rosie was held but Oakes says the feds have taken over and they'll get a briefing from a joint terrorism taskforce the following morning.

Linden goes to Regi's. She calls one of the techs and asks them to send to Rosie's computer, which she sees that Jack has been using. She calls Rick and one of his female co-workers answers. She tells him he's tied-up and can't come to the phone. Regi pops her head out and make a crack about Rick figuring out ""you don't really want to go."" Linden starts to look at Rosie's crime scene pictures on the laptop.

Stan is struggling to keep the business going while taking care of the boys. He asks Mitch where she was the night before. She lies and says she was at the market.

With the news about Ahmed and the mosque continuing to hurt his poll numbers, Richmond tells Gwen and Jamie he wants to fight the All Star's having its funding cut and hit Adams on some of his old weaknesses. Jamie likes that Richmond is going to play dirty, but since Ahmed is being liked to terrorism they need more. He's going to have a P.I. look into Adams, but Richmond warns him he doesn't want to go for personal stuff.

Linden finds the fed raiding her office and all of her files. Oakes shows her the front page of the paper. Someone has leaked Rosie's crime scene photos and he's furious. Linden clearly suspects Holder was behind the leak and he's not allowed into the briefing.

Principal Meyers calls Ahmed and tell him to stay home for a few days.

The fed tells Linden and Oakes they've been investigating a suspect named ""Mohammed H."" who has made border crossings and may be connected to radical elements within the mosque. They've connected Mohammed to that room they were in, as well as to maps of border areas and falsified passports with multiple young females. Usually the girls are not Caucasian. They won't tell Linden anything about Mohammed.

Mitch is going to take the boys to school. She starts the car with the garage still closed and runs back inside to grab something. While there she hears a news report that shows pictures of Rosie's body. She sits down, seeming to forget the boys are in a closed garage with a running car. Terry comes home and opens the garage. The boys are fine and totally oblivious.

Jamie goes to see Drexler about getting some more money for the campaign. When Drexler figures out they don't really have anything on Adams he says he's got some dirty on the mayor that even he had been too principled to share.

Linden brushes Holder off in the office, not revealing anything about the meeting with the feds. Outside she runs into Mitch who is upset about the photos being leaked. Mitch doesn't think the department is doing anything.

Richmond is initially shot down by a judge (a buddy of Adams) in his challenge of the council yanking the All Star's funding. Gwen points out that early on Richmond didn't want to go negative. Jamie walks in with a file on Adam he's gotten from Drexler. Gwen immediately says they can't use it, Richmond says he's going to think about it.

Linden goes to the feds' staging area pretending to be someone official needing to look at the evidence. The guy doesn't buy it, but when she walks away she goes into one of the files and takes a picture of the pink sweater.

Ahmed tells Amber about being given time off from work. When she asks why he hasn't given the cops any information about Mohammed he snaps at her.

Mitch confirms for Linden that the sweater was Rosie's. She getting angry that Ahmed is walking free.

Oakes tells Linden that the case has basically been shutdown. The federal case takes priority and Mitch's ID of the shirt doesn't matter. She's convinced Rosie has nothing to do with the terrorism case but Oakes points out there is no proof of that. He criticizes her treatment of Holder and she tells him she has reservations about his abilities. Oakes thinks maybe she should finally head to California.

In the car an angry Linden calls Rick. Once again she gets voicemail. She sees Holder walk out of the station with his old narcotics buddy and decides to follow.

Terry tells Stan about Mitch leaving the boys in the garage with a running car.

Linden follows Holder to an out of the way building. Inside she sees that it is a narcotics anonymous meeting of some kind and Holder is getting recognition for six months of sobriety. He tells a sad story of rock bottom as Linden listens. Her phone rings and Holder looks over as she ducks upstairs.

The phone call for Linden is from a parent of one of Jack's classmates. Apparently Jack emailed the Rosie crime scene photos to a bunch of his friends.

Richmond listens to the parole hearing for the woman who killed his wife while drunk driving. The woman talks about forgiveness as he silently watches. Afterwards Richmond walks into a bathroom at the courthouse. He punches a mirror violently.

Back at the office there is more bad news concerning Richmond losing potential voters. Jamie hopes they will use the dirt on Adams but Gwen doesn't think Richmond will go for. Jamie hints at leaking it himself and Gwen threatens to ruin his career if he does. To Gwen's surprise Richmond calls and instructs them to leak the Adam dirt.

Linden confronts Jack about what he did. Her son is obviously angry at their situation and asks to be sent to live with his father, who Linden says left they years ago. ""I'm all you've got,"" she tells him.

Mitch comes home to find Stan has taken down some of the things in Rosie's room. He says they need to look to the future and she points out its only been a week. He makes reference to what could have happened to the boys.

We see that the dirt on Adams was that he had paid for a woman's apartment. The speculation is that the former intern was his mistress. Richmond and his staff watch the woman accosted by press at her home.

Holder meet Linden at Regi's place. The seem to come to an understanding, with Linden saying she no longer has concern about him. He tells her he's put a tap on Ahmed's phone and says a judge friend of his will help make it stick legally if they find anything.

We see Mitch putting Rosie's things back where they were.

Richmond seems torn at the latest developments.

Amber overhears Ahmed speaking in a heated tone to someone. He tells the person ""passports will be arriving tomorrow"" and assures the person the police know nothing.

The episode ends with Holder getting a call that they've got something on the Ahmed wire."

They are talking about ""the room"" and that the fact the police know about ""the girl."" Muhammed is asking Ahmed for help. He says they just need to stay calm and mentions in English that the passports will be arriving soon and everything will be over. Holder thinks this is the smoking gun. All he has to do is get his buddy judge to give them after-the-fact approval.

Linden gets a call from Mitch. She wants to know whether Ahmed's been arrested yet. Linden tells her everything will be wrapped-up that night.

Stan comes home and finds Mitch waiting for him. She tells him that Ahmed is about to be arrested and the couple embraces.

Mayor Adams holds a press conference to address the story about the woman. Not only does he say he is physically unable to father a child -- having had a ""procedure"" years earlier -- but that he believes the story is a smear attempt by Richmond.

Damage control is in full effect at the Richmond campaign. Jamie is telling a reporter it wasn't them. Richmond is upset the story has now come down to his word against Adams'. Linden shows up asking for more records about Richmond's campaign vehicles.

We see a conversation between Adams and his aide that lets us know the woman is absolutely a former mistress. He's paying her to keep quiet and paying a doctor friend to falsify records saying he had a vasectomy. Adams is told the machinists' union is about to abandon Richmond.

Holder's judge buddy refuses to sign the warrant when he says one of the pages has been ""redacted."" He thinks shoddy police work is happening.

Holder calls Linden with the bad news about the warrant.

The next day Oakes rips Linden and Holder after being told Holder sought out an illegal tap. Linden takes the heat but it doesn't matter -- the investigation seems in deep trouble.

With Ahmed in the other room Amber looks at his cell phone and writes down Muhammed's phone number.

With the poll numbers not going in the right directions, the Somalis continuing to be vandalized and the machinists on their way out, the Richmond's camp is in trouble. But Richmond tells his aides ""the mud slinging is over.""

Terry finds some of Rosie's textbooks in her car. She brings them to Mitch, who plans to return them to school.

Amber calls the police station looking for Linden, but hangs up before Linden can get to the phone.

During a move Stan has a tender moment with a young girl. Belko notices.

At school Mitch is stunned to see Ahmed walking into the building.

Holder is convinced his career is in danger. Going through a book of Rosie's Linden finds a note that says ""Adela, Friday 11:45.""

Amber, having reconsidered, comes to the station and speaks with Linden and Holder. She gives them Muhammed's phone number and tells them that based on the conversation she overheard she thinks her husband is up to something.

The faculty are also shocked that Ahmed is at work. Principal Meyers reminds Ahmed she told him to stay away until the investigation was over. He says unless she is going to fire him he's going to do his job.

Ahmed's first class proceeds to walk out on him before he can start his lecture. The camera pans and we see that someone has written ""KILLER"" on the board behind him.

Richmond goes to see Gelabi at the mosque. He's upset at what is happening to his community and Richmond promises to help. Gelabi says he heard the same promises from Adams and he's worried the two men are similar.

Linden and Holder learn the GPS from Muhammed's cell phone hasn't moved from a downtown market. On their way out of the station they run into Mitch. She furious that Ahmed is at school ""like nothing ever happened. Free.""

After a brief foot chase in the market, Linden and Hold manage to catch and handcuff Muhammed.

Gwen finds Richmond drinking at a bar, listening to his late wife's favorite song. He tells the story of the night she died after leaving a party. Gwen thinks the race is only over if Richmond isn't willing to tell the public who he really is. She wants him to talk to the voters about his wife, but he doesn't seem ready.

Stan comes home to find Mitch sobbing in Rosie's room. She tells him that Ahmed wasn't arrested and yells at him for saying they should trust the police. She then says ""that man killed our child and you let him go."" Stan fills with wage and leaves the room.

Oakes isn't all that excited about Muhammed unless they can get a confession. Prior to the interview Holder tells Linden that Muhammed has no record whatsoever. There is no reason for him to talk.

Richmond goes to see Drexler (who is shooting hoops in his home) and asks for $5 million. Drexler calls Richmond a loser and Richmond responds that he's at least willing to pick a legitimate fight. Drexler then says that if Richmond can make one basket he'll give him the money, but that if he misses he has to drop out of the race. A confidence Richmond tells Drexler he wants to keep the ball after he makes the shot. As he puts the shot up, the scene ends.

After threatening the possibility his wife could be deported and his kids sent to foster care, Muhammed finally starts to talk. He said that ""she came to (Ahmed's) place"" that night and he let her in. Eventually we realize that Muhammed is talking about Aisha, the Muslim girl who recently went missing. Muhammed says Rosie came by to drop off books that night but left. The two men are trying to move this adolescent girl to Canada to get her away from parents who want to perform ritual female circumcision on her before marriage.

Muhammed takes Holder and Linden to where Aisha is being held. He knocks on the door as Linden's phone rings. She is told that Ahmed never came home that day.

We cut to a van pulling up in a remote location. Stan and Belko get out of the front and open the back of the truck. They yank out a terrified Ahmed, who is pleading with them that he didn't hurt Rosie. He tries to run but Belko catches him.

While looking through Rosie's stuff Mitch finds the pink shirt she thought had been found in the room at the butcher's shop. She immediately calls. He doesn't answer and leaves a voicemail for him to call her.

Aisha answers the door. She seems fine, meaning Muhammed's story checks out.

Stan begins to pummel Ahmed savagely.

Richmond sits at his desk with a basketball in front of him he made the all-or-nothing shot.

Mitch still can't get Stan on the phone.

The beating gets worse. Stan sits on top of Ahmed, punching until he's exhausted and Ahmed is no longer moving. Belko gives Ahmed unconscious body several kicks but Stan pulls him off. Stan stands over Ahmed, seemingly trying to decide what to do next as the episode ends."

Holder and Linden tell Oakes about Ahmed and Muhammed hiding the girl, who they think may now be in Canada. Basically Ahmed is no longer a suspect. Oakes responds that Ahmed is in the hospital and on life support, the result of a horrific beating.

There's a quick shot of Stan at home.

Linden is upset and tells Holder she never should have told the Larsens anything about Ahmed. Holder tries to reassure by saying that if Ahmed had been honest with them the situation would have been different. They get a call that Stan has turned himself in.

Stan is processed. His fingerprints are taken and he has his mug shot taken. He's placed in a cell.

Linden pays Richmond a visit at his home. She tells him Ahmed is no longer a suspect and he responds that ""I never believed he was capable of such a thing."" She then tells him Ahmed is fighting for his life in the hospital. She admits she made a mistake.

Regi tells Linden she came home to find Jack and some friends smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. Jack then called her a ""stupid lesbo"" when she asked them to get lost. Regi blames Linden for not being available for her son. Regi says ""I'm not the babysitter."" An angry Linden wakes up Jack and they check-in to a motel.

There's a quick image of Ahmed in the hospital.

Richmond holds a press conference. He makes a point to reference Ahmed's vindication, current situation and calls out the council for shutting down the after school program.

Gwen and Jamie are tickled at what this means for his image. Richmond tells them he wants to call for a 10% city council pay-cut as a type of ""austerity"" move.

The next morning Holder arrives to find Linden re-evaluating all of the evidence. The big question is where Rosie went after leaving Ahmed's place at 10pm that night. Holder brings up the mob angle and Stan's history of gambling issues. She leaves to talk to Stan, while Holder plans to find Royce.

Linden asks Stan about his association with Janek Kovarsky. Stan says ""that was a long time ago."" Apparently Stan was the one who called 911 for Ahmed to be picked up. She tells him that Ahmed is ""barely"" alive.

Royce initially tells Holder he doesn't know anything about Ahmed. He also says he never worked for Kovarsky. He says Stan helped him get straight and Stan would never do anything to jeopardize his relationship with his family. Holder references the Ahmed beating on his way out and Royce looks stunned.

Stan is arraigned. He's being charged with two counts of kidnapping and attempted murder. He tries to plead guilty. ""I did it,"" he says, but his lawyer changes that to not guilty and whispers that unless he wants to spend the rest of his life in prison ""we're going to need to do some work here."" The judge lets his attorney make the call. Linden's phone one again goes off in appropriately in the back of the court room - it's called vibrate mode, Sarah.

In the hall Linden is told a cabbie is saying he picked up Rosie at Ahmed's.

After consulting his log the cabbie tells Linden he dropped Rosie off at her home.

Mitch pops into the office to check on Royce. She advises him on how to handle an upcoming move.

The cabbie's security camera shows Linden and Holder that Rosie was dropped off at home at 10:37pm. On the video Holder notices that despite the Larsen's being out of town that weekend a front light was on as Rosie is dropped off. But just before she gets out of the cab the light is turned off. It seems somebody was laying in wait for Rosie.

The Larsen boys ask Terry why Stan is in jail instead of ""the bad guy."" She says that sometimes ""you do what you think is right but it ends up being wrong."" Linden and Holder arrive at the house. Terry tells them that other than her and the Larsens, Royce also has keys to the home. She's told Mitch in the past that she doesn't like how much Royce hangs around with the kids.

Royce tells Holder that the night of Rosie's murder he was with his mother, ""Bev."" He says he needs keys because he sometimes needs to do work in the garage when Stan's not around. He says he never goes into the home when the Larsens aren't there.

Holder notices Royce's hands are beat-up and tells Linden he thinks Royce is lying.

Royce's mother tells the detectives Royce was there with her that night. She shows them his room and Holder notices the ceiling is covered with pictures of the Larsen family.

Holder questions Royce at the station. He explains his hands as just part of the job. They tell him Ahmed is innocent and probably is going to die. He starts to change his story about his hands and Holder says all they care about is the truth. He admits to being with Stan and Linden changes the subject to Rosie.

A Richmond staffer finds video of Richmond with Rosie. Jamie and Gwen subtly ask her to leave the disk with them and suggest she doesn't mention it to anyone else. Jamie thinks they should bury the video and doesn't think Richmond needs to know anything.

Linden asks Royce about his mother and the promiscuous past she admitted to when the detectives were at the house. She starts to imply that Royce had a thing for Rosie and the night of her murder he saw an opportunity to have her for himself. Royce freaks out and calls Linden a ""dirty bitch."" Royce begins to cry uncontrollably. He says he enjoys sitting in the Larsens' house when nobody is there. That night Rosie came home when he was home alone. He says he hid when Rosie got there. He heard her on the phone with someone named ""Adela."" Rosie then left and he never saw her again. His biggest worry is the family will find out they were there.

Mitch comes home and answers the work phone. It is the bank telling her that their account is overdrawn and their savings account is empty. She thinks there should have been $16,000 in the account.

Linden tells Holder she believes Royce's story. There is nobody connected to Rosie with the name Adela. The next step is to go through the phonebook and interview the people with that first name. Linden wants to start right away but Holder hasn't slept in two days and leaves to get some rest.

At the motel Linden finds Rick sitting outside the door. She says what's happened is because of Rosie and not their relationship. He thinks there will always be some reason for her not to move them forward. He has three tickets for Oakland on a flight leaving in a few hours. He asks if she'll be on the flight and she stutters. Rick leaves.

Jack is awake inside the room. She tells him ""it's going to be okay."" He lies down in bed without saying a word.

Linden goes for a run the next morning. She stops by a large ferry with the name ""Adela"" (gasp!). She notices a sign listing its daily departure times.

Linden gets on the ship and we see that it provides rides to the Wapi Eagle Casino. The symbol for the casino is identical to the key chain found on Rosie the night she died."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861179/?ref_=ttep_ep11,,"When Linden gets a call from her son's school saying he hasn't been there for three days, she and Holder travel across the city to find him.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Nicole Kassell'],[''],[],['title directed by female'],[],"Linden is looking around inside the Wapi Eagle casino. Casino manager Nicole Jackson mentions minors aren't allowed in her business and security chief Roberta Drays is strangely adamant that Rosie wasn't there, to the point of mentioning the specific night before Linden does. Jackson tells Linden the casino's security tapes are deleted every 24 hours. When Linden suggests that she needs to talk to some of the guests, Jackson is no longer cooperative and tells her that short of a federal warrant she is not welcome on tribal property.

Outside Linden calls an assistant district attorney and is told it would take at least a week to get onto Native American property. The then requests a warrant for the ATMs that are placed around the casino, as they are owned by the bank, not the tribe.

Holder pulls up and she tells him of her plan to catch Rosie on one of the ATM cameras. Rosie took the last ferry of the day that night, so she couldn't have returned via boat until the next day. Linden mentions that Jackson heads the Kalimish tribe, which owns all of the property. She thinks the bank warrant could take 24 hours, perhaps less. Holder seems unhappy about having to wait.

Linden leaves with her phone, while Holder places a call from inside his phone. He's calling his sister and nephews. He references an upcoming parade where he's going to meet them and talks about a gift he has for the one nephew.

Linden returns to the car, having got word that Jack didn't show up for school that morning and has skipped the last three days.

Linden dials Jack's cell from the motel room hall and hears it ring inside their room. But inside she finds only his phone.

Holder ended up waiting for Linden outside the motel and offers to give her a ride to the marina. On the way she leaves a message for Regi. Jack's phone is password-protected. Linden tells Holder that Regi is a woman. He assumes Regi is Linden's mother and starts talking about his family. Linden leaves a message at the home of Jack's best friend.

Regi's boat is gone -- she's away for a week visiting friends. The mother of Jack's friend calls back and references a place called The Tunnel by the waterfront. The woman doesn't want her son hanging around with Jack, who she thinks is a bad influence. Holder says he knows The Tunnel, a middle school skip hangout.

In the car Holder talks about running away during his youth and compares it to how Linden is handling her relationship with Rick. They find a bunch of kids at The Tunnel, but Jack is not there. Linden references a balloon in the backseat of Holder's car and he says he has a date.

Linden and Holder are showing Jack's picture around in various parts of town. Jack is supposed to call by 3:15 pm, so during the wait Linden and Holder grab some food. Holder talks about getting addicted to meth while working undercover. A former lieutenant helped him to get clean.

Holder manages to guess Jack's password and unlock his cell phone. She finds texts from somebody who is meeting up with Jack near his school. The number is restricted. One of them was sent that morning.

The phone company won't unblock the number for Linden. She is now bumming smokes from Holder. They haven't been able to reach any of Jack's friends. Linden leaves the car and calls in a formal APB, giving Jack's description.

They return to the motel at 3:30 pm, the time Jack is supposed to return each day. Linden is devastated to find the room empty. She goes back to the car and says she wants to stay. Holder leaves the car and calls his sister, saying he won't be attending the event after all. He says he has a friend who is in need and assures her this isn't like the other times he hasn't shown up. Back inside the car Linden thanks Holder for ""being my ride.""

At 5:00 pm Jack still hasn't returned to the motel. They go to where Linden used to live and she discusses her background in foster care. Linden thinks this is the reason why she is having trouble being a mother. He tells her about Jack calling him for hot dog cooking advice and this leads to a fight. She gets out of the car and Holder has to beg her to get back in.

Later in the evening they pull up to a playground that holds a special place in Linden's heart. She tells Holder about spending time there with him, back when Jack used to be happy. On the radio they hear a report that a child fitting Jack's description almost exactly has been found dead. Linden demands they go to the scene.

Holder tries to stop Linden from running to the covered body. Before she gets there we hear the radio confirming that the dead child is not Jack. She breaks down.

They return to the motel and see Jack is there at the end of the hallway. Holder tells her to ""kick his ass."" Linden first gives him a hug.

Outside in the car Holder gets a call that the ATM footage is on its way to their office.

Inside the motel room Jack tells Linden: ""I was with dad.""

Holder views the tapes and spots a clear image of Rosie in front of an ATM inside the casino."

In the office Holder has uncovered numerous pictures of Rosie at the casino, including one from the night of her murder where she's wearing the pink sweater. She's been making somewhat large deposits into an account under some else's name that had swelled to $7,000.

We see Jackson giving a press conference the next morning where she states construction workers found a human skull.

Cut to Adams' top aid having trouble getting the governor on the phone. Adams tells him he's wasting his breath, pointing out the tribe finding a bone basically means the end of the project on which his entire campaign was based.

By contrast Richmond's campaign couldn't be going better. The governor is coming for lunch and he's about to meet with the Seattle Record. A decision is made to send Jamie to a last-minute party Drexler has put together for Richmond. Senator Eaton calls to congratulate Richmond.

While Mitch is searching the office she hears a voicemail from Yanek where he references seeing Stan. She asks Royce about it and ends up firing him when she doesn't like his answer.

Stan leaves Mitch a voicemail asking about the boys and mentions he has a meeting with a psychiatrist to determine if he's safe to release on bond.

Rosie's bank account was under Terry's name. She initially tells Linden and Holder she knows nothing about it, she eventually fesses up that she let Rosie borrow her ID so she could get into a few clubs. Terry says she has no idea what Rosie was up to.

Adams meets with Gwen to give him an envelope somebody ""slipped under my door."" It's some kind of dirt on Richmond that he wants her to have out of respect for her father.

Holder takes Linden to meet an old undercover partner of his who had worked as a prostitute in the casino. She says the picture of Rosie looks like girls from the Beau Soleil online ""social introduction service,"" primarily used by rich men. Last summer one of the girls got roughed-up.

Jamie shows up at Drexler's house. There are young girls in bikinis swimming in the pool. Drexler says they are Beau Soleil girls. He says he didn't give Richmond all that money just because he made a basket.

Mitch visits Stan at the jail. She confronts him about their savings being gone and the call from Yanek. She yells at him, thinking he's returned to his old ways. Eventually Stan cuts her off and points out that the only reason he's there is because she pushed him to take care of things.

Holder finds the description of the John who roughed up the Beau Soleil girl. It sounds just like Drexler, who has two priors for solicitation. Linden says they need more to bring him in.

Jack's father' is waiting for Linden in her office. He apologizes for being out of Jack's life for the past decade but says he has a new family and wants Jack to be a part of it. He is heading home in a few days and wants to see Jack one more time. Linden doesn't seem interested.

One of the department's IT guys is able to find that somebody accessed the Beau Soleil website a number of times. One of the photos has a man wearing Rosie's expensive shoes, but the jacket clearly belongs to Terry.

Terry tells Linden and Holder it was just ""a way to meet nice men"" and admits to giving the shoes to Rosie. She tells them she recalls reading on the site's message board a recent warning from someone named Celine to avoid a John named Orpheus because he had driven her to the water and asked her if she wondered what it was like to drown.

Richmond meets with the Seattle Record. They grill him with a number of contentious questions, but Richmond ends up giving them a quality answer about how important his deceased wife has been in his campaign.

Stan tells the psychiatrist about a dream where his family was sitting around the table but another guy was sitting at the head table. It didn't make him feel anything and he doesn't say who the new guy is.

Linden and Holder track the Beau Soleil site to the warehouse of an online sneaker company. They guy claims he was hosting the site for a friend and takes them to the server. He pulls up the warning about Orpheus, whom she calls a ""Sick John."" The girls real name was Aleena, but Orpheus disconnected his account the night Rosie died. They do have the email that was connected to the account.

Terry and Mitch end up getting into a heated argument about Rosie and how protective Mitch was with her.

Linden sends a blank email to the Orpheus account. The subject reads ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID."" She gets a call from Holder, who is waiting on a ""date"" with Aleena. Linden notices that Drexler is big donor of Richmond's.

Aleena shows up. Holder tells him he's a cop and pulls out pictures of Rosie. She says Orpheus seemed like a sweet guy at first. She's clearly scared to talk, and doesn't admit anything with Holder asks whether it was Drexler.

Stan makes bail. In the parking lot he sees Terry waiting for him.

Still waiting on a response from Orpheus, Linden calls the IT guy Ray and asks him to wait at her desk.

We see that Gwen has opened the envelope from Adams.

Aleena calls Holder from a pay phone and says ""you don't know what you're getting yourself into."" She tells him if he wants to know who Orpheus is to come to a specific intersection.

Linden pays a visit to Richmond. She starts to ask him about Drexler and he has to leave the room to take a call. Ray calls to say that while Orpheus hasn't responded, he's opened her email. She tells him to re-send the email, and at that exact moment she hears a computer notification sound from a nearby room. She tells him to send the message again, and again hears the noise. She walks into Richmond's office and sees a computer screen open to an email account with her ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID"" emails in the inbox.

Aleena has left the scene, but at the intersection she mentioned Holder fins a wall filled with campaign posters of Richmond.

Linden thinks Richmond switched to the traceable campaign car that night because the tinted windows provide anonymity. Linden notices the gas tank is nearly full.

Terry drops off Stan at home. He's not excited about seeing Mitch. He thanks her for bailing him out and she leaves. Stan makes eye contact with Mitch in the window, then gets in a car and leaves without ever going inside.

Linden found out the tank was half-full when Richmond grabbed I that night. This means at some point Richmond purchased gas and could end up giving them evidence.

Stan sleeps in his car at the cemetery.

We see Mitch going through an old scrapbook. Her father comes in and tells her Rosie asked for it.

Holder is confused that the odometer tells them Richmond put 120 miles on the car that night. It means that he couldn't have taken the ferry to the casino and must have taken the long route to the casino, over the Desolation Bridge. The bridge has a tollbooth and they plan to request the camera records.

During a public appearance Richmond is asked about a recent report exposing past affairs. He dismisses the report as bogus. Gwen wakes up and he says that he was hurting after his wife died but that he stopped all that stuff once they got together: ""Look at me,"" he says. ""You know I'm telling you the truth.""

Oakes tells Linden to be careful with how she goes after Richmond. Jack is spending time with his father. Holder stops by and tells Linden about the affairs, pointing out they all resemble Rosie in appearance.

Linden and Holder meet with one of the women Richmond supposedly had an affair with, a former campaign advisor named Meg. She thinks Richmond is a good man with deep-seated sadness. She said she left him because it ""hurt too much to stay.""

Stan stops by to see Ahmed in the hospital. Ahmed is still unconscious. On his way out he runs into Amber at the soda machine. She doesn't realize who he is and begins sobbing. He assures that a baby is the best thing that happens to your life. She asks how many kids he has and he says ""three."" She says she bets he's a great dad and he walks away.

Mitch watches Terry and the boys flying kites from a distance. She walks away.

Linden and Holder are having no luck with gas stations along Richmond's probable route. They are also still waiting to hear back from the tollbooth about the security footage. Holder figures out based on the gas mileage math that just south of the bridge he would have been on fumes. There is a gas station close to Battery Park where he could have stopped.

Gwen comes to the office and finds Meg waiting for her. She's there to see Richmond. Meg tells Gwen about being questioned by Linden. Meg implies that her relationship with Richmond overlapped his relationship with Gwen.

A guy at the station tells Linden and Holder that the night of Rosie's death he remembers a dark car leaving quickly after paying. He thinks the reason what that there was a girl screaming. Linden goes behind the station and stares out at the woods. Holder comes out and says they are just three mile from Battery Park. They speculate Rosie must have run the three miles, which explains her cut foot. Linden thinks the chase could have taken all night: ""He hunted her.""

Jamie tells Gwen he didn't know anything about the affairs that have now made in the papers. Jamie calls Richmond ""complicated."" It doesn't sound like the recent revelation about Meg will keep her from working.

Terry tells Belko not to leave. She doesn't think Mitch meant what she said and that the family needs him.

Jamie and Richmond share a glass of scotch. Jamie thinks tonight's rally is ""just icing."" Jamie asks Richmond if he has any additional skeletons ""Relax, you've got nothing to worry about,"" Richmond says.

Linden tells Holder to bring out the K-9 units to search the wooded area where Rosie was likely hunted.

Stan goes to the house he had secretly purchased for the family. He stares at the swing set.

Later that night one of Rosie's shoes is found. Linden starts getting emotional as she realizes that if Rosie had run in a slightly different direction she would have lived.

Linden goes to see Richmond. She begins shouting allegations about how he killed Rosie and he starts yelling back. He tells her ""I did nothing"" and says ""look at me, you know I'm telling the truth."" We see that Gwen is in a nearby room and heard this conversation.

Linden runs into Gwen outside. She tells Linden that on the night in question Richmond told her he ""needed to get away"" for a night. Richmond didn't return until dawn and when he did he was soaking wet. She hands Linden a disc.

While Richmond conducts his rally, Linden tells Oakes what she knows so far. Oakes still isn't sure they have enough to arrest him. Holder walks in with the evidence they need: Security camera footage from 3am caught Richmond in the campaign car crossing the bridge.

Cut to the police showing up at the rally. Richmond beats a hasty retreat but is placed under arrest by Linden. Surrounded by flag-waving supporters Richmond is placed in cuffs.

Linden tells Holder she thinks he'll be able to handle the paperwork to finish up the case. They both smile and Holder tells her to ""get out of here.""

Mitch tells Stan she doesn't think she's good for the boys in her current state. She doesn't think they need her. ""But I do,"" Stan replies. He tells her their life has been better than he could have hoped for. Mitch says ""Every piece of this place hurts me."" She cries and he consoles her.

Belko watches the news report that Richmond has been arrested for Rosie's murder. He is cleaning his gun.

Linden walks out of the office as the camera focuses on a photo of Rosie.

Linden brings Jack to the airport. He wants to make sure they don't forget about his father but seems okay with them leaving town.

Terry asks Stan if he's heard the news. She asks where Mitch is. Stan says ""She left.""

Sitting on the airplane Linden gets a call from highway patrol. They tell her they will be unable to fill her request for camera footage from the tollbooth. When Linden tells the woman they already have the photos she tells her that the cameras on the bridge haven't worked for a month.

We see Holder getting into a car with an unknown driver. He says: ""Photo worked. He's going down.""

Linden is sitting on the plane, clearly disturbed by this latest development.

Richmond is escorted to a police vehicle. We see that Belko is watching from the crowd. Belko walks towards him with the gun drawn. He points the gun at Richmond from point blank range as the season comes to an end."

Daniel Boone (Fess Parker) must capture his friend Mingo and bring him to justice before all Kentucky erupts in war. Daniel's friend Yadkin (Albert Salmi) is a friend to all in Booneborough and among the Cherokee. Yadkin had canoed up river and while meeting with a Cherokee trading party when they were ambushed by a Creek war party. Yadkin was found floating down river by Daniel's son Israel (Darby Hinton). With Cincinnatus (Dal McKennon) removing the slug (bullet) and Rebecca Boone (Patricia Blair) nursing him, he began to pull through. After he recovered enough, Yadkin identified Mingo as the leader of the Creek warriors and as the very man who shot him. To keep Mose (Adam Williams) and the rest of the men of Boonesborough from going out and starting a shooting war with Mingo's tribe, the Cherokee, Daniel sets out promising to bring Mingo back. Mingo finally allows man-hunting Daniel to enter his camp were he tells Daniel of his successful several weeks raiding the Shawnee. When Daniel brings Mingo before Yadkin to face the charges, Mingo becomes unusually silent when Yadkin states that ""it was either Mingo or his ghost"". Mingo's silence is deafening to all and taken as a sign of guilt except by Daniel and Yadkin. Mingo flees and Daniel is forced to set out to recapture him. Yadkin tells the people of Boonesborough that it is a matter between Mingo and Daniel-and to stay out of it. While Daniel is on Mingo's trail, he finds a small Cherokee village that was just attacked and still burning. 3 were killed including a child. Again, Mingo is identified as leading the attacking Creek war party. They left an old defenseless woman as the sole survivor. To the Cherokee she reported; the attack, Mingo leading them, and Daniel being there shortly after the attack. Daniel is captured and taken before the Cherokee Council of Chief's. Led by Chief Matawa(Ford Rainey), the Council orders Daniel and Mingo sentenced to death for the attack on the village. Daniel convinces the Council of his innocence and that he too seeks Mingo's capture. After his release Daniel soon finds Mingo, but he is badly wounded. Mingo finally reveals to Daniel his painful family secret. Mingo has a twin brother named Taramingo (Ed Ames in a dual role). When he catches up to Taramingo, Mingo cannot shoot his brother again. Mingo is overpowered by Taramingo's Creek warriors and left for dead. Apparently, there was a blood feud between Mingo and Taramingo. The feud was thought to be finished when Mingo was forced to shoot and kill Taramingo 3 years earlier. However, Taramingo's hatred for Mingo had kept him alive while Mingo, thinking him dead, buried him. Now, Taramingo has returned not just to seek Mingo's death, but worse, the anhililation of his personal honor and character. Since Mingo cannot go on, Daniel picks up the chase of Taramingo. The ensuing climatic battle is ended with a repeat of history. Not recent history, but 3 years old. Mingo is his brother's keeper, but Taramingo's hatred forces the final confrontation on a high cliff."

Trick or Treat (Pilot) (#1.0)

Gideon Hackles (Barnard Hughes) is a miser, the wealthiest person in the valley. He's a cruel old man whose favourite season of the year is Halloween. He's been lending money to the inhabitants of the valley for 67 years, since he earned his first penny when he was much younger. He always wants to colect money, and never spend it. For example, he even makes his guests pay for the coffees. He shows them all the IOU he has been collecting through the years.

Hackles loves Halloween so much, that he offers an opportunity to get rid of their debts to those indebted to him who have young children: every year, children can go trick or treating to his home, enter it and look for the yellowy IOU's of their parents. If a child is so corageous as to get the IOU, the father of that child will be released from their dues as soon as they destroy the papers. Only children can get into Hackles' home, decorated accordingly. He hides the IOU's, but any intelligent person who doesn't fall for Hackles' tricks can find them.

That night, the first child is Bessie (Eevin Hartsough). Mr Hackles hides in a room from where he can watch he tries to enter his home, control all the dummies and elements he's created to scare the children away, and even open and close the front door of his home at his will. Bessie enters the home, while her mother (Nancy Ellen Sutherland) waits outside, twisting her hands in agony. There is an owl inside, and mannequins with distorted faces, and Bessies leaves the home terrified. Her mother hugs her and they leave, while Mr Hackles looks at them smiling.

Timothy ""Timmy"" Muldoon (Patrick Wilcox) is the second child. His father, Victor, (Eddie Jones) has been teaching him that ""spirits do not exist"" so that young Timmy can enter the home and find the IOU's. Timmy is scared inside, because of the noises, open windows, the owl and the crow, but when he is about to leave through the front door he thinks about it again, slams the door shut and repeating the mantra ""spirits don't exist"", enters the home again. He finds some of the IOU's hidden in a hole in the wall on one of the rooms, but Mr Hackles shows him the huge face of a monster, and Timmy can't resist it anymore, and he leaves in panick. His father hugs him as well, sensing that his son has been really close to getting it.

There are two more children (Jessica Rene Carroll & Joshoua Miller) who try to get the pieces of paper, and then there is another boy, the child of a farmer, Atticus Kimble (Joe Ponazecki) whose first year has been terrible because of the bad harvest. He's used his farm as colateral, so unless he pays his debts with Hackles, he will lose his farm. However, this father is more sensible. He rejects to let his son Billy (Knowl Johnson) try to get his IOU's, as he things that Hackles wouldn't offer a way of redeeming the debts so easily. However, the son really wants to try. Hackles says that he never lies, and points to the Muldoon father as an example of a father who forces his child to get into the Halloween game of Hackles.

Another person appears at Hackles' front door. He doesn't want to open the door, as the opportunity is only for children, not for adults. This adult is dressed up really convincingly as a Witch (Frances Chaney). However, when Mr Hackles goes to shoo her away, the witch ignores him and levitates. He gets scared and tries to hide within his home, but the devil (Ed French) traps him in hell.

Atticus and Sarah (Brenda Currin) agree not to let Billy go to the Hackles home. Notwithstanding that, Billy leaves in the night and goes to the Hackles', dressed in his farmer everyday clothes. When he arrives, he tries to be courageous.

This time things go different: it's the witch who opens up the door. Billy doesn't even have to enter the home.

He's been quite successful after recovering from his alcoholism. When his colleague Brad (Jon Jacobs) offers him a drink, he just says no, and his colleague drinks both glasses of staff. Jerry (Chris Hebert) appears and asks Brad whether Al Coombs is here. When Jerry talks to Al, he calls him ""dad"". Al takes Jerry to the police station as he hasn't seen him ever before.

Back home, Sharon Coombs (Kelly Jean Peters) is preparing dinners and talking to her eldest son Petey (Billy Jacoby-Jayne). The police call on her, as they've got her son Jerry there. Al is frustrated when Sharon starts telling him how he could have done that to his kid. Jerry talks about the colleague who smelled like having drunk alcohol. Al remembers Petey, but not Jerry. Sharon threatens Al when both of their children have gone to their rooms to sleep. Al can't remember Jerry at all, and Sharon tells him that she's not going to put up with his alcoholic behaviour again, that she will leave him for good with the children. That night, Al goes to present his excuses to Petey, but it's Jerry in his room.

The following morning, at the breakfast table, only Sharon and Jerry are present. Petey had asked his mother to spend the night at a friend's, and that's why he isn't there. Al asks Jerry when his birthday is, and where he was given birth (at a local hospital nearby). When Alan goes to the office, as usual, he's got an unkempt look to him. He's a bit late, but his colleague tells him that Alan went home two days ago, and that his successful business has been cancelled as the lady who wanted to buy the property liked Al best. .

Sharon phones Al in his office, to say that she's leaving him as she can't put with all that misery again. Al knows that he's lost his job... again. He goes home and finds it empty. He has a vision of Sharon and Jerry talking about how Al betrayed them because of his alcoholism. After the vision, Al starts tearing the place to pieces. He finds a bottle of whiskey and finally drinks it up. The following morning, he is in a terrible bad shape on a dirty bed in an empty room.

Later, another day, Brad offers a drink to the most successful realty seller of the office, but the new worker, Roger Johnson (Paul Jenkins) refuses it. So Brad drinks both drinks again.

When Brad is leaving, Jerry enters again, and asks to talk to his father, Roger Johnson. Roger can't recognise Jerry as his son as well."

Petrie) and Duncan Williams (Keenan Wynn) are business associates who have been working together for many many years, in businesses which are not completely clean, for example prostitution and drugs. They are celebrating in their limo when one of them offers to buy the other's soul in exchange of a million dollars. They are playing billiards and Jack is losing a lot of money, so Duncan offers Jack a million dollars in exchange for the rights to their eternal soul. Jack laughs it off, as he doesn't believe in the soul. He has reminiscences concerning his childhood at Sunday school. Duncan says that he's being a chicken, so Jack says he'd sell it. Only Richards (Michael Freeman), the butler, is witness of the proposition.

The following day Jack is not feeling too well, but he goes to Duncan's mansion to sign the contract and sell his sould for that said million dollars. Duncan only wants to have some security that Jack won't kill him. They sign the contract. Soon afterwards after having singed the contract and cashed on the check, Jack discovers that he's so ill that he's got only one or two months left. He offers Duncan to give him back his million dollars and to give him a further million dollars if he breaks the contract. Duncan laughs, as this is the easiest million dollars he has ever earned.

However, soon afterwards Jenny (Catherine Battistone) phones Duncan to tell him that Jack's dead. Duncan's sorry that his plot to get a million dollars has not worked well. Duncan dismisses Richards, and that night he's alone at his mansion.

That night it's stormy, and pit black. Jack visits him - already dead -, to give him his soul. Jack begs Duncan to accept his soul and fulfil the contract. Duncan rejects it, terrified.

Suddenly the devil appears (Bradley ""Brad"" Fisher), before Duncan can collect Jack's soul. The contract said that if Duncan died before he could collect Jack's soul, the contract would be void and null. Duncan has a heart attack right there, so the devil picks both souls up: Jack's, and Duncan's.

The devil thens burns something into Duncan's chest and then leaves. Duncan lies dead on the bed with the words PAID IN FULL branded on his chest."

Vale tells Horace to turn it off, and that he doesn't trust electronics and has only calculated the odds for 31 years with a pencil and his brain.

A cold breeze blows through the bar, even though the fan isn't on. A tall man in a white suit and hat appears, seemingly out of nowhere. The man sits down at Tommy's table, reaches into his pocket paper, and tells Tommy that he wants to bet $500 on Ryan's Daughter to win the first race at Belmont. Tommy tells the man he's crazy because the horse is forty to one, but the man insists and puts five noncirculated $100 nickels on the table in front Tommy.

Tommy refuses the bet, saying the race has already begun. However, when the bartender turns on the radio, the announcer says that the race was delayed and the man pushes the nickels over to Tommy. They listen to the race, and Ryan's Daughter eventually wins. Tommy tells him he'll have his $20,000 the following morning.

The man in white says he wants to bet on the Orioles. Horace warns Tommy that he doesn't have time to lay off the bet, but Tommy says that he's never refused a bet and takes the $20,000.

The next day, bets come in on the Oriole, and Tommy tells Horace to show him how the calculator on his day planner works. The bets continue to come in and the Orioles win, Tommy insists on principle on paying them of. The initial better comes in and Tommy figures that he' selling his hunches. Then he asks Horace if he knows the better, and Horace says that he looks familiar.

The better asks Horace if he knows Bill Lacey, and says that the man is Lacey's son. Lacey collects his winnings, and says that he wants to bet it on a boxer, Ramirez. The bookie accepts the bet, although he cuts the odds in half and puts Lacey on rolling odds if he calls his hunches around. Tommy says that he has to make a call, and Lacey bets him an extra dime so the bookie can make the call on the nearby phone call. Tommy goes to make the call, and Lacey tells Horace that his father is dead, and Tommy is the one who should be dead.

Tommy comes back and says that Lacey's father got in over his head, and killed himself when he couldn't pay up on his own bad bets. Lacey says that Tommy should have given his father credit, then leaves.

The next day, Lacey comes to collect his winnings when Ramirez pays off. Lacey wants to make a new bet, and Tommy agrees as long as he gets to name the odds. The better agrees and says that he'll bet even money that Tommy is dead at 8 am the next morning, of natural causes. Tommy agrees and says that they'll sit it out in the bar until 8 am.

That night, Lacey and his bodyguard, a silent man in a cheap suit, come in. Tommy and Horace are there, along with a mobster who is protecting Tommy's money. At one point, Tommy dozes off and the mobster nervously shakes him to make sure Tommy is still alive.

At five minutes to 8 by Horace's planner alarm, Tommy says that he knew Lacey was the ghost of his father from the moment he walked in, and Lacey was using inside information from beyond the grave to win his bets. He tells Lacey that he's a loser and always was, and should never underestimate the power of the human spirit because Lacey is going to choke the big stuff when Tommy doesn't die. Lacey says that he lost everything, and Tommy tells him that he's going to lose it all again.

Eight am arrives, per Horace's alarm and the clock on the wall. The mobster grabs all the money and quickly runs out. Lacey goes with his silent escort, and the two of them fade into nothing. Tommy asks Horace for a pencil and paper so he can make out his last will, and admits that he set the clock and Horace's timer behind five minutes. It was an old trick, but Lacey fell for it. Tommy laughs at the trick he played, leaves plenty for Horace, and dies of a heart attack as 8 am comes."

Both parents and the twin siblings. They are playing scrubble, but one of them, the teenaged Kevin ""Mookie"" (Ron Asher) is playing from the interphone, sending the instructions. His sister Susan ""Pookie"" (Justine Bateman) goes upstairs to talk to him when Mookie asks him to. Mookie has been ill for some time, so he has found himself bed-bound, and has become obsessed with computers. Mookie asks Pookie to promise him that, in case he dies, she will keep on with his work with computers. Even though she doesn't know anything about computers, she finally agrees and promises. She goes downstairs to keep on playing Scrubble. However, at that moment, through the radiophone they can hear Mookie having problems. When they go upstairs, Mookie is dead.

Some time has gone by. Pookie has lived up to her promise and she is working on the computer following late Mookie's instructions. Ruth Anderson (Tippi Hedren) is the mother of Mookie and Pookie. She tells Pookie that she can attend the party she had been forbidden to attend before, so that the teenaged girl may distract herself with friends. However, now Pookie is completely uninterested. One day, the Delivery Man (Neil Kinsella) takes a huge package to the Anderson's. When Ruth has brought it to the old Mookie's room, Pookie opens it up and finds it is a voice synthetizer. However, she hasn't ordered anything, and thinks it must have been Mookie.

The father, Charles Anderson (George Sims) is worried about Pookie's obsession. Pookie tells him that Mookie is living within the net computer, and that she can contact him. Charles tries to sell all the computer equipment, and has even going to cash a cheque. However, Mookie has come to know his plans because banks and digital transactions always appear on the net. Pookie gets frantic and says to his dad that she will prove that Mookie is inside the net. However, when they type questions to communicate with him, Mookie doesn't answer. So the father insists on getting rid of all the computer equipment, while the mother feels in-between and tries to appease both the father and the daughter, asking for more time. When Pookie types in the question of ""Why didn't you answer them?"", Mookie just says that their father isn't ready yet.

The father is really fed up about the situation. He is going to get rid of the computer. The first step is to unplug it. Just when he is about to do it, the computer talks with the synthetized voice of Kevin/Mookie.

The last scene consists of the three Andersons playing Scrubble again. Charles is losing, - as usual - and the computer with Mookie's voice and sense of humour wins. They are all happy again."
