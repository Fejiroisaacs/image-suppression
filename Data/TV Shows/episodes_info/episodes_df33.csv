A flight from Berlin comes in for landing in New York. One flight attendant urgently calls another to the back. On her way, she checks on an arrogant rock star, Gabriel Bolivar; a French girl, Emma; and an annoyed woman, Joan Luss. In the back, a freaked out coworker tells her there's something alive in the cargo hold. He heard a thumping, even though there are no animals on the manifest. They get down on their hands and knees and open the hold, but see nothing. But with it closed again, something thumps violently until it breaks through. We catch a glimpse of a monster as it comes at them.

In the air traffic control tower, they notice the flight has simply stopped on the runway. Bishop, the guy in charge, goes to inspect. The plane is off, quiet and dark, with its door closed. The plane feels cold. The windows shades are all shut.

Police pull up and they call for reinforcements.

20:35, Astoria, Queens

Dr. Ephraim ""Eph"" Goodweather struggles to put on his tie and make it to a court-appointed therapy session. He greets his waiting young son, Zach, inside. Eph tries to put a positive spin on the fact he's late, his estranged wife, Kelly, tries not to be annoyed. He ignores his buzzing cell phone as he recaps all the things he's done, per her wishes, to fix their marriage. But she says he's just not ""present"" and she's moving in with Matt, a dude who works at Sears.

Eph struggles to make his case as his wife kindly, politely, tells him she's leaving him. Both of his phones won't stop ringing, and finally he leaves to take the call about the plane.

21:15 at the airport Eph greets his colleagues Jim Kent and Nora Martinez at the scene, where the FBI is ready to take control of the plane. Eph goes into a speech that Jim and Nora have clearly heard before about how deadly a virus can be and how quickly it can spread, including to whoever walks onto that plane if it's infected. The FBI backs down.

Harlem 21:28 Two heavily tattooed, desperate-looking men walk into Abraham Setrakian's pawn shop hoping to sell a watch for silver, which they've heard he buys. When Setrakian leans over to inspect the watch, the thief, Chris, tries to grab a wad of cash from under the plexiglass. He's stunned when the old man grabs his wrist and presses a knife into it, giving a menacing lecture about how quickly he could kill the thief by opening a vein before the other gets a shot off. The two run scared, leaving their gun as ordered.

Abraham sees news of the flight on TV and takes note it's coming from Berlin.

Setrakian goes through a hidden door and down into his workshop, where he takes out an ornate silver sword-cum-walking stick with a wolf's head grip. He sits down and talks to a deformed heart in a jar. ""He's back. I don't know whether I have the strength to do it all over again. This time, I cannot fail,"" he says. The heart twitches. ""Feeling hungry?"" Setrakian asks it.

He opens the jar and takes out a small knife, using it to slice his finger. When he drops the blood into the heart jar, small tentacles come out from everywhere and attack the blood droplets as if they were miniature piranhas. ""Enjoy, dear,"" Setrakian says, almost lovingly.

Eph and Nora suit up to board the plane. He tells her about his court-ordered therapy and the situation with Kelly. Nora references their own relationship during the year he and Kelly were separated, which Eph never told Kelly about.

Jim waits outside with Eph's milk as Eph and Nora board the plane in full protective gear.

Everyone on the plane is dead.

There are no signs of struggle, no markings. Eph concludes it was sudden and painless. All the plane's windows are closed except one. They find evidence of ammonia.

Eph kneels down next to the young French girl, Emma, frozen dead in place in her seat. He reports his findings back, including that her tongue is pale and there's no frothing or blood.

When they use their UV flashlights, there are splashes of something all over the plane.

They split up to search, Eph takes the rear of the plane.

Zoom in on a dead passenger's hand. It twitches.

Around the back cargo hold the UV light shows smears of something everywhere.

Nora finds the cockpit door is opened. Jim urgently tells her it should be locked and that she should get out, but she wants to take a look.

She's peering into the captain's mouth when he moves. She wheels around and the arrogant rocker, Gabriel Bolivar, is standing behind her. So is Joan Luss. Eph radios for paramedics. There are survivors.

Stoneheart Group, Manhattan, 22:00

Thomas Eichhorst rides the elevator. Something is not right about his eyes. He goes to visit Eldritch Palmer. Reginald Fitzwilliam, an employee Palmer raised from a child, is a administering his dialysis, although he is head of security. Fitzwilliam leaves them alone. Palmer knows what Eichhorst is and a reference is made to the fact he cannot feel cold. ""The cargo has arrived safely, and all four survivors have been found,"" Eichhorst says.

Despite the frigid temperature in the room, Eichhorst's breath is not visible. He admits he misses breathing sometimes.

JFK, 22:05 The CDC boss, Everett, joins them. Eph is keeping the four survivors under quarantine, but Everett is worried about PR and wants Eph to talk to the families, even though they have nothing to tell them.

In quarantine, Nora tries to talk to Joan Luss, a high powered attorney who isn't very cooperative.

Nora and Eph talk to Captain Redfern, who doesn't remember anything after landing.

Another survivor, the nerd, Barber, complains of a noise in his head.

The rock star, Bolivar, is primarily concerned with scoring drugs. Eph isn't sure how much of the goth rocker look to buy. Boliver takes off his long wig and confesses he's just in it for the girls.

Jim calls Eph to look at something in the container hold. There's a giant, nine foot tall, hand carved box that wasn't on the manifest.

Eph opens it -- it's full of soil. Bishop is positive it couldn't get past security in Berlin, but that doesn't explain how it got there. Nora notices the box has a latch -- on the inside.

At home, Kelly, Zach and Matt watch a news report about the plane. Zach is confident his dad will handle it. He texts him to make sure he's OK.

Eph texts back that he loves him and will call tomorrow.

Nora gives Eph a pep talk before he goes to talk to the families.

Bishop is on the phone speaking angry German to someone in Berlin about the box when he hears a noise and faint voice that no one else seems to hear. He wanders around the cargo storage area where the box is being kept, heading to the darkest, creepiest part.

He finds a puddle that could be blood and a pulsing something under a cloak. Then the nine foot tall thing rears up, and extends a tentacle from its face area into Bishop's neck. A hollow tooth jabs into Bishop's neck and sucks his blood, holding him in place with a claw hand. Then it snaps his neck, throws him to the ground and smashes his head into pulp before it slithers briskly away.

Harlem, 23:15

Eichhorst visits a Latino gangbanger, Gus Elizalde, in Spanish Harlem, giving him a wad of cash as arranged and telling him to pick up the van from the airport with the case and deliver it to Stoneheart. Eichhorst explains this time is special, and reveals files on Gus's mother and his brother, Chris, the thief who tried to rob Abraham Setrakian.

Gus doesn't want to do it, but Eichhorst tells him his mother's immigration status will be fixed and his brother's criminal record expunged. Eichhorst gives him three rules: don't examine the cargo, don't make any stops and make it back to Manhattan by daybreak.

JFK, 23:30

Abraham Setrakian arrives at the airport to find goth punk fans chanting for Gabriel Bolivar. He easily walks through security, then fakes a heart issue to get close enough to talk to Jim Kent about the plane.

Everett sends Eph in front of the cameras and families for a briefing, which is swarming with media, even though Everett promised no press.

Kelly watches the briefing online. Eph breaks the bad news that 206 people died, four lived and they have no idea why. He promises to get to the bottom of things, but he's interrupted when the distraught father of the young girl, Emma, slaps him. He promises answers in 48 hours.

Office of the chief Medical Examiner, 23:40

Eph and Nora video chat with the ME, who shows them a clean incision on the front of a woman's neck. It punctured the carotid artery without damaging the area, which no medical instrument could do with such precision. He found the same mark in the same place on the six other corpses he's checked so far.

He takes out a scalpel and slices into a victim's wrist, which oozes white goo. The ME will know more after an exam.

Jim introduces Eph to Abraham Setrakian. Eph is inclined to dismiss the old man, who says he's seen the disease before and they have to contain it. Abraham doubts they can, which is exactly what ""he,"" wants.

To prove he knows what he's talking about, Abraham mentions the bodies are not decomposing normally. He tells them to sever the heads and burn the bodies. They notice his cane/sword. Abraham is being taken away by security when he asks if they still have the coffin and tells them to destroy it before it crosses the river.

Office of the ME, 3:05 The ME begins his exam alone, to keep the press away. He looks at the body under UV light and notices a strange pattern on the skin.

Back in the plane's cargo hold, Eph and Nora find one of the tiny tentacles, still writhing and looking for food. Nora notices a clump of soil nearby with more in it.

They go looking for the coffin, but it's gone.

They go over the security footage, which seems to show the coffin disappearing. They slow it down and see a black blur seem to lift the coffin off the ground. The footage is only seven minutes old.

JFK security garage, 4:40 Gus puts on his fake ID and gets in the van he's supposed to drive. The coffin is in back. He drives off.

Eph calls Jim, telling him to seal off the airport, and keep all cars in, especially vans.

The police direct Gus to pull over. A dog sniffing the car starts barking. Gus is about to pull a gun, when Jim walks over. The cop shows Jim the Stoneheart business card Gus flashed, and Jim recognizes it. He tells the cops Gus is with the CDC. Before letting him go, Jim whispers to Gus: ""You tell those sons of bitches, I'm done. I came through for them, but now I am done.""

The ME continues his exam of the plane victims and removes a heart with growths on it that he describes as like new organs. He listens to Neil Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline.""

He hears a crash and goes to investigate, when he returns the heart he was weighing is writhing in the pan and tentacles are oozing out of it like worms. He watches in horror as one works its way into his palm. He grabs tweezers and is relieved when he's able to remove it, but his relief doesn't last long. All of the bodies he's just been dissecting are now on their feet, even the ones that are cut open. They approach him hungrily, then attack. (""Hands, touching haaaannds/Touching me, touching you!"")

Back at the airport, Jim reports to Eph that the coffin is nowhere to be found.

Abraham Setrakian is put into a holding facility in Queens at 4:05. His name's Armenian. He has a Holocaust prisoner tattoo on his arm.

At Stoneheart, Eichhort reports to Palmer that everything went well. Palmer knows about the old man at the airport, whom Eichhort recognizes as ""the Jew,"" marveling that he's still at it.

Palmer alerts Fitzwilliam that he wants to walk the streets one last time, before ""the fall.""

4:55 Gus drives back into the city, calling his mom. At her place, his brother Chris is complaining there's only one beer.

Gus crosses the bridge.

A voice over tells us that love is the one thing stronger than hunger.

Queens, 5:29 Emma's father returns home to his dark house. He hears a tap on the window and sees Emma standing there. She walks in, announcing that she's cold.

She's also green, but he's just glad to see her again."

Vasiliy Fet, a second generation Russian, prepares for his day. He tries out a sword and gets jugs of bug spray, and halothane. When his cat brings him a dead mouse, he announces he's going to go to some killing, too. He's wearing a badge.

Avenue D., Lower East side, Manattan Gus finishes his drive into the city, arriving at the garage just before dawn. He looks around for Thomas Eichhorst and, when he doesn't see him, he goes to inspect the noises coming from the box in the back of his truck. When it starts shaking and emitting a growling, Gus runs for the exit and into daybreak.

JFK Airport, Cargo bay Ephraim Goodweather, Nora Martinez and Jim Kent look over what remains of the body of Bishop, the airport guy who went looking for the cabinet. Kent barfs at the sight of Bishop's crushed head and chafes at the idea the box might have been carrying the biological agent.

Eph gets a call that his boss, Director Everett Barnes, has released the four survivors. Nora and Eph intercept them, but they're not inclined to stay. Joan mentions that someone leaked Regis Air documents that say it was carbon monoxide. Finally, Eph calls in the cops and tells them he and Nora are issuing a quarantine. Joan gets on the phone with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Margaret Pierson.

Stoneheart Group Eldritch Palmer watches the news. Thomas Eichhorst is concerned the CDC lockdown of the airport will delay their time table, but Palmer suggests the survivors will be free in an hour after he gives the press a villain. Palmer is excited to see ""Him,"" but Eichhorst has to visit ""an old friend"" first.

In lock-up, Abraham Setrakian sees Sec. Pierson lambasting the airline. Setrakian gets called to see his lawyer, even though he doesn't have one. It's Eichhorst. Setrakian acts like he's seen a ghost.

Eichhorst recites Setrakian's number by heart and refers to him as ""Jew."" He tells Setrakian the coffin crossed the river and his master is watching now, through him. ""The great game is over now, Jew,"" Eichhorst says. ""Not while I still breathe,"" Setrakian says.

Eichhorst taunts him about god and his sword. ""And her heart, do you still have that as well?"" Eichhorst tells him she struggled at the end but didn't cry out, only saying: ""Abraham.""

Eichhorst continues taunting him, telling him he wants him to survive a little longer to watch it unfold.

Abraham is unmoved, telling Eichhorst he cut his friend Riverhaven to bits and dumped him in the North Sea.

Gus comes home from his errand and finds his brother Chris lounging on the couch eating ice cream. Their mother points out the antique clock Chris stole from Abraham Setrakian, which Chris says he got from a flea market. When their mom leaves, Gus lays into Chris and demands to know where he got the clock. They take turns blaming each other for disappointing their mother. Gus resolves to take the clock back.

At the CDC command post at JFK, Sec. Pierson is there in person. After reviewing the Regis documents pointing to a carbon monoxide leak, she says the CDC is off the case and it's being taken over by the NTSB. Pierson points out a quarantine would stop all shipment into and out of New York and wreak havoc on the economy. Eph tries to argue and when Barnes chalks his emotion up to issues in his personal life, Eph grabs his boss by the lapels to make his case.

He immediately realizes he's made a mistake. Barnes takes him off the case and sends him home.

Outside, Eph can't reach Bennett at the coroner's office.

Eph and Nora meet with Captain Doyle Redfern in a bar. He's pasty and says there's a ringing in his ears. When they ask about the box, he knows what they're talking about. He says four men from a government office showed up at the last minute and put it on.

Eph gives Redfern the name of William Lester an ER doctor that Eph describes as the best diagnositician he knows.

Back in the temporary command post, Eph and Nora examine the worm tentacles. Eph feeds it a drop of blood from a bag and sees it raise up and open it's creepy, tooth, tiny mouth. When Eph's son Zach texts, he's prepared to reschedule and keep working, but Nora convinces him to make his son a priority.

Before leaving, Eph leans in and kisses Nora like he means it.

In a restaurant on W 14th Street in Manhattan, Vasily Fet inspects the kitchen. He's with NY Bureau of Pest Control and finds rat urine. Out front, Joan Luss and Gabriel Bolivar have brunch with his manager, Ruby Wain. Gabriel and Joan hear the same high priced noise, which Joan describes as like an echo of a voice.

Joan takes a sip of her water and notices blood in her mouth. Her eyes are getting blood shot. She heads home to see her family.

In the kitchen, Vasiliy finds a rat and shuts the place down. When diners out front don't listen to his announcement that the place is closed, he waves the rat around to scare them out.

At Stoneheart, Reginald Fitzwilliam tells his boss Palmer he's located a suitable donor liver in Bogota. Palmer thinks he might not need it anymore, but agrees to the plan as a back-up. Fitzwilliam doesn't think they should go anywhere at the moment, but Palmer can't be dissuaded. ""I've never been more excited about a meeting in my entire life,"" Palmer says.

Eph goes to his house. When his wife asks about the plane, she's glad he's on the case. Eph finds his son in back with Matt, converting his old office into a game room. Eph extends a friendly hand, just asking Matt to make his wife happy.

Alone with Zach, his son reminds Eph not to be late to the custody hearing tomorrow. Eph encourages Zach to just say how he feels. Eph tells Zach he's going to ask for joint custody and that he'll be available after this case.

Ephraim goes to an AA meeting. He shares that he's in therapy and how hard it was to see his wife and son with the new guy, but he's resolved not to blow things with his son.

At his loft apartment, Gabe can't shake the ringing in his ears. He crushes up erectile dysfunction pills and snorts them then joins the three naked women in his bed. They notice his hair is falling out but he keeps going. Suddenly, he's mesmerized by one woman's throbbing jugular and he bites down hard on her neck, drawing blood. When the women freak out he kicks them out, but he's soon hungrily licking her trail of blood off the floor.

At St. Sebastian hospital, Redfern is crashing. His lab results are crazy and Eph describes them like something taking over his system and making it into something else. Redfern says he's on fire and his skin is crawling. They look at him under UV light and find the same incision in his neck, and then they notice worms moving under his skin.

Eph tells Jim to call Barnes and get the survivors back in quarantine.

When they still can't reach the ME Bennett, Eph and Nora get in the car and drive to the morgue. On the way, the CDC switch board operator puts a call through from Emma's father, who thanks Eph for sending his girl home to him. Eph is seriously confused, he examined the dead girl himself.

Nora suggests the worms induce hibernation.

""Well, we'll find out in ten minutes. If she's dead, she'll be at the morgue,"" Eph says.

Fitzwilliam drives Palmer to his meeting -- the parking garage where Gus delivered the coffin. Fitzwilliam cautions his boss that he's being deceived, but Palmer says these people have power beyond anything he can imagine, and one day Fitzwilliam will benefit from it, too.

Palmer goes to see the box, and Eichhorst joins him. The creatures zooms around then stands all the way up to his full nine feet, revealing his bald monster face and long claw hands.

Meanwhile, Eph and Nora arrive at the ME's office and find the front desk chair knocked over and the phone off the hook. The morgue is ransacked, dark, and empty. When the lights don't work, they look around with flashlights. They find that every single body bag is empty.

At her house, Emma sits in a cold tub in the dark. Her dad notices her hair is falling out. Her eyes have two lids like Palmer. When her dad leans in, a monster extendo tongue like the big monster's shoots out of her mouth. She latches on to her dad's neck and bleeds him dry."

In the mirror, he can see his eyes are bloodshot, and his teeth appear to be turning into fangs. Outside his house, reporters hover. He goes down to his wife, Ann-Marie, and two children. She tells him she gets overwhelmed when he's gone, and that one night their dog Gertie got out and came back hurt in the morning. He gets a pain in his neck and hears a high pitched noise. She urges him to go back to bed.

Vasily Fet returns to work, where the calls for rat control have skyrocketed. His boss sends him on a call from a top donor to the mayor.

In the hospital, the plane's captain Doyle Redfern is in quarantine, in a bed walled off by plastic. He's scared, but Eph promises him they'll figure out what's wrong with him.

Nora tells Eph she wants to talk to the old man who came to the airport. Eph is ready for any input he can get at this point.

Stoneheart Group Jim Kent waits to see a man named Greg. Eichhorst meets him instead.

He mentions the van and the coffin that Jim let through, then hands him an envelope of money. Jim turns to leave, saying he's going to the police. Eichhorst begins his veiled threats, mentioning a limited drug trial for the type of cancer Jim's wife, Silvia, has. She was rejected from the trial, but Stoneheart makes the drug. Eichhorst offers to let her in, and gives Jim the envelope, which he takes, saying he'll use it for her treatment. Eichhorst explains how their arrangement will work. ""You have two bosses now, Jim Kent. The people at the CDC, and me,"" Eichhorst tells him.

Abraham Setrakian appears before a judge for his trespassing charge. He plays up the old man, Holocaust-survivor card, and promises to have his cane sword melted. The judge dismisses the charges.

Outside, after Nora introduces herself, Abraham says: ""You're here because the bodies have disappeared.""

He asks for the passenger manifest, but she doesn't have it. He tells her she needs to make hard choices, and again tells her to find the bodies and destroy them. She balks.

""Until you're willing to do what needs to be done, you're of no use to me,"" he says.

Queens County Family Court Ephraim and his wife Kelly go to the custody hearing for their son Zach.

After the hearing, Ephraim is angry and thinks his wife is gloating when she checks on him and says he can see Zach any time. She says Zach did what he thought was best for his dad.

He finds the tub filled with red water, and clumps of hair in it. (But no body.) When Nora calls, he asks if any of the personal effects have been returned to next of kin. Whatever she says causes him to rush out of the house, where inside, a more and more dead Emma lurks in the shadows.

Vasily arrives at the hedge fund trader's apartment. He's less concerned about his young daughter being bitten on the face than he is about being kept out of the office. Vasily talks to the girl about rats, putting her at ease. Then he goes into her room and comes out with a bag with something squirming inside, which he has her dad hold, to her delight.

Redferns head is caved in, but tiny worms are oozing out. Nora remembers what Abraham said about cutting off the head and burning the body but first Ephraim wants to examine the body, before the whole hospital descends on him.

I just want to go on record: I do not think this is a good idea, Jim says. A monster just tried to murder us, there are no records, Eph says.

They move Doyles body to a room to examine him and Nora and Eph go looking for surgical equipment, while Eph tells Jim to stay with the body. What if it gets up? Jim asks. Run. Funny. Run, Eph, reiterates, not kidding. But its not going to get up, right?

Flatbush, Brooklyn

Ansels wife Ann-Marie tells him shes taking the kids to his sisters. He thinks thats a super idea, but wont let her call their doctor. She offers to put the dog in the shed, but Ansel tells her to leave her.

Spanish Harlem

Gus gets up in the morning to finds his friend Felix making breakfast. Felix tells him about a guy who will buy cars, but Gus remembers the last sure thing that got him sent to prison. Gus brother Chris is on the couch looking ill.

Stoneheart Group Eichhorst joins Palmer to talk to a hacker named Dutch Felders about a scheme Palmer has to launch a hack and blame Citizens United. Shell do it, as long as she gets the credit.

Nora and Eph examine Doyle while Jim films. They notice vestibulary glands on his throat, which Eph says could be used to expel heat since his body temperature rose. Then they get down to his privates and find that, like Gabe Bolivar, he has none.

They cut him open and see that his lungs have dried up. His insides look dehydrated. His arteries are dead but theres a new circulatory system that has grown just to support the stinger, as Eph calls it. He grabs the tentacle and pulls it out of Redferns body all six feet or so of it.

They notice an ammonia smell, just like on the plane.

Jim is ready to report everything. Eph concludes that its rewriting biology so it can reproduce and consume its host.

The super drops in on Gus mother to give her a hard time about leaving her recycling in the hall. Also, the rent is late. Both Gus and his mom look to Chris, who swears he took it down, but he doesnt seem to be remotely telling the truth.

Gus steps into the hall and intimidates the super into backing off his mom. He also gives him two months rent cash.

Then he agrees to join Felix on his scheme.



Ann-Marie returns home. She doesnt see Ansel or the dog. Shes praying the rosary when he goes outside and sees a bloody torn dog collar in the snow. She follows puddles of blood and finds the dog dead behind the woodshed, with its throat and insides ripped out. She knows Ansel did it.

She looks for him in the woodshed, where it smells awful. Hes hiding from her in the shadows, but then he jumps out, snarling and covered in blood. Hes chained himself by the throat to the shed and snarls at her to run far away and never come back. When she pauses, he tells her the voice in his head is telling him to drink her blood. He manages to compose himself enough to tell her again to run, and she does.

Gus drops by Abrahams pawn shop to return the clock Chris stole. Abraham isnt exactly appreciative to get his own stuff back.

Eph and Nora dump Redferns body in the furnace, trying to figure out their next move. Jim cant handle the guilt and confesses that he waived the van with the box through at the airport.

He tells them a guy named Greg Nelson targeted him at a medical conference and must have known about his crushing debt from his wifes illness. He answers all Ephs questions and mentions a German prick. He pleads that hes on their team, but Eph considers his friend of 10 years and then sucker punches him, telling Jim to go home and that hes dead to him.

When Eph leaves, Nora isnt any more sympathetic. She takes the phone with the autopsy footage and leaves.

In the car, Eph and Nora want to find another victim and remember Emma Arnot.

Meanwhile, in a parking garage, Felix distracts the attendant while Gus steals the keys to a Mercedes and they drive out.

Back in Flatbush, Ann Marie buries the family dog. Her snooty neighbor comes over about the growling coming from the shed, which he assumes is the dog. Ann Marie realizes hes the one who hit the dog the other night.

As Ansel growls more, the neighbor threatens to call the cops. Ann Marie apologizes, then offers to let the neighbor into the garage to teach the dog a few things. He takes her up on it, removing his belt.

Then Ann Marie shoves him into the shed, feeding him to her husband.

Felix and Gus bring their stolen Mercedes to Alonso Creem, the guy Felix heard pays $1,000 for cars. When he offers them $400, Felix is ready to take it but Gus wants to walk. Creem assesses them then pays$800.

She owes him her career and is willing to do whatever he asks.

Suddenly, Palmer passes out. When he wakes up, a doctor tells Palmer his new liver is there and ready for transplant. FitzWilliam says they havent been able to reach Eichhorst and Palmer thinks theyve forgotten him already.

Nora and Eph go to the Arnot house in Queens. They follow the sounds of childrens songs to the basement where they find Emma in a bloody nightgown, with blood all over her face. She lunges at them, with her stinger out.

They are trying to get away when Abraham Setrakian steps out of the shadows with his sword and lops Emmas head off. Hes explaining that Emmas father will be right behind her because they need to find shelter before the sun rises when Mr. Arnot comes out behind Eph and Nora. Abraham shouts at them to move, then takes off Arnots head, too. (These are not particularly fast moving vampires, and seem to be easy targets if you have a giant sword.)

Setrakian warns them not to let the worms touch them, then he sends Eph for gas in the garage.

Nora freaks out upstairs, telling Eph they dont kill their patients. Eph asks her where she thinks the blood on Arnot came from and that he was out killing innocent people.

Eph tries to convince her that the creatures arent people anymore and they have to protect the people of New York. But she is unmoved.

Setrakian joins them. This is not for everyone, he deadpans.

After Nora leaves, Setrakian addresses Eph: Some brains cannot adjust. I can see you love her for that, but you have to let her go. Get the gasoline."

From downstairs, Ruby hears a shriek and a thump. She finds Gabe with his tentacle attached to the still-alive doctor, sucking blood from her neck. She begs Ruby not to leave her, but Ruby takes one look at the situation and runs like hell.

She trips on her way out and limps away, calling someone to tell them that the concert is canceled because Gabe hurt someone ""permanently"" bad. The person on the other end tells her they'll send someone.

At the Arnot's house, Abraham tells Ephraim about the ""scourge,"" which has existed for thousands of millennia. He tells Eph about ""the Master,"" or patient zero, who spreads the virus with the parasites in his blood. He let four passengers live so the media would focus on them and not the dead, giving them time to go home and infect their families.

Abraham is sure every part of it has been planned, including the ""suicide"" of the Regis CEO. Eph realizes Abraham is talking about a vampire.

Poland, 1944 A young Abraham rides in a railroad car with his mother and brother, shivering in the cold. She reminds them of the stories she used to tell them about the evil in the world.

Ansel Barber is next on the list, Abraham expects he will have turned by now. He gives Eph a nail gun with silver nails, explaining that nails will weaken them enough for Abraham to get close enough to kill them. ""What we're dealing with here is the fate of the human race, but I don't expect you to believe that yet. You believe you're drafting me into your cause, but I am drafting you into mine,"" he tells Eph.

Eph tells Abraham about his truck ""Esther,"" which he got in the Congo in exchange for his Rolex when he had to get across a village during an outbreak. Abraham notices they're no heater, which Eph says is a reminder. ""So you're a romantic and unpractical. Wonderful,"" Abraham says.

Abraham leaves Nora a message asking her to call. Abraham tells Eph that people who are turned come back home and destroy those they love the most.

They hear a noise and head to the shed out back. Eph puts on rubber gloves to avoid the worms, then follows Abraham, with the nail gun in one hand and cell phone in the other. They go in the shed and Ansel lunges at them, but he's still chained. Eph shoots him with a nailgun and Abraham cuts off his head. Abraham finds the chewed upon neighbor still alive in the shed but starting to turn and cuts his head off as well. He torches the shed.

Back in the concentration camp, Abraham wakes up when he hears the Master start to suck on his brother's throat next to him. He stays quiet but looks into his brother's eyes as the Master drains him then breaks his neck.

Eph leaves Nora another message. Eph wants to get a quarantined declared, but Abraham is going to continue down the list.

It's an intricately carved woodworking, but no one claims credit. So Eichhorst takes out a gun and shoots a man, saying he'll shoot people one at a time until the perpetrator steps forward. Setrakian claims credit before he can shoot the next man. Eichhorst asks him where he learned to carve like that and then asks to see his hands. He has a special project for Setrakian. He lays out blueprints.

He suggests another Reich might rise in its place. Setrakian speaks freely, saying he thinks that would be a sad day for the world.

Neeva and her daughter pull up to the Luss house and the kids run out before they can stop them. Audrey finds her dad half-dead on the living room floor. Sebastiane is looking him over when Joan Luss creeps out of the shadows and comes at them. Sebastiane knocks Joan's tentacle back with her bare hand and they run for safety, shutting themselves in the wine cellar. They watch in horror as Joan lashes her tentacle tongue out at them.

Jim waits for Eichhorst at the train station as Eph and Nora watch. Eichhorst appears out of nowhere and asks where ""the Jew"" is. He gives Jim a chance to be on the ""right side of history."" He grabs Jim close and tells him: ""I could drink you right here.""

When Jim still plays dumb, Eichhorst tells him to consider Sylvia dead.

Eph and Nora follow Eichhorst down to the subway and Nora sees him walking down the subway tracks. They follow him with their silver bullet guns but lose him in a construction zone.

They hear a noise behind them and hide. But it's Jim. He tells them Eichhorst knows it's a trap and is looking for Setrakian. They run back up to find the old man.

Setrakian sees Eichhorst standing on the platform and boards the train with him. People are coughing and wearing masks on their faces. Eichhorst steps off as the train starts to leave and Setrakian follows. They're alone together on the platform. Setrakian draws his sword, but Eichhorst is far too quick for him.

""Fitting that we should end our journey where it began -- on a train platform,"" Eichhorst says.

Setrakian tells Eichhorst he's following a ""false Messiah who will prove as horrific as the last one."" Eichhorst grabs Setrakian around the neck and begins to open his mouth. Setrakian is helpless, when suddenly a shot rings out. Eph hits Eichhorst in the leg, the silver bullet hole smokes.

As a train passes by, Eichhorst addresses Setrakian: ""I give you another day of life, Jew, for services rendered."" Eichhorst vampire-races away, leaping onto the train and holding on with talons.

In Poland, Eichhorst gives Setrakian a wurst sandwich, saying they have a new cook who makes his own wurst and he's earned the sandwich. The project is done: it's the Master's coffin.

Neeva prays the rosary as Joan Luss and a neighbor vampire come after them. Joan is about to eat her daughter when something fires a metal stake into her head, killing her. The foursome emerges from the wine cellar and sees that the thing that killed Joan appears to be a vampire in a black storm trooper outfit, flanked by half a dozen others with their faces covered.

The lead vampire gently looks over the children to make sure they aren't injured. He looks at the nick on Sebastiane's hand and lets everyone but her go. Then he lifts up his crossbow and fires a stake through Sebastiane's head as her mother screams.

""Do not touch her. She's corrupted,"" he tells Neeva."

Ephraim Goodweather, Jim Kent and Nora Martinez pick Abraham Setrakian up off the subway platform. He explains that Eph wounding Eichhorst with a shot to the leg won't slow him down much as he'll heal quickly, but it will send a message to the master. ""Really, really don't like the sound of that,"" Kent says.

They realize the tunnels are the perfect habitat for the creatures that are destroyed by sunlight and now that it's night time in New York, the city is an open buffet. Unless they can simulate their own sunlight, Eph suggests.

In the tunnel at E. 77th St Station, Manhattan

Eichhorst limps down the tunnel and hops onto the platform, angry and in pain.

Eph, Kent and Nora pull up to a medical supply store but it's closed. Their cabbie drives off, stranding them. Eph sees a window and breaks in. In the warehouse in back Nora thinks she hears something. They come around a corner and run into Vasiliy Fet with his gun drawn.

He thinks they look like looters, but Eph explains they're from the CDC. Vasiliy says he's a looter, but puts his gun away. They find the location for the UVC lights, but Vasiliy already has all 12 of them and has figured out how to use them.

Nora demands half of them and Vasily agrees.

Outside, Nora, Jim and Eph head to a gas station across the street to load up on supplies. Setrakian is curious about Vasiliy, especially when he says he knows the subway tunnels very well.

Jim tries to pay for things, but the credit card machine is slow. In the shop, Dutch, the hacker, responsible for the internet and phone outages gives an acquaintance some cash and takes responsibility for the technological issues. (As a side note, creature master Rick Baker waits in line behind Kent.)

Outside, Vasiliy doesn't think the creatures are vampires, but more like ""rat people."" Setrakian excuses himself to go hunt down a strigoi across the street.

In the shop, Nora tells Eph she expects looting and panic to follow. They see the strigoi come up to the window and watch as Setrakian lops its head off and confronts another one.

He hears the Master's voice, then shoots the approaching thing with a nail gun before taking off its head. Another comes up behind him, but Vasiliy takes care of it. Inside, Dutch freaks out.

Strigoi quickly surround the shop and Rick Baker dies a gruesome death at the tentacle of one of his creations. Kent goes inside to plug in the UVC lights as Eph, Nora and Setrakian try to fend off the approaching horde.

Inside the store, Kent fumbles with the lights an extension cord and makes his way outside in time to fry one of them as it charges. Another gets close and knocks Jim down. The group collects him and makes their way inside the station as the strigoi continue approaching. They can't use the UVC lights through the glass. The clerk and a bread truck driver aren't sure what to make of the fact they've just been locked in by a bunch of gun wielding strangers.

Kent goes to the bathroom to wash out his cut. It's unclear if he's infected or not.

Dutch asks Setrakian what's going on and thinks he's kidding when he says vampires. ""Does he look like he's kidding?"" Vasiliy asks.

Inside the convenience store, Nora is having pangs of guilt over what they're doing. Eph races to charge the lamps so they can walk out of the store.

In the bathroom, Kent tends to his cut, which still seems to be just a cut.

In the garage bay in back, Setrakian explains to Vasiliy that the strigoi are waiting for reinforcements. Vasiliy asks for the rules on how to kill them.

The brain stem must be destroyed or severed; only silver works from guns. The nail gun he got rom Home Depot.

Vasiliy introduces himself and says good-bye.

In the convenience store, Eph tries to convince everyone to pitch in. But Dutch's friend Nicki is freaked out and angry at her. She unlocks the door and runs for it over the objections of everyone. She's able to dash and dodge her way through the slow moving strigoi.

Eph realizes they're not following her. They're not here for her.

The bread truck driver and hacker are ready to make a run for his truck, but Setrakian lectures that the strigoi thrive on discord and dissention and they need to work together. But Dutch and bread truck driver don't listen and head for the door.

The bread truck driver gets attacked before he makes it to his truck. Dutch falls and is about to be easy prey when Eph runs out and saves her. Inside, he announces that no one leaves until they all leave.

Setrakian says they won't make it til morning, more vampires will be coming, sent by the Master, who can see through their eyes. This is not welcome news to Eph.

Vasiliy decides to buy $50 worth of lottery tickets from the clerk Hassan, figuring his luck can't get worse.

Nora catches a glimpse of Kent's small cut on his face and is concerned. She holds a UVC light to his face and she and Eph watch as something slithers beneath the surface.

Eph starts preparing to cut it out of him. Setrakian watches warily.

Eph and Nora lay him down and race to cut him out as Vasiliy notices the vampires are on the roof.

They're looking for multiple points of ingress, just like any other vermin.

Kent starts to get frantic as Eph warns him the box cutter he's about to use on his face is going to hurt. Kent doesn't care.

In the garage, Dutch suggests they take the wheels off the truck with no engine and put them on the truck with no wheels.

Eph slices open Kent's cheek and waits as the worm slithers to the opening. Then he removes the worm and fries it with the UV light. He stitches up a grateful Kent, who realizes they saved his life and his soul. Kent and Nora take a moment to realize they may have an early intervention protocol.

Then they hear Hassan screaming for help as vampires start breaking through the front glass walls using tools. Kent uses the UV light and Setrakian shoots one with a nail gun. Setrakian realizes something is up and they go outside to see a vampire scampering up a pole to take out their power. Setrakian shoots at him but doesn't hit it in the head soon enough. The power to the store goes out.

Inside, they set up the charged UV light but hear screams from the garage. Vasiliy and Dutch are being attacked. The garage is being surrounded. Setrakian announces the bread truck is their only hope, even though the keys are still in the dead bread truck driver's pocket. Dutch doesn't like the idea.

""Fine. We'll put it to a vote: Who wants to stay and die?"" Setrakian deadpans.

He asks Vasiliy for suggestions for getting to the truck. They start grabbing lighter fluid and rags. Eph notices them trying to get in through the HVAC ducts. Setrakian says in one month they'll be fully mature, not like Eichhorst -- he's one of the chosen that was allowed to retain some of his former self.

Vasiliy tries to convince Hassan to leave his protective glass bubble, but he's more concerned with who's going to pay for everything. Vasiliy gives him his $250 winner.

Eph mixes Molotov cocktails as Jim Kent wallows in remorse and gratitude. But as he's talking, Eph sees another worm slither across Jim's face. They peel up his shirt and notice he's crawling with them.

Eph tries to convince him they can take him to a hospital and try to treat him, but Jim says they have to kill him. ""I'd rather be dead than turn into one,"" Jim says.

Setrakian confirms for Jim that once he turns he'll go after the people he loves. He urges Eph to ""release"" Jim before he turns. Setrakian starts to draw his sword, but Eph stops him. Vasiliy steps him, grabs the gun with silver bullets from Eph's pocket and shoots Jim in the head.

Eph attacks Vasiliy, who says he did it because Eph couldn't. ""You were arguing when we need to be moving. I did your friend a favor,"" he says.

Nora cries over Jim's body and Setrakian says a prayer.

Suddenly the noises in the roof get louder and the group makes its way outside -- Hassan refuses to go with them.

Outside, they huddle in a circle, holding up the UV lights and tossing Molotov cocktails. Vasiliy heads for the gas pumps, asking to borrow a credit card in the chaos. (He's currently in a dispute over his credit limit.) He punches in Eph's zip code and then awaits authorization.

He announces he's approved then fills up buckets with the gas as they make their way to the bread truck. Eph gets the gruesome task of digging through the bread truck driver's pockets for the keys. When he sees the driver is still alive and muttering in pain, Eph contemplates and then shoots him in the head.

Vasiliy hurls a final round of flaming bottles at the vampires as everyone jumps into the bread truck. Vasiliy flattens one on his way out of the lot and they head down the street and into the night."

Kelly's friend Diana drops Zach back at their house at night. The house looks dark and she's worried no one's home, but they see a figure pass by the window.

Once inside, Zach sees his house is trashed. He's looking around when Vasiliy and tread truck drive up with Eph inside. Inside, Zach runs into vampire Matt, who immediately starts attacking.

Zach is dodging him when his dad comes in and stabs Matt with a silver knife. The group in the truck hears the ruckus. Zach watches as Eph goes after Matt, lopping his head off with a shovel. Zach doesn't know where his mom is.

Setrakian wants to search the house. Eph warns him and Vasiliy not to do anything while Matt is in the house if they find Kelly turned.

Zach explains that Matt didn't come home last night. Eph noticed that Matt already had a wound on his face.

Setrakian reminds Eph that if something has happened to Kelly, she'll be back soon for Zach.

Still in lock-up, the guard tells Gus that no doctors are available, but one will look him over once they get to Rikers.

Back at Eph's house, he packs up things for Zach, explaining that Zach is going to go with Setrakian to his pawn shop while Eph stays at the house.

Downstairs, Nora is upset over Jim Kent's death, while Vasiliy gently asks her what he should have done differently. She says one of his friends should have been the one to kill him, but Vasiliy points out they weren't ready.

Poland, 1944

Eichhorst oversees prisoners, including Setrakian, digging a mass grave in the freezing cold.

Dutch shares her sympathies with Eph and Nora before heading back to the bread truck.

When they reach Dutch's place, Vasiliy insists on coming up with her to make sure it's safe. Dutch looks around for her friend Nicki, but find she is gone. She also stole all of Dutch's money and her laptop.

In the bread truck, Setrakian notices Zach crying. He thinks she'll be upset that Matt is dead. Zach noticed Setrakian called Matt a vampire, but his dad didn't. Setrakian encourages him to mourn Matt's passing, then move on.

Back in Poland, Setrakian goes back into the woodshop and grabs a knife, taping it to his ankle. Eichhorst finds him and thinks he's just upset over finishing the coffin. The camp is crumbling around them.

Vasiliy and Dutch are still in her apartment when her stoner next door neighbor comes in and attacks them. Dutch takes him out with a ballpeen hammer then sends Dutch to pack. They rejoin the truck.

In Setrakian's shop, they rejoin Nora's mother and head downstairs, carrying loaves of bread.

Setrakian gives Zach an old book to read about the vampires.

Vasiliy asks Setrakian about humans that might be working with the vampires. Dutch hangs back as Setrakian says they're people seduced by power. He wants Fet's help because he's unsentimental. He suggests they need to find the Master's nest, but Fet wants to go home for a few things first.

At Kelly's house, Eph and Nora wrap Matt's body in plastic to burn it out back. He thinks Kelly might have been the one who wounded Matt. As they watch the body burn, Nora says Jim Kent was the kindest man she ever knew. Eph says the moment Jim lifted up his shirt, it was the worst moment of his life.

At Setrakian's, Dutch confesses that Eldritch Palmer hired her to shut the internet down. She mentions a German ""plastic faced freak"" with Palmer. Setrakian asks if she can undo what she's done.

Back in the barracks at night in Poland, the Master runs through the bunks, attacking. Setrakian takes out his knife and clices his finger. He waits for the Master. Finally, the Master swoops over the yanks Setrakian out of his bed, forcing him to drop the knife.

He brings Setrakian to his knees and talks to him, saying he knows Setrakian has watched him every night and asking if this is the best he can do. Setrakian begs God for help, and the Master takes his hands the crushes them.

In the Riker's transport van, Felix is looking particularly green. Then he opens his mouth and shoots out his tentacle. The guards open the window into the back and Felix snakes his tentacle through and latches onto the driver. The van crashes.

At Kelly's house, Nora is able to get through to her mother for a few minutes. Eph checks on her, and they just happen to be on a bed. They start kissing and stripping.

The remaining guard opens the door to the back of the van, but Felix quickly latches on to him. Gus grabs the guard's keys and gun, saying a brief prayer before he shoots Felix. He tosses the key to the remaining prisoners and runs off.

In the morning in Poland, Setrakian wakes up crushed fingers and gets a fellow prisoner to straighten them.

The prisoners are separated into two groups by Eichhorst, who sees Setrakian's fingers and sends him with the group lining up in front of the mass grave. Setrakian kneels , waiting to be killed. Instead they hear gunshots coming from the woods and allied plans flying overhead. The prisoners help Setrakian scaled the barbed wire fence to freedom into the woods.

At Kelly's house, Diane busts in looking for Kelly and finds half naked Nora and Eph in the bedroom demanding answers. Eph tells Diane to get out of town and have Kelly call if she hears from her. Eph assures Diane that he loves Kelly because she's the mother of his son, which Nora isn't thrilled to hear.

Eph and Nora return to Setrakian's place, where Zach asks if they burned Matt's body. Eph curls up on the couch with his son, promising they'll look for his mom in the morning.

Meanwhile, eichhorst returns to his apartment lair and pulls the silver bullet from his waxy flesh.

Back in Poland, Eichhorst makes his own escape through the snowy landscape. He opens a metal storm cellar door in the woods and goes in. The Master's coffin rests inside. Eichhorst sits with it and drinks, then he gets weepy, crying out ""Why have you forsaken me?""

The Master appears. ""I have done everything you asked. I'm ready,"" Eichhorst says.

""Then it is time,"" the Master says. He removes his hood to reveal and white, almost bat-like face with no nose and pointy ears.

He uses his long claw to slice open Eichhorst's arm and then his own finger, to free a worm that slides into Eichhorst's body."

He calls, but gets her voice mail.

Eph tells Zach he'll go get her. The TV news announces 23 banks failed yesterday and the world financial system is on the brink of collapse.

Eph tells Nora about the fact the phone is moving during daylight hours. Setrakian tells Eph to go, but to prepared for what he might find. Eph tells Zach to stay and text if the location changes.

Vasily Fet lays out his theory about how to attack the vampires, comparing them to rats who always have an escape route. He needs online transit maps from around the World Trade Center, but can't access them with the internet out.

""Yea, sorry about that,"" Dutch says, filling in Nora and Fet on her hacking. She thinks she could fix it if she could get into Palmer's office, Vasily thinks he could get her in with his city credentials.

Eph drives to Astoria, the phone location. The streets are full of people racing around with their things, and car crashes. Eph sees a homeless woman with Kelly's phone. She tells him she found it on the street. He thinks he's a cop, but when he says he's a doctor, she shows him an infected burn on her leg. He wraps her leg and she takes him to where she found the phone -- next to Kelly's car.

Inside the car, Eph finds bloody tissues and fears the worst.

32 Hours Earlier, at Kelly Goodweather's house

Vampire Matt creeps through the darkness and stands over a sleeping Kelly. He seems to resist the idea of attacking her and she wakes up as he walks out.

She tries to talk to him through the bathroom door, but gets annoyed when he doesn't respond.

At Kelly's school, barely half the teachers and students are there. She tells a teacher about Eph's warning, then leaves to get Zach and leave town.

Back at home, she finally comes face to face with Matt and dodges him when he lashes out at her with his tentacle. In the kitchen, she fends him off with whatever she can find, first a glass pitcher, then the blades of a blender, which she mashes into his face.

The blades slice his cheek open and worms fly everywhere -- including onto her face. She's helpless as one of them digs its way into her eyeball, but then she makes it out the front door and back to her car as Matt is trapped inside by the daylight.

In the car she examines her eyeball, which is already turning red. There are worms crawling everywhere under her skin. She blots at her face with a tissue and crumples over crying.

She wakes up in Astoria in her car in full transition. She takes out her phone to call someone but starts heaving and gets out of the car, dropping her phone. She stumbles down the street at dusk.

She makes her way to Zach's school, which is mostly empty, to pick him up. The principal thinks Kelly was in an accident and needs medical attention. When the principal goes to call 911, Kelly stumbles outside in the dark. She runs into a vampire, who shows no interest in her.

She hears a vampire feeding on someone and starts to feel the pull for blood herself.

In the truck on their way to Stoneheart Group, Dutch notes Fet's shorthand way of communicating with Setrakian. He questions her to make sure she's serious about going after Palmer.

At the building, Fet charms the receptionist to get access to the executive dining room. He's feeling smug until the elevator doors open and they're greeted by large armed security guards and escorted to see Reginald Fitzwilliam. He takes their guns and escorts Dutch in to see Palmer alone, leaving Fet angry but unable to do anything against the five or six guards.

Meanwhile, Eph, with gun in hand, goes back to his wife's house.

17 Hours Earlier Kelly's friend Diane is passed out on her couch with a bottle of wine when Kelly tries her door. Diane lets Kelly in, but can quickly see she's not OK.

Kelly grabs a picture of her with Kelly and is examining it when Diane's son comes down the stairs. Kelly lashes out at him with her tentacle and is chomping down when Diane jumps on her to pry her off. Kelly turns on Diane and drains her dry.

When Fitzwilliam asks Dutch why she'd come back, she explains that he may be fine with being a lackey but she doesn't like being taken advantage of. Nevertheless, he warms her that if she tries anything with Palmer, he'll kill her.

Palmer admires Dutch's audacity in coming to confront him, and she bluntly asks if he's a vampire, too. She tells him no rational human would do what he's done. He gloats about being on the brink of immortality and taunts her, saying she helped him because she feels how insignificant she is.

She lashes out and slaps him and Fitzwilliam grabs her. ""We won't see her again,"" Palmer orders.

Out on the street at night, Kelly hears the Master calling her name. She gets vampire vision as she assesses two people walking past her, then hears the Master summoning her. She goes down into the tunnels.

She finds him. ""Rejoin. Embrace your glorious fate,"" he tells her.

Back at Stoneheart, Fitzwilliam and four security guards march Dutch and Fet through the tunnels, expecting to be shot.

Fitzwilliam announces that he's letting them go. ""I don't agree with what he's doing, so I can hardly carry out an order against the people who are trying to make this right,"" he says.

He explains the other guards are loyal to him, but won't act when Fet asks them to join him.

Meanwhile, Eph goes to Diane's house looking for Kelly. He sees the shattered picture frame and signs of a struggle. He goes down into the basement and finds Diane and her son turned and lying on the ground. He shoots her when she starts to attack, then can barely bring himself to pull the trigger when her son does the same.

With them both dead, Eph sees a necklace in Diane's hand. It belongs to Kelly. He breaks down.

Back at the pawn shop, he tells Nora he didn't find anything. When Fet and Dutch come back, Eph is annoyed to see her. She takes offense and leaves, over Fet's objections.

Zach comes down for new about his mom, and Eph tells him he's not giving up.

Zach goes through pictures on her phone and a video of him opening boxes in boxes in boxes to get to a tiny bicycle. She tells him to check the back deck, where he finds the real thing.

Sitting alone, Zach cries over his mom."

Gus goes back to his apartment in Spanish Harlem (still in his prison jumpsuit). He finds the door unlocked and a horrible smell inside. The fridge is open, and his brother Christopher is standing motionless in front of the TV watching soccer. Except that it's not Chris anymore. Gus fights him off, seeming to avoid any knicks or worm splatter.

At Setrakian's, Eph worries about what happens if no one comes back from trying to kill the Master. He suggests to Nora that she stay behind, which only annoys her. She thinks they have no choice. Her mother and Zach will stay behind.

As they prepare later in the bread truck, Setrakian gives Nora Jim Kent's knife. Eph explains to Zach that he'll be back by sundown at the latest. Zach is still worried about finding his mother. Eph tells him to watch out for Mama Martinez and stay in the basement under all circumstances. He locks Zach in, but leaves him the keys.

In the pawn shop, Mrs. Martinez accuses Zach of taking her ashtray. Zach pokes around Setrakian's weapons but Mrs. Martinez agitatedly bothers him for cigarettes.

Out on the streets, the looting and anarchy has begun. ""Everyone for himself, that's what the Master is counting on,"" Setrakian says.

At home, Gus tries to call his mother at work but her shift isn't until 6 p.m.

Gus hears a noise from a back bedroom. Full of dread, he goes to look in the closet. He finds his mother asleep, hiding from the sun in the process of turning and he breaks down sobbing.

At Setrakian's, Zach hears Mrs. Martinez at the front gate begging and wailing for someone to let her out. She's worried that someone took Nora. Zach tries to talk to her, but she's confused and upset. Finally, he asks if she'll go wait for him if he goes to get her cigarettes.

Chambers Street Station Setrakian explains that the Master would head below the World Trade Center site because he thrives on human suffering. They walk down into the subway, where their UV light shows a trail of vampire splatter. They press onward into the dark, dank tunnels. Fet councils them to stay away from the third rail, just in case it's live.

They start to find people's personal artifacts, wallets, shoes and watches. Even a bunny rabbit.

At the pawn shop, Zach heads out into the chaos on the streets. People are siphoning gas and a police car is crashed an abandoned. A woman runs up to him, asking if his cell phone has a signal. He says no. and keeps walking briskly.

In the tunnels, the group comes up a pile of nesting turning vampires. Setrakian says they have to leave them to avoid alerting the Master to their presence. The foursome delicately steps over bodies until Eph sees a woman he thinks is Kelly. He goes to look, but is relieved to find it's not her.

Back at Gus' apartment, his mother awakes and slowly approaches him -- on the other side of the sunlight streaming through the windows. He apologizes for not being there for her, then throws down his bat and walks out.

When he hears noises in the hall, he grabs the fire axe. He sees the super, now a vampire. He doesn't really mind confronting him, gleefully lopping his head clean off.

Down in the tunnels, Fet dismisses Eph when he thinks he hears a train. Eph is very quickly proven right as they all have to jump for safety as a train roars past. This later leads to a pissing contest between the two men. Fet is tired of Eph always needing the last word, and Eph is tired of Fet's know-it-all Brooklyn pride. ""You've been waiting for this your whole life, haven't you? Congratulations on the vampire apocalypse,"" Eph snarls.

Setrakian finally snaps the two back on task.

Further into the tunnels, they encounter a vampire, but Setrakian warns them not to kill it yet and risk alerting the Master. They are spared confrontation when the vampire steps on the third rail, which turns out to be very much alive. The vampire is fried, and Eph takes note of another way to kill them.

Out on the streets, Zach goes into a convenience store that has been completely cleaned out. He sees someone lying behind the counter and snaps a picture with his phone rather than getting close. He's about to grab the cigarettes by the clerk when a young couple comes in to scavenge. Zach runs to hide in the back, down a service conveyer into the basement storeroom. He sees a vampire lurking in the shadows and scrambles to climb back up by drops his mom's phone. He deliberates, then jumps down to grab it. He makes it back up to the main floor, but bumps into the scavengers.

They grab him, but the man is soon taken out by the basement vampire. Zach is spared seeing it attack, but runs. Before he makes it to the store door, he runs into Gus and his axe. Gus tells him to scram, then goes to dispatch the vampires.

Zach grabs cigarettes on his way out.

In the tunnels, they think they've hit a dead end, but notice a small passageway, only big enough to inch through. Eph starts in on his belly, in a space so tight there's barely room for air. He makes it through 20 or 30 yards of tunnel to the other side and whispers the all clear. The others notice a pack of vampire closing in on them and Setrakian starts through as Fet volunteers to hold them off.

From in the tunnel, Setrakian calls to Eph for help, but Eph is distracted by hearing Kelly's voice calling to him, pleading with him: ""don't let them hurt me."" Setrakian tries to warn him, but Eph wanders off toward the sound.

On the other side, Fet and Nora open fire on the vampires closing in and Fet urges Nora to get into the tunnel. She starts scooting and Fet dispatches the vampires near him, squeezing into the small space as quickly as he can.

He's too big for the tunnel and quickly gets stuck. As he struggles to free himself, a vampire slithers in behind him effortlessly, closing in dangerously close until Nora is able to pull Fet to safety. They use the UV light to keep the tunnel vampire at bat.

But Setrakian and Eph are nowhere in sight.

Eph has followed the siren's call to a cavernous room, where the Master's coffin is lying on the ground. Eph opens it and digs through, but finds nothing. He starts to see vampires closing in on him, but none of them are Kelly. The game is getting to him.

He looks up and sees the Master slithering across the ceiling. In a blink, the Master floats down to stand nine feet tall in front of Eph. Eph can barely think to swing his sword, and the Master grabs Eph's attacking hand like he's swatting a fly.

The Master grabs Eph by the neck and slowly strangles him as he tells him the professor's student has failed and now he'll take everything from Eph, including his wife and child. ""I am a drinker of men,"" he growls.

The Master is about to tentacle suck Eph's face off when Setrakian arrives. The Master recognizes him as the professor and gets in his head somehow, stopping his attack. But Nora and Fet are close behind and Fet unleashes the UV strobe light bomb. It quickly fries all the vampires surrounding Eph, but the Master drops him and slithers away down the tunnel.

Back at the pawn shop, Zach returns to Mrs. Martinez with her cigarettes. Zach picks up one of Setrakian's knives and starts pantomiming stabbing with it.

Back in the tunnel, Setrakian is furious at Eph for falling for the Master's trick, and at Fet for using the light bomb when Setrakian was close enough to kill him. Setrakian starts screaming that he won't rest until the Master is dead, then he picks up a sledgehammer and obliterates the coffin he so carefully carved decades ago. Nora wants to regroup, but Setrakian presses onward, determined to find him. They come to a fork in the tunnel and Setrakian wants to go blindly on. Fet instead has everyone turn off their flashlights and shines UV to find the opening the Master went through -- the same one Setrakian was going to enter, which he sees as confirmation.

Again, he's ready to forge blindly ahead into the darkness, but Fet grabs him and throws a flare into the cavern. It reveals hundreds of vampires in transition. Setrakian is still ready to go ahead, but Eph and Fet drag him away, trying to prevent a suicide mission."

Thomas Eichhorst visits Eldritch Palmer at his sick bed. He can tell Palmer's health is failing and his heart is about to give out. Palmer is anxious for the Master to save him, but Eichhorst toys with him, suggesting he might not. Palmer says he has faith.

Nora Martinez, Vasily Fet, Ephraim Goodweather and Abraham Setrakian return to the pawn shop from their failed mission to kill the Master. Zach doesn't tell his dad about leaving to get Mrs. Martinez cigarettes.

Setrakian goes down to his secret room, pops a few pills and talks to the vampire heart he keeps in a jar, asking it to give him strength.

Shkoder, Albania -- 1967

Setrakian tries to rent a horse from a scared villager, who is nervous about Setrakian's destination to a castle on the hill. He asks about a German headed that way. After buying the horse outright, Setrakian returns to his wife Miriam, whose leg is in a brace. She worries about him going off alone. He promises her they'll settle down after his life's work is finished and they'll adopt a boy and girl like she's always wanted. He promises to be back by sundown.

Back in Setrakian's shop, he worries there will be no next time. She sees the heart, but he angrily refuses to answer her questions.

Long Island City, Queens

Gus waits in the backseat of Alonso Creem's car, disarming him when he gets in.

At the pawn shop, Fet is trying to pinpoint the vampire horde on a map. Eph is extremely disturbed by Setrakian trying to get the four on them to take on the horde alone.

They're interrupted by Dutch Felders rattling the gate. She announces she brought them ""a win.""

She says she has a way to put Eph on the Emergency Broadcast network to reach every TV and radio in the country. He wonders who would listen to him -- an escaped fugitive wanted for murder. She urges him to use his notoriety.

Driving where Gus tells him, Alonso tries to explain he's not a good man to go up against. Gus points out the city is in the middle of a plague and no one is going to come after him.

Albania 1967

On his newly purchased horse, Setrakian follows tracks to a well were he finds a pile of personal artifacts laying on the ground. He secures a rope and slowly lowers himself into the deep, dark well where he's greeted by a terrible stench. He puts on a miner's helmet light and takes his sword with him, crawling through a small opening at the bottom of the well and into a dark dungeon-like area.

With his sword out, he looks around in the darkness, heading down a tunnel. Outside, the sun is beginning to set.

Finally, he comes upon vampires in various stages of turning, some of whom are asleep and one of whom is not. It starts talking to him, calling him ""professor"" and telling him that the sun is setting and he is very far from home.

Setrakian hightails it back to the bottom of the well, but his rope is gone. The sun has set. Eichhorst leans over the top of the well, taunting him by saying he knew Setrakian could not handle such an inviting trap. ""I'll leave you here to ponder your mistakes,"" Eichhorst says.

Back on the roof of the pawn shop, Dutch rigs her emergency alert. Her plan is to use the scheduled weekly test for Eph's message. She explains to Fet that she's going to have to perform an NSA-level hack. She explains she learned everything from her father, who thought hackers were more curious than malicious. She admits she lost her way when she hacked the internet for Palmer.

Fet asks about the accent and Dutch says she moved to London for a woman. Her dad died when she was 12 and she left home when she was 15

Fet has one more question: ""Men or women?"" ""I specialize in passionate destructive relationships,"" Dutch says. ""The best kind,"" he says.

In the pawn shop, Eph prepares his speech. Nora comes to put her mother to bed, taking her cigarettes.

Meanwhile, Alonso drives up to shipping containers parked on the docks and enters an office. He opens his safe and hands over a pile of guns. Gus gets nervous when a car pulls up. Alonso says it's a delivery he's expecting. He says he'll handle it.

Alonso tells the man that Gus works for him in logistics. The man drops off a bag and leaves. Gus demands to see what's inside and finds a wad of cash. Then Gus gets curious about what the man would pay so much to ship in the containers.

In the middle of the night, Setrakian explains his history hunting vampires, and feelings of failure. ""Seeing the Master in the tunnels after all that time, I lost perspective. I realize that now. I reacted with rage and impulse and emotion. I apologize. But I have rested and I am ready to press ahead with the fight,"" he says.

Poland 1967 Setrakian painstakingly climbs his way out of the bottom of the well using the narrow brick ledges as toeholds. When he emerges it's daylight again and his fingers are bloody.

His horse is disemboweled. Setrakian races home to his wife.

He finds his house ransacked and his wife's leg brace on the floor.

Back in the pawn shop, Dutch prepares her hack to broadcast Eph's warning. It works. He introduces himself. ""I'm here to warn you of an urgent danger. There is a disease spreading through New York City and possibly beyond. This plague is responsible for the mysterious disappearances we've been seeing.""

He plays the video of his autopsy of the vampire captain and explains what happens when people turn. He gets as far as explaining that sunlight kills them when the broadcast is cut off. The group celebrates momentary, but then hears Mrs. Martinez's distressed cries.

They race upstairs to find Gabriel Bolivar attacking her. Fet and Eph fend him off, but Eichhorst leads a team of vampires up to the shop and in the front door as the group all races downstairs.

Back at the dock, Gus marches Alonso to the shipping container and blasts off the lock. A horde of very hungry vampires pours out and starts attacking them. Gus gives Alonso a gun, but he turns on Gus. The vampires soon follow Alonso, but Gus is out of bullets. He tracks down Alonso and takes his gun. Gus is firing again when the mysterious team of paratrooper vampires shows up and kills the entire shipping container horde and grabs Gus.

Down in the pawn shop, Setrakian prepares everyone to go out his secret passageway. Nora sobs over her mother's body and wants to take her with them. Eph tells her to go with Zach. She sees the sword in his hand and takes it. Setrakian watches her as she lets loose a fierce primordial scream and chops her own mother's head off.

Setrakian remembers back to Poland. Later that night, his wife Miriam came home, turned into a vampire. Holding the hands of two young children, a girl and a boy, like they always discussed. He swun his sword.

Setrakian gently wipes the blood of Nora's sword and tells her: ""It had to be done, for her.""

In Poland, Setrakian stands over the decapitated body of his wife.

In the pawn shop, Eichhorst continues to taunt Setrakian by his prisoner number, telling him he is coming for him. Setrakian looks at the heart in the jar.

In Poland, he says a prayer for forgiveness in the hopes that his wife won't have died in vain, then, wearing gloves, he cuts open her chest and takes out her still beating, worm-filled heart.

In the pawn shop, he says: ""Good bye Miriam, til we meet again.""

Eichhorst and his minions break through into the basement just as Setrakian escapes through his secret passageway.

Eichhorst sees the heart in the jar and addresses Setrakian. ""You have abandoned all that you love. But still it will not be enough.""

At the Stoneheart group, the Master finally comes to see Palmer, giving him a few drops of his blood. When Fitzwilliam comes to check on his boss, he finds Palmer rejuvenated and out on his balcony laughing with joy out in the rain."

Thomas Eichhorst appears. Palmer is feeling great, but wondering when his tentacle will appear. Palmer clarifies that the Master didn't feed Palmer the worm. He gave him health, but not immortality. Palmer is disappointed, and angry, especially when so many other people are being turned. Eichhorst explains that's different than what Palmer wants. But first the Master has ""another test for your everlasting devotion.""

On a bright sunny day, Zach is excited to try out his new bike. Kelly films him for Eph, who is out of town. Zach wakes up to the sound of gunshots at Dutch Felder's loft in Brooklyn.

Downstairs, Eph, Fet and Setrakian make a plan for going back again at the Master. Fet suggest he and Eph do recon in the daylight.

When Zach comes downstairs and asks if they're attacking the Master again, Setrakian answers affirmatively for Eph, who is annoyed. Zach asks if they're going back home, and Eph says they can't ever again.

When Zach goes back upstairs, Setrakian argues against Eph sheltering Zach, including from the truth about what happened to his mother.

Meanwhile, in a dark cavernous room, the good vampire removes the hood from Gus. They're deep underground. Gus is understandably very nervous, but acting tough. The paratrooper vampire explains he didn't bring him down there to drink him, and cuts him free. Gus takes his opportunity to try to strike out, but the paratrooper vampire quickly knocks him down, chastising him like he's a misbehaving puppy.

Back at Stoneheart, Palmer adds Mrs. Setrakian's turned heart to his macabre collection of his own failed organs in jars. He's recently learned about Eph's emergency broadcast last night and the fact that the Secretary of Health and Human Services Maggie Pierson is considering quarantining all of Manhattan. Palmer wants to go talk to her, but Fitzwilliam calmly refuses to bring the car around.

Fitzwilliam coolly explains that he's done looking the other way and that Palmer's return to health is an affront against nature and god. As Palmer rages at him for his betrayal, he asks who will protect him.

""The question is, sir, what will you do without me to protect you?"" Fitzwilliam says, then he boards the elevator and leaves.

Fet and Eph arrive in Tribeca in broad daylight. Eph immediately recognizes the structure above the location where they found the horde of vampires protecting the Master. ""That goth douchebag,"" he says, looking at Gabriel Bolivar's concert hall and lair, the Vestry.

While that makes it likely the Master is inside, Fet says they have to make sure. He knows the theater's history, and the history of the restaurant across the street, including that a gangster built a tunnel to run booze between the two.

Eph and Fet explore the restaurant, which seems completely empty. They find the door. Eph doesn't love the idea of going in, but Fet argues for recon.

They enter the tunnel with flashlights and find the connecting old sewer tunnel. Fet finds a ladder and follows it up into the basement of the Vestry.

They see the Master's smashed coffin inside and a group of napping vampires nearby. Then they begin to wake up and Eph declares the recon over.

Back on the street outside, Fet opens the sewer tunnel cover to flood it with sunlight and prevent other monsters from flooding to the Vestry.

Back at Dutch's house, she's annoyed she can't get any TV channels, but Eph thinks it's a good sign in response to their broadcast. She's drinking, but he pours out her booze, saying they have work to do.

Eph finds Nora on the roof, exhausted and grieving over her mother. He tells her what they found, but says he can't go, because of Zach. She says Eph should bring him. ""You do not have the luxury of choice anymore. All we can do now is fight. If you want to protect Zach, keep him by your side, always, and we'll see this thing through,"" Nora says.

Maggie Pierson meets with Everett Barnes, the head of the CDC, making plans to quarantine Manhattan. Eldritch Palmer and Thomas Eichhorst arrive. She says someone lied to her, or he lied to her. She's talking to the President in an hour and recommending he declare martial law in New York City. He says she'll be ending her career, but she knows people are being turned and says her loyalty is to the American people, not him.

He asks to speak to her alone on the terrace, leaving a nervous Barnes with a creepy Eichhorst. Barnes tries to make small talk. Then they see Palmer hoist Pierson over the railing and toss her off the building.

Palmer asks Barnes what he would do if he got Maggie's job in the wake of her untimely suicide. Barnes very quickly toes the vampire line, saying they'll stay the course and arguing that he was the one who fired Eph and had him arrested. ""I think we'll keep him,"" Palmer tells Eichhorst.

Back at Dutch's, Eph and Setrakian sit down with Zach. Setrakian gives Zach a silver sword, saying it's very dangerous. Eph explains how to use it, choking back tears as he tells his young son how to kill.

""Since the beginning of Creation, boys have hunted beside their fathers. This is no different,"" Setrakian says.

""This is very different,"" Eph says, but says they'll get through it. And win.

Later, the group heads back to the passageway in the restaurant. Setrakian reminds them not to fall for the Master's mind games.

Fet leads the way into the tunnels, where they find dozens of vampires stopped by the light streaming in the open manhole cover. Setrakian explains it won't hold, they'll push through. Fet takes out the dynamite he retrieved from his place and blasts them.

They head on into the Vestry, where they face off with a dozen vampires. They attack. Nora slices off heads with abandon, Dutch is about to fire at a vampire, but she recognizes her as a friend. Then she psyches herself up to stab her and Eph finishes her off.

Fet, Dutch and Nora fight off the vampires who continue to advance while Setrakian and Eph, holding Zach by the hand, go look for the Master. When a female vampire rushes the Goodweathers, Eph fires, but she keeps coming. Zach lifts his sword and impales her.

Eph thinks it might be Kelly, but is relieved when it's not.

More vampires come into the hall's first floor, where Fet has run out of bullets. Eichhorst joins the fray, planning to drink Dutch first. Fet grabs him from behind and is grappling with him as Bolivar slings his tentacle at Nora, who slices it off.

Upstairs, Setrakian reaches the top level of the Vestry. He hears his wife Miriam's voice and sees the Master swoop by in the darkness. Suddenly, he feels the Master behind him and turns to face him. Eph and Zach creep up the stairs, and begin breaking the windows, letting the sunlight burn the Master as Setrakian swings at him. The Master flings Setrakian to the ground like he's rag doll, but the Master is hemmed in by the sunlight.

Downstairs, Fet gets clear of Eichhorst and Dutch fires silver bullets at him, then Fet launches a few silver nails into Eichhorst's face, which succeeds in making him very angry.

Back upstairs, Setrakian is back on his feet and advancing on the Master, telling him it's over. But the Master knocks the sword out of his hand.

Seeing what's going, Eph raises his own sword and advances on the Master, who turns and jumps through a wall of windows out onto the roof and full daylight.

Downstairs, Eichhorst has Fet on the ground and is ready to strike, when suddenly he and the other vampires are called backward, silently.

Upstairs, the Master sizzles in the sunlight. Setrakian raises his sword ""in the name of all that is holy"" and advances yet again. But the sizzling Master runs down the side of the building, scorched but alive. He makes it to the ground below and disappears.

Back in the building, Setrakian is stunned that the Master survived. ""If sunlight doesn't kill him, what does?"" Eph asks.

""We're lost,"" Setrakian says.

Meanwhile, back with the paratrooper vampires, Gus again tries to take one on and is almost politely put down. The paratrooper knows Gus drove the coffin into the city and wonders if he'd like some revenge. Gus takes advantage of the open door and runs. He's deep into the sewers when he notices he's on a puddle of something -- a lake of blood.

Lights come up and Gus sees three naked vampires on stands, resting. The paratrooper explains they're the ancient vampires and they're asleep. He speaks for them. ""An ancient truce has been broken, and act of war has been declared. We need a human soldier who can move freely in the daylight, someone who can use the power of the sun to massacre the unclean,"" he says.

He offers Gus payback and a rich payday.

In the bread truck on the way to Fet's, Zach is having trouble breathing. They swing by Kelly's house to get his extra inhalers. Zach and Eph go inside. Eph gets the inhalers while Zach goes to get a photo album. When he comes back with it, he's not wheezing. Eph realizes he faked it just to get the album, because Eph said they were never coming back.

When Zach asks how his mom will find them at Fet's place, Eph says she will, still not telling him the likely bad news.

They're getting ready to go when they see a woman's figure outside. They look on the patio and see Kelly. She calls to Zach, but Eph holds him back, saying it's not her anymore. He shoots, but she's only wounded. She runs off.

The rest of the group comes inside and Setrakian explains the Master will use Kelly and his love for his son against them. Eph goes to the cupboard and pours himself a drink. ""Let him try,"" he says.

At night, in the truck on the way to Fet's, Setrakian's voice over wonders if the war is already lost. ""Or now that the enemy has finally shown his face, do we have a fighting chance?""

Eph watches the smoldering wreckage of Manhattan as they drive on."

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7182550/?ref_=ttep_ep1,,New recruit Ben Warren has to get used to the fact that emergencies at the fire department are different than in the hospital; events at an apartment fire leave the future of the station's leadership in jeopardy.,[],TV-14,Release date,['Paris Barclay'],"['', '']",[],[],[],"A woman is on her laptop in bed, cyber stalking her ex-boyfriend. She calls her friend who convinces her to log off the computer. She puts the lid down, while keeping the laptop on her pillow, and goes into her bathroom. Sparks begin to fly from the power cord ... and the pillow ignites.

A voice-over begins in a woman's voice. This is the first clue that we have entered Shonda-Land! Fire engines are racing to the scene in all their fire-engine glory. They arrive at a home with smoke billowing out while the voice over continues, talking about the legendary file pole that we all imagine fire fighters slide down with every call. The crew rushes to put the fire out, while Captain Obvious orders, ""Contain the flames and get the hell out!"" I could have called that play, and I don't even have any fire training. He barks some other orders and assignments for his team to pair up. The crew enter a smoky house looking for the victim and the source of the flames. Quite naturally, they find the cyber stalker on her bathroom floor, coughing from smoke inhalation. I have questions: Why didn't she open the window? Or put a towel under the door to keep smoke from seeping into the bathroom she is trapped in? Didn't she smell the smoke? They remove her from the bathroom. Another eye-rolling sentence is now delivered by the ones who are not on rescue: ""The wet stuff on the red stuff!"" In case we weren't sure what methods they would use to extinguish the fire. The victim is pulled from the home and tells the team that ""Charlie is still in the house. The men inside think it's a child. However, they find a dog hiding under a chair. Two female fire fighters complain that even though they were the ones to rescue the cyber stalker, that she only thanked the one male fire fighter who put her dog in her arms. They declare that next time, they will be the ones who save the puppy. In true Shonda fashion, feminism will be a major plot theme.

The team heads back to the station while opening credits begin to flash across the screen. We begin to get a good look at all of the members at Station 19 now. Ben Warren, being offended that he's referred to as a ""probie"" - he's been there a full two weeks now, y'all! Because being a surgeon in his past automatically should exempt him from probie-ship. He is our cross over from Grey's Anatomy character. Next is Victoria ""Vic"" Hughes - who ruthlessly mocks him. Next is Jack Gibson, the McSteamy of Station 19. Maybe we should call him McSmoky. In fact, he looks and acts very much like Mark Sloan of Grey's ... I wonder if the casting call specifically stated that the role required that the actor must resemble Eric Dane? Jack is talking to Captain Obvious, otherwise known as Captain Pruitt Herrera. Jack thinks that their successful fire extinguishing and cyber stalker dog owner rescuing today should make today a pole day. Pruitt shuts that down quick and puts the cocky Jack in his place. I like him already. Next up is Travis Montgomery, Maya Bishop, and Andrea ""Andy"" Herrera, who is Pruitt's daughter. They, along with Vic, look longingly at the pole. There may be something Freudian about that. Andy fusses over her father and he resents it. It's clear that she acts as her father's Administrative Assistant at the firehouse, along with her normal fire-fighting duties, and keeps the place running smoothly for him. And now, if you haven't put the clues together yet, this is a Grey's Anatomy Spin Off, as it states clearly across the bottom of the screen at just six minutes in: ""Based on Grey's Anatomy created by Shonda Rimes."" Thanks. The Eric Dane doppelganger didn't completely make that clear.

The scene changes to the crew eating dinner together. The last fire-fighter we meet is Dean, who is complaining about the quality of the meal being cooked by Travis. His complaint is that the meal is made up entirely of vegetables. It's revealed that Maya, the token blonde goddess, is an Olympic Gold Medal winner. Pruitt tells an embarrassing story about Andy from when she was a child. This is meant to relay to the audience that Andy is fiercely independent. As the conversation turns away from Andy, she gets up and leaves the table in her embarrassed angst. Jack follows her and here we are, at eight and a half minutes in, and Jack and Andy are getting ready to hook up. However, Andy finds a small jewelry box in Jack's pocket, pulls it out, and opens it to reveal an engagement ring. She is decidedly displeased and Jack back-pedals from an actual proposal. Before she can explain her lack of enthusiasm, the fire alarms go off and the team needs to respond to a fire.

En route to the fire, Maya questions Andy about what's wrong, just from the look on Andy's face. Without Andy saying anything, Maya figures out there was some sort of marriage proposal and that it didn't go well. They are such good friends, that they can have a conversation just with Andy's facial expressions. Arriving at the scene of the fire, they see a police car is blocking the fire hydrant. The police car, we learn, belongs to Andy's high school sweetheart, Ryan Tanner. Andy pushes his car out of the way with her firetruck, and has a shouting match with Ryan, taking her frustrations with Jack out on him. Yeah, we get it: Andy's a badass. The team enters the building in pairs. Jack goes into a child's bedroom away from Pruitt and loses him (against protocols). Jack calls for help and the team finds Pruitt collapsed and unconscious. They pull him out just before part of the fire explodes. They get Pruitt out just in time by jumping out a window since the fire has blocked them off from an escape. They land on landing airbags that have been deployed. Andy starts to hyperventilate, and Jack asks if she is all right. She pushes him away, so he walks off. Ryan comes up and calms her down a bit.

Pruitt is rushed off to Grey Sloan Memorial and of course Miranda Bailey (Ben's wife) is his doctor. Because this is a Grey's Anatomy Spin Off. Cue Meredith Grey cameo. Because this is a Grey's Anatomy Spin Off. Meredith takes Andy to a supply closet and lets her cry for a few moments before telling her to put on her game face and be brave for her team.

Pruitt awakes in a hospital bed with Andy hovering over him. She reads off from a note that he has stage 2 cancer. He never told her about it. He says he needs to step down as Captain. He says Jack will be in charge. Andy is clearly annoyed about that.

Cut to Andy at home. She is doing laundry and getting buzzed on beer. Ryan stops by. He announces he moved back in with his parents next door. He wants to know how she is. She is annoyed, she says everyone is making decisions about her life without her and lists all the ways her life is messed up. I am really not liking her, she's a narcissistic brat. Ryan, though, thinks she is being taken advantage of and encourages her to take over instead of Jack. She says she can't bury another parent (her mother has died before the series), and Ryan tries to offer comforting words. She throws herself at him, and here we are, at 27 minutes in, and she's hooking up with him. Earlier in the day she's screaming at him about his parking, now she's jumping on him. So much for that engagement!

Miranda shows up at the Station to check the place out. Ben's kicking himself over nothing and Miranda tells him to stop showing off. Jack finds Maya in the locker room and tries to talk to her about Andy and her unenthusiastic reaction to his non-proposal. Andy shows up behind Jack and hides but is eavesdropping. He says to Maya that if Andy doesn't love him then she should just tell him. I agree. Jack's too good for her. I can tell this already. Maya and Andy go running together and Andy tells her she slept with Ryan. Maya encourages her to be a strong independent woman and to forget about the boys for now.

Another fire rescue call, and Ryan is there. There is awkwardness all around between Ryan, Jack and Andy. Andy tells Ryan they have nothing to talk about, and Ryan says they are all good. Andy wants to know what that means. A college co-ed has gotten herself stuck between two building walls. She thought it was a shortcut. Andy is trying to free her. Jack asks how its going and Andy is short with him, causing the co-ed to start panicking. Andy gets her to calm down. Its unclear how they get her out, and Jack tells Andy how great she is. If he only knew. He tells her he thinks she is being taken advantage of by her Pruitt. He says he won't overlook her if he is put in charge of the Station.

She tells Pruitt that she wants to be considered for the Captain position. There's a problem: she's not a lieutenant like Jack is. She tells him to promote her. She says she is putting her hat in the ring.

Back at the Station, Ben is still trying to fit in with Vic and Travis. Vic starts calling him Warren, showing that she really does know his name. Back at the hospital, Pruitt tells Jack that he's stepping down, that he is promoting Andy to lieutenant, and that he is depending on the two of them to run the Station.

Back at the station, Dean reveals that he is in a relationship with the girl who's puppy he saved in the beginning of the show. Jack and Andy tell the team that they will both be running the Station for now. Andy tells everyone to go down the pole. Jack is not looking as on board with things as Andy is."
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7182534/?ref_=ttep_ep2,,"With the absence of Captain Pruitt, Andy and Jack try to navigate how to work together, and a car accident puts the crew's lives at risk.",[],TV-14,Release date,['Paris Barclay'],"['', '']",[],['car'],[],"The episode opens with a couple in bed and a periodically chirping smoke alarm. The lady says she changed the battery only yesterday, but it keeps chirping, and she can't ""get into it."" When it chirps again, her partner knocks it off the ceiling.

Pruitt is giving Andy instructions on how to manage the team from his hospital bed while Andy is ordering him a healthy meal from the cafeteria. Ben is dropping his stepson Tuck off at school, and Tuck is having hard time adjusting to Ben's new shift schedule and not being there all the time for him. Dean is woken up by Charlie, the dog he rescued in Episode 1. He says the only reason why the dog is there is because his owner's new place doesn't allow pets. What kind of anti-pet place does she live in, for Pete's sake? How can you not like dogs? Back to Pruitt and Andy bickering. He wants to be released today, not tomorrow. Back to Ben and Tuck bickering. Ben suggests Tuck come to the Station after school. Tuck, being a typical kid not being told what he wants to hear, gives Ben a look of disdain as he gets out of the car. Dean realizes Charlie used his alarm clock as a chew toy. Pruitt gives Andy advice on how to handle Battalion Chief Frankel, who seems to be the person who will be making the decision of who will become Captain of Station 19. Andy, in her usual over-confident self, says she knows how to handle Frankel.

Andy and Maya are in the Station, and Maya is giving Andy a pep talk of how to handle Frankel and how to view McSmokey as her opponent, not ex-boyfriend. Frankel walks in and informs them that they are the least exciting thing on her schedule, she wants to get these interviews over quickly. They head into a conference room, and Jack pulls the chair out for her. She says she hope she isn't trying to win favor with her. He assures her he was just being respectful. She congratulates Andy on her promotion. She talks about how tough it was to earn her rank and had nobody helping her. Andy is knocked down a peg by that, feeling the unseen slap. Frankel informs them that for now, one of them will be supervising the team for each shift and that they will be switching off. It will take months to fill the permanent Captain position. They have to take written exams, their peers need to be interviewed, as well as interviews with all levels of the Fire Department hierarchy. Frankel herself will be evaluating them. She says Andy is up first. McSmokey looks like smoke is coming out of his ears.

Andy, McSmokey and Frankel head downstairs and Andy calls the team to order. The only one who looks up is Maya, hahaha! McSmokey gets the rest of the team's attention and tells them to listen up. Andy says she wants the team to work on some basics. She instructs them to pair off, but with new partners, not the folks they are used to pairing off with. Ben and Vic are paired up. Vic displays her enthusiasm at this prospect rather unvigorously. She tells Ben not to screw up while the Battalion Chief is watching. McSmokey is timing them on some drills. Ben doesn't do well.

Frankel takes her leave and assures Andy that she will be popping in and out unscheduled. Just before Frankel hits the door, Dean rushes in late. Andy, feeling the need to assert her authority in front of Frankel, puts Dean on reception duty. Dean laughs, and Andy stares him down. She says that rules are rules. Dean argues that those are Pruitt's rules, and that Pruitt isn't even there. Andy tells him to take a seat. She's going all in since Frankel is watching her. The fire alarms go off and the team heads out, minus Dean.

Maya is pumped that she is driving the fire engine. Maya is giving Andy a pep talk again. Seems to be Maya's thing. Ben says, from the back, that he's not that excited - they've been called to Tuck's school. They meet the principal in the parking lot, who says it is probably a false alarm, while scolding some kids around her who are being little hoodlums, doing things they know they shouldn't be doing. The principal addresses McSmokey, asking if they can disable the alarm and get the kids back inside quickly. Andy bristles at that and brings the principal's attention on her. Looks like Andy is having difficulty with what they call ""presence.""

Andy barks assignments to the team and they all scatter. Right when she says she will check in with law enforcement, her ex shows up. Uncanny timing, Ryan.

Ben and Vic enter the school and disarm the pulled fire alarm. The alarm, when pulled, ejects some sort of colored gel so that they know who will have pulled the alarm. They are continuing to sweep the school and Tuck shows up and says, ""Hey, Dad."" He has his back turned to them, his hands shoved in his pockets, and acting super sus. When Ben asks him why he's not outside, Tuck walks off. Ben follows him, and grabs his arm. Tuck's hands are blue. Ben asks why Tuck pulled the alarm and Tuck says it was the quickest way he could get him there, no questions asked. Ben's like, what the whaty-what? And Tuck leads him into a bathroom. There, on the floor, is a student in labor. Tuck asks his father if he can help.

The girl's name is Ava. Her contractions are two minutes apart and her mother is the school principal. Who somehow hasn't noticed that her daughter is pregnant. Ava confirms that her mother pays attention to every kid except for her. Ben is having a heart attack, wondering how he's going to explain to Miranda that her son knocked someone up at their age, which looks to be about 12. Tuck assures him that he's not the father, he and Ava are just friends. The boyfriend/father isn't in school today because he is at the orthodontist getting his braces off. Dayum, Shonda! Ava's contractions seem pretty painful, even for a 12-year-old. Vic tells Ben that Ava is fully dilated, and she pushes him out of the way. Apparently, she has forgotten that he was a surgeon who went through medical school. They prepare for delivery.

Back at the Station, Dean is bored at the reception desk and is sharpening pencils. Lots of pencils. Apparently, the computer in front of him is not equipped with Solitaire or the Internet, or surely he'd be on social media to pass the time. The young lady from the first scene appears with her battered smoke detector. She asks if Dean can fix it. Dean and the girl, J.J., are flirting. She tells Dean that the smoke detector keeps going off, even though she keeps changing the batteries. Hmmm, a smoke detector that goes off, usually indicates, I don't know, smoke of some sort, right? I have questions. Dean tells her to get a new one, but she says she likes this one. I like many things in my house, but I've never had a preference of the smoke detectors. I like any that work. I'm just saying, is all. They continue to flirt.

At the school, Andy confirms it was a false alarm to Ryan. They are awkward. McSmokey comes back and confirms an all-clear to her, and she walks off to double check his work. Ryan tells Jack that he has his work cut out to win the Captain position, because Andy doesn't lose at anything.

Andy is griping to Maya about how Jack had to get the team's attention and that the principal assumed Jack was in charge. Maya tells her that she has to take the power. Girl power! Andy wants to get the kids back to class because Frankel will be checking how long they were at a false alarm.

Back in the labor and delivery room - I mean, lavatory, Ben tells Andy that they need some medical supplies from the Aid Car. Andy has already dismissed the Aid Car. Hmm, this looks like it may have been a big no-no.

Back at the Station, Dean is fixing the beaten smoke detector, and continuing to flirt with J.J. Travis walks in on them. He wants to know how long J.J. has been there since she is in her stocking feet. Since Travis is needling him, Dean finishes fixing the smoke detector and sends J.J. on her way. The Aid Car is called out. Travis takes Dean with him.

Back at the school, Andy is trying to get the Aid Car back, and the principal overhears her and demands to know why they need an Aid Car. She knows Andy isn't telling her everything.

Back in the labor and delivery lavatory, Ava has to start pushing. She is terrified. Vic tries to calm her a bit by getting everyone to sing ""I'm A Little Teapot."" The baby is born still in the amniotic sac. Dayum, Shonda! The baby isn't moving. Andy is requesting a status report. Ben and Vic aren't sure what to do. The baby moves and they decide to break the amniotic sac instead of waiting for the Aid Car. The baby, of course, is okay.

The principal comes into the lavatory, and tends to her daughter and grandchild. Andy defensively tells Ben that she made the right call by dismissing the Aid Car when she did. He never even brought it up and is taken aback by her reaction. He tells Tuck to scrub his hands, take his sweatshirt off, and not tell Miranda that he was the one who pulled the fire alarm.

Is it just me, or was pulling that alarm a little, I don't know, extreme, to get his father there? I have questions.

Travis and Dean arrive at a retirement home. Their patient is a Mr. Paige, who can't get up off his shower stool. Because he is caught in it. If you need me to spell out how, watch the episode. They get him free, help him dress, and talk to him about his family, who don't visit often. Travis reveals that he is lonely. He lost his husband the year before in a fire. They tell Mr. Paige that some of the women at the retirement home were asking after him. This cheers him up. I am not sure if Shonda is suggesting to us that Mr. Paige purposely caught himself in the shower stool to get some company? If so, extreme. Shonda is certainly extreme.

Back at the Station, Vic asks Andy why she sent the Aid Car away. Andy says it was protocol. Vic says she jumped the gun. Andy doesn't take that very well. Back in her father's office, McSmokey comes in to chat. He overheard the Vic comments. At first, he bucks her up a little, but when she gets condescending with him, he tells her that he is a shoo-in for Captain. Andy clearly annoyed.

The team is called out to a motor vehicle accident. There is an overturned tanker, but no fire. They split up to look for and assist victims. Dean, who is supposed to be on desk duty and Andy knows it, and Travis try to help a man, Shawn, out of his car. The truck driver is laying in the middle of the road, and Vic and Ben are helping him. They notice and remark that it is unusually hot. They assume it is from the truck. Vic is spooked. A firefighter who is not with their station starts yelling for them to put him out. He looks like he is battling flames but there are none. Andy orders that all the headlights on the vehicles be shut off, revealing the fire fighter is indeed on fire with pale blue flames. They are able to rescue him and put him out, but there is blue fire all over the road, closing off Vic, Ben and their victim. The tanker is leaking ethanol and the water from the hose will make it spread. They have no more foam and need to have some brought to them. Vic and Ben look for ways to escape but they can't, and won't leave the victim. As their options narrow and the flames grow closer, Vic becomes rattled. Without speaking, so as not to burn their lungs, Ben and Vic silently ""sing"" ""I'm A Little Teapot."" He is trying to keep her from panicking. The team decide to back one of the fire trucks over the flames and pull Vic, Ben and the victim onto the back of the truck. They rescue them and somehow, the truck doesn't catch on fire.

Back at the Station, Vic and Ben are being cared for by the team. Andy is invigorated. Pruitt has been released and Ryan had picked him up. He had heard about the tanker fire and figured Andy was busy. Pruitt congratulates the group. The team excitedly tells Pruitt about it, but Vic walks away. Ben comes and finds her. Vic says she has never gotten that close to death before. She is still rattled.

Tuck comes into the Station and says he thought he would stop by. But the alarm goes off. However, Tuck has renewed respect for him, and encourages him to go, he will be back later. Andy and McSmokey exchange some sexually charged comments. Dean and Ben arrive at an apartment where the landlord says a neighbor heard some screams. They hear a woman in obvious pain, and it is J.J. on the floor. Her smoke detector is chirping again, and she fell off a ladder trying to get to it. Dean says he definitely fixed the smoke detector, but its still chirping. Hmm ... smoke detectors usually go off when they detect smoke, right? Dean is examining the ceiling, and J.J. tells him there is a crawl space up there. He punches through her ceiling with his ax and smoke comes billowing out. Didn't she smell the smoke? Would you not smell the smoke even if it was enclosed? How long was it enclosed? I have questions, Shonda!"
